with a drastic decrease

the last couple of years...

on our camp.

go a number of our regular counselors.

on a replacement,

He was working

with the new owners over there.

left us, he inquired about the job.

Look, in the two years since
he left us for Twin Oaks,

00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:07,923
he was singlehandedly responsible
for doubling their attendance!

What the hell were you ever doing
with him in the first place?

178
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,551
I've known him
for a long time.

179

The guy is an asshole, Kelly.

180
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,523
Whatever.

181
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,818
Great.

182
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,242
Grandpa, why did you have to
bring Ricky back here?

183
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,994
Of all the people
for this job, why him?

184
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,036
Well...

185
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,081
Honey,

186
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,086
look.

187
00:13:56,127 --> 00:14:00,340
A long time ago I promised your parents
that if anything ever happened to them,

188
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,551
I'd take care of you.

189
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,429
Now, you know I want this camp
to be yours one day.

190
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,847
But for that to happen,

191
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,851
I have to do everything I can to
make sure that it's still here.

192
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:18,400
And strange as it may seem, Ricky
can help make that happen.

193
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,279
But you don't understand
how awkward it is for me

194
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,031
to have Ricky and Kyle here
at the same time.

195
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,368
Oh, honey, all I ask is
that you try to understand.

196
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:33,915
All I'm doing is what I think
is best for the camp.

197
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,667
Grandpa, I know that.

198
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,379
It's just really difficult
right now.

199
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,133
All right,
all you happy campers.

200
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:47,178
All you have to do is aim
and yell "pull."

Great shot. Where did you
learn to shot like that?

204
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:55,964
I used to live in Detroit.
Want to try? Yeah.

205
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,651
When you're ready,
just yell "pull", okay?

I know I promised not to interfere.
But, look, I'm concerned here.

218
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,852
The meet is only a week away, and frankly,
I don't see much talent out there.

219
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:38,355
Oh, Neil, relax.
This is only the first week.

220
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,816
I'm gonna get them going.
Tomorrow we'll dig in deep.

221
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,498
It's going to be fine. And besides,
you don't need a lot of talent.

222
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,110
Look at your career.

223
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,716
Hey. It ain't the Pope.
Take a hike.

224
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,191
Yes?

225
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,527
Mrs. Monica Shavetts
would like to speak with you.

226
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:26,986
The Twin Oaks owner?

227
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,751
My, my, my, Mr. Peterson.
This is so quaint and cozy.

228
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,004
It's very provincial.

229
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,509
Kind of late in the day
for introductions, isn't it?

230
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,511
I do apologize.

231
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:54,389
I just know how busy
you must be during the day.

232
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:58,518
I mean, what do you have here,
60 or 70 campers staying?

233
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,478
Something like that. Yeah.

234
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,733
My. I have 127.

235
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:08,779
Well, like they say. It's not the
quantity, it's the quality, right?

236
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:16,536
Please excuse Nunzio and his
walnut fetish, Mr. Peterson.

237
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:22,125
He lacked a certain amount
of oxygen during childbirth.

238
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,880
What do you want,
Mrs. Shavetts?

239
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:30,717
Cut to the chase.
I like that in a man.

240
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,844
My friends at the bank
have informed me

241
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:37,307
that Lakeside Camp is experiencing
some minor financial difficulty.

242
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,392
A minor problem?

243
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:43,772
A delinquent $200,000 mortgage
is a pretty big problem.

244
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:47,692
Especially for a money-losing
venture such as Lakeside.

245
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,865
Now... Nunzio. Shit!

246
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:57,619
Whatever you say, ma'am. Hey,
buddy, where's your toilet?

247
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,079

Sorry, ma'am.

to my latest venture.

and vacationing bliss.

252
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,184
It's been a dream of mine
for many years, Mr. Peterson.

253
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:25,522
However, there is one problem.

254
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:30,276
My camp is the only lakeside
property zoned for new construction.

255
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:34,113
Precisely. That's why
I'm here with an offer.

256
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:39,703
$500,000 in cash for Lakeside.

257
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,162
Enough to pay off
your mortgage

258
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:44,541
and to make your pending
retirement more comfortable.

259
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,793
I'm willing to give you
a few days to think about it.

260
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:50,088
No need.
I can give you my answer now.

261
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,507
No.

262
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,092
I know your type,
Mrs. Shavetts.

263
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,636
You'd do anything
to make a buck.

264
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:00,849
The difference between you and me is
that I care about this little lake

265
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:04,895
and you don't give a good damn what happens
to it as long as the cash flows in.

266
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:08,982
Next you'll be changing the laws to
bring in gambling and prostitution.

267
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:12,819
Oh, no. Those are illegal.
As is stealing.

268
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,613
Perhaps I should have you arrested
for stealing Ricky Wade from me.

269
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:20,869
I didn't steal anybody. Ricky
came to me on his own for a job.

270
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,872
Said he didn't care much
for the new owner over there.

271
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,290
Now I know why.

272
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,631
So if you people
don't mind...

273
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:38,219

I do hope you'll reconsider.

00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,911
because Twin Oaks has won the
last three years in a row.

318
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:34,331
BOY: All right. Bite me.

319
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:38,459
Now, tomorrow
is not mandatory, okay?

320
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:42,713
You can try out if you want to.
You don't have to. However!

321
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:47,593
If you are into getting the full
enjoyment of your ski vacation

322
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:51,430
and, believe me, there is
no thrill in the world

323
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:55,434
like watching your competition
eat your wake.

324
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,561
(ALL CHEERING)

325
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,603
Right?

326
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:10,449
Then, go on and party on and we'll
see you at 9:00 a.m. in the morning.

327
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,742
Sharp.

328
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,161
(ALL CHEERING)

329
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:26,049
You, know, was it me, or have I
seen this shirt somewhere before?

330
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,303
Nice shirt. I see the 10 has taste.
Does he have a name?

331
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:34,765
Yeah, actually,
it's Wes, Jennifer.

332
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,851
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

333
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,229
(SLOW ROCK PLAYING)

334
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:49,821
Oh, boy.

335
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:06,172
I have nothing to fear
but fear itself.

336
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:09,008
I have everything to gain
and nothing to lose.

337
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,307
Come on, Victor, do it.

338
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,852
Do it. Do it!

339
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:24,982
I'm a winner, not a loser.
I'm a winner, not a loser.

340
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,776
I'm a winner, not a loser.

341
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:30,654
I'm a winner, not a loser. Come on,
Victor. I'm a winner, not a loser.

342
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,407
I'm a winner, not a loser.

343
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,325
Oh, God.

344
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,244
My God, my dress!

345
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,496
I'm sorry. I tripped.

346
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,498
Oh, you idiot.

347
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,541
I didn't mean it.

348
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,463
God, some guys
get all the women.

349
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,966
What's wrong with you? You look like the
jury just gave you the electric chair.

350
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:55,721
Monica Shavetts came by. She made
me an offer to buy Lakeside.

351
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:59,058
Whoa, man. Stay away from that
woman. I'm serious. She is bad news.

352
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,769
Well, you don't
have to convince me.

353
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:04,563
Oh, Ricky,
this meet is so important.

354
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:08,276
I've just got to generate
more business.

355
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:12,155
Don't worry.
If we win it, they will come.

356
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,159
And we will win. Trust me.

357
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,590
What's the matter?
I don't know.

358
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,177
You mad at me? No.

359
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,764
Is it because I didn't get
the rec director's job?

360
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:43,436
No. Of course not. It's just,
it's different this year.

361
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,689
You mean
because of Ricky Wade?

362
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,234
No. It has nothing to do with
Ricky. He's ancient history.

363
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,069
Ancient history? Yeah.

364
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:01,162
Well, you know what they say about
history repeating itself, don't you?

365
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,623
Look, will you just...

366
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,924
Hark. Hark. What is this
my eyes see before me?

367
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,887
A man, a young attractive man standing
by himself on a porch at night

368
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:18,971
with a party going on.

369
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,349
Where's the party police?
Party police!

370
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:25,644
There's a man standing out here by
himself and his name is Victor.

371
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,230
I'm sorry, honest.
I didn't mean that.

372
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,149
Didn't mean what?

373
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,026
Take your choice.

374
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:35,530
Dumping water on everybody.
Smashing the women's shower.

375
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:40,659
Causing that.
Sorry. I'm such a klutz.

376
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:45,206
You did all that?
In one day?

377
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,666
Oh...

378
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:51,337
It's true. It is you.
It's the Devil.

379
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:53,464
Where's that sign?
"666 Damian."

380
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:54,882
Come on, Damian,
I know it's you.

381
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:20,658
I think I'm gonna change
that 10 to a 12. Yeah?

382
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,915
Numbers can't express
the way I'm feeling right now.

383
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,055
So basically, that's
the story of my life.

384
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:46,476
Getting in the way, ruining
other people's good times.

385
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,185
Don't worry about it, Victor.

386
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,021
Here, have a cigarette,
it'll make you feel better.

387
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,649
I don't smoke, Ricky.

388
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,942
Well, it's a good time
to start. Go ahead.

389
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:55,984
Okay.

390
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,696
Ow!

391
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,407
You see,
you shouldn't smoke, Victor.

392
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:05,786
Well, anyway, that's my biggest
problem. I have no friends.

393
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:08,331
That's why my parents
suggested I take this trip.

394
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,750
Maybe to meet some new people,
maybe even a girl.

395
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,713
A girl here at camp?
Wait a minute.

396
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:20,426
Girl. Camp. Girl. Camp.

397
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:24,138
Oh, my God, what a concept.
A girl in camp.

398
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,640
(EXCLAIMING)

399
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:30,478
Victor. Oh, thank you. Thank you,
Victor. Oh, Victor. Thank you.

400
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,229
You're welcome.

401
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:36,359
Oh, boy, look.
It's a rock.

402
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,736
Actually,
it's a tombstone, Vic.

403
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,446
No, it's a feldspar.

404
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:43,824
It's indigenous to most mountainous
areas. See, I collect rocks.

405
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:45,826
You collect rocks.

406
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:50,707
Well, that's very
boring of you, bud.

407
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:53,668
It's Victor. I collect them
and I paint them.

408
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,879
Paint rocks, do you? Landscapes.
Animal faces. You name it.

409
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:01,674
Not much call for that kind
of thing, is there, Vic?

410
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:02,968
No, not at all.

411
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:07,264
This is it, huh? This is where the
infamous Thigpen legend began.

412
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,726
Isn't that right? Yeah.

413
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:12,729
Tell me, Victor,
you ever consider

414
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:17,191
taking your rocks and painting small
women with big breasts on them?

415
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:19,902
Boy, look, Ricky,
igneous specimens.

416
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:24,823
(BOTH GASPING)

417
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,158
Oh, my gosh!

418
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,787
What? Jeez. Oh, my gosh.

419
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,794
I knew it. God!

420
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,048
Friend of yours?

421
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,370
Well, he was all
into kissing me,

422
00:30:42,397 --> 00:30:44,761
but I don't feel comfortable
around him anymore.

423
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:46,721
I don't know.
Something's changed.

424
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,889
Tell me what happened.

425
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:52,518
Stormed away as usual. Are you
kidding? I wanted to talk about it.

426
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,311
He didn't.

427
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,522
So, Kyle thinks that because
you weren't in the mood

428
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:58,065
it has something to do
with Ricky?

429
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,233
Uh-huh.

430
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,820
Well? Does it?

431
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:09,201
Good night, Jennifer.

432
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,913
You slut.

433
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,331
(BOTH GIGGLING)

434
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,884
What the...

435
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,808
What are you
doing here, Wade?

436
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,059
Well, this is bungalow
number two, isn't it?

437
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,562
Yeah, this is my bungalow.

438
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:38,522
Just one second.
Hold that thought.

439
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:41,150
Thanks a lot, Neil.

440
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:47,782
Well, guess
it's our bungalow now.

441
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,241
What hell
are you talking about?

442
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:52,244
Well, Neil said, "Go crash
in bungalow number two,"

443
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:55,289
and this looks like it would
be bungalow number two.

444
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:59,251
No, way. I'm the only one here
who sleeps in number two.

445
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,920
And I bet you're real proud
of that, too, aren't you?

446
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:03,756
Well, listen.

447
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,468
What do you say we just
let you blow off some steam?

448
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,870
Get out whatever you got to get
out. Let it out in the open.

449
00:32:09,872 --> 00:32:11,790
Come on, just do it with me.
Breathe. It's okay.

450
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:13,766
It's okay. Let it go.
Come on. Let it go.

451
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:16,644
That rec director's job, that
was supposed to be mine, Wade.

452
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:19,062
I busted my ass for it
and I deserved it.

453
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,440
Let's not kid
each other, Wade.

454
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:24,318
I don't like you,
and you don't like me.

455
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,945
So, don't expect me to jump
up every time you call,

456
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,072
'cause it ain't
going to happen. Dig?

457
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:32,910
Finished?
Yeah, I'm finished.

458
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:38,791
Now, why don't we take your little ego
and put it in a box for awhile, okay?

459
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,543
And we'll get back
to it later.

460
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:45,255
Right now, let's worry about the future
of Lakeside and winning this meet.

461
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,926
And remember,
I'm in charge here. Not you.

462
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:53,305
Oh, and let's remember
something else.

463
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:54,973
I'm sleeping
on the bottom bunk.

464
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,893
Not you.

465
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,102
Okay, I want you
to remember something, Wade.

466
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,940
I'm with Kelly, now. Not you.

467
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,572
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
What's the problem, man?

468
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:13,242
My finger. My finger. Oh, God. It
cramps up like this all the time.

469

00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:45,452
Come on.

624
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:53,917
Yes, yeah.

625
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:17,400
Come on, buddy.
Let's go.

626
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,235
Come on, Victor. Yeah.

627
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:38,921
What the hell is he doing?

628
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:42,175
He's gonna try the ramp.

629
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,310
Stupid asshole.

630
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:58,775
ANNOUNCER: Seems our judges weren't
very impressed with Victor Thigpen.

631
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,652
Tough break, Victor.

632
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:02,534
You did good. You went
out there and you tried.

633
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:03,946
That's all that matters.

634
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,708
BOY: You get them next time,
man. All right.

635
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:07,821
Had to be a hero, didn't you?

636
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,910
ANNOUNCER: Going into our final
event, the men's ski jump,

637
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:53,996
Lakeside finds itself
with a comfortable lead.

638
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:58,000
Twin Oaks' only hope is their
Recreation Director Michael Peltz.

639
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,306
What a magnificent jump
for Twin Oaks.

640
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:14,350
Plenty of distance
and a near-perfect landing.

641
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,436
Let's see
how the judges score him.

642
00:48:17,813 --> 00:48:20,816
9.4, 9.1 and 9.7.

643
00:48:20,857 --> 00:48:22,275
And that effort

644
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:27,989
puts Twin Oaks back
into the lead by 13.4 points.

645
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,909
And now our final contestant,
Lakeside Recreation Director

646
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,412
Ricky Wade.

647
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:38,875
Ricky. Ricky. Ricky.
Ricky. Ricky. Ricky.

648
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,920
ALL: Ricky. Ricky.
Ricky. Ricky.

649
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:46,675
Ricky. Ricky. Ricky.
Ricky. Ricky.

650
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:48,968
Come on, man, let's nail it.

651
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:59,521
Hey. Hey. Hey. Wait. Hold on!

652
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,858
ANNOUNCER: Whoa. Look out!

653
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:08,070
Ricky Wade barely avoids a major
wipeout. This isn't over yet.

654
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,782
Let's see how the judges
score Ricky's jump.

655
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:13,409
4.1, 4.5 and 5.2.

656
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:17,246
And that means by four-tenths
of a point Lakeside wins.

657
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:26,756
How do you like that, Miss Shavetts,
huh? We'll see you next year.

658
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:27,965
Damn it.

659
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:37,266
(ALL CHEERING)

660
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:50,238
Hey, tough take-off, man.
You all right?

661
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,949
Am I all right?
Oh, yeah, I'm just fine.

662
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,830
Probably doing a lot better
than you right now,

663
00:49:54,871 --> 00:49:56,751
'cause you got to go out
and look for a new job.

664
00:49:56,778 --> 00:49:58,413
New job?

665
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:02,959
Yeah. Yeah. Do you understand
English? You're fired.

666
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,670
Fired? For what? Yeah.

667
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:09,340
For what? Well, let's think
about this.

668
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:12,594
I got it. It's probably because you tried
to dump me in that lake back there.

669
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,263
Oh, man,
you're so full of shit!

670
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,664
You were the one that almost
lost it out there, man. Not me.

671
00:50:17,691 --> 00:50:19,058
Oh, really? Yeah.

672
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,019
Why don't you be man enough
to admit it, Wade?

673
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:25,565
Well, you're fired. I can be
man enough to admit that.

674
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:30,946
Neil, I mean, do something.

675
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:33,782
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry, son.
That's Ricky's decision.

676
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:36,158
KYLE: Thanks. Thanks a lot.

677
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,869
Kyle, come back here.
You coming with me?

678
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:39,287
Why, I'm supposed
to decide...

679
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:41,168
I mean leaving these losers
and coming with me.

680
00:50:41,195 --> 00:50:43,583
Kyle, I can't
leave my grandpa.

681
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:46,335
Fine. Then stay with him.

682
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:51,007
You did this on purpose. Just to hurt.
Why did you ever have to come back here?

683
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,092
Kelly, I...
And how could you let him?

684
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:01,100
Stuck in last night.
Really?

685
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:03,478
Did you see that?
You know something, Dick?

686
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:06,147
I'm starting to like this joint.
You know what I mean?

687
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,775
Relax. What have you,
never seen boobs before?

688
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:14,739
Hey, wait a minute. Are you
calling me a sissy boy?

689
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:16,491
Is that
what you're inlluding to?

690
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:20,036
"Inlluding to"? It's
"alluding to." Okay, Nunzio?

691
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,079
Alluding to.
Get something right.

692
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:25,124
So, you are calling me one.

693
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,526
Christ. You think
you know someone,

694
00:51:26,553 --> 00:51:29,211
they turn around,
they stab you in the back.

695
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:30,463
Et tu, Bruno?

696
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:34,592
Shut up!

697
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:38,095
I never called you a sissy boy,
okay? And it's Brutus, okay?

698
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:42,141
Get it right. "Et tu, Brutus?"
Not Bruno. Moron.

699
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:44,435
WOMAN: Paging Dick and Nunzio.
Dick and Nunzio.

700
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:46,562
See Monica Shavetts
in her workout room.

701
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,276
Did you release
our recreation director?

702
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,863
Yes, ma'am, no problem.
That's right, Mrs. Shavetts.

703
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:56,823
And I personally guarantee

704
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:59,826
that dickhead won't be showing his
stinking butt around here anymore.

705
00:51:59,868 --> 00:52:02,203
Well, I have
another assignment for you.

706
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,206
After this afternoon's
rather humiliating events,

707
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,208
I have decided
it's in my best interest

708
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,628
to expedite
Mr. Peterson's financial woes.

709
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,214
Am I understood?
Yes, ma'am.

710
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,842
As Mr. Peterson still offers
a money-back guarantee,

711
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:17,844
the thought occurred to me.

712
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:21,973
What if things became rather
unpleasant for his customers?

713
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:25,226
Yeah, they'd ask for a refund,
and he can't afford it.

714
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,144
Get on it immediately.

715
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:28,730
And be discreet.

716
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:31,440
Don't sweat it, ma'am.
Discreet is our middle name.

717
00:52:33,068 --> 00:52:35,152
Funny, I thought
it was "dickhead."

718
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:42,077
Oh, my gosh, what a great day this
was. Did you see your grandfather?

719
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:45,496
In all the years that I have known him
I have never seen him so excited.

720
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,375
What's wrong?
Don't you feel like talking?

721
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:54,130
No, Jen,
I was just thinking to myself.

722
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:57,092
Really, Kelly, about what?

723
00:52:57,133 --> 00:53:00,469
Oh, life,
health, wealth, security.

724
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,180
What it would be like
to sleep with the Terminator.

725
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,393
I'm sorry.
I just have a lot on my mind.

726
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,646
I know.
Kyle didn't call, did he?

727
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,982
I don't care if he does.

728
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,779
Really? Why?

729
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,240
Because of something
he said today.

730
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:24,201
He called everyone over here
losers. He meant it, too.

731
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:28,915
People here are my friends
and my family.

732
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:33,252
And I have no desire to be with
anyone who thinks of them as losers.

733
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:36,756
Yeah, you know, I'm starting to
feel the same way about Wes.

734
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:39,092
I mean, when Victor
fell off his Jet Ski today,

735
00:53:39,134 --> 00:53:40,927
he just started
chewing him out

736
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:43,429
like it was the end of
the world or something.

737
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:45,181
I really don't like that.

738
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:49,226
Why did Ricky
leave you, Kelly?

739
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:52,939
I never knew.

740
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:58,694
You know, the day he left,
he didn't say a word.

741
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:02,490
And before that
we never had any problems.

742
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:05,576
I mean, you knew us.
We never fought.

743
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:08,245
As a matter of fact,
things were pretty terrific.

744
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:11,082
I was never happier.

745
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:14,251
Then all of a sudden it was
over, like it was all a dream.

746
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:17,839
Who knows? Maybe it was.

747
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,395

749

If you don't mind, we got a
teeny-weeny favor to ask y'all.

00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:23,320

Stop that, will you?
Pour the stupid thing.

753
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,328
All right. These girls are
going to look like Smurfs.

754
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:35,499
Hey, what is that?
Oh, my God!

755
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:36,541

00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:08,574
Oh, God. Not now.

759
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,787
Hi, Hillary.
Look. I was just about to...

760
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:17,166
Wait. Please.
You don't have to explain.

761
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:21,003
I just wanted to apologize for all
the trouble that I've caused you.

762
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:25,091
You just came here like everybody
else to have a good time.

763
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:28,385
And it really hurts me to think that
I'm the one ruining it for you.

764
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:31,430
I'm sorry, Hillary.

765
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:34,683
I'm really sorry.

766
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,853
Bye. Wait.

767
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:41,398
It's Victor, right?

768
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:48,948
I'm telling you, man.
Tonight Hillary is mine.

769
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,407
Yeah? Yeah.

770
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,868
I don't know, man.

771
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,704
Looks like you might have to
wait in line. Check it out.

772
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:02,253
I am going to kill that tub of
lard. Hey, chill. Chill. Look.

773
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:05,422
First of all,
you kick fatty's ass,

774
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:11,512
and Hillary is gonna be pissed at you
and feel sorry for that guy over there.

775
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,473
Girls are all the same.
That's the way they work.

776
00:57:13,515 --> 00:57:15,475
You got to play it cool.
You and I both know that.

777
00:57:15,502 --> 00:57:16,767
Yeah. Look.

778
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:18,978
We'll make sure that the boy
from planet Vic gets his,

779
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,604
and sooner than he thinks.

780
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,398
Just a matter of time, huh?

781
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,401
BOTH: And how.

782
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,449
Nice night.

783
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:35,161
Oh, it's you.

784
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:38,164
Scared me.

785
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:42,459
Mind if I sit down?

786
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:48,924
Well, until the lab results come
in, I'll take that as a yes.

787
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:53,637
It's funny,
I remember that

788
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,932
the only time you used to come out here
at night alone and sit on the dock

789
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,060
was when something
was bothering you.

790
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:04,523
I guess tonight that something
is probably me.

791
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:08,986
Well, things are starting
to get back to normal.

792
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:12,240
I mean, I'd fallen in love with
Kyle. I'd gotten over you.

793
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:15,701
Then you decide to just breeze back
into town and mess everything up.

794
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:18,413
Now, wait a minute...
No. No. You wait a second.

795
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:22,417
You think you can just parachute in
here like nothing was ever between us.

796
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:26,254
Did you ever maybe consider how I
might feel if you showed up again?

797
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:28,089
Yes, I did,
as a matter of fact.

798
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,841
I thought about that and I knew
that you and Kyle were in love.

799
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:32,301
And that
you had this relationship.

800
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:34,803
I mean, everybody around
the lake knows about that.

801
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:38,557
And I thought that me being here
wouldn't bother you at all.

802
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:39,892
Wouldn't bother me?

803
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:42,134
You came in and fired him
so that he'd break up with me.

804
00:58:42,161 --> 00:58:43,729
That's not true.

805
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,731
I did not fire him
so he'd break up with you.

806
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:47,900
But as a matter of fact,
you breaking up with him

807
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,236
is probably the best thing that
could have ever happened to you.

808
00:58:50,278 --> 00:58:52,447
I mean, why did you ever
get involved with that jerk?

809
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:55,157
Because the other jerk in my life
took off and left me hanging.

810
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:01,497
Why did you leave me, Ricky?

811
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:08,170
I left you

812
00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:13,509
because I was afraid, Kell.

813
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:17,930
You see,

814
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:22,101
your grandfather always said
that he wanted the best for you.

815
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:23,560
The absolute best.

816
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,316
You see, my problem

817
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:33,028
is that Ricky Wade has never
been the best at anything.

818
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,030
Ever.

819
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,784
And I don't want
to bring you down with me.

820
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:43,289
I didn't want to destroy your
future. So I left. I took off.

821
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:46,583
Because I cared.

822
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:52,548
I came back here
because I cared.

823
00:59:55,968 --> 01:00:02,808
Your grandfather cares a lot about you
and he cares a lot about this camp.

824
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:06,228
And he wants you to have
this camp when he's gone.

825
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:10,483
And I want to see that happen.

826
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:13,694
I'm sorry, Kelly.

827
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:18,574
So sorry I hurt you.

828
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:21,243
Please forgive me.

829
01:00:29,544 --> 01:00:33,464
NEIL: Kelly! Kelly!

830
01:00:33,506 --> 01:00:36,425
Something must be wrong.
Grandpa's never up this late.

831
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:50,356
Tomorrow morning,
I'm closing the camp.

832
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:54,360
I have no choice.

833
01:00:56,571 --> 01:01:00,782
The mortgage
and all these refunds...

834
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:07,998
It's simply
too much to handle.

835
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:16,673
Son, I want to thank you for
everything you've done for us.

836
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:22,137
You brought back
an awful lot of good memories.

837
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:27,059
Kelly.

838
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:32,940
Sweetheart, forgive me.
Oh, Grandpa.

839
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,196
(KELLY CRYING)

840
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:51,626
Ricky. What's wrong?

841
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:54,711
Nothing. Do you have any
broken glass I could gargle?

842
01:01:58,966 --> 01:01:59,966
What is it?

843
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,640
Two of the biggest boobs
I've seen all night.

844
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:06,723
How do I look?

845
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:09,726
Great. Come on.

846
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:17,818
These must be really special boobs
if we have to sneak up on them.

847
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,737
These aren't boobs.
These are bad guys.

848
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,747
Son of a bitch!

849
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:35,210
VICTOR: My bungalow.
Who did this?

850
01:02:36,504 --> 01:02:37,546
Oh, crap.

851
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,049
What?

852
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:44,303
I had some rocks I was painting to
look like dried fruit and nuts.

853
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:45,804
They must have took them.

854
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:03,155
(VICTOR SHUDDERING)

855
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:08,243
I think these guys
have seen too many movies.

856
01:03:13,332 --> 01:03:15,501
Neil, I think
I've got a solution.

857
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:17,753
But it's gonna
take some big cojones.

858
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:31,559
My, my,
if it isn't little Rick.

859
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:34,978
My, my,
if it isn't little Dick.

860
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,813
MONICA: Dick, show him in.

861
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,653
Ricky. How nice
to see you again.

862
01:03:42,695 --> 01:03:45,531
Please, come and sit down.

863
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,452
Would you care for a drink?

864
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:52,913
Yeah, sure.
I'll have a double-chocolate

865
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,416
decaffeinated milkshake
with a cherry.

866
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:58,419
Always ready with a joke.
I like that in a man.

867
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,920
Here's your drink...

868
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:02,130
Whoa!

869
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,341
Kyle! Nice outfit.

870
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:05,983
Hey, listen,
while you're standing there,

871
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,511
I got a little dirt
on my shoe.

872
01:04:07,553 --> 01:04:09,304
You mind
polishing that for me?

873
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:10,888
Stop.

874
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:13,934
Now, sit down.

875
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:16,144
I wonder if he shits
on command, too?

876
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,479
(CHUCKLES)

877
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,189
That will be enough, you two.

878
01:04:20,733 --> 01:04:22,735
Why did you
want this meeting?

879
01:04:22,777 --> 01:04:24,903
I have an offer
from Neil Peterson.

880
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:27,989
Oh, interesting. Enlighten me.

881
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,825
He'd like to have a rematch
on the ski meet.

882
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,827
Another ski meet?

883
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,288
Why should we give you jerks
another ski meet?

884
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:35,497
Let me finish.

885
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,041
Now.

886
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:43,255
This time the stakes
will be bigger.

887
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:45,841
Much bigger.

888
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:49,219
If Twin Oaks wins,

889
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:51,680
he's going to accept that offer
you made him the other day.

890
01:04:53,808 --> 01:04:56,351
However, if Lakeside wins,

891
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,689
you'll pay off our mortgage
and leave us alone.

892
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:05,694
When do you propose
this rematch?

893
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:08,363
The day after tomorrow.
So soon?

894
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,658
Well, for some
unexplained reason,

895
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:12,909
many of our campers
have decided to leave.

896
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:18,624
Same rules. Same judges.
What's your response?

897
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:20,917
I accept.

898
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:23,920
But on one condition.

899
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:29,134
If Lakeside loses,
you come back to work for me.

900
01:05:29,176 --> 01:05:32,304
At minimum wage
for a period of 5 years.

901
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,139
What?

902
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:39,186
How important
is this to you, Ricky?

903
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:43,190
This isn't the world of chocolate
shakes and extra cherries, you know.

904
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:44,775
This is the real world.

905
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:48,529
Are you going to
put up or shut up?

906
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,745
Well, Monica,
I'll be putting up.

907
01:05:58,038 --> 01:06:00,290
Come on, guys,
let's do it. Come on.

908
01:06:00,332 --> 01:06:02,668
Anything's possible
if you want it bad enough.

909
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:04,753
Look at Michael Jackson.

910
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:41,540
Wes. Howie. Looking good. Hey, where
did you learn to ski like that?

911
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:47,671
Ladies and gentlemen,

912
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:51,800
I give you Victor, the ninth
and tenth wonder of the world.

913
01:06:55,888 --> 01:06:58,223
Hey, Victor.
Show me something special.

914
01:07:03,729 --> 01:07:07,691
Come on, do it, baby. Come on.
I know you can do it.

915
01:07:07,733 --> 01:07:10,778
Come on do it, man.
Do it. Do it. Yes. Yeah.

916
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:12,905
All right. Way to go, Thigpen.

917
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:15,616
Shit.

918
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:20,036
All right. Looking good.
Bring it on in. Let's go.

919
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:22,038
Come on, stay on the ball.
Let's go.

920
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:29,630
Yeah!

921
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:39,598
Jump the wake.
Let me see you jump the wake.

922
01:07:40,015 --> 01:07:41,016
Yeah.

923
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:49,942
All right.
Solid move. Way to go.

924
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:56,573
My curiosity toys with me.

925
01:07:56,615 --> 01:08:02,329
Tell me, Mr. Linck. What do you
rate our chances tomorrow?

926
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:07,001
Excellent. Beyond excellent. If I had
a million dollars, I'd bet it all.

927
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:09,419
Well, I wish
I had your confidence.

928
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,630
Unfortunately, I don't.

929
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:15,884
Which is why my two associates
here are going to assist you.

930
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:17,678
In the background, of course.

931
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:21,139
Assist me? Why?
We can win this thing, Monica.

932
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:23,558
I've put together
an excellent team here.

933
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,727
You are a very good
ski instructor.

934
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:30,273
But compared to Ricky Wade,
well, you're a novice.

935
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:35,612
Look, it's nothing personal, it's just
that, well, there's a lot at stake, and...

936
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:40,116
Hey, now, be a good boy and run
along and replenish my drink.

937
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:50,044
Everything prepared?

938
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:52,587
I contacted Chuck Lewis.
We'll take care of it tonight.

939
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:53,839
Excellent.

940
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,885
And it's all centered
around the ski jump.

941
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:01,722
Are there any questions?
Anyone? Anyone?

942
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:04,140
No? Good.

943
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:10,731
I don't think any of you
could ever possibly realize

944
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:13,212
the importance of this meet that
we're going to have tomorrow.

945
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:16,820
To me, and to the future
of Lakeside.

946
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:19,239
So, all I'm asking you
is that you

947
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,158
really try to go out there
tomorrow and do the best you can.

948
01:09:23,118 --> 01:09:24,119
Please.

949
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:28,623
Let's hear it. Come on.

954
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,880
What are you doing? I thought
I told you to wear black.

955
01:09:43,889 --> 01:09:45,432
It was on sale, all right?

956
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:48,769
Come on.
Hey, how much was the hat?

957
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:51,396
Well, it was $3.95...
Forget the stupid hat.

958
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:57,111
You do that again and I'll
kill you. It was an accident.

959
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:59,988
Accident? You're an accident.
Okay, come on. Let's go.

Beat Twin Oaks.

Beat Twin Oaks.

962
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:14,544
Shut up! Okay.

963
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:16,004
I want to get back
to business here.

964
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:18,757
I want you guys to go back to
your cabins and get some sleep.

965
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:22,970
Look sharp. I'll see you first
thing in the morning. All right.

966
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:25,847
Hey, you know something? Give me
one minute, I'll be right there.

967
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:28,609
But I thought we're going to go to
the dock. No, go ahead. It's okay.

968
01:10:28,611 --> 01:10:31,011
Seriously, I'm just gonna hang
out and clean up a little bit.

969
01:10:31,038 --> 01:10:32,687
Go ahead. I'll be right there.
It's okay.

970
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,189
Okay. Yeah.

971
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:39,486
I'm really excited
about tomorrow.

972
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:41,287
I think we're going to
win, Hillary. Me, too.

973
01:10:41,314 --> 01:10:42,906
It's going to be
so great.

974
01:10:42,948 --> 01:10:45,993
Ricky asked me to straighten up the
lodge a little before we split.

975
01:10:46,034 --> 01:10:47,744
You think you can
give me a hand?

976
01:10:47,786 --> 01:10:50,080
Sure, Wes. Yeah? Great.

977
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:52,207
Guess I'll see you
in the morning, Hillary.

978
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,084
Okay. Good night, Victor.
Good night.

979
01:10:54,126 --> 01:10:57,087
You know what? Tell you what.
I'll stack the chairs, okay?

980
01:10:57,129 --> 01:10:58,569
And why don't you
take the chalkboard

981
01:10:58,611 --> 01:11:00,451
and stick it right over there
against the wall?

982
01:11:00,478 --> 01:11:01,716
How does that sound?
Sure, Wes.

983
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,051
Great, man. Great.

984
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:23,570
Oh, no!

985
01:11:26,658 --> 01:11:27,658
Oh, God!

986
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:32,288
(VICTOR CRYING)

987
01:11:38,837 --> 01:11:40,214
You all right, man?

988
01:11:40,255 --> 01:11:43,258
My arm. I think I broke it.
Oh, man.

989
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:47,804
All right.

990
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:49,097
We got to get him
to the hospital.

991
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:50,265
Turn him over.
Turn him over.

992
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,066
Help me out. Get him up.
Get him up. Come on.

993
01:11:52,093 --> 01:11:53,761
WADE: Kelly, go get the car.
Okay.

994
01:11:54,186 --> 01:11:55,395
(CRYING)

995
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:04,029
Are you proud of yourself?
What are you talking about?

996
01:12:04,071 --> 01:12:05,780
Cut the crap, Wes.

997
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:10,202
I know you and Howie set this
up purposely to hurt Victor.

998
01:12:10,244 --> 01:12:13,830
Do you think that humiliating people
makes you a big man, Wes? Huh?

999
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:17,000
No.

1000
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:18,919
You are just
like my old boyfriend.

1001
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,047
You don't give a damn
about anybody else's feelings.

1002
01:12:22,089 --> 01:12:23,798
And that makes you very small.

1003
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:26,051
Very small.

1004
01:12:31,265 --> 01:12:33,641
I get the feeling
she's pissed.

1005
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:34,851
Shut up, Howie.

1006

01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:43,443
unofficial rematch of last
weekend's Challenge Cup Ski Meet.

All right. Gather around.

This is it. Listen up. You guys lost
the last one, but now you got me.

1011
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,325
And I'm not a loser.

1012
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,661
So let's check our equipment, go
out there and kick some butt.

1013
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,080
(ALL CHEERING)

ANNOUNCER: As you may recall
Lakeside defeated Twin Oaks...

1015
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:04,464
This is it, guys.
This is very important.

1016
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:06,424
I need you all
to do your best, okay?

1017
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:08,718
We're gonna go out there and
we're gonna kick some butt.

1018
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:12,430
You don't realize how much
this tournament means to us.

1019
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:16,601
I mean, I don't think you'll ever realize
how much this tournament means to us.

1020
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:18,645
We're gonna go out there,
and we're gonna do it.

1021
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:20,688
And, also,
if you wouldn't mind,

1022
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:24,985
I'd like to dedicate this day to
our brother-in-broken-arms man,

1023
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:27,028

ANNOUNCER: Oh my! There's been an
accident involving Ricky Wade.

1044
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,443
Let's hope
he hasn't been injured.

1045
01:16:11,485 --> 01:16:12,902
This is unbelievable.

1046
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:22,078
Hey, guys. Guys. Guys.
Vic, go away.

1047

Okay. What happened?

I don't know.
The engine just died.

How are you feeling, son?

1055
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:51,024
You ever play soccer
with a bowling ball?

1056
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,942
That's about where
I'm at right now.

1057
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:55,195
Listen, we've got to get
someone to replace Ricky.

1058
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:56,904
We need every point
we can get.

Hey. Come on. Everybody
come on, gather around.

1061
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:02,410
Come on. I got an idea here.

1062
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:06,247
We're going to think for awhile and then
after that we're going to think about it.

1063

ANNOUNCER: Apparently Lakeside has entered
another skier to replace Ricky Wade.

01:17:11,169 --> 01:17:13,880
When we're done with that,
we'll think some more.

ANNOUNCER: I have no idea
who he is.

1067
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,304
Wait a minute.

1068
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:23,223
It's Neil Peterson.

1069
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:24,974
Lakeside's owner

1070
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:29,645
and the only man to successfully
complete the famed triple hinge.

01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,401
(WHOOPING)

1072

Oh, my God.

1075
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:07,683
Yeah. Yeah.
All right, Victor.

1076
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:09,769
Yeah.

1077
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:13,440
ANNOUNCER: Now, let's look to our judges
to see how they've scored Neil Peterson.

1078
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:16,109
8.7, 8.8 and 8.5.

1079
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:20,363
And that narrows
Twin Oaks' lead to 3.2 points.

1080
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:24,367
Grandpa, you handsome dog. I didn't
know you still had it in you.

1081
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:25,910
Neither did I, sweetheart.

1082
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,122
We now come
to the men's ski jump.

1083
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:30,665
And as usual,

1084
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:35,169
the outcome of the entire meet comes
down to this, the final event.

1085
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:36,712
Good going, man.

1086
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:39,715
Something must have motivated
you to get you out there, huh?

1087
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:44,011
Well, I had to do something. This camp
is all I've got. It's all Kelly's got.

1088
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,889
I know. I couldn't let
it go without a fight.

I know. I wish there was
something more that...

1090
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:52,312
Listen, don't feel bad, son. You
did everything you possibly could.

1091
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:54,063
And I mean everything.

1092
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:57,066
Be proud. It's something
I'll never forget.

1093
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:13,583
What a terrific jump for Twin Oaks.
That certainly won't hurt their score.

1094
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:16,752
Ricky, since you're injured,
who's gonna jump?

1095
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:20,965
Oh, that's easy.
That's gonna be...

1096
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:24,969
Well, it...

1097
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,769
It's your choice.
You're the man.

1098
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:36,523
I'm the man, right.

1099

Todd Christy's score of 26.3 puts
Twin Oaks ahead by 29.5 points.

Virtually nil?

find something virtually nil.

What's this?

1107
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:12,767
It looks like Ricky Wade
will be jumping for Lakeside

1108
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,436
despite an apparent
leg injury.

1109

You sure about this, Ricky?

I was born sure. Hit it.

1111

Incredible!

1116
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,864
Ricky Wade has completed
the triple hinge.

1117
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:11,867
Only the second man
to ever do it.

Now let's check
the all-important scores.

Three perfect 10s.
