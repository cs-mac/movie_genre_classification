1
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:36,562
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:38,564
Han, old buddy,
do you read me?

3
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,566
<i>Loud and clear, kid.
What's up?</i>

4
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:41,635
I finished
my circle.

5
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:43,397
I don't pick up
any life readings.

6
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:45,335
<i>There isn't enough life
on this ice cube...</i>

7
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,838
<i>to fill a space cruiser.</i>

8
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:48,738
<i>Sensors are placed.
I'm going back.</i>

9
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:50,572
Right.
I'll see you shortly.

10
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:52,543
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

11
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:55,047
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

12
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:59,052
Steady, girl.
What's the matter?

13
00:03:59,153 --> 00:04:01,144
You smell something?

14
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:02,517
Rrraaah!

15
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:43,095
Chewie!

16
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:45,563
Chewie?

17
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,928
Chewie!

18
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:51,595
All right!
Don't lose your temper.

19
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:53,867
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

20
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:15,654
Solo?

21
00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:18,027
No sign of life
out there, General.

22
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:19,429
The sensors are in place.

23
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,659
You'll know if anything
comes around.

24
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:22,326
Commander Skywalker
reported in yet?

25
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:24,631
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

26
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:26,798
With all the meteor activity
in this system...

27
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:28,603
it's going to be difficult
to spot approaching ships.

28
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:30,939
General, I got to leave.
I can't stay anymore.

29
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:32,034
I'm sorry to hear that.

30
00:05:32,146 --> 00:05:33,272
Well, there's
a price on my head.

31
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:34,780
If I don't pay off
Jabba the Hutt...

32
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:36,110
I'm a dead man.

33
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:38,310
A death mark's
not an easy thing to live with.

34
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:39,818
You're a good fighter, Solo.

35
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,912
I hate to lose you.

36
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:43,888
Thank you, General.

37
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:54,029
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

38
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:56,035
That's right.

39
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:59,573
Well, don't get
all mushy on me.

40
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:01,301
So long, Princess.

41
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:06,141
Han!

42
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:08,147
Yes, Your Highnessness?

43
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:10,274
I thought you had
decided to stay.

44
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:12,352
Well, the bounty hunter
we ran into in Ord Mantell...

45
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:13,351
changed my mind.

46
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:15,479
Han, we need you!

47
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:16,487
<i>We need?</i>

48
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,648
Yes.

49
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:18,656
<i>Well, what about
you need?</i>

50
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,817
<i>I need?</i>

51
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:22,157
I don't know what
you're talking about.

52
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:24,026
You probably don't.

53
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:25,894
And what precisely
am I supposed to know?

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,797
Come on!

55
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:30,166
You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about me.

56
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:31,932
Yes! You're
a great help to us.

57
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:32,937
You're a natural leader.

58
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,634
No! That's not it.

59
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:37,142
Come on.

60
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:38,575
A-ha!

61
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,169
You're imagining things.

62
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:42,044
Am I? Then why are
you following me?

63
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:45,050
Afraid I was gonna leave
without giving you a good-bye kiss?

64
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:46,551
I'd just as soon
kiss a Wookiee!

65
00:06:46,654 --> 00:06:48,053
I can arrange that.

66
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:50,123
You could use
a good kiss!

67
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:54,555
I didn't ask you to turn on
the thermal heater.

68
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:58,063
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

69
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:00,565
How will we
dry out her clothes?

70
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:03,227
Oh, switch off!

71
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:04,668
Why did you
take this apart now?

72
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:06,501
I'm trying to get us out of here,
and you pull both...

73
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:07,972
Excuse me, sir.

74
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:09,099
Put them
back together now!

75
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,040
Might I have a word
with you, please?

76
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:11,042
What do you want?

77
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:12,203
Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.

78
00:07:12,313 --> 00:07:13,211
She's been trying to get you
on the communicator.

79
00:07:13,314 --> 00:07:14,212
I turned it off.

80
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:16,044
I don't want
to talk to her.

81
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,084
Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.

82
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:19,083
He hasn't
come back yet.

83
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:20,084
She doesn't know
where he is.

84
00:07:20,187 --> 00:07:21,085
I don't know
where he is.

85
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:22,120
Nobody knows
where he is.

86
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:23,554
What do you mean,
nobody knows?

87
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:25,557
- Well, uh, you see...
- Deck Officer!

88
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:27,058
- Deck Officer!
- Excuse me, sir, might I...

89
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:28,128
Yes, sir?

90
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:29,560
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?

91
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:31,062
I haven't seen him.

92
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:32,598
It's possible he came through
the south entrance.

93
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,598
<i>It's possible?</i>

94
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:35,328
Why don't you
go find out?

95
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:36,460
It's getting
dark out there.

96
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,832
Yes, sir.

97
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:40,065
Excuse me, sir.
Might I inquire what's going on?

98
00:07:40,174 --> 00:07:41,368
Why not?

99
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:42,567
Impossible man.

100
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:44,075
Come along, R2,
let's find Princess Leia.

101
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:45,338
Between ourselves...

102
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:48,040
I think Master Luke is
in considerable danger.

103
00:07:57,658 --> 00:07:59,819
Sir, Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

104
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:01,019
He might have
forgotten to check in.

105
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:02,459
Not likely.
Are the speeders ready?

106
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:04,656
Uh, not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

107
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:05,891
We'll have to go out
on tauntauns.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,729
Sir, the temperature's
dropping too rapidly.

109
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:10,099
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

110
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:16,969
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

111
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:19,603
Then I'll see you
in hell. Hyah!

112
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:45,127
Rrraaah!

113
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,990
Grrrr!

114
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:55,672
Graaah!

115
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:38,880
You must
come along now, R2.

116
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:40,977
There's really
nothing more we can do.

117
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:43,420
And my joints
are freezing up.

118
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:45,822
Don't say things
like that!

119
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:47,416
Of course we'll see
Master Luke again.

120
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:49,928
And he'll be quite
all right.

121
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,928
You'll see.

122
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:52,896
Stupid little short circuit.

123
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,059
He'll be quite all right.

124
00:11:52,326 --> 00:11:54,521
Sir, all the patrols
are in.

125
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:55,595
Still no...

126
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,563
Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.

127
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:03,330
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

128
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:06,235
although he does admit
that his own range is far too weak...

129
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,671
to abandon all hope.

130
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:09,538
Your Highness, there's nothing more
we can do tonight.

131
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:11,907
The shield doors
must be closed.

132
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:14,212
Close the doors.

133
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:15,213
Yes, sir.

134
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:22,245
R2 says the chances
of survival are 725 to 1.

135
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:32,226
Gahhh!

136
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,997
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

137
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,940
from time to time.

138
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,509
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

139
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:48,447
Don't worry
about Master Luke.

140
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:49,948
I'm sure
he'll be all right.

141
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,518
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

142
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:09,533
<i>Luke.</i>

143
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:13,469
<i>Luke.</i>

144
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:22,538
Ben?

145
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,277
<i>You will go to
the Dagobah system.</i>

146
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:27,149
Dagobah system?

147
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:30,052
<i>There you will
learn from Yoda...</i>

148
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:34,617
<i>the Jedi master
who instructed me.</i>

149
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:36,593
Ben!

150
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:37,925
Ben!

151
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:43,601
Luke!

152
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:46,070
Luke!

153
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,579
Don't do this, Luke.

154
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:58,082
Come on,
give me a sign here.

155
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,169
Not much time.

156
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,503
Ben.

157
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:24,839
Ben.

158
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:30,174
Hang on, kid.

159
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:33,444
Dagobah system.

160
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:34,521
Whew!

161
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:37,556
This may smell bad, kid...

162
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:39,626
Yoda.

163
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:41,387
But it'll keep you warm...

164
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:43,759
till I get the shelter up.

165
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:46,355
Ben... Dagobah...

166
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,128
Ahhh!

167
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:53,537
Ah! I thought they
smelled bad on the outside!

168
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,874
Echo Base, I've got something.

169
00:15:38,986 --> 00:15:42,046
Not much, but it could be a life-form.

170
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:48,426
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

171
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:50,429
This is Rogue Two.

172
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:52,965
This is Rogue Two.

173
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:56,695
Captain Solo,
do you copy?

174
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:05,376
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

175
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:07,913
This is Rogue Two.

176
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:09,414
<i>Good morning.</i>

177
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:11,882
<i>Nice of you guys
to drop by.</i>

178
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:14,351
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

179
00:16:14,454 --> 00:16:15,853
I've found them.

180
00:16:15,956 --> 00:16:17,753
Repeat, I've found them.

181
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:49,352
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

182
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:50,684
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

183
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:51,689
Thanks, 3PO.

184
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:54,522
R2 expresses
his relief also.

185
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:57,392
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

186
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:58,896
You look strong enough...

187
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,899
to pull the ears
off a gundark.

188
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:02,400
Thanks to you.

189
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:05,096
That's two
you owe me, junior.

190
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:06,763
Well, Your Worship...

191
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:09,706
looks like you managed to keep me
around for a little while longer.

192
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,368
I had nothing
to do with it.

193
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:13,241
General Rieekan
thinks it's dangerous...

194
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:14,507
for any ships
to leave the system...

195
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:15,946
until we've activated
the energy field.

196
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:17,949
That's a good story.

197
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:19,245
<i>I think you just can't bear...</i>

198
00:17:19,353 --> 00:17:21,981
to let a gorgeous guy like me
out of your sight.

199
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:25,388
I don't know where you get
your delusions, laser brain.

200
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:27,153
Hah hah hah!

201
00:17:28,495 --> 00:17:30,395
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

202
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:33,898
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

203
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:36,469
She expressed her
true feelings for me.

204
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,901
My...

205
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:40,974
Why, you stuck-up,
half-witted...

206
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:43,634
scruffy-looking
nerf herder!

207
00:17:43,744 --> 00:17:46,804
Who's scruffy-looking?

208
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:50,349
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark...

209
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:51,416
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark...

210
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:53,543
to get her all riled up
like that, huh, kid?

211
00:17:57,024 --> 00:18:00,482
Well, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

212
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:08,899
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.</i>

213
00:18:11,738 --> 00:18:14,935
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.</i>

214
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:16,031
Take it easy.

215
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:18,509
Excuse us,
please.

216
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:23,542
Princess,
we have a visitor.

217
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,313
Picked up something outside
the base's Zone 12 moving east.

218
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:28,547
It's metal.

219
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:29,622
Then it couldn't be
one of those creatures.

220
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:31,384
Could be a speeder,
one of ours.

221
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:32,719
No.

222
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:33,884
Wait.

223
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:36,622
There's something
very weak coming through.

224
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:43,060
Sir, I'm fluent in six million
forms of communication.

225
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,900
This signal is not used
by the Alliance.

226
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:48,065
It could be
an imperial code.

227
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:53,308
It isn't friendly,
whatever it is.

228
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:55,313
Come on, Chewie,
let's check it out.

229
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:58,646
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

230
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:16,129
Grrr!

231
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:31,746
Gahhh!

232
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,848
<i>I'm afraid
there's not much left.</i>

233
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:35,853
What was it?

234
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:37,389
<i>Droid of some kind.</i>

235
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:39,391
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.
Must've had a self-destruct.</i>

236
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:41,256
An imperial probe droid.

237
00:19:41,361 --> 00:19:44,353
<i>It's a good bet the Empire
knows we're here.</i>

238
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:46,432
We'd better start
the evacuation.

239
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:32,607
Admiral.

240
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:34,111
Yes, Captain?

241
00:20:34,214 --> 00:20:36,409
I think we've got
something, sir.

242
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:38,575
The report
is only a fragment...

243
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,243
from a probe droid
in the Hoth system...

244
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:41,786
but it's the best lead we've had.

245
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:44,721
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

246
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:45,917
I want proof,
not leads.

247
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:47,926
The visuals indicate
life readings.

248
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:48,926
It could mean anything.

249
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:50,326
If we followed up
every lead...

250
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,761
But, sir...

251
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:53,423
the Hoth system is supposed to be
devoid of humans.

252
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:54,727
You've found something?

253
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:55,927
Yes, my lord.

254
00:20:58,371 --> 00:21:00,703
That's it.
The rebels are there.

255
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:05,267
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

256
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:06,276
It could be smugglers...

257
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:08,176
That is the system.

258
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:10,681
And I'm sure Skywalker
is with them.

259
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:13,776
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

260
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:16,082
General Veers,
prepare your men.

261
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:17,588
Admiral.

262
00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:26,624
Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders.

263
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:28,291
As soon as each transport is loaded...

264
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:30,528
evacuation control will give clearance
for immediate launch.

265
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:31,604
Right, sir.

266
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,801
All right!
That's it.

267
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,934
Try it.

268
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:42,873
Oh! Turn it off!
Turn it off!

269
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:45,144
Turn it off!

270
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:48,915
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47 s.

271
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:49,920
Forget
the heavy equipment.

272
00:21:50,023 --> 00:21:51,217
There's plenty of time...

273
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:52,916
to get the smaller modules
on the transports.

274
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:53,924
Take care, sir.

275
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:54,994
Thanks.

276
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:01,159
Chewie, take care
of yourself, O. K?

277
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:06,603
O.K., O. K!

278
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,641
Hi, kid.

279
00:22:09,743 --> 00:22:10,801
There's got to be
a reason for it.

280
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:12,276
Check it
at the other end.

281
00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:13,539
Wait a second.

282
00:22:14,714 --> 00:22:16,079
You all right?

283
00:22:16,182 --> 00:22:17,479
Yeah.

284
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,188
Be careful.

285
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:28,022
You, too.

286
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:35,933
General, there's a fleet
of Stardestroyers...

287
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:38,937
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

288
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,940
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

289
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:44,943
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

290
00:22:45,045 --> 00:22:46,512
Prepare for ground assault.

291
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:02,427
What is it, General?

292
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:04,121
My lord, the fleet has moved out
of light speed.

293
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,391
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

294
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:08,899
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

295
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:11,630
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

296
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:14,400
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

297
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:17,408
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

298
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,410
He... He felt surprise
was wiser.

299
00:23:19,512 --> 00:23:22,003
He is as clumsy
as he is stupid.

300
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:25,414
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

301
00:23:25,518 --> 00:23:26,985
Yes, my lord.

302
00:23:34,027 --> 00:23:35,585
Lord Vader.

303
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:37,925
The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to...

304
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:39,658
Aaugh!

305
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:43,429
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

306
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:44,730
Captain Piett.

307
00:23:44,838 --> 00:23:46,430
Yes, my lord?

308
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:49,531
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

309
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:52,611
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

310
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:55,943
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

311
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,448
Thank you,
Lord Vader.

312
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:02,387
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

313
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:05,253
The heavy transport ships will leave
as soon as they're loaded.

314
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:07,519
Only two fighter escorts
per ship.

315
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:10,357
The energy shield can only be opened
for a short time...

316
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:12,897
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

317
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:15,399
Two fighters against
a Stardestroyer?

318
00:24:15,502 --> 00:24:17,902
The ion cannon
will fire several shots...

319
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:19,505
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

320
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,006
To make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

321
00:24:21,107 --> 00:24:23,200
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

322
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:25,402
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

323
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:26,911
Understood?

324
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:28,412
Good luck.

325
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:30,415
O.K. Everybody
to your stations.

326
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:31,711
Let's go.

327
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:52,202
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

328
00:24:52,305 --> 00:24:53,897
Prepare to open shield.

329
00:24:59,712 --> 00:25:01,942
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

330
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:04,107
Good. Our first catch
of the day.

331
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:07,752
Stand by, ion control.

332
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:10,278
Fire.

333
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:28,604
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

334
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:32,109
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

335
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:39,816
Feeling all right, sir?

336
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,648
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

337
00:25:41,754 --> 00:25:44,814
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

338
00:25:44,924 --> 00:25:47,051
I know what you mean.

339
00:26:05,411 --> 00:26:06,537
Echo Station
Three-T-Eight.

340
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:08,375
We've spotted
imperial walkers.

341
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:10,745
<i>Imperial walkers
on the north ridge.</i>

342
00:26:33,373 --> 00:26:35,705
Echo Station Five-Seven.
We're on our way.

343
00:26:41,114 --> 00:26:43,105
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

344
00:26:43,216 --> 00:26:45,377
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

345
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:46,952
Steady, Dak.

346
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:48,918
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

347
00:26:52,692 --> 00:26:54,353
All right.
I'm coming in.

348
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:00,992
Hobbie,
you still with me?

349
00:27:22,655 --> 00:27:24,782
That armor's too strong
for blasters.

350
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:29,422
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

351
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:33,295
Go for the legs. It might be
our only chance of stopping them.

352
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:35,333
All right.
Stand by, Dak.

353
00:27:35,435 --> 00:27:38,268
Oh, Luke, we've got a malfunction
in fire control.

354
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:40,362
I'll have to cut in
the auxiliary.

355
00:27:40,473 --> 00:27:43,067
Just hang on.
Hang on, Dak.

356
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:45,303
Get ready to fire
that tow cable.

357
00:27:47,513 --> 00:27:48,480
Ah!

358
00:27:50,717 --> 00:27:51,684
Dak?

359
00:27:51,784 --> 00:27:52,808
Dak!

360
00:28:15,808 --> 00:28:18,777
Yes, Lord Vader, I've reached
the main power generators.

361
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:20,345
The shield will be down
in moments.

362
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:23,142
You may start your landing.

363
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:28,150
Rogue Three.

364
00:28:28,254 --> 00:28:29,414
Copy, Rogue Leader.

365
00:28:29,522 --> 00:28:31,387
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.

366
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:32,788
You'll have to
make this shot.

367
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:34,621
I'll cover for you.

368
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:38,185
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

369
00:28:38,298 --> 00:28:40,232
Coming around,
Rogue Leader.

370
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:45,468
Steady, Rogue Two.

371
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:46,629
Activate harpoon.

372
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:51,133
Good shot, Janson.

373
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,482
- One more pass.
- Coming around, Wedge.

374
00:29:05,024 --> 00:29:07,322
Cable out.
Let her go!

375
00:29:07,427 --> 00:29:09,258
Detach cable.

376
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:10,522
Cable detached.

377
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:20,032
Come on.

378
00:29:27,046 --> 00:29:28,536
Hah! That got him!

379
00:29:28,648 --> 00:29:30,445
I see it, Wedge.
Good work.

380
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,848
I don't think...

381
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:33,213
we can protect
two transports at a time.

382
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:35,378
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

383
00:29:35,488 --> 00:29:37,888
We have no choice.

384
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,888
Launch patrol.

385
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:40,856
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

386
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,450
Gahhh!

387
00:29:42,562 --> 00:29:44,996
No, no! No.

388
00:29:45,098 --> 00:29:46,998
This one goes there.

389
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,261
That one goes there, right?

390
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:53,271
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

391
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:56,805
And do take good care
of yourself.

392
00:30:00,513 --> 00:30:02,037
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

393
00:30:25,838 --> 00:30:27,999
All troops will debark
for ground assault.

394
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:30,769
Prepare to target
the main generator.

395
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:35,381
Rogue Two,
are you all right?

396
00:30:35,481 --> 00:30:37,915
Yeah. I'm with you,
Rogue Leader.

397
00:30:38,017 --> 00:30:39,848
Well, set harpoon.
I'll cover for you.

398
00:30:41,421 --> 00:30:42,786
Coming around.

399
00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:45,687
Watch that cross fire, boys.

400
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,623
Set for
position three.

401
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:49,024
Steady.

402
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:50,425
Stay tight and low.

403
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,656
This is it!

404
00:30:51,764 --> 00:30:53,026
Aah!

405
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,797
Hobbie!

406
00:30:58,905 --> 00:31:00,372
I've been hit!

407
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:43,913
You all right?

408
00:31:44,016 --> 00:31:45,950
Why are you
still here?

409
00:31:46,052 --> 00:31:47,917
Heard the command center had been hit.

410
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,918
You've got
your clearance to leave.

411
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:50,886
Don't worry. I'll leave.

412
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,685
First I'm gonna
get you to your ship.

413
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:54,419
Your Highness,
we must take this last transport.

414
00:31:54,527 --> 00:31:55,425
It's our only hope.

415
00:31:55,528 --> 00:31:56,654
Send all troops
in Sector 12...

416
00:31:56,762 --> 00:31:58,889
to the south slope
to protect the fighters.

417
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:02,501
<i>Imperial troops
have entered the base.</i>

418
00:32:02,602 --> 00:32:03,967
<i>Imperial troops
have entered...</i>

419
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,594
Come on.
That's it.

420
00:32:05,705 --> 00:32:08,265
Give the evacuation
code signal.

421
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,041
And get to your transports!

422
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:14,044
Oh! Wait for me!

423
00:32:14,146 --> 00:32:16,580
Begin retreat!

424
00:32:16,682 --> 00:32:17,649
Fall back!

425
00:33:16,275 --> 00:33:18,140
Distance to power generators?

426
00:33:18,244 --> 00:33:19,575
<i>17.28.</i>

427
00:33:28,688 --> 00:33:30,622
Target.
Maximum firepower.

428
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:58,341
Transport, this is Solo.

429
00:33:58,451 --> 00:33:59,577
Better take off.
I can't get to you.

430
00:33:59,685 --> 00:34:00,583
<i>I'll get her out
on the Falcon.</i>

431
00:34:00,686 --> 00:34:01,618
Come on.

432
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:05,115
B-B-But where are
you going?

433
00:34:05,224 --> 00:34:06,282
Come back!

434
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:25,103
Wait!

435
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:27,111
Wait for me!
Wait! Stop!

436
00:34:27,213 --> 00:34:28,612
How typical.

437
00:34:28,714 --> 00:34:30,147
Come on.

438
00:34:30,249 --> 00:34:32,012
Gahhh!

439
00:34:33,753 --> 00:34:34,981
Hurry up, goldenrod.

440
00:34:35,087 --> 00:34:37,351
You're gonna be
a permanent resident.

441
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:38,855
Wait! Wait!

442
00:34:56,776 --> 00:34:57,800
How's this?

443
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,935
Would it help
if I got out and pushed?

444
00:35:00,046 --> 00:35:01,274
Captain Solo!
Captain Solo!

445
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,278
It might.

446
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:06,245
Sir, might I suggest
that you...

447
00:35:06,352 --> 00:35:08,047
It can wait.

448
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:14,522
This bucket of bolts is never gonna
get us past that blockade.

449
00:35:14,627 --> 00:35:16,959
This baby's got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart.

450
00:35:25,337 --> 00:35:27,498
Come on! Come on!

451
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:30,200
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

452
00:35:32,845 --> 00:35:33,743
See?

453
00:35:33,846 --> 00:35:34,744
Someday you're
gonna be wrong...

454
00:35:34,847 --> 00:35:36,144
and I just hope
I'm there to see it.

455
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:40,144
Punch it!

456
00:35:57,803 --> 00:35:59,270
R2!

457
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:02,966
Get her ready
for takeoff.

458
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:07,444
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

459
00:36:09,048 --> 00:36:11,039
Don't worry, R2.

460
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,050
We're going.
We're going.

461
00:36:25,464 --> 00:36:26,931
There's nothing wrong, R2.

462
00:36:27,032 --> 00:36:29,091
I'm just setting
a new course.

463
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:34,365
We're not gonna regroup
with the others.

464
00:36:34,473 --> 00:36:36,703
We're going
to the Dagobah system.

465
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:40,542
Yes, R2?

466
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:43,875
That's all right.

467
00:36:43,983 --> 00:36:46,451
I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

468
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:03,033
Gahhh!

469
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:04,295
I saw 'em! I saw 'em!

470
00:37:04,403 --> 00:37:05,529
Saw what?

471
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:07,833
Stardestroyers,
two of 'em coming right at us.

472
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,032
Sir! Sir!

473
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:10,039
Might I suggest...

474
00:37:10,142 --> 00:37:12,406
Shut him up
or shut him down!

475
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:14,502
Check the deflector shield.

476
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:16,513
Great.

477
00:37:16,615 --> 00:37:18,674
Well, we can still
outmaneuver them.

478
00:37:22,988 --> 00:37:24,888
Take evasive action!

479
00:37:36,502 --> 00:37:38,333
Prepare to make the jump to light speed.

480
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:39,335
But, sir!

481
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:42,032
They're getting closer.

482
00:37:42,141 --> 00:37:44,268
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

483
00:37:47,379 --> 00:37:48,573
Watch what?

484
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:51,607
I think we're
in trouble.

485
00:37:51,717 --> 00:37:53,651
If I may say so, sir,
I noticed earlier...

486
00:37:53,752 --> 00:37:55,379
the hyperdrive motivator
has been damaged.

487
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:57,250
It's impossible to go
to light speed.

488
00:37:57,356 --> 00:37:59,916
We're in trouble.

489
00:38:03,162 --> 00:38:04,424
Horizontal boosters!

490
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,464
Gahhh!

491
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:08,624
Alluvial dampers.

492
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:10,395
Ow!

493
00:38:10,502 --> 00:38:12,436
That's not it.

494
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:14,096
Bring me
the hydrospanner!

495
00:38:16,075 --> 00:38:19,476
I don't know how we're gonna
get out of this one.

496
00:38:21,814 --> 00:38:23,042
Ow!

497
00:38:23,148 --> 00:38:24,240
Chewie!

498
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,944
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

499
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:31,488
Han, get up here!

500
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:34,659
Come on, Chewie!

501
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:36,488
Asteroids.

502
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:40,031
Oh, no.

503
00:38:40,132 --> 00:38:41,531
Chewie,
set two-seven-one.

504
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:43,067
What are you doing?

505
00:38:43,168 --> 00:38:46,763
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

506
00:38:46,872 --> 00:38:49,705
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

507
00:38:51,844 --> 00:38:53,778
You don't have to do this
to impress me.

508
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:56,439
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

509
00:38:56,548 --> 00:38:58,641
is approximately 3,720 to 1.

510
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:00,446
Never tell me the odds!

511
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:24,370
Look out!

512
00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:30,380
You said you wanted to be around
when I made a mistake.

513
00:39:30,482 --> 00:39:32,313
This could be it,
sweetheart.

514
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:33,316
I take it back.

515
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:34,977
We're going
to get pulverized...

516
00:39:35,087 --> 00:39:36,418
if we stay out here
much longer.

517
00:39:36,522 --> 00:39:37,716
Ain't gonna argue with that.

518
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:40,383
I'm going in closer
to one of the big ones.

519
00:39:40,492 --> 00:39:41,356
Closer?!

520
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,358
Closer?!

521
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:43,519
Gahhh!

522
00:40:09,455 --> 00:40:11,355
Oh, this is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

523
00:40:11,457 --> 00:40:13,425
There. That looks
pretty good.

524
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:15,686
What looks pretty good?

525
00:40:15,794 --> 00:40:17,694
Yeah,
that'll do nicely.

526
00:40:17,796 --> 00:40:20,890
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

527
00:40:30,843 --> 00:40:33,403
I hope you know
what you're doing.

528
00:40:33,512 --> 00:40:34,604
Yeah. Me, too.

529
00:40:43,288 --> 00:40:45,688
Yep, that's it.
Dagobah.

530
00:40:48,127 --> 00:40:50,357
No, I'm not gonna change
my mind about this.

531
00:40:50,462 --> 00:40:53,761
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.

532
00:40:53,866 --> 00:40:56,426
Massive life-form
readings, though.

533
00:40:56,535 --> 00:40:59,060
There's something alive
down there.

534
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:03,607
Yes. I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.

535
00:41:10,182 --> 00:41:12,150
I know! I know!

536
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:15,743
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

537
00:41:15,854 --> 00:41:17,116
Just hang on.

538
00:41:17,222 --> 00:41:18,985
I'm gonna start
the landing cycle.

539
00:42:12,744 --> 00:42:13,836
No, R2, you stay put.

540
00:42:13,946 --> 00:42:15,675
I'll have a look around.

541
00:42:20,152 --> 00:42:22,416
R2?

542
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:23,419
R2!

543
00:42:25,457 --> 00:42:26,446
Where are you?

544
00:42:29,962 --> 00:42:31,429
R2!

545
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,869
You be more careful.

546
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:45,708
R2, that way.

547
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:15,104
R2!

548
00:43:29,755 --> 00:43:31,347
<i>Beeep!</i>

549
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:44,199
Oh, no.

550
00:43:44,303 --> 00:43:46,203
Are you all right?

551
00:43:46,305 --> 00:43:47,704
Come on.

552
00:43:50,943 --> 00:43:53,138
You were lucky
to get out of there.

553
00:43:53,245 --> 00:43:55,270
Anything broken?

554
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:01,647
If you're saying
coming here was a bad idea...

555
00:44:01,753 --> 00:44:03,152
I'm beginning
to agree with you.

556
00:44:04,856 --> 00:44:06,983
R2, what are
we doing here?

557
00:44:07,092 --> 00:44:12,587
It's like... something
out of a dream or...

558
00:44:12,698 --> 00:44:14,290
I don't know.

559
00:44:14,399 --> 00:44:16,765
Maybe I'm
just going crazy.

560
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:49,994
Yes, Admiral?

561
00:44:50,102 --> 00:44:52,900
<i>Our ships have sighted
the Millennium Falcon, lord...</i>

562
00:44:53,005 --> 00:44:56,099
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

563
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:58,335
Asteroids do not
concern me, Admiral.

564
00:44:58,443 --> 00:45:01,640
I want that ship,
not excuses.

565
00:45:01,747 --> 00:45:03,806
Yes, lord.

566
00:45:07,786 --> 00:45:09,777
I'm gonna shut down
everything...

567
00:45:09,888 --> 00:45:11,753
but the emergency
power systems.

568
00:45:11,857 --> 00:45:15,884
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,
but does that include shutting me down, too?

569
00:45:15,994 --> 00:45:18,292
<i>No. I need you to talk
to the Falcon.</i>

570
00:45:18,397 --> 00:45:21,457
Find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

571
00:45:28,173 --> 00:45:31,574
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

572
00:45:31,677 --> 00:45:34,009
Not entirely stable?

573
00:45:34,112 --> 00:45:35,773
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

574
00:45:35,881 --> 00:45:37,610
Chewie, take the professor
in the back...

575
00:45:37,716 --> 00:45:39,308
and plug him into
the hyperdrive.

576
00:45:39,418 --> 00:45:42,319
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behavior.

577
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:44,787
After all, I'm only
trying to do my job.

578
00:45:49,628 --> 00:45:50,993
- Let go.
- Shh!

579
00:45:52,864 --> 00:45:54,092
Let go, please.

580
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:55,496
Don't get excited.

581
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,033
Captain, being held by you...

582
00:45:57,135 --> 00:45:59,365
isn't quite enough
to get me excited.

583
00:45:59,471 --> 00:46:00,870
Sorry, sweetheart.

584
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:03,770
I haven't got time
for anything else.

585
00:46:38,443 --> 00:46:40,206
Ready for
some power?

586
00:46:40,312 --> 00:46:41,973
O.K.

587
00:46:45,317 --> 00:46:46,716
Let's see now.

588
00:46:46,818 --> 00:46:48,615
Put that in there.

589
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,812
There you go.

590
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:55,551
Now all I gotta do
is find this Yoda...

591
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,127
if he even exists.

592
00:47:03,335 --> 00:47:07,431
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

593
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:09,837
This place
gives me the creeps.

594
00:47:13,478 --> 00:47:16,538
Still...

595
00:47:16,648 --> 00:47:18,479
there's something familiar
about this place.

596
00:47:20,685 --> 00:47:22,118
I don't know.

597
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,346
I feel like...

598
00:47:23,455 --> 00:47:25,650
Feel like what?

599
00:47:25,757 --> 00:47:27,384
Like we're
being watched!

600
00:47:27,492 --> 00:47:29,289
Away put your weapon!

601
00:47:29,394 --> 00:47:31,419
I mean you no harm.

602
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:34,431
I am wondering...
why are you here?

603
00:47:34,533 --> 00:47:37,525
I'm looking
for someone.

604
00:47:37,636 --> 00:47:39,035
Looking?

605
00:47:39,137 --> 00:47:41,901
Found someone you have,
I would say, hmmm?

606
00:47:42,007 --> 00:47:44,669
Right.

607
00:47:44,776 --> 00:47:48,007
Help you I can.
Yes, mmmm.

608
00:47:48,113 --> 00:47:50,081
I don't think so.

609
00:47:50,182 --> 00:47:53,083
I'm looking
for a great warrior.

610
00:47:53,185 --> 00:47:54,413
Ah!

611
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:56,350
A great warrior.

612
00:47:56,455 --> 00:47:58,855
Ha ha ha!

613
00:47:58,957 --> 00:48:01,323
Wars not
make one great.

614
00:48:09,267 --> 00:48:11,064
Put that down.

615
00:48:11,169 --> 00:48:13,637
Hey! That's my dinner!

616
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:19,673
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

617
00:48:19,778 --> 00:48:22,338
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

618
00:48:22,447 --> 00:48:23,641
And if we could get
our ship out, we would.

619
00:48:23,748 --> 00:48:24,806
But we can't,
so why don't you...

620
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:26,816
Cannot get your ship out.
Hee hee hee!

621
00:48:26,918 --> 00:48:28,249
Hey, get out of there!

622
00:48:28,353 --> 00:48:29,684
Ah!

623
00:48:29,788 --> 00:48:31,813
No! Ooh!

624
00:48:31,923 --> 00:48:34,255
Hey, you could
have broken this.

625
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:36,486
Don't do that.

626
00:48:38,296 --> 00:48:39,820
Oh!

627
00:48:46,805 --> 00:48:48,773
You're making a mess.

628
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:52,606
Hey, give me that!

629
00:48:52,711 --> 00:48:55,271
Mine, or I will
help you not.

630
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,177
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

631
00:48:57,282 --> 00:48:59,307
I'm gonna need it
to get out of this slimy mudhole.

632
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:00,816
Mudhole? Slimy?

633
00:49:00,919 --> 00:49:03,547
My home this is...

634
00:49:03,655 --> 00:49:06,123
Wha... Mmm!

635
00:49:06,224 --> 00:49:07,816
R2, let him have it.

636
00:49:09,794 --> 00:49:12,160
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

637
00:49:12,264 --> 00:49:13,322
R2!

638
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,998
Now, will you move along,
little fellow?

639
00:49:18,103 --> 00:49:19,764
We've got a lot
of work to do.

640
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,338
No! No, no!

641
00:49:21,439 --> 00:49:24,840
Stay and help you I will...
find your friend.

642
00:49:24,943 --> 00:49:27,241
I'm not looking
for a friend.

643
00:49:27,345 --> 00:49:28,607
I'm looking
for a Jedi master.

644
00:49:28,713 --> 00:49:32,979
Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.

645
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:34,551
You seek Yoda.

646
00:49:34,653 --> 00:49:35,813
You know him?

647
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:39,322
Mmmm.
Take you to him I will.

648
00:49:39,424 --> 00:49:44,020
Yes, yes, but now
we must eat. Come.

649
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:45,756
Good food.

650
00:49:45,864 --> 00:49:47,229
Come.

651
00:49:56,374 --> 00:49:58,239
Come, come.

652
00:49:59,611 --> 00:50:04,412
R2... stay and watch
after the camp.

653
00:50:17,495 --> 00:50:20,157
Oh! Where is R2
when I need him?

654
00:50:20,265 --> 00:50:23,325
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

655
00:50:23,435 --> 00:50:25,096
but it has the most
peculiar dialect.

656
00:50:25,203 --> 00:50:27,228
I believe, sir, it says
that the power coupling...

657
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:28,738
on the negative axis
has been polarized.

658
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,331
I'm afraid you'll have
to replace it.

659
00:50:31,443 --> 00:50:34,674
Well, of course I'll
have to replace it.

660
00:50:34,779 --> 00:50:36,269
Here!

661
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:38,110
And, Chewie...

662
00:50:39,851 --> 00:50:42,445
I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

663
00:51:03,575 --> 00:51:07,511
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

664
00:51:07,612 --> 00:51:09,944
Would you please
stop calling me that?

665
00:51:10,048 --> 00:51:12,141
Sure, Leia.

666
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,275
You make it
so difficult sometimes.

667
00:51:14,386 --> 00:51:16,320
I do. I really do.

668
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:19,322
You could be a little nicer, though.

669
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:22,291
Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

670
00:51:23,895 --> 00:51:26,295
Occasionally... maybe...

671
00:51:26,398 --> 00:51:28,958
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

672
00:51:29,067 --> 00:51:30,830
Scoundrel?

673
00:51:30,935 --> 00:51:32,425
Scoundrel?

674
00:51:34,773 --> 00:51:37,298
I like the sound
of that.

675
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:38,273
Stop that.

676
00:51:38,376 --> 00:51:40,105
Stop what?

677
00:51:40,211 --> 00:51:42,270
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

678
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,780
My hands are dirty, too.
What are you afraid of?

679
00:51:44,883 --> 00:51:46,043
Afraid?

680
00:51:46,151 --> 00:51:48,051
You're trembling.

681
00:51:48,153 --> 00:51:49,814
I'm not trembling.

682
00:51:49,921 --> 00:51:54,085
You like me because
I'm a scoundrel.

683
00:51:54,192 --> 00:51:56,217
There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.

684
00:51:56,327 --> 00:51:58,818
I happen to like nice men.

685
00:51:58,930 --> 00:51:59,897
I'm a nice man.

686
00:51:59,998 --> 00:52:01,693
No, you're not. You're...

687
00:52:04,335 --> 00:52:05,427
Sir, sir!

688
00:52:05,537 --> 00:52:08,199
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

689
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:11,670
Thank you.

690
00:52:11,776 --> 00:52:13,141
Thank you very much.

691
00:52:13,244 --> 00:52:14,973
Oh, you're perfectly
welcome, sir.

692
00:52:21,052 --> 00:52:24,283
And that was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.

693
00:52:24,389 --> 00:52:25,913
Considering the amount of
damage we've sustained...

694
00:52:26,024 --> 00:52:27,218
they must have been
destroyed.

695
00:52:27,325 --> 00:52:30,021
No, Captain.
They're alive.

696
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:32,062
I want every ship
available...

697
00:52:32,163 --> 00:52:33,721
to sweep
the asteroid field...

698
00:52:33,832 --> 00:52:35,129
until they are found.

699
00:52:39,137 --> 00:52:40,434
Lord Vader.

700
00:52:40,538 --> 00:52:42,438
Yes, Admiral.
What is it?

701
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,939
The emperor
commands you...

702
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:45,441
to make contact
with him.

703
00:52:45,543 --> 00:52:47,374
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

704
00:52:47,479 --> 00:52:50,380
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

705
00:52:50,482 --> 00:52:51,949
Yes, my lord.

706
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:10,893
What is thy bidding,
my master?

707
00:53:12,137 --> 00:53:14,697
There is a great
disturbance...

708
00:53:14,806 --> 00:53:17,070
in the Force.

709
00:53:17,175 --> 00:53:19,507
I have felt it.

710
00:53:19,611 --> 00:53:22,102
We have
a new enemy...

711
00:53:22,213 --> 00:53:26,240
the young rebel
who destroyed the Death Star.

712
00:53:26,351 --> 00:53:29,684
I have no doubt
this boy...

713
00:53:29,788 --> 00:53:34,020
is the offspring
of Anakin Skywalker.

714
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:36,389
How is that possible?

715
00:53:36,494 --> 00:53:39,986
Search your feelings,
Lord Vader.

716
00:53:40,098 --> 00:53:43,226
You will know it
to be true.

717
00:53:43,334 --> 00:53:45,802
He could destroy us.

718
00:53:45,904 --> 00:53:48,099
He's just a boy.

719
00:53:48,206 --> 00:53:50,606
Obi-Wan can no longer
help him.

720
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:54,371
The Force
is strong with him.

721
00:53:55,713 --> 00:53:57,738
The son of Skywalker...

722
00:53:57,849 --> 00:54:00,613
must not become a Jedi.

723
00:54:00,718 --> 00:54:02,948
If he could be turned...

724
00:54:03,054 --> 00:54:05,887
he would become
a powerful ally.

725
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,550
Yes.

726
00:54:09,661 --> 00:54:13,757
He would be
a great asset.

727
00:54:13,865 --> 00:54:16,231
Can it be done?

728
00:54:16,334 --> 00:54:20,236
He will join us
or die, master.

729
00:54:36,855 --> 00:54:38,186
Look,
I'm sure it's delicious.

730
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:41,190
I just don't understand
why we can't see Yoda now.

731
00:54:41,292 --> 00:54:42,190
Patience!

732
00:54:42,293 --> 00:54:43,692
For the Jedi...

733
00:54:43,795 --> 00:54:45,592
it is time
to eat as well.

734
00:54:45,697 --> 00:54:47,597
Hmm? Heh heh.

735
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:50,862
Eat, eat.

736
00:54:50,969 --> 00:54:52,027
Hot!

737
00:54:59,711 --> 00:55:01,736
Good food!
Mmm, good, hmm?

738
00:55:01,846 --> 00:55:04,906
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

739
00:55:05,016 --> 00:55:06,711
Not far.
Yoda not far.

740
00:55:06,818 --> 00:55:10,015
Patience. Soon you
will be with him.

741
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,082
Root leaf.

742
00:55:14,192 --> 00:55:15,557
I cook.

743
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:20,063
Why wish you
become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?

744
00:55:20,164 --> 00:55:22,291
Mostly because of
my father, I guess.

745
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,628
Ah, father.

746
00:55:23,735 --> 00:55:26,135
Powerful Jedi was he.

747
00:55:26,237 --> 00:55:28,137
Hee hee.
Mmm, powerful Jedi.

748
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:29,900
Oh, come on.

749
00:55:30,008 --> 00:55:31,475
How could you
know my father?

750
00:55:31,576 --> 00:55:33,305
You don't
even know who I am.

751
00:55:33,411 --> 00:55:35,311
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

752
00:55:35,413 --> 00:55:37,176
We're wasting our time!

753
00:55:38,283 --> 00:55:40,114
I cannot teach him.

754
00:55:40,218 --> 00:55:42,618
The boy
has no patience.

755
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,348
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

756
00:55:45,456 --> 00:55:46,514
Hmm...

757
00:55:50,128 --> 00:55:52,596
Much anger in him...

758
00:55:52,697 --> 00:55:54,597
like his father.

759
00:55:54,699 --> 00:55:58,430
<i>Was I any different
when you taught me?</i>

760
00:55:59,837 --> 00:56:01,600
No.

761
00:56:01,706 --> 00:56:03,571
He is not ready.

762
00:56:03,675 --> 00:56:04,937
Yoda.

763
00:56:07,178 --> 00:56:08,543
I am ready.

764
00:56:08,646 --> 00:56:10,910
Ben...
I can be a Jedi.

765
00:56:11,015 --> 00:56:12,949
Ben, tell him I'm...

766
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:14,450
Ready, are you?

767
00:56:14,552 --> 00:56:16,850
What know you ready?

768
00:56:16,955 --> 00:56:20,322
For 800 years
have I trained Jedi.

769
00:56:20,425 --> 00:56:22,950
My own counsel will I keep...

770
00:56:23,061 --> 00:56:25,894
on who is to be trained.

771
00:56:25,997 --> 00:56:30,627
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment, hmm?

772
00:56:30,735 --> 00:56:32,600
The most serious mind.

773
00:56:34,372 --> 00:56:38,433
This one a long time
have I watched.

774
00:56:38,543 --> 00:56:41,535
All his life
has he looked away...

775
00:56:41,646 --> 00:56:44,706
to the future,
to the horizon.

776
00:56:44,816 --> 00:56:48,377
Never his mind
on where he was...

777
00:56:48,486 --> 00:56:49,578
hmm?

778
00:56:49,687 --> 00:56:51,621
What he was doing.

779
00:56:51,723 --> 00:56:53,281
Hmph!

780
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:54,449
Adventure.

781
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:55,617
Ha!

782
00:56:55,727 --> 00:56:57,126
Excitement. Ha!

783
00:56:57,228 --> 00:56:59,822
A Jedi craves
not these things.

784
00:56:59,931 --> 00:57:02,593
You are reckless!

785
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,669
<i>So was I,
if you remember.</i>

786
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,671
He is too old.

787
00:57:08,773 --> 00:57:11,469
Yes, too old to
begin the training.

788
00:57:11,576 --> 00:57:14,067
But I've learned so much.

789
00:57:17,715 --> 00:57:18,943
Ahh...

790
00:57:20,518 --> 00:57:23,419
Will he finish
what he begins?

791
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:25,148
I won't fail you.

792
00:57:26,691 --> 00:57:28,352
I'm not afraid.

793
00:57:29,927 --> 00:57:31,121
Oh...

794
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:34,630
You will be.

795
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:38,126
You will be.

796
00:58:18,803 --> 00:58:20,065
Aah!

797
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:22,105
Sir, if I may venture
an opinion...

798
00:58:22,206 --> 00:58:24,174
I'm not really interested
in your opinion.

799
00:58:24,275 --> 00:58:25,572
There's something
out there.

800
00:58:25,676 --> 00:58:26,836
Where?

801
00:58:26,944 --> 00:58:27,911
Outside in the cave.

802
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:30,979
There it is.
Listen. Listen!

803
00:58:31,082 --> 00:58:32,071
I'm going out there.

804
00:58:32,183 --> 00:58:33,150
Are you crazy?

805
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:34,616
I just got this bucket
back together.

806
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,812
I'm not going to let
something tear it apart.

807
00:58:36,921 --> 00:58:38,616
Then I'm going
with you.

808
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,315
I think it might
be better...

809
00:58:40,424 --> 00:58:42,517
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

810
00:58:42,627 --> 00:58:43,525
Oh, no.

811
00:58:57,508 --> 00:59:00,739
This ground
sure feels strange.

812
00:59:00,845 --> 00:59:03,313
It doesn't
feel like rock.

813
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:10,243
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

814
00:59:10,354 --> 00:59:12,151
I don't know.

815
00:59:12,256 --> 00:59:15,248
I have a bad feeling
about this.

816
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,485
Yeah.

817
00:59:18,162 --> 00:59:19,094
Watch out!

818
00:59:20,331 --> 00:59:21,593
It's all right.

819
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:22,723
It's all right.

820
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:24,733
Yeah, that's what
I thought... mynock.

821
00:59:24,835 --> 00:59:26,598
Chewie, check the rest
of the ship...

822
00:59:26,704 --> 00:59:29,036
and make sure there are
no more attached...

823
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,370
chewing
on the power cables.

824
00:59:31,475 --> 00:59:32,737
Mynocks.

825
00:59:32,843 --> 00:59:35,073
Go on inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

826
00:59:39,584 --> 00:59:41,313
Han!

827
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,616
Aagghh! Go away, go away,
beastly thing!

828
00:59:45,723 --> 00:59:46,712
Shoo! Shoo!

829
00:59:53,598 --> 00:59:55,498
Wait a minute...

830
01:00:17,288 --> 01:00:18,585
Let's get out of here!

831
01:00:18,689 --> 01:00:20,850
The Empire is still out there!
I don't think...

832
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:23,153
No time to discuss this
in committee!

833
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,251
I'm not a committee!

834
01:00:31,268 --> 01:00:34,169
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

835
01:00:34,271 --> 01:00:36,933
Sit down, sweetheart!
We're taking off!

836
01:00:40,745 --> 01:00:41,712
Look!

837
01:00:41,812 --> 01:00:43,109
I see it.
I see it.

838
01:00:43,214 --> 01:00:44,181
We're doomed!

839
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:45,612
The cave is collapsing.

840
01:00:45,716 --> 01:00:47,616
- This is no cave.
- What?

841
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,279
Run!

842
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:26,225
Yes! A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

843
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:28,957
But beware
of the dark side.

844
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:30,726
Anger, fear,
aggression...

845
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:33,893
The dark side of
the Force are they...

846
01:01:34,003 --> 01:01:36,972
easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

847
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:39,803
If once you start down
the dark path...

848
01:01:39,909 --> 01:01:41,968
forever will it dominate
your destiny.

849
01:01:42,078 --> 01:01:43,477
Consume you it will...

850
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:45,376
as it did Obi-Wan's
apprentice.

851
01:01:45,481 --> 01:01:46,880
Vader.

852
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:49,178
Is the dark side
stronger?

853
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:50,718
No, no.

854
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,185
No.

855
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:54,688
Quicker, easier,
more seductive.

856
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:57,657
How do I know the good side
from the bad?

857
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,991
You will know
when you are calm...

858
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:02,997
at peace...

859
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:04,726
passive.

860
01:02:04,834 --> 01:02:08,065
A Jedi
uses the Force...

861
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:09,865
for knowledge
and defense...

862
01:02:09,972 --> 01:02:12,099
never for attack.

863
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:13,197
But tell me why
I can't...

864
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:15,402
No, no.
There is no why.

865
01:02:15,511 --> 01:02:18,241
Nothing more will I
teach you today.

866
01:02:18,347 --> 01:02:20,838
Clear your mind
of questions.

867
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:24,681
Hmm...

868
01:02:24,787 --> 01:02:26,379
Mmm...

869
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:45,332
There's something
not right here.

870
01:02:49,011 --> 01:02:51,206
I feel cold...

871
01:02:51,314 --> 01:02:52,440
death.

872
01:02:52,548 --> 01:02:54,607
That place...

873
01:02:54,717 --> 01:02:57,914
is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

874
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,284
A domain of evil it is.

875
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:03,656
In you must go.

876
01:03:03,759 --> 01:03:06,091
What's in there?

877
01:03:08,097 --> 01:03:10,088
Only what
you take with you.

878
01:03:14,503 --> 01:03:16,130
Your weapons...

879
01:03:16,238 --> 01:03:18,468
you will not need them.

880
01:05:46,956 --> 01:05:47,980
Hmph...

881
01:05:58,067 --> 01:05:58,965
Bounty hunters.

882
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:00,467
We don't need
their scum.

883
01:06:00,569 --> 01:06:01,968
Yes, sir.

884
01:06:02,071 --> 01:06:04,062
Those rebels
won't escape us.

885
01:06:09,745 --> 01:06:12,179
Sir, we have
a priority signal...

886
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:14,112
<i>from the
Stardestroyer Avenger.</i>

887
01:06:14,216 --> 01:06:17,185
There will be
a substantial reward...

888
01:06:17,286 --> 01:06:19,186
for the one
who finds...

889
01:06:19,288 --> 01:06:21,188
<i>the Millennium Falcon.</i>

890
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:23,815
You are free to use
any methods necessary...

891
01:06:23,926 --> 01:06:26,087
but I want them alive.

892
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:28,629
No disintegrations.

893
01:06:28,731 --> 01:06:30,596
As you wish.

894
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:31,927
Lord Vader.

895
01:06:32,034 --> 01:06:34,696
My lord,
we have them.

896
01:06:39,241 --> 01:06:41,004
Oh, thank goodness
we're coming out of...

897
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,338
the asteroid field.

898
01:06:46,048 --> 01:06:47,879
Let's get out of here.

899
01:06:47,983 --> 01:06:49,450
Ready for light speed?

900
01:06:49,552 --> 01:06:50,780
1...

901
01:06:50,886 --> 01:06:52,513
2...

902
01:06:52,621 --> 01:06:53,781
3!

903
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:01,159
It's not fair.

904
01:07:01,263 --> 01:07:02,662
Gahhh!

905
01:07:02,765 --> 01:07:04,790
Transfer circuits
aren't working.

906
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,027
It's not my fault!

907
01:07:07,136 --> 01:07:08,125
No light speed?

908
01:07:08,237 --> 01:07:10,068
It's not my fault.

909
01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:16,869
Sir, we've just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

910
01:07:16,979 --> 01:07:19,243
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

911
01:07:19,348 --> 01:07:21,077
Turn her around.

912
01:07:21,183 --> 01:07:23,413
I'm going to put all power
in the front shield.

913
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,816
You're going to
attack them?

914
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,014
Sir, the odds of surviving
a direct assault on an imperial...

915
01:07:28,123 --> 01:07:30,057
- Shut up!
- Gaahh!

916
01:07:36,532 --> 01:07:38,523
They're moving to
attack position.

917
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:41,829
Shields up.

918
01:07:46,542 --> 01:07:47,941
Track them.

919
01:07:48,043 --> 01:07:50,102
They may come around
for another pass.

920
01:07:50,212 --> 01:07:52,612
Captain Needa, the ship
no longer appears on our scopes.

921
01:07:52,715 --> 01:07:54,615
They can't
have disappeared.

922
01:07:54,717 --> 01:07:57,242
No ship that small
has a cloaking device.

923
01:07:57,353 --> 01:07:59,218
Well, there's no trace
of them, sir.

924
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:01,221
Captain, Lord Vader demands
an update on the pursuit.

925
01:08:03,759 --> 01:08:05,454
Get a shuttle ready.

926
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:08,155
I shall assume full responsibility
for losing them...

927
01:08:08,264 --> 01:08:09,891
and apologize
to Lord Vader.

928
01:08:09,999 --> 01:08:11,899
Meanwhile, continue
to scan the area.

929
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:13,525
Yes, Captain Needa.

930
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,606
Use the Force.

931
01:08:20,709 --> 01:08:21,607
Yes.

932
01:08:27,216 --> 01:08:28,911
Now, the stone...

933
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:34,513
Feel it.

934
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:48,299
Concentrate!

935
01:09:02,551 --> 01:09:06,009
Oh, no. We'll never
get it out now.

936
01:09:06,121 --> 01:09:07,850
So certain are you.

937
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,620
Always with you
it cannot be done.

938
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:18,366
Hear you nothing
that I say?

939
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:20,958
Master, moving stones around
is one thing.

940
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:22,537
This is totally
different.

941
01:09:22,638 --> 01:09:24,265
No! No different!

942
01:09:24,373 --> 01:09:26,739
Only different
in your mind.

943
01:09:26,842 --> 01:09:30,471
You must unlearn
what you have learned.

944
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:33,104
All right.
I'll give it a try.

945
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:34,944
No! Try not.

946
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,280
Do.

947
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:38,683
Or do not.

948
01:09:38,787 --> 01:09:40,721
There is no try.

949
01:10:28,303 --> 01:10:31,136
I can't.
It's too big.

950
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:34,141
Size matters not.
Look at me.

951
01:10:34,243 --> 01:10:37,576
Judge me by my size,
do you?

952
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:38,703
Hmm?

953
01:10:38,814 --> 01:10:40,213
Hmph!

954
01:10:40,315 --> 01:10:42,545
And well you should not...

955
01:10:42,651 --> 01:10:45,779
for my ally is the Force.

956
01:10:45,888 --> 01:10:48,823
And a powerful
ally it is.

957
01:10:48,924 --> 01:10:51,119
Life creates it...

958
01:10:51,226 --> 01:10:52,818
makes it grow.

959
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:57,827
Its energy surrounds us...

960
01:10:57,933 --> 01:10:59,833
and binds us.

961
01:10:59,935 --> 01:11:02,062
Luminous beings are we...

962
01:11:02,171 --> 01:11:04,105
not this crude matter.

963
01:11:04,206 --> 01:11:08,267
You must feel
the Force around you...

964
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:11,744
Here,
between you, me...

965
01:11:11,847 --> 01:11:13,007
the tree...

966
01:11:13,115 --> 01:11:14,878
the rock...

967
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:15,711
everywhere!

968
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:17,080
Yes...

969
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,554
even between the land
and the ship.

970
01:11:26,628 --> 01:11:28,596
You want the impossible.

971
01:13:03,158 --> 01:13:05,023
Mm...

972
01:13:16,171 --> 01:13:17,069
I don't...

973
01:13:17,172 --> 01:13:19,265
I don't believe it.

974
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:23,309
That is why you fail.

975
01:13:42,364 --> 01:13:46,460
Apology accepted,
Captain Needa.

976
01:13:54,142 --> 01:13:57,703
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan of the area and found nothing.

977
01:13:57,813 --> 01:13:59,474
<i>If the Millennium Falcon
went into light speed...</i>

978
01:13:59,581 --> 01:14:02,141
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy by now.

979
01:14:02,251 --> 01:14:03,149
Alert all commands.

980
01:14:03,252 --> 01:14:05,152
Calculate every
possible destination...

981
01:14:05,254 --> 01:14:08,485
along their last known
trajectory.

982
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:09,921
Yes, my lord.
We'll find them.

983
01:14:10,025 --> 01:14:11,993
Don't fail me again...

984
01:14:13,095 --> 01:14:14,187
Admiral.

985
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:17,631
Alert all commands.

986
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:19,598
Deploy the fleet.

987
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:36,881
Captain Solo,
this time you've gone too far.

988
01:14:36,985 --> 01:14:38,350
Gahhh!

989
01:14:38,453 --> 01:14:41,013
I will not be quiet.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

990
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:43,023
The fleet's beginning
to break up.

991
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:44,820
Go back and stand by
the manual release...

992
01:14:44,926 --> 01:14:47,224
for the landing claw.

993
01:14:49,598 --> 01:14:51,566
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

994
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:54,898
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

995
01:14:55,003 --> 01:14:56,903
The Empire
may be gracious enough...

996
01:14:57,005 --> 01:14:57,903
Thank you.

997
01:14:58,006 --> 01:14:59,667
What's your next move?

998
01:14:59,775 --> 01:15:01,208
If they follow standard
imperial procedure...

999
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:02,709
they'll dump their garbage...

1000
01:15:02,811 --> 01:15:04,244
before they go to
light speed...

1001
01:15:04,346 --> 01:15:05,745
and then we just
float away.

1002
01:15:05,847 --> 01:15:07,405
With the rest
of the garbage.

1003
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:08,881
Then what?

1004
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:11,714
Then we got to find a safe port
somewhere around here.

1005
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:12,718
Any ideas?

1006
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:14,254
Where are we?

1007
01:15:14,356 --> 01:15:15,755
The Anoat system.

1008
01:15:15,857 --> 01:15:17,757
There's not
much there.

1009
01:15:17,859 --> 01:15:21,727
No. Well, wait.
This is interesting.

1010
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:22,922
Lando.

1011
01:15:23,031 --> 01:15:24,430
Lando system?

1012
01:15:24,533 --> 01:15:27,434
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

1013
01:15:27,536 --> 01:15:29,936
He's a cardplayer,
gambler, scoundrel.

1014
01:15:30,038 --> 01:15:31,335
You'd like him.

1015
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,771
Thanks.

1016
01:15:32,874 --> 01:15:36,571
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

1017
01:15:36,678 --> 01:15:38,612
A mining colony?

1018
01:15:38,714 --> 01:15:41,114
Yeah, a tibanna
gas mine.

1019
01:15:41,216 --> 01:15:44,117
Lando conned
somebody out of it.

1020
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:47,017
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.

1021
01:15:47,122 --> 01:15:49,056
Can you trust him?

1022
01:15:49,157 --> 01:15:52,388
No. But he's got no
love for the Empire...

1023
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:53,893
I can tell you that.

1024
01:15:53,995 --> 01:15:56,486
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by.

1025
01:15:56,598 --> 01:15:57,587
Detach.

1026
01:16:04,339 --> 01:16:06,364
You do have your moments.

1027
01:16:06,475 --> 01:16:08,375
Not many of them...

1028
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:10,843
but you do have them.

1029
01:16:43,845 --> 01:16:46,370
Concentrate.

1030
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:49,609
Feel the Force flow.

1031
01:16:49,718 --> 01:16:51,879
Yes.

1032
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:00,418
Good.

1033
01:17:00,529 --> 01:17:01,894
Calm.

1034
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:04,158
Yes.

1035
01:17:04,299 --> 01:17:07,632
Through the Force,
things you will see.

1036
01:17:07,736 --> 01:17:11,263
Other places.
The future. The past.

1037
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:13,807
Old friends long gone.

1038
01:17:16,211 --> 01:17:17,473
Han?

1039
01:17:17,579 --> 01:17:19,843
Leia!

1040
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:24,314
Hmm...

1041
01:17:24,419 --> 01:17:25,784
Control, control.

1042
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,787
You must learn control!

1043
01:17:29,791 --> 01:17:34,091
I saw... I saw a city
in the clouds.

1044
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:35,663
Hmm...

1045
01:17:35,764 --> 01:17:38,324
Friends you have there.

1046
01:17:38,433 --> 01:17:40,424
They were in pain.

1047
01:17:40,535 --> 01:17:43,868
It is the future you see.

1048
01:17:43,972 --> 01:17:45,269
Future?

1049
01:17:53,815 --> 01:17:55,680
Will they die?

1050
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,281
Difficult to see.

1051
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:03,619
Always in motion
is the future.

1052
01:18:04,726 --> 01:18:07,524
I've got to go to them.

1053
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:11,965
Decide you must
how to serve them best.

1054
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:14,729
If you leave now,
help them you could...

1055
01:18:14,836 --> 01:18:16,804
but you would destroy all...

1056
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:20,204
for which they have
fought and suffered.

1057
01:18:33,421 --> 01:18:36,857
No, I don't have
a landing permit.

1058
01:18:36,958 --> 01:18:40,826
I'm trying to reach
Lando Calrissian.

1059
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:43,056
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!

1060
01:18:43,164 --> 01:18:44,597
<i>You will not deviate
from your present course.</i>

1061
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:46,223
Rather touchy,
aren't they?

1062
01:18:46,334 --> 01:18:47,995
I thought
you knew this person.

1063
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:50,003
Gaah!

1064
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:51,936
That was
a long time ago.

1065
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,701
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

1066
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:05,913
<i>Permission granted to land
on Platform 3-2-7.</i>

1067
01:19:06,021 --> 01:19:07,488
Thank you.

1068
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:09,489
Nothing
to worry about.

1069
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:11,218
We go way back,
Lando and me.

1070
01:19:11,326 --> 01:19:13,021
Who's worried?

1071
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:03,269
Oh. No one to meet us.

1072
01:20:03,378 --> 01:20:05,312
I don't like this.

1073
01:20:05,413 --> 01:20:07,813
Well, what
would you like?

1074
01:20:07,916 --> 01:20:10,316
<i>They did let us land.</i>

1075
01:20:10,418 --> 01:20:12,318
Look, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

1076
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,785
Trust me.

1077
01:20:18,426 --> 01:20:20,758
See? My friend.

1078
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:27,593
Keep your eyes
open, huh?

1079
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:29,602
Gahhh!

1080
01:20:29,704 --> 01:20:31,171
Hey!

1081
01:20:31,272 --> 01:20:32,967
Why, you slimy...

1082
01:20:33,074 --> 01:20:36,373
double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

1083
01:20:36,478 --> 01:20:38,969
You've got a lot of guts coming here...

1084
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,707
after what you pulled.

1085
01:20:48,623 --> 01:20:51,114
Ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha!

1086
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:54,684
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

1087
01:20:54,796 --> 01:20:57,856
Well, he seems
very friendly.

1088
01:20:57,966 --> 01:20:58,933
Yes.

1089
01:20:59,034 --> 01:21:01,059
Very friendly.

1090
01:21:01,169 --> 01:21:02,568
What are you doing here?

1091
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:04,969
Ah, repairs.
I thought you could help me out.

1092
01:21:05,073 --> 01:21:07,098
What have you done
to my ship?

1093
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:08,106
Your ship?

1094
01:21:08,209 --> 01:21:09,176
Hey, remember...

1095
01:21:09,277 --> 01:21:11,370
you lost her to me
fair and square.

1096
01:21:11,479 --> 01:21:13,640
And how you doin',
Chewbacca?

1097
01:21:13,748 --> 01:21:14,874
Gahh!

1098
01:21:14,983 --> 01:21:16,382
You still hanging around
with this loser?

1099
01:21:16,484 --> 01:21:19,146
Gahhh!

1100
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:21,586
Hello.
What have we here?

1101
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:22,987
Welcome,
I'm Lando Calrissian.

1102
01:21:23,091 --> 01:21:25,889
I'm the administrator
of this facility.

1103
01:21:25,994 --> 01:21:27,859
And who might you be?

1104
01:21:27,962 --> 01:21:29,088
Leia.

1105
01:21:29,197 --> 01:21:30,755
Welcome, Leia.

1106
01:21:33,902 --> 01:21:37,303
All right, all right,
you old smoothie.

1107
01:21:37,405 --> 01:21:40,806
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1108
01:21:40,909 --> 01:21:42,376
My facilities
are at your...

1109
01:21:42,477 --> 01:21:43,774
Well, really!

1110
01:21:43,878 --> 01:21:45,743
<i>What's wrong
with the Falcon?</i>

1111
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:47,075
Hyperdrive.

1112
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:49,082
I'll get my people
to work on her.

1113
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:50,845
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

1114
01:21:50,952 --> 01:21:53,853
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

1115
01:21:53,955 --> 01:21:57,083
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

1116
01:21:57,192 --> 01:21:58,557
Not as well as I'd like.

1117
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:00,821
We're a small outpost
and not very self-sufficient.

1118
01:22:00,929 --> 01:22:02,328
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

1119
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:03,829
I've had labor difficulties.

1120
01:22:03,932 --> 01:22:05,559
Ha ha ha!

1121
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:07,225
What's so funny?

1122
01:22:07,335 --> 01:22:08,825
You. Listen to you.

1123
01:22:08,937 --> 01:22:10,962
You sound like
a businessman...

1124
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,471
a responsible leader.

1125
01:22:12,574 --> 01:22:14,769
Who'd have
thought that, huh?

1126
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:17,436
Seeing you brings back
a few things.

1127
01:22:17,545 --> 01:22:18,603
Yeah.

1128
01:22:18,713 --> 01:22:20,476
Yeah, I'm responsible
these days.

1129
01:22:20,582 --> 01:22:22,573
It's the price you pay...

1130
01:22:22,684 --> 01:22:24,584
for being successful.

1131
01:22:26,888 --> 01:22:29,356
Ooh. Nice to see
a familiar face.

1132
01:22:29,457 --> 01:22:30,856
<i>E chu ta!</i>

1133
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:32,358
How rude!

1134
01:22:33,962 --> 01:22:35,862
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

1135
01:22:35,964 --> 01:22:37,431
I wonder if... Hello?

1136
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,599
How interesting.

1137
01:22:40,702 --> 01:22:42,294
Who are you?

1138
01:22:42,403 --> 01:22:43,802
Oh, my! I...
I'm terribly sorry.

1139
01:22:43,905 --> 01:22:45,395
I didn't mean
to intrude.

1140
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:46,599
No, please don't get up.

1141
01:22:53,081 --> 01:22:54,514
Gahhh.

1142
01:23:05,059 --> 01:23:07,653
Luke, you must complete
the training.

1143
01:23:07,762 --> 01:23:09,423
I can't keep the vision
out of my head.

1144
01:23:09,531 --> 01:23:11,522
They're my friends.
I got to help them.

1145
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:13,794
You must not go.

1146
01:23:13,902 --> 01:23:16,996
But Han and Leia will die
if I don't.

1147
01:23:17,138 --> 01:23:18,662
<i>You don't know that.</i>

1148
01:23:18,773 --> 01:23:21,640
<i>Even Yoda cannot
see their fate.</i>

1149
01:23:21,743 --> 01:23:23,870
But I can help them.

1150
01:23:23,978 --> 01:23:25,468
I feel the Force.

1151
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,013
<i>But you cannot
control it.</i>

1152
01:23:27,115 --> 01:23:29,640
<i>This is a dangerous
time for you...</i>

1153
01:23:29,751 --> 01:23:33,517
<i>when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.</i>

1154
01:23:33,621 --> 01:23:36,852
Yes! Yes!
To Obi-Wan you listen.

1155
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:40,018
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.

1156
01:23:40,128 --> 01:23:43,393
But I've learned
so much since then.

1157
01:23:43,498 --> 01:23:46,899
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and to finish what I've begun.

1158
01:23:47,001 --> 01:23:48,298
You have my word.

1159
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:49,802
<i>It is you
and your abilities...</i>

1160
01:23:49,904 --> 01:23:51,166
<i>the emperor wants.</i>

1161
01:23:51,272 --> 01:23:55,140
<i>That is why your friends
are made to suffer.</i>

1162
01:23:55,243 --> 01:23:57,177
That's why
I have to go.

1163
01:23:57,278 --> 01:24:00,577
<i>Luke, I don't want
to lose you to the emperor...</i>

1164
01:24:00,682 --> 01:24:02,650
<i>the way I lost Vader.</i>

1165
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,240
You won't.

1166
01:24:04,352 --> 01:24:06,320
Stopped they must be.

1167
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:08,719
On this all depends.

1168
01:24:08,823 --> 01:24:11,155
Only a fully trained
Jedi knight...

1169
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:13,056
with the Force
as his ally...

1170
01:24:13,161 --> 01:24:15,755
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

1171
01:24:15,864 --> 01:24:17,991
If you end
your training now...

1172
01:24:18,099 --> 01:24:22,399
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

1173
01:24:22,503 --> 01:24:25,165
you will become
an agent of evil.

1174
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:26,240
<i>Patience.</i>

1175
01:24:26,341 --> 01:24:28,536
And sacrifice
Han and Leia?

1176
01:24:28,643 --> 01:24:32,704
If you honor what they fight for... yes.

1177
01:24:32,814 --> 01:24:34,441
<i>If you choose to face Vader...</i>

1178
01:24:34,549 --> 01:24:35,914
<i>you will do it alone.</i>

1179
01:24:36,017 --> 01:24:38,042
<i>I cannot interfere.</i>

1180
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,345
I understand.

1181
01:24:45,927 --> 01:24:47,155
R2.

1182
01:24:48,763 --> 01:24:50,628
Fire up the converters.

1183
01:24:52,834 --> 01:24:53,858
<i>Luke!</i>

1184
01:24:53,968 --> 01:24:56,960
<i>Don't give in to hate.</i>

1185
01:24:57,071 --> 01:24:59,869
<i>That leads to the dark side.</i>

1186
01:24:59,974 --> 01:25:01,373
Strong is Vader.

1187
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:04,309
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

1188
01:25:04,412 --> 01:25:05,879
I will.

1189
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,709
And I'll return.

1190
01:25:07,815 --> 01:25:09,214
I promise.

1191
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:17,924
Told you, I did.

1192
01:25:18,026 --> 01:25:19,721
Reckless is he.

1193
01:25:19,827 --> 01:25:20,885
Now...

1194
01:25:20,995 --> 01:25:22,758
matters are worse.

1195
01:25:22,864 --> 01:25:25,765
<i>That boy
is our last hope.</i>

1196
01:25:25,867 --> 01:25:27,892
No, there is another.

1197
01:25:59,701 --> 01:26:01,032
The ship's almost finished.

1198
01:26:01,135 --> 01:26:03,365
Two or three more things
and we're in great shape.

1199
01:26:03,471 --> 01:26:05,063
The sooner the better.
Something is wrong here.

1200
01:26:05,173 --> 01:26:07,698
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

1201
01:26:07,809 --> 01:26:10,073
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

1202
01:26:10,178 --> 01:26:12,578
Relax.
I'll talk to Lando...

1203
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,080
and see what
I can find out.

1204
01:26:15,183 --> 01:26:17,083
I don't trust Lando.

1205
01:26:17,185 --> 01:26:19,585
Well, I don't
trust him either.

1206
01:26:19,687 --> 01:26:22,178
But he is my friend.
Besides...

1207
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:24,190
we'll soon be gone.

1208
01:26:24,292 --> 01:26:27,591
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

1209
01:27:00,862 --> 01:27:02,295
Gaahh!

1210
01:27:02,397 --> 01:27:03,455
What happened?

1211
01:27:03,564 --> 01:27:05,054
Gahhh gahhh.

1212
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:06,497
Where?

1213
01:27:06,601 --> 01:27:07,898
Gahhh!

1214
01:27:08,002 --> 01:27:09,867
Found him
in a junk pile?

1215
01:27:09,971 --> 01:27:12,701
Oh, what a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

1216
01:27:12,807 --> 01:27:14,741
Gahhh!

1217
01:27:14,842 --> 01:27:16,503
Lando's got people
that can fix him.

1218
01:27:16,611 --> 01:27:18,078
No, thanks.

1219
01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:21,808
I'm sorry, am I
interrupting anything?

1220
01:27:21,916 --> 01:27:23,884
Not really.

1221
01:27:27,355 --> 01:27:29,414
You look
absolutely beautiful.

1222
01:27:29,524 --> 01:27:32,857
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

1223
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,393
Thank you.

1224
01:27:34,495 --> 01:27:37,396
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

1225
01:27:37,498 --> 01:27:39,056
Everyone's invited,
of course.

1226
01:27:40,501 --> 01:27:42,366
Having trouble
with your droid?

1227
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:43,903
No, no problem.

1228
01:27:44,005 --> 01:27:44,994
Why?

1229
01:27:53,214 --> 01:27:55,512
You see, since we're
a small operation...

1230
01:27:55,616 --> 01:27:57,607
we don't fall into...

1231
01:27:57,718 --> 01:28:00,050
the jurisdiction
of the Empire.

1232
01:28:00,154 --> 01:28:03,055
So you're part of
the Mining Guild, then?

1233
01:28:03,157 --> 01:28:05,022
No, not actually. Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed.

1234
01:28:05,126 --> 01:28:07,060
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

1235
01:28:07,161 --> 01:28:09,527
since our customers
are anxious to avoid...

1236
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:11,757
attracting attention
to themselves.

1237
01:28:11,866 --> 01:28:14,300
Aren't you afraid
the Empire's going to find out...

1238
01:28:14,402 --> 01:28:16,233
about this little operation,
shut you down?

1239
01:28:16,337 --> 01:28:18,737
It's always been a danger that looms
like a shadow over everything we've built.

1240
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,206
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

1241
01:28:21,309 --> 01:28:26,144
I've just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

1242
01:28:35,156 --> 01:28:37,954
We would be honored
if you would join us.

1243
01:28:43,431 --> 01:28:44,830
I had no choice.

1244
01:28:44,932 --> 01:28:47,230
They arrived
right before you did.

1245
01:28:47,335 --> 01:28:48,802
I'm sorry.

1246
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,667
I'm sorry, too.

1247
01:28:56,944 --> 01:28:58,741
Gahhh.

1248
01:29:10,191 --> 01:29:12,182
No, 3PO's with them.

1249
01:29:12,293 --> 01:29:14,420
Just hang on.
We're almost there.

1250
01:29:22,203 --> 01:29:24,603
Gahhh!

1251
01:29:24,705 --> 01:29:28,141
Gahhh!

1252
01:30:11,219 --> 01:30:13,084
Oh ah ooh ah.

1253
01:30:13,187 --> 01:30:15,587
Im trbly srry.

1254
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:18,090
I dndt mn to
intrddd.

1255
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:24,596
No! Secret.
Stormtroopers?

1256
01:30:24,699 --> 01:30:26,257
Here?
We're in danger!

1257
01:30:26,367 --> 01:30:28,358
I must
tell the others.

1258
01:30:28,469 --> 01:30:30,437
Oh, no,
I've been shot!

1259
01:30:49,257 --> 01:30:50,918
Aaah!

1260
01:30:51,025 --> 01:30:52,083
Aaah!

1261
01:30:52,193 --> 01:30:56,152
Aaaaahhh!

1262
01:30:57,698 --> 01:30:59,097
Lord Vader.

1263
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,601
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

1264
01:31:02,703 --> 01:31:04,568
after I have Skywalker.

1265
01:31:04,672 --> 01:31:06,537
He's no good to me dead.

1266
01:31:06,641 --> 01:31:09,576
He will not be
permanently damaged.

1267
01:31:09,677 --> 01:31:11,770
Aaaahhh!

1268
01:31:11,879 --> 01:31:15,280
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

1269
01:31:15,383 --> 01:31:17,749
They must never again
leave this city.

1270
01:31:17,852 --> 01:31:19,376
That was never a condition
of our agreement...

1271
01:31:19,487 --> 01:31:21,079
nor was giving Han
to this bounty hunter.

1272
01:31:21,188 --> 01:31:26,353
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

1273
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:27,358
No.

1274
01:31:27,461 --> 01:31:28,894
Good. It would be
unfortunate...

1275
01:31:28,996 --> 01:31:32,557
if I had to leave
a garrison here.

1276
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:37,001
This deal is getting worse all the time.

1277
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:41,140
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

1278
01:31:41,242 --> 01:31:42,402
Oh!

1279
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:45,104
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

1280
01:31:45,212 --> 01:31:49,308
Oh, oh, oh,
that's much better.

1281
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:50,816
Wait! Wait!

1282
01:31:50,918 --> 01:31:52,818
Oh, my!
What have you done?

1283
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,820
I'm backwards...

1284
01:31:54,922 --> 01:31:56,822
you flea-bitten
furball!

1285
01:31:56,924 --> 01:31:58,824
Only an overgrown
mophead like you...

1286
01:31:58,926 --> 01:32:00,553
would be
stupid enough...

1287
01:32:14,108 --> 01:32:15,666
I feel terrible.

1288
01:32:15,776 --> 01:32:17,175
Gahhh.

1289
01:32:30,825 --> 01:32:33,191
Why are they
doing this?

1290
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:39,697
They never even asked me
any questions.

1291
01:32:43,137 --> 01:32:44,695
Lando.

1292
01:32:47,475 --> 01:32:48,499
Grrr!

1293
01:32:48,609 --> 01:32:49,735
Get out of here, Lando.

1294
01:32:49,844 --> 01:32:51,709
Shut up and listen!

1295
01:32:51,812 --> 01:32:54,007
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

1296
01:32:54,115 --> 01:32:56,015
They'll have to stay here,
but at least they'll be safe.

1297
01:32:56,117 --> 01:32:57,175
What about Han?

1298
01:32:57,284 --> 01:32:58,251
Vader's given him
to the bounty hunter.

1299
01:32:58,352 --> 01:32:59,876
Vader wants us
all dead.

1300
01:32:59,987 --> 01:33:01,011
He doesn't want you at all.

1301
01:33:01,122 --> 01:33:02,885
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

1302
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:04,890
- Luke.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.

1303
01:33:04,992 --> 01:33:06,983
And we're the bait!

1304
01:33:07,094 --> 01:33:08,925
He's on his way.

1305
01:33:09,029 --> 01:33:12,089
You fixed us all
real good, didn't you?

1306
01:33:12,199 --> 01:33:13,393
My friend.

1307
01:33:15,703 --> 01:33:16,829
Stop!

1308
01:33:18,873 --> 01:33:20,397
I've done all I can.

1309
01:33:20,508 --> 01:33:21,907
I'm sorry
I couldn't do better...

1310
01:33:22,009 --> 01:33:23,601
but I've got
my own problems.

1311
01:33:23,711 --> 01:33:25,076
Yeah.

1312
01:33:25,179 --> 01:33:27,010
You're a real hero.

1313
01:33:37,391 --> 01:33:39,951
You certainly have
a way with people.

1314
01:33:43,731 --> 01:33:45,323
Ah... Ah...

1315
01:33:54,341 --> 01:33:56,468
This facility is crude...

1316
01:33:56,577 --> 01:33:59,512
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

1317
01:33:59,613 --> 01:34:02,013
for his journey to the emperor.

1318
01:34:02,116 --> 01:34:04,949
Lord Vader, ship approaching,
X-wing class.

1319
01:34:05,052 --> 01:34:07,350
Good.
Monitor Skywalker...

1320
01:34:07,455 --> 01:34:09,446
and allow him
to land.

1321
01:34:09,557 --> 01:34:12,924
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing.

1322
01:34:13,027 --> 01:34:15,359
You put him in there,
it might kill him.

1323
01:34:15,463 --> 01:34:16,862
I do not want...

1324
01:34:16,964 --> 01:34:18,363
the emperor's prize
damaged.

1325
01:34:18,466 --> 01:34:20,934
We will test it
on Captain Solo.

1326
01:34:43,524 --> 01:34:46,322
If only you'd
attached my legs...

1327
01:34:46,427 --> 01:34:48,361
I wouldn't be
in this ridiculous position.

1328
01:34:48,462 --> 01:34:49,861
Now remember,
Chewbacca...

1329
01:34:49,964 --> 01:34:51,864
you have a responsibility for me...

1330
01:34:51,966 --> 01:34:53,797
so don't do anything foolish.

1331
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:08,343
What's going on...

1332
01:35:08,449 --> 01:35:09,939
buddy?

1333
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:12,985
You're being put
into carbon freeze.

1334
01:35:13,087 --> 01:35:16,545
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

1335
01:35:16,657 --> 01:35:18,056
The Empire
will compensate you...

1336
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:19,216
if he dies.

1337
01:35:19,326 --> 01:35:21,226
Put him in.

1338
01:35:21,328 --> 01:35:22,386
Rrrah!

1339
01:35:22,496 --> 01:35:24,896
Rrrah! Rrrah!

1340
01:35:24,999 --> 01:35:26,899
Stop, Chewie,
stop, stop!

1341
01:35:27,001 --> 01:35:30,493
Yes, stop, please!
I'm not ready to die!

1342
01:35:30,604 --> 01:35:33,072
Hey! Hey! Listen
to me, Chewie.

1343
01:35:33,173 --> 01:35:35,198
This won't help me.

1344
01:35:35,309 --> 01:35:36,537
Hey, save your strength.

1345
01:35:36,644 --> 01:35:39,238
There will be
another time.

1346
01:35:39,346 --> 01:35:41,405
The princess...

1347
01:35:41,515 --> 01:35:43,312
You have to
take care of her.

1348
01:35:45,519 --> 01:35:47,817
Do you hear me?
Huh?

1349
01:35:47,922 --> 01:35:49,184
Gahhh...

1350
01:36:01,435 --> 01:36:02,595
I love you.

1351
01:36:02,703 --> 01:36:04,398
I know.

1352
01:36:25,459 --> 01:36:26,892
Gahhh!

1353
01:36:33,567 --> 01:36:35,694
What's going on?
Turn around!

1354
01:36:35,803 --> 01:36:37,202
Chewbacca,
I can't see.

1355
01:36:51,418 --> 01:36:53,613
Gahhh.

1356
01:37:34,962 --> 01:37:38,363
Oh, they've encased him
in carbonite.

1357
01:37:38,465 --> 01:37:40,126
He should be quite
well-protected...

1358
01:37:40,234 --> 01:37:42,168
if he survived the freezing process,
that is.

1359
01:37:42,269 --> 01:37:45,136
Well, Calrissian,
did he survive?

1360
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:47,070
Yes, he's alive.

1361
01:37:47,174 --> 01:37:49,301
And in perfect hibernation.

1362
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:52,379
He's all yours,
bounty hunter.

1363
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:54,970
Reset the chamber
for Skywalker.

1364
01:37:57,384 --> 01:37:59,215
Skywalker has
just landed, lord.

1365
01:37:59,319 --> 01:38:03,221
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

1366
01:38:07,461 --> 01:38:11,898
Calrissian, take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1367
01:38:11,999 --> 01:38:14,160
You said they'd be left in the city
under my supervision.

1368
01:38:14,268 --> 01:38:16,327
I am altering the deal.

1369
01:38:16,437 --> 01:38:19,167
Pray I don't
alter it any further.

1370
01:39:55,068 --> 01:39:56,296
Gahhh!

1371
01:39:56,403 --> 01:39:58,963
Luke! Luke, don't,
it's a trap!

1372
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,566
It's a trap!

1373
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:50,347
The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.

1374
01:40:51,859 --> 01:40:54,828
But you are not
a Jedi yet.

1375
01:41:56,156 --> 01:41:57,555
Well done.

1376
01:41:59,693 --> 01:42:02,093
Hold them
in the security tower.

1377
01:42:02,195 --> 01:42:04,322
And keep it quiet. Move.

1378
01:42:09,303 --> 01:42:11,533
What do you think
you're doing?

1379
01:42:11,638 --> 01:42:12,605
We're getting
out of here.

1380
01:42:12,739 --> 01:42:14,468
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1381
01:42:14,574 --> 01:42:17,441
Do you think that after what you did
to Han, we're going to trust you?

1382
01:42:17,544 --> 01:42:18,306
Grrr!

1383
01:42:18,412 --> 01:42:20,073
I had no choice.

1384
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:21,738
What are you doing?
Trust him! Trust him!

1385
01:42:21,848 --> 01:42:24,874
We understand, don't we,
Chewie? He had no choice.

1386
01:42:24,985 --> 01:42:26,543
I'm just
trying to help.

1387
01:42:26,653 --> 01:42:28,951
We don't need
any of your help.

1388
01:42:29,056 --> 01:42:30,421
Haaa...

1389
01:42:30,524 --> 01:42:31,286
Grrr!

1390
01:42:31,391 --> 01:42:33,621
Ha... Ha...

1391
01:42:33,727 --> 01:42:34,751
What?

1392
01:42:34,861 --> 01:42:35,919
Han...

1393
01:42:36,029 --> 01:42:37,155
It sounds like Han.

1394
01:42:37,264 --> 01:42:38,788
There's still
a chance...

1395
01:42:38,899 --> 01:42:40,628
to save Han...

1396
01:42:40,734 --> 01:42:43,066
at the east...

1397
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:44,831
platform.

1398
01:42:44,938 --> 01:42:45,927
Chewie.

1399
01:42:48,575 --> 01:42:51,169
I'm terribly sorry
about all this.

1400
01:42:51,278 --> 01:42:53,075
After all,
he's only a Wookiee.

1401
01:42:53,180 --> 01:42:56,775
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

1402
01:43:11,898 --> 01:43:14,298
R2, R2, where have you been?

1403
01:43:14,401 --> 01:43:16,164
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1404
01:43:16,269 --> 01:43:20,137
Hurry! Hurry! We're trying to save Han
from the bounty hunter.

1405
01:43:21,641 --> 01:43:25,270
Well, at least you're still in one piece.

1406
01:43:25,379 --> 01:43:27,779
Look what's happened to me.

1407
01:43:39,726 --> 01:43:42,320
Oh, no! Chewie,
they're behind you!

1408
01:43:55,275 --> 01:43:57,641
You have learned
much, young one.

1409
01:43:57,744 --> 01:43:59,871
You'll find
I'm full of surprises.

1410
01:44:10,924 --> 01:44:14,553
Your destiny lies
with me, Skywalker.

1411
01:44:14,661 --> 01:44:17,960
Obi-Wan knew this
to be true.

1412
01:44:18,065 --> 01:44:18,861
No.

1413
01:44:23,303 --> 01:44:24,167
Aaah!

1414
01:44:25,972 --> 01:44:27,337
All too easy.

1415
01:44:32,612 --> 01:44:35,046
Perhaps you're
not as strong...

1416
01:44:35,148 --> 01:44:37,013
as the emperor thought.

1417
01:44:38,185 --> 01:44:39,846
Impressive.

1418
01:44:41,788 --> 01:44:43,221
Most impressive.

1419
01:44:46,126 --> 01:44:47,684
Aaah!

1420
01:44:50,697 --> 01:44:52,665
Obi-Wan has
taught you well.

1421
01:44:52,766 --> 01:44:55,132
You have
controlled your fear.

1422
01:44:56,636 --> 01:44:58,103
Now...

1423
01:44:58,205 --> 01:45:00,765
release your anger.

1424
01:45:00,874 --> 01:45:03,934
Only your hatred
can destroy me.

1425
01:45:14,488 --> 01:45:15,750
Ohh!

1426
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:16,370
The security code
has been changed.

1427
01:47:16,476 --> 01:47:18,376
R2, you can tell
the computer...

1428
01:47:18,478 --> 01:47:19,775
to override
the security systems.

1429
01:47:19,879 --> 01:47:22,279
R2, hurry!

1430
01:47:24,751 --> 01:47:26,810
Attention. This is
Lando Calrissian.

1431
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:29,354
Attention. The Empire has taken
control of the city.

1432
01:47:29,456 --> 01:47:31,271
I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.

1433
01:47:31,306 --> 01:47:33,086
I advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive.

1434
01:47:39,566 --> 01:47:40,828
This way.

1435
01:47:40,934 --> 01:47:43,334
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1436
01:47:43,436 --> 01:47:47,566
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1437
01:48:07,527 --> 01:48:08,960
Ah! We're not interested...

1438
01:48:09,062 --> 01:48:11,087
<i>in the Millennium
Falcon's hyperdrive.</i>

1439
01:48:11,197 --> 01:48:12,926
It's fixed!

1440
01:48:14,768 --> 01:48:17,566
Just open the door,
you stupid lump!

1441
01:48:26,313 --> 01:48:28,804
I never doubted you
for a second.

1442
01:48:28,915 --> 01:48:29,904
Wonderful!

1443
01:48:52,772 --> 01:48:54,831
Ouch! Oh! That hurts!

1444
01:48:54,941 --> 01:48:57,136
Bend down,
you thoughtless... Ow!

1445
01:49:01,648 --> 01:49:03,479
Leia!

1446
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:05,649
Go!

1447
01:49:10,423 --> 01:49:14,325
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1448
01:49:15,428 --> 01:49:16,861
Of course
I've looked better.

1449
01:50:10,517 --> 01:50:12,007
You are beaten.

1450
01:50:12,118 --> 01:50:14,211
It is useless to resist.

1451
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:16,254
Don't let yourself
be destroyed...

1452
01:50:16,356 --> 01:50:17,846
as Obi-Wan did.

1453
01:50:23,563 --> 01:50:25,428
Uh!

1454
01:50:28,535 --> 01:50:30,765
Aah!

1455
01:50:32,472 --> 01:50:35,270
There is no escape.

1456
01:50:35,375 --> 01:50:38,276
Don't make me destroy you.

1457
01:50:40,313 --> 01:50:41,302
Luke...

1458
01:50:41,414 --> 01:50:44,815
you do not yet realize
your importance.

1459
01:50:44,918 --> 01:50:47,819
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1460
01:50:47,921 --> 01:50:49,479
Join me...

1461
01:50:49,589 --> 01:50:52,285
and I will complete
your training.

1462
01:50:52,392 --> 01:50:54,656
With our combined strength...

1463
01:50:54,761 --> 01:50:57,662
we can end
this destructive conflict...

1464
01:50:57,764 --> 01:51:00,324
and bring order
to the galaxy.

1465
01:51:00,433 --> 01:51:01,900
I'll never join you!

1466
01:51:02,001 --> 01:51:04,799
If you only knew
the power...

1467
01:51:04,904 --> 01:51:06,838
of the dark side.

1468
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:09,170
Obi-Wan never told you...

1469
01:51:09,275 --> 01:51:11,175
what happened
to your father.

1470
01:51:11,277 --> 01:51:12,972
He told me enough.

1471
01:51:15,582 --> 01:51:17,447
He told me
you killed him.

1472
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:18,847
No.

1473
01:51:18,952 --> 01:51:21,318
<i>I am your father.</i>

1474
01:51:25,458 --> 01:51:27,517
No.

1475
01:51:27,627 --> 01:51:29,117
No.

1476
01:51:29,229 --> 01:51:32,460
That's not true.

1477
01:51:32,565 --> 01:51:34,294
That's impossible!

1478
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,665
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1479
01:51:38,905 --> 01:51:41,533
No!

1480
01:51:41,641 --> 01:51:44,940
No!

1481
01:51:45,044 --> 01:51:46,375
Luke.

1482
01:51:46,479 --> 01:51:48,640
You can destroy
the emperor.

1483
01:51:48,748 --> 01:51:50,648
He has foreseen this.

1484
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:53,548
It is your destiny.

1485
01:51:53,653 --> 01:51:58,147
Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy...

1486
01:51:58,258 --> 01:51:59,885
as father and son.

1487
01:52:10,503 --> 01:52:12,164
Come with me.

1488
01:52:12,272 --> 01:52:15,207
It is the only way.

1489
01:53:21,107 --> 01:53:23,337
Ben.

1490
01:53:23,443 --> 01:53:25,570
Ben, please.

1491
01:53:34,554 --> 01:53:36,021
Ben.

1492
01:53:41,227 --> 01:53:42,558
Leia.

1493
01:53:52,705 --> 01:53:54,673
Hear me.

1494
01:53:56,309 --> 01:53:57,606
Leia.

1495
01:53:57,710 --> 01:53:59,200
Luke.

1496
01:54:01,381 --> 01:54:03,281
We've got to go back.

1497
01:54:03,383 --> 01:54:05,317
- What?
- I know where Luke is.

1498
01:54:05,418 --> 01:54:06,578
What about
those fighters?

1499
01:54:06,686 --> 01:54:08,745
Chewie, just do it.

1500
01:54:08,855 --> 01:54:10,288
But what about Vader?

1501
01:54:10,390 --> 01:54:11,789
All right, all right!

1502
01:54:19,432 --> 01:54:24,028
Alert my Stardestroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1503
01:54:33,379 --> 01:54:36,246
Look, someone's up there.

1504
01:54:37,717 --> 01:54:38,809
It's Luke.

1505
01:54:38,918 --> 01:54:40,408
Chewie, slow down.

1506
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,420
Slow down.
We'll get under him.

1507
01:54:42,522 --> 01:54:44,820
Lando,
open the top hatch.

1508
01:54:59,672 --> 01:55:00,832
O.K.

1509
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:02,032
Easy, Chewie.

1510
01:55:02,141 --> 01:55:03,199
Gahrrr.

1511
01:55:23,796 --> 01:55:24,728
Lando?

1512
01:55:24,831 --> 01:55:25,923
<i>O.K., let's go.</i>

1513
01:55:43,182 --> 01:55:45,377
Oh, Leia.

1514
01:55:45,485 --> 01:55:47,419
All right, Chewie,
let's go.

1515
01:56:22,655 --> 01:56:23,917
I'll be back.

1516
01:56:30,563 --> 01:56:31,962
Stardestroyer.

1517
01:56:37,203 --> 01:56:39,569
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

1518
01:56:39,672 --> 01:56:41,833
<i>If your people fixed
the hyperdrive.</i>

1519
01:56:41,941 --> 01:56:44,307
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1520
01:56:44,410 --> 01:56:46,571
Punch it!

1521
01:56:56,556 --> 01:56:58,854
They told me
they fixed it.

1522
01:56:58,958 --> 01:57:00,858
I trusted them!

1523
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,485
It's not my fault!

1524
01:57:08,534 --> 01:57:11,594
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1525
01:57:11,704 --> 01:57:13,262
Did your men deactivate...

1526
01:57:13,372 --> 01:57:15,431
<i>the hyperdrive on
the Millennium Falcon?</i>

1527
01:57:15,541 --> 01:57:16,473
Yes, my lord.

1528
01:57:16,576 --> 01:57:18,942
Good. Prepare
the boarding party...

1529
01:57:19,045 --> 01:57:21,309
and set your weapons
for "stun."

1530
01:57:21,414 --> 01:57:23,279
Yes, my lord.
Lieutenant.

1531
01:57:23,382 --> 01:57:24,440
Yes, sir.

1532
01:57:26,085 --> 01:57:28,883
Noisy brute. Why don't we just
go into light speed?

1533
01:57:30,489 --> 01:57:32,354
We can't?
How would you know...

1534
01:57:32,458 --> 01:57:33,516
the hyperdrive
is deactivated?

1535
01:57:36,796 --> 01:57:39,196
The city's central
computer told you?

1536
01:57:39,298 --> 01:57:42,563
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1537
01:57:42,668 --> 01:57:43,692
Ouch!

1538
01:57:43,803 --> 01:57:45,998
Pay attention
to what you're doing!

1539
01:57:56,415 --> 01:57:58,076
Luke.

1540
01:57:58,184 --> 01:58:00,414
Father.

1541
01:58:00,519 --> 01:58:04,319
Son, come with me.

1542
01:58:06,192 --> 01:58:07,659
Ben.

1543
01:58:08,995 --> 01:58:10,963
Why didn't you tell me?

1544
01:58:16,202 --> 01:58:18,102
Chewie!

1545
01:58:29,282 --> 01:58:30,544
It's Vader.

1546
01:58:36,222 --> 01:58:39,817
Luke, it is your destiny.

1547
01:58:44,664 --> 01:58:46,928
Ben.

1548
01:58:47,033 --> 01:58:49,467
Why didn't you tell me?

1549
01:58:56,208 --> 01:58:58,039
Alert all commands.

1550
01:58:58,144 --> 01:59:00,135
Ready for
the tractor beam.

1551
01:59:02,515 --> 01:59:04,415
R2, come back at once!

1552
01:59:04,517 --> 01:59:06,382
You haven't finished
with me yet.

1553
01:59:06,485 --> 01:59:08,248
You don't know how
to fix the hyperdrive.

1554
01:59:08,354 --> 01:59:09,753
Chewbacca can do it.

1555
01:59:09,855 --> 01:59:11,254
I'm standing here
in pieces...

1556
01:59:11,357 --> 01:59:14,554
and you're having
delusions of grandeur!

1557
01:59:17,029 --> 01:59:19,156
You did it!

1558
02:00:16,055 --> 02:00:18,615
Luke, we're ready
for takeoff.

1559
02:00:18,724 --> 02:00:19,884
<i>Good luck, Lando.</i>

1560
02:00:20,026 --> 02:00:22,119
<i>When we find
Jabba the Hutt...</i>

1561
02:00:22,228 --> 02:00:23,627
<i>and that
bounty hunter...</i>

1562
02:00:23,729 --> 02:00:24,889
<i>we'll contact you.</i>

1563
02:00:24,997 --> 02:00:27,659
I'll meet you
at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1564
02:00:27,767 --> 02:00:29,860
Princess,
we'll find Han.

1565
02:00:29,969 --> 02:00:31,197
I promise.

1566
02:00:31,303 --> 02:00:33,533
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.

1567
02:00:33,639 --> 02:00:35,368
Take care, you two.

1568
02:00:35,474 --> 02:00:37,339
<i>May the Force
be with you.</i>

1569
02:00:37,443 --> 02:00:38,967
Gahhh.

1570
02:00:39,078 --> 02:00:41,546
<i>Gahhh.</i>

1571
02:00:50,656 --> 02:00:51,623
Ow.
