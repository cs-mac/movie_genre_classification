1
00:00:01,013 --> 00:00:03,183
(Emotional Trip with Poets)

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:05,553
(In Hadong, the literature capital)

3
00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:08,313
(The members enjoy the trip as poets.)

4
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:11,653
(They are put through vicious training to become one.)

5
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,883
(The journey is all but pain though.)

6
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,013
(They heal through their own poems.)

7
00:00:18,513 --> 00:00:20,583
(Poets' Spring Picnic)

8
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:22,853
(They play for a variety of prizes.)

9
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:25,013
("Drop Water Buckets")

10
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:27,513
(The penalty was water slaps.)

11
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:31,753
(Everything they experience serve as inspiration.)

12
00:00:32,853 --> 00:00:34,453
(What will the rest of their journey look like?)

13
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:38,653
(They head to base camp.)

14
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:42,521
What's this smell?

15
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:45,151
I smell bulgogi.

16
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:46,291
Why do I smell bulgogi?

17
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,351
- I smell anchovies. - Director Yoo.

18
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:49,621
- Anchovies... - Stir-fried anchovies.

19
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:51,291
- No, I smell anchovy broth. - Are you hungry?

20
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,121
Joon Ho hasn't been able to eat.

21
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,421
He stinks more since he's on an empty stomach.

22
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:56,851
What smell?

23
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:58,921
- There's no need to pick at him. - Hold on.

24
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:01,951
My gosh.

25
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:04,291
- This is beautiful. - It's a mansion.

26
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,321
Welcome to my house.

27
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:07,351
- No, it's my house. - It's beautiful.

28
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:09,221
- What's that puppy doing there? - It's my house.

29
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:10,291
- Come on in. - Hi.

30
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:12,891
Look at the puppy.

31
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:15,261
- Yellow Teeth. - Hi, Yellow Teeth.

32
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:16,721
Hi, there.

33
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:18,091
- Hello! - Hello!

34
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:20,491
- Look, it's your dad. - He's adorable.

35
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:21,951
- Hello. - Your dad's here.

36
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:23,921
- Jong Min. - He's adorable.

37
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,351
Hi dear.

38
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:27,221
- We're here... - Hello.

39
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:30,491
in Jeongdong Village of Hadong.

40
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:33,291
The stream in the village is Akyang Stream.

41
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:36,521
It's a small village located on the flatland of Hadong,

42
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:39,251
and has been around the longest.

43
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:43,851
80 homes of 180 people currently occupy it.

44
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,551
- That's more than I expected. - Me too.

45
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:49,391
The name of this week's special is...

46
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:51,591
Emotional Trip with Poets.

47
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:54,821
We heard that a famous poet...

48
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:56,821
is a resident of the village,

49
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:58,091
so we invited him to join us.

50
00:01:58,091 --> 00:01:59,321
Is it for real this time?

51
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:00,891
He might make us wear costumes again.

52
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:01,951
Please don't.

53
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,191
- Hold on. - Come on out.

54
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:04,491
You've got to be kidding.

55
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,121
(A mysterious bamboo hat)

56
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:10,391
As of now, you are the wandering poet Kim Sat Gat.

57
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:12,251
Please put on the robes.

58
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:14,791
Is this how it's done?

59
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:18,291
Tie the straps inside the robe first. Like this.

60
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,991
Dong Gu knows due to his time on period dramas.

61
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,161
You look like a martial arts expert.

62
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:25,851
For some reason, you look extraordinary.

63
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:27,191
He does.

64
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:29,621
(You're supposed to be Kim Sat Gat.)

65
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:31,091
The proper attire...

66
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:33,161
makes you all look like the wandering poet.

67
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:34,921
You look cooler when your face can't be seen.

68
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,691
That's right. Like this.

69
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,991
Wandering poet Kim Sat Gat traveled the country,

70
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:42,291
and left many poems wherever...

71
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,221
his feet took him.

72
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:46,321
Guys, it's "Bamboo".

73
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:48,121
Call me MC Kim Sat Gat.

74
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:51,221
- Go. - "Just let it be as it is."

75
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,491
- I can rap to it. - What's up?

76
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:54,391
"As the wind blows, as the waves break."

77
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,251
"However your life is, just live it."

78
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:58,491
"Right or wrong, just see as it is."

79
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:01,451
"When hosting guests, don't stretch money too thin."

80
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:03,121
I have a bad feeling about this.

81
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:05,921
"Follow the market price when buying or selling goods."

82
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:08,521
"Everything in this world never goes as planned."

83
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,691
"So live your life just like how it is."

84
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,121
Do we have to sell something?

85
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:14,421
- We'll recite our poems for food. - We have to beg?

86
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:15,921
We'll be selling poems.

87
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:18,421
I love how clever you have become.

88
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:20,421
As poets, we can read between the lines.

89
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:21,421
Don't you agree?

90
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:23,051
Today's "Dinner Game"...

91
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:25,791
is called "Wandering Poet Kim Sat Gat".

92
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,021
Just like you read in the poem "Bamboo",

93
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:31,091
you'll be roaming around Jeongdong Village...

94
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:32,991
like wind and water...

95
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:37,291
playing charades with the village people.

96
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:41,321
You will have to get three correct answers in time.

97
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,751
You can get 1 food per 1 house.

98
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:46,691
It's really hard. Do you remember?

99
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:49,951
Old people are quite bad at charades.

100
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:51,991
You can't just get the food for free.

101
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:54,621
When you complete the mission,

102
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:57,151
ask the player's name...

103
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:59,651
and make an acrostic poem out of it.

104
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:00,721
(That's a good idea.)

105
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:01,721
An acrostic poem?

106
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:04,791
Make an acrostic poem only out of the first name.

107
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,991
Joon Ho, laugh like this.

108
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:07,991
(Laughing)

109
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:09,451
(My gosh!)

110
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,551
(How dare you...)

111
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:15,321
- Like this, for example? - He got me.

112
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:18,651
Joon Ho and Tae Hyun are one team.

113
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,251
Jong Min and Defconn are one team.

114
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:23,591
Dong Gu and Joon Young are one team.

115
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:26,721
I don't think we will get that much food, though.

116
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,121
- How many minutes do we have? - All right.

117
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:30,691
- You have 1 hour. - In 1 hour.

118
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:34,251
Are you ready? Let's begin.

119
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:37,051
- Let's go! - Let's go.

120
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:39,751
- Hang on. - Please let us know when the time is up.

121
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:43,621
I'm a poet who wanders with the winds and clouds.

122
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:46,491
Anybody here?

123
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:50,221
We're travelers just passing by.

124
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,491
Hello, sir.

125
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:54,651
(The old man welcomes them with a warm smile.)

126
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:56,491
We'd like to play a game with you.

127
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:59,151
If you answer our questions correctly,

128
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:01,051
we're going to write you a poem as a present.

129
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,891
I think I can't do it. I can't understand you well.

130
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,791
- Shall we try anyway? - What if I lose?

131
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,851
It's fine even if you lose.

132
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,251
If you don't say the correct answer, we'll starve.

133
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:14,051
If you answer 3 questions correctly in 1 minute,

134
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:17,961
we can get some food from you.

135
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:20,521
So I shouldn't answer it correctly to keep my food.

136
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,251
- No way! - No!

137
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:25,051
You should! I haven't eaten anything today.

138
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:26,221
I haven't eaten anything since morning.

139
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:28,891
Ready, go.

140
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:32,321
- What is this called? - This.

141
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:33,821
- Wrinkles. - Yes!

142
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:34,821
That's correct.

143
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:35,851
(The game got off to a flying start.)

144
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,851
Sir, what is this?

145
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:38,951
(He imitates a dog pooping.)

146
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,421
It's about dogs.

147
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,321
It's a proverb. You can't find this when it's in need.

148
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:45,721
- You can't find dog poop when it's in need. - Yes!

149
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:46,751
(You're the best!)

150
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:50,251
What's another word for "idiot"?

151
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:51,751
Another word for "idiot"? Fool.

152
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:55,721
- Thank you. - You're really good.

153
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:57,891
You've got good sense.

154
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,921
Since you're hungry, I should give you some food.

155
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:04,721
- Yes. - I'm starving. I haven't eaten anything yet.

156
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:07,551
- Let's go have a look. - Let's go.

157
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,621
(He gladly invites them to his house.)

158
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:12,521
- Thank you. - Thank you, sir.

159
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,151
Take this.

160
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:17,221
- We can bring only one food. - Only one food.

161
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:19,221
(Right then, his wife shows up.)

162
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:22,651
Hello, ma'am. We played a game with your husband.

163
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:25,321
- I see. - And he answered the questions correctly.

164
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:27,721
You look more handsome than on the television.

165
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,991
- My goodness. - We can bring one food...

166
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,551
- that you give us. - One food?

167
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:37,851
- There are eggs. - It's very well-organized.

168
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:40,391
- There's kimchi as well. - What about some spinach?

169
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:44,191
- There's seasoned spinach. - There's a lot of food.

170
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:45,551
Choose anything.

171
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:48,051
You have some meat here as well.

172
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:49,251
(Tae Hyun looks through the food in the fridge.)

173
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:50,821
- They look delicious. - Can we take a look?

174
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,321
- Look at this. - What is that?

175
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:55,421
(He found an awesome dish.)

176
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:57,691
Gosh. Look at that.

177
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,521
- Oh my goodness. - How lucky we are.

178
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:00,591
(They found it.)

179
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:02,851
- My goodness. - What's that?

180
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:03,851
(Is it also jeon?)

181
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:06,321
Is it also...

182
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:08,951
Oh my goodness!

183
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:12,251
Why did you want to give us spinach when you have this?

184
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:13,791
(Upset)

185
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,721
- It might be for her husband. - That must be it.

186
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:20,591
I'm not sure if it's tasty.

187
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:23,051
Come on. It looks tasty.

188
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,051
(It looks delicious.)

189
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:26,151
I'm not sure if it's enough. Do you want this one?

190
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:29,391
I think it's enough. Leave some for your husband.

191
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:30,721
(Peeking)

192
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:32,751
It seems like he's quite upset.

193
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:33,751
(I'm fine. Take as much as you want.)

194
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:36,551
- Gosh - Would that be enough?

195
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,751
- Thank you. - This is enough.

196
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,321
(He writes an acrostic poem with her name.)

197
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:44,451
Sir, you should read this to her.

198
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:45,851
(Expectant)

199
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:47,251
- I'm reading this? - Yes.

200
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:49,321
Please read it while holding her hands.

201
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:51,721
- Do I have to... - Come on. Hold her hands.

202
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,721
(They hold each other's hands.)

203
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:54,151
- Let's go. - "Bong".

204
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:57,491
"What a lucky man I am."

205
00:07:57,491 --> 00:08:00,621
- "Im". - "I'm lucky to have you, sweetheart."

206
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:02,591
(Shy)

207
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:05,551
It's an acrostic poem of "Bong Im".

208
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:09,421
Young Bae loves Bong Im.

209
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,491
(I love you.)

210
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,591
- I love you. - I love you.

211
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:15,321
Thank you so much for the food.

212
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,051
We don't need any more food.

213
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:20,651
- Thank you, ma'am. - You're welcome. Goodbye.

214
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:21,791
Thank you.

215
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:24,821
How about this place? Tae Hyun, how about this place?

216
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,421
- It's a food truck. - There's a man.

217
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:29,321
- We don't have time for that. - I'm sorry.

218
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:33,751
(Defconn and Jong Min visit the first house.)

219
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:35,591
Is anybody there?

220
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:37,851
(Luckily, someone is at home.)

221
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,951
- Hello. - Hello.

222
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:39,951
(Confused)

223
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:42,491
- We're from One Night Two Days. - Two Days.

224
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:44,721
- This is Kim Jong Min. - Hello.

225
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:46,621
(They're the people from television.)

226
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:52,061
Could you please introduce yourself? What's your name?

227
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:53,061
My name is Ha In Soon.

228
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:56,421
- Your name is Ha In Soon. - Ms. Ha In Soon.

229
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:59,751
Thank you so much for making good memories with us.

230
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:04,151
I'm happy to see you personally out of the television.

231
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:06,421
- Why don't you give her a hug? - Ma'am.

232
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,421
(Jong Min gives her a hug.)

233
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,121
- Goodness. - Good job.

234
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:12,651
I laugh every time you are on the television.

235
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:15,321
(Jong Min is an expert at entertaining old people.)

236
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:17,621
- Let's give her the questions. - Let's begin.

237
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:18,621
We will begin the game now.

238
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:20,491
Ready, go.

239
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:23,321
Ma'am. What's the vehicle?

240
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:24,821
(Luckily, a cultivator is in the yard.)

241
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:27,691
- A cultivator. - Correct!

242
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:30,451
- Ma'am, it's... - It's the underwear.

243
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:33,061
- What is this in English? - This.

244
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,691
- That? - This.

245
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:38,721
- Money pouch. - No.

246
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:40,951
- It's an underwear. - You wear it inside.

247
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:43,651
- "Undies". - Right. What is another word for it?

248
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,151
(What's another word for "undies"?)

249
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:46,221
We'll skip this question.

250
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:47,791
(Na Hoon A)

251
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:51,421
- I don't know why I'm like this - It's a singer.

252
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,061
(The answer is on the tip of her tongue.)

253
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:54,691
- He's a singer. - I don't know.

254
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:55,791
Never mind. Next.

255
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,391
What is it called when it suddenly rains a lot?

256
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:00,121
- Three syllables. - A shower.

257
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,321
All right. Now...

258
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,851
(This is...)

259
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:05,951
(They never discussed this beforehand.)

260
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:07,891
- Shim Hyung Rae. - Shim Hyung Rae.

261
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,121
(I have no idea.)

262
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:10,991
Skip this one.

263
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:13,321
- You failed. - Why?

264
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,221
"Undies" and "panties" are the same.

265
00:10:15,221 --> 00:10:17,221
- That should count. - It should.

266
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:20,061
- Ma'am, they're the same, right? - Yes, they are.

267
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:22,721
- "Undies" and "panties" are the same. - Exactly.

268
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,251
(The director is cornered.)

269
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:26,791
We call them "undies". We never call them "panties".

270
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,321
See? They don't call them "panties".

271
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,251
- They speak dialect. - Exactly.

272
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:32,421
- Are you sure? - Yes. I also call them "undies".

273
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:34,021
So she got three answers correctly, right?

274
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:36,221
Okay, I take your point.

275
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:37,221
- We got all three right? - Yes.

276
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,321
We did it.

277
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,321
- Good job. - We made it, ma'am.

278
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:42,251
(It's all thanks to you.)

279
00:10:44,321 --> 00:10:45,851
(She goes into the house to get some food.)

280
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,751
- You did a great job. - "Undies" is correct.

281
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:50,751
(He feels like he's fooled.)

282
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:53,121
Take this.

283
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:54,791
- What are these? - They're eggs.

284
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,051
- That's a lot of eggs! - Don't worry.

285
00:10:57,051 --> 00:11:00,421
- These are... - Aren't they the eggs of an argus?

286
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:03,851
- They are too many. - We don't need so many.

287
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:06,551
- Please take some back. - Just eat all of them.

288
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:07,851
Just give us six eggs.

289
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:09,051
Then how about this?

290
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:12,591
We'll bring the leftover back.

291
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:15,221
You don't need to bring them back.

292
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:16,591
That's really nice of you.

293
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,321
(They're both nice to each other.)

294
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:20,591
Just eat them. They're tasty.

295
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:22,951
- But... - Boil them and eat. It's tasty.

296
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:24,051
- Ma'am. - They're fresh.

297
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,151
They're too good to eat.

298
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:29,051
Whenever I eat the egg, I'll remember her, Ha In Soon.

299
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,621
- Thank you, ma'am. - You're overreacting.

300
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:34,321
- You should make an acrostic poem for her. - Sure.

301
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:38,051
- Since your name is In Soon... - Yes, it is.

302
00:11:38,051 --> 00:11:39,521
Let's start with "In".

303
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:43,821
- You're warm-hearted and beautiful. - There you go.

304
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,751
Here comes the best part. "Soon".

305
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:49,951
In Soon, we love you!

306
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:54,321
Do you like it? Thank you.

307
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:56,751
- Stay healthy. - Stay healthy, ma'am.

308
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:58,991
- Thank you. - Thank you for the eggs.

309
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:01,151
No other food can beat our eggs.

310
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,751
Argus eggs are rare. That's a big house.

311
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:05,421
Is anybody here?

312
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,721
- Hello. - Hello.

313
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:10,651
- We're from One Night Two Days. - Hello.

314
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:13,221
Take off your hat and bow to her.

315
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,891
Thank you for welcoming us.

316
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:16,951
I've been watching you on the rooftop.

317
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:18,591
- Really? - Yes.

318
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:20,951
- Now, let's play... - Right.

319
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,721
Don't cut in line.

320
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:25,921
Hey, we came here first.

321
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:27,991
- Go away. - Go away.

322
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:30,651
- Hello. - You look familiar.

323
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:32,421
(Joon Young and Dong Gu suddenly interrupt.)

324
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:34,221
- Welcome. - Get ready.

325
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,321
(She's happy to see the young men.)

326
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:39,091
- Step aside. - Did you guys fail?

327
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:43,391
We're here because we heard you are a great cook.

328
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:44,621
Let's start.

329
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:48,091
You should guess 3 answers correctly in 1 minute.

330
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:50,721
- Please give me the easy ones. - Ready, go.

331
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:51,721
(Hair perm)

332
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:54,321
- It's a way you make your hair curly. - Curly hair.

333
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:56,121
- "Hair perm". - Correct.

334
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:59,051
This is a proverb. What does one's enemy get?

335
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:00,791
- One's enemy gets more rice cake. - Correct.

336
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,421
- She's good at this. - It's a bear from China.

337
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:05,991
- Its eyes are dark. - It's...

338
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:09,491
- What was it? It's black. - It's black and white.

339
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:10,751
- It has six letters. - Hurry up.

340
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,721
- It has two letters. - I don't know.

341
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:14,321
- Let's skip it. - Skip it.

342
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:16,721
What's the clothing you wear on the New Year's Day.

343
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:18,721
- Seolbim. - Yes!

344
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:20,851
- What's her name? - Let's make a poem.

345
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:22,991
- Do it after we play the game. - No.

346
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,921
What food would you like to give us?

347
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:26,591
I'll give you seasoned vegetables.

348
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:30,191
- Seasoned vegetables? - Yes, it's very tasty.

349
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:32,251
- It's bitter. - It tastes bitter?

350
00:13:32,251 --> 00:13:34,551
- It makes you healthy. - It's bitter.

351
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:36,451
We should come back later.

352
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,821
I admire your writing skills.

353
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:40,191
- Right. - Ta-da.

354
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:43,051
(What dishes will the lady give them?)

355
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:47,451
Dried whole persimmons and dried half persimmons.

356
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:50,291
- Thank you so much. - Here you go.

357
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,321
Can we eat it as it is?

358
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:52,591
- Of course. - Thank you.

359
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:55,121
- It's the local crop. - All right.

360
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:56,921
- Thank you. - You're only allowed one.

361
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,791
- Don't be absurd. - They're the same thing.

362
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,291
One's just cut in half.

363
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,321
- You're being ridiculous. - Only one.

364
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:04,291
- These... - They're the same thing.

365
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,451
They're both persimmons.

366
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:07,751
You can give them one out of the two.

367
00:14:08,251 --> 00:14:09,991
Why can't I give them both? They're the same.

368
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:11,591
All right. How about this?

369
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,151
I think these look better.

370
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,321
Really?

371
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,551
Let's go with the dried whole persimmons.

372
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,821
Ma'am, thank you so much.

373
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:22,691
We'll get going then. Thank you.

374
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:24,121
Thank you and be healthy.

375
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,851
Is this a car wash?

376
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:28,151
(Dong Gu and Joon Young are in search of another dish.)

377
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:30,121
- Hello. - Hi.

378
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,591
- Hi, sir. - Thanks for coming all the way.

379
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,921
- Have you eaten? - Not yet.

380
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:36,551
- What's on the menu? - Are you delivering Chinese?

381
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:38,091
(Are you delivering Chinese?)

382
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:39,521
(A Chinese restaurant delivery box)

383
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:43,251
- Hello, ma'am. - We're from One Night Two Days.

384
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:45,951
- Welcome. - We're here to ask for some food.

385
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,321
I have nothing special except for seasoned baby aster.

386
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,321
I only have vegetables.

387
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,451
What about pork cutlet?

388
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:51,491
Hold on a second.

389
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:53,391
Would you like some?

390
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,321
- My gosh. - We're good with just the vegetables.

391
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,651
All right. Let the game begin.

392
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:02,721
What do you receive to relieve tension in your muscles?

393
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:04,691
- "Anma". - In English, ma'am.

394
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:06,791
- How should I know? - Give us another word.

395
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,421
- Here. - That's nice.

396
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:09,721
A massage!

397
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:11,151
(The husband got it right.)

398
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,791
- Ma'am, what's this? - A wink.

399
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,321
That is correct.

400
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:18,191
(Her husband couldn't help but look how she reacted.)

401
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,521
Next question.

402
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:22,321
- Did I see the answer? - You did.

403
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,391
Hold on a second.

404
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,851
- She's... - She's a middle-aged actress.

405
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:29,191
She's quite short and says this famous line. "It's me."

406
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:30,451
"It's me."

407
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,451
- Jeon Won Joo. - That is correct!

408
00:15:33,221 --> 00:15:35,851
- They got all three correct. - Nice!

409
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,951
- You guys were great. - Thank you.

410
00:15:37,951 --> 00:15:39,251
They were quick to answer.

411
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:41,321
(She packs them a box full of seasoned baby aster.)

412
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:42,951
That's a lot.

413
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:44,551
That's more than enough.

414
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:45,791
(She gives them a generous amount.)

415
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,291
Thank you so much.

416
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:50,321
(We'll enjoy this.)

417
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,391
(Dong Gu tries some on the spot.)

418
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:57,821
- Is it good? - It's tasty.

419
00:15:57,821 --> 00:16:00,221
You can smell its sweet aroma.

420
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:01,251
It's delicious.

421
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:02,891
What was this again?

422
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,191
It's seasoned baby aster.

423
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:07,891
Could I ask your name, sir?

424
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:08,891
It's Oe Su.

425
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:11,251
"How could you do this to me?"

426
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,321
"Every Wednesday."

427
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,451
(What on earth was that?)

428
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:17,051
"He has..."

429
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:19,051
"very good looks."

430
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:21,521
(He sure has a good eye.)

431
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:22,651
There we go.

432
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:25,691
You should sign it with your pen name, Beef Tongue.

433
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:28,751
- Thank you. - Thank you.

434
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:30,121
Thank you for the vegetables.

435
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:31,791
Take care.

436
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,491
Is there a place where we can ask for meat?

437
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:35,851
- No. - I see.

438
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:39,391
Ma'am!

439
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,321
Excuse us.

440
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:44,821
- Hello. - Hi, we're from One Night Two Days.

441
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:46,621
Your time starts now.

442
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:48,091
(Plastic surgery)

443
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,291
You change your face with surgery.

444
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:52,191
The double-eyelid surgery?

445
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:53,791
- No. - Your entire face.

446
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,621
- Plastic surgery? - That is correct.

447
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:57,221
Toast "this" on a flash of lightening.

448
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:58,851
- Swish. - Beans?

449
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,691
- That is correct. - Correct.

450
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,821
- What Boseong is famous for? - Sorry?

451
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,191
Boseong is famous for something green.

452
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,951
- Green tea. - That is correct!

453
00:17:08,951 --> 00:17:09,991
- Nice! - Yes.

454
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,121
You were amazing, ma'am.

455
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:13,951
(Dong Gu kisses her in gratitude.)

456
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,091
We'd appreciate some steamed rice.

457
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:18,121
- Steamed rice? - Yes.

458
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,391
At their age, they should eat plenty.

459
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:25,121
- Thank you. - There you go.

460
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:26,191
Thank you so much.

461
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:28,051
("Your innocent smile brought us happiness" by Dong Gu)

462
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:30,321
- How about this way? - Let's head into the alley.

463
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,091
- Here. - All right.

464
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,151
Hello. Anyone here?

465
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:36,151
- My goodness. - Hi.

466
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:38,421
- Hello. - It's nice to meet you.

467
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:40,761
Thank you for all your hard work.

468
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:42,221
We're sorry for rushing you.

469
00:17:42,491 --> 00:17:43,491
Ready and go!

470
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:44,551
(The charades begin.)

471
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:46,821
(My goodness, don't be this way)

472
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:47,851
Jang Yoon Jeong.

473
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:48,921
(Jang Yoon Jeong)

474
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:52,491
A couple part ways after marriage.

475
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:54,021
- A divorce. - That's right.

476
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:56,261
You never know...

477
00:17:56,261 --> 00:17:57,321
- Your luck. - Your luck.

478
00:17:58,421 --> 00:17:59,421
(They're the best!)

479
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:02,451
- Unbelievable. - You were first to finish the game.

480
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:03,491
(They had chemistry like no other team.)

481
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:04,651
Thank you so much.

482
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,451
I'm afraid we've yet to obtain steamed rice.

483
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:08,621
I'll cook some right away then.

484
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,521
Don't you have any leftover steamed rice?

485
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:13,321
- I do, but it's not much. - That's fine.

486
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:15,091
Should I write a poem with the name "Young Jun"?

487
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:16,921
I'm afraid we don't have the time.

488
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:19,121
"I love you."

489
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:23,451
Could you hold your wife's hand?

490
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:26,651
"My sweet Hyang Soon."

491
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:30,021
- "Soon". - "You are pure and mesmerizing."

492
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:31,791
"I love you."

493
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,321
Could you say that looking into her eyes?

494
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:35,551
I love you.

495
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:39,191
(You're embarrassing me.)

496
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,791
Thank you so much.

497
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,921
Take care then.

498
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,521
Thank you.

499
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:48,761
- The pleasure's ours. - Thank you.

500
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,021
- Take care. - Thanks.

501
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:52,691
I think we have time for one last stop.

502
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:55,021
I think someone's home.

503
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:56,851
Is anyone home?

504
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,851
- Hello. - Hi, ma'am.

505
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:00,951
Hello.

506
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:04,091
Ma'am, is she your daughter?

507
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:06,921
Wait. Play charades with us.

508
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:10,391
Can you play charades with us?

509
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:14,691
Hi, I'm Joon Ho.

510
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,021
- What's your name? - It's Kyu Ri.

511
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:18,421
- Kyu Ri? - I see.

512
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:21,491
If you answer correctly, we can receive food to eat.

513
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,691
You just have to guess the answers.

514
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:25,191
It's okay to get it wrong.

515
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:26,821
Ready, go.

516
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:29,691
Who teaches classes in school?

517
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:30,691
- What was that? - The teacher.

518
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:31,761
That is correct.

519
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:34,451
It's an animal that hangs from a tree like this.

520
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:37,321
- Its nose is black. - Three syllables.

521
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:38,451
- Its fur is gray. - A koala bear.

522
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:42,321
Where do you go when your teeth hurt?

523
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:43,591
The dentist.

524
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:47,591
(They'll receive another dish thanks to clever Kyu Ri.)

525
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:49,991
Kyu Ri, thank you so much.

526
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:52,291
You're a genius.

527
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,321
- Do you have ramen? - Yes, we do.

528
00:19:54,321 --> 00:19:56,691
- Let's take that. She can cook it for us. - Ramen?

529
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:59,891
Ma'am, can you cook us some ramen?

530
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,321
We're a real nuisance.

531
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:04,621
You have only 8 minutes. Get it done within 8 minutes.

532
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,821
Ma'am, we have only eight minutes.

533
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:09,421
That can be done.

534
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:11,291
(She even adds in clams.)

535
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,021
(While the ramen cooks...)

536
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:16,261
"Kyu Ri, you're the future..."

537
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:18,151
- "Leader." - I like that.

538
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,221
- It's good. - You have five minutes left.

539
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,891
Ma'am, five minutes!

540
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:24,991
It's cooking right now.

541
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,261
See? It's cooking away.

542
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:33,321
(She cooks it as if it's for her own children.)

543
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,021
- Thank you so much. - We love you.

544
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:41,051
- Bye, Kyu Ri. - Always be healthy, ma'am.

545
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:42,121
Take care.

546
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:43,991
We did so well.

547
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:47,451
(They return to base with food from the locals.)

548
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:48,991
- Tae Hyun. - Yes?

549
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:51,051
- Good job. - You too.

550
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,821
The others should receive a penalty. They're not here.

551
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,221
- Just so you know, we gave up pork belly. - Exactly.

552
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:59,851
- My goodness. - Ma'am!

553
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:01,951
You can't leave just yet.

554
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:04,261
- Hello, ma'am. - Hi.

555
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:08,151
- Hello. - One Night Two Days.

556
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:09,851
- Nice to meet you, ma'am. - This is our team.

557
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,421
- Look who it is. - This is Jong Min.

558
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:15,551
- We'll get right to the game then. - Right.

559
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:17,761
- Let's go. - I'm worried that I won't get anything.

560
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:19,921
You can do it. Everyone else managed to do so.

561
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:22,591
Your time starts now.

562
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:24,651
Someone who can't sing.

563
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:26,261
- He can't carry a tune. - A tone-deaf.

564
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:28,521
- Nice. - That is correct.

565
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,451
Which network does our show air on?

566
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:32,191
- The Korea... - Which network are we on?

567
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,191
KBS1.

568
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,991
- KBS1. - That is correct.

569
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:37,221
- Next question. - Come on.

570
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:38,391
She said "KBS1".

571
00:21:38,391 --> 00:21:39,651
- Then... - KBS2.

572
00:21:39,651 --> 00:21:40,821
- Omit the number. - KBS.

573
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:42,021
That is correct.

574
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:44,491
What do you take when you can't poop?

575
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:45,951
- It's a medicine. - A medicine.

576
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:47,451
- You're almost there. - Constipation medicine.

577
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,751
(Success!)

578
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:52,321
You did great, ma'am.

579
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:54,621
- Thank you. - That was amazing.

580
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:57,691
- Can we come inside? - Can we?

581
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:00,551
We asked after stepping inside the house.

582
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:02,051
Are those strawberries?

583
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:04,591
We'd love that.

584
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,551
Argus eggs are very good for you.

585
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:09,491
You and your husband should try some.

586
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:11,391
(While Jong Min writes a poem,)

587
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:12,691
(the husband makes the coffee.)

588
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:14,721
Sir, that's more than enough.

589
00:22:14,721 --> 00:22:15,951
We're fine with just that.

590
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:17,891
I boiled a whole pot of water though.

591
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:21,121
(He ends up giving everyone a cup.)

592
00:22:21,891 --> 00:22:23,951
- Here you go. - This wasn't necessary.

593
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:26,321
Are you going to take it away? He made it for us.

594
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:29,191
- He's right. - I'll only allow one cup.

595
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:31,591
(Take that!)

596
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:34,821
You all should have a cup of coffee too.

597
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:35,821
Thank you, sir.

598
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,191
(He makes sure the staff all gets one too.)

599
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:39,391
It's not easy to notice the entire staff.

600
00:22:40,051 --> 00:22:41,191
(Meanwhile...)

601
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:43,051
Goodness.

602
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:44,791
(She's making fried eggs with blue eggs.)

603
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:47,851
(It's all so that they can have a warm dinner.)

604
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:51,521
- You should leave some for yourselves. - It's okay.

605
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:53,151
Please keep a few.

606
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:55,021
- Here. - It's all right.

607
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:56,891
No, we won't accept it.

608
00:22:56,891 --> 00:22:59,321
- You have a big crew. - It's okay.

609
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:01,651
- Take this then. - We're good.

610
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:02,651
Don't forget the salt.

611
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:05,451
- Take care. - Thank you.

612
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:06,491
Thank you!

613
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:09,991
- Make way. - Make way!

614
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:12,821
I'm worried that we have too much.

615
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:14,051
(They return to base with a generous amount of food.)

616
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:17,391
Now it's time for you to have dinner.

617
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:19,121
I hope your boxes are full.

618
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:21,721
We were able to feel the generosity...

619
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,321
- and love of the locals. - I agree.

620
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,891
- They wanted to give us more. - Right.

621
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:28,921
- It was hard saying no. - I know.

622
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,291
I'm happy that...

623
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:34,151
we were able to write them heartfelt poems.

624
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:36,321
Even if they didn't have food, I wouldn't care.

625
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,291
I was glad I could give them something.

626
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:39,921
You gave them something?

627
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:42,021
I don't even know what I'm saying.

628
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,021
I'm so hungry.

629
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:45,191
Joon Ho needs to eat something.

630
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:46,451
I know.

631
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:47,991
He didn't eat a single meal today.

632
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:49,421
All right.

633
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:51,721
Let's see what kind of food you got.

634
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,251
- Joon Ho and Tae Hyun. - We got...

635
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:55,251
What's that?

636
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:58,091
This is amazing. We got this at the first try.

637
00:23:58,091 --> 00:23:59,451
- At the first try? - Is it good?

638
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,321
We got jeon.

639
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:05,521
- Gosh. - We got a good one at the first try.

640
00:24:05,521 --> 00:24:06,551
I can't believe this.

641
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:08,251
- Jeon? - Is it warm?

642
00:24:08,251 --> 00:24:10,321
I'm not sure if I should let you see this.

643
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:11,691
Defconn would be very excited.

644
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:13,151
What? What is it?

645
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,851
- It's pork belly meat. - Gosh.

646
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:16,251
Pork belly meat?

647
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:19,321
(When they were at Young Jun and Hyang Soon's house...)

648
00:24:19,321 --> 00:24:20,851
("You never know your luck".)

649
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:22,251
I should give them pork.

650
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:23,851
- Pork? - Did she say pork?

651
00:24:23,851 --> 00:24:24,851
Do you have pork?

652
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:27,691
(She gave them two hunks of pork belly beat.)

653
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:29,891
How could you get those?

654
00:24:29,891 --> 00:24:32,391
We even got a frying pan to cook it.

655
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:33,451
That's amazing.

656
00:24:33,451 --> 00:24:34,591
Where did they get it?

657
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:36,051
This is the last one.

658
00:24:36,451 --> 00:24:37,721
When we didn't have enough time,

659
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:39,951
I told them we didn't have rice and kimchi.

660
00:24:39,951 --> 00:24:41,391
- Did you get soup? - What kind of soup?

661
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:43,221
It's ramyeon.

662
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:44,651
- Ramyeon? - She even cooked it for us.

663
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,091
- Ramyeon? - Yes.

664
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:48,321
It smells great.

665
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:50,851
Is that it?

666
00:24:50,851 --> 00:24:51,921
- Yes. - We should hurry.

667
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:53,191
I don't want our ramyeon to get soggy.

668
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:55,021
It's our turn.

669
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,421
- You have a lot of kimchi. - You'll be excited.

670
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,021
You can eat this with pork belly meat.

671
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:01,651
- Is it green onion kimchi? - Green onion kimchi.

672
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:02,991
Look at the color.

673
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:04,221
It's a lot.

674
00:25:04,991 --> 00:25:07,291
You should have left some for her.

675
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:08,451
- Why did you get it all? - You took it all.

676
00:25:08,451 --> 00:25:09,651
You should have got a portion of it.

677
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,291
I told her not to give us all of it,

678
00:25:11,651 --> 00:25:14,451
but she insisted on giving all of it to us.

679
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:16,291
- We had no choice. - What is he doing?

680
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:19,021
You can also eat this with pork belly meat.

681
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:20,521
It's aged kimchi.

682
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:21,751
It's kimchi again.

683
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:23,991
- That's not true. - All you have is kimchi.

684
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:25,851
- It'd be too salty. - Right.

685
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,451
What's that? It's spring vegetables.

686
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:30,091
This is spring vegetables.

687
00:25:30,091 --> 00:25:31,191
- Spring vegetables? - It's good.

688
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:34,321
It's very savory because of sesame oil.

689
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:35,991
I'm sorry, but are you eating them without rice?

690
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:39,191
I don't think you have this.

691
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:40,221
Is it rice?

692
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,321
It's rice.

693
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:43,421
- It's a lot. - Rice with beans.

694
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:45,651
It wasn't easy to get rice as they usually cook rice...

695
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:46,721
- just before they eat. - Right.

696
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:48,091
It was hard.

697
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:50,991
That's very tempting.

698
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:52,691
It'd go well with our food.

699
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:54,291
All right.

700
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,151
I don't think Jong Min has any food.

701
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:57,791
You'll be surprised to see what I have.

702
00:25:57,921 --> 00:25:58,921
We have...

703
00:25:58,921 --> 00:25:59,991
- Show us. - First.

704
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,051
(What food do they have?)

705
00:26:01,051 --> 00:26:02,691
At our first try,

706
00:26:03,151 --> 00:26:05,321
we met a big fan of Jong Min.

707
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:06,751
That's right.

708
00:26:06,751 --> 00:26:08,121
In fact, there was a small controversy.

709
00:26:08,621 --> 00:26:10,151
The answer was panties, but she said undies.

710
00:26:11,191 --> 00:26:12,491
They are the same though.

711
00:26:13,591 --> 00:26:14,621
(The food they get is...)

712
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:15,791
- Fried eggs. - Undies?

713
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:16,991
- Wow. - Yes!

714
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:18,551
There's more.

715
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:22,021
Do you remember the color of these eggs?

716
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:23,651
- What's that? - These are blue eggs.

717
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:24,691
Blue eggs.

718
00:26:24,691 --> 00:26:26,451
They grew it themselves.

719
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,691
We got fried eggs and boiled eggs.

720
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:29,991
Why did you bring them all?

721
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:31,791
She insisted giving us all.

722
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:33,621
That's a good one.

723
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:34,651
It must be delicious.

724
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:38,621
We got dried whole persimmon kept in the fridge.

725
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:40,091
It tastes like dried whole persimmon sherbet.

726
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:42,221
- Sherbet? - It's cool.

727
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:43,951
- It must be delicious. - It's dried whole persimmon.

728
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:45,421
It melts away in your mouth.

729
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:47,251
- It's good. - I tried it earlier.

730
00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:48,721
And...

731
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:50,421
Jong Min, take this.

732
00:26:50,621 --> 00:26:52,121
This is for dessert.

733
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:53,791
All you have is desserts.

734
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:55,621
Why is that?

735
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:57,751
- They are very fresh strawberries. - Why?

736
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:59,391
- Is that it? - Wait.

737
00:26:59,391 --> 00:27:01,451
Will you eat only fruits?

738
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:02,991
- Do you have something else? - Yes.

739
00:27:02,991 --> 00:27:04,451
We have something more.

740
00:27:04,451 --> 00:27:06,191
On the way back to the base camp,

741
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,921
we got some ramyeon.

742
00:27:08,151 --> 00:27:09,321
That's good.

743
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:11,751
Are you going to eat them uncooked?

744
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:13,121
(Frozen)

745
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:14,151
How are you going to eat it?

746
00:27:14,151 --> 00:27:15,591
Well, I will...

747
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:17,721
That's ridiculous.

748
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:18,851
Are you going to eat pork belly meat raw?

749
00:27:18,851 --> 00:27:20,551
- You won't get a pot. - So we brought...

750
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:21,721
this frying pan to cook it.

751
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:23,691
- You should have brought a pot. - I won't eat yours.

752
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:26,651
There was a controversy over this ramyeon.

753
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:27,691
- What? - Why?

754
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:29,291
All right.

755
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:32,151
Defconn and Jong Min...

756
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:35,651
arrived at around 6:30pm.

757
00:27:35,651 --> 00:27:37,521
- Stop it. - What's going on?

758
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:38,751
Why would you say that?

759
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:40,291
I said you had one hour.

760
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,291
You were late.

761
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,651
- That's not true. - Hey.

762
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:43,721
If they told me time was up,

763
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:45,321
we would have come in time.

764
00:27:46,191 --> 00:27:48,121
The director told us...

765
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:49,751
- it was okay to get more food. - Right.

766
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,821
But I gave you one hour.

767
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:52,921
If you told us we were going to be late,

768
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,991
we would've come in time.

769
00:27:54,651 --> 00:27:55,791
He's right.

770
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:59,121
We had to stop cooking ramyeon as the time was up.

771
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:00,621
We had only two minutes left, we came running.

772
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:01,691
Then you should have...

773
00:28:01,691 --> 00:28:03,451
brought the ramyeon uncooked.

774
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:05,591
We just came back without stopping anywhere.

775
00:28:05,591 --> 00:28:07,021
I didn't know that either.

776
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:08,491
- Let's take a seat. - We should listen to him.

777
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:09,521
Why are you doing this to me?

778
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,551
I overreacted.

779
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:12,221
- He said he overreacted. - Listen to him.

780
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:15,621
As Jong Min and Defconn arrived late,

781
00:28:15,621 --> 00:28:19,391
we should take back the ramyeon.

782
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,651
We will give you something else.

783
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:24,591
This is the main dish.

784
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,551
We'll give you dried whole persimmon.

785
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:27,651
Dried whole persimmon.

786
00:28:27,651 --> 00:28:30,021
The residents gave them to you, so I won't take it.

787
00:28:30,191 --> 00:28:32,751
But you'll have to share it with other members.

788
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:34,091
- Dried whole persimmon? - No, ramyeon.

789
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:35,221
- That's nice. - Yes!

790
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:36,421
(It's a windfall for other members.)

791
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:39,091
We should share all the foods.

792
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:41,721
- We can't do that. - Give us some rice.

793
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:42,851
Instead,

794
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:44,851
I will give you a pot.

795
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:46,221
That's good.

796
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:47,651
We'll cook it and share it with you.

797
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:49,691
- That's good. - Our ramyeon is getting soggy.

798
00:28:49,691 --> 00:28:50,921
Can you wrap it up?

799
00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:52,121
I don't want to eat their ramyeon.

800
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:54,151
Now you may start eating dinner.

801
00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:58,751
(Despite their unannounced visit,)

802
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:01,251
(the local residents greeted them with a warm smile.)

803
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:08,051
(They gave the members more than enough food.)

804
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:13,591
(Thanks to their loving hearts, the dinner is ready.)

805
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:16,821
(Joon Ho and Tae Hyun got ramyeon, pork, and jeon.)

806
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:19,291
(Dong Gu and Joon Young got kimchi and baby aster.)

807
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:21,791
(Jong Min and Defconn got all sorts of desserts.)

808
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:25,321
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

809
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:26,851
The ramyeon has seafood in it.

810
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:27,921
Seafood?

811
00:29:29,121 --> 00:29:30,551
(He tastes ramyeon first.)

812
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:31,891
This is delicious.

813
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:34,251
(Blowing)

814
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:36,091
(Joon Ho skipped meals the whole day.)

815
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:37,151
Wow!

816
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:39,051
It's so good.

817
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:40,421
(He lets out exclamations of delight.)

818
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:42,851
Joon Ho.

819
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:44,991
We have six fried eggs here.

820
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,191
I want to share them with other members.

821
00:29:47,191 --> 00:29:48,791
- I see. - I'll give you some eggs.

822
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:49,821
That's nice.

823
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:50,921
If you insist,

824
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:52,591
I'll barter with you.

825
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,391
- We have boiled eggs too. - Okay.

826
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:56,291
We have fried eggs.

827
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:57,421
These are boiled eggs.

828
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,691
It looks good.

829
00:29:58,691 --> 00:29:59,721
(Although they don't have much,)

830
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:01,321
(they share what they have with others.)

831
00:30:01,521 --> 00:30:03,791
Bring some of it.

832
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:06,151
(It is now a decent meal.)

833
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:07,751
Can I get more rice?

834
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:09,191
- Do you want more? - Is it kimchi?

835
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:10,321
(They share the residents' love.)

836
00:30:10,651 --> 00:30:11,721
Enjoy.

837
00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:13,591
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

838
00:30:13,651 --> 00:30:14,921
Thank you for the food.

839
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:16,691
Thank you.

840
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:17,951
Here you are.

841
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,021
They have various kinds of jeon.

842
00:30:21,891 --> 00:30:23,591
- This is delicious. - I like this.

843
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:24,651
Right.

844
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:27,521
(It's hot!)

845
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:28,821
What is this?

846
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:30,291
This is so good.

847
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:32,851
They are so generous.

848
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:34,921
I'll eat it with green onion kimchi.

849
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:38,691
- Wow. - It's so good.

850
00:30:38,691 --> 00:30:40,051
(He eats pork with green onion kimchi.)

851
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:41,421
This is great.

852
00:30:41,421 --> 00:30:42,991
It's amazing.

853
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,951
(Everyone feels happy eating dinner.)

854
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:48,251
This is like a party.

855
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:49,451
He's right.

856
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:50,551
Help yourself.

857
00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:51,591
I'll eat this.

858
00:30:52,321 --> 00:30:53,391
(Satisfied)

859
00:30:53,391 --> 00:30:54,451
This is nice.

860
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:56,121
How does it taste?

861
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,121
It's like homemade food.

862
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,591
It's the taste of love.

863
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,191
You're eating love?

864
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,921
I eat a lot of instant food.

865
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:06,051
And I eat Western food a lot too.

866
00:31:06,051 --> 00:31:07,621
It's so good to eat some homemade food.

867
00:31:07,891 --> 00:31:08,891
I know.

868
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:09,951
(They missed Korean food.)

869
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:11,721
She cooked this jeon...

870
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:14,051
for her husband.

871
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:16,321
She put all the ingredients on skewers...

872
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:18,691
for her husband.

873
00:31:19,191 --> 00:31:22,091
- Right. - I'd say I'm eating her love.

874
00:31:23,691 --> 00:31:24,921
That was poetic.

875
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:27,491
I'm eating her love.

876
00:31:27,491 --> 00:31:28,551
(Love is all around the tables.)

877
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:29,851
Are strawberries in season now?

878
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:32,051
Look at the strawberries. They are so red.

879
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:33,791
- It's so good. - It's so red.

880
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:34,851
It's delicious.

881
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,921
They are so fresh.

882
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:37,291
Did they add food coloring or what?

883
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,491
I love the color.

884
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:40,591
It looks like a strawberry...

885
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:43,691
on a cake covered with syrup.

886
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:44,791
You're right.

887
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:46,791
Did they add food coloring or what?

888
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:48,221
I love the color.

889
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:51,721
It's very sweet.

890
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:53,791
I love it.

891
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:56,091
We have to finish all the food.

892
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:58,021
I love the strawberries.

893
00:31:58,521 --> 00:32:00,491
Thank you for the food.

894
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:01,591
- Thank you. - Thank you.

895
00:32:01,651 --> 00:32:02,991
Thank you very much.

896
00:32:02,991 --> 00:32:04,091
We really enjoyed it.

897
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:09,521
(After dinner, they are gathered in the village hall.)

898
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:12,251
We have six poets here.

899
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:13,451
We are traveling...

900
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:14,951
in Hadong with the poets.

901
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:16,651
- Are we still poets? - Of course.

902
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:17,721
- Are we still poets? - Yes.

903
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:18,851
I didn't know that.

904
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:21,321
So we brought in...

905
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:24,221
real poets this time.

906
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:26,321
- Gosh. - You're lying.

907
00:32:26,451 --> 00:32:27,991
I won't fall for that.

908
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:29,291
Stop it.

909
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:32,991
Before meeting famous poets,

910
00:32:32,991 --> 00:32:37,551
you will appreciate their poems.

911
00:32:37,551 --> 00:32:38,691
Bring it in.

912
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,291
What's that?

913
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:43,121
I know what it is.

914
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:44,521
Is it a children's poem?

915
00:32:45,691 --> 00:32:50,421
(It has cute drawings and poor handwriting.)

916
00:32:51,091 --> 00:32:53,451
(They seem to be children's poems.)

917
00:32:53,951 --> 00:32:55,121
Are these children's poems?

918
00:32:55,121 --> 00:32:56,121
I don't think so.

919
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:58,221
I think mothers wrote them.

920
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:00,991
He's right. It'd be children...

921
00:33:00,991 --> 00:33:03,191
or old ladies who just learned Hangul.

922
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:06,091
(Who on earth wrote those poems?)

923
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,451
It looks like children's writing.

924
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:09,521
I want you to read the poems one by one.

925
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:13,151
Pooping, can you read out one of the poems?

926
00:33:14,621 --> 00:33:16,921
"I was going to sow beans,"

927
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:19,221
"but I had to study Hangul..."

928
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:23,491
"so I came running hurriedly."

929
00:33:23,491 --> 00:33:26,721
"I'll sow the rest later."

930
00:33:27,991 --> 00:33:30,691
"I think pheasants will peck at my poem..."

931
00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:32,851
"as well as my beans."

932
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:34,151
I know what that means.

933
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,851
Is that a pheasant?

934
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:37,621
- It is. - It's a pheasant.

935
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:41,291
It means that a pheasant ate all the beans.

936
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:43,551
What does the last part mean then?

937
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:46,091
(What could it possibly mean?)

938
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:47,751
I think it means "like mine".

939
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:49,691
"I came running hurriedly" sounds so cute.

940
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:52,491
- "I came running hurriedly". - To study Hangul.

941
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:55,451
So she was on her way to learn Hangul.

942
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:59,251
It looks like she just learned to write.

943
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:01,291
- Kang Jeom Soon. - Read the next one.

944
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,951
It's by Lee Soon Ja.

945
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:05,721
Tae Hyun, please read it.

946
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:06,721
"Lee Soon Ja."

947
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:10,391
"I planted cucumber and eggplant."

948
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:12,991
"They grew quickly and bore many fruits."

949
00:34:12,991 --> 00:34:15,121
"I started studying at Jeongdong School..."

950
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:17,661
"when I was 72 years old."

951
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:20,821
"I'm very grateful for the two teachers..."

952
00:34:20,821 --> 00:34:23,491
"and I'm going to study diligently."

953
00:34:23,491 --> 00:34:26,691
"If there's a good path I should follow,"

954
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:29,121
"I will without asking questions."

955
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:32,891
- It shows her determination. - It's great.

956
00:34:32,991 --> 00:34:35,921
It's a nice illustration. She drew it so well.

957
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:37,521
Do you see those eggplants?

958
00:34:37,691 --> 00:34:40,321
- She seems to be artistic. - She must be.

959
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:43,551
We have the last poem here.

960
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,921
- "In the World". - Dong Gu will read it.

961
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:49,551
"The best words in the world are..."

962
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:51,851
"from the teachers."

963
00:34:52,021 --> 00:34:54,791
"The best faces in the world are..."

964
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,451
"the smiling faces."

965
00:34:56,851 --> 00:35:00,321
"My face reflected in the mirror smiles."

966
00:35:00,451 --> 00:35:03,661
"My teacher's face is pretty like a flower."

967
00:35:04,321 --> 00:35:08,191
The teacher must be so happy.

968
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:09,891
She's very loved by her students.

969
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:12,591
She expressed herself using...

970
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:14,621
- auditory and visual imagery. - What?

971
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:16,851
She described faces and sounds.

972
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:17,891
Pardon?

973
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:22,391
Let's bring out Jeongdong Village's poets.

974
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:23,661
Please come out.

975
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:25,291
- They're here. - The ladies.

976
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,621
Ma'am.

977
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:29,291
(Hadong Jeongdong Village's...)

978
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:31,391
(3 female poets enter.)

979
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:34,121
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

980
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:36,021
- It's good to see you. - Hello.

981
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:37,021
(They greet people one by one.)

982
00:35:37,021 --> 00:35:39,551
- Hi, Jeom Soon. - Hello.

983
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:40,791
Goodness.

984
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,391
Please introduce yourselves.

985
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:45,321
Hi, I'm Kim Gil Ja.

986
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:48,721
Welcome everyone. Thanks for coming.

987
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:53,091
- Hello. - I'm Kang Jeom Soon.

988
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:56,721
Hello, ma'am. And?

989
00:35:56,791 --> 00:36:00,391
- Hi, I'm Lee Soon Ja. - Hi.

990
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:04,851
You came all the way for three old ladies.

991
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:07,391
Don't say that. We were so moved.

992
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:08,591
Your poems are beautiful.

993
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:12,121
- You're embarrassing me. - I'm serious.

994
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:15,391
You must be learning to write.

995
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:16,661
Are you learning to write?

996
00:36:16,661 --> 00:36:20,051
- Yes. Twice a week in the evening. - Okay.

997
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:24,091
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays. - I see.

998
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:26,891
(Class is held at a village hall twice a week.)

999
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:30,891
(The village elderly has Hangul lessons.)

1000
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:32,821
Please take a look.

1001
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:35,451
(She's their passionate teacher.)

1002
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:39,891
(The students are even more passionate than her!)

1003
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:41,991
(I got a perfect score!)

1004
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:45,491
(This is Jeongdong Village's Hangul School.)

1005
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:49,391
Did good things happen after you learned Hangul?

1006
00:36:49,391 --> 00:36:51,391
- Of course. - You're now able to read.

1007
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:56,191
Before I couldn't write letters or send texts...

1008
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:59,921
- to my kids or grandchildren. - I see.

1009
00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:04,291
It was so frustrating. I heard they taught Hangul.

1010
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:08,991
So I decided to learn it no matter what...

1011
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:12,891
and study as hard as I could until I'm able.

1012
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:15,021
- You're amazing. - I'll stop only when I can't walk.

1013
00:37:15,021 --> 00:37:18,721
You wrote "Studying is needed in my life".

1014
00:37:18,851 --> 00:37:21,051
You mentioned it in your poem.

1015
00:37:21,191 --> 00:37:23,191
- Ma'am. - Yes?

1016
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:27,161
I guess you hated pheasants when you wrote that.

1017
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,691
Of course. I planted beans...

1018
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:32,121
and they kept eating them.

1019
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:33,551
- Pheasants ate them? - Yes.

1020
00:37:33,661 --> 00:37:36,891
- Were you late for your class... - Yes.

1021
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:39,951
because you went to plant beans?

1022
00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:42,291
I tried to make it on time.

1023
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:44,661
Is that why you ran super hard?

1024
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:47,491
- I did. - That part was great.

1025
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:50,721
Ma'am, there's something we don't understand.

1026
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:52,851
What does the last line mean?

1027
00:37:52,851 --> 00:37:56,291
- This last phrase. - We don't understand.

1028
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,491
They're eating my poems too.

1029
00:37:58,491 --> 00:38:00,661
- I see. - They're eating her poems.

1030
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:03,091
- That's very poetic. - They're eating the poem.

1031
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:05,291
The pheasants are eating the beans...

1032
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:07,191
and also her poems.

1033
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:08,751
They're eating up her time too.

1034
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:09,751
(Everyone is surprised by her ingenuity.)

1035
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,821
- She is really creative. - That's amazing.

1036
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:15,891
That poem written by Kang Jeom Soon...

1037
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:19,191
won the Flower Prize at the national elderly...

1038
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:21,591
exhibition of illustrated poems.

1039
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,091
(She won the Flower Prize.)

1040
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:26,291
- Flower Prize. - She deserves it.

1041
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,291
- Her poems is beautiful like a flower. - Yes.

1042
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:29,721
- A flower-like poem. - Yes.

1043
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:32,621
She's a fan of One Night Two Days.

1044
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:35,391
- I always watch it. - She was so happy to see us.

1045
00:38:35,391 --> 00:38:37,291
Do you watch it every week?

1046
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:39,491
Yes. I watch it every day.

1047
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:41,251
Which one do you like the most?

1048
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:43,321
What? I love you all. You're all funny.

1049
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,391
But please pick one.

1050
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:47,791
- What? - Please choose one.

1051
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,661
(Who's Jeom Soon's favorite?)

1052
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,451
It's so nice to see everyone here. I'm happy.

1053
00:38:53,451 --> 00:38:56,191
- Thank you. - I'm so happy.

1054
00:38:56,191 --> 00:38:58,491
You're all funny. I like you all.

1055
00:38:58,491 --> 00:39:00,221
She likes us all equally.

1056
00:39:00,391 --> 00:39:04,551
We have three poets with us.

1057
00:39:04,621 --> 00:39:06,851
Today's "Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors" game...

1058
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:11,491
will be played with Jeongdong Village poets.

1059
00:39:11,491 --> 00:39:15,321
It's "Poem under the Moonlight".

1060
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:16,751
- It's a poetry reading. - Poetry reading.

1061
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:19,921
It'll be a poetry reading under the moonlight.

1062
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:21,591
Poetry reading on a rainy night.

1063
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:23,491
How do we play?

1064
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:27,551
1 poet and 2 members will make a team...

1065
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:31,021
and write a poem.

1066
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:34,191
We'll make the teams now.

1067
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:37,251
- You guys... - Is it like before?

1068
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:41,391
prepared gifts for the poets, right?

1069
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:43,661
- Yes. - What?

1070
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:45,661
(Did we prepare gifts?)

1071
00:39:45,661 --> 00:39:46,751
- Before... - That's right.

1072
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,661
(Who did?)

1073
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:51,491
- Before coming here... - That's right. Yes.

1074
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:54,661
- I see. - Yes. We prepared them.

1075
00:39:54,891 --> 00:39:56,621
(It can't be.)

1076
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:57,851
- We had to do that. - Yes.

1077
00:39:57,851 --> 00:39:59,291
(You jerks.)

1078
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:00,551
That's right.

1079
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:04,721
(You said you'd give us nice gifts if we worked hard.)

1080
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:07,021
(That's why we ran...)

1081
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:08,291
He almost got him.

1082
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:15,551
(and endured unbearable pain.)

1083
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:19,891
(Gifts were acquired after hard work.)

1084
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:23,121
(That's why we couldn't take the gifts.)

1085
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:25,291
That's why you didn't let me put it in my trunk.

1086
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:27,091
Are you talking about the coffee mix?

1087
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:28,661
(Dumbfounded)

1088
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:30,691
You're taking the gifts away.

1089
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:34,551
What do you mean? You earned those...

1090
00:40:34,551 --> 00:40:36,391
for these ladies.

1091
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:37,821
(We can't tell the ladies...)

1092
00:40:37,821 --> 00:40:38,991
(they can't have the gifts.)

1093
00:40:38,991 --> 00:40:40,891
I have a really great gift.

1094
00:40:40,891 --> 00:40:42,021
(He feels bitter.)

1095
00:40:42,321 --> 00:40:45,451
- It's a massage mat. - Look at his face.

1096
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:47,321
(I already decided where to put it.)

1097
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:49,251
- Please bring out the gifts. - Bring them.

1098
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,251
(Here they come.)

1099
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:54,251
(He's dispirited.)

1100
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:57,251
(They prepared various gifts...)

1101
00:40:57,251 --> 00:40:59,121
(without meaning to.)

1102
00:41:00,051 --> 00:41:02,621
All right. Here are all the gifts.

1103
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:06,091
As you see, there a massage mat.

1104
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:07,391
(Tae Hyun's gift is a massage mat.)

1105
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:10,891
Joon Ho brought detergent.

1106
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:13,521
- It's a set of detergents. - It's clean.

1107
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:16,161
Si Yoon prepared...

1108
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:20,191
- a gift card. - It's worth 300 dollars.

1109
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:22,491
You can use this when you go grocery shopping.

1110
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:24,591
- Joon Young prepared... - It's gold.

1111
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:27,321
- It's a gold necklace. - It's real gold.

1112
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,921
- It's solid gold weighing 7.5g. - Goodness.

1113
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,661
(Laughing)

1114
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:34,791
You didn't smile when you saw my gift.

1115
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:37,121
But you're all smiling now.

1116
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:40,191
I can't help but smile after seeing gold.

1117
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:43,851
- Well... - There's toilet paper too.

1118
00:41:43,991 --> 00:41:45,091
(She doesn't even look.)

1119
00:41:45,091 --> 00:41:47,521
This is really... Ma'am.

1120
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:49,291
- Please look here. - Yes.

1121
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:50,551
(She shows no interest.)

1122
00:41:51,491 --> 00:41:54,291
Ma'am. I have coffee mix.

1123
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:55,821
(Okay. You can drink it.)

1124
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:57,991
Great. Thank you.

1125
00:41:57,991 --> 00:42:00,091
- It's gold colored coffee mix. - Okay.

1126
00:42:00,091 --> 00:42:01,391
(I have a lot of those at home.)

1127
00:42:01,391 --> 00:42:03,251
- All right. - Got it.

1128
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:06,551
First, the ladies will choose...

1129
00:42:06,551 --> 00:42:09,991
one of three of you with the nicer gifts.

1130
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:12,991
(They pick a paper with their names on it.)

1131
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:15,291
Just pick any one.

1132
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:17,021
Okay. The first team.

1133
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:19,291
- All right. - Dong Gu and Lee Soon Ja.

1134
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,991
Kim Gil Ja is with Jung Joon Young.

1135
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:23,391
Kang Jeom Soon is with Cha Tae Hyun.

1136
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:27,051
- Okay. - Kim Gil Ja gets the gold!

1137
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:30,321
(Gil Ja will have the gold she so wanted.)

1138
00:42:30,391 --> 00:42:32,491
- I'm sorry. - Everyone's happy.

1139
00:42:32,491 --> 00:42:33,991
(Now they choose the less nicer gifts.)

1140
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:35,921
Let's just pick in order.

1141
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:37,991
- Defconn. - Goodness.

1142
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:40,191
Kim Gil Ja is with me.

1143
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,851
- Okay. - Lee Soon Ja is with Jong Min.

1144
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,121
- It's all good. - His is detergent.

1145
00:42:45,121 --> 00:42:48,851
(The final teams of "Poem under the Moonlight".)

1146
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:49,921
Daily supplies.

1147
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:52,991
I will tell you the topic of...

1148
00:42:52,991 --> 00:42:55,291
"Sleeping Indoors or Outdoors".

1149
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:56,791
The topic for your poem is...

1150
00:42:58,091 --> 00:42:59,951
My Story.

1151
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:02,821
- "My Story"? - My Story.

1152
00:43:02,821 --> 00:43:05,291
The ladies will write poems...

1153
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,751
based on the lives they led.

1154
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:08,821
Do we write it?

1155
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:12,591
The ladies will write the poems.

1156
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:15,991
You will draw pictures.

1157
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:19,021
- You can help them with pictures. - We can color.

1158
00:43:19,021 --> 00:43:23,491
All right. You'll go to your partner's house.

1159
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:27,491
You'll write poems there and reconvene here after.

1160
00:43:27,491 --> 00:43:28,991
(They'll start writing their poems for the reading.)

1161
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:30,751
(Off to the ladies' houses.)

1162
00:43:31,021 --> 00:43:33,321
Let's go, ma'am. Where is your place?

1163
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:34,321
(After the fun meeting)

1164
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:36,721
We'll go to your place now.

1165
00:43:36,721 --> 00:43:38,591
(Joon Ho and Joon Young head to her house.)

1166
00:43:39,551 --> 00:43:42,591
Today's theme is "my story".

1167
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:44,951
- It makes me worried. - It has to be your story.

1168
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:45,951
I'm worried.

1169
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:47,321
(She's worried about the theme.)

1170
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:49,221
It'll be hard to turn it into a poem.

1171
00:43:49,221 --> 00:43:51,091
It's not an essay, but a poem.

1172
00:43:51,091 --> 00:43:53,221
I think if she starts writing,

1173
00:43:53,821 --> 00:43:55,421
it'll naturally become a poem.

1174
00:43:58,091 --> 00:43:59,991
As I study,

1175
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:03,491
I'm not sure when enough is enough.

1176
00:44:04,621 --> 00:44:06,621
The pleasure of learning is great, right?

1177
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:07,891
It is great.

1178
00:44:08,651 --> 00:44:10,121
That's why I thought I should learn...

1179
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:13,191
- no matter how hard it is. - You're right.

1180
00:44:15,191 --> 00:44:16,991
- We're here. - This must be your house.

1181
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:18,221
Yes. This is my house.

1182
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:21,651
- What is that? - All right. Hi, doggy.

1183
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:23,321
I think you surprised the dog.

1184
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:27,091
No. We're just guests. All right. Don't bark.

1185
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:29,951
Gosh. Here is her work.

1186
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:32,521
She made drawings.

1187
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:34,851
She made drawings here.

1188
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:37,821
- She won many awards. - She did.

1189
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:39,691
I see you won a grand prize.

1190
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:42,191
"Hadong Adult Literature Education Awards".

1191
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:43,721
You won it with your poem.

1192
00:44:44,021 --> 00:44:45,621
It was on our local newspaper.

1193
00:44:46,721 --> 00:44:49,691
You were on the newspaper? You're famous here.

1194
00:44:49,691 --> 00:44:51,991
- No, I'm not. - Here it is.

1195
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:55,151
Here. "Illustrated poems that show what life is".

1196
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,951
The newspaper bannered an article about you.

1197
00:44:56,951 --> 00:44:59,521
It's my poem about a pheasant pecking my writing.

1198
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:03,691
- We have to write a poem now. - We do.

1199
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:05,191
I know. What should we write about?

1200
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:08,151
- We'll think of something as we talk. - Yes.

1201
00:45:08,151 --> 00:45:09,191
I'm sure we will.

1202
00:45:09,191 --> 00:45:11,451
- Hello. - Please let us look around a bit.

1203
00:45:11,451 --> 00:45:12,551
Sure. Go ahead.

1204
00:45:12,651 --> 00:45:15,591
- Can you show us around? - There isn't much to see.

1205
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:18,051
- Thank you. - Sure.

1206
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:19,491
(It's a private space of one person.)

1207
00:45:19,491 --> 00:45:21,991
- It's nice. - I'm sorry it's a bit messy.

1208
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:24,621
- Hold on. Is that your husband? - Yes.

1209
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:27,391
That's his portrait I drew.

1210
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,591
You drew this yourself?

1211
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:30,591
- The teacher helped me. - Still.

1212
00:45:30,591 --> 00:45:31,751
(She drew her late husband's portrait.)

1213
00:45:31,751 --> 00:45:32,821
You're a good painter.

1214
00:45:32,821 --> 00:45:35,251
You drew it on November 30, 2011.

1215
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:36,991
- She looks pretty. - Look at this picture.

1216
00:45:36,991 --> 00:45:38,151
(They looks for a new side of her.)

1217
00:45:39,251 --> 00:45:40,721
When was this?

1218
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:42,251
It's a long time ago.

1219
00:45:42,591 --> 00:45:45,321
That was at the Chrysanthemum Festival in Asan.

1220
00:45:45,821 --> 00:45:47,721
(Their conjugal affection is shown on it.)

1221
00:45:47,721 --> 00:45:49,291
- We were in Asan. - With your husband?

1222
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,321
Yes.

1223
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:53,721
(It brings back her old memories.)

1224
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:56,691
Do you have any old pictures?

1225
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:58,551
I'm not sure if it's here.

1226
00:45:59,221 --> 00:46:00,291
I have to look for it.

1227
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:01,821
Let's take a look.

1228
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,151
This is a very old photo album.

1229
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:07,091
- Shall we see it in the living room? - Okay.

1230
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:09,721
- All right. - Hi, kitty.

1231
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:12,251
- Adle, come here. - Hi, kitty.

1232
00:46:12,251 --> 00:46:13,391
- What's his name? - Adle.

1233
00:46:13,391 --> 00:46:14,551
- Adle? - Yes.

1234
00:46:14,551 --> 00:46:17,851
I heard it's a name of a singer in a faraway country.

1235
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:19,391
- You mean Adele. - Yes. Adele.

1236
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,391
- It's Adele. - It's Adele.

1237
00:46:21,621 --> 00:46:25,291
(She's a world-class singer who won two Grammy awards.)

1238
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,321
- I thought she said, "Adle". - It's Adele.

1239
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:30,551
- Adele. - Adele.

1240
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:31,891
(I'm shy.)

1241
00:46:32,621 --> 00:46:34,951
- All right. Now, this is... - Gosh.

1242
00:46:34,951 --> 00:46:37,091
the life story of Kim Gil Ja, the poet.

1243
00:46:37,091 --> 00:46:39,221
Gosh. Don't call me a poet.

1244
00:46:39,221 --> 00:46:41,521
- Let's take a look. - All right.

1245
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:42,791
It has all her memories.

1246
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:44,021
When was this?

1247
00:46:44,321 --> 00:46:45,651
It's a very long time ago.

1248
00:46:46,191 --> 00:46:48,551
- It was around the time we got married. - I see.

1249
00:46:48,551 --> 00:46:51,021
- Were you 20 when you got married? - No. I was 22.

1250
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:52,951
- You got married when you were 22? - Yes.

1251
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:55,391
How did you meet your husband?

1252
00:46:55,751 --> 00:46:57,391
It was an arranged marriage.

1253
00:46:57,391 --> 00:46:58,391
- It was arranged. - Yes.

1254
00:46:58,391 --> 00:47:01,121
- How old was your husband then? - He was 27.

1255
00:47:01,421 --> 00:47:03,221
These are pictures of him when he was young.

1256
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,221
(In the faded photo album,)

1257
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:05,291
Aren't they?

1258
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:06,791
(there are moments of his youth.)

1259
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:08,051
- Gosh. - This is him.

1260
00:47:08,721 --> 00:47:10,021
This is your husband, right?

1261
00:47:10,021 --> 00:47:11,391
(I miss those days.)

1262
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:17,221
Why don't you tell us about the old days?

1263
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:18,991
The old days?

1264
00:47:18,991 --> 00:47:22,191
Let's hear about Poet Kim Gil Ja's love story.

1265
00:47:22,191 --> 00:47:24,751
- We should hear it. - There was no love back then.

1266
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:27,021
- We lived the way we were told to. - Really?

1267
00:47:27,021 --> 00:47:30,321
Our parents told us when we should get married,

1268
00:47:30,321 --> 00:47:32,551
and whom we should marry.

1269
00:47:32,551 --> 00:47:34,621
There was no such thing as love.

1270
00:47:34,621 --> 00:47:35,821
All right.

1271
00:47:35,821 --> 00:47:37,391
"There is no love."

1272
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:38,791
"There is no love."

1273
00:47:39,021 --> 00:47:40,021
(Laughing)

1274
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,691
- Love is... - Gosh.

1275
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:44,051
- Love does exist. - Really? I'm sorry.

1276
00:47:44,051 --> 00:47:46,721
Love does exist. That's not what I meant.

1277
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:49,651
I'm just saying we weren't in love when we met.

1278
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:53,421
When you first met your husband,

1279
00:47:53,721 --> 00:47:55,991
how was his first impression?

1280
00:47:55,991 --> 00:47:57,851
- My husband was handsome, - Yes.

1281
00:47:57,851 --> 00:47:59,251
but I wasn't pretty. If he had seen me,

1282
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,691
he wouldn't have married me.

1283
00:48:01,221 --> 00:48:02,691
He married me because he hadn't seen me.

1284
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:04,221
Did you get married without meeting?

1285
00:48:04,221 --> 00:48:05,321
We did.

1286
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:06,391
We did.

1287
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:08,891
That's how things were back then.

1288
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:11,791
You just promised to marry each other without meeting.

1289
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,891
- That's right. - How about before the wedding?

1290
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,721
- Please be honest. - I made a hole on the door,

1291
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:18,791
and took a peek.

1292
00:48:18,991 --> 00:48:21,691
- A hole on the door? - In the countryside,

1293
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:23,121
the doors are made with paper.

1294
00:48:23,121 --> 00:48:25,651
- You can make holes. - We could make holes.

1295
00:48:25,821 --> 00:48:26,891
(He loves this kind of things.)

1296
00:48:26,891 --> 00:48:27,921
It's true.

1297
00:48:27,921 --> 00:48:30,021
I hope you'll include this in your poem.

1298
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:31,991
- "Secret"... - "Secret Love".

1299
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:33,121
(They think of the same title.)

1300
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,321
"Secret Love".

1301
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:36,921
Please show us what you did.

1302
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:40,121
- Gosh. - Please make a hole.

1303
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:41,521
You made a hole.

1304
00:48:41,521 --> 00:48:43,391
- And... - Go around, Joon Young.

1305
00:48:43,391 --> 00:48:45,221
- He was standing over there. - Okay.

1306
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:47,321
- I was peeking like this. - Hold on.

1307
00:48:47,321 --> 00:48:49,491
Were your friends there with you?

1308
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:51,691
Many people were there including the matchmaker.

1309
00:48:51,691 --> 00:48:53,221
I'll be the matchmaker then.

1310
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,721
Let's see.

1311
00:48:56,051 --> 00:48:58,921
It's the man standing on the yard. He's the one.

1312
00:48:58,921 --> 00:49:00,121
I didn't want to marry him.

1313
00:49:00,691 --> 00:49:03,591
I suddenly felt I didn't want to marry him,

1314
00:49:03,591 --> 00:49:05,551
but the matchmaker insisted that I should.

1315
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:07,651
All right. I just...

1316
00:49:07,651 --> 00:49:10,451
- got inspiration. - That's what happened.

1317
00:49:11,021 --> 00:49:13,891
Place the paper closer to the camera.

1318
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:16,921
There is something peculiar about the sight.

1319
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:19,691
- Is it? What do you mean? - Move it a bit.

1320
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:20,951
- Isn't it the same? - No.

1321
00:49:21,321 --> 00:49:22,951
(He somehow looks handsome.)

1322
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:26,691
It makes your heart flutter a bit.

1323
00:49:26,691 --> 00:49:28,951
- It really does. - If you peep through the hole.

1324
00:49:28,951 --> 00:49:30,021
You must've felt thrilled.

1325
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:32,521
I didn't really know. I was too young.

1326
00:49:32,521 --> 00:49:34,251
Gosh, but you did take a peek.

1327
00:49:34,251 --> 00:49:37,751
I did take a peek, but I didn't really feel anything.

1328
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:40,051
I was only 22. I didn't know anything.

1329
00:49:40,051 --> 00:49:41,251
(You must've been thrilled.)

1330
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:44,651
Be careful. The water is dropping here. There's a step.

1331
00:49:45,451 --> 00:49:47,821
(It's a cozy and peaceful house of an old couple.)

1332
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,291
(Her study is in the corner.)

1333
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:51,451
- Is this the room? - Yes.

1334
00:49:51,751 --> 00:49:53,551
- Gosh. - This is her study.

1335
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:57,321
(It's filled with the pleasant smell of books.)

1336
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,491
She must study here. She's amazing.

1337
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:01,821
(It's her cozy study.)

1338
00:50:02,391 --> 00:50:04,321
(She wrote each character carefully,)

1339
00:50:04,521 --> 00:50:06,591
(and studied hard every day.)

1340
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:09,021
- I can see that... - It's a lot.

1341
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:11,891
Yes. There are sketchbooks,

1342
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:13,491
and many books...

1343
00:50:13,491 --> 00:50:15,691
- she studied. - This is a notebook.

1344
00:50:15,691 --> 00:50:17,091
We'll put these aside for now.

1345
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:18,921
Are these all poems?

1346
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:20,921
- We studied... - Gosh. It's your new poem.

1347
00:50:20,921 --> 00:50:24,451
We studied last night, and the teacher...

1348
00:50:24,451 --> 00:50:27,621
told me to write it, so that's what I wrote.

1349
00:50:28,151 --> 00:50:29,251
Is it okay to take a look?

1350
00:50:29,821 --> 00:50:31,921
It's just embarrassing.

1351
00:50:33,121 --> 00:50:35,521
- It shows her sensibility. - Yes.

1352
00:50:35,521 --> 00:50:36,621
Gosh, I think...

1353
00:50:37,421 --> 00:50:40,321
She is a poet of love.

1354
00:50:41,651 --> 00:50:43,891
"The person I love the most is..."

1355
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:47,421
"my husband whom I've whispered love..."

1356
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:50,821
"under the same blanket. I love him the most."

1357
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:53,851
- "Under the same blanket". - It's embarrassing.

1358
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:55,791
I'm too old for that. I'm embarrassed.

1359
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:58,951
- Hello, sir. - Gosh. We must've woken you up.

1360
00:50:58,951 --> 00:51:00,421
- Hello, sir. - Gosh.

1361
00:51:01,021 --> 00:51:02,851
(It's her husband, the love of her life.)

1362
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,421
What do you like about him so much?

1363
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:07,551
The person I need the most...

1364
00:51:08,321 --> 00:51:09,891
is my husband.

1365
00:51:09,891 --> 00:51:12,251
- Gosh. - I need him more than my children.

1366
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:13,391
You need him more.

1367
00:51:13,721 --> 00:51:14,991
- Of course. - You must really love him.

1368
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:18,151
I think that's the best thing. I really do.

1369
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,091
When were you born?

1370
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:21,891
- I was born in 1944. - I see.

1371
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:25,151
That means you went through the Korean War.

1372
00:51:25,151 --> 00:51:26,821
- Yes. - You went through it.

1373
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:27,921
Could you tell us a bit?

1374
00:51:28,651 --> 00:51:30,491
When the Korean War broke out...

1375
00:51:30,491 --> 00:51:33,091
- Did they attack this region? - They did.

1376
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:36,421
I had just entered elementary school.

1377
00:51:36,421 --> 00:51:37,891
- At that time? - Yes.

1378
00:51:37,891 --> 00:51:40,751
I entered the school in the spring,

1379
00:51:40,751 --> 00:51:44,321
and a plane bombed our school in June.

1380
00:51:44,321 --> 00:51:45,521
- Goodness. - A plane?

1381
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:48,451
I was only a little girl,

1382
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:52,151
and I went to school without knowing anything.

1383
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:55,751
It was a mess with dust and fallen trees.

1384
00:51:55,751 --> 00:51:58,091
- Gosh. - I didn't know where the teachers were.

1385
00:51:58,421 --> 00:52:00,691
That was the last day I went to school.

1386
00:52:00,691 --> 00:52:02,021
(She couldn't go to school anymore.)

1387
00:52:02,021 --> 00:52:04,251
I didn't know how to read and write.

1388
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:05,521
You didn't get to learn.

1389
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:07,521
No. I didn't get to learn.

1390
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:10,621
I thought if I study hard now,

1391
00:52:11,021 --> 00:52:14,751
I wouldn't get lost in the bus at least.

1392
00:52:14,951 --> 00:52:15,951
You're right.

1393
00:52:16,151 --> 00:52:22,921
You have told us many interesting stories.

1394
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:24,991
Is there anything you want to write about?

1395
00:52:24,991 --> 00:52:27,091
I'm thinking about...

1396
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:30,321
how I didn't know how to read and write,

1397
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:32,851
and how I started to learn at this age.

1398
00:52:32,851 --> 00:52:34,291
If I could,

1399
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:37,451
I would learn as much as I can.

1400
00:52:37,951 --> 00:52:40,321
Why don't I write a poem...

1401
00:52:40,321 --> 00:52:41,491
about that?

1402
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,051
(She wants to write about the pleasure of learning.)

1403
00:52:43,051 --> 00:52:44,721
- Gosh. - We're half done already.

1404
00:52:45,421 --> 00:52:49,121
When did you get married? How old were you?

1405
00:52:49,121 --> 00:52:50,991
- I moved here when I was 20. - 20?

1406
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:52,821
- You were 20. - Yes. That's when I moved here.

1407
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:55,891
We were poor back then,

1408
00:52:55,891 --> 00:52:57,991
so I had to work to make a living.

1409
00:52:57,991 --> 00:52:59,851
I had no time to learn how to read and write.

1410
00:52:59,851 --> 00:53:02,291
I see. Did you have to work all the time?

1411
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:04,191
- Yes. All I did was work. - What kind of work?

1412
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:06,251
- It's farm work. We grew bracken. - Farm work.

1413
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:07,721
You missed the chance to learn.

1414
00:53:07,721 --> 00:53:11,321
Yes, I did. I couldn't learn even when I was 20.

1415
00:53:11,651 --> 00:53:14,091
Now you know how to read and write.

1416
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:16,621
Don't you have things you want to do now?

1417
00:53:16,621 --> 00:53:19,051
It didn't matter how capable I was.

1418
00:53:19,051 --> 00:53:22,021
I wanted to learn how to drive,

1419
00:53:22,021 --> 00:53:24,951
but I couldn't take the written test.

1420
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,451
- That's true. - I couldn't get the license.

1421
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:28,951
I wanted to get a driver's license.

1422
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:31,821
- I understand. - That's what I wanted to do.

1423
00:53:31,821 --> 00:53:34,521
After watching taxi drivers drive, I realized that...

1424
00:53:34,521 --> 00:53:35,651
(When she sees taxi drivers...)

1425
00:53:35,651 --> 00:53:37,391
- it's not hard to learn to drive. - Right.

1426
00:53:37,391 --> 00:53:39,621
I can't because I'm not literate.

1427
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:43,251
It can be something about cars.

1428
00:53:43,251 --> 00:53:44,851
Which type of car would you like?

1429
00:53:44,851 --> 00:53:47,121
There's a small Jeep.

1430
00:53:47,121 --> 00:53:49,151
You know what a Jeep is.

1431
00:53:49,151 --> 00:53:50,921
- There's a small one. - Yes.

1432
00:53:50,921 --> 00:53:52,591
- It's a small one. - It's small indeed.

1433
00:53:52,591 --> 00:53:53,721
It's very small.

1434
00:53:53,721 --> 00:53:54,851
It's that color.

1435
00:53:54,851 --> 00:53:56,591
Do you mean this red?

1436
00:53:56,591 --> 00:53:58,051
You also decided on the color.

1437
00:53:58,051 --> 00:54:00,191
I don't know if it's called a Jeep.

1438
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,921
- Do you mean a vehicle that you can load? - A Jeep?

1439
00:54:02,921 --> 00:54:05,251
There is no trunk.

1440
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:06,491
It looks short.

1441
00:54:06,491 --> 00:54:08,551
Right, there's a small one.

1442
00:54:08,551 --> 00:54:12,151
- A red Jeep. - Whom will you ride it with?

1443
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,021
I'll commute to the farm with it.

1444
00:54:15,021 --> 00:54:18,191
You'll park the red Jeep by the farm.

1445
00:54:18,191 --> 00:54:20,391
- You'll drive home after work. - Right.

1446
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:22,091
- Is it for work? - Yes.

1447
00:54:22,091 --> 00:54:23,121
Okay.

1448
00:54:23,121 --> 00:54:26,151
I can see you riding a small, red Jeep.

1449
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:28,091
- I'm not sure. - Is it this car?

1450
00:54:28,091 --> 00:54:29,791
I bet you'll ride it.

1451
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:31,751
Yes, it's the small one.

1452
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:32,851
Right.

1453
00:54:33,051 --> 00:54:34,321
It's a car with four doors.

1454
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:35,321
(You're smart.)

1455
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:36,391
It's this car.

1456
00:54:39,191 --> 00:54:41,321
Will I get to drive a car someday?

1457
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:43,021
Yes, you will.

1458
00:54:44,121 --> 00:54:46,521
Today's title is called "My Story".

1459
00:54:47,321 --> 00:54:49,121
When did you separate with your husband?

1460
00:54:49,421 --> 00:54:50,451
It's been 10 years.

1461
00:54:50,451 --> 00:54:51,521
- 10 years? - Yes.

1462
00:54:54,221 --> 00:54:56,651
Do you still miss him a lot?

1463
00:54:56,651 --> 00:54:59,751
I don't miss him too much.

1464
00:54:59,751 --> 00:55:01,521
I'm close to being 80.

1465
00:55:02,751 --> 00:55:05,051
(She endures another day without him.)

1466
00:55:06,851 --> 00:55:09,521
I have an idea.

1467
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:13,151
What if I write a letter to my husband?

1468
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:15,991
(A letter to her husband?)

1469
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:17,991
(That sounds good.)

1470
00:55:17,991 --> 00:55:19,021
It's a good idea.

1471
00:55:19,021 --> 00:55:20,491
It's an excellent idea.

1472
00:55:20,491 --> 00:55:21,521
Isn't it?

1473
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:23,751
- It's excellent. - I don't have much to say,

1474
00:55:23,751 --> 00:55:25,091
but I'll tell him that I'm well.

1475
00:55:25,091 --> 00:55:26,951
What? Goodness.

1476
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:27,991
(She's a real poet.)

1477
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,191
- What kind of... - It's the best.

1478
00:55:31,191 --> 00:55:32,321
reaction is that?

1479
00:55:33,191 --> 00:55:34,521
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1480
00:55:34,521 --> 00:55:35,691
Sure.

1481
00:55:35,691 --> 00:55:36,791
Will you write what you can?

1482
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,851
Write what you think of, and we'll add on.

1483
00:55:39,091 --> 00:55:40,421
Gosh, my head itches.

1484
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:41,451
(She's nervous.)

1485
00:55:43,251 --> 00:55:44,751
- I don't know how to write. - She's cute.

1486
00:55:44,751 --> 00:55:47,021
That's why I have a headache.

1487
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:51,921
(While Kim Gil Ja writes her poem,)

1488
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:55,991
(Pooping and Blank Page make her a stamp.)

1489
00:55:55,991 --> 00:55:57,021
Please make it for her.

1490
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,621
(The summer night deepens.)

1491
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:02,521
Which pen name will you choose?

1492
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:03,551
She's busy.

1493
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:05,091
Let's give her a pen name.

1494
00:56:05,091 --> 00:56:06,091
How about Adele?

1495
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:07,991
- Adele? - What?

1496
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:09,651
- Kim Gil Ja. - Adele?

1497
00:56:10,091 --> 00:56:11,421
Isn't it good?

1498
00:56:11,421 --> 00:56:13,491
- It's okay. - Her pen name is Adele.

1499
00:56:13,491 --> 00:56:14,791
Pick one that's easy to carve.

1500
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:16,021
Choose a simple one.

1501
00:56:16,151 --> 00:56:17,191
(You carve while I write a poem.)

1502
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:18,721
Adele sounds good.

1503
00:56:19,921 --> 00:56:22,951
(Poet Adele gets in the mood and writes a poem.)

1504
00:56:24,151 --> 00:56:26,621
(She pours her heart into it.)

1505
00:56:28,191 --> 00:56:31,151
(Each word comes from her longing.)

1506
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:35,851
(She writes with sincerity.)

1507
00:56:37,551 --> 00:56:40,851
(Her poem is one of a kind.)

1508
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:46,051
(Her love poem fills a page.)

1509
00:56:47,391 --> 00:56:49,451
This is all I can write.

1510
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:51,521
- Pardon me? - Take a look.

1511
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:53,851
Correct things that are wrong.

1512
00:56:54,391 --> 00:56:58,421
"It's been 10 years since I moved to Hadong."

1513
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:01,121
"I love meat so much."

1514
00:57:01,821 --> 00:57:03,421
(It's an error.)

1515
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:06,121
I meant to write "air".

1516
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:07,421
(She corrects herself.)

1517
00:57:07,421 --> 00:57:08,551
Is meat good?

1518
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:10,121
I meant to say "air".

1519
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:11,321
It's "air".

1520
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:12,521
Is there good meat in Hadong?

1521
00:57:12,521 --> 00:57:13,591
(What's Hadong meat?)

1522
00:57:13,591 --> 00:57:15,021
Do you like beef?

1523
00:57:15,021 --> 00:57:16,421
(Hadong has good meat.)

1524
00:57:16,921 --> 00:57:18,651
I had to write so quickly.

1525
00:57:18,651 --> 00:57:20,321
- I need more time to think. - That's true.

1526
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:21,491
Take your time.

1527
00:57:21,491 --> 00:57:22,651
Do you also like meat?

1528
00:57:22,651 --> 00:57:23,721
Yes, I do.

1529
00:57:23,721 --> 00:57:25,121
Everyone likes meat.

1530
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:26,151
(She makes a confession.)

1531
00:57:27,321 --> 00:57:29,151
(This is Lee Soon Ja's study.)

1532
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:31,321
(She writes about joy in learning.)

1533
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:34,651
Is this your schedule?

1534
00:57:35,221 --> 00:57:36,291
Is it your schedule?

1535
00:57:36,291 --> 00:57:37,321
Yes.

1536
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:41,991
Do you like to exercise and take photos?

1537
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:42,991
(She has a busy schedule.)

1538
00:57:42,991 --> 00:57:44,491
You study until 10pm.

1539
00:57:44,491 --> 00:57:47,091
You haven't written your schedule in April.

1540
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:48,151
No.

1541
00:57:48,151 --> 00:57:49,321
(She writes it on the first day.)

1542
00:57:50,321 --> 00:57:51,491
(He marks something.)

1543
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:54,551
It's at 6:25pm.

1544
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:56,651
It's on KBS2.

1545
00:57:56,821 --> 00:57:58,721
- Is it channel seven? - Right.

1546
00:57:58,721 --> 00:57:59,721
I see.

1547
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:01,921
(She promises to watch the show.)

1548
00:58:02,491 --> 00:58:05,091
(She gets back to her writing.)

1549
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:08,451
(Meanwhile, Jong Min and Dong Gu...)

1550
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:09,451
Look at those.

1551
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:10,991
- May we take a look? - Let's see.

1552
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:12,051
Let's see them.

1553
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:13,691
She studies a lot.

1554
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:15,521
Wait, these are her diaries.

1555
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:17,651
There are diaries and dictation notes.

1556
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:20,051
May we take a look at them?

1557
00:58:20,051 --> 00:58:21,451
It's embarrassing, but go ahead.

1558
00:58:21,451 --> 00:58:22,491
(She's embarrassed.)

1559
00:58:22,491 --> 00:58:23,551
Thank you.

1560
00:58:24,321 --> 00:58:27,251
(They take a sneak peek.)

1561
00:58:27,891 --> 00:58:29,721
(After learning how to write,)

1562
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:35,051
(she writes in her diary every day.)

1563
00:58:36,951 --> 00:58:39,721
"I put out the peppers to dry on the rooftop."

1564
00:58:39,751 --> 00:58:40,991
"After lunch,"

1565
00:58:40,991 --> 00:58:43,451
"I played cards under the tree."

1566
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:44,821
Do you play cards?

1567
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:47,691
(She gets caught.)

1568
00:58:47,751 --> 00:58:50,221
"We had corn and soda,"

1569
00:58:50,221 --> 00:58:53,591
"which the neighbor brought. They were delicious."

1570
00:58:53,591 --> 00:58:54,791
(She put a lot of effort.)

1571
00:58:54,891 --> 00:58:56,921
You'd be a great student.

1572
00:58:57,651 --> 00:59:01,551
That's why she regrets not being able to study.

1573
00:59:01,551 --> 00:59:02,591
I can understand.

1574
00:59:02,721 --> 00:59:04,921
(She finishes writing.)

1575
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:08,621
When you feel amazing,

1576
00:59:09,321 --> 00:59:10,751
you can do this.

1577
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:12,091
Do this.

1578
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:14,391
Try this, ma'am.

1579
00:59:14,391 --> 00:59:16,451
Try it. It's what many young people do.

1580
00:59:16,451 --> 00:59:17,491
That's right.

1581
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:19,191
When you meet your neighbors...

1582
00:59:19,951 --> 00:59:21,551
and they say, "I saw you on TV."

1583
00:59:22,251 --> 00:59:24,491
(Respond with this gesture.)

1584
00:59:24,491 --> 00:59:25,491
Did you see me?

1585
00:59:25,651 --> 00:59:27,191
If they say, "I saw you on TV"...

1586
00:59:27,191 --> 00:59:28,451
Is it funny?

1587
00:59:28,451 --> 00:59:31,021
This is the sign for our team.

1588
00:59:31,021 --> 00:59:32,191
Okay.

1589
00:59:32,191 --> 00:59:34,691
Do you remember your mom?

1590
00:59:35,051 --> 00:59:37,151
Of course I remember my parents.

1591
00:59:37,151 --> 00:59:38,491
- Is that so? - Also,

1592
00:59:38,651 --> 00:59:40,721
- I remember my brother. - Your brother?

1593
00:59:41,521 --> 00:59:43,921
Whom would I call my brother when he's not here?

1594
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:46,521
I can't call him.

1595
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:50,551
Let's say you buy a car after getting your license.

1596
00:59:50,591 --> 00:59:53,851
I know your mother isn't alive anymore.

1597
00:59:53,851 --> 00:59:55,321
Your brother isn't alive, is he?

1598
00:59:55,751 --> 00:59:59,591
Where would you like to go with...

1599
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:01,251
your mother and brother?

1600
01:00:01,451 --> 01:00:03,391
I'd like to go after I learn.

1601
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,851
Where would you like to go?

1602
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,721
I'd take them to sightseeing...

1603
01:00:07,721 --> 01:00:09,591
in the world.

1604
01:00:09,591 --> 01:00:10,591
In the world?

1605
01:00:10,591 --> 01:00:12,121
The world is nice.

1606
01:00:12,121 --> 01:00:15,051
Is there anything they haven't seen,

1607
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:17,421
- Right. but you've seen it?

1608
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:18,751
Is there anything you want to show them?

1609
01:00:18,751 --> 01:00:20,191
The world got better.

1610
01:00:20,191 --> 01:00:22,691
These days,

1611
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:26,991
people take a trip with their parents on the weekend.

1612
01:00:27,451 --> 01:00:29,721
They go to Ssanggyesa or to eat.

1613
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:32,251
My generation couldn't do that for our parents.

1614
01:00:32,891 --> 01:00:34,121
I regret it.

1615
01:00:34,621 --> 01:00:36,921
Would you like to go anywhere?

1616
01:00:36,921 --> 01:00:38,591
I couldn't buy them anything.

1617
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:40,051
I couldn't give them an allowance.

1618
01:00:40,751 --> 01:00:43,621
I regret not being able to do that.

1619
01:00:43,621 --> 01:00:45,751
Have you seen cherry blossoms...

1620
01:00:45,751 --> 01:00:47,091
with your parents...

1621
01:00:47,091 --> 01:00:48,251
when you were a child?

1622
01:00:48,251 --> 01:00:50,051
No, I haven't.

1623
01:00:50,051 --> 01:00:51,521
That's why I regret it.

1624
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,691
These days,

1625
01:00:55,951 --> 01:01:00,051
people take their parents to somewhere nice.

1626
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:02,251
At that time, we couldn't go.

1627
01:01:02,251 --> 01:01:04,551
We couldn't because we were poor.

1628
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:08,191
How about writing something based on imagination?

1629
01:01:08,691 --> 01:01:12,421
How about you write a letter to your mother?

1630
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:13,951
Write a poem for your mother.

1631
01:01:13,951 --> 01:01:15,051
A poem?

1632
01:01:16,051 --> 01:01:18,721
You haven't written anything to your mother.

1633
01:01:18,721 --> 01:01:21,491
Now that you learned how to write,

1634
01:01:21,951 --> 01:01:23,321
you can write something to her.

1635
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:27,051
Now that I learned how to write,

1636
01:01:27,691 --> 01:01:29,021
I can write...

1637
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:31,651
a letter to my mother.

1638
01:01:33,121 --> 01:01:34,191
Then...

1639
01:01:35,851 --> 01:01:38,091
I lived this long.

1640
01:01:39,121 --> 01:01:40,491
I finally write to my mother.

1641
01:01:46,091 --> 01:01:48,721
I lived a good life.

1642
01:01:49,621 --> 01:01:51,191
I'd give you money,

1643
01:01:53,421 --> 01:01:54,851
buy you delicious food,

1644
01:01:54,851 --> 01:01:56,491
and nice clothes.

1645
01:01:56,891 --> 01:01:58,521
I couldn't do them before,

1646
01:01:59,451 --> 01:02:00,851
but finally I can.

1647
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,421
Shall I write that?

1648
01:02:10,021 --> 01:02:12,051
It's my dream. I'll write about my dream.

1649
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:13,091
That sounds good.

1650
01:02:13,491 --> 01:02:16,751
How do I write "red"?

1651
01:02:16,751 --> 01:02:19,121
- Red. - Red.

1652
01:02:19,121 --> 01:02:21,051
- Red? - Yes.

1653
01:02:21,521 --> 01:02:22,721
(She writes carefully.)

1654
01:02:22,721 --> 01:02:24,751
That's correct.

1655
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:26,251
- Is this correct? - Yes.

1656
01:02:26,721 --> 01:02:28,451
What's the next character?

1657
01:02:28,751 --> 01:02:30,691
- Red? - Right.

1658
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:32,421
- D. - D.

1659
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:34,591
- Is it D? - Yes.

1660
01:02:34,591 --> 01:02:36,121
- It's D. - Is this right?

1661
01:02:36,251 --> 01:02:38,821
- Is this right? - D.

1662
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:40,551
- Did you say D? - Yes.

1663
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:46,451
Is this correct?

1664
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:48,321
Red.

1665
01:02:48,321 --> 01:02:50,321
- That looks interesting. - Red Jeep.

1666
01:02:50,321 --> 01:02:51,551
Jeep?

1667
01:02:51,551 --> 01:02:53,321
- J. - It's J.

1668
01:02:53,321 --> 01:02:55,121
- It's Jeep. - Right.

1669
01:02:55,121 --> 01:02:56,751
(Her heart flutters.)

1670
01:02:56,751 --> 01:02:58,051
- Is this right? - Yes.

1671
01:02:58,051 --> 01:02:59,751
That's correct.

1672
01:02:59,751 --> 01:03:01,321
- It's P. - P.

1673
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:03,321
- P. - That's right.

1674
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,751
It's P.

1675
01:03:05,751 --> 01:03:07,691
It's "Red Jeep".

1676
01:03:09,651 --> 01:03:15,021
(They write each letter with sincerity.)

1677
01:03:17,191 --> 01:03:18,651
(What kind of poems did they write?)

1678
01:03:21,191 --> 01:03:22,191
Have a seat here.

1679
01:03:23,451 --> 01:03:24,591
Please sit here.

1680
01:03:24,591 --> 01:03:25,621
(They lead them to comfortable seats.)

1681
01:03:26,621 --> 01:03:28,651
- Here's a blanket. - I don't need it.

1682
01:03:28,691 --> 01:03:29,721
Please take it.

1683
01:03:29,951 --> 01:03:32,391
I'm dressed warmly, so I don't need a blanket.

1684
01:03:33,051 --> 01:03:35,121
It's cold. Let's get under it together.

1685
01:03:35,121 --> 01:03:37,421
- We're good ma'am. - Here.

1686
01:03:37,421 --> 01:03:40,121
- Joon Ho's not cold. - Don't be ridiculous.

1687
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:41,421
We'll cover ourselves together.

1688
01:03:41,421 --> 01:03:43,051
(They get under the blanket together.)

1689
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:45,591
This is how close we've gotten.

1690
01:03:46,151 --> 01:03:48,791
- It's cold. - This isn't necessary.

1691
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,521
- Here. - Thank you so much.

1692
01:03:51,521 --> 01:03:52,521
(Thank you.)

1693
01:03:53,151 --> 01:03:57,221
(Poem under the Moonlight)

1694
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:00,921
Welcome to the first...

1695
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:05,321
One Night Two Days Poem under the Moonlight.

1696
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:06,921
(They'll recite their poems under the moonlight.)

1697
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:09,151
This is nice.

1698
01:04:09,151 --> 01:04:11,221
Am I supposed to read mine in front of everyone?

1699
01:04:11,221 --> 01:04:13,051
First up is Kim Gil Ja.

1700
01:04:13,051 --> 01:04:15,951
Please call her Poet Adele.

1701
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:17,051
(Poet Adele)

1702
01:04:17,051 --> 01:04:18,791
Is she the Adele of Hadong?

1703
01:04:19,251 --> 01:04:21,221
(Adele's my name.)

1704
01:04:22,221 --> 01:04:24,721
I'd like to write a letter to my late husband.

1705
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:25,921
(A letter to her late husband)

1706
01:04:25,921 --> 01:04:27,451
That's a great idea.

1707
01:04:28,051 --> 01:04:30,391
(The words she wasn't able to say to him)

1708
01:04:31,421 --> 01:04:33,491
(She wrote one word after the next.)

1709
01:04:35,021 --> 01:04:37,491
(A poem for her husband)

1710
01:04:39,951 --> 01:04:42,851
You can start by saying the title.

1711
01:04:42,851 --> 01:04:46,021
(Joon Young helps her relax.)

1712
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:48,021
This is "Confession".

1713
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,651
"Dear my husband."

1714
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:54,451
"It's been 10 years since..."

1715
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:56,691
"you left me."

1716
01:04:56,991 --> 01:05:00,891
"It's been 10 years since I moved to Hadong."

1717
01:05:02,051 --> 01:05:05,691
"Thanks to the fresh air here,"

1718
01:05:06,051 --> 01:05:08,821
"I've been able to stay away from hospitals."

1719
01:05:09,321 --> 01:05:12,791
"Life hasn't been bad I guess."

1720
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:15,991
(Life hasn't been bad I guess.)

1721
01:05:15,991 --> 01:05:19,291
"Jeong Yeon, how are you doing over there?"

1722
01:05:20,591 --> 01:05:23,151
"I'm curious..."

1723
01:05:23,891 --> 01:05:25,321
"if you're in good health."

1724
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:29,521
(How are you doing?)

1725
01:05:30,421 --> 01:05:33,951
(Today, I finally get to tell you how much I miss you.)

1726
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:37,421
"I'm curious."

1727
01:05:38,491 --> 01:05:40,821
"Mi Jung, Hyang Sook,"

1728
01:05:41,391 --> 01:05:43,791
"Jin Seok, Bong Seok,"

1729
01:05:43,851 --> 01:05:48,321
"and Jeong Yeon are all doing great."

1730
01:05:48,521 --> 01:05:50,751
"Byung Min and Da Min too,"

1731
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:53,321
"so don't worry about them."

1732
01:05:53,751 --> 01:05:57,391
"I hope you'll hang in there until I join you someday."

1733
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:01,251
"What I wasn't able to tell you in person,"

1734
01:06:01,421 --> 01:06:03,521
"I finally get to tell you..."

1735
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:05,021
"today."

1736
01:06:06,851 --> 01:06:09,421
(The words she wasn't able to say to him.)

1737
01:06:11,091 --> 01:06:14,291
"I love you."

1738
01:06:15,991 --> 01:06:18,751
(She delivered the heartfelt letter very calmly.)

1739
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:22,021
- That was amazing. - It really was.

1740
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:23,691
What an amazing poem.

1741
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:25,421
You wrote a letter.

1742
01:06:25,421 --> 01:06:29,021
- It's for my late husband. - Your late husband.

1743
01:06:29,121 --> 01:06:31,751
(When you profess your love)

1744
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:33,151
(And hug the one you love)

1745
01:06:33,151 --> 01:06:35,921
She said it calmly, but it came from the heart.

1746
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:38,791
- It was sweet. - It was a love poem.

1747
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:39,991
I loved it.

1748
01:06:40,221 --> 01:06:42,951
She bravely read it although she was first.

1749
01:06:42,951 --> 01:06:46,891
- I agree. - It's not something that's easy to do.

1750
01:06:46,891 --> 01:06:49,791
- These represent her and her husband. - The flowers.

1751
01:06:49,821 --> 01:06:51,551
She draw roses.

1752
01:06:52,921 --> 01:06:57,221
Anyway, you just heard from Poet Adele.

1753
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:58,321
Thank you.

1754
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:01,951
She has a pen name too.

1755
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:02,951
It's Velvet.

1756
01:07:02,951 --> 01:07:04,491
(Poet Velvet)

1757
01:07:04,491 --> 01:07:06,751
- She's Velvet. - Velvet.

1758
01:07:06,751 --> 01:07:09,221
- Velvet? - Like Red Velvet?

1759
01:07:09,221 --> 01:07:11,221
She should have one too. How about Blackpink?

1760
01:07:11,221 --> 01:07:14,221
- She loves pink. - Blackpink it is then.

1761
01:07:14,221 --> 01:07:15,421
Blackpink?

1762
01:07:15,421 --> 01:07:17,891
- Next up is... - Blackpink.

1763
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:19,421
(Next up is Lee Soon Ja.)

1764
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:21,391
Poet Blackpink.

1765
01:07:21,391 --> 01:07:23,921
Soon Ja has wrote many poems so far.

1766
01:07:23,921 --> 01:07:25,821
She writes one every day.

1767
01:07:26,691 --> 01:07:29,021
(Her fully packed schedule)

1768
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:32,221
(After she learned how to read and write,)

1769
01:07:32,951 --> 01:07:35,691
(she spent every day enjoying the education.)

1770
01:07:36,491 --> 01:07:39,691
(A passionate student and poet full of joy)

1771
01:07:40,621 --> 01:07:43,891
(She'll write a poem about the happiness of learning.)

1772
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:47,821
(A heartfelt poem)

1773
01:07:48,751 --> 01:07:51,321
(What did she come up with?)

1774
01:07:52,721 --> 01:07:54,291
- Should I start? - Sure.

1775
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:58,721
"A Day as Happy as Today".

1776
01:07:59,521 --> 01:08:02,321
"As a girl, I didn't receive education."

1777
01:08:02,491 --> 01:08:04,391
"I had no friends."

1778
01:08:04,521 --> 01:08:06,651
"I was very lonely."

1779
01:08:06,991 --> 01:08:10,121
"My parents believe that women shouldn't..."

1780
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:11,491
"leave the house at night."

1781
01:08:11,491 --> 01:08:13,991
"So every night after dinner,"

1782
01:08:13,991 --> 01:08:17,051
"my father would stand guard outside..."

1783
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,851
"our front gate."

1784
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:23,121
"Out of loneliness, I cried many nights."

1785
01:08:24,691 --> 01:08:27,491
"Then finally I was offered an opportunity..."

1786
01:08:27,621 --> 01:08:29,821
"to learn how to read and write."

1787
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:33,091
"Studying at Jeongdong School..."

1788
01:08:33,621 --> 01:08:36,591
"brings me such happiness."

1789
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,691
"A day like today."

1790
01:08:39,251 --> 01:08:42,921
"I wish many future days are just as happy as well."

1791
01:08:43,121 --> 01:08:47,221
"Being so happy, I can't help but laugh."

1792
01:08:48,751 --> 01:08:50,921
- My goodness. - It sounded like a confession.

1793
01:08:50,921 --> 01:08:52,491
Her days of crying is over.

1794
01:08:52,491 --> 01:08:54,391
Her crying is now in the past.

1795
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:56,891
I was able to feel just how happy studying makes her.

1796
01:08:56,891 --> 01:08:58,121
(A warm poem that conveys her happiness)

1797
01:08:58,121 --> 01:08:59,961
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

1798
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:01,621
- I knew it'd be good. - Dong Gu.

1799
01:09:01,621 --> 01:09:03,921
- I loved the title too. - She delivered.

1800
01:09:03,921 --> 01:09:06,621
- It was amazing. - I loved how...

1801
01:09:06,621 --> 01:09:08,921
she was able to make it rhyme.

1802
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:11,891
This looks like a sign of a seolleongtang restaurant.

1803
01:09:11,891 --> 01:09:13,251
(A seolleongtang restaurant)

1804
01:09:13,251 --> 01:09:14,791
Don't you agree?

1805
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:18,021
I know. It could be on the menu of one.

1806
01:09:18,021 --> 01:09:22,251
Last but not least, Kang Jeom Soon is up.

1807
01:09:22,251 --> 01:09:25,991
Velvet, it's time to read your poem.

1808
01:09:25,991 --> 01:09:27,891
- Here. - Let's go.

1809
01:09:29,251 --> 01:09:31,821
- What could you write about? - My mother.

1810
01:09:32,121 --> 01:09:35,421
I'd like to write a letter...

1811
01:09:36,691 --> 01:09:38,321
to my mother.

1812
01:09:39,491 --> 01:09:40,591
That...

1813
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:42,421
- It's red. - Right.

1814
01:09:42,421 --> 01:09:44,691
(Thanks to Tae Hyun and Defconn...)

1815
01:09:45,021 --> 01:09:46,391
- Red. - Like this?

1816
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:48,751
(She writes from the heart.)

1817
01:09:49,551 --> 01:09:50,821
It's a red car.

1818
01:09:50,821 --> 01:09:51,991
Yes, a red one.

1819
01:09:51,991 --> 01:09:53,791
(She's always wanted to drive a red car.)

1820
01:09:54,221 --> 01:09:56,421
- Does this look like a person? - It does.

1821
01:09:57,521 --> 01:10:00,921
(She draws a younger self of hers.)

1822
01:10:00,921 --> 01:10:02,621
- In the past? - That's right.

1823
01:10:02,621 --> 01:10:06,121
(A poem that's more like a dream)

1824
01:10:06,851 --> 01:10:10,321
Kang Jeom Soon.

1825
01:10:10,321 --> 01:10:11,751
(It's now time to listen to her dream.)

1826
01:10:14,321 --> 01:10:18,221
"The Red Jeep".

1827
01:10:18,221 --> 01:10:20,021
- Jeep. - "The Red Jeep".

1828
01:10:20,021 --> 01:10:21,991
- "My dream..." - It's how old people say it.

1829
01:10:21,991 --> 01:10:25,491
"My dream is to buy a car."

1830
01:10:26,921 --> 01:10:29,891
"I don't know Hangul very well yet..."

1831
01:10:29,891 --> 01:10:33,121
"which is why I can't dream of getting..."

1832
01:10:33,121 --> 01:10:34,721
"a driver's license."

1833
01:10:36,251 --> 01:10:41,621
"I want to buy a small car though."

1834
01:10:41,621 --> 01:10:45,021
(She wants to but a small car.)

1835
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:49,121
"Mother..."

1836
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:53,391
(Mother)

1837
01:10:54,921 --> 01:10:57,851
"I want to drive..."

1838
01:10:57,851 --> 01:11:00,121
"my mother to places."

1839
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:04,191
"I want to..."

1840
01:11:04,321 --> 01:11:08,321
"I want to go see the cherry blossoms bloom..."

1841
01:11:08,321 --> 01:11:09,921
"in Hwagae."

1842
01:11:10,621 --> 01:11:13,591
"I want to drive..."

1843
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:15,921
"my mother to places."

1844
01:11:17,051 --> 01:11:22,591
"I want to go see the cherry blossoms bloom..."

1845
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:24,251
"in Hwagae."

1846
01:11:24,251 --> 01:11:26,051
("The Red Jeep" by Kang Jeom Soon)

1847
01:11:26,051 --> 01:11:30,221
(She was never able to take her mother to see flowers.)

1848
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:33,991
(She'd love nothing more than to...)

1849
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:40,521
(accompany her mother there at least in her dreams.)

1850
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:45,151
She meant to write "seeing flowers" here.

1851
01:11:46,591 --> 01:11:47,851
What an amazing poem.

1852
01:11:49,021 --> 01:11:50,991
- You did great. - Is it a poem?

1853
01:11:50,991 --> 01:11:53,521
In her dream, she wants...

1854
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:56,191
to buy a car and take off.

1855
01:11:56,591 --> 01:11:59,921
- That's why she drew this. - You did great.

1856
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:00,961
So it's a dream of hers.

1857
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:02,751
Yes. If you look closely,

1858
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:05,591
you'll see her brother and mother.

1859
01:12:05,591 --> 01:12:06,751
Is she behind the wheel?

1860
01:12:06,751 --> 01:12:08,221
That's right.

1861
01:12:08,221 --> 01:12:09,221
(She is driving herself.)

1862
01:12:09,691 --> 01:12:11,151
I love all their drawings too.

1863
01:12:11,151 --> 01:12:14,051
Please give it up for Kang Jeom Soon.

1864
01:12:14,691 --> 01:12:16,491
- Thank you, ma'am. - It was bad.

1865
01:12:16,491 --> 01:12:17,651
No, you did great.

1866
01:12:19,321 --> 01:12:21,151
Here in Jeongdong Village,

1867
01:12:21,151 --> 01:12:23,621
our ears were blessed by masterpieces.

1868
01:12:23,691 --> 01:12:26,991
Tae Hyun, isn't it a wonderful night?

1869
01:12:26,991 --> 01:12:28,121
Now...

1870
01:12:28,421 --> 01:12:30,121
Here...

1871
01:12:30,521 --> 01:12:33,591

1881
01:12:57,791 --> 01:13:00,251
- "The Red Jeep". - Nice.

1882
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,421
We're sorry it's not actually a red Jeep.

1883
01:13:02,421 --> 01:13:04,991

Ma'am, do you remember what I showed you?

1891
01:13:21,221 --> 01:13:22,721
In 1, 2, 3.

1892
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:26,121
(She celebrates with a hip-hop hand gesture.)

1893
01:13:26,691 --> 01:13:28,421

01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:43,191
Defconn taught me this.

1900
01:13:43,191 --> 01:13:45,621
- This? - Awesome.

1901
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:48,691

I'm so embarrassed.

1909
01:14:07,521 --> 01:14:09,321

Thank you so much for the award.

This really makes my day.

I'll remember this...

1915
01:14:20,191 --> 01:14:23,151
for the rest of my life and live happily.

1916

The next is Best Impression Award.

1919
01:14:31,691 --> 01:14:33,821
This award goes to the team...

1920
01:14:33,821 --> 01:14:36,221
that touched everyone's heart with the sincere story.

1921
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:39,621
It's possible that one receives more than one award.

1922
01:14:40,221 --> 01:14:42,721
It's possible Gil Ja doesn't receive any award.

1923
01:14:42,721 --> 01:14:44,891
- Please don't be disappointed. - I'm fine.

1924
01:14:44,891 --> 01:14:46,961
- I'm fine. - One can receive more than one award?

1925
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:49,521
Yes. Soon Ja or...

1926
01:14:49,521 --> 01:14:52,391
- Jeom Soon can receive another one. - I see.

1927
01:14:52,391 --> 01:14:54,121
Best Impression Award.

1928
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:56,721
I wonder who receives it.

1929
01:14:56,721 --> 01:14:57,921
(Best Impression Award)

1930
01:14:58,021 --> 01:15:00,291
- Give it to Gil Ja. - What?

1931
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:01,461

(Kim Gil Ja receives the award.)

1936
01:15:14,421 --> 01:15:16,791
(The poem for her husband touched everyone's heart.)

1937
01:15:16,791 --> 01:15:18,221
I said I don't need to receive one.

1938
01:15:19,091 --> 01:15:21,151
Thank you. Thank you.

1939
01:15:22,021 --> 01:15:23,121
Well...

1940
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:26,721
I'm happy to receive it, although I'm fine without it.

1941
01:15:26,721 --> 01:15:28,521
I'll keep it forever.

1942
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:33,121
I think we were helping them by...

1943
01:15:33,121 --> 01:15:35,391
not doing anything.

1944
01:15:35,391 --> 01:15:36,391
That's right.

1945
01:15:36,391 --> 01:15:38,321

01:15:40,821 --> 01:15:42,891
- Why are you hitting me? - Stop saying that.

01:15:42,891 --> 01:15:44,821
- I'm sorry. - You keep saying that today.
