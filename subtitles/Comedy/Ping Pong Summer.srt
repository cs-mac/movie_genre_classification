1
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,239
Hey, Michelle, do you know
how to make a hard-boiled egg?

2
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,305
Boil it until it's hard?

3
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,479
Yeah, honey.

4
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,159
What are you doing?

5
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,679
Eating dinner?

6
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,799
That's breakfast is what that is.

7
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,119
Oh, my God,
you look disgusting.

8
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,839
Be quiet!

9
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,279
Don't pick on your
brother, Michelle Ann.

10
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,039
He almost really hurt himself.

11
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,199
Yeah, microwaving an egg.

12
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,639
Now we can't go to Ocean City!

13
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,559
You bet your bippy we can.

14
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,719
But I'll look gross!

15
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,919
Dr Miller says if you
keep that cream spread

16
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,519
on your face overnight you'll be
in great shape tomorrow morning.

17
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,199
- No, I won't.
- Sure you will.

18
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,399
You're already looking better!

19
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,839
We're counting down the hits,

20
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,159
the 40 biggest from the
official Billboard charts.

21
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,639
I'm Casey Kasem, this
is America's Top 40.

22
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,759
This family is so embarrassing.

23
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,359
This'll save us having to
buy a whole tank of gas!

24
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,919
I just have to go on duty

25
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,639
if we come across an accident

26
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,399
or a broken down car along the way.

27
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,039
- You guys are so cheap!
- No, we're not!

28
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,519
I don't see you writing any checks

29
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,185
when it's time to pay the bills.

30
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,519
You get into the stupidest things.

31
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,519
Shove it.

32
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,679
Must be not nice to
not have any friends.

33
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,348
Must be not nice to be so not nice.

34
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,039
American Top Forty

35
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,479
Now, we're up to our
Long Distance Dedication.

36
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,039
And this is from a
young man in Louisiana

37
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,519
who had been troubled
by a feeling of guilt-

38
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,359
Mom, turn it up!

39
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,319
He writes, "Dear Casey,
my name is Patrick.

40
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,839
"I'm 19 years old and live
in Cheena, Louisiana.

41
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,439
"My Long Distance Dedication goes
out to my younger brother Jeffrey,

42
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,479
"who is 17 years old.

43
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,279
"2 years ago,

44
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,439
"Jeff was injured
in a swimming accident.

45
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,599
"He and I had gone
to a creek near our home.

46
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,359
"I dove in, and Jeff
dove in after me.

47
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,159
"He was very overweight,
about 5-foot-six,

48
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,319
"weighing 235 pounds.

49
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,519
"His dive was short

50
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,519
"and he hit a clay bank under
the water and broke his neck,

51
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,479
"paralyzing him from the neck down.

52
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,839
"For nearly 2 weeks,
I blamed myself for this,

53
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,159
"but my family and Jeff
helped me understand

54
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,959
"it wasn't my fault.

55
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,919
"In '84, both Jeff and myself

56
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,599
"were away from home at Christmas.

57
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,599
"Jeff was in San Francisco,

58
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,799
"at the Shriner's Crippled
Children's Hospital.

59
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,159
"I was doing 90 days in jail
for drinking and driving.

60
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,559
I don't know think we should
be listening to this anymore.

61
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,719
No, leave it on!

62
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,719
"I turned to drinking to
solve my pain and problems.

63
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,959
As you do.

64
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,719
"In jail at Christmas, I was
allowed to telephone Jeff.

65
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,439
"After I talked to him,
I spoke to Mom.

66
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,359
"I asked her what Jeff needed,

67
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,279
"and she said he wanted to see me.

68
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,719
"This raised my spirits and hopes,

69
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,639
"to know that Jeff was as close
as my heart would let him be.

70
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,239
"Now, that's all the distance is:

71
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,799
"from my mind to my heart.

72
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,839
"So Casey, would you please play
'Hang On' by the Little River Band,

73
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,799
"to let Jeff know that when
I'm released in 4 weeks,

74
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,719
"I'll be there as fest as I can.

75
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,959
This stuff is a bunch of malarkey.

76
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,479
No, they're not!

77
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,319
Says you.

78
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,781
Says Casey.

79
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,919
 Casey's Coast to Coast

80
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,839
Here's the band
that's been performing

81
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,319
in the area of Naragansett,
Rhode Island, since 1972...

82
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,359
13 years,

83
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,559
and lest year they finally hit the pop
charts with the song "On The Dark Side."

84
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,759
Here's John Cafferty and the Beaver
Brown Band with "Tough All Over."

85
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,279
Hey, Ocean City: we're back!

86
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,879
Here we are.

87
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,479
What's that doing there?

88
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,879
You sure this is the right house?

89
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,359
Let's hope not.

90
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,119
Yeah, it's the right place.

91
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,359
Why can't we stay at Sea
Watch like last year?

92
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,439
That was way too expensive.

93
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,279
Mrs. Unland's brother gave us
a good bargain on this place.

94
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,919
But it's bayside.

95
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,439
Then what you do is
you use your legs

96
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,599
and you walk over to Oceanside.

97
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,079
We might as well have
just gone to Deep Creek.

98
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,439
I don't care where we stay!

99
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,399
That's the spirit!

100
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,639
Now, the key's supposed to
be under a crab statue.

101
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,180
I don't know which one.

102
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,119
Brendan, you look like a prowler!

103
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,839
Well, I'm not. I'm a state trooper.

104
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,223
Okay, which one?

105
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,279
Right, that's it, everybody,
off the front porch, now! Now!

106
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,184
Oh no, is it the wrong house?

107
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,265
Eww, gross.

108
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,039
We're sorry.

109
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,741
I guess we got here
a few hours early.

110
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,999
Wash that sink down with
bleach before you use it.

111
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,999
Cool, a record player!

112
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,224
It smells like Grandma's house.

113
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,079
Can I go get an Icee?

114
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,799
You're not going anywhere until
we've finished unpacking the car.

115
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,479
But not alone you're not.

116
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,919
Come on, I'm way old enough!

117
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,879
Well, I guess that might be fine.

118
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,839
Mmm.

119
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,999
We weren't going to give this
to you until we'd settled in a bit,

120
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,399
but here's some money
for you to spend

121
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,987
however you want on this vacation.

122
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,039
Cool.

123
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,599
Hey, Windburn, when's Space Camp?

124
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,879
Are you actually wearing
those as, like, not a joke?

125
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,862
Pshh. You wish.

126
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,319
Wicka-wicka-wicka-wicka!

127
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,839
Who told you it was okay

128
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,439
to mix the flavors like that? Huh?

129
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,839
I'm sorry.

130
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,239
I didn't know it was illegal.

131
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,279
"Illegal"? They're Icees!

132
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,799
I'm just messing with you, dude.

133
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,879
I am bored out of my skulleton.

134
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,319
Now take a sip, fill it to the
top, and take another sip, man.

135
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,639
Don't you know how it's done?

136
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,422
Fill it to the top, sip,
fill it to the top again.

137
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,879
It's not an Icee unless
you sneak a sip first!

138
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,639
Put more cherry in.

139
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,420
You got to get the
proportions right.

140
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,719
You dropped this.

141
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,239
No, I didn't.

142
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,959
Uh, I really think you dropped it.

143
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,759
I already have one.

144
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,919
Man, you can never have
too many spoon-straws!

145
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,119
I guess.

146
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,639
What's your name?

147
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,959
Radford. But everybody
calls me Rad.

148
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,759
I'm Teduardo.

149
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,599
But everyone calls me Teddy.

150
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,061
Cool.

151
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,479
What grade you going into?

152
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,039
9th.

153
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,079
I'm going into ninth too. No way!

154
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,719
Way.

155
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,148
Whoa, is that your
ping pong thingy?

156
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,279
I have one that looks
just like this back home.

157
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,079
I mean, just like this!

158
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,159
You must've been to Fun Hub.

159
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,159
What's Fun Hub?

160
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,239
It's only the coolest place
in the whole wide world!

161
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,679
We got to go right now!

162
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,719
I can't.

163
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,399
I have to go to dinner
with my family.

164
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,599
Well, then let's go tomorrow!

165
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,947
Maybe.

166
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,319
So, you come here every summer?

167
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,319
Usually.

168
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,305
My dad's been bringing me
here since before I was one.

169
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,319
Oh, dag, you live here?

170
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,319
Man, don't go near that
place if you can help it.

171
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,439
What's wrong with it?

172
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,359
The lady that lives there
is a crazy menace.

173
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,759
She ruined five
marriages last summer.

174
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,879
And she eats bushels of crabs
with the shells still on them!

175
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,799
And she taxidermies
surfers in the barn!

176
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,439
Her name's Randi Jammer.

177
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,319
I gotta go.

178
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,799
Meet me at Fun Hub
tomorrow at noon.

179
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,319
It's in the alley behind Anthony's!

180
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,799
Are you sure you don't need this?

181
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,340
Okay, bye Rad!

182
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,839
Are we out here too early?

183
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,439
You think?

184
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,519
Does the sun even work
at this hour?

185
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,999
The sun always works, bud.

186
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,119
That's what's so great about it!

187
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,359
This way we beat the crowds

188
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,389
and get a headstart on the day.

189
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,319
Right, that's it, I'm going in!

190
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,879
Who's with me?

191
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,919
I'm not hot enough yet.

192
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,159
Ahhh!

193
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,719
Fine!

194
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,987
This is how it's done.

195
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,705
Your father is such a stud.

196
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,559
That looks cold.

197
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,199
Hey, Rad.

198
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,399
No way, you listen to rap?

199
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,239
Way.
Do you?

200
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,959
 Do I like rap?
Did you just ask me that? 

201
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,559
 Of course I do
I catch the groove 

202
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,359
 I'm Teddy Fryy
Spelled with two Y's 

203
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,279
 I'll rap and spray
All over your face! 

204
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,879
Fresh.

205
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,599
My dad's a real b-boy.

206
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,639
His boombox is four times the size
of that, I'm not fronting around!

207
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,799
Want to go see it later?

208
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,519
Maybe.

209
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,359
Yeah, my dad breakdances
and everything.

210
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,759
We even got into a break-off

211
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,039
at the bus stop this morning.

212
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,879
It was serious business!

213
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,279
The other guy was pretty good,

214
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,599
but my dad smoked a cigar

215
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,919
while busting a windmill

216
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,399
and that sealed the deal.

217
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,145
Even the bus driver said he won!

218
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,679
It looks like a slaughterhouse.

219
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,903
Are you sure it's safe in there?

220
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,239
Fun Hub's not
a slaughterhouse, Rad.

221
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,429
It's a heaven.

222
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,265
Come on, let's play!

223
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,199
Hey, newbie. What's your name?

224
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,919
Rad. Miracle.

225
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,599
Stacy. Summers.

226
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,199
Sheela. Trix.

227
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,879
Sheela and I were born here,

228
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,919
and we've been friends ever since.

229
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,319
And I don't know where Trix is from.
Somewhere landlocked.

230
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,239
Cool.

231
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,399
All the guys in Maryland
want to hang out with me.

232
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,279
That's pretty cool.

233
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,184
Sometimes.

234
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,744
Um, are you okay?

235
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,780
Totally.

236
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,319
Come on, Rad!

237
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,429
Let's play some ping pong!

238
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,799
I haven't played in a while

239
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,959
so take it easy on me, okay?

240
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,705
Okay.

241
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,787
Whoops.

242
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,199
Well, what do we have over there?

243
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,199
Shit. "Houston, two dildos
have snuck into the cabin

244
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,741
and now we're headed
straight for Uranus!"

245
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,389
Come on, let's just keep playing.

246
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,719
Where've you been?

247
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,479
Where you're not.

248
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,879
What's your problem?

249
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,999
Get off me, perv.

250
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,199
Not until you tell me
what your problem is.

251
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,519
I don't have a problem!

252
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,199
Yes, you do.

253
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,183
Step off her!

254
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,599
"Step off her?"

255
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,159
I can step on her

256
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,465
whenever I want, "bro."

257
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,759
Where's your stupid space pants?

258
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,439
He must've left them at the deli,

259
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,079
with the rest of the
bologna and cheese!

260
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,359
What should
I do to this little guy?

261
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,839
Crush his nads off!

262
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,079
This is my table... renter.

263
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,749
Go play that pancake
paddleball somewhere else.

264
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,119
The Fun Hub is for serious
ping pong players,

265
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,479
not dork wannabes.

266
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,305
He's gimungous.

267
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,319
Who are those two jerks?

268
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,799
Lyle Ace and Dale Lyons,

269
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,959
the richest kids in Ocean City.

270
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,599
Are they a couple?

271
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,599
No, they're just friends.

272
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,999
I meant Lyle and Stacy.

273
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,239
Pshh, they might as well be.

274
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,239
What's wrong with her?

275
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,079
You see that Icee cup she's
always got in her hand, Rad?

276
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,959
Well, that's not an
Icee she's drinking.

277
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,479
It's Funk Punch.

278
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,039
What's Funk Punch?

279
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,959
Funk Punch is when you combine an
Icee with Pop Rocks and Pixie Stix

280
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,359
and sometimes even cocaine
and drink it really fast.

281
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,319
She's a Funk Punch junkie.

282
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,559
But she's so fly.

283
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,719
Are we going to see
my dad's big boombox or not?

284
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,839
I thought that's
what we were doing.

285
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,679
Sounds like him
and his girlfriend Amber

286
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,399
are playing board games again.

287
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,719
I try not to bother
them when they do that.

288
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,599
They get so competitive!

289
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,759
Let's just go to the boardwalk
and play Skee-ball.

290
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,223
I can't. I have to go to
dinner again with my family.

291
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,799
"Our son almost torched
his face off with an egg.

292
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,839
Let's buy him a present!"

293
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,119
- Will you just pipe down, missy!
- Those aren't a present.

294
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,279
If I slice my
finger off with a can opener,

295
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,239
will you guys buy me a car?

296
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,759
- How about you don't come to dinner with us?
- Honey.

297
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,359
How about I would rather not?

298
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,359
Why can't I wear what I'm wearing?

299
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,159
You can't wear a
T-shirt and sneakers

300
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,879
to the Paul Revere Smorgasbord!

301
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,959
Don't move.

302
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,239
Aww, that made a right bloody mess.

303
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,359
- Squashed it all over, look at that.
- Hon!

304
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,839
You wouldn't have thought it'd have
so much blood in it, would you?

305
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,559
Girls really dig dorks

306
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,639
who wear church clothes
to the boardwalk.

307
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,799
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

308
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,799
What are you playing at?

309
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,679
Go on, get out of here! You
can find your own dinner.

310
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,999
Good!

311
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,399
And be back home by 10:30 or the front
door will be locked until the morning!

312
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,384
Ooh, scary threat!

313
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,319
Brendan!

314
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,119
I had enough!

315
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,919
What is she going to eat?

316
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,904
What was that for?

317
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,319
- Brendan!
- What?

318
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,119
I'm just getting started.

319
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,879
You got to get your money's worth.

320
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,039
What about the vegetables?

321
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,479
I can get vegetables
in our backyard, Kendall.

322
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,119
I've never seen any clam strips
growing in our garden, have you?

323
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,679
Nope!

324
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,119
Nope.

325
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,479
Okay, that's enough, you two.

326
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,639
Ooh. Aah.

327
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,239
Okay, first there's the bass.

328
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,319
And then there's the snare..

329
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,959
So you guys try it.

330
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,869
Hey, check this out!

331
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,199
What is that?

332
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,229
It's a tongue worm!

333
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,279
Okay, I'm going to keep a beat.

334
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,039
What are you even doing?

335
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,519
Hey, Brad.

336
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,759
It's Rad.

337
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,479
Hey, Brad.

338
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,639
Do you want to play
a game of ping pong?

339
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,639
No, really. Just one game.

340
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,181
I heard you're really good.

341
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,787
Let's just go.

342
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,599
This should be close!

343
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,279
Can we not do this right now?

344
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,469
Yes, we can do this right now.

345
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,519
Hey, I have an idea.

346
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,300
Let's not warm up.
Let's just volley.

347
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,039
"P"...

348
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,119
"I"...

349
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,239
"N"...

350
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,746
"G."

351
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,421
Aww, yeah!

352
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,079
My serve.

353
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,559
Hey, I just remembered, me and Rad
have to be somewhere very important!

354
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,822
Shut up, you black sissy.

355
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,231
Ready?

356
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,863
1 serving 0.

357
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,063
2 serving 0.

358
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,111
3 serving 0.

359
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,949
4 serving 0.

360
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,559
Yeah!

361
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,862
0 serving 5.

362
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,228
0 serving 6.

363
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,384
0 serving 7.

364
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,107
Yes, Lyle!

365
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,319
0 serving 8.

366
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,301
You're really good.

367
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,749
0 serving 9!

368
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,959
Rad, forget it! Let's just go home!

369
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,750
Play him some other time.

370
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,079
Rad, no!

371
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,759
Would you shut your greasy head up!

372
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,639
Teddy, I'm sorry.

373
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,399
Sorry only counts in church!

374
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,747
Teddy, wait!

375
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,559
Are you done flirting
with your lover now?

376
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,159
You do realize this is game point?

377
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,791
Inseminate him.

378
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,279
Yeah!

379
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,105
Yes, Lyle!

380
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,501
Smells like skunk in here.

381
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,107
What's up?

382
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,504
That was totally bogus.

383
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,471
I know what you need.

384
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,039
Listen, don't pay
any attention to Lyle.

385
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,959
He thinks he, like, owns Ocean City

386
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,919
just because he drives an
IROC and is super rich

387
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,079
and totally hot and
ridiculously talented

388
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,879
at everything he ever does.

389
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,830
That's really yellow.

390
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,439
Cheese makes everything better.

391
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,639
Sugar makes it the best, though.

392
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,104
Shooooooo-gerrrr.

393
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,919
Why do girls date guys like Lyle?

394
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,759
Because they're dumb.

395
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,239
You don't seem dumb to me.

396
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,020
Yeah, well, you don't know me.

397
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,159
Do you "smort" cocaine?

398
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,879
Do I "snort" cocaine?

399
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,239
Yeah.

400
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,399
Why? Who told you that?

401
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,599
I mean, I've heard
some things, but...

402
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,959
Well, you know what's worse

403
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,519
than people who do cocaine?

404
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,799
What?

405
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,959
People who don't do cocaine

406
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,799
but who gossip about people who
might or might not do cocaine!

407
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,750
I have to go to the bathroom.

408
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,239
What's up, space dork?

409
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,319
I heard from a little birdy

410
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,399
that after we left the Fun Hub,

411
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,719
you were eating crab
au gratin with Stacy.

412
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,559
But that couldn't
have been you, right?

413
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,399
I mean, she only
dates white people.

414
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,759
Give it back.

415
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,359
What, this?

416
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,279
I mean, I'm thirsty.

417
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,919
Milk does a body good, right?

418
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,439
It does your body good!

419
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,479
- Stop, Lyle.
- "Stop, Lyle."

420
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,879
You know, you do
look pretty dehydrated.

421
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,359
Awww, gross!

422
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,344
Back off!

423
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,519
No way. The Town
Weirdo is your mom?

424
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,069
Or are you his grandmom?

425
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,021
I think you might
want to leave, buddy.

426
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,949
"Thank you so much for
protecting me, Weird Mommy!"

427
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,479
Thank you.

428
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,519
Put on your khakis.

429
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,959
We're going to your Aunt Peggy
and Uncle Jim's for dinner.

430
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,679
What happened to you, Radford?

431
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,519
Nothing.

432
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,424
I got hot and thirsty.

433
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,239
Do we have to stay long?

434
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,559
Just a while.

435
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,439
They're so creepy.

436
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,239
Why do we
always have to visit them?

437
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,799
Your sister is weird
and her husband is gross.

438
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,199
Hey, Jim!

439
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,119
Ha! Oh, look at that.

440
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,119
The Miracles have la-la-landed.

441
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,159
Let me look at you.
Hey there, sweetheart.

442
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,359
- Hi, Jim.
- Aww, give me a big kiss.

443
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,199
- Oh...
- Mmm.

444
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,039
So beautiful.

445
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,639
Hey there, Miss Vampire.
You need some Vitamin D.

446
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,439
Mmm.

447
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,159
And hey there, sir.

448
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,999
Look at you, you're all grown up.

449
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,399
Maybe not physically, but
you're aging. Right?

450
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,319
You got to let me
in on your secret.

451
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,719
How do you stay looking so young?

452
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,279
I don't know.

453
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,679
Alright, we'll talk
about it, alright?

454
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,319
- Brendan.
- How are you, Jim?

455
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,599
How are you? Welcome
to the beach, sir.

456
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,039
- Welcome!
- Well, what do you looksie!

457
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,519
Aww, there she is.

458
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,999
Hey, sis.

459
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,199
- Peggy, hi!
- You look great!

460
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,239
Mm-hm.

461
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,269
Aww, Brendan.

462
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,839
Ha-ha! That's a kiss.

463
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,959
Yeah.

464
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,599
Mm!

465
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,839
Uh, what happened to you?

466
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,839
Why, you could use
a blood transfusion.

467
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,639
Good to see you, Michelle!

468
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,199
- That's what I said.
- Mister Man.

469
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,239
- Come on!
- Sweet.

470
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,799
- Crab time.
- Well, let's get some crabs!

471
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,101
Mmm!

472
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,239
When did you catch those crabs?

473
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,159
Yesterday, I emptied
the traps yesterday.

474
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,879
Yesterday?
Yes.

475
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,439
Why aren't you eating any crabs?

476
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,559
I'm a vegetarian.

477
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,719
What?

478
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,839
You're what?

479
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,559
Meat is murder.

480
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,359
I'm never eating
another animal again.

481
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,119
But crabs aren't animals.

482
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,229
Well, then what are they?

483
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,479
They're crabs, right?

484
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,559
- Right. Exactly.
- Right.

485
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,919
So, what have you guys been up to?

486
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,599
We haven't been doing a whole heck
of a lot, to tell you the truth, Peggy.

487
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,239
Isn't that what summer
vacation's all about, right?

488
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,079
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

489
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,039
I hope you guys are sunning
yourselves properly.

490
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,359
Because if you want to get,
you know, full coverage,

491
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,159
you want to position yourself so you
want to get the inside of your thigh

492
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,879
and the back of your leg
at the same time, right?

493
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,759
You don't want any tan lines.

494
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,759
You don't just lay flat.
You got to work it.

495
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,599
That's why I have full coverage.

496
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,265
You are so sexy, sweetheart.

497
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,279
Redford made a
new friend named Teddy

498
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,079
and they've been playing
ping pong every afternoon

499
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,719
at the Fun Hub.

500
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,879
- What?
- What?

501
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,799
They've been doing what?

502
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,439
Playing ping pong.

503
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,399
It's like tennis, only smaller.

504
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,119
I believe the real name
is "table tennis."

505
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,999
Oh, I know what frigging
table tennis is, okay?

506
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,239
What I don't get

507
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,799
is why you play an indoor hobby

508
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,479
when you're at the beach.

509
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,439
What's the matter, Rad?

510
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,119
Ocean not good enough for you?

511
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,919
We've been going to the ocean.

512
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,039
It's just, I don't want
to get too much sun.

513
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,119
There is no such thing
as too much sun.

514
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,639
You just need the right lotion.

515
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,430
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

516
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,759
This is from my "Horny
Shell" series, right here.

517
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,479
They take some time
to get just right,

518
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,399
but like most great
art, it is worth it.

519
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,319
You actually sell these things?

520
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,039
- Oh, yeah. They do real good up in Rehobeth.
- Huh.

521
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,639
It's still a little wet at the tip.

522
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,519
And you got the short-and-
curlies around the bottom.

523
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,079
You guys really sleep out here?

524
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,999
I do every night.

525
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,999
Peggy, sometimes she joins
me from time to time.

526
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,719
Obviously, you know, the
mattress that we have inside

527
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,039
is for other things.

528
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,519
You know, the moon provides
a complimentary shade

529
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,999
to, you know, your otherwise
natural daytime tanning base.

530
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,919
If you'll notice,

531
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,839
I have a kind of a blue sheen,

532
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,759
that nobody else has. You know.

533
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,399
Don't you get bit by mosquitoes?

534
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,543
Uh-uh.

535
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,591
They can't get in.

536
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,223
Can we go home now?
I don't feel good.

537
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,839
Redford made a
new friend named Teddy.

538
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,959
They've been doing what?

539
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,919
Would you shut your greasy head up!

540
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,039
Sorry only counts in church!

541
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,503
Would you shut your greasy head up!

542
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,159
Is Teddy here?

543
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,599
No.

544
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,959
Do you know where he is?

545
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,759
No.

546
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,519
Do you know when he's
going to be back?

547
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,231
No.

548
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,959
What's up.

549
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,679
I'm really sorry
about the other day.

550
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,239
Sure.

551
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,119
That was the meanest thing

552
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,919
I've ever said to anybody
in my whole entire life.

553
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,631
I didn't mean it.

554
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,188
Your hair is crazy fly.

555
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,759
So, Teddy, where are you from?

556
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,799
Baltimore.

557
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,199
You like it there?

558
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,559
It's as good a place as any.

559
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,319
What's your favorite thing to do
when you're here in Ocean City?

560
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,639
Hang out at Fun Hub.

561
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,119
What's at Fun Hub?

562
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,199
Everything. It's bad!

563
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,839
Well, why would you
go there if it's bad?

564
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,759
Dad, bad means good.

565
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,319
Well, then why wouldn't
you just say good?

566
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,509
You kids try too hard.

567
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,639
What are you doing?

568
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,351
Tongue worm.

569
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,919
Nice and easy.

570
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,267
Okay.

571
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,439
Ahhh.

572
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,479
Close but no cigar.

573
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,799
Don't be such a competitive creep.

574
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,306
Come on, bud, it's your turn.

575
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,799
Hey, Rad.

576
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,829
Hey, Stacy.

577
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,919
Aren't you going to introduce
us to your friends?

578
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,159
Dad, Stacy Summers.

579
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,879
Stacy Summers, Dad.

580
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,759
Hi, Dad.

581
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,141
Bye, Rad.

582
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,519
She's really pretty!

583
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,599
Dad, would you be quiet?

584
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,982
Ahh, you choked.

585
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,986
Alright, this is a one.

586
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,199
Aww, I hate pirates!

587
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,719
It's not his fault.

588
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,227
Come on, Miss Peppy, you're up.

589
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,826
Come on, sweetie.

590
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,639
Michelle.

591
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,199
What in the Sam Hill was that?

592
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,039
Peppy golf.

593
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,839
Why don't you try to have fun?

594
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,359
I'm too cool for fun!

595
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,479
Michelle!

596
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,439
You come back here and
pick this up right now!

597
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,265
Is it time to eat yet?

598
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,719
Whoa! That was like 50 strokes!
Let's try to get to 500!

599
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,239
- Really?
- Yeah, maybe we could get to 500!

600
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,439
Okay, but try to keep it in play.

601
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,799
No, doy.

602
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,319
Sorry.

603
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,305
Alright, ready? Go!

604
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,319
1.

605
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,519
2.

606
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,559
3.

607
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,679
4.

608
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,599
- 5.
- 6.

609
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,599
7.

610
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,061
8.

611
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,759
32.

612
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,119
33.

613
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,679
- 34.
- 35.

614
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,664
- 36.
- 37.

615
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,559
75.

616
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,799
76.

617
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,199
77.

618
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,359
78. 79.

619
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,661
80.

620
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,106
488. 489.

621
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,879
492. 493.

622
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,103
494. 495.

623
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,119
498. 499...

624
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,111
Man, that close.

625
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,079
Don't try it, Pop Tart,

626
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,310
or you'll know what it's like to
be a little white plastic ball.

627
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,119
That was mature.

628
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,679
Oh, I'm mature, alright.

629
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,479
Oh, he's mature.

630
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,119
You know,

631
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,839
you're not as good
as you think you are.

632
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,825
Oh yeah? Well, how
good do I think I am?

633
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,039
I'm way better than you.

634
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,559
I at least know that much.

635
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,399
Okay. Then let's
play again. Saturday.

636
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,799
See who's the best,
once and for all.

637
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,359
Saturday, huh? Why not now?

638
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,479
We were just rallying for hours.
It wouldn't be fair.

639
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,559
Okay. Saturday.

640
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,479
One game. No excuses.

641
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,828
I don't need any excuses.

642
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,439
What did you just do?

643
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,879
I don't know.

644
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,386
You're crazy!

645
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,599
Hey, there you are!

646
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,319
Whoa.

647
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,039
I told you my dad's
boombox was no joke!

648
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,839
He let you borrow that?

649
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,586
Oh, yeah. He lets me
borrow everything.

650
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,679
Look.

651
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,079
What?

652
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,599
She doesn't have a Funk Punch.

653
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,823
She's probably just hiding it.

654
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,639
Hey, you two.

655
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,919
What are you doing?

656
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,479
Uh, nothing much.

657
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,079
Oh hey, this is my cousin, Rhonda.

658
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,119
She's sleeping over tonight.

659
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,599
Hi.

660
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,079
What's your name?

661
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,399
Teddy.

662
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,879
Hello, Teddy.

663
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,119
His real name's Teduardo.

664
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,959
Hey, you guys should come
to H2O with us tonight!

665
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,479
What's that?

666
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,679
It's the new underage dance club.

667
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,879
They should come, right?

668
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,799
Yeah, why not?

669
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,959
You know how to dance, right?

670
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,599
 I can rap and I can dance 

671
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,759
 In a bathing suit
or in long pants 

672
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,399
 At Fun Hub or in the club 

673
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,351
 I'll show you skeezers
how it is done! 

674
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,031
Dress to impress.

675
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,839
Hey, gang.

676
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,279
Time to take a pose
for a telescope photo

677
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,060
and you can't say no!

678
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,359
And...

679
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,661
Right on!

680
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,559
Rad! Where were you?

681
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,199
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, guy.

682
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,583
Alright, the gang's all here.
Let's go!

683
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,305
"Suicide."

684
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,065
Keep the change.

685
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,679
- So, should we do it?
- What?

686
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,268
Should we do it? Let's dance.

687
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,183
I don't even want
to go home tonight!

688
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,349
Come sit next to me, Rad.

689
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,159
Oh, no.

690
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,110
You're coming with me.

691
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,341
The moon looks def.

692
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,359
I've been wanting
to be alone with you

693
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,426
since I first laid eyes on
your tight bod this afternoon.

694
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,639
I'm going to go pee now.

695
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,066
Have fun!

696
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,959
You can't get away from me.

697
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,599
Get off me, ow!

698
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,359
Where do you think you're going?

699
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,759
Get back here!

700
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,399
Oh.

701
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,668
Have fun with your prude summer!

702
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,039
Where's Teddy?

703
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:52,679
Being a virgin somewhere.

704
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,999
Where's Stacy?

705
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,879
Dropping yellow.

706
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,079
Huh?

707
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,269
Peeing?

708
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,559
Well, so what do you
want to do now?

709
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,119
I don't know, go home I guess.

710
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,799
Home's no fun.

711
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,599
I guess not.

712
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,263
I could think of a trillion funner
things to do than just going home.

713
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,024
Shouldn't you be practicing
for the big showdown?

714
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,639
Nyack, nyack, nyack, nyack, nyack.

715
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,319
Nice space pants, Astra-Nut.

716
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,919
Why the long face?
You got girl problems?

717
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,359
You couldn't get
a girl it you tried.

718
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,919
You're so skinny you got to run
around in the shower to get wet.

719
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,679
You need a fat one.

720
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,519
One that goes.

721
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,039
You couldn't catch a girl

722
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,759
if we tied a bone around your neck!

723
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,879
Loser!

724
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,239
You need that big girl to
come throw the ball for you.

725
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,759
Hey, go get his quarter, don't
let him get out of here!

726
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,159
You alright?

727
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,239
I'm fine.

728
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,119
I don't think so. What happened?

729
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,039
I could've kissed her.

730
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,679
She wanted me to kiss her.

731
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,879
But I chickened out.

732
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,306
And then she kissed Lyle.

733
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,839
Well, that's bad.

734
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,279
Um, but next time,
you should just, uh,

735
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,839
you know, make it simpler.

736
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,639
If you want to kiss her, kiss her.

737
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,399
If you don't want to kiss
her, don't kiss her,

738
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,199
and then, you know, if
she doesn't like you,

739
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,999
well then, you don't
want to kiss her. Right?

740
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,839
- Yeah.
- Okay.

741
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,319
- Sorry for bothering you.
- What's your name, kid?

742
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,519
- Rad.
- Rad?

743
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,159
Rad. Rad.

744
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,999
Well, Rad, you know,

745
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,399
you don't have to apologize

746
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,319
to somebody for bothering them

747
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,479
if they're the one that
started the conversation.

748
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,279
- Okay.
- Okay.

749
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,741
Sorry.

750
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,239
Don't go near
that place if you can help it!

751
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,639
I think you
might want to leave, buddy.

752
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,227
What's your name, kid?

753
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,021
Rad?

754
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,879
Hey.

755
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,799
I'm sorry about the other night.

756
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,279
I got really drunk. I don't
even know what happened.

757
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,079
Well, maybe you should try
to control yourself better.

758
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,639
Look, I'm sorry if I gave you

759
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,159
the wrong idea about us, but...

760
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,079
No, I got the wrong idea about you.

761
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,839
It's not like we were
even close to dating.

762
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,799
You know, Teddy warned
me and he was right.

763
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,741
You're nothing
but a stone-cold skeezer.

764
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,159
That was by far the coolest
thing you've ever done.

765
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,319
Felt pretty cool.

766
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:54,306
Whoa, maybe you actually are cool.

767
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,199
Yo, yo, yo, what's happening,

768
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,799
Ebony and Ivory?

769
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,439
Or is it Ebony and Ebony?

770
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,239
More like Ivory and Ivory!

771
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,599
Hope you've been
practicing, Miracle.

772
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,239
That's a fitting last name,

773
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,959
since you're going to need one.

774
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,343
You should change your
last name to Skunk!

775
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,100
Hello?

776
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,719
You were a ping pong champion?

777
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,119
And a bowling champion
and a hot rod champion,

778
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,639
but you were really
a ping pong champion?

779
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,039
Yeah. So?

780
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,990
Can you help me?

781
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,759
It's time to cut these beauties.
You want to help?

782
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,471
Uh...

783
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:17,079
Well, I loved playing ping pong.

784
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,199
But, you know, to compete,
to be really good,

785
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,719
you just have to
practice all the time,

786
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,999
all the time. I mean,

787
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,079
you can't have vacations

788
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,279
or a social life,
anything like that.

789
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,239
And I hated the tournaments.

790
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,508
It just took all of the
fun out of it for me.

791
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,199
I don't want to become

792
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,707
some world class superstar.

793
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,700
I just really want to beat Lyle.

794
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,519
Well...

795
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,479
I think it'll take one lesson

796
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:57,279
to beat that spoiled
little dipshit.

797
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,786
Let's do it.

798
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,550
Whoa.

799
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,239
What's this?

800
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,759
This is your new paddle.

801
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,279
Here, let's get your finger out.

802
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,039
See that grip? Good.

803
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,879
Show me what you got.

804
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,239
Aren't you going to play with me?

805
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,119
No, you have to beat yourself
before you beat somebody else.

806
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,900
I'm just going to
sit here and drink.

807
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,359
That's it.

808
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,639
The ball making contact, ball making
contact, ball making contact.

809
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,639
That's it. You don't
need crazy spin

810
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,239
or flashy moves, you don't
even need any style, really.

811
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,519
You just have to focus

812
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,319
and watch the ball making contact.

813
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,119
Focus. Ball making contact,

814
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,799
ball making contact, good!

815
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,879
Ball making contact,
ball making contact...

816
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,627
Oh. Try it again.

817
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,719
Oh, you are in your head, man, and
you've got all this negative chatter

818
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,399
that you're thinking,
"I'm so nervous,"

819
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,239
"I don't know what I'm doing,"

820
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,279
"Lyle's too big," "What's Randi thinking?"
You've just got to switch it off, okay?

821
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,079
And reload.

822
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,439
Physically, mentally,
and emotionally.

823
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,639
And you do that by having
a recovery routine.

824
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,679
Every pro has one.

825
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,439
After a point, you go to
your recovery routine.

826
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,279
You might see some pros,

827
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,119
they go up and they touch
the table like that,

828
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,919
or they blow on the ball,
they blow on their palms,

829
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,559
they take their towel
out, maybe all of them.

830
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,319
I used to jump
up-and-down on my toes

831
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:33,639
and then go to my safe zone

832
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,359
and come back and focus.

833
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,279
Got it?

834
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:40,982
Okay, so, what is your
recovery routine going to be?

835
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,639
Okay, well, we don't have
to decide that right now.

836
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,719
Just start focusing. Go ahead.

837
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,341
Ball making contact, there you go.

838
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,301
Good.

839
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,439
That's it.

840
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,199
The ball hitting the paddle.

841
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,319
That's it. Keep it low.

842
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,039
Use a smasher. You don't
want to give it to him.

843
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,599
That's it! The ball making contact, the ball
making contact, the ball making contact.

844
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,439
That's it, now focus, focus.

845
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,359
Good, good!

846
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,959
The ball making contact,
the ball making contact.

847
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,679
That's it, keep your focus.

848
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,559
Keep your focus, that's it.

849
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,559
Keep your focus.

850
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,399
That's it, that's it,
keep your focus.

851
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,679
Good. Okay.

852
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,839
The ball making contact,
the ball making contact,

853
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:45,119
the ball making contact,
the ball making contact,

854
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,559
the ball making contact,
the ball making contact,

855
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,199
the ball making contact,

856
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,946
good, the ball making contact.

857
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,380
Oh, you lost your focus.

858
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,228
Teddy, get in here!

859
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,439
Teddy, this is Randi Jammer.

860
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:11,759
Randi Jammer, this is my
best friend, Teddy Fryy.

861
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,826
Well. Nice to meet you
best friend Teddy Fryy.

862
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,519
Are you going to come tomorrow?

863
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,424
You don't need me there.

864
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,719
Radford.

865
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,719
Radical.

866
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,039
You're not Radford Miracle.

867
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,519
You're Radical Miracle!

868
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,959
And you're...

869
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,999
Teddy Flyy.

870
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,839
And what about you, Randi Jammer?

871
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,030
You're the Rammer!

872
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,701
No.

873
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:05,159
Maybe I could come
visit you in Mount Airy.

874
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:09,545
Or you could come visit
me in Baltimore.

875
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,428
I don't really have
any friends back home.

876
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,066
I don't either.

877
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,227
I wish this summer
didn't ever have to end.

878
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:34,679
Yeah. It was the best summer ever.

879
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,799
But you know what's going
to make it even better?

880
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,279
What?

881
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:43,199
When you cream Lyle tomorrow!

882
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,519
Rad Miracle fold Lyle
Ace he was going to skunk him!

883
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,300
And then he hawked
a loogie on his IROC!

884
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:59,599
One game. One game. No excuses.

885
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,199
What did you just do? You're crazy.

886
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,559
Do you "smort" cocaine?

887
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,999
- I'm going to go pee now.
- Have fun.

888
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,348
Bologna and cheese.

889
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,319
Morning, bud.

890
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,319
Morning.

891
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,759
So, I heard about your
big showdown today.

892
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,550
Who told you?

893
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,399
Teddy told Michelle
and she told us.

894
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,559
Are you going to come?

895
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,439
Do you want us to?

896
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,959
I guess so.

897
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,399
Of course we're going to be there.

898
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,039
Listen, I hear this kid you're
playing is a real punk.

899
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,159
But remember, it's just a game,

900
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,119
and even if you lose,

901
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,599
it's not the end of the world.

902
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,999
It's just not.

903
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,279
We'll love you no matter what.

904
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,279
I just want to beat him so bad.

905
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,399
Bad meaning bad
or bad meaning good?

906
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,067
- Bad meaning both.
- Hm.

907
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,599
Hey Michelle, can you
bring me my coffee?

908
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,159
Bring it yourself!

909
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,799
She's got a mouth on
her, doesn't she?

910
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,959
I'm not asking, I'm telling!

911
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,625
Whatever.

912
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,270
I didn't want to splurge
but your mother insisted.

913
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,479
Come here.

914
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,748
Ohhh.

915
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,719
It was 37 dollars.

916
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,559
- We'll take it out of your pocket money.
- Oh, yeah.

917
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,943
Rad?

918
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,559
You look different.

919
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,239
Listen, I'm so sorry things got
so messed up between us.

920
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,239
But I'm getting my
life back on track

921
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,199
and I'm off the Funk Punch forever.

922
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,319
What about cocaine?

923
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,359
I never did cocaine, Rad.

924
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,159
I guess you could say brain
freeze was my addiction.

925
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:16,519
Then what was the powder you
mixed into your Funk Punch?

926
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,559
That was Pixie Stix.

927
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,879
It doubled the power
of my brain freeze.

928
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,239
But from here on out,
I am Sugar-Free Stacy.

929
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,119
Good for you.

930
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,079
I've also been doing some thinking,

931
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,199
and realize that I think

932
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,239
I genuinely like you.

933
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,079
Well, that's cool, but can
we talk about this later?

934
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,950
I kinda have to play Lyle now.

935
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,039
Kick his ass...

936
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,466
"Radical Miracle."

937
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,230
This place is pretty cool.

938
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,319
Come on, Rad, you got this.

939
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,999
If he hits topspin,
you hit backspin.

940
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,639
If he hits backspin,
you hit topspin.

941
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,679
- Crush him. Crush him.
- If he hits something else,
just hit it over the net.

942
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,319
Everybody's here for you,
except probably those two.

943
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,279
- Look at his stupid space pants.
- Did you see the way Stacy looked at you, too?

944
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,959
I think she really likes you.

945
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,439
- Send him back to Pluto.
- You got this. You've been
using the little paddle,

946
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,479
Now you're going to get the big
paddle and you're going to do great.

947
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,559
- Watch. Ready?
- Remember everything Randi taught you.

948
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:26,879
- And go.
- You got this, Rad, you got this. You ready?

949
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,479
- Another one.
- Ready?

950
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,359
- You really think I can win?
- Kinda.

951
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,106
- And down.
- Ahhh!

952
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:47,879
A twerp paddle for a twerp twerp!

953
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:52,079
- Well, that's just nasty.
- I don't like the look of that fella.

954
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,030
Never trust a redhead.

955
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,279
Did you see the look on his face

956
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,759
when you called him
Radical Miracle?

957
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,519
Win or lose, we're
getting a bushel of crabs

958
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,359
tonight to celebrate.
You're all invited!

959
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,679
Alright! That's enough.

960
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,639
Rad, you look warmed up enough.

961
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,679
Lyle, as always,
you're smoking hot.

962
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,119
Win this thing,

963
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,661
and let's get this over with.

964
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,519
Here you go, honey.

965
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,106
Good luck.

966
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,350
Volley for serve!

967
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,559
"P"...

968
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,719
"I"...

969
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,759
"N"...

970
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,319
"G"...

971
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,065
Yeah!

972
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,550
1 serving 0.

973
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,705
2 serving 0.

974
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,229
3 serving 0.

975
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,265
4 serving 0.

976
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,104
0 serving 6.

977
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,140
8 serving 3.

978
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,467
Ouch.

979
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,359
That wasn't fair.

980
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,025
5 serving 15.

981
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,109
And it's out of here!

01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,199
Shut up!

01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,799
7 serving 18.

984
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,959
Time out!

985
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,559
Get over here.

986
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,559
Oh, so now crazy lady is his coach.

987
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,559
Of course she is.

988
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,746
"Thank you so much for
coaching me, Weird Mommy!"

989
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,999
What are you doing?

990
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,799
Losing, I guess.

991
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,879
Forget about them.

992
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,719
Switch it off. Reload.

993
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,239
You know how to play,

994
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,719
you know what you
have to do to win.

995
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,759
The ball making contact, right?

996
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,559
What you bring to that
table is who you are.

997
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:48,399
You have the power inside
you to do this. You do.

998
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:52,959
Now is the time
to stop being a loser.

999
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,308
Now's the time to kiss the girl.

1000
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,279
So I didn't mean
literally but good.

1001
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,839
You're going to take a breath,

1002
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,479
recovery routine, focus.

1003
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,181
Then beat this prick.

The ball making contact.
The ball making contact.

1008

What is your recovery routine?

The ball making contact,
the ball making contact.

What are you doing?

1011
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,061
Stop breakdancing
and play ping pong!

1012
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,159
Ooh! Yeah!

1013
