1
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:41,583
[Man's Voice] Los Angeles
late at night is much like any
big American city late at night.

2
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,962
At 2:00 a.m. People
are either making a mess
or cleaning it up.

3
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,422
Tonight's my night
to do the cleaning up.

4
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,551
My name, most of the time,
is Irwin Fletcher.

5
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:55,347
I write under the name
ofJane Doe.
That's the kind of gal I am.

6
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,267
This is a Greek seafood house,
part of a very successful chain.

7
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,727
But, believe me,
it's not because of the food.

8
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,730
113,000
from basketball.

9
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,859
List it as codfish.

10
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,904
120,000 from
the Gonzalez fight.

11
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:15,826
That includes 60 from
our chain in the Valley.

12
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,413
Twenty from Long Beach.
120 total.

13
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,624
Put that
under halibut.

14
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,419
180,000
from the track.

15
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,421
Scrod.

16
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,048
We already got over
two million in scrod
this month.

17
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:33,135
Scrod's making a comeback,
all right?

18
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,179
[Man #1]
So how are you listing
my stake?

19
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:39,516
[Man #2] Breakage.
[Man #1]
$ 75,000 worth ofbreakage?

20
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,731
[Glass Shatters]

21
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,859
We're Greeks! We dance,
we break plates, we're clumsy!

22
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,945
[Man #1] Cut the fighting.
We gotta be cross town
in 30 minutes.

23
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,947
You wanna wash up?

24
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,159
[Man #2] Nah. My wife gets
suspicious if I come home and
my hands don't smell like fish.

25
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,369
[Man #1] I got it.
You get the lights.

26
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,372
[Man #2]
Where's Poppa?
[Man #1] In the back.

27
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,334
[Man #2] Tell him to snap it
up. We'll meet him in the car.
Phil, I'll drop you off first.

28
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,836
[Phil]
You better.

29
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:25,604
- [Gasps] Hi.
- What's your name,
little lady?

30
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:30,776
My name? Peggy Lee... Zorba.
Peggy Lee Zorba.

31
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:35,113
- You're cute!
- Do you mind if I
freshen up a little bit?

32
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,741
Splash a little water
on my face.

33
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,202
Whatever makes you
feel sexy.

34
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,746
- Okay.
- [Chuckling]

35
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:46,458
Just wait outside.
I'll be right out.

36
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,399
What the hell was that?

37
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,943
- Jesus.! If it's a cop, kill him.
- Hi. Mary Poppins!

38
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,237
If it's a reporter,
cripple him.

39

[Tires Screeching,
Brakes Squealing]

40
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,839
You're never driving again!

41
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,341
I just did what
you told me to do.

42
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,178
There's a new thing
called brakes.!
Will you shut up.!

43
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,645
Good. Brilliant as usual,
Fletch. We'll run it
in the next edition.

44
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,481
Great. See you
in two weeks.

45
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:57,279
Uh, Fletch, there's...
"Uh, Fletch"? Frank, I see
a double-cross in your eyes.

46
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:00,490
You promised me a vacation
and I'm taking it.
Right after the sewer story.

47
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,619
What are you talking about?
You can't do this to me.

48
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,039
I spent eight nights on my knees
for you dressed like
Dolly Parton at a funeral.

49
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:10,584
I got felt up. I got
dishpan hands and sore knees!

50
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,128
Three guys tried to kill me.
And do you give a crap?

51
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:16,006
You promised me a vacation!
And you're gonna get
a vacation.

52
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,176
As soon as you research and
write the sewer system expose.
You owe me a vacation!

53
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,303
In July you're gonna have it!
That's two months away.

54
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,680
That's why
you're such a great reporter.
You know the facts.

55
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,643
By the way,
the new computer disallowed
your undocumented expenses.

56
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,312
- It'll come out
of this week's pay.
- You can't do that.

57
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,650
There's nothing I can do
about it. It's amazing.
It's all done automatically.

58
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,877
On top of everything else,
I think I'm getting my period.

59
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,449
No wonder I got
a fumigation alert.
How'd you get in here?

60
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,910
The window was open.

61
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:30,622
I knocked, and I could swear
I heard you say, "Come in."

62
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:34,877
You really know how to cover
your ass, Gillet. Although
those pants are a huge mistake.

63
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,424
You owe me $4,381
in back alimony.

64
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,468
What? I was married to you?

65
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:48,432
You're right. I've been
foolishly squandering my salary
on food and heat.

66
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,060
You have one week to comply
with Judge Proctor's orders.

67
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,105
Payment in full.
Otherwise you go to jail.

68
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,524
Wendy doesn't need
the money.

69
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:03,113
I hear she's been... banging
some balding, wimpy lawyer
who can't get it up.

70
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,782
- May I see that?
- Be my guest.

71
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,577
It's a nice briefcase.
Couldn't guess your weight?

72
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,913
Oh! I'm sorry.
I got it.

73
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,373
Never mind,
I'll take care of it.

74
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,293
Look at this. A note from
the Oakwood Potency Clinic.

75
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:21,173
"Sorry to inform you,
our machines cannot process
sperm counts as low as yours."

76
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,634
Here we are.
What about this?
Be careful!

77
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,261
Uh-oh!
I am terribly sorry!

78
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,305
You did that intentionally.
No, I did not.
I really didn't.

79
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,933
That was good juice too.
Leave it alone.

80
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:34,102
Good idea. My mistake.
Where are you going
with that?

81
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,813
My mess.
I'll clean it up.

82
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,982
- What are you doing?
- What's this?

83
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,486
You are damaging personal
property and I'm gonna...

84
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:46,031
The ink is running.
I didn't expect that.

85
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,619
There we are!
Clean as a whistle.

86
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:54,998
Thanks for coming by,
Marvin.
Expect to hear
from my lawyer.

87
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:59,336
Oh, Gillet, one more thing.
Come back here.
It's very important.

88
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,674
They're doing a thing now where
they make an incision in the
scalp, push the hair together.

89
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:08,887
Or you could try a transplant.
Maybe the hair from your ass
might make you smarter. Bye.

90
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:12,975
Betty, how 'bout lunch
at the In-N-Out Burger?

91
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,018
I'm not hungry.

92
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,688
Forget the burger. How about
just the "in and out"?
[Groans]

93
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,691
Very well.
How about just the "in"?
[Groans]

94
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,862
Ooh!

95
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,325
[Ringing]

[Ringing Continues]

97
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,165
Fletch, answer your phone.

98
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,381
In-N-Out Burger.

99
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,009
May I take your order please?
Mr. Irwin Fletcher?

100
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,220
This is Amanda Ray Ross.
I represented
your Aunt Belle Fletcher.

101
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,806
Good ol' Aunt Belle.
How the hell is she?

102
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,310
She's deceased,
Mr. Fletcher.
Oh. I guess she could be better.

103
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:00,272
- You're a hard man to find.
- I was touring with the Stones.
What can I do for you?

104
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,191
Didn't you get my message?
No.

105
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,110
I'm the executor
of your aunt's will and
as such I can inform you...

106
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:09,698
you are the major beneficiary
of your aunt's estate,
Belle Isle.

107
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,368
What about this expense...
$58 for leg waxing?
That's bullshit.

108
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,746
Yeah, but feel how smooth
they are.

109
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,041
[Amanda]
It consists of 80 acres
of old plantation property.

110
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,211
Wait a minute.
Did you say plantation?
Yes, indeed.

111
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,796
She left it to me?
According to her will,
she did.

112
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,383
- Can I get back to you?
- Hair by Ziggy? Who's Ziggy?

113
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:33,222
5-0-4... Shut up, Frank.
Yeah.
I'll get right back to you.

114
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,266
Can't we just return
some of these things?
What about the lingerie?

115
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,269
- I ate it.
- Be serious for one minute.

116
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,979
I quit.

117
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:46,235
I'm not unreasonable
about legitimate expenses.
I quit, Frank.

118
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,780
Yeah. On the sewer story,
I'm gonna advance you for
the hip boots and wet suit.

119
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,407
Frank, I'm really quitting.

120
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:56,453
Fletch, look, I got a little
A-frame up at Arrowhead.

121
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,997
Why don't you go there,
take a couple of weeks,
relax?

122
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,750
I'm really gonna miss you.

123
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,794
Maybe that's an overstatement.

124
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:07,089
Treat this as good news.
You can always write
myJane Doe column.

125
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,758
You're not gonna quit,
and I'll tell you why.

126
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,094
Why?
You have
journalistic integrity.

127
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,013
Yeah.
And you have a sense
of loyalty.

128
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,266
And you'll never give up
the quest for truth,
will you?

129
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:22,938
You're right. I can't abandon
the principles that nurtured me
lo these many years.

130
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:27,359
Wrap them up with the shit
on my desk and have them shipped
to my mansion in Louisiana.

131
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,820
Bye.

132
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,822
What happened?

133
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,325
And my husband said I was
crazy to go 2,000 miles
to have my nose done.

134
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,744
[Snoring]

135
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:41,874
That's an interesting watch.
Is it a prize of some sort?

136
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:45,961
No.
It certainly looks
like one.

137
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,131
It's a championship
Laker watch.

138
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,717
Oh! Are you a Laker?

139
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,431
I used to date one.
Only thing I have
to remember him by.

140
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,475
[Sighs]

141
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,857
Lord, what was that?

142
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,652
We just clipped a Piper Cub.
The pilot's okay.
I just saw him parachuting.

143
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:13,071
[Laughing]

144
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,158
I love a man
with a sense of humor.

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,244
What did you say
your name was?

146
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,371
Nostradamus.

147
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,665
I'm Cindy Mae Sample.

Nostradamus.
I love the Fightin' Irish.

149
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,715
Lord, I hate to fly.
I wish I was gettin' off
in Thibodaux like you.

150
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:36,512
It's two more stops
to Selma. All those ups
and downs and ups and downs.

151
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:42,351
[Sighs]
You should try
holding your breath.

152
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,645
Sometimes that works.

They love you so much.

- I love them too.

- Uncle Frank?
- Yes, sir?

00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:55,632
- You know my favorite tune.
- Sure do, Colonel.

170
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,844
Would you mind if I sat
in your lap, Colonel?

171
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,763
Please do, Betty Lee.
Please do.

172
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:07,603
The field hands would like
to dance for you.
Dance for me?

00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,147
Why, I'll dance for them!

[P.A. System, Indistinct]

Mr. Fletcher.
I'm Amanda Ray Ross.

187
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:16,505
I spoke with you
on the phone.
Oh, yes. That was you?

188
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,590
Great.

189
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,760
Do you have any luggage?
Just one piece.

190
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:36,149
[Amanda]
Plannin' on stayin' long?

191
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:40,362
Just long enough to see
Mount Rushmore and squeeze in
a little ice fishing.

192
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,535
I'm on the board of
the Pontchartrain Society.

193
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,955
We help preserve
and restore some
of these lovely mansions.

194
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,880
We headed to Belle Isle?

195
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:01,592
- You must be dying to see it,
Mr. Fletcher.
- Call me Fletch.

196
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:05,345
Your house is not quite
as grand as some of the
others in the neighborhood.

197
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:09,141
It doesn't matter.
It's the thought that counts.
Eighty acres, huh?

198
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,936
Mm-hmm.
Isn't it strikin'?

199
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:20,152
Your aunt tried to keep things
in their natural state.

200
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,821
She ever brush her hair?

201
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:27,618
- I can see you're disappointed.
- No, not at all!

202
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:32,080
A little spackling
and some napalm, this place
would make a nice mausoleum.

203
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,470
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

204
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:51,183
Oh!
I was aimin' to fix that today.
How do you do?

205
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,144
I be Calculus Entterby.
You be Mr. And Mrs. Fletcher?

206
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:59,691
I be Fletch. Geometry Fletch.
She be Miss Trigonometry Ross.

207
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:04,196
Pleased, I'm sure.
Your Aunt Belle told me
you'd be takin' over the place,

208
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,490
and I'm extendin'
my "condulations."

209
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,702
Right. You work here?

210
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,413
Your Aunt Belle and I,
we had an arrangement.

211
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:17,376
And I was hopin' we could
make an extenuation of it.

212
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,672
Help me get your stuff
out the car here.
Come on.

213
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,425
You mind your step.

214
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,636
Our families go back
for hundreds of years.

215
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:32,975
Your great grandparents
owned my great grandparents
and that's how it all started.

216
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,060
Did you ever hear of the
Emancipation Proclamation?

217
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,857
I heard somethin' about it,
but I don't recall exactly.

218
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,236
- It didn't get much publicity
around these here parts.
- I'll bet.

219
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,572
Excuse me, sir.

220
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:51,577
Could you give me a hand?
R-Right here.

221
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,996
Just pull it towards you.
Just pull it.

222
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,040
Come on, come on.
Just pull it.

223
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,376
Just pull it on over.
That's it, that's it.

224
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,378
Don't scar the car.

225
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,173
Is there any electricity
or gas?

226
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:08,177
Everything works.
No cable TV, I guess.

227
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:13,015
If I'd known you was comin',
I'd have straightened out a bit
and stocked your refrigerator.

228
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,101
No food?
No refrigerator.

229
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:19,188
We need to do
some paperwork.
Want a lift into town?

230
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,774
What? And leave
my estate unattended?
It's not yours till you sign.

231
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:26,653
I can make you some dinner,
ease the culture shock.

232
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,864
That sounds great.

233
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:32,075
Should I be doin' anything?
No, not really.

234
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,245
Uh, soon as you get
that trunk upstairs
and have finished your nap,

235
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:39,500
I guess you could fix that step
and jump down, turn around
and pick a bale of cotton.

236
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,545
And while I'm gone, see to it
Miss Scarlett stays away
from the Union Army, will you?

237
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,885
[Amanda]
More wine?

238
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,429
[Fletch] You're not trying
to take advantage of me,
are you?

239
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:56,099
[Amanda]
Not yet.
You need to sign these papers.

240
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,396
Do you mind
if I read 'em first?

241
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,734
Be my guest.
Had you talked
to your aunt recently?

242
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:10,405
That depends
on your view of history.
It's been 16 years.

243
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,243
Sign all three?
Please.

244
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:18,163
I was just wonderin'
because she changed her will
three weeks before she died.

245
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:23,001
Well, lucky for me.
Why'd she do that?

246
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:27,339
I don't know. She was old.
Seemed to be under
a lot of strain.

247
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:33,428
Dying always does that to you.

248
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,141
Congratulations. You know,
you can make yourself
some good money out of this.

249
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:42,813
A Realtor contacted me with
an unusually high offer...
225,000.

250
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,607
- Dollars?
- Mm-hmm.

251
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,527
Let me ask you this:

252
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,781
If they're so anxious, don't you
think if I wait a little longer,
they might go up?

253
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:56,160
- They might.
- And I just got here,
didn't I?

254
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,036
No sale?

255
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,793
While you're thinking
about it, what are you gonna
do with the land, Fletch?

256
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:09,381
I don't know. Raise chitlins...
the chitlin' market
as high as it is.

257
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:13,552
They're mean little animals,
but their coats
are worth a fortune.

258
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:20,142
$225,000?
What do you think I oughta do?

259
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:25,981
If I were you,
I would proceed slowly
and carefully.

260
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,734
That's my specialty.

261
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:33,197
- Would you like some dessert?
- What do you have in mind?

262
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:37,242
How 'bout something sweet...
and Southern?

263
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,599
[Gasps]

264
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:19,451
[Fletch]
I borrowed your toothbrush.

265
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:23,580
Would've used your razor,
but it looks like you've been
doing some gardening with it.

266
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:29,378
Gee, I can't believe
we slept this late.

267
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:33,966
Amanda? Want to drive
into Belle Isle?

268
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,681
I guess not.

269
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,149
It was good,
but not that good.

270
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,408
'Morning, Mr. Fletcher.
If that's your real name.
I'm BillyJo Hendrick.

271
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,119
Howdy.

272
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,454
What's your relationship
to Amanda Ray?

273
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,790
She was my attorney.

274
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:10,460
She was working on my briefs.
[Chuckles]

275
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:14,339
- You come into town,
y'all just hit it off?
- So to speak.

276
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:18,969
Sparks just flew.
That's what
you're gonna tell me.

277
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,638
Wonder why things like that
never happen to me?

278
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:24,224
Wonder why!

279
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:30,439
Were y'all usin' some drugs
you brought in from
California by any chance?

280
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,275
Just some Beaujolais.

281
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,861
Beaujolais?

282
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,614
It's a pretty popular drug
made from grapes?

283
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,450
- You feel like makin'
a statement?
- A statement?

284
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,332
"Ask not what your country
can do for you, ask what
you can do for your country."

285
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:51,293
I guess you just wanna make
it hard on everybody.

286
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:56,882
Well, let's see how you feel
after some time in the tank.
Y'all come.

287
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,884
All of us?
Just you.

288
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:02,346
- What's the charge?
- Pissin' me off.

289
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,806
Is that a felony
or a misdemeanor?
That's it!

290
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:11,980
You're cleaner than most
of the ones we get around here.

291
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:16,568
You smell nice.

00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:34,144
and I was pretty sure
that I didn't do it.

440
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:37,564
Amanda knew more
than she'd let on, but
the only clue she'd left me...

441
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:41,485
was a reference to Aunt Belle
changing her will
just before she died.

442
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,615
I knew the local police force
was watching her place
carefully...

443
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:49,493
so there'd be no trouble
getting in.

444
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:53,497
Over the years I found
Mr. Underhill's credit card
to be a useful tool...

445
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,833
much like Underhill himself.

446
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,725
As usual, I was willing to risk
my lifejust to get a peek
into a filing cabinet.

447
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:18,230
I love them when they're
unlocked, neatly organized and
tell me what I wanna know.

448
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:20,649
Belle's legal files
were in good order...

449
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:23,694
with the exception
of something missing under
the heading of"Bluebird."

450
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,782
My aunt had almost left
Belle Isle to some minister.

451
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:32,911
Obviously at one time
he must have touched her deeply.

452
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:35,831
Since she changed her mind,
I guess he didn't touch her
deeply enough...

453
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:37,875
or in the right place.

454

Thank you very much.
Couldn't find
that light switch.

456
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:52,598
What the hell you doin' here?
This is a restricted area.
Didn't you see the sign?

457
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:57,019
Signs? Signs!
That's all I see is signs.
Look at this.

458
00:32:57,102 --> 00:33:00,939
Stressed out "dormants"
on the windows, walls that are
deplaning to an alarming degree.

459
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:04,860
Deplaning?
This house
is obviously infested with
reticulermes Mario Cuomos.

460
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:07,404
What's that?
What's what?

461
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:10,407
Reticulermes. You can't even
say it yourself.

462
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:13,619
They are deadly African
microscopic termites.

463
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:17,206
They can eat a hundred times
their weight in five minutes.

464
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:19,666
Much like yourself.
From the look of things,
I'd say...

465
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,377
this place is about
ready to collapse.

My van is parked out front.

467
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,842
Mr. King, I don't know nothin'
about no Bug Busters.

468
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:33,222
The surgeon general was right.
They've been mighty busy here.

469
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:39,353
The only time
you can catch 'em
is at night.

470
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,441
Aha! I got one!
See that?

471
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:48,070
These little buggers
are the piranhas
of the insect world.

472
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,739
The only thing they like better
than wood is human flesh.
Really?

473
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:53,450
You bet.
If you can't see it,
how do you know you got one?

474
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:57,746
I'm glad I asked that question.
They make this horrible
high-pitched noise.

475
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:02,125
It's kinda like
a tiny little scream.
Can you hear that?

476
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:05,087
Can you hear that?
It's like a tiny
little piglet.

477
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:09,258
No? Uh-oh.
I seem to have dropped it
in your ear.
You what?

478
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,260
That's all right.

479
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:16,139
We better get that.
Can't let that nest in there.
They multiply by masturbation.

480
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:19,226
The only way to get that out
is to get as close to the floor
as you can.

481
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:22,729
Go on down to the floor.
That's right. They're drawn
to the floorboards.

482
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,607
Now shake your head like
you're trying to get water
out of your ear.

483
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:29,486
That's good. But hit it...
No, hit it harder. This side.
That's right.

484
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,198
Now make that scream.
That'll draw 'em out.
Squeal like a pig.

My head was filled
with decorating ideas.

in your heart now, has it?

583
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:30,115
Not a hell of a lot.
No.

584
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:33,660
Irwin, admit
that you are a sinner.

585
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:41,293
Uh, well I've sinned.
Didn't take any Polaroids
or anything.

586
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,463
But... I've sinned.
Yeah.

587
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:47,466
The Lord forgives ya!

588
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:51,512
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

589
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:54,223
Thank you. Amen.

590
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:57,059
What? Other sins?

591
00:41:57,142 --> 00:42:02,272
Uh, I parked
in a handicapped spot
on my way over here.

592
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:04,566
Actually on
a handicapped person.

593
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:08,779
I told him I'd be out
in five minutes
so that's not such a big deal.

594
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:14,117
There have been other things.
They're personal, so I wouldn't
wanna get into it on TV.

595
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:17,120
But I have sinned
and I'm sorry about it.
Thanks.

596
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:20,207
God forgives ya!
[Audience]
Amen.!

597
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,961
The good Lord
is gonna ease...

598
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:27,256
the pain and sufferin'
in your heart...

599
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,967
with a bright light
of grace.

600
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:35,264
Look out, you demons!
Demons, demons, out!

601
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:39,935
Oh! That was great.

602
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:42,521
Praise the Lord.

603
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:46,859
Another soul saved
byJimmy Lee Farnsworth.
How about that?

604
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:50,779
[Fletch's Voice] I dangled
Belle Isle like bait in front of
Jimmy Lee and he took the hook.

605
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:55,159
I could tell, at the heart,
he was a deeply religious man
and I liked his teeth.

606
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:57,327
Once we've had
a chance to expand,

607
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:00,789
Bibleland's gonna be
like some kind
of heaven on earth...

608
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:03,625
if it isn't already.

609
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:06,461
- There's the hotel.
- Hi, Reverend.

610
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:09,506
We call it the Heavenly Hilton
and Convention Center.

611
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,343
Beyond that is the
Farnsworth Bible College.

612
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:16,388
If you look down the road,
you see theJump forJesus
Trampoline Center.

613
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:19,641
- What do you think?
- It's unbelievable.

614
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:22,728
You don't suppose
I use too many photographs
of myself, do ya?

615
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:26,315
No! No!
It worked for the Ayatollah.

616
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:29,151
Mr. Fletcher, your Belle Isle's
a bit rundown.

617
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:31,778
That sucker's gonna eat
you alive in maintenance.

618
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:35,157
You don't know how much your
land would mean to our ministry.

619
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,661
And to God, too, of course.
After all, he does give us
our guidance now, doesn't he?

620
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,830
- Amen!
- You bet your ass.

621
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:45,000
[Hamilton]
Like my mother used to say,
"There's a tick for every dog."

622
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,044
What did your mother
mean by that?

623
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:52,132
Why in God's name you let
Farnsworth's ministry burrow
into your fur?

624
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:57,387
Why would you even think of
givin' away your property when
you got a big cash offer on it?

625
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:00,182
I don't know.
I guess I thought, after
a lifetime of hedonism,

626
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:03,519
it was time
to rededicate my life.

627
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:07,898
Nah, I just wanted to see
what would happen
if I went along with him.

628
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:11,693
Well, it happened.
The sheriff's office called.

629
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:14,112
The charges against you
have been dropped.

630
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:15,948
Is that right?
Mm-hmm.

631
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:19,993
The ministry has a good deal
of influence around here.

632
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:22,788
I suppose you've heard
that your...

633
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:28,210
aunt was under considerable
emotional strain in the weeks
before she died?

634
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:31,129
Yeah, I've heard that.

635
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:33,924
So was my mother.

636
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:37,386
They took advantage of her.
These Holy Rollers.

637
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:42,140
When she was at death's door,
they preyed on her faith
and her fear.

638
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:44,560
When she was no longer able
to make rational decisions,

639
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:48,313
persuaded her
to give away our land
for that amusement park.

640
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:52,776
My guess is
that your speedy conversion
and your promised gift...

641
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,114
played no small part
in the charges against you
being dropped.

642
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:02,661
Well, whatever.

643
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:05,664
At least I'm off the hook.

644
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:09,710
And who or what
do they think is responsible
for Amanda Ray's death?

645
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:12,087
The autopsy report
come in today.

646
00:45:12,171 --> 00:45:15,674
They said she died
of a heart attack.
Natural causes.

647
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:18,927
Either she had
some congenital defect...

648
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:22,973
or... you're one
hell of a lover.

649
00:45:25,017 --> 00:45:26,935
Probably both.

650
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:32,691
[Fletch's Voice] I needed
more background on Farnsworth
so I called Frank for a favor.

651
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:35,861
Maybe I should've asked him
to check out Calculus Entterby.

652
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:39,072
I liked him, but I wasn't buying
his Amos and Andy routine.

653
00:45:39,156 --> 00:45:41,408
He seemed a lot smarter
than that.

654
00:45:41,492 --> 00:45:45,662
I never took you
to be no murderer.
That's a relief.

655
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:49,500
So who's the
odds on favorite now?

656
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:51,835
Nobody.

657
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:54,880
They're sayin' she dropped dead
in her sleep.
Yeah!

658
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,343
The odds on that?

659
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:01,970
Same as catchin' a bass
this afternoon.

660
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:06,350
What's that?

661
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:09,186
About 258,000 to one.

662
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,864
You sure you
don't wanna back out?

663
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:23,700
I'm in.

664
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:25,494
[Door Opens]

665
00:46:25,536 --> 00:46:28,413
This be the morgue?
Have the police come yet?

666
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:32,918
What?
The police!
They was bringing a doctor
to make a death certificate.

667
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:36,672
You got a stiff, boy,
you're in the right place.
Where is it?

668
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:39,174
In my Cadillac.

669
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:42,511
Put him on the gurney.
Take him in the back
with the rest of'em.

670
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:45,055
Don't bother me.
I'm watchin The Terminator.

671
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:47,891
You better put
a steerin'wheel on that.
Excuse me, sir.

672
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:50,853
I'll be right back now.

673
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:57,025
- What's that stickin' out?
- His lucky golf cap.

674
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:59,027
Hey.!

675
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:04,700
You gotta tag his toe.

676
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:08,078
- He got a name?
- Eldridge Cleaver.

677
00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:11,748
Take him in the back,
strip him. Hold it.

678
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:16,628
Let's see what Mr. Cleaver has,
or should I say, had.

679
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:24,428
Wait a minute.
Shouldn't I get that?

680
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,471
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

681
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:31,435
You call me whenever
you want, I'll tell you
what time it is.

682
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:34,146
Now get movin;

683
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,905
- Eldridge Cleaver.
- Shh.

684
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:46,158
Good evening, Mr. Hoffa.

685
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:49,745
Amanda Ross. Amanda Ross.

Yeah, go on.

You don't have a Tic-Tac,
do you?

691
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,149
What happened?
I black out?

692
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:03,026
Did I land
the plane safely?
Passengers hurt?

693
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,987
No.
[Fletch]
Everything's okay?

694
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,238
Check that air-conditioning.

695
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:12,703
[Calculus]
What'd you find out, Fletch?

696
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:17,624
Cremated. I wouldn't be
surprised if all the paperwork
was burnt up with the body.

697
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,668
[Fletch's Voice]
The morgue proved to be
a dead end.

698
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:22,880
[Laughs]
But I guess it is
for most people.

699
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:26,758
I had three questions.
Why was I cleared
in Amanda's death?

700
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:30,220
Why, if she wasn't murdered,
was the body
so quickly destroyed?

701
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:34,850
And finally, when it comes
to stewed prunes, are three
enough or are four too many?

702
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:38,520
When I got back to Belle Isle,
there was a cozy fire
in the fireplace...

703
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:41,106
and on the roof, on the walls
and on the porch.

704
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,567
It was great.

705
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,569
Think maybe I should pack.

706
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:48,030
Guess you'll be movin' in
with me now.
Thanks, Cal.

Look at the bright side.
You won't have to bother
dusting anymore.
Yes, sir!

Does everything around here
come with the head still on it?

711
00:50:08,091 --> 00:50:12,554
- You bet, honey.
- Glad I didn't order
a hamburger.

but I don't wanna wake him up.

00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:18,268
Are you religious?

714
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:21,939
I believe in a God that
doesn't need heavy financing.

715

How you doin',
Mr. Barbour?
How's it goin', Calculus?

This here's Mr. Fletcher.

He's the new owner
of Belle Isle,
or whatever's left of it.

718
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:33,283
Yeah, I heard
about your fire.
Sorry about that.

719

You know, you've had
your share of problems
ever since you've been here.

How about me and the boys
showing you some
real Southern hospitality?

721
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:45,462
You ever been
on a coon hunt?

722
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:50,634
Now a coon hunt is like
an English fox hunt, except
we cut through all the bullshit,

723
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:54,388
all the fancy clothes
and music,
all the beautiful women.

724
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:57,599
We reduce the experience
to its essence.

Yeah, a bunch of sweaty drunks
chasin' a scared animal.

00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:02,771
You're damn right.!

727
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:06,066
What am I supposed to do?
The dogs do most
of the work.

728
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,695
We just follow the dogs,

01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:06,435
Excuse me?

873
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:10,230
If you can't expose
that problem,
at least to your family,

874
01:02:10,314 --> 01:02:15,235
it grows and grows, and becomes
an even bigger problem.!

875
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:16,904
That's true!

876

He's been a compulsive gambler
for 20 years.

877
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:23,827
Because you've had
this affliction
for more than 20 years,

878
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:28,332
I think you should
expose that problem to us...

879
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:30,959
right here... tonight.

880
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:34,963
I want you to do it.
The good Lord wants you
to do it!

881
01:02:35,047 --> 01:02:38,550
- You really think so?
- I know so!

882
01:02:39,801 --> 01:02:41,803
Do it. Do it now!

[Announcer]
Coming right back to introduce
our guest healers.

887
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:02,866
Let's welcome all of them
beginning with
Claude Henry Smmoot.

888
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:06,495
Come on out, Claude!

889
01:03:06,578 --> 01:03:08,497
Here we are.
I have a headache.

890
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,582
No, Claude, this way.

891
01:03:13,836 --> 01:03:17,339
You're gonna do just fine.
Now, get out there. Go on.

892
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:23,095
I said, get out there now!

893
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:26,807
Here he is!
Make him welcome, folks!

894
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:29,351
Welcome, Claude Henry.

895
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:31,603
When was the very first time,

896
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:36,441
the very first moment
that made the difference
in your life?

897
01:03:37,568 --> 01:03:40,612
Well, Jimmy Lee, I was...
I was, uh,

898
01:03:40,696 --> 01:03:45,033
on my gazebo, on the roof
making some repairs,

899
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:48,537
and I was struck
by lightning.

900
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:52,749
I have had acute
migraine headaches and
blurred vision since then.

901
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:55,419
But praise the Lord,
that was my lucky day
because...

902
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:58,422
ever since then I have had
the healing power.

903
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:01,675
Amen. God bless you.
Thank you very much.
Good night. Thank you.

904
01:04:01,717 --> 01:04:04,803
Claude Henry.
Good night. What?
What happened? Yes?

905
01:04:04,887 --> 01:04:07,306
Before you heal another,

906
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:10,726
would you like for me to attempt
to heal your own affliction?

907
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:14,688
No, no! No, no.
No, those of us
with perfect faith...

908
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:17,274
have no need
of perfect vision.

909
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:19,610
We have no need of wisdom.

910
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:23,530
We have no need of anything
except the creature comforts
and lots of them.

911
01:04:23,614 --> 01:04:27,826
Hallelujah.! Amen.!
God bless you. Amen.
Thank you. Hallelujah.

912

Ladies and gentlemen,
he sees more than he doth know.

913
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:34,750
- Yes, I do.
- [Audience]
Amen!

914
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:38,253
Claude Henry has the gift.!

915
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:42,758
Would you use that gift,
Claude Henry?
Would you use it now?

916
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:48,889
I guess I could.

917
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:51,099
Praise be.

918
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:55,687
Reverend, I sense that
in our audience...

919
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:59,650
there is a gentleman
by the name ofJim Bob.

920
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:02,820
Jim Bob, would you stand up?
Would you rise, please?

921
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:07,699
Sixteen, 17...

922
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:12,246
I sense thatJim Bob
is a young man.

923
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:17,543
That he is between
the ages of 25, 27.

924
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,589
That's more like it.

925
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:26,176
I feel the Lord
is telling me thatJim Bob
suffers from the same...

926
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:31,849
Satanized affliction
that I suffer from:
Migraine headaches.

927
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:34,143
Don't you, Jim Bob?
Is that you?

928
01:05:34,226 --> 01:05:36,520
Come on down, Jim Bob.!

Amen.!

Be saved!

931

Jim Bob, welcome.
God bless you.

932
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:48,657
Jim Bob, how long have
you had these headaches?

933
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:53,120
About five, 10 minutes.
God... help him!

934
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:57,875
- And how do you feel now?
- It's a throbbing...

935
01:05:57,958 --> 01:06:01,253
God bless you.
A throbbing headache comes
up through your heels,

936
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:04,715
up through the hip bone,
the knee bone, up the spine,
up through your back,

937
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:07,009
through your head
like Satan was belching
through you?

938
01:06:07,092 --> 01:06:09,428
- Is that it?
- Exactly.

939
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:11,346
- Do you believe?
- I believe.

My headache is gone, but...

948

God bless him!
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

949

No! No.

Maybe I was wrong
about Farnsworth.

955
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:10,405
There was a new player
in the game:
Becky's unknown client.

956
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:13,450
I had to find out more,
and the only way
was to get into her pants...

957
01:07:13,534 --> 01:07:18,455
I mean, her car.
At least it had brakes.
Her car, that is.

are you doing?

stole my watch.

He dropped it while he was
trying to kill me. I'd just
as soon he not recognize me.

I'd like to keep an eye on him.
Maybe he'll lead us to his boss.

gonna be here?

to happen whenever
I'd play hide-and-seek.

pretty tough in there.

isn't helping a lot.

01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:02,549
Oh, boy.

1023
01:13:02,591 --> 01:13:04,676
Hey, look at that!
Came off.

1024
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:09,223
* One for the money
Two for the show *

1025
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:12,559
* Gotta go, let's go
Hey, hey *

1026
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:15,521
* Gonna go out tonight *

1027
01:13:15,604 --> 01:13:17,731
* Gonna have some fun *

1028
01:13:17,773 --> 01:13:20,567
*Everything
will be all right **

1029
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:37,835
What're we gonna do?
Something that will seem
extremely stupid at first.

1030
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,693
[Screams]
Oh, my God!

1031
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:05,571
[Screams]

1032
01:14:08,574 --> 01:14:13,328
Yee-ha!

1033
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:21,420
Home!

1034
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:24,464
Oh, my God!
I'm a mess.

1035
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:27,718
You want some coffee?
Sure.

1036
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:30,137
I look like a raccoon.

1037
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:34,808
I gotta get to work, although
I don't know why. All I do
is sit with nothing to do.

1038
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:38,979
The only work I've had
in the last three months
has been with Everest Realty.

1039
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:40,981
And look what that's
gotten me.
Can I use your phone?

1040
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,942
Sure, go ahead.

1041
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:47,488
That's toxic waste on the soles.
What have you been doing?

1042
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:49,865
Jogging in the Love Canal.
What do you mean
"toxic waste"?

1043
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:54,912
- It's special. There's only
11 places that make this shit.
- Where?

1044
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:02,377
Frank, just give me the ones
that aren't in New Jersey.

1045
01:15:02,461 --> 01:15:05,339
Ah, there's only one.
Yazoo, Mississippi.

1046
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:07,841
Bingo.

1047
01:15:13,722 --> 01:15:16,767
I wanna thank you
for everything you've done.

1048
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:20,229
I'm sorry I caused
such a mess.

1049
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:24,233
Can I ask you
a personal question?
Mm-hmm.

1050
01:15:24,316 --> 01:15:28,028
Did you finally get
to pee?

1051
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:31,073
Yes.

1052
01:15:31,156 --> 01:15:33,325
Good.

1053
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:43,460
You better get cleaned up.

1054
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:48,006
Yeah.
Particularly my mind.

1055
01:15:57,349 --> 01:16:00,185
Where's the shampoo?
I'll get you some.

1056
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:08,110
Here. You'll need
a clean towel too.

1057
01:16:08,152 --> 01:16:10,946
No, yours will be fine.
[Screams]
Fletch!

1058
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:13,240
[Becky Laughing]

1059
01:16:13,282 --> 01:16:16,994
[Fletch]
You're right.
This is too wet.

1060
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:20,414
[Becky Laughing]
[Fletch] You know how
to get to Yazoo?

1061
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:23,208
[Becky]
Well, you're in
the right vicinity.

1062
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:27,129
[Fletch's Voice]
The church seemed less
and less culpable.

1063
01:16:27,212 --> 01:16:31,967
Why would they want
toxic waste next to their land?
Why would anybody?

1064
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:36,680
Why are there four S's
in Mississippi?
Four I's and only two P's...

1065
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:39,683
and one "M"
as far as I know?

1066
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:49,818
Bly Bio Chem was the biggest
chemical plant in Mississippi.

1067
01:16:49,902 --> 01:16:52,738
My Laker shoes were ruined
by toxic waste produced there.

1068
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:55,699
They probably knew who
delivered it to my backyard.

1069
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:59,286
Now the lead-lined
containers painted
with innocent bluebirds...

1070
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:01,705
added a crucial piece
to the puzzle...

1071
01:17:01,788 --> 01:17:04,124
that had begun way back
in Amanda Ross's pants...

1072
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:07,252
I mean, bedroom.

1073
01:17:07,336 --> 01:17:09,379
This is a secure area.

1074
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:14,134
I'm very happy for you.
Most people live
in terrible neighborhoods.

1075
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:18,222
Are you the head honcho?
That's right, sir.
Headly Dan Duke.

1076
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:20,307
And what seems
to be your problem?

1077
01:17:20,349 --> 01:17:24,269
I agreed to take a shit load
of that Bluebird crap
off your hands.

1078
01:17:24,353 --> 01:17:28,482
And it ain't come yet.
I'm very sorry, sir.
And you are?

1079
01:17:28,524 --> 01:17:30,275
I are pissed!

1080
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:33,529
Some damn fool told me
it was on back order,
and I'd have to wait.

1081
01:17:33,612 --> 01:17:35,572
Whose signature is this?
Who signed that?
I can't...

1082
01:17:35,656 --> 01:17:39,201
That's the trouble!
It's typical
of a large corporation.

1083
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:42,621
Lack of communication.
That's why I like
to keep Everest small.

1084
01:17:42,704 --> 01:17:46,041
Oh, you're from Everest!
Now you're talkin'!

1085
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:50,379
Elmer Gantry.
Elmer Fudd Gantry.
I'm not
sure there's anything I can do.

1086
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:54,132
You could pull my file
instead of standing there
pulling your pud!

1087
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:57,219
Whatever you say, sir.

1088
01:17:57,302 --> 01:17:59,763
Bring me the Everest file.

1089
01:17:59,847 --> 01:18:02,307
[Woman]
Yes, sir.

1090
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:04,518
[Screaming]

1091
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,062
Mr. Gantry?

1092
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:13,110
I apologize
for my bellicosity.
I've had a hernia operation.

1093
01:18:13,193 --> 01:18:15,404
Is that the stuff
I'm supposed to get?

1094
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:18,991
[Duke] Yes, sir.
Why are they wearing
those funny suits?

1095
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:23,036
They're protective, as you know.
That's a very corrosive
by-product they're handling.

1096
01:18:23,078 --> 01:18:25,122
Oh, yeah. I guess if they
didn't wear those suits,

1097
01:18:25,205 --> 01:18:30,752
those boys would be
so full of holes, they'd
whistle when they walked.

1098
01:18:30,836 --> 01:18:34,590
[Groans]
I've been spitting up blood,
pissing blood, bleeding.

1099
01:18:34,673 --> 01:18:38,010
I go through five
of these suits a day.

1100
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:41,138
It appears you have
your facts wrong, Mr. Gantry.

1101
01:18:41,221 --> 01:18:43,640
Your company is supposed
to get 1500 gallons.

1102
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:46,935
Destination someplace
called Belle Isle in Louisiana.

1103
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:50,481
Signed for by an officer
of your company
and due the 23rd.

1104
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:54,276
So... we're right,
and you're wrong.

1105
01:18:54,359 --> 01:18:57,321
Let me see that.

1106
01:18:57,404 --> 01:19:01,408
Takes a big man
to admit when he's wrong.
I am not a big man.

1107
01:19:08,749 --> 01:19:11,752
We're late again,
because you had
to stay late at thejail.

1108
01:19:11,793 --> 01:19:13,754
Hurry up.
Just get out.

1109
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:24,431
[Woman Screams]
Are you all right?

1110
01:19:24,473 --> 01:19:29,770
[Woman]
You're wrecking my present.
[Man] My fault?

1111
01:19:29,812 --> 01:19:32,564
Wash and gas it.
Check the brake fluid, will ya?

1112
01:19:32,648 --> 01:19:35,484
[Clinking Glass]

1113
01:19:35,526 --> 01:19:37,945
My friends,
ladies and gentlemen.

1114
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:43,283
With all the fun we've been
having, I hope we don't forget
our real purpose here tonight...

1115
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:47,329
to preserve the legacy
that nature has given us.

1116
01:19:47,412 --> 01:19:50,165
We are mere custodians of...

1117
01:19:50,249 --> 01:19:53,293
Bob Lee.
Bobby Lee. Bobby Lee.

1118
01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:57,548
Bobby Lee.
Bobby Lee Schwartz.

1119
01:19:57,631 --> 01:20:01,635
Schwartz.
Schwartz, the Second.

1120
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:28,954
Fletch!
What you doin' here?

1121
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:34,376
- What are you doin' here?
- You know me. I ain't happy
unless I'm working.

1122
01:20:34,418 --> 01:20:39,381
Why, Fletch, I'm surprised
to see you here, sir.
Welcome, sir, welcome.

1123
01:20:39,464 --> 01:20:42,384
My pleasure, my pleasure.
Thank you
for not inviting me.

1124
01:20:42,468 --> 01:20:44,678
Oh!

1125
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:49,266
I do believe we have
something to discuss.

1126
01:20:49,349 --> 01:20:54,521
Oh. Well, might I suggest
we repair ourselves
to a quieter place.

1127
01:20:54,563 --> 01:20:56,940
Let us remove ourselves,
shall we?

1128
01:20:57,024 --> 01:21:00,736
Son of a gun,
we'll have big fun
on the bayou.

1129
01:21:06,325 --> 01:21:08,744
My mama's room.

1130
01:21:10,078 --> 01:21:13,874
I've kept it
just the way it was
when she died.

1131
01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:17,920
Her ashes?

1132
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:21,715
She used to say,
"We come from the earth
and we return to the earth,

1133
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:24,259
and in between,
we garden."

1134
01:21:24,343 --> 01:21:27,513
[Chuckles]
A little gardening,

1135
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:30,349
a little polluting.

1136
01:21:35,103 --> 01:21:37,314
They spelled my name wrong.

1137
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:41,527
My gun's made of rubber.
How 'bout yours?

1138
01:21:42,903 --> 01:21:46,824
No.
I see your point.

1139
01:21:46,907 --> 01:21:49,284
Wouldn't do for your
conservationists guests
to hear about...

1140
01:21:49,368 --> 01:21:52,037
that load of toxic waste
heading for my land
at Belle Isle.

1141
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:56,250
My land...
at Belle Isle, Fletch.

1142
01:21:56,291 --> 01:22:00,504
After you die, who's gonna
prove that you did not sell
your land to Everest?

1143
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:03,298
You may have this town
in your back pocket, Johnson,

1144
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:06,301
but there are a lot of people
downstairs who are gonna be
very interested...

1145
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:09,847
in the hows and whys
of Amanda Ray's death.

1146
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:11,932
She knew about Bluebird.

1147
01:22:12,015 --> 01:22:14,852
She started a file on you,
and you found out about it.

1148
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:20,190
That was my lucky night.
The night I found the Bluebird
file, the night you porked her.

1149
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:24,736
I figured it was like an
alligator shoot on the freeway,
if you'll excuse the metaphor.

1150
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:28,532
- It's not a metaphor.
It's a simile, to be precise.
- Whatever.

1151
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:34,413
So you poisoned Amanda,
figuring I'd sell and get out
if I was facing a murder charge.

1152
01:22:34,496 --> 01:22:38,125
- I don't scare easy.
I'm too dumb.
- So it would seem.

1153
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:42,254
Now get out of
my mama's chair before I put
the first bullet up your nose.

1154
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:44,673
Are you kidding?

1155
01:22:44,715 --> 01:22:47,468
You pull that trigger
and 100 people
will be up here in a second.

1156
01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:50,471
My dear boy,
why would I do
my own dirty work?

1157
01:22:51,972 --> 01:22:55,225
Those hundred do-gooders
down there
dressed in rebel crap...

1158
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:57,728
will be my alibi.

1159
01:22:59,021 --> 01:23:01,857
Now get outta
my mama's chair!

1160
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:05,527
I synchronized
my beloved Laker watch
with Miss Culpepper's Timex.

1161
01:23:05,611 --> 01:23:08,864
If I don'tjoin her at
the ministry in 10 minutes,
the whole ugly story...

1162
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:11,742
goes out on
the Farnsworth Network.

1163
01:23:11,825 --> 01:23:13,911
Of course, it's cable, but...

1164
01:23:13,994 --> 01:23:16,371
- You're bluffing, Fletch.
- No, I'm not.

1165
01:23:16,455 --> 01:23:19,374
You think you're not...
but you are.

1166
01:23:21,043 --> 01:23:23,462
Swell.

1167
01:23:25,005 --> 01:23:29,885
- Did he hurt you?
- Not yet.
That comes later.

1168
01:23:29,927 --> 01:23:31,887
Sorry, Becky.

1169
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:36,975
The band won't take
a break for some time, so
screaming would be futile.

1170
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:40,020
Mr. Fletch's convenient
appearance has allowed us...

1171
01:23:40,062 --> 01:23:45,442
to move up our plans
for your demise
to coincide with his.

1172
01:23:45,526 --> 01:23:50,322
Now I'm goin' downstairs
to be the gracious host.

1173
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:54,159
Do what you have to do.

- The bride of Frankenstein.
- Put my mama down!

- Oh! I'm sorry.
- [Glass Shattering]

1176
01:23:59,498 --> 01:24:01,917
Oh, how clumsy of me.

1177
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,754
Oops! I'm sorry.
I stepped right on
her mustache.

1178
01:24:05,838 --> 01:24:09,133
Get away! Get away!

1179
01:24:09,216 --> 01:24:12,094
- Sorry.
I was just trying to help.
- It's all right, Mama.

1180
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:14,429
You should be more careful
where you put your breakables.

1181
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:16,974
I've been careful
all my life.

1182
01:24:17,057 --> 01:24:19,226
When she was sick,
I was careful.

1183
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:23,605
Then that goddamn
Jimmy Lee's ministry...
taking everything she had.

1184
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:26,775
Bloodsuckers!

1185
01:24:26,859 --> 01:24:30,612
It's gonna be all right, Mama.
And when we're far, far away...

1186
01:24:30,696 --> 01:24:32,739
from this godforsaken
chemical swamp,

1187
01:24:32,823 --> 01:24:37,619
we're gonna sit back
and watch 'em all
just decompose.

1188
01:24:37,703 --> 01:24:41,707
That should be good for
Bibleland's business, all their
customers glowing in the dark.

1189
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:44,751
I hope they all fry
in hell!

1190
01:24:44,793 --> 01:24:48,130
- You bloodsucking bastards!
- Isn't this interesting?

1191
01:24:48,213 --> 01:24:50,174
- Put that down.
- She really is in there.

1192
01:24:50,257 --> 01:24:52,926
- Put that down.
- She seems to have lost
a little weight.

1193
01:24:52,968 --> 01:24:56,180
I thought you had her
stuffed and mounted.
Here she is. Head's up!

1194
01:24:56,263 --> 01:24:58,098
Ohh! Ohh!
Becky!

1195

a good time?

Join our pyramid of prayer.

[TV]
For only $12,

1206
01:26:23,392 --> 01:26:27,354
you begin your exciting journey
up the pyramid.

1207
01:26:27,396 --> 01:26:29,356
And when you reach the top,

1208
01:26:29,398 --> 01:26:35,487
you're gonna be the target
of 20,000 prayers!

A lady in Fargo, North Dakota
broke the chain and began
a five-day fit of sneezing...

1210
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:42,619
that ended in her death.
Daddy?

1211
01:26:42,703 --> 01:26:48,375
Well, Mr. Fletcher,
what a pleasant surprise.
And, Becky, what are you...

1212
01:26:48,417 --> 01:26:52,671
Look who's here!
Hamilton Johnson!
Friend of the community.

1213
01:26:52,754 --> 01:26:56,175
Ham, you look like you've
worked up quite a sweat.

1214
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:58,719
Maybe you should dry
your hair first.
Do you want a towel?

1215
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:02,097
- [Audience Gasps]
- Uh-oh, he's got a gun.

1216
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:07,227
Show your lovely face on
national television. Let 'em see
that greedy glint in your eye.

1217
01:27:07,269 --> 01:27:09,229
Let 'em hear
that bullshit chuckle, Ham.

1218
01:27:09,271 --> 01:27:11,315
Who's gonna save you now,
Fletch?

1219
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:14,401
You'll have to shoot
through me,
you son of a bitch!

1220
01:27:14,443 --> 01:27:17,905
He's not gonna shoot anybody.
Are you, Ham?
You're on television now.

1221
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:20,324
- You haven't got the guts.

1225
01:27:35,464 --> 01:27:40,552
And it's my plan to rerun
this incident every night
during Sweeps Week.

1226
01:27:40,636 --> 01:27:43,722
The obvious question is...
What did you know
and when did you know it?

1227
01:27:43,806 --> 01:27:46,058
And how long did you plan
on letting me twist in the wind?

1228
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:49,853
Up to a point.
The Agency was barking up
the same tree you were.

1229
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:52,731
Jimmy Lee's finances.
Yep.

1230
01:27:52,815 --> 01:27:56,485
It was easy for Harry
and Field Officer Vincent
to infiltrate the ministry.

1231
01:27:56,568 --> 01:27:58,779
Field Officer Vincent?

1232
01:27:58,821 --> 01:28:01,323
That's Mr. Coco's
real name.

1233
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:04,243
We've been working on
this case for over a year.

1234
01:28:04,326 --> 01:28:09,081
Excuse me, Agent Goldstein,
the officer would like
to speak to you.
Surely.

1235
01:28:09,164 --> 01:28:11,124
Goldstein?

1236
01:28:15,337 --> 01:28:17,965
[Reporter]
Thank you, sir.

1237

Ding dong,
the wicked witch is dead.

1238
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:24,555
So what's next, Fletch?
Back to L.A.?

1239
01:28:24,638 --> 01:28:26,765
There's no place like home.

1240
01:28:26,849 --> 01:28:29,143
Unless home is here.

1241
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:33,105
You know what?
We gotta get you away
from this chemical swamp.

1242
01:28:33,188 --> 01:28:36,358
I was wondering...
Do you like smog?

1243
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:41,655
[Fletch's Voice]
Back home there was
a surprise party for me.

1244
01:28:41,697 --> 01:28:47,035
But the nicest surprise
was an insurance check for
the Belle Isle fire... $ 100,000.

1245
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:51,790
However, no one stopped
Bly Bio Chem from dumping
that toxic waste on my land.

1246
01:28:51,874 --> 01:28:56,503
They told me not to worry.
Its half-life was estimated
at 3,000 years.

1247
01:28:56,545 --> 01:28:58,547
Everything okay, Fletch?

1248
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:01,383
Betty was a little pissed off
about giving up her office,

1249
01:29:01,467 --> 01:29:04,261
and accounting gave me
some flak about the new car,
but trust me,

1250
01:29:04,344 --> 01:29:07,681
everything's gonna be
just the way you want it,
maybe better.

1251
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:10,100
I like your attitude, Frank.

1252
01:29:10,184 --> 01:29:13,645
Excuse me
just a sec.
What a guy!

1253
01:29:15,772 --> 01:29:20,444
I thought I told you...
never to come
to my workplace.

1254
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:22,696
Time's change, my dear Fletch.

1255
01:29:22,779 --> 01:29:26,116
Rumor has it that you
have inherited
a sizable piece of property.

1256
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:30,412
Who told you?
I have my sources too.

1257
01:29:30,496 --> 01:29:34,082
These sources also suggest
that you may have been
considering skipping town...

1258
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:36,376
and retiring
on this vast estate.

1259
01:29:36,418 --> 01:29:39,379
Thus skipping out on your
financial responsibilities.

1260
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:43,926
Would I do that?
Wendy could probably get
half of it anyway.

1261
01:29:44,009 --> 01:29:48,764
So in return for the other half,
we would forego
any other claims.

1262
01:29:48,847 --> 01:29:52,810
Think about it.
You would never see me again.

1263
01:29:57,856 --> 01:30:00,609
Where do I sign?

1264
01:30:04,947 --> 01:30:07,241
I'll never see you again?
Never.

1265
01:30:12,287 --> 01:30:15,541
You realize this is
my family land?

1266
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:19,586
Does it please you to
rip out my ancestral roots?

1267
01:30:19,628 --> 01:30:22,881
I was born and raised
in a briar patch.

1268
01:30:31,849 --> 01:30:34,601
Now Wendy can live
a life of leisure.

Clean air, clean water.
This is the way
she was destined to live.

Okay, Gillet.
You've broken me.
