1
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,796
* Cinderella
dressed in yellow

2
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,298
* Went upstairs
to kiss a fellow

3
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,432
How you ladies
doin' today?

4
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:32,533
Take it easy now.

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,967
* By mistake
she kissed a snake

6
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,736
* How many doctors
did it take *

7
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,573
Wait for me.

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,275
Meet a real fab family,

9
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:43,477
the Carrolls of Charleston,
South Carolina.

10
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,146
I'm a fanatic
about clean clothes.

11
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:48,516
That's why
I'm glad for Fab.

12
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:52,353
Dummies. Borax won't work
unless you put active enzymes.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,288
You geek!
How do you know all that?

14
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,423
I'm not a geek.

15
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,524
Yes, you are.

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,991
Am not.
Are, too.

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,827
I'll show you geeky.

18
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,436
Hurry up!
It's comin' on!

19
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,138
Batman!

20
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,744
* Batman

21
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,447
Stupid old TV!

22
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,882
Holy bad reception,
Batman. I'll fix it.

23
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,351
* Batman, Batman

24
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,890
Hurry up
or we'll miss it!

25
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,125
Hurry!

26
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:34,862
Where worms always go.

27
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,030
Down into the earth.

28
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,566
Is it working?

29
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,033
No, not yet.

30
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:42,069
Whoa!

31
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,937
That's it.
Don't move.

32
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,342
Your glasses!

33
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,246
Remember, never hit
a man with glasses.

34
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,116
Even better. Perfect!

35
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:57,885
Yes! Curses!

36
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:01,589
Yeah!

37
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,994
Yeah, keep flushing!

38
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,541
Yeah.

39
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,943
Back to back.

40
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,451
Who's playing
with the toilet?

41
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,320
Kevin, is that you?

42
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,488
Oh! Oh, my Lord.

43
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,060
Boys,
I'm gonna peel the skin off of your behind,

44
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,129
boil it and make soup!

45
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,565
To the Bat-poles!

46
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,367
What did I say?

47
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:48,569
Stay out

48
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:50,438
of my kitchen!

49
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,605
* Great Scott

50
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,441
* Here's someone
new on the block

51
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,244
* No badder spider could
compare to this top-notch hero

52
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,747
* He's everyday people,
defendin' all good, destroyin' all evil

53
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,416
* Puttin' in work on the bad guys and doin'
pretty good

54
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:03,717
* So it's wise to recognize

55
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,118
* Recognize what?

56
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,388
* That he's number one
and takes second to none

57
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:09,657
* And, uh, if you don't know
here he comes

58
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:10,658
* Blankman

59
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,226
* Here he comes
So watch out

60
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,327
* Blankman

61
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:14,495
* Here he comes

62
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:15,763
* Blankman

63
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,865
* Blankman

64
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,032
* Here he comes

65
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,501
* Blankman

66
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,803
* Blankman

67
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,172
* Blankman

68
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,375
* Blankman

69
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,042
* Yo, it's that fool again

70
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,778
* The one with the cape
on his back

71
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:31,912
* Blankman

72
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,314
* Yo, cool,
where's fool?

73
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,949
* Blankman

74
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,619
Cut that out down there,
or I'm callin' the police!

75
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:41,188
Shut up,
you crusty old bitch!

76
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:44,124
That must be your mama
you're thinkin' about!

77
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,261
Thanks for the help,
lady!

78
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,032
I've been hurt!

79
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,302
Hey, get off the car,
you bum!

80
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:04,712
Kevin, is that
your grandma?

81
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,879
Shh!

82
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,916
Go, go, go, go!

83
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,029
Oh, boy,
good mornin', Grandma.

84
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,031
Don't "good mornin'" me.

85
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,467
You could have at least
fed that little heifer.

86
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,769
Makin' all that noise
late last night.

87
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,103
It's a good thing
you so quick,

88
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,706
otherwise,
I never would have got no sleep.

89
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,409
You know, they were beatin'
up a man in the alley this morning.

90
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,977
Cops did nothin'.

91
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,380
Well, do you blame 'em?
They haven't been paid in two weeks.

92
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:42,583
All that's gonna change when
Assemblyman Harris is elected mayor.

93
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,851
You just watch.

94
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,487
Grandma, one man
cannot save the world.

95
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:49,523
I don't live in the world,
I live in this neighborhood,

96
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,427
and Harris is the only candidate
to ever set foot in it.

97
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:54,862
Now what you want
for breakfast?

98
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,097
I'll just have some coffee
'cause I gotta run.

99
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:00,601
All you do is run.
Now, come on, sit down.

100
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:04,372
Let your grandmother
fix you a nice, hot meal.

101
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,574
We're not kids anymore,
Grandma,

102
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,509
we're grown, remember?

103
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:26,760
Good morning, Grandma.

104
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,429
Morning, poopski.

105
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,530
Morning, Kevin.

106
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:31,365
Aw, Darryl,
man, come on!

107
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,601
You didn't sleep well
last night, did you?

108
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,570
I heard you in there
talkin' to yourself.

109
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:40,173
Yeah. I was working
on my latest creation.

110
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,509
Sound-activated,

111
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,777
aerodynamic, insect predator.

112
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:45,979
A what?

113
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,848
A flying flycatcher.

114
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,451
Oh, you are a genius!

115
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:53,754
Just like your mama,
may angels bless her soul.

116
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,689
One of these days,
Baby Huey over there

117
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,291
is gonna blow us up with one
of those damn inventions.

118
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,529
Shouldn't you be
at work already?

119
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,230
Wait, Kevin,
I got somethin' for you.

120
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,498
I gotta go.

121
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,600
No, it's okay,
J-5 will bring it.

122
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,841
Okay, make that turn,
make the turn.

123
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,243
Watch out for Grandma.

124
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,479
Here you go. Watch the wall.
Watch the wall.

125
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:21,982
I've gotta oil
his ball bearings.

126
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:26,086
You need to throw that in the
trash with the rest of that junk.

127
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,187
Here you go.

128
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,355
What is that?

129
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:30,257
Oh, it's a two-way
transceiver radio belt.

130
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:32,626
See, you put this
in your ear,

131
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,662
and then you talk
into the buckle.

132
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,264
It also has
a radio tracking device.

133
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,466
You get that
out of my face.

134
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:39,767
I'm not wearin'
that crap!

135
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,834
Please, Kevin?

136
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:41,902
No!

137
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,274
Kevin, come here.

138
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,043
Grandma,
he is retarded.

139
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,545
Come here.

140
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,681
He needs to invent some hair
for that bald head of his.

141
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,782
Ow!

142
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,785
You will wear that belt.

143
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,086
I am not going to say...

144
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,253
No!

145
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,589
Do as I say!

146
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,894
Uh, Darryl, give me the belt.
I'm gonna wear it, man.

147
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,997
No, you don't have to wear
my stupid old belt

148
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,298
if you don't want to.

149
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,201
Uh, Darryl, please.

150
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,136
May I wear your belt?

151
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:19,006
Are you really sure that you really,
really want to?

152
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,440
Uh, yeah.
I'm...I'm...I'm

153
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,643
really,
really sure I would like to wear your belt.

154
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,411
'Cause you really,
really don't have to

155
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,013
if you really,
really don't want to.

156
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,881
I would really, really
be upset if you...

157
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,817
Give me the damn belt!

158
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:32,953
This is great, Kevin.

159
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,556
Now we can talk together
all day long.

160
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:37,591
Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna
be home kinda late.

161
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,126
I got a karate class.

162
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,228
I'll radio you
in about an hour.

163
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,163
And then every hour
on the hour after that,

164
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,732
just to work
all the bugs out.

165
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,001
Yeah, well, if I'm not there,
leave a message.

166
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,670
You'll be there.

167
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,040
I'll track you down.

168
00:07:56,043 --> 00:08:00,714
* A super hero from the ghetto's lookin'
out for me

169
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:05,519
* Is he real or are my eyes
just deceivin' me

170
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,955
* Can he fly into the air?

171
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,558
* Can he leap
a flight of stairs?

172
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,560
* Can he really win
the fight?

173
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:16,196
* Can he really
save my life?

174
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:20,100
* Man, that boy Blankman
is cool with me

175
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,368
* Blankman, Blankman

176
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,536
Hey, wait!

177
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,137
Ah, thank you.

178
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,240
* Blankman helped me out,
helped my mama out

179
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,509
* Helped my grandmother out

180
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,549
Great day, isn't it?

181
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,217
Well,
why don't we see?

182
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,953
"GM lays off
500 more employees.

183
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,156
"A post office worker
wipes out an entire zip code,

184
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,226
"and the police are threatening
to walk out on a strike."

185
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,662
I just meant the, uh,
sun was gonna shine.

186
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,965
I hadn't got to the lame
come-on section yet.

187
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,033
Oh.

188
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:04,144
So I guess we're probably gonna talk later,
right?

189
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,947
Yeah, she's shy.

190
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,249
Who let you out
the Hard Edition dungeon?

191
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,483
This is the newsroom, man.

192
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,319
So you know
she's out your league.

193
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,854
Stevens,

194
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,856
they're all outta
your league.

195
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,892
Oh, I heard you won
a...a toaster at sperm bank.

196
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,427
Gotta go, gotta run.

197
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,764
Down, brother.
Down into the basement.

198
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,532
Bye, basement boy.

199
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,903
Yeah! Blood on the hands!
Blood on the hands!

200
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,571
Yes! Lift him
out of the trunk.

201
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,306
Lift him
out of the trunk.

202
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,208
Yeah! Hear that
bone break?

203
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,010
That's journalism,
my friend!

204
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,279
That's journalism!
Walker!

205
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,414
I watched your piece
on the mayor last night.

206
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,582
Boring!

207
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,384
Have you lost
your goddamn mind?

208
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,553
Got no angle, no edge!

209
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,821
Listen.

210
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,191
If you can't get
anything real,

211
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,060
then go to the board.

212
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,000
The Vice President

213
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,136
and an alien

214
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,539
and S&M sex!

215
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,776
Now,
that's a great story.

216
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,344
Look, my sources
connect Mayor Cates

217
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:14,314
to Michael Minelli
and organized crime.

218
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:15,515
My sources

219
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,150
link Mayor Cates
to Michael Minelli.

220
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,286
Who you gonna interview for that?
Cates?

221
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,453
He won't talk to us

222
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,055
since we made up
that shit about him

223
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,190
on the sheep farm.

224
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,758
Nope. Minelli.

225
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,429
Right.

226
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,331
You get an interview
with Michael Minelli,

227
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,966
I'll promote
your ass so high,

228
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,835
you'll be
shittin' off the moon.

229
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,203
In the meantime,

230
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,806
I forbid you to watch
any more 60 Minutes.

231
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,974
Remember, I want edge.

232
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,176
It's not Hard Edition,
it's...

233
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,212
Hard Edge-dition.
Right.

234
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,513
That's my boy!

235
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,815
Boy?

236
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,049
Shit, I'm a man.

237
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,517
What?
Nothin'.

238
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,457
This is great.

239
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,492
This is gonna be perfect.

240
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,994
Yeah!

241
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,330
Darryl.

242
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,900
This was a toaster

243
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,102
when Mrs. Reem
brought it in.

244
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,271
What is it now?

245
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,673
Why, it's better than
a toaster, Mr. Crudd.

246
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:15,508
It's a toaster plus.

247
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,978
See, wasted heat from the
toast rises up to the pan,

248
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,247
cooking the egg, which,
in turn, heats the coffee.

249
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,949
Once the coffee
starts to percolate,

250
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,751
the eggs flip out
onto the toast.

251
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,219
Just make it
a toaster again.

252
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,554
Okay.

253
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,326
Now, what is that?

254
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:36,463
It's a sound-activated aerodynamic,
insect predator, sir.

255
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,131
I don't like
the looks of that.

256
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,599
Don't be afraid.
It's like a dog.

257
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,302
If you run from it,
it'll...it'll chase ya.

258
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,372
But, Darryl, I want that
out of here.

259
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,540
You need to be
fixing things.

260
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,046
Now, look at that mess!

261
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,318
What are you doing
with that thing?

262
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,586
Down, boy.

263
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,255
Now, what happened?
Is...is that all right there?

264
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,591
Well, apparently
the fly left the room.

265
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,693
It's activated
by the buzz.

266
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:12,032
You are in big trouble.

267
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,234
Now, you just
clean up this mess.

268
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,836
Yes, Mr. Crudd.

269
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,020
Yes, so what's the plus
and minus on it?

270
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,756
Good. That's great news.
But, yeah, give it to Mark.

271
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:39,326
Hey, listen up, everybody!

272
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:42,029
Just got our
latest poll results,

273
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,630
and we're five points up!

274
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,101
Thanks to you!

275
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,303
And I want
to promise you

276
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,005
that when we're elected,

277
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,041
nothing is gonna
stand in the way

278
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,409
of the things that we promise
to do in this campaign.

279
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,979
And that's a guarantee.

280
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:03,750
Harris! Harris!
Harris! Harris!

281
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,185
What are you doing here?

282
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,719
The...The garbage
goes in the back!

283
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,055
Lady, what are you...

284
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,456
Give me that!

285
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,558
Get your hands off of her.

286
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,928
I want to wish
Mr. Harris good luck.

287
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,864
I understand you're doin' well
in the polls.

288
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,999
Maybe we can talk
somewhere private, huh?

289
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,934
Anything
you have to say to me,

290
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:24,304
you can say in front of these people.
We have no secrets.

291
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,840
Well, all right, uh,

292
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,542
I understand you're gonna need
some campaign contributions,

293
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,879
and I would like to be
one of the ones to contribute.

294
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,181
A cool million dollars.

295
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,383
Save your money,
Mr. Minelli.

296
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,888
You can't buy me.

297
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,790
How about I rent you
for a couple of years.

298
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,661
You can't even
window-shop.

299
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:49,762
Now, if you'll excuse me,

300
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,598
I've got a press conference
to attend to.

301
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,832
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

302
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,301
Hey, Harris,
I wanna talk to you.

303
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,702
You know, Harris.
Hey, Harris,

304
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,670
don't walk away with...

305
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,843
Nice office
you got here.

306
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,112
Don't work too hard.

307
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,449
Especially you, lady.
Life is short.

308
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,220
So must be that thing
in your pants.

309
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,528
Yeah.
See ya, Minelli.

310
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,843
Oh. Caught me
stealing coffee.

311
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,278
Yeah, I hear
the coffee downstairs

312
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,280
is even greasier
than the reporting.

313
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,983
All right,
so now you know I work at Hard Edition.

314
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,485
Uh-huh. I hear you're actually
a pretty good cameraman.

315
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,387
You've been asking about me,
haven't you?

316
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:50,523
I'll give you my card.
You don't gotta sneak around.

317
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,292
Here, uh, the digits
are right here.

318
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,726
The first one's the office,

319
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:54,962
the other one's
the important one.

320
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,663
That's the phone by the bed.

321
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,266
Oh, I bet that one
doesn't ring much.

322
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,101
I'll think about it.

323
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,771
Yes!

324
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,411
Kevin, it's me.
Come in. Over.

325
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:13,813
What?

326
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,548
Kevin, are you there?
Over.

327
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,150
Darryl, not now,
please.

328
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,485
Kevin, I can't hear you.

329
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,253
You have to talk into the buckle.
Over.

330
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,089
I said, not right now,
okay? I'm busy.

331
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,024
Closer, I can't hear you,
buddy.

332
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,692
Not now, please.

333
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,327
Closer. Over.

334
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,528
Not now, I'm busy.

335
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,230
Closer. Roger.

336
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,665
Look, this is as close
as I can talk, man, okay?

337
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,434
I would love
to play with you,

338
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,003
but now is not the time.

339
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,704
I got work to do.

340
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,172
So when I finish my work,

341
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,708
uh, we'll go in the bathroom.
I'll play with you then.

342
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,211
You know, make sure
everything's working,

343
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,279
and...and we can
check you out...

344
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,648
I thought about it,

345
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,817
and I just changed my mind.

346
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,127
I wasn't talkin'
to my jammy.

347
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,894
Oh, damn.

348
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,649
$5 from the Johnsons.

349
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,551
They don't have two nickels
to rub together,

350
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:25,918
and they still pitched in.

351
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,054
People know
a good cause

352
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,489
when they see one.

353
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,858
Nobody moves!
Give me all your money!

354
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,693
Now! That's it.

355
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,028
That, too.
Hand it over.

356
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,529
They're checks.

357
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,864
Hand it over.

358
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,332
You ought to think
about showering

359
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,701
if you want
to remain anonymous.

360
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,079
Good evening.

361
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,547
Michael Minelli
sends his regards.

362
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,226
* When your burdens

363
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:09,596
* Seem to weigh you down

364
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:14,134
* Or the road

365
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:17,837
* It seems too far
to carry on

366
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,475
* Just look to me

367
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,711
* And you will find
your help

368
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:28,748
* Which cometh from the Lord

369
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,484
* Hold on

370
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,688
* Even when you feel
you can't go on

371
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,024
* You don't have to moan

372
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,229
* Let your soul cry up

373
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,398
* To the Lord

374
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,667
* Cry on

375
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,436
* Cry

376
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,974
Come on, come on.
Give me that!

377
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,843
Don't!
What are you doing?

378
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,045
Darryl, talk.

379
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,781
You haven't said
a word all night.

380
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,283
What are you doing?
Stop it!

381
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,817
Come on, give me
the purse, lady!

382
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,187
Help me, somebody!

383
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,588
Come here!

384
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,023
Get outta here!

385
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,796
He's got a knife!
He's got a knife!

386
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,331
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna die!

387
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,741
Thank you, young man.
Thank you.

388
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,621
The rest of you
ain't shit!

389
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,757
Gee whiz, Kevin,

390
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,460
look what's happenin'
to our neighborhood.

391
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,762
They're gamblin'
right out in the open.

392
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,031
They're just throwin' bones, man.
They always do that.

393
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,500
Kevin, look at that car.

394
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,768
They have no respect
for the law anymore.

395
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,504
Gee whiz,
they're selling drugs

396
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,372
right across the street
from our house!

397
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,907
Darryl, it's a crack house.

398
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,542
That's what they do,
sell crack.

399
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,744
Well, they shouldn't
be doin' that.

400
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,580
Darryl, that's a crack house!

401
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,282
You let... Come here.

402
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,285
Darryl, you can't walk
in no crack house, man!

403
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,786
Those people
are animals.

404
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,388
They would sell their
own babies for a hit.

405
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,590
That's why somebody needs
to close that place down.

406
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,058
Well, I got news
for you, Urkel.

407
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,461
You don't need a permit
to open up a crack house.

408
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,862
You close that one down,

409
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,464
another one will open up
right next door.

410
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,633
You can't walk around
like some vigilante.

411
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,568
Why not?
Batman did it!

412
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:29,902
Batman?

413
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,839
Darryl, that was fantasy.
He had everything.

414
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,041
You live in reality.
You got nothin'.

415
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,743
You're no Batman.

416
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,380
Maybe I oughta be.

417
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,718
Bring your goofy ass on!

418
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,504
It's politics as usual
in the Mayor's office.

419
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,573
Newly elected mayor
Marvin Harris

420
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,941
has reappointed to
the City Building Commission

421
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:12,779
several reputed associates
of crime lord Michael Minelli.

422
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,315
So much for
campaign promises.

423
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,785
In other news, with no end
to the budget crisis in sight,

424
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:22,355
unpaid police continue
a citywide work slowdown,

425
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,824
which raises the question,

426
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,194
as crime escalates,
who will keep our streets safe?

427
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,829
I'm Kimberly Jonz.

428
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,130
And I'm saying good night.

429
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,565
* Yet another night

430
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:35,402
* You're doin'
the best you can

431
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,804
* To save the world
we live in

432
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,040
* If you do it right

433
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:44,110
* Someone needs
a helping hand

434
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,079
* You've got one
to be giving

435
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:52,018
* Don't wait around
for someone else

436
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:57,189
* You can make it happen
by yourself

437
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,558
* Hey, yeah, yeah

438
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,695
* Gonna show the rest,
gotta take a chance

439
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,798
* You can change
the world *

440
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:07,900
What?

441
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,968
Darryl.

442
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,136
What?

443
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,471
Darryl, what's...
What's goin' on?

444
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:12,705
What are you
doin' in there?

445
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,006
I'm busy.

446
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,308
Come on, come on, come on.

447
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,444
Stop all that noise.
Let's go back to bed.

448
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,946
Wait. Kevin,
don't go yet.

449
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,848
I want to show you
somethin'.

450
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,550
Kevin, are you ready?

451
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,284
Well, you better be,

452
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:27,454
because here I come!

453
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,392
Look! I'm a crime fighter!

454
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,395
What do you think?

455
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,564
If you walk out
on the street like that,

456
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,167
they gonna arrest you
and lock you in the nuthouse.

457
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,604
No, Kevin, this is real.
The costume is bulletproof.

458
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:47,239
Besides, look at all these
great gadgets I got.

459
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,741
See, these are handcuffs.

460
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,210
I got stink bombs

461
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,746
made from
concentrated flatulence.

462
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,448
I collected it
while you were sleepin'.

463
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,249
Ah! Powerful stuff.

464
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,186
And, Kevin, look at these.

465
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,090
Electric nunchakus.

466
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:10,663
Hey! Hey!

467
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,764
Sorry.

468
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,500
Man, this is a nightmare.

469
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,402
No, Kevin Walker,

470
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,970
the best is yet to come.

471
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,773
I made you an outfit, too.

472
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,143
J-5, retrieve
crime-fighting outfit.

473
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,647
All right, that's it.
Get out.

474
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,315
Get out,
get out now, Darryl!

475
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,752
Kevin,

476
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:35,455
remember you said

477
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:38,925
Batman had a costume
and gadgets? Well?

478
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,093
No, I said
Batman had money.

479
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,862
Which is why
I gotta go back to bed

480
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,399
to wake up to make some
for me and you.

481
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:49,902
Kevin, don't you want to make
the world a safer place?

482
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:57,410
I've been up all night.

483
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,111
Ever since
my grandmother died,

484
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,548
he's just gettin'
worse and worse.

485
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:02,949
I got bills to pay.

486
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,852
I can't even afford
to pay for the funeral.

487
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,424
How's that lesbian
necrophiliac story comin'?

488
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,259
Thanks for the love.

489
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,562
Hello, Betty!

490
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,133
Hello.

491
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,905
Now, what are you
doin' down here?

492
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:28,240
I came to see
if you were busy tonight.

493
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:31,410
I'm not busy tonight. What do you wanna do?
You wanna go out to eat?

494
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:33,713
Well, it's not exactly
what I had in mind.

495
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,415
I've got a guy who's gonna snitch
on Michael Minelli tonight,

496
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:39,986
and my best cameraman's sick,
so I'm desperate.

497
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,954
So you come to me, huh?

498
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,725
I know it's not exactly
sheep whipping

499
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,495
or public spankings,
but it's a job.

500
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,764
And, if things go well,
it could be full-time.

501
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,500
Look, you said you wanted to do real news,
right?

502
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:54,834
So here's your chance.

503
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:55,935
You in or out?

504
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:57,403
I'm in.

505
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,707
I'm not in exactly where
I want to be, but I'm in.

506
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:02,842
Darryl!

507
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,979
Darryl, I got great news!
I got a real news assignment!

508
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,281
Darryl?

509
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:11,651
Darryl.

510
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,954
Darryl, I got a real job.

511
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,868
Oh, my God.

512
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:46,285
Car 6239, report to
425 West 10th Street.

513
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:49,055
Disturbance in alley
of building.

514
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,927
Stop! Hey, wait,
wait for me!

515
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,495
Wait! Hold on!

516
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:59,131
Driver, quick, take me to
10th Street, on the double.

517
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,267
That's not my route.
I'm goin' to the South Side.

518
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,136
You don't understand.
There are innocent lives at stake.

519
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,372
I need your assistance.
I'm a crime fighter.

520
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,740
Yeah, yeah,
sure you are.

521
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:09,441
Listen, pal,
look in the back.

522
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,644
You're a freak
just like the rest of them.

523
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:13,713
Why don't you
get in the back or get out.

524
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,717
Driver, take me
to 10th Street now!

525
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:20,119
Get outta here!

526
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,088
Hey!

527
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,393
I want my money, girl!

528
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,996
I don't have it, Biff,
I swear.

529
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,331
Listen. Listen!

530
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:33,499
You better
come up with it

531
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,134
or I'm gonna have
to slap you around.

532
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,736
You understand me?

533
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:39,138
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

534
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,510
What the hell is this?
Is the circus in town?

535
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,713
Man, get outta here
before I hurt you.

536
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,114
Let the lady go.

537
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,515
You wanna take her place?

538
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:51,618
No.

539
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:53,653
But I will if I have to.

540
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:56,689
Don't you know, man,

541
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:59,125
I'll beat you like
you're one of my bitches?

542
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,829
Slap me around
and call me Susan.

543
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,001
I warned you, Susan.

544
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,356
Someone should help
that lady!

545
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,797
You give up?

546
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:39,431
Or you want me
to get rough with ya?

547
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,533
Listen,
you little creep,

548
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,135
you got three seconds

549
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,237
to get the hell
outta here!

550
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,338
One...

551
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,074
Two, three.

552
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,042
Go ahead and shoot me.

553
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:57,283
Listen!
Look what you made me do now!

554
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,919
I had to kill a guy in this goddamn alley!
Give me my money!

555
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,587
Hoo-hoo!

556
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,390
Want to try it again, pal?

557
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,325
What the hell are you?

558
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,629
Why don't you shoot him
in the head?

559
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:13,065
Yeah, shoot him in the head.

560
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,801
That's right.

561
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,969
I'm gonna shoot him
in the head.

562
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,204
Uh-oh.

563
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,641
Kevin!

564
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,823
Let's get out of here,
Darryl. Come on.

565
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,257
Don't call me
by my real name!

566
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,126
You're blowing
my secret identity.

567
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:42,829
Nobody knows who you are.
Let's go, loonyman.

568
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,063
I can't believe you,

569
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,264
wearing that
stupid costume.

570
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,398
I almost had him,
Kevin.

571
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,499
Did you like
what I did?

572
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:48,935
Yeah. That's what
I was gonna do.

573
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,269
That was
my Bruce Lee stuff.

574
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,938
I was gonna karate chop
him right in his...

575
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,039
Yeah, right.
Just come on.

576
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,977
Hey, Chuck.

577
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,213
You got to hear this.

578
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,182
Tell him who
you come to see.

579
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:06,152
I want to speak
to the Commissioner.

580
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,790
Tell him why.
Tell him why.

581
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:14,493
Duh. I'm a crime fighter.

582
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,929
And I had a run-in
with some punks last night,

583
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:19,098
and I'm trying to get
the cooperation of the police

584
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,834
as I take
these street punks down.

585
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,270
Wait a minute.
I don't see what's so funny.

586
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:27,339
What about your name?
Tell him your name.

587
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,876
Okay, I don't have one yet,

588
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,144
but I'm leanin'
towards Brotherman.

589
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,146
Brotherman!

590
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,382
Is someone behind me?
What's the joke?

591
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,616
I got a name for ya.

592
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,551
How 'bout Shitheadman?

593
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:42,889
I wanna see the Commissioner.

594
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:45,157
The Commissioner!

595
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,826
I'll go get him!

596
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,429
Oh, oh, Commissioner?

597
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,366
Shitheadman's here
to see you!

598
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,502
He's busy.

599
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,504
It's not a joke!

600
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,739
I'm not leaving here,
gosh darn it,

601
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,942
until I see
the Commissioner!

602
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:09,381
The judge said he can go as long
as you take him to a shrink.

603
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,750
Thanks a lot,
Officer.

604
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:15,354
Bye, guys. And remember
what I said.

605
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,857
A life of crime
is a waste of what?

606
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,058
Eat me! Take a hike!

607
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,292
Suck my shit!

608
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,560
Up your nose!
Sit on it!

609
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,330
Really think I reached
a couple of them.

610
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,033
Okay, Darryl,
what is this?

611
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,402
That's an aerial view
of the Fiji Islands.

612
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,138
Okay, and this?

613
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:34,473
A decorative
Incan burial mask.

614
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,875
And these?

615
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:40,212
Hmm, that's a tough one.
Uh...

616
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:43,850
Um...

617
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,085
I'm gonna pass.

618
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,920
Sure you wanna pass?

619
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,323
Okay.

620
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:55,461
The South American
Twitsue butterfly.

621
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,196
I gotta tell you, Kevin,

622
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:00,266
not only... Look at this,
not only is your brother normal,

623
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:02,201
he's...he's actually
rather brilliant.

624
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:03,569
The only problem I see

625
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,937
is that he's,
you know, a geek.

626
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,306
No. Uh-uh.
No, no, no, no, no.

627
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,808
Now, he's got problems.

628
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:12,011
He thinks he's a super hero.

629
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:14,446
Tell him how
you're a super hero.

630
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:17,249
I'm not a super hero,
silly billy.

631
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,251
All right, you just
gonna chump me, right?

632
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,854
Darryl, tell him
how you fight crime.

633
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,491
Kevin,

634
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,827
I'm an ordinary citizen.
The police fight crimes.

635
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:30,930
What's gotten
into you lately?

636
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:33,399
He is a super hero.

637
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,734
See, because last night
when we were fighting crime,

638
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:36,802
he gets shot, pow!

639
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:38,604
Bullets bounce
right off of him.

640
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,107
See, 'cause he invented this, uh,
jacket, makes the bullets bounce off.

641
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,709
I can't get any sleep lately,
'cause of him, right?

642
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,811
Plus, there's this female
at my workplace,

643
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:47,379
she thinks I'm not right,

644
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,581
'cause she caught me in the
xerox room talking to my nuts.

645
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,117
You were talking
to your testicles?

646
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,584
No, no, I was
talking to Darryl,

647
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:54,120
but it was through
my belt buckle.

648
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,555
You were talking to your
brother Darryl's testicles?

649
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:58,457
No, no, no, no.

650
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,359
Tell me about
your mother, Kevin.

651
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,461
Yo, man, you say
one more thing about my mama,

652
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:05,664
I will jump, snap,
mule-kick you right in the side of your head!

653
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,768
There's a lot of anger here.

654
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:12,404
Is there this much anger
around the house?

655
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:16,042
Dr. Norris, it's like living
with a swollen Gary Coleman.

656
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:24,450
Darryl, why did you
do that?

657
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,153
Now that doctor
thinks I'm crazy.

658
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:30,156
Why didn't you tell him
about the super hero thing?

659
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,791
Oh, yeah,
and give away my secret identity?

660
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,995
So you're...
So you're still not gonna give this up?

661
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:37,964
Kevin, this is my calling.

662
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,266
I have to make the world
a safer place for my children.

663
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,700
Your children?

664
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,003
You got to be
with a woman first!

665
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,837
You got to knock
some boots, man!

666
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,373
You a virgin!

667
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:51,243
No, I'm a gentleman.

668
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,746
Now, this is obviously
something that,

669
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,148
that you gotta do

670
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,017
in order to work
through Grandma's death.

671
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,851
Now, if that's what
you got to do, fine,

672
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,254
but we will
do this together.

673
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,356
But we gonna do it my way.

674
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,726
Okay, Karateman.

675
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:08,794
What?

676
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,229
That's your
crime-fighter name.

677
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,931
Uh-huh, no. I don't...
Don't call me that.

678
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,803
You call this
fighting crime?

679
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,206
Housing patrol?

680
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,541
Kevin, can't we
at least wear the costumes?

681
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:23,742
Hell, no.

682
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,911
I ain't puttin' on
them stupid costumes, man.

683
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:27,746
Help me! Help me!
You gotta help me.

684
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,481
What's wrong?
Somebody's following you?

685
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,084
No, no.
The lady in my building, she needs help.

686
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:33,552
Holy needy neighbor!

687
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,653
Was she
gettin' kidnapped?

688
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,455
No!
Her house is on fire?

689
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,957
No, she's stuck
in an elevator.

690
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:41,293
All right.
We got a situation.

691
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,828
You're gonna
help her, right?

692
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:43,862
Yeah, yeah.

693
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,264
Yeah, what building
is she in?

694
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:46,732
Down there. Follow me.

695
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,700
Where you goin'?

696
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,669
I gotta get something.
I'll be right back.

697
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,808
Help! Is anyone there?

698
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,912
Uh, look, we're gonna try and
get you out as soon as we can,

699
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,848
but you gotta
be patient, okay?

700
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,152
Step back.

701
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,553
What's that?

702
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,521
It's called
the speculum of life.

703
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:13,825
Here.

704
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:17,496
Insertion, come on!

705
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,366
Help!

706
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,705
Okay, step back.
There's fire in the hole.

707
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,047
I'm going in.

708
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:37,549
Whoa! Come on!

709
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:41,420
Quick, grab on.
I'll lower us down.

710
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:46,325
Oh, sure,
do it your own way.

711
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,697
Uh-oh, she's pregnant.

712
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,031
We're gonna
need an ambulance.

713
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:54,866
Don't worry,
I'll radio for help.

714
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,402
I'm in labor!

715
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,036
I'm gonna have
this baby right now!

716
00:33:58,104 --> 00:33:59,571
Mayday! Mayday!

717
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:02,074
We've got a pregnant situation here.
13 Fillmore Street.

718
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:04,610
I need assistance
now, please.

719
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:14,253
Okay, hang on, I'm comin' down.
Just hang on.

720
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,162
* I'm almost there now,
I'm almost there now

721
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,164
* Just hang on,
just hang on

722
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,833
* I'm almost there,
I'm coming *

723
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,536
Just keep breathin'.

724
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:33,639
Okay, help is on its way.
What are we gonna do?

725
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,807
I think we're gonna
have to deliver this baby.

726
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,644
We can't do that.
We'll have to see her thing.

727
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,479
Get down there
and catch this baby.

728
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:44,916
It's so ugly.

729
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:45,984
Just do it!

730
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,290
Push. Take my hand.

731
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:04,236
You have a big finger.

732
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,071
Thank you.

733
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,939
Whatever you're doing,
it's working.

734
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:10,142
I'm starting
to see something.

735
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:12,378
I see a head!
It's coming!

736
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:36,067
It's a boy! It's a boy.

737
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,240
I'm a father.

738
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,615
Could you let go
of my finger now?

739
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,717
All right.

740
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,452
Where's the baby?

741
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,455
He's bringing him up.
He delivered him.

742
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:57,723
He saved me.

743
00:36:12,238 --> 00:36:13,372
Bravo!

744
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,740
Wonderful.

745
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,142
Great photo.
You're a hero.

746
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:24,316
How precious.

747
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:25,451
That's a cutie.

748
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,152
Ah, look at him.

749
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,757
You were wonderful.
Who are you?

750
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:37,763
What?

751
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,198
Um, he's gone blank, ma'am.

752
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:41,267
Oh.

753
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,769
Blankman.

754
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:44,903
Oh.

755
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,772
You're a true hero,
Blankman.

756
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:53,044
Blankman.

757
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,682
Yeah.

758
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,418
* Super hero

759
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:00,886
* Yeah

760
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,758
* Yeah

761
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:15,534
* I am lucky if I learn
to read and write

762
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:19,705
* Where I live you must first
learn to stand and fight

763
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,941
* I'm the product of
the system I'm aware

764
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,076
* 'Cause my name

765
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:26,545
* Don't care

766
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,179
* Nobody cares

767
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,682
* I will
be a super hero

768
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,684
* Be a super hero

769
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,820
* Now, you must
understand

770
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:37,456
* Want you all to understand

771
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:39,024
* Be a super hero

772
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,626
* Well, well, well

773
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,994
* Just give me
half a chance

774
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,330
* Yeah

775
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:48,900
* Listen to my band

776
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:54,706
Help, Blankman! Help!

777
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,875
Fifi's stuck
under the house.

778
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,010
Don't worry. I'll save
your little puppy.

779
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:05,651
Please, save him.
Please, please, please.

780
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,953
* There's so much I can
and really want to do

781
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,088
Hi, Fifi.

782
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:13,024
* But I cannot
until I get through

783
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,025
* To you

784
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,093
Fifi!

785
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,797
Come on. Give me
the money. Come on.

786
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:19,865
* You must understand

787
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:20,932
Hurry up.

788
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:22,501
* Please understand

789
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:27,172
* Be a super hero

790
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,307
* Just give me
half a chance

791
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,309
* Just give me half a chance

792
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:37,749
* Listen to my band

793
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:41,186
And our closing story is
a hopeful one for a change.

794
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:45,391
It's about a caped crusader
who calls himself Blankman.

795
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,993
Numerous reports have come in
from police and citizens

796
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,228
about his heroic exploits.

797
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:53,932
In a city where joblessness
and lawlessness run rampant,

798
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:57,803
it's hard to believe that goodness
is actually coming back in style.

799
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:01,707
Well, if it is, this reporter
just wants to say thanks.

800
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,274
Keep doing what you're doing.

801
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,777
Apparently, one man
can make a difference.

802
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:17,956
Minelli wants
to see you.

803
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:20,125
Good. I want
to see him, too.

804
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,094
Gentlemen.

805
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,064
How you doin',
Mr. Mayor?

806
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:28,700
Listen, the DA Is investigating
that Civic Center thing,

807
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:31,069
so I want to shut
that thing down now.

808
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,371
Ah, don't worry about no
witnesses or anything though,

809
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:35,441
'cause, uh, we're gonna
take care of that.

810
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,544
Not only will
the investigation continue,

811
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,879
but I'm gonna recommend
to the District Attorney

812
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:44,550
that he issue a warrant for your
arrest on bribery and extortion.

813
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:48,420
You're kidding me, right?
What, are you bluffin'?

814
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,456
Oh, you're negotiating.

815
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,095
You're not kiddin' me.
You're not bluffin'.

816
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:59,064
You're not negotiatin'.

817
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:02,601
You're askin' for trouble?

818
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:03,769
Yeah.

819
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:07,573
I'm asking for trouble.

820
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:13,745
You're gonna get it.

821
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:21,987
What is all this stuff?

822
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,290
Neat, isn't it, Kevin?

823
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,826
People keep sending this
stuff to Blankman as a gift.

824
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,861
They even sent money.

825
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,463
Yeah? Really?
How much?

826
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,765
Yeah, one guy sent $5,000.

827
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:35,300
Great! Where's it at?

828
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,802
I gave it back.

829
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,705
I told him, hey, send me
all your appliances instead.

830
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:40,839
I mean, who needs...

831
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:41,907
Who needs money

832
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,175
when you got
neat stuff like this.

833
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,578
Let's see that.
Now, now, now, what is this?

834
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:48,880
That's a lower half
of a...a roller blade.

835
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,048
Wow!

836
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,619
The...The...
The lower half of a...

837
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:55,921
The bottom.
The bottom.

838
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,323
Have you lost your mind?

839
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:01,026
I guess we know
you lost your damn...

840
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,528
Get this shit
out of here!

841
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:05,664
Get all of it out!
All of it, Darryl!

842
00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:07,499
Get this stuff out, man!

843
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,501
Give me that!

844
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,404
What'd I just
throw out there?

845
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,506
Your radio.

846
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,608
My...
Darryl. Darryl!

847
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:20,679
Come here, Darryl!
Open up, Darryl.

848
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:22,848
Open this door!

849
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:28,053
* There's a magic
in your heart

850
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,355
* If you open it
you'll see

851
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,824
* A shining little face

852
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:35,226
* That smiles
for you and me *

853
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:37,195
Wait up, J-5. Wait up.

854
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,300
We gotta find us
a fortress of solitude.

855
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:45,537
So what do you think, J-5?
The Blank-store?

856
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:49,307
Nah, you're right.

857
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,042
Smells like urine.

858
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:55,280
What do you think, J-5?
The Blank-stop?

859
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,883
Nah?

860
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,886
You're right. It'd be
too cold in the winter.

861
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:09,260
An abandoned
old subway station.

862
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:11,296
This is perfect.

863
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,065
Wait up, J-5.

864
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:21,072
This could be the center of
our citadel of crime fighting!

865
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:27,979
The Blank-station.

866
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,783
Yeah.

867
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:37,555
Look, I think
we should do a follow-up

868
00:42:37,623 --> 00:42:39,157
on the Minelli scandal.

869
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,525
He's gone underground.

870
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:42,861
The FBI has frozen
all of his accounts.

871
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:44,329
No, no, no, listen.

872
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,564
I know,
everybody's been trying to get an interview

873
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:48,366
with Minelli for years,
right?

874
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:53,171
But I think what this city needs
is a more uplifting story.

875
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,707
I want to do an
interview with Blankman.

876
00:42:56,842 --> 00:42:57,843
Blankman?

877
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,978
Yeah, he's great
for this city.

878
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:01,847
He...He...He appears
out of nowhere,

879
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,149
he does a good deed,
then he just disappears.

880
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:05,851
He...He doesn't do interviews.

881
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,619
He doesn't seek publicity.
He doesn't...

882
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:09,688
Take money.
Yeah, I know.

883
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:11,923
Now,

884
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,626
the question is,

885
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:19,397
is he really
Mr. Wonderful or what?

886
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,532
So how do we find him?

887
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,069
How do we track him down?
Who knows him?

888
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:27,138
And most important,
how do we get him to talk?

889
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,377
Well, um,

890
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,846
I can get you a
one-on-one with Blankman.

891
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:37,415
You can? How?

892
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:40,351
Well, I just have to employ

893
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:44,890
certain top secret journalistic
techniques at my disposal.

894
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:49,527
Please!
Please, Darryl, do this interview.

895
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:52,898
Nope. I can't do it.
Sorry.

896
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,399
Blankman avoids the press.

897
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,634
He doesn't do this
for recognition.

898
00:43:56,702 --> 00:43:59,604
Well, then do it for me.
I'm trying to make an impression.

899
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:03,208
Kevin, me,
I'd do anything for you.

900
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,309
It's Blankman.

901
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,878
He's got a code.

902
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:09,047
Don't give me that
double identity stuff!

903
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:10,982
Now either you're gonna
do this interview

904
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:14,820
or...or Blankman and Darryl gonna be livin'
at the damn train station!

905
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:16,454
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. Just...Just...

906
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:17,522
Just think about it.

907
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:21,760
Little buddy?

908
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:24,529
Okay. I'll do it.

909
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:27,532
Tell her,
meet me at the 14th Street station at 6:00.

910
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,567
You got it!

911
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:31,502
Alone.
Okay.

912
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:33,905
And tell her
to wear a carnation.

913
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:35,707
Why a carnation?

914
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:39,177
You wouldn't understand.

915
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:43,381
Yes!

916
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,383
Quick, jump on.

917
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,285
It's rush hour.
There's a speeding train right behind me.

918
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:22,287
Come on, hurry up.
Don't be afraid.

919
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,389
Don't touch the third rail
or you're dead.

920
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:27,993
Come on!

921
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:47,612
Uh-oh. Looks like the 13's comin'
out of the station.

922
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,315
Better switch tracks.
Hold on.

923
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:59,557
What is this thing?

924
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:01,592
Oh, it's the Blank-wheel.

925
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:04,762
Where are we going?

926
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,097
What?

927
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:08,333
I said,
where are we going?

928
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:11,302
I can't hear you.
Wait, let me turn the engine off.

929
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:16,707
What'd you say?

930
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,343
I said,
where are we going?

931
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,511
Oh, to the Blank-station.

932
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:27,418
This is great!

933
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:28,419
Huh?

934
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:29,855
I said, this is great!

935
00:46:29,921 --> 00:46:31,022
I can't hear you!

936
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:32,891
Wait, let me turn
the engine off!

937
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:38,663
What'd you say?

938
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,265
I said, this is great.

939
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:41,532
Oh!

940
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:48,373
What?

941
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,142
Never mind!

942
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:52,577
I can't hear you.

943
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,245
Never mind!

944
00:46:57,582 --> 00:46:59,985
* Pretty lady
what's your name?

945
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:01,419
* Don't talk about it

946
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:02,620
* I want your number

947
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:05,790
* Just come and spend
the night with me, boy

948
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:08,894
* Pretty lady

949
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,461

00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:11,796
* I want your number

951
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:15,066
* Just come and spend
the night with me, boy

952
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,968
* Pretty, pretty lady

953
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:18,036
Whoa! Hey!

954
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:19,637

955
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:24,042
* Is can I have your name
so we can go

956
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:28,679
* I want to swing this life,

957
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:33,284
* I need one thing from ya,

958
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:35,186
* Pretty lady

959
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:36,521
* Oh, baby, baby

960
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:37,923
* Hey, what's your name?

961
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:39,290

00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:10,421
Wow, that was a great ride.

969
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:12,390
I was starting to
get a little dizzy.

970
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:15,326
Sorry about that, but I had to
make sure that you didn't remember

971
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:18,529
the secret location
of the Blank-station.

972
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:25,436
Oh, my gosh!
Look at this.

973
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:28,473
The white zone is
for immediate loading

974
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:32,043
and unloading of passengers only.
No parking.

975
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:34,545
Wow.

976
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:39,951
Don't be afraid.
It's just J-5.

977
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:42,287
Hello, Kimberly.

978
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,423
It talks.

979
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,258
That's all he can
say right now.

980
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:48,593
He's programmed
to do so much,

981
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,561
I wouldn't want to
overload him.

982
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:52,697
Hey, would you like
something to drink?

983
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,099
Yeah, sure.

984
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:01,872
Whoops.

985
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:14,319
Hey, you lost a shoe.

986
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:16,221
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

987
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,164
Look at all this stuff.

988
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:28,866
What do you think, J-5?

989
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:31,302
What do you call this stuff?

990
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:32,470
Junk!

991
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:36,707
Yeah, but it's great junk.

992
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:49,920
It's almost like you
live in a different world,

993
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,556
a better world.

994
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:57,362
Are you happy?

995
00:49:57,428 --> 00:50:01,232
How can I be happy when there's
still so much work to be done?

996
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:06,771
What do you think
makes you so special?

997
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:10,708
I don't think
I'm that special at all.

998
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:14,011
Just like everyone else,
I want to feel safe at night.

999
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,980
That's what
Blankman stands for.

1000
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:17,982
Every man who looks
out his window,

1001
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:21,352
sees something wrong,
and decides to do something about it.

1002
00:50:23,888 --> 00:50:24,989
Hold on.

1003
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,261
Do you have any family?

1004
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:33,198
I had a grandma.
She meant a lot to me.

1005
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,733
Somebody killed her.

1006
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,242
This has been
an amazing night.

1007
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:47,245
I'm sorry for taking up
so much of your time.

1008
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:49,847
I'm just curious,

1009
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:53,784
what was the carnation for?

1010
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:57,388
Well, a beautiful woman should
always wear a carnation, that's all.

1011
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:00,491
Thank you, Blankman.

1012
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,295
Or whoever you are.

1013
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:30,421
Hey, J-5, what's happening?

1014
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:41,832
Uh-oh!

1015
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:08,293
Is everybody hip
to Blankman, right?

1016
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:09,394
Yeah!

1017
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,628
You're all hip to Blankman.

1018
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:12,230
You know, when I first heard

1019
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:15,700
that there was a black guy in a
cape riding around in a police car,

1020
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:19,504
I said to myself, "Oh, damn,
I hope James Brown isn't in trouble again!"

1021
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,373
You know? Oh! Snap...

1022
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:27,878
Not only has he inspired an entire
city to stand up for itself,

1023
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,580
but now...

1024
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,617
Take a look at this.
This is Blank-mania sweeping the nation.

1025
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:36,787
And this has caused other super
people to come out of the woodwork.

1026
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:41,226
Midget Man,
what inspired you to become a super hero?

1027
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:45,630
Well, I think Blankman was an
important influence to all of us.

1028
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:48,833
But it's a big world,
and we all have to do our part.

1029
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,901
Let's say
you're in a situation,

1030
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:52,203
you're being accosted.

1031
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,971
Tell us
how you deal with it.

1032
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:55,072
Well...

1033
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:57,975
First thing...

1034
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,411
Oh, easy with that chair.

1035
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:02,012
I got it, I got it.

1036
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,448
Take it easy with that.
You don't want to...

1037
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:04,615
Oh, shi...

1038
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,384
No, no!

1039
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,788
And Gay Man,
you work primarily

1040
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:12,757
out of
the San Francisco area.

1041
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:14,425
I wanted to
be in the Army,

1042
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:16,126
but they discriminate.

1043
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,628
Mmm-hmm.

1044
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,697
And since I'm cruising
on the streets anyways,

1045
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:21,666
I just thought I would
get out there...

1046
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:23,568
That's so true
about discrimination.

1047
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:25,536
What's the matter with you?

1048
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:27,438
I'm in love.

1049
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,208
With who?

1050
00:53:31,276 --> 00:53:34,579
What? That robot you got?
What? You knock J-5 up?

1051
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:39,116
I'm in love
with Kimberly Jonz.

1052
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:43,254
Well, who isn't in love
with her, man. Get over it.

1053
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,423
Tonight I got the feeling

1054
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:47,858
that I was laying
on a bed of feathers,

1055
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:52,697
and there was two Q-Tips in both
ears and they were moving real fast.

1056
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:56,233
You know, that feeling you get
when someone you like kisses you.

1057
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,107
She kissed you?

1058
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,877
Yeah. No.

1059
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:08,746
She kissed Blankman.

1060
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:13,551
And that's the dilemma.

1061
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:16,354
If she should find out
that I'm Blankman,

1062
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,690
why, it could destroy her.

1063
00:54:20,558 --> 00:54:21,592
Um,

1064
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,729
Darryl,

1065
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:28,699
this was probably like a...a
buddy-buddy kiss. You know what I mean?

1066
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:32,069
Yeah, you're probably right.

1067
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:37,608
I didn't like that tongue
probing my mouth anyway.

1068
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:40,711
Tongue?

1069
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:50,655
Hey, somebody
got some roses.

1070
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:51,922
Did you read the card?

1071
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:54,191
No, somebody must have
dropped them off.

1072
00:54:56,627 --> 00:55:00,498
"From your would-be producer
who always produces." Me.

1073
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,571
Thanks.
They're nice.

1074
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:09,374
Uh, so,

1075
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,742
what happened with you
and Blankman last night?

1076
00:55:13,611 --> 00:55:14,945
He's kind of wack,
right?

1077
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:16,747
Oh, Kevin.
You gotta tell me.

1078
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:20,418
Um, he is... he is

1079
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:24,522
the most wonderful man I've
ever met in my entire life.

1080
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:25,690
Dar...
Uh, Blankman?

1081
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:26,924
Oh, yes!

1082
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,628
But, what...
Y'all didn't...

1083
00:55:30,695 --> 00:55:31,996
What's this?

1084
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,131
A box of chocolates,
which I also brought you.

1085
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,700
No, underneath that.

1086
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:40,237
Oh, how romantic.

1087
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,940
How romantic.

1088
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:46,511
A shoe?
A funky old shoe.

1089
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:48,779
Kimberly,
we're back from commercial.

1090
00:55:51,315 --> 00:55:52,683
Excuse me.

1091
00:55:55,886 --> 00:56:00,958
And in
five, four, three, two...

1092
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,093
Well, Blankman
does it again.

1093
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,262
Saying he was
inspired by his hero,

1094
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,465
Mayor Marvin Harris
has come up with a plan

1095
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:10,601
to stop the pending police
and city worker strike.

1096
00:56:10,668 --> 00:56:13,804
I've worked out a deal
to honor the city's IOUs.

1097
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:18,308
On Friday, any worker can redeem
them at the First City Bank.

1098
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,011
Special armored cars will bring
in all the necessary cash.

1099
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:25,015
And I ask Blankman,
whoever you are and wherever you are,

1100
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:27,618
to be on hand to
receive a special award.

1101
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:31,155
We are gonna start
standing up for ourselves.

1102
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:35,259
This city is going
into the Blankman era.

1103
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,263
Thank you, Mayor Harris.

1104
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:43,400
Thank you, kind citizens
of this great city.

1105
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:46,537
I'd like to take this
opportunity to thank

1106
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:48,639
someone very special
in my life.

1107
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:49,940
Love you, Blankman.

1108
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:53,210
Someone who supports me
and believes in what I do.

1109
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:54,945
We all believe in you.

1110
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:58,315
Someone who, whether they
know it or not,

1111
00:56:58,382 --> 00:57:02,553
has joined me
in my quest to fight crime.

1112
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:08,092
This person's a truly
wonderful and unique person.

1113
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:11,962
And I'd like to say
thank you to Kimberly Jonz.

1114
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:19,804
Blankman!

1115
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,409
You all want your money?

1116
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:26,744
Yes!

1117
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:28,178
Let's open the bank!

1118
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:42,459
Good morning, folks!

1119
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:44,695
Got you some happy
customers out there!

1120
00:57:46,897 --> 00:57:48,533
What?

1121
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,835
Don't even think about it!
Put your weapons down now! Put 'em down!

1122
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:52,102
Now, get out!

1123
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:53,337
You're crazy! Stop this!

1124
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:54,605
Everybody, get out!

1125
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,177
Don't hurt anybody.

1126
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:03,948
Hello, folks!
Say hello to the bad guys!

1127
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:05,282
Calm down.

1128
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:08,586
Everybody, get out!

1129
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:13,423
Move! Go! Move!
Let's go!

1130
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,263
What you guys, nuts?
There are a hundred pissed off cops outside.

1131
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,665
They haven't
been paid in weeks.

1132
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:22,199
You'll never get
through the doors.

1133
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:35,012
Hello, Mr. Mayor.

1134
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,582
You know,
anyone can rob a bank,

1135
00:58:37,648 --> 00:58:40,150
but it takes a real man
to do it in satin.

1136
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:44,254
Blankman, I'm Police
Commissioner Gains.

1137
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:45,690
How do you
want to handle this?

1138
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:48,058
Uh,

1139
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:51,028
maybe I could
reason with them?

1140
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:52,763
Great.
We'll be right here.

1141
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,866
You are not gonna do this.
I'm not gonna let you...

1142
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:57,467
Everyone else
stay out of it.

1143
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,769
Blankman
will handle it.

1144
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:00,571
Blankman! Blankman!

1145
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:06,777
Blankman! Blankman!
Blankman! Blankman!

1146
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:11,415
Blankman! Blankman! Blankman!
Blankman! Blankman! Blankman!

1147
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:16,320
Blankman! Blankman!
Blankman! Blankman!

1148
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,622
* They're gonna kill me

1149
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:21,058
* They're gonna smash me
like a little bug

1150
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:23,861
* I'm a dead man
Yes, I'm a dead man *

1151
00:59:23,928 --> 00:59:26,163
Blankman! Blankman!
Blankman!

1152
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,497
Hello?

1153
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:30,901
Mr. Burglars?

1154
00:59:30,968 --> 00:59:35,239
You think maybe we could talk about
this hostage thing like gentlemen?

1155
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,608
Huh? Okay.

1156
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:40,878
I tried.

1157
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,049
You came to make
a deposit, Blankman?

1158
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:48,152
Everybody get back
or I'll blow you away! Now!

1159
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:55,225
Oh, hello, Blankman.

1160
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:56,426
What brings you here?

1161
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:58,595
What, are they givin'
away calendars today?

1162
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,399
Michael "The Suit" Minelli.

1163
01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:06,270
You'll never get away with this,
you diabolical fiend!

1164
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,405
You fiend?

1165
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:12,209
This kid, he talks like he's out
of the funny papers or something.

1166
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:13,978
What did you do
with the Mayor?

1167
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:15,279
Oh, say, listen,

1168
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:17,982
Blankman, I've got some
good news about the Mayor.

1169
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:20,384
Uh, they had a recent
opinion poll

1170
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,019
and the results
just came in.

1171
01:00:23,888 --> 01:00:25,690
He's goin' sky high!

1172
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:31,561
All right, chain him up
with the Mayor, boys!

1173
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,364
We want our money!
Everyone please stay calm!

1174
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:38,568
Blankman has the situation
under control!

1175
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:42,606
I repeat, Blankman
has the situation

1176
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:45,209
under control!

1177
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:48,212
Now, this bomb will probably
take about 10 minutes

1178
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:50,280
for the bomb squad
to diffuse.

1179
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:53,317
So, I think
I'm gonna set it

1180
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:55,452
for

1181
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:57,654
three minutes.

1182
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,526
Now, uh,
how can I say it?

1183
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:04,895
Don't go to pieces.

1184
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:10,367
Sammy.

1185
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:12,536
Okay, boys,
we got three minutes.

1186
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,171
Less!

1187
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:15,439
Let's go!

1188
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,007
Come on, out through here.

1189
01:01:17,074 --> 01:01:20,811
Must get to Blank-belt now.

1190
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:23,347
Must spray floor

1191
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:27,785
with super-slick Blank-goop.

1192
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:29,386
Ah, there.

1193
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:32,456
Now, put together stink bomb.

1194
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,127
And get stink bomb to them.

1195
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:40,197
Hold your breath, Mayor.
This may get funky.

1196
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:44,769
Oh, that's foul!

1197
01:01:44,835 --> 01:01:46,603
Oh, what is that smell?

1198
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,639
I'm outta here!

1199
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:54,344
See if you can
close the vault.

1200
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,614
Tony, the vault!

1201
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:02,987
He's locked the door
with the money inside!

1202
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:05,522
Get out, everybody!
Let's go! Let's go!

1203
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:09,126
Hurry up, morons!

1204
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:12,963
Good thinking, Blankman. At least those
scumbags won't get the city's money.

1205
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,365
One thing
they didn't count on

1206
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:18,535
was my ability

1207
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:22,940
to get myself

1208
01:02:23,007 --> 01:02:24,308
out of

1209
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:28,312
tight situations.

1210
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:29,814
We want our money!

1211
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,715
Excuse me.

1212
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:33,984
Hey! Wait, stop that guy!

1213
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:35,853
After him! Stop him!

1214
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:43,327
Hello?

1215
01:02:43,393 --> 01:02:45,562
I'm telling you
it's not possible.

1216
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:46,696
Hello?

1217
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,399
Kevin? Go away.
It's not safe.

1218
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:51,936
Will you get him
outta here?

1219
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:54,104
Oh, my God!

1220
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:56,540
What happened here?

1221
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:59,043
Blankman, would you go?

1222
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,011
Does this thing mean
what I think it means?

1223
01:03:01,078 --> 01:03:03,680
Will you just get him out of here, please?
Both of you.

1224
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:04,982
Do you know
what you're doin'?

1225
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:06,984
Yeah. All I have
to do now

1226
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:09,286
is separate
this wire here and...

1227
01:03:09,353 --> 01:03:11,588
No, I don't know what I'm doing.
Move out of the way.

1228
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:13,858
Do you know what?

1229
01:03:13,924 --> 01:03:15,159
This white man is dead.

1230
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:16,927
You can't save him.
Come on, let's go.

1231
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:18,428
I gotta save him!
Please, go!

1232
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:19,796
Wait, let me think.

1233
01:03:19,864 --> 01:03:23,533
Let me think.
Just "A" positive, "B" positive.

1234
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,003
"A." "A."
Think positive and...

1235
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,104
Ah!

1236
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:28,138
I did it!

1237
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:30,474
You did it!

1238
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,043
Damn, man!

1239
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:35,412
Shh! Shh!

1240
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:38,415
I still hear ticking.

1241
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:39,616
You hear what?

1242
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:44,221
Why do I still hear ticking?

1243
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,293
This bag is full
of explosives.

1244
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,332
You did
what you could.

1245
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:57,868
Go. Go!

1246
01:03:57,935 --> 01:04:00,437
He's got a point.
Let's just get outta here!

1247
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:03,941
Wait. Wait!

1248
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:09,446
Eleanor Walker
was my grandmother.

1249
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,015
She really
believed in you.

1250
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:13,717
She was a good woman.

1251
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,486
I'll give her your love.

1252
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,356
The clock, gentlemen.

1253
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:21,091
The clock!

1254
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:22,526
Come on!
Let's go!

1255
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:24,761
Get back!

1256
01:04:40,444 --> 01:04:43,547
That is the bravest thing I've ever
seen anybody do in my entire life!

1257
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,849
We almost
got killed with a boom.

1258
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:49,253
Mayor Harris is dead.

1259
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:51,121
Yeah, but you did
what you could.

1260
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:53,023
No one else would
have gone in there.

1261
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,224
Excuse me, hello?

1262
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:55,926
Can I at least
get a handshake?

1263
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:02,532
What about my money?
I need my money!

1264
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:04,634
Hey, I ain't
been paid in weeks!

1265
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:06,103
We're supposed
to get our checks!

1266
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,972
Where's my money?
I want my money!

1267
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:09,473
I need my check cashed!

1268
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:11,308
I've got
hungry kids at home!

1269
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:13,343
Yeah, this stinks!
Where's my money?

1270
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,213
Blankman was
in control here.

1271
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,448
He's a coward! He ran away!

1272
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:21,085
Yeah, I...I told him
not to go in there!

1273
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,686
He killed the Mayor!

1274
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,588
Get him!

1275
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:28,292
Blankman, you're responsible,
and you know it!

1276
01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:33,030
I think you better
get outta here.

1277
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:34,264
I think you're right.

1278
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:36,500
Blankman, you're dead meat!

1279
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:39,669
Get him!

1280
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,507
Get him!

1281
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:46,176
Police Commissioner
Gains has put the blame

1282
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:48,078
squarely on
Blankman's shoulders,

1283
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:51,015
referring to the fleeing
ex-role model as

1284
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:54,251
"A quivering, spineless,
world-class coward."

1285
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:56,220
If we made any mistake,

1286
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,921
it was trusting
this supposed hero

1287
01:05:57,988 --> 01:06:00,224
who runs around
in his Grandma's underwear

1288
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,692
with a smelly sock
taped across his face.

1289
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:05,895
We never believed in a million
years that he'd kill Mayor Harris

1290
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,931
and selfishly save himself.

1291
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:10,700
We're your police department,
folks of this community.

1292
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,502
We're here to
protect and serve,

1293
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:14,604
not a guy who's out
robbing laundromats

1294
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,340
so he can have a good time.

1295
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:20,410
I'm not gonna
do it anymore, J-5.

1296
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:21,845
I'm sorry.

1297
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:24,148
Hello, Kimberly.

1298
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:26,416
Don't you make it harder
than it already is!

1299
01:06:48,472 --> 01:06:51,808
The procession worked its way
through the downtown area

1300
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,510
as the city said farewell,

1301
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:55,712
finally winding down
in the neighborhood

1302
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:58,282
where Mayor Harris
had spent his childhood

1303
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:01,118
among the people
he referred to as family.

1304
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:03,120
Darryl,

1305
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:07,124
you gotta
get over this.

1306
01:07:07,191 --> 01:07:10,660
You've been sitting here watching
this stuff for three days.

1307
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:12,629
That wasn't
your fault.

1308
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:19,869
All I wanted
to do was help.

1309
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:25,309
You don't have
to be a hero, Darryl.

1310
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,212
Why don't you try
being like everyone else?

1311
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,849
How am I gonna do that?

1312
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:35,119
You can start
by gettin' a job.

1313
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:37,053
Hello. Welcome to McDonald's.

1314
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:38,422
May I take your order, please?

1315
01:07:38,488 --> 01:07:39,823
Yeah, I just
need a burger, man.

1316
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,391
Would you like
some fries with that?

1317
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,260
No, I'm all right.

1318
01:07:43,327 --> 01:07:44,561
Sure? They're cooked to a crispy,
golden perfection.

1319
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:45,929
Yeah, man,
I'm sure, all right?

1320
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:47,097
Perhaps a soda?

1321
01:07:47,164 --> 01:07:48,965
You know
we're doing salads now.

1322
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:51,701
People don't expect that from McDonald's.
Chunky chicken salad.

1323
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:54,404
Look, man, could you just give
me my damn burger, all right?

1324
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:57,341
Would you like that
for here or to go?

1325
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,309
Goofy asshole.

1326
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:01,211
He's just a little
McMad right now.

1327
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:05,182
* When we are strong
it doesn't matter

1328
01:08:05,249 --> 01:08:07,951
* If we have no time
we can make it

1329
01:08:20,264 --> 01:08:23,333
Hey! That's my purse!
Give me my purse! It's mine!

1330
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,369
Stop 'em! Stop 'em!

1331
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:27,837
Weak, goofy bastard!

1332
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,641
* To the future

1333
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:37,181
* To the future

1334
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:41,050
So this is
Hard Edition, huh?

1335
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,354
Michael Minelli.

1336
01:08:47,557 --> 01:08:49,659
Larry Stone.
Pleased to meet ya.

1337
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,529
How'd you
track me down, Stone?

1338
01:08:52,596 --> 01:08:55,699
This is tabloid television.
We can do anything.

1339
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:58,602
What is it
you want from me?

1340
01:08:58,668 --> 01:09:03,273
Rumor has it you're, uh,
looking for the Blankman.

1341
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:06,910
Everyone knows
the Blankman has disappeared.

1342
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,479
Nobody's seen him,
not for weeks.

1343
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:14,718
I can give you the Blankman.

1344
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:16,520
What's in it for you?

1345
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:18,388
Ratings, Mr. Minelli.

1346
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:22,025
Ratings give me a woody.

1347
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:26,062
But, to get ratings,
you gotta have a star.

1348
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:31,100
David Koresh, 52 days
in the number one spot.

1349
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,969
Wanted to run a summer camp.

1350
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:35,705
I said, David,
why be a counselor

1351
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:39,008
when you can
be the messiah?

1352
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:42,679
Now you, you, I can't
make the messiah.

1353
01:09:42,746 --> 01:09:46,316
But you give me an exclusive interview,
I give you the Blankman.

1354
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:48,151
I don't make deals.

1355
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:52,155
And I don't
do television.

1356
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,394
Where is the Blankman?

1357
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:59,829
Hey, Einstein,
I don't know if you noticed,

1358
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:01,998
but, uh, this ain't
a boil on my ass.

1359
01:10:02,065 --> 01:10:03,533
It's a wheelchair.

1360
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,369
I'm paralyzed
from the waist down.

1361
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:07,971
I can't
feel a damn thing.

1362
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:10,173
I felt that.

1363
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:15,111
You through?

1364
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:22,786
I like this guy!

1365
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:25,722
He ain't got no legs,
but he's got balls!

1366
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,158
Come on,
take a walk with me.

1367
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,193
Have a seat.

1368
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,495
All right.

1369
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:34,898
Now,

1370
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:37,301
I happen to know
that Blankman

1371
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:39,869
has the hots
for a certain reporter.

1372
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:42,472
A lady by the name
of Kimberly Jonz.

1373
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:49,313
I had a grandma.
She meant a lot to me.

1374
01:10:50,046 --> 01:10:52,449
But somebody killed her.

1375
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:59,423
Minelli one time whacked out an old
lady for givin' him a dirty look.

1376
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:04,193
...not yet released
the names of the victims,

1377
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,830
but it is rumored
that among the fatalities

1378
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:09,466
is 68-year-old Eleanor Walker,

1379
01:11:09,533 --> 01:11:13,337
a local resident who runs this
chapter of the Harris campaign.

1380
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,740
This is Kimberly.

1381
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:19,142
Uh, I think I figured out
who killed your grandmother.

1382
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:28,752
Hello, Blankman?

1383
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:34,290
No, this is not Kimberly.
This is Minelli.

1384
01:11:34,358 --> 01:11:37,260
If you ever want to see this
pretty little Kimberly again,

1385
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:40,797
you better come down to
the TV station right now.

1386
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:42,131
Yes.

1387
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:44,634
Oh, and, uh, Blankman,

1388
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,470
don't forget to
wear your tights.

1389
01:12:02,552 --> 01:12:04,187
No.
No? Have a nice day.

1390
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:06,956
Thank you. Come again.
Hi, welcome to McDonald's.

1391
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:08,992
Darryl, Minelli just
took over the newsroom!

1392
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:12,028
I'm sorry, sir. You're gonna have to
stand in line like everyone else.

1393
01:12:12,095 --> 01:12:15,532
You don't understand!
Minelli just took Kimberly hostage.

1394
01:12:15,599 --> 01:12:16,966
My God, he's got Kimberly?

1395
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:19,903
He says he's gonna kill her
unless Blankman shows up.

1396
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,972
The police ain't doin' jack!
Man, you gotta save her.

1397
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,675
I don't wanna get involved.
I don't do that stuff anymore.

1398
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:26,776
I'm normal now.

1399
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:28,478
I'm Darryl Walker,
Crew Chief.

1400
01:12:28,545 --> 01:12:30,013
Ronald McDonald's
coming next week.

1401
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:31,981
I'm supposed to
whip this place into shape.

1402
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:34,484
I'm not talkin' to Darryl,
I'm talkin' to Blankman.

1403
01:12:34,551 --> 01:12:36,185
This is serious.

1404
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,655
Hi, welcome to McDonald's.

1405
01:12:38,722 --> 01:12:39,956
May I take
your order, please?

1406
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:41,290
Would you like
fries with that?

1407
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,892
Stop it!

1408
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:46,295
Minelli killed Grandma.

1409
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,068
He killed Grandma?

1410
01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:58,875
Then I gotta take him down.

1411
01:12:58,942 --> 01:13:00,877
This time I'm with you.

1412
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,548
You gonna wear your costume?

1413
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:06,182
Man, I'm not
wearin' that...

1414
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:07,784
I need three more burgers,
please.

1415
01:13:07,851 --> 01:13:10,186
Darryl, I will wear
the costume! Let's just go!

1416
01:13:10,253 --> 01:13:12,188
We gonna take him down
together, me and you?

1417
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:13,823
Yes, let's go.
Like a team.

1418
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,359
Darryl, come on. I'll be right back.
I gotta punch out.

1419
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:20,329
Curses. I can't get
the hang of that thing.

1420
01:13:29,806 --> 01:13:31,575
Hello, Kimberly.

1421
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:34,778
No time for small talk, buddy.

1422
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:36,713
To the Blank-screen.

1423
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:42,819
Okay,
I can pull up the plans to the news building

1424
01:13:42,886 --> 01:13:44,488
on the Blank-screen.

1425
01:13:44,554 --> 01:13:46,956
They're gonna expect us
to come in through here.

1426
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:51,528
We can get the drop on 'em
by coming up in through here.

1427
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:53,897
Well, why don't we just
go through the front?

1428
01:13:53,963 --> 01:13:58,034
Because that'll take all the fun out of it,
silly billy gumdrops!

1429
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:01,605
To the Blank-suits!

1430
01:14:02,972 --> 01:14:04,908
Okay, that's your costume.

1431
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:07,777
And I'll once again
don the Blank-suit.

1432
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:13,483
* Be a super hero

1433
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:16,119
* Now you must understand

1434
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:18,254
* Want you all to understand

1435
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:19,823
* Be a super hero

1436
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:21,357
* Well, well, well

1437
01:14:22,526 --> 01:14:23,993
This is great!

1438
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,328
Huh?

1439
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:28,131
I said,
this is fantastic!

1440
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:29,733
I can't hear you.

1441
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,668
I said, this is great!

1442
01:14:31,735 --> 01:14:32,836
I can't understand...

1443
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:34,403
Shut up and drive.

1444
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:40,710
* Don't tell me
that I am not worthy

1445
01:14:40,777 --> 01:14:45,448
* After 400 years
overtime

1446
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:49,553
* Give us what you
give your brothers

1447
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:53,657
* Then you'll understand

1448
01:14:53,723 --> 01:14:56,225
* That I won't be
your super hero

1449
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:58,061
* I wanna be a hero

1450
01:14:58,127 --> 01:15:03,066
* Until you give us
all you can *

1451
01:15:03,132 --> 01:15:06,035
Mr. Minelli,
you're reported to have mob connections.

1452
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:07,604
Have you ever
committed a crime?

1453
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:10,173
No, I've never
committed a crime in my life.

1454
01:15:11,474 --> 01:15:14,477
No, goddamn it, no!

1455
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:17,146
You're asking him
all the easy questions!

1456
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:20,617
Probe deeper!
Dig into him! Edge!

1457
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:21,851
Right, edge.

1458
01:15:21,918 --> 01:15:24,220
Uh, Mr. Minelli,
are you gay?

1459
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:30,860
Goddamn!
Now that's edge!

1460
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:31,928
Hey!

1461
01:15:31,995 --> 01:15:33,797
I'm sick and tired
of this crap.

1462
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,865
You told me that Blankman
was gonna be here,

1463
01:15:35,932 --> 01:15:37,266
and he ain't here!

1464
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:39,302
Now, not only am I
gonna have to kill her,

1465
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,370
I'm gonna have to
kill you, too!

1466
01:15:41,437 --> 01:15:44,574
But, because I'm a gentleman,
I'm gonna kill the lady first.

1467
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:47,310
Yes, Miss Anchor Lady,
this just in.

1468
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,746
Your time is up.

1469
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,383
No. Do something.
He's crazy! You're crazy!

1470
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:02,458
You better check your sources
on that story, Minelli.

1471
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:04,794
You might have
got a bad lead.

1472
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:06,663
Blankman.

1473
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:09,799
I see you finally got somebody to work
with you who dresses worse than you do.

1474
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:11,701
And what is your name,
Other Guy?

1475
01:16:11,768 --> 01:16:13,469
Well, I don't really
have one yet.

1476
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:15,504
How about poorly-dressed
dead man?

1477
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,840
Get 'em, guys!

1478
01:16:21,444 --> 01:16:24,648
Get in there! Get in there!
Get in there and fight for God's sake!

1479
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:25,715
Get 'em!

1480
01:16:25,782 --> 01:16:27,383
Take 'em out!
They're gaining on us!

1481
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:28,584
Get 'em, you idiots!

1482
01:16:28,652 --> 01:16:29,919
Back to back!

1483
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:34,624
How you doin'?
Oh, man!

1484
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:45,001
Take that, you fiend!

1485
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:00,583
All right,
I'll handle this myself!

1486
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:03,386
I got a swell idea
for you two.

1487
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:16,432
Isn't this great?
We'll never get out of here alive.

1488
01:17:16,499 --> 01:17:19,402
Well, that's... that's
the whole plan, Blankman.

1489
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,738
And while you're in there,
I have rigged up

1490
01:17:21,805 --> 01:17:24,407
a secret bomb
that is going to go off

1491
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,443
and blow up this building
in about five minutes.

1492
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,946
Holy double jeopardy!

1493
01:17:30,546 --> 01:17:31,848
You're good.

1494
01:17:31,915 --> 01:17:33,482
And when this bomb
goes off,

1495
01:17:33,549 --> 01:17:36,652
you are gonna be held
responsible, postmortem.

1496
01:17:38,221 --> 01:17:39,689
Hey, Minelli!

1497
01:17:40,623 --> 01:17:43,993
Look, you got
what you wanted.

1498
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:45,661
Why don't you let
Kimberly go?

1499
01:17:45,729 --> 01:17:48,197
Right. And put me down, too.
You don't want me.

1500
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:50,499
No, the broad stays.

1501
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:52,368
And Stone, I'm really sorry

1502
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:54,370
that I messed up
your show.

1503
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:56,005
Not at all.

1504
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:58,174
Then I'm sorry
I ruined your life.

1505
01:18:00,744 --> 01:18:03,579
Is this the end
of our episode?

1506
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:05,782
Will the dynamic duo defy

1507
01:18:05,849 --> 01:18:08,885
their death-defying
drowning death trap?

1508
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:11,220
Or will...

1509
01:18:11,287 --> 01:18:14,290
Who will dislodge Other Guy's
fist away from Blankman's eye?

1510
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,059
Darryl, would you
quit messin' around?

1511
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,293
This is serious!

1512
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,796
Kevin, stop being
a pessimist!

1513
01:18:19,863 --> 01:18:22,365
This tank is not half full,

1514
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:24,333
it's half empty!

1515
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,970
All right, that... that's great.
You have lost your mind now.

1516
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,638
This is life or death!

1517
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,809
If my plan
serves me correctly,

1518
01:18:34,077 --> 01:18:37,080
J-5 should be gingerly
on his way!

1519
01:18:51,527 --> 01:18:52,796
You'll see.

1520
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:54,964
He's coming!

1521
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,591
J-5, come on.

1522
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:30,433
J-5, get up!
Come on! Come on!

1523
01:19:36,873 --> 01:19:38,241
J-5!

1524
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:39,508
Hello, Kimberly.

1525
01:19:39,575 --> 01:19:41,477
Do something, J-5.
Save them.

1526
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:44,981
Do something.
Hurry, J-5.

1527
01:19:45,048 --> 01:19:47,817
Do it, J-5, do it.
Save them.

1528
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:07,670
Kick the glass!

1529
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:10,940
The holes have
weakened the glass.

1530
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,909
You can do it, Kickman!

1531
01:20:23,252 --> 01:20:24,720
We've gotta
cut the chains.

1532
01:20:24,787 --> 01:20:26,089
We gotta
find the bomb.

1533
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:29,025
No, there's no time.
It could be anywhere.

1534
01:20:30,193 --> 01:20:31,627
Save yourself.

1535
01:20:31,694 --> 01:20:34,263
There's no point
in us all dying.

1536
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,765
I'll never forget you,
my lover.

1537
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,471
That's a Blank-joke.

1538
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:48,011
You're so wonderful to keep your sense
of humor during such a time of crisis.

1539
01:20:51,314 --> 01:20:52,515
Electronics.

1540
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:54,783
Think about electronics.
Electronics.

1541
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,253
J-5. Quick.

1542
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:00,723
Vacuum power pack, on.

1543
01:21:03,927 --> 01:21:08,097
Dry these little wings,
so these birdies can fly.

1544
01:21:08,164 --> 01:21:11,334
Oh, Blankman,
you're such a poet.

1545
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,002
Don't you know it.

1546
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:14,037
Easy!

1547
01:21:16,973 --> 01:21:19,742
Wait a minute.
How we gonna find a bomb in this building?

1548
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:23,546
We can't. But J-5 can.

1549
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:28,017
I'll just switch him to anti-terrorist,
bloodhound, bomb-sniffing mode.

1550
01:21:28,084 --> 01:21:30,987
Okay, J-5,
smell the explosives.

1551
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,289
Smell it, boy.
Yeah, yeah.

1552
01:21:33,356 --> 01:21:35,324
Find the explosives, boy.
Go ahead, find it.

1553
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:38,194
Come on! Go, J-5.
Go, boy, go.

1554
01:21:38,261 --> 01:21:41,364
He found something.
He's onto something.

1555
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,900
Go, J-5!
Yeah, baby.

1556
01:21:44,968 --> 01:21:46,702
Yes!
He's got something, right?

1557
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:48,071
What is it?

1558
01:21:49,805 --> 01:21:52,808
The woman's bathroom.
That fiend!

1559
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:55,778
The one place he knew
we couldn't go into.

1560
01:21:58,047 --> 01:21:59,248
Come on, J-5.

1561
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,588
What is it, J-5?
You see something in here?

1562
01:22:11,494 --> 01:22:12,695
Did you find a bomb?

1563
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,763
Yeah, but not the one
we're lookin' for.

1564
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:18,934
He's onto something.
Where, boy?

1565
01:22:19,002 --> 01:22:21,204
In there? There's something
in there, boy?

1566
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,571
Stand back.

1567
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:24,807
It's the bomb.

1568
01:22:26,009 --> 01:22:29,112
J-5, convert to
bomb-disposal unit now!

1569
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,453
I hope this works.

1570
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,856
He's only certified to handle
but so much explosives.

1571
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:47,930
Okay, Kevin,
let's save Kimberly.

1572
01:22:47,997 --> 01:22:50,733
J-5, to the street. Now!

1573
01:22:53,836 --> 01:22:55,404
Darryl, wait a minute.
Hold up.

1574
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:56,572
Please.

1575
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:57,873
Call me Blankman.

1576
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,208
Okay. Blankman.

1577
01:22:59,275 --> 01:23:00,876
Do we have to tell Stone?

1578
01:23:00,943 --> 01:23:04,013
'Cause you just said the building
is not going to blow up, right?

1579
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,050
Look, I don't care what games you play,
little buddy.

1580
01:23:07,116 --> 01:23:10,419
My only concern is
one Miss Kimberly Jonz.

1581
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,055
That's all
I wanted to know.

1582
01:23:13,889 --> 01:23:15,458
Hang on, my love!

1583
01:23:16,892 --> 01:23:20,329
We can't find the bomb.
We can't find the bo...

1584
01:23:21,064 --> 01:23:22,998
Run!

1585
01:23:23,066 --> 01:23:24,333
It's gonna blow!

1586
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,468
Play along.

1587
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:27,636
It's gonna blow!
We can't find the bomb!

1588
01:23:27,703 --> 01:23:29,672
The whole thing's
gonna blow!

1589
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:31,974
What do you mean
you can't find the bomb?

1590
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:35,844
We can't find it.
We messed up!

1591
01:23:35,911 --> 01:23:38,914
And the building's gonna blow!
And when it does...

1592
01:23:38,981 --> 01:23:41,617
Boom!
Wheelchair over here, cowboy boot over there.

1593
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:45,288
All right, get me out of this thing.
Come on!

1594
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,090
Blankman says
there's no time.

1595
01:23:47,156 --> 01:23:50,459
He says there's only time
enough to save baby girl.

1596
01:23:51,627 --> 01:23:54,263
What?
You're gonna leave me?

1597
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:56,532
He says
you got to be strong.

1598
01:23:56,599 --> 01:23:57,900
Be strong.

1599
01:23:57,966 --> 01:24:01,637
What? You're just
gonna leave me here?

1600
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:05,208
I'll never forget you.
I'm gonna call your mama now.

1601
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:08,277
Get back here,
you son of a bitch!

1602
01:24:08,344 --> 01:24:09,612
I'll kill you!

1603
01:24:09,678 --> 01:24:12,381
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
I'll kick your ass!

1604
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:16,185
Other Guy, watch Kimberly.
Go! Go!

1605
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:19,355
Come on! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1606
01:24:19,422 --> 01:24:21,824
He's gonna explode!
Get out, everybody!

1607
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,259
He's gonna explode!

1608
01:24:23,326 --> 01:24:24,427
Get out!

1609
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:33,469
Good luck, buddy.
Good luck.

1610
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:47,316
J-5! J-5, thank God
you're all right, buddy.

1611
01:24:56,925 --> 01:25:00,596
J-5! J-5, speak to me!

1612
01:25:00,663 --> 01:25:02,798
Don't die, J-5!

1613
01:25:03,566 --> 01:25:07,002
J-5, don't you dare die!

1614
01:25:07,069 --> 01:25:09,638
You better not die!

1615
01:25:12,475 --> 01:25:14,510
J-5!

1616
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:25,188
No!

1617
01:25:26,522 --> 01:25:29,425
Minelli, you're going down.

1618
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:32,995
I'm Kimberly Jonz.

1619
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:34,597
I'm here live,
at the News Center.

1620
01:25:34,663 --> 01:25:36,699
And what happened
here tonight is very simple.

1621
01:25:36,765 --> 01:25:39,134
Blankman and...and
some other guy in a mask,

1622
01:25:39,202 --> 01:25:40,636
they were abducted

1623
01:25:40,703 --> 01:25:43,906
along with myself,
by Michael Minelli and his band of stooges.

1624
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:47,476
Luckily, when they fled,
Blankman outsmarted them.

1625
01:25:47,543 --> 01:25:49,945
He got away?
I don't believe it.

1626
01:25:50,012 --> 01:25:53,282
Well, you'd better believe it,
you diabolical villain.

1627
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:55,251
Blankman,
how'd you find me?

1628
01:25:55,318 --> 01:25:57,986
You're gonna have plenty of time
to figure that out, Minelli,

1629
01:25:58,053 --> 01:25:59,355
in the joint!

1630
01:25:59,422 --> 01:26:02,958
The joint? Oh, yeah?
Sammy, shoot 'em.

1631
01:26:03,025 --> 01:26:06,094
Come on, Sammy.
You bad. Shoot me!

1632
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,597
No, Kevin, there's something
I didn't tell you.

1633
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:12,201
What? I got to paint
a target on my ass?

1634
01:26:12,268 --> 01:26:13,402
Well, come on.

1635
01:26:15,804 --> 01:26:17,340
Oh, my God, he shot me.

1636
01:26:17,406 --> 01:26:19,041
That's what I was
trying to tell you!

1637
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:21,310
Only my costume
is bulletproof!

1638
01:26:24,547 --> 01:26:27,483
Okay, Minelli,
the jig is up.

1639
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:29,685
It's time for you
to pay the piper.

1640
01:26:30,353 --> 01:26:33,322
Get ready to rumble!

1641
01:26:41,397 --> 01:26:43,699
Oh! My painting!
Sammy, get him.

1642
01:26:51,106 --> 01:26:52,341
Get up.

1643
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,010
Yo, Blankman!

1644
01:26:56,445 --> 01:27:00,316
You brought the nunchakus.
Thanks, Other Guy.

1645
01:27:26,108 --> 01:27:28,411
I've had all I can
take from you, Blankman.

1646
01:27:30,045 --> 01:27:31,347
Hi.

1647
01:27:33,215 --> 01:27:34,750
Did I do that?

1648
01:27:34,817 --> 01:27:37,185
Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna tear you apart with my bare hands.

1649
01:27:40,556 --> 01:27:42,725
Get up. Get up, damn it.
That's it.

1650
01:28:00,242 --> 01:28:01,744
Kevin!

1651
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:03,446
Oh, Blankman,

1652
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:05,981
it seems every time we get together,
somebody dies.

1653
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:10,453
Say good-bye to Other Guy!

1654
01:28:10,519 --> 01:28:11,787
Oh, yeah?

1655
01:28:28,604 --> 01:28:30,038
Let me go!

1656
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:33,776
All right, all right,
I give up. I give up!

1657
01:28:33,842 --> 01:28:37,613
Yeah? You should have thought about
that when you killed my grandmother.

1658
01:28:55,197 --> 01:28:56,565
That's right, Minelli.

1659
01:28:56,632 --> 01:29:00,102
We got a nice cold jail cell
all warmed up for you.

1660
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,004
You're not going anywhere.

1661
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,106
I'll see you
in 20 years, Minelli.

1662
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,241
I've been shot,
but I'm all right

1663
01:29:06,308 --> 01:29:08,276
'cause the bullet
went through my...my...

1664
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,812
We did it, Other Guy.

1665
01:29:09,878 --> 01:29:12,881
Blankman, damn!

1666
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:15,918
Earlier in the day,

1667
01:29:15,984 --> 01:29:18,921
thousands showed up at the City
Center for a ticker tape parade

1668
01:29:18,987 --> 01:29:22,124
to honor its newest hero
and his unnamed friend.

1669
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,828
Later, the Mayor addressed the hearty
crowd on the steps of City Hall,

1670
01:29:25,894 --> 01:29:28,431
giving Blankman
a special award.

1671
01:29:28,497 --> 01:29:30,966
I present you, Blankman,

1672
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:34,870
the Harris award for
outstanding community service.

1673
01:29:36,004 --> 01:29:37,406
Thank you. Thank you.

1674
01:29:42,445 --> 01:29:45,481
And you, Other Guy,

1675
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:48,584
this really cool
Blankman t-shirt.

1676
01:29:48,651 --> 01:29:50,519
Let's hear it
for these fine people!

1677
01:29:50,586 --> 01:29:52,721
That was the scene
just a few hours ago

1678
01:29:52,788 --> 01:29:54,823
here at the
Administration Building,

1679
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:58,927
when a grateful city said thank you
to a man who has renewed its spirits.

1680
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:00,429
The crowds may have gone,

1681
01:30:00,496 --> 01:30:03,298
but the memory of this
moment will last a lifetime.

1682
01:30:03,365 --> 01:30:08,236
Live from City Hall,
I'm Kimberly Jonz saying good night.

1683
01:30:08,303 --> 01:30:10,739
I don't know, Kevin.
This is not such a great idea.

1684
01:30:10,806 --> 01:30:12,475
What if she
doesn't like me?

1685
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:14,510
What if she just laughs
right in my face?

1686
01:30:14,577 --> 01:30:18,213
What are you talking about? She is madly
in love with you. Why? I don't know.

1687
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,915
No, she's in love
with Blankman.

1688
01:30:19,982 --> 01:30:21,684
Just tell her
you're Blankman, Darryl.

1689
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,886
Oh, yeah, and really
break her heart.

1690
01:30:23,952 --> 01:30:25,488
Look,

1691
01:30:25,554 --> 01:30:27,790
we promised that we're supposed
to meet her after the parade.

1692
01:30:27,856 --> 01:30:30,092
Now, don't embarrass me.
Go on.

1693
01:30:33,596 --> 01:30:34,963
Kimberly.
Kevin.

1694
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:36,532
This is my brother, Darryl.

1695
01:30:36,599 --> 01:30:37,666
Darryl.
Hi.

1696
01:30:37,733 --> 01:30:40,235
It's nice to finally
get to meet you.

1697
01:30:40,302 --> 01:30:44,072
You know, I can't get over this
feeling that I've met you before.

1698
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:45,874
So,

1699
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:47,876
I guess they had
a big parade today

1700
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,913
for that, uh, super guy,
what's-his-name.

1701
01:30:50,979 --> 01:30:54,282
His name is Blankman.
He saved my life.

1702
01:30:54,349 --> 01:30:57,853
He's probably a big loser
without that flashy costume.

1703
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,255
Oh, he's definitely
not a loser.

1704
01:31:01,356 --> 01:31:02,658
Hey, a purse snatcher!

1705
01:31:02,725 --> 01:31:03,692
Where?

1706
01:31:03,759 --> 01:31:05,794
That's a job for Blankman!

1707
01:31:07,596 --> 01:31:08,631
You know?

1708
01:31:12,034 --> 01:31:15,270
Well, actually, there's
only one way to be sure.

1709
01:31:23,612 --> 01:31:24,713
Wait.

1710
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:26,849
Hold up.

1711
01:31:33,789 --> 01:31:36,759
What did you do to him?
Darryl, speak to me!

1712
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:38,994
Don't touch me. Don't
touch me. Don't touch me.

1713
01:31:39,061 --> 01:31:40,462
* Super hero

1714
01:31:42,898 --> 01:31:44,600
Darryl, get up.

1715
01:31:45,801 --> 01:31:47,603
You want a cigarette?

1716
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:56,945
* Yeah

1717
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:59,147
* I will be your super hero

1718
01:32:00,716 --> 01:32:03,351
* But you must understand

1719
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:07,255
* If I'm to be
your super hero

1720
01:32:07,322 --> 01:32:09,291
* Yeah

1721
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:11,594
* You must give me
half a chance

1722
01:32:13,762 --> 01:32:16,899
* Listen to my band

1723
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:29,077
* Let me tell you
what I mean

1724
01:32:29,144 --> 01:32:31,914
* Make sure you can
love me right

1725
01:32:32,815 --> 01:32:34,116
* Yeah

1726
01:32:35,017 --> 01:32:37,686
* See ya

1727
01:32:37,753 --> 01:32:41,957
* Make sure
this is a real Jamaican love

1728
01:32:42,024 --> 01:32:43,926
* For real,
watch it

1729
01:32:43,992 --> 01:32:45,961
* Since I met you

1730
01:32:46,028 --> 01:32:49,632
* I've begun
to feel so strange

1731
01:32:49,698 --> 01:32:51,033
* For real?

1732
01:32:51,099 --> 01:32:55,370
* Every time
I speak your name

1733
01:32:55,437 --> 01:32:57,172
* Patra

1734
01:32:57,239 --> 01:33:02,177
* You say that you are
so helpless, too

1735
01:33:02,244 --> 01:33:06,148
* That you don't know
what to do

1736
01:33:06,214 --> 01:33:08,450
* Sure about that?

1737
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:11,754
* Could it be
I'm falling in love?

1738
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:14,022
* Could it be
I'm fallin', baby?

1739
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:16,058
* Touch me body right

1740
01:33:16,124 --> 01:33:18,827
* Rock me body long
Right through the night

1741
01:33:18,894 --> 01:33:21,596
* Touching me breasts
Kiss me at the best

1742
01:33:21,664 --> 01:33:24,299
* Anywhere we go
The east and the west

1743
01:33:24,366 --> 01:33:27,169
* Why not try stronger
Rock me body longer

1744
01:33:27,235 --> 01:33:29,872
* To the extreme,
Tell you what I mean

1745
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:31,740
* Get me feel

1746
01:33:34,509 --> 01:33:36,078
* So what?

1747
01:33:36,144 --> 01:33:38,747
* Anyone can be a hero

1748
01:33:38,814 --> 01:33:41,383
* Hey, hey, hey
