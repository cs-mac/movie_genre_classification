1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,736
Sir, I have a missile fire order
from the Antarctic Network.

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:04,921
Why the Antarctic Network?

3
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:08,188
I'm not going to annihilate
4.3 million Pakistanis

4
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:11,275
without hearing from someone
whose authority I recognize.

5
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:12,882
I got a fix on
the boat who shot us, sir.

6
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:13,772
It's the "Illinois."

7
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:15,252
Our own people
tried to sink us?

8
00:00:15,374 --> 00:00:17,315
The "Colorado"
has its own magnetic signature,

9
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:19,477
which turns a $4-billion sub

10
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:21,121
into a sitting duck.

11
00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:23,385
Except now with the prototype
I've put on board--

12
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:24,729
no signature.

13
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:27,080
We have commandeered
the NATO early warning station

14
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:28,539
on the island of Sainte Marina.

15
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:30,756
I am declaring
a 200-mile no-man's-land

16
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:31,887
around this island.

17
00:00:32,017 --> 00:00:33,317
Sam? Sam, is that you?

18
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:34,288
It's me. I'm okay.

19
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:35,784
Listen to me, I don't know
what you've heard,

20
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:36,884
but I can explain it all.

21
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,182
Just please believe in me.

22
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:39,297
On your knees!

23
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:40,621
I'm not gonna let you do this.

24
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:45,207
What the hell did you just do?

25
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:47,078
If the current
United States executive

26
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:48,563
violates this perimeter,

27
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:51,491
we will all burn together.

28
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:53,339
You've been warned.

29
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:02,939
<i> Hey, dad. So this will be</i>
<i>the last of these for a while.

30
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:04,475
<i>We're headed out tomorrow.

31
00:01:04,603 --> 00:01:05,686
<i>I'm excited.

32
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:08,867
We're ready.

33
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:13,772
Captain's on the conn.

34
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:14,510
Status?

35
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:16,910
Heading 0-7-0 to a depth
of 200 feet, sir.

36
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:17,980
Very well. Sonar?

37
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:18,904
The "Princeton"
and the "Monterey"

38
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,238
have reached the perimeter.

39
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:22,462
I'm tracking 16 other
signatures, all closing on us.

40
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:25,653
Well, people, we are now
the popular girl at the dance.

41
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:26,944
Lieutenant Shepard,
what do you see?

42
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,584
We're reading
some 20 other warships

43
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:30,230
closing in
on the 200-mile line,

44
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:32,353
most should arrive
within the next 48 hours.

45
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:33,800
We're preparing to test
the prototype.

46
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:35,104
Keep those eyes on us.

47
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,213
Sophie, should we
be helping these people?

48
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,388
You have to decide that
for yourself.

49
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:40,816
I won't be a part of it.

50
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:44,290
Engineering, conn.

51
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:46,455
Stand ready to engage
the Perseus prototype.

52
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,581
Aye-aye, sir.

53
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:50,680
The prototype is tied in to
every major system on the sub.

54
00:01:50,783 --> 00:01:52,212
It goes down, we're done.

55
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:54,642
And with respect, sir,

56
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:56,659
we should be on the phone with
DC sorting through this mess

57
00:01:56,775 --> 00:01:58,503
before it can't be sorted out.

58
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,330
Attention, all hands.
This is your Captain.

59
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,485
There are some 20-plus warships
descending on us.

60
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:09,282
These are our brothers in arms,
sent now to kill us.

61
00:02:09,388 --> 00:02:10,494
There will be a time to talk,

62
00:02:10,593 --> 00:02:12,587
but right now we show strength.

63
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,316
Captain, out.

64
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:16,604
Engineering, conn.
Engage the Perseus.

65
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:18,411
Aye, sir.

66
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:31,834
SSTD is still online, sir.

67
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:36,566
You just vanished
off our screen, sir.

68
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:38,565
Looks like the prototype works.

69
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:41,877
They're hunting for us.

70
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,161
Sir, something patrolling low
right outside the perimeter.

71
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:45,352
ID off those screws,

72
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:46,475
it's the "Illinois."

73
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:47,972
She's dipping back and forth
across the line.

74
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,165
She's testing the fence.

75
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:50,520
We don't make that line
real to them,

76
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:52,458
sooner or later,
she'll cross over to kill us.

77
00:02:52,597 --> 00:02:54,164
Man battle stations.

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,485
134 on board the "Illinois,"
sir.

79
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:03,680
Helm, put us on intercept
with the "Illinois."

80
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:11,140
Captain,
they've just disappeared.

81
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:13,559
Looks like Marcus
has a new toy.

82
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,761
Listen carefully.

83
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:31,630
Launch transients dead astern!

84
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:33,676
Evasive maneuver--
right full rudder.

85
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:34,932
Launch countermeasures now!

86
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:36,664
Too late. Torpedo is homing.

87
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:39,158
Impact in five, four...

88
00:03:39,347 --> 00:03:40,855
Three, two...

89
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:46,999
Disabled warhead's a hit, sir.

90
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:48,065
"Illinois" turning away.

91
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,436
She's rolling over,

92
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:50,812
showing us her belly.

93
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,676
But she'll still bite
if she gets the chance.

94
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:54,740
Weapons, conn.

95
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:56,716
The next torpedo's armed.
Keep your lock.

96
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:57,971
Nav...

97
00:03:58,075 --> 00:03:58,932
Take us back.

98
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:00,166
Yes, sir.

99
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:06,543
Do you see?

100
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:08,824
The devastation could have been
so much--

101
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,588
"Could have"?

102
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,981
That's gotta be maybe 200 miles
off the coast.

103
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:15,241
That's further than Vegas was
to the Nevada test range.

104
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:18,138
And they set off
a couple hundred nukes there.

105
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,159
Your husband

106
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:21,507
and all the men and women
following Marcus Chaplin

107
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,259
will die

108
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:25,096
if we can't end this now.

109
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:27,333
Now Sam is out there alone.

110
00:04:27,454 --> 00:04:28,315
He's confused.

111
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:30,137
He probably wants,
more than anything,

112
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:31,789
just to do the right thing.

113
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:35,235
Then help him.

114
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:37,503
Sitrep, Lieutenant.

115
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:38,715
We've
manned stations and patrols,

116
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,180
but about a quarter of the crew
aren't reporting for shifts.

117
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:42,546
Cortez and Brannan
are still missing

118
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:43,630
and assumed AWOL.

119
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:45,705
Cortez is third tour.
She's not AWOL.

120
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:47,198
We gotta start looking for 'em.

121
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:48,716
And, sir, the COB--

122
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,645
he's under guard in what
the town uses as a jail,

123
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,937
and he is not making things
any easier.

124
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:03,517
Sailor, open the gate.

125
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:06,476
Tell her we ain't home, Red.

126
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,142
Sailor, I just gave you
a direct order.

127
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,980
Sorry, ma'am.
I don't have the key.

128
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:14,244
You know, Grace,

129
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:16,572
when they find you guilty
of mutiny, of murder,

130
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,708
it's not gonna be the jail cell
that gets to you.

131
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:21,916
It's gonna be the sound
of the people outside

132
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:23,477
chanting for your death.

133
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,408
That's what's gonna
drive you insane...

134
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:26,355
Break it down.

135
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:27,708
And knowing
that your admiral daddy

136
00:05:27,814 --> 00:05:29,261
is not gonna be able
to visit your grave.

137
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,741
I said, break it down. Now.

138
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:32,176
Lieutenant.

139
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:35,133
Open it up.

140
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:44,100
She should've never been wearing
those stripes to begin with.

141
00:05:44,202 --> 00:05:46,584
But you put her there,
and she killed one of my men.

142
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,938
You have everything
you need, COB?

143
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:52,473
I never would've believed that
my friend and commanding officer

144
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:55,534
would go soft when it
came time to do his duty.

145
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:56,732
Oh, I know my duty.

146
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:58,070
Do you?

147
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:01,781
Your duty, sir, is to fire
when you're told to fire.

148
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:03,654
Your duty, sir, is to be
the strong

149
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,782
and unwavering fist
of our nation.

150
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,858
Why'd they send the orders
through the Antarctic channel?

151
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,395
Why would they fire on us?

152
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:11,526
I'm a sailor.

153
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:13,785
I don't have the luxury to ask.

154
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:14,825
No, you don't,

155
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:16,935
which is why you're the COB,
and I'm the Captain.

156
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:19,448
You're my friend, Marcus.

157
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,785
But you're no longer
the captain of my boat.

158
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:24,878
That uniform
you're still wearing?

159
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:26,662
That's borrowed glory.

160
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:31,353
I've always appreciated
your candor, COB.

161
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:38,957
Lock it up, sailor.

162
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:44,197
You all right, Lieutenant?

163
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:46,466
Not really.

164
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:48,904
XO, you're gonna
have to relieve me.

165
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:52,451
I'm sorry, but I'm not setting
an example for the enlisted.

166
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,675
And it's not their fault.
It's me.

167
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:56,288
I don't know who I am here.

168
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:57,946
Well, then figure it out.

169
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:00,959
Look, we lose control here,
we're all dead.

170
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:02,263
You get that?

171
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:04,598
I can't fix this for you,
but I do need you.

172
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,074
They don't believe in you?

173
00:07:06,346 --> 00:07:07,860
You make them, today.

174
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:16,245
That's closer
than 200 miles.

175
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,422
Aircraft crossed the perimeter
15 seconds ago.

176
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,935
Whatever it is, it's big.
Working the ident.

177
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:25,233
Open hatches. Make sure
the world can see it.

178
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:30,107
"Eisenhower" is scrambling F-18s
to intercept, sir.

179
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:31,825
They're asking if they can cross
our line to turn her around.

180
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,118
ID the bird, now.

181
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:34,333
Wait.

182
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:39,370
Pilot of Taiwan air 29-76,
turn around. Do you hear me?

183
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:40,633
It's a passenger 747.

184
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,771
How close do you think it got?

185
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:49,342
I don't know.
Maybe 40 miles.

186
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,924
A Delta Force Team could
HALO down from that plane,

187
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:53,013
hit the water on the far side,

188
00:07:53,113 --> 00:07:54,148
paddle in.

189
00:07:54,544 --> 00:07:56,010
They could be here
six hours after that.

190
00:07:56,113 --> 00:07:57,608
They didn't waste any time.

191
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,322
I'll go.

192
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:01,214
I'll take a team,
try and cut 'em off.

193
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:02,856
- Sam, if those are Deltas--
- I know.

194
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:05,130
If they don't think we made 'em,
maybe we get the upper hand.

195
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,419
You stay here.
You do what you can.

196
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:08,672
I'll go.

197
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:09,970
Show strength.

198
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:11,949
Then talk.

199
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:18,672
If you're right,

200
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:20,316
you'll need a second out there
you can trust.

201
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,983
Volunteering
for the mission, sir.

202
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,001
Hangover cure.

203
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:32,982
Drink it.
There's another at the bar.

204
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:34,751
I thought
you special forces hot shots

205
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:36,627
could handle your liquor.

206
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:37,894
Do you have a boat,

207
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:39,713
some way off the island?

208
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:40,964
There are boats, but--

209
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,551
Get yourself off this rock.

210
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:44,152
This whole place just became

211
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:45,686
the biggest bull's-eye
on the planet.

212
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm sorry.
It's just...

213
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:50,818
This whole island is a volcano.

214
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:52,403
The stories we heard as kids,

215
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:55,519
they were about lands plucked
from the bottom of the ocean

216
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:56,898
by a giant fish hook

217
00:08:56,991 --> 00:08:59,680
or tossed down from the sky
by angry gods.

218
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:01,952
Telling an islander
they're going to die violently

219
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,562
is just reminding us
we're home.

220
00:09:07,415 --> 00:09:08,947
Shower's $10.

221
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,083
Didn't ask.

222
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:14,328
You will.

223
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,061
Gentlemen.

224
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:31,446
You saw that plane?

225
00:09:31,546 --> 00:09:32,638
Yeah.

226
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:34,028
I'd say you got yourself
a bad case

227
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:36,359
of between seven and ten
special forces.

228
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:37,649
Almost certainly Delta.

229
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:38,545
So you think they'll move
for us

230
00:09:38,638 --> 00:09:40,022
or for the sub first?

231
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:42,151
My captain seems to think
you might be of some help

232
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,609
coming up with a plan here.

233
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:45,009
A plan?

234
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,113
Yeah, a plan.

235
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:47,623
You're not coming up
with a plan.

236
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:50,602
What you're working on is just
a really complicated suicide.

237
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:52,183
Okay, let me get
one thing straight.

238
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,128
I'm only here because
my captain asked me to be.

239
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,996
'Cause me? I'd rather
beat my own brains out

240
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:57,761
than have you help me
with anything.

241
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:59,010
So do me a favor.
Why don't you stay here

242
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:01,336
and drink yourself more stupid,
if that's humanly possible?

243
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:02,541
Thanks for your help.

244
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:08,001
Oh, Whoo! That is good.

245
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,611
13 of our sailors are about

246
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:16,558
to face off with something
they don't understand--

247
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:18,063
Do you want to know what's
the really great thing

248
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,697
about a perfect HALO jump?

249
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:21,827
It's that, before the jump,

250
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:23,449
you're still stateside
in your head--

251
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,198
rent, ex-girlfriends,
car payment, whatever.

252
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,093
That free fall--
it cleans you right out.

253
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:30,456
By the time you rip your chute,

254
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:31,931
everything's gone.

255
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:35,438
And what's left
is a single-minded focus

256
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:36,863
to accomplish the mission,

257
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:39,638
which in this case would be
killing you and your pals.

258
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:42,820
Look, the least you could
do is tell--

259
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:44,835
If I had to choose sides,
I'd be out there with them.

260
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,901
So this?

261
00:10:46,002 --> 00:10:47,658
This is the very least
I can do.

262
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:54,096
Hi.

263
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,282
Hi.

264
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:56,466
So we think there
might be some soldiers

265
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:57,767
coming over the island.

266
00:10:58,245 --> 00:10:59,937
Since you know this place
better than anyone,

267
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,488
I was hoping to get your help.

268
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:05,849
You know,
I don't really think you get

269
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:07,057
what's going on here, do you?

270
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,228
Oh, I do.

271
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:11,587
I understand that millions
of people died yesterday.

272
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:13,293
But do you understand?

273
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:14,901
No, you can't.

274
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,259
Because you're a soldier.

275
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,482
You're made to believe
such things are normal.

276
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:20,383
Have you even looked at the TV?

277
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:21,701
Have you seen the faces--

278
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:24,149
Hey, we're the ones that
didn't fire. Do you get that?

279
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:25,440
Do you get it?

280
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:28,042
Me and my captain, we didn't
fire nukes at Pakistan.

281
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:30,464
You know what the prize is
for being such stand-up guys?

282
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:33,936
Men come to kill us and kill
anyone that gets in their way.

283
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,925
And right now
our only advantage is surprise.

284
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:38,832
And I'm here
asking for your help.

285
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:40,834
XO, a call's come in for you.

286
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:43,212
I thought the phones were dead.

287
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,935
So did we.
You should take this.

288
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:57,201
Hello.

289
00:11:57,387 --> 00:11:58,715
Hey, babe.

290
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:02,127
I've been trying to
reach you again. Are you okay?

291
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:03,484
I know. I know.

292
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,295
Things have been
pretty crazy here.

293
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:09,142
And I bet for you, too,
right? 

294
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:11,350
Christine, talk to me.

295
00:12:11,457 --> 00:12:12,881
Are you okay?

296
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:16,056
Sam, they'll give you
full amnesty...

297
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:17,787
You and the crew.

298
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:18,978
All you have to do

299
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,531
is give them the sub.

300
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:25,895
And you have to
give them Marcus.

301
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,592
They're ready to let you
come back to me.

302
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:42,563
Sam...

303
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:46,521
Don't trust them.

304
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:47,564
Whatever they say to you,

305
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:49,150
whatever I say to you,
don't trust it!

306
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:51,457
Just know that I love you, Sam!
I love you!

307
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:04,094
We knew this wouldn't
just be bullets.

308
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,012
They'll come at you
where it hurts the most.

309
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:11,852
You okay?

310
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:17,249
We'll get inland and we'll
set up a kill zone.

311
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:21,198
Maybe they walk right into it.

312
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:26,418
Worst-case scenario,
they get wise, they kill us all.

313
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:28,937
Best-case scenario,

314
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:31,663
we send a complement
of American body bags home.

315
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:37,049
Either way, this sucks.

316
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,064
The siege of Grozny in '94.

317
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:56,306
2,000 Russians died
fighting their own.

318
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:58,961
In the aftermath,
generals resigned,

319
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,360
others were tried.

320
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:03,151
But for days, they fought,

321
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,123
brother killing brother

322
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:07,075
by the thousands
in the freezing cold.

323
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:09,399
And you have to
ask yourself why.

324
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,763
Sometimes the enemy

325
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:16,285
is just the man
keeping you from getting home.

326
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:25,392
<i> A symbol of the Cold War,

327
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:28,175
<i>the Ohio class submarine</i>
<i>is one of 18 in its class

328
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:30,191
<i>designed to run silent and deep

329
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:30,997
<i>and then deliver deathly...

330
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,380
20 bucks says we take this guy
out within 24 hours.

331
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,944
Cruise missile. Who's in?

332
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,129
Hey, brain surgeon.

333
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:37,647
The "Colorado" can launch

334
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,152
its remaining 17 nukes
in under five minutes.

335
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,935
Your cruise missile
is a slow weapon.

336
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:43,076
Takes maybe 20 minutes.

337
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:45,377
ICBM's faster, but you gotta
launch it up and down.

338
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:46,234
That takes time.

339
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:48,210
And you better be 100% sure
you kill her,

340
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:49,637
'cause Chaplin's got eyes now.

341
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:51,652
And once the "Colorado's"
tridents are airborne,

342
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:53,404
there is not a thing
in this world that stops them

343
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:55,510
'cause somebody kept my daddy
from building star wars

344
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:56,344
20 years ago.

345
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,418
So tell me exactly how you would
take out that submarine?

346
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:03,906
Linus.

347
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:05,893
What is my favorite
deep cover mole

348
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:07,550
in the Defense Department
drinking this evening?

349
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:08,898
- For God sake, Kylie.
- Oh, relax.

350
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,415
I could give you a lap dance
right here

351
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:11,949
and no one would notice today.

352
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:13,190
I would.

353
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:14,713
So what's your news?

354
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:17,777
Your Perseus prototype?

355
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,400
Chaplin went ahead and tested it
this morning, on his own.

356
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,830
The "Colorado" dropped
right off everyone's screens.

357
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:25,805
Kylie, it works.

358
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,570
Waiter, champagne. Right away.
We're celebrating.

359
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:29,933
No, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

360
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:31,033
They will
take it away from you.

361
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:32,771
They will go patriot act,
they will go National Security,

362
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:34,050
and they will
take it away from you.

363
00:15:34,144 --> 00:15:36,032
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

364
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:40,247
Chaplin said it was
actually the "Illinois"

365
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,750
that tried to sink
the "Colorado."

366
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:42,843
Chaplin's insane.

367
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:44,741
Really? 24 hours ago,
you would've said

368
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:47,489
he was the paragon of virtue
and patriotism.

369
00:15:47,653 --> 00:15:49,807
Now someone ordered
the "Illinois" to fire.

370
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:51,740
Somewhere that was recorded,
and if you're right

371
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:52,912
and they're trying
to take my tech,

372
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:55,351
than that order is
my get-out-of-jail-free card.

373
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:56,825
I need you to get that for me.

374
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:57,786
Are you not hearing me?

375
00:15:57,889 --> 00:15:59,235
I can't help you anymore.

376
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:04,198
What was the name of that
brunette at your bachelor party?

377
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,025
God, she was hot.

378
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,480
Like,
make-me-want-to-switch-hit hot,

379
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:08,190
wasn't she?

380
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:09,675
Was it Carole?

381
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,350
Oh, no. No, no.
That's your wife's name.

382
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,050
I thought we were friends.

383
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:15,508
We are friends.

384
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:18,605
But you're a friend I pay
a lot of money to.

385
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:21,792
Linus, go find me that order.

386
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,136
Good-bye, dad.

387
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:34,368
I bet this isn't how you saw
your weekend going.

388
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,051
My weekends are not as boring
as you imagine.

389
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:40,431
Yeah. Well, it isn't
how I saw mine.

390
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:43,556
I was there.

391
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:47,898
If you hadn't killed that man,
we'd all be dead.

392
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:50,308
You didn't have a choice.

393
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,651
It doesn't matter now, does it?

394
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:04,086
Shepard killed one of us.

395
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,217
Sometimes in battle,

396
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:08,261
these things have a way
of working themselves out.

397
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:19,409
Sorry, Cam,
you're too important up there.

398
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:20,841
With all due respect, sir.

399
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,939
If this doesn't work,
there will be no "up there."

400
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,652
Full complement
ready to go, sir.

401
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:28,790
Good.

402
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,684
Careful out there.
Don't get a sunburn.

403
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:40,563
You don't need this
or this or this.

404
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:41,987
Hey.

405
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,849
This will get you shot

406
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,445
while you're busy
trying to unstrap it.

407
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:50,703
You got
your rig strapped right.

408
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,946
Doesn't mean you're ready
for what's out there.

409
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:06,575
There is a place they will
have to go through to get here.

410
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:08,554
I'll show you where.

411
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,306
That's all.

412
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,247
Aiding and abetting
a terrorist enterprise,

413
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:16,129
aiding and abetting
known terrorists,

414
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,384
sedition, treason,

415
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:19,688
aiding and abetting
an attack on the homeland--

416
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:21,100
and this isn't
just your husband.

417
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:23,456
After that stunt,
this is now you as well.

418
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,881
Read between the lines.

419
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:28,313
You think you know him?

420
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,696
You don't.

421
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:31,853
You just know the easy parts,

422
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,245
the parts he wanted you to see.

423
00:18:34,357 --> 00:18:36,033
I know Sam better than anyone.

424
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,365
You sure?

425
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,338
<i>I'm not gonna talk about that.

426
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:40,440
<i>I told you I'm not gonna</i>
<i>talk about it

427
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:41,679
<i>so we're not talking about it.

428
00:18:41,777 --> 00:18:42,631
What is this?

429
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:44,808
<i> There were 18 of you</i>
<i>taken prisoner.

430
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,572
When was this taken?
What is this?

431
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,638
<i>Seven men under your command</i>
<i>didn't survive.

432
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:50,125
What the hell is going on?

433
00:18:50,223 --> 00:18:51,645
<i>That has to weigh on you.

434
00:18:56,507 --> 00:18:57,964
I was surprised you showed.

435
00:18:58,459 --> 00:18:59,859
So am I.

436
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:02,910
These men
you're ready to fight,

437
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:04,963
they might as well
be your brothers.

438
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,310
Hey, you know, I get it.

439
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:09,492
You don't like killing,
you don't like war,

440
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,373
you want us
to all just get along.

441
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:12,769
That's what anybody thinks

442
00:19:12,874 --> 00:19:14,839
that's never had their back
up against a wall.

443
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:16,625
Who do you think I am?

444
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,798
I've seen what your wars do.

445
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:20,535
And there's always
some other way.

446
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:22,164
Yeah,
I used to think that, too.

447
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:23,888
I was wrong.

448
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:26,258
What happened
to change your mind?

449
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:29,540
Thank you for showing us
this spot.

450
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:31,018
You should go now.

451
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:40,469
Ma'am.

452
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:41,913
Can you check my weapon for me?

453
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:43,434
I want to make sure it's ready.

454
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:52,090
Thank you, ma'am.

455
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,882
I feel much safer now.

456
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,643
You just let them go off alone.

457
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:11,329
Ahh.
It's not my business.

458
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:16,624
Here on Sainte Marina,

459
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:19,604
sometimes a family
breaks apart--

460
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:22,042
a marriage goes bad,
a debt goes unpaid,

461
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,810
a small war starts.

462
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:27,187
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
break out the patchouli.

463
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:30,033
But here when this happens,

464
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:32,196
a man is selected and marked

465
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:34,119
to make the peace.

466
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,857
The marks are an honor.

467
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:40,975
Do you deserve them?

468
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:47,420
<i>It would be 3:00 or 4:00</i>
<i>in the morning

469
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,402
<i>when they would come.

470
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:49,740
<i>They'd drag us</i>
<i>out of our cells.

471
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:51,431
<i>They would march us out</i>
<i>into the yard.

472
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:52,582
<i> Together?

473
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:54,589
<i>Mnh-mnh. Alone.

474
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:57,825
<i>There would be a table</i>
<i>and gun. One bullet.

475
00:20:57,954 --> 00:20:59,277
<i>They'd make you load the gun.

476
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:01,849
<i>They'd spin the chamber</i>
<i>and put the gun to your head.

477
00:21:03,604 --> 00:21:04,939
<i>Click.

478
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,418
<i>That sound...

479
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:09,245
Your husband was a captive

480
00:21:09,363 --> 00:21:11,715
of the Democratic People's
Republic of North Korea

481
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:13,305
for over 17 days.

482
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:14,777
No, that's not possible.

483
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,718
Marcus Chaplin
went off the reservation

484
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,139
to force his release.

485
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:19,929
Put his career on the line.

486
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:22,183
Sam just tell you that was
a regular deployment?

487
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,302
Why does a man <i>lie</i> to his wife?

488
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:26,675
I don't know.

489
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:28,068
Well, Marcus had him
lying to you,

490
00:21:28,176 --> 00:21:29,305
to everyone.

491
00:21:29,436 --> 00:21:30,884
And if he's capable of that,

492
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:33,268
what else could Marcus
get him to do?

493
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:36,825
You think that's the only lie
your husband ever told you?

494
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:38,410
I don't know, okay?

495
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:42,326
Why don't you tell me? Because I
don't know what this is.

496
00:21:44,707 --> 00:21:46,763
<i>I lost seven of my men.</i>
<i>You want their names?

497
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:50,431
<i>Look, it happened. I'm over it.</i>
<i>Could we move on, please?

498
00:21:50,966 --> 00:21:52,397
That's your husband...

499
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,091
learning to lie.

500
00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:00,190
Deputy Secretary
of Defense Curry,

501
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:01,580
it's good to talk to you again.

502
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:03,947
It's Secretary now, Captain.

503
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,403
Well, I'm glad the last 24 hours
has been good to someone.

504
00:22:07,513 --> 00:22:09,187
You know, we have a lot
of frightened people here.

505
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:10,977
You have a team of Delta
on my island.

506
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:12,476
I want them gone. Now.

507
00:22:12,587 --> 00:22:15,680
We got about 1.6 billion muslims
deeply pissed at us.

508
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:17,352
We're trying to de-escalate
this situation,

509
00:22:17,442 --> 00:22:18,269
not make it worse.

510
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,621
There are no Delta
on your island. Over.

511
00:22:24,628 --> 00:22:26,093
So who can shoot?

512
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,206
I mean actually hit something.

513
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:30,141
I suppose I can.

514
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:31,441
Okay.

515
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,519
Ah, hell.
Guess I can, too.

516
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:35,798
Good.

517
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:37,581
When this starts,
they're either gonna fall back

518
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:39,960
or try to make it to cover.

519
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:42,027
You do not let them.

520
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:43,348
You got it?

521
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:45,059
Good.

522
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:46,345
XO,
we're all set up here.

523
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:47,459
How long do you think we have?

524
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:49,427
Probably an hour
or more, but be ready.

525
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:53,078
Must feel weird,
killing one of your own,

526
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:56,238
especially like this, without
them knowing it's coming.

527
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:58,191
Hey, Hawkes,

528
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:00,987
we're gonna need
every gun we have.

529
00:23:01,104 --> 00:23:02,151
So if you're gonna shoot me
in the back,

530
00:23:02,238 --> 00:23:03,954
maybe you could wait
until we're done here.

531
00:23:11,796 --> 00:23:13,034
We've got
the whole thing ranged.

532
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:14,372
If they come, we'll take 'em.

533
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,852
Good.

534
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:17,257
XO...

535
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:20,554
You gonna get married
someday, Lieutenant?

536
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:22,268
'Cause these men are coming,

537
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,244
and only one of you
gets to have a future.

538
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:26,659
I plan on being
at that wedding.

539
00:23:27,752 --> 00:23:29,137
I'll make sure
and invite you, sir.

540
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:32,039
Go, quick. Go.

541
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,980
Captain, they're here.

542
00:23:42,062 --> 00:23:43,912
If we're gonna find another way
out of this, it's gotta be now.

543
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:45,368
You're on your own
for now, Sam.

544
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:46,705
I can't help you yet.

545
00:23:56,454 --> 00:23:57,720
Secretary Curry,

546
00:23:57,891 --> 00:24:00,084
tell me again how you have
nothing on my island.

547
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:02,277
Tell me how I'm imaging
my XO is going up against

548
00:24:02,392 --> 00:24:03,790
an armed contingent.

549
00:24:03,863 --> 00:24:05,437
And if I think you're lying
to me, then I'm gonna have to

550
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,779
- leave this in the hands of a
higher power. - Excuse me, sir.

551
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:10,016
Wh-what do you want me
to say, Marcus?

552
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:12,162
Yes, we sent Delta?
No, we didn't send Delta?

553
00:24:12,273 --> 00:24:14,065
Does it really matter
what I say?

554
00:24:14,939 --> 00:24:16,715
Hold your fire.

555
00:24:21,413 --> 00:24:23,046
Hold your fire.

556
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:24,175
Sir?

557
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:25,486
I have the shot.

558
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:26,735
Sir?

559
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,802
I'm coming out to talk!
I am unarmed!

560
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:37,269
I repeat, I am unarmed!
I'm coming out to talk!

561
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:38,636
Do not fire!

562
00:24:38,746 --> 00:24:40,854
Sir...
What are you doing?

563
00:24:49,945 --> 00:24:52,074
We got you ranged
from both sides.

564
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:54,319
You are in a kill zone.

565
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:58,028
I just want to talk.

566
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:02,739
We are all Americans.
At least some of you

567
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,825
gotta be wondering
what you're doing here.

568
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:06,807
Hell. I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

569
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:10,476
There it is again.

570
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:11,842
They're essentially
beaming it through the water

571
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:12,987
from their base to the team

572
00:25:13,073 --> 00:25:14,887
and then using
an ultra-low frequency.

573
00:25:15,002 --> 00:25:16,968
Who is beaming it
through the water?

574
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:18,721
They are.

575
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:24,003
All I know is,
none of us has to die today.

576
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,100
Sam, they're not Deltas.

577
00:25:26,207 --> 00:25:27,440
They're Russian <i>Spetsnaz.

578
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:28,651
Sam, do you read?

579
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:30,875
Ah, hell.

580
00:25:44,655 --> 00:25:46,035
Three went back!
Two forward!

581
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:47,294
We got two but-- 

582
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:54,500
Grace, they flanked us to
the top of the hill you're on.

583
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:55,814
You gotta get up there.

584
00:25:59,077 --> 00:26:00,419
We're already on our way.

585
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,173
But we're pinned down, Sam.

586
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,117
There is no way up.

587
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:05,761
We're not gonna survive
like this, Lieutenant.

588
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:07,464
I need you to take
that position out.

589
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,624
Do you hear me?

590
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,729
Hawkes.

591
00:26:12,877 --> 00:26:14,213
Hawkes, we need cover.

592
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:17,435
No!

593
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,238
Turn that down, sailor.

594
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:28,235
Sir?

595
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,721
You heard me.
Turn it down.

596
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,122
<i>Marcus Chaplin.

597
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:37,032
<i>This is an unexpected honor.

598
00:26:37,152 --> 00:26:39,114
Viktor, you have a team
of <i>Spetsnaz</i> on my island,

599
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,650
dropped off the back
of a Taiwanese 747.

600
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:43,778
You're running support off
a Ukrainian container ship

601
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:45,663
50 miles beyond my perimeter.

602
00:26:45,757 --> 00:26:47,286
And it might not be
your mission, Viktor.

603
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:50,599
But someone in the Kremlin is
making a play for my submarine.

604
00:26:51,141 --> 00:26:52,517
<i>No one would want to attack.

605
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:53,810
I'll sink the ship, Viktor.

606
00:26:53,957 --> 00:26:55,663
And then I'll target
the Sevastopol base

607
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,451
where your two sons
are stationed

608
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,113
and I'll turn it to glass.

609
00:27:09,823 --> 00:27:11,339
Grace,
I need to know right now,

610
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:13,504
can you take care
of that position or not?!

611
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,067
I'm sorry, Sam.

612
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:18,148
I'm sorry.

613
00:27:18,258 --> 00:27:19,886
Russians are signaling,
they want to talk.

614
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:21,380
Get Curry back on the line.

615
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:23,707
Let him hear everything,
but mute that son of a bitch.

616
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:30,648
<i>Marcus,

617
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,012
<i>many people are asleep here.

618
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:34,938
<i>It's not easy.

619
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,362
That's okay, Viktor.

620
00:27:36,968 --> 00:27:38,569
I've got all the time
in the world.

621
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:41,226
Radio's dead.
Everybody listen up.

622
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,781
On my go, you're gonna
get to the truck

623
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:44,303
and get the hell out of here.

624
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:46,353
One of you guys go down,
you just keep moving.

625
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,399
On my go.

626
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,444
Red. Red.

627
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,689
We're gonna do this.
Do you hear me?

628
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,433
It's not more than 25 yards.
Do you understand me?

629
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:55,952
I can't. I can't.

630
00:27:57,074 --> 00:27:58,979
I'm sorry. I can't.

631
00:28:01,936 --> 00:28:03,519
Viktor,
what is that kid's name...

632
00:28:04,507 --> 00:28:05,793
on your boat back in the day?

633
00:28:05,903 --> 00:28:07,673
The one who got so freaked out
under the ice.

634
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:10,515
You and I called off
the Cold War for an hour

635
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,127
so you could get him topside.

636
00:28:13,117 --> 00:28:14,423
That's called trust.

637
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:15,992
<i>Ah, Nikolai.

638
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:17,395

643
00:28:30,548 --> 00:28:32,519
<i>Maybe then nobody</i>

00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,013
Viktor! This is
Secretary of Defense Curry.

645
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,588
You put a play in motion?
This is our conflict.

646
00:28:38,691 --> 00:28:40,509
Unless you want to start
World War III,

647
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:42,173
you pull those men back <i>now.

648
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:43,975
<i>And I thought you were</i>
<i>a man of your word.

649
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:45,595
I didn't give you
my word, Viktor.

650
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:47,257
But I'll let you work out
the ramifications

651
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:50,002
of trying to steal a U.S. sub
with SecDef Curry.

652
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:54,209
I did the math.

653
00:28:54,308 --> 00:28:56,521
We dated two years.
Married one.

654
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,262
Mm-hmm.

655
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:01,750
Yet, we have actually
only spent 124 days together.

656
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:03,846
You did the math?

657
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,393
Who are you, Sam Kendal?

658
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:07,746
We're gonna be okay.

659
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:08,932
What do you want?

660
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:10,323
I just want you.

661
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:11,718
<i> XO.

662
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:12,885
XO!

663
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,560
You don't have to do this.

664
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,532
Go, go, go, go!

665
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:22,945
Don't die. Not today.

666
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,192
Don't die.

667
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:49,653
Yeah!

668
00:30:07,402 --> 00:30:08,811
XO, are you there?

669
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:13,362
XO.

670
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,169
Remaining Russians
have bugged out.

671
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:19,040
We lost five.
Grace is wounded.

672
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,345
But she's gonna be okay.

673
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:22,451
We have two prisoners.
We're coming home.

674
00:30:28,591 --> 00:30:30,174
Probably a waste of time.

675
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:32,438
You really think you can break
that kind of devotion?

676
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,319
Well, she's got faith.
She's in love.

677
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:38,688
But both those things
are curable.

678
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:40,871
Then cure her.

679
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:50,423
Okay, I'm here with her now.

680
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:51,478
All right.

681
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:53,887
Christine...

682
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:55,645
My name is Paul Wells.

683
00:30:56,173 --> 00:30:57,416
We've been trying to find you.

684
00:30:58,084 --> 00:30:59,768
Do you remember me?

685
00:31:05,922 --> 00:31:07,242
You're Sam's friend.

686
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:08,787
Yes. Yes, from college.

687
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:09,963
Look, I'm a lawyer, okay?

688
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:11,295
The government has...

689
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:14,034
radically exceeded
its authority here.

690
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:16,121
But that all stops now.

691
00:31:19,062 --> 00:31:20,346
Come on.

692
00:31:20,596 --> 00:31:22,465
Let me take you home.

693
00:31:52,195 --> 00:31:53,217
All right, lock 'em up.

694
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,575
Oh, hell, no.

695
00:31:54,908 --> 00:31:56,508
They killed five of us, man.

696
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:57,480
Yeah, five.

697
00:31:57,578 --> 00:31:58,745
Five of our friends,
five of our people.

698
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,561
These guys get wasted.

699
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:02,620
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Put your weapon down right now!

700
00:32:02,707 --> 00:32:04,243
Red, that is an order!
Put it down!

701
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:06,102
An order? We're on
a damn island, not a sub.

702
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,153
So excuse me

703
00:32:07,332 --> 00:32:09,514
if I'm not even sure
what an order means anymore!

704
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,791
I know you didn't ask for this.

705
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:17,033
I know you're all scared

706
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:18,709
and you're wondering
what we're doing here

707
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:20,241
and how you're gonna
get back home.

708
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:22,043
And now you've lost friends

709
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:24,099
and you have bloodlust
in your hearts.

710
00:32:24,647 --> 00:32:26,095
Vengeance might give you
some satisfaction,

711
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:29,511
but let me remind you
<i>who you are.

712
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:32,930
You are the American crew

713
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:37,232
of the Ohio class ballistic
missile submarine "Colorado."

714
00:32:37,584 --> 00:32:39,356
Your rank is what
it says on your collar.

715
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:40,869
You salute the sailor
above you...

716
00:32:42,281 --> 00:32:44,310
and you expect the same
of the one below.

717
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:45,979
And your final duty
is to say "how high?"

718
00:32:46,061 --> 00:32:47,340
When I say "jump."

719
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,558
Are we clear?

720
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:51,947
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

721
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:53,142
Are we clear?!

722
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:54,673
Yes, sir.

723
00:32:57,068 --> 00:32:58,409
Now as Americans,

724
00:33:00,265 --> 00:33:02,600
there's no debate about
the fate of our POWs.

725
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:05,607
Lieutenant Shepard,

726
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:07,609
secure the prisoners.

727
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,973
I know what you did.

728
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:32,338
Try it again.
I'll still be here.

729
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:40,813
Marcus!

730
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:44,382
Tell them what you told me
when we were still pals.

731
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:48,605
Tell them that your son
got killed by friendly fire

732
00:33:48,724 --> 00:33:51,195
two weeks ago in Afghanistan.

733
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:55,456
Go on.

734
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:57,186
These young people
have followed you into a hell

735
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:59,853
they'll never be able
to climb back out of.

736
00:34:00,568 --> 00:34:01,750
For what?

737
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:03,408
Because you wanted payback
on the country

738
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:05,625
that took your son
away from you?!

739
00:34:06,684 --> 00:34:08,669
Tell 'em the truth, Marcus!

740
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:11,537
Tell them what they're really
fighting for!

741
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:14,645
You know me, Joe.

742
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:21,354
All of you...

743
00:34:21,813 --> 00:34:23,094
you know me.

744
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,886
One more for me.

745
00:34:54,988 --> 00:34:57,594
One more for the lady
with the, uh, face.

746
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:01,014
You think I came to thank you?

747
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:03,269
We lost people.

748
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:05,576
I thought you might want
to know their names.

749
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:10,986
I got my own list
a lot longer than that.

750
00:35:14,434 --> 00:35:15,929
One of these days,
you're gonna have to decide

751
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:17,616
what you believe in.

752
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:21,781
Ahh.

753
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:24,030
What did it feel like?

754
00:35:25,712 --> 00:35:27,662
It's a hell of a buzz,
isn't it?

755
00:35:30,497 --> 00:35:33,613
You may not know it,
but you did something today.

756
00:35:34,028 --> 00:35:35,105
Peace...

757
00:35:35,209 --> 00:35:36,850
maker.

758
00:35:36,956 --> 00:35:38,950
You think I made
the peace, Tani?

759
00:35:40,465 --> 00:35:42,431
I just ran out of people
to kill.

760
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:44,143
<i> The so-called</i>
<i>"Pledge of Allegiance"

761
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:45,313
<i>swept through congress today

762
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:48,205
<i>as legislators lined up</i>
<i>in support of the President,

763
00:35:48,341 --> 00:35:50,050
<i>even as international</i>
<i>condemnation mounts

764
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:50,866
<i>for the attack

765
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:53,591
<i>the White House has called</i>
<i>"necessary and unavoidable."

766
00:35:56,065 --> 00:35:57,307
Oh, finally.

767
00:35:58,049 --> 00:35:59,579
I did my part. How about...

768
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:10,848
They said it was an allergic
reaction to something he ate.

769
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,076
But by the time
they got to him,

770
00:36:12,163 --> 00:36:15,243
his brain had been without
oxygen for ten minutes.

771
00:36:15,493 --> 00:36:17,158
So how could that
be an accident?

772
00:36:18,585 --> 00:36:20,323
It's your fault, isn't it?

773
00:36:22,795 --> 00:36:25,712
You smiled and promised him
so much money.

774
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:27,856
You know, he used to say,
"You should see her.

775
00:36:28,282 --> 00:36:30,139
It's like nothing
can touch her."

776
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,270
It's true, isn't it?
Nothing touches you.

777
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:38,291
I hope you die alone.

778
00:36:58,095 --> 00:37:00,735
We've got two teams looking
for Brannan and Cortez.

779
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:04,666
If they're out there
to be found, we'll find them.

780
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,397
I think it was July deployment.

781
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:17,500
You're due any minute
for general inspection,

782
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:19,090
and, man... 

783
00:37:19,888 --> 00:37:21,272
It's not good.

784
00:37:21,434 --> 00:37:23,868
Cam's got some new sonar display
that's not even working.

785
00:37:23,964 --> 00:37:25,563
The cook, he's got,
like, 200 cans of stew

786
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:26,874
that exploded in the mess

787
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:28,011
and the smell...

788
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:31,101
The smell is everywhere.

789
00:37:31,938 --> 00:37:33,813
And here comes the captain.
Here you come.

790
00:37:34,282 --> 00:37:34,993
Everybody's freaking out

791
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:36,615
because the place
is a complete disaster.

792
00:37:36,697 --> 00:37:37,829
Except instead, for two hours,

793
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:40,841
you're all smiles
and back slaps.

794
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:44,576
You told some story
about fishing off the back

795
00:37:44,683 --> 00:37:46,524
of an LA class attack sub.

796
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,773
Finally,
it's time to put to sea.

797
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:54,683
I find Christine
and I say good-bye.

798
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:57,287
Yeah, you'd been married...

799
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,347
three weeks?

800
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,640
I join you on the bridge,

801
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,688
and you got this big dumb smile
plastered all over your face--

802
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,724
totally undignified.

803
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:17,991
And Jeffrey's there
on the pier.

804
00:38:19,821 --> 00:38:21,954
He's home from his first tour.

805
00:38:22,512 --> 00:38:24,923
He's there to watch his old man
pull out to sea.

806
00:38:39,148 --> 00:38:41,167
Give me your dumb hand, sir.

807
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:45,690
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

808
00:38:49,673 --> 00:38:51,878
But I am your friend.

809
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,179
And I know who you are.

810
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,367
And I trust you.

811
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,842
They find
what hurts you the most

812
00:39:05,947 --> 00:39:08,001
and they try to break you
with it.

813
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:10,343
But that's where they miss.

814
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:13,565
What hurts us the most,
that's our strength.

815
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:15,888
That's what gets us through.

816
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:57,970
<i> I'm excited.

817
00:39:58,082 --> 00:40:00,253
<i>And I know you of all people,</i>
<i>you get that.

818
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,386
<i>I'll tell you stories</i>
<i>on the other side.

819
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:04,625
<i>I love you, dad.

820
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:07,439
<i> Hi, dad.

821
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:09,425
<i>I hope you never</i>
<i>have to watch this.

822
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:11,507
<i>I wish that I had</i>
<i>let you know me better.

823
00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:14,254
<i>If I had, then you would know</i>
<i>how scared I am.

824
00:40:17,258 --> 00:40:19,862
<i>But you would also know that</i>
<i>I'm not gonna run from this.

825
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:24,590
<i>That's not who I am.

826
00:40:29,366 --> 00:40:31,001
<i>I love you, dad.

827
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,319
<i> You've indicated that

828
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,012
<i>you're not going to tell</i>
<i>your wife about this.

829
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:40,080
<i>Why is that?

830
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:42,706
<i>The whole time I was there,</i>
<i>Christine's what kept me alive.

831
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:46,180
<i>You want to know why</i>
<i>I'm not gonna tell my wife?

832
00:40:48,176 --> 00:40:50,075
<i>'Cause she's the one good thing</i>
<i>I got left in this world.

833
00:40:50,188 --> 00:40:52,132
<i>Maybe this way,</i>
<i>I get to keep that.
