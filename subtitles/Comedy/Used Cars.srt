1
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:22,687
Mornin', roy!

2
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:31,361
Same to you, asshole.

3
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:57,477
Rudy russo, mi amigo!
I bring you your cars.

4
00:03:57,649 --> 00:04:01,801
- They are beautiful, no?
- No! Are you using water- based paint?

5
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,887
Sure, we don't get much rain around here.

6
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:07,768
What do you want for 200?
Metalflake?

7
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:11,478
Listen, you don't like these cars...
here's my inventory.

8
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:14,482
- That's a picture of 250 cars.
- 253 cars.

9
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:17,686
The river has been
very good to me this year...

10
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:20,921
i can't make a deal
off a picture like this.

11
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,887
How about some girls? I got all kinds!

12
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:30,488
Short, tall, fat,
uglies, bonitas, señoritas, big tits...

13
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:34,562
later, i think i got a customer.
I'll think of something.

14
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:10,441
Student driver shit!

15
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:19,327
- Hey, rudy!
- Quiet!

16
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:22,720
- Jesus, you're not gonna...
- i'm gonna bait this guy.

17
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,962
- Luke's not gonna like that.
- Luke's asleep.

18
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:35,246
- Who's the grape?
- Right there, see him?

19
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:40,358
He pulled up in that red chevelle.
I'm gonna sell him my buick.

20
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:44,283
- Forget it. He pulled up in a red car.
- Come on, jeff, you got your foot.

21
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:48,442
A rabbit's foot
is no protection against a red car.

22
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,884
A red car is bad luck and trouble.

23
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:55,042
I gotta get some customers on this lot.
I gotta have some fast cash.

24
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,643
Yeah? For what?

25
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:02,040
For this.

26
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:07,242
Christ, first a red car, now this...

27
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:32,602
this man, roy I. Fuchs, doesn't lie.
This man gives you a special guarantee.

28
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:35,841
I mean, beautiful!
It's up to you, it's your decision.

29
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:38,842
One who hesitates is lost.

30
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:41,364
Where are you going, pal?
Come on back here!

31
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:53,960
Hi there! How you doing?

32
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:59,239
This your ten dollars?
I saw it floatin' underneath the car.

33
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:02,765
- Here you are. What's your name?
- Stanley dewoski.

34
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:05,363
What a coincidence! Rudy polanski.

35
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:09,124
- I like that watch... great shoes!
- Thanks.

36
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:13,043
So, you want to buy this buick, huh?
You got good taste.

37
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:17,521
Nice to see somebody on this lot who
knows a good car when he sees one.

38
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:21,079
- So, we write it up?
- Actually, i was just looking.

39
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:27,040
Hey, terrific! Here you can look, browse,
taste, smell, do anything you want.

40
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:30,201
Nobody's gonna pressure anybody
around here.

41
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:33,122
I really think
you ought to buy this buick.

42
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,565
You ought to buy it right now.
This buick is you.

43
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:41,484
This is your car! Stanley dewoski
is buick centurion convertible.

44
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:45,244
You're thinking,
"can i afford to buy a car like this?"

45
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:48,082
You can't afford
not to buy a car like this.

46
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:53,243
When you add this whole thing up,
you'll come out 10,000 dollars ahead.

47
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:57,721
The prestige of owning a buick centurion
can't be measured in dollars and cents.

48
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:00,801
What the hell
are you trying to tell me, sam?

49
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:07,158
I've been trying to make sure that new
freeway ramp ran through my brother's lot.

50
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:12,562
According to this, the goddam ramp is
coming right through the middle of my lot.

51
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,639
What's with that pinhead mayor?

52
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:20,644
He had no choice. It was the only way
to prove there was no conflict of interest.

53
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:22,367
That mayor don't know dick!

54
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:27,125
You're the assistant deputy
district attorney! Can't you fix it for me?

55
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:31,680
- I'm sorry, roy, it's too late.
- Just like that, huh?

56
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,159
This country's going to the dogs!

57
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:39,607
It used to be when you bought a politician,
that son of a bitch stayed bought.

58
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:44,079
You're gonna love it, stan!
Trust me!

59
00:08:45,849 --> 00:08:51,367
Shit! There goes a perfectly good
bumper sticker... hey, luke.

60
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,724
That's a nice pair of shoes.

61
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:57,768
You baited him, didn't you?
Skated him from across the street.

62
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:02,207
I had to. I can't sell a car
unless i get them on the lot.

63
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:04,883
Now, rudy, listen to me, will ya?

64
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:08,007
For the last time,
will you listen to me, son?

65
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:13,323
Suppose that he's an undercover agent
for the consumer protection agency.

66
00:09:13,489 --> 00:09:18,040
We're still on probation for
consumer fraud. We gotta watch our step.

67
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:23,329
My ravenous brother over there is just
waiting to get his grimy hands on this lot.

68
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:28,398
I'm desperate, i gotta move some cars.
I gotta make ten grand in six weeks.

69
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,845
Ten grand?
Are you in some kind of trouble?

70
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,887
No, no...
take a look at this.

71
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:40,607
There's an opening for state senate.

72
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:45,684
The machine's looking for a fresh face,
somebody with no axes to grind -

73
00:09:45,849 --> 00:09:50,365
- who wants to tell the people what they
want to hear. They're looking for me!

74
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:55,557
I talked to the party chairman last week.
Sixty grand buys me the nomination.

75
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:59,358
Sixty grand, huh?
That's all it takes nowadays?

76
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,724
No, that's like a down payment.

77
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:06,405
Once i'm in, i go fifty-fifty on
all the graft i take in. Politics, luke!

78
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:11,927
It's my chance to do something
with my life. Go places, meet people...

79
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:14,557
maybe even meet some broad...

80
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,647
still looking, huh, rudy?

81
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:23,837
I don't want to be stuck
on this dusty lot for the rest of my life.

82
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:29,083
I wanna make something out of myself,
have people look up at me for a change.

83
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:31,558
This is my once in a lifetime deal.

84
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:35,005
I took out a second mortgage
on my mobile home.

85
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:40,084
I cashed in my insurance policies,
sold my car and i'm still ten grand short.

86
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:43,127
Toby, get me a phillip's screwdriver.

87
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:49,808
Listen, i got some promotional ideas
that'll flood this place with prospects.

88
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:52,403
I found two electronics whizz-kids.

89
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,165
They know how to jam a football game
and sneak in some commercials.

90
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:00,526
Now, we get these strippers, big tits...

91
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:04,079
you know, i think we'll put
this baby on the line...

92
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:09,084
i can't fool with this forever.
Sixteen months is long enough.

93
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:13,321
No, toby, i said a phillip's screwdriver.

94
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:18,085
Luke, can i ask you something?
Why are we giving these cars away?

95
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:22,686
We're not giving them away.
School district's paying me 1200 apiece.

96
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,727
I can get 3950 apiece for these cars.

97
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:29,478
Those are the 1200 apiece cars.

98
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,880
What? These?

99
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:37,327
You are the craziest,
most irresponsible operator i ever met.

100
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:42,279
And when you stand there and tell me
that you want to be a politician...

101
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:46,601
i know you're right.
All right, i'll lend you the ten grand.

102
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:48,407
No shit, luke?

103
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:51,606
I wouldn't kid you
about something like that.

104
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,203
We'll go down to the bank in the morning.

105
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:59,807
Only i don't want to jam any football
games and i don't want any strippers.

106
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,961
Goddam, all right, luke! I love ya!

107
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,960
I'm on my way!

108
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:10,681
Ask not what your country's done for you,
ask what you've just done for your country!

109
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:14,046
Are you okay?
Hey, are you all right, luke?

110
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:17,321
I'm just not used to
all that kind of excitement.

111
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:21,607
Here... jesus, i'm sorry, luke.
Here, take a pill.

112
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:28,645
I'll be all right.
You just promise me one thing.

113
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:33,439
When you buy that election,
become a big-shot politician...

114
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:37,921
promise me you'll keep my brother
from getting his hands on this lot.

115
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:40,649
They know, don't they, sam?

116
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:46,520
They know they're about to have
the best freeway access in the state.

117
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:50,523
Nobody knows, roy.
It won't be announced for a few weeks yet.

118
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:56,719
I suggest you torch this museum and buy
out your brother with the insurance money.

119
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:03,044
If i could buy him out, do you think
i would try to have him put away?

120
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:07,168
The only way i'm going to
get that lot is to inherit it.

121
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:12,039
- I thought he had a daughter.
- She ain't been heard of in years.

122
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,440
The son of a bitch
has got a bad heart, you know.

123
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:18,169
Don't be stupid, roy.

124
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:23,119
- Just dreaming, sam, just dreaming.
- Right...

125
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:35,479
carmine!

126
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,482
Send in that new kid
from the demolition derby.

127
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:42,198
- Mickey?
- Yeah, mickey.

128
00:13:55,849 --> 00:14:00,365
Now, let's examine that pinto, shall we?
Look at that undercoating...

129
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,726
- classic chassis, pal.
- Thanks.

130
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:10,124
Shall we examine the capacious interior
of this luxury automobile?

131
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:17,322
I got this guy right where i want him.
Stay out of this...

132
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:21,568
charlie, good to see you. I got
the papers drawn up on that chrysler...

133
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:25,517
- it's a chevy nova.
- Hey, i'll be right with you.

134
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:28,123
Clown.

135
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,881
Excuse me, old man, you a salesman?

136
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:54,320
Now that's a miracle.

137
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,287
God in heaven, that's a miracle.

138
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:01,009
Excuse me, you a salesman here?

139
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:06,641
You know, i'm not one for religion, but
jesus, mary and joseph that is a miracle!

140
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:12,167
That was my daughter calling me.
Do you believe it? My own daughter.

141
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,399
I just want to buy a car.

142
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:18,323
She took off about ten years ago,
joined one of those communes.

143
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:22,641
I ain't seen or heard from her.
Didn't know if she was living or dead.

144
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:28,566
And all of a sudden she calls,
after ten years. Now that's a miracle.

145
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,720
I know how you feel, old man.

146
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:35,167
I had a dog once, ran away.
Only she got hit by a truck.

147
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:41,404
What's the story on this '57 chev here?
2400? Come on, you gotta be jacking me.

148
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:46,438
Now, son, you're looking at one of
the finest automobiles on this lot.

149
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:50,158
I rebuilt that engine
with my own two hands.

150
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,765
Does it run?

151
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:58,444
Does it run? Like a dream.

152
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:04,206
Well, old man, for 2400
it'd better run like a wet dream.

153
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:10,645
Yeah... that's a miracle.

154
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:17,764
Well, at least it starts, old man.

155
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:20,124
After ten years...

156
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:25,884
- you won't need that.
- I like to feel safe.

157
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:28,927
Easy now, easy.

158
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,922
Sounds good, old man!

159
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:39,127
What the hell was that?

160
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:53,368
You got a real oil pressure problem here,
it's running real hot... real hot.

161
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:01,643
Pills? What do you need
those pills for, old man?

162
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:14,117
Isn't this fun, old man?

163
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:23,442
You ever played chicken?
I love chicken... i love it.

164
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,649
You're a good sport, old man.
I like you.

165
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:35,882
What do you say we find out
what this baby is constructed of?

166
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:42,367
Come on, get over there, old man.

167
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:44,762
Oh shit!

168
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:52,326
What's the matter, old man?
You homesick?

169
00:17:57,689 --> 00:17:59,884
I'll have you home in a minute.

170
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:04,888
What the hell was that?

171
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:15,164
2400, old man? Well, i'm gonna have to
think about it. I got your card.

172
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:27,689
- I broke my back getting you this deal.
- Fifty bucks never killed anybody.

173
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,283
You're not going to find
another deal like this in town.

174
00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:34,124
- Fifty bucks never killed anybody.
- A deal's a deal.

175
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:37,406
- Fifty bucks never...
- okay, you got it, you win.

176
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:41,528
I'll see what i can do. But i'm
telling ya, my boss sees these figures, -

177
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:44,840
- when he sees these,
he's going to have a stroke.

178
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:49,366
What's he trying to pull?
Fifty bucks never killed anybody.

179
00:18:55,089 --> 00:19:00,243
Okay, it's a deal, it's a deal!
I'll sign! I'll sign!

180
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:05,127
I'm sorry! I shook on it! It's a deal!

181
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:09,441
I never welsh on a deal
and i really do want the car...

182
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:11,122
luke, where are your pills?

183
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:16,079
Jesus christ, you guys mean business!
I signed it! Show it to him!

184
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:19,161
Here's the down payment.
Here, show it to him.

185
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:22,645
Here's the money!
Here, take it!

186
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:26,245
Look... you guys are busy.
We'll pick the car up tomorrow.

187
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:30,004
Oh my god!
Honey, let's get out of here!

188
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:29,809
Jesus christ!

189
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:33,598
Luke's dead.
Calm down, we're being watched.

190
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:38,479
- By who?
- Who do you think?

191
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:58,880
Sam? Roy... roy!
Yeah, i know it's late.

192
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:03,440
First thing tomorrow, i want you to come
over here and visit my brother with me.

193
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:07,682
Well, i'm a little concerned
about his health.

194
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:12,564
And bring those probate papers with you.

195
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,447
Probate papers!

196
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:17,646
He's gone.

197
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:22,007
Jim, help me prop him up, i don't want
toby to see him like this.

198
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:27,118
Jesus, mary and... i don't know, man.
I think we're out of our minds here.

199
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:31,521
I think we've got to call the cops.
I mean, it's murder, for christ's sake!

200
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:36,479
You know that and i know. But the cops
are going to say it was a heart attack.

201
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:41,962
He's got no family, no will, no nothing.
That means his brother inherits this lot.

202
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:46,884
I promised him i wasn't going to let that
son of a bitch get his hands on this lot.

203
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:57,758
- Easy!
- Hey, don't worry about it!

204
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:02,320
Look, i helped put it up,
i ought to know how to take it down!

205
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,605
Okay, let it down easy.

206
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:16,044
Hey, man, this shit gives me the creeps.
He should be buried properly.

207
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:21,488
Nobody's gonna believe he drove his edsel
to miami. Nobody goes to miami!

208
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:26,200
Old people go to miami!
Where do you want him to go? Aspen?

209
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:30,965
- This crate won't go around the block!
- This motherfucker runs!

210
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:34,360
Please show a little respect
for the dead!

211
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:48,279
- You want to say something?
- Me? No.

212
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:51,441
- Jim?
- About what?

213
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,804
All right...

214
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:59,566
luke fuchs, you're about to drive
over the curb for the last time.

215
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:05,438
He was a good man,
an honest man, a trusted man.

216
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:09,204
We can't carve your name
on a granite tombstone, -

217
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:12,486
- but we can keep it
flying high above this lot.

218
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:15,288
We can't put flowers on your grave, -

219
00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:21,285
- but we can hang the finest vinyl pennants
and pinwheels that money can buy.

220
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:27,319
You'll be surrounded by an inventory
of the finest quality discount cars.

221
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:32,688
Ford, chrysler, general motors
will be your headstone.

222
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:38,683
High volume, high visibility
will be your epitaph.

223
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:40,999
Rest in peace, luke.

224
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:53,083
Keep shovelling.

225
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:08,008
Aren't you a little big
to be playing in the fucking mud?

226
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:11,127
- We're landscaping.
- We had some flooding last night.

227
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:13,757
So, what can i do you for?

228
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:18,525
- I'd like to talk to my brother.
- You're gonna have to talk kind of loud.

229
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:22,602
- He went to miami late last night.
- That's right, miami.

230
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:27,604
- Miami?
- Yeah, miami beach.

231
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:31,045
- Florida.
- I know where the fuck miami beach is.

232
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:34,042
Some asshole fucked up
one of his cars, -

233
00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:37,645
- so he decided he needed a little
r and r. He's got a bad heart.

234
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,085
- I know all about his goddam heart.
- I'm sure you do.

235
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:44,321
- What airline did he fly?
- Edsel.

236
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:49,287
I couldn't believe it either,
but that thing runs like new.

237
00:24:49,449 --> 00:24:51,565
That's bullshit, russo!

238
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:54,243
He had a stroke.
I saw him hit the floor.

239
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:59,324
What? Last night? He slipped on some
90-weight. He's okay, believe me.

240
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:02,720
He's lying, sam.
The son of a bitch is lying!

241
00:25:02,889 --> 00:25:05,403
He thinks i'm lying, jim.

242
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:10,962
Luke told me to have you arrested for
trespassing. Do i have to call the cops?

243
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:14,439
- Do we have to call the cops?
- Are you a fucking parrot?

244
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:19,160
- Come on, roy, let's go.
- Suck-ass son of a bitch.

245
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:23,328
Get the hell out of here!

246
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:27,801
- See, we got nothing to worry about.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

247
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:32,485
We've got a dead guy buried here
and we're going on tv illegally tonight.

248
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:34,560
We need customers.

249
00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:37,846
Sneaking a commercial
into a football game is illegal!

250
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:40,318
Freddie and eddie
know what they're doing.

251
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:44,448
What if the fcc wants to bust us
for false advertising?

252
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:48,887
We just work here.
They'll have to talk to the boss.

253
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:55,639
Coast is clear, freddie.

254
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:58,369
All right... and out.

255
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:13,481
Freddie, come here.

256
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:17,358
Are we gonna be able to film
under these blue lights?

257
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:20,407
We're not going to film
under the blue lights.

258
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:25,723
That's why i've got the sun guns
mounted on the van. Trust me, will ya?

259
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:28,608
- Rehearsal!
- We just sell this purple olds.

260
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:40,762
Margaret, this is where you
show us how you're gonna sit.

261
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:43,887
A little thigh
to keep their attention...

262
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:48,406
and then i'll say, "okay, margaret,
why don't you tell us about this one?"

263
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:54,644
This '76 delta 88 is really equipped with
white walls, radio and heater.

264
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:56,800
For only $695.

265
00:26:56,969 --> 00:27:01,121
Maroon car, my ass.
This motherfucker is red...

266
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:04,998
then i'm going to say, "and be sure
to check out those high beams."

267
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:09,128
I make a little titjoke.
I'm sorry this is so sexist...

268
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:12,725
- nice maroon car, ain't it?
- Yeah, purple...

269
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:23,040
- did you remember the sunglasses?
- I got something better. It's perfect...

270
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,803
idiot! You trying to murder me?
Trying to assault my person?

271
00:27:27,969 --> 00:27:31,041
This is perfect. They're disguises.

272
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:35,600
- What the hell is this?
- You're lucky, i only have three left.

273
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:40,758
Here we go.
Do me a favour and just put 'em on.

274
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:45,605
Rudy, come on!
I'm not doing a commercial wearing these.

275
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:51,321
- Sweetheart, you'll look great.
- We'll look like assholes!

276
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:55,323
- Stand by!
- Jeff, put 'em on. I'm serious.

277
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:57,559
- No!
- Stand by!

278
00:27:57,729 --> 00:28:00,801
- Ready when you are, freddie.
- He's got it at the forty.

279
00:28:00,969 --> 00:28:03,199
- Put 'em on, jeff!
- No, forget it!

280
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:06,679
- He's past the midfield stripe!
- No way!

281
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:08,805
He's on the thirty!

282
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:10,960
- Put 'em on!
- It's out of the question.

283
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:13,484
- He's on the twenty.
- No!

284
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:15,128
- Put 'em on!
- No, no, no!

285
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:17,086
- And eddie...
- what?

286
00:28:17,249 --> 00:28:20,400
- Take it!
- Okay, freddie.

287
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:24,442
My god, it's a red car.

288
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:35,525
That's a stupid place for a commercial.
I don't believe it! Did you see that?

289
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:39,204
Let's look at one of these
beautiful models, shall we?

290
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:44,879
- What the fuck is this, rudy?
- What did he say?

291
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:48,928
You know he just said "fuck"?
That's an fcc violation.

292
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:51,967
A red chariot to take my ass
straight to hell!

293
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:53,847
Margaret! Get out there!

294
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,202
Holy jesus!
She's caught on the hood ornament.

295
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:04,280
Stupid bitch! I hate women!

296
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:08,679
Rudy, look! It's a red car!

297
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:12,683
Well, folks, these people
are obviously hysterical -

298
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:16,683
- over the fabulous deals we have
here at new deal used cars.

299
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:21,559
We've got over ten jillion cars down here.
Every one a best deal like that.

300
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:25,085
- Let's take a look under the hood.
- What?!

301
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:37,526
- Hey, look, bare tits!
- That's disgusting!

302
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:40,123
I don't want my children to see that!

303
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:44,407
All those years at film school paid off.

304
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:54,366
Holy jesus palomino!

305
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:57,521
Seduce the camera...

306
00:29:57,689 --> 00:29:59,884
come on down to new deal used cars...

307
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:05,039
come on down and leave it to us.

308
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:16,758
Front page advertising and it's free.
Can you believe it?

309
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:23,004
- This is it, guys, it's time.
- I never sold no damn cars before.

310
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:27,367
Just get 'em in that car. Nothing sells
a car better than the car itself.

311
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:32,683
You gotta get their friendship, their trust,
then get their money. Ready, jeff?

312
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:35,568
Jim? Toby? You ready?

313
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:41,040
Okay, guys...

314
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,040
let's go!

315
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:50,125
Morning!

316
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:54,043
- Hi, there, mr and mrs...?
- O'hara.

317
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:57,884
Rudy o'brian, how are ya?
I've got this '74...

318
00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:00,688
- hi there, mr and mrs...?
- Lopez, señor.

319
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:05,525
Rudy garcia. '68 chevy...
take a look at it, i'll be right back.

320
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:07,884
- Hi there, mr and mrs...?
- Jackson.

321
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:12,759
Hey, rudy washington carver.
You checking out this cadillac...

322
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:18,208
look at that, mrs ingallheart, the
interior matches the colour of your eyes.

323
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:21,918
I just noticed something else.
Mrs lopez, do you realise -

324
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:26,765
- that your hair
matches the colour of these tyres?

325
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:31,161
- Let me get the door for you.
- That's all right, i'm just looking.

326
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:36,119
- Yeah, well, i want you to look inside.
- No, i don't want to get inside.

327
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:40,567
- It's comfy, roomy, a lot of leg room.
- I've just been looking around.

328
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:42,640
These aren't the cars i bought.

329
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:46,040
These are the cars your students
will be able to afford.

330
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:49,281
They should be
learning to drive in these cars.

331
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,486
- But the school board...
- they'll thank you.

332
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:56,722
Now, i'm the kind of guy that believes
that a man with your insight -

333
00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:02,765
- should be fairly compensated
for such high thinking, don't you agree?

334
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:05,839
Do you have a car in mind for me?

335
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:10,366
- I want you to look inside.
- I don't want to look inside!

336
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:14,761
Just get in the motherfucking car!
Get in there!

337
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:20,357
Boys! Out of the car! Now!

338
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:27,921
- Well, you like animals, don't you?
- Yeah, i got three dogs of my own.

339
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:32,924
Then you understand when i say that not
only do i think this is the car for you, -

340
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:37,480
- but toby thinks this is
the car for you, don't you, toby?

341
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:40,686
There you see, isn't that cute?

342
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:48,279
So, al, the least we can do
is take the car for a test drive.

343
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:53,324
Toby wants to go for a test drive,
don't you, toby?

344
00:32:54,649 --> 00:32:59,598
- Test drive with toby, how about it, al?
- All right.

345
00:33:01,249 --> 00:33:06,039
Okay, everybody in the car!
In the car, kids!

346
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:10,407
Everybody in the car,
test drive with toby...

347
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:15,324
we're going for a test drive
with toby, that's right...

348
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:27,843
so, al, listen,
this baby's got a big engine...

349
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:31,081
a lot of power, big v8.

350
00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:36,277
I want you to feel that pickup.
So just go right ahead and punch it.

351
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:38,599
Punch it?

352
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:42,717
Stop!

353
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,082
Oh my god!

354
00:33:57,209 --> 00:34:02,966
You killed my dog, mister.
You killed my dog!

355
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:05,597
I'm sorry...

356
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:11,207
all he wanted was for you to be happy
in this car... and now he's dead.

357
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:14,600
How was i supposed to know...?

358
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:19,763
- We raised it from a puppy...
- how could you?

359
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:26,683
Look, mister, i know
i can't bring your dog back...

360
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:35,048
but... how about if i buy the car?

361
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:52,718
Nail 'em for false advertising.
They said they had 10 million cars.

362
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,801
They said they had ten jillion cars.

363
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,678
Even if they said ten million,
i've got to prosecute the owner.

364
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:02,841
He's off on a
fishing expedition in florida.

365
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:07,958
Fishing expedition, my ass! He's sitting
at the bottom of a lake someplace.

366
00:35:08,129 --> 00:35:10,518
You've got no proof.

367
00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:14,284
What do i need proof for?
I'm roy I. Fuchs, goddammit!

368
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:18,044
If you won't help me put them
out of business, i'll do it by myself.

369
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:22,885
By using the greatest tool this country
ever developed: Free enterprise.

370
00:35:23,049 --> 00:35:25,768
The american way!

371
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:32,687
This is the best goddam gimmick i've
come up with so far, this circus idea...

372
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:37,206
come on in, ride the camel,
feed the helium and drive out a car.

373
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:41,362
Come on in, join the circus!

374
00:35:44,129 --> 00:35:47,439
Look at them over there.
Not a customer on the lot.

375
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:52,808
That commercial was a fluke.
They're practically out of business.

376
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:58,521
Yeah, that's what the people want:
Old-fashioned, homespun entertainment.

377
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:02,318
That's what roy I. Fuchs stands for too.

378
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:05,799
I just hope that goddam camel
don't shit all over the lot.

379
00:36:39,009 --> 00:36:43,685
Folks! Here at new deal used cars
we are stripping away inflation!

380
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:46,204
We're taking off those high prices!

381
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:50,203
We're getting down to
the bare minimums, so come on over -

382
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:57,400
- and check out the front ends of these
beauties and inspect the rear ends too!

383
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:25,323
Scum...

384
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:44,842
all you have to do
is sign your name right here...

385
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:48,888
over there we have
a group of immoral charlatans.

386
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:52,439
They will stoop to the lowest...
oh shit, cut it! What?

387
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:56,204
- You can't say that on tv.
- I can say any goddam thing i want.

388
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:59,918
- This is the american way.
- It's slander, they can sue you.

389
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:04,765
Only the owner could sue me and he
has to be alive. Now get out of here.

390
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:17,118
Hey, rudy, it's old lorette here.
I was out buying some peroxide today-

391
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:22,807
- and there was this clerk who looks
just like you and it got me thinking...

392
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:27,646
hi, rudy, this is nadine.

393
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:33,486
If you don't have a date, i bought
this new barry manilow record today...

394
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:41,164
it's mary lou bainbridge,
if you throw out my number again...

395
00:39:42,169 --> 00:39:47,926
rudy, it's jeff. Watch the channel 12
movie tonight, we're in big trouble.

396
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:58,606
...a menace that should be brought
to the attention of every decent citizen.

397
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:02,921
Behind me is the automobile business
at its absolute worst.

398
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:08,117
A group of immoral charlatans,
masquerading as businessmen.

399
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:13,044
They will stoop to the lowest, most
vulgar, vile and disgusting ploys -

400
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:16,645
- to deceive the honest,
hard-working citizen.

401
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:20,085
They are the lowest form of scum
on the face of the earth...

402
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:23,002
son of a bitch!

403
00:40:23,169 --> 00:40:26,639
This is roy I. Fuchs,
pre-owned automobiles.

404
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,125
Just a second, pal!

405
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,484
Jam the presidential address?

406
00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:37,039
I hate to break this to you,
but you're out of your friggin' mind.

407
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:39,484
You've gone right over the edge...

408
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:43,722
national television, we'll be on
all three networks at the same time.

409
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:46,198
- How's that even done?
- Freddie?

410
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:49,042
- Microwaves.
- Great, little ovens...

411
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:54,488
it's simple. You take the microwaves
and you bounce 'em off a comsat.

412
00:40:54,649 --> 00:40:57,004
A communication satellite.

413
00:40:57,169 --> 00:41:00,366
We bounce the microwave
off the comsat to eddie -

414
00:41:00,529 --> 00:41:04,761
- on the roof of the phone company
in washington dc.

415
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:10,322
We intercept carter's transmission
and jam it with our own.

416
00:41:10,489 --> 00:41:14,801
- Is this a great idea?
- When is this presidential address?

417
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:16,800
Tomorrow night, nine o'clock.

418
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:22,202
We should break in around 9.03,
before the audience gets too bored.

419
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:24,246
Jesus, guys, i don't know.

420
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:28,288
My horoscope says,
"trouble brewing on the horizon."

421
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:32,681
And, i mean, we're fucking
with the president of the united states!

422
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:34,805
He fucks with us, doesn't he?

423
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:37,403
You've seen
how shitty business is today.

424
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:43,758
Thanks to fuchs, we had nuns
protesting outside when i got here.

425
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:49,401
- Jim had to turn the fire hose on them.
- I knocked them right on their ass too!

426
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:54,927
I'm still five grand short.
We've got to fight fire with fire.

427
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:58,923
You'll be fighting fire
with enhanced radiation weaponry.

428
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:02,047
You guys are sure
you can pull this off, right?

429
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:04,803
Are we sure we can pull this off?

430
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:08,803
If i can build and install
a pacemaker in this man's chest, -

431
00:42:08,969 --> 00:42:12,598
- i can damn well
bounce a microwave off a satellite!

432
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:16,318
Jesus, look at this thing!
Look at this...

433
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:18,844
only twelve ninety-five.

434
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:21,398
Don't you have some equipment to hook up?

435
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:25,847
Oh shit! Radio shack
closes in half an hour. Let's go!

436
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:29,046
- How do you change the batteries?
- It's rechargeable.

437
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:33,885
Guys! Back door, it's still light outside.
See you tomorrow night.

438
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:37,928
- Remember: We cut in at exactly 9.03.
- Post meridian.

439
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:40,728
- What?
- Never mind.

440
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:43,528
Okay, freddie, 9.03.

441
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:53,566
- What are you guys doing?
- Will you get down!

442
00:42:53,729 --> 00:42:56,482
- What?
- Do you see that woman out there?

443
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:02,079
She's trouble.
She pulled up in that red toyota.

444
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:07,084
I'm not kidding! I think she's from
the consumer protection agency.

445
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:10,844
You see the way she's looking at that
blue chevy? She knows it's a taxi.

446
00:43:11,009 --> 00:43:12,727
You're paranoid.

447
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:16,359
I bet you the first thing she asks is,
"where's the owner?"

448
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:22,047
Girls who look that great don't work
for the consumer protection agency.

449
00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:25,918
Just don't let the little head
do the thinking for the big head.

450
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:29,001
- Trust me.
- I do.

451
00:43:29,169 --> 00:43:32,764
Congratulations!
This is our giveaway week.

452
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:36,285
Since you're our one hundredth customer,
you win.

453
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:41,807
You just won a candlelight dinner for two,
but i can see there's only one of you.

454
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:46,964
So i'll throw myself in with the deal.
How does that sound?

455
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:56,243
Listen, can you tell me
where i might find the owner?

456
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:03,567
Well... yeah...

457
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:07,005
great, because, you see,
i was just trying to...

458
00:44:07,169 --> 00:44:11,765
let me tell you about this car.
I can give you an unbelievably low price.

459
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:15,683
I would certainly hope so.
Look at the finish.

460
00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:19,603
- Is something wrong with the finish?
- Yeah, i see primer.

461
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:21,885
Where?

462
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:26,122
I see yellow primer here,
i see it here, i see it here...

463
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:31,602
she's baiting him.
She's knows it's a taxi, rudy!

464
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:35,125
She's from the
consumer protection agency.

465
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:40,124
I'm not with any consumer protection
agency. I used to be, but i'm not now.

466
00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:44,521
- Better business bureau? Nader's raiders?
- Trust me.

467
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:51,729
As in, "trust me"?
So, look, about dinner...

468
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:56,007
- listen, is luke in his office?
- No. What do you feel like eating?

469
00:44:56,169 --> 00:44:59,479
- Do you expect him back shortly?
- No, he's out of town...

470
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:04,484
- he's out of town? On business?
- Pleasure. He's in miami beach.

471
00:45:04,649 --> 00:45:08,085
- Miami?
- Miami beach.

472
00:45:08,249 --> 00:45:11,400
I've been to miami beach.
It's not that bad.

473
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:14,083
I was supposed to meet my father here.

474
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:17,446
We'll find him,
what kind of car does he drive?

475
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:21,318
He used to have a green and white edsel.

476
00:45:23,209 --> 00:45:26,884
Who do you think this is?
That's her.

477
00:45:29,169 --> 00:45:31,524
No resemblance.

478
00:45:31,689 --> 00:45:35,568
I've been selling cars long enough to
know when somebody's telling the truth.

479
00:45:35,729 --> 00:45:39,517
That is luke's daughter. Do we have any
health food restaurants in this town?

480
00:45:39,689 --> 00:45:43,204
If that's luke's daughter,
we've got to get rid of her.

481
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:47,044
What if she figures out what's going on?
What if she sees our commercial?

482
00:45:47,209 --> 00:45:50,519
Why not just throw her in the hole
with her old man?

483
00:45:50,689 --> 00:45:53,681
When i take her out to dinner,
i'll get her drunk.

484
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:57,808
I'll tell her the reason that luke
went to florida was...

485
00:45:57,969 --> 00:46:01,006
best salad bar in town:
Airport lanes!

486
00:46:02,049 --> 00:46:04,040
Oh, stop it...

487
00:46:04,209 --> 00:46:08,122
and he says,
"don't ask me, i'm just a farmer."

488
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:15,647
That is the most disgusting joke
i've ever heard.

489
00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:23,486
- Listen, i wanted to ask you something.
- What?

490
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:27,562
How did you know that i used to work
for the consumer protection agency?

491
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:32,678
The thing with the taxi? Why didn't you
tell me it was yellow primer?

492
00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:37,161
I knew you were baiting me,
so i told you a bigger bunch of bullshit.

493
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:41,686
At least you're very honest
about your dishonesty and i admire that.

494
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:44,647
I really do.

495
00:46:52,049 --> 00:46:55,837
Look, barbara, about luke...
i got to tell you something...

496
00:46:56,009 --> 00:47:00,958
- luke left for florida the night i called.
- That's not the reason he left.

497
00:47:01,129 --> 00:47:07,728
I think it would be better for me and
for everybody concerned if i just leave.

498
00:47:07,889 --> 00:47:12,167
I was thinking of heading
up to oregon or something like that.

499
00:47:14,049 --> 00:47:18,645
Thank you very much for taking
care of me. It was very considerate.

500
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:25,760
I really had a good time.
Maybe we'll do it again sometime.

501
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:31,048
Thanks a lot.
Goodbye... thanks.

502
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:39,807
Barbara... wait a minute.

503
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:46,885
Look, i know that
sometimes i can come off as -

504
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:51,406
- kind of insincere, but...

505
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:56,444
i want you to know
that i really like you.

506
00:47:56,609 --> 00:48:02,639
I haven't had this much fun
with a girl ever... in my life, so...

507
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:09,078
once you and luke get your problems
worked out, come by and look me up.

508
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:35,161
I've been thinking about
what you've been saying about luke...

509
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:39,880
i'm passing judgement on a man
i haven't even seen in ten years.

510
00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:42,722
I have to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

511
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:45,961
So i've decided to
stick around for a few days.

512
00:48:46,129 --> 00:48:49,724
So, see you tomorrow, okay?
Goodnight.

513
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:58,721
- She's staying?
- Yeah, she's staying.

514
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:02,006
I told her luke would call.
What else could i do?

515
00:49:02,169 --> 00:49:03,727
What the fuck is that?

516
00:49:03,889 --> 00:49:07,404
If she sees our commercial,
she's going to be suspicious.

517
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:11,403
We're going to have a billion people
on the lot tomorrow.

518
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:14,845
I've been up all night,
trying to figure this out.

519
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:18,479
There's only one thing we can do:
Cancel the commercial.

520
00:49:18,649 --> 00:49:21,641
Guys, i've got the solution
to our problem.

521
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:25,085
Courtesy of the beautiful daphne.
What i have here -

522
00:49:25,249 --> 00:49:28,002
- is a one-way train ticket to miami.

523
00:49:28,169 --> 00:49:30,683
You take it out there
and give it to barbara.

524
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:34,364
Tell her luke called
and wants her to come straight down.

525
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:41,162
Jim and i will do the commercial,
you get her on the train at midnight.

526
00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:43,843
I feel horseshit enough as it is.

527
00:49:44,009 --> 00:49:46,967
I took her to a bowling alley,
for christ's sake!

528
00:49:47,129 --> 00:49:49,165
I can't do this to her.

529
00:49:51,169 --> 00:49:53,683
What would a senator do, huh?

530
00:50:12,689 --> 00:50:15,601
Don't you like your salad?

531
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:23,084
Where are you?
You're certainly not here.

532
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:32,688
I was thinking how much easier everything
would have been if you'd come last week.

533
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:35,682
I don't understand. Why?

534
00:50:43,129 --> 00:50:45,518
There's something i got to tell you.

535
00:50:45,689 --> 00:50:48,601
I don't know
if this is the right time, but...

536
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:52,045
the truth of this whole thing
is that luke...

537
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:55,241
sir? I believe you dropped this.

538
00:50:55,409 --> 00:50:57,525
Thanks.

539
00:50:57,689 --> 00:50:59,805
Wait a minute.

540
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:02,403
Rudy, this is a ticket to miami.

541
00:51:02,569 --> 00:51:06,687
- I was going to wait till after dessert.
- You talked to luke last night?

542
00:51:06,849 --> 00:51:09,363
Well, no...

543
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:13,363
i tried to get a hold of him, but he's
still on that fishing charter and...

544
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:19,718
- i just decided to take it on myself.
- That's the most considerate thing.

545
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:23,359
- But i can't go.
- What?

546
00:51:23,529 --> 00:51:29,445
I don't want to force myself on him,
i just want to wait till he comes back.

547
00:51:29,609 --> 00:51:35,002
And, besides, i'm having a wonderful time.
You're really great company.

548
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:02,803
Perfect.

549
00:52:22,489 --> 00:52:27,404
Okay, okay... freddie?
We got to go, jim's ready.

550
00:52:27,569 --> 00:52:30,561
The president isn't ready
and he's a bit more important.

551
00:52:30,729 --> 00:52:33,721
- We got to go!
- Why are you so nervous?

552
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:37,677
I'm not nervous! I'm so full of valium,
i rattle when i walk!

553
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:41,728
All right, fine...
could i offer you a sleeping pill?

554
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:56,405
- Listen, if i take any more shit...
- aha! There we are.

555
00:52:56,569 --> 00:52:59,800
- What the hell is this?
- This is a test pattern.

556
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:04,918
Okay, i'm receiving your test pattern,
you're looking real good.

557
00:53:05,089 --> 00:53:08,206
Carter goes on in 28 seconds.

558
00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:13,159
The programme originally scheduled
will not be seen in order that...

559
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:16,048
i didn't know president carter
was going to be on tv.

560
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:19,758
Do you mind turning that thing off?
I'm trying to eat.

561
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:23,160
Have a little respect.
This happens to be the president.

562
00:53:23,329 --> 00:53:26,878
Respect, my ass, food giant!
I'm paying 20 bucks for this meal.

563
00:53:27,049 --> 00:53:30,280
Well, how would you like
that tv stuck up your ass?

564
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:33,486
Fellas, it's not worth all this trouble.

565
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:39,164
- I gotta get some air.
- Are you all right?

566
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:43,368
- I gotta get some fresh air.
- Are you going to be okay?

567
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:51,127
Are you all right?

568
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:56,325
Good, just come over here
and sit down for a second.

569
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:10,677
Inflation is obviously
a serious problem.

570
00:54:14,649 --> 00:54:16,082
What is the solution?

571
00:54:19,249 --> 00:54:21,638
You want the solution to inflation?

572
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:26,519
Marshall lucky here, where we're
battling inflation not only-

573
00:54:26,689 --> 00:54:29,408
- by fighting high prices, -

574
00:54:29,569 --> 00:54:32,845
- but by blowing the living shit
out of high prices!

575
00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:38,925
You heard me right! Here's an example:
1973 cadillac coup deville for $6299.

576
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:41,444
That price is too high.

577
00:54:48,969 --> 00:54:54,282
Yessir! Here's another one:
A lincoln continental mark 4, 1973, -

578
00:54:54,489 --> 00:54:57,879
- it's loaded, it's got
airconditioning, it's got a stereo, -

579
00:54:58,049 --> 00:55:01,837
- it's got power steering, power breaks,
power seats, power windows -

580
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:04,842
- and a price that isjust too high!

581
00:55:10,649 --> 00:55:13,959
Now, remember, friends...

582
00:55:14,129 --> 00:55:17,883
look out, marshall lucky,
it's high prices!

583
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:21,166
Take this, you dirty, old high prices!

584
00:55:23,969 --> 00:55:25,960
You got me, marshall!

585
00:55:26,129 --> 00:55:27,687
Jesus christ...

586
00:55:30,449 --> 00:55:35,807
yessir, so remember, friends,
that's new deal used cars.

587
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:38,403
Now wait just a goddam minute!
What the hell is this?

588
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:43,438
Is this a 1977 mercedes 450 sl
for 24000 dollars?

589
00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:46,806
That's too fuckin' high!

590
00:55:51,569 --> 00:55:54,402
You son of a bitch!

591
00:55:54,569 --> 00:55:57,766
We blew the shit out of
that overpriced motherfucker-

592
00:55:57,929 --> 00:56:02,878
- just the way we blow the shit out of
all high prices at new deal used cars.

593
00:56:03,049 --> 00:56:05,119
So you all come on down!

594
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:08,281
New deal used cars.
So you all come on down!

595
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:10,485
Did you hear what i said?

596
00:56:10,649 --> 00:56:14,198
I have heard you
with unmistakable clarity.

597
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:16,803
You son of a bitch!

598
00:56:21,809 --> 00:56:25,006
- Let's go!
- Move this motherfucker!

599
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,688
...a free economy
cannot cope with inflation.

600
00:56:28,849 --> 00:56:32,125
If we've lost our ability
to act as a nation, rather than -

601
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:34,723
- as a collection
of special interests...

602
00:56:34,889 --> 00:56:38,768
and i reply, "what kind
of people do they think we are?"

603
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:41,045
You want to give me that again?

604
00:56:41,209 --> 00:56:45,839
As i say, i heard this large explosion,
i couldn't tell what was going on.

605
00:56:46,009 --> 00:56:50,719
I saw the car over there in flames
and all these strange little characters -

606
00:56:50,889 --> 00:56:56,088
- with towels on their heads,
yelling, "ayatollah, ayatollah!"

607
00:56:56,249 --> 00:57:01,369
Then they all got in a car and drove
away. I guess it was iranian students, -

608
00:57:01,529 --> 00:57:05,408
- out to discredit
the american way of life.

609
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:08,447
I can't imagine who else
would do such a thing.

610
00:57:08,609 --> 00:57:10,600
Let's go.

611
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:15,879
Sure hope you nail 'em.
Happy motoring.

612
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:28,998
Hey, jim, did those fbi guys...
were they... jim?

613
00:57:31,369 --> 00:57:34,600
Combat fatigue... shit.

614
00:58:12,649 --> 00:58:15,721
I'll teach you to wreck my cars,
you son of a bitch!

615
00:58:30,609 --> 00:58:32,884
Okay, now, you asked for it now.

616
00:58:47,729 --> 00:58:49,959
Get off my back, you lunatic!

617
00:59:12,209 --> 00:59:15,042
All right,
now i'm gonna have to hurt you.

618
00:59:23,609 --> 00:59:25,804
Where's my brother?

619
00:59:30,729 --> 00:59:33,960
Where are you hiding my brother, you...

620
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:49,287
the pit...
they filled in the pit!

621
01:00:13,529 --> 01:00:16,123
I knew it!

622
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:23,162
Get off!

623
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:25,365
Dumb dog!

624
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:33,560
Get away!

625
01:00:35,409 --> 01:00:37,206
Get off!

626
01:00:37,369 --> 01:00:39,360
Get away, you dumb dog!

627
01:01:03,129 --> 01:01:07,441
Toby! You pissed on my... goddammit!

628
01:01:23,569 --> 01:01:27,198
Now aren't you glad
i didn't go to florida?

629
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:33,285
Since you brought that up...

630
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:38,558
there's something
i gotta get off my chest...

631
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:43,678
this is rudy. If you leave your name
and your number, i'll get back to you.

632
01:01:43,849 --> 01:01:47,922
Rudy, it's jim!
If you're there, pick up! Emergency!

633
01:01:48,089 --> 01:01:50,125
What is it?

634
01:01:53,729 --> 01:01:56,118
Jesus!

635
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:02,008
Where are you now?

636
01:02:02,169 --> 01:02:04,922
Don't worry, i'll be right there.

637
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:07,683
What is it?
Is it about luke?

638
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:12,047
- No, no.
- Well, what then?

639
01:02:12,209 --> 01:02:14,677
What is it about? What's going on?

640
01:02:14,889 --> 01:02:19,838
Jeff, he got in a fight, i gotta go down
to the station house and bail him out.

641
01:02:20,009 --> 01:02:23,604
I'll be right back. See you later.

642
01:02:49,289 --> 01:02:53,168
Rudy, it's jim. If you're there,
pick up! Emergency!

643
01:02:53,329 --> 01:02:55,365
What is it?

644
01:02:55,529 --> 01:02:58,521
Fuchs knows luke's dead.
He found out where we buried him.

645
01:02:58,689 --> 01:03:00,680
- Jesus!
- He beat up jeff!

646
01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:03,761
The cops are gonna think
we killed him!

647
01:03:03,929 --> 01:03:06,204
- Where are you now?
- At the lot!

648
01:03:06,369 --> 01:03:07,802
I'll be right there.

649
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:17,685
The white house reaction
has been negative.

650
01:03:17,849 --> 01:03:22,877
Do you think we like being associated
with the president of the united states?

651
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,926
We run an honest lot here!

652
01:03:40,769 --> 01:03:45,763
Come on, guys! We're not even open yet!
I told you to keep your ass off this lot.

653
01:03:46,009 --> 01:03:49,046
Yeah, show him the warrant, sam.

654
01:03:49,209 --> 01:03:52,360
- Bring those picks over here!
- A search warrant?

655
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:55,760
What the hell are you guys looking for?

656
01:03:55,929 --> 01:03:57,647
Start digging over here.

657
01:03:57,809 --> 01:04:02,564
Hold on! You bust in here, disrupt our
business, start digging up our lawn, -

658
01:04:02,729 --> 01:04:05,482
- at least tell us
what the hell you're looking for.

659
01:04:05,649 --> 01:04:08,243
You buried my brother here
and you know it.

660
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:11,207
What? Roy, are you looking for luke?

661
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:16,238
He was here 30 minutes ago.
He'll be right back.

662
01:04:16,409 --> 01:04:18,684
You spoke to lucas fuchs 30 minutes ago?

663
01:04:18,849 --> 01:04:21,602
He got back
from miami beach last night.

664
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:42,242
Oh shit, he smells!

665
01:04:44,609 --> 01:04:48,318
Come on, luke... i'm sorry, luke.

666
01:04:53,049 --> 01:04:55,563
Shut up, toby! I hear you!

667
01:05:02,129 --> 01:05:04,165
Adios, luke!

668
01:05:06,209 --> 01:05:10,999
I'm telling you guys, you're wasting
your time. Here he comes now!

669
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:19,685
Jesus, he is still alive.
Where the hell is he going?

670
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:24,206
- He's exceeding the speed limit.
- He's got to be drunk.

671
01:05:30,569 --> 01:05:33,800
He's heading right for the transformer!

672
01:05:49,649 --> 01:05:52,038
All right, grab that pump!

673
01:05:52,209 --> 01:05:55,804
Very neat, russo, very clean...

674
01:05:55,969 --> 01:06:00,838
plenty of witnesses, everything
up in flames, not a trace of evidence.

675
01:06:01,009 --> 01:06:05,400
Shrewd... kept yourself out of jail.

676
01:06:05,569 --> 01:06:08,879
- Now get the fuck off my lot.
- Your lot?

677
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:12,519
You just handed it to me
on a silver platter.

678
01:06:12,729 --> 01:06:18,884
Afraid not, roy. Luke's got a daughter.
You remember barbara? She's back in town.

679
01:06:19,049 --> 01:06:22,803
I bet you haven't seen her in ten years.
You wanna talk to her?

680
01:06:22,969 --> 01:06:26,166
She's staying over at my place.

681
01:06:30,129 --> 01:06:31,926
You son of a bitch.

682
01:06:34,969 --> 01:06:38,439
Get off me!
Get this maniac off me!

683
01:06:38,609 --> 01:06:42,761
- Get him off!
- Okay, mac, come on, here you go.

684
01:06:42,929 --> 01:06:44,965
Oh my god...

685
01:06:45,129 --> 01:06:49,805
get your hands off me!
I'm roy I. Fuchs, you son of a bitch!

686
01:06:51,409 --> 01:06:56,403
Barbara! There's been a terrible accident,
your father's dead.

687
01:06:56,569 --> 01:07:01,848
Why don't you tell her the truth, russo?
He buried him back there in the edsel!

688
01:07:02,009 --> 01:07:08,005
- Will you please tell me the truth?
- All right...

689
01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:13,882
your father wasn't in miami,
never was...

690
01:07:14,049 --> 01:07:20,807
he was in aspen. He didn't want you
to be here when he got back...

691
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:24,598
rudy, you're fired
and you can take your friends with you.

692
01:07:24,769 --> 01:07:26,760
Get off my lot!

693
01:07:37,969 --> 01:07:39,197
Shit!

694
01:07:40,929 --> 01:07:42,965
So? What do you say?

695
01:07:45,049 --> 01:07:48,485
I'll have to think about it.
He's an asshole.

696
01:07:48,649 --> 01:07:52,847
Don't think too long. A ninth-grader
was looking at it yesterday.

697
01:07:54,289 --> 01:07:58,282
Real grinders.
Tougher to close than their parents.

698
01:07:59,129 --> 01:08:02,917
Aw christ...
how am i gonna come up with five grand?

699
01:08:06,329 --> 01:08:12,928
Why don't you call my bookie,
put some money on the game tonight, huh?

700
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:16,968
I got a good feeling about denver.
Here's his number.

701
01:08:17,129 --> 01:08:19,245
Denver's ranked tenth.

702
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:25,723
That's right, but i found a dime in a
payphone booth this morning. Ten cents, -

703
01:08:25,889 --> 01:08:30,167
- minted in denver. The numbers that i
dialled on the phone added up to ten.

704
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:34,959
Today is the tenth... and you know
what time it was when i found the dime?

705
01:08:35,169 --> 01:08:37,637
Ten after ten!

706
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:40,607
I can't lose, so i bet ten bucks.

707
01:08:40,769 --> 01:08:43,329
That's the dumbest fucking shit
i ever heard in my life.

708
01:08:43,489 --> 01:08:48,847
Superstitious crap... i'm gonna push you
under a ladder on friday the 13th.

709
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:56,168
Why don't you just go ahead and call her?

710
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:59,878
She knows you belong on that lot.
Just call her.

711
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:10,283
Okay, okay, okay...

712
01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:15,201
mr russo?

713
01:09:15,409 --> 01:09:18,048
This is mr caldwell, the party chairman.

714
01:09:18,209 --> 01:09:23,078
The machine has to present its slate
of candidates the day after tomorrow.

715
01:09:23,249 --> 01:09:26,685
We'll need your contribution.
You do have it, don't you?

716
01:09:26,849 --> 01:09:29,647
- Yeah, i got it.
- Very good.

717
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:35,240
Put it out! Put it out!

718
01:09:48,129 --> 01:09:49,926
Here's the script, boss.

719
01:09:50,089 --> 01:09:52,319
You're sure this is the one they're
filming over there now?

720
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:55,879
- I swiped it right off the truck.
- Well, this stinks.

721
01:09:56,049 --> 01:10:00,201
I wouldn't buy a car from anybody
who put this kind of shit on tv.

722
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:04,804
- Would you?
- I wouldn't.

723
01:10:04,969 --> 01:10:08,803
That's what i keep telling you.
She don't know what the hell she's doing.

724
01:10:08,969 --> 01:10:14,760
She hasn't sold a car in four days. At this
rate she'll be bankrupt in three weeks.

725
01:10:18,609 --> 01:10:21,248
Roy? Sam. Any progress with your niece?

726
01:10:21,409 --> 01:10:24,640
No, she's as stubborn as her old man.
She won't sell dick.

727
01:10:24,809 --> 01:10:28,722
But i'll just bide my time.
She'll be bankrupt in two weeks.

728
01:10:28,889 --> 01:10:30,880
You haven't any time to bide.

729
01:10:31,049 --> 01:10:34,644
The mayor's going to announce
the new freeway the day after tomorrow.

730
01:10:34,809 --> 01:10:38,722
You'd better find some sucker
to buy your lot.

731
01:10:39,529 --> 01:10:41,679
Roy?

732
01:10:43,169 --> 01:10:49,278
Asshole mayor!
We know anybody over at channel 7?

733
01:10:58,969 --> 01:11:01,563
Now watch this.

734
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:06,519
See the... style of cars
we have to choose from. We have...

735
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:10,722
you see where she said "style"?

736
01:11:10,889 --> 01:11:16,282
See the... style of cars
we have to choose from...

737
01:11:17,329 --> 01:11:20,287
further on down she says this:

738
01:11:20,449 --> 01:11:27,241
3217 valley road, just one mile...
west of...

739
01:11:28,569 --> 01:11:32,164
a mile. I took the word mile
and i put it over style.

740
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:34,399
Now watch this.

741
01:11:34,569 --> 01:11:40,724
Come on down and see the mile
of cars we have to choose from.

742
01:11:41,729 --> 01:11:44,004
Son of a bitch!

743
01:11:44,169 --> 01:11:46,603
Let me see that again.

744
01:11:49,409 --> 01:11:55,518
See the... mile of cars...
we have to choose from...

745
01:11:55,689 --> 01:11:59,125
goddam, that's terrific!
What do you think, sam?

746
01:11:59,289 --> 01:12:01,928
Most blatant case of false advertising.

747
01:12:02,089 --> 01:12:05,445
I could have her convicted
24 hours after it's aired.

748
01:12:05,609 --> 01:12:09,045
- When are they going to show that?
- During tonight's game.

749
01:12:09,209 --> 01:12:15,682
Why don't you come on down and see
the mile of cars we have to choose from?

750
01:12:15,849 --> 01:12:18,443
She said she had a mile of cars.

751
01:12:18,609 --> 01:12:20,759
Can you believe that?

752
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:26,287
That's the most blatant claim
of false advertising i ever heard.

753
01:12:30,089 --> 01:12:33,047
She sure looks good, though, doesn't she?

754
01:12:39,049 --> 01:12:42,280
Russo, i've been looking
all over for you.

755
01:12:42,449 --> 01:12:45,725
I'm about to lose my job
because of you.

756
01:12:45,889 --> 01:12:51,361
I've got more than 250 sophomores who
aren't going to pass driver education -

757
01:12:51,529 --> 01:12:54,521
- because your frigging cars won't run.

758
01:12:54,689 --> 01:12:59,080
You got an auto-shop class. Enrol your
sophomores and teach them something.

759
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:01,126
I'll teach you something.

760
01:13:22,369 --> 01:13:25,441
What did i tell you, rudy?
Denver!

761
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:28,248
When i get a feeling, i get a feeling.

762
01:13:28,409 --> 01:13:32,084
Hell of a game!
You should have put some money on it.

763
01:13:32,249 --> 01:13:34,763
- I did.
- Great!

764
01:13:34,929 --> 01:13:37,602
On kansas city.

765
01:13:40,209 --> 01:13:44,327
Kansas city?
How much did you put down?

766
01:13:46,049 --> 01:13:47,767
All of it.

767
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:49,965
All of it?

768
01:13:51,049 --> 01:13:53,438
Everything i own.

769
01:13:56,329 --> 01:13:59,321
Forty gs?!

770
01:13:59,489 --> 01:14:04,438
You dope! You just threw it
right down the tubes!

771
01:14:04,609 --> 01:14:10,923
Don't you get it? The only way
you can win is if... if i lose.

772
01:14:12,889 --> 01:14:18,407
I wouldn't worry about that.
I think your money's in the bag.

773
01:14:18,569 --> 01:14:23,165
A minute to go... i think denver would
have to run into some pretty bad luck.

774
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:27,800
...denver would have to run
into some pretty bad luck...

775
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:48,240
he fumbled the ball!
It's recovered...

776
01:14:48,409 --> 01:14:52,402
i got the ball...
i got it.

777
01:14:53,849 --> 01:14:57,808
Hold this stuff,
i gotta turn this contest around.

778
01:14:57,969 --> 01:15:01,166
I got the ball, jim.
I got a chance, babe.

779
01:15:01,329 --> 01:15:04,878
- More salt!
- Please god...

780
01:15:05,049 --> 01:15:12,239
...no one seemed to hit him, and yet,
the ball squirted, just like magic...

781
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:16,368
black magic, more like it, danny...

782
01:15:18,929 --> 01:15:20,078
pass the ball...

783
01:15:23,329 --> 01:15:27,083
is there a black cat in the house?
How about a ladder?

784
01:15:31,289 --> 01:15:33,439
What the hell are you trying to do?

785
01:16:01,009 --> 01:16:02,408
Duck!

786
01:16:08,009 --> 01:16:12,400
Touchdown!
I don't believe it!

787
01:16:16,849 --> 01:16:19,522
I made it!

788
01:17:01,009 --> 01:17:03,079
You got the money, russo?

789
01:17:03,249 --> 01:17:06,002
Or should i say "senator russo"?

790
01:17:11,409 --> 01:17:16,164
Mr tucker, i gotta tell you,
i'm a little bit nervous about...

791
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:21,198
about what i'm supposed to do. What sort
of policies are you guys trying to push?

792
01:17:21,369 --> 01:17:26,921
The party shares the concern of the
american taxpayer, the working man.

793
01:17:27,089 --> 01:17:32,721
Here's the new freeway we're announcing.
My son-in-law got that contract.

794
01:17:32,889 --> 01:17:34,880
Fine boy!

795
01:17:35,049 --> 01:17:37,483
We're also in favour of public facilities.

796
01:17:37,649 --> 01:17:41,722
We're going to tear down
that old hospital on the east side -

797
01:17:41,889 --> 01:17:43,800
- and put in a nice golf course.

798
01:17:43,969 --> 01:17:48,599
Chairman caldwell really likes to play
golf. Wins every tournament he plays in.

799
01:17:48,769 --> 01:17:53,160
He's got a 48 handicap, fine golfer.
And we're in favour of lowering taxes.

800
01:17:53,329 --> 01:17:56,446
Didn't you use to work there?

801
01:17:57,889 --> 01:17:59,800
Closed?

802
01:17:59,969 --> 01:18:02,199
The party's
looking out for the consumer.

803
01:18:02,369 --> 01:18:07,238
Last night, the proprietor made a
false claim on a television commercial.

804
01:18:07,409 --> 01:18:09,923
One of our constituents
brought it to our attention.

805
01:18:10,089 --> 01:18:15,004
The case goes before a judge in about
five minutes. Justice can be swift.

806
01:18:15,169 --> 01:18:18,764
What the hell do you mean
you got hanging judge harrison?

807
01:18:18,929 --> 01:18:21,079
He's not on our take, he's legit!

808
01:18:21,249 --> 01:18:26,039
Remember that coloured kid
found guilty for stealing a case of beer?

809
01:18:26,209 --> 01:18:29,519
Hanging judge harrison gave him
35 years of hard labour.

810
01:18:29,689 --> 01:18:32,328
You need someone to throw
the book at this broad.

811
01:18:32,489 --> 01:18:37,483
I've paid off all the witnesses, i even
have her attorney on my payroll.

812
01:18:39,729 --> 01:18:41,720
I can win this case, roy. Trust me.

813
01:18:42,729 --> 01:18:47,166
She's a first offender. That's a
$500 fine, even if they do convict her.

814
01:18:47,329 --> 01:18:53,199
She's gonna be convicted and i'm afraid
the fine is going to be real severe.

815
01:18:53,369 --> 01:18:54,643
Jesus...

816
01:18:54,809 --> 01:18:57,277
there's only one thing she can do:
Sell that lot.

817
01:18:57,449 --> 01:19:00,247
Jesus christ!

818
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:04,123
Wait a minute, russo!

819
01:19:06,849 --> 01:19:09,602
Hold it! Wait a minute!

820
01:19:12,529 --> 01:19:15,063
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!
The honourable h.h. Harrison presiding.

821
01:19:15,064 --> 01:19:17,598
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!
The honourable h.h. Harrison presiding.

822
01:19:17,769 --> 01:19:20,363
All rise!

823
01:19:50,929 --> 01:19:53,568
This court -

824
01:19:53,729 --> 01:19:56,482
- is now in session.

825
01:19:58,209 --> 01:20:02,805
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the whole truth, so help you god?

826
01:20:13,729 --> 01:20:15,720
I do.

827
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:22,599
Excuse me...

828
01:20:22,769 --> 01:20:25,602
excuse me... pardon me... sorry.

829
01:20:25,769 --> 01:20:30,399
Mr slaton?
Will you commence the questioning?

830
01:20:32,009 --> 01:20:34,318
Please state your name and occupation.

831
01:20:36,049 --> 01:20:40,839
Barbara jane fuchs. I'm the owner
of the new deal car lot.

832
01:20:41,009 --> 01:20:46,959
We have heard testimony
from four qualified experts, -

833
01:20:47,129 --> 01:20:51,486
- right here in this courtroom, to the
fact that the commercial in question -

834
01:20:51,649 --> 01:20:57,884
- was authorised by you
and was not tampered with in any way.

835
01:20:58,049 --> 01:21:02,884
I put it to you, miss fuchs: Do you
have a mile of cars to sell on your lot?

836
01:21:05,689 --> 01:21:07,520
Yes! Lie!

837
01:21:11,089 --> 01:21:13,284
Could you repeat the question, please?

838
01:21:16,049 --> 01:21:19,678
Do you have a mile of cars
for sale on your lot?

839
01:21:19,849 --> 01:21:24,286
When placed end to end, will the cars
on your lot total one mile in length, -

840
01:21:24,449 --> 01:21:28,237
- and may i remind you
you are under oath?

841
01:21:28,409 --> 01:21:32,880
- I don't know...
- speak up, miss fuchs!

842
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:41,603
Yes.

843
01:21:48,369 --> 01:21:50,087
Order!

844
01:21:54,129 --> 01:21:57,246
Order! Order!

845
01:22:01,649 --> 01:22:03,401
Miss fuchs?

846
01:22:04,849 --> 01:22:12,642
Are you absolutely certain that you
understood the gentleman's question?

847
01:22:18,249 --> 01:22:23,607
You realise, miss fuchs,
that one mile of cars is over 250 cars?

848
01:22:23,769 --> 01:22:27,284
Are you aware that you've opened
yourself up to a charge of perjury?

849
01:22:27,449 --> 01:22:28,848
What?

850
01:22:29,009 --> 01:22:34,720
I can produce a number of witnesses who
will testify to the fact that she is lying.

851
01:22:34,889 --> 01:22:38,165
That she has, in fact,
only 25 cars on her lot at this time.

852
01:22:38,329 --> 01:22:40,843
Why don't see for yourself, judge?

853
01:22:42,049 --> 01:22:44,609
Order!

854
01:22:46,369 --> 01:22:50,647
- I have no objection to that.
- Neither do i.

855
01:22:50,809 --> 01:22:54,768
Miss fuchs, i'm gonna release you
on your own recognizance.

856
01:22:54,929 --> 01:23:00,720
Court will reconvene at 2.45 p.m.
At the new deal used car lot, -

857
01:23:00,889 --> 01:23:06,759
- where i am going to
settle this matter once and for all.

858
01:23:16,849 --> 01:23:21,684
250 keys, 250 titles, 250 cars.

859
01:23:21,849 --> 01:23:27,446
But you've brought no transport trucks.
How are you gonna get them home?

860
01:23:27,609 --> 01:23:31,045
I have 250 drivers.

861
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:47,678
What have i done to the children?

862
01:23:49,729 --> 01:23:55,008
- You want that one too?
- All of them, everything you got.

863
01:23:55,169 --> 01:23:57,683
How about some marijuana? Some rifles?

864
01:23:57,849 --> 01:24:01,842
- Anything that doesn't start, we'll tow.
- Listen, take him up on the reefer.

865
01:24:06,049 --> 01:24:07,960
This had better work!

866
01:24:08,129 --> 01:24:12,759
You told me that your students
needed some road experience, right?

867
01:24:12,929 --> 01:24:15,045
They're gonna get a crash course.

868
01:24:15,209 --> 01:24:17,928
Hey, you, amigo!

869
01:24:19,129 --> 01:24:23,566
How about some rifles for your students?
Chico! Bring some rifles!

870
01:24:23,729 --> 01:24:28,723
Take your hands off me, sir!
I don't believe in violence!

871
01:24:30,249 --> 01:24:32,604
Forget about the rifles...

872
01:24:32,769 --> 01:24:34,964
i think she skipped town.

873
01:24:35,129 --> 01:24:39,805
Good! I'll win the damn thing
on a default. This calls for a toast...

874
01:24:39,969 --> 01:24:44,679
to the man who in two hours will be
the biggest car dealer in the southwest.

875
01:24:44,849 --> 01:24:49,843
Me. Roy I. Fuchs.
Straighten that out, carmine.

876
01:24:50,009 --> 01:24:53,001
Drivers! To your cars!

877
01:25:02,209 --> 01:25:04,803
Jeff, do you read me?

878
01:25:04,969 --> 01:25:09,167
I just finished measuring these.
If we throw in the 26 cars on the lot, -

879
01:25:09,329 --> 01:25:13,447
- that gives us 18 feet
safety margin. That's one car.

880
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:17,887
- That's playing it pretty close.
- Are we going to make it in two hours?

881
01:25:22,169 --> 01:25:25,047
You girls ready for some
heavy duty driving?

882
01:25:25,209 --> 01:25:30,727
Let's see, left hand at 10 o'clock
and right hand at 2 o'clock.

883
01:25:30,889 --> 01:25:32,083
Jeff, do you read?

884
01:25:33,809 --> 01:25:39,441
Yeah, you got your own "back door man",
i'll be bringing it up to your rear...

885
01:25:39,609 --> 01:25:42,567
will you watch
where the hell you're standing!

886
01:25:42,729 --> 01:25:45,243
You gotta find yourself
another car, nigger!

887
01:25:45,409 --> 01:25:50,722
This is the only cadillac here and i don't
drive in nothin' but a cadillac.

888
01:25:50,889 --> 01:25:54,848
We're towing a car!
Have you ever towed a car before?

889
01:25:55,009 --> 01:25:56,601
- No.
- Oh great!

890
01:25:56,769 --> 01:26:00,364
Drivers! Start your engines!

891
01:26:10,369 --> 01:26:14,840
I'm gonna have to take one hand
off the wheel to start the car...

892
01:26:15,009 --> 01:26:18,524
you're not gonna
flunk me for that, are you?

893
01:26:18,689 --> 01:26:20,680
Just start the car.

894
01:26:23,089 --> 01:26:26,479
- You ready?
- Let's go.

895
01:26:27,489 --> 01:26:29,923
Let's move 'em out!

896
01:28:03,849 --> 01:28:06,204
Come on, baby, let's go!

897
01:28:06,369 --> 01:28:10,123
- How fast are we going?
- Fifty-five.

898
01:28:10,329 --> 01:28:14,641
At this rate, i think we're
going to be about half an hour late.

899
01:28:14,809 --> 01:28:19,200
Everybody listen up! We're gonna have
a lesson in driving history!

900
01:28:19,369 --> 01:28:24,159
This is how we used to drive
on the highways: At seventy-five mph!

901
01:28:24,329 --> 01:28:28,607
- Everybody seventy-five mph!
- Seventy-five!

902
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,205
Put that pedal on the floor!

903
01:28:55,009 --> 01:28:57,762
I've got this motherfucker wide open!

904
01:29:03,809 --> 01:29:08,485
This dude ain't no driving teacher,
he's some kind of con man.

905
01:29:08,649 --> 01:29:14,201
That's 20 miles over the speed limit.
At $10 a mile, that's a $200 fine.

906
01:29:14,369 --> 01:29:17,600
They can't fine us,
we don't have our license yet.

907
01:29:24,729 --> 01:29:26,720
It's the police! Stop!

908
01:29:31,889 --> 01:29:34,722
Oh shit! Wait...

909
01:29:36,249 --> 01:29:40,879
"at the scene of an accident,
always wait for the police to arrive."

910
01:29:41,049 --> 01:29:44,246
- This is eleven forty-four...
- they're here.

911
01:29:46,689 --> 01:29:49,999
Rudy, we just lost
our one-car safety margin, pal.

912
01:29:50,169 --> 01:29:54,401
You'd better scout ahead for more cops.
We can't take any more chances.

913
01:29:54,569 --> 01:29:57,003
Okay, ten-four.

914
01:30:17,489 --> 01:30:21,687
- How much do you owe me now, carmine?
- Twenty-seven.

915
01:30:24,289 --> 01:30:26,803
Look at that...

916
01:30:26,969 --> 01:30:30,484
i just heard some crazy shit
on my police scanner.

917
01:30:30,649 --> 01:30:35,165
There's a whole shitload of used cars
headed this way. You care about that?

918
01:30:47,009 --> 01:30:49,000
Shit!

919
01:30:54,209 --> 01:30:59,124
Rudy, i hope you read me
'cause we got a real big problem.

920
01:31:00,449 --> 01:31:03,725
- What is it?
- Police roadblock.

921
01:31:03,889 --> 01:31:08,838
- What the hell are you gonna do?
- We're going to take a short cut.

922
01:31:41,969 --> 01:31:43,846
What are you... oh, hi, roy.

923
01:31:44,009 --> 01:31:46,921
Did you see about
250 cars go by here?

924
01:31:47,089 --> 01:31:49,398
No, we haven't seen 'em yet.

925
01:31:49,569 --> 01:31:54,324
- Where the hell are they?
- Who cares? They'll never make it.

926
01:31:54,489 --> 01:31:58,926
Yeah, the only way they can get there
on time is to drive as the crow flies.

927
01:31:59,089 --> 01:32:02,445
- I wouldn't worry about it.
- What did you say?

928
01:32:02,609 --> 01:32:05,726
Never mind!
Back up there and take a left!

929
01:32:40,569 --> 01:32:42,764
You pea-brained ignoramus!

930
01:32:47,809 --> 01:32:50,687
What a beautiful day.

931
01:32:50,849 --> 01:32:56,321
Two thirty... whose idea was it,
going out to this used car lot?

932
01:32:56,489 --> 01:32:59,447
I could have been out playing golf.

933
01:33:07,969 --> 01:33:11,928
There they are!
Head for the lead truck!

934
01:33:16,249 --> 01:33:19,241
Hey, rudy, looks like we got company.

935
01:33:19,409 --> 01:33:22,765
Fuchs! What the hell is this?

936
01:33:26,209 --> 01:33:30,088
Get out and get in the back!
Get in the damn back!

937
01:33:30,249 --> 01:33:32,319
You're crazy!

938
01:33:32,489 --> 01:33:36,323
Don't give me no goddam lip!
Get in the goddam back now!

939
01:33:39,929 --> 01:33:42,079
What the hell is he doing?

940
01:33:46,449 --> 01:33:50,124
Hey, rudy!
You want me to ram the son of a bitch?

941
01:33:50,289 --> 01:33:53,520
No! Keep going!
We're running out of time!

942
01:33:59,689 --> 01:34:02,647
Pull over closer!
Pull in behind them!

943
01:34:06,649 --> 01:34:08,685
Pull in behind them!

944
01:34:08,849 --> 01:34:13,081
Keep it going! Don't stop for anything!

945
01:34:17,249 --> 01:34:18,443
He's got a gun!

946
01:34:18,609 --> 01:34:21,760
- Shoot the son of a bitch!
- You motherfucker, you!

947
01:34:25,689 --> 01:34:28,442
- Pull over!
- Get off of there!

948
01:34:30,409 --> 01:34:32,081
You motherfucker!

949
01:34:44,689 --> 01:34:46,919
Keep going!

950
01:34:52,569 --> 01:34:55,959
Slow down...
i want you bad, you fat-ass!

951
01:34:56,129 --> 01:35:01,249
I want you, man! I want you!
I gotta have you! I'm gonna get you!

952
01:35:19,849 --> 01:35:24,365
- Heavy duty, brother!
- Follow the black car!

953
01:35:27,249 --> 01:35:29,240
Thanks for dropping in!

954
01:35:36,969 --> 01:35:38,846
Get away from me!

955
01:35:49,729 --> 01:35:52,163
Stop that truck!

956
01:36:07,769 --> 01:36:12,445
What am i supposed to do when someone's
standing on the hood of my car?

957
01:36:12,609 --> 01:36:15,203
Close in! Faster!

958
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:17,803
Move it up closer!

959
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:31,244
Let go of him!

960
01:36:40,849 --> 01:36:43,283
You all right?

961
01:36:46,209 --> 01:36:48,962
Billingham, let's move this chariot.

962
01:36:49,129 --> 01:36:52,883
I still may be able
to get in eight holes.

963
01:37:07,369 --> 01:37:11,840
What the hell is this now?
A mirror truck?

964
01:37:12,009 --> 01:37:14,204
I hope none of them's cracked...

965
01:37:58,329 --> 01:38:00,889
let's go! That's it!

966
01:38:09,649 --> 01:38:15,167
That's it!
We made it! Nice job!

967
01:38:17,449 --> 01:38:19,599
That was some pretty heavy driving!

968
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:23,284
- We missed page 35!
- We're here, aren't we?

969
01:38:23,449 --> 01:38:28,045
- This motherfucker's all right.
- This car is bad, i tell you, man!

970
01:38:28,209 --> 01:38:31,121
Well, did i pass the test, mr ghertner?

971
01:38:31,289 --> 01:38:36,443
Yes, as long as you promise
to get your license in another state.

972
01:38:42,129 --> 01:38:46,202
I think we got plenty of time.
Look who's coming!

973
01:38:52,489 --> 01:38:54,081
We made it!

974
01:38:54,249 --> 01:39:01,519
I know you're seeing the same thing with
those itty-bitty beady eyes of yours.

975
01:39:01,689 --> 01:39:05,079
I tell ya, that sure looks
like a mile of cars to me.

976
01:39:05,249 --> 01:39:11,006
Let's just make sure, your honour.
Measure them! Every one of them!

977
01:39:11,169 --> 01:39:13,922
No, sir! That's it!

978
01:39:14,089 --> 01:39:19,482
I mean, that's a red car...
i'm sorry, i tried...

979
01:39:22,329 --> 01:39:27,323
no, no, no, it's a red car.

980
01:39:27,489 --> 01:39:31,004
If jeff don't get here,
we're going to be 18 feet short.

981
01:39:31,169 --> 01:39:32,841
Dammit...

982
01:39:34,889 --> 01:39:37,528
jeff, come in!

983
01:39:37,689 --> 01:39:41,398
Jeff, come in! Are you there?

984
01:39:45,609 --> 01:39:47,679
Come in! Are you there?

985
01:39:47,849 --> 01:39:50,443
Are you there?

986
01:39:52,009 --> 01:39:54,728
- Jeff, come in, please!
- Where is he?

987
01:39:54,889 --> 01:39:59,280
- Yeah, rudy, i'm here.
- Where's here?

988
01:39:59,449 --> 01:40:04,762
I'm parked near the railroad crossing
on valley road, near highway 9.

989
01:40:04,929 --> 01:40:08,922
Get over here! We're in a hurry!
Without your car we're 18 feet short!

990
01:40:09,089 --> 01:40:11,523
Can't they measure them any faster?

991
01:40:11,689 --> 01:40:15,238
What do you expect me to do?
Put roller skates on them boys?

992
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:20,085
The paint washed off, rudy,
and there's red paint underneath, -

993
01:40:20,249 --> 01:40:23,559
- you see, i can't drive it,
it's a red car!

994
01:40:23,729 --> 01:40:29,042
Jeff, you've been driving it all day.
It's all in your mind, you can do it...

995
01:40:30,849 --> 01:40:35,684
- which side of the tracks are you on?
- East.

996
01:40:35,849 --> 01:40:40,286
He's on the wrong side. The 2.45
is coming through. You've got to do it!

997
01:40:40,449 --> 01:40:42,644
- I can't do it.
- Red cars don't mean shit!

998
01:40:42,809 --> 01:40:46,279
I'm sorry... listen to me...

999
01:40:46,449 --> 01:40:52,604
there's grey primer underneath that red
paint, you're really driving a grey car.

1000
01:40:52,769 --> 01:40:59,368
Please, jeff,
if you don't get here, we lose the lot.

1001
01:41:00,969 --> 01:41:05,121
- Fourteen seven!
- Seventeen feet, nine inches.

1002
01:41:09,289 --> 01:41:11,883
What do you think, toby?

1003
01:41:14,369 --> 01:41:19,238
Shit! Wouldn't you know it?
For once the train's on time.

1004
01:41:19,409 --> 01:41:23,402
- Seventeen six.
- Eighteen feet, four inches.

1005
01:41:33,409 --> 01:41:37,561
- Seventeen feet, nine inches.
- Fourteen four.

1006
01:41:57,529 --> 01:41:59,997
Come on!

1007
01:42:09,889 --> 01:42:12,323
Eighteen feet, four inches.

1008
01:42:12,489 --> 01:42:16,164
Is that the last car?
What's the final total?

1009
01:42:16,329 --> 01:42:19,446
Come on! One of these...

1010
01:42:34,569 --> 01:42:38,687
well, it'd better be a grey car...

1011
01:43:10,889 --> 01:43:13,278
you cheated! You cheated!

1012
01:43:13,449 --> 01:43:15,440
You cheated, you bastards!

1013
01:43:15,609 --> 01:43:19,966
Easy, roy, they're on
the last car and they're short.

1014
01:43:21,289 --> 01:43:28,206
Five thousand two hundred and sixty-two
and... eighteen will make a mile...

1015
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:32,965
here it is, right there!
You're eighteen feet short.

1016
01:43:40,209 --> 01:43:43,121
Take it from the bumper!

1017
01:43:47,529 --> 01:43:50,919
Ah... you're two inches short.

1018
01:43:53,569 --> 01:44:00,122
5280 feet, a mile of cars!
Case dismissed!

1019
01:44:04,969 --> 01:44:09,838
Wait a minute! Somebody pay you off?
A license plate don't count!

1020
01:44:10,009 --> 01:44:14,366
Come on, buddy! We won!

1021
01:44:16,529 --> 01:44:18,042
Don't give me that shit!

1022
01:44:18,209 --> 01:44:23,886
For uttering those contemptuous remarks,
i'm gonna put your balls in a sling.

1023
01:44:24,049 --> 01:44:26,768
Deputies! Let's haul ass!

1024
01:44:29,049 --> 01:44:31,643
Come on, buddy, come on...

1025
01:44:36,009 --> 01:44:37,920
well, partner...

1026
01:44:38,089 --> 01:44:42,002
that was terrific,
what you did here today.

1027
01:44:42,169 --> 01:44:47,289
With that new freeway ramp, you're gonna
have the best freeway access in the state.

1028
01:44:47,449 --> 01:44:50,885
You can have the biggest dealership
in the southwest.

1029
01:44:51,049 --> 01:44:53,244
I know we've had our differences, -

1030
01:44:53,409 --> 01:44:57,368
- but if you ever need a friend,
you've got one downtown.

1031
01:44:57,529 --> 01:45:00,327
Thanks, sam, thanks a million.

1032
01:45:00,489 --> 01:45:02,445
Well... partners.

1033
01:45:02,609 --> 01:45:06,204
Don't partner me! You knew about
that freeway the whole time.

1034
01:45:06,369 --> 01:45:10,157
I didn't know anything,
this is the first i've heard of it.

1035
01:45:10,329 --> 01:45:14,925
- Rudy, are you sure?
- Trust me.

1036
01:45:15,089 --> 01:45:18,559
- Excuse me, miss...
- ma'am?

1037
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:23,280
What's that yellow paint doing
on that car? Did it use to be a taxi?

1038
01:45:23,449 --> 01:45:27,806
- That car there?
- Yes, that car there.

1039
01:45:34,929 --> 01:45:38,763
- No, ma'am, that's yellow primer.
- Yellow primer?

1040
01:45:38,929 --> 01:45:42,205
Yes, that's being used
on a lot of cars these days.

1041
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:46,601
It's a rust preventative,
it adds life to the body...
