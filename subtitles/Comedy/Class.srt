Nice. Real nice.

Every year, the seniors have to parade
around wearing women's underwear.

53

lt's supposed to teach us humility. The
seniors give the squits shit all year long,

and this is their one chance
to laugh at us.

You did it!

156
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:12,021
l'm astounded by your brilliance
and the magnitude of your gall.

157
00:13:12,145 --> 00:13:14,295
Yeah, so am I.

158
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:23,620
This is something I've never told anyone,

159
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:27,533
so you've gotta swear to me
what you hear will not leave this room.

160
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:30,054
Swear to God.

161
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,221
- OK.
- Swear to God!

162
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:34,583
OK.

163
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:40,735
I killed a guy.

164
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:42,264
Yeah? (laughs)

165
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,899
- I mean it, Jonathon.
- Me, too.

166
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:50,661
Last year, uh, I was in Montego Bay
with some friends.

167
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:54,424
And we were all in this bar.

168
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:57,537
And I met this gorgeous girl.
She takes me back to her place,

169
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:00,054
and then some huge guy
had a gun to my head.

170
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:02,979
And my gorgeous gal,
she's going through my pockets.

171
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:05,744
I must've been drunk,
cos I kicked the guy in the balls.

172
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:10,814
And I went for the gun, and then the next
thing I know, there's this huge explosion.

173
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:12,901
And, uh...

174
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:19,463
the guy was... lyin' on the ground

175
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:22,338
with blood pourin' out
of a hole in his head.

176
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:30,898
- lt was horrible.
- Jesus.

177
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:36,383
God.

178
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:41,857
- What'd you do?
- What do you think? I got the hell out.

179
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,538
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

180
00:14:51,785 --> 00:14:54,618
- I cheated on my SAT.
- I can smell bullshit a mile away.

181
00:14:54,745 --> 00:15:00,138
Hey! lt cost me 1 50 bucks. I bought
the test. I had every answer goin' in.

182
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:05,859
You cheated on the SAT?
You cheated on the SAT?!

183
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:07,338
Yeah.

184
00:15:08,065 --> 00:15:11,819
Christ, I love that! You're the smartest
fuckin' guy in the whole school.

185
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:15,461
Mr Scholarship. I mean,
even Roger did OK on the SAT.

186
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:20,017
lt just so happens my whole life
depends on my getting into Harvard.

187
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:22,500
You really cheated on the SAT!

188
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,575
lt's pretty serious.

189
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:29,781
Hey, you killed a guy.

190
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:34,780
Well... not exactly.

191
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:39,778
What do you mean, ''not exactly''?

192
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,463
Huh?

193
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:49,981
That son of a bitch
got away with everything I had.

194
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:53,063
You know, I was so scared
that I shit my pants.

195
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:06,854
What an asshole.

196
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:09,863
Oh, no, Kafka's
symbolism here is obvious.

197
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:12,658
The apple represents original sin. Yeah.

198
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:16,824
lt sticks in his side like Christ's wound
and eventually festers and destroys him.

199
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:21,382
No, no, no. What he's really saying
is we're all cockroaches.

200
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:23,894
- Later.
- Hey, guess what you're doin' tonight.

201
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,697
- Latin.
- Wrong.

202
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:29,977
You've got a date with the
second-prettiest girl in Foxfield.

203
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:32,941
- You didn't.
- Oh, I did. I did.

204
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:36,501
- I am not gonna be able to do this.
- We are not gonna get caught.

205
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,776
l'm not talkin' about that.
l'm talkin' about the girls.

206
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:44,137
- I've never done it before.
- You've never done that before?

207
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:49,103
Sure, I've done it. God! Lots of times.

208
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:52,615
I mean, you know,
not all the way every time, but...

209
00:16:53,905 --> 00:16:55,861
I feel sick.

210
00:16:56,905 --> 00:17:00,215
You've got nothin' to worry about.
These are very nice girls.

211
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:02,700
I might not even get laid tonight.

212
00:17:05,145 --> 00:17:08,501
Although that's highly unlikely.
Turn off the light.

213
00:17:09,665 --> 00:17:13,624
We're gonna get caught. You know
what they're gonna do if they catch us?

214
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:17,863
Sure. But it doesn't hold a candle
to what the girls are gonna do.

215
00:17:17,985 --> 00:17:18,656
Oh, God.

216
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,857
(watch bleeps)

217
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:27,015
Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!

218
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:29,295
(distant) Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!

219
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:32,658
Hoo-hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo!

220
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:37,895
- (distant) Hoo-hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Oh, I don't believe this.

221
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:41,222
- (giggles)
- Don't worry.

222
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:44,020
Here they are. Right on time.

223
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:48,335
- Hey.
- (both) Hi!

224
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,943
(# "Stand in the Shadows" by Line One)

225
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:56,774
They want to work, it's just
we haven't given them the opportunities.

226
00:17:56,905 --> 00:17:59,738
Poor people are just like you and me,
except with no money.

227
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:03,221
They have so many kids,
they can't get out from under.

228
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:06,621
We've been educated.
We use birth control.

229
00:18:06,745 --> 00:18:10,784
Nobody gives a damn. Their situation
will never change until we do something.

230
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:11,655
(grunts)

231
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:14,618
- You don't agree?
- No. No, l, uh...

232
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:20,215
(Skip) Jesus! Jesus!

233
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:23,940
Jesus Christ, Jonathon,
I don't believe it! Oh, God!

234
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:27,023
lt's the grossest thing I ever saw!
lt's on my skirt!

235
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:45,539
You know, deep down inside,
I really think they liked me.

236
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:51,783
Jonathon!

237
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:57,055
- Guess what I just did for you.
- I don't wanna know.

238
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,141
Welcome aboard, Mr Secretary.

239
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:04,141
Secretary of the Dance Committee is
bullshit. lt's an excuse to get outta class.

240
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:08,378
That's only one of its positive aspects.
The best part is there's five of us,

241
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:10,621
and 479 of them.

242
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:13,261
Let's get 'em.

243
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:29,336
- Oh-ho, look at the chest on her.
- (French accent) Oh, the little girls.

244
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:31,503
- Chicks.
- Love 'em.

245
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,183
Whoo!

246
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:39,141
- Hi. Welcome to Foxfield.
- Love the fat girl! Ooh, the big fat one.

247
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:44,936
This is the way we think it should go.
Just before the last dance,

248
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:49,024
our Mrs DeBreul and your Mr Kennedy
will present the prize for best costume.

249
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:52,774
- Can we just say something?
- We think this costume thing is childish.

250
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:55,373
What?! But it's a Halloween dance!

251
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:58,178
There are more important things
than Halloween.

252
00:19:58,305 --> 00:20:00,455
There are people starving!

253
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:03,657
Lisa, why don't you offer
our guests some sandwiches?

254
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:07,221
A Halloween dance without any costumes
is like every other dance!

255
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:11,657
I think any dance is inappropriate
considering the condition of the world.

256
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:15,698
I am so tired of you two and your
pseudo-intellectual liberal crap!

257
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:18,464
- Julia!
- Your cotton-candy ideas make me sick!

258
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,415
- Lisa!
- Hi.

259
00:20:19,545 --> 00:20:21,297
Oh, no!

260
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:22,335
(Jonathon) Agh!

261
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:24,183
- Lisa!
- I'm sorry.

262
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:26,216
Stay away from me! Oh, fuck!

263
00:20:26,345 --> 00:20:28,700
- Lisa!
- Oh, fuck!

264
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:30,224
You peon!

265
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:36,376
Oh! Oh!

266
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:47,061
Let's leave it up to the individual
as to whether he or she wears a costume.

267
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:50,219
What do you think, Jonathon?

268
00:20:50,345 --> 00:20:52,734
l'm terribly sorry, Mrs DeBreul.

269
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:56,175
Yes, it was most unfortunate.

270
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,819
The vase was a gift
from Eleanor Roosevelt?

271
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:04,699
lrreplaceable. No, I don't think
that's being too extreme, not at all.

272
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:09,182
As a matter of fact, I think
you're being quite generous. Goodbye.

273
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,861
Well, Mr Burroughs,
you and your dance committee

274
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:20,819
have really made an indelible
impression on our sister school.

275
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:23,421
And especially you, Mr Ogner.

276
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:27,221
Not only are you forbidden
to attend the Halloween dance,

277
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:30,940
but you are the first student
in the history of Vernon Academy

278
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:37,300
ever to be banned from Foxfield until,
and I quote, ''the day you die''.

279
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:39,575
On your way, gentlemen.

280
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:49,336
The white zone is for unloading...

281
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:51,820
Banished from Foxfield for ever!

282
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:55,658
The only females within 100 miles.

283
00:21:56,785 --> 00:22:00,937
- Guess you're gonna die a virgin, buddy!
- Give me some of that.

284
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,460
- Here you go, pal, Mr Alligator.
- You wanna buy a shirt?

285
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,735
(brass chorale music )

286
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,183
Ta-da!

287
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:18,420
You look troubled, my son.

288
00:22:28,745 --> 00:22:33,819
Worriest thou not about being banished
for ever from the Foxfield school for girls,

289
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:37,415
for yea, though they are
the only females within 100 miles,

290
00:22:37,545 --> 00:22:40,457
there is still a place
where thou canst journey to.

291
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:42,576
Chicago, on the nine o'clock bus.

292
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:45,585
- Forget it.
- Desperate circumstances

293
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:49,220
require desperate measures.
Sexually, you're finished around here.

294
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:52,223
- Must you rub it in?
- Look, take this ticket.

295
00:22:52,345 --> 00:22:56,861
Go to Rush Street, the Free N Easy Club.
And you will meet the girl of your dreams.

296
00:22:56,985 --> 00:23:01,536
lf she ain't there, take what you can get.
Grab a cab, take her to Grey's Lake lnn.

297
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:05,340
And there you will plant your seed
in the Garden of Eden.

298
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:10,055
- Here's 100 bucks.
- Forget it.

299
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:13,495
Jonathon! Until you get laid,
none of us are safe!

300
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:19,540
And whatever you do, Jesus,
don't tell her you're in high school.

301
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,940
- Tell her you're a longshoreman.
- What?

302
00:23:22,065 --> 00:23:25,978
- Say you're a theatre critic for the Times.
- Yeah. That's better.

303
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:29,734
You're going. I don't want to see
your ass back here until you succeed.

304
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:33,653
ln fact, I'm not gonna let you in the room
until you bring me... her panties.

305
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:35,980
Oh, come on. Look, Skip, I'm not like you.

306
00:23:36,105 --> 00:23:38,938
I don't have your charm,
your finesse, your, uh...

307
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:42,137
- Class.
- Whatever. I'm no good with women.

308
00:23:42,745 --> 00:23:46,181
I know that, you know that. The broads
that go to the Free N Easy don't.

309
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:49,661
Look, Jonathon, you're a great guy.

310
00:23:50,065 --> 00:23:54,343
You've got a lot going for you.
Hey, I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it.

311
00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:57,582
Well, I might say it if I didn't mean it,
but probably not to you.

312
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,661
Come on, let's go!

313
00:24:00,825 --> 00:24:02,781
(chicken noises)

314
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:05,740
l'd lend you some money,
but I'm a little short.

315
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:09,540
Get this one for the Gipper.
Come on, you guys, let's go!

316
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:14,502
- Bless you.
- Yeah, bless you.

317
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:18,300
To the Promised Land, my son.
To the Promised Land.

318
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:25,424
Hey, Jesus, I got a great deal
on some alligator shoes, buddy.

319
00:25:23,785 --> 00:25:26,743
(# "Hiding From Love" by Bryan Adams)

320
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:34,022
# You can't deny it,
you're only hiding from love

321
00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:40,343
Bartender!

322
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:42,623
Sir!

323
00:25:43,145 --> 00:25:47,297
# You say you're shy,
but you're only hiding from love

324
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:09,016
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

325
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:14,502
# You're not deciding,
you're only hiding from love

326
00:26:17,145 --> 00:26:20,296
Hi. My name is Jonathon. What's yours?

327
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,459
Mind if I join you?
So, do you live around here?

328
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:34,503
# You say that you're shy,
but you're only hiding from love

329
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:41,655
Maybe another time.

330
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:49,897
Oh, man!

331
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,540
- Bartender!
- Hold your horses! Be right with you.

332
00:27:00,225 --> 00:27:01,340
- Go!
- Go!

333
00:27:01,465 --> 00:27:04,935
One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six...

334
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:08,094
- Oh, man!
- How did I do?

335
00:27:08,225 --> 00:27:11,262
- I could do better than that.
- Oh, she could do better than that!

336
00:27:11,385 --> 00:27:13,660
Ten bucks. Ten bucks. Ten bucks.

337
00:27:15,785 --> 00:27:18,538
- Hey, you're gonna lose some money!
- Ellen!

338
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:22,576
- Ready for takeoff now?
- Ready. Wait, wait, wait.

339
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:24,184
Get ready, get set, go!

340
00:27:24,305 --> 00:27:29,823
(all) One! Two! Three! Four! Five!
Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!

341
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:35,101
Pay up.

342
00:27:38,345 --> 00:27:40,301
Drinks for the losers.

343
00:27:49,945 --> 00:27:51,901
Nice little profit.

344
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:56,220
- This one's on the house.
- Thanks.

345
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:07,981
Are you here alone?

346
00:28:08,545 --> 00:28:10,820
- Huh?
- Are you here alone?

347
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:11,980
Yeah.

348
00:28:12,105 --> 00:28:15,700
You know, I get a really
good feeling from you.

349
00:28:15,825 --> 00:28:18,180
- You do?
- Mm-hm. Gimme your hand.

350
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:24,096
You got a very exciting aura.

351
00:28:24,945 --> 00:28:26,981
I bet you hear that all the time.

352
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,460
Well... now and again.

353
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:32,053
- Let me test it.
- What?

354
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:35,461
Your aura. Take this quarter.
Close your eyes.

355
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:40,415
See if you can run the quarter
from your forehead to your chin,

356
00:28:40,545 --> 00:28:42,058
and then from ear to ear,

357
00:28:42,185 --> 00:28:45,336
but without ever losing
contact with your skin.

358
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:48,901
- That's it?
- lt'll tell us everything we need to know.

359
00:29:07,065 --> 00:29:09,181
Can I have my...? Yes. Thanks.

360
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,820
How'd I do?

361
00:29:13,945 --> 00:29:17,142
l'm sorry. I guess the vibes
just weren't right.

362
00:29:29,905 --> 00:29:32,180
Wow. Look, you got two fours!

363
00:29:41,585 --> 00:29:43,655
Excuse me.

364
00:29:45,665 --> 00:29:48,498
- Could I... show you something?
- Sure.

365
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,741
Oh, God!

366
00:29:57,865 --> 00:30:01,619
- Why am I such a turd?
- lt could happen to anyone here.

367
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:06,783
- Vodka tonic, please.
- Only a dick would fall for that.

368
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,021
Well, you might be right.

369
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,901
Yeah, I should...

370
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:21,177
Uh... thanks.

371
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:24,863
lf you'll excuse me...

372
00:30:24,985 --> 00:30:29,581
l'm gonna find a very tall building
with a fabulous view, and jump off.

373
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:38,540
Trailways bus terminal, please.

374
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:46,935
I know just the tall building.

375
00:30:56,345 --> 00:30:57,698
Whoo!

376
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:11,576
- Why don't you come back over here?
- Why don't you come over here?

377
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:15,778
- No, I'm... I'm comfortable right here.
- What are you afraid of?

378
00:31:16,225 --> 00:31:18,181
Uh... dying.

379
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:24,257
Uh, look, I wanna be totally honest here.
You're scarin' the hell outta me.

380
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:30,380
Hey, I just thought of somethin'. I haven't
eaten. What about you? Are you hungry?

381
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:33,895
What do you say?
I could... I could buy us dinner.

382
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:40,095
Now I am gonna jump.

383
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:43,581
- lt's only money.
- Yeah, well, it's my only money.

384
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:49,061
Have you ever...
have you ever been in love?

385
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:52,974
- Yeah, I was pretty fond of that $100 bill.
- Have you?

386
00:31:58,465 --> 00:32:00,660
You're askin' me, the turd?

387
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:04,460
Well, you look like a pretty...
sensitive turd to me.

388
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:09,782
Do you think there's
something wrong with me?

389
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:16,743
Well, how do I know?
I mean, I don't know you.

390
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,581
We can fix that.

391
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:27,535
Yeah, are you hungry? Cos I am
pretty hungry. You could buy us dinner.

392
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:29,815
OK, so what do you wanna eat?

393
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:32,979
Um...

394
00:32:33,105 --> 00:32:35,335
do you like ltalian?

395
00:32:35,465 --> 00:32:36,215
Uh...

396
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:37,903
Chinese?

397
00:32:57,305 --> 00:32:58,658
Uh...

398
00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:02,224
- This is an elevator.
- Really?

399
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:04,301
I love elevators.

400
00:33:04,945 --> 00:33:07,220
I think they're just wonderful.

401
00:33:08,305 --> 00:33:11,263
I love the way they go up and down.

402
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,498
- Do you?
- Oh, yeah, I think it's great.

403
00:33:19,785 --> 00:33:21,741
Which do you prefer?

404
00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:24,981
Going up...

405
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:28,421
or going down?

406
00:33:29,145 --> 00:33:30,703
Um...

407
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:33,660
- Up is fine.
- Really?

408
00:33:35,065 --> 00:33:37,579
I think going down is much more exciting.

409
00:33:38,465 --> 00:33:41,901
Well, yeah, now that you
mention it, down is, uh...

410
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:47,020
Of course, going up... can be... a thrill.

411
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,383
lt depends.

412
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:52,696
That's what I think.

413
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:58,056
(Ellen) Wait.

414
00:33:58,185 --> 00:34:00,858
Yeah, up is... Down is...

415
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:14,854
- Wait, uh... Wait, where...? Where's the...?
- (bell rings)

416
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:17,135
No, at the back. At the back.

417
00:34:17,465 --> 00:34:19,103
Oh, yeah.

418
00:34:33,265 --> 00:34:35,415
- Oh, God!
- Oh, God, I'm so hot.

419
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:42,020
Wouldn't you prefer...
doing this... lying down?

420
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:44,295
Uh... yeah, sure. Whatever.

421
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:49,064
Or maybe... you prefer
doing it standing up.

422
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:51,137
Um...

423
00:34:51,265 --> 00:34:53,620
Um... I think I better lie down.

424
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:12,139
Look, just... just slow down.
Just slow down.

425
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:14,221
- OK.
- Kiss me.

426
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:17,981
Jonathon... Stop, my hair's stuck.

427
00:35:18,105 --> 00:35:21,302
- Oh. Sorry. OK.
- That's better. That's better.

428
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:26,341
- Oh, what's...? Wait a minute. The sheet.
- Oh. Sorry. OK.

429
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:30,419
- How are you doing?
- Oh, good! Good!

430
00:35:31,305 --> 00:35:32,260
Aren't I?

431
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:34,853
Maybe something's happened to him.

432
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:39,024
- I thought he'd be back by Friday.
- I can't keep covering for him.

433
00:35:39,145 --> 00:35:40,737
- Where is he?
- How should I know?

434
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:43,220
You sent the little douche bag
to Rush Street!

435
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:46,064
- Oh, shut up, you clone.
- Up your tube, geek.

436
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,745
- I'm telling Kennedy.
- Very honourable, Skip.

437
00:35:48,865 --> 00:35:50,856
lt's been nice knowin' ya.

438
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:53,501
Where the hell have you been?

439
00:35:59,145 --> 00:36:01,295
- (wolf-whistling)
- (cheering)

440
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:07,900
Very impressive, Mr Ogner.

441
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:11,459
- In a fucking elevator?
- That was the first time.

442
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:14,136
I can't stand it!

443
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:18,383
Oh, it was stuck... between
the 51st and 52nd floor.

444
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,900
- How old is she?
- Oh, God...

445
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:25,981
mid-thirties.

446
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:29,419
Oh, God. God!

447
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:33,618
A fucking elevator! Fucking ele... Whoa!

448
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:38,101
Now let's each of us take a moment
to look within ourselves,

449
00:36:38,225 --> 00:36:40,693
and ask for guidance...

450
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,781
and strength.

451
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:45,901
- Our heavenly Father...
- How big?

452
00:36:46,225 --> 00:36:49,297
..may you look down
on each and every one of us

453
00:36:49,425 --> 00:36:51,780
and give us the will,

454
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:55,261
the purity of mind, to follow your way.

455
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:58,536
- What's her name?
- Ellen.

456
00:36:58,665 --> 00:37:02,943
She's a fashion designer. Told her
l'm at Northwestern workin' on my PhD.

457
00:37:03,065 --> 00:37:05,704
And she bought it? And you really...?

458
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:07,144
Mm-hm.

459
00:37:07,265 --> 00:37:09,938
- Jesus! And she really...?
- Mm-hm.

460
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:12,260
- Jesus!
- Hey, you wanna be careful?

461
00:37:12,385 --> 00:37:13,784
Aw, man.

462
00:37:21,465 --> 00:37:23,421
Hey! There he is!

463
00:37:24,265 --> 00:37:26,984
- Mr Porno!
- Yeah, the Rush Street Casanova!

464
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,655
- Hey, he's a sex machine.
- The guy is an animal.

465
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:35,098
lt's Dick Man! Able to leap
long fences at a single bound!

466
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:37,455
Yes, Dick Man!

467
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:40,621
Oh, you lady-killer!

468
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:04,575
OK. See ya Monday.

469
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:07,617
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Listen to this.

470
00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:13,224
''One out of every two males experiences
impotence at least once in his late teens.''

471
00:38:13,345 --> 00:38:15,495
One out of two. Holy shit.

472
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:19,617
Well, have a swell weekend.
Give Ellen my love.

473
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:21,383
(Ellen) Oh!

474
00:38:21,505 --> 00:38:23,063
Oh!

475
00:38:53,385 --> 00:38:55,103
Oh, Jonathon.

476
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:57,181
(Jonathon) Mm.

477
00:39:23,065 --> 00:39:27,138
Let's do it again. What do you think?
Hm? What do you think?

478
00:40:42,385 --> 00:40:44,740
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hm.

479
00:40:49,985 --> 00:40:52,340
lt's called an instant margarita.

480
00:40:53,065 --> 00:40:55,340
- Ready when you are.
- Open.

481
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:02,103
Swallow.

482
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,103
Swallow!

483
00:41:05,265 --> 00:41:08,143
Do you want some water?
Do you want some water? Open.

484
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,574
- Do you want more?
- Cut it out!

485
00:41:10,705 --> 00:41:13,663
- Just tryin' to help!
- You're dealin' with an animal here.

486
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:16,219
- Oh, my.
- All right, no more Mr Nice Guy.

487
00:41:16,345 --> 00:41:18,336
- Oh, my God.
- What?

488
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:23,173
That's it! You wanna play rough?
Huh? You wanna play rough?

489
00:41:37,145 --> 00:41:39,101
I love you.

490
00:41:45,905 --> 00:41:49,261
(Jonathon) A lot of people ruin
a good thing with pressure and strings.

491
00:41:49,385 --> 00:41:51,262
They suffocate each other.

492
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:55,344
I don't want that kind of relationship.
I don't think you do, either.

493
00:41:55,465 --> 00:41:58,184
You know, Ellen, when I said I loved you,

494
00:41:59,345 --> 00:42:02,735
I didn't mean for you to get the
impression that I actually love you.

495
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:06,341
lt's a cliche one falls back on
in this situation.

496
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:11,297
What I was trying to say is,
I very much like you,

497
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:14,656
but we shouldn't exaggerate
the significance of that.

498
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:17,379
lt's... We have a good time together.

499
00:42:21,025 --> 00:42:23,698
Next weekend, why don't I come up?

500
00:42:23,825 --> 00:42:26,578
- Up?
- Yeah. To Northwestern.

501
00:42:29,665 --> 00:42:31,815
We'll stay at your place.

502
00:42:32,705 --> 00:42:34,855
My place? At Northwestern?

503
00:42:35,705 --> 00:42:40,017
Yeah, great. That's a great idea.
When do you wanna come up?

504
00:42:40,145 --> 00:42:41,976
Next weekend.

505
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:44,619
Uh, yeah, next weekend I won't be there.

506
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:46,895
l'll be, uh... I'll be in the city.

507
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,418
- Oh. Chicago?
- Yeah. No! No, New York.

508
00:42:50,545 --> 00:42:52,695
I have to attend a seminar.

509
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:57,738
Well, that's even better.
We'll have a great time.

510
00:42:58,505 --> 00:43:02,623
- In New York?
- We'll do the romantic bullshit routine.

511
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:05,942
(Jonathon) We'll have a great time.
ln New York.

512
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,143
- Wake up, limp dick!
- (groans)

513
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:20,736
Oh, rise and shine. Come on,
you're gonna be late for chapel.

514
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:23,857
- Let's go!
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

515
00:43:23,985 --> 00:43:25,384
Jesus!

516
00:43:25,505 --> 00:43:26,858
What?

517
00:43:26,985 --> 00:43:28,941
You look horrible.

518
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:33,135
Oh, I don't believe it.

519
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:35,301
What now?

520
00:43:35,425 --> 00:43:37,541
New York.

521
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:39,656
I told her I'd meet her in New York.

522
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:44,063
ln New York? Jesus, you're...
What, do you love this chick? Huh?

523
00:43:45,065 --> 00:43:49,024
Does she know you love her?
No, really, does she know you love her?

524
00:43:49,145 --> 00:43:52,137
Does she know you've gone
completely off the deep end?

525
00:43:52,265 --> 00:43:55,462
All's I know is, I gotta find
a seminar in New York.

526
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,741
What are we doing?

527
00:44:46,385 --> 00:44:50,424
- Getting rid of that eyesore.
- I happen to like this eyesore.

528
00:44:52,305 --> 00:44:53,533
(salesman clears throat)

529
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:57,704
- May I help you?
- Could we try this jacket in his size?

530
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:00,260
39 regular?

531
00:45:00,385 --> 00:45:04,856
We're not getting rid of it entirely,
we're just giving it a much-needed rest.

532
00:45:05,465 --> 00:45:07,501
- Sir?
- Uh-huh.

533
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:09,581
- Ma'am.
- OK.

534
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:13,181
All right.

535
00:45:15,185 --> 00:45:17,141
(salesman) Very nice.

536
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:21,581
- What do you think?
- Very distinguished.

537
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,734
- Now slacks.
- Mm-hm. May I suggest, uh...

538
00:45:24,865 --> 00:45:27,504
Grey flannel.

539
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:28,899
31 .

540
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:30,856
Uh, 30.

541
00:45:30,985 --> 00:45:36,855
- What are you saying about my trousers?
- They speak for themselves.

542
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:39,545
Sir, you'll find the dressing room
right over there.

543
00:45:39,665 --> 00:45:41,656
Thank you.

544
00:46:16,265 --> 00:46:17,823
Ellen?

545
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,301
Shit. Shit!

546
00:46:23,425 --> 00:46:24,744
- Sir. Sir!
- (alarm)

547
00:46:28,665 --> 00:46:30,383
Ellen! Ellen!

548
00:46:30,505 --> 00:46:34,544
- Where do you think you're going?
- I have to catch her! Ellen!

549
00:46:38,905 --> 00:46:40,418
Come on.

550
00:46:40,545 --> 00:46:42,501
Come on.

551
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:54,703
(horn)

552
00:47:02,345 --> 00:47:04,301
Hiya, tiger.

553
00:47:10,145 --> 00:47:12,261
What am I gonna do?

554
00:47:12,385 --> 00:47:17,140
I don't know her number. I don't know her
address. I don't even know her last name.

555
00:47:17,265 --> 00:47:19,415
Knew her pretty well, did you?

556
00:47:22,185 --> 00:47:27,498
l'm sorry. Look, she was bound
to find out about it sooner or later.

557
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:30,742
Yeah. I just wish it was later, you know.

558
00:47:32,785 --> 00:47:34,218
Christ.

559
00:47:36,945 --> 00:47:40,096
Hey! You gonna spend
the rest of your life in bed?

560
00:47:42,745 --> 00:47:47,773
Don't you think you're takin' this
a little hard? You've gotta go to dinner.

561
00:47:47,945 --> 00:47:50,300
I can't believe you'd forgo
eggplant surprise.

562
00:47:50,425 --> 00:47:54,304
- I'm not hungry.
- That's no reason not to eat the shit.

563
00:47:54,425 --> 00:47:56,620
Coming or not? Last chance.

564
00:48:03,105 --> 00:48:05,061
One more chance.

565
00:48:11,425 --> 00:48:13,939
This is your final and last chance.

566
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,020
Leave me alone!

567
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:21,502
l'll leave you alone. You don't wanna
do anything. You don't wanna...

568
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:25,581
What a jerk!

569
00:48:31,305 --> 00:48:33,455
Very well done, Mr Jenkins.

570
00:48:34,785 --> 00:48:37,618
Extraordinarily average, Mr Maybaum.

571
00:48:37,745 --> 00:48:39,895
Very nice, Mr Jackson.

572
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,340
Very perceptive, Mr Burroughs.

573
00:48:46,945 --> 00:48:49,095
Too vague, Mr Goobser.

574
00:48:49,945 --> 00:48:54,461
We have something really mediocre here,
Mr Ogner. Let's not keep it up.

575
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:57,824
Offended all my sensibilities, Mr Ruskin.

576
00:48:59,465 --> 00:49:00,420
(bell rings)

577
00:49:00,545 --> 00:49:02,661
Hey, Jonathon, wait up!

578
00:49:03,385 --> 00:49:06,297
A C-plus - now you've got something
to be depressed about.

579
00:49:06,425 --> 00:49:09,462
- Even Roger got a B-minus.
- I don't give a shit.

580
00:49:12,665 --> 00:49:17,739
What'll you do for Christmas? Crucify
yourself? I think you're missing the point.

581
00:49:17,865 --> 00:49:19,139
- Do you?
- I do.

582
00:49:19,265 --> 00:49:22,974
She was beautiful. She was wonderful.
But a fuck... lt's just a fuck.

583
00:49:23,105 --> 00:49:27,178
- Sometimes you're a real asshole.
- You're not the first guy to be dumped on.

584
00:49:27,305 --> 00:49:31,935
One thing I don't need right now
is the world according to Skippy here.

585
00:49:32,905 --> 00:49:35,624
Do us both a favour, huh? Just shut up.

586
00:49:36,305 --> 00:49:38,261
OK, Mr Depth.

587
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:42,181
- Wallow in it.
- (bell rings)

588
00:49:46,825 --> 00:49:48,941
- Dammit, Roger, hurry up.
- Don't rush me.

589
00:49:49,065 --> 00:49:51,056
We're playing poker.
You want me to help?

590
00:49:51,185 --> 00:49:55,303
All right, all right. Does a full house beat
a flush or does a flush beat a full house?

591
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,336
You don't even know how to play!

592
00:49:57,465 --> 00:49:59,456
How many times do we have to tell you?

593
00:49:59,585 --> 00:50:03,055
- Come on! Come on!
- (thud)

594
00:50:03,185 --> 00:50:05,983
- What was that?
- (door opens)

595
00:50:06,105 --> 00:50:09,381
lt's Jonathon. He's really freakin' out.

596
00:50:09,505 --> 00:50:11,063
Oh, great.

597
00:50:11,185 --> 00:50:14,097
- Jonathon's always freakin' out.
- We gotta redeal.

598
00:50:14,225 --> 00:50:16,022
- Redeal?
- He had to leave.

599
00:50:16,145 --> 00:50:17,544
- So what?
- lt's a redeal.

600
00:50:17,665 --> 00:50:22,420
- If it was your cards you wouldn't do it.
- After someone leaves... doesn't count.

601
00:50:22,545 --> 00:50:24,934
- Gimme those cards!
- lt's a null game.

602
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:30,583
No way! No way! Get outta here!
lf it was your cards, you wouldn't redeal.

603
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:37,934
Jonathon!

604
00:50:40,065 --> 00:50:42,420
Jesus Christ! Jonathon!

605
00:50:48,865 --> 00:50:50,935
Jonathon! Jonathon!

606
00:51:01,305 --> 00:51:05,662
Jonathon! Come back, goddammit!
Jonathon, stop!

607
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:16,824
Shut up! Shut up! Listen, man,
you're gonna get kicked outta here.

608
00:51:16,945 --> 00:51:21,063
You can kiss your fuckin' future goodbye,
including Harvard. Do you hear me?

609
00:51:21,185 --> 00:51:23,415
(muffled cry)

610
00:51:42,345 --> 00:51:44,495
Kicked you out, didn't he?

611
00:51:46,665 --> 00:51:50,897
l, uh... I just can't talk about it right now.

612
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:55,940
My parents give a shitload of money
to this place. Nobody's kickin' you out.

613
00:51:56,065 --> 00:51:58,021
What's done is done.

614
00:52:02,505 --> 00:52:04,461
You dirt clod.

615
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:09,300
- Harvard accepted you already?
- Headmaster Kennedy said, and I quote,

616
00:52:09,425 --> 00:52:13,100
''Jonathon, you are
a credit to us all'', end quote.

617
00:52:13,225 --> 00:52:15,944
- You saved my life, man.
- You still owe me a blow job.

618
00:52:16,225 --> 00:52:20,503
- You're right. I forgot all about that.
- Jesus, you can't forget these things.

619
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:23,378
- We're drinkin'. lt's on you.
- Yeah, of course.

620
00:52:24,065 --> 00:52:26,135
Ma, we can trim the tree when I get there.

621
00:52:26,265 --> 00:52:29,701
l'm only gonna be gone
the first four days. I mean...

622
00:52:30,825 --> 00:52:33,214
Mom, I'll be home for Christmas.

623
00:52:34,265 --> 00:52:36,256
- No. I gotta go.
- (bell rings)

624
00:52:36,385 --> 00:52:40,378
Yeah, I'll call you when I get there,
I promise. I love you too, yeah. OK, bye.

625
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:42,461
Oh, Mom!

Welcome to Toad Hall.

00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:47,215
I have never seen such a vulgar
display of wealth in my entire life.

635
00:53:47,345 --> 00:53:50,303
- How do I get one?
- Well, you can do what we did.

636
00:53:50,425 --> 00:53:52,893
- Bootlegging bought the place.
- Bootlegging?

637
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:55,903
Uh-huh. Before Gramps went legit.

638
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:57,583
Huh.

639
00:54:02,065 --> 00:54:04,056
Oh, these are not for you, OK?

640
00:54:04,185 --> 00:54:07,302
- Remember.
- Thanks. I feel like I'm in a museum.

641
00:54:07,425 --> 00:54:09,780
lt's not much, but it's home.

642
00:54:10,905 --> 00:54:13,100
- Maggie!
- Skip!

643
00:54:13,225 --> 00:54:15,693
- Hi, gorgeous!
- How you doin'?

644
00:54:15,825 --> 00:54:19,613
Great. I want you to meet Jonathon,
my roommate, and a chronic bed-wetter.

645
00:54:19,745 --> 00:54:23,135
You are not too old for me
to put you over my knee, now.

646
00:54:23,265 --> 00:54:26,894
Really? Oh, do it now, Maggie, do it now.

647
00:54:27,025 --> 00:54:29,175
You're crazy!

648
00:54:29,305 --> 00:54:31,261
No, I got it.

649
00:54:41,465 --> 00:54:43,023
Wow.

650
00:54:43,305 --> 00:54:45,261
- Hey!
- Hey.

651
00:54:48,225 --> 00:54:52,696
You know, this room has always had
a special place in my heart.

652
00:54:52,825 --> 00:54:54,781
Come here.

653
00:55:11,585 --> 00:55:13,780
- I'd better not.
- You'd better.

654
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:19,380
You wanna get good and ripped for
an evening at home with the Burroughs.

655
00:55:21,305 --> 00:55:24,980
Don't let the old man scare you.
lf you wanna get on his good side,

656
00:55:25,105 --> 00:55:27,744
tell him you get a hard-on
for firm government control.

657
00:55:28,345 --> 00:55:33,499
Government control, Jonathon, is
anathema to the free-enterprise system.

658
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:36,185
Any intelligent person
knows you cannot interfere

659
00:55:36,305 --> 00:55:38,773
with the laws of supply and demand.

660
00:55:38,905 --> 00:55:41,658
I see your point, sir.
That's why I'm not for tariffs.

661
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:43,503
Right.

662
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:48,460
No, wrong. You gotta have tariffs. How
you gonna compete with the foreigners?

663
00:55:48,585 --> 00:55:51,816
- Gotta have tariffs.
- Jonathon, how can you be so blind?

664
00:55:51,945 --> 00:55:53,298
(door closes)

665
00:55:53,425 --> 00:55:55,859
We're in here, dear. We're havin' a drink.

666
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,338
Mom?

667
00:55:58,265 --> 00:55:59,698
Mom!

668
00:55:59,825 --> 00:56:01,577
Are these for me?

669
00:56:01,705 --> 00:56:03,855
Here, let me have them.

670
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:12,143
I want you to meet my roommate
Jonathon. Jonathon, this is my mom.

671
00:56:17,225 --> 00:56:18,453
Uh...

672
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:21,861
Uh... very nice to meet you,
Mrs Burroughs.

673
00:56:21,985 --> 00:56:23,862
Hello. Hello.

674
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:26,579
Um... well...

675
00:56:26,705 --> 00:56:31,415
I would like to freshen up, so I...
I think I will freshen up, and, um...

676
00:56:31,545 --> 00:56:34,503
l'll see you all at dinner. Darling.

677
00:56:39,985 --> 00:56:45,423
(Mr Burroughs) Well, let's see, where
were we before... we were interrupted?

678
00:56:46,305 --> 00:56:48,057
Oh, yes. Government interference.

679
00:56:48,185 --> 00:56:52,895
l'm also adamantly opposed to the
government baling out corporations.

680
00:56:53,025 --> 00:56:55,255
Unless it's one of our corporations.

681
00:56:55,385 --> 00:56:59,219
(Mr Burroughs) Hm. Quick.
Pretty quick, huh, Jonathon?

682
00:56:59,345 --> 00:57:02,303
- Chip off the old block.
- Holy fuckin' shit.

683
00:57:23,145 --> 00:57:24,737
Jonathon?

684
00:57:24,865 --> 00:57:26,821
Yes, sir?

685
00:57:29,705 --> 00:57:32,742
Evidently you and l
have something in common.

686
00:57:37,345 --> 00:57:40,143
Can you guess what that might be?

687
00:57:41,185 --> 00:57:43,858
Leave it, Maggie'll get it. Maggie!

688
00:57:46,105 --> 00:57:47,902
Jonathon.

689
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:52,581
l, too, was the first boy in my class
at Vernon to be accepted into Harvard.

690
00:57:54,545 --> 00:57:57,901
Jonathon, how wonderful.
Congratulations.

691
00:58:07,265 --> 00:58:10,701
Why don't you try the roast, dear?
lt's a superb cut.

692
00:58:13,025 --> 00:58:14,981
Thank you, sweetheart.

693
00:58:29,825 --> 00:58:35,104
Wish we had food like this at old Vermin.
We'd probably have a lot fewer suicides.

694
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:37,580
lf you concentrated more
on studies than jokes,

695
00:58:37,705 --> 00:58:41,664
perhaps you too would've been
accepted into Harvard by now.

696
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:48,625
Well, uh, Jonathon, back to Harvard.

697
00:58:49,665 --> 00:58:52,543
I imagine this is a very
exciting time in your life.

698
00:58:52,665 --> 00:58:54,860
Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

699
00:58:54,985 --> 00:58:59,775
I bet you are. Well, it's a turning point,
really. If you study hard at Harvard,

700
00:58:59,905 --> 00:59:02,578
you'll be able to write your own ticket.

701
00:59:08,385 --> 00:59:11,218
Darling, get me some more wine,
would you?

702
00:59:12,745 --> 00:59:14,861
Why don't you wait for the last course?

703
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:18,777
That was quite a display
you put on at the dinner table.

704
00:59:18,905 --> 00:59:22,102
I guess it doesn't matter
what you do in private.

705
00:59:27,385 --> 00:59:29,182
Let me tell you somethin', lady.

706
00:59:29,305 --> 00:59:33,583
As long as you're in this house
with me, representing this family,

707
00:59:34,985 --> 00:59:40,139
you will control that neurosis or whatever
the hell it is you think you've got.

708
00:59:47,185 --> 00:59:52,339
And you'll behave like a Burroughs even
if you don't feel like one. Is that clear?

709
01:00:28,865 --> 01:00:30,423
Jonathon?

710
01:00:45,025 --> 01:00:47,459
Jonathon, I have to talk to you.

711
01:00:48,905 --> 01:00:50,861
What do you want?

712
01:00:55,265 --> 01:00:57,335
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry?

713
01:00:57,465 --> 01:01:00,935
- Jesus, your son is in the next room!
- I would never have done it

714
01:01:01,065 --> 01:01:03,215
if I'd known who you were.

715
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:09,101
Look... I... I need to explain.

716
01:01:09,225 --> 01:01:11,785
- No. No, you don't.
- Please.

717
01:01:13,745 --> 01:01:16,498
Jesus, I don't know
what you want from me.

718
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:20,220
lf you want understanding, OK.
I understand.

719
01:01:24,105 --> 01:01:26,824
Would you please hold me? Would you?

720
01:01:26,945 --> 01:01:28,901
No, I can't.

721
01:01:29,025 --> 01:01:31,334
(knocking) Hey, ace, are you awake?

722
01:01:32,305 --> 01:01:34,261
Argh! Shit!

723
01:01:34,945 --> 01:01:36,901
Ow! Jesus.

724
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:39,697
What are you doing?

725
01:01:39,825 --> 01:01:43,340
Uh, I was trying to open
the door for you. I tripped.

726
01:01:43,465 --> 01:01:45,421
What a gonad!

727
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:49,581
Get dressed.

728
01:01:58,425 --> 01:02:01,497
So, what did you think of dinner?

729
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:04,662
lt's, uh, pretty fuckin' entertaining, huh?

730
01:02:12,505 --> 01:02:15,497
Do you ever wonder if
your parents still do it?

731
01:02:20,545 --> 01:02:24,538
Actually, I think my parents
have a pretty normal relationship.

732
01:02:24,665 --> 01:02:28,021
He tells her exactly what to do,
and she ignores him.

733
01:02:37,305 --> 01:02:39,819
l'm never gettin' married.

734
01:02:39,945 --> 01:02:43,017
- Neither am I.
- That'll break a lot of hearts.

735
01:02:56,545 --> 01:02:59,298
- How you doin', Jonathon?
- Good.

736
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:02,815
Good man.
Who wants to race me to the fence?

737
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,505
- How about you, Skip?
- Whoa!

738
01:03:06,385 --> 01:03:08,341
Come on!

739
01:03:19,825 --> 01:03:21,895
How are you?

740
01:03:22,025 --> 01:03:24,380
I want you off this property today.

741
01:03:30,505 --> 01:03:35,374
- So, how was the snow where you were?
- lt was fabulous. We had five inches.

742
01:03:37,145 --> 01:03:40,581
Oh, man. Comin' back here
is depressing enough.

743
01:03:40,705 --> 01:03:43,094
Havin' to face exams
is almost more than I can bear.

744
01:03:43,225 --> 01:03:46,376
Having to examine your face
is almost more than we can bear.

745
01:03:46,505 --> 01:03:49,144
- Funny.
- You're a mindless idiot. I mean it.

746
01:03:49,265 --> 01:03:52,018
You're a wit, Roscoe. You're a true wit.

747
01:03:52,145 --> 01:03:54,215
- See you later.
- OK, bye.

748
01:04:06,665 --> 01:04:08,303
(bugle)

749
01:04:08,425 --> 01:04:11,098
OK, you guys, the kid is back!

750
01:04:13,865 --> 01:04:15,821
- Hey, buddy.
- Miss me?

751
01:04:16,985 --> 01:04:20,295
Do you really think an investigation
of our students is necessary?

752
01:04:20,425 --> 01:04:23,576
Yes, I do. So does the state of lllinois.

753
01:04:23,705 --> 01:04:26,378
I want to see the student files
as soon as possible.

754
01:04:26,505 --> 01:04:29,815
I think the only way
to clear up the problem is...

755
01:04:29,945 --> 01:04:32,459
ls there somebody out there?

756
01:04:32,585 --> 01:04:34,541
Uh, yes, sir. lt's, uh, me, sir.

757
01:04:34,665 --> 01:04:38,180
And what can I do for you, Mr Maybaum?

758
01:04:38,305 --> 01:04:43,220
Mrs Hayworth needs your signatures
on here. I mean, your signature.

759
01:04:43,345 --> 01:04:45,301
To sign it.

760
01:05:00,945 --> 01:05:02,173
(yells)

761
01:05:05,065 --> 01:05:07,374
I don't get it! I don't get it!

762
01:05:07,505 --> 01:05:09,860
I don't wanna get it! I hate it!

763
01:05:12,385 --> 01:05:14,899
- Skip.
- No, forget it. There's no way.

764
01:05:15,025 --> 01:05:18,301
l'm a dead man.
Adios, Harvard. Bonjour , Trade Tech.

765
01:05:18,425 --> 01:05:20,381
OK, look, look.

766
01:05:20,505 --> 01:05:22,541
lf the area un... Skip.

767
01:05:23,705 --> 01:05:27,254
lf the area under the curve
represented by F times the quantity X

768
01:05:27,385 --> 01:05:32,095
is bounded by vertical lines X = sub A
and X = sub B, what do you have to find?

769
01:05:32,225 --> 01:05:34,659
- A gun. lt's hopeless.
- (knock at door)

770
01:05:34,785 --> 01:05:37,094
Meeting in Roscoe's room after lights out!

771
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,455
That's in three hours. I better get ready.

772
01:05:39,585 --> 01:05:43,134
All I heard was that he was
talkin' about some investigation.

773
01:05:43,265 --> 01:05:46,416
- What investigation?
- I don't know. That's what I'm tellin' you.

774
01:05:46,545 --> 01:05:48,501
(knocking)

775
01:05:52,585 --> 01:05:55,145
(all mutter) ..five, six, seven, eight.

776
01:05:55,265 --> 01:05:59,417
- Jonathon, telephone.
- (mimicking) Jonathon, telephone.

777
01:06:02,985 --> 01:06:05,260
- Hello?
- (Ellen) Jonathon?

778
01:06:05,385 --> 01:06:07,979
- Oh, God.
- How are you?

779
01:06:08,105 --> 01:06:10,983
- Are you serious?
- Why didn't you say goodbye?

780
01:06:11,105 --> 01:06:14,222
- Look, you ordered me off the property.
- Did I?

781
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:20,100
- Don't play games with me, huh?
- I have to see you.

782
01:06:20,225 --> 01:06:22,580
Yeah, I can't talk. I gotta go.

783
01:06:24,305 --> 01:06:27,980
- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah. Yeah, you too.

784
01:06:28,105 --> 01:06:32,383
- Why don't we just kill the guy?
- lt'd be good if we could.

785
01:06:32,505 --> 01:06:34,780
- Who was it?
- Huh?

786
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,656
On the phone.

787
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:38,740
Oh.

788
01:06:38,865 --> 01:06:41,777
My mom. The dog died.

789
01:06:41,905 --> 01:06:43,497
No shit.

790
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:47,379
- What does this guy look like?
- Hitler, man. The guy looks like Hitler.

791
01:06:47,505 --> 01:06:51,384
He's got a little moustache and beady
little eyes. He stares right through you.

792
01:06:51,505 --> 01:06:55,737
The bastard never blinks. I was in there
for five minutes, the guy didn't blink once.

793
01:06:55,865 --> 01:06:58,937
He just... stares right through you.
He goes...

794
01:07:24,945 --> 01:07:26,617
Yeah!

795
01:07:26,745 --> 01:07:30,420
All right, so it's me,
Roger, Doug, and Barry.

796
01:07:30,545 --> 01:07:32,501
(knocking)

797
01:07:37,425 --> 01:07:39,381
..five, six, seven, eight.

798
01:07:40,865 --> 01:07:44,016
- Phone again for Jonathon.
- His dog died again.

799
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,295
Shh! OK, look, here's the plan.

800
01:07:49,585 --> 01:07:51,815
This is the bedroom.
There's a window here.

801
01:07:51,945 --> 01:07:56,097
lf it's clear, we'll all come around
this corner and go through the window.

802
01:07:56,225 --> 01:07:58,181
- Search for anything.
- Anything.

803
01:07:58,665 --> 01:08:02,658
- Yeah, I'm still here.
- (Ellen) Just to talk. Just for an hour.

804
01:08:02,785 --> 01:08:05,504
- I can't, OK?
- Jonathon.

805
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:08,059
- Can't.
- Just for an hour.

806
01:08:08,185 --> 01:08:11,541
Please. Come on,
don't call me any more, all right?

807
01:08:14,705 --> 01:08:15,694
Jesus.

808
01:08:26,585 --> 01:08:28,541
(tuneless singing)

809
01:08:44,265 --> 01:08:46,221
OK, let's go.

810
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:50,861
Come on, come on!

811
01:08:50,985 --> 01:08:53,101
Shh! Get down. Let's go.

812
01:09:12,865 --> 01:09:14,696
- Holy shit!
- What?

813
01:09:15,105 --> 01:09:16,777
- Guy's a fuckin' narc!
- Shh!

814
01:09:16,905 --> 01:09:18,463
Hello?

815
01:09:20,745 --> 01:09:22,144
Hello?

816
01:09:22,265 --> 01:09:23,300
Hello?

817
01:09:24,465 --> 01:09:26,774
Shit! Let's get outta here!

818
01:09:31,225 --> 01:09:33,261
- Is anybody there?
- Go! Go!

819
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:37,139
Get outta my way!
Get outta my way, dammit!

820
01:09:37,265 --> 01:09:40,223
- Shit!
- Come on, man, move it. Go. Go.

821
01:09:40,345 --> 01:09:41,937
Hello?

822
01:09:56,665 --> 01:09:59,384
- When's the bust?
- I don't know!

823
01:09:59,505 --> 01:10:01,860
Raid. Raid, man.

824
01:10:01,985 --> 01:10:04,419
- What's goin' on?
- The guy is a narc.

825
01:10:05,905 --> 01:10:10,057
- You better dump it all!
- I'll never make it through exams now!

826
01:10:13,665 --> 01:10:14,654
Quick!

827
01:10:18,785 --> 01:10:21,538
lf you have anything,
you'd better dump it right now.

828
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:25,503
- How are you gonna flush that?
- Watch me.

829
01:10:27,065 --> 01:10:29,784
Outta my way. I got shit to flush here.

830
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:46,260
Make way, gentlemen, please.

831
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:49,981
Read 'em and weep.

832
01:10:52,545 --> 01:10:54,695
All right! Whoo-hoo!

833
01:10:54,825 --> 01:10:59,740
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
All right! All right! Whoo-hoo!

834
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,541
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

835
01:11:06,905 --> 01:11:10,864
Jonathon! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

836
01:11:10,985 --> 01:11:15,422
- Ya-da-da-da-da-da! Ya-da-da-da-da-da!
- Skip! Skip.

837
01:11:15,545 --> 01:11:17,934
- Well?
- You passed.

838
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:21,614
Passed, my ass, man.
We're number one and two, me and you.

839
01:11:21,745 --> 01:11:23,975
Thanks to you, we're a friggin' genius!

840
01:11:24,105 --> 01:11:27,017
- So we're gonna party our balls off.
- I can't.

841
01:11:27,145 --> 01:11:29,295
- I didn't hear that.
- I gotta go to Chicago.

842
01:11:29,425 --> 01:11:33,179
- Great thinkin'. I own the town.
- No, come on, I'm goin' alone, Skip.

843
01:11:33,305 --> 01:11:37,901
Jesus, not that shit again. I told you to
forget about her. You'll never find her.

844
01:11:38,505 --> 01:11:41,861
No, I'm not goin' for that.
I just wanna be alone, OK?

845
01:11:42,745 --> 01:11:44,303
OK.

846
01:11:49,425 --> 01:11:53,304
But next time you're feelin' sad and blue,
don't expect old Skipper here

847
01:11:53,425 --> 01:11:57,179
to put on his big red nose
and floppy shoes just pour vous.

848
01:12:00,945 --> 01:12:03,505
Adios... Mr Morose.

849
01:12:09,945 --> 01:12:11,901
Yeah! Yeah!

850
01:12:18,785 --> 01:12:23,813
Jesus Christ, I'm not the one who calls
you up every week for a month, OK?

851
01:12:23,945 --> 01:12:27,415
Do you understand your son is
my roommate, my best friend, OK?

852
01:12:27,545 --> 01:12:30,298
I can't believe we're arguing about this.

853
01:12:33,385 --> 01:12:35,899
I came here today cos I felt sorry for you.

854
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:39,776
Where the hell do you get off
talking to me like that?

855
01:12:39,905 --> 01:12:42,419
You don't know anything about me.

856
01:12:42,545 --> 01:12:45,105
You don't know anything about my life.

857
01:12:46,105 --> 01:12:48,460
When I first saw you in that bar...

858
01:12:50,465 --> 01:12:52,421
you were pathetic.

859
01:12:54,305 --> 01:12:56,455
You were a sympathy fuck.

860
01:12:58,505 --> 01:13:00,575
Jesus Christ.

861
01:13:00,705 --> 01:13:02,821
You'd better go, Jonathon.

862
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:13,857
Um, room service. lt's room 101 7. I'd like
a bottle of vodka sent up right away.

863
01:13:14,225 --> 01:13:17,740
- Oh, that'll really help, won't it?
- Yes, it will, Jonathon.

864
01:13:17,865 --> 01:13:20,618
A damn sight more than you will. 101 7.

865
01:13:33,425 --> 01:13:35,575
I asked you to go.

866
01:13:38,385 --> 01:13:40,501
You can't call me any more.

867
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,581
I know.

868
01:13:44,225 --> 01:13:45,783
I won't.

869
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:50,381
l'm sorry.

870
01:14:13,105 --> 01:14:14,618
Hold me.

871
01:14:14,905 --> 01:14:16,975
- Are you sure it'll be all right?
- Trust me.

872
01:14:17,105 --> 01:14:20,984
He is in serious trouble. He's forgotten
the meaning of the word ''debauchery''.

873
01:14:21,105 --> 01:14:22,743
This is gonna be great.

874
01:14:22,865 --> 01:14:25,902
Bet you've never been
with guys as crazy as us.

875
01:14:26,385 --> 01:14:30,014
- Sure he's in here?
- Yeah, man, I told you, I followed him.

876
01:14:30,145 --> 01:14:31,703
Shh!

877
01:14:35,025 --> 01:14:37,539
Shh. Shh. Are you ready? Shh.

878
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,058
(Skip mouths)

879
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:43,141
Room service!

880
01:14:43,905 --> 01:14:44,860
(knocking)

881
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:47,215
Room service!

882
01:14:57,425 --> 01:14:59,575
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Shit.

883
01:15:00,945 --> 01:15:03,140
- Maybe we ought to leave.
- Skip.

884
01:15:04,905 --> 01:15:06,384
Skipper.

885
01:15:09,825 --> 01:15:13,135
Jonathon, aren't you going to
introduce your friend?

886
01:15:13,265 --> 01:15:15,620
She got any sisters, Jonathon?

887
01:15:26,985 --> 01:15:30,739
- (girl #1 ) Well, that was a short party!
- (girl #2) Yeah!

888
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:35,820
Would you please... excuse me?

889
01:15:40,545 --> 01:15:42,501
Skip! Skip!

890
01:16:06,065 --> 01:16:08,021
(man) Lights out!

891
01:16:37,425 --> 01:16:39,381
Look, Skip...

892
01:16:40,425 --> 01:16:43,861
Skip, come on. Look, Skip,
I didn't know who she was.

893
01:16:45,185 --> 01:16:47,141
l'm really sorry.

894
01:16:48,305 --> 01:16:50,261
l'm sorry.

895
01:16:52,665 --> 01:16:55,941
Come on... Do you think
we should talk about this?

896
01:16:56,705 --> 01:17:01,301
Hey, there's nothin' to talk about.
I told you, a fuck is just a fuck.

897
01:17:07,825 --> 01:17:09,383
OK.

898
01:17:27,425 --> 01:17:28,744
Urgh!

899
01:17:28,865 --> 01:17:30,821
What's your problem, Skip?

900
01:17:37,265 --> 01:17:39,540
Argh! Damn you!

901
01:17:39,665 --> 01:17:43,704
- Get outta my way!
- Cheap play, Burroughs! I'm warnin' you!

902
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:46,339
- What the hell is goin' on there?
- I don't know.

903
01:17:48,065 --> 01:17:50,215
Son of a bitch!

904
01:17:52,425 --> 01:17:54,575
l'll fix your ass for you!

905
01:17:56,305 --> 01:17:57,374
(whistle blows)

906
01:17:57,505 --> 01:17:59,939
Burroughs, you bastard.

907
01:18:00,065 --> 01:18:04,422
Watch the language! Burroughs,
l've had it with you. Get outta here!

908
01:18:04,545 --> 01:18:08,538
- Yeah, let's go!
- (squawking laughter)

909
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:12,183
- Hey, man.
- (boy squawks) Bye-bye!

910
01:18:12,305 --> 01:18:14,341
Take a cold shower!

911
01:18:20,785 --> 01:18:23,902
- Mr Burroughs.
- Hello, Jonathon.

912
01:18:24,865 --> 01:18:27,902
- How are you?
- Fine. You know when Skip'll be back?

913
01:18:28,025 --> 01:18:30,095
Uh, he should be back soon.

914
01:18:30,225 --> 01:18:32,420
How've you been?

915
01:18:32,545 --> 01:18:34,342
Good.

916
01:18:34,465 --> 01:18:36,740
Pretty busy?

917
01:18:36,865 --> 01:18:38,901
How's your social life?

918
01:18:40,065 --> 01:18:41,623
Girlfriends?

919
01:18:43,305 --> 01:18:44,135
No?

920
01:18:44,265 --> 01:18:47,655
OK, sir. Come on, let's get it over with.
I can't take this.

921
01:18:47,785 --> 01:18:49,935
What are you talkin' about?

922
01:18:52,025 --> 01:18:54,175
What am I talkin' about?

923
01:18:56,185 --> 01:18:58,335
What are you doing here?

924
01:18:59,585 --> 01:19:01,735
- Would you excuse us?
- Sure.

925
01:19:09,305 --> 01:19:11,182
What's wrong?

926
01:19:11,305 --> 01:19:16,743
Your mother's in the hospital, son.
She checked herself in three days ago.

927
01:19:16,865 --> 01:19:19,459
She felt she needed psychiatric help.

928
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:22,461
She's getting it.

929
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:32,615
You don't seem surprised.

930
01:19:34,425 --> 01:19:38,498
- What do you want me to say?
- What kind of attitude is that?

931
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:43,574
lt's not an attitude. If she thinks that
she needs help, then she should get it.

932
01:19:47,465 --> 01:19:49,660
Face it, Dad,
we're just a fucked-up family.

933
01:19:50,025 --> 01:19:52,414
That's the guy. That's the narc.

934
01:19:58,785 --> 01:20:01,504
Gentlemen, I am going to need your help.

935
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:06,380
This is Mr Balaban. He is from
the state attorney general's office,

936
01:20:06,505 --> 01:20:11,420
and he is presently conducting an
investigation of the schools in our area.

937
01:20:11,545 --> 01:20:16,573
Apparently, there has been some
widespread cheating on the SAT tests.

938
01:20:16,705 --> 01:20:21,540
I hope that Mr Balaban is wrong about
Vernon Academy, but nonetheless,

939
01:20:21,665 --> 01:20:24,623
we are going to give him
our full cooperation.

940
01:20:27,465 --> 01:20:29,615
- You're dead, Roger!
- Asshole!

941
01:20:29,745 --> 01:20:32,305
- You stupid shit!
- A narc, huh?

942
01:20:32,425 --> 01:20:36,179
- You asshole!
- I flushed $300 down the goddamn toilet!

943
01:20:40,665 --> 01:20:44,897
So, this is a real
pain-in-the-ass way to meet, isn't it?

944
01:20:45,025 --> 01:20:48,176
- I hear you're already headed to Harvard.
- Yes.

945
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,382
You got a near-perfect score
on your SAT test.

946
01:20:54,305 --> 01:20:58,662
Very impressive. Normally
I would've suspected you right away.

947
01:21:00,305 --> 01:21:03,103
Right away.

948
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:06,262
But you've been a straight-A student
all your life, so...

949
01:21:06,385 --> 01:21:09,263
the only conclusion I can draw is,
either you're innocent,

950
01:21:09,385 --> 01:21:13,583
or you've been stealing tests
since you were in nursery school.

951
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:18,185
I guess we better get down to business.

952
01:21:30,745 --> 01:21:33,498
l'm gonna have to
ask you some questions.

953
01:21:35,585 --> 01:21:39,021
Do you have any knowledge
of the stolen SAT tests?

954
01:21:40,825 --> 01:21:42,781
No, sir.

955
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:45,775
Did you purchase an SAT test?

956
01:21:47,825 --> 01:21:49,781
No, sir.

957
01:22:01,185 --> 01:22:01,742
Thank you.

958
01:22:02,065 --> 01:22:04,260
They kept Ostroff for an hour and a half.

959
01:22:04,385 --> 01:22:08,264
- I heard they nailed Powers.
- Powers! What a jerk-off!

960
01:22:08,385 --> 01:22:13,015
He didn't cheat, but he's so scared he
confessed to smokin', goin' off campus,

961
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:16,421
- and spyin' on Kennedy's wife in the can.
- Oh, man!

962
01:22:16,545 --> 01:22:18,581
Well, I tell you somethin',

963
01:22:18,705 --> 01:22:22,744
it'll take more than some fag from the
attorney general's office to open my lips.

964
01:22:22,865 --> 01:22:24,901
Yeah! Two fags!

965
01:22:25,025 --> 01:22:29,541
Fuck you, Roscoe! Wait till you
get in there, you'll be Jell-O guts.

966
01:22:33,825 --> 01:22:35,781
How you doin'?

967
01:22:53,305 --> 01:22:55,455
You heard from Harvard.

968
01:23:04,825 --> 01:23:06,178
Hey.

969
01:23:06,905 --> 01:23:08,816
Congratulations.

970
01:23:18,865 --> 01:23:21,140
(narrator) Seldom seen by civilised man,

971
01:23:21,265 --> 01:23:24,177
this sacred rituaI was
captured by our camera...

972
01:23:24,305 --> 01:23:25,863
(shouting)

973
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:37,297
- Shut the projector off, please.
- (booing)

974
01:23:37,425 --> 01:23:40,064
More bodies for the inquisition,
Mr Maybaum?

975
01:23:40,185 --> 01:23:41,777
Yes, ma'am.

976
01:23:42,065 --> 01:23:46,183
Mr Simons and Mr Burroughs,
you are today's lucky winners.

977
01:23:48,865 --> 01:23:50,821
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Shit.

978
01:24:00,465 --> 01:24:03,025
I know we're supposed
to give our full cooperation

979
01:24:03,145 --> 01:24:05,534
to this stupid and pointless investigation,

980
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:08,384
but when they interrupt
one of my classes,

981
01:24:08,865 --> 01:24:10,821
it pisses me off.

982
01:24:12,665 --> 01:24:14,860
(boy) This is now my favourite class.

983
01:24:17,785 --> 01:24:19,776
Come in. Sit down.

984
01:24:28,585 --> 01:24:30,143
Squire.

985
01:24:32,185 --> 01:24:35,939
So, this is a real
pain-in-the-ass way to meet, isn't it?

986
01:24:36,945 --> 01:24:40,255
I see you, uh... applied to Harvard.

987
01:24:40,385 --> 01:24:44,060
l'm an NYU man myself.
l... worked my way through.

988
01:24:50,745 --> 01:24:53,179
Got a very high score on your SAT.

989
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:55,784
''Burroughs''.

990
01:24:55,905 --> 01:25:00,376
You're not by any chance related to the
Burroughs who's on the board of AT&T?

991
01:25:00,505 --> 01:25:02,097
Daddy.

992
01:25:02,225 --> 01:25:04,181
Really?

993
01:25:04,465 --> 01:25:09,903
Ha-ha. I would imagine that the pressure
to get into Harvard must be very intense.

994
01:25:12,385 --> 01:25:14,421
Your grades weren't bad.

995
01:25:15,105 --> 01:25:17,335
Your grades were all right.

996
01:25:17,465 --> 01:25:20,059
But it was the SAT score that got you in.

997
01:25:23,265 --> 01:25:25,825
I don't wanna put you through this.

998
01:25:26,745 --> 01:25:30,021
But we've all done things
that we're ashamed of.

999
01:25:30,145 --> 01:25:32,534
Things that we have to live with.

1000
01:25:32,665 --> 01:25:36,260
Sometimes painfully.
Because only occasionally...

1001
01:25:36,385 --> 01:25:40,537
does the opportunity present itself
to rectify our mistakes.

1002
01:25:40,665 --> 01:25:44,624
And with that said, I guess
we should get down to business.

1003
01:25:47,745 --> 01:25:51,021
Do you have any knowledge
of the stolen SAT tests?

1004
01:25:55,945 --> 01:25:59,096
Mr Burroughs,
where do you think you're going?

1005
01:26:00,585 --> 01:26:02,541
Fuck you.

1006
01:26:05,505 --> 01:26:08,975
- He really said ''Fuck you''?
- He looked him straight in the eye,

1007
01:26:09,105 --> 01:26:10,902
- said it, and walked out.
- All right!

1008
01:26:11,025 --> 01:26:12,299
I couldn't believe it!

1009
01:26:12,425 --> 01:26:15,223
- He told Balaban to go fuck himself.
- No shit?

1010
01:26:15,345 --> 01:26:20,499
- He told Balaban to go fuck himself!
- Burroughs told Balaban to fuck himself!

1011
01:26:22,505 --> 01:26:24,621
Hey! Skip!

1012
01:26:31,225 --> 01:26:33,580
Good job!

1013
01:26:51,585 --> 01:26:53,143
Skip!

1014
01:26:54,545 --> 01:26:57,298
Come on.
Why didn't you turn me in? Huh?

1015
01:26:58,345 --> 01:27:01,337
You don't talk to me. You save my ass,
but you don't talk to me.

1016
01:27:01,465 --> 01:27:04,821
Well, thanks, buddy. Maybe I'll do
the same for you sometime, huh?

1017
01:27:04,945 --> 01:27:07,300
What could anybody do
for Mr Perfect, though?

1018
01:27:07,425 --> 01:27:10,303
Hey, I got it. I'll drop dead.
Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

1019
01:27:11,225 --> 01:27:15,423
I could shoot myself. No, you shoot me
and mount my head next to the moose.

1020
01:27:15,545 --> 01:27:20,380
You could stretch the panties between
my ears. Come on, you'd love that!

1021
01:27:20,505 --> 01:27:23,861
How the hell was I supposed to know
who she was? You sent me to the bar.

1022
01:27:23,985 --> 01:27:26,340
You send her there to get laid, too?

1023
01:27:27,865 --> 01:27:32,416
You son of a bitch. You went back there
even after you knew who she was.

1024
01:27:54,825 --> 01:27:57,385
Goddammit, you're gonna talk to me!

1025
01:28:24,665 --> 01:28:27,862
Oh, get away from me!
Get away from me, you...

1026
01:28:30,465 --> 01:28:34,504
OK, you wanna talk? You wanna
fucking talk, you lying son of a bitch?

1027
01:28:34,625 --> 01:28:36,775
You bastard! Come on! Come on!

1028
01:28:41,025 --> 01:28:43,903
- I'm sorry, man.
- Come on, let's go!

1029
01:28:45,105 --> 01:28:46,823
Come on.

1030
01:28:47,305 --> 01:28:49,773
- Cut it out!
- I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass!

1031
01:28:49,905 --> 01:28:52,180
Come on. Cut it out.

1032
01:28:54,065 --> 01:28:56,021
Argh! Shit!

1033
01:29:13,345 --> 01:29:15,415
Stay away from me!

1034
01:29:17,705 --> 01:29:19,661
Argh! Fuck!

1035
01:29:28,065 --> 01:29:29,623
Skip?

1036
01:29:30,265 --> 01:29:31,698
Skip?

1037
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:33,417
Fuck!

1038
01:29:33,545 --> 01:29:35,581
You son of a bitch!

1039
01:29:47,945 --> 01:29:49,537
Come on!

1040
01:29:51,705 --> 01:29:55,015
- God damn you!
- Oh, just back off!

1041
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:06,421
- Truce!
- Truce, shit!

1042
01:30:21,465 --> 01:30:23,820
I never would've seen her again.

1043
01:30:24,785 --> 01:30:26,821
She kept callin' me.

1044
01:30:28,105 --> 01:30:30,539
I just wanted to talk, honest to God.

1045
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:33,581
But, oh, shit...

1046
01:30:35,785 --> 01:30:38,219
I was in love with her, I really was.

1047
01:30:43,505 --> 01:30:45,655
Oh, man, I'm sorry, Skip.

1048
01:30:49,465 --> 01:30:51,023
Skip?

1049
01:30:56,185 --> 01:30:57,857
(voices)

1050
01:31:00,345 --> 01:31:01,664
- Jesus!
- Whoa!

1051
01:31:01,785 --> 01:31:03,901
What's goin' on? Holy shit!

1052
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:08,815
- Have you guys been fightin'?
- This looks kinda private. We oughta...

1053
01:31:08,945 --> 01:31:10,742
- Oh. Oh. OK.
- Yeah.

1054
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:13,777
lf you need anything,
you know, like a neck brace...

1055
01:31:13,905 --> 01:31:17,215
- Come to my room. See you later.
- ..we'll be right down the hall. Bye!

1056
01:31:17,345 --> 01:31:19,620
- Real later.
- OK, see ya.

1057
01:31:23,985 --> 01:31:26,738
Oh, by the way, your mom called.

1058
01:31:28,145 --> 01:31:29,624
Yeah?

1059
01:31:29,745 --> 01:31:31,701
The dog died.

1060
01:31:33,225 --> 01:31:34,897
What?

1061
01:31:35,025 --> 01:31:36,981
You're so gullible!

1062
01:33:59,465 --> 01:34:01,820
