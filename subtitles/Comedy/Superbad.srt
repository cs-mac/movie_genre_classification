1
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,301
Yo.

2
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:53,530
Hey, I Was doing some research
for next year...

3
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:56,645
...and I think I figured out
Which Website I Wanna subscribe to.

4
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:59,877
- The Vag-tastic Voyage.
- Which one is the Vag-tastic Voyage?

5
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,852
<i>The Vag-tastic Voyage</i>
<i>is the one where...</i>

6
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:05,361
<i>... they find random girls on the street,</i>
<i>and they invite them into a van...</i>

7
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,331
...and then they bang them
in the van.

8
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:08,800
It's like 13 bucks a month...

9
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:10,669
...and you get access
to other sites.

10
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:15,182
Like one's Latina, one's Asian,
you knoW, there's one for fetishes...

11
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,880
...like feet and pee-pee and shit
and stuff like that.

12
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:19,857
That's disgusting.
You're like an animal.

13
00:02:20,063 --> 00:02:22,534
I'm... What? I'm disgusting?
You're the Weird one, man.

14
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:24,706
Don't make me feel Weird
because I like porn.

15
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:27,208
You're Weird for not liking porn.
I'm normal as shit.

16
00:02:27,412 --> 00:02:29,177
Peeing on people. That's normal?

17
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,718
Evan, I'm not saying
I'm gonna look at it.

18
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:34,290
I'm just saying that
it comes With the site, okay?

19
00:02:34,494 --> 00:02:36,862
I don't knoW What I'm gonna be into
10 years from noW.

20
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:38,763
I'm just sick of all the amateur stuff.

21
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,136
I mean, like, if I'm paying top dollar,
I Want a little production value.

22
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:45,077
Like some editing, transition,
something. Some music.

23
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:49,122
Yeah, Well, I'm sorry the Coen brothers
don't direct the porn that I Watch.

24
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,885
They're hard to get ahold of, okay?

25
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:53,932
Plus your parents are gonna be
looking at the bill, dipshit.

26
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:58,544
Yeah, you're right. I probably should
pick the one With the least dirty name.

27
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:02,845
What about, like, Perfect Ten?

28
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:04,854
Something like that, you knoW?

29
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,619
Like Perfect Ten?

30
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:08,662
Because that could be
any number of things.

31
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:12,237
They can't really get you for that.
That could be, like, a boWling Website.

32
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:16,472
Yeah, but they don't really shoW dick
going in, Which is a huge concern.

33
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:17,651
I didn't realize that.

34
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:20,415
Plus, have you ever seen
a vagina by itself?

35
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,024
Not for me.

36
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,665
Hi.

37
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:28,667
- Thanks for taking him, Seth.
- No... No problem, Jane.

38
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,108
- HoW are you?
- Good.

39
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:32,908
Beautiful.

40
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:35,515
- Don't touch that.
- What are you...?

41
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:37,819
- I'm not a piece of meat.
- You tWo are funny.

42
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,796
I can't imagine What you're gonna do
Without each other next year.

43
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:44,031
Evan told me
you didn't get into Dartmouth.

44
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:48,908
I got into some schools, some
pretty good ones. So I'll be fine.

45
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:52,114
- You gonna miss each other?
- No. Miss each other? No, thank you.

46
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:53,885
I don't... I don't miss each other.

47
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:55,895
I'm gonna cry myself
to sleep every night.

48
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,660
- Me too.
- When I'm out partying.

49
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,464
Go to school, boys.

50
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:02,639
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Jane.

51
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:08,688
I am truly jealous you got to suck
on those tits When you Were a baby.

52
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:11,798
Yeah, Well, at least you got to
suck on your dad's dick.

53
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:26,154
Hey, Seth,
you can't park in the faculty lot.

54
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:29,269
Don't be such a vagine, man.
I gotta get a Red Bull before class.

55
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:33,434
You're being an idiot.
You shouldn't have parked there.

56
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,172
Fuck it. I'm about to graduate.

57
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:38,151
They should be sucking
on my ball sac.

58
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,089
It's the least they could do
for stealing three years of my life.

59
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:48,770
- Oh, fuck me.
- Look at those nipples.

60
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,915
They're like little baby toes.

61
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:53,179
It's not fair
they get to flaunt that stuff...

62
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,484
...and I have to hide
every erection I get.

63
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:58,324
You knoW What I do?
I flip my boner up into my Waistband.

64
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,526
It hides it and it feels aWesome.

65
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:03,174
I almost bleW a load
into my bellybutton.

66
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:06,348
I mean, just imagine if girls Weren't
Weirded out by our boners...

67
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,213
...and just, like,
Wanted to see them.

68
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:11,518
I mean, that's the World
I one day Wanna live in.

69
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,859
It's been tWo years since I've seen
an actual human female nipple.

70
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:17,039
Shauna?
Shauna Was tWo years ago noW?

71
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,208
Yeah.

72
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:20,845
Yeah, I guess so.
But she Was insanely hot.

73
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:24,248
Exactly. She Was too hot, okay?
That's What sucks.

74
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:26,721
HoW can that suck?
I'd be psyched if I got With her.

75
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,418
You got, like, tWo dozen handjobs.

76
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:31,330
Yes, and three-quarters of a bloWjob,
but Who's counting?

77
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:33,631
Look, it Was the peak
of my ass-getting career...

78
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:35,401
...and it happened Way too early.

79
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:37,548
- You're like Orson Welles.
- Exactly!

80
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,244
If I'd paced myself,
I'd be having at least steady sex...

81
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:41,753
...With a decent-looking girl.

82
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,931
I honestly see noW Why Orson Welles
ate his fat ass to death.

83
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:46,931
You'll have sex in college,
everyone does.

84
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:50,234
But the point is to be good at sex
by the time you get to college.

85
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:53,279
You don't Want girls thinking
you suck dick at fucking pussy.

86
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:55,453
I still think you have
a chance With Jules.

87
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,453
She got incredibly hot over
last summer...

88
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,628
...and she obviously
hasn't realized it yet...

89
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,495
...because she's still talking to you
and flirting With you.

90
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:05,732
Are you out of your mind?
Look at Jules' dating record, okay?

91
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:09,279
She dated Dan Remick, Who's had
a six-pack since, like, kindergarten.

92
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:13,048
Jason Stone, Who looks like
fucking Zack Morris. And Matt Muir.

93
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:15,524
Matt Muir.
He's the sWeetest guy ever.

94
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:17,564
Have you ever stared into his eyes?

95
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:20,331
It Was like the first time
I heard the Beatles.

96
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,604
Why Would she end
her high school career With me?

97
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:25,841
Becca dated Eric Rosecrantz
for like tWo years.

98
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,355
Yeah, but he's a fucking idiot.
You're a step up from that dick-load.

99
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,654
That's Why you need to stop...
Will you get this?

100
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:34,267
That's Why you need to stop
being a pussy and nail her.

101
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,235
You could bang her
before you leave.

102
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,379
And I'm not gonna dance around it,
she looks like a good fucker.

103
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,983
I'm tired of you talking
about her like that, man.

104
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:45,648
What, you can talk about her all day
and if I say one thing, it's blasphemy?

105
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,420
Well, I don't constantly insult her.

106
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:49,032
I'm not trying to insult her.

107
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:51,762
I'm just saying that
she looks like a good fucker, okay?

108
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:53,499
She looks like she can take a dick.

109
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,273
Some Women pride themselves
on their dick-taking abilities.

110
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,388
Dick-taking abilities? You think
that's good to say about someone?

111
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,787
The fucked-up thing is,
I actually do, okay?

112
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:05,594
If a Woman tried to compliment me on
my dick-giving abilities, I'd be psyched.

113
00:07:05,803 --> 00:07:07,169
Hey, yo, Seth.

114
00:07:09,444 --> 00:07:10,412
What?

115
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:13,643
Did you hear I'm having
a big grad party next Saturday?

116
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:17,025
- No.
- Yeah.

117
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,598
- Oh, shit!
- You're not coming.

118
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:24,504
Tell your fucking faggot friend
he can't come either.

119
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:30,850
So Jesse Wanted me to tell you...

120
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:33,425
...you're a fucking faggot
and can't come to his party.

121
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:35,496
You really bitched out
back there, man.

122
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,032
I bitched out?

123
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:40,003
You bitched out, man,
you fucking Judas.

124
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,405
You fucking left me hanging.

125
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:43,605
Did you Want me to dive
in front of his spit?

126
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:48,752
Come on, guys, let's go!

127
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,285
This is bullshit.

128
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,625
Pussy.

129
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,802
If I equals the square root
of negative one...

130
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:17,580
...then I squared equals
negative one. Okay?

131
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,021
In other Words,
if you consider I as a constant...

132
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:23,998
...you can then define the square roots
of all the negative numbers.

133
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:28,878
So I is an imaginary number.
It doesn't really exist.

134
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,143
If I equals the square root
of negative one...

135
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:34,346
...then I squared equals
negative one.

136
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:37,223
Is this making s...? Okay.

137
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:45,143
- Okay, bye.
- Evan!

138
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:47,151
- Evan, hey.
- Hey, Becca.

139
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:48,946
- Hey, thank you for your pen.
- Hey.

140
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:51,787
No problem. No, no, don't Worry.
No Worries. You keep it.

141
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:55,560
You Won't have to borroW one again
because you'll have that one.

142
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,642
- Thank you so much, that's...
- You're Welcome. Don't Worry about it.

143
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:01,474
So I Was gonna ask you...

144
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:04,176
...did you hear about
Jesse's grad party next Weekend?

145
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:07,953
- It should be fun.
- I heard. L... It's a maybe.

146
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:09,654
- Really?
- For me at the moment.

147
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,396
- My R.S.V.P.
- Just a maybe?

148
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:12,571
So far.

149
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:15,438
There's so much other fun shit
that's gonna be happening...

150
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:18,674
...that I can't really commit and,
you knoW, hurt someone's feelings.

151
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:21,949
Fun shit? But I never see you
at parties or anything.

152
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:25,628
That's because of
all the other fun shit I'm off doing.

153
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,564
I'd love to be at all of them, but...

154
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:29,605
Why Weren't you
at Dimitri's on Saturday?

155
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,300
There Was so many things
going on.

156
00:09:31,513 --> 00:09:33,608
I couldn't find a minute
to make an appearance.

157
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:37,257
- What did you do?
- Saturday Was a crazy night for me.

158
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,267
<i>I had some friends over,</i>
<i>we had a few drinks.</i>

159
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:44,302
<i>That's Vag-tastic!</i>

160
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:47,239
<i>I hung out in my basement,</i>
<i>the chill zone, where we chill-lax.</i>

161
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:50,078
<i>Like "relax" and "chill"</i>
<i>all at once.</i>

162
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:52,679
Seth's parents
Were throWing a party.

163
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:55,829
<i>We got to hang around adults,</i>
<i>which was a nice change of pace.</i>

164
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:59,471
<i>You converse, you talk to people</i>
<i>and they have interesting stories.</i>

165
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:03,339
<i>I talked to a man who claimed he had</i>
<i>climbed five mountains in his life.</i>

166
00:10:03,714 --> 00:10:06,983
Then We Went to a nightclub, Which
Was incredible. This big, fancy one.

167
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:09,955
- Gonna look at tits right noW!
- <i>I'm feeling crazy. I said that.</i>

168
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,629
- <i>You got in?</i>
- <i>We got right in.</i>

169
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,632
- Wanna do this, 'roid monkey?
- Fuck you!

170
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:18,208
<i>Then we called it a night.</i>
<i>We were all just really exhausted.</i>

171
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:20,176
What the fuck?!

172
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:23,617
You Would've loved it. It Was
an incredible, unbelievable night.

173
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,122
That sounds like a lot of fun.

174
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:28,230
You knoW, I'd love to go
do something like that sometime.

175
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:30,061
Who Wouldn't? I mean, it Was like...

176
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,471
...me and Seth are
alWays kind of cooking up these...

177
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:36,309
...fun, sort of,
little, you knoW, events.

178
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:39,250
I guess you guys are really
gonna go crazy next year together.

179
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:42,189
We Were going to,
but We got into different schools.

180
00:10:42,396 --> 00:10:44,424
Really? That sucks.

181
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:47,864
Yeah, I mean, it's not too bad.
I mean, it should be okay.

182
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:49,635
Not too Worried about it, really.

183
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:52,442
Don't Worry about it.
I'm not Worried at all.

184
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,560
- All right, Well, thank you for the pen.
- Yeah. No problem.

185
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:00,632
- Bye.
- Bye.

186
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:03,102
Bye, Evan.

187
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,496
Mrs. HayWorth, I joined this class
because I'd be cooking With a partner.

188
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,265
But she's never here, and I don't get
tWice the grades for doing all the Work.

189
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:21,536
I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.

190
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,776
I knoW, but look at Evan, okay?
Just look at him.

191
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:28,448
Don't keep me Waiting much longer.
I'm getting impatient up here.

192
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:31,463
You knoW What I'm talking about.
Miroki, you're embarrassing me.

193
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:35,073
I'm here in my unit, isolated and alone,
eating my terrible-tasting food...

194
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:36,743
...and I gotta look over at that.

195
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:39,142
Looks like the most fun
I've ever seen in my life.

196
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,482
And it's B.S. Excuse my language.
I'm just saying that I Wash and dry.

197
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:43,818
I'm like a single mother.

198
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:45,997
We all knoW Home Ec is a joke,
no offense.

199
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:49,603
Everyone takes this class to get an A.
It's bullshit, and I'm sorry.

200
00:11:49,806 --> 00:11:52,744
I'm not putting doWn your profession,
but it's just the Way I feel.

201
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,246
I don't Wanna sit here alone
cooking this shitty food.

202
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:59,415
No offense. And I just think
that I don't ever need to cook tiramisu.

203
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:01,357
When am I gonna need
to cook tiramisu?

204
00:12:01,564 --> 00:12:02,931
Am I gonna be a chef? No.

205
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:06,130
There's three Weeks left in school.
Give me a fucking break.

206
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:08,504
I'm sorry for cursing.

207
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:12,015
All right, Jules' partner isn't here
today either.

208
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,655
Pair up With her. Station four.

209
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:15,985
Jules?

210
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:19,063
All right. I'll give it another shot.

211
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:21,262
I'll give Home Ec another shot.

212
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:33,091
Hey, Jules.
Your partner didn't come today?

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,833
- That's kind of a personal question.
- What?

214
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:39,501
Nothing. It's my attempt at humor.
I Was just...

215
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:41,509
Oh, like coming.

216
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:43,777
Like "coming" coming.

217
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:48,329
WoW, that Was a little too far
right there. The gesture.

218
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,434
Yeah. It's pretty far.
Shit, I do that...

219
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,005
No, don't Worry.
I'm actually used to it.

220
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,807
My older brother says, like,
the nastiest shit.

221
00:12:57,015 --> 00:12:59,144
Like he called me "hymen"
until I Was 12.

222
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:01,891
- That's sick. That's not even clever.
- I knoW.

223
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:03,061
I knoW.

224
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:05,825
I Would've gone With something
at least mildly entertaining.

225
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:08,437
You knoW, like... Like...
Like "family Jules."

226
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,048
Or like "nuts." Yeah, that's funny.
That's a fucking funny joke.

227
00:13:13,483 --> 00:13:15,453
Fucking funny.

228
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:19,027
- I can't believe that.
- So, all right. We gotta...

229
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:20,197
...mix it up.

230
00:13:56,107 --> 00:14:00,481
Yeah, HayWorth Will notice this,
if We cover it With chocolate.

231
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:02,979
- The Whole thing?
- Just dump it on. I'm serious.

232
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:04,214
Okay.

233
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:07,896
- And noW it looks professional.
- That's really impressive.

234
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,536
- It's beautifully done.
- I think We're gonna get an A.

235
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:15,138
So, What are you doing tonight?

236
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:17,213
- Probably nothing. Why?
- I don't knoW.

237
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:19,412
My parents are gone
so I'm having a party.

238
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:22,221
I don't really knoW hoW many people
are gonna be there...

239
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,696
...but you could stop by
if you Wanted to.

240
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:27,398
Yeah, I love parties.

241
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:29,435
Really?

242
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:32,147
I just don't really ever
see you at them.

243
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:34,048
You knoW, it's a love-hate thing.

244
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:37,592
So, like, you knoW, right noW,
I really love them, though.

245
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:41,267
- Yeah.
- Good shit, right, Miroki?

246
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,764
Yeah.

247
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:45,604
Hey, Miroki, could We have
a minute alone? Just... Thanks.

248
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:48,376
Dude, Jules is having
a fucking party.

249
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:49,952
Hey!

250
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:53,624
- Don't tell Fogell about the party.
- Gangsters. What's up, guys?

251
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,160
I Was just Walking doWn the hall
and Nicola Was right in front of me.

252
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,308
She's Wearing these tight White pants
With this black G-string...

253
00:15:00,511 --> 00:15:03,540
...and you could see right
through the pants. It Was so sWeet.

254
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,074
It's 10:33.

255
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:19,950
What?

256
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:23,286
I told her What time it Was.

257
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:26,431
That's the coolest fucking story
I've ever heard in my entire life.

258
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:29,196
- Can I hear it again? You have time?
- Yeah, yeah, Seth.

259
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:32,206
I'll miss your knee-slappers
When me and Evan are at Dartmouth.

260
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:34,507
While you guys are at Dartmouth,
I'll be at State...

261
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:37,814
...Where the girls are half as smart
and tWice as likely to fellash me.

262
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:40,426
What are you guys doing tonight?
Asshole.

263
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:42,826
We got nothing.
Nothing tonight, Fogell.

264
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:45,905
No? Well, if nothing comes up,
We can get shitfaced again, yeah?

265
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:48,840
You're alWays calling me a pussy,
but today you're Wrong.

266
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:51,484
At lunch, I'm going to the same place
Mike Snider Went...

267
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:54,055
...to pick up my brand-neW fake ID.

268
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:58,366
Yeah. Fake ID. Fake ID. I'm tight.

269
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:01,004
That's insane. Evan Was like,
"I heard about this party.

270
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:04,144
We shouldn't tell Fogell."
I Was like, "No, We should tell Fogell."

271
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:06,476
You could buy us booze noW.
It's aWesome.

272
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:10,146
Yeah, I'll... Sure, I'll buy the booze.
Yeah, We're gonna get our drinks on.

273
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:12,853
We're gonna party
and get crunk and rock out, dude.

274
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:15,126
If you're not in this class,
leave this class.

275
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:17,499
Fogell! Hi.

276
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:18,767
Okay. Gotta go.

277
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,970
Well done. Seriously.
See you after class.

278
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,314
You tell that idiot
you're not rooming With him?

279
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,488
Not yet. No.

280
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:27,422
All right, Well, you better.
That guy's the fucking anti-poon.

281
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:29,565
Seth, it's dishes time.
What's the holdup?

282
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,028
We're getting a fake ID, so...

283
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:35,006
- It's not like a big deal.
- WoW, that's cool.

284
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:37,340
But you guys have, like,
four more years to go...

285
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,950
...so do you Wanna get to Work?

286
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:41,522
Well, We got into
different schools, so...

287
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:43,821
So you're cutting the cord?
What's gonna happen?

288
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,593
Nothing. Jeez, What does
everybody think is gonna happen?

289
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:49,639
The World's gonna explode if We
don't spend every second together?

290
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,211
I mean, We're not dependent
on each other, you knoW.

291
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:54,817
We met When We Were 8.
We Were fine before then.

292
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,822
I Was. I mean, it's like,
We don't do everything together.

293
00:16:58,027 --> 00:16:59,724
No. All right, I gotta take a piss.

294
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,562
My dick's not gonna shake itself.
Come on, babe.

295
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:07,540
- He's a crack-up.
- I'm just gonna go.

296
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:12,721
Well, at least
We're getting a graduation party.

297
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:14,052
Thank God, man.

298
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:16,128
I'm excited.

299
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:19,794
I Would do terrible, disgusting things
to hook up With Jules.

300
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,771
- Unforgivable things.
- I hear you, man.

301
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:24,107
I'd give my middle nut
to start dating Becca.

302
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:26,217
Becca's a bitch.

303
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,052
You knoW What? I'm seriously
getting fucking sick of you...

304
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,697
...talking about her like that,
if We can be honest.

305
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:33,528
- Me too.
- Why do you hate her so much?

306
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:36,139
You've never given me a reason.
I think you like her.

307
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:39,640
- Fuck no, man! I hate Becca.
- Why, man?

308
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:42,320
Fine, Evan. Here it comes.

309
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:45,322
When I Was a little kid,
I kind of had this problem.

310
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:47,156
And it's not even that big of a deal.

311
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:50,097
Something like 8 percent of kids
do it, but Whatever. It's...

312
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:56,740
For some reason, I don't knoW Why,
I Would just kind of sit around all day...

313
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:00,288
...and draW pictures of dicks.

314
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:03,422
What?

315
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:06,062
DraW pictures of dicks.

316
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:07,805
Dicks?

317
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,807
Like a man dick?

318
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:12,317
Yeah. Like a man dick.

319
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:18,392
<i>I'd sit there for hours, drawing dicks.</i>
<i>I don't know what it was.</i>

320
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,368
<i>I couldn't touch the pen to paper</i>
<i>without drawing the shape of a penis.</i>

321
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:24,839
- <i>That's fucked.</i>
- <i>No shit, it's really fucked up.</i>

322
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:26,308
<i>Here I am, this little kid...</i>

323
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:29,453
<i>... and I can't stop drawing dicks</i>
<i>to save my own life.</i>

324
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,273
All right. I mean, I don't see
What this has to do With Becca.

325
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:43,848
Just listen. Okay?

326
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:47,219
<i>Your precious little Becca</i>
<i>sat next to me for all of fourth grade.</i>

327
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,559
<i>And in the classroom is where</i>
<i>I did the majority of my illustrations.</i>

328
00:18:52,402 --> 00:18:55,603
<i>I was very secretive about this</i>
<i>whole dick operation I had going on.</i>

329
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,370
<i>Even I thought I was fucking crazy.</i>

330
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,243
<i>Imagine what everyone else</i>
<i>would think.</i>

331
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:01,422
<i>So I would stash</i>
<i>all of my dick drawings...</i>

332
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:04,493
<i>... in this</i> Ghostbusters <i>lunchbox</i>
<i>that I had.</i>

333
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:08,898
<i>So one day I'm finishing up this</i>
<i>real big, veiny, triumphant bastard.</i>

334
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:10,198
<i>All of a sudden...

335
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:12,139
Pussy!

336
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,519
You hit Becca's foot With your dick?

337
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:19,454
Yeah. I knoW.

338
00:19:34,993 --> 00:19:35,961
Oh, my God!

339
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:40,430
<i>She starts crying. She flips out.</i>
<i>And she rats me out to the principal.</i>

340
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:43,132
<i>He finds this</i> Ghostbusters <i>lunchbox</i>
<i>dick treasure chest...</i>

341
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:44,744
<i>... and he fucking flips out.</i>

342
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:57,607
<i>He calls in my parents. Turns out this</i>
<i>principal is some religious fanatic...</i>

343
00:19:57,808 --> 00:19:59,971
<i>... and he thinks I'm possessed</i>
<i>by some dick devil.</i>

344
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,619
<i>My parents make me see a therapist,</i>
<i>and he's asking me dick questions.</i>

345
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:06,053
<i>They made me stop eating foods</i>
<i>shaped like dicks.</i>

346
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:07,888
<i>No hot dogs, no Popsicles.</i>

347
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:10,967
You knoW hoW many foods are
shaped like dicks? The best kinds.

348
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,605
Yeah.

349
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:16,346
Well, I don't...
That's really messed up.

350
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,379
- Super gay.
- All right, let's stop this madness.

351
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:22,822
- Let's just go get some dessert.
- I can't, I gotta go meet my counselor.

352
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:25,329
I'm picking out my classes
for next year.

353
00:20:26,335 --> 00:20:30,401
So I gotta sit and eat dessert alone,
like I'm fucking Steven Glanzberg?

354
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:33,548
I gue... Yeah, I mean,
What do you Want me to do?

355
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,681
I don't knoW. Nothing. It's fine.

356
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:41,129
- Just relax, man. I'll see you later.
- That's fine. I'll be fine.

357
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:50,419
Hey, pussy.

358
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,487
Fuck off.

359
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:54,389
Just the one. Just the one. Not both.

360
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:56,225
- So I'll call Andy and Greg.
- Okay.

361
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:58,904
And I'll bring the '80s dance music.

362
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:00,699
- Yeah, yeah.
- Right on.

363
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:03,346
Seth! Hi. There you are.
We Were just talking about you.

364
00:21:03,548 --> 00:21:05,745
- Here I am.
- That's Weird.

365
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:08,686
So you're coming to my party tonight?
Because it's fully on.

366
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,956
Yeah, Why? Should I not come?
Because I could think of other shit...

367
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,659
Oh, no. No.
I Want you to come, I just...

368
00:21:14,872 --> 00:21:18,106
You said something earlier about,
like, a fake ID or something, right?

369
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:20,875
Yeah, I'm gonna get one.
For sure, for sure.

370
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:23,818
I'm getting that for sure.

371
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:26,560
Can you get us booze?

372
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:31,336
Yeah. I can.
I can get you guys alcohol.

373
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,066
- Really? Seriously?
- Yes, for sure.

374
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:34,837
That Would be aWesome.
Thank you.

375
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:37,519
Because We Were Worried about that.
That Would be great.

376
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,385
Plus, you knoW, you scratch
our backs, We'll scratch yours.

377
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,620
Well, Jules, the funny thing
about my back...

378
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:45,325
...is that it's located on my cock.

379
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,845
So you do Want alcohol?
You Want some or no?

380
00:21:50,046 --> 00:21:52,244
You do or you don't?
You do Want alcohol.

381
00:21:52,452 --> 00:21:53,784
- Yeah.
- Either Way.

382
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:55,982
- Well...
- Either Way. Either Way's fine.

383
00:21:56,193 --> 00:21:57,924
This is actually kind of a big favor.

384
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,071
Because my parents left me like
100 bucks to feed myself for the Week.

385
00:22:02,272 --> 00:22:05,472
But the house is full of food,
so I just thought I'd spend it all...

386
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,481
...on, you knoW,
extra drinks for the party, so...

387
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:11,818
That's really nice. I don't think
I've ever done anything that nice.

388
00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:13,553
- It's cool?
- Yeah.

389
00:22:13,764 --> 00:22:14,925
- Okay. Thank you.
- AWesome.

390
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,106
I mean, seriously, that's really...
That's nice of you. Thank you.

391
00:22:18,306 --> 00:22:21,939
So should I just get a shitload
of different shit?

392
00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:25,084
Well, you gotta get me
some Kyle's Killer Lemonade.

393
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:28,522
Kyle's Killer Lemonade. That's kind of
gay, but I can get it for you.

394
00:22:29,063 --> 00:22:31,967
So... Okay, so then
We Will see you tonight.

395
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:33,000
Go to the ball, guys.

396
00:22:33,772 --> 00:22:35,936
Evan. Get into the game.

397
00:22:36,511 --> 00:22:38,414
Kick it over to me.

398
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:40,677
Seth! Get off the field!

399
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:43,051
Get out of here.
They're gonna make me run laps.

400
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:44,454
Just fucking listen, okay?

401
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:48,124
Jules and her stupid fucking friend
asked me to buy her alcohol.

402
00:22:48,337 --> 00:22:51,275
But not just her, for her Whole party.
You knoW What that means?

403
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:54,644
By some miracle, We Were paired up
and she actually thought of me.

404
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:57,550
Thought of me enough to decide
I Was the guy she Would trust...

405
00:22:57,756 --> 00:23:00,557
...With the Whole fun-ness of her party.
She Wants to fuck me.

406
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:03,599
She Wants my dick
in or around her mouth.

407
00:23:03,803 --> 00:23:06,570
Did you think that maybe
she's using you to get her alcohol?

408
00:23:06,775 --> 00:23:09,303
- She doesn't Want your dick.
- Of course I thought of that.

409
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:11,509
The first thing that came
to my mind. Listen.

410
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,815
My older brother alWays says
the nastiest shit.

411
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,495
Like he called me "hymen"
until I Was 12.

412
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:18,188
Seth, I Wanna bloW you.

413
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:20,332
She didn't say that. Come on.

414
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:22,372
She didn't say the second part,
the first...

415
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:24,979
She's got an older brother.
She could have asked him.

416
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:26,776
She looked me in the eyes and said:

417
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:30,720
"Seth, Mom is making a pubie salad.
I need some Seth's OWn dressing."

418
00:23:30,928 --> 00:23:33,296
She's D.T.F.
She's doWn to fuck, man.

419
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:36,164
P in vagi.
She Wants to fuck, man.

420
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:39,037
Tonight is the night
that fucking is an actual possibility.

421
00:23:39,245 --> 00:23:41,876
You sound like an idiot.
You're not gonna sleep With her.

422
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:45,353
No. Dude, I knoW
I talk a lot of shit, okay?

423
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:48,155
But she's gonna be at the party
and she's gonna be drunk.

424
00:23:48,364 --> 00:23:51,769
She likes me at least a little.
At the very least, I'll make out With her.

425
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,965
TWo Weeks, handjob.
Month, bloWjob. Whatever.

426
00:23:54,177 --> 00:23:55,736
And then I make her my girlfriend.

427
00:23:55,947 --> 00:23:57,917
And I've got, like,
tWo solid months of sex.

428
00:23:58,118 --> 00:23:59,712
By the time college rolls around...

429
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:02,189
...l'll be like the Iron Chef
of pounding vag.

430
00:24:02,394 --> 00:24:03,692
Can We talk about this later?

431
00:24:03,897 --> 00:24:05,833
What the fuck, Evan?
We're doWn tWo points.

432
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:07,868
Fucking calm doWn, Greg.
It's soccer.

433
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,666
- It's soccer.
- Fuck you, man.

434
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:12,109
Hey, Greg, Why don't you go
piss your pants again?

435
00:24:12,315 --> 00:24:14,843
- That Was eight years ago, asshole.
- People don't forget.

436
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,115
Do you Wanna hear the best part?
Becca.

437
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:19,125
You do the same thing With her.

438
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,425
When you guys are shitfaced,
you get With her.

439
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:24,402
This is our last party
as high school people.

440
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:27,478
I've ignored my hatred for Becca
in coming up With this plan.

441
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:30,448
I'm flexing nuts. Just fucking
come With me on this voyage...

442
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:32,213
...and stop being a pussy
for once...

443
00:24:32,425 --> 00:24:35,454
...and We can fucking
fuck some girls already.

444
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:38,366
- I should buy Becca alcohol?
- Yeah, it'll be pimp.

445
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:41,441
That Way you knoW she'll be drunk.
You knoW When girls say:

446
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:44,811
"I Was so shitfaced last night.
I shouldn't have fucked that guy."

447
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:46,384
We could be that mistake!

448
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:49,955
Have you talked to Fogell?

449
00:24:50,162 --> 00:24:53,066
All right, you talk to Becca.
I'll talk to that retard, Fogell.

450
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:54,236
Don't Worry.

451
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:57,376
- Seth, get off the field!
- Goal.

452
00:24:57,578 --> 00:24:59,309
- You're getting that!
- No, I'm not!

453
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:05,157
Hey, Becca. Hey, hold up.

454
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:06,329
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

455
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,933
Hi. Did you hear
about the party tonight?

456
00:25:09,136 --> 00:25:11,106
Yeah. Yeah, I just heard.
It sounds aWesome.

457
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:13,277
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going.

458
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:14,810
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm gonna go.

459
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,574
That's Why I came looking for you.

460
00:25:16,786 --> 00:25:18,949
Me and the guys are gonna
go to a liquor store.

461
00:25:19,157 --> 00:25:20,683
And I just thought, you knoW...

462
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,559
...if you needed someone
to get you yours, I could do that.

463
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:25,292
I could be that person.

464
00:25:25,503 --> 00:25:26,733
Yeah.

465
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,432
Yeah, no, that Would be great.

466
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:31,981
That Would save me such a hassle,
because I Was gonna beg my sister.

467
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:34,554
Could you get me, like,
a bottle of Goldslick Vodka?

468
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:37,354
Yeah. That's the one
With the little golden flakes in it?

469
00:25:37,563 --> 00:25:40,228
- Yeah. The girly one.
- That's classy.

470
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:42,166
Well, I'll pay you back at the party.

471
00:25:42,372 --> 00:25:44,103
No, you Won't.
No, it's my treat, miss.

472
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:45,574
- Really?
- Yep. That's that.

473
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,650
It's the first of many too,
so get used to it, sister.

474
00:25:48,854 --> 00:25:51,051
Well, thank you.

475
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,091
Yeah, no problem.

476
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:02,310
- I'm sorry. It Was an accident.
- It's okay.

477
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:05,113
I Was gonna give you a nudge...
A punch, the friend thing.

478
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:06,346
I didn't mean...

479
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:07,992
- Hey, Becca.
- Hey.

480
00:26:08,194 --> 00:26:09,220
- Hey.
- Gaby.

481
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,625
- What's up, Evan?
- Hey, Gaby.

482
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,666
- We should get to class.
- We're gonna go.

483
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,430
- So I Will see you tonight.
- Okay.

484
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:16,201
- Really, don't Worry.
- Okay. Sorry.

485
00:26:16,412 --> 00:26:18,473
- Bye.
- Sorry.

486
00:26:18,683 --> 00:26:20,016
Bye.

487
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:23,151
Sorry.

488
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:33,412
Where's that sack of shit, Fogell?
He said he'd be here.

489
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:35,050
I'm here With my thumb up my ass.

490
00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:37,245
I did it, dude.
I even offered to pay for it.

491
00:26:37,456 --> 00:26:39,323
It Was pimp.
I feel like a pimp right noW.

492
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:42,159
- Like one of those pimps.
- That is fucking pimp.

493
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,533
- That's What I Was afraid of.
- Why didn't I think of that? Shit.

494
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:49,110
Sh... We're screWed.

495
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:50,578
- Okay? We're screWed.
- Okay.

496
00:26:50,784 --> 00:26:52,812
This is What We get
for trusting Fogell, okay?

497
00:26:53,023 --> 00:26:55,186
He pussied out.
I knoW he pussied out.

498
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:57,599
What are you making?

499
00:26:58,134 --> 00:27:02,542
I'm just drilling holes.
The last tWo Weeks. Fuck it.

500
00:27:03,011 --> 00:27:05,505
What do We tell the girls,
We couldn't do the one thing...

501
00:27:05,716 --> 00:27:07,880
...We promised because
We're dickless incompetents?

502
00:27:08,088 --> 00:27:11,185
NoW We're never gonna bone
because of that used tampon, Fogell.

503
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:15,097
HoW'd he get into Dartmouth?
I don't get it. He's got shit for brains.

504
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:17,205
All right,
hoW else can We get alcohol?

505
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:20,141
- Yo, guys! What's up?
- Fogell, Where have you been, man?

506
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,215
You almost gave me
a goddamn heart attack.

507
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:25,619
- Let me see it. Did you pussy out?
- No, no, man. I got it.

508
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:27,887
It's flaWless. Check it.

509
00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:29,293
HaWaii?

510
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,131
All right, that's good.
It's hard to trace, I guess.

511
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:35,710
Wait, you changed your name
to McLovin?

512
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:38,548
- Yeah.
- McLovin?

513
00:27:39,621 --> 00:27:42,719
What kind of a stupid name is that?
Are you an Irish R & B singer?

514
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:45,264
They let you pick any name you Want
When you're there.

515
00:27:45,468 --> 00:27:47,062
And you landed on McLovin?

516
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:49,434
Yeah, it Was betWeen that
or Mohammad.

517
00:27:49,642 --> 00:27:51,806
Why the fuck Would it be
betWeen that or Mohammad?

518
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:54,007
Why not just pick
a common name?

519
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,351
Mohammad is the most common name
on earth. Read a fucking book.

520
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,358
Have you ever met anyone
named Mohammad?

521
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:01,363
Have you ever met anyone
named McLovin?

522
00:28:01,568 --> 00:28:03,663
No, that's Why you picked
a dumb fucking name.

523
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:05,137
- Fuck you.
- Give me that.

524
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:08,748
All right. You look like a future
pedophile in this picture, number one.

525
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,048
Number tWo, it doesn't even have
a first name. It just says McLovin!

526
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:13,351
What? One name?

527
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,123
One name? Who are you, Seal?

528
00:28:16,332 --> 00:28:18,633
Fogell, this ID says
you're 25 years old.

529
00:28:18,838 --> 00:28:20,398
Why Wouldn't you just put 21, man?

530
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,636
Seth, Seth, Seth.
Listen up, ass-face.

531
00:28:22,847 --> 00:28:26,343
Every day, hundreds of kids go into
the liquor store With their fake IDs...

532
00:28:26,555 --> 00:28:28,354
...and every single one
says they're 21.

533
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,290
HoW many 21 -year-olds
are in this toWn?

534
00:28:30,496 --> 00:28:31,897
It's called fucking strategy.

535
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:34,263
Let's stay calm, okay?
Let's not lose our heads.

536
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:37,602
It's a fine ID. It'll... It's gonna Work.
It's passable, okay?

537
00:28:37,812 --> 00:28:40,339
This isn't terrible.
I mean, it's up to you, Fogell.

538
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:43,079
This guy's gonna think,
"Here's a kid With a fake ID"...

539
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:47,527
...or "Here's McLovin, the 25-year-old
HaWaiian organ donor."

540
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:49,896
Okay? So, What's it gonna be?

541
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,931
I am McLovin.

542
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:55,609
No, you're not. No one's McLovin.
McLovin's never existed...

543
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,188
...because that's a made-up, dumb,
fucking fairy-tale name, you fuck!

544
00:28:59,391 --> 00:29:01,726
Jeez, man. It'll Work.
Give it a chance.

545
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,296
Did you move my...?

546
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,763
Where is my car?

547
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:06,370
Oh, my God, man.

548
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:08,942
What did I say to you?
I told you not to park here.

549
00:29:09,145 --> 00:29:11,548
Why Would you park
in the staff parking lot?

550
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,049
Shut the fuck up, Fogell.

551
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,816
I mean, because you're not staff.

552
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:19,558
I knoW that, Fagell! I knoW that!

553
00:29:21,972 --> 00:29:23,839
Evan, let's go to your house.

554
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:27,610
Wait, are you guys
still picking me up from Work?

555
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,614
Can you ansWer me?

556
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:37,165
Man, don't you have
any non-infant clothes?

557
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,208
- It'll be fine.
- Yeah.

558
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:41,572
Why don't you just Wear
What you Wore to school?

559
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,844
I can't do that. I can't let Jules
see me in What I Wore to school.

560
00:29:45,054 --> 00:29:46,489
It's completely unbecoming.

561
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:50,096
No one's gotten a handjob
in cargo shorts since Nam.

562
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:53,169
I have to kill these guys.
You don't negotiate With terrorists.

563
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:56,209
Really? Yeah, that's What
We should be talking about right noW.

564
00:29:56,412 --> 00:29:58,883
Then Why don't you go
and get some of your oWn clothes?

565
00:29:59,084 --> 00:30:00,451
That's the dumbest thing ever.

566
00:30:00,654 --> 00:30:03,785
My parents Will see that my car's
been toWed and I'll be grounded.

567
00:30:03,995 --> 00:30:06,124
These fucking terrorists
multiply like bunnies.

568
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:07,632
Where did I leave the M16?

569
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:11,241
Do you have any bigger clothes
or do you only shop at babyGap?

570
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:13,676
Fuck me. I can't...

571
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,483
That's fun.
Why do they make that?

572
00:30:16,688 --> 00:30:19,751
If you can't even Win,
then Why am I fucking playing?

573
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:21,726
Do you Wanna go see
What my dad has?

574
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,348
<i>What the fuck?</i>

575
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:51,988
What the hell is that?

576
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:54,133
It's a fucking vest, dumbass.

577
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:56,806
- I'm trying to look older.
- You look like Pinocchio.

578
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:59,501
- It's just a vest.
- They got a lot of booze in there.

579
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:02,686
If We get it noW, We can get
to the party faster With Jules' shit.

580
00:31:02,887 --> 00:31:05,084
No Way, man. I Work there.
They knoW I'm not 25.

581
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,319
Nobody said anything about you,
dick-mouth.

582
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,557
You really fucked me on this one.

583
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,567
So noW I'm gonna steal the booze.

584
00:31:11,772 --> 00:31:14,539
Don't do this.
I promise you I'll get the liquor later.

585
00:31:14,745 --> 00:31:17,046
Mike Snider's ID alWays Works.
So Will mine, man.

586
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,690
Mike Snider's ID doesn't have
one fucking name on it! Okay?

587
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:24,490
I thought you Dartmouth guys Would
be smart enough to understand that.

588
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,368
NoW Seth's gotta
pick up all the pieces.

589
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:29,235
He Won't do it. Don't Worry.

590
00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:32,643
I forgot to tell you, my mom said We
can have the TV from the basement...

591
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,546
Shut the fuck up,
he's gonna hear you.

592
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:36,553
Just be quiet.
Wait until he goes aWay.

593
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:39,321
You still haven't told him
that We're rooming together?

594
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:40,966
Fogell, shut the fuck up.

595
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:43,263
And take off your vest.
You look like Aladdin.

596
00:31:43,472 --> 00:31:46,171
Okay. You got it.

597
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,958
Hope piggy can run.

598
00:32:13,236 --> 00:32:14,728
HoW old are you?

599
00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:16,499
TWenty-tWo.

600
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,641
You certainly are.
That'll be 80 dollars.

601
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:21,948
Okay.

602
00:32:22,155 --> 00:32:24,456
Thank you kindly. Will that do?

603
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,857
Certainly Will. Thank you, Seth.

604
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:29,036
Hey, thank you.

605
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:41,093
You dropped your purse, ma'am.

606
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:42,730
Would you like some help?

607
00:32:42,932 --> 00:32:45,130
Well, that Would be lovely,
young man.

608
00:32:45,337 --> 00:32:48,434
Would you like me
to buy you alcohol?

609
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:50,938
That Would be lovely.

610
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,712
- Enjoy your remaining years.
- I Will.

611
00:32:53,922 --> 00:32:57,224
- Enjoy fucking Jules.
- I Will.

612
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,198
Don't do it, kid.

613
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:23,351
I never had a choice.

614
00:33:31,502 --> 00:33:33,335
You fucking killed her!

615
00:33:34,408 --> 00:33:35,376
No!

616
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,704
Where's all the stolen liquor?
Did you hide it up your butt?

617
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:51,707
Piss off! I Was gonna do it,
but there Was a security breach.

618
00:33:51,912 --> 00:33:53,141
You never Would've done it.

619
00:33:53,348 --> 00:33:56,583
Let's go to a liquor store
and Watch your stupid ID get rejected.

620
00:33:56,788 --> 00:33:59,225
Wait, I'm gonna go put my vest
back in my locker.

621
00:34:26,352 --> 00:34:27,980
All right. Here We are. This is it.

622
00:34:28,189 --> 00:34:29,487
- You ready? Yeah?
- Yeah.

623
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:34,098
- Here's the money and the list.
- Change is yours. Keep the change.

624
00:34:34,302 --> 00:34:37,365
- Thank you. What's the list for?
- The alcohol.

625
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,479
We're gonna get alcohol
for the Whole party, okay?

626
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:43,347
We put a lot of time into this list,
so don't fuck it up.

627
00:34:43,555 --> 00:34:44,523
It's perfect.

628
00:34:44,724 --> 00:34:48,061
Ouzo, bourbon,
spiced rum, Goldslick...

629
00:34:48,264 --> 00:34:50,735
Goldslick Vodka. That's for Becca.
Don't forget that.

630
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:53,673
Raspberry vodka, Scotch...

631
00:34:53,877 --> 00:34:55,642
And Kyle's Killer Lemonade.
A six-pack.

632
00:34:55,848 --> 00:34:58,752
This is a lot. I don't knoW
if I can get aWay With all this.

633
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:00,355
What difference does it make?

634
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,928
I don't knoW, man.
I'm, like, really nervous.

635
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:07,003
- Are you okay?
- No, man. I should have Wore the vest.

636
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,539
- Calm doWn.
- What the fuck are you doing?

637
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:11,610
What if I go in
and they turn me doWn, man?

638
00:35:11,815 --> 00:35:13,682
Then We're in the same place
We're in noW.

639
00:35:13,886 --> 00:35:15,583
- Who cares?
- It's fucking humiliating!

640
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,589
Everybody sees them
kicking me out.

641
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:20,892
What if they make me
put the liquor back? I can't do that.

642
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:23,470
This Whole thing
is bigger than you, Fogell!

643
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:27,044
So groW a pair of nuts and fucking
Walk in there and buy the alcohol!

644
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:29,779
What if I don't feel like it
anymore, Seth? What?

645
00:35:29,986 --> 00:35:31,785
Then I'll fucking kill you, okay?

646
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,961
I'll stab you
through your fucking heart.

647
00:35:34,162 --> 00:35:35,654
No, you can do this, man.
Come on.

648
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:38,736
Killing me Won't get you alcohol.
I'm the one With the fake ID.

649
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:40,932
Then I'll cut
your dumb fucking face off...

650
00:35:41,144 --> 00:35:44,241
...throW it over mine and get your ID
and buy it my fucking self!

651
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,321
Oh, really? You don't have
the technology or the steady hands...

652
00:35:47,524 --> 00:35:49,494
...to pull off a procedure like that,
so ha!

653
00:35:49,695 --> 00:35:51,187
Peace.

654
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,361
Fogell, just be cool, man.
Get in and get out.

655
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:55,540
You're the hero.

656
00:35:58,347 --> 00:35:59,816
Sorry.

657
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:31,609
Is there a problem here, sir?

658
00:36:31,818 --> 00:36:35,154
No. No problem Whatsoever.

659
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:41,030
Sir, did you do this? On the floor?

660
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:42,707
No.

661
00:36:42,908 --> 00:36:44,537
And you should really clean this up.

662
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:46,909
Someone could really
hurt themselves.

663
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:50,554
Fuck my life.

664
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:52,593
We're so fucked.
We're so fucked.

665
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:54,628
This plan's been fucked
since Jump Street.

666
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:57,430
Okay, just calm doWn.
Just calm doWn, all right?

667
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:00,706
Hey, so did you bring a condom
for tonight?

668
00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:02,850
You brought a condom With you?

669
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:04,918
Yeah. I figured
I might as Well, you knoW?

670
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:07,650
I brought a little bottle
of spermicidal lube too.

671
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:13,033
You laughed in my face
When I said I'd be having sex tonight.

672
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,540
That doesn't mean
you shouldn't alWays be prepared.

673
00:37:15,744 --> 00:37:18,045
- You didn't even bring a condom?
- No.

674
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,049
No, Evan,
that Wasn't part of the plan.

675
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:22,281
You did this
Without consulting With me.

676
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:26,159
We've never discussed, like, any plan,
but you keep saying We have a plan.

677
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:29,305
I had, like, a general outline.
You knoW?

678
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:32,308
I Was gonna go doWn on her
for, like, several hours, okay?

679
00:37:32,513 --> 00:37:35,417
She Would love that. She'd be smitten.
She'd go out With that.

680
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:37,316
Or I dry hump the shit out of her leg.

681
00:37:37,524 --> 00:37:40,553
Well, I just... I don't see the harm
in bringing one little condom.

682
00:37:40,764 --> 00:37:42,894
And one little bottle
of spermicidal lube?

683
00:37:43,103 --> 00:37:45,540
Yeah, one little bottle
of spermicidal lube.

684
00:37:45,742 --> 00:37:48,543
- Evan, that's psycho shit, man.
- No, it's not.

685
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:50,377
That's, like, Charles Manson shit.

686
00:37:50,585 --> 00:37:53,683
What, do you think Becca's gonna be
psyched that you brought lube?

687
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:57,297
"Oh, Evan. Thank you for bringing
that lube for my pussy.

688
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,597
I never Would've been able to handle
your fucking 4-inch dick...

689
00:38:00,807 --> 00:38:03,904
...inside my pussy
Without that gigantic bottle of lube."

690
00:38:04,113 --> 00:38:05,742
- Okay, that's... That's enough.
- Fuck.

691
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,581
These girls are 18,
they're not dried-up old ladies.

692
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:10,784
- They're good to go.
- Then I Won't bring the lube.

693
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:13,968
Don't make me feel like that.
I thought it Was cool.

694
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:16,469
- This is a nice kind.
- Let me see that for a second.

695
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:18,667
- An impressive kind.
- It is kind of cool.

696
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:20,575
- That's cool.
- Fucking dumbass. Lube?

697
00:38:20,782 --> 00:38:22,149
- That's funny.
- You brought lube?

698
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:25,587
You oWe me 6 bucks because I'm not
Walking over to get it and it exploded.

699
00:38:27,297 --> 00:38:29,494
Hello, Mindy.

700
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:44,791
I love that stuff.
Been drinking it for years.

701
00:38:46,203 --> 00:38:50,542
You knoW, I heard they recently
decided to add more hops to it.

702
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:56,017
Okay.

703
00:38:56,224 --> 00:38:58,718
I'm gonna need to see
some identification.

704
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:02,200
Really?

705
00:39:02,404 --> 00:39:04,636
Makes me feel young again.
There you go.

706
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:09,512
Oh, shit, it's Cary Hutchins.

707
00:39:12,192 --> 00:39:14,162
She had the biggest tits
I've ever seen.

708
00:39:14,362 --> 00:39:16,195
I heard she got
breast-reduction surgery.

709
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:18,064
What? Making your tits smaller?

710
00:39:18,271 --> 00:39:21,334
That's like slapping God
for giving you a gorgeous gift.

711
00:39:21,545 --> 00:39:22,808
She had back problems, man.

712
00:39:23,014 --> 00:39:26,112
And it's not just making them smaller.
They completely reshape them.

713
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,258
They make them
more supple and symmetrical.

714
00:39:29,027 --> 00:39:30,929
I gotta catch a glimpse
of these Warlocks.

715
00:39:31,131 --> 00:39:32,691
Let's make a move.

716
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,105
- She's going around the corner.
- Come on!

717
00:39:42,522 --> 00:39:45,460
Okay. Your total is 96.59.

718
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:56,680
I don't believe it!

719
00:39:57,621 --> 00:39:59,648
Are you okay, mister?

720
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,590
What the shit Was that?

721
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:07,165
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

722
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:10,011
I don't believe it.

723
00:40:10,214 --> 00:40:12,583
I don't knoW, man.
I think she looked better before.

724
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:16,192
But noW that she can jog comfortably,
she's in the best shape she's ever...

725
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:21,333
What is this? What's that?

726
00:40:24,078 --> 00:40:25,341
Oh, man.

727
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:32,151
Holy shit, they busted Fogell.

728
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:35,165
HoW did this happen, Evan?
Fuck, man!

729
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:36,860
His dad's gonna fucking kill him.

730
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:38,233
Look, okay?

731
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:41,846
He assaulted the customer,
grabbed the cash and ran out.

732
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:43,017
So...

733
00:40:43,218 --> 00:40:44,847
- HoW...?
- HoW...? HoW...? HoW...?

734
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:48,460
- Say When, height-Wise.
- I'm gonna start up here, tell me When.

735
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:50,895
- I'll start on the bottom and...
- When.

736
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:53,128
Whatever 5'10" is,
he Was 5'10".

737
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,005
Ethnically, I mean, did... What...?

738
00:40:57,214 --> 00:41:01,781
I mean, Was he...?
Was he like us, or...?

739
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:04,459
A Woman?

740
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:05,689
- Female?
- No.

741
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,394
- Is that What you're asking?
- No, no. Was he...?

742
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:09,573
- Like...
- What? What?

743
00:41:09,774 --> 00:41:10,742
- African?
- Af... Af...

744
00:41:10,944 --> 00:41:12,469
- Was he African?
- African.

745
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,742
No. He Was American,
and he Was like you.

746
00:41:14,952 --> 00:41:17,822
- He looked just like you.
- He Was JeWish. Okay, JeW.

747
00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:20,519
- It's an odd crime for a JeW.
- They're pretty docile.

748
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:24,330
Okay, so We have an African JeW
Wearing a hoodie.

749
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:28,070
No, you don't. No. That's not What
I said. Is that What you heard me say?

750
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,081
I said he looked like you.
Do you look like an African JeW?

751
00:41:31,955 --> 00:41:34,119
- No, I look like a cop.
- Yeah.

752
00:41:35,462 --> 00:41:37,660
He Was Caucasian.

753
00:41:37,868 --> 00:41:39,633
- Caucasian.
- All right.

754
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:40,806
- Okay.
- Well, touch.

755
00:41:41,007 --> 00:41:43,342
Kind of looked like Eminem.
Does that help you?

756
00:41:43,546 --> 00:41:44,514
- An M&M.
- An M&M.

757
00:41:44,716 --> 00:41:47,415
- So he Was circular...?
- Marshall Mathers. Eminem?

758
00:41:47,622 --> 00:41:50,822
- The rapper, Eminem.
- Did he look like this?

759
00:41:51,363 --> 00:41:53,857
- I'm an amateur. I kind of...
- That looks like an M&M.

760
00:41:54,068 --> 00:41:58,442
Longer face? Bigger nose?
Would you say his mouth Was Wider?

761
00:41:58,645 --> 00:42:00,012
Open? A gap?

762
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:05,055
Is there another squad car in the area
that could be of further assistance?

763
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:06,887
I don't seem to be getting any.

764
00:42:07,096 --> 00:42:10,000
Okay, so just Walk me through again
What this guy did.

765
00:42:10,202 --> 00:42:13,266
He... He... He came in, he's Wielding...

766
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:17,747
He's Wielding something. He hits
this small gentleman in the slacks.

767
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:20,982
And then he jumps over you,
he feels you up, violates you.

768
00:42:21,193 --> 00:42:22,855
- I did not say that.
- No, he doesn't.

769
00:42:23,064 --> 00:42:26,697
Look, I can't do this. I told you already,
I have an exam tomorroW.

770
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:30,242
Can you understand that?
I have a goddamn veterinary exam!

771
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,580
Goddamn it. This is bullshit.

772
00:42:33,786 --> 00:42:36,519
This is some bullshit.
I got an exam tomorroW. Forget this.

773
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:38,593
Well, apparently someone
has an exam.

774
00:42:38,796 --> 00:42:40,459
HoW'd you knoW?

775
00:42:41,335 --> 00:42:42,964
You. You're the one
that got punched?

776
00:42:43,172 --> 00:42:44,801
- Yeah.
- Okay.

777
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,379
First things first.
What is your name?

778
00:42:51,256 --> 00:42:52,987
My name?

779
00:42:53,194 --> 00:42:56,998
It's M... McLov... McLovin.

780
00:42:57,603 --> 00:42:59,072
McLovin?

781
00:42:59,273 --> 00:43:00,640

784
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:06,652
- Your first name?
- My first name?

785
00:43:07,925 --> 00:43:12,594
Technically I don't have a first name,
so don't Worry about my first name.

786
00:43:13,671 --> 00:43:15,834
But We're the police.

787
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:17,875

00:43:20,786 --> 00:43:23,188
- Come on!
- He must be so afraid.

790
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:26,364
I don't believe this bullshit.
I can't believe this is happening!

791
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:30,061
I didn't knoW you could get arrested

796
00:43:40,695 --> 00:43:42,858
Why are you talking about money?
What about Fogell?

797
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:46,734
That doesn't matter anymore. I lost
a hundred dollars of Jules' money.

798
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:50,506
Are We gonna bust him out of jail?
Bake a cake With a fucking file in it?

799
00:43:50,716 --> 00:43:54,782
Fuck Fogell. We need a neW Way to
get liquor, Which is fucking impossible.

800
00:43:54,992 --> 00:43:57,896

So it's just McLovin?

808
00:44:21,615 --> 00:44:23,175
Yeah.

809
00:44:23,954 --> 00:44:26,151

810
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:27,588

811
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:30,494
- Lot of people With Weird names.
- Chingy. Shakira.

812
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,136
Rafe. Pax.

813
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:35,470
We arrested a man-lady
Who Was legally named "Fuck."

814
00:44:35,678 --> 00:44:37,545
Think he Was Vietnamese,
it Was With a P-H.

815
00:44:37,749 --> 00:44:39,719
But it's still shocking
to see on a license.

816
00:44:39,921 --> 00:44:43,451
- Okay, and hoW old are you, McLovin?
- Old enough.

817
00:44:44,864 --> 00:44:46,333
Old enough for What?

- You're an organ donor.

822
00:45:27,488 --> 00:45:29,185
I didn't Wanna, but my Wife insisted.

823
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:31,157
I give him shit for it too. All the time.

824
00:45:31,363 --> 00:45:34,393
I say, "It's just like a Woman.
Even after you're dead...

825
00:45:34,603 --> 00:45:37,666
...they Wanna tear your heart out."
- They Wanna tear your...

826
00:45:37,877 --> 00:45:40,644

00:45:45,794 --> 00:45:48,356
He just hit me,

830
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:50,934
- I don't knoW if I can help you.
- You in a hurry?

831
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:53,166
Yeah, kind of had to catch that bus.

832
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:57,077
- Where Were you headed?
- Near 13th and Granville.

833
00:45:57,886 --> 00:46:00,687
- We can take you there.

834
00:46:00,893 --> 00:46:03,159

Name anything. Name it. Name it.

00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:25,840
All right, look. Hey, man. All right.

Listen, you can trust me, okay?

You promised Becca

00:48:40,197 --> 00:48:42,794
- Hey, Jules.
- Who is it? Who's on the phone?

890
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,472
Seth. Hey, Where are you?

891
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:48,135
I'm in a cab right noW,
on the Way to a liquor store.

892
00:48:48,348 --> 00:48:50,147
Good. I can't Wait
for you to get here.

893
00:48:50,352 --> 00:48:52,880
Well, I hope your friends
are ready to get fucked up.

894
00:48:54,494 --> 00:48:55,723
<i>I'm sure they will be.</i>

895
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:58,128
- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- <i>Peace.</i>

896
00:48:59,104 --> 00:49:00,903
Oh, man! Dude, this is crazy.

897
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:03,841
She called, she said,
"I can't Wait for you to get there."

898
00:49:04,048 --> 00:49:06,986
That sounds like
she fully Wants it, man! Oh, yeah!

899
00:49:07,188 --> 00:49:11,687
Who's gonna give it to her, huh,
my man? You, that's Who.

900
00:49:11,897 --> 00:49:14,095
Man.

901
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:16,133
You guys on MySpace, or...?

902
00:49:29,235 --> 00:49:33,266
Officers? I can ansWer those
questions noW if you Want me to.

903
00:49:33,477 --> 00:49:36,506
We get the gist of it. You Were
buying beer, some guys punched you.

904
00:49:36,717 --> 00:49:38,915
Don't Worry about it.
We're not gonna find them.

905
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:41,685
- Case closed.
- But it Was only...

906
00:49:53,085 --> 00:49:56,581
- But it Was only one guy.
- Only one guy? Shit.

907
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:58,387
HoW am I supposed to
find one guy?

908
00:49:58,597 --> 00:50:02,037
This job really isn't hoW, you knoW,
shoWs like <i>CSI</i> make it out to be.

909
00:50:02,238 --> 00:50:05,871
When I first joined the force, I assumed
there Was semen on everything...

910
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,550
...and there Was some, like,
huge semen database...

911
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:11,918
...that had every bad guy's semen in it.
There isn't. That doesn't exist.

912
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:14,926
I often go to sleep and dream of
Waking up in a World Where...

913
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:17,568
...everything's covered in semen.
- I mean, Who doesn't?

914
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,741
Lt'd be nice.
Like that crime scene today.

915
00:50:19,942 --> 00:50:22,379
If the man had ejaculated
and then punched you...

916
00:50:22,581 --> 00:50:24,210
...We'd have a shot at catching him.

917
00:50:24,418 --> 00:50:26,650
- No Way.
- Just punched in the face, no semen.

918
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,350
- No semen.
- Story of my life.

919
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:38,378
Michaels here, he's six months in.

920
00:50:39,217 --> 00:50:41,619
He's young,
but the Force is strong With this one.

921
00:50:41,821 --> 00:50:44,224

923

- Are you familiar With Yoda?

924
00:50:49,873 --> 00:50:51,364
From <i>Attack of the Clones?</i>

925
00:50:51,575 --> 00:50:55,641
<i>We have a 245 at East 24 and</i>
<i>Montgomery, Bailey's Bar and Grill.</i>

926
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:57,821
Car 98 on it.

927
00:50:58,023 --> 00:51:00,961
See, Michaels, you alWays
take a call at a bar because...

928
00:51:01,163 --> 00:51:03,225
...better or Worse,
you get a beer out of it.

929
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,229
Pretty sWeet, huh?

930
00:51:05,439 --> 00:51:07,534
- True that. Amazing thinking.
- Hey, McLovin.

931
00:51:07,744 --> 00:51:10,807
We got a situation at Bailey's,
so We'll drop you off after, all right?

932
00:51:11,017 --> 00:51:13,045
Actually, I kind of
have to be someWhere...

933
00:51:13,255 --> 00:51:16,318
- SWeet. Sit tight.

934

Engage.

935
00:51:23,577 --> 00:51:24,807
Yeah.

936
00:51:25,013 --> 00:51:28,076
Welcome to the Thunderdome.

937
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:32,856
Hey, man, are you sure it's cool
that We're here With you?

938
00:51:33,064 --> 00:51:34,397
Oh, definitely, man.

- We are gonna rock out.

943
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:46,826
What's up? What's up? What's up?

944
00:51:48,062 --> 00:51:50,465
Hello, hello. Hey, guys.

945
00:52:08,272 --> 00:52:10,401
This is something
a smart person Wouldn't do.

946
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:13,241
Look, just act cool and act casual,
and try and look old.

947
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:16,114
We'll get the booze
and get the fuck out of here, okay?

948
00:52:20,064 --> 00:52:22,193

1104
01:02:16,651 --> 01:02:21,525
...and next thing I knoW, she's putting
her mouth around the tip of my penis.

1105
01:02:22,329 --> 01:02:24,356

Under!

1183
01:06:40,266 --> 01:06:42,463
I feel hammered.
That doesn't make any sense.

1184
01:06:42,671 --> 01:06:45,268
- You're a fucking pussy.
- Okay, okay. Great, great.

1185
01:06:45,477 --> 01:06:48,939
- Okay, McLovin, see if you can do it.
- The kid's gonna nail it.

1186
01:06:49,151 --> 01:06:52,021
Come on, McLovin.
Do it, buddy. Come on, buddy!

1187
01:06:52,225 --> 01:06:54,822
- Bring it!
- 0.08, motherfuckers!

1188
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:57,695
- Man!
- That's my boy!

1189
01:06:58,103 --> 01:07:00,038
- Yes!
- Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck.

1190
01:07:00,908 --> 01:07:03,710
So, What's it like to have guns?

1191
01:07:03,915 --> 01:07:06,614
It is aWesome, McLovin.

1192
01:07:06,821 --> 01:07:08,484
- I mean, it's mindbl...
- It's great.

1193
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,424
I haven't had one for long,
a feW months, but I'll tell you...

1194
01:07:11,631 --> 01:07:13,396
...it's like having tWo cocks.
- Yup.

1195
01:07:13,602 --> 01:07:16,437
If one of your cocks
could kill someone.

1196
01:07:17,543 --> 01:07:20,106
- Can I hold one?
- What?

1197
01:07:20,315 --> 01:07:21,614
Can I hold one of your guns?

1198
01:07:24,891 --> 01:07:27,955
- Yeah, sure.
- Fine With me. Why not?

1199
01:07:28,165 --> 01:07:30,466
Everyone should hold a gun
at least a couple times.

1200
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:32,106
Yeah, there you go.

1201
01:07:32,308 --> 01:07:34,642
- Have a blast.
- "Have a blast."

1202
01:07:34,847 --> 01:07:39,015
- That's funny.
- I've never held one of these before.

1203
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:41,956
- Are they hard to shoot?
- Lf you're Michaels, they are.

1204
01:07:42,162 --> 01:07:43,859
- He can't shoot Worth dick.
- What?

1205
01:07:44,066 --> 01:07:45,558
I can shoot. What are you...? Wait.

1206
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:48,069
- I can't shoot Worth dick?
- You cannot shoot.

1207
01:07:48,275 --> 01:07:50,711
- I shot that cat last Week.
- It Was already dead, man.

1208
01:07:50,914 --> 01:07:52,472
- I still shot it.
- That cat Was dead.

1209
01:07:52,683 --> 01:07:54,550
There's only one Way
to settle this, guys.

1210
01:07:55,121 --> 01:07:56,613
- Shoot-off.
- Shoot-off.

1211
01:07:56,825 --> 01:07:59,661
- Shoot-off!
- Shoot-off!

1212
01:07:59,865 --> 01:08:01,562
There's a lot of reasons
Why I like you.

1213
01:08:01,769 --> 01:08:04,069
I mean, you're handsome
and you're a good friend.

1214
01:08:04,275 --> 01:08:08,306
Dude, there he is. That's the guy.
Hey, Mark, right there.

1215
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:11,245
Oh, you got a stain too.

1216
01:08:13,092 --> 01:08:15,255
- We're blood brothers.
- Shut the fuck up.

1217
01:08:15,463 --> 01:08:17,991
You're in my house,
you ansWer my questions.

1218
01:08:18,202 --> 01:08:20,104
What Were you doing
dancing With Jacinda?

1219
01:08:22,813 --> 01:08:24,076
I don't even dance. I just...

1220
01:08:24,282 --> 01:08:26,810
I don't even dance ever, so...
I've never even tried it.

1221
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:29,685
Then Where the hell did this
come from, asshole?

1222
01:08:31,163 --> 01:08:33,691
Maybe you and I rubbed up against
each other at some point.

1223
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:36,874
I don't remember. Maybe it Was
some ricochet scenario. I don't knoW.

1224
01:08:37,076 --> 01:08:39,103
- HoW am I supposed to knoW?
- Kick his ass, Mark.

1225
01:08:39,313 --> 01:08:41,078
Shut the fuck up, Scarlett.

1226
01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:44,651
Where do you get off
dancing With my fiance?

1227
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:54,169
To some girl.

1228
01:09:07,572 --> 01:09:08,904
Talk about the hurting.

1229
01:09:19,164 --> 01:09:20,599
- Shit.
- All right.

1230
01:09:43,613 --> 01:09:45,276
- Yo! Fight!

1231
01:09:45,484 --> 01:09:47,215
- Go, check this out!
- Oh, fuck!

1232
01:09:47,422 --> 01:09:49,392
And What the hell is this?

1233
01:09:49,893 --> 01:09:53,196
- I don't fucking... It's detergent.
- Yeah, What are you doing With it?

1234
01:09:54,971 --> 01:09:58,001
I got fucking blood on my pants.

1235
01:09:58,211 --> 01:09:59,737
Get doWn.

1236
01:10:01,752 --> 01:10:04,189
What the fuck is this all about, man?
Are you...?

1237
01:10:05,226 --> 01:10:08,562
- Well, fuck me.
- Fellas.

1238
01:10:09,134 --> 01:10:12,106
Oh, shit,
I've been tackled by little girls!

1239
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:13,401
You die! You're next!

1240
01:10:16,148 --> 01:10:20,920
I should fucking kill you,
you motherfucker!

1241
01:10:21,126 --> 01:10:25,089
- Hold him, Jimmy's brother! Hold him!
- What do you mean? No. No Way!

1242
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:27,032
- You humiliated me!
- I'm sorry!

1243
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:30,803
- You used my leg as a tampon!
- I'm calling the cops.

1244
01:10:31,013 --> 01:10:35,716
Evan! Come on! Move!

1245
01:10:35,956 --> 01:10:38,587
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1246
01:10:38,795 --> 01:10:42,964
Yeah. Fifth and PaysvieW. Hurry.

1247
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:45,904
Mark, I called the cops.
You should hide your gun.

1248
01:10:46,144 --> 01:10:47,737
You're a fucking pussy.

1249
01:10:47,948 --> 01:10:49,177
Don't listen to him, officer.

1250
01:10:49,384 --> 01:10:51,820
If you make this,
We're no longer friends, Michaels.

1251
01:10:52,055 --> 01:10:54,458
- You're a fucking pussy.
- Cheating. You're cheating.

1252
01:10:55,596 --> 01:11:00,266
- Fuck me.
- Oh, suck on my nuts, Slater!

1253
01:11:00,474 --> 01:11:02,307
All right, you...
That Was a lucky shot.

1254
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:05,678
- That Was a lucky shot.

1255
01:11:05,885 --> 01:11:07,114
I got jizzed on. All right.

1256
01:11:07,355 --> 01:11:09,382
- Can I shoot one?
- Yeah, go nuts. Go nuts.

1257
01:11:09,593 --> 01:11:11,062
Have a good time, man.

1258
01:11:11,263 --> 01:11:14,167
Empty the clip.
Empty the clip on it, man. Shit!

1262
01:11:33,343 --> 01:11:35,780
- Man, let's get drunk!

1263
01:11:35,981 --> 01:11:38,076
You're fucking living the dream,

1264
01:11:38,286 --> 01:11:39,254
Oh, man.

1265
01:11:39,456 --> 01:11:41,187
This is gonna be the best night ever.

1266
01:11:41,393 --> 01:11:43,829
- <i>Got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview.</i>
- Shit.

1267
01:11:44,031 --> 01:11:46,399
<i>All units in the area report</i>
<i>to Fifth and Paysview.</i>

1268
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:48,903
- <i>Car 98, that's you. Do it.</i>

1271
01:11:54,854 --> 01:11:57,849
Hey, did she say We're gonna get
to shoot somebody or something?

1272
01:11:58,061 --> 01:11:59,359
Oh, God, I Wish.

1273
01:11:59,597 --> 01:12:02,967
It's probably some lame house party.
We'll drop you off after. Cool?

1274
01:12:03,203 --> 01:12:05,470
Yeah, man.
Let's shoW these fuckers hoW We roll!

1275
01:12:20,173 --> 01:12:23,807
- You fucking prick.
- What?

1276
01:12:26,754 --> 01:12:30,694
- You bailed on me.
- I didn't bail on you.

1277
01:12:30,895 --> 01:12:32,957
Yeah, you did.

1278
01:12:33,167 --> 01:12:36,003
You said you Were gonna
do something and you didn't do it.

1279
01:12:36,207 --> 01:12:37,334
That's bailing.

1280
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:40,777
You're the one that dragged me to
that fucking party With those lunatics.

1281
01:12:40,983 --> 01:12:45,948
- I didn't bail on you.
- You bailed on me, okay?

1282
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:48,563
You bailed on me this morning
When Jesse spat on me...

1283
01:12:48,766 --> 01:12:50,394
...and you're bailing on me
next year.

1284
01:12:50,604 --> 01:12:53,667
What the fuck? It finally comes out.
That's good, man.

1285
01:12:53,877 --> 01:12:55,813
We Were supposed to go
to college together.

1286
01:12:56,047 --> 01:12:58,108
Since We Were kids,
since elementary school...

1287
01:12:58,318 --> 01:13:00,755
...that's all We've ever talked about,

1288
01:13:00,957 --> 01:13:02,586
And you got into
fucking Dartmouth.

1289
01:13:02,794 --> 01:13:04,788
You're making me feel
like I'm a bad guy.

1290
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,938
What...? I didn't do anything Wrong.
I got into a good school.

1291
01:13:08,707 --> 01:13:11,874
HoW the fuck am I supposed to get

01:13:12,114 --> 01:13:13,582
HoW fucking selfish are you?

1293
01:13:13,784 --> 01:13:15,811
You had no problem letting Fogell
take the fall.

1294
01:13:16,022 --> 01:13:17,992
You don't Want me going
to a good school.

1295
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:20,186
- Fuck, man!
- So, What the fuck do you Want?

1296
01:13:20,398 --> 01:13:22,926
I'm not gonna let you

1297
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,169
What are you saying?

1298
01:13:27,914 --> 01:13:31,615
I've Wasted the last three years
sitting around talking bullshit With you.

1299
01:13:31,822 --> 01:13:33,792
Instead of chasing girls
and making friends...

1300
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,989
...l've just sat around
Wasting all my time With you.

1301
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,797
And noW I'm going to college

1302
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:43,501
Is this about Becca?
This is about some girl, man?

1303
01:13:43,714 --> 01:13:45,149
- I like her!

1306
01:13:50,728 --> 01:13:53,495
Fuck you! And next time

1308
01:13:56,741 --> 01:13:57,709
- Don't touch me.
- Fuck you!

1309
01:14:00,248 --> 01:14:03,186
Hey, McLovin, are the numbers
on your side odd or even?

1310
01:14:03,389 --> 01:14:07,123
- I don't knoW. It's too dark to see.
- We got flashlights.

1311
01:14:07,329 --> 01:14:09,094
Oh, that's true.

1312
01:14:14,811 --> 01:14:16,678
Where the fuck are We?

1313
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:19,521

01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:21,486
Slater.

1315
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:28,532
NoW, young Michaels, you Will die.

01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:33,446
All right. Come on, stop it.
I can't fucking see. I can't see. Fuck it.

1319
01:14:37,592 --> 01:14:39,221
- Stop it, asshole.

Why did you do that?

1322
01:14:55,563 --> 01:14:57,727
- You shined the light in my face.
- You did too.

1323
01:14:57,935 --> 01:14:59,961
- I'm driving.
- We Were playing Lightsabers.

1324
01:15:00,172 --> 01:15:02,200
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God.

1325
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:04,813
Are you guys gonna make sure

1326
01:15:08,055 --> 01:15:09,319
- Check on him.

1432
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:13,871
We made it.

01:22:19,821 --> 01:22:20,880

01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:24,153
Yeah, I told you the idea Would Work.
I fooled those cops.

1437
01:22:24,396 --> 01:22:27,368
I'm McLovin. I am McLovin.

1438
01:22:29,239 --> 01:22:30,640
Why do you guys have detergent?

1439
01:22:30,843 --> 01:22:33,815
I don't understand Why you Were
smoking cigarettes With those cops.

1440
01:22:34,017 --> 01:22:35,646
Because I fucking rule.

1441
01:22:35,854 --> 01:22:39,156
- We are so gonna get laid tonight.

1442
01:22:39,361 --> 01:22:41,762
We're finally gonna
get our drinks on.

1443
01:22:43,937 --> 01:22:45,634
I can't believe Becca's bottle broke.

1444
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:47,208
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- Yeah.

1445
01:22:47,411 --> 01:22:50,315
I thought you didn't need it.
You Were gonna tell her hoW you feel.

1446
01:22:50,517 --> 01:22:53,045
Good luck getting Jules drunk enough
to have sex With you.

1447
01:22:53,256 --> 01:22:55,193
- What's Wrong With you guys?
- Nothing.

1448
01:22:55,394 --> 01:22:58,560
You tWo femmes can talk about it
next year at your little slumber party.

1449
01:22:58,769 --> 01:23:00,465
Oh, you told him.

1450
01:23:00,672 --> 01:23:03,303
- Told me What?
- Yeah. You're an idiot, Fogell.

1451
01:23:03,512 --> 01:23:05,311
- Well, We gotta tell him noW.
- No, We...

1452
01:23:05,516 --> 01:23:06,985
Well, he knoWs something's up.

1453
01:23:07,219 --> 01:23:09,486
What are you guys talking about?
Tell me noW.

1454
01:23:09,725 --> 01:23:11,888
Seth, me and Evan are
rooming together next year.

1455
01:23:12,097 --> 01:23:13,087
What's the big deal?

1456
01:23:13,299 --> 01:23:15,235
"Oh, my God,
Fogell's rooming With Evan."

1457
01:23:15,436 --> 01:23:17,132
Jeez, Why don't you go cry about it?

1458
01:23:17,339 --> 01:23:19,776
- I didn't tell you because...
- You're a backstabber...

1459
01:23:19,978 --> 01:23:23,213
...and you lied to your best friend
and you just don't care anymore?

1460
01:23:23,419 --> 01:23:25,617
I didn't expect this from you, Evan.

1461
01:23:26,091 --> 01:23:27,253
Not from you.

1462
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:29,658
Give me that booze, Fagell.

1463
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:36,212
We never should have had to hide
our arrangement.

1464
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,735
- Seth's here.
- Seth, you're here.

1465
01:23:48,939 --> 01:23:52,673
Hi. Everybody, Seth has got it.

1466
01:24:15,962 --> 01:24:18,092
- Evan.
- Gaby, hey.

1467
01:24:18,301 --> 01:24:20,168
Where have you been?
You almost bleW it.

1468
01:24:20,371 --> 01:24:22,899
- What are you talking about?
- Becca. She's been Waiting.

1469
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:24,409
She's over there.

1470
01:24:25,282 --> 01:24:26,580
She's Way smashed.

1471
01:24:26,786 --> 01:24:29,085
And she's been yammering
about you all night.

1472
01:24:29,289 --> 01:24:31,088
Really? What Was she saying?

1473
01:24:31,294 --> 01:24:33,389
She told you that she thinks
I'm a good guy?

1474
01:24:33,598 --> 01:24:36,161
No, no.
She said something more like:

1475
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:38,899
"I Will fully bloW him tonight."

1476
01:24:39,143 --> 01:24:41,478
- What?
- I knoW.

1477
01:24:44,923 --> 01:24:47,154
- Yeah.
- But she's totally hammered...

1478
01:24:47,361 --> 01:24:50,265
...and if I get With her
and I'm not drunk, isn't that unethical?

1479

01:34:42,799 --> 01:34:44,769
And lube.

1632
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:46,462
Seth?

1633
01:34:50,449 --> 01:34:52,886
Are...? Are you crying?

1634
01:34:53,288 --> 01:34:56,158
No, I just have something
in both my eyes.

1635
01:34:56,361 --> 01:34:57,523
I don't cry. That's funny.

1636
01:34:57,731 --> 01:34:59,963
You look... You look...
It looks like you're crying.

1637
01:35:00,169 --> 01:35:01,501
So...

1638
01:35:03,744 --> 01:35:06,078
It Was my last chance
and I fucked it up and...

1639
01:35:06,283 --> 01:35:07,841
Your last chance to do What?

1640
01:35:08,052 --> 01:35:11,081
To make you
my girlfriend for the summer.

1641
01:35:11,693 --> 01:35:14,529
You're, like, the coolest person
that's ever talked to me.

1642
01:35:14,732 --> 01:35:16,326
I thought We'd both be drunk.

1643
01:35:16,536 --> 01:35:19,269
What does me being drunk
have anything to do With it?

1644
01:35:19,475 --> 01:35:21,776
You'd never get With me
if you Were sober.

1645
01:35:21,981 --> 01:35:23,450
Look at you.

1646
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:28,722
- Look at me.
- Seth, come on, you didn't bloW it.

1647
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:30,923
I think maybe...

1648
01:35:31,567 --> 01:35:33,332
What the fuck?!

1649
01:35:33,538 --> 01:35:35,201

1650
01:35:37,413 --> 01:35:38,381

1651
01:35:38,582 --> 01:35:40,643
I'm sorry.

1652
01:35:41,054 --> 01:35:43,547
- Someone forgot to call pest control.
- Yep.

1653
01:35:43,759 --> 01:35:45,592
Where you going?
Hey, party's still on.

1654
01:35:45,796 --> 01:35:47,025
- Where are you going?

1655
01:35:47,233 --> 01:35:50,433
If you're back there, get out.

1657
01:35:52,611 --> 01:35:54,102
- Evan.

1658
01:35:54,315 --> 01:35:55,977
Keep your hands up.

1659
01:36:01,764 --> 01:36:04,463
Life's bullshit, Miroki.

1660
01:36:13,856 --> 01:36:15,826
Ev, Wake the fuck up, man.

1661

1662
01:36:21,638 --> 01:36:23,939
"Oh, no, it's the cops."
We have a complaint.

1663
01:36:24,143 --> 01:36:26,671

1665
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:31,418
- Drop the crantini and move it, sister.
- See you, sugar tits.

1666
01:36:31,626 --> 01:36:32,594
Guys, come on, move.

1687
01:37:52,928 --> 01:37:54,898
Why did you run aWay?

1689
01:37:57,237 --> 01:37:58,227
Why Would you do that?

1690
01:37:58,439 --> 01:38:00,933
- I Was disoriented from...

1691
01:38:01,145 --> 01:38:03,548
You just violated her With your penis?

- No, no, no.

1693
01:38:05,687 --> 01:38:07,179

1695
01:38:09,829 --> 01:38:12,494

01:38:12,702 --> 01:38:14,969

1699
01:38:19,617 --> 01:38:21,086
...and then you go running aWay.

1700
01:38:21,287 --> 01:38:22,916
Contain yourself.

1701
01:38:23,124 --> 01:38:24,616

You just cock-blocked McLovin.
Okay?

1704
01:38:29,104 --> 01:38:30,595
He's our friend. We don't do that.

1705
01:38:30,808 --> 01:38:34,144
We should be guiding his cock,
not blocking it.

1706
01:38:34,348 --> 01:38:38,083
Just relax, okay?
Let's make this right.

1707

Wait, What are you...?

1714

Make the badge proud, Slater.

1775
01:42:55,758 --> 01:42:57,921
He's not usually this drunk
When he does this...

1776
01:42:58,129 --> 01:43:01,261
...but I think
that could make it more cool.

1777
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:08,111
McLovin!

1778
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:19,698

- Hurry, hurry. Let's go. Go, go.
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1784
01:43:43,390 --> 01:43:45,554
- I'm out, I'm out.
- Good, here We go, here We go.

1785
01:43:45,762 --> 01:43:47,857
Yeah? Yeah, okay. Back up.

1786
01:43:48,066 --> 01:43:50,663
Don't bloW yourself up, asshole.

1787
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:59,346
Yes. Oh, my God.

1788
01:43:59,557 --> 01:44:01,959
It Worked. It Worked.

1789
01:44:02,162 --> 01:44:06,103
We Won. We Won.

1790
01:44:14,722 --> 01:44:16,624
Can We shoot at it?

1791
01:44:17,796 --> 01:44:20,927
I don't knoW. Can you?

1792
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:41,471
Break yourself, fool.

1793
01:44:47,859 --> 01:44:49,350
Tight.

1794
01:44:49,561 --> 01:44:52,158
Listen, and then she said
she Was gonna give me a bloW-J.

1795
01:44:52,368 --> 01:44:56,102
- I can't believe she said that to you.
- Man, you have no idea.

1796
01:44:56,308 --> 01:44:59,178
- What Was she thinking?
- You don't even knoW.

1797
01:45:06,998 --> 01:45:10,996
I gotta tell you.
I gotta tell you something, Evan.

1798
01:45:11,207 --> 01:45:12,538
What?

1799
01:45:12,743 --> 01:45:14,610
I Was in your room, like,
three Weeks ago...

1800
01:45:14,813 --> 01:45:17,045
...While you Were taking a shit.

1801
01:45:17,252 --> 01:45:22,251
And I saW your housing, like, forms.

1802
01:45:22,764 --> 01:45:26,967
So I kneW you and Fogell
Were gonna live together, you knoW.

1803
01:45:27,173 --> 01:45:29,736
I'm sorry, man, I don't knoW.

1804
01:45:31,783 --> 01:45:35,884
I should've told you.
I don't knoW Why I didn't.

1805
01:45:36,092 --> 01:45:38,825
Don't... No, don't be sorry.
I should be sorry.

1806
01:45:39,031 --> 01:45:41,764
I Was being a dick.
I Was being a big dick to you.

1807
01:45:41,971 --> 01:45:43,201
No, l...

1808
01:45:43,407 --> 01:45:47,815
Listen, Seth, I Want you to knoW,
I don't Wanna live With Fogell.

1809
01:45:48,016 --> 01:45:52,982
I never Wanted to live With him.
I just don't... I ha...

1810
01:45:53,194 --> 01:45:55,357
I'm afraid to live With strangers.

1811
01:45:57,236 --> 01:45:58,363
I can't.

1812
01:45:59,474 --> 01:46:01,444
I can't do it.

1813
01:46:02,848 --> 01:46:05,581
I knoW, I knoW.

1814
01:46:06,888 --> 01:46:09,759
I can't believe you saved me.

1815
01:46:11,432 --> 01:46:13,561
You saved me.

1816
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:16,674
I can't believe. I oWe you so...

1817
01:46:17,544 --> 01:46:21,679
You carried me. I love you.

1818
01:46:22,321 --> 01:46:23,754
I love you, man.

1819
01:46:26,730 --> 01:46:28,757
I love you.

1820
01:46:30,204 --> 01:46:34,839
I love you. I'm not even
embarrassed to say it. I just...

1821
01:46:35,047 --> 01:46:37,017

1822
01:46:37,219 --> 01:46:38,881
- I'm not embarrassed.
- I love you.

1823
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:40,558
I love you.

1824
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:43,527
Why don't We say that every day?
Why can't We say it more often?

1825
01:46:43,733 --> 01:46:45,965
I just love you. I just Wanna
go to the rooftops and scream:

1826
01:46:46,171 --> 01:46:47,469
"I love my best friend, Evan."

1827
01:46:47,674 --> 01:46:51,307
- We should go up on my roof.
- For sure.

1828
01:46:51,516 --> 01:46:57,324
Like, When you Went aWay for Easter,
on your vacation, I missed you.

1829
01:46:57,528 --> 01:47:00,989
- I missed you too.
- I Want the World to knoW.

1830
01:47:01,436 --> 01:47:06,105
It's... It's the most beautiful thing
in the World.

1831
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:13,251
Come here. Come here, man.

1832
01:47:23,949 --> 01:47:26,477
- I love you.
- I love you.

1833
01:47:39,515 --> 01:47:41,576
What the fuck?

1834
01:47:48,968 --> 01:47:53,968
- What up?
- Morning. Morning.

1835
01:47:54,446 --> 01:47:56,940
I should get moving.
I should get moving.

1836
01:47:57,151 --> 01:47:59,349
I should be getting
a move on, for sure.

1837
01:47:59,557 --> 01:48:02,529
Yeah, you don't...
I mean, you don't have to, you knoW.

1838
01:48:02,731 --> 01:48:05,794
I don't really have anything
going on.

1839
01:48:06,004 --> 01:48:08,532
You don't have to rush off like that.

1840
01:48:12,049 --> 01:48:14,076
You Wanna hang out?

1841
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:16,958
I Was gonna go to the mall.

1842
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:20,600
I have to get a neW comforter.

1843
01:48:21,236 --> 01:48:23,729
For college.
The mall, they Would sell that.

1844
01:48:23,942 --> 01:48:25,501
Cool. So...

1845
01:48:26,881 --> 01:48:29,146
...your mom's got huge tits.

1846
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:33,054
What do you think?

1847
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:34,627
I don't knoW, man. Don't ask me.

1848
01:48:34,830 --> 01:48:37,597
Because I don't give a shit
hoW pants look.

1849
01:48:37,803 --> 01:48:40,172
Yeah, I need someone's opinion.

1850
01:48:40,375 --> 01:48:43,712
Those are too tight.
Those are Way too tight.

1851
01:48:43,916 --> 01:48:46,386
- Yeah, but, like...
- Way too tight. You need to upgrade.

1852
01:48:46,587 --> 01:48:49,150
There's not enough pants Where
there should be. More pants.

1853
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,729
Yeah, but...
I mean, does it look Weird?

1854
01:48:51,932 --> 01:48:55,303
Looks like you're standing funny. You
Wouldn't stand like that. Like a duck.

1855
01:48:55,506 --> 01:48:57,271
Yeah, but I'm doing like...

1856
01:48:57,477 --> 01:49:00,712
- I'm doing the college poses like...
- I don't knoW if you are.

1857
01:49:00,917 --> 01:49:02,819
- You might just be doing...
- Hey, prof.

1858
01:49:03,023 --> 01:49:05,084
- Okay.
- That test Was...

1859
01:49:05,728 --> 01:49:09,600
Hey, Susan. Are you gonna
party tonight or no?

1860
01:49:09,803 --> 01:49:13,368
Yeah, but that's just... It's like I Wish
there Were more pants Where...

1861
01:49:13,611 --> 01:49:14,841
You knoW, Where there aren't.

1862
01:49:15,081 --> 01:49:16,948
But When I Was Wearing
your dad's pants...

1863
01:49:17,152 --> 01:49:19,954
...I realized that if I Wear pants
that are a little too small...

1864
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:21,855
...it might encourage me
to lose Weight.

1865
01:49:22,062 --> 01:49:23,964
And also,
chicks can kind of see, like...

1866
01:49:24,166 --> 01:49:26,797
...you knoW, the borders
and outline of my dick a little.

1867
01:49:27,005 --> 01:49:29,978
Yeah, man, they go nuts for that.
The male camel toe.

1868
01:49:30,179 --> 01:49:33,174
Yeah, the camel tail. It's right...

1869
01:49:33,386 --> 01:49:35,049
I knoW Where it is, Where it happens.

1870
01:49:35,256 --> 01:49:36,919
Like, right there.

1871
01:49:37,127 --> 01:49:40,691
It's like they're so tight that one ball is,
like, above my dick, even.

1872
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:42,597
- Yeah, exactly.
- It's like three.

1873
01:49:42,804 --> 01:49:45,401
It's like a three thing.
It's like ball, dick, ball.

1874
01:49:45,610 --> 01:49:46,977
It's like a division sign.

1875
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:48,979
Like a bunch of people
crammed into a van.

1876
01:49:49,919 --> 01:49:53,654
- Making my ass look Weird?
- It makes a lot of stuff look Weird.

1877
01:49:53,995 --> 01:49:55,429
No, those are Way too tight.

1878
01:49:56,266 --> 01:49:59,032
You're right, these look stupid.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1879
01:49:59,239 --> 01:50:02,507
I'm really sorry about that.
I can't believe I actually did that.

1880
01:50:02,713 --> 01:50:04,774
I feel bad that I'm making you
buy me a neW one.

1881
01:50:04,984 --> 01:50:06,248
It's seems, like, ridiculous.

1882
01:50:06,454 --> 01:50:10,485
- No. I have to, it's puke. It's gross.
- Oh, my God.

1883
01:50:10,696 --> 01:50:13,189
Do alcoholics get hangovers?

1884
01:50:13,402 --> 01:50:16,203
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
It's them.

1885
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:21,016
- What the fuck do We do, man?
- Don't stop. I don't knoW.

1886
01:50:22,855 --> 01:50:25,292
- Hey.
- Hey.

1887
01:50:26,229 --> 01:50:27,926
HoW's it going?

1888
01:50:29,670 --> 01:50:32,436
It's so good to...
HoW are you feeling?

1889
01:50:33,076 --> 01:50:36,572
I've felt better. But I'll be fine.
HoW about you?

1890
01:50:37,686 --> 01:50:41,821
I'm okay, you knoW, yeah.
Did you have fun last night?

1891
01:50:44,366 --> 01:50:47,897
You knoW,
I actually don't remember much.

1892
01:50:48,108 --> 01:50:49,633
I don't remember anything.

1893
01:50:50,545 --> 01:50:53,518
- So Weird.
- Nothing.

1894
01:50:54,019 --> 01:50:56,616
I didn't puke on you, did I?

1895
01:50:57,093 --> 01:50:59,325
You didn't.
I remember that you... I avoided it.

1896
01:50:59,531 --> 01:51:03,631
It Whizzed right by me, and I said,
"Stay aWay from me," you knoW.

1897
01:51:04,275 --> 01:51:10,220
I'm really sorry about
everything last night, and I just...

1898
01:51:11,889 --> 01:51:14,326
Thank you for being
such a nice guy about it all.

1899
01:51:15,230 --> 01:51:16,859
That's okay, you knoW.

1900
01:51:17,067 --> 01:51:19,664
At least you don't have
a black eye from it.

1901
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:26,212
- That looks terrible.
- Yeah.

1902
01:51:27,122 --> 01:51:31,426
You look great. You don't look terrible.
It's just, like, a bad bruise.

1903
01:51:31,632 --> 01:51:34,365
Everything's great, just from he...
This, just like right there.

1904
01:51:34,571 --> 01:51:36,165
- Your eye.
- Yeah, your eye.

1905
01:51:36,375 --> 01:51:38,004
Everything else is great.

1906
01:51:38,212 --> 01:51:42,210
But seriously,
I acted like a fucking idiot last night.

1907
01:51:44,926 --> 01:51:49,128
You don't deserve that.
So I'm sorry.

1908
01:51:49,969 --> 01:51:53,774
On the upside,
I think you look cool With a black eye.

1909
01:51:53,978 --> 01:51:57,349
I'm just gonna throW that out there.
I don't... I don't knoW.

1910
01:51:57,552 --> 01:52:01,548
Well, thank you, smart guy.
Thanks. That's actually Why I'm here.

1911
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:05,063
Because I have to get
a ton of cover-up for the grad photo.

1912
01:52:05,267 --> 01:52:07,704
Oh, man. Fuck.

1913
01:52:07,906 --> 01:52:10,309
And I'm gonna get Jules
a neW comforter.

1914
01:52:10,512 --> 01:52:12,449
I have to get a comforter too.
For college.

1915
01:52:12,650 --> 01:52:15,178
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I just figured I Would need one.

1916
01:52:15,389 --> 01:52:17,291
So, Seth...

1917
01:52:18,629 --> 01:52:22,592
So do you Wanna come
buy me cover-up or something?

1918
01:52:22,804 --> 01:52:24,831
I mean, you kind of oWe me.

1919
01:52:26,244 --> 01:52:29,615
Yeah, definitely.
I Would love to do that.

1920
01:52:30,085 --> 01:52:31,987
I had such bad acne last year...

1921
01:52:32,191 --> 01:52:35,561
...that I pretty much became,
like, an expert on the stuff.

1922
01:52:36,132 --> 01:52:38,729
Well, you drove.
Evan drove me here, though, so...

1923
01:52:38,938 --> 01:52:40,966
Well, so...
Well, I mean, I have my dad's car.

1924
01:52:41,176 --> 01:52:44,012
So I could just give you a lift...

1925
01:52:44,216 --> 01:52:46,244
...and then Evan
could take Becca home.

1926
01:52:46,454 --> 01:52:48,856
If that Works.
I don't knoW if it's in your route.

1927
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:50,289
It'd be fine With me.

1928
01:52:50,496 --> 01:52:53,263
Fine, yeah.
Maybe We can get some food.

1929
01:52:54,471 --> 01:52:55,733
Yeah, I'd like that.
