1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,900
PAULY SHORE:
My name's Pauly Shore,

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,700
and I've been rocking
and rolling

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,000
for over two decades now,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,300
and I ain't stopping.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,100
Most guys my age
are married with children.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,800
But not me.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,700
I'm still playing
with the little babies!

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,500
I'm buzzing around Tinseltown,
having a blast,

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
hitting red-carpet events,

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,400
hanging with celebs,

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,500
and fooling around
with some of them too.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,400
Don't tell Tommy.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,100
Mwah!

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,300
I have a brother named Pete
who's the opposite of me.

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,600
He likes to take girls to plays,
and I like to play with girls.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,900
And one of those girls
that he took to a play,

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,400
he settled down with, got
married and started a family.

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,100
So I have a niece and nephew,
which means I'm an uncle.

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,800
Of course, I'm not the uncle
that's allowed

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,400
to take the kids out
for the weekend.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm the creepy uncle.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Recently, Pete and his family
came in from Chicago

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,600
to visit my mom, and since
I was part of the family,

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,300
I was invited too.

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,500
And while I was hanging out
with my niece and nephew,

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,100
I then realized after
all these years of partying,

27
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,400
I've been missing out on true,
unconditional love.

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Right then I decided, "No,
I'm not going to get married!

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,100
"I'm going to have a kid
of my own.

30
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,500
"I mean, who's going to take
care of me when I get old?

31
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,900
Definitely not this bitch."
WOMAN: Oh!

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,600
PAULY:
And since I don't have a vagina,

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,900
I'm going to adopt a kid.

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,200
So then I went to an adoption
agency in L.A.,

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
and they said, "Absolutely not."

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,600
And then I thought, "Where are
all the other celebrities

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
adopting their kids?"

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,600
¶ I'll be last night's man ¶

39
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,500
And when it comes to celebrities
adopting children,

40
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,800
there has been
a pecking order.

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,400
First there was Angelina,

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
then Madonna.

43
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
And now--

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,500
Who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy?

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,700
Pauly!
Yes.

46
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,300
¶

47
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,400
It's okay.

48
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,800
Hello.

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:29,700
¶

50
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,600
Straight.

51
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
All right, all right.

52
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,400
¶

53
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,500
Unlike Madonna and Angelina,

54
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,400
who probably had their people
call ahead

55
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,700
to the African embassy
to find their child,

56
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,000
I decided to improvise
and just hit the streets.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,700
Can I take him?

58
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,900
(Crying)

59
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,300
You know, Angelina Jolie,
Brad Pitt, Madonna.

60
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,100
What they do is they come
to Africa

61
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,700
and they just meet a baby
like this,

62
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,800
and they actually just pluck it
and take it back.

63
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,900
This isn't my baby.
I just found this baby,

64
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,800
but I'm going to find
my own baby, okay?

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,600
I want to spend some time
with the baby.

66
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,200
I want to test-drive
with the baby

67
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,900
and go see
if we even get along,

68
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,400
see if we're compatible,
right?

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,900
(Crying)
(Sighing)

70
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,400
Oh.

71
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,200
He doesn't
want to come with me?

72
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
He's perfect.

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,900
I've flown all this way

74
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,900
to take a baby from Africa

75
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,100
and bring him
to Los Angeles with me

76
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,700
to fall in love with me.

77
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,400
(Crying)

78
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,500
I'm going
to go back to America

79
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,000
with a beautiful
baby boy or baby girl.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,200
What's up, bro?

81
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Peace.

82
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,400
Trying to find your way
around Africa

83
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,400
is like the Beckhams trying to
find their way around a Walmart.

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
So I hired a driver
named Val,

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,800
who's a cross
between Elizabeth Taylor

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,900
and the lead singer
of Quiet Riot.

87
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
What would you do if you were
to adopt a baby?

88
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,200
I mean, it's best to go through
the right channels.

89
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,300
Right.

90
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,000
So after thumbing through
Us Weekly

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,900
and watching several episodes
of Access Hollywood,

92
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,900
there was only one place for me
to go to find my child.

93
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,300
This is the Oprah Winfrey
All-Girls Leadership Academy.

94
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,800
We are here in Africa, and I'm--
You know, this is the place

95
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,400
that I thought would be perfect
for me to actually

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,500
possibly adopt a beautiful girl,
bring her back to the States.

97
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,900
I need someone
to run my company.

98
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,100
Hey, guys.

99
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,600
What's up, buddy?

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,200
My name's Pauly Shore.

101
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,100
What's the word
on the street?

102
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,600
What's up?

103
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,300
It's all good.

104
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,000
Is this the Oprah Winfrey
School of Fine Arts?

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,700
Yeah.
Is it called the Fine Arts

106
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,500
Oprah Winfrey School?

107
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,400
Yeah, it's the Oprah Winfrey
School.

108
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
I know, but is it called the
Fine-- Is it called Fine Arts?

109
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,700
Is Oprah here?
No. No, she's not.

110
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,300
She's not here?
Are you serious?

111
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,700
I just came all the way
from Los Angeles.

112
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
She fucking said
she was going to be here.

113
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,200
No, she's not.
She's not here?

114
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,500
No.

115
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,100
Has she been here before?

116
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,400
Yes, she was here.

117
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,900
Did you guys
get an autograph?

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,400
No. We are not allowed.

119
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,500
You're not allowed to speak to
her because she's the princess.

120
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,700
Do you bow to her?

121
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,300
Who do you bow to?

122
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,100
Nelson Mandela?

123
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,300
My name, I think,
is on the list.

124
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,600
MAN: Okay.
Yeah.

125
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,800
So if I can just make sure
it's okay?

126
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Okay, let me check.

127
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
One minute.

128
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,100
Where are you going?
Let me rub the head.

129
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,600
I know it's weird for a white
man to rub a black man's head

130
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,700
unless he just scored
a lay-up.

131
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
What's his name? You want
to come home with me?

132
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,500
I can adopt you.
(Laughing)

133
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,900
Can I adopt you?
No, sir.

134
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Everybody scream,
"Oprah! Oprah!"

135
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,900
Oprah! Oprah! Oprah!

136
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,400
She's going to give us some
money and take us away!

137
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,600
Oh!

138
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,700
I came here to--

139
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,900
Can you please do that
outside the gate?

140
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,100
(Man speaking indistinctly)

141
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,400
Did John Samuel tell us--
Tell them you were--

142
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
We were coming?

143
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,000
For clarification,
John Samuel

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,100
is Oprah Winfrey's
right-hand man.

145
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, let's go here.
Let's go out here.

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,300
I knew it was time to leave when
Louis Farrakhan's boy showed up.

147
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,800
What's your name?

148
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Hi.

149
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
WOMAN: Hi. May I help you?
No, I'm waiting For Dexter.

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,600
Yeah, he called me.

151
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,400
Oh, he did? Oh, okay.
Sorry. How's it going?

152
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Pauly.
Sorry.

153
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
I don't want to be filmed.

154
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,800
Sorry.
You have to put that down.

155
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,200
Okay, you guys, don't film.
You have to put that down.

156
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,600
I'm sorry.
Yeah, throw the cameras.

157
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,200
WOMAN:
That's not fair.

158
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, it's okay. It's okay.

159
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,500
My name's Pauly.
Pauly, hi.

160
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,900
My name's Fruhana.

161
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,600
I'm John's PA.
Oh, okay. Perfect.

162
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,900
John doesn't have
any appointments, dear.

163
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,800
Really?
Yeah, not this morning, no.

164
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,500
No, because we called--
Do you know who contacted him?

165
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,600
No. Well, I had
my assistant contact him

166
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,500
and basically say
that I'm coming here to--

167
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,200
To-- To Africa

168
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,400
to possibly just
interview the girls,

169
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,500
so that was the whole--

170
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,800
Yes. No, I understand
what you're saying,

171
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
but I haven't received
anything from anyone.

172
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,600
So there's no way I can talk
to any of the girls right now?

173
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,100
No. I'm so sorry.
Just to interview them?

174
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,300
I'm from America, okay?
Yes.

175
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,600
Oprah's from Chicago.

176
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,900
My brother lives in Chicago.

177
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,100
Okay?
Yes.

178
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,600
So I'm, like, really close
with her, and--

179
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Have you seen me before?
No.

180
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,400
(Laughing)

181
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,200
No?
No, I'm sure you're great.

182
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm a funny guy.
I do this weasel thing.

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
I go crazy and stuff.

184
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,800
Okay, thank you
for having us.

185
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
Dexter!

186
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,500
Dexter!

187
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,400
Later, bro!

188
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,200
Adopting a child from the
Oprah School was my only plan,

189
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,200
so I had to go to Plan B,
and I didn't have a Plan B.

190
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Come to think of it,
I didn't even have a Plan A.

191
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,600
Okay, be careful.
Lock the doors.

192
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,400
I will.
And if you hear me scream,

193
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
you know,
call George Bush.

194
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
(Laughing)

195
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,700
What's up, bro?

196
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,100
What's up, dawg?

197
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,400
I came all the way
from California.

198
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,000
You came to do what,
exactly?

199
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,200
PAULY:
Meet a child.

200
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,800
Meet a child to take her back
to California for a better life.

201
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,600
VAL:
I have Pauly Shore with me.

202
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,700
He's here in Africa
to adopt a baby.

203
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,100
Can I have him now?
Can I take him with me?

204
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,800
You sell the chicken?
I'm selling him.

205
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,900
That's tight. T.I., T.I.

206
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,300
How much for a--
If I want to adopt a child,

207
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,700
how much for a child
instead of a chicken?

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,300
A child.

209
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,200
I want to buy the chicken,
and I want to adopt a child.

210
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,400
(Laughing)

211
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,700
Do you have any babies
available?

212
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
No?

213
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,000
How did Angelina Jolie
do it?

214
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,200
How did she do it?

215
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,500
Remember Madonna?
How did they do it?

216
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,100
What did they do?

217
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Just wanted to say,
"What's up?"

218
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Los Angeles.

219
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,800
Sí.

220
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,900
Can I take this baby?
WOMAN: No.

221
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,500
It's your baby?
No.

222
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,900
It's my baby?
No.

223
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,000
It's his baby?

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Give me a hug. Oh!

225
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,600
The problem is,
is all these kids have parents,

226
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,000
and they won't let me
take them.

227
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
(Sighing)

228
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Anything?
Have you gotten anything?

229
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,900
Yes, I did call a few,
one or two.

230
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah?
Refused to see us.

231
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,600
I flew all the way over here
because I'm interested

232
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,100
in adopting an African child

233
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,500
to bring back
to the States with me

234
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,100
for possibly a better life.

235
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,300
What you mean by
"better lifestyle"?

236
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,600
Well, why--? Yeah, why do they
say that, then?

237
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
That's my question.

238
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,900
Publicity stunt.

239
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,400
Why come all the way here

240
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,500
when there are so many
other people over there

241
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,700
going through the same thing?
So then I should just go home.

242
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Just adopt someone from home.
Fuck this. I'm going home.

243
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,400
(All laughing)

244
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,600
MAN:
That's what I'm saying.

245
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,700
So we're straight, right?

246
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,000
We're all straight?
No, no, no.

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,100
Nothing,
we're straight.

248
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,300
PAULY:
You know, maybe I'm going
about this the wrong way.

249
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,500
If I'm going to find a child,

250
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,400
I'm going to need to break bread
with these people.

251
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,300
But there's only
one problem:

252
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,000
when it comes to germs,
I'm worse than Howie Mandel.

253
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,800
Is that clean?
It's okay? No problem?

254
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,900
MAN:
Don't use too much.

255
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
PAULY:
This first,

256
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,200
then this?

257
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
No, no.
And then that

258
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,000
and then that?

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,500
Show me. Show me.
Let me show you.

260
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,900
Dude!
What the fuck, bro?

261
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,200
MAN 1:
Show him. Show him. Show him.

262
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,400
MAN 2:
Get that. Enjoy it.

263
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And also with--

264
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
(Speaking foreign dialect)

265
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,700
It's hot. It's hot.

266
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,800
(Laughing)

267
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,800
I need my soda!

268
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,600
Can I try it on?
Is that okay? No worries?

269
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,100
Right. No worries.

270
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,300
That's good, right?

271
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
Sure, sure.

272
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,100
PAULY:
Spending the day in Africa

273
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,100
is like spending the day
in Venice Beach

274
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,200
but with no winos
or Filipinos.

275
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,900
Have you seen
Dave Chappelle?

276
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,100
I heard he's hiding in there.

277
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,100
(All laughing)

278
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,700
You got to like the music
of America.

279
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,500
You like Dr. Dre,
Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent?

280
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,000
That's my boy, 50 Cent.

281
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,900
(Laughing)

282
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,400
PAULY:
I was having such
an amazing time.

283
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,400
But with all this excitement,
I almost forgot why I was here.

284
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,300
It was time for me to say
goodbye to my new friends

285
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,300
and continue my quest
for my child.

286
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,500
Hi.
WOMAN: Hello. How are you?

287
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm not doing too good,
actually.

288
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Well, do you guys
have babies here?

289
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,200
What are you, you're like
a witch doctor?

290
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,100
Sangoma.
What's a Samgorma?

291
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,700
Come. Come, come, come.

292
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,700
PAULY: Come?
WOMAN: Come.

293
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,000
Let me show you, my son,
how to throw the bones.

294
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,800
Here he goes.

295
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,300
(Blowing)

296
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,900
Can you get diseases
by holding the bones?

297
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,000
No.
Okay. Don't get mad.

298
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,300
I'm just asking a question.

299
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,400
(Both laughing)

300
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,900
That's not good when bone--

301
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,100
(Laughing)

302
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Is that good
when one bone stays?

303
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,900
WOMAN:
No, it doesn't matter.

304
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,300
PAULY:
Oh, it doesn't matter?

305
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,100
Has that happened before?
Yes.

306
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Okay.

307
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,800
This is the babies?
Yes, it's the baby.

308
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,500
This is a baby?

309
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,500
Oh, this is the girl?
Yeah, it's a baby.

310
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,000
This is a baby?
Yes.

311
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,100
Oh, the baby! Oh, the baby!
Oh, the baby!

312
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,900
Breast-feed the baby.
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

313
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,500
This is my little girl.

314
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,200
Oh, that's beautiful.
Here's the problem:

315
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,600
I don't know where to go,

316
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,800
and I just want to take the baby
for one afternoon.

317
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,100
And I can take the baby
for a little test-drive?

318
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,100
Really?
Yes.

319
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,000
Here's what I'll do,

320
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,500
is I'll text you my number.
Okay.

321
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,200
Okay? See, you have cellphones
here in Africa.

322
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,300
A lot of people
don't even think that.

323
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,100
I know.
You're, like, modern, babe.

324
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,400
Yes.

325
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,600
(Laughing)
Is that a BlackBerry?

326
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
The new--
The new BlackBerry Curve?

327
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,500
Oh, it's a Nokia?
Those damn Japanese.

328
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,400
Nokia!

329
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,700
(Imitating speaking Japanese)

330
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
(Laughing)

331
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,400
Let me touch your Nokia.

332
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,900
So I got my reading from
Miss Cleo, and I was on my way.

333
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,700
I'm going to get a baby, bro!
I'm going to get a baby!

334
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
I couldn't believe it.

335
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,100
Within the next 12 hours,

336
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,500
I was going to have a young girl
or boy by my side.

337
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,400
Am I ready to take on
this responsibility?

338
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,800
Am I ready
to become a father?

339
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,700
Time will tell.
Time will tell.

340
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,000
So the Sangoma texts me
on my BlackBerry

341
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and said, "These are the rules:
3 days, 3 kids.

342
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
Have them home before dark."

343
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
I text her back--

344
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,400
She texts me back--

345
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,900
Okay, I'm going to go fetch
the baby.

346
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,000
Good luck.
Okay.

347
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,800
You're funny.

348
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,100
Are you sure you weren't
in a rock band,

349
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,300
like, in the '70s or '80s?

350
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,500
VAL:
No.

351
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,300
PAULY:
This place doesn't look

352
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,700
like an adoption agency.

353
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,500
It looks like a place to score
medical marijuana.

354
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,800
(Door buzzing)

355
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,300
Morning.

356
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,100
Hi. Yeah, I'm here to see,
is it--? It's Ellen?

357
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,500
Ellen?
Allen is in.

358
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,000
Come inside.
Is it Allen?

359
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,600
Yes, it is.
Ellen?

360
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,800
Is she here?
He's here.

361
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,200
He's here?
Yeah.

362
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,100
Come through.
Okay.

363
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,900
I have a meeting.

364
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,500
ALLEN:
Hi, Pauly.
I've been expecting you.

365
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
I'm Allen.
Hey, nice to see you.

366
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,800
Welcome.
Thank you.

367
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Thank you for having me.

368
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,300
Sit down.

369
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,000
Thank you.
We can have a talk

370
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,900
about visit to our country.

371
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,700
I'm interested to possibly,
you know--

372
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,400
I just love
little black children.

373
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,800
All right.
You know what I mean?

374
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,200
I think they're adorable.
I think they're sweet.

375
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,000
And to possibly, you know,
take them back to Hollywood,

376
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
maybe raise them
at the Comedy Store.

377
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,700
That's why I'm, like,
think I would be perfect for it.

378
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,600
Are you in a normal
family setting?

379
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,100
Are you married with--

380
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,300
Do you have a house
of your own?

381
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,000
I mean,
it's serious stuff.

382
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,600
I mean, it's--
Talking about an application.

383
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,700
You know what I have,
is a big heart.

384
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,000
I have a niece
and nephew.

385
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,400
If I were to get a kid,
what would he be?

386
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,600
Their nephew
or their niece?

387
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,100
Well, first of all,
adoptions, per se,

388
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,700
means that it becomes
your child.

389
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,800
The child will actually
have your surname.

390
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,100
Right.
It is your child.

391
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,800
So it would be,
like, Mutumba Shore?

392
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,700
Well, should you qualify
for the adoption.

393
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,300
So you don't think
I can qualify for one?

394
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,400
Men-- Well--
I mean, what do you--?

395
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,500
I mean, what--?
We screen.

396
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,200
We screen.
But what do I--? Okay.

397
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,900
So I'm here. I want a child.
Give me a child.

398
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,400
What do I do?
You know what?

399
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,800
You can have my passport
for collateral,

400
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
because then I'm not leaving
the country,

401
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,400
so you know, like,
I'm not going to, like,

402
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,100
take the kid
and all of a sudden, like,

403
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,300
next thing you know, I'm in,
like, Florida somewhere.

404
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,500
I would consider,
I mean,

405
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,700
sending Odwa with you
for the day.

406
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,200
Oh, is that the kid's name?
Yeah.

407
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,500
So you've already
picked one out for me?

408
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,900
I just want to--
I understand.

409
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,800
Normally, I would not
have done this. Odwa!

410
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,400
Odwa is a sweet,
young, caring boy.

411
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,100
How are you?

412
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,800
PAULY:
Hi. Wait. Hold on. Wait.

413
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,200
Hold him back.
Hold him.

414
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,000
Hold him back one second.

415
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Seriously.

416
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,600
ALLEN:
What--? What's your problem?

417
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,200
There's no problem. I just
didn't-- Here, you can come now.

418
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,500
Well, I don't like
what I see.

419
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,100
Odwa, have a seat here
next to Uncle Pauly.

420
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
One sec, one sec.

421
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Because, I mean,

422
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,300
because I didn't take my shots
or anything.

423
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,500
He can sit down.

424
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,700
I didn't get my--
My yellow fever.

425
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,400
Odwa, I want you to spend
the morning with Pauly.

426
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,100
You want to sit down?

427
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,800
It's okay?

428
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,700
I don't know what you know
about Africa, but--

429
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,000
Well, yeah,
tell me about it.

430
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,100
Well, I think you're totally
misinformed as to--

431
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,200
Well, you know what?

432
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,700
You should go out
in America

433
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,200
and see what they think.

434
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,400
When you met me, you didn't
have to put those things on.

435
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,200
Same for Odwa.
You don't have to.

436
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,100
You can take it off.

437
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,400
Okay, I will, in any case,
I will hear from you

438
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,800
and from Odwa
how was the exercise.

439
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,000
I don't have a mask on.
I don't have anything.

440
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,700
I know, but you've been here
a while.

441
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,900
There's nothing wrong
with Odwa.

442
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Okay. Well, then, let's go.

443
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,300
All right, we're going to get--
Get going.

444
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,600
Just remember, you will be back
before dark.

445
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Yeah.
Please.

446
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
No problem. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

447
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,400
Thank you very much.
And hold the passport.

448
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,700
Okay.
No problem.

449
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,400
Here we go.
There's just no way

450
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,100
that-- I hope you everything
the best.

451
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,400
Thank you.

452
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,700
ALLEN:
Thank you, Odwa. Thank you.

453
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,000
Bye.
ODWA: Bye.

454
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,100
(Door closing)

455
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,700
PAULY:
So I fetched my first child.

456
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,600
He was plump and juicy,

457
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,900
like a little version
of Cedric the Entertainer.

458
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
Now tell us,
what's your name?

459
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,400
And how old are you?

460
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,800
You're a good boy?

461
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Okay.

462
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
I don't know if he is.

463
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,000
¶ I'm hoping, praying that this
hill will start sloping ¶

464
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,200
So I was thinking we'd go
rock-climbing to start it out

465
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,300
because I live
in the Hollywood Hills

466
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,800
and there's a place called
Runyon Canyon,

467
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,900
so if I wind up adopting you,
you, me, and my dog Butter

468
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,400
are going to--

469
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,600
ODWA:
Oh, stop this thing.

470
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,400
What? We're going to go--

471
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Butter.

472
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100

473
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,000
PAULY:
This is it. We're here.

474
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,200
Rock-climbing.

475
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,500
We're here!

476
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,300
VAL:
Yay!

477
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,400
ODWA:
Son of a gun.

478
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,900
Yeah, you do.

479
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,800
(Laughing)

480
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,300
There you go.

481
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Yes.

482
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,400
(Groaning)

483
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
It's a 3.
They will fit.

484
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,900
Let me do this.
Let me do this.

485
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,200
It'll be like our first
kind of father-son--

486
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

487
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,500
Here, put your--
Son, put your--

488
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,200
Put your foot--

489
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,600
How do you--?

490
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,700
(Laughing)

491
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,500
Yeah, but you're not--
Wait.

492
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,400
Son, let me do it.

493
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,600
Oh, I can get it.
I can get it.

494
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,800
¶ There's so much
going down ¶

495
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,300
PAULY:
I didn't expect to bond
with Odwa so quickly.

496
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,000
Kiss your father, son.

497
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Kiss your father.

498
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,600
Mwah.

499
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
If it were between me
and a cheeseburger,

500
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,500
he'd probably choose me.

501
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,700
You have to take off
all this--

502
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,000
PAULY:
Nah, come to think of it,

503
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
he'd probably choose
the cheeseburger.

504
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,500
This is the wall you guys
are going to climb.

505
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,600
PAULY:
Okay.

506
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,200
Well, this'll be fun.

507
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,500
Are you up to the challenge?
Whoa.

508
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,100
Yes. You go first.

509
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,000
Make sure he's okay.

510
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,400
I just took him
from the orphanage.

511
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,600
So are you going to go down
and then I'm going to go up?

512
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,900
I'm down already,
so no need to go down,

513
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,900
so you're going to go up.

514
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,700
Go to the top, son.

515
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,400
This-- The top is America.

516
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,300
(Grunting)

517
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,800
What else does he do?

518
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,700
He can go higher.

519
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,000
What?

520
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,900
No, you have to keep going.
Keep fighting.

521
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,600
(Laughing)
WOMAN: Watch your hands.

522
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,700
Watch your hands.

523
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,600
No. No, no.

524
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,200
WOMAN:
Let go with both hands.

525
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,000
PAULY: Whoa!
WOMAN: Okay?

526
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,100
PAULY:
That's my baby.

527
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,000
Push off the wall
with your feet.

528
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,300
PAULY:
You did good.

529
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,900
You did good, son.

530
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,800
You did good.

531
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,600
Ow, ow, ow!

532
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh, that was great.

533
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,400
Bye. Thanks very much.
You did good. You made it far.

534
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,300
What do you think, huh?

535
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,000
What?

536
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Now where do you want
to go now, son?

537
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,200
He was amazing out there.

538
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,700
Still in one piece?

539
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
Yup.

540
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,900
And?

541
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,200
It was fun. Come on.
Where are we going?

542
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,700
Say bye to the kids.

543
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,200
Bye!
VAL: Let's go, let's go.

544
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,600
PAULY:
So where do you want to go now,
son?

545
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,100
Game farm.

546
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,800
The game farm?
Mm-hm.

547
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,100
PAULY: Val?
What?

548
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,200
Take us to the game farm.

549
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,400
(Laughing)

550
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,000
Say, "Who's your daddy?"

551
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,100
Pauly Shore.
Ow. Yes.

552
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
That's good.

553
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,400
(Laughing)

554
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,900
PAULY:
When Odwa told me he wanted
to go to the game farm,

555
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,200
I thought it was going to be
a farm with Donkey Kong

556
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,700
and Missile Command.

557
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Lions and tigers and bears.
Oh, my.

558
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,100
Are you ready for your big
safari, young man?

559
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,600
Yep.
Yeah?

560
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,300
PAULY:
So they can't come and get us,
right?

561
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,000
No. Only if you misbehave.

562
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,100
This is it. We're going
to go see the animals.

563
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,200
WOMAN: You ready?
Yep.

564
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,800
Yeah. This is going
to be exciting.

565
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,000
It's going to be like the Never
Neverland Ranch, you know?

566
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,200
Like Michael Jackson?

567
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,700
Yep.
Right?

568
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,700
And I'm going to hold your body,
huh?

569
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,400
I'm going to hold your body
like Michael Jackson.

570
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
(Odwa screaming and laughing)

571
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,100
(Elephant trumpeting)

572
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,200
Ah!

573
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,300
WOMAN:
Would you like
to go see some lions?

574
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,400
ODWA:
Yeah, baby, yeah!

575
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,200
Yeah!

576
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,300
All right, guys.
This bit of road

577
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
gets slightly bumpy,
so please hang on.

578
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,400
PAULY: Hold on.
We don't want you

579
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,100
popping over the sides,

580
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,300
because, the lions
might eat you.

581
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,800
PAULY:
Holy shit.

582
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,000
WOMAN:
All four are there.

583
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,300
The four adults.

584
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,700
PAULY:
They're starting to wake up.

585
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,900
Those lions are starting
to look hungry.

586
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,300
I hope they like chocolate
better than vanilla.

587
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,000
Shh.

588
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
They're quite all right.

589
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
They're sleeping.
Shh.

590
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,700
Scared that Odwa and I were
going to get eaten by the lions,

591
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,300
we disguised ourselves
as Mother Teresa and Yoda.

592
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Ow. Ow.

593
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,300
Wait, stop, stop,
stop, stop.

594
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,100
Wait. Stop the car.

595
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,600
WOMAN: Something wrong?
No, no. Here.

596
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,200
Listen, whatever he says,
whatever he does,

597
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,900
keep driving, okay?

598
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
I'll meet you guys
about 100 yards ahead.

599
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,500
Just keep going.
You guys, just keep going.

600
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,000
Pauly!

601

(Elephant trumpeting)

604
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Stop the truck, you guys.
You're going to have to stop.

605
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Hey. What's up?

606
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,300
Hi.

607
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,700
How's it going?
WOMAN: Hi.

608

¶ Da da-da da, da da da ¶
(Laughing)

¶ In another time ¶

610
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
I'm Lauren.
What's up? Pauly.

611
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,900
Wow. It's beautiful.

612
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,800
LAUREN:
Mm-hm.

613
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,300
I got a neck like a giraffe.
Feel it.

614
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,700
This is good.

615
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,100
LAUREN:
Beautiful, long neck.

616
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,200
WOMAN:
Daddy will be back.

617
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,000
He just met
that nice young lady

618
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
that he saw
on the other vehicle.

619
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,900
So I saw you in Entourage.

620
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,100
Oh, yeah,
it's a good show.

621
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Yeah, that scene
when you got kicked out

622
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,900
of the Playboy mansion.

623
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
And yourself, what are you doing
in Africa?

624
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm here actually
adopting a kid.

625
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,700
That's sweet.
So, yeah.

626
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,600
The single-dad thing
could work for you.

627
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,700
Maybe we should meet for a drink
down at the entrance.

628
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Okay.
Okay.

629
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,500
All right.

630
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,800
Pinkie swearing?
Pinkie swear.

631
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,700

632
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Mm.

633
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,400
Mm.

634
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,500
There's more
where that came from.

635
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,900
WOMAN:
Think you'll see any animals

636
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,100
in Los Angeles when you go
and live with your new daddy?

637
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,300
Yes.

638
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,900
(Howling)

639
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,500
I'll see you later.

640
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,000
¶ Going to blow my mind
in another time ¶

641
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,700
Yeah, and you know what?

642
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,100
He promised me
to take me along.

643
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,800
Everybody took off,
and here I am, all by myself.

644
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,200
Here we go.
Thank you so much.

645
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,100
It's a pleasure.
I hope you enjoyed that.

646
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,400
Yeah, it was great.
Be careful.

647
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,000
Ah. Oh.

648
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,200
That's good.

649
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm chowing down.

650
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,600
Sorry about him. Hi.

651
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,700
Are you Pauly?

652
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,900
Yes.

653
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,100
Yeah, she's been waiting
quite a long time for you,

654
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,000
but, unfortunately,
she left already.

655
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,300
She left no phone number?

656
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,500
Nothing.
Nothing?

657
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,900
No way to get
ahold of her?

658
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,700
Sorry, no.

659
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,700
All right. Thank you.
All right.

660
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,700
PAULY:
In my time, I have been stood up
by many chicks,

661
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,000
but not south of the equator.

662
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,700
VAL:
Chasing a girl.

663
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,800
PAULY:
I'm not chasing any girl.

664
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,500
I met a girl out there.

665
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,200
VAL: Yeah?
PAULY: Yeah.

666
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,100
So now it's time to go back
to the hotel

667
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,000
and show Odwa what his life's
going to be like with me.

668
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,400
I want a Snapple!

669
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, my son.
My potential son.

670
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,800
(Laughing)

671
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,600
¶ Too close for comfort,
you changed my mind ¶

672
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,100
¶ Changed my mind again ¶

673
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
VAL:
All right, guys. Here you are.

674
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,900
PAULY:
Thank you.

675
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,200
All right, we'll see you
a little later.

676
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Good. Enjoy.

677
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,800
Bye.
Be good.

678
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,100
Bye.
Bye. See you.

679
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,400
Run, run, run, run, run, run,
run, run.

680
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,400
Wow.

681
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,600
It's cool, right?

682
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,000
Hello. How's it going?

683
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,100
(Odwa speaking indistinctly)

684
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,100
The top. Yeah!

685
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,000
(Gibbering)

686
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,200
Ah!

687
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,400
Paradise!

688
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,500
Give a child some love, yo.

689
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,000
Tell them,
"What's up, what's up?"

690
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,800
'Sup, 'sup?

691
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,000
PAULY:
All of a sudden, I'm starting
to feel like Mr. Drummond

692
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,700
from Diff'rent Strokes,

693
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,700
and Odwa is my new,
improved Gary Coleman.

694
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,300
"What you talking 'bout, Odwa?"

695
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,200
What do you want
with me?

696
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,100
What do I want with you?
Yep.

697
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,600
Why do you want me?

698
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,200
That's a good question.

699
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,400
Because you
need to be wanted.

700
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,300
Plus, you know, I feel
that you would be part

701
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,500
of an American culture,

702
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,600
which it seems like
you're already Americanized.

703
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,400
But I am already L.A.-alized!

704
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,000
I am the king of Queens!

705
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,700
You know what's weird?

706
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,000
If I adopt you, it's like
I'm adopting an American boy.

707
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,400
You're already
Americanized.

708
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,100
Get the hell
out of my suite.

709
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,800
(Both laughing)

710
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,700
Yeah!

711
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,000
Have you been a good boy?

712
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,300
Why have you been
a good boy?

713
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,500
(Laughing)

714
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,200
Oh, wait. One more time.
I almost got it.

715
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Here. Here we go.

716
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,300
From the chocolate?

717
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,400
(Laughing)

718
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,100
Yeah!

719
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,700
How does that feel
right about here?

720
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,900
Whoo-hoo!

721
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,100
Daddy. Whoo-hoo!

722
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,400
¶ I love the tubby ¶

723
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
¶ I love everything ¶

724
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,700
Are you ready for your first
scrub from Daddy?

725
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,200
Yes.
Huh?

726
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,300
One of many cleanings
that I do for you.

727
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,400
Lift up your arms, son.
There you go.

728
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,200
Get that real good.

729
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,500
Man, if I choose Odwa,

730
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,700
it's not going to be like
I'm adopting a child.

731
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,000
It's going to be like
I'm adopting a roommate.

732
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,300
Between the grocery bills
and the rehab bills,

733
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,600
this kid's going to break me.

734
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,300
Not to mention
all my girlfriends

735
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,100
he's going to have sex with
behind my back.

736
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

737
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,500
(Chuckling)

738
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,200
Whoo-hoo!

739
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,800
Daddy. Whoo-hoo!

740
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,100
Hyah! Whoo-hoo!

741
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
(Seagull squawking)

742
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,800
PAULY:
Yum!

743
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,600
This is a--

744
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,100
An autobiography

745
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,700
about a very funny comedian
named Don Rickles.

746
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,600
(Laughing)

747
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,700
So, when a kid
from the neighbourhood

748
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,100
learns he's going to
the White House, he's excited.

749
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,000
"The President could be
a peanut farmer,

750
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,500
"but this kid's
still excited.

751
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,600
In fact, the President
was a peanut farmer."

752
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,800
(Laughing)

753
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,100
Peanut. Peanut farmer.

754
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,800
(Laughing)
What the heck is that?

755
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,900
Open this for me.

756
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,100
PAULY:
All in all, Odwa and I
had a great time.

757
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,000
He brought out an innocence in
me that I haven't experienced

758
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,500
in a while,
a childlike quality

759
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,700
that I lost somewhere
along the way.

760
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,500
And I brought a dirtiness
out of him,

761
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,800
a disgustingness that he's never
experienced before.

762
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,100
Whoa. Whoa!

763
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,800
Hey.

764
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,400
What's that?

765
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,100
¶ Hot one ¶

766
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,800
¶ Hot one, hot one, hot one,
ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay ¶

767
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,300
I got to get it.

768
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Stop.

769
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,100
Turn this--
What are you watching?

770
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,900
You know what?
Forget it, all right?

771
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,500
Just-- Just stop. Pack it up.
We're packing you up.

772
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,400
We're rolling you
to the orphanage.

773
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,800
Let's go back.

774
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,000
Odwa's a beast!

775
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,100
He's just like
his potential old man.

776
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,000
He's like an African Mini-Me.

777
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,700
And you want to come
to America for sure?

778
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,400
I just want to make sure
you're into it.

779
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Yes.

780
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,700
You want to come for sure,
right?

781
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,600
Yes.
Okay.

782
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,800
Is there anything else
you want to know about me?

783
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,300
No.

784
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300
You're good, right?
Yes.

785
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,800
So, you'll pack your bags?

786
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,100
Yes.
Okay.

787
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,300
All right.

788
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,600
Just make sure
you just don't say anything.

789
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,000
Yes.
Okay.

790
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,600
Bye.
Bye.

791
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Later.

792
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:14,500
¶

793
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,900
It was weird.

794
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,700
I went from a child to a parent
within a moment's time,

795
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,200
and I was cool with it.

796
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,300
I was totally cool with it.

797
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,400
¶

798
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,300
Last night
I could hardly sleep,

799
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,100
thinking about how much fun
I had with Odwa.

800
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,700
But today's a new day,

801
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,900
and I'm ready to experience
what life would be like

802
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,900
with another child.

803
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,800
Did Odwa talk to you?

804
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,200
Did he say it went well?

805
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,400
He said it was good.

806
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,500
How was the day
with Odwa?

807
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,700
You know what? He's--

808
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,300
He's a fantastic child.
You think so?

809
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,400
You know, but I do want to--
You know, I do want to be able

810
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
to see someone else.
Well, I said to you I'll--

811
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,800
Yeah,
I'll arrange another.

812
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Not that I don't like him

813
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,100
and not that he's not
in the running.

814
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,600
This is like
speed adopting.

815
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,900
Like, "Who's my next child?
Who's my next child?"

816
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,300
Well, I'm not into the business
of speed adopting.

817
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,700
It's like almost like,
I don't know, a pair of shoes.

818
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,700
You know, you buy a pair
of shoes, and then, like,

819
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,800
you know, a week later,
you're, like,

820
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,000
"Shit, I wish I would
have got Adidas.

821
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,500
Instead, I got Nikes."

822
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,600
Not that the Adidas aren't good
or the Nikes aren't good.

823
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,300
With respect, we do what is in
the best interest of the child.

824
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,500
But I've arranged for you
to meet Summila.

825
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,300
Is that a girl or a boy?
It's a young boy.

826
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,400
Okay, okay.

827
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,500
Summila.

828
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,700
Come in.

829
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,700
Yes. We have here.
My young boy, come in.

830
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,400
Oh, my God.

831
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,200
How's it going?
What's his--? He's cute.

832
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Summila, have a seat.
I like him.

833
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,500
I think I like him better
than Odwa.

834
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
Odwa's a little crazy.
He's a little nuts.

835
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,800
Like, I'm nuts too, and I don't
need-- You know,

836
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,200
he seems a sweet child.
Son, look at your father.

837
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,900
Look at your father.

838
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,200
Do you like it here,
or do you want to go?

839
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,000
He likes it here.

840
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,200
So this is going to be hard
for me to crack him.

841
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,500
So I got to hurry.

842
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,100
You know, I don't want to spend
any more time in your office.

843
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,300
Let me get going.
We just--

844
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,500
You know, it's all good.
Summila.

845
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,100
Hey, thank you for letting me
take your kids.

846
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,400
Yeah, well, thank you.

847
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,900
Oh, God. All right, he'll--
He'll be safe.

848
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,200
He'll be in good hands.
I trust you.

849
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,900
PAULY:
Tell him you'll be
in good hands.

850
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,200
In good hands, eh?
All right.

851
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,000
ALLEN: Thank you.
PAULY: Thanks, guys. Bye.

852
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,400
It looks like the tooth fairy

853
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,800
forgot to look
under somebody's pillow.

854
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,700
No sweet corn on the cob
for this kid.

855
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,900
I had no idea
they had hockey in Africa.

856
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,100
But it's okay, because I'm going
to take him to Dr. 90210

857
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,800
in Beverly Hills
and get him some veneers.

858
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,900
We're going to do some radio,
okay, buddy?

859
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,500
This is what we're going to do
in the States.

860
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,600
(Woman speaking foreign dialect)

861
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,200
We've got celebrity Tuesday,
which means--

862
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,000
PAULY:
Celebrity Tuesday?

863
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,800
Who the hell did they have here
last week, Vanilla Ice?

864
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,600
We've got our guest here in
studio with us: Pauly Shore.

865
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,500
Nice to see you guys.

866
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
So tell us about the friend

867
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,700
that you have here with you.

868
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,800
Hello. Hi.

869
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Hello.

870
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,100
Hello. What's your name?

871
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,600
Summila.

872
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,900
Why do you have Summila
with you today?

873
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,700
I'm looking to adopt
an African boy.

874
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,900
You too?

875
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,400
And why so?
What made you decide

876
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,500
to come and adopt
an African boy?

877
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,200
Because, you know, it's just--
It's in my heart.

878
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,600
Okay. So let's hear what
the callers have to say.

879
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,100
Who have we got
on the line?

880
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,000
MAN:
Hey, what's up?

881
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,500
Do you think it's a great idea
for Pauly

882
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,300
to adopt
a kiddie from here?

883
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,600
You know what?

884
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,500
I think Pauly
is going to be a great dad.

885
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,100
Pauly, do not worry about
all the other people.

886
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,000
As you guys call it, haters,
you know?

887
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,400
PAULY:
Exactly.

888
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,900
If Clay Aiken can be
a good mother,

889
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,300
I could be a great father.

890
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,800
(Speaking foreign dialect)

891
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,400
(Imitating foreign dialect)

892
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,900
Nothing to do
with calamari.

893
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
PAULY:
Summila's smart.

894
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,500
He's good-looking.

895
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,700
He's like baby Obama.

896
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,700
I'd vote for him.

897
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,200
Say, "I'm going putt-putting
with my new potential dad,

898
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,800
Pauly Shore."

899
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
I can't say it.

900
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,500
You wait, okay?

901
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,400
I'll do that.

902
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,900
PAULY:
Come on, son.

903
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,600
Let me give you your first
golf lesson, okay?

904
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,600
Hello. Good.

905
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,800
What colour do you want?

906
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,400
MAN: Pick a colour.
What colour?

907
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,700
Blue. Okay, we're going to have
two blue balls.

908
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,600
(Laughing)

909
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,100
See? My kind of guy.

910
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,000
(Sighing)

911
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,500
Sir, is this the age
that Tiger started around?

912
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,600
This is the age
that Tiger started.

913
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,100
Why do you think
I'm down here with him?

914
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,500
Get down on your stomach.
Come here, son.

915
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,000
Son, get on your stomach, son.

916
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,100
Here we go. You ready?

917
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,400
Huh?

918
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,500
Play pool.

919
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,000
There you go, my son.

920
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,100
PAULY:
There you go.

921
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,900
All right.

922
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,300
Are you coming with me?

923
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Yes.
You are?

924
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,900
Go.

925
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,700
Yay!

926
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,100
Yay!

927
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,200
¶ Can I say just one more thing
before I go ¶

928
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,200
¶ That I think that
you should know? ¶

929
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,300
Ow. Ow.

930
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,000
(Laughing)

931
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,600
¶ All the times
and all the laughs ¶

932
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,100
Where are you?

933
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,200
Where are you, Summila?

934
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:05,000
¶ Because I never liked you
anyway, hey, hey ¶

935
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,500
¶ La, da-da da-da da-da
da-da-da ¶

936
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,100
It's beautiful, huh?

937
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,000
Right?

938
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,100
(Laughing)

939
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
Isn't it?

940
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,400
If I take you back
to America with me,

941
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,400
we'll definitely come back here
and build sand castles, okay?

942
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,000
Pinkie swear.

943
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,200
Pinkie promise.

944
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,900
All right?

945
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,100
Let's go to that thing
that goes up on the mountain.

946
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,800
¶ La, da-da da-da da-da
da-da-da ¶

947
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,900
PAULY:
Summila's great. Odwa's great.

948
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,900
I might just have to adopt
two kids.

949
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,400
They'll be like
my Tupac and Biggie.

950
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,300
Okay, we're going
on the cable car.

951
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,100
We're going
on the cable car.

952
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,400
Look at us.
We're going up the mountain.

953
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Isn't this awesome?

954
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,700
Summila, do you want to look out
the thing?

955
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
(Tittering)

956
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,300
Are you excited
to be with me?

957
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,300
SUMMILA:
Yes.

958
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,700
PAULY:
Fun.

959
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,800
MAN:
Thank you, everyone.

960
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,600
Enjoy your stay on top
of the mountain.

961
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,800
We all made it.
(All applauding)

962
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,000
This is good stuff.

963
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,900
This is Summila.
Say hi to the people.

964
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,100
Hello.

965
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Aren't the girls pretty?

966
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,800
Look, they look like
Britney Spears.

967
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
(All laughing)

968
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Hug them.
Hug the girls.

969
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Hi!

970
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,000
PAULY:
See?

971
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,200
Isn't he beautiful?

972
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,800
GIRLS:
Yes, he is very cute.

973
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,200
Oh, look, I have a piece
of steak on the barbecue.

974
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Huh?
(Whimpering)

975
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,300
(Laughing)

976
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,600
Okay. Ow. Ow.

977
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,400
I got nieces and nephews.

978
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,700
Yeah.
So I got a--

979
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,400
That's great, because,
that's what kids--

980
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,300
She had the body of Beyoncé
and the head of a midget.

981
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
WOMAN:
Are you all right?

982
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,800
Just stay with the lady
for a second.

983
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,100
Okay, I'll--
Just hold on to him.

984
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,500
Hold on to him, okay?
Okay.

985
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,400
I'll hang on to him.
All right, thanks.

986
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,400
'Sup?
Hey.

987
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,700
How's it going, girl?

988
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,400
Oh, good. How are you?
Good.

989
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,100
What are you doing over here all
alone, little African princess?

990
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,000
So do you know much
about America?

991
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,900
I like
how your green stuff

992
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,100
matches with the green stuff
there.

993
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,200
Thank you.

994
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,800
What's your name?
Angela.

995
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,900
Nice to see you. Pauly.
Nice to see you.

996
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,900
Hold me like that.
(Laughing)

997
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,100
Feel. See my giraffe's neck?

998
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,600
You were telling me
what your favourite food was.

999
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,800
What is it?

1000
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,000
I was on Entourage recently.

1001
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,700
You see that HBO show
Entourage?

1002
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,700
Yeah.

1003
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,100
I got, like,
a really big part on that.

1004
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm, like, reoccurring
through the whole thing.

1005
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,600
Wow, I'm impressed.
Yeah.

1006
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,500
Maybe you should teach Pauly
some Xhosa.

1007
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Wouldn't that be fun?

1008
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,400
Can you go
wine-tasting?

1009
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,600
Right now?
Yeah.

1010
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,200
Let's do it.
You'll love it.

1011
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,300
You'll be okay.
You just wait here.

1012
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,900
Okay. Bye.

1013
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,200
Bye.

1014
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,600
You like it?
Yep.

1015
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,300
You do?
Yeah.

1016
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,800
Speak any language.

1017
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,900
(Speaking foreign dialect)
Yeah.

1018
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:31,800
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
I left my kid! I left my kid!

1019
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
Oh, my God!

1020
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,000
I left my kid!

1021
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,200
Summila!

1022
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,800
Oh, my God.
We got to turn it around.

1023
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,200
Can we turn it around, please?

1024
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,400
Turn this thing around.
Is there another tram?

1025
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
MAN:
There's another tram,

1026
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,600
but it's on top now.

1027
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,000
It's coming down.
Oh, my God.

1028
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,300
How long does it take for these
things to go back up?

1029
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,300
MAN:
It's probably an hour
to get here, yeah.

1030
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,500
An hour to go back up?

1031
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,800
Once again, my little head
thinking for my big head.

1032
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,100
You didn't mention
you had a kid with you.

1033
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,800
PAULY:
I forgot.

1034
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,200
You came up to me and you said,
"Let's go wine-tasting."

1035
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,100
ANGELA:
You should have told me.

1036
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,400
PAULY:
I forgot the kid was up there.

1037
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,000
MAN:
Do you want to go back up?

1038
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,100
Yes, I want to go back up.

1039
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,500
Can these things
go any faster, please?

1040
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,400
Can they go faster? Huh?

1041
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,200
Where's the opening?

1042
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I lost my son.

1043
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,100
Summila!

1044
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,200
Did you guys
see a little boy?

1045
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,400
A little boy, like,
this big with orange?

1046
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,200
He's wearing this orange--

1047
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,300
So you saw him?

1048
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,400
Yeah, I saw him.
Huh?

1049
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,800
Oh, my God.
ANGELA: You lost him.

1050
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Unbelievable.

1051
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,600
As big as this girl is,

1052
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,100
you'd think she'd look
over people and find him.

1053
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,900
I can't believe this.

1054
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,300
I'm such an idiot.

1055
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,700
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.

1056
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,000
It's my fault.

1057
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Hey, I'm the one
invited you.

1058
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,300
I know.
It is your fault.

1059
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,200
So, Lisa Leslie and I searched
for hours and hours

1060
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,700
on top of the mountain.

1061
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,700
You didn't see him?

1062
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,700
The little boy?

1063
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,800
And finally, through God's will,
I found my boy, my child,

1064
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,100
sitting next
to Weezy Jefferson.

1065
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,800
My son!

1066
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,000
Phew! Thank you so much
for watching my son.

1067
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,400
Oh, my God.

1068
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,000
You nearly got lost.

1069
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Thank you.

1070
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,400
No, I left him,
like an idiot.

1071
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,500
Thank you, sweetie.

1072
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,600
Hey.
Thank you very much.

1073
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,200
Thank you
for watching my son.

1074
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,700
How are you going to be a good
father, losing your son?

1075
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,400
Give me a hug,
my son.

1076
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,000
Oh.

1077
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,500
Now that I have Summila back,

1078
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,800
we're one big,
happy family.

1079
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,700
So now it's time
to get drunk.

1080
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,200
(Speaking foreign dialect)

1081
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,400
That sounds Spanish.

1082
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,400
Ask Summila what kind of wine
he wants.

1083
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,200
He's going to have a little too,
since he's my son.

1084
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,900
I'll get you arrested
for that.

1085
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,700
No, my African princess.
(Laughing)

1086
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm kidding.
(Both laughing)

1087
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,800
Oh, we got a real Eddie Murphy
in the car.

1088
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,100
ANGELA:
What do you think about me?

1089
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,100
You? You're the shit.
You're beautiful.

1090
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,800
The first time I saw you,
I thought you were Beyoncé.

1091
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,500
Really?

1092
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,400
Yeah.
(Laughing)

1093
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,800
You're kidding.

1094
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,100
PAULY:
Yeah, Beyoncé

1095
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,500
with the head of a midget.

1096
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,000
So show me the way.

1097
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,700
I'm just going to follow
your lead on it.

1098
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,400
Hello.
Hello.

1099
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
There you go.
Swish it up, son.

1100
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,000
Swish it up like this.

1101
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,400
ANGELA:
Yeah. Shake it a little bit.

1102
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,700
PAULY:
Shake it up.

1103
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,100
ANGELA:
Good.

1104
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,800
Drink to family right here.

1105
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,000
Here, come on.

1106
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,300
Take this.

1107
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,600
Wow.

1108
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,400
This is nice.

1109
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,800
PAULY:
It's very-- I taste a lot
of stuff in it.

1110
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,200
So it's, as I said,
been made for a long time.

1111
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,700
Wow!
Wow!

1112
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,700
That's bam!

1113
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,600
Man, this chick
drinks more than me.

1114
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,000
She's like an Afro-aholic.

1115
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,800
Can you be his mother
for a second?

1116
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,100
ANGELA:
Let me try.

1117
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,400
If I can't handle him,
I will tie his hands.

1118
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,300
Let's drink.

1119
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,800
PAULY: Where did he go?
ANGELA: Right here.

1120
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,200
PAULY:
Come on. Get back here.

1121
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,200
ANGELA:
Okay, don't go up.

1122
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,600
Get back here! Yo!

1123
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,100
Somalia!

1124
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,800
You know what I think
it is? I think it's--

1125
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,700
Uh-huh?
Mm.

1126
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,600
I think it's because he doesn't
have any teeth or something.

1127
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,800
Doesn't have tooth?

1128
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,000
No, you should look at it.
It's funny.

1129
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,200
What do you mean,
he doesn't have tooth?

1130
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,200
He lost his teeth.
I don't know what it is.

1131
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,200
In a boating accident
or something.

1132
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,600
Is it?

1133
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,500
What do you mean,
doesn't have any teeth?

1134
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,200
He has everything.
PAULY: Oh, my God.

1135
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,400
Oh, my God. Shit.
Oh, my God.

1136
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,400
What's your name?
Inga.

1137
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,700
PAULY:
No!

1138
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,300
I can't believe this. Ah!

1139
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,700
VAL:
What happened?

1140
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,800
What the hell have you done?

1141
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,700
Unbelievable.

1142
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,700
What are you doing here?

1143
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,400
Picked up the wrong kid.

1144
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,300
I'm not going back there,
wasting my bloody time,

1145
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,800
my fuel, my car.

1146
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,200
PAULY:
And who do you think's paying

1147
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,700
for her fuel, her car
and her time?

1148
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,200
Me! I don't need to hear this
from Val right now.

1149
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,400
I'm the star of Bio-Dome!

1150
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,700
ANGELA:
I mean, really,
what were you thinking?

1151
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,800
What were you thinking?

1152
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,100
How can you be a father,

1153
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,900
yet you can't even take care
of a kid for just one lousy day?

1154
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,400
You are just so lousy!

1155
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,500
You just make
a lousy father.

1156
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,700
You're the whole reason
why this thing happened

1157
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,800
from the beginning.

1158
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,200
Hey, don't blame me for this,
okay?

1159
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,900
You are just a lousy father!

1160
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,400
No, you're the reason,
because you were looking at me

1161
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,700
and you said, "Come over here."
(Shouting in foreign dialect)

1162
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,300
You know what? Screw this.
You know what? Drop her off.

1163
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,200
Val, stop the car.
Stop the car.

1164
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,800
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.

1165
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,000
Huh? Go. Come on.

1166
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,100
(Angela shouting
in foreign dialect)

1167
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,500
You know what I mean?

1168
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,700
I do. I do understand.

1169
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,100
Let's just go
to the radio station.

1170
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,400
Okay, I'll take you there.
Sorry about that.

1171
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,500
We got to get on the air.

1172
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,400
(Speaking foreign dialect)

1173
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,300
Where are your parents at?

1174
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,600
Come on.

1175
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,600
We're on in--
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1176
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,900
What's going on now?
I got to get on the air.

1177
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,800
Pauly Shore just ran
into the studio here.

1178
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,200
Whoa.
What is going on?

1179
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,100
I got to get on the air.
What are you doing here?

1180
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,200
Why did you just burst in here?
If there's anyone out there

1181
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,700
over at Cable Mountain,

1182
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,100
please call
if you've seen a kid

1183
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,400
on top of the main mountain
with no teeth.

1184
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,700
Please, someone call up.

1185
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,900
WOMAN:
So if someone finds a boy

1186
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,100
without the teeth
on Cable Mountain,

1187
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,600
tell them to bring him here
over to MFM studios.

1188
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,400
PAULY:
I've got to find
this guy's parents.

1189
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,600
What's your name?
What's your name?

1190
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,100
Please come and fetch him here.
Are you stupid or something?

1191
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,200
How could you lose a kid?
Just keep an eye on that one.

1192
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,600
Just don't lose that one.
PAULY: Don't let him go.

1193
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,100
Hello, MFM.
Good evening.

1194
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,500
MAN:
Pauly, man, you suck.

1195
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,200
What's wrong with you?

1196
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,400
I-- I made a mistake.

1197
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,800
Do you think all Africans
look the same or something?

1198
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,100
(Laughing)
Is that a joke to you?

1199
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,900
Okay. No, it's not a joke.

1200
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,300
Find Summila.
Someone bring him along.

1201
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,100
Thanks, you guys.
Okay, cool.

1202
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,100
Thanks for having me.
Please go wait outside now,

1203
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,100
because you've messed up
the show now.

1204
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,200
And just look after this one.

1205
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,900
Don't lose him now as well,
please.

1206
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,100
I can't get arrested
for this, can I?

1207
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,000
Well, you lost a kid.

1208
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,500
You lost a kid.
It's called negligence.

1209
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,500
PAULY:
I guess the moral of the story
is don't drink and adopt.

1210
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,600
(Speaking foreign dialect)
That idiot!

1211
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,300
Oh, my God!

1212
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,700
PAULY:
I've bathed a kid,

1213
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,700
I've stolen a kid,

1214
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,500
I've lost a kid.

1215
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,300
I've mistreated
more black children

1216
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,300
than the justice system.

1217
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,300
Inga. Inga, baby.

1218
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,800
This is my son, man.

1219
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,900
You can't
tell the difference?

1220
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,300
Your child is not
up for adoption?

1221
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,500
No! You can't adopt children.

1222
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,100
You don't just steal them
like that.

1223
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,300
Please, get away from me.

1224
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,300
Hey, before I go
and call my family.

1225
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,600
That's my kid!

1226
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,300
Oh!
Look at him!

1227
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,500
My God!
SUMMILA: I don't like this.

1228
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,700
PAULY:
I don't care what anybody says.

1229
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,700
These two black kids
look alike.

1230
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,700
Come on.
Just leave me.

1231
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,500
I was able to bring Summila
back to the orphanage

1232
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,600
the next morning
because Allen fell for the bit

1233
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,500
"Whenever a kid is sleeping,
don't wake him."

1234
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,000
Pretend I'm Allen.

1235
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,400
Hey, so how was the day
with Pauly?

1236
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,800
Did he lose you?
I heard he lost you.

1237
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,700
He was good, right?

1238
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,900
Let me see the teeth.

1239
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,000
(Laughing)

1240
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,200
And while I was talking
to Allen,

1241
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,400
he told me how expensive it was
going to be for me

1242
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,300
to actually adopt a kid,

1243
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,700
so I called my agent
back in L.A.

1244
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,100
to book me a one-nighter.

1245
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,700
The show's tomorrow night,

1246
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,700
so I had to go back to the hotel
and get some sleepy.

1247
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,400
Nighty-night!

1248
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:08,600
¶

1249
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,700
I just hope Allen gives me
another kid,

1250
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,700
preferably one that comes
with a GPS.

1251
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,700
ALLEN:
So you okay?

1252
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,900
I see you look tired.

1253
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,300
Yeah, it was--
What's your problem?

1254
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,800
Well, just we slept a lot.
It was good.

1255
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,100
We just hung out together
all day.

1256
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,600
Look, you said
on the one hand,

1257
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,900
Odwa was a bit mad.

1258
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,200
And now you say you slept
with Summila.

1259
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,400
I didn't sleep with him.

1260
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,600
It wasn't like
I slept with him.

1261
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,300
No, I didn't mean--
We just kind of, you know--

1262
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,600
It's just--
You fell asleep.

1263
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,500
I definitely like Summila
a little bit better that Odwa.

1264
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,400
He's nuts, this kid.

1265
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,200
Summila is--
Is a sweetheart of a child.

1266
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,900
Are you not perhaps nuts?

1267
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,700
Let's see who else you have.

1268
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,200
I've got Faith for you.
Who is it?

1269
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,600
Faith is her name.
Oh. So a girl.

1270
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,700
Beautiful girl, yeah.
Okay, cool.

1271
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,600
Faith!

1272
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,400
Oh, my God.

1273
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,100
Wow!

1274
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,500
Hi.

1275
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,200
Nice to see you.

1276
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,700
How's it going?
Your name's Faith?

1277
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,100
Is that your real name?
Have a seat.

1278
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,200
Really? Wouldn't she have, like,
more of an African name?

1279
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,200
Well, many African people
have names like "Faith"

1280
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:14,300
and "Beauty," and I've come
across a guy

1281
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,000
with the name
"Astonishment."

1282
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,300
Astonishment's his name?
Yes.

1283
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,600
Who's your favourite singer
or rapper or anything?

1284
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,300
Oh, Beyoncé?
See, I know Beyoncé,

1285
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,800
and I'm friends
with Jay-Z.

1286
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,300
I'm down with the whole
East Coast crew, so, like,

1287
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,000
if this thing works out,
like, I swear,

1288
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
like, within a month,
she'll be in a Beyoncé video,

1289
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,500
probably playing her daughter
or something.

1290
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,900
Well, I don't want to go there.

1291
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,300
PAULY:
What do you think about that?

1292
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,400
Look, she's smiling.
ALLEN: I see you smiling.

1293
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,700
(Laughing)

1294
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,000
Is that cool? She's quiet.

1295
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
ALLEN:
Thank you, Pauly.

1296
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,700
You know what it says
about the quiet ones?

1297
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,800
Those are
the mischievous ones.

1298
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,600
Excuse me.
Are you mischievous?

1299
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,200
You are, right?

1300
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,500
(Pauly laughing)

1301
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,300
Okay, here we go.

1302
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,700
Okay. Have a good time.
Okay.

1303
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,800
I love her hair too.
It's beautiful, by the way.

1304
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,100
I hate when, like, people put--
Like, the girls,

1305
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,300
they put all the stuff
in their hair.

1306
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,300
This is à la naturelle.

1307
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,400
African-za-za-za-style.

1308
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,800
Okay, Pauly. Thank you.
PAULY: Here we go.

1309
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,200
Bye, Faith.

1310
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,200
She's going to be
in a hip-hop video, yo.

1311
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,200
Later.

1312
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,600
Just when I thought my heart
was filled with the two boys,

1313
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,500
my heart opened up
to a new passageway.

1314
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,800
This is probably
how George Bush felt

1315
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,400
when he met Condoleezza Rice.

1316
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,800
Have you ever seen a stand-up
comedian before?

1317
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,300
No? Do you know what
a stand-up comedian does?

1318
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,100
You don't?
No.

1319
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,700
He grabs the mike,

1320
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,500
and he goes onstage
in front of all the people

1321
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,800
and he tells jokes.

1322
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,500
That's what I do.

1323
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,700
(Scatting)

1324
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,300
Since my show
was later that night,

1325
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,400
Faith and I stopped by a local
bar to do a warm-up set.

1326
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,900
(Indistinct chattering)

1327
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,500
All the way from Hollywood,
California,

1328
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,400
you've seen him in such movies
as Encino Man,

1329
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,900
Bio-Dome, Jury Duty,

1330
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,500
Son in Law.

1331
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,300
You got to give me
an introduction,

1332
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,600
because I can't come out
without introduction, right?

1333
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,400
If you've ever seen Russell
Simmons' Def Comedy Jam,

1334
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,800
those brothers keep it real.

1335
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,600
If I'm going to impress
my daughter,

1336
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,000
I can't back down
like a punk.

1337
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,700
I'm in Africa. I got to come
at these brothers hard.

1338
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,800
Yeah, you know, actually, a lot
of people think I came here

1339
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,900
to Africa to tell jokes.
I actually came here to get HIV.

1340
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,100
Did someone just throw a drink
on me,

1341
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,200
or is that piss
rolling down my leg?

1342
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,100
I've been eating that--

1343
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,200
That goddamn meat that you have
on the boards.

1344
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,800
(All laughing)

1345
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,100
I go to a lot of clubs
in Los Angeles.

1346
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,800
I hate going down
the red carpet.

1347
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,500
They always ask me to go down
the red carpet.

1348
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Here in Africa,
you don't have carpet.

1349
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,000
(Inaudible)

1350
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,400
I'm just kidding.
You guys have carpet.

1351
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,400
It's just been urinated on.
Anyways--

1352
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,400
MAN:
Oh.

1353
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,200
But--

1354
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,000
Security to the stage.
Security to the stage.

1355
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,200
Security to the stage.

1356
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,200
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1357
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,100
Okay. But thank you guys

1358
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,800
for having me in your beautiful
establishment,

1359
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,100
seriously, and I'll see you
next time.

1360
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,300
Come on, babe.
Thank you, guys.

1361
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,100
Bye.

1362
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,600
That was fun, huh?
Yeah.

1363
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,000
That was the first time
I ever played a room

1364
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
with a two-tooth minimum.

1365
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,400
VAL:
Have they recognized Pauly?

1366
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,500
PAULY:
If I'm going to wind up

1367
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,800
adopting Faith,
she's got to be fashionable,

1368
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,700
so I told Val to take us
shopping.

1369
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,300
Plus, I heard Madonna say
that in Africa,

1370
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,700
Ed Hardy shirts
are half off.

1371
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,400
This doesn't look like
there's a place

1372
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,300
that there's a mall
around here.

1373
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,000
Is there a market,
an African market?

1374
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,900
What is this place?

1375
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,900
Yeah, we'll-- There is for sure
some markets

1376
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,700
and shopping places.

1377
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,600
PAULY:
Man, this place is scary.

1378
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,500
Where's Val taking us?

1379
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,300
I had no idea there was
a South Central in South Africa.

1380
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,300
VAL:
Here we are, guys.

1381
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,500
This is what
you were looking for.

1382
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,400
This is a market.

1383
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,200
Go. Get, get, get, get, get.
Go, do shopping.

1384
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,700
Spend all your money.
This is an authentic market.

1385
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,300
Promise me you'll bring me
something, please.

1386
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,700
If you come back
without something for me,

1387
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,500
there's trouble.

1388
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,800
Get!

1389
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,600
This place smells like urine
and chicken.

1390
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,200
Is this an authentic
African market?

1391
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,500
No.

1392
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,600
This isn't it.

1393
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,800
We got to get the hell
out of here.

1394
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,000
This isn't the place
that you were talking about.

1395
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,600
Stay. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

1396
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,900
PAULY:
No, no, no.

1397
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,900
What the hell is this
Elizabeth Taylor,

1398
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,900
lead singer of Quiet Riot bitch
doing now?

1399
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,600
She can't leave us out here.

1400
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:14,300
It's like we're chum
and these people are sharks.

1401
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,800
Oh, I guess
Pauly Shore is Dead

1402
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,800
isn't going to just
be a movie anymore.

1403
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,700
Is this an authentic
African market here?

1404
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,200
I'm just in town.

1405
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,500
I'm adopting a child
from Africa.

1406
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:38,400
And I'm supposed to take her
shopping today, and--

1407
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,900
Where do I get a taxi from?
A taxi?

1408
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,900
I just need to call the taxi
and just have them meet me here.

1409
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,000
If they meet me here, then I can
tell them where to go.

1410
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,200
Okay.
PAULY: Yes.

1411
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,400
Where are you from?

1412
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,300
I'm from Los Angeles,
California.

1413
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,400
In the United States?
Yes, from the United States.

1414
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,700
(Whistling)

1415
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,700
And I was wondering if you have
a telephone

1416
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,400
we can use
to call a taxi?

1417
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,500
Mm-mm. No way.
PAULY: No?

1418
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,200
Do you think I can get
killed out here?

1419
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,000
Yes.

1420
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,700
And when I realized
that the black man

1421
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,200
was trying to keep
the white man down

1422
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,500
when it comes to hailing a taxi,
I decided right then

1423
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:17,900
it was time for Faith and I
to do a little shopping.

1424
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:21,100
(Speaking in foreign dialect)
Those look good.

1425
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,000
Hey, hey, hey!

1426
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,700
PAULY:
I think I just found
Flavor Flav's mom.

1427
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,400
So after Faith and I
were shopping,

1428
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,700
we got a little hungry,

1429
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,400
so we decided to stop
by the mall's food court.

1430
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,500
Is this like
Panda Express?

1431
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,700
Let's keep walking.
Hopefully, we won't get stabbed.

1432
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,800
Faith and I even bumped
into a famous musician.

1433
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,500
Macy Gray, fantastic Grammy
Award-winning artist

1434
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,000
on Epic Records.

1435
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,200
She's-- Look at that face.
Hi, baby.

1436
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,900
So these are your three kids?

1437
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,700
Can I take one?

1438
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,800
Yeah.

1439
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,900
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

1440
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,400
catch a tiger by the toe,

1441
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,600
if it hollers, let it go,
eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

1442
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,600
(Grunting)

1443
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,100
All right, I'm grabbing kids
left and right.

1444
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,700
Come on, Faith.
You got a sister.

1445
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,100
It was like
I was an adoption junkie.

1446
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,000
Every kid I came across,
I had to grab.

1447
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,600
Hi, I'm going
to take your son.

1448
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,800
And in the middle of my crazy
euphoria, I realized,

1449
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,300
"Shit, I've got to be onstage
in less than two hours."

1450
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,700
And at that moment,
Faith and I stumbled upon

1451
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,800
our guardian angel.

1452
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,400
What's up, my man?

1453
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,000
Hello!
Hello.

1454
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,600
Are you the main guy here?
Hey.

1455
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,100
Are you the president
of this area right here?

1456
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,500
His name was Peter Mata.

1457
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,400
He stood 6'4".

1458
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,500
A giant with a heart to match.

1459
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,700
And word on the street was he
won sexiest man of Africa.

1460
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,500
But more importantly,
he had a phone.

1461
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,700
So I can use your phone
to call a taxi, right?

1462
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,800
Okay.

1463
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,800
Are you on Verizon or AT&T?

1464
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,400
You've got the penthouse suite.

1465
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,200
You're like the P. Diddy
of African-za-za!

1466
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,800
I want to see your spot.

1467
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,500
Show me your spot.

1468
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,400
This is tight work in here.

1469
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,500
PETER:
I'm staying here.

1470
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,800
PAULY:
This is it.

1471
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,500
Yes.

1472
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,500
Do you have a phone
I can use?

1473
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,500
This is my room.

1474
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,500
This is good.
I like it.

1475
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,500
There you go.

1476
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,000
That's how you roll, right?

1477
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,800
I like your headquarters.

1478
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,600
I like this hook.
Do you bring girls here?

1479
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,500
Yes.

1480
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,100
Have you gotten girls pregnant
in this room?

1481
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,700
Yes.

1482
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,200
You've gotten girls pregnant
in here?

1483
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,300
(Laughing)

1484
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,200
Oh, Peter Mata!

1485
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,100
Peter Mata,
you're so big!

1486
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,200
Oh, you're so big,
Peter Mata!

1487
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,500
Oh, do it to me good,
Peter Mata!

1488
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,300
Is that what you do to them,
huh, you bastard?

1489
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,700
So, Peter called us a taxi
and sent us on our way.

1490
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,700
Bye, Peter Mata.
We'll see you later.

1491
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,700
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

1492
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,900
You're living large.

1493
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,700
He's a nice man,
that Peter Mata.

1494
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,300
So after walking
for hours all day,

1495
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,600
it was going to be nice
to sit back and relax

1496
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,600
in our own taxi.

1497
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,800
Can you take us to the beach?

1498
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,300
No problem?

1499
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,400
Okay, come on in,
sweetie.

1500
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,000
It's rainy out there today.

1501
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,100
How's it going? Good?

1502
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,600
Are you guys
going to the beach?

1503
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,800
Want to smoke some herb?

1504
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,200
(Police siren wailing)

1505
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,000
Uh-oh, here they come.
They're coming to get us.

1506
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,400
We've got
the blood diamonds.

1507
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,300
Right?

1508
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,900
Yeah, bro. We're getting
blood diamond, boy!

1509
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,200
(Speaking gibberish)

1510
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,600
Click, click, click, click,
click, click, click, click!

1511
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,800
Hi.

1512
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,700
Hi.

1513
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,100
Hi.

1514
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,200
(Laughing)

1515
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,700
The smell that I was
experiencing

1516
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:50,100
was somewhere between
the perfume section at Barneys

1517
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,900
and horse shit,

1518
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,100
and that smell was me.

1519
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:59,400
Either way, Faith and I were
happy that we got picked up

1520
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,600
by the Boston Celtics:
Kevin Garnett,

1521
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,800
Paul Pierce,

1522
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,000
Rondo.
They were all there.

1523
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,400
Because I'm down with them,

1524
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,800
and they don't want
to leave their little teammate

1525
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,900
in the streets.

1526
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,300
All right, thank you.

1527
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,600
Bye.
ALL: Bye.

1528
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,900
One more "click, click."

1529
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,700
(All clicking tongues)

1530
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,000
(Chuckling)

1531
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,800
Later.

1532
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,500
Even though I was running late
for my show,

1533
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,200
I needed to stop by and get
my mom a blood diamond.

1534
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,000
After all,
it was her favourite movie.

1535
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,100
No, you don't want
to get blood diamonds.

1536
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,900
Oh, you don't?
No, you don't.

1537
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,700
I thought that's what
you guys had.

1538
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:34,400
WOMAN:
No, no, no.

1539
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,600
PAULY:
I wanted to get Faith

1540
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,400
a blood diamond,

1541
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,900
but I didn't want
to spoil her.

1542
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,400
And to be honest,
I might not pick her.

1543
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,800
I like to buy things for people
that actually talk to me.

1544
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,300
Thanks.

1545
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,100
All right, sweetie,
thank you.

1546
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,100
(Seagull squawking)

1547
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,700
So I talked to the orphanage,

1548
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,900
and they said I could bring you
home a little late.

1549
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,300
So you'll be here okay
by yourself at the room?

1550
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,900
Yeah, don't worry.
I'll be all right.

1551
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,400
Aw.
Just go make people laugh.

1552
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,500
Aw.

1553
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,200
Is it me,
or does Faith's hair

1554
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,000
look like Darth Vader's helmet?

1555
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,900
(Clicking tongue)

1556
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,900
Aw. Okay, bye.

1557
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,500
Okay, bye.

1558
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:14,000
Sweetie, this is your place,
so enjoy it.

1559
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,100
Okay.

1560
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,100
Bye.
Bye.

1561
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,200
RADIO HOST:
Yes, African mutts.

1562
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,100
If you know what it is, it's all
about the hardest-working party

1563
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,400
in the continent.

1564
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,600
And tonight, it's all about
Pauly Shore, man.

1565
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,600
Don't forget Pauly Shore was in
some of these great,

1566
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,800
great movies,
like the Son in Law,

1567
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,700
Bio-Dome, Encino Man,

1568
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,200
and, most recently,
on HBO's Entourage.

1569
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,100
And I hear that Pauly Shore
wants to adopt a baby, man.

1570
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,000
Yes, that's great.

1571
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,900
We've got a caller on line.
Boom! Hello, caller.

1572
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,600
CALLER:
I just wanted to say when
I heard that Pauly Shore

1573
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,500
was coming down to Africa,
I was pretty excited,

1574
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,100
because I've always
been a fan of Pauly Shore.

1575
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,200
RADIO HOST:
Yes.

1576
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,500
CALLER:
He's the funniest white cat

1577
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,200
I know, and he--

1578
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,800
And not a lot of white
comedians can make me laugh,

1579
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,000
but Pauly has a little bit
of Africa inside him,

1580
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,100
I can tell you that.

1581
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,700
RADIO HOST:
Yeah, I know he does.

1582
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,600
Thank you, caller, huh?
CALLER: No doubt, man.

1583
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,400
Pauly Shore!

1584
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,500
(Radio host laughing)

1585
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,300
RADIO HOST:
Boom, dynamite.

1586
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,200
(Cheering and applauding)

1587
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,300
What's up, Africans?

1588
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,400
Jesus, where are all
my brothers at?

1589
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,800
How are you guys? How are
you guys feeling tonight?

1590
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
(All applauding)

1591
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,400
I knew Africa had rhinos,

1592
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,900
but not albinos.

1593
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,100
Are you guys sick of actresses
coming over here

1594
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,000
and adopting your babies?

1595
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,100
(All laughing)

1596
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,300
Tired of Angelina Jolie
coming over here,

1597
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,500
taking your children.

1598
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,500
What she doesn't realize
is someday

1599
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,100
these kids are going to grow up
and rob her.

1600
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,700
(All laughing)

1601
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,700
(Cheering and applauding)

1602
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,200
Like, "Quick, Maddox, let's get
the fuck back to Jo'burg."

1603
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,300
It's weird.

1604
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,100
Here I was on the other side
of the world

1605
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,800
making thousands
of people laugh.

1606
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,900
But all I really wanted to do
was go back to my hotel room

1607
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,100
and do my clicking sound
with Faith.

1608
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:17,200
Am I growing up?

1609
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,400
Have I turned a new leaf?

1610
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,800
I was truly moved
by the children of Africa.

1611
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,900
That's my time.
Thank you guys so much.

1612
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,300
Thank you! I love you!
Peace!

1613
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,300
(All cheering and applauding)

1614
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:41,700
¶

1615
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,200
What?

1616
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,600
You guys were the one
that wanted to come here

1617
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,200
and have sex
amongst yourselves.

1618
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,900
Oh, my God.
That's what you said.

1619
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,000
Sweetie, I'm back. I've got
to get back to the orphan--

1620
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,000
She robbed me.

1621
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,100
Who?

1622
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,000
Holy shit.

1623
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,900
She took all my clothes.

1624
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,700
She did!
(Laughing)

1625
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,300
Oh, my God.
There should be some stuff.

1626
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,900
I got fucking robbed.

1627
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,000
This is unbelievable.

1628
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Oh, Pauly,
that's so cute, man.

1629
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,400
Don't tell me
she stole the--

1630
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,900
Oh, my God.
She stole the diamond.

1631
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,600
She took my mom's diamond.

1632
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,000
She stole my computer,
my shoes, my condoms.

1633
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Condoms?

1634
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,600
Yes, my condoms.

1635
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,800
No condoms?

1636
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,700
No, they took everything.

1637
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,500
Well, we were going to rock
your world, but, you know,

1638
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,600
this is Africa, man.

1639
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,800
You guys are not
from Africa.

1640
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,300
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

1641
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,300
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, baby.

1642
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,300
Oh.

1643
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,300
Don't go. Come on.

1644
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,300
It would have
been great.

1645
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,900
You guys, don't leave.
Come on.

1646
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,500
We've got to go.
I've been here a week.

1647
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,500
I haven't got any action.
People waiting for us.

1648
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,800
Things to do.
Please.

1649
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,800
It's been good.

1650
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,500
If we were back in the States,

1651
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,700
this would not
be happening.

1652
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:07,700
Don't these girls know
who I used to be?

1653
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:17,500
¶

1654
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,200
It has come time
to form my opinion.

1655
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,000
I had to make a choice.

1656
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,600
Was it going to
Odwa, Summila,

1657
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,400
or that little bitch
that robbed me?

1658
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,900
¶ Once again ¶

1659
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:32,000
I felt like a contestant
on elimiDATE.

1660
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,700
No. No, no.

1661
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,900
¶ Is this all there really is? ¶

1662
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,000
Put your feet-- Whoa!

1663
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,300
WOMAN:
Okay, now you can push
off the wall with your feet.

1664
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,300
You did good.
You did good, son.

1665
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,500
¶ Once again ¶

1666
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,600
Shh, shh.

1667
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,900
¶ I asked myself ¶

1668
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,100
You want to go over?
No.

1669
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,200
Are you sure?
Yes.

1670
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,300
(Laughing)

1671
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:05,000
¶ This is not me ¶

1672
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,100
Ow. Ow.

1673
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,000
Where are you?

1674
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,900
Where are you, Summila?

1675
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,500
¶ I am diving ¶

1676
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,800
¶ I am running ¶

1677
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,700
This is Summila.
Say hi to the people.

1678
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,000
Hello.

1679
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,800
Aren't the girls pretty?

1680
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,400
Look, they look
like Britney Spears.

1681
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,400
(All laughing)

1682
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,400
Hug them.
Hug the girls.

1683
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,700
Hi!

1684
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:26,700
Isn't he beautiful?

1685
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,900
WOMEN:
Yes, he is very cute.

1686
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,500
¶ Lift me up
to higher grounds ¶

1687
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:48,900
¶

1688
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,400
(Speaking foreign dialect)

1689
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,500
Yes!

1690
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,700
¶ Get away from me ¶

1691
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,400
ALLEN:
All right. So you're here.

1692
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,100
PAULY: Hi.
Welcome. Great.

1693
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,500
How was your week?
Have a seat.

1694
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,500
Well, I had a very busy,
busy schedule.

1695
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,000
I know. There's lots of stuff
going on in Africa.

1696
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,700
It's crazy down here.
It's fun, though.

1697
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:16,600
There's, like,
so many things to do.

1698
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,100
It's like a fair every day.

1699
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,100
Well, I can just tell you,

1700
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,100
I've actually consulted
your references,

1701
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,300
and we did the screening,
and we find you to be credible,

1702
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,100
so thank you for those
kind of details

1703
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,700
that you provided for us,
thank you.

1704
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,600
There's-- All my gym's paid.

1705
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,000
All my car payments.

1706
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,100
My-- My rent.

1707
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,200
So they would not
have a problem at all.

1708
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,900
All right,
so that's the information I got.

1709
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,400
I just want to hear from you.

1710
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,700
I thought about it a lot.

1711
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,700
I tried to figure out
what the best child is for me.

1712
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,500
Which one
have you decided upon?

1713
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,900
And my choice is Summila.

1714
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,000
I'm shocked.

1715
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Well, I know.

1716
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,200
You would probably think
I'd like the chubby one.

1717
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,800
I don't like you
to refer to Odwa

1718
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,400
as "the chubby one," please.
I don't like that.

1719
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,500
Well, no, I don't mean, like,
"chubby" in a bad way.

1720
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,700
Listen, let me just--

1721
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:02,600
I just mean
that he's a little bit--

1722
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,000
He's a little bit hairy, so--

1723
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,400
You took my Summila.

1724
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,400
You know what my information is?

1725
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,800
That you lost that child.

1726
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,800
Summila.

1727
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,700
If we can wrap it up here

1728
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:12,800
and just kind of
get out of here.

1729
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,700
Hey, buddy. Yo, my man.

1730
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,500
Tell me.

1731
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,300
Do you want to
go with this man?

1732
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,400
No.

1733
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,400
PAULY:
Summila?

1734
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,000
ALLEN:
You don't want to go with him?

1735
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,600
Wait, can I have an intimate
moment with my son?

1736
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,400
Summila, look at me.

1737
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,200
I'm not going to allow you
to interrogate my child.

1738
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,500
Summila?
Did you brainwash him?

1739
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,400
No, this child--
Summila?

1740
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,100
ALLEN:
Okay, you can go.

1741
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,400
Summila.
I understand that

1742
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,300
you're not interested
in going with this man.

1743
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:47,100
I hope your teeth never grow
back, you son of a bitch.

1744
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,500
(Door closing)

1745
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,500
I actually didn't want him.

1746
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,200
I wanted the chubby kid.

1747
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,300
I didn't want to say it
in front of-- No, no.

1748
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,600
All right, listen here--
I didn't want to say it--

1749
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,400
No, I didn't want to--
Odwa, come in.

1750
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,800
ALLEN:
You have been in a bar.

1751
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,800
Yes. Number one.

1752
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,500
Number one!

1753
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,200
Yeah, yeah!
ALLEN: You want me to trust you.

1754
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,900
Odwa, you tell me.

1755
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,200
PAULY:
My man, number one.

1756
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,900
ALLEN: How are you?
Good.

1757
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,100
Do you want to go
with this man?

1758
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,700
No!

1759
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,800
Now, this child does not want
to go with you either.

1760
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,900
What?

1761
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:15,800
ALLEN:
This child does not want

1762
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,100
to go with you.

1763
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,500
You can go. Thank you.

1764
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,400
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

1765
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,100
ALLEN: Odwa.
Step back.

1766
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,000
Yo, my man.

1767
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,300
It's amazing.

1768
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,700
You must have brainwashed
these guys or something.

1769
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,600
I find it strange that you don't
ask me where Faith is.

1770
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,700
Faith actually robbed me,
which I wanted to talk about.

1771
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,300
Faith is still gone.

1772
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,900
I'm just going to go.

1773
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,300
You should be in prison.

1774
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,600
Yeah.
I actually think-- Listen.

1775
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,700
This is your passport.

1776
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:45,900
Take your passport
and please leave my office.

1777
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,500
Do you have any other kids
in the pamphlet that--

1778
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,400
Even if I have children
on the pamphlet,

1779
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,500
even if I have
other children--

1780
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,800
I'm going to go.
Yeah, leave my office.

1781
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,900
You're not good
for this country,

1782
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,000
you're not good
for its children,

1783
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,300
and thank you very much.

1784
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,600
You've wasted my time.
Thank you.

1785
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,900
All right, take care.
Bye-bye.

1786
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,300
Bye.

1787
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,700
I've just had enough of him.
I just can't believe

1788
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:04,200
that I've exposed myself
to such horrendous activity.

1789
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,300
Unbelievable.

1790
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,100
PAULY:
I don't understand
what happened.

1791
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,900
I mean, you said I was going
to be a good dad.

1792
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,900
You said everything
was going good.

1793
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,400
You threw the bones, you had
the one thing with the girl.

1794
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,600
With the girl, if you know where
she is, I need my stuff back.

1795
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,200
So, what happened?

1796
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,200
I know. It's just--

1797
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,700
So now what
am I supposed to do?

1798
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,400
You're trying to hook me up
with your daughter?

1799
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,100
Really?

1800
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,600
I mean, it would be nice to have
dinner with a nice girl,

1801
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,900
I mean,
if she's a nice girl.

1802
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:53,100
I mean--

1803
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,400
Do you have
a cellphone number?

1804
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,300
You've got the --

1805
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,500
You still have
the Nokia phone?

1806
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,000
You haven't gotten--
You haven't upgraded it

1807
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,800
to the BlackBerry yet?

1808
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,700
Can I throw the bones
one more time?

1809
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:06,200
Letting us know if I'm going to,
you know,

1810
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,600
hook up with your daughter
or not.

1811
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,400
I can--

1812
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:36,100
¶

1813
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,000
Hello. Are you Pauly?

1814
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,200
Yes. Who are you?

1815
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,800
I'm the Sangoma's
daughter.

1816
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,400
PAULY:
If the Sangoma is her mother,

1817
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,700
then Sam Jackson is my father.

1818
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,300
How is she your mother?

1819
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:56,500
Well, I've been adopted.

1820
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,100
Interesting.

1821
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,800
She told me lots
about you.

1822
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,600
And what was that?

1823
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,400
That you're a nice guy.

1824
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,200
Yes.
Sweet.

1825
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,200
Mm-hm.
Good-looking,

1826
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,400
so I was quite excited.

1827
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,300
Don't be shy now.

1828
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,200
Come on.

1829
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,200
(Laughing)

1830
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,400
So, what's your name?
Dawn-Mari.

1831
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,800
Dawn-Mari.
Look at your lips.

1832
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,600
(Both laughing)

1833
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,000
They're beautiful.
Thank you.

1834
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,500
So did you come here
for a special reason?

1835
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:31,000
Well, actually,
I want a green card.

1836
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,900
Done.

1837
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,000
So, what do I get from it?

1838
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,700
Sex.

1839
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,800
So if I get you a green card,
you'll have sex with me?

1840
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,400
Just the two of us.

1841
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,100
(Both laughing)

1842
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,100
PAULY:
Here I was,

1843
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,100
having dinner and drinks

1844
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,500
with some hot blonde

1845
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,900
that was using me
for something.

1846
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,700
It was like
I was back in L.A.

1847
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,500
Finally, I felt at peace.

1848
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,300
But through
this whole experience,

1849
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,000
I did learn just one thing,

1850
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:05,200
but I can't think of it
right now because, damn,

1851
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,800
this bitch is hot.

1852
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,800
And you know I love
to be surrounded

1853
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,300
by the little babies!

1854
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,300
And as far as Faith
and my mom's diamond,

1855
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:20,300
I found out later she was
in cahoots with my driver, Val.

1856
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,100
Vijay, we got the diamond!

1857
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,600
PAULY:
They were like Africans' version

1858
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,500
of Thelma and Louise.

1859
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,700
Oh, well done!

1860
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,200
We're rich! We're rich!

1861
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,600
Thank you, Pauly!

1862
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,600
Well done. Well done.
Off we go.

1863
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,800
PAULY:
But what Val and Faith didn't
steal from me

1864
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,600
was the experience
that I gained in Africa.

1865
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,100
All those faces.

1866
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,000
Look at your face!

1867
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,100
All those places.

1868
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,100
Ah!

1869
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,500
Click, click, click, click,
click, click, click, click.

1870
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,500
And that goddamn meat
on the boards.

1871
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,500
(All chattering in foreign
dialect)

1872
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,000
I need my soda!

1873
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,100
So it was time for me to leave
Africa and head back to L.A.

1874
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,600
But halfway through the flight,
I realized,

1875
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,700
"Hey, wait, Africa isn't
the only place

1876
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,600
you can go adopt babies."

1877
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,200
(All chattering in foreign
dialect)

1878
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,600
So I wound up in Cambodia.

1879
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,800
I figured it was
the next best thing.

1880
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,800
(Girl sobbing)

1881
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,800
Oh, okay, okay.

1882
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,700
She doesn't want to go. Here.

1883
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,200
Okay. Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1884
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,100
I thought she wanted to go.
You said she wanted to go.

1885
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,300
(Sighing)

1886
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:52,600
There's no way Madonna
and Angelina had it this rough.

1887
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:24,800
¶

1888
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:38,400
¶ The dawn is a mystery
waiting for discovery ¶

1889
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,000
¶ Hold on to something ¶

1890
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,000
¶ It's bound to get bumpy ¶

1891
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,600
¶ I'm hoping, praying that
this hill will start sloping ¶

1892
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,600
¶ So that I can finally say ¶

1893
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,600
¶ That it's all downhill
from here ¶

1894
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,600
¶ And I'll sing la-di-da ¶

1895
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,500
¶ Uh-huh ¶

1896
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,400

01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,700

¶ Uh-huh ¶

01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
¶ La-di-da ¶

1901
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:31,800
¶ Awaiting confirmation
from space station ¶

1902
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,200
¶ Oh, here I come ¶

1903
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,400
¶ Setting course towards
the one and only place ¶

1904
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,900
¶ She can get to me,

1905
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:45,900
¶ And the world woke up
to work its life ¶

1906
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:49,700
¶ With a paper cup
and a butter knife ¶

1907
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:53,500

a tired wife ¶

1908
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:57,000
¶ Who ain't no fun,

1909
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
¶ That's okay, because I never
liked you anyway ¶

1910
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,400
¶ La-di-da ¶

1911
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,400

01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,300

¶ Uh-huh ¶

1926
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:17,100
You have the right
to remain silent!

1927
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:20,000
Anything that can be held,
will be held against you

1928
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
in the state of law.

1929
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,700
You have an option
to an attorney

1930
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:27,500
if you want one
appointed to you.

1931
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,800
Down on the ground!
(Laughing)

1932
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,200
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

1933
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,400
This is not
racial profiling.

1934
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,200
This is the real deal.

1935
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,200
Down on the ground, son!

1936
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,300
Who do you think you are?

1937
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,900
Huh?

1938
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,900
Down on the ground, son!

1939
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,900
So Val and I decided to take
some time out of our busy day

1940
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:52,100
to stop by and say hi
to Chris Rock's friend.

1941
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:58,900
Hi.

1942
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,600
What's up?
My name's Pauly Shore.

1943
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,300
Nice to meet you.
I'm friends with Chris Rock.

1944
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:04,700
Yes.
Chris Rock.

1945
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,100
Do you know Chris Rock,
the comedian?

1946
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:09,000
He said that I can come here
and say hi to Nelson Mandela.

1947
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,900
Okay.
Is he here?

1948
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,600
Who?
Nelson?

1949
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,300
Nelson is not here.
Where is he at?

1950
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:16,900
Where is he at?
Nelson Mandela Foundation.

1951
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,500
Oh, it's the foundation?
Yes.

1952
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,000
But he's not here.

1953
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,800
He's not here.

1954
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,300
His pictures are on the wall,
though.

1955
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,200
Yes.
I saw his pictures on the wall.

1956
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,500
That's cool.

1957
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,900
WOMAN:
Hello, can we stop the cameras?

1958
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:29,100
Can we stop the cameras, please?
Thank you.

1959
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,400
I was-- No, I was here
to give you money.

1960
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,500
No, no, no?

1961
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,700
(Laughing)
Ah!

1962
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:39,600
I need the lion.
I need it!

1963
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,800
I'm going
to snap your neck.

1964
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,300
That's it. It's over.

1965
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,300
(Imitating bones cracking)

1966
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,300
Ah, you're dead now!

1967
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,800
I killed you!
(Laughing)

1968
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,300
(Grunting)

1969
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,400
Son, listen.
Since you're a big fellow--

1970
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,400
Listen, since you're
a big fellow, right--

1971
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,800
You're a big fellow, right?

1972
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,800
If I get older and-- And not
able to control myself,

1973
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,100
will you be my security guard,
as well?

1974
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,100
Yes.

1975
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:01,400
(Grunting)

1976
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,000
Mr. Lion!

1977
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,300
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1978
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,300
Don't ever do that to me.

1979
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:10,600
Ah, I won't, son!

1980
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,200
Why are all
the American celebrities,

1981
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,500
Angelina Jolie, Madonna,

1982
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,600
they always take the baby,
and they say,

1983
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,300
"Oh, we're going to take them
out of Africa."

1984
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,600
I mean, that's terrible,
correct?

1985
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,900
That's correct.

1986
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,500
(Laughing)
That's correct.

1987
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,600
Exactly.

1988
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,600
How much is a baby?

1989
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,400
I think you can spend
less than 10,000.

1990
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,600
10,000 American?

1991
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:37,300
Yes, but American
can spend more than 20,000.

1992
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:39,300
So now it's all of a sudden
20,000.

1993
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,600
Do you have any babies
you want to sell?

1994
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,200
Yes.

1995
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,300
Let me go and take him.

1996
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,800
Okay, bring him over here,
and you're going to--

1997
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,100
You're going to let me
buy him?

1998
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,200
Okay.
Okay.

1999
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,100
I'll wait here
and watch your shoes.

2000
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,300
You guys,
we're like warriors.

2001
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,700
Say it like this.

2002
01:21:56,700 --> 01:22:00,500
¶ Warriors,
come out and play ¶

2003
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,900
¶ Warriors, come out and play ¶

2004
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,100
I'm going to take you to see
some pretty girls.

2005
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:09,000
Go on.

2006
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,700
You like pretty girls?

2007
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,600
Go on, yes.

2008
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,100
I'm going to have
your own room.

2009
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,700
You're going to have
your own room.

2010
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:15,900
Go on.

2011
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,300
I'm going to, you know,
take you shopping and stuff

2012
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:22,000
and buy you iPods and computers
and all those things.

2013
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,300
Go on.

2014
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,900
I'm going to introduce you
to the G-Unit.

2015
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,800
Go on.

2016
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,100
(Laughing)

2017
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,100
(Screaming)

2018
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,500
Because a lot of these
other people,

2019
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,100
they come and they just
take the kid,

2020
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,900
so I'm here to spend time.

2021
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:42,200
But the thing is, I don't want
to, like, just meet the child

2022
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,600
and take him back
to America.

2023
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,700
I want to spend time
with the child.

2024
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,400
Yeah, get to know
the child a bit.

2025
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,300
Yeah, exactly, because the kid
might not like me.

2026
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,500
Yes.
You know what I mean?

2027
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,300
He might get back to L.A.
and be, like,

2028
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,900
"This guy's an idiot.
Get me back to South Africa."

2029
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,000
Yes.

2030
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
You know what I mean?

2031
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,100
To spend for how long?

2032
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,400
Oh, here?
I'll spend for a while.

2033
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,100
Until I find someone that,
you know, is good.

2034
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,900
I mean, I might, you know, just,
you know, see what happens,

2035
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,200
and then I have to do
the paperwork and stuff.

2036
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,200
Okay.

2037
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,400
Hello, everybody.
I'm Steven Moolman.

2038
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,800
I played the role
of Allen.

2039
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,600
Well, we may joke about
a very serious matter

2040
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:19,000
called adoption of babies and,
particularly,

2041
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,800
people of Europe and America
adopting children in Africa.

2042
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:27,800
Well, in Africa, adoptions
is a real issue, and it's--

2043
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,000
(Laughing)

2044
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,300
Oh, sorry.

2045
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:32,300
(Both laughing)

2046
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,400
Yeah, but it is real, guys.

2047
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,400
(Both laughing)

2048
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,200
Oh, my God.

2049
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,700
Well, let me-- Listen, let me
start talking, then.

2050
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,700
Okay. Okay, take two.

2051
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,200
Hi, everybody,
this is Steven Moolman--

2052
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,500
Sorry, sorry.

2053
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:59,700
Hi, everybody.
I'm Steven Moolman

2054
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:00,800
here in-- I don't want to say
where I am.

2055
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,400
Should I actually say
where I'm in charge?

2056
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,400
Yeah. Say where you are.

2057
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,300
Sorry.
Wait, come on.

2058
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,900
Wait, let me just get
my composure.

2059
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:13,800
How do we find a better way to
kind of, you know, help this--?

2060
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,800
Communicate the need
that there is.

2061
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,100
Okay. Sorry.

2062
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:19,100
(Both laughing)

2063
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,600
What's your problem?
I can't help it.

2064
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,800
You started it.
Yeah, right.

2065
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,500
Basically, the message is
wear condoms, right?

2066
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,300
I mean,
that's not the message?

2067
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,300
No, no, no.

2068
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,300
(Both laughing)

2069
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:39,700
What's the message?

2070
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,500
So for me--
We need some more resources

2071
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,900
to do it well.
Yeah, so for me,

2072
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,500
it was an enlightening
experience.

2073
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,100
I had a great time coming here
to Africa, you know.

2074
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,400
It was good working with you,
yeah.

2075
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,300
I had a great time,
and the people are beautiful.

2076
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:53,000
You know, the people here are
honestly beautiful people.

2077
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,200
And I definitely
will be back.

2078
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,600
And I had an amazing time
with all these guys

2079
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,900
that shot the documentary.
Thank you guys so much.

2080
01:24:58,900 --> 01:24:59,900
It was nice
working with you guys.

2081
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,100
Thank you very much.
You guys are awesome.

2082
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,400
Thanks, everyone here
in the crew and everyone.

2083
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,600
I can only hope that,
through our experience,

2084
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,400
you know, we've developed
a relationship

2085
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,000
where we can actually hear
from one another again.

2086
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Thank you so much
for having us.

2087
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Thank you.
Bye.

2088
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
God bless. Bye-bye.

2088
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:42,000
