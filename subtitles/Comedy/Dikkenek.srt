1
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,053
What's wrong now?
The great love?

2
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,979
Could you not start small?
No, the big right!

3
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,610
Stef, before 't end of the week
I find you a chick.

4
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,254
And you just have to pop.
That goes without saying.

5
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,419
I know your combines out.
No, thanks.

6
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,736
Well, the last time was t ...

7
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,976
I admit, that man was really
insane ...

8
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,136
a clinically hopeless case.

9
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,854
But one thing I tell you, Stef ...

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,369
We may perhaps lat
not impose high.

11
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,219
However, a moist within trien do
is not so simple.

12
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,093
That kind of wives is
terribly suspicious.

13
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,976
We address the middle class to.

14
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,490
Before 't end of the week
you meet the true Jakoba!

15
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,659
Dikkenek--large mug, bladder jaw,
stoefer,

16
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,215
sir -- or madame--wiseacre.

17
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,494
Monique with me. Do me a favor.

18
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,214
Say this arrangement with 2 Kiekens
the TV school.

19
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,253
Equipment I have spoken
not the time.

20
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,291
Such rete heads me
the pot on.

21
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,932
Which school?
-- 'T IAD.

22
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,132
't IAD? Never jamais of my life
not heard.

23
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,538
Is it that famous year--end work?

24
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,015
How long will that last? 7, 8 minutes?

25
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,615
Go ahead. I am ready.

26
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,135
You do not say 'action'? Ho, say!

27
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,893
I suggest for me -- I am
Claudy Focan ...

28
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,092
semi--professional photographer ... No, explain
everything quiet. Cut!

29
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,292
I say this because I have lens
had to see.

30
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,775
This is digital, right? 35 mm.

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,098
I am a photographer of ...
I ... charming pictures.

32
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,577
But it does not matter.
Shall we go?

33
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,659
I am equally for Focan Claudy.
Mr. Focan, precise.

34
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,772
Director sales and marketing manager
's slaughterhouse of Anderlecht.

35
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,732
This is the sales hall.

36
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,931
The animals are 150
in a lorry.

37
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,052
Why 150? If they do not stumble
during 't transport.

38
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,899
On arrival follow the white line.

39
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,456
And we lead them irrevocably two
every two to slaughter.

40
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,696
Perhaps less amusing, however.

41
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,368
And we never 2 times
After shooting each other.

42
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,571
This is about my peccadillo.

43
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,732
Once it beast the pipe is off, are you,
not, of course ...

44
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,818
Say 's, you is becoming my balls from
your micro.

45
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,059
I just got him close to my face!
't Is now' s from!

46
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,172
Sorry, I'm nervous here.
You can 't help.

47
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,658
But it seems to me that she 's lower
from the can 't have sent IAD.

48
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,498
And the frikadel, how do you do?

49
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,612
Since I just come.
Everything in its time.

50
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,697
Say you do not what to say.

51
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,972
And what about the frikadel?
Two things you should know.

52
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,252
On a beast of 700 kg
is 350 kg case

53
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,499
as a matter or scrap
not suitable for consumption.

54
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,055
In a butcher shop, you will never nostrils ...

55
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,172
a scrotum, anus or intestines n
find.

56
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,098
What happens to the intestines?

57
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,734
The bowels are never more
digested than grass.

58
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,454
Also commonly called 'shit' said.

59
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,733
What is it? We dump the whole
sprain in large vats ie 'pools'.

60
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,728
Since then products by: anxiolytica,
antibiotics, dyes ...

61
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,932
our precarious existence, called
'Belgian' form.

62
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,131
Once they have returned to meat appears

63
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,535
we stop in intestines ...

64
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,018
and leaves than the fritkoten,
The commerce, by the way ...

65
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,415
as frikadellen, merguez.

66
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,338
All kits, Polak?

67
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,054
A large pack of chips with sauce, please.

68
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,057
What sauce?

69
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,573
No idea. Dallas -- sauce, but do
the sauce separately.

70
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,338
And three balls.

71
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,576
Omar! The sauce separately or on the fries?

72
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,453
On the balls! And also 's
6, 7 frikadellen!

73
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,732
Seven frikadellen with ...
-- 10 beers, please! 10 stars.

74
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,374
Gener you not!
Are you sometimes blind?

75
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,459
I was just 't order.
You're playing with your life!

76
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,333
Sorry, I had not seen you.
I thought ...

77
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,452
What does that whore young? Come on!

78
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,377
Calm down now.
-- N Problem, Aziz?

79
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,855
That cross me over and excuse themselves
disagree?

80
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,654
Are you polite or not?

81
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,575
Do not.
-- Loser!

82
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,296
Are you not bosklas?

83
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,338
I knew you 't was. With your old
focus of rapzanger. Hiphop!

84
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,576
And that spuwt everywhere ... as a lama.

85
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,090
That works great on my system.
Hey, Stef.

86
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,135
You know each other?
-- He's my size.

87
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,730
And you save a different tone to it on.
Sorry, now!

88
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,896
Excuse ...
-- 'N beer?

89
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,375
No, I drink beer.
-- What is that?

90
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,377
Frikadellen. Sometimes hungry?

91
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,174
You know what is in it?
I have read about it.

92
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,133
Anyway no pork.
-- That certainly is not.

93
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,854
But give that a dog
and he eats there is not.

94
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,334
There is a stain.

95
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,092
Can I ask you something?
Summarize it the wrong way.

96
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,894
What do you actually do
as it starts school?

97
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,773
Because Baudouin and I put our demand.

98
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,536
If you see your results ...

99
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,937
The unief, all best, but you must
still a little studying.

100
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,576
You can not continue every year
tubes.

101
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,774
On the slow start, good long
sleep ...

102
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,335
there you all
no difficulty.

103
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,818
I unief not finished.

104
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,773
If I cap today is that
my fault.

105
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,175
I had not asked 17. Nothing!

106
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,656
I wish law school, no snot monkeys
with that other asshole!

107
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,211
I wanted in a great psychologist
become.

108
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,289
Help people ... service, MSF,
the bunch.

109
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,253
And all this because I 'n night
teut was.

110
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,772
And when your parents died,
My life changed.

111
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,212
Just on the day of the funeral I had
mother. Just. Hello, croquette.

112
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,615
Listen, baby, do not drum
wrong way,

113
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,380
but I always like my own
daughter.

114
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,210
I do not want it bad you pass.
-- Listen, tantetje ...

115
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,735
I also thought.

116
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,295
I see you as my mother,
I see you happy.

117
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,775
And the more I think about it,
the more I think ...

118
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,734
meaning that I have to just do
like you.

119
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,615
Why? What do you say?
-- Free blow perform.

120
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,729
Like you. Finally, that is
's goal in life, huh?

121
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,295
Succeed not blow to carry out.

122
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,490
Forward! Here. Follow me!

123
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,692
Cindy? It 's always the same.

124
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,814
Say 's, gourmand, you can not read?

125
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,136
Forbidden to eat in museums!

126
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,138
Hopefully this visit beneemt
no appetite! Yah!

127
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,093
Hello. The small envelope.

128
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,576
Please. Welcome to 's Museum
of fatalities.

129
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,248
In short, we can not
repeat belt!

130
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,850
Rather a small 'click' with your clicks
and rattle out of the car fly!

131
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,415
Well, children?

132
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,815
Who wants to play dead?

133
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,413
Who has been a car accident?

134
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,499
You?

135
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,338
You?

136
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,054
You? Nobody?

137
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,536
That comes later.

138
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,776
At 18 you start to drink ...

139
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,733
and do you want your friends
impress ...

140
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,899
and guaranteed against a tree
if you come back from Louvain--la--Neuve.

141
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,332
Charlotte, do you know what a windshield is?

142
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,249
Well, if you today more Albator
seems to CANDIE ...

143
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,775
is that your mama pimpelt!

144
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,652
Nice fence, huh?

145
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,533
The guy in question had 137 fractures.

146
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,812
137 fractures, it's much, huh?
Not to say, impressive!

147
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,658
Come, come look!

148
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,737
Come closer, it does not bite!

149
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,569
You want to sit on the engine, huh?
I feel it!

150
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,978
You do not want to? Not bad. Go ahead!
Next attraction!

151
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,099
The teacher is dead!

152
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,170
Now we go a minute silence to

153
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,814
for all those people behind me.

154
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,378
That 's it!

155
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,853
That zetst there but loose.
Is this is a porno theater?

156
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,177
What? Come anyway.

157
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,371
What is this reject?

158
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,414
About two girls looking for sex
identity.

159
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,499
Sexual identity? What does that mean?
That you have me 's out!

160
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,013
't Is it terribly slow. Whenever I
movie ga, I fall asleep.

161
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,257
Ferme loezen, a round belly,
thick buttocks ...

162
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,418
Is' s something different than leaves, huh?

163
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,690
My hand off it 's back
rete fuss is about!

164
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,936
The sexual identity!

165
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,217
What is it? Have we met?

166
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,649
Fabienne?

167
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,772
How I know you 't you?
Your name was on it screen.

168
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,857
Excuse me!
-- Are you stupid.

169
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,257
Want to go outside but a phone call?
-- Shut up! I'm busy.

170
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,258
No, that was not against you,
but who voze deb here.

171
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,611
Ga outside call or otherwise turn off your mobile.
-- What? Huh?

172
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,256
Are you sometimes deaf? For the last time,
ga outside call you bitched!

173
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,289
You want to fight, huh?
Put it on, bitch.

174
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,936
I wait! Come on!
-- This guy is stekezot!

175
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,093
You stay upright in the cinema?
Sit!

176
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,256
And look just right before you!

177
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,657
That view, madam?

178
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,170
And as he spoke to me!
Call me sometimes in the bios?

179
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,932
Yes, Fabienne? No, it's nothing.
Any shoot here ...

180
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,693
This guy does it express!

181
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,609
No, I don 't do to you!
You never know what, stupid bitch!

182
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,613
No!
-- The 1st is because you are a dickhead!

183
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,018
The 2nd is for 's principle ... and 3rd,
because you never 2 without 3 you!

184
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,216
Who is this?
-- JC.

185
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,172
Say 's. .. JC, right?

186
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,689
What are you doing on August 15?

187
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,414
I have four then my 18th
birthday ...

188
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,576
with a party in 't Zoute.

189
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,294
's tendency, I need the whole of Belgium.

190
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,619
What a tuttebel! Is it sometimes
too close to the wall gewiegd?

191
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,734
Here. Compliments of the baby manager.

192
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,171
Nog 'n afsluitertje?
Jakkes that must hurt!

193
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,897
What I think this dancing so cool,
that palace--like way.

194
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,330
Pretty Woman. This little ...

195
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,654
'S wrong foot stepped on in bed?

196
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,656
All right, Dominique?

197
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,773
Oh, yes, those times when you Albanians
had left within ...

198
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,529
Should you watch. Can you not do that.
it should remain ... you know?

199
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,573
I have nothing to say because
people, but ...

200
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,490
Not wrong, huh?
The dance floor there already seen?

201
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,089
All right, Dom? Sometimes you sleep here?

202
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,935
Since you have the hottest of them all!
-- Daisy! I had not seen you ...

203
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,210
Further news?

204
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,455
a beer, please. I stitching of thirst.

205
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,938
And?
-- Well ... 't is not obvious.

206
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,368
't Is not ... currently ... I
the wind.

207
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,492
And it stinks like the plague
I get to smell.

208
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,693
I swear, it's really ... I get
well on my face.

209
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,653
The universal law of series,
as they say.

210
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,896
Huge problems with rabies,
dioxin ...

211
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,136
Always the same things again come
but ...

212
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,049
About old sows speaking, how is it?
-- What is always in common with me!

213
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,332
's more' n witticism than anything else.
-- Vlot 's that girl there?

214
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,695
You yourself should not be fooled, Daisy.

215
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,291
If I so often as well
I pet ...

216
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,017
is that for my money,
and not how I Riek.

217
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,058
And that compares.

218
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,013
I am perhaps the only one in Belgium
to know, but ...

219
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,176
's Natacha, right?

220
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,209
Wow, do you hear that? Michael Jackson!
They think I keigoed!

221
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,854
The only white person who makes music
as Zwartjes.

222
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,778
Note that this is not so difficult ...

223
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,016
That's him! I am keigek on!

224
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,691
In two words: above him there
nobody, under him there is none!

225
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,369
Carmelo, add 's as loud, I'm
the only one here who dances. The nave is!

226
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,296
Is it to my gear that you look?

227
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,051
Too crazy. A semi--automatic Czech
gun, light plastic, 17 shots.

228
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,569
Stops a moving school bus.
Maybe even a plane!

229
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,816
Never tried, but I consider 't.

230
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,614
Firearms are my passion
of when I was little!

231
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,129
Is no explanation for. As some
dolls like ...

232
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,853
Can we go now?
-- Say it again ...

233
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,016
I was assaulted in the cinema
by 2 guys.

234
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,017
They strike me down ... almost now she
had no knife ...

235
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,532
but she tamped me, questioned my jacket
and stole my brand new mobile phone!

236
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,972
Fortunately I have judo, so I could
the situation more or less be the boss ...

237
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,412
And how did you guys look like?
Something like this here?

238
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,697
Of course not.

239
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,938
They saw it mount? Suddenly.
-- Non.

240
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,015
Dan 's this? 't were the same.
More or less ...

241
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,448
Come 'n inspanninkje, otherwise I
you do not help.

242
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,449
It was this guy there.
Yet something in that nature ...

243
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,811
What, he? He would
done?

244
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,456
Why?

245
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,935
For fun?

246
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,614
They are heavily in her box will
believe me.

247
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,458
What? This here?

248
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,254
Make no mistake! I have a horse dose
in done.

249
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,289
I've searched everywhere. I thought
you are away.

250
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,776
Here ...

251
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,134
I sat at my convenience at the cinema,
with a young girl ...

252
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,649
And then my mobile phone so
have.

253
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,216
Ho but before the movie you say
your phone off.

254
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,934
And 's after the advertising.
They are not every 5 minutes ..

255
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,938
the lights to call you to say
you should sell your mobile phone?

256
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,017
I had him off!
-- True or not?

257
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,336
Yes or no? Am I right?
-- Yes!

258
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,529
I did that when I with my wife
movie ga.

259
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,538
First, bad seats ...
than all the mobile phones which are transferred,

260
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,369
all those people who are a tetteren ...
Because the film starts with 't concert.

261
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,014
I ga still my buddy Maurice
in Sabam 's call.

262
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,290
It was not a singer! You listening?

263
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,378
I don 't al We say
out like that.

264
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,457
We are a robot are portrait.

265
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,379
However, I'm not bad,
but I do not sign as Tintin.

266
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,536
Tintin 's character.

267
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,133
Just what I say. I sign
as Tintin.

268
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,529
How did he look like?
-- He was ... small ...

269
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,254
't Face! The shape of the face ...
Angular ...

270
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,770
Long, greasy hair ... in the neck.
'n Klein mustache ...

271
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,175
And a nose ... a thick nose ...

272
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,816
Yes, 'n kokkerd! And he smelled the booze!
The whole room was their ruin.

273
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,734
Where do I find a Mercedes coupe?

274
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,295
Yes, I know that it streamlined
Arika to go.

275
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,094
Damn exciting, your orders
's last minute!

276
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,495
Stef, I'm 't call!

277
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,579
Is my BMW ready? What? I am otherwise
always good enough for you to repair.

278
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,057
Damn, check that 's!

279
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,653
Klotebak, goddamn it!

280
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,292
JC, look!
-- Damn! What a pack of notes!

281
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,536
What does this asshole now?

282
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,895
With me. Greg!
Damn, I got a big problem!

283
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,888
You are not dead, it's' s most important.
-- They have stolen my mobile!

284
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,695
I do not know. And you calling?
Should you cancel?

285
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,939
That does not! It's something I found
have e--thingies. Not to pay.

286
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,813
Please, Fabienne, come fetch me!

287
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,374
Draw your plan on. For a time
the bus.

288
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,970
This is a public cell!
Do not have a mobile phone?

289
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,977
Two seconds ...
-- Wanker!

290
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,455
Thirty seconds is that?

291
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,089
No, but a ball grab.
Well, you 't understand?

292
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,575
You should definitely come and get me!
-- Where are you?

293
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,169
You are here 't Poulaerplein,
not on the Croisette!

294
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,770
I leave you, because that guy starts
slightly red to save it.

295
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,450
I ga that 's on his Japanese
stairs at his face.

296
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,616
Wait. I leave you.

297
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,529
Chef! Whether you come out or I
get out! Decide now 's!

298
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,449
Come on, Come on!
-- D'you get out or I d'out!

299
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,216
Chef! You're crazy, chef!

300
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,095
And now out!

301
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,575
I still get 'shit to you,
dickhead!

302
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,936
Your glasses klootvis! Maybe see you then
next time better!

303
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,137
Mama, in Claudy.

304
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,376
I let carjacking.

305
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,368
I let carjacking, tell me.
They have the car stolen!

306
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,132
No, I could do nothing, I have
after they tried to run,

307
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,376
but what do you want to start with ... No.

308
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,619
With my learning is employed,
with 70,000 balls in ...

309
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,733
No, I am really sick! No ...

310
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,852
Your glasses? What did you popular, mama?
In the glove compartment!

311
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,813
's glove in the car
remained. No ...

312
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,729
Say, you can not come to where I
as a child snookerde with Dad?

313
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,851
Go to the cafe where it big 'Duvel'
state.

314
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,051
Right now, and shoot because ...

315
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,491
I want to go from this city! I am here
mad! All this violence!

316
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,932
Keitof, your desk!

317
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,336
Dear Help!

318
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,933
Goodbye, madam.

319
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,216
What a heat, huh?

320
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,613
I'm wet.

321
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,250
I'm also a little with my head
in my hole, but ... 't going to go.

322
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,337
Yes, I am up late.

323
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,054
'n Man must now and then as steam
indulgences.

324
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,889
The bow can not always tense stand.

325
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,334
Say 's, Stef ... I got a small question.

326
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,656
't on my niece Natacha.

327
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,010
Currently it is not.

328
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,450
a small post--adolescence crisis.

329
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,530
You know about whom I 't have?
But yes!

330
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,413
a small peach that is always in her blootje
looking for her slip.

331
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,410
Surely not.

332
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,297
Do you not drink?

333
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,333
We may meet perhaps tutoyeren?
Would you like something to drink?

334
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,529
Yes, I would like.

335
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,968
Alcohol? Soft?

336
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,899
I would a beer lust.
'n Vedette, please.

337
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,091
Soft is not your thing, huh?

338
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,415
Not really ...

339
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,417
What is that?

340
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,413
No, Aziz. Watch it! Scratches everywhere!

341
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,931
Imagine my place! Who I ga
that sell? On a different brown?

342
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,736
Okay, 50 for two.

343
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,489
To take it or leave it.
-- Do you have jackets? In Kroko?

344
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,373
Kroko has dismissed.
Slang is very weather.

345
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,935
But rather than learning.
Want a learning style?

346
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,812
Then aside. Hey, Marco?

347
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,814
When you're done, get that jacket
back 's.

348
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,331
Pak 't look in the back!

349
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,176
Hurry up in mind.

350
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,417

351
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,418
't Is nothing, huh?
-- Pretty on the red side.

352
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,771
I ga 't cut, I think.
But the other looks like long hair.

353
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,619
I leave you. Draw your plan but
your cowhide.

354
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,130
See that guy. 'n Mooi learning style.
Pull 's.

355
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,368
This is fashion, you say? Do you remember?
-- You are not here at H & M, Aziz.

356
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,775
Do you sometimes' n pashokje?

Hang me for the monkey?

358
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,093
What did you say?
-- No, that came naturally ...

359
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,814
It seems to me however ...
-- Excuse me.

360
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,250
No, it's not too big! Look!
-- Do you?

361
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,691
It 's your good! This is now in fashion.

362
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,050
Damn, man, your jacket stinks!

363
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,452
That 's teachings.
-- On 's head of my mother! Back to the pig!

364
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,537
Was it then, what do you want me to say!

365
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,255
Okay! The 2 handsets' s jacket.

366

00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,534
It should cost 400, but I
let him you 350.

369
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,496
't Is' n Eddy Merckx,
So no brol!

370
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,577

-- Yes, 'n real.

371
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,972
Hey, viking! I'll pay you tomorrow!
See you, JC.

372
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,059
Say 's, you know that your a chick
with cocker--eye in your trunk are you?

373
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,449
Can you immediately pay for the car?
-- Okay. You grab your spare it.

374
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,656
Day. I'm JC.

375
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,698
Is it?

376
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,258
When you drive in a Child?

377
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,738
Two beers!

378
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,896
Not everything at once, fatboy!

379
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,570
Do you smikkel him see.

380
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,657
Just such a moist nature as his father.

381
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,693
We got him like places,
but it does not succeed. That beer!

382
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,457
It's like 3 Suisses,
they bring him back always!

383
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,973
Sorry, I had not seen you.

384
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,814
Do me just a beer.

385
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,338
I stitching of thirst.

386
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,496
And cool, as it can!

387
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,058
Yeah, same!

388
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,377
And also bring a different glass with us!

389
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,536
This here tastes like soap.

390
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,130
I like a little foam, but
you should not exaggerate!

391
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,894
Hold it people stupid balls?

392
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,417
Do more 's vol.

393
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,809
Same, so?
-- Do more 's full, I have your answer.

394
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,689
Please 't be good at? Excuse me.

395
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,248
I go 's.
-- No! Sit tight.

396
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,175
Still a lucky I my mouth
not open it.

397
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,008
Is it the laugh--scream--roar break?

398
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,017
You have the ice cubes! In the fridge
there is no more. What happened here?

399
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,051
I got it from my wife!
Ga you play with your mower, you idiot!

400
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,137
Give me the ice 's!

401
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,173
Would you calm down? What has
the guy you wrong?

402
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,699
You talkin 'to me?

403
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,733
Well? If you need money
for your messages, then it 's good!

404
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,737
Come on, go play!
-- I'm gone!

405
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,209
Did they teach you never to eat
with your mouth?

406
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,092
I got it to you!

407
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,575
I like next to a garbage truck
into force sta!

408
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,288
Bitched.

409
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,210
It's great exciting someone chips
to hear the food for those who do not eat!

410
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,456
Understood? 'n Minimum education!

411
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,171
In the slaughterhouse would it not be true!

412
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,217
Small cock ...

413
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,497
With his big game thing.

414
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,375
a small dick ... as Baudouin.

415
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,895
I brought this.
There are many more.

416
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,213
Thank you. Very nice of you.
I just came from. Come on.

417
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,570
Coming, my little Dim.

418
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,937
Fuck!

419
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,289
Filthy sow!

420
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,377
Hey, Mama! Mama!

421
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,095
Goddamn it, always the same song!

422
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,296
Embrace you mother?

423
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,896
I can not, Mama ... crazy
what is me.

424
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,694
A second but has it lasted,
I tell you!

425
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,619
I only now realize what happened.

426
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,209
Nothing I can do!
I really ...

427
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,809
... I am down from
or how do you say that?

428
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,329
I can not, I am
at the end of my Latin.

429
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,657
I want to go home, pick up my shuffle
and out!

430
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,012
Look at me not to, otherwise I can
this does not explain.

431
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,929
What 's history. Alcoholism is really
the scourge of the century.

432
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,655
But worst is that he never
is drunk. Never!

433
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,896
While I have 2 glasses after all
ga embrace.

434
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,934
Today 's somewhat hommeles
with Baudouin.

435
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,495
I see 't.
-- What? Because ... that?

436
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,895
No, this is your wife.

437
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,737
Excuse me.

438
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,615
I have heard that they ...

439
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,538
not really your wife is.

440
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,458
She comes back.

441
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,537
When they need money.

442
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,892
If it can help, Baudouin also
gescharreld. With a Asian,

443
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,058
and then ... But that is now history.

444
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,570
If they come back, will you be r
need testing ...

445
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,691
We draw it to rubbertjes.

446
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,458
I don 't understand. She has everything.

447
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,174
We go 3 times per year on holiday,
we go to the movies ...

448
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,850
Note that this is just for people
to see, because ...

449
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,576
I got a Home Cinema.

450
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,418
More than 300 DVDs.

451
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,975
Soon 800, thanks to the Internet.

452
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,415
I like the movie.
You should go to the movies.

453
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,611
We go to the movie.

454
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,174
Say 's, I would not interfere with ...

455
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,534
Take it a bit with the drink.

456
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,776
Lifting As you say!

457
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,053
Six months ago I saw a advertisement.

458
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,774
It said: "Urgent.

459
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,053
Professional Photographer looking young girl. "

460
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,251
So I go to him and I asked him
or it was naked.

461
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,817
He: 'No,' t is no nudity,
but art '. I know a lot.

462
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,297
And he looked nice from.

463
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,092
I had to do with him going home.

464
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,131
Pull it, do you want?

465
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,729
Claudy! Come quickly, I got you
everywhere!

466
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,374
No, I'm shooting now.
With my model.

467
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,890
With whom? Natacha?
Again that little whore!

468
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,933
Judge her not. You know 't
and you assess her al

469
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,096
Balls or chips as dinner?

470
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,690
Or croques. I'm doing, Mommy.
's Whatever.

471
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,973
Is that not somewhat vulgar?
-- Vulgar?

472
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,535
You will find that vulgar?
-- Yes.

473
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,857
's already. I understand now.

474
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:48,292
Hear 's, Natacha, on the side aristieke
ga me, so difficult you do not.

475
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,456
Why I ask you those shoes
to contribute?

476
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,333
I work here in zلrt--white,
so I must emphasize the colors ...

477
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,735
whether it is pale. You know not,

478
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,215
because you know nothing, because 't
your work is not.

479
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,538
Trek also that piece off.

480
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,693
Why, no?

481
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,334
But what are you doing here?

482
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,373
Your charm for photos
and you want to spend anything?

483
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,094
I do not have mandatory
here are, to my knowledge.

484
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,531
You are here by choice.
And then you come here to serve.

485
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,254
If it is so, will it here
rap made.

486
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,974
You should not with my balls
play!

487
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,696
You're tight like a cramp.
-- Not true.

488
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,812
Yes it is. If I tell you that you tense
you is so.

489
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,012
Say you not so. I tell you
you're tense.

490
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,451
So you say: 'Yes, Claudy,
I am not at my ease. "

491
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,537
You must be forwarded to me,

492
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,492
and I'll do you really get.

493
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,690
Why you only photograph naked
teenagers?

494
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,617
What? What say you now?
Say that 's!

495
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,811
Are you in your blootje?
Are you naked?

496
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,569
It's really what you do. You let
me off as a dirty smoke.

497
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,772
Come now do not bully me.
They do enough on 't work.

498
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,777
This is for my pleasure, you know?

499
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,494
I do not do
the costs themselves.

500
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,453
I'll be more than around. Money is
for me no problem.

501
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,378
For you, maybe. Yeah, huh?

502
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,536
You are here for the monetarist.

503
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,856
Then maybe you stressed
are.

504
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,934
Frustrated cunt.

505
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,698
And bend now.

506
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,097
So much is not, right?

507
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,734
Yet from it. See you.

508
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,932
Is that so much to ask?
Pull your panties off.

509
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,611
Pull your panties off.

510
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,057
Do I doing?

511
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,290
See?

512
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,536
Still ... yet.

513
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,331
No, that's too much. Keep up.

514
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,297
Don not.

515
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,968
Is it?

516
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,411
And do you love on me.

517
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,056
Still ... still a bit ...

518
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,296
a tiny bit. This is t.

519
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,096
Now I take the picture.

520
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,853
Don not, get the pony.

521
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,415
You are not easily scared.
What a story!

522
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,373
He is just rutted
to my sense.

523
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,572
And it's not my fault
as dick throttle was on me.

524
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,214
We are here.

525
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,252
If something goes wrong ...

526
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,535
you can always call me.

527
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,976
Thanks for everything.

528
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,819
Goodbye.

529
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,339
Who knows quite how they 'thank you'
must say!

530
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,774
And even do some apple drink.

531
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,652
That?
-- That there.

532
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,816
These triangles.
-- The samosa's.

533
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,133
Excuse me. 't Schoot me suddenly
to make, but ...

534
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,296
... you may not sell ...

535
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,456
What is that again?

536
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,097
... stuff?

537
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,297
Five hundred.

538
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,697
Thank you.

539
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,212
Everything good?
-- Yes, and you?

540
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,092
That take, I wanted to ask you something.

541
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,975
a friend of mine is a time
stay.

542
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,729
Because she has' n. .. heart problem.

543
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,649
I wanted to warn you that it
may be somewhat noisy.

544
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,613
Because it's a romp?
Something like a tigress?

545
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,573
Whip, leather, latex, sex moped?

546
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,816
However, my only King Kong I
not you, girls!

547
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,375
Do not worry. No, it was previously ..

548
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,174
water bottle always at hand ...

549
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,850
schoolteacher ...

550
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,650
Nothing more. And how is it
with Evelyne?

551
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,609
That pruilt. She is a mug
in her boudoir.

552
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,015
Because I drink to the stink
as I do my work.

553
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,938
And also to the cigarette.

554
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,893
Then memt them: 'It's just
I 'n uitlik ashtray.

555
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,375
35 years and I have 't geniept
smoking!

556
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,536
And with her cocaine,
is it better?

557
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,015
I am cop, and
she gets it from.

558
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,299
It's the world upside down. Find me
a broad, and he picked her!

559
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,094
Hey, két! Your pal here, I think.

560
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,655
You are here?
-- Yes, I am here.

561
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,811
Sorry, had a small setback.

562
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,690
I see 't.

563
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,808
Say hello, Sabine.
-- Hello, Sabine.

564
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,970
Ga in the cafeteria waiting for me.
Come on, my little cat.

565
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,571
Games we still match?
Where is the ball?

566
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,896
The ball is waiting for you ... like me.

567
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,409
And now you wait for me, because I
am Brazil 't beat.

568
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,057
Am I not?

569
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,013
Did you 're not cold?
I got it computes cold.

570
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,770
You are so quick here. With the car come?
-- Yes. Such a dumb box.

571
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,777
Only for him to open, there are
4 alarms on the key.

572
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,414
And they talk at a stretch!
'Take that off! That means no! '

573
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,417
But the reverse can be found!

574
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,372
He has lent you his car!

575
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,092
I 'm not requested.

576
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,609
Also, you should have seen how he
rampage went.

577
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,971
"Nadine, I love you!
I never go out! Promise!

578
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,977
I never drink more! I swear it! '

579
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,659
Words, words ...

580
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,218
Foeteren he sure.

581
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,536
What do you have in your bag?

582
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,218
You like attention: Room 1
your two favorite German bitches ...

583
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,978
Greta and Cynthia ...

584
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,411
accompanied by their shepherd ... also
German!

585
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,977
Hall 2. Young girls in black
long tisjen!

586
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,176
Is it here sometimes rush hour?

587
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,897
Goddamn, look over the cabin anyway!
No way!

588
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,692
Hey, you!
-- Me?

589
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,209
You shall not blow off. Come here
with your swab.

590
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,012
I will you "s to work.

591
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,372
This cabin has been 's view?
Do you clean that?

592
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,298
No, I ask you, do you clean that?

593
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,253
I would like to ease my seat.
I do not want a leg break.

594
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,532
't Is there a real slide. Hurry up!
I have something else to do.

595
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,018
The cards ... The cards!

596
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,619
Yes, take me.

597
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,617
That is 300.

598
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,373
Thus you have a lubricant is needed.

599
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,416
Is that you, sir?

600
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,733
I hot or not Arthur, but you
can 't thank.

601
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,135
Here, I treat you to a turn.

602
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,612
't surprise me that my 50 euros
I do not come around.

603
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,856
And now we hope that it still paste.

604
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,857
Hello, saam!

605
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,694
Swap, please.

606
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,496
Coins in the parking meters.

607
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,131
Was that blonde in her microwave not working properly?

608
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,137
Yes it is.

609
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,054
It had a touch of romance
to have.

610
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,172
There rest you have little time
to the woman of my life.

611
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,735
Want your empty promises ...

612
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,012
all blanks!
-- Ho but here 's your bag to go.

613
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,778
Not to take away.

614
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,211
And hear, I had you there
in the holes.

615
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,173
It was a test. Now I ga
's ideal female targeting.

616
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,291
And now that peepshow 's forever.

617
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,777
In the food like you do not
with hygiene.

618
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,370
I mean that the fines
are draconian.

619
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:30,495
So a worker who does not complete
equipment works, you can not.

620
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,488
a small example will say more
than words.

621
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,579
Yesterday I versnijzaal the inside
always unexpected, 2 times per day ...

622
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,736
And one Giovanni had his hat on.

623
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,454
Then it to me right outside!
You understand that ...

624
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,335
Come not from 'I was just
get my keys. " Not with me!

625
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,417
There is never on the fucking TV!

626
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,495
Baudouin, you will not believe me!
The bastard has already replaced her!

627
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,260
Who you talkin ', chou?
-- About Dimitri!

628
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,611
He has already replaced his wife!
And the other seems to me a real del!

629
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,095
He is not his whole life
continue, bitch!

630
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,416
Thus, it 's good his balls
Empty!

631
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,010
I think you are not very distinguished,
Baudouin.

632
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,292
Just the best hooker
within it!

633
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,092
Wait!

634
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,096
Ho but he spuwt on her!

635
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,859
What a force!

636
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,699
But that zothuis ... he pulls on her hair!

637
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,460
Well done!
-- I never even talk to that guy!

638
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,652
Also, I haven 't always smelled.
It's the drink. The drink!

639
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,613
The drink, Baudouin.
-- Yes, the drink. That you know not.

640
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,937
No, but ... she is on the ground.

641
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,290
Not possible, she is unconscious.

642
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,458
Damn, almost goal!

643
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,209
I am sure he has toegetakeld r
to revenge on Nadine!

644
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,372
Is anyone here?
-- Yes it is, there is someone!

645
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,093
Mich! Who has taken your seat.

646
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,619
There are not enough chairs,
you just picked mine?

647
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,971
Forward, ga 'n other address.
Since we have. Here is one.

648
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,252
You give me back, okay?
You should avoid ...

649
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,258
You should fucking racists
of your stroke to avoid!

650
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,453
Say that 's?
-- You can all your hard seat.

651
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,128
I do not mean good.
What did you say, bitched?

652
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,776
Was not headbutt with New
enough? You can get a!

653
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,373
And a Duvel, please.

654
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,736
Say 's, lolbroek?

655
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,771
Would you like some beer?

656
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,699
Barks that imbecile of a man of your
always like a Teckel?

657
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,778
You already get this in your face!

658
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,890
This refreshing, huh? On my costs. Cheers!

659
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,776
'n Lekker number. What is it?
-- That is Ghinzu.

660
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,574
It's English.
-- Hear me. Set louder, please.

661
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,896
Same?
-- Yes, the same!

662
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:55,449
In any case, there buddy what are you!
He pinches him in his shit hole!

663
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,498
I recommended not all.
But when I see who do not

664
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,419
I wonder if I really
so very much.

665
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,614
What now? Is she back face
't draw?

666
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,458
It's always something.

667
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,254
Once I make my photos, smoelt them.
So that.

668
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,613
It's not jealousy, but
it seems.

669
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,369
If they think I am all the time
will be. See that ...

670
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,612
Claudy! This thing does not work!

671
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,015
That they fall 20 kg and walking
to exceed!

672
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,814
Claudy! Did you hear me?

673
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,976
I come from, I tell you!

674
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,735
I'm still crazy.

675
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,013
I have you already said 20 times
to strangle.

676
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,417
Lap, he left.

677
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,374
You know sometimes what time it is?

678
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,975
In two words, I am a photographer ...

679
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,296
and I'm looking for models.

680
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,014
My number. If it interests you ...

681
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,256
I wouldn 't be interested.

682
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,055
'n Klein ass. Well, that Flemings ...

683
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,057
For once that a good chickenshit
in between!

684
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,216
They are so prude!

685
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,338
's see. It's true that they Romans
koleirig made.

686
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,895
There are quite a few ads: 'Parts'

687
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,933
'child', 'room to rent.

688
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,372
So, that looks better already!

689
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,616
Hopefully the fish bite.

690
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,051
Miss?
-- Is your stuff quite paid?

691
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,138
Whether you stuff quite paid?
-- That depends on you, poppeke.

692
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,059
Why, a book on
between women and animals?

693
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,969
Exactly! It is a book about the relationship
that there may exist

694
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,296
between a first animal and a woman
other.

695
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,570
Is it not sexual
photos?

696
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,374
Listen, if it interests you,
here is my number.

697
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,253
Otherwise, the cost and salut!
What do you think I say more?

698
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,973
Is it possible ... I see you?

699
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,934
Everything is possible. Everything is negotiable.
There is no price tag attached.

700
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,257
Are you epilated or not?
Have your friends or not?

701
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,099
But you have not really missed!
Was it from a horse or a sow?

702
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,619
You phiz ever seen?

703
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,459
We can if necessary also a book
Halloween on it!

704
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,776
Dirty bastard!

705
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,251
Ga you do about it! Alien!

706
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,850
'n happiness that they get it up or I
knalde my stapler in her mug.

707
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,177
My husband has as it were, a subscription
that kind of situation.

708
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,816
We already have something 's been
at Palma de Mallorca.

709
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,692
I am also fond of Portugal.

710
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,697
That was it for a sunbed.

711
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,051
But here he bled like a pig.

712
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,696
And he has not begun, but the other.

713
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,414
I swear it on the heads
my twins.

714
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,578
Still a lucky man that my time
was not armed.

715
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:27,216
Well, first we make a robot portrait.
Then we issue a detection message.

716
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,297
In short, the conventional procedure.

717
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,695
What did that guy look like?

718
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,255
Brown!

719
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,293
Brown ... in maroon?
-- Yes, dark!

720
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,970
Black Brown. Slightly burnt? You had
it must begin, because ...

721
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,889
Flink sunburnt.
-- Also by coincidence, huh?

722
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,692
I said nothing!

723
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,176
Damn. What now?

724
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,375
Is it the batteries?
Do you have lights burning?

725
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,652
By day, right?
I'm so stupid yet.

726
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,258
I look ga.

727
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,497
't Is the engine.
Boel Shit!

728
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,209
If the engine is not the front?
-- Of course not!

729
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,298
In sports, the engine always
back.

730
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,293
However, this model is it perhaps
front.

731
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,977
Well?

732
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,415
You will not believe me, but here is
no motor.

733
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,133
Call me a guy on?

734
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,533
Fucking phone! Goddamn!

735
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,412
JC?
-- You're t.

736
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,613
Am I not?
-- It's crazy, but I was just thinking of you.

737
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,054
Say it, do you mind

738
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,058
of mechanics and engines?

739
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,138
Engines disassembled and I am I
back together with my eyes closed.

740
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,616
And en passant, I'll give you even
's turn.

741
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,492
In any case, it's not for you,
my dove.

742
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,292
No ... not really.

743
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,333
And ... what are you doing this afternoon?

744
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,134
Right, yes. They have me as yet though
be had.

745
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,978
For a move.

746
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,818
Well, I will be loved.
Where are you?

747
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,169
In Chasse Pierre.

748
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,010
Is it? Is it not hard working?

749
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,259
Why can not ga at Roland--Garros balls
turnips? I know the big boss as well.

750
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,691
I must throw them back. Else
I can 't not mow grass.

751
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,858
I just read a book on the dismissal.

752
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,893
I'm only in Chapter 2
and I know everything already.

753
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,694
's of a certain Jean--Marie Messier.

754
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,336
What is still stupid!
This guy is really stupid!

755
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,618
Keep it all up. You know what? You are
'n niksnut. No ass worth!

756
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,095
You lie there with your clicks
and rattle off!

757
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,177
Born idiot, and you'll fool
die!

758
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,929
You hanging from my balls! You consider
not blow out! Get outta here!

759
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,937
Wait, you mess here!

760
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,654
Forget nothing and get on!
Kloot Bumblebee!

761
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,819
Fuck you! I have never seen!
Fuck you!

762
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:24,377
What a knock that pee!
Strontgat 's ass!

763
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,573
Nadine.
-- Jean--Claude. Nice. Is it?

764
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,533
We find the ... the engine anymore.
-- The engine. Right, yes.

765
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,537
Do not worry, I understand.

766
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,936
What does your husband for a living?

767
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,973
He must have the means
for something to buy.

768
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,977
Usually he is here.

769
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:53,293
He may cross
's glove.

770
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,017
Hot, huh?

771
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,336
And mosquitoes that are here!

772
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,576
Where is Natacha?

773
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,135
Well, what is it?

774
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,376
We found the engine.

775
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,416
Do not you topless?

776
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,217
Get her not to?

777
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,415
Do not be shy.

778
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,656
Who is the master?

779
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,615
Come on, pig!

780
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:46,330
Can I join?

781
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,576
But I have never done.

782
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,898
Not on my arm support, which hurts.
My heatstroke.

783
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,889
Damn! Glad forget!
My aunt is today!

784
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,016
Do something! Quick question!

785
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:28,099
If you see them, they kill you, than me,
and then makes them part of itself!

786
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,374
No, no, no!
-- She is!

787
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,577
I 't!

788
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,496
Three hours to 10 km to go
on the motorway.

789
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,975
Because there just before us a mobile home
was tilted.

790
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:50,650
D'r was not over! They were
all dead! 's Real BBQ!

791
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,729
Sir! Do you sometimes that we
a mattress lay?

792
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,489
What is this game? Shall we enter?
-- Do not laugh! Soon he bezeert still.

793
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,737
Oh, he's quite sturdy.
How long does he persist?

794
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,851
Net 'n zweetcel here.
Let's illustrate.

795
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,539
I will.

796
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,254
One of these, I send you my Polish.

797
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,374
Wait, poppeke, save me
of a doubt.

798
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:15,095
You have surely not all
soldier made? -- No, not.

799
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,972
That hurts, huh?

800
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,460
You know the weird girls there?

801
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,412
They are always together. Certainly legs.

802
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,497
Ga pads underneath to get to.

803
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,975
Pak prefer the puff. Not green
that is moist.

804
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,648
The person we brought in the Sahel ...
er, Israel. Is the same.

805
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,170
Gepikt ones we had?
-- 'We'? Gepikt you had!

806
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,732
Every time I come here, they are there.
And always the white wine.

807
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,295
I do not tolerate lesbians.

808
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,935
Just to see them, are my hair
straight.

809
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,893
At home they still
what they want?

810
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,890
Wait 's. .. d'r is a naked
in 't gras!

811
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,375
He searches his slip, just like you.

812
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,650
Nice that! As you jump, staple ...
-- Sorry. Am forget my underwear.

813
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,249
Now I remember ... Are we
remember your birthday?

814
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,451
Because we are currently around
like chicken without head.

815
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,053
Always pressure pressure pressure, thousand
things to do.

816
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,336
's next Monday

817
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,533
Even better, if we forget it not.

818
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,736
View this does!

819
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,412
I already told you about Natacha's
girlfriend?

820
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,251
She is away from her husband.

821
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,378
Come on, get up. Straight!

822
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,492
Is still awake, man!
With your air of beaten dog!

823
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,851
Stop now 's' s life to undergo
and always a victim to be!

824
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,778
The sun will be on without you!

825
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,540
And if you do not stand up, no one can
a bag that cares!

826
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,618
Yes, it's all good! I get up.

827
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,898
And pull out that ugly underwear!

828
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,493
You need me for a stupid ball
keep Stef.

829
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,656
This is not "social assistant", huh?

830
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,811
Day, madame. Can I sit?
-- Sure.

831
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,092
I'll actually Momo,
for my proof of the school.

832
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,929
Because I had so recently
a turntable gepikt with ...

833
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:06,371
Right, yes! You are a plague lids guy!

834
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,492
But You look honest from you smikkel
like me. I note that on.

835
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,736
However, it is good for once, huh?

836
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,297
's see. "I, the undersigned ...

837
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,695
'I' with 'e',
as adjective and plural ...

838
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,936
If you go to school, you
know.

839
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,335
"I, the undersigned, Commissioner
Laurence Cochet ...

842
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,174
Neige, huh?

843
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,848
'M. Aziz Alami, date of ... ''

844
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,733
When was that? The?

845
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,454
The 12th, I knew t. 12am to 12!

846
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,812
Thus rhymes' t. Etcetera, etcetera!

847
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,976
We make it very formal.

848
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,819
Iglesias's small and still a punk
wait outside. What do I do?

849
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,330
Nothing wrong, that his comrades of mine.

Always the whole gang there?
Can you now and then 's not alone?

851
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,815
He one degree me, but I like him much.
Fuck you.

852
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:58,259
You look good today.
-- I got a girl met.

853
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:01,179
Is it true? Good. What is it?

854
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,769
Fabienne.
-- And she has a cabinet of a villa!

855
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:07,052
Do you like her to her house or her?
-- To both.

856
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,616
Take it on. Give her gifts
and stuff?

857
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,653
Why, you don 't know? You gotta 'let r
dream! You must ... I know a lot!

858

Give her pebbles gift, add a heart to
and she is happy!

859
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,291
She thinks it 's from the heart is!

860
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,855
Will they believe me?
-- Yes. Against women, you lie.

861
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,652
You gotta love, you have to ...

862
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,215
We will not get ... Stay you here
far that is?

863
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,217
I do not know ... Coffee?
-- Did you not work?

864
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,217
Sure I want coffee! That is good!

865
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,775
Black .. black. Of course it is not yellow!

866
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:35,016
I get coffee? No, kidding.

867
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,734
Ga out there but drink.

868
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,613
And I do not care too soon weerzie.

I like that snul please.

870
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,860
Hello? Yes. With whom I have the honor?

871
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:49,776
Ms. Michels? Hello, Ms. Michels.
You must however, submit proposals for ...

872
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,336
You are not my only client,
if I may so express.

873
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,531
a small customer, also.

874
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,208
You know, it is 17h 45
everywhere in Belgium and ...

875
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,536
we would like a piece of
weekend.

876
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,130
That 's not, but if you have 10 minutes earlier
had called, I had something to do.

877
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,376
Now the machines are cleaned ...

878
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,775
and 't most of it staff
is gone.

879
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,494
For a cat a cat called
we have a pot 's address.

880
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,978
Yes. Second.

881
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,933
Ludo, which is still pork?
Alive.

882
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,415
That little sick this morning
arrived, did you have?

883
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,178
Ms. Michels, we do it this way:

884
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,055
I get you a live animal
and a dead animal.

885
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,854
't Live throat I even spot ...

886
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,415
and 't dead I already covered to.

887
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,977
I'll be in public, so I do not load off!

888
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,819
And such a beast weighs 40 kg, so
do not come with a grasshopper.

889
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,373
Roger, Mrs. Michels.

890
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,854
I know that it is a schijtkut,
that my balls uithangt.

891
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:46,370
Of that type who thinks that the whole
world revolves around them.

892
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,377
But will they pay, though.

893
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,617
Because I am counting the VAT not to
but they will still supplement.

894
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,692
Silly me! I send you a SMS
and you are sitting next to me!

895
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,893
I had you still said that they my mobile phone
were stolen, bitch!

896
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,136
Me 'n care, I' m still missing.

897
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,490
She called me often.
I had no private life anymore.

898
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,972
Think you just the way you
Shitbrick?

899
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,695
Wind you not! The guy can hardly
on the car before him jump.

900
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,813
Shut up, will you? You know I do not
tolerated that you talk when I drive

901
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:23,376
Move! From the way! I am here
the king of the road!

902
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,775
Ready for your spanking, Stef?

903
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,577
You still have your shell made
I shoot bangers off, dude!

904
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,611
Okay? Here he comes!

905
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,178
's already.

906
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,575
That was a easy ball.

907
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,417
Not again that mobile phone!

908
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,451
First that palooka in the cinema!

909
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,618
Not in a gym! Turn that off,
You know it makes me aggressive!

910
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,251
'n Secure Fabienne invites me to
't Zoute for her birthday.

911
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:58,452
The cunt, I was completely forgotten.
Fabienne.

912
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:02,369
This is again supermarket music,
ge--remixed by thick jean networks.

913
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:06,610
Would you not ask your wife ...

914
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,892
to her friend Nadine to come?

915
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,613
Listen 's right, Stef. I ga je
a favor done.

916
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,538
We go to sea.

917
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,813
But first I ga you a thorough
decorate course. Okay? Listen carefully!

918
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,976
's from point A to point G.

919
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:27,298
Try not original.
Your head is original enough.

920
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,809
You have no scoop on top of it.
So listen up.

921
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,251
A: Make sure you remain soft.

922
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,816
Two: If you have her talk ...

923
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,976
avoid with her tits
to negotiate.

924
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,694
Three is something that I have
tried.

925
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,408
This is called 'sus of his fall.
-- What?

926
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,895
Sus of his fall.
-- Sus?

927
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,933
You act like you 'n slaptitude get.

928
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,335
You get a fit of hysterics, in French.

929
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,895
Your head is always
just a meter above the ground.

930
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,977
Your risk is not that you bezeert!

931
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,571
Okay, listen. If you can stop ...

932
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:02,137
What?
-- Dan doe je 'r in.

933
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:05,013
That would surprise me. I am
blood in shape!

934
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:12,379
Love you with that asshole doing it.
-- Do not miss that car!

935
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,816
Sports. Bit tricky to get off.

936
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:25,251
Have you 's identity, young man?
-- Yes. Minute.

937
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,856
But I know you! Yes it is, 't hearing ...

938
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:32,449
I look like you 1000 per day,
so I know you not.

939
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,730
Paper 's vehicle, driving license,

940
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:38,216
registration, insurance,
tutti quanti.

941
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,891
Never thought that I had so much beer.
-- Sir!

942
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,214
Ho but kastaar! Almost done!

943
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,456
Calm down! I badly parked?

944
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,692
Do you know how fast you drove?

945
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,893
No. But when I look around scheurijzer
therefore never been to the counter. 200?

946
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,533
Exactly 200.

947
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:00,096
That joke hole soon 200,000 balls
costs.

948
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,018
What is it?

949
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,655
Excessive speed.
-- Wait, you.

950
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,572
Excessive speed?

951
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:15,410
Can I ask where ... I look
out of my caps and ...

952
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:19,977
I look at you, however. Exaggerated
speed? 's Mobile or' n. ..

953
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,057
's radar, sir.
-- A fixed?

954
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,854
a fixed radar post? Wait 's. ..

955
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:29,497
I know that you are on bridges,
transverse now, but I have not seen you.

956
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:34,296
If I see you, I immediately on my brake
stand! Then go here cogs turning!

957
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,695
't I do not care a straw.
I know high--ranking figures.

958
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:37,855
Good as that.

959
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,256
How old are you?

960
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:50,173
Day D--1, but I got my license
bought ... achieved.

961
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,655
Then you start
with practice.

962
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,328
Take 't drive, and Mr is
the killing place.

963
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:59,374
No, because women in 't make me send ...
-- Shut up! Follow me to go to the station.

964
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,857
Very good.

965
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,612
Better a good system than a poorly
process, as they say.

966
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:11,015
Indeed.

967
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,451
But be plumes by a delicious
chicken, that's something else.

968
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,898
Thanks.

969
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,336
Bourgeois as pigs.
The older ...

970
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,974
Get your paws off of my seat, you!

971
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,016
Where should I park here?

972
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,575
I put me here, I lock the whole lot.

973
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:01,056
If the red road will, move me
as I want it.

974
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:05,731
Tedju! You see where the money goes.

975
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:08,773
That is not a residence,
just a holiday.

976
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,337
Tedju ...

977
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,177
As in the movie.

978
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,972
You see me? You see me?

979
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,778
Draw a long face?

980
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,098
Not, I say you. If they do not
with 200, get back with me.

981
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,894
You're on top. 'S case.

982
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,694
As a precaution. From professionalism.

983
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:39,089
We are now once true professionals.
Come now. Come, come.

984
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,894
Let me not ...
How are we now?

985
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,614
It seems nothing. Come, come now ...

986
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:49,651
Nothing to ado, so that once.

987
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,294
It's like a dog, nothing more.

988
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,937
Stay with me, because I do not know
I must go.

989
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,938
Goal!

990
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,097
Stay there, you!

991
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,491
Is it not, no?
Dirty snot monkeys!

992
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,413
Times it back to your caravan,
bohemerin dirty!

993
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,815
Who is the king who lives here, huh?

994
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,738
Bastard!

995
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,694
What a cute piggy! a Really?

996
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,573
No, a power.
-- Claudy Focan, pleasant.

997
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,214
Director 's slaughterhouse of Anderlecht.
-- Fabienne Michel.

998
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,775
Al 2 Dool I am here in the neighborhood around.
They put me out ...

999
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:47,574
very friendly, moreover,
your mom or your grandmother, no idea ...

1000
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:51,409
a white house with a red roof.
But you see nothing else here.

1001
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,736
Is this a quote or something?
-- No, no cite.

1002
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,976
I park in front me, I watch 'house.

1003
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:58,694
Gray with a black roof. Did they 't
herschilderd tonight?

1004
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,937
Say 's, Nat, is' t now between JC
and you?

1005
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,290
I mean ... are you in love?

1006
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:07,378
What you actually see in him?
He is not a playboy.

1007
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:10,453
He is unpredictable, shy ...

1008
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:14,255
very sensitive. I know, you see
absolutely not, but ...

1009
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,610
He still has a large mug.

1010
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:19,414
And living with that guy?
That I do not understand.

1011
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,852
He always has money in his pocket,
and he does not work.

1012
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,495
Tell me that he is a thief.
-- No.

1013
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,531
He takes the money where it is.

1014
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,129
Not just money.
These bikes, for example.

1015
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,695
Tell me that he has rented!

1016
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,936
Not rented, but stolen, yes!

1017
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:38,689
If you rent a bike, there is always
a yellow label

1018
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,210
with rental Rene 'or something like it!

1019
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:44,411
Here only Eddy Merckx 'on!

1020
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,930
Cheers! And relax now.

1021
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,210
But I do nothing else!

1022
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,816
And how do you Stef?
-- Herbegin not your thing with 4!

1023
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,898
Nadine, I am talking about Stef and you.

1024
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:02,374
He is sweet, but he is
totally my type.

1025
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,329
Had I known, I had
brought my swimsuit.

1026
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,334
You combed with a two over this morning?
-- How is it?

1027
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:12,576
At his convenience.

1028
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:16,898
Day! I feel like you pipes.
That way.

1029
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,774
Goddamn! What a waste!

1030
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:26,576
If I remember that that guy 'r is
bepotelen, I am not good!

1031
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,135
a very nice body. Let 's see.

1032
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,536
Curious what's under shorts that is.

1033
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,496
Even with money, and that is now mustache.

1034
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,170
Note 's over, I'm still
t go.

1035
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:45,692
Not now, Greg! I have things to do!
D'r is a package people!

1036
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,494
I 've also pressure pressure!
And it is just a birthday?

1037
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:52,409
This Mr with his glasses. This is your man.
Help with you sir 't pig?

1038
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:55,851
What pig?
-- 'T Pig! And hurry!

1039
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:01,371
Ga don 't unload pig?
-- Apparently so.

1040
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,855
You are so thin like a smelt.
't Is heavier than you.

1041
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,096
Where is that pig?

1042
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,655
In the silica, in my car.
's Yellow Silica.

1043
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:12,819
If you enter the left of me.
't Beest is in the suitcase. Here.

1044
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,898
Thanks, boss.

1045
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:24,969
I had you a beer asked, not Mozart.
That's only 10 in cl.

1046
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,496
Goddamn!

1047
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,973
Damn, my mom will kill me!

1048
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,133
Surely, that pig?

1049
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,854
Nadine is keischattig.

1050
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,819
And the smell of 'r.

1051
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,455
She smells a bit like a baby's neck.

1052
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,936
I am a little stressed
for tonight.

1053
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:49,928
Keep it on with your drivel! You know
7 points on your hand!

1054
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,336
No, but without sedaris ...

1055
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,137
I can not ...

1056
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,815
Although, I do not know whether it will succeed ...

1057
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,979
No, kidding!

1058
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,802
So you're Fabienne?

1059
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:19,203
And your anniversary?

1060
01:06:19,406 --> 01:06:21,362
Happy birthday, then.

1061
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,562
Take it shoots.

1062
01:06:35,246 --> 01:06:36,315
Is it not, no?

1063
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:39,324
Sorry, but I do not want them
come to my breasts.

1064
01:06:39,526 --> 01:06:41,084
's but breasts!

1065
01:06:41,886 --> 01:06:44,081
Damn, it zeikt blood from my nose!

1066
01:06:44,686 --> 01:06:46,563
I am sick of it!

1067
01:06:52,086 --> 01:06:55,317
'Night. Shall we know
what you doing up there?

1068
01:06:55,806 --> 01:06:59,560
I make a photograph of the eclipse.
Apparently, there are stars to be seen.

1069
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,280
That you 't know, the moon is called
behind you.

1070
01:07:02,486 --> 01:07:05,558
What 's aggressiveness, say!
Calm down, I did nothing wrong.

1071
01:07:05,766 --> 01:07:07,563
Cool, man.
-- Nobody is bepoteld.

1072
01:07:08,046 --> 01:07:09,764
Who are you?

1073
01:07:09,966 --> 01:07:13,117
In some lout her aanklampt?
We do not have the whole night.

1074
01:07:13,326 --> 01:07:15,362
If you want to reach point G, then for!

1075
01:07:15,566 --> 01:07:17,522
Stef And how do you do?

1076
01:07:18,286 --> 01:07:19,924
Again, that tells me nothing total.

1077
01:07:20,126 --> 01:07:22,003
Like that is always with the flu.

1078
01:07:22,206 --> 01:07:24,436
If he talks, you hear only
the consonants.

1079
01:07:26,046 --> 01:07:27,604
Ga anyway!

1080
01:07:28,526 --> 01:07:30,482
You must all be fooled!

1081
01:07:30,926 --> 01:07:32,644
Lifting it!

1082
01:07:33,486 --> 01:07:36,796
I 'm never without glass
seen in his hand. View 'm.

1083
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:40,884
Is it?

1084
01:07:41,086 --> 01:07:43,042
Come here, you.

1085
01:07:43,246 --> 01:07:46,477
What is your name? You're good for, say!

1086
01:07:48,206 --> 01:07:50,800
Dan ga but I 's again ...

1087
01:07:51,006 --> 01:07:53,918
my husband, who 't judge with a whore.

1088
01:08:05,846 --> 01:08:07,518
Stop it! What are you doing?

1089
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:10,996
View all yourself if you got drunk?

1090
01:08:11,206 --> 01:08:13,162
Beware, you fall in the water.

1091
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,405
Damn! He has it made!

1092
01:08:33,006 --> 01:08:34,962
What is he doing at the bottom of it pool?

1093
01:08:40,686 --> 01:08:43,644
What awaits them? Spring still
in the water!

1094
01:08:43,846 --> 01:08:45,677
But I know him not ...

1095
01:09:40,446 --> 01:09:43,358
Here is t.
-- Is this your school?

1096
01:09:50,526 --> 01:09:52,562
See you then.

1097
01:09:55,086 --> 01:09:57,441
I got a very good evening spent.

1098
01:10:05,246 --> 01:10:07,362
Would you hug me?

1099
01:10:08,286 --> 01:10:10,004
What?

1100
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:14,238
I wanted to know whether you wanted me
embrace, because ...

1101
01:10:14,846 --> 01:10:17,280
because I want to be happy.

1102
01:10:20,206 --> 01:10:22,083
Me too.

1103
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:57,202
We call each other.

1104
01:11:10,606 --> 01:11:14,315
The past 3 weeks you are 15 times
assaulted become.

1105
01:11:14,486 --> 01:11:17,159
Successively by a psychopath,
rich kids ...

1106
01:11:17,366 --> 01:11:19,721
In short, a real national
of bitter!

1107
01:11:20,686 --> 01:11:24,076
According to me, it maybe time
to get back into question.

1108
01:11:24,286 --> 01:11:27,995
Because everyone seems it is fully
agree ...

1109
01:11:28,286 --> 01:11:31,039
it 's perhaps a bit
your fault could be.

1110
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:33,840
So I ga 's address
from a friend ...

1111
01:11:34,046 --> 01:11:36,879
psychologist. That is not a big word,
please note.

1112
01:11:37,086 --> 01:11:38,917
I would you can help.

1113
01:11:39,126 --> 01:11:42,038
His name is Dimitri. Winners.
Will 's what else.

1114
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:43,915
I want my mommy!

1115
01:11:44,126 --> 01:11:47,277
Does anyone know what a scourge is?

1116
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:52,001
I see no lit fingers.

1117
01:11:55,806 --> 01:11:58,639
Who has something out?

1118
01:12:00,006 --> 01:12:01,837
Nobody?

1119
01:12:02,366 --> 01:12:04,482
Last week ...

1120
01:12:04,686 --> 01:12:07,439
everyone still remembers
's visit to the' t Museum ...

1121
01:12:07,806 --> 01:12:09,762
of accident victims.

1122
01:12:11,246 --> 01:12:14,079
Well, I should ...

1123
01:12:15,246 --> 01:12:17,282
from the bottom of my heart ...

1124
01:12:17,886 --> 01:12:19,842
to apologize.

1125
01:12:20,206 --> 01:12:21,924
Honestly!

1126
01:12:22,366 --> 01:12:24,084
Children ...

1127
01:12:24,366 --> 01:12:26,243
tell you how ...

1128
01:12:26,446 --> 01:12:27,959
I love you!

1129
01:12:28,366 --> 01:12:29,879
Because I ...

1130
01:12:30,286 --> 01:12:32,720
I was not in my ...

1131
01:12:33,006 --> 01:12:35,520
we say, normal to do.

1132
01:12:36,126 --> 01:12:38,242
I know it for some ...

1133
01:12:38,446 --> 01:12:40,562
must have been terrible.

1134
01:12:42,766 --> 01:12:44,324
Especially for you, Candy ...

1135
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,244
Charlotte!

1136
01:12:53,886 --> 01:12:56,241
The debt of these!

1137
01:12:56,446 --> 01:12:57,640
Stuff!

1138
01:12:59,006 --> 01:13:00,724
Stuff ...

1139
01:13:00,926 --> 01:13:03,042
is a pest!

1140
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:07,043
I've never felt something intense.

1141
01:13:08,286 --> 01:13:10,641
While we vreeën, she looked me
with her large eyes Labrador.

1142
01:13:10,846 --> 01:13:14,919
I know! 's Old monkey you should not face
learn draw!

1143
01:13:15,126 --> 01:13:17,686
I think she has never
received a turn.

1144
01:13:17,886 --> 01:13:21,595
I say this not to stoefen.
Because she has cried afterwards.

1145
01:13:22,446 --> 01:13:24,641
This is a classic, man!

1146
01:13:25,006 --> 01:13:27,361
After all the drug problems of the r. ..

1147
01:13:27,566 --> 01:13:29,682
and that gerotzooi by three.

1148
01:13:31,486 --> 01:13:33,124
You mean ... that gangbang?

1149
01:13:33,566 --> 01:13:37,195
I am proud of you. You have a flawless
path to point G!

1150
01:13:37,406 --> 01:13:40,876
Thanks to me, means welt!
-- Thanks, JC!

1151
01:13:41,086 --> 01:13:42,883
Sure, man.

1152
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:44,963
Good as that.

1153
01:13:45,246 --> 01:13:47,521
You are now a barker could buy.

1154
01:13:47,726 --> 01:13:50,638
I have a house on it rural
's eye.

1155
01:13:50,846 --> 01:13:53,076
You've no need
to move, huh?

1156
01:14:22,046 --> 01:14:24,082
If you have no children?

1157
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:30,162
Why are you tonight
no rabbit food?

1158
01:14:30,366 --> 01:14:33,517
Rabbit? Keilekker!
-- Yes, with roots!

1159
01:14:33,726 --> 01:14:37,435
Only is it we never succeeded
these poor creatures to develop.

1160
01:14:37,646 --> 01:14:40,558
Say 's, JC, would you not be?

1161
01:14:40,766 --> 01:14:43,917
Sure. I have my cutter not,
but it will probably go.

1162
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:47,596
Please note that rabbit I clean
but not the roots!

1163
01:14:50,366 --> 01:14:53,199
Be careful! The main ...

1164
01:14:53,886 --> 01:14:56,320
... He was a firm tick in his neck
it.

1165
01:14:56,526 --> 01:14:58,562
Without hesitation! So!

1166
01:14:59,206 --> 01:15:01,595
After you have him only his frakske
still pulling ...

1167
01:15:01,806 --> 01:15:04,639
and I can even 'n cap
them for your sweet.

1168
01:15:05,326 --> 01:15:07,681
Sensitive souls, now please the eyes
be closed.

1169
01:15:07,886 --> 01:15:09,763
Goodbye, miffy!

1170
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:50,715
It's not very elegant you take
in my suitcase.

1171
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:53,759
If I had his head Florent Pagny,
I 'm really different.

1172
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:57,163
Believe me or not ... Vanessa.
