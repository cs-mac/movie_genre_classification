1
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,685
There will be no bargain.

2
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:10,855
I will not give up my favorite decoration.

3
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:18,533
I like Captain Solo where he is.

4
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:47,890
Ah! Do that again!

5
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:46,301
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.

6
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,640
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

7
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,048
I want fifty thousand. No less.

8
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:13,592
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum, fearless and inventive.

9
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,105
It's too late for that, Solo.

10
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,897
You may have been a good smuggler...

11
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:40,488
...but now you're Bantha fodder.

12
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,497
Take him away.

13
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:59,048
Bring her to me.

14
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,310
I'm sure.

15
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:48,634
I told you not to admit him.

16
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:53,389
He must be allowed to speak.

17
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,185
You weak-minded fool!

18
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:03,566
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

19
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:17,826
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.

20
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,769
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.

21
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:44,440
I shall enjoy watching you die.

22
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:09,228
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

23
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,020
They will all suffer for this outrage.

24
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:47,382
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

25
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:13,013
Move him into position.

26
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,498
Put him in.

27
02:14:43,825 --> 02:14:44,826
