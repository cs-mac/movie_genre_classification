1
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,000
A SERBIAN FILM

2
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Baby, I'm gonna fuck you up!

3
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Are you insane?

4
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,080
Haven't we agreed about
putting away your flicks?

5
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,360
What's that?
Give it to mommy.

6
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,440
Sorry, but it's
not a big deal.

7
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:01,741
I saw my first porn
when I was his age.

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,960
How are you, kiddo?

9
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,880
But your dad wasn't
starring in it!

10
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,080
Maria, I'm sorry
I didn't mean it.

11
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,120
I dug up that DVD because...

12
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,360
Laylah called and
wanted to see me today.

13
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,520
Baby, you want mommy
to make you a toast?

14
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,200
The jumping bread!

15
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,240
Mom, what was dad
doing there?

16
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,880
Nothing, hon.
Just playing with a girl friend.

17
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,960
It's like a cartoon
for the grownups.

18
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,600
Honey, I have to pay
for Petar's singing lessons.

19
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,720
Bye, dad.
- Bye, dad.

20
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,280
Easy on that whiskey.
Rye kills sexual appetite.

21
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,480
That's why I drink it.

22
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,240
So, how's family life?
- Nice.

23
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,520
How are Petar and... Maria?

24
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes, Maria.
They're fine.

25
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,760
Next year Petar's
starting school.

26
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,680
It'll be interesting
when they ask about

27
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,320
his father's occupation.

28
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,880
His father is a fine gentleman
in a premature retirement.

29
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,920
The problem with that pension
is that it's not lifelong.

30
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,200
How much do you have
stashed? 5 or 10 grand?

31
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,920
Milos, you were more
than just a porn star

32
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,920
you were an artist.

33
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,480
All actresses you worked with
wanted to marry you.

34
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,440
You're still an artist,
but with a temporary block.

35
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,080
And I'm your guardian angel.
Listen.

36
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Something big is about to
happen. Artistic pornography

37
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,600
of the highest level.
Here, in Serbia.

38
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,760
In Serbia? -Only filmed here,
but for the foreign market.

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,040
Terribly professional.
Phenomenally paid. If you accept

40
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,640
your family will be settled
till the end of Petar's life.

41
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,480
The man's name is Vukmir.
He'll call you in a few days.

42
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,760
Be nice to him.

43
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,840
Here's something for the junior.

44
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,520
Wow, where's his pussy?

45
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,120
You didn't tell me you brought
your copper bro to the meeting.

46
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,320
I came on my own. I knew you'd
be here and couldn't miss

47
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,160
a chance to see you.
I'm your great admirer.

48
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,160
You're well preserved.

49
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,760
Who's the plastic surgeon
we have to thank to?

50
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,280
You know I started early.
I don't need plastic yet.

51
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,320
Everybody needs it.

52
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,280
These don't

53
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,760
So long, fags.
Milos, you heard my advice.

54
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,960
A hooker!
- A porn star.

55
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,520
Has-been.

56
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,280
You know the kind of work
she did after you married?

57
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,880
I know.

58
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,080
No one could handle
a dick like she could.

59
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,880
A natural talent.

60
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,280
Funny she hasn't
contacted her dealer

61
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,160
in the past few years.

62
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,500
Is she off drugs?

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,520
Doubtful. A new,
rich provider, more likely.

64
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
You'll alienate me
from my friends

65
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,960
if you keep checking on them.

66
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,760
Friends, in Serbia?

67
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,680
You can't check them enough.

68
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,600
I gotta go.

69
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,360
Say hello to your kid
and his beautiful mom.

70
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,160
I'm paying for the bite.

71
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,520
So long.
- Bye.

72
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,960
Sleeping time, hands up.

73
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,600
Dad?
- Yes?

74
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,880
Know that friend of yours

75
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,360
that you were
beating in the video

76
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,280
It's only a movie. Make believe.
When dad was young.

77
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,240
I know, but while
I was watching it

78
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,480
I felt something
strange. - What?

79
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,720
Like some kind
of a wheel, spinning.

80
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,200
A wheel? Where?
- Down there, near my willie.

81
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,000
Several of them,
like a family, travelling.

82
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,240
Do they live in me?

83
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,440
They do, hon, in all of us.
We all have them.

84
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,520
Everyone in the world?
- Yes, everyone.

85
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,320
They're gone now,
so close your eyes

86
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,320
think of them and
you'll fall asleep faster.

87
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,160
What language is that?

88
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm translating
for some Swedes.

89
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,840
Swedish? I'm great in it.

90
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,000
That's right.

91
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Wait, I know more.
Listen to this.

92
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,240
You would be a mega star.

93
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,440
So, you say Laylah is
offering you a serious job?

94
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,840
So she said.
It's strange.

95
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,000
Why would anyone
offer me big money

96
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,640
after such a long pause?
In Serbia?

97
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,800
And after all the crap
I shot, look at this.

98
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,080
Maybe they need
the only porn star

99
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,040
a university diploma.

100
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,280
Do you miss it?

101
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,320
What?
- The job.

102
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,920
I don't know. No.

103
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,400
I miss the money so we could
escape away from here.

104
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,320
All those poor girls
you threw away like condoms...

105
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,360
How come you've never
done me like them?

106
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,160
Well, I love you.
I've just fucked them.

107
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,400
Does it mean that you
never wanted to fuck me?

108
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,440
<i>Am I talking to the
Balkan sex god.</i>

109
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,400
<i>Nikola Tesla of
world pornography?</i>

110
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,720
You must be Vukmir?

111
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,440
<i>Of course. Milos, if you're
ready to change your life</i>

112
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,960
<i>right now and provide
your family for good</i>

113
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,560
<i>a car will be waiting
at your door in 30 minutes.</i>

114
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,080
<i>You just hop in, and take
a ride towards fulfillment</i>

115
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,960
<i>of your personal and
my professional fantasies.</i>

116
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,840
<i>Can't wait to meet you!</i>

117
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,040
I'm honored to shake hands
to such an artist, I'm Vukmir.

118
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,920
I'm Milos, nice to meet you.

119
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,040
Right hand is the
sex center in any man,

120
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,200
It's direct line between
your brain and cock.

121
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,760
Ever since you childhood.

122
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,160
Your hand is special

123
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,480
for it has jerked
such a special cock.

124
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,560
Milos, it's an honor

125
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,640
to shake a hand
to such an artist of fuck.

126
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,760
Pornography is art,
but people can't see that!

127
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,520
Why not?

128
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,440
Because they just want
to jizz into a napkin

129
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,520
what they can't
into a woman.

130
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,040
These movies are
mostly made so that

131
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
those who can't
get laid can cum.

132
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,120
They're made by butchers

133
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,240
who can't tell a camera
from a broom.

134
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,160
Their 'actors' would be
fucking a hole

135
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,680
in the wall if there
were no pussy.

136
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,240
Do you know
what proves that

137
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,640
there is art in pornography?

138
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,360
What?

139
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,520
You, Milos.

140
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,080
You are the proof!

141
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,280
Your sense of handling
a woman, your rhythm

142
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,040
of exhausting her,
your talent to umiliate her,

143
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,640
and then, when she is reduced
to a dog-shit, to win her back.

144
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,000
And your love for it,
that's art.

145
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,720
Sadly, this is
no country for real art.

146
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,720
Where there is no life,
there can't be real art.

147
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,680
A real talent will rot here,
while maggots

148
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,840
are giving press conferences.

149
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,640
Have you done anything
I could've seen?

150
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,920
I'm doing stuff
that no one else is.

151
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
Just for the selected clients.

152
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,160
All right, but what is it?

153
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,840
Art, naked art!

154
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
Truth.

155
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,120
Real people, real situations,
real sex...

156
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,160
minimal editing.

157
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,680
There's a serious script.

158
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,760
We know it, you don't!

159
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,320
And what am I
supposed to do?

160
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,040
The same as always, Milos.
Just stand before the cameras,

161
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,160
whip out your cock,
and fuck until it's raw.

162
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,640
I dunno, I'm a little tired
of cameras and fucking.

163
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,120
You're also tired of
humping scum

164
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,200
any time your family
needs money.

165
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,720
Kissing some
wretched cunts

166
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,160
with the same lips
you'd kiss your kid.

167
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,600
Thanks, doctor.

168
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,360
What's that?
- The contract.

169
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,760
No need to read all,
just the numbers.

170
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,280
Something wrong?

171
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,520
I don't know what I'm
signing, what I'm shooting.

172
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,440
You're not supposed to know.

173
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,800
If you knew,
you wouldn't be so good.

174
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,160
<i>In a winter night
way up the hill</i>

175
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,760
<i>A creek was fozen
and covered by the snow.</i>

176
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,160
<i>A bunny's weeping
for that frozen creek</i>

177
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,600
<i>young bunny's crying
with all his heart.</i>

178
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,200
<i>But poor li'l bunny
there upon the hill</i>

179
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,280
<i>perhaps he' after the swallows
heading for a warmer South.</i>

180
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,400
Vukmir! Sounds like a name
of one of your guys

181
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,560
at the Hague tribunal.

182
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Are you sure he's not
an arms dealer?

183
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,120
No, he's some kind of
an artist philosopher

184
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,160
with a grand plan.

185
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,440
So, is it grand?

186
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,440
Dunno, but seems like he
desperately needs me

187
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,720
since he's willing
to offer such cash.

188
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,800
How much?

189
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,400
I won't tell you.

190
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,520
Yes you will,
or I'm not giving it back.

191
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,480
OK, I'll tell you,
just let go.

192
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,840
Don't tell me you refused?

193
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,840
Of course I did.

194
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,520
I wanted to see if you're
with me for the money.

195
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,720
If I were,
I'd have dumped you

196
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,920
for your brother long ago.

197
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,160
So, you prefer poor
porn stars to bad cops.

198
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,080
Does it means that I should
rent my dick to Vukmir?

199
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,200
Remember what
you told me

200
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,600
when I asked
if you missed your job?

201
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,600
Milos, I want both of your
heads to be clear and hard.

202
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,960
If it's true...

203
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,080
If what is true?

204
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,840
That you were always
able to have it erected

205
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,320
with no touching
or looking.

206
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,320
Like a cock at dawn,
rising to its own song.

207
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,440
I also know that
you filmed all your scenes

208
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,560
in the first take.

209
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,720
Don't be so modest,

210
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,920
you're the best,
that's why you're here.

211
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,240
How long do you
think it would take?

212
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,640
A few days.

213
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,160
I haven't translated
from Russian since 1994.

214
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,200
What is it exactly?
Some take-over contract?

215
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,960
We're sending some goods
to Moscow for redistribution.

216
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,320
Want one?
- Yes.

217
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,960
No thanks.

218
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,080
You said you would.

219
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,680
Oh, sorry.
I'm a bit...

220
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,600
I miss female company.

221
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,720
A least you can always
arrest a fine looking lady.

222
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,000
Yes, but I doubt I'll
ever have the real thing.

223
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,760
A relationship, marriage.
Like two of you.

224
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,000
You stopped
hoping too soon.

225
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,040
Women here like
men in uniform.

226
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,440
Especially if
they're not wearing it.

227
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,320
Sorry, gotta go
to the bathroom.

228
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,480
You know what
they say about rye.

229
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,240
It's high time you started
taking care of yourself.

230
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,680
With great talent comes a great
desire for self-fuckability.

231
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,600
Whe, exactly, do we start?
- In three days.

232
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,200
I'm not comfortable with
not knowing a thing.

233
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,640
Milos, get a grip.
You're a porn actor

234
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,920
who wants to know
what a porno film is about?

235
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,000
It's a bit absurd.

236
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,320
You're not supposed
to know, but only to relax.

237
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,320
That's too much money
to leave anything to accident.

238
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,240
Nothing is left to accident.

239
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,200
Milos, that is
a serious organization.

240
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,520
My clients know
exactly what they want,

241
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,400
and I know
what I'm doing.

242
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,040
Don't worry, everything
is already prepared,

243
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,520
you just have to appear,
be what you are,

244
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,920
relax and react
as Milos would.

245
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,280
Pornography should not
be an illusion,

246
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,840
but a live
transmission of sex.

247
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,960
<i>Dad.
- Yes, son.</i>

248
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,400
Remember the little wheels?

249
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,900
I do.

250
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,920
Do you know how
to make them spin?

251
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,960
I do. But you
must do it yourself.

252
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,280
We all do it alone.

253
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,280
Tell me how.

254
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,000
When you feel them,
try to follow them

255
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,280
It's a familiy travelling

256
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,000
and you just close
your eyes and follow them.

257
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,880
Wait, the wheels are
spinning better at night.

258
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,880
Put it in your ear.

259
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,500
<i>Enter the building,
relaxed.</i>

260
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,440
"Home for Abandoned
and Orphaned Children"

261
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,000
<i>Walk slowly ahead.</i>

262
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,440
Be natural.

263
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,520
I wish I impaled
myself on a fence rather

264
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,440
than giving birth to you!

265
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,080
Haven't told you not to let
the villains take you away?

266
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,920
Get lost, you
misbegotten wretch!

267
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,320
What are you staring at?

268
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,240
<i>Bravo.</i>

269
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,880
What was it like?

270
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,840
Fine.

271
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,320
We were filming at
a Home for orphaned children.

272
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,360
Where?

273
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,200
Drag yourself over here!

274
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,960
Look at yourself.
You can't raise a dick,

275
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
how will you raise a child?

276
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,320
The child is mine.
Raiko only made it.

277
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,040
I gave birth to it.
Come, you bitch!

278
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,960
Let me go, villains!

279
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,800
Give me back my child,
you bastards!

280
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,840
<i>Honey?</i>
- Hi.

281
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,200
<i>What are you doing?</i>

282
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,560
I picked up
Petar from classes.

283
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,680
I'm taking him to a costume
party. Are you coming?

284
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,000
No, I'm tired.
Must get some sleep.

285
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,560
<i>Everything all right?</i>

286
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,000
Sure. Just you
enjoy yourselves.

287
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,960
Talk to you later,
must park now. Bye.

288
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,880
<i>The cake is coming.</i>

289
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,080
<i>Never seen such
a cake in my life.</i>

290
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,440
Aren't you in action?
<i>- Marko, you must do me a favor.</i>

291
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,680
I'm all dick.

292
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,880
<i>I need a detailed check
on my director,</i>

293
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,200
producer, pimp, goddam
businessman, Vukmir.

294
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,480
I don't know his last name.
Check his whole crew.

295
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,400
Little bro has changed his
views on checking his friends?

296
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Look, it's important
and urgent.

297
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,640
Understood.
Everything OK with you?

298
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,480
Yes, so far.
How about you?

299
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,080
Working on it.

300
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,880
<i>Light the candles.</i>

301
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,960
<i>Happy birthday, dear Petar...</i>

302
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,960
Baby, the time is flying
and your animal

303
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,600
is snoozing again.

304
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,640
<i>Come on, blow harder.
Blow harder.</i>

305
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,960
Blow harder.
Bravo!

306
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,480
<i>Now we're gonna open
the present from uncle.</i>

307
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,560
This is the present
from your uncle.

308
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,160
How do you open this?

309
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,400
Happy birthday,
my sweet son.

310
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:53,040
What do you think, how does he
manage to be so hard so long?

311
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,960
It's not a dick,
it's a police stick!

312
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,720
If you don't know,
I can't help you.

313
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,280
The bitches are leaking all over,
he's servicing all three of them.

314
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,840
How come he's not tired?

315
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,000
Why isn't he fucking limp,
like all the normal people?

316
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,160
You're at it again!

317
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,400
That's hardly gonna
shape it like we all want.

318
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,680
What was so urgent?

319
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,840
You tell me,
what are we shooting?

320
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,040
Are those cameramen real cops?
Are they protection? What from?

321
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,680
Cut the crap!

322
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,920
You're drunk, nearly
impotent and turning dumb.

323
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,800
I may be dumb,
but not naive.

324
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,800
Vukimr knows what he's doing.
I trust him more than myself.

325
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,000
They're the greatest pros
you've ever worked with.

326
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,600
What've you done previously
with those pros of yours?

327
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,960
Don't take it all on me cause
I fuck animals for art's sake,

328
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,440
while you can't take
a bit of uncertainty

329
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,160
for some big bucks.

330
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,960
Does it mean I'll have to suck
a donkey's dick for money?

331
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,440
It's not so bad,
trust me.

332
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,080
Better than the crap
you've been lately.

333
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,800
You know I miss that.
- What?

334
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,200
The certainty of that crap.

335
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,520
At least I knew
what I was filming.

336
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,240
Do you miss this?

337
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,520
You're losing it.

338
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,400
Lucky for you
Vukmir hasn't noticed yet.

339
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,960
You're resting
from healthy life.

340
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,200
How was the
costume party?

341
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,080
Hey, what's that?
- It's a stand up balloon.

342
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,200
Your Raiko was
a war hero.

343
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,920
If only he knew about
his whife's whoring!

344
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,560
He would've killed both you
and that poor child of yours.

345
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,400
What the hell
is all this, people?

346
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,120
Hello, I can't work
like this!

347
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,080
Hit the whore.
Hit the whore!

348
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,720
Hit her.

349
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,680
Bravo, bravo!
Magnificent!

350
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,800
Milos?

351
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,840
Milos, what's wrong?

352
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,640
I'm not doing this.
I'm not beating women

353
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,360
in front of kids or cameras.

354
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,440
Milos, Jeca is our kid.
I'd never dream of hurting her.

355
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,680
Her mother fucked everything,
from stones to barbed wire.

356
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,960
You're like
a Sunday picnic for her.

357
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,920
I'm not only an artist
but also a professional.

358
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,880
I'd never do a thing
against one's will.

359
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,640
You're doing against mine.

360
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,080
I won't stand
any kind of torture.

361
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,880
Yeah, you seem to
know a lot about torture.

362
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,920
Did you enjoy less than
a midget woman whoom

363
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,120
you locked up in an oven in
Stuttgart and pierced a hole

364
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,400
in it so she could
suck you up for hours?

365
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,920
At least your
dick enjoyed it,

366
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,400
and he never lies.

367
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,880
Vukmir Vukmir.
His name is also his surname.

368
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,560
Worked as a psychologist
in orphanages until 1992.

369
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,040
Then he moved
to the Children's Program

370
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,640
of the State TV. It's
getting better and better!

371
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,680
A lifelong fascination
with the world of film.

372
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,360
Now, it follows with a
mess I had to clarify

373
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,000
with data from
the State Security.

374
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,680
Allegedly, he worked
for them, too.

375
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,000
Sent abroad on a mission,
his trace was lost in Japan.

376
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,520
If he's done any movies,
no one's seen them.

377
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,200
That's about it.

378
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,440
I don't know
what bothers you.

379
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,920
According to this

380
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,240
you've never worked
with a more educated man.

381
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,600
Who are you gonna trust
if not a child psychologist.

382
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,440
who is working
for the Security?

383
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:50,400
Hit it, dad, tear it, dad,
uncle Vukmir is shooting.

384
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,960
Want something to eat?

385
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,240
No, I've had my
daily dose of rye.

386
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,960
You don't have to go, you
can do it over the phone.

387
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,320
No, I must show up.
It wouldn't be fair.

388
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,320
Today we're shooting
at home again.

389
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,480
Without me.
As today, I'm retiring.

390
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,200
Is there any way for me
to convince you otherwise?

391
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,760
No.

392
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,680
The kids bother me. I can't do
such stuff in the kindergarten.

393
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,960
I fully understand you.

394
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,680
But, in that case
between you and the kids,

395
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,960
I must choose kids. They're
my specialty, my whole life.

396
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,680
It's my fault. I thought you'd
be better if you didn't know...

397
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,800
If I had known from the start,
I'd only have declined sooner.

398
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,720
What did you say,
kindergarten?

399
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,760
That's a good term.

400
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,520
This whole fucking country is
one big shitty kindergarten.

401
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,560
A bunch of kids
discarded by their parents.

402
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,480
Do you know
what it feels like?

403
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,880
Your whole life you're
compelled to prove

404
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,840
that you're able
to take care of yourself.

405
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,640
To prove that you
can shit, eat, fuck

406
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,880
drink, bleed, earn money...

407
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,760
do whatever it takes
to survive, until you die

408
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,600
Would you believe m
if I told you that me and

409
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,840
this wonderful family, that
you're so anxious to leave

410
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,680
are the only warrant of
this nation's survival?

411
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,400
We are the backbone
of this country's economy.

412
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,960
Only we can prove that
this nation is alive

413
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,680
and useful for anything.

414
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,800
I can see that you're insane,
I need no proof for that

415
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,480
Just tell me, how does it
all connect to pornography?

416
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,366
No, Milos, no, no!

417
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,120
Not pornography,
but life itself!

418
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,320
That's life of a victim.

419
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,972
Love, art, blood...

420
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,520
Flesh and soul of a victim.

421
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,660
Transmitted live to the
world who has lost all that

422
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,320
and now is paying
to watch that

423
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,508
from the comfort
of an armchair.

424
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,960
I have no doubt
that it sells well

425
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,520
based on the sum
you offered me.

426
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,220
Victim sells, Milos.

427
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,820
Victim is the priciest
sell in this world.

428
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,080
The victim feels the most
and suffers the best.

429
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,440
We are victim, Milos.

430
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,620
You, me, this whole
nation is a victim.

431
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,280
We're just too retarded.

432
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,560
And I won't be
a victim because of that.

433
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,640
But Milos...

434
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,640
you're the only one in this
film who is not a victim!

435
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,720
Is that so?

436
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,720
Allow me,
as your shepherd

437
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,960
to show you
the power of a real victim.

438
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,400
Can it be that you
don't get it?

439
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,520
This is a new genre, Milos!

440
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,480
Newborn porn!

441
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,560
Newborn!

442
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,840
<i>...so that tomorrow,
on 18th of May...</i>

443
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,560
<i>...you'll witness a new Serbian
jet-set extravagance...</i>

444
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,120
<i>Mobile user is not
available at the moment...</i>

445
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,960
<i>Mobile user is not
available at the moment...</i>

446
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,000
If you only
knew how easily

447
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,320
cattle aphrodisiac
is diluited in whiskey.

448
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,280
Actually, rye doesn't kill
sexual desire at all, right?

449
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,160
Viagra for bulls!

450
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,880
A special recipe concockted
by our sexy doctor who is

451
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:02,040
so fond of speed that
she puts it into coffee, too.

452
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,040
Can he follow
my words?

453
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,760
Now, that's our stud!

454
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,240
Look at him, look at him!

455
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,340
Bravo, bravo!

456
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,600
<i>She's a dirty junky cunt!</i>

457
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,240
<i>She destroyed her child,
daughter of a war hero!</i>

458
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:08,280
<i>Sweet little Jeca watched
her mother fuck the junky bums.</i>

459
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,880
<i>She is scum.
Hit the whore! Hit the bitch!</i>

460
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,640
Yeah, you bitch!

461
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,040
<i>Yes, that's one
of the bitch-mothers</i>

462
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,320
<i>who conceive
babies in lust</i>

463
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,320
<i>and than throw
them into a river.</i>

464
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,180
<i>The lustful
brood of wenches</i>

465
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:29,600
<i>with endless
gashes in them.</i>

466
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,440
<i>Imagine she were
your son's mother.</i>

467
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,200
<i>Imagine her turning Petar
into a dog-fucker's bitch!</i>

468
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,680
<i>Imagine that, Milos!</i>

469
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,600
<i>Strike her, hit her!</i>

470
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
<i>That's it!
Bravo!</i>

471
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,760
<i>The unique magic of
rigor mortis!</i>

472
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,000
<i>That's right, make it right.</i>

473
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,880
<i>Fucking cell!</i>

474
01:07:59,891 --> 01:08:01,680
<i>What?</i>

475
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,480
<i>Never mind, he'll come to me.
Don't worry, he will.</i>

476
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:12,680
<i>Fucking hell.
OK, run now.</i>

477
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,560
<i>This one is on me.</i>

478
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,680
<i>Now you ruined it all.
You've destroyed the project.</i>

479
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,280
<i>I did what? How?</i>

480
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,680
<i>You could've drugged any of
your apes to fuck like insane.</i>

481
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,920
<i>You had Milos. Now you don't.
Now he's a headless dick.</i>

482
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,520
<i>If only you sliced, say,
his son's ear</i>

483
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,160
<i>he'd be his old self again!</i>

484
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,960
<i>He'd fuck God in the ass
at your command!</i>

485
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:39,680
<i>Instead, you take a genius and
fill him with a fuck-dope.</i>

486
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,320
<i>You're cheap,
just like everyone else.</i>

487
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,920
<i>Fear is bad.
It's a downer.</i>

488
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:50,200
<i>He needs to rise high. To feel
the ecstasy of a free fuck.</i>

489
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:53,200
<i>When he feels it,
he'll forget all</i>

490
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,080
<i>including his wife,
son, mother...</i>

491
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:00,040
<i>What do you know
about free fuck?</i>

492
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,720
<i>What do you
know of ecstasy?</i>

493
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,120
<i>This is no art.
You're no longer an artist!</i>

494
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,960
<i>I'm not working
for you anymore.</i>

495
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,720
<i>Nor is Milos.
I'm taking him home.</i>

496
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,160
Get away from me!

497
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:52,760
<i>God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...</i>

498
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:57,840
God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...

499
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,680
from that whore,
may she rest in peace,

500
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:08,080
She was a shame
to our house.

501
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:14,360
Raiko was a great warrior,
but had a poor taste in women.

502
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:21,640
Since he was killed, this house
rots with no male to govern it.

503
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:28,600
That's why God sent you as
our savior from all worry.

504
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:40,920
There's not only house, but a
daughter to take care of, too.

505
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:48,240
Our poor Jeca
became an orphan.

506
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,480
My Alice in Wonderland.

507
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:57,360
Raiko was killed just
when he was supposed to

508
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,560
prove to Jeca that
he's not only a father,

509
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:05,360
but a man as well.
You came instead of him.

510
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:11,280
You'll have the honor
of giving her

511
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:15,320
a virgin's communion.
To make her a woman.

512
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,640
Like my late father
did with me.

513
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,600
Come on, come on...

514
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,040
Now!

515
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,000
I'm gonna cut it off,
you motherfuckers!

516
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,680
No, Milos, no...

517
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,640
<i>Our film jumped
through the window!</i>

518
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,520
<i>What are you waiting
for? After him!</i>

519
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,760
Marko, it's me. Come for me.
<i>Milos, what's wrong?</i>

520
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:50,840
<i>Where are you?</i>
I'm in the Celopecka street, no 7.

521
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,200
<i>Milos!</i>

522
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:30,360
Hey, baby, where
you headin' for?

523
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:34,160
Out naked, but
won't take a dick?

524
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,040
Be polite,
the girl is underage.

525
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:43,040
So what if
I am underage?

526
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,760
Look at this jerk!

527
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,280
No, Rasa, don't.

528
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:26,640
<i>Rare kind of Monks
put seven adult he-goats</i>

529
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,960
<i>into a shed
during summer.</i>

530
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,640
<i>They leave them
for a month</i>

531
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,680
<i>until their balls
are like mellons.</i>

532
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:40,120
<i>When they get too hot,
they start fucking one another.</i>

533
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,160
<i>The monks take the dried
bloody cum off their balls</i>

534
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,000
<i>and mix it with milk.</i>

535
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:53,280
<i>It makes the finest
bread spread there is.</i>

536
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:59,080
<i>You're a he-goat, Milos.
I'm your monk.</i>

537
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,040
Don't worry, my child.

538
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,240
My he-goat.

539
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,240
I'll provide a
fitting end for you.

540
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:25,840
Welcome to a
warm family home.

541
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,600
A real, happy
Serbian family.

543
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,680
Art.

544
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,920
That's it, Milos.
That's the cinema.

545
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,320
That's film!

546
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,520
Get away from me!

547
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:08,560

549
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,680
Come on.

550
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,840
