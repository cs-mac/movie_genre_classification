<i>(narrator) 53% of the American</i>
<i>workforce is female.</i>

2
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:32,158
<i>Three generations of women that</i>
<i>turned 1,000 years of tradition on its ear.</i>

3
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,584
<i>As little girls they were told to grow up</i>
<i>and marry doctors and lawyers.</i>

4
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:40,381
<i>Instead they grew up</i>
<i>and became doctors and lawyers.</i>

5
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:45,055
<i>They moved out of the "pink ghetto"</i>
<i>and into the executive suite.</i>

6
00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:49,511
<i>Sociologists say the new working woman</i>
<i>is a phenomenon of our time.</i>

7
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:54,186
<i>Take JC Wiatt, for example.</i>

8
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:58,016
<i>Graduated first in her class at Yale,</i>
<i>got her MBA at Harvard.</i>

9
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:01,901
<i>Has a corner office</i>

10
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:07,238
<i>She works five to nine, makes six figures</i>
<i>a year, and they call her the Tiger Lady.</i>

11
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,533
<i>Married to her job, she lives with</i>

12
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,500
<i>They collect African art,</i>
<i>co-own their co-op...</i>

13
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:17,876
<i>... and have separate</i>
<i>but equal IRA accounts.</i>

14
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:22,547
<i>One would take it for granted</i>
<i>that a woman like this has it all.</i>

15
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,676
<i>One must never take</i>
<i>anything for granted.</i>

16
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:35,636
No, no. Atlantic Overseas
isn't just having a slow quarter.

17
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:39,222
- They may not be flying to Newark soon.
- Don't you think...

18
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:43,734
Ken...a company can't lose $25 million
a quarter and expect to stay in business.

19
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:47,942
They gotta streamline the organisation,
reduce headquarters staff, get rid of

20
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:51,158
operating bottlenecks and then we'll be able
to focus on the real soft spots.

21
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:52,910
- What?
- You're good.

22
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:56,655
You're just realising? Robin,
I need the flash report for my meeting.

23
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,988
- Got it.
- Good.

24
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,329
And the latest info on the IBC merger.
What's going on?

25
00:03:01,462 --> 00:03:04,131
- Steven called. Is nine OK for dinner?
- Mm-hm.

26
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:08,798
Melniker called, said it was urgent. And I
need you to sign these. Legal needs them.

27
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:12,794
OK. Sheldrake moved up the deadline,
so don't make any weekend plans.

28
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,422
- This weekend?
- Is there a problem?

29
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:20,305
No, it's just that I have tickets
to the ballet that I've waited six months...

30
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:24,640
- No problem.
- Tell Steven nine is fine. Try Jams.

31
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:27,017
If they have no good tables, try elsewhere.

32
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:30,936
Ken, I need the P&Ls on Atlantic
Overseas. I also need the latest ZBBs.

33
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:35,022
Robin, I want you
to get me the CEO of IBC ASAP.

34
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,493
Miss Wiatt, Mr Curtis wants
to know if you're free for dinner.

35
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:41,159
Absolutely. Cancel Steven.

36
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,534
And good morning to you too, Miss Wiatt.

37
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:49,255
OK, the Montana lamb with
the rocket leaf and goat cheese salad.

38
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:54,541
And lime-grilled free-range chicken with
the pumpkin pasta and dandelion greens.

39
00:03:54,678 --> 00:03:57,086
- Looks fabulous.
- Enjoy.

40
00:03:57,222 --> 00:04:00,425
- I'm Phillip, if you need me.
- Thank you, Phillip.

41
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:06,062
Tell me, what do you know
about Hughes Larrabee?

42
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:09,059
He's the CEO of The Food Chain,
used to be the CEO of Avon.

43
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:11,647
He's a killer. Real smart, no bullshit.

44
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:15,941
- I've never met him. Why?
- He called. They wanna talk.

45
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:19,442
- I thought they were with McKinsey.
- They're shopping around.

46
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:22,234
I set up a lunch for you at the Pierre.

47
00:04:22,454 --> 00:04:26,996
Oh, I would love to steal an account
from McKinsey. I would just love it.

48
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,373
- JC.
- Mm-hm.

49
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:34,715
- I think you're enormously talented.
- Fritz, are you leaving the company?

50
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,880
- No!
- Am <i>I</i> leaving the company?

51
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,464
- Christ, let me get it out!
- Sorry.

52
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,505
No.

53
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,308
I want you to become a partner.

54
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:47,642
Oh.

55
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:51,054
Oh, well...

56
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:56,645
...I accept. This is great, Fritz.
This is very exciting. Wow.

57
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:59,567
Of course I have to discuss it with Everett.

58
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:02,188
I hope he remembers me.
I only met him a few times.

59
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:05,776
You reel in The Food Chain,
he'll remember you. I promise.

60
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,402
Well...

61
00:05:09,164 --> 00:05:12,367
Let me ask you something.
How many hours a week do you work?

62
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,577
I don't know. 70, 80.

63
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:18,376
Well, realise as a partner
the hours are only gonna get worse.

64
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:22,255
I never complain about these things.
You know me. I like work.

65
00:05:22,385 --> 00:05:24,876
- Yeah, I know, OK.
- So you know that I...

66
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:28,428
- Just let me get this off my chest, OK?
- Sure.

67
00:05:28,558 --> 00:05:30,929
- <i>(knocking)</i>
- Now...

68
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,387
What's that knocking?

69
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:40,440
Well, never mind. Look, you know that
normally I don't think of you as a woman.

70
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:46,947
But in this case, I do have to
look at you as a woman/partner.

71
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,740
I mean, what if you and Steven decide
to get married somewhere down the line?

72
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:56,490
- I mean, what if he expects a wife?
- Fritz, first of all... May I?

73
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:59,330
- Mm.
- Steven and I are not getting married.

74
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:03,161
We both eat, sleep and dream our work.
That's why we're together.

75
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:06,216
Fritz, I understand
what it takes to make it.

76
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:10,335
But do you understand the sacrifices
you're gonna have to make?

77
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:15,466
I mean, a man can be a success and still
have a personal life, a <i>full</i> personal life.

78
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:17,974
My wife is there whenever I need her.

79
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:22,315
I mean, she raises the kids,
she decorates, she...

80
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:27,020
Well, I don't know what the hell she does,
but she takes care of things.

81
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,570
I guess...

82
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,818
What I'm saying is, I'm lucky.

83
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,992
I can have it all.

84
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:39,034
Is that what you're worried about?

85
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,159
Forget it.

86
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:43,580
I don't want it all.

87
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,080
I don't.

88
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,007
- How about an Akita as a present?
- A dog?

89
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:55,920
- I thought you loved them.
- I love looking at 'em, but owning one?

90
00:06:56,055 --> 00:07:00,848
You've got to feed it and walk it and we'd
have hair everywhere. What if it died?

91
00:07:00,977 --> 00:07:05,140
- Jeez, it was just a thought.
- Well, it's a lovely thought. It's just...

92
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:09,899
Oh, you know me.
I'm not really great with living things.

93
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:12,525
<i>I</i> think you are.

94
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:17,280
- D'you wanna make love?
- Please. Really.

95
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:21,742
All right, it's coming off right now.

96
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:23,911
Oh, dear.

97
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,701
- Oh! Oh, Steven!
- Hm?

98
00:07:28,837 --> 00:07:30,544
- Did you see this house?
- No.

99
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:35,215
- Listen to this. "62-acre Vermont estate."
- Mm-hm.

100
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:39,672
"Fruit orchard, swimming pond,
360° view of the mountains."

101
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:42,640
This is so great.

102
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:49,098
- Why do you keep saving those things?
- A lot of people have vacation homes.

103
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:52,226
Yeah, people who take vacations
have vacation homes.

104
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:54,516
Well, you never know.

105
00:07:54,652 --> 00:07:58,484
I know you in Vermont without
a speakerphone would not be pretty.

106
00:07:58,615 --> 00:08:00,986
- That's extremely funny(!)
- Mm-hm.

107
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:03,441
Oh, God, it even has a barn.

108
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,660
Do you wanna make love?

109
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:09,537
Do you?

110
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:15,291
Oh. OK, I guess you do, huh?

Oh, wow, that's awful.

130
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:48,127
I'm sorry, I really... I'm terribly sorry!
I still can't hear you!

131
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,132
What about his will?

132
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,258
No, no, no, I heard that part.
I just didn't hear the part... Hello?

133
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:57,555
- What's going on?
- I didn't hear the part... My goodness.

134
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:00,638
A cousin of mine died with his wife
in some accident.

135
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,439
I met him once when I was little.
He lived in England.

136
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:07,514
But anyway, he left me something
cos I'm his only living relative.

137
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:11,316
- This could be big. Was he rich?
- Of course he was rich. My family?

138
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:14,317
Hello? Yes! Yes, I'm here.

139
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,320
Uh-huh. JFK tomorrow.

00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:22,036
All right. What time?

142
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,740
Yeah, no, but... Wait! Wait, excuse me...

you said he left me. Hello?

Sure. Sure.

- Tragic. I didn't know them personally.

153
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:25,640
Oh, no, neither did I, but it was very awful.
I mean, you know, what happened, so...

- Why, Elizabeth, of course.

- Your cousin Andrew's Elizabeth.

00:11:58,088 --> 00:12:00,211
What?!

00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,092
What? Wait a minute now.

164
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:08,378
I... Are you telling me I inherited a baby
from a cousin I haven't seen since 1954?

165
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:11,296
No! No way, uh-uh. This isn't possible.

166
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:14,435
Sorry. I assumed you understood
the nature of my trip.

167
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:19,519
Well, that's the funny thing. I can't have
a baby as I have a 12.30 lunch meeting.

168
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,814
I'm sorry, I have to reboard. I'm
on my way to visit relatives in Florida.

169
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:27,646
Now, Elizabeth, this is your Aunt JC,
the one I was telling you about.

170
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:33,073
You're going to live with her now. She'll
take care of you and love you very much.

171
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:37,155
- Mrs Atwood...
- Here are her things in there...

172
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:40,743
...a copy of the Wiatts' will,
and Elizabeth's birth certificate.

173
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:45,291
- I'm not the right person for this.
- You're the <i>only</i> person, Miss Wiatt.

174
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:49,552
She's agreeable. Once you get the hang
of it, you'll be a wonderful mother.

175
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:51,717
I don't... I...

176
00:12:58,227 --> 00:12:59,093
Mother?!

177
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:28,794
Oh! Oh, oh. Agh, agh...

178
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:31,959
Armand! No, just get... Yeah.

179
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:36,259
Now, careful, Armand.
Her diaper's just a little bit damp.

180
00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:39,224
- <i>(Elizabeth sneezes)</i>
- Gesundheit.

181
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:41,757
- Would you mind?
- No, I don't mind. What?

182
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:44,680
Oh, yeah. There.

183
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:46,639
- Anything to check?
- Yes!

184
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:50,473
- No, no, no!
- Just for an hour. She's very agreeable.

185
00:14:08,877 --> 00:14:11,119
- Hughes... JC Wiatt.
- Good to meet you.

186
00:14:11,254 --> 00:14:13,661
Good to meet <i>you.</i> I'm so sorry I'm late.

187
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:17,333
Thank you. Would you like...
I see. You have something to drink.

188
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:22,095
I'll join you. Waiter, I would like
a glass of wine, the same as Mr Larrabee.

189
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:24,050
- Yes, ma'am.
- <i>(crying)</i>

190
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:26,804
So, how long you in diapers for?
In <i>town</i> for?

191
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:28,597
Just a day.

192
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:32,264
- I can't take too much of a good thing.
- <i>(bawling)</i>

193
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,225
That's very funny.

194
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:38,736
I wanted to tell you I was just so knocked
out when Fritz told me about your call.

195
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:43,940
- I've always been a huge fan of yours...
- Armand, what is going on?

196
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:49,361
Let me handle it. I'll find out.
Excuse me, Hughes, Armand.

197
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,994
Sh, sh, sh.

198
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:58,374
Look, miss. Miss! I'm in the middle of
a major meeting. Keep her quiet, OK?

199
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:01,840
- Look, if it's so easy, you try it!
- I don't know how to...

200
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,210
- <i>(stops crying)</i>
- She wanted her mama.

201
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:09,091
I am <i>not</i> her mother. By the way, she has
been through a traumatic experience...

202
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:12,594
...so a little compassion
would not be out of line, OK?

203
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:17,595
I will give you a very big tip.

204
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:22,526
I'll give you my Visa card.

205
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:29,943
Can you believe somebody
would actually bring a baby here?

206
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:31,904
- <i>(crying)</i>
- As I was saying...

207
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:35,123
...I'm intrigued by
the panache of The Food Chain.

208
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:38,618
- Tell me about you.
- Me, huh? Me.

209
00:15:38,753 --> 00:15:43,794
Well, I... I... Oh, I just... I'm assigned
to all our Fortune 100 companies.

210
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:47,507
I personally handle
IBM, Xerox, DuPont, Polaroid...

211
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:50,802
- Excuse me?
...Texas Instruments, uh, uh...

212
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:53,054
...Atlantic Overseas...
- Yo!

213
00:15:53,182 --> 00:15:55,969
- What?
- Your baby just barfed all over my boss.

214
00:15:56,102 --> 00:16:01,558
This is not my baby! I... I went to Harvard
and Yale, and I don't have children.

215
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:03,980
She just... She's... She belongs...

216
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:09,945
Look, I'm gonna hold her for just a minute
but this is not going to affect me. Um, yes.

217
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:14,237
Let's see, who else do I handle?
I also handle Hewlett-Packard...

218
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:20,157
...um, Citicorp, Eastman Kodak. They
always ask for me. They love me there.

219
00:16:26,214 --> 00:16:28,372
Oh, God. Oh!

220
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:31,378
Um, Luvs, here we go. Pampers.

221
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,843
God. Huggies Supertrim. OK, large.

222
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:36,965
23 pounds and over.

223
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:39,007
Hey! Medium...

224
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:41,715
...20. 12. 12 to 24 pounds...

225
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:44,179
...and newborns up to 14 pounds.

226
00:16:44,314 --> 00:16:46,805
OK, so... You're not newborn, are you?

227
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:49,017
How much do you weigh anyway?

228
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:56,481
22... Oh, 22 pounds. OK.

229
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,039
Oh, my God.

230
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:10,995
There.

231
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:13,172
Hi.

232
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:15,841
Hi.

233
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,008
- Hi.
- Hi.

234
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:22,257
I need a drink.

235
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:27,219
OK. I'm leaving you for a few minutes,
so I'm trusting you not to touch anything.

236
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:31,103
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

237
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:50,331
<i>(key turning in lock)</i>

00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:54,037
JC!

00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:59,714
I'm home!

240
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:17,647
Mm, great hunting boots.
Now if I only hunted.

241
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:19,401
- Hi!
- Argh!

242
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:22,314
- <i>(Elizabeth screams)</i>
- God! Whoa!

243
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:24,406
<i>(crash</i>/<i>)</i>

244
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:29,241
- What is this?
- A baby.

245
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:34,447
- What is it doing here?
- You know that pin I thought I inherited?

246
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:36,825
- Yes.
- Well, it wasn't a pin.

247
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,088
Ah, here it is. "We hereby request
that JC Wiatt act as guardian...

248
00:18:45,218 --> 00:18:47,970
...to our only child, Elizabeth Wiatt."
- Mm-hm.

249
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:51,880
"If JC Wiatt is unable to act as guardian,
we leave it to her discretion...

250
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:56,428
...to find suitable adoptive parents."
Thank God you have an out clause!

251
00:18:56,562 --> 00:18:59,848
- You do want the out clause?
- Of course! What do you think?

252
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:03,018
I thought I heard
your biological clock ticking.

253
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:08,193
Oh, Steven, please! Tomorrow I'll contact
whoever it is who finds adoptive parents...

254
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:11,324
...but in the meantime we'll make do.
Would you hold her?

255
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:13,159
- Oh, no, no.
- I can't...

256
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:16,038
- I never held a baby.
- Oh, I see. What, I have?

257
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:18,406
- Oh, God.
- Thank you very much.

258
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,625
Look, there is nothing
in the world to get uptight about.

259
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:26,081
We're two summa cum laudes. We can
handle one little baby for eight hours.

260
00:19:26,507 --> 00:19:29,958
- <i>(Steven humming)</i>
- <i>(JC)</i> Mm. Yum.

00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:32,133
Mm-hm. Thank you very much.

262

<i>(Steven)</i> It's linguini time.
I think you're gonna like this.

264
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:49,776
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:14,462
Great idea. Give her linguini. Wonderful.

266

Ugh! I think it would
be easier to just move.

267
00:20:21,475 --> 00:20:23,515
What are you doing?

268
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:26,300
Spaghetti's dropping from the ceiling.

It is 11.53 and it's time

It's late, we have a lot of work to do,

Elizabeth, grow up. I have a conference in
Boston tomorrow. I need to concentrate.

301
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:38,400
Now, lie down, close your eyes and
stop crying by the time I count to three.

302
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:42,781
Don't shake your head at me, Elizabeth.
I'm speaking to you. Are you ready?

303
00:23:42,914 --> 00:23:44,455
One...

304
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:46,409
...two...

305
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,368

<i>(giggles)</i>

I hope this doesn't appear like
I'm a terrible person for not keeping her.

313
00:24:08,437 --> 00:24:13,561
- You forgot this page.
- Oh, thank you. Thanks. Goodness.

314
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:19,112
Anyway, her parents, I never really
knew them and I'm not the motherly type.

315
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:22,738
I didn't have brothers and sisters,
so I didn't baby-sit.

316
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:25,785
Plus I'm not... natural with kids.

317
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:31,119
I'm a management consultant
and I work 12 to 14 hours a day...

318
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:36,541
...and I just really feel that Elizabeth
needs a more equipped situation.

319
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:41,298
No explanations are necessary. I'm sure
we'll have no problems placing Elizabeth.

320
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:45,293
Don't feel guilty. You're not the first
to put a child up for adoption.

321
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:49,297
I understand that. I'm really
very comfortable with my decision.

322
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,473
And I... It's just...

323
00:24:52,478 --> 00:24:55,682
Guilt's not a part of it.
Guilt's not a word in my vocabulary.

324
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:58,270
I mean, please, guilt?

325
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:06,153
Believe me, JC,
you made the right choice.

326
00:25:06,283 --> 00:25:09,984
You're gonna be a partner.
Your career comes first.

327
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:15,327
Look at it this way: You got her all
these toys and $1,700 worth of clothes.

328
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:19,407
- That's not a bad haul, if you ask me.
- Thank you for your support, Jesus.

329
00:25:19,545 --> 00:25:23,128
- Hey, no problem. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

330
00:25:52,743 --> 00:25:55,697
Put this over you like that...

331
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,240
...and...

332
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:59,578
<i>(sneezes twice)</i>

333
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:04,709
Well, gesundheit.

334
00:26:06,923 --> 00:26:09,544
What? You're hot.

335
00:26:09,675 --> 00:26:11,834
You're burning up!

336
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,469
Oh, let me see.
What did I do with that book?

337
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:20,762
Oh, no. Um, sneezing.

338
00:26:20,895 --> 00:26:23,978
Let's see. Sneezing, sneezing...

339
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:27,688
171. Don't get sick. Just don't get sick.

340
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:32,028
One cold mist humidifier, one steam
vaporiser, one baby thermometer...

341
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:35,606
...one baby Tylenol, baby nose drops,
baby cough medicine and...

342
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:37,817
- Mm-hm.
...a bottle of Valium?

343
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,027
Oh, yeah. That's for me.

344
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,206
Oh, I ca...

345
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:49,628
Oh, I...

346
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:52,162
- Oh, boy. I gotta take this.
- <i>(cries)</i>

347
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:57,885
I know, I know. It's gonna be so fast.
I have to have this before I do this.

348
00:27:02,141 --> 00:27:06,518
I know. Elizabeth, it's gonna be
such a cinch, OK? Here we go.

349
00:27:06,646 --> 00:27:08,768
Now, try one more time. Here we go.

350
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:12,435
OK, good.

351
00:28:28,722 --> 00:28:30,761

352
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:34,427

353
00:28:40,858 --> 00:28:42,685
Hello?

354
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:46,025
Oh. Oh.

355
00:28:47,198 --> 00:28:50,364
Oh, uh-huh. Yes.

356
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:52,947
Yes, that's great. Uh-huh.

357
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:55,702
Uh-huh.

358
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,286
Ten o'clock. OK. All right.

359
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,206
We'll be there. Right.

360
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,846
<i>(woman)</i> This is Mr and Mrs White.

361
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,774
Hi.

362
00:29:26,902 --> 00:29:29,475
The Whites have been
anxious to meet Elizabeth.

363
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:34,523
Before we take her, I wanna hear from
you there's no chance of us gettin' a male.

364
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:40,495
The agency representative that came to
our motorhome said we might get a boy...

365
00:29:40,622 --> 00:29:44,454
...so Father here wants to make sure
no stone's been left unturned.

366
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:48,878
We did try to locate a boy for you,
but there are none available at this time.

367
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:51,250
Well, then...

368
00:29:51,382 --> 00:29:54,051
...she all right for you, Mother?
- Yes, sir.

369
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:59,088
- She got all of her shots and everything?
- Lord, Merle, it's not a puppy! <i>(laughs)</i>

370
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:02,967
I understand you bought
Elizabeth some new clothes.

371
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,975
- A couple of things.
- <i>(sneezes)</i>

372
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:10,180
She's just getting over a cold,
so I brought her medicine and...

373
00:30:10,317 --> 00:30:13,732
Well, she takes a quarter
of a teaspoon every four hours...

374
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:16,982
...and I packed her spoon in
with her clothes and toys.

375
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,068
The clothes and toys won't be necessary.

376
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:26,163
Where are you folks from?
I mean, if I'm allowed to ask.

377
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:29,333
We'll be moving back
to Duluth next week.

378
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,288
Most of Merle's family is out that way now
and our pastor is out there an' all.

379
00:30:34,422 --> 00:30:37,708
I'm sure Fern will like it just fine.

380
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:40,795
Fern?

381
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,343
We're naming her after Merle's mama.

382
00:30:44,015 --> 00:30:46,968
Oh, hush, hush. Hush now.

383
00:30:48,144 --> 00:30:52,189
- Well, maybe I should...
- I'll take care of formalities from here on.

384
00:30:52,315 --> 00:30:54,354
You're free to go.

385
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:56,938
Oh, I am? Oh, well...

386
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:05,197
Bye-bye.

387
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:07,734
You... you take care.

388
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:14,916
Right.

389
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:17,621
Right.

390
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,008
<i>(crying)</i>

391
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:32,014
<i>(bawling)</i>

392
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:53,945
Just don't expect too much, OK?

393
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,907
OK?

394
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,224
I couldn't give her to a woman
who called her husband "Sir".

395
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:27,486
Her whole life flashed before me and
suddenly I saw in a Dairy Queen uniform.

396
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:31,111
- Oh, look, JC...
- Anyway, I can handle it. I <i>really</i> can.

397
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,940
A lot of working women do it:
Eleanor Roosevelt, Ethel Kennedy.

398
00:32:35,077 --> 00:32:38,991
- Ethel Kennedy?
- OK, she doesn't work, but a lot do it.

399
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,245
You don't know what you're getting into.

400
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,329
You think my mom had a doctorate
in parenting? You learn.

401
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:47,830
You should see me diaper her now.
I am so brilliant at it.

402
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:51,713
I appreciate what you're going
through, I do, but for me, I just...

403
00:32:51,842 --> 00:32:53,088
- Go ahead.
- I just...

404
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:55,378
You can be honest. You what?

405
00:32:57,264 --> 00:32:59,304
I just...

406
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:04,851
- No?
- I can't.

407
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:07,599
OK.

408
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,236
- Do we have any women partners?
- One. In the Chicago office.

409
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:04,452
- Good morning, Mr Sloane.
- Right, right. The redhead.

410
00:34:04,578 --> 00:34:08,409
Everett, it's down here.
The first office on the left.

411
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:20,715
I found it! Here you go.
Here you go, Miss. There it is.

412
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:22,629
Oh!

413
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,964
Oh, hello! Oh, hello.

414
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:30,225
- Everett, you remember JC, don't you?
- Of course. Everett, how do you do?

415
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:34,479
I thought you were in Washington.
Won't you please come right on in?

416
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,645
Yes. Sit down.

417
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,146
Um... <i>(whispers)</i> Charlotte?

418
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,022
Everett, why don't you sit down?

419
00:34:45,157 --> 00:34:49,534
Oh, Everett, excuse me. So, so sorry.
If you could just scoot over. I'm sorry.

420
00:34:49,661 --> 00:34:53,160
<i>(gasps)</i> Oh, my goodness.
I have a hair dryer in the closet.

421
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:55,116
- I'm fine.
- Perhaps a towel?

422
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,823
- No, I'm fine.
- Very sorry about that.

423
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:02,293
- When did she have a baby?
- This isn't JC's baby. It's her cousin's.

424
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:06,551
- She's just keeping it for a few days.
- Well, Fritz, as it turns out...

425
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:10,924
...I'm keeping her - excuse me -
I'm keeping her a little longer than that.

426
00:35:11,057 --> 00:35:13,926
- How much longer?
- Oh, for ever.

427
00:35:16,437 --> 00:35:21,431
Could I interest anybody in anything
to drink? 7 UP, Perrier... formula?

428
00:35:23,318 --> 00:35:26,272
I hear you'd like to be a partner.

429
00:35:26,403 --> 00:35:31,481
Oh, yes. I would love to be a partner.
It represents the kind of tenure that...

430
00:35:31,617 --> 00:35:35,484
Oh, pardon me. Yes, thank you.
I'm so sorry, Everett.

431
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:39,578
It represents the kind of tenure
that I've always wanted.

432
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:42,413
Oh, I'm so, <i>so</i> sorry.

433
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:48,048
So, anyway, it does. Would you excuse us
for one moment? I'm sorry. Pardon me.

434
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:53,840
Charlotte! Charlotte.

435
00:35:54,806 --> 00:35:58,590
Look, this is the single most
important moment in my entire career.

436
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:03,139
If you don't stick this bottle in your mouth
you'll be on the next Greyhound to Duluth.

437
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:06,475
Do you understand? OK? Now take it.

438
00:36:06,608 --> 00:36:09,313
- <i>(sighs)</i> OK.
- Nice to see you again.

439
00:36:09,445 --> 00:36:10,855
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

440
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:15,898
I wanted to discuss The Food Chain's new
entries in the food market. I have ideas...

441
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:19,948
- Good. I hope they buy it.
- They will. The Tiger Lady's on the case.

442
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,535
- Mm-hm.
- Yes.

443
00:36:22,665 --> 00:36:27,243
I'm hiring a nanny tonight. She'll never
be here again. Nothing's going to change.

444
00:36:27,378 --> 00:36:30,663
I need you to come with me to Cleveland
to talk to The Food Chain.

445
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:32,505
I'll be there.

446
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:35,882
I can still count on you
seven days a week, 48 hours a day?

447
00:36:36,011 --> 00:36:40,471
I'm not gonna turn into Erma Bombeck!
I'm a maniac! You know that.

448
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,009
Yeah.

449
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:51,975
<i>(doorbell)</i>

450
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:55,394
Hi. I'm here for the nanny interview.

451
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:58,775
So why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

452
00:36:59,324 --> 00:37:04,033
- I'm originally from Wichita, Kansas.
- Oh. And what brought you to New York?

453
00:37:04,412 --> 00:37:07,081
- The Lord.
- Uh-huh.

454
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:09,697
Well, thank you very much for coming by.

455
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:12,159
I've just graduated from Johns Hopkins...

456
00:37:12,295 --> 00:37:15,710
...and I'm taking a year's sabbatical
before medical school.

457
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:18,420
Fabulous. And what
brought you to New York?

458
00:37:18,717 --> 00:37:22,217
I came here to live with a guy,
but that didn't work out.

459
00:37:22,345 --> 00:37:27,719
Then I suffered a nervous breakdown. You
see, my father tried to commit suicide...

460
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:31,017
...and when I came home
I found him at the bottom of the stairs.

461
00:37:31,146 --> 00:37:34,893
My mother was drunk and
she accused me of trying to kill him.

462
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:40,393
So... what did you say
your baby's name was?

463
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:46,402
<i>(German accent)</i> I think you should know
from the start that I'm a full-charge nanny.

464
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:50,746
I don't argue... and
I do not like to be argued with.

465
00:37:50,873 --> 00:37:56,079
I will teach your daughter to respect
a man. I speak only when spoken to.

466
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:58,582
I need no bed.
I prefer to sleep on the floor.

467
00:37:58,713 --> 00:38:03,754
Well, I don't have any real
nanny experience, but I love kids...

468
00:38:03,884 --> 00:38:07,965
...and I did a lot of baby-sitting
for people back home in Mandrake Falls.

469
00:38:08,347 --> 00:38:10,173
You're hired.

470
00:38:11,808 --> 00:38:13,432
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.

471
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,311
I am leaving for Cleveland now.

472
00:38:16,521 --> 00:38:23,105
I will be back tonight, and tomorrow
we will spend quality time together.

473
00:38:23,236 --> 00:38:25,774
Now, Eve, your new baby-sitter...

474
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:28,657
...is a very responsible person...

475
00:38:28,782 --> 00:38:33,409
...and I feel very comfortable
leaving you with her.

476
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:36,078
I gotta go. Eve!

477
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:39,539
Good girl. Eve, you know
how to do everything, right?

478
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:44,579
- Don't worry. Everything is under control.
- Don't worry? Worry's my middle name.

479
00:38:44,714 --> 00:38:48,000
- Really?
- Well, no. <i>(stifles laughter with a cough)</i>

480
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:51,918
- Now, you have my number at the office.
- Got it right here.

481
00:38:52,055 --> 00:38:55,090
Good. And if you take her
to the park I want you to...

482
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:58,225
I know. "Take the Mace.
This isn't Mandrake Falls."

483
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:01,555
- Very good. Thank you, Eve.
- You're welcome.

484
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:14,445
Everybody knows The Food Chain
is one hell of an organisation.

485
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:17,446
Your managers are effective,
your workers motivated.

486
00:39:17,578 --> 00:39:21,196
According to data, your margins
could be the highest in the industry.

487
00:39:21,332 --> 00:39:25,376
20% growth, equity returns
in the high twenties. So...

488
00:39:25,502 --> 00:39:29,666
...what's the problem? Why isn't The Food
Chain number one in the marketplace?

489
00:39:29,797 --> 00:39:34,923
That's the question keeping me up at
night, then I realised the answer is simple.

490
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:36,463
- Miss Wiatt?
- Yes.

491
00:39:36,596 --> 00:39:38,470
- Line two is for you.
- Well, I'm...

492
00:39:38,598 --> 00:39:42,299
- They said it was important.
- Well, excuse me.

493
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,729
JC Wiatt.

494
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:55,899
Eve? Um, Eve, I'm in the middle of a very
important meeting, so what's going on?

495
00:39:56,781 --> 00:39:58,406
<i>(whispers)</i> The nipples?

496
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:01,569
Did you look in the drawer
to the right of the sink?

497
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:05,535
Well, why don't you do that? And
make sure they're sterilised, OK?

498
00:40:06,124 --> 00:40:09,409
No, no, no. Eve, don't put her on, please...

499
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:12,747
Hi, honey. Yes, I hear you. OK, OK.

500
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,287
Itsy-bitsy spider...

501
00:40:15,424 --> 00:40:17,582
Good! Would you put Eve back on?

502
00:40:17,718 --> 00:40:20,173
Eve! Eve, I gotta... I gotta go.

503
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:26,013
Oh... Oh...

504
00:40:27,144 --> 00:40:28,139
Where was I?

505
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:34,857
Oh!

506
00:40:36,152 --> 00:40:38,904
- Oh, hi, Miss Wiatt.
- Hi, Eve.

507
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:41,271
Um, you got a message today.

508
00:40:41,407 --> 00:40:43,031
Uh-huh?

509
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:47,026
Mr Curtis called and he said
"Congratulations, you got the account."

510
00:40:47,162 --> 00:40:51,704
Well, thank you, Eve.
Uh, what is going on?

511
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:53,448
Um...

512
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,624
...this is Wayne.
- Dwayne.

513
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,873
And we met in the park today
and he was just leaving.

514
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:00,965
Go with him.

515
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,880
So, Helga, tell me about yourself.

516
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:07,882
How's your social life?
Would you say it's active?

517
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:13,221
I have no outside interests other than my
sister in Wiesbaden, my music and books.

518
00:41:13,353 --> 00:41:16,687
Oh, I see. So you're not
really involved. You have no...

519
00:41:16,814 --> 00:41:19,056
- Never have.
- Oh.

520
00:41:19,192 --> 00:41:22,358
So, Helga, you're gonna do
a three-mile walk every day?

521
00:41:22,487 --> 00:41:25,191
- You sure that's not too much air?
- She will be fine.

522
00:41:25,323 --> 00:41:29,190
Good. I've gotta run.
I've got an eight o'clock appointment.

523
00:41:29,326 --> 00:41:31,782
Bye-bye, darling. Thank you, Helga.

524
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,377
Helga!

525
00:41:47,677 --> 00:41:50,084
Helga! Pardon me, Helga!

526
00:41:50,262 --> 00:41:51,721
Helga! Helga!

527
00:41:51,847 --> 00:41:57,137
Helga, excuse me. I'm really sorry, but
I forgot there's just one very small detail.

528
00:41:57,269 --> 00:42:00,768
Could I have your social security
number for tax reasons?

529
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:04,480
One, two, six, dash, four, two, dash,
four, two, seven, six.

530
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:08,192
Great. And your sister's name
in Wiesbaden, in case of emergency.

531
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:10,563
- And her prison record, if any.
- Excuse me?

532
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:14,446
Oh, I'm silly.
I mean her <i>address,</i> if you have it.

533
00:42:14,577 --> 00:42:18,242
Dorte von Haupt,
Kungensensgadestrasse 13, Wiesbaden.

534
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:23,164
"Dauter van Haupt, van Wiesbaden." I'll
just write it phonetically. It doesn't matter.

535
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:25,619
Oh, jeez, I'm late. I'll get it later.

536
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:28,838
Oh, bye! Bye-bye, Elizabeth.

537
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:31,089
Bye-bye. Bye.

538
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:33,459
<i>(honking and shouting)</i>

539
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:37,094
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm... Really, I'm quite fine.

540
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:39,548
I'll see you... this evening!

541
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:51,605
Charlotte, take my coat, will you, please?

542
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:54,352
Oh! I gotta hurry, I know. I'm late. OK.

543
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:57,613
- Meeting's started.
- Thank you.

544
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:04,365
Oh, sorry! The problems of motherhood.
I had absolutely no idea.

545
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:08,199
- So, where are we?
- Have you seen that?

546
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,596
<i>(buzzer)</i>

547
00:43:22,724 --> 00:43:25,475
JC, we were just buzzing you.
Come in for a sec.

548
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:27,470
Sure.

549
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:33,223
Oh. Hi.

550
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,609
Listen, I have good news.
I'm moving Kenny up.

551
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:38,478
Oh.

552
00:43:38,614 --> 00:43:43,240
I think after three years under your
tutelage, he's ready, don't you think?

553
00:43:43,368 --> 00:43:45,277
Sure. Absolutely.

554
00:43:45,412 --> 00:43:49,623
Yeah. I want him to be your
first lieutenant on The Food Chain.

555
00:43:49,749 --> 00:43:52,667
Well, he's already been helping me a lot.

556
00:43:53,085 --> 00:43:57,498
Yeah, I want you to really involve him.
Larrabee wants to push up the deadline.

557
00:43:57,631 --> 00:44:02,626
- I'll need you both full time.
- Oh, no. No, no.

558
00:44:02,762 --> 00:44:07,553
- It's... great. I've got plenty for him to do.
- Thank you so much, JC. Really.

559
00:44:07,682 --> 00:44:13,555
Uh, listen, I've got dinner with
Larrabee's people, so I gotta run.

560
00:44:13,688 --> 00:44:16,689
- Again, thanks for this opportunity.
- That's all right.

561
00:44:16,816 --> 00:44:18,440
Yeah, fine, yeah.

562
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:21,688
- Just congratulations.
- Oh, thank you, really.

563
00:44:23,948 --> 00:44:25,572
Oh.

564
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,199
You were smart
to recruit that kid. He's good.

565
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:33,238
Yeah, he is great. He is really just great.

566
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:37,916
Oh, there you are. You forgot your
Teddy Ruxpin. The Puffalump is on order.

567
00:44:38,044 --> 00:44:41,164
- The batteries are in the box.
- Thank you, Charlotte.

568
00:44:41,423 --> 00:44:43,629
<i>(Charlotte)</i> Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

569
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:45,881
Good night. Have a good weekend.

570
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,049
Good night.

571
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,345
- Good night, Fritz.
- Good night.

572
00:45:12,368 --> 00:45:16,532
What about a week from Wednesday
for junior symphony?

573
00:45:16,663 --> 00:45:20,447
No, no, no. Nicole has drama
on Wednesdays. Uh-uh.

574
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,122
Ben's got playgroup
and French on Monday...

575
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:26,456
...Gymboree on Tuesday,
computer readiness on Thursday.

576
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:29,626
What about Friday,
after violin but before his shrink?

577
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,879
- Perfect.
- Crosby, go play in the sandbox. Here.

578
00:45:36,307 --> 00:45:39,261
- <i>(sighs)</i>
- What is wrong with you? You look awful.

579
00:45:39,644 --> 00:45:41,683
We heard from Dalton.

580
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:46,312
- Crosby didn't get in.
- <i>(both)</i> Oh, no.

581
00:45:47,275 --> 00:45:49,315
I'm so upset.

582
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,695
Without the right preschool
she can't get the right kindergarten.

583
00:45:54,824 --> 00:46:00,329
Without the right kindergarten, I can
forget any hope of an Ivy League college!

584
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,653
Honey, that is so devastating.

585
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:07,207
I just don't understand it.
Her résumé was perfect.

586
00:46:07,336 --> 00:46:09,874
Her references were impeccable.

587
00:46:10,005 --> 00:46:12,212
Dennis is gonna kill me.

588
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,923
Excuse me? I heard you
talking about preschools...

589
00:46:16,052 --> 00:46:20,181
...and I was just wondering, what age
do they actually start? I forget.

590
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,131
Well, it depends. Two and a half, three.

591
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:26,352
Oh, yeah?
Are the good schools hard to get into?

592
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:28,804
Hard? Are you kidding?

593
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,436
I've had Alexis registered at the
Preschool for Performing Arts since birth.

594
00:46:33,569 --> 00:46:35,810
He's already on the waiting list for Dalton.

595
00:46:35,988 --> 00:46:40,780
- So if we're not on a waiting list by now...
- You can forget about it, honey.

596
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:45,986
Mom, doesn't the sky look just like
Cézanne's <i>Bay of Marseilles?</i>

597
00:46:49,918 --> 00:46:54,912
Gee, it does. Oh, Ben, that is
a terrific observation. Go play, honey.

598
00:46:55,298 --> 00:46:59,081
You... They teach Cézanne in preschool?

599
00:46:59,301 --> 00:47:02,505
Well, no. Actually Ben
is a graduate of The Center.

600
00:47:02,637 --> 00:47:06,255
- Oh, that's an idea for you.
- Really? The Center? What is that?

601
00:47:06,642 --> 00:47:12,395
It's a week-long programme that teaches
you how to multiply a child's intelligence.

602
00:47:12,522 --> 00:47:15,974
When we first went there,
Ben, he could barely speak.

603
00:47:16,108 --> 00:47:19,275
By the time we left,
he was reciting <i>The Raven.</i>

604
00:47:19,404 --> 00:47:22,274
What kind of classes
do you have your daughter in now?

605
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,817
Oh...

606
00:47:25,117 --> 00:47:28,699
- None.
- Not even a Mommy & Me?

607
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:31,402
- No.
- Not Gymboree?

608
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:35,288
- Not reading readiness?
- Nothing! Child can't even hold a cup.

609
00:47:35,418 --> 00:47:37,743
The other babies are way ahead of her.

610
00:47:38,463 --> 00:47:40,502
I thought <i>I</i> had problems!

611
00:47:42,717 --> 00:47:45,338

The Center for Brighter Babies.

Just let me out here. I can run, OK?

622

you for all the research on Thursday.

00:50:25,702 --> 00:50:29,201
Right? So you know what you do?
You put a shark repellent in the deal.

649
00:50:29,331 --> 00:50:32,700
Hey, you know what, Rog?
Let me handle it, OK? Thank you.

650
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:35,918
Charlotte, can you get me
Elyse ASAP? Thank you.

651
00:50:36,546 --> 00:50:38,503
JC, uh...

652
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:42,214
I thought you were taking the day off.
What brings you back so early?

653
00:50:42,343 --> 00:50:45,379
- Fate, I think.
- Fate? <i>(chuckles nervously)</i>

654
00:50:45,512 --> 00:50:48,299
- We had a breakfast meeting in here.
- Oh, you did?

655
00:50:48,432 --> 00:50:51,682
- You just have so much more room.
- Big, isn't it?

656
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,479
- I'll be out in just a second.
- OK.

657
00:50:54,604 --> 00:50:56,644
- Excuse me.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

658
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,728
- Ken, do you know anything about...
- Fritz. Hello.

659
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,900
Oh, you're here.

660
00:51:03,029 --> 00:51:07,572
Listen, Larrabee's all over me about
that target list. Know when it'll be ready?

661
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,033
Oh, I'll have it on your desk
first thing in the morning.

662
00:51:11,162 --> 00:51:15,206
- OK.
- Well, JC, actually I roughed out a draft...

663
00:51:15,332 --> 00:51:18,831
...while you were at that baby thing.
D'you mind if I...?

664
00:51:19,962 --> 00:51:22,250
No. No, not at all.

665
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:27,089
It wasn't due until tomorrow, but if you
have it done, I... think that that's great.

666
00:51:27,802 --> 00:51:29,842
Oh, terrific.

667
00:51:30,722 --> 00:51:33,391

- Yeah.
- All right?

OK. Yeah.

- <i>(sneezes)</i>
- I hope you're not catching a cold again.

679
00:52:25,732 --> 00:52:30,274
You wanna sleep with me tonight?
You know, I sure could use the company.

680
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:44,245
Mary, would you have Robin see me
as soon as she gets in?

681
00:52:44,374 --> 00:52:47,209
She's already here.
They had an early meeting.

682
00:52:47,335 --> 00:52:49,162
Oh.

Oh, Robin? I need the flash report
in my office right away.

685
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:59,637
Uh, Ken said that we're going
to pass on the flash report from now on.

686
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:03,678
Oh, no, no, no, no. Wait a minute now.

687
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:07,058
Since when is Ken calling the shots?

688
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:08,349
- Ken?
- Yeah.

689
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,935
I asked Robin for
Food Chain's flash report...

690
00:53:11,065 --> 00:53:13,936
...and you've made a decision
I'm not aware of.

691
00:53:14,068 --> 00:53:19,608
- We talked about this. The figures are...
- Robin, will you excuse us for a moment?

692
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,868
Thank you, Robin.
Their figures are on track for the year...

693
00:53:23,994 --> 00:53:28,573
...and we feel it's counterproductive, so...
- The Food Chain is <i>my</i> account.

694
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:31,873
I decide what is and
what is not counterproductive!

695
00:53:32,002 --> 00:53:35,584
- You're taking this personally.
- You bet! I'm your superior...

696
00:53:35,714 --> 00:53:38,121
...and I will not be countermanded!
- OK.

697
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:43,003
Don't walk away from me! If it wasn't
for me, you'd be selling shirts at Barneys!

698
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,842
JC, can I see you for a minute?

699
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,389
Well, of course.

700
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:57,983
I'm sorry. I know I went over the top,
but this guy's getting out of control.

701
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:02,106
I know he's inexperienced and young,
but I can't use him any more.

702
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:05,607
- Pawn him off on somebody else.
- It's not that easy.

703
00:54:05,741 --> 00:54:08,861
Sure it is. Give him to Joel or Ted.
They can use him, but...

704
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,366
- JC! JC.
...I can't use him any more.

705
00:54:12,665 --> 00:54:15,581
I'm turning The Food Chain over to Ken.

706
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:16,705
No.

707
00:54:16,835 --> 00:54:19,872
This account is too important
for us to take any risks.

708
00:54:20,005 --> 00:54:23,669
Wait a minute. I mean, I...
We have this account because of me!

709
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:28,296
I know that, but you've changed, JC.
You've lost your concentration.

710
00:54:29,597 --> 00:54:32,052
I don't know, you've gone... soft.

711
00:54:32,183 --> 00:54:37,177
Fritz, a baby came into my life. It's taken
me a few weeks to adjust, but I'm back.

712
00:54:37,312 --> 00:54:43,066
Look, I need a solid team on this thing,
and Larrabee feels comfortable with Ken.

713
00:54:43,193 --> 00:54:45,648
No, I think it's for the best.

714
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:48,317
I'm putting you on
the Ferber Dog Chow account.

715
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:53,276
Oh. Well, I see...

716
00:54:53,411 --> 00:54:55,036
I...

717
00:54:57,373 --> 00:55:00,658
I thought that I was gonna be
a partner. That's what I thought.

718
00:55:00,793 --> 00:55:04,411
Well, maybe next year
after things have... cooled down.

719
00:55:06,214 --> 00:55:08,705
Oh, swallow your pride, JC.

720
00:55:08,842 --> 00:55:13,837
Ferber's is a low-profile account. You'll
have more time to spend with the baby.

721
00:55:13,971 --> 00:55:18,550
I told you, you can't have it all.
Nobody can. Not me, not anybody.

722
00:55:19,644 --> 00:55:21,886
I don't even know my grandchildren...

723
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:24,691
...but I've got this company
grossing $200m a year!

724
00:55:24,815 --> 00:55:26,938
Well, something has got to give!

725
00:55:31,029 --> 00:55:35,489
You've been on the fast track a long time,
kiddo. It's OK to slow down.

726
00:55:35,617 --> 00:55:37,656
Nobody's keeping score.

727
00:55:37,786 --> 00:55:43,989
Fritz, I can't go out there now and say I'm
working on the Ferber Dog Chow account.

728
00:55:47,628 --> 00:55:51,163
Well, I guess you're gonna
have to do what you have to do.

729
00:56:49,561 --> 00:56:51,601
Let me see...

730
00:56:55,108 --> 00:56:57,148
OK. OK.

the 62-acre Vermont estate.

732

00:57:09,204 --> 00:57:10,616
Uh-huh.

734
00:57:10,747 --> 00:57:15,325
Honey, you know that big car
I bought yesterday?

735
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:19,920
Well, the reason I bought it is because
we're gonna go and live in the country.

736
00:57:20,048 --> 00:57:23,002
Yes, we are. Here, look. See? See?

737
00:57:23,635 --> 00:57:27,845
Yes. This is our house!
Can you believe it?

738
00:57:27,972 --> 00:57:30,842
I just phoned the number and I bought it.

739

00:58:47,254 --> 00:58:49,924

- Oh-oh.

Well, yeah, yeah.

812
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:21,397

that New York kind of nightlife, sure.

I don't understand these technicalities.

Is this going to be expensive?

836
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:02,942
Yup.

- Nope.
- No. Right. Well, just guess!

839

Uh, $5,000, $6,000. Maybe more.

You see, I need to work.

I'm Doctor Cooper.

863
01:07:33,038 --> 01:07:36,406
You passed out and Mr Boone
brought you here to my office.

864
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:42,252
- You OK?
- Yeah. Where's the baby?

865
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:45,251
- Oh, she's fine. She's with my nurse.
- Oh.

866
01:07:45,382 --> 01:07:47,209
- I fainted?
- Yeah.

867
01:07:48,093 --> 01:07:50,252
Really? I did?

868
01:07:50,386 --> 01:07:53,257
Oh, I've never fainted before, Doctor.

869
01:07:53,931 --> 01:07:56,718
Is there any chance
you might be expecting, Mrs Wiatt?

870
01:07:56,851 --> 01:08:01,477
No. There's absolutely
no chance of that, Doctor.

871
01:08:01,606 --> 01:08:05,021
Zero chance of that. Less than zero.

872
01:08:05,151 --> 01:08:09,018
Well, it's OK.
You can talk about it if you want.

873
01:08:09,155 --> 01:08:11,941
No, I can't.

874
01:08:13,742 --> 01:08:17,111
- I can't talk about it!
- Wait...

875
01:08:17,246 --> 01:08:19,617
Here you are. Here.

876
01:08:19,748 --> 01:08:21,575
Don't get upset. It's just...

877
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:23,783
Oh, Doctor!

878
01:08:23,918 --> 01:08:27,619
You thought that I...
you thought that I was pregnant?

879
01:08:27,755 --> 01:08:29,795
- Well...
- Fat chance.

880
01:08:30,675 --> 01:08:37,175
But, you see... but that's not
why I'm crying, you know, because...

881
01:08:37,306 --> 01:08:39,345
...I haven't had any...

882
01:08:40,892 --> 01:08:42,932
I haven't had any, you know...

883
01:08:43,061 --> 01:08:44,057
...sex.

884
01:08:44,604 --> 01:08:48,519
It's getting that I can hardly say the word
and I was never that into it...

885
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:54,272
...but when it's gone and you have no
prospects of it in the future, it's upsetting.

886
01:08:54,948 --> 01:08:58,731
I... I hope you don't mind
my talking to you like this and all.

887
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:01,821
No. No. Just... just... just relax.

888
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:05,572
I don't know how to relax.
It's not in my nature.

889
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:11,377
You know, I mean,
I moved here from New York...

890
01:09:11,504 --> 01:09:14,955
...foolishly thinking that
the country would be good for me.

891
01:09:15,091 --> 01:09:19,337
I thought that...
I needed to slow down and...

892
01:09:20,304 --> 01:09:22,344
I wanted to...

893
01:09:25,226 --> 01:09:27,681
I wanted to, um...

894
01:09:28,353 --> 01:09:32,813
...I wanted to think and
I wanted to put things into perspective...

895
01:09:32,941 --> 01:09:34,980
...but now I just wanna go home.

896
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:39,606

this 200-year-old house that I hate.

898
01:09:44,118 --> 01:09:46,158

899
01:09:46,829 --> 01:09:48,620
I'm so lonely, Doctor.

900
01:09:48,748 --> 01:09:50,575

- It's OK.

You've got diplomas and a stethoscope.

- Relax. I wasn't gonna put you to sleep.
- What's that supposed to be, vet humour?

910
01:10:23,447 --> 01:10:28,689
Dr Cooper, I think it's unethical of you
to allow an emotionally unglued woman...

911
01:10:28,827 --> 01:10:31,364
...to sit here and think you're a real doctor!

912

- Here.
- I'll sell my house, go back to civilisation.

01:10:46,093 --> 01:10:51,680
I'll get myself a nice little apartment,
watch HBO and have a real life again!

Oh...

918
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:09,814
- Reckon she'll be able to sell the place?
- Not likely.

919
01:11:09,948 --> 01:11:13,697
Place was for sale for five years.
She was their only nibble.

Five years and I was the only nibble?

921
01:11:16,663 --> 01:11:21,490

to move back to New York. I know, honey.

- Well, that's very comforting to hear.

- Listen, Sam, I could use a few things.
- Mm-hm.

- Yale, did you lock the car?

945

Yes, honey, I locked it.

- Get a couple more.

947

- Those are great.

Oh, look at this.
Does this look good on me?

- Well, what are you going for?
- A turtleneck, Sundays reading the paper.

What, no good? They're $12.

951
01:13:03,304 --> 01:13:06,389
You don't need a $12 shirt.
Get a Ralph Lauren.

Gail, look at this! Gourmet baby food!

- Fabulous idea. How much are they?

- Cheap.

- Great packaging concept.

01:14:40,478 --> 01:14:44,310
Look, I know we saw each other
so it'd be stupid for me to ignore you.

969
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:48,818
No. No, really, it wouldn't. Please
ignore me. You have my permission.

970
01:14:48,944 --> 01:14:50,569
- <i>(chuckles)</i>
- Yeah.

971
01:14:50,697 --> 01:14:55,738
There's something about you
that's kinda... hard to ignore, you know?

972
01:14:55,868 --> 01:14:57,695
Uh-huh.

973
01:14:58,454 --> 01:15:03,530
- What are you doing here, anyway?
- I'm just doing a little bit of research.

974
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:07,830
- Can I help you with that?
- No, no, you can't, really. You cannot.

975
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:12,915
What are you doing here?
I thought you were a vet.

976
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:15,588
- Hi, Doctor Cooper.
- Hiya, Stacy.

977
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,472
I teach a class here once a week.

978
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,471
Aren't you supposed to be
headed back to civilisation?

979
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:27,053
Oh, I'm working on it, believe me.

980
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:34,277
- What?
- Nothing.

981
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:38,022
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go have a cup of coffee.

982
01:15:38,658 --> 01:15:41,861
I don't drink coffee.
Anyway, I thought you asked in a way...

983
01:15:41,994 --> 01:15:47,368
...that sounded like you weren't asking,
so I just think forget it. Just forget it.

984
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:49,834
Shit.

985
01:15:50,252 --> 01:15:52,125
I can't believe this.

986
01:15:52,254 --> 01:15:56,465
Um, are you this nervous
around all men, or is it just me?

987
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:18,399
<i>(thud)</i>

988
01:16:19,321 --> 01:16:20,815
Oh, no.

989
01:16:24,283 --> 01:16:30,487
"Place the jack tongue..." - Oh, God -
"...in the slot in the bumper."

990
01:16:30,623 --> 01:16:32,282
OK. OK.

991
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:38,502
All right, now I got this bumper.
I'm positioning this tongue in the slot...

992
01:16:41,008 --> 01:16:43,047
Oh! Oh, no.

993
01:16:48,848 --> 01:16:51,517
- You need some help?
- Everything is under control.

994
01:16:51,643 --> 01:16:53,682
Thank you very much.

995
01:16:55,813 --> 01:16:58,814
- Here, wait, wait...
- I've got it. I've got it just fine.

996
01:16:58,941 --> 01:17:01,776
It's gotta go in the slot. Here.

997
01:17:01,902 --> 01:17:03,231
- Oh.
- There you go.

998
01:17:03,362 --> 01:17:08,319
Yes, well, I guess I'm just... I guess I'm
just not used to this kind of jack, that's all.

999
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:10,277
Right.

1000
01:17:12,203 --> 01:17:16,949
You know, uh, you kind of remind me
of a bull terrier sometimes.

1001
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:19,621
Yeah, I bet you say that to all the girls.

1002
01:17:19,753 --> 01:17:23,287
You do. You're feisty and quarrelsome...

1003
01:17:23,423 --> 01:17:26,257
...and hard to get along with.
- <i>(laughs)</i>

1004
01:17:26,383 --> 01:17:29,218
Even a bull terrier,
once they warm up to you, they...

1005
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:33,638
They what?
They bring you your slippers?

1006
01:17:33,765 --> 01:17:36,256
- There.
- There, you got it.

1007
01:17:36,393 --> 01:17:39,144
Now... I'm just going to...

1008
01:17:39,271 --> 01:17:41,678
...loosen the lug nuts.

1009
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:46,522
These are... The lug nuts are right there.

1010
01:17:46,653 --> 01:17:48,691
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

1011
01:17:50,948 --> 01:17:54,447
Is there something I've done to you
that I don't know about?

1012
01:17:54,577 --> 01:17:59,285
Right. Right. You don't know that
I've been completely humiliated.

1013
01:17:59,414 --> 01:18:03,198
Why? Because you told me
you hadn't had sex for over a year?

1014
01:18:03,335 --> 01:18:07,462
It has not been over a year. Where
did you hear that, at the town meeting?

1015
01:18:07,588 --> 01:18:10,542
- There's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm not ashamed!

1016
01:18:10,675 --> 01:18:15,917
I just really choose not to talk
about this any further. There!

1017
01:18:16,055 --> 01:18:20,598
If a man knows your frailties, it doesn't
necessarily mean that he's your enemy.

1018
01:18:20,726 --> 01:18:24,344
- I mean, I like frailties. I like women.
- Ugh.

1019
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,480
- So you're under control here?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1020
01:18:28,358 --> 01:18:34,063
You and me are probably the only two
people under 60 in Hadleyville County...

1021
01:18:34,197 --> 01:18:36,522
...so we might as well make the best of it.

1022
01:18:36,657 --> 01:18:42,576
I appreciate you taking time to chat, but
I'm not in the mood for idle conversation.

1023
01:18:42,704 --> 01:18:46,916
So if it should happen again, I think we
should both try to ignore each other...

1024
01:18:47,042 --> 01:18:51,750
...cos I'm not one of your students who's
gonna faint every time you say hello.

1025
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,295
I am a tough, cold career woman...

1026
01:18:55,425 --> 01:18:59,837
...who has absolutely nothing in common
with a veterinarian from Hadleyville.

1027
01:18:59,971 --> 01:19:04,300
All I have on my mind at this point in my
life is to get out of this moth-eaten town...

1028
01:19:04,433 --> 01:19:07,884
...and nothing here,
including you, Doctor Charm...

1029
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:11,224
...holds any interest for me whatsoever.

1030
01:19:12,441 --> 01:19:14,931
So what do you think about <i>that?</i>

1031
01:19:31,417 --> 01:19:33,457
See you around.

1032
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,385
Wow.

1033
01:20:10,787 --> 01:20:12,329
We don't sell baby food.

1034
01:20:12,455 --> 01:20:17,081
But this is unlike any baby food you've
tasted. It's all natural. It's home-made.

1035
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:20,045
We don't sell baby food.

1036
01:20:21,047 --> 01:20:22,457
Right.

1037
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:34,973
Now, ladies,
I'm telling you honestly, trust me.

1038
01:20:35,101 --> 01:20:39,562
I swear this is the greatest stuff ever.
Honest. Are you gonna try it?

1039
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:43,307
I'm going to show you something
you're not going to believe.

1040
01:20:43,443 --> 01:20:48,188
Here you go. You want this? You
wanna take it and put it in your mouth?

1041
01:20:51,867 --> 01:20:53,527
<i>(woman)</i> I like it. I love it.

1042
01:21:20,936 --> 01:21:25,265
Let me get this straight. You want the
Country Baby peas, corn and bananas.

1043
01:21:25,398 --> 01:21:28,269
- Why don't I send you my catalogue?
- Great.

1044
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:38,698

1045
01:21:49,587 --> 01:21:51,627
- Morning, JC.
- Morning.

1046
01:21:55,801 --> 01:21:59,005
- We'll send that right out, Mayor.
- Thanks, Mary.

1047
01:21:59,139 --> 01:22:02,886
Oh, excuse me, Mayor.
Aren't you Doctor Cooper's nurse?

1048
01:22:03,017 --> 01:22:06,967
- Yes, I am. How are you feeling?
- I'm fine. How's Doctor Cooper?

1049
01:22:07,104 --> 01:22:10,853
- Oh, he's fine.
- Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that.

1050
01:22:10,982 --> 01:22:16,771
I was thinking about him the other day,
and it's good to hear that he's pretty fine.

1051
01:22:16,905 --> 01:22:20,404
Well, he had a pretty bad cold,
but he's much better now.

1052
01:22:20,533 --> 01:22:25,491
- Just has a bit of a cough.
- Well, tell him I said hi. No, forget it.

01:22:25,621 --> 01:22:27,448
- <i>(coughs)</i>

01:22:27,582 --> 01:22:30,203
Well, I'll see you later, Doctor.

01:22:30,334 --> 01:22:32,042
Hi.

1056
01:22:32,169 --> 01:22:36,831
- Oh, are you taking something for that...?
- Oh, yeah, I think I got it under control.

- That's right. And I'm doing very good.

01:30:50,677 --> 01:30:52,834
Remember that night in the library...

1127
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:57,798
...when you asked me if all men
made me nervous, or if it was just... you?

1128
01:30:57,934 --> 01:31:00,769
- Yeah.
- You know what my answer is?

1129
01:31:00,895 --> 01:31:02,768
What?

1130
01:31:02,896 --> 01:31:05,731
- I think that all men make me nervous.
- Yeah.

1131
01:31:07,692 --> 01:31:09,732
Except you.

1132
01:31:10,945 --> 01:31:12,985
<i>(whispers)</i> What?

1133
01:31:40,473 --> 01:31:45,431
<i>(JC)</i> Moonlight in Vermont

1134
01:31:46,521 --> 01:31:49,640
La, da, da

1135
01:31:49,773 --> 01:31:56,107
Oh! In the wintertime

1136
01:31:56,238 --> 01:32:00,022
Moonlight

1137
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,316
In Vermont

1138
01:32:02,828 --> 01:32:06,196
Oh, people... Yeah.

1139
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:13,956
The sun trails by

1140
01:32:14,088 --> 01:32:16,127
<i>(giggles and mumbles)</i>

1141
01:32:18,216 --> 01:32:20,885
<i>(he whistles "Moonlight in Vermont")</i>

1142
01:32:26,725 --> 01:32:28,682
Hi. Hi.

1143
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:30,719
- Hi.
- You tired?

1144
01:32:30,853 --> 01:32:34,982
Well, I usually require
more than 20 minutes' sleep a night.

1145
01:32:35,108 --> 01:32:37,349
Oh. Ha!

1146
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:39,943
Hi.

1147
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:42,739
- Daddy!
- What are you doing up?

1148
01:32:42,865 --> 01:32:45,652
- Dada!
- <i>(both laugh)</i>

1149
01:32:45,784 --> 01:32:48,619
No, no, no.

1150
01:32:48,745 --> 01:32:51,615
This is not Dada. No!

1151
01:32:51,748 --> 01:32:57,086
I think she's at that age where
she confuses "man" with "Dada".

1152
01:32:57,211 --> 01:32:58,622
Hm.

1153
01:32:58,754 --> 01:33:00,747
- <i>(phone)</i>
- Oh. OK.

1154
01:33:00,882 --> 01:33:03,253
Let's sit here, honey.

1155
01:33:04,552 --> 01:33:07,635
No, I've got to answer the phone. Hello?

1156
01:33:08,555 --> 01:33:10,264
Fritz?

1157
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:13,760
Well... well, hello. Hi.

1158
01:33:14,811 --> 01:33:17,302
Well, I'm fine. How are you?

1159
01:33:18,648 --> 01:33:21,139
Oh, well, thank you. Thanks.

1160
01:33:21,275 --> 01:33:23,648
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

1161
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:27,985
They do? Really?

1162
01:33:29,241 --> 01:33:34,531
They are? Well... well, yes, of course,
I would love to talk to him.

1163
01:33:35,789 --> 01:33:36,453
Um...

1164
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:40,948
Absolutely. Sure. That'd be great. I...

1165
01:33:42,045 --> 01:33:44,618
This afternoon would be fine. Just fine.

1166
01:33:47,133 --> 01:33:49,006
OK, Fritz. OK.

1167
01:33:49,135 --> 01:33:51,174
OK. Bye-bye.

1168
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:54,386
You... I can't...

1169
01:33:54,515 --> 01:33:57,052
The Food Chain
wants to buy Country Baby.

1170
01:33:57,184 --> 01:33:59,391
Is it for sale?

1171
01:33:59,645 --> 01:34:02,266
Well, I don't know. I...

1172
01:34:02,397 --> 01:34:07,392
I don't know, but the thought of
going back to New York as a hit is wow!

1173
01:34:07,527 --> 01:34:09,485
I mean...

1174
01:34:09,612 --> 01:34:11,439
...we're talking major big.

1175
01:34:11,572 --> 01:34:14,692
This is... big, you know.

1176
01:34:15,117 --> 01:34:16,860
Hm.

1177
01:34:16,994 --> 01:34:21,822
So I guess this means you won't be free
for bingo tonight down at the fire station?

1178
01:34:25,043 --> 01:34:26,667
Um...

1179
01:34:27,505 --> 01:34:29,129
...can I call you later?

1180
01:34:29,756 --> 01:34:32,128
Sure. I'll be here.

1181
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:26,180
<i>(phone)</i>

1182
01:35:27,185 --> 01:35:29,854
Sloane, Curtis and Company.
Will you hold, please?

1183
01:35:29,979 --> 01:35:32,055
May I help you?

1184
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:33,898
- Miss Wiatt.
- Hi.

1185
01:35:34,024 --> 01:35:36,811
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you very much.

1186
01:35:36,944 --> 01:35:40,278
- Tell Mr Curtis I'm here.
- They're in the conference room.

1187
01:35:40,405 --> 01:35:43,074
- Good. OK.
- Miss Wiatt is on her way.

1188
01:35:56,671 --> 01:35:58,710
- Hi.
- Hello.

1189
01:36:04,303 --> 01:36:06,591
- Hello, Miss Wiatt.
- Hello, Ellen.

1190
01:36:10,642 --> 01:36:12,681
- JC, good to see you.
- Thank you.

1191
01:36:12,811 --> 01:36:14,850
- Where's the little one?
- At home.

1192
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:19,357
- Oh, too bad. Come in. We're all waiting.
- Thank you.

1193
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:22,184
- You remember Hughes Larrabee.
- Hughes.

1194
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,775
- Thank you for coming.
- Good to see you.

1195
01:36:24,906 --> 01:36:26,945
- And Fritz.
- JC, welcome back.

1196
01:36:27,074 --> 01:36:29,113
- Thanks.
- Shall we?

1197
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:36,746
You look terrific.

1198
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:44,997
First of all, JC, on behalf of all of us,
I want to congratulate you...

1199
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:47,919
...on a great, great success.
- Thank you.

1200
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:52,132
Usually in a meeting of this nature
we have to take the client by the hand...

1201
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:54,885
...and lead him through the negotiations.

1202
01:36:55,017 --> 01:36:59,559
But in this case, we know we're
dealing with a savvy businesswoman.

1203
01:37:00,397 --> 01:37:04,015
So we'll cut through the proverbial crap
and get to the nitty-gritty.

1204
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:05,894
- <i>(laughter)</i>
- Hughes.

1205
01:37:06,027 --> 01:37:10,321
As Fritz told you, The Food Chain
is interested in acquiring Country Baby.

1206
01:37:10,448 --> 01:37:15,904
You've discovered an untapped market,
something we all know is tough to do.

1207
01:37:16,037 --> 01:37:20,497
However, we truly feel that you've taken
this thing just about as far as you can.

1208
01:37:20,624 --> 01:37:25,867
You work with an inexperienced staff in
a factory too small for your product load.

1209
01:37:26,004 --> 01:37:29,788
You're burdened with a severely
handicapped distribution apparatus.

1210
01:37:29,924 --> 01:37:32,925
What we'd like to do
is help you change all of that.

1211
01:37:33,053 --> 01:37:36,635
We'd like to see Country Baby
on every supermarket shelf in America.

1212
01:37:37,097 --> 01:37:40,633
- Mm-hm.
- JC, we all realise that...

1213
01:37:40,768 --> 01:37:43,638
...you may still be
harbouring some ill will.

1214
01:37:43,771 --> 01:37:47,685
In fact, Hughes suggested
we even bow out of these negotiations...

1215
01:37:47,817 --> 01:37:50,983
...but I assured him
you were a big girl now...

1216
01:37:51,111 --> 01:37:54,147
...and what happened between us
is water under the bridge.

1217
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:58,859
Oh, well, it's water under the bridge
depending on how good your offer is.

1218
01:38:05,082 --> 01:38:07,787
I told you she'd play hardball!

1219
01:38:07,918 --> 01:38:10,373
I learned it from you, Fritz!

1220
01:38:11,547 --> 01:38:13,586
Well, thanks.

1221
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,207
JC, shall we look at the proposal now?

1222
01:38:26,727 --> 01:38:32,731
The Food Chain will acquire
Country Baby Inc for $3 million, cash.

1223
01:38:35,778 --> 01:38:36,773
Mm-hm.

1224
01:38:36,904 --> 01:38:40,818
In order to take some day-to-day
responsibilities off your shoulders...

1225
01:38:40,949 --> 01:38:46,323
...we'd like to move your base to Cleveland
so our people can oversee production.

1226
01:38:46,454 --> 01:38:49,574
"Country Baby: Home-made
in Cleveland"? I don't think so.

1227
01:38:51,543 --> 01:38:53,582
That point is negotiable.

1228
01:38:54,212 --> 01:38:58,672
Naturally, we'd like to retain your services
as Chief Operating Officer...

1229
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,334
...with a base salary of $350,000 a year...

1230
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:07,630
...with a bonus tied into the company's
earnings of up to 150% of your salary.

1231
01:39:07,766 --> 01:39:11,633
Which means, young lady, that if
Country Baby performs as expected...

1232
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:15,897
...you're looking at close to
$1 million a year in salary alone.

1233
01:39:16,899 --> 01:39:19,355
What is that banging?

1234
01:39:22,822 --> 01:39:24,446
Paragraph four:

1235
01:39:24,574 --> 01:39:29,282
...The Food Chain will purchase
an apartment for you of your choice.

1236
01:39:29,411 --> 01:39:31,617
Naturally, there are various perks:

1237
01:39:31,747 --> 01:39:35,791
...a six-week vacation, golden
parachute clause, pension plan...

1238
01:39:35,917 --> 01:39:38,788
...and, of course, use of the company jet.

1239
01:39:43,508 --> 01:39:45,547
- That's it?
- That's it.

1240
01:39:53,559 --> 01:39:54,757
Oh, my.

1241
01:39:54,893 --> 01:39:58,843
Well, Hughes, would you mind
if I take a few minutes to think this over?

1242
01:39:58,981 --> 01:40:01,306
No, I wouldn't mind at all. Please.

1243
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:03,939
Oh, thank you.

1244
01:40:04,569 --> 01:40:06,396
Um... Oh, save my seat!

1245
01:40:06,529 --> 01:40:08,569
<i>(laughter)</i>

1246
01:40:12,576 --> 01:40:17,119
- I think it's in the bag.
- Hope. Hope so. Fine, fine.

1247
01:40:17,247 --> 01:40:19,820
What do you think?
Time for the champagne?

1248
01:40:28,091 --> 01:40:30,048
I'm back. Ha!

1249
01:40:30,177 --> 01:40:32,216
I'm back. Oh!

1250
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:36,762
Yeah, I'm back.

1251
01:40:36,891 --> 01:40:38,717
That's right.

1252
01:41:10,255 --> 01:41:13,541
Oh, uh, sit down, please.

1253
01:41:16,428 --> 01:41:18,467
I think I'm gonna have to pass.

1254
01:41:19,055 --> 01:41:21,381
Excuse me?

1255
01:41:21,516 --> 01:41:23,722
My answer is no.

1256
01:41:23,851 --> 01:41:29,688
Well, which part "no"?
No $350,000 base? No bonus tie-in?

1257
01:41:30,065 --> 01:41:33,351
No to all of it, Fritz.
Country Baby's not for sale.

1258
01:41:34,945 --> 01:41:39,572
But this is a world-class deal. It'll make
you richer than you ever dreamed!

1259
01:41:39,866 --> 01:41:44,078
I'm sorry, Fritz. I think I'm gonna
have to stay right where I am.

1260
01:41:44,955 --> 01:41:49,498
Perhaps all that's happened between us
<i>isn't</i> water under the bridge.

1261
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:52,033
Well, no. Maybe it isn't.

1262
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:57,508
I mean, I was very excited
about this offer, but...

1263
01:41:57,633 --> 01:42:01,215
...I don't think I really thought
about what it meant.

1264
01:42:01,386 --> 01:42:03,794
And, you see...

1265
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:05,839
...I'm not the Tiger Lady any more.

1266
01:42:05,974 --> 01:42:11,478
I have a crib in my office and there's a
mobile over my desk and I really like that.

1267
01:42:12,397 --> 01:42:14,639
Fritz, do you remember that night...

1268
01:42:14,774 --> 01:42:18,308
...when you told me about the things
I was gonna have to give up...

1269
01:42:18,444 --> 01:42:20,817
...and the sacrifices I would have to make?

1270
01:42:20,946 --> 01:42:26,866
I don't wanna make those sacrifices, and
the bottom line is, nobody should have to.

1271
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:31,199
No, I don't think this is gonna work out.

1272
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:35,406
And I'll be honest with you,
I think I'm doing pretty good on my own.

1273
01:42:35,543 --> 01:42:40,205
If The Food Chain could put Country Baby
on every supermarket shelf in America...

1274
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:42,379
...so can I.

1275
01:42:44,677 --> 01:42:46,919
I'm sorry.

1276
01:42:47,054 --> 01:42:51,301
I just think the rat race is gonna
have to survive with one less rat.

1277
01:42:52,559 --> 01:42:54,801
And anyway...

1278
01:42:57,022 --> 01:43:00,189
...I really think I'd miss
my 62 acres in Vermont.

1279
01:43:00,317 --> 01:43:02,986
I mean, Elizabeth is so happy there and...

1280
01:43:08,657 --> 01:43:12,702
And, well, you see,
there's this veterinarian that I'm seeing.

1281
01:43:14,288 --> 01:43:16,364
What did she say? She's a vegetarian?

1282
01:43:17,666 --> 01:43:21,996
- Do you realise what you're giving up?
- Yup.

1283
01:43:22,337 --> 01:43:24,828
There's nothing we can do
to change your mind?

1284
01:43:25,173 --> 01:43:28,044
Mmmm, nope.

1285
01:43:40,855 --> 01:43:43,939
- Hi. Is the doctor in?
- Sure, honey. Go on in.

1286
01:43:46,484 --> 01:43:48,524
Hi.

1287
01:44:00,248 --> 01:44:01,362
- Hi.
- You're back?

1288
01:44:01,499 --> 01:44:03,740
I am back!

1289
01:44:05,294 --> 01:44:08,461
- Well, how'd it go?
- It just wasn't that great a deal to me.

1290
01:44:08,589 --> 01:44:10,213
No? Didn't pan out?

1291
01:44:10,341 --> 01:44:11,751
No.

1292
01:44:11,883 --> 01:44:14,007
Too bad.

1293
01:44:14,135 --> 01:44:16,258
- Does this mean you'll be...
- What?

1294
01:44:16,388 --> 01:44:19,922
...hanging around Hadley?
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

1295
01:44:20,058 --> 01:44:25,099
So, if you're free tonight maybe you'd
like to come round and watch the farm.

1296
01:44:25,229 --> 01:44:27,186
- Sure.
- Yeah.

1297
01:44:27,315 --> 01:44:30,933
- I gotta get to bed kinda early.
- You do?

1298
01:44:31,068 --> 01:44:33,107
Oh, well, that's no problem.

1299
01:44:52,338 --> 01:44:54,745
Oh, hi. Sh, sh. Where is she?

01:45:01,846 --> 01:45:03,923
<i>(gasps)</i>

1301
01:45:04,683 --> 01:45:06,426
Elizabeth.

1302
01:45:07,143 --> 01:45:08,602
Mama!

1303
01:45:09,813 --> 01:45:11,852
Hello.

1304
01:45:13,441 --> 01:45:17,854
What'd you do today? What'd you do?
What'd you do? Did you play?

1305
01:45:17,987 --> 01:45:21,438
Did you see your friends, did you?
Were you a good girl?
