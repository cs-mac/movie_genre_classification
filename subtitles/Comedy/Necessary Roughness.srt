Community service, huh?
Been there.

5
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:11,401
Nico, you keep that girl
away from my son.

6
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,637
I'm having trouble
restarting my practice.

7
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:16,840
It's a good idea
that you see me.

8
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:18,441
You ever think
she's hitting it

9
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:19,576
with somebody
in the organization?

10
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,510
My money's on Nico.

11
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,246
Toes should be the guy
on the sidelines

12
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,481
trying to get in the game,
not me.

Rip and dip.

14
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,490
You're gonna
tell me how to play football.

15
00:00:29,186 --> 00:00:30,487
All it took was
a little dip, a little rip,

16
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:33,023
get that extra step I needed,
and the rest is history.

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,191

Gentlemen, our season
is off to a great start,

63

upon myself to create

Bold, isn't it?

68
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,708
The Oregon Ducks
went fashion-forward,

69
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:40,877
and they're making a statement,
getting noticed,

70
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:42,979
and moving merchandise
in a big way.

71
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:46,316
I also set up a photo shoot
for the cover of a magazine

72
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:50,720
that shall remain nameless,
but let's just say it's big.

73
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:54,791
I sold them on my idea to make
football not just cool, but hot.

She's like
the freaking Weather channel.

75
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:00,230
Everything's "hot."

76
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:03,933
I think I quit.

77
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:05,335
This wasn't
supposed to happen.

78
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:06,870
You promised
is wouldn't happen.

79
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:08,638
What -- you're not a fan
of the red, white, and bling?

80
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,838
Oh, come on.

81
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:10,874
The league is never
gonna approve those uniforms.

82
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,075
And the photo shoot --

83
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:13,376
Nico,
you and I both know

84
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:14,744
that this is just
the tip of the iceberg.

85
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:17,247
This is just gonna
play itself out. Trust me.

86
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:19,082
She's gonna find
something more exciting to do --

87
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,950
get bored.
Why?

88
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:23,620
'Cause
that's what women do?

89
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:25,989
No, that's
what Juliette does.

90
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:28,925
Look, I am trying to
run a team.

91
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:32,128
She just
lost her father.

92
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:34,063
Have some compassion.

93
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,303
So, Von Dozer.

94
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:44,007
David, Paul, welcome.

95
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:47,310
Tell me
why you are here today.

96
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,245
I think
Paul reminds me of my dad,

97
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:51,648
and I'm transferring
the resentment I have

98
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:55,351
for dear old dickhead
on to him.

99
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:56,686
No, the problem is
you drink too much.

100
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,254
You're
chronically late.

101
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:01,057
When you do show up,
you're distracted, hung over,

102
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,366
and more concerned about
getting laid than playing music.

103
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:06,563
Sounds like rock 'n' roll,
don't you think, Dr. Santino?

104
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,733
Here's what I know --
uh, you two grew up together,

105
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:13,269
formed Von Dozer
while still in high school,

106
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:15,638
four platinum records,
sold-out stadiums.

107
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:17,774
And while other band members
have come and gone,

108
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:20,310
you two have been
the ones to stay together,

109
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:23,146
until 10 years ago,
when you broke up.

110
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:27,817
And if I understand correctly,
you haven't spoken much since.

111
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:30,453
Do I smell a Doze-head?

112
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:34,924
Let's just say that I am...
familiar with your work.

113
00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:38,695
What made you decide
to do this reunion tour?

114
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:41,497
The cash -- we need it.

115
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:42,999
Yeah, well, after what
you pulled last week,

116
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,834
two other venues
already canceled,

117
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:46,669
not to mention
the three pending lawsuits.

118
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,972
So we're losing cash,
not making it.

119
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,074
Ruh-roh!
I have two children at home.

120
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:55,144
I don't need another one --
who's out of control! --

121
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:57,213
as my business partner.

122
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,252
Let me
tell you something.

123
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,723
People come to see our band
because I'm out of control!

124
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:10,960
I am the show, dude.

125
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:13,830
They come in spite of you, dude,
for the music --

126
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:15,632
most of which,
I've written.

127
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:19,869
Okay, obviously
there is some unresolved anger

128
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:21,304
between you,

129
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:24,807
but are you both committed
to doing this tour

130
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,542
and to working
on the relationship?

131
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:30,847
I'm here, aren't I?

132
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:33,583
Dr. Santino, please help us

So, I am

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,627
I have been having dreams
about a co-worker.

161
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:10,495
Matt or Nico?

162
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:12,664
I happen to
have a lot of co-workers,

163
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:14,900
so I don't know
what would make you --

164
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:17,269
Nico.

165
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:19,271
And the nature
of these dreams?

166
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:20,572
Sexual.

167
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,774
Were they
satisfying or not?

168
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,911
They were
pretty darn satisfying.

169
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,713
Okay.

170
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,117
I realize that sex dreams
are not about...sex,

171
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:33,685
but I can't figure out

172
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:36,888
what the connection is
between all of them.

173
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:40,559
The last one
was actually a scene

174
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:42,627
from a little movie
called "Titanic."

175
00:08:43,963 --> 00:08:46,231
You know, when they're
in the cargo hold

176
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,633
and they're in the car and
it's super-steamy and the --

177
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,535
Was Kate Kinslet in it?

178
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:52,471
Hmm?
DiCaprio?

179
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:55,440
Everybody dies
or you die?

180
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:56,742
No.

181
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:01,079
Dr. Gunner, it, uh --
it was just the sex.

182
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:03,515
It was just
the sex with a man

183
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:07,552
that I should never,
ever have sex with.

184
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:17,929
Juliette.

185
00:09:17,997 --> 00:09:20,399
Wherefore art thou,
Juliette?

186
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:22,134
I think somebody boo-booed.

187
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:25,937
Oh, no,
that's the right costume.

188
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:27,885
You'll understand
when you see the whole layout.

189
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,409
I'm in a onesie.

190
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:33,111
It looks fantastic.

191
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,481
Uh, it's all good 'cause I was
thinking we could, you know,

192
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:37,816
just crop it
right here anyway

193
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:39,217
'cause this is
where the money is, you know?

194
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:40,385
Oh!

195
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:41,753
Well, I hope you
brought extra cameras

196
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:43,622
'cause that mug's
apt to crack some lenses.

197
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:44,556
Hey.
Hi.

198
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:45,657
Hey, there.

199
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:50,562
Tell me Toes is lost.

200
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,097
No,
it's all three of us --

201
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:54,933
me and my two
star wide receivers.

202
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:57,536
Come here.
Step into my office.

203
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:03,375
Why does
Toes get pinstripes,

204
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:05,811
and I get pen stripes?

205
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:07,546
Well,
everyone has an image.

206
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:10,115
Toes is our gentleman,
and you're our bad boy.

207
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:12,350
And I'm the girl
caught in the middle.

208
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:15,120
Okay, I smell
what you're cooking,

209
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:17,122
but I'm ordering
off the menu, okay?

210
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,425
The bad-boy myth --
not my bag anymore.

211
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:22,594
Oh, okay.
I understand.

212
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:25,163
I don't want you to do anything
that makes you uncomfortable.

213
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:28,233
That's cool. All right,
what are my options?

214
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:31,236
Your options are...

215
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:32,537
to leave.

216
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:33,805
Excuse me.

217
00:10:33,873 --> 00:10:37,142
I thought you -- you...

218
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,446
I want to
stomp a hole in his face.

219
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:44,249
I want to put my toes
up Toes' ass.

220
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:48,153
Okay,
but what you should do is...

221
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:51,490
I know --
breathe, relax,

222
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:53,625
work diligently
to regain my spot.

223
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:54,926
Yeah.

224
00:10:54,994 --> 00:10:58,897
Don't let Toes or Juliette
distract you from that.

225
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:00,866
That's great in theory.

226
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,834
It's just that
I'm trying to fly --

227
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:04,336
trying to reinvent myself,

228
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:06,671
and Juliette Pittman
is literally holding me back

229
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:07,839
with a ball and chain.

230
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:10,542
God,
grant me the serenity

231
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,377
to accept
the things I cannot change...

232
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:14,286
...the courage
to change the things that I can,

233
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:16,648
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

234
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:17,949
Yeah, I'm thinking about

235
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:19,851
getting it tattooed
across my forehead.

236
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:25,724
Terrence, don't tell everybody
what a new man you are.

237
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,092
<i>Show</i> them.

238
00:11:36,102 --> 00:11:37,669
Hello.

239
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:39,804
Ohh!

240
00:11:39,872 --> 00:11:42,073
What do you got to be
so sneaky for all the time?

241
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:45,110
When I was a kid, I was always
the best at hide-and-seek.

242
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:46,745
I'll bet you were.

243
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:50,749
Are you aware
that Juliette Pittman

244
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:52,751
has offered
Ray Jay a position

245
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:55,487
at Hawks Cares
for his community service?

246
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:58,223
Hmm. I am now.

247
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,692
I take it
you don't like this.

248
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,462
Juliette Pittman
isn't exactly Mother Teresa.

249
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,667
Dani, she has a good heart.
She's just young.

250
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:12,304
Well, it's not her heart
that I'm worried about.

251
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:15,507
I'll keep an eye on him.
I promise.

252
00:12:20,713 --> 00:12:22,914
Thank you.

253
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:27,619
Place looks
a lot smaller now.

254
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,621
Maybe you just got bigger.
Yeah.

255
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:33,725
So you brought us here
because...

256
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:37,195
Well, if my fan-club memory
serves me,

257
00:12:37,263 --> 00:12:41,399
the Round About is where
it all began for Von Dozer.

258
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:44,069
Sometimes it's good
to remember where you came from

259
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:46,104
in order to figure out
where you're going.

260
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:50,108
Oh!
I cannot believe this!

261
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:51,610
Is that David Blaize
all grown up?

262
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:53,745
Hey, Paul,
how you doing?

263
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:55,080
Good.
Yeah?

264
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:57,782
Holy hell, dirty Doug.
How's it hanging, man?

265
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,451
Well, it ain't --
not without medication.

266
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,954
What's it been --
15 years now?

267
00:13:03,022 --> 00:13:05,090
So,
what the hell you doing here?

268
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:06,524
I mean,
you should have called.

269
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:08,727
I could have packed the place.
There's only 25 people here.

270
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,228
Well,
it's about 25 more

271
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:12,364
than when we gigged here
the first time, right?

272
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:14,699
You here to jam?

273
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,773
Hey, Doc, how you feel about
your own private concert?

274
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:24,643
Me? Awesome!

275
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:30,081
A bottle of
your finest bubbly, please.

276
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:32,317
Make that two.

277
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:36,554
Actually, I-I'll
have bubbly...water.

278
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:38,523
Oh,
you're doing that?

279
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:41,192
Yeah.
Fresh out of rehab.

280
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,328
I went to rehab.
You get the best drugs there.

281
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:47,365
Kidding. Sort of.

282
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:50,135
Yeah, I'm just trying to
stick with the program,

283
00:13:50,202 --> 00:13:52,137
you know, uh,
reinvent myself.

284
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:54,005
So you
didn't bring me here

285
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:56,308
to get me drunk, naked,
and X-rated?

286
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,811
Unfortunately, no.
Um...

287
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,513
The first year of the program,
you know,

288
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,782
you have to lock the booze away,
put the booty on layaway.

289
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,917
Good.

290
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:07,218
I have
such a terrible habit

291
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:08,720
of just jumping
into bed with guys

292
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:12,290
and having wild,
orgazmo, toe-curling,

293
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:15,627
make-you-want-to-cry sex.

294
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:18,963
Frankly, I'm relieved.
To being friends.

295
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,032
Amigos.

296
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,369
So, why <i>are</i> we here?

297
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:26,971
First of all,
I just wanted to apologize

298
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,640
for overreacting
at the shoot.

299
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,141
I have a certain persona,

300
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,911
and I know that you were
just rolling with that.

301
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:35,880
But I'm trying to get rid of
the myth of T.K. the terrible,

302
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:37,282
you know?

303
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,319
Emerge from the chrysalis
a new butterfly, if you will.

304
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:42,787
Oh, right.

305
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:46,091
Well, I'm trying to emerge
from the hot mess of this

306
00:14:46,158 --> 00:14:48,593
to the triumphant
team owner.

307
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:51,029
Prove to the old guys
that I can do it.

308
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:55,467
Tell you what --
you support my metamorphosis,

309
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:56,835
I'll support yours,

310
00:14:56,902 --> 00:15:00,839
to the team and anybody else
who dares question you.

311
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:02,741
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine?

312
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:05,877
All those hard-to-reach places.
But with clothes on.

313
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:14,652
♪ You taste like

314
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,788
♪ bitter sugar

315
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,059
♪ We're doing all right

316
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:27,866
♪ just like bitter suga-a-a-r

317
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:30,001
come on!

Are you
trying to seduce me?

00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:32,954
I-I hadn't thought of it.

Oh!

00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:49,403
You know
this isn't a sex dream, right?

356
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:52,907
I do know,
and I don't care.

357
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:00,114
What's happening right now

358
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:03,584
between the two of you
is not about sex.

359
00:18:03,652 --> 00:18:05,186
It won't be
if you keep interrupting.

360
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:10,424
My point is...

361
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:12,760
there's more meaning
behind this whole thing.

362
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:15,263
Why?
Why can't I just have fun?

363
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,764
Why does everything
have to mean something?

364
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:21,435
Why can't my sex dream
just be about sex?!

365
00:18:24,673 --> 00:18:26,641
Fine.

366
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,143
What's it about?

367
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:34,715
About wanting
what you can't have.

368
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:39,774
Ooh! No, no, no, no, no!
Don't go!

369
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:41,689
That doesn't mean go!
No!

370
00:18:41,757 --> 00:18:43,691
I...

371
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,126
Okay.

372
00:18:45,194 --> 00:18:48,763
But...where'd everybody go?

373
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:53,301
How am I supposed to
have a sex dream with no sex?!

374
00:18:53,368 --> 00:18:55,770
O-o-okay,
so in the latest dream,

375
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:58,539
the sex was with Matt
in "The Graduate."

376
00:18:58,607 --> 00:18:59,807
No. No, no, no.

377
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:04,245
It -- it was still
with Nico, but...

378
00:19:04,313 --> 00:19:06,280
that's the point.

379
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:09,750
I...was Mrs. Robinson, and Nico
represented what I can't have,

380
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:12,420
or shouldn't have.

381
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:13,621
And Matt...

382
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:17,024
Well, I can't have Matt
anymore anyway.

383
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:19,860
Or shouldn't have,
right?

384
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:21,662
It was Matt who told you

385
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,865
this was about wanting
what you can't have, correct?

386
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:27,134
Damn it!

387
00:19:27,202 --> 00:19:29,937
And since you are
the author of your dreams,

388
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:31,472
who did Matt represent?

389
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,175
Me.

390
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:39,013
So you think it's all about
wanting what you can't have.

391
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:44,885
So, Danielle, what is it
you feel you can't have?

392
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,028
Break!
Break! Break!

393
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:57,064
Hello, coach.

394
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:59,467
Hey.

395
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:00,768
Um, so, I've made a decision,
and I would like...

396
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:02,503
First you take my advice,

397
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:04,505
then you take
credit for my advice,

398
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:06,274
and then
you take my spotlight.

399
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:08,409
Got to learn
how to give, son.

400
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:10,511
You give,
and you shall receive.

401
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:11,679
Well, seeing as that

402
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:13,481
I'm the number-one receiver
on this team,

403
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:15,516
I don't think
I'm the one that needs lessons.

404
00:20:16,618 --> 00:20:18,653
Thank you.

405
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,821
First-team offense,
let's go!

406
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:23,424
Not you, son.

407
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:25,192
Uh,
I need T.K. out there.

408
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,994
Uh, what the hell?

409
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:30,431
Our illustrious owner
has moved T.K. to number one.

410
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:36,237
All right, come on, come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

411
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:40,174
Hey, Mr. Harper.

412
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:42,343
Yeah, this is Ray Jay Santino
here from Hawks Cares.

413
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:43,544
How you doing today?

414
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:45,012
Yeah, I'm doing well,
thank you.

415
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,681
Yeah, we were
just hoping to count on you

416
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:49,116
to match last year's
donation of $1,000.

417
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:53,454
Mr. Harper?

418
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:55,523
Hello, Ray Jay.

419
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,658
You enjoying the job?

420
00:20:57,726 --> 00:21:00,161
My mom sent you here
to check up on me, didn't she?

421
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:02,596
What should I tell her?

422
00:21:02,664 --> 00:21:05,099
Tell her
everything's going great

423
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:07,568
and that I have
a real future here.

424
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:12,039
And that
Juliette's teaching me

425
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:13,941
a ton of things
that I didn't know about.

426
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,446
Yeah,
leave out that last part.

427
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:21,048

There's all types of myths
about it --

432
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,004
that you wouldn't
play it live

433
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:46,974
because it was
about David's ex-fiancée.

434
00:21:47,042 --> 00:21:47,942
Which one?

435
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,176

Whoa,
I didn't have a problem.

437
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:53,581
I did drugs,
like every other rocker, um,

438
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:56,450
including
someone else in this room,

439

who's suddenly
a freaking monk.

I'm not a monk.

441

I'm a parent with
responsibilities now, David.

442
00:22:01,456 --> 00:22:02,823
I'm sorry
if that pisses you off!

443
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:05,426
David...uh,

444
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:08,829
this was the only song
that you wrote solo, right?

445
00:22:08,897 --> 00:22:11,532
You really are a fan.

446
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,502
Tell me
what this song's about.

447
00:22:16,304 --> 00:22:19,173
It's about Willa, my wife.

448
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,708
Ah.

449
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:23,043
Paul, brother,
we've been over this.

450
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:25,379
It's not about her,
you narcissistic --

451
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:26,614
Me?!

452
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:28,182
You haven't changed
since you were 17!

453
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,383
When are
you gonna grow up?!

454
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:32,720
So I can be a...
soccer dad like you?!

455
00:22:32,788 --> 00:22:34,688
Uh,
sport some sweet Dockers

456
00:22:34,756 --> 00:22:37,992
and maybe do a little backyard
composting with the kids?!

457
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,260
Okay, hey, guys.

458
00:22:39,327 --> 00:22:42,029
No amount of money
is worth this.

459
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:45,566
Uh, so, are you gonna bail
like you did the first time?

460
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:48,202
I didn't
bail on the band!

461
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,703
You gave me no choice!

462
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:52,106
You were high and drunk
all the time,

463
00:22:52,174 --> 00:22:54,241
and we couldn't write a song
to save our lives!

464
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:58,145
So I decided to save my life
and get out before it got sad.

465
00:22:58,213 --> 00:23:01,148
But you know what?

466
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:02,850
It got sad anyway.

467
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:12,293
What did you do --
clean her dog's dingleberries?

468
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
With tweezers.

469
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:15,095
You know,
I didn't know I had to

470
00:23:15,163 --> 00:23:17,231
learn how to play football
on a mattress.

471
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:20,100
Oh, wow.

472
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:22,470
You might need to
learn how to play football,

473
00:23:22,537 --> 00:23:23,871
period, there,
turf toe.

474
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:25,673
'Cause then you could see
that speed is deadly.

475
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,740
Check this out.

476
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:31,445
So fast, you didn't see me
bitch-slap you.

477
00:23:31,513 --> 00:23:33,754
Spin it however you want.
We all know you didn't earn it.

478
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:39,453
You can't just switch positions
like you're changing clothes.

479
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:42,156
It undermines front office
and coaching staff.

480
00:23:42,224 --> 00:23:44,124
Not to mention
it damages team morale.

481
00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:46,560
Especially when you
do it on the field, publicly.

482
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:50,097
Look,
we'd respectfully ask you

483
00:23:50,165 --> 00:23:52,900
not to mingle
with the personnel.

484
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:54,702
They're <i>my</i> personnel.

485
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:57,571
I will mingle with them
however I see fit.

486
00:23:57,639 --> 00:24:00,341
I own this team.

487
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:02,810
I'm sorry if you don't agree
with my decisions.

488
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:06,247
Perhaps this isn't the place
for you --

489
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:08,148
any of you.

490
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:16,957
Compassion, was it?

491
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:17,680
Yeah.

492
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:19,292
Yeah, maybe she
just needs a hug.

493
00:24:38,013 --> 00:24:40,548
"I keep looking for my life.

494
00:24:40,615 --> 00:24:43,984
In my eyes,
it has been stolen."

495
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:47,388
David.

496
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:52,226
What is it that you think
was stolen from you?

497
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:56,130
Okay.

498
00:24:56,197 --> 00:24:59,300
You want real?

499
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:01,068
Here it is.

500
00:25:01,136 --> 00:25:03,771
The song isn't about Willa,
his wife.

501
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:04,972
It's about his son,
Dillon.

502
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:09,977
Except...

503
00:25:10,045 --> 00:25:12,813
I think Dillon's my son.

504
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:16,717
I didn't want to
destroy their happiness,

505
00:25:16,785 --> 00:25:18,852
so I never said a word.

506
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,857
And yet,
every day since...

507
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:26,527
you have destroyed
your own.

508
00:25:26,595 --> 00:25:30,197
You're not surprised
by any of this?

509
00:25:35,103 --> 00:25:38,138
One thing
I can tell you...

510
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:41,942
Paul sure as hell will be
when I finally tell him.

511
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:56,814
Oh! T.K.!

512
00:25:56,882 --> 00:25:59,550
You made it!

513
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,855
Listen, uh,
you didn't return my texts.

514
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:05,156
What --
I hit you back.

515
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:06,591
To tell me
to meet you at a bar,

516
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:08,726
which is the last place
I'm trying to be right now.

517
00:26:08,794 --> 00:26:10,294
Okay, you can't keep
doing what you're doing

518
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:13,364
because my team thinks
I'm kissing your ass.

519
00:26:13,432 --> 00:26:14,832
And what's wrong
with that?

520
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,235
You got what you wanted, right?
Back on the field.

521
00:26:17,302 --> 00:26:19,070
I want it the right way.

522
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:20,972
Hard work
is so overrated.

523
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,273
Maybe for you,

524
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:23,875
but I wasn't born with
a silver spoon in my mouth.

525
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:26,611
I'm just trying to get you
to relax, have some fun.

526
00:26:26,678 --> 00:26:30,148
I'm having fun!
I'm -- this is me having fun.

527
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,883
I'm the conductor
on the fun train.

528
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,217
Whoo-whoo!

529
00:26:33,285 --> 00:26:34,786
Uh-huh. Right, T.K.

530
00:26:34,853 --> 00:26:38,089
Do you want some advice
from someone who's been there?

531
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:40,158
I know you're trying to
change your image,

532
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:43,895
but don't throw the old T.K.
out with the bathwater.

533
00:26:43,962 --> 00:26:48,699
You are a extremely dynamic
and...

534
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:49,901
Really sexy.

535
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:51,536
...really sexy man.

536
00:26:53,138 --> 00:26:56,107
And you don't want to trade
that in for a lesser model.

537
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:58,976
Just fine-tune it a bit.

538
00:26:59,044 --> 00:27:00,778
Rotate the tires.

539
00:27:00,846 --> 00:27:02,680
Put a little oil
in your engine.

540
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:03,915
Vroom!

541
00:27:03,982 --> 00:27:05,850
And take your foot
off the emergency brake.

542
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:07,919
You're like me, T.K. --
passionate, intense.

543
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:09,921
If we don't
blow off some steam,

544
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:11,589
we'll go
insane in the membrane.

545
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:14,992
You know what --
screw it, yeah.

546
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,495
Who wants to
do shots off my abs?

547
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,632
Whoo! It's spring break
up in here! Yeah, yeah!

548
00:27:23,735 --> 00:27:27,472
I know you think
this song is about Willa and me.

549
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:32,977
But...it isn't.

550
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:42,286
I think Dillon is mine.

551
00:27:42,354 --> 00:27:45,456
No. He's not.

552
00:27:45,524 --> 00:27:47,925
Dude.

553
00:27:47,993 --> 00:27:50,094
I know it must be hard
for you to hear,

554
00:27:50,162 --> 00:27:53,564
but basic math tells me --
David.

555
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:56,000
You're right.
Dillon is not my son.

556
00:27:56,068 --> 00:27:58,836
But he's not yours,
either.

557
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,714
You know, I knew you
slept with Willa, so I checked.

558
00:28:03,302 --> 00:28:05,737
I did an online DNA test.

559
00:28:05,804 --> 00:28:07,572
It wasn't hard.
You're like a big damn dog.

560
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,841
You shed your hair
all over the place.

561
00:28:11,577 --> 00:28:14,078
Then whose son is he?

562
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:18,082
Some roadie.
He split.

563
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,551
Look, I raised him.
I'm his dad.

564
00:28:23,689 --> 00:28:27,525
So...

565
00:28:27,593 --> 00:28:30,828
where do we go from here,
gentlemen?

566
00:28:33,866 --> 00:28:36,067
This is basural.

567
00:28:36,135 --> 00:28:37,402
I'm cleaner
than a Brazilian bikini wax.

568
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:39,470
Well, then,
it shouldn't be a problem.

569
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:41,239
It's a problem
'cause I'm offended.

570
00:28:41,306 --> 00:28:42,707
Were you out partying
last night?

571
00:28:42,775 --> 00:28:44,008
Somebody told you that?

572
00:28:44,076 --> 00:28:45,209
Were you or were you not

573
00:28:45,277 --> 00:28:46,844
out in a club
with Juliette Pittman?

574
00:28:46,912 --> 00:28:48,146
Juliette Pittman
told you that?

575
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:49,414
It wasn't Juliette.

576
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:53,818
This foot-fungus-having
mother...

577
00:28:53,886 --> 00:28:55,987
Toes is a liar!

578
00:28:56,055 --> 00:28:57,288
Well, then,
take the test,

579
00:28:57,356 --> 00:29:00,191
which you're contractually
obligated to do.

580
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:02,226
Take it. Pass it.
Let's get out of here.

581
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,634
You shouldn't listen to rumors,
Matty "D."

582
00:29:09,702 --> 00:29:12,437
Come on.

583
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:13,838
Rumors
can be helpful, "T."

584
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:15,747
Lets you know what's going on
behind your back.

585
00:29:20,145 --> 00:29:22,313
You got something to ask me,
Matt?

586
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:24,949
You have something
to tell me, Nico?

587
00:29:25,017 --> 00:29:27,285
No.

588
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:36,027
Hey.
Is David here?

589
00:29:36,094 --> 00:29:37,228
No. Come in.

590
00:29:37,296 --> 00:29:39,016
He didn't
show up for sound check.

591
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:41,332
Concert's tomorrow.
I have no idea where the guy is.

592
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,835
What happened
after you left here?

593
00:29:43,902 --> 00:29:45,937
He got real quiet.
Didn't want to talk.

594
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:47,638
So I-I just let it be.

595
00:29:47,706 --> 00:29:51,209
And then an hour ago,
get this message.

596
00:29:51,276 --> 00:29:55,012
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>
<i>How's it going?</i>

597
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,647
<i>Personally,</i>
<i>I'm going to hell.</i>

598
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,318
<i>Don't think</i>
<i>I'll make it over.</i>

599
00:30:00,385 --> 00:30:03,554
<i>I just want you to know</i>
<i>I'm sorry, Paul.</i>

600
00:30:03,622 --> 00:30:06,123
<i>I'm so damn sorry.</i>

601
00:30:08,026 --> 00:30:11,262
He's never done that before --
apologized.

602
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,763
Do you have
a way of tracking him down?

603
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,801
Let's start with the obvious.
Come on.

604
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:22,006
What's up, Terrence?

605
00:30:22,074 --> 00:30:23,975
You have a good time
last night, bro?

606
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:25,810
You scared?

607
00:30:25,878 --> 00:30:28,279
What -- of you?
Hmm?

608
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:30,514
That's why you snitched.

609
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:32,783
This isn't the hood, T.K.
I didn't snitch.

610
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:36,387
I went to the management about
a concern regarding a co-worker.

611
00:30:36,455 --> 00:30:38,022
Just being a gentleman.

612
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,357
No,
you're being a liar.

613
00:30:39,424 --> 00:30:42,560
Ah, see, if you see
an addict falling off the wagon,

614
00:30:42,628 --> 00:30:44,028
it's not really lying.

615
00:30:44,096 --> 00:30:45,396
It is when you know

616
00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:48,165
I didn't touch a sip of alcohol
last night.

617
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:49,433
Look, I get it.

618
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:51,969
Being an addict,
that is not your fault.

619
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:54,005
It's --
it's hereditary, right?

620
00:30:54,072 --> 00:30:57,775
So, we should just blame
your crackhead mama.

621
00:30:58,911 --> 00:31:01,646
Oh, man, don't be mad at me,
T.K.

622
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:04,682
Be mad at your mama, man!

623
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,617
She the one that left your ass
in the trash!

624
00:31:14,192 --> 00:31:16,594
Stay by the car,
and I'll check inside.

625
00:31:17,863 --> 00:31:20,164
Yo!
Jesus.

626
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:23,567
Did somebody lose
a middle-aged rock star?

627
00:31:23,635 --> 00:31:25,636
Come on, man!

628
00:31:25,704 --> 00:31:27,905
It's gonna be all right.
Just come down.

629
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:38,849
Whoopsie!

630
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:41,352
Whoo!

631
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,553
That would have hurt.

632
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:44,755
David, look,
I know you're upset.

633
00:31:44,823 --> 00:31:46,724
Just come down,
and let's talk.

634
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:49,660
Less talk,
more rock, baby.

635
00:31:49,728 --> 00:31:50,661
Whoa!

636
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:52,096
Come on, buddy.

637
00:31:52,164 --> 00:31:53,864
Just --
just come on down.

638
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:03,441
Okay.

639
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:06,010
I'm coming down.

640
00:32:12,684 --> 00:32:13,617
Oh, my God!

641
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:18,443
Oh, crap. That hurts.

642
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:20,012
Ohh!
You crazy son of a bitch!

643
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:21,747
I thought
you were dead.

644
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,983
Unfortunately, no.

645
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:28,887
That --
that was a bad idea.

646
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:31,223
Not your first one.

647
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,571
Don't move, okay, because you
might have broken something.

648
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:35,827
Go call 911.
I'm fine.

649
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:37,829
Oh, oh, oh.
Sort of.

650
00:32:37,897 --> 00:32:41,299
David,
what were you thinking?

651
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:45,570
I wanted to...to go out
in a David Blaize of glory,

652
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:50,475
like Hendrix and Morrison
and Joplin.

653
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:55,380
I can't
even do that right.

654
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:02,988
All these years...

655
00:33:03,056 --> 00:33:06,091
I told myself
this story --

656
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,195
that Dillon was <i>my</i> kid,
that Paul stole <i>my</i> life.

657
00:33:10,263 --> 00:33:14,166
Thinking
I had a kid out there

658
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:19,071
made me feel
like I had something.

659
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:23,041
After all these years,
I got nothing.

660
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:28,814
But, David,
you are still wildly talented.

661
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:33,618
You are still
filled with possibilities.

662
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:37,456
And it's time for you
to invest in that story.

663
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,095
Paramedics
are on their way.

664
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:44,930
I'm fine.

665
00:33:44,997 --> 00:33:46,498
Oh, oh, oh.

666
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,201
Yeah, maybe I should
kick your ass!

667
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:50,702
You scared
the hell out of me!

668
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,673
You couldn't kick my ass
if you tried.

669
00:33:56,342 --> 00:33:57,943
I can and I have.

670
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,012
Senior year -- after prom.

671
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,048
That whole thing
with Deb Florentine.

672
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:05,550
Oh, yeah, she was wearing
that smoking-hot dress.

673
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:07,853
Yeah,
she was also my date.

674
00:34:09,856 --> 00:34:11,690
You're such
a son of a bitch.

675
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:12,757
I know.

676
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:16,061
I know.

677
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,468
I know.

678
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:36,281
Matt, please,
please take me with you.

679
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:37,616
No.

680
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:40,685
I'm going to my office,
where I can find some peace.

681
00:34:40,753 --> 00:34:43,622
Can't you understand that?
No!

682
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:45,323
I only know
that I love you!

683
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:46,925
Well,
that's your problem.

684
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,196
Matt, Matt!

685
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:58,069
But, Matt,
where will I go?

686
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,172
What will I do?

687
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,574
Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn.

688
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:14,719
My dreams --
they're all movie reenactments.

689
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:16,988
What the heck
is that about?

690
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:20,692
Um, you know, movies
are the modern-day myth.

691
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:25,263
They're the campfires we gather
around to pass along legends.

692
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,699
But tell me this.

693
00:35:27,766 --> 00:35:31,369
What do these particular movies
all have in common --

694
00:35:31,437 --> 00:35:35,406
"Titanic," "Graduate,"
"Gone With the Wind"?

695
00:35:35,474 --> 00:35:39,844
They're all...
love stories.

696
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:42,447
Yeah, and?

697
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:47,118
They're all
tragic love stories.

698
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:52,690
So, Danielle, do you believe
in happily ever after?

699
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:55,026
For me?

700
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:03,868
I'm not so sure.

701
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:08,573
What the hell happened
to the serenity prayer?

702
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:11,843
I had the courage
to rearrange Toe's face.

703
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,712
Serious question.

704
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,182
How many chances do you
expect me to keep giving you?

705
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,450
Look, I'm sorry --

706
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:20,798
Yeah, you sure
as hell are sorry.

707
00:36:22,488 --> 00:36:25,590
Toes calls my mother
a crack whore.

708
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,762
I'm just supposed to
smile and take that?

709
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:32,697
You punched him
in the face.

710
00:36:32,765 --> 00:36:35,466
You know,
if you want people

711
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:37,769
to stop treating you
like a problem child,

712
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:39,771
stop causing problems.

713
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:41,806
And stop being a child.

714
00:36:41,874 --> 00:36:43,708
Then where would I be?

715
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:45,543
You'd be
playing this Sunday!

716
00:36:45,611 --> 00:36:49,914
Instead,
you're benched, again.

717
00:36:49,982 --> 00:36:54,218
I see it really doesn't matter
what I say or what I do.

718
00:36:54,286 --> 00:36:58,423
You're just gonna keep seeing me
for the person that I was,

719
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:02,393
not the guy I'm trying
really hard to be.

720
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,914
What are we celebrating?

721
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:24,015
Tuesday.

722
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:26,217
Oh.
Oh.

723
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,119
I feel a lecture
coming on.

724
00:37:28,187 --> 00:37:29,654
I'm gonna be brief.

725
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:31,889
Yes.
Definitely a lecture.

726
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:34,125
Just a little something
about your dad --

727
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:36,260
the uber-competitive
Marshall Pittman.

728
00:37:36,328 --> 00:37:40,665
It didn't matter whether
he was watching or playing,

729
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,166
he loved games.

730
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:43,601
More than humans.

731
00:37:43,669 --> 00:37:46,771
Perhaps, but what
he came to realize was...

732
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:49,974
Football may be a game,
but managing people --

733
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:52,710
real people --
that definitely is not.

734
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:55,747
Is this about T.K.
going Ali on Toes?

735
00:37:55,814 --> 00:37:58,116
Look, football players
need aggression.

736
00:37:58,183 --> 00:38:00,051
Happy players
don't win games.

737
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,621
Juliette, if you want to
destroy your own life,

738
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:05,289
that's your choice.

739
00:38:05,357 --> 00:38:10,128
But being the owner of a team,
people depend on you.

740
00:38:10,195 --> 00:38:13,297
You think about that
next time you make a decision.

741
00:38:13,365 --> 00:38:14,732
Think hard.

742
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,501
What's that
supposed to mean?

743
00:38:16,568 --> 00:38:20,338
Grow up.

744
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:23,875
You're not my father,
Nico!

745
00:38:23,942 --> 00:38:27,879
All these years --
acting like my great protector.

746
00:38:27,946 --> 00:38:29,814
I know
about you and my mother.

747
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:39,490
I had a very complicated
relationship with your parents.

748
00:38:39,558 --> 00:38:43,227
I cared about both of them.

749
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:45,329
And I care
very much about you.

750
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:46,998
Now you work for me.

751
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,835
Maybe you need to
think hard about that.

752
00:38:57,653 --> 00:38:59,323
Hey, whose ready to rock!

753
00:38:59,848 --> 00:39:01,305
You want to come out there
with us -- sing some backup?

754
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:01,779
Oh!

755
00:39:01,784 --> 00:39:02,984
You clearly
know all the songs.

756
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:04,419
You guys don't
want to hear me sing.

757
00:39:05,788 --> 00:39:07,088
Dude,
you smell like whiskey.

758
00:39:07,156 --> 00:39:09,691
Cologne, man!

759
00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:12,961
Okay, one drink.
One.

760
00:39:13,029 --> 00:39:16,531
Rome wasn't
built in a day.

761
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:19,034
Shall we rock the house,
my good man?

762
00:39:19,101 --> 00:39:20,902
We shall!

763
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,472

said that he was working late,

He is...working late.

776
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:37,912
So I don't have
anything to worry about?

777
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,582
I didn't say that.

He has a crush on her.

779
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:48,623
But does she have
a crush on him back?

780
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:50,692
Only in his dreams.

781
