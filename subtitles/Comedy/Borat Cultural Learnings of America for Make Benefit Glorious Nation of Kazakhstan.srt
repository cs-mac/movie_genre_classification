00:00:07,646 --> 00:00:09,745
<i>Episode 32</i>
 Dear reporters: As you all know,

2
00:00:09,746 --> 00:00:14,495
my husband and I first met three years ago
without knowing each other's backgrounds.

3
00:00:14,496 --> 00:00:18,425
Aside from my husband,

4
00:00:18,426 --> 00:00:20,956
I have never been in a serious
relationship with anyone, and...

5
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:31,216
- What is that?- Oh?

6
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:35,916
Oh, wow! What is that?

7
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:41,935
<i>I, Jin Hyeong Woo, take
Kang Il Joo as my wife.</i>

8
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:45,765
<i>For this long life, no
matter what storms may come,</i>

9
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:48,995
<i>I'll be a husband who
will take care of you.</i>

10
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:54,145
<i>I, Kang Il Joo, take Jin
Hyeong Woo as my husband.</i>

11
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:58,016
<i>For this long life; no matter how painful
and thorny the path may be to walk on,</i>

12
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:02,426
<i>I will be a wife that won't leave you.</i>

13
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,956
<i>Until death do us apart,</i>

14
00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:10,276
<i>we will walk the same path.</i>

15
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:18,196
<i>Like today's oath, our love will
be constant and be eternal.</i>

16
00:01:25,646 --> 00:01:29,246
- What's going on?
- What kind of situation is this?

17
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:41,225
Assemblywoman? Ma'am?

18
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,596
<i>The reporters will not be coming.</i>

19
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:47,755
<i>You're really disappointing me.</i>

20
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:49,815
<i>I didn't know you would
only amount to this much.</i>

21
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:54,285
<i>If I didn't do it this way, then you would
never have given me your permission.</i>

22
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:55,966
<i>Il Joo.</i>

23
00:01:56,496 --> 00:02:00,535
<i>You know how determined I am, so
please return Hyeong Woo to me.</i>

24
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:03,765
<i>I've already set the date for your
marriage with Executive Director Kwon.</i>

25
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:07,095
<i>Do you want me to turn Korea's
strongest media outlet into my enemy?</i>

26
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:10,035
<i>It has always been your enemy.</i>

27
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:12,355
<i>That marriage goes against my wishes.</i>

28
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:14,765
<i>What I need is Hyeong Woo, not
a media publication company.</i>

29
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,315
<i>What you need is the media outlet.</i>

30
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:19,955
<i>You know what I'm trying to make of you.</i>

31
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:22,875
<i>To that end, I even threw
your brother away.</i>

32
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:26,046
<i>Even if that may be the
reason you abandoned my mom,</i>

33
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:31,435
<i>I'm different. I'm going to
have both power and Hyeong Woo.</i>

34
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:34,045
<i>In my 40 years in politics,</i>

35
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:37,266
<i>how many people do you think I've seen die?</i>

36
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:43,906
<i>Sometimes, politics can bring
slaughter to the innocent.</i>

37
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:52,505
Assemblywoman. Would you mind explaining?
What is this video?

38
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,565
Where did Prime Minister Kang
Seok Hyeon take Jin Hyeong Woo?

39
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:59,386
Why did you abandon Jin Hyeong Woo
and choose your current husband?

40
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:04,236
Please clarify, you're the one who
called this press conference.

41
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:08,616
I'm finished for today.

42
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:14,016
- Assemblywoman!- Assemblywoman!

43
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:16,996
Assemblywoman!

44
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,485
Was someone filming at that time?

45
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:27,766
No, no one but the two people
was inside the church.

46
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:32,636
I think Jin Hyeong Woo had
installed a hidden camera.

47
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:36,266
Jin Hyeong Woo, you bastard...

48
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:42,476
Check with the broadcast station

49
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:47,105
to see if he was the one who gave them
the video or if it was someone else.

50
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:48,886
Yes, Sir.

51
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:10,256
You're Aide Jin Hyeong Woo, right?

52
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:17,345
- Did you happen to see our
broadcast today?- Yes.

53
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:19,605
What happened with
Assemblywoman Kang Il Joo?

54
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:23,275
You two were planning to marry but separated
due to Prime Minister Kang's objection, right?

55
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:26,055
Is that why you broke the
news of the slush fund?

56
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:30,676
No comment. That incident is already over.

57
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,696
Mr. Jin Hyeong Woo, for the courtesy
of informing the public, please...

58
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:37,126
- Jin Hyeong Woo!- Please say something!

59
00:04:57,586 --> 00:04:59,626
My dear, are you okay?

60
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:03,125
Jin Hyeong Woo, that bastard
who is worse than a dog!

61
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:06,025
Call him and tell him to clarify.

62
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:10,115
Well, he was the one who
reported that video,

63
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:12,795
so there's no way he would take your side.

64
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:16,546
Why receive this type of treatment from
some trash that you know from the past?

65
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:26,185
Don't worry.

66
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:30,086
It's a relief that you know
his true character now.

67
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:38,436
I'll reattach your wings for you.

68
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:42,866
I'll punish that damned person

69
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:46,586
and allow you to fly higher.

70
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:56,655
<i>It seems that Jin Hyeong Woo</i>

71
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:01,025
<i>deceived Assemblywoman Kang Il Joo and installed
a hidden camera due to his political ambition.</i>

72
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:03,445
<i>However, as his corrupt deeds</i>

73
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,665
<i>were discovered by Prime Minister
Kang and he was kicked out,</i>

74
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,425
<i>that's why he decided to
expose this story shamelessly.</i>

75
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:13,285
<i>To even exploit someone's love
story with a hidden camera...</i>

76
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:17,816
<i>This is tantamount to a "character
assassination or a [murder]."</i>

77
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:27,195
You did well. With this, Jin Hyeong Woo won't
be able to hold his head up in front of people,

78
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:30,375
and my wife will receive sympathy votes.

79
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:32,156
Thank you.

80
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:43,215
Did you see the broadcast?

81
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:46,076
Turn JBS on right now, quickly.

82
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:58,385
<i>Then are you saying you didn't
know about that video either?</i>

83
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:00,495
<i>That's right.</i>

84
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:02,865
Since you saw the video, you may know

85
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:07,665
that I called a reporter to
publicize that marriage.

86
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:11,855
However, Prime Minister Kang
blocked that reporter from coming.

87
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:14,885
Then who could have recorded that video?

88
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:21,565
I don't know. I've tried to think who it
could be as well, but I just have no clue.

89
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:25,556
I want to ask JBS.

90
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,025
From whom did you obtain that video?

91
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:30,355
I'm not at liberty to
discuss that with you.

92
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:32,785
Just as it was shown on
the blank TV station,

93
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:37,725
does this breaking story have anything to do with
the Prime Minster's Kang's possible slush fund?

94
00:07:37,726 --> 00:07:42,735
The tip-off about the slush fund has absolutely
nothing to do with Assemblywoman Kang.

95
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:45,715
<i>As I managed the Eun
Gang Foundation's fund,</i>

96
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,506
<i>my conscience felt guilty.</i>

97
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:51,486
<i>Is ₩100 billion a small amount of money?</i>

98
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:56,585
<i>It's something he stole by using his
power to threaten innocent companies.</i>

99
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:58,925
<i>From what I know, they may be served with
a subpoena for a full investigation.</i>

100
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:03,425
<i>Because I believe that the law has to be
fair for everyone with justice for all.</i>

101
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:05,605
<i>Why indict someone without an arrest warrant? Under law, even
if charged, he has the right to contact his defense attorney.</i>

102
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:10,485
<i>Are you still going to indict a commoner (the general public)
without due process, if he illegally steals $100 million?</i>

103
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:12,315
<i>Let me ask you one last thing,</i>

104
00:08:12,316 --> 00:08:15,455
<i>what do you think about
Assemblywoman Kang Il Joo?</i>

105
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:19,785
<i>She abandoned you and married the
son of a powerful media outlet.</i>

106
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:22,985
I understand Assemblywoman Kang

107
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:25,195
and I was the one who
told her to marry him.

108
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:27,025
You did so yourself?

109
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:28,376
Yes.

110
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:34,796
In political and human terms, Assemblywoman
Kang is an outstanding individual.

111
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:38,125
She is not someone whom I can
dare to criticize or scrutinize.

112
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:41,846
She loved me wholeheartedly.

113
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:46,836
<i>I'm terribly worried that Assemblywoman Kang's
political career will be hurt because of me.</i>

114
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:53,876
Although I don't know who revealed this
personal incident at this time or why,

115
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:58,646
I'll make an earnest appeal to people
who are watching this broadcast.

116
00:08:58,696 --> 00:09:04,796
Kang Il Joo is a more amazing
politician than anyone else I know.

117
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:08,476
She's someone who has love and a vision.

118
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:11,866
Please cherish her.

119
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,785
What sh♪t is he saying?

120
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:16,435
Why did you turn it off? It isn't over yet.

121
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:19,035
Do we really have to continue to
listen to such shameless words?

122
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,265
He was the one who did this!

123
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:23,566
I don't think so.

124
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:32,736
You're really an unpredictable character.

125
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:38,885
Whoever revealed that video, it becomes revenge
against Kang Seok Hyeon if you just leave it alone.

126
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:41,686
Why did you do such an interview?

127
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:47,446
I also eat under your roof.

128
00:09:48,076 --> 00:09:51,295
I have no thought of creating
trouble for your daughter-in-law.

129
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:56,275
My grudge is against Kang
Seok Hyeon, not Kang Il Joo.

130
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:58,265
Do you really have such an innocent heart?

131
00:09:58,266 --> 00:09:59,645
What else could it be?

132
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:03,395
There is so such thing as
"innocence" in this world,

133
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:06,105
especially for people like us.

134
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,365
I don't care what you do

135
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:12,075
as long as you place the Blue
Beauty fund in my hands.

136
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:14,606
I already told you I would do that.

137
00:10:15,676 --> 00:10:18,715
Chairman, only money is your candid truth.

138
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:20,916
Jin Hyeong Woo, what are you planning?

139
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:27,145
You're not even a stalker, why
are you doing this again?

140
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:28,695
Don't deny it!

141
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:33,006
Did you think I wouldn't know you started
this and you're playing around with Il Joo?

142
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:36,636
Your life must be really difficult.

143
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:40,815
Suspecting people like that is a disease.

144
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:42,775
Your condition is quite serious,
you should go to a hospital.

145
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,905
Shut up and leave this house immediately!

146
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:49,095
Please leave my house. It's so
noisy whenever you come here.

147
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:49,906
Father!

148
00:10:49,907 --> 00:10:52,295
Do you think that your media
subordinates are your possessions?

149
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:55,815
You spent that news prime
time to diss Aide Jin?

150
00:10:55,816 --> 00:10:59,676
That's why our media outlet has
been ranked last in ethics!

151
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:07,025
What are you? Why are
you staring at Il Joo?

152
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:09,186
Aren't you going to move
your eyes somewhere else?

153
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:11,805
I don't want to.

154
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:13,325
This bastard...

155
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:14,735
Why are you acting so childish?

156
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:17,585
Are you taking that bastard's
side in front of me?

157
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:21,946
Please leave, you disgusting fellow.

158
00:11:27,006 --> 00:11:29,025
Yes, Father.

159
00:11:29,026 --> 00:11:30,706
Now?

160
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:33,775
You found out who circulated the video?

161
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:38,075
Ah, did you gather us
to reveal the culprit?

162
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:40,235
What kind of fearless bastard
did something like that?

163
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:43,746
It's not that he has the balls,
but rather is full of sh♪t!

164
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:47,036
It's none other than you.

165
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:48,695
It was you?

166
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:50,735
F-father, what are you talking about?

167
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:54,705
Why would I? I only found out afterward
that these two attempted to marry.

168
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:56,515
What nonsense...

169
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:00,006
Who the hell said I did it?
What bastard said that?

170
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:10,066
Secretary Kim was the one who handed the
USB file over to the broadcast station.

171
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:12,485
Where did you obtain that?

172
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:15,805
I heard it through the grapevine
at social drinking events.

173
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:21,185
Since, they're so big on keeping it
ultra-private, I'm not sure of the true identity.

174
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:26,135
In return, they said they would hand it
over as long as I matched their price.

175
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:31,345
You bastard! I bought it to protect Il Joo but you
betrayed me and handed it over to the broadcast station?

176
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:34,956
Just how much did you receive
from the broadcast station?!

177
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:42,035
Please forgive me.

178
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:46,945
However, this was due to my
loyalty to Vice President Kang.

179
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:50,765
Since you only politically
supported Assemblywoman Kang,

180
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:52,405
I didn't know what I was doing and...

181
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:53,895
Look, Father.

182
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:57,765
You don't honestly think I'm a narrow-minded
brother who'd rat out my younger sister, do you?

183
00:12:57,766 --> 00:12:59,955
Still, it seems you've kept
someone quite nice under you.

184
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:04,645
Politically, he made a
decision that you needed.

185
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:09,676
Anyway, she's your political opponent so
you should at least wield that sword.

186
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:17,345
Father. Actually, I was the one
who ordered this incident.

187
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:20,806
I'm the brain behind this.

188
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:23,756
Oops.

189
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:39,035
I, too, can be quite politically savvy. It's
only because you always favor her over me.

190
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:41,835
Family should be strength to each other,

191
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:43,265
does it feel good for you to tear me down?

192
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:45,405
Did I lie?

193
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:49,535
Every citizen has a right
to know the truth.

194
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:53,486
Even when you drove my wife's
child to the brink of death,

195
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:56,625
I just took it because I
thought I was partly to blame.

196
00:13:56,626 --> 00:14:00,405
That it is my karma.

197
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:06,646
However... if you cause a
disturbance in this house again,

198
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:09,896
you should be prepared to leave.

199
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:18,255
He calls whatever that wench Il
Joo does "political ability,"

200
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:23,246
but what? Everything I do lacks
ability, doesn't it? Damn it.

201
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,025
Stop drinking and go to bed.

202
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:28,845
If you cause a scene here, you'll
get marked by Father-in-Law again.

203
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:31,615
I'm going to drink in my own
house, so what's the problem?

204
00:14:31,616 --> 00:14:33,785
This is Father-in-Law's house.

205
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:37,455
Hey! This house has been occupied
since my maternal grandfather.

206
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:39,645
This is clearly my mom's house,

207
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:46,216
and if we argue about this with blood, my father who doesn't share
a drop of blood with me has no right to live in this house.

208
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,006
Why did you do that?

209
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:55,705
What are you talking about?

210
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:58,366
Even if he is the eldest son,

211
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:03,386
this incident was a huge blow to Il Joo.

212
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:08,385
I find Il Joo so pitiful.

213
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:10,975
I know that as well.

214
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:15,015
However, Il Do is also
part of my bloodline.

215
00:15:15,016 --> 00:15:17,576
I need to give him a last chance,

216
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:24,136
and this is also a test for Il Joo to
see how she overcomes this crisis.

217
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:32,265
<i>You, the type of person you are...</i>

218
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:38,046
<i>You seem pretty logical, yet you want to grasp
both of your bloodlines (both his children).</i>

219
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:42,345
Why? Do you not like it?

220
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:44,585
No.

221
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:48,915
No, Prime Minister. You're
always logical, Sir.

222
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,676
Thank you.

223
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:55,416
But why aren't you asking me

224
00:15:56,966 --> 00:16:01,675
about when I met Jin Hyeong Woo
the last time I left this house?

225
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:04,175
I don't think it's my place to ask.

226
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:07,105
He came to see me twice.

227
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:11,506
The first time, he asked me to
start over at a restaurant,

228
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:14,476
and the second time,

229
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:20,456
he was beside me when I
fainted because of Mi Rae.

230
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:26,636
When I said I was going to go
to you, he told me not to.

231
00:16:27,926 --> 00:16:32,775
But I still had to come here again.

232
00:16:32,776 --> 00:16:34,556
Why did you do that?

233
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:40,516
You probably felt resentful towards me, but Hyeong Woo
is still young and has a bright future ahead of him.

234
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:44,545
Did you do that because you
were worried about Mi Rae?

235
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,435
Or did you do that because you
wanted revenge on Il Joo?

236
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:49,436
Both of the reasons are wrong.

237
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:57,666
I came because I realized I like you a lot.

238
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,016
Hate appears because of love.

239
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:14,256
I'm truly grateful that
you came to seek me,

240
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,546
and I...

241
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:30,656
really love you a lot.

242
00:17:37,216 --> 00:17:39,656
I'm sorry,

243
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:43,806
and I'm thankful.

244
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:08,756
<i>Assemblywoman Kang Il Joo</i>

245
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:25,655
Why did you come here?

246
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:28,525
I was thinking that because of me,
you might lose the public's support.

247
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:29,965
I came because I was worried.

248
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:34,235
Still, you can't come here. What
will you do if someone sees?

249
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:36,636
That's why I came secretly at night.

250
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:43,476
I brought some files
that'll be of help to you.

251
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:48,925
<i>Jongno District File</i>

252

Please look over this very carefully.
Your district voters may be pleased.

253
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:01,996
Why are you doing this to me?

254
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,975
You have a grudge against my father,

255
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:11,386
so why do you keep helping me?

256
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,856
I already told you

257
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:20,075
that because I was deceived by
a woman named Shin Eun Soo,

258
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,426
I didn't know your worth.

259
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:27,105
You were the only one hurt because of me.

260
00:19:27,106 --> 00:19:31,526
Still, don't be like this. There'll
be trouble if my father finds out.

261
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,576
I know. So...

262
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:47,806
if you want to earn more of the
Prime Minister's trust, attack me.

263
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:54,896
The envelope contains recent files
on me and President Kwon Soo Myeong.

264
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:58,286
Reveal this to the newspapers tomorrow.

265
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:01,766
Then the Prime Minister will trust you.

You're okay, right? You can
overcome this well, right?

00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:08,346
Of course. I'm my father's daughter.

What, to receive only ₩5 billion of stock,

280
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:25,985
he stabbed my father in the back?
He's such a cheapskate.

281
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:29,866
Since he committed a crime, it's only
right that he should be punished.

282
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:33,605
I was shocked after seeing
Chairman Kwon's household.

283
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,975
The elder son and the younger son
were exempted from military service.

284
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:40,765
The granddaughter was accepted into an American college
with a special admission. The grandson was born overseas.

285
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,615
The mother and the daughter-in-law purchased
foreign real estate and evaded the tax.

286
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:46,245
You all are really quite the set.

287
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:48,795
I also heard from Ji Eun.

288
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:51,545
The reason for your military service exemption was "deficiency
in the ability to discriminate or to control his impulses."

289
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:53,825
If you have a weak mind, you don't
have to do military service?

290
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:58,716
Aunt, that is slightly related
to a person's mental state.

291
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:04,335
Oh my god! So in one word,
you're just a psycho.

292

doesn't choke you at night or anything?

293
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:13,906
Father-in-Law, you really went too far.

294
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:17,785
Of course you should attack Jin Hyeong Woo,

295
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:21,525
but getting to the bottom of
my family and me was too much.

296
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:24,485
I did my best for Il Joo
by using the media.

297

Don't argue about this with me,

00:22:49,726 --> 00:22:52,496
You are really deficient in ability.

304
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:57,986
I'm not sure if I'll be able to see you
get your head straight before I die.

305
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:08,005
Nothing will happen to Hyeong Woo, right?
I heard he was going to the prosecutors.

306
00:23:08,006 --> 00:23:12,195
By chance, did you show that
expression to Kang Seok Hyeon?

307
00:23:12,196 --> 00:23:17,195
No. But, as a response to the ₩100 billion,

308
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:21,365
Prime Minister is so firmly determined to get back
at him that I am worried this case will get bigger.

309
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:25,095
It seems you forgot Kwon Soo
Myeong is behind Hyeong Woo.

310
00:23:25,096 --> 00:23:27,435
He's holding onto him
because he has some use,

311
00:23:27,436 --> 00:23:32,595
and since nothing good will come to him if he's in the
prosecutor's office for long, he'll take him out immediately.

312
00:23:32,596 --> 00:23:37,016
Of course, Hyeong Woo was the one who
handed the files over to Il Joo.

313
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:41,555
He told her to attack him? Why?

314
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:46,716
You said yourself that Kang Seok
Hyeon gave Il Joo her final warning.

315
00:23:47,486 --> 00:23:53,226
"I'll put the Blue Beauty on the line as the condition
to make you President, so just cut Hyeong Woo out."

316
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:57,065
To separate those two people,

317
00:23:57,066 --> 00:24:01,185
Hyeong Woo is shaking Il Joo up right now.

318
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:06,066
Then, the clarification
interview the other day...

319
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:10,765
Is he saying he'll seduce her?

320
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:13,526
That's what you're doing right now.

321
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:26,806
<i>Hyeong Woo, how did we end up like this?</i>

322
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,116
Have you been well?

323
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:40,006
I called Hye Jeong and found out,

324
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:45,025
but your child...

325
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,786
She's undergoing treatment in
the hypothermia therapy unit.

326
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:57,076
Could you please give me some of your time?

327
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:01,276
I won't beat around the bush.

328
00:25:02,596 --> 00:25:07,735
The Little Madam was poor but she seduced
Vice President Lee, replaced his wife,

329
00:25:07,736 --> 00:25:09,865
and is now in that position.

330
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:13,105
Truthfully, you're in the same position,

331
00:25:13,106 --> 00:25:16,125
even though the Prime Minister was
the one who held out his hand first.

332
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:19,805
Yes, I've also stood all
day working at a market

333
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:23,096
as my legs swelled.

334
00:25:23,686 --> 00:25:28,115
I needed someone to save me
from that dreadful tunnel.

335
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:30,895
Please tell me the method too.

336
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:35,176
There's no reason I can't be
like the Little Madam too.

337
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:40,006
Well... the method?

338
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:44,405
Isn't sincerity the key to
all human relationships?

339
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:48,015
After seeing the news now, it seems Executive
Director Kwon will be having a difficult time.

340
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:52,735
On top of that, Il Joo isn't in a
relationship to console him or hug him.

341
00:25:52,736 --> 00:25:58,226
At times like these, shouldn't you
become the warmest person to him?

342
00:25:58,966 --> 00:26:05,766
Ah, right! If you want to create a chance for
conversation, having similar hobbies will be good.

343
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:45,225
You coming here for me, isn't it pointless?

344
00:26:45,226 --> 00:26:49,756
Truthfully, you're not supposed
to eat things like this.

345
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:53,105
If you like it, then so do I.

346
00:26:53,106 --> 00:26:57,975
However, is marketplace food that tasty?

347
00:26:57,976 --> 00:27:02,005
Yes. Whenever I come to the
marketplace, I feel alive

348
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:07,356
and I get hungry. This place feels
like a place where people live.

349
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:15,306
Why do you look at me like that?

350
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:18,415
I'm really sorry towards you.

351
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:19,685
Sorry for what?

352
00:27:19,686 --> 00:27:24,856
Those documents. That incident
happened because of me,

353
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,176
but I sided with Il Joo.

354
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:32,325
Your feelings must be badly hurt.

355
00:27:32,326 --> 00:27:34,895
You should stop talking about that now.

356
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:38,616
I've also wronged Il Joo and you.

357
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:44,365
Even in marketplaces like this, I didn't
come often outside of election season.

358
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:48,045
When I was young, I was the same as you.

359
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:51,775
You really make me embarrassed.

360
00:27:51,776 --> 00:27:57,206
Then we should come here often, and next
time we should also have a bottle of soju.

361
00:28:02,286 --> 00:28:05,455
<i>Nothing has been accomplished
without spilling blood.</i>

362
00:28:05,456 --> 00:28:09,906
<i>Lotus flowers also bloom in the mud.</i>

363
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:17,025
<i>What you shouldn't forget is that you must make
flowers bloom, no matter how and what you go through.</i>

364
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:21,705
<i>Whatever you have done</i>

365
00:28:21,706 --> 00:28:24,086
<i>to achieve your goal,</i>

366
00:28:25,526 --> 00:28:28,296
<i>even if you have killed someone,</i>

367
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:32,246
<i>I'll forgive you.</i>

368
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:38,796
<i>I won't believe in whatever you say</i>

369
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,056
<i>because I know your true self.</i>

370
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:46,055
It's really good.

371
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:47,896
Right?

372
00:29:51,596 --> 00:29:54,416
You look like you came here
to buy a present for Madame.

373
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:58,695
Men are usually embarrassed to
come into shops like these.

374
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,495
You're quite thoughtful.

375
00:30:00,496 --> 00:30:02,555
Il Joo doesn't like this type of style.

376
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:04,836
Oh my, why?

377
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:08,006
It's extravagant, sexy, and pretty.

378
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:12,835
She must not know that clothing
starts from the underwear.

379
00:30:12,836 --> 00:30:18,306
Of course. Rather than the
clothes revealed on the outside,

380
00:30:19,036 --> 00:30:22,985
clothing like this which
is hidden deep inside

381
00:30:22,986 --> 00:30:25,345
is the consideration for
you the one you love.

382
00:30:25,346 --> 00:30:30,356
Oh my, how can you think the same as me?

383
00:30:35,596 --> 00:30:38,245
I'll have to leave now as
I've got other things to do.

384
00:30:38,246 --> 00:30:41,076
Well, have fun shopping.

385
00:30:49,086 --> 00:30:51,316
Later on, if you happen...

386
00:30:53,456 --> 00:30:57,456
to get bored shopping by yourself
like this, give me a call.

387
00:31:08,886 --> 00:31:13,176
It's so nice to have a friend to
talk to when you're shopping.

388
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:22,776
<i>010-478-1379</i>

389
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:30,836
<i>Pawn (Subordinate)</i>

390
00:31:38,256 --> 00:31:39,825
Ta-da!

391
00:31:39,826 --> 00:31:44,405
Your subordinate soldier was in danger where she
was almost jailed. How could you ignore that?

392
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:48,675
How can I just get in contact with you now?
Captain, I'm really disappointed.

393
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:51,805
Sorry, sorry. I was busy.

394
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:54,776
That's why I prepared
something as an apology.

395
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:58,196
Ta-da!

396
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:05,995
This is... a limited edition. Wow!

397
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:10,085
How did you get this? Where did you buy it?

398
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:15,415
Ah, right. More importantly than
this, put some money in my account.

399
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,085
Money? Where are you going to spend it?

400
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:21,545
It's kind of a good deed and
an investment for the future.

401
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:25,976
I'll report everything to you later. You'll
give it to me, right? Right? Right? Right?

402
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:32,695
Okay! Do you think this Captain can't even do
that much for his one and only footsoldier?

403
00:32:32,696 --> 00:32:34,265
I'll deposit it right now!

404
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:38,595
As expected, you're the Captain! This has
returned our relationship back to normal.

405
00:32:38,596 --> 00:32:40,995
It's recovered 100%.

406
00:32:40,996 --> 00:32:42,575
Yay!

407
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:45,135
I said I'll repay it immediately!

408
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:47,765
Is there any way you can lend it?

409
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:52,545
I'm being like this because the house owner said she won't
ever extend the contract deadline for the security deposit.

410
00:32:52,546 --> 00:32:57,025
Jeong Soon's mom? I
already gave her a call!

411
00:32:57,026 --> 00:33:00,495
I got it, bye! I'm going crazy...

412
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:05,025
Mother! I'm coming in. Cold, cold.

413
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:08,386
What? Why are you here?

414
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:12,245
Hey! How can you wear your shoes inside?!

415
00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:16,865
Oh, I'm sorry. I picked up the
habit from living in a hotel.

416
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:20,995
Beom Soo isn't here and
I'm busy with something

417
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:25,565
so whether you're Ah Reum or Da Reum,
leave if you're going to say nonsense.

418
00:33:25,566 --> 00:33:29,656
Oh? I came to fulfill my
promise to you, Mother.

419
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:34,395
Here.

420
00:33:34,396 --> 00:33:36,116
What is this?

421
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:45,476
Why?

422
00:33:46,946 --> 00:33:50,915
No... you really didn't believe me?

423
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:56,055
I surely said I would lend you that money with three
nos: no interest, no collateral, and no guarantee.

424
00:33:56,056 --> 00:34:03,135
But, Mother... Do you have
any ramyun in the house?

425
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,535
I couldn't eat lunch and I'm hungry.

426
00:34:05,536 --> 00:34:10,105
You... Who are you?

427
00:34:10,106 --> 00:34:12,745
What's your identity?

428
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:19,435
Aigoo, Chief Prosecutor. This time, you should
look forward to being the Attorney General.

429
00:34:19,436 --> 00:34:24,525
Even if you release such a small
minnow, it won't affect any situation.

430
00:34:24,526 --> 00:34:28,575
Did I say a word to you
when my son was demoted?

431
00:34:28,576 --> 00:34:33,156
Jin Hyeong Woo is like a son to me.
Release him.

432
00:34:34,696 --> 00:34:36,546
That's good.

433
00:34:37,226 --> 00:34:40,566
It's been a while, we should go
fishing in the ocean sometime.

434
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:49,325
- What are you doing? - Do you know what type of
chance this is that you're releasing Jin Hyeong Woo?

435
00:34:49,326 --> 00:34:53,795
Because you accepted that bastard, Father-in-Law
is digging through our household!

436
00:34:53,796 --> 00:34:55,525
Do you think that your
father-in-law did that?

437
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,065
Of course. Jin Hyeong Woo, Jin Hyeong
Woo, it's all because of Jin Hyeong Woo!

438
00:34:58,066 --> 00:35:04,295
Silly fool. It was the doing of your wife
that you cherish and treasure so much!

439
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:05,926
What?

440
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:14,105
You planned this with Jin Hyeong Woo, didn't you?
Since you knew that my father needed Jin Hyeong Woo,

441
00:35:14,106 --> 00:35:18,215
you attacked my household knowing
that he would be released quickly.

442
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:21,885
It's been a while since I've
acted as a filial daughter.

443
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,105
When big-shot media outlet
kingpin Father-in-Law

444
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:28,625
tried to steal my father's ₩100
billion, he expected this much.

445
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,276
What?

446
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:36,235
How could you attack my household...
No, how could you attack me?

447
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:40,445
I stood on your side and worked so hard
to minimize your losses however I could!

448
00:35:40,446 --> 00:35:43,545
Is that why you took out my documents?

449
00:35:43,546 --> 00:35:47,926
Is that why you revealed the
documents in my bag to my father?

450
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:53,535
Don't do me any favors.

451

00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:10,086
I went to the prosecutors. They
released you sooner than I expected.

453
00:36:16,326 --> 00:36:19,895
You can't be discovered out here.

454
00:36:19,896 --> 00:36:23,535
We can't waste my efforts.

455
00:36:23,536 --> 00:36:29,256
I wanted to thank you for last time.

456
00:36:31,486 --> 00:36:36,406
Then, would you be my drinking
buddy for the last time?

457
00:37:20,546 --> 00:37:25,146
Are you okay? You didn't bring a
car, did you? I'll call a taxi.

458
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:30,316
Don't touch my body.

459
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,916
You're drunk. Listen to me.

460
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:54,665
What are you doing?

461
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:57,946
Then you should never have touched my body.

462
00:38:15,856 --> 00:38:18,555
Don't think about shaking me up just
because you helped me with that.

463
00:38:18,556 --> 00:38:20,815
I'll make it even with kissing
by getting slapped on the cheek.

464
00:38:20,816 --> 00:38:26,056
Why the heck are you acting like this? You're
the one that left because you didn't like me.

465
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:32,955
You're the one who chose Eun Soo without even looking back when I
so desperately grabbed onto you, so why are you doing this now?

466
00:38:32,956 --> 00:38:34,726
I know too!

467
00:38:36,336 --> 00:38:42,035
My ankles were held so firmly by my first love that
I couldn't even properly look at you for years.

468
00:38:42,036 --> 00:38:46,586
So what do you want me to do?
Just because you act like this...

469
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:53,016
I can't throw away my
dream now for you again.

470
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:56,486
This is my last chance!

471
00:38:57,976 --> 00:39:01,796
Although I can't forgive myself for
not knowing your worth until now,

472
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:05,306
if your dream is shattered because of me,

473
00:39:08,956 --> 00:39:11,586
I think it will be even
harder to forgive myself.

474
00:39:14,406 --> 00:39:17,076
Because I couldn't protect you till now,

475
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:25,266
I want to protect your dream even now.

476
00:39:40,316 --> 00:39:42,136
Hyeong Woo.

477
00:41:35,556 --> 00:41:37,096
Hyung, you're here.

478
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:39,016
Here.

479
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:52,186
This is our next target.

480
00:41:53,266 --> 00:41:58,025
B.B... are you talking about
women's makeup, BB cream?

481
00:41:58,026 --> 00:42:00,996
Blue Beauty, the Blue Beauty fund.

482
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:04,616
It's the immense slush fund
that Kang Seok Hyeon has.

483
00:42:09,746 --> 00:42:13,656
<i>Kang Seok Hyeon</i>

484
00:42:30,026 --> 00:42:33,255
<i>500,000,000,000</i>

485
00:42:33,256 --> 00:42:35,565
<i>Credit Suisse Bank</i>

486
00:42:35,566 --> 00:42:37,046
<i>500...</i>

487
00:42:37,776 --> 00:42:39,866
<i>Suisse...</i>

488
00:42:40,876 --> 00:42:44,326
<i>Yeah, Gi Hyeong. I need to ask a favor.</i>

489
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:47,865
<i>Could you check an account
at Credit Suisse?</i>

490
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:48,935
Did you find out about it?

491
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:53,316
<i>Yeah, that account number is definitely
Prime Minister Kang's account.</i>

492
00:43:05,256 --> 00:43:07,295
₩500 billion?

493
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:10,395
So, what is this? You're saying the
account he put out as bait to catch you

494
00:43:10,396 --> 00:43:12,595
was the actual fund.

495
00:43:12,596 --> 00:43:15,255
That's a piece of cake
to find out that fund.

496
00:43:15,256 --> 00:43:18,135
That 500 billion has already been transferred to
a different bank, so it's not there any more.

497
00:43:18,136 --> 00:43:22,195
Then that 500 billion is the
fund Blue Beauty manages.

498
00:43:22,196 --> 00:43:24,915
I don't know if there'll
be more than that either.

499
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:28,715
However, Kang Il Joo's political
career has suffered because of this

500
00:43:28,716 --> 00:43:31,976
and Kang Seok Hyeon will attempt to
bring that money into this country.

501
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,366
That's our target.

502
00:43:38,746 --> 00:43:42,905
Mother-in-Law, please tell Father-in-Law
it was a misunderstanding.

503
00:43:42,906 --> 00:43:47,646
I can really swear to this, this
incident wasn't my husband's doing.

504
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:51,205
What kind of strength do I have?

505
00:43:51,206 --> 00:43:54,056
I can even be chased out of this house.

506
00:43:55,246 --> 00:43:57,026
Mother-in-Law!

507
00:44:02,526 --> 00:44:04,036
<i>Here.</i>

508
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:09,495
<i>There'll be a terrible stench if the
milk is absorbed into the carpet.</i>

509
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:14,115
<i>I just soaked this in warm
water so it'll be okay soon.</i>

510
00:44:14,116 --> 00:44:17,345
<i>You have to study hard, Mi Rae.</i>

511
00:44:17,346 --> 00:44:20,985
<i>Otherwise, you'll have to do work like
what your mom is doing over there. Right?</i>

512
00:44:20,986 --> 00:44:25,746
<i>What are you doing? If you don't hurry,
the carpet will absorb the smell.</i>

513
00:44:31,316 --> 00:44:34,005
Coffee stains don't erase easily.

514
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:35,935
Why aren't you cleaning it up?

515
00:44:35,936 --> 00:44:38,086
Y-yes, yes, yes, yes.

516
00:44:40,566 --> 00:44:42,356
What should I do about this?

517
00:44:43,316 --> 00:44:47,386
That's enough! Will that get it out?

518
00:44:48,726 --> 00:44:51,305
The Prime Minister bought me this clothing.

519
00:44:51,306 --> 00:44:53,186
I don't think I can wear it now.

520
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:06,036
Was it ₩10 billion you embezzled from Eun Gang
Gallery by manipulating the account books?

521
00:45:06,706 --> 00:45:09,535
If we compute compound interest,

522
00:45:09,536 --> 00:45:13,085
and add all the interest,
is it ₩10 billion?

523
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:16,935
6 million 280 thousand and 74.

524
00:45:16,936 --> 00:45:22,586
Oh! If that is tax-exempt, we have to
add another about 20 million, don't we?

525
00:45:23,156 --> 00:45:27,895
Leave that account here and go.

526
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:31,915
What? Am I crazy?

527
00:45:31,916 --> 00:45:34,705
Do you know how difficult it was for me to collect
that money? Why would I give it to you and leave?

528
00:45:34,706 --> 00:45:38,425
I would rather reveal that to Father-in-Law and
tell him that you're trying to take that money!

529
00:45:38,426 --> 00:45:43,575
You can do that. That money didn't
come into my hands, did it?

530
00:45:43,576 --> 00:45:47,406
If that's revealed, you'll go
to the prosecutors immediately.

531
00:45:47,496 --> 00:45:52,696
If you want to leave this house
and go to jail, go ahead.

532
00:45:54,056 --> 00:45:58,256
Did you think you would be safe after
abandoning my daughter in storage?

533
00:46:07,546 --> 00:46:10,026
It's your turn, Prime Minister.

534
00:46:15,696 --> 00:46:18,305
Is something worrying you?

535
00:46:18,306 --> 00:46:21,735
I need to bring in some
money from overseas,

536
00:46:21,736 --> 00:46:24,046
but that's not very easy.

537
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:27,135
It's not something you should
concern yourself over.

538
00:46:27,136 --> 00:46:29,786
Do you have a slush fund overseas as well?

539
00:46:31,046 --> 00:46:34,375
You can just use the Eun Gang Gallery.

540
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:35,786
What are you saying?

541
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:42,296
Actually last time, about the review you told
me to do on Eun Gang Gallery's finances...

542
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:45,515
There were many problems.

543
00:46:45,516 --> 00:46:50,296
Representative Lee personally took quite a
bit of money from selling the paintings.

544
00:46:50,316 --> 00:46:52,585
I already presumed that.

545
00:46:52,586 --> 00:46:57,216
She's treated harshly by Il Do
so she was bound to do that.

546
00:46:57,996 --> 00:47:02,125
Didn't you also keep it a secret
because you felt sorry for her?

547
00:47:02,126 --> 00:47:06,035
Yes, but that method...

548
00:47:06,036 --> 00:47:10,075
She made a slush fund by
selling paintings overseas.

549
00:47:10,076 --> 00:47:12,205
She did money-laundering in the middle too.

550
00:47:12,206 --> 00:47:16,285
This isn't something that
can be solved so easily.

551
00:47:16,286 --> 00:47:19,705
Although using the gallery
is a good method,

552
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:23,655
the process of laundering money
abroad is quite complicated.

553
00:47:23,656 --> 00:47:30,106
Prime Minister, could I try
to manage Eun Gang Gallery?

554
00:47:31,006 --> 00:47:34,035
I can't just let money continue
to leak out as it's doing now.

555
00:47:34,036 --> 00:47:36,665
I want to be helpful to you.

556
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:40,655
I don't want to involve
you in illegal matters.

557
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:46,105
You're trying to bring in
money because of Il Joo.

558
00:47:46,106 --> 00:47:48,745
I want to help too.

559
00:47:48,746 --> 00:47:51,875
You know I worked in the
accounting department.

560
00:47:51,876 --> 00:47:53,936
I can do well.

561
00:47:54,986 --> 00:47:58,936
Please allow me to repay my
sorry feelings towards Il Joo.

562
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:05,315
If you win this round,

563
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:07,586
I'll put you in charge.

564
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:10,106
Great.

565
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:15,496
I shouldn't lose while I take
advantage of my nine-point lead.

566
00:48:27,336 --> 00:48:30,785
<i>Green Natural Ecological Park Development
plan at Mountain 221-8 Area, Jongno-Gu.</i>

567
00:48:30,786 --> 00:48:32,515
Green Natural Ecological Park?

568
00:48:32,516 --> 00:48:34,945
If we change from the hillside
town to the Ecological Park,

569
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:39,055
90% of the town residents agree with the
idea according to the study results.

570
00:48:39,056 --> 00:48:40,875
Please look at it.

571
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,985
What about the people living there?

572
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:47,586
They live in illegal residences anyway,
so we can move them to a different area.

573
00:48:48,786 --> 00:48:51,605
How much do you think you'll need?

574
00:48:51,606 --> 00:48:55,026
About ₩10 billion will be enough.

575
00:49:00,446 --> 00:49:03,766
₩10 billion is moving? Are you sure?

576
00:49:06,426 --> 00:49:09,686
I got it, Gi Hyeong. Continue watching it.

577
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:12,925
Why? Kang Seok Hyeon's
Swiss account is moving?

578
00:49:12,926 --> 00:49:17,035
Yeah. Since he can't bring in a large
amount from overseas directly,

579
00:49:17,036 --> 00:49:20,865
He will look for a money-laundering
company. We have to get that job.

580
00:49:20,866 --> 00:49:24,076
By the way, why only ₩10 billion?
You said ₩500 billion

581
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:29,865
It's easy to be discovered if he brings
in a large amount from the start.

582
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,996
Also, I threw bait only worth ₩10 billion.

583
00:49:40,366 --> 00:49:43,065
You made a very good stratagem,

584
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:45,325
to take the media background
away from Il Joo,

585
00:49:45,326 --> 00:49:48,446
a plan to take her husband away from her.

586
00:49:50,176 --> 00:49:52,425
How did you know that?

587
00:49:52,426 --> 00:49:57,256
Look at what Hyeong Woo did
to help what you're doing.

588
00:50:09,816 --> 00:50:12,805
It can't be only the woman who is
all hot and bothered by herself,

589
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:15,435
because it's the man who draws the sword.

590
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:20,356
It seems Hyeong Woo fanned the flames to
make Executive Director Kwon draw his sword.

591
00:50:21,456 --> 00:50:26,005
Even though you've entered this house again,
those people won't trust you completely.

592
00:50:26,006 --> 00:50:30,826
Buy their trust with this.

593
00:50:31,546 --> 00:50:34,216
You're telling me to buy Il Joo's heart.

594
00:50:48,176 --> 00:50:52,646
<i>You can't see the shadow at noon, the
time when the sun is the hottest.</i>

595
00:50:55,516 --> 00:50:59,516
<i>But as darkness approaches,
the shadow becomes longer.</i>

596
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:06,025
<i>Even if you walk through
that darkness alone,</i>

597
00:51:06,026 --> 00:51:08,026
<i>don't be afraid.</i>

598
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:13,366
<i>I'll always be the shadow behind you.</i>

599
00:51:26,076 --> 00:51:28,455
On the way back from my walk,

600
00:51:28,456 --> 00:51:32,715
I saw the maids bringing this in
saying it was mail for CEO Kang.

601
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:36,745
I took it to bring it to him but I was
bothered because there is no sender's name.

602
00:51:36,746 --> 00:51:39,006
So I opened it.

603
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:53,145
Even though I clearly gave a warning,

604
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:56,035
you created a disturbance
in this house again.

605
00:51:56,036 --> 00:52:00,605
Father, what about this? This is just
Brother-in-Law Kwon's affair with a maid.

606
00:52:00,606 --> 00:52:01,915
Why is this my fault?

607
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:05,365
That's right. It's Miss Il Joo's fault for not
being able to control her husband properly.

608
00:52:05,366 --> 00:52:09,135
Did you try to aim at Il Joo, again?

609
00:52:09,136 --> 00:52:11,995
You even had someone follow Son-in-Law
Kwon to take pictures like this?

610
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:13,925
Father.

611
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:16,605
What are you talking about? Why
would I do something like this?

612
00:52:16,606 --> 00:52:19,726
I have no intention of believing
what you say anymore.

613
00:52:20,796 --> 00:52:22,645
Pack your things and get out
of this house immediately.

614
00:52:22,646 --> 00:52:25,495
I really didn't do this,
why can't you believe me?

615
00:52:25,496 --> 00:52:28,865
Has there ever been a time when
you properly told the truth?

616
00:52:28,866 --> 00:52:30,885
- Didn't you hear me tell you to get out?
- Father!

617
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:33,815
Manager Jo and Team Leader Go,

618
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:36,376
call the maids and drag
him out immediately!

619
00:52:53,386 --> 00:52:55,876
Ah, so refreshing.

620
00:52:59,336 --> 00:53:02,185
- I'm sorry.- Oh no, it's fine.

621
00:53:02,186 --> 00:53:09,186
You must crave alcohol on such a nice day like this.
Alcohol was the matchmaker between you and me.

622
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:17,705
Um, I'll use the restroom
and be right back.

623
00:53:17,706 --> 00:53:21,796
Oh, okay. Hurry, hurry and go.

624
00:53:30,656 --> 00:53:32,426
Oh, excuse me.

625
00:53:33,186 --> 00:53:36,305
Please exchange this for
grape juice with a dose.

626
00:53:36,306 --> 00:53:38,225
Grape juice with a dose?

627
00:53:38,226 --> 00:53:41,725
Wine. Fill it with red wine, okay?

628
00:53:41,726 --> 00:53:46,795
Didn't you say earlier you couldn't
drink because you're pregnant?

629
00:53:46,796 --> 00:53:53,355
Pregnant? What pregnancy? In professional terms, they
call that a lie. Anyway, fill this up with red wine.

630
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,246
Yes.

631
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:11,975
Wait.

632
00:54:11,976 --> 00:54:15,245
This isn't right. Don't
you know communication?

633
00:54:15,246 --> 00:54:17,485
What needs to be said?

634
00:54:17,486 --> 00:54:19,545
You said you weren't pregnant.

635
00:54:19,546 --> 00:54:22,045
You just put on a show.

636
00:54:22,046 --> 00:54:26,425
From the very beginning, did I
say that I was pregnant myself?

637
00:54:26,426 --> 00:54:29,215
You! You were the one who
pushed me into pregnancy.

638
00:54:29,216 --> 00:54:32,935
I was nauseous due to drinking too much
from the previous night so I gagged.

639
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,976
It's your fault for thinking of my
gagging as the gagging you wanted.

640
00:54:41,056 --> 00:54:44,615
No, that... So, what I'm saying is...

641
00:54:44,616 --> 00:54:47,905
Hey, go to the hospital.

642
00:54:47,906 --> 00:54:50,085
Meet a proper doctor,

643
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:54,085
get diagnosed, and take
your medication on time.

644
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:56,475
Otherwise, it is hard to become a human.

645
00:54:56,476 --> 00:54:57,635
What did you just say right now?

646
00:54:57,636 --> 00:55:02,785
If you need a natural remedy, eat
mugwort and garlic for 100 days.

647
00:55:02,786 --> 00:55:07,426
But you'll still be hopeless.

648
00:55:14,426 --> 00:55:16,565
Hey, why are you being like this?

649
00:55:16,566 --> 00:55:20,775
I also got goose bumps to
act pregnant at this age.

650
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:26,115
Do you know how many times I thought about jumping into the fire to
make myself a roast chicken because you're too cheesy and corny?

651
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:29,365
OK, that's enough.

652
00:55:29,366 --> 00:55:31,986
I played well, octopus-head!

653
00:55:39,026 --> 00:55:40,786
What's the matter?

654
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:44,456
How could something like that happen?

655
00:55:47,486 --> 00:55:50,265
All right. I'll meet him.

656
00:55:50,266 --> 00:55:51,515
What is going on?

657
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:53,446
It's nothing.

658
00:55:57,656 --> 00:55:59,486
Thank you.

659
00:56:01,056 --> 00:56:05,246
I don't really like this,
but a win is a win.

660
00:56:07,736 --> 00:56:10,556
I lost with the difference of one house.

661
00:56:34,496 --> 00:56:37,065
Welcome, Elder.

662
00:56:37,066 --> 00:56:38,175
Chief Director.

663
00:56:38,176 --> 00:56:41,125
Truthfully, I only decided
to manage Eun Gang Gallery.

664
00:56:41,126 --> 00:56:43,425
I'm not confident to become
the Chief Director...

665
00:56:43,426 --> 00:56:45,045
I'll help you beside you.

666
00:56:45,046 --> 00:56:48,165
You can just do this with the spirit
you have when you play baduk.

667
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:52,875
You play in tactical moves
rather than in practical moves.

668
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,625
I will learn the practical moves as well.

669
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:56,856
I have a lot of greed.

670
00:57:05,186 --> 00:57:08,075
What does "Brother-in-Law
left the house" mean?

671
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:09,645
Team Leader Go was talking about it.

672
00:57:09,646 --> 00:57:12,805
My father didn't forget his attack on me.

673
00:57:12,806 --> 00:57:14,685
Didn't he agree to forgive him for that?

674
00:57:14,686 --> 00:57:19,535
On top of that, my sister-in-law was caught
for stealing money from the Eun Gang Gallery.

675
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:23,276
Eun Soo agreed to take over my brother
and my sister-in-law's position.

676
00:57:26,746 --> 00:57:29,356
Have we made up now?

677
00:57:30,896 --> 00:57:33,695
Just yesterday, we had a huge argument

678
00:57:33,696 --> 00:57:35,786
because of Jin Hyeong Woo.

679
00:57:36,546 --> 00:57:39,296
A married couple's fight is like
cutting water with a knife.

680
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:46,436
You're here, Executive Director Kwon.

681
00:57:48,646 --> 00:57:49,755
How are you here?

682
00:57:49,756 --> 00:57:52,365
I told her to come back

683
00:57:52,366 --> 00:57:55,226
because I think I misunderstood last time.

684
00:57:57,936 --> 00:58:00,946
I'm sorry for causing trouble for you two.

685
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:17,875
Give me the money first. Are you joking?

686
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:21,616
I have to confirm that you
really took the video.

687
00:58:29,086 --> 00:58:30,755
<i>Prime Minister.</i>

688
00:58:30,756 --> 00:58:34,935
<i>If I die, Il Joo will
never move as you wish.</i>

689
00:58:34,936 --> 00:58:39,675
<i>I'm fine if you abandon me. However, however, Prime
Minister, you can't throw away your dream as well...</i>

690
00:58:39,676 --> 00:58:41,235
That time,

691
00:58:41,236 --> 00:58:45,585
I wondered what I should do if a murder
happened on my boat so I secretly recorded it

692
00:58:45,586 --> 00:58:51,556
but the guy filmed in the video
appeared on TV yesterday.

693
00:58:53,076 --> 00:58:58,515
I wondered who the Prime Minister was back then.
It's Prime Minister Kang Seok Hyeon, isn't it?

694
00:58:58,516 --> 00:59:00,766
How much?

695
00:59:08,416 --> 00:59:12,555
I got it. I reported the money laundering
companies that you mentioned to Interpol.

696
00:59:12,556 --> 00:59:15,195
Kang Seok Hyeon's side would probably know those
companies were tailed when they entrust them with it.

697
00:59:15,196 --> 00:59:17,755
We'll get an opportunity.

698
00:59:17,756 --> 00:59:20,515
I even set up a company long
ago to prepare for this.

699
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:22,485
Is it a real company?

700
00:59:22,486 --> 00:59:23,935
I just have the name.

701
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:26,005
It's a paper company.

702
00:59:26,006 --> 00:59:27,955
There are quite a lot of
money-laundering showings too.

703
00:59:27,956 --> 00:59:29,425
What's the name of the company?

704
00:59:29,426 --> 00:59:31,266
<i>Cukoo Corporation</i>

705
00:59:36,986 --> 00:59:40,246
These are the results after examining
the companies you mentioned.

706
00:59:42,656 --> 00:59:44,865
There are some problems in
the companies we checked.

707
00:59:44,866 --> 00:59:48,685
The only company left is called CK.

708
00:59:48,686 --> 00:59:52,436
The fee is reasonable and their
accomplishments are also good.

709
00:59:55,726 --> 00:59:57,946
Based in Hong Kong,

710
00:59:58,466 --> 01:00:00,625
Cukoo Corporation?

711
01:00:00,626 --> 01:00:02,056
Yes.

712
01:00:02,846 --> 01:00:05,125
Let's start now.

713
01:00:05,126 --> 01:00:07,006
Cukoo...

714
01:00:16,066 --> 01:00:18,585
From Schweizer Bank to Stern Montrose Inc.
Frankfurt, Germany,

715
01:00:18,586 --> 01:00:24,915
€7,660,000 is transferred for real estate.

716
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:27,695
That money is supposed
to come to our country.

717
01:00:27,696 --> 01:00:32,445
From Stern Montrose Inc. to La Pluie-Frédéric
Import & Export Co., Paris, France,

718
01:00:32,446 --> 01:00:37,355
€7,660,000 is transferred for merchandise.

719
01:00:37,356 --> 01:00:40,785
From La Pluie-Frédéric Import & Export Co.,
Paris, France to Chaohu Co. in Hangzhou, China,

720
01:00:40,786 --> 01:00:44,546
¥54,570,000 is deposited for antiques.

721
01:00:47,976 --> 01:00:52,205
As you can see, it's doing
well in Hangzhou, China.

722
01:00:52,206 --> 01:00:54,415
It seems to be going well.

723
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:56,796
Department Head, just a moment.

724
01:01:00,226 --> 01:01:03,096
Why is it stopping in so many countries?

725
01:01:04,306 --> 01:01:07,175
To avert the possible prosecutor's tracing,

726
01:01:07,176 --> 01:01:10,365
the money is processed in
many different countries.

727
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:14,566
The money will probably go
to Eun Gang Gallery next.

728
01:01:14,596 --> 01:01:19,346
You're selling paintings
to that Chinese company.

729
01:01:21,896 --> 01:01:25,496
Prime Minister, something is strange.

730
01:01:26,606 --> 01:01:27,546
What is it?

731
01:01:27,547 --> 01:01:29,725
This Cukoo Corporation.

732
01:01:29,726 --> 01:01:32,515
It is definitely based in Hong Kong,

733
01:01:32,516 --> 01:01:36,636
but our employee tracked the
IP address and it's in Korea.

734
01:01:38,686 --> 01:01:41,755
It could be a trap set
up by the prosecutors,

735
01:01:41,756 --> 01:01:45,456
or it's also possible that
someone is targeting your money.

736
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:48,146
Jin Hyeong Woo.

737
01:01:48,886 --> 01:01:51,026
It could be him.

738
01:01:53,756 --> 01:01:55,425
Can you investigate if you
track the IP address?

739
01:01:55,426 --> 01:01:56,595
Yes, we just need 10 minutes.

740
01:01:56,596 --> 01:01:58,315
Please call me.

741
01:01:58,316 --> 01:02:01,196
- Manager Jo, start the car.- Yes.

742
01:02:03,506 --> 01:02:05,725
Is something going on?

743
01:02:05,726 --> 01:02:08,156
It seems there's a problem.

744
01:02:08,866 --> 01:02:11,026
Stay here.

745
01:02:22,216 --> 01:02:26,626
<i>Hyeong Woo, I think you've been caught.
Hurry and run away.</i>

746
01:02:35,746 --> 01:02:37,945
How long do you think it'll take to
move the money to Eun Gang Gallery?

747
01:02:37,946 --> 01:02:42,146
Around two hours. It takes
some time in China.

748
01:02:48,486 --> 01:02:52,686
I understand, I think I'll
arrive in 30 minutes.

749
01:02:55,946 --> 01:02:57,275
Go to this address.

750
01:02:57,276 --> 01:02:58,946
Understood.

751
01:03:46,796 --> 01:03:54,796
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to
you by The Glamorous Team @Viki</i>

752
01:04:02,576 --> 01:04:04,975
<i>You can't call me rashly. What if
you get caught by Kang Seok Hyeon?</i>

753
01:04:04,976 --> 01:04:07,125
<i>Prime Minister Kang is going
over there right now!</i>

754
01:04:07,126 --> 01:04:08,225
