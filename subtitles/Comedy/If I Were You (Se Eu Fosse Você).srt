1
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,900
Stack it there.

2
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,820
Let's put you in a cage.

3
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,540
- Check out Mr. Speedy here!
- Hey, cut the crap.

4
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:07,060
He's going home...

5
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,580
Sing one for him.
Something special...

6
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,300
A special tune you say...

7
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,580
Yes, go for it.

8
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:27,900
Chains and fire all around,
God, bring the doors down to the ground.

9
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:34,500
Set the bloody jail on flames
Let us all run free, no chains.

10
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,740
May the guards all go to hell.

11
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,780

You know who came to see me?

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,860
Your brother.

25
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,580
Can l go to the toilet?

26
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,940
Hello!

27
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,340

So?

Mother came home.

34
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,140
How could she come home?

35
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:15,460
She did, l'm telling you,
she is home.

36
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,540
She wants me to go to Italy with her.

37
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:21,940
And what did you tell her?

38

43
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,100
- That's it, you're done now.
- But it's not right.

44
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:49,220
Get out of here and shut up.

45
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,420
You've got an appointment
at the doctor's omice.

46
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,380
What doctor? The statutes says l have
the right to a 15 minutes visit...

47
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:55,335

Mother has to leave in a week.

00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,140
She wants to talk to you

62
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,020
Don't you know
you can't go near the fence?

63
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,980
Hey, what are you doing?
Resisting arrest?

64
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:30,300
Stop it, you'll kill him!

65
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,740
Grab his hand!

66
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,620

One word and l'll rip
your fucking eyes out, you hear me?

76
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,060
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

77
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:22,540
Easy, Bear, easy. l'll rip your eyes out
if l hear one sound.

78
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,340
On the 12th of April 2009, 4:43PM,

and l seized the inmate Chiscan Silviu.

81
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,740
The inmate Chiscan Silviu
crossed the demarcation line,

82
00:13:37,654 --> 00:13:40,775
he entered the surveillance area,

83
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,500
he ignored the challenge
and resisted arrest.

84
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:51,980
What do you think about this?

85
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,060
During the four years you've spent here
you've been a good boy.

86
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:07,300
You like it in the Hole?

87
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,180
No, sir, l don't.

88
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,900
Then what were you doing there?

89
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,580
Listen to me...

90
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:26,660
You tell me
exactly what were you doing there.

91
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,580
Come on!

92
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,460
Let's hear it!

93
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:36,740
lf not, you'll get
two more years in prison, just like that.

94
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,380
l wanted to see
who brought my brother here.

95
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,540
Who brought him?

96
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,820
- A woman
- Who was that woman?

97
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,420
- My mother.
- So?

98
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,700
She wants to take my brother
to Italy with her.

99
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:11,820
Come again?

100
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,780
She wants to take him
to Italy with her. My brother.

101
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,580
So what? That's OK.

102
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,860
Don't you want her to take him?

103
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,540
No.

104
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,980
Come on, get serious...

105
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:42,340
For the next 9 days you'll spend here,
no more mistakes!

106
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:43,580
Understood?

Yes warden.

Go!

111
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,240
Yo! Godson!

112
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:15,700
Godson!

113
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,420
- What's up?
- Come here a second!

114
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,740
What's up, did they let you go?

115
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,060
Yes, warden let me get away
with it.

116
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:31,140
Listen man, l need to use your phone
It's burning...

117
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,140
They made you
snitch somebody out, right?

118
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:33,940
No man...

119
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:37,780
- Get the hell out of here!
- Honestly, l swear he didn't.

120
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,780
Wait!

l swear, l really need to call somebody.

122
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,620

- Right now.

123
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,040
Hey, Blond!

124
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:00,340
- What's up, dude, did he let you go?
- Yeah, man, fuck him.

125
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,140
You pulled some strings, right?

126
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,300
He wants to use the phone now.

127
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,860
You know l'm cool.

128
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:13,060
- Whom do you want to call?
- My brother.

129
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,540
Later, when they take us out to work.
You bring it to him, you hear?

130
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,380
Three packs.

How do l know you're not shitting me?

134
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,260

00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,580
- OK, seven packs then.

136
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,100
Hey, what the fuck got into you?

You want to know what l like best?

00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:25,980
Yes, but l don't want to write,
l want you to ask me.

163
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:29,540
What's the point in asking you,
if you have to write it down?

164
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,780
l don't want to write,
l'd rather want you ask me.

165
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,100
Fine.

166
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:42,740
- Do you want to know?
- Yes.

167
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,180
Then ask me.

168
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,580
What do you like the most?

169
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,900
Most of all, l like eating pizza.

- No.

172
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,420
Why?

173
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,820
- Any more questions?
- Yes, why can't we talk now?

174
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,220
Because we can't, l'm here to help you.

175
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,455

You'll be interviewed.

Hey, miss!

Come on, why you're ignoring me?

00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:50,500
You're very beautiful.

200
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,780
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, my pleasure.

201
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:38,860
Hey, stop it!

202
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,860
Hey, cool down!

Come here if you got the balls...

00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:54,300
Let them fight!

207
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,020
For a pack of cigarettes, man...

208
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,580
Hey, guys, cut it out... enough...

209
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:08,260
Leave us alone!

210
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,260
- Hey, enough is enough!
- Leave me the fuck alone!

211
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:12,100
Come on, let them be...

212
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,820
- Get your fucking hands om me!
- Cut it out...

213
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:20,020
You fight
for a lousy pack of cigarettes.

214
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,300
Are you picking on me for nothing?

215
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,335
Give me the cigarettes!

216
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,180
You can suck my dick!

217
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,380
- You're a fucking cunt, or what?
- Hey, enough, that's it.

218
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:30,620
- Buck, Buck!
- Incoming...

219
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:32,900
Buck, buck!

220
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,140
- Come on, kid, go!
- Buck buck!

221
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,500
Easy man...

222
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:40,100
Buck, buck.

223
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,060
Come on, say it!

224
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:44,140
Come on, already!

225
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:51,140
Say it!

226
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,060
Two!

227
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,260
Two! Fuck you!

228
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,580
NO!

229
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,260
What's the fucking number?

230
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,060
- What was it?
- What?

231
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,020
- Tell me the number!
- Three.

232
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,380
- It was two.
- It wasn't two.

233
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,140
lt was two.

234
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,940
Sunny, it was three, man...

235
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,500
For this cocksucker, it's any
number l want it to be...

236
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,460
Why are you calling me a cocksucker?

237
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,420
You want to hit me?

238
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:35,900
Get your hands om me!

239
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,180
Come on, hit me!

240
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,180
Come on, sucker, hit me.

241
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:43,620
Are you afraid to hit me?

242
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:45,500
Hit me!

243
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:53,820
Are you afraid
you won't get out of here no more?

244
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,980
l'm right, ain't l?

245
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,460
You're afraid they won't set you free?

246
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:01,420
Are you?

247
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:07,740
You're afraid you're going to rot in jail?

248
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,300
Say it!

249
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:14,020
- Come on, hit him back!
- He doesn't have the balls.

250
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,420
From now on, you do
only what l tell you to do, got it?

251
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,460
lf you don't, l'll blow you
and your dumb buddy right here

252
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,015
for all to see.

253
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:29,660
Do you hear me?

254
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,100
l'm talking to you, get it?

255
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:34,820
Get the fuck out of here!

256
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:36,540
From now on, he is my slave.

257
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:37,860
lf anyone wants to spit on his face,
go ahead!

258
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:28,140
Cluck! Cluck! Cluck!

259
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,580
Do you know what l'm gonna do
when l'll be free?

260
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,740
l'll get out of here and l'll marry
that girl with beautiful lips...

261
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:08,220
And l'll pick her up from work
and we'll fuck right there in the car...

262
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,860
And we'll fuck, on and on and on...

263
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,300
We'll fuck our brains out man...

264
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:58,100
What are you doing?

265
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:00,220
Hurry up! He's getting away!

266
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:02,660
Fucking son of a bitch!

267
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,420
- How are you, my boy?
- Hi, mom!

268
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,460
How are you?

269
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,620
l'm good.

270
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,820
Sit down.

271
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,700
You've grown so much!

272
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,340
l ate my veggies.

273
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,900
l brought you some cigarettes,
Marius told me you needed some.

274
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:32,900
Thanks.

275
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:38,940
How are you?

276
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,300
l'm OK. When did you come back?

277
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,460
A few days ago, but l won't stay long,
l'm leaving the day after tomorrow.

278
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,380
l have to go back to work.

279
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,020
- My baby...
- What work is that?

280
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,500
l work in a hotel, as a receptionist.

281
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:27,820
l wanted to ask you
to let Marius stay here.

282
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:32,740
He is not fit for work
and he has to finish school.

283
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,380
You shouldn't carry him around with you,
like you did to me.

284
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:53,860
l'm not doing so bad over there...

285
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,300
l want to take him with me

286
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,580
and when you'll be free,
you can come as well.

287
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:08,740
l'll never come to you.

288
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,420
Why?

289
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:19,700
You came here
to get on my nerves, or what?

290
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,060
Why are you talking to me like that?

291
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,580
What do you mean?

292
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,020
For eight years you...

293
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:32,620
l talked to your father in hospital
and he signed the papers

294
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,420
to let him come with me.

295
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,500
You'll never ever take him away
with you!

296
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,060
You won't take him away
because l raised him.

297
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:49,900
For 8 years you didn't care about us,
and now you come to take him away?

298
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,780
You're feeling lonely, right?

299
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,820
You should have taken care of him.

300
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,700
Don't you talk to me like that.

301
00:39:56,179 --> 00:40:00,460
- What do you mean?
- l'm your mother. Yours and his.

302
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,140
What are you?

303
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:04,700
Come again. What are you?

304
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,220
You've never been a mother to me.

305
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,140
When l was there with you, you sent me
home because l was getting in your way.

306
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:14,860
Now you want your family back, right?

307
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:18,420
She came back because
she's all alone there...

308
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:20,140
She's lonely like shit,
that's why she came back.

309
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:21,660
Am l right?

310
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:27,660
Things aren't exactly like that...

311
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:29,740
Really?

312
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,700
You took me with you
and when you found a new guy,

313
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,020
you got rid of me and sent me home,
like a luggage.

314
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,140
ls it true or not?

315
00:40:44,139 --> 00:40:47,220
And then you came back
and took me with you again

316
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,980
until you found a new guy,
and you sent me home again,

317
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,820
like l was nothing but a bag of shit.

318
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,340
ls this what you want to do with him?

319
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:03,260
You want to destroy his future
just like you did with me.

320
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,900
This is what you want to do to him.

321
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,700
Because you are a fucking whore.

322

You stupid con! Don't you talk to me

Do you want to know why?
Because l'm your mother, that's why.

328

Don't you dare hit me again,

00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,580
Sir, have you seen warden?

354
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:38,340
He went to the dormitories.

355
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,420
Have you seen warden?

356
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,740

You want to rat us out?

360

Just tell me if you've seen him.

361
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:01,580
Why?

362

if l could go on a leave, for...

369
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:31,220
For one day, sir...
l need to go home for one day.

370
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,540
How come?

Could you?

372
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:39,220
l can't let you go on a leave.

373
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:42,460
Once you've been examined
by the Committee

374
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,300
you're not allowed to go on leave.

375
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:47,980
- Where do you want to go?
- Home.

376
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,980
Won't you go home
when you'll be released?

00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:54,660
Yes, but l really have to go now.

378
00:44:57,219 --> 00:44:58,740

381
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:10,580

382
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:15,060

383
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,020

00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:04,220
Who do you think you are?

411
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:13,140
You're a cocksucker, how come

412
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,040
Wait a bit.

413
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:37,820
You owe me T packs of cigarettes...

And l want them today,

l don't want anyone else reading it.

436

You can refuse to be interviewed
but since you've took the quiz...

01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,220
How is the guard doing?

485
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,020
lf you let the girl go now,
we can still work things out.

486
01:03:02,019 --> 01:03:03,260
We'll say you were provoked
to do this.

487
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,660
You have my word for it.

488
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,060
You have my word for it,
you hear me?

489
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,260
Silviu!

490
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:55,660
Do you still want to interview me?

491
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,180
No.

492
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,420
Let's do it.

493
01:04:52,099 --> 01:04:55,100
Chiscan Silviu, 18 years old, Braila.

494
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,940
Have you ever been to Braila?

495
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:11,660
No.

496
01:05:12,539 --> 01:05:15,580
Too bad. We could have met

497
01:05:15,659 --> 01:05:17,740
and l could have taken you out
for a comee.

498
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:32,460
Do you want to go out with me
for a comee?

499
01:05:38,739 --> 01:05:41,980
- Do you?
- Yes.

500
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:46,020
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Yes.

501
01:05:46,099 --> 01:05:50,180
So what? It's just a comee,
There's nothing wrong with that.

502
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,580
Do you want to?

503
01:05:57,539 --> 01:05:59,740
- Do you?
- Yes.

504
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:06,540
You know it's all on tape now, right?

505
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,260
Yes.

506
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,700
Not anymore.

507
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:39,740
Give me something to clean him up.

508
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,820

514
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,240

515
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:46,660
Send her in.

516
01:11:46,899 --> 01:11:49,340
Let us take the guard out of there.

517

Send some inmates
to take the guard out of here.

523

Shut up!

524

Send in two more to take him out.

525

Good luck man.

526

Now you keep him there

566
01:18:35,079 --> 01:18:37,360
Tell the driver to get out of the car
and leave the engine running.

567
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:42,020

Shag her!

575
01:19:42,699 --> 01:19:45,260

Yes.

Put your hands on your head!

585
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,420
Freeze!
