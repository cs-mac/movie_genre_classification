1
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,332
It's Thongs. To win in treble

2
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,134
4, 8 and 3 for races 3, 4 and 8. $10,000 each bet

3
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,435
Thongs

4
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,012
Who is it?

5
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,113
This is Ivy

6
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:03,161
Why are you still calling me?

7
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,285
Where are you?

8
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,490
I wish I knew

9
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,057
Don't bother me with secular matters

10
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,357
Go to hell!

11
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,664
Same to you

12
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,335
If that can solve anything. I won't be a monk

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,429
You'll burn in hell!

14
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,701
Mind your language. Dear

15
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,739
It's an enhanced Siemens 304

16
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,108
refitted with infrared rays

17
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,286
The fuse is on the right, go left

18
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,492
It's me again

19
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,559
4. 8 and 3 for races 3, 4 and 8.
$10.000 each to place

20
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,701
I was recently enlightened

21
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,303
Reach for the sky with limited resources

22
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:58,582
Too many women, too little time

23
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,215
Going after them all is a losing game

24
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,118
Therefore I have decided

25
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,255
to focus only on the wealthy ones

26
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,555
The only way to get rich

27
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,687
is to find a rich wife

28
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,630
Great!

29
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,655
You think so too?

30
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,257
Move up a bit

31
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,291
More?

32
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,395
More

33
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,532
More?

34
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,008
More...

35
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,043
More...

36
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,346
More...

37
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:36,420
More... Don't!

38
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,049
Damn! I lost by a whisker

39
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,150
You'll gamble your life away

40
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,216
Get lost

41
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,251
It's opened

42
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,285
You should've told me earlier

43
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,191
Not much here

44
00:02:55,408 --> 00:03:00,345
It hurts...

45
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,743
Relax, Mrs, Li

46
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,740
You must spread your legs

47
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,311
Relax, open up! Open them wide

48
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,680
What are you doing?

49
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,150
Can't you read?

50
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,399
These laxative cost $89

51
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,137
Forget the cheap stuff

52
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,702
Get Taxol

53
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,099
They're for chemotherapy, they cost $8,000 each

54
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,705
Go for these

55
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,314
Relax...

56
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,417
Now push. Harder...

57
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,610
Push harder!

58
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,682
OK... There we go

59
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,784
See for yourself, boy or girl?

60
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,723
We're done, We're coming down

61
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,156
Let's rendezvous outside Block B

62
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,494
B for Barcelona?

63
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,000
B for Boy

64
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,269
Smart ass! Block Boy it is

65
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,680
B for Boy

66
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,052
Act normal

67
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,496
How? I look like I'm pregnant

68
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,534
and you the Hunchback of Notre Dame

69
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,366
Excuse me, tell me...

70
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,463
Don't ask

71
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,135
Doctors can have humps and pot bellies

72
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,338
Don't discriminate against the disabled

73
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,037
Control...

74
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,705
Hello! Dr, Tsui?
I found two men acting suspiciously

75
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,115
Yes. There's an emergency?

76
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,407
Run!

77
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,353
Split up

78
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,128
Don't get caught,
and don't spill the beans if you do

79
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,350
Hey! Get out!
Sorry!

80
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:36,461
No. 3

81
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,428
Sorry!

82
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,470
I should've backed No, 9

83
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,455
I'm sure he'll make it

84
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:05,025
Hang in there, Dad...

85
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,287
Pardon me...

86
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,400
Why. Dad...

87
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,432
Why?

88
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,562
Who are you?

89
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,999
Who is he?

90
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,100
Chan

91
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,768
Sorry... wrong ward

92
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,278
I was looking for a Wong

93
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,447
I'm so sorry... excuse me

94
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,144
Sorry

95
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,281
Doctor...

96
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,515
Congratulations. Mrs. Li

97
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,990
The baby is healthy and cute, 2.8 K. G

98
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,528
Really? Let me... Yes

99
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,255
Here, look how cute he is

100
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,197
How's my daughter-in-law?

101
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,258
She's fine

102
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,096
Everything went smoothly

103
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,397
Here she is

104
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,560
Mani

105
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,106
How are you feeling? You did great!

106
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,105
Look! He's so handsome

107
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,713
Just like me Well? Does it hurt?

108
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,638
You must be tired. Get some rest

109
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,543
Get some rest

110
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,588
So cute...

111
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,712
Back to you, Dr, Lee

112
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,151
Mani

113
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,722
They're on the third floor

114
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,495
Let's take a look

115
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,295
Max.,.

116
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,641
Remember what you promised me?

117
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,268
You said...

118
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,740
we'll go to Alaska

119
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,418
and get married in a white chapel

120
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,347
Let's go now...

121
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,280
Marry me

122
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,724
I'm married to Calvin

123
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,187
Give me the baby

124
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,060
You don't mean it

125
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,527
Listen, we're not meant for each other

126
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,728
Give me the baby...

127
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,504
I can change for you

128
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,401
You're coming with me anyway

129
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,635
Come back!

130
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,984
Hey, buddy!

131
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,384
The last race

132
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,225
Back No. 6, not No. 9

133
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,792
No. 6? Stop running, you!

134
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,089
That's my form guide!

135
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,164
Give me the baby...

136
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,003
Move it...

137
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,040
Hang on. Mani

138
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,019
You're hurting me

139
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,293
Give me Mani

140
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,617
Are you alright?

141
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,560
Max! Come back...

142
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,096
Out of the way! Stop him!

143
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:06,767
Stop him

144
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,801
Stop them by the elevator!

145
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,774
Back off!

146
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,348
Take it easy

147
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,046
Stay away! Cool it...

148
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,412
Stop all the escalators

149
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,223
Go away!

150
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,161
First you took Mani and now my son!

151
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,357
You're no buddy of mine

152
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,500
Give me the baby Go away!

153
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,201
Take it easy!

154
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,667
Calm down! Don't do this!

155
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,370
Mani, leave with me

156
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,304
We'll raise the kid

157
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,237
You're crazy! Give me my child

158
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,506
Come with me! Stop crying...

159
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,548
Calm down! Stand back

160
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,383
The baby... No!

161
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,679
Let's get out of here

162
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,705
Help her!

163
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,240
Hurry up, go...

164
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,528
Grab hold of the baby Watch out!

165
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,225
He's falling...

166
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,595
Baby...

167
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,171
Towel! Get some towels...

168
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,010
Pull me up

169
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,484
It's alright! They got him

170
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,682
Amazing!

171
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,186
Thanks

172
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,352
Go help the baby!

173
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,768
You dropped the drugs. Told you to leave them

174
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,596
There goes your Viagra!

175
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:42,261
Go... Go... No. 9...

176
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,164
Again! Whose bet is this?

177
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,162
How's the displacement?

178
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,500
This is for kids

179
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,438
I'm asking you about the displacement

180
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,570
Kids...

181
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,547
Don't worry. I'm just teasing you

182
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,412
I had my eye on this one

183
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,616
Here's my deposit, prepare the contract

184
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,701
Ready...

185
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,093
Go!

186
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,297
Got it

187
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,265
There!

188
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,444
If you can sense a hair...

189
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,274
Nothing can stop you

190
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,510
Hair? That's impossible

191
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,281
There's nothing. Just small change

192
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,577
Look!

193
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,048
These shark's fins are enormous

194
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,192
Let's beat it

195
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,271
I don't want to get rabies

196
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:03,011
Mommie, it's Superman!

197
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,713
Y oshihama abalone, Uncle! $10.000 a piece

198
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,644
There's more than a hundred of them

199
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,453
That's more like it

200
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,290
Come on! Come on...

201
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:18,687
Come on!

202
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,426
Player 3, dealer 7, Dealer takes all

203
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,334
How much?

204
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,642
This should be enough.

205
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,614
Keep the change

206
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,241
Why don't you use a credit card?

207
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,351
That's just her tip

208
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,085
Credit Card

209
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,255
I'll look around again. Wait for me at the door

210
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,449
OK!

211
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,393
That's a discount card from a sushi store

212
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,591
Of course I know

213
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,499
We'll take these as well

214
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,157
Keep the change!

215
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,428
Stop being a bad loser

216
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,033
Q, uit if you can't bear to lose

217
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,108
You're dead if you don't pay me back

218
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,305
I'll pay up in a second

219
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:41,770
OK!

220
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,287
Why put the money in the refrigerator?

221
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,684
Why?

222
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,528
That's not a refrigerator. It's a safe

223
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,265
But don't tell anyone

224
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:18,972
Thanks

225
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,178
This label is fantastic

226
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,250
But I've ordered something even better for you

227
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,648
It'll be here soon

228
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,189
Try this, Miss

229
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,234
New tissue paper with floral fragrance

230
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,063
Try the floral fragrance

231
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,060
Hands off!

232
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:45,202
Come on...

233
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,568
What the hell. Spooky?

234
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,069
What now. Hairy?

235
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,375
Where's the money from?

236
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,472
When are you going to pay up?

237
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,507
Hands off me!

238
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,084
If I win, you'll get your money

239
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,312
Right away!

240
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,680
Let's see about that

241
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:10,330
Come on...

242
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,527
No

243
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,596
I'm too nervous

244
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,798
Check it for me, Hairy

245
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,332
Alright

246
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,108
Step aside!

247
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:27,246
Go...

248
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,315
Stop him! Don't let him get away

249
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,131
McDaddy!

250
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,302
I like talking to you

251
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,265
unlike your thugs

252
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,275
All they do is fight

253
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,509
K. Now why I like to borrow from you?

254
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,008
You have compassion. Sympathy

255
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,138
and a conscience

256
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,611
Am I right?

257
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,646
And you are smart. Too

258
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,584
I'll repay your $100,000 loan

259
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,160
in 100 installments. OK?

260
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,019
It's a deal

261
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,803
I hate smooth talkers

262
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,262
I have a living to make

263
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,020
Don't come over

264
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,754
I was just kidding, McDaddy

265
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,087
You think this is funny?

266
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,329
Don't make me jump

267
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,626
Go ahead

268
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,565
Are you serious?

269
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,695
Jump!

270
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,441
You don't want me dead. Do you?

271
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,338
No. But you brought it upon yourself

272
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,012
Get a camera and take a picture

273
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,104
Yes. Boss

274
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,175
If I die. You'll kiss your money goodbye

275
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,980
It won't do us any good

276
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,089
No. I think it's brilliant

277
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,986
I've got so much bad debts lately

278
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,456
This will show the others

279
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,752
Go ahead, jump

280
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,287
No. McDaddy

281
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,488
No?

282
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,297
Let's see...

283
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,460
No?

284
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,571
So you can read my mind?

285
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,079
I'm safe!

286
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,284
Come on! Come after me!

287
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,586
You!

288
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,160
Take this!

289
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,524
I'll get you, Thongs

290
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,364
What are you doing. Pal?

291
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,609
Fixing the air-conditioning
It's OK... go back in

292
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,640
Look, Boss! Cops!

293
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,971
Here they come

294
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,139
Go!

295
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,531
Thongs

296
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,398
Inspector Mok

297
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,272
Sorry. I didn't see you

298
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,776
You say that every time

299
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,140
You missed the alumni gathering

300
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,603
Alumni?

301
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,182
Nobody called me No?

302
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,239
No!

303
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,707
Grade school or high school?

304
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:48,583
Grade school

305
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,609
Here, you know the drill

306
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,416
Is this really necessary?

307
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,015
No need to leap off a building over a card game

308
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,293
I told you to quit gambling

309
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,193
I hate bailing you out in the middle of the night

310
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,231
You can't count on me much longer

311
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,666
I've decided to retire

312
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,306
Retirement? You're kidding!

313
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,407
You know my wife is losing her mind

314
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,376
and she's getting worse

315
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,707
Last week she grabbed someone's baby

316
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,211
and refused to return it

317
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,277
She even bit the mother's hand

318
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,379
She's getting worse. Understand?

319
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,046
If I carry on with you two

320
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,125
We'll all end up in jail sooner or later

321
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,420
Who'll take care of her then?

322
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,687
That was 20 years ago

323
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,124
You keep saying that!

324
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,030
I'm still responsible for what happened

325
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,729
What kind of father was I?

326
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,131
My son had high fever for 2 days

327
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,607
I didn't realise it was meningitis

328
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,076
I'm responsible for his death

329
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,181
We have no children. There is no hope

330
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,306
What else can I do?

331
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,673
Have another one

332
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,710
I can get Viagra at half price

333
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,377
OK?

334
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:58,781
Don't provoke him any more

335
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,286
Don't tell me what to do

336
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,552
It's time...

337
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:03,752
Straighten your shirt

338
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,493
Honey, you're late!

339
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,094
No. I'm not

340
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,539
You were at the top of the stairs yesterday

341
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,439
Now you're only on the third.
You don't love me anymore?

342
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,269
I'll hurry tomorrow

343
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:22,638
I love you very much

344
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,209
Your son

345
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,087
Hey! Did you pay your rent?

346
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,085
Of course! Ask him

347
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,257
They did

348
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,984
They're always sneaking around

349
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,524
What's the matter with them?

350
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,027
Don't hang out with them anymore

351
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,689
What? She knows about us?

352
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,364
We must do something about that

353
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,007
You're more capable than my Dad

354
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,048
I am not even fit to tie his shoelaces

355
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,379
He's one of the richest men in Asia

356
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:09,387
If I'm half the man he is it'd be wonderful

357
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,296
Dad will like you very much

358
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,262
I'm sure I'll like him very much too

359
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,423
and you, of course

360
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,034
Is my English getting better?

361
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,074
I need to grab a cigar from the car

362
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,437
Enjoy your dinner

363
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:30,706
Yan.,.

364
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:31,971
Keep an eye on her

365
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,644
Stop right there!

366
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:34,741
What the hell?

367
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
What's wrong with you?

368
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,284
You can't come here dressed as a chicken!

369
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,322
Think with your head if you want to spy on me

370
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,552
Forget it, I want a divorce

371
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:47,628
I'm working

372
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,724
I know that.
You'd better not be doing this for fun

373
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,727
I came because Fanny told me she saw you

374
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,035
Who's that inside?

375
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,401
Obviously she's a woman

376
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,738
My clients are either men or women

377
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,569
Can I only have male clients?

378
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,976
Divorce me if you don't trust me

379
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,114
You haven't been home for months. I miss you

380
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,278
Why?

381
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,220
I was stupid enough to marry you at 18

382
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,053
Look at this mess

383
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,717
I can't breathe

384
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,217
Never mind. Let's divorce

385
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,453
I'm sorry

386
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,796
Sorry for what? You have done me no wrong

387
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,631
Just feel sorry for yourself

388
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,003
Go back to school if you have time

389
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,470
If you know any better

390
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,074
You won't be dressed like this

391
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:34,270
What's the key to a marriage?

392
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,173
Trust

393
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,980
Space

394
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,708
You're suffocating me

395
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,608
I want a divorce

396
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,611
I can't

397
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,345
I'm pregnant

398
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,482
What?

399
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,617
Come again?

400
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,063
I'm pregnant

401
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,468
No way! When was the last time...

402
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,264
You were drunk that night and forgot to put on...

403
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,334
How could you?

404
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,136
You should have kicked me out of bed

405
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,074
I am ignorant about birth control

406
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,369
Really!

407
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,478
You know how I am with kids

408
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,418
I don't like them. If we have a child

409
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,423
We'll have no more privacy

410
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,591
Are you sure? Have you checked?

411
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,060
You can't be more than 3 months pregnant

412
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,590
Don't waste any time

413
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,528
Get an abortion in Shenzhen

414
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,225
You can't afford to wait

415
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,563
I love you!

416
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,070
Hurry!

417
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,640
You can't walk to Shenzhen dressed like that

418
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:49,742
Take a bus

419
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,583
Go back inside...

420
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,428
Tell me where is Thongs

421
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:05,725
He's dead

422
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,437
Don't get upset. Mind your health

423
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:12,767
The usual...

424
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,640
Spray paint and take some pictures

425
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,606
Shut the door and windows while you eat. OK?

426
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,182
Don't be mad

427
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,050
Sorry about that

428
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,350
Hey, Thongs Stay away from him

429
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,392
Came to visit your father? Y es

430
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,089
He's a disgrace to the village. Ignore him

431
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,621
PAY UP!

432
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,427
Please move along. Lady

433
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,559
Easy...

434
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,138
Hurry...

435
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,801
What's going on?

436
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,383
Just leave my family alone

437
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,352
But you were in hiding. Pal

438
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,580
How else can we find you?

439
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,246
What are you doing?

440
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,352
Hold on tight!

441
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:05,687
I'll pay when I can

442
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,494
I'll kill you if you bother my family again

443
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,024
Help him up

444
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,295
What's the occasion?

445
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:17,997
Everyone is here

446
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,168
Twins

447
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,403
Look how tall you are, Ting!

448
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,516
Come. I brought presents

449
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,413
These are all for you

450
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,777
Take what you like

451
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,120
This is for you

452
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,520
This is for you

453
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,089
Here's the pillow you wanted

454
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,789
and your heater

455
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,323
This is for you. Dad

456
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,229
A massager to ease your back pains

457
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,329
Why did you come back?

458
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,005
I thought you were dead

459
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,279
Stop cursing me like that. Dad

460
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,506
Look at you, a punk!

461
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,280
You were not like this when you were born

462
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:06,089
I wanted you to be a doctor or lawyer

463
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,021
I sent you to the best schools

464
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,128
But you turned out to be a loser

465
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,160
I may not be a lawyer, but I'm still your son

466
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,163
I wanted to be a professional, too

467
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,128
Even the President. But I'm not cut out for it

468
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,635
Your mother and I

469
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,205
saved up every dime

470
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,309
to put you through school

471
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,974
I tried. I just can't do it

472
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,377
Don't be so stubborn

473
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,383
Me? Stubborn?

474
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,408
I'm doing alright, Look at me

475
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,544
The hell you are

476
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,019
What have you been doing?

477
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,552
Gambling!

478
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,126
I'm a business man

479
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,331
Business? What business?

480
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:51,458
Whoring and gambling? You're a crook

481
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,639
You're nothing but a cheat

482
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,366
All you want is for me to make money

483
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,497
Don't start...

484
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,334
I'm making money now

485
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,139
I bought you everything you wanted

486
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,305
What's wrong with that? I earned every penny

487
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,280
Money isn't everything

488
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,648
I want you to be an honest man

489
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,282
I did nothing wrong

490
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,222
I don't know... what have I done?
What did I do wrong?

491
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,723
I wonder about these things

492
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,527
How and where you got them from

493
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,789
You probably stole them!

494
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,700
Take them away!

495
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,534
Out!

496
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,472
Dad...

497
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,630
Here, throw this away as well

498
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,698
Get out!

499
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:35,179
You'd better go You're not my son

500
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,677
I don't have an unworthy son like you

501
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,347
Nobody wants to see you

502
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,112
Take them away!

503
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:50,620
PAY UP!

504
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:24,684
Honey!

505
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,600
What is it, Honey?

506
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,105
Is this our bedroom?

507
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,703
Yes. Of course.

508
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,731
Are you sure?

509
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,711
Yes. It's our bedroom

510
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,811
We've been robbed!

511
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:43,711
What?

512
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,147
There's been a burglary!

513
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,175
Goddamn it. Who did this?

514
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,213
It's OK... Honey

515
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,683
At least our baby is safe

516
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,123
I'll clean up this mess. OK?

517
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,332
A burglary!

518
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,367
Landlord

519
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,242
What is it, Uncle?

520
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,010
I heard you're retiring, Made enough already?

521
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,174
I have a big one for you. Interested?

522
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,750
I never said I'm retiring. I'll take any job

523
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,070
Meet for a card game, Thongs

524
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,540
22:00, the usual place

525
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:53,008
Don't buy a car if you can't afford it

526
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,542
I was just kidding

527
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,680
This is for your troubles
You always make me do this

528
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:58,778
Stop being agitated No

529
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,582
Treat yourself to a massage No!

530
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,317
Come on... take it No!

531
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,621
Be like that, you goddamn midget!

532
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,329
You'll be towing cars for the rest of your life

533
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,567
and you'll have a midget son like you!

534
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,149
Did you crack my refrigerator. Octopus?

535
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,390
Is Thongs coming? What time is it?

536
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,054
There's a big job, I can't decide

537
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,995
I feel we should...

538
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,158
Been painting again?

539
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,561
Must you always wear white?

540
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,468
Did you crack my refrigerator?

541
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,634
Why are you so upset? The paint is on me!

542
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,608
You should see what I did to those thugs

543
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,005
What were you saying?

544
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,339
We have an assignment

545
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,575
I can't make up my mind

546
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,278
I'll do anything

547
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,487
This is really complicated

548
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:07,647
Though we'll be paid $7 million...

549
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:08,488
What? What?

550
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,461
$7 million? $7 million? To do what?

551
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,722
Just hear me out...

552
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,760
Cut the crap, let's do it
Listen to me...

553
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:19,196
I'll do anything for $7 million
$7 million. You've got to be kidding!

554
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,771
Start the car... Mind the door!

555
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,251
Watch where you're going

556
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,273
Help me

557
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,203
Landlord...

558
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,213
Give me a hand

559
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,271
You don't have to come with us

560
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,677
I must do this myself

561
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,076
Why is this such a big deal?

562
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:10,710
Never mind

563
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,383
Just open the door for me. I'll wait down here

564
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,129
Nothing! I bet they wore the jewellery

565
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,407
Just some foreign currency left

566
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,499
You're kidding...

567
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,501
Where's Landlord?

568
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,480
Probably cracking another safe

569
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,490
What a small world!

570
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:42,601
What's going on?

571
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,994
What are you doing?

572
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,327
Are you mad?

573
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,127
Just taking him back to his grandpa

574
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,326
Whose grandpa?

575
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,301
Shut up!

576
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,602
What? You lied to me too?

577
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,799
What did you feed him?

578
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:24,378
What is it?

579
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,478
There's a break-in!

580
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,720
Uncle, it's done

581
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,085
Is it Lobster Bay?

582
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,384
Roger that

583
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,369
Do you know what you're doing?

584
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,674
We agreed no raping, looting

585
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,544
arson and murder

586
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,012
This is someone else's family feud, stay out

587
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,580
We take the baby to his Grandpa

588
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,776
All it takes is 15 minutes for a blood test

589
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,279
What did you feed him? Nothing

590
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,182
Just sedative to help him sleep

591
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,516
Are you crazy?

592
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,453
You fed sedative to a baby!

593
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,621
Even burglars have ethics

594
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,230
You taught us that. Remember?

595
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,298
Ethics is for reference only

596
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,494
We need to improvise all the time

597
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,230
You should've told us the job involves a baby

598
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,466
I told you we need to talk

599
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,130
but once you heard about the $7 million

600
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,573
you pushed me into the car

601
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,074
and you even congratulated me

602
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,543
You didn't give me a chance

603
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,069
No way

604
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,338
What are you doing?

605
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,312
Take him back How can you say that?

606
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,110
I dare you to repeat that!

607
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,243
Take him back!

608
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,749
Who supported you all these years?

609
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,281
Who supported you all these years?

610
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,419
Who taught you to pick a lock?

611
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,617
And who taught you to crack a safe?

612
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,192
What will become of you without me?

613
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,221
You're nothing but a loser

614
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,029
And you, a womanizer

615
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,466
I'm sorry... do you know what happened to me?

616
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:47,593
Do you have any idea?

617
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:50,038
You know my wife is nuts

618
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,438
And I can barely see these days

619
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,305
I'm going blind, Do you understand?

620
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,311
K. Now why I had to do this myself?

621
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,473
Why must I do this?

622
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,242
Use your imagination

623
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:02,975
Rings any bell?

624
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,682
I've been robbed!

625
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:09,550
Some bastards cleaned out my $3 million!

626
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,288
I have nothing left...

627
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:15,057
Who'll support me?

628
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,064
Will you do it?

629
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,428
Can you support me?

630
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:27,269
Even I get burgled

631
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:31,472
I'm supposed to be a pro, Now I have nothing!

632
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,607
I can manage on my own

633
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,048
I know I can!

634
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,981
I don't need your help

635
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,078
Landlord

636
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,613
Get in

637
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,198
Let's go home and get some sleep

638
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,770
If I wasn't driving this piece of shit

639
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,303
You'll be eating my dust

640
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,326
Get out of the way, asshole!

641
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,124
If I let you overtake me in that car

642
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,219
I'm a real son of a bitch

643
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,001
Stop this nonsense! Careful with the kid

644
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,373
Are you crazy? Let him pass

645
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,178
Hello? Uncle?

646
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,645
Are you there yet?

647
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,241
Almost. And you?

648
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:14,508
5 more minutes

649
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,382
Some asshole is blocking the road

650
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,112
We're dueling with an asshole too

651
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,724
Don't be late, the buyer is punctual

652
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,015
No problem

653
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,358
Be careful and lose that asshole quick

654
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,052
Don't worry

655
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,158
I'm not nicknamed King of Monza for nothing

656
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,394
See you there!

657
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,772
Boss

658
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,047
I just want to know if the baby is ours

659
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,509
The others can go to hell

660
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,180
Listen, only the kid!

661
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,710
Y es. Boss

662
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,332
Excuse me, sir! You were speeding

663
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,427
Please wait here

664
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,531
See? What did I tell you?

665
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,332
For everyone's information

666
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,408
my license has been revoked 3 times

667
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,709
Your license has been revoked?

668
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,449
What's that got to do with being burglars?

669
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,214
You need to drive the get-away car. Pal

670
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,651
Get ready to swap

671
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,407
If things go wrong, kill the others

672
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,633
We only want the kid

673
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,135
The hardware's all loaded Brilliant!

674
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,119
Don't suck on it, blow!

675
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,325
Roll down the window, sir, Thank you

676
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,583
Roll down the window

677
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,489
Thanks for your cooperation

678
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,567
Please open the bag

679
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,158
What's inside?

680
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:15,427
What's inside?

681
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,497
This bag? Yes

682
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:17,598
Please open it

683
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,074
Thank you. Open up Sure

684
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,978
Please cooperate. Thank you

685
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,455
Back up! I'm holding a gun. Damn it!

686
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,461
Yes. Boss

687
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,621
Cut the posturing!

688
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,789
They're running the road block

689
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,632
Give chase! Go...

690
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,396
Run for it! Go

691
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:50,471
EU to headquarters...
A black sedan just fled from us

692
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,473
The mini van is getting away

693
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:56,702
Send a police van after them

694
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,212
Why is it so dark?

695
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,047
You forgot the lights!

696
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,454
You call this driving?

697
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:11,717
Check the kid

698
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,491
The kid? I held onto him the whole time

699
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,620
Okay...

700
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,156
I'm stuck

701
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,996
Can you move?

702
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,161
No. Don't mind me

703
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,770
The cops are coming, take the kid

704
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,070
To where? Your place?

705
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,233
Are you mad? Don't let my wife see him

706
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,299
What then?

707
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,333
Just go

708
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,744
Hurry, the cops are coming

709
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,279
They're coming...

710
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,246
I'll get out in a few days

711
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:36,408
Take care

712
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,510
Go!

713
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,489
Control! Traffic accident in Sai Kung

714
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,321
Send an ambulance. Someone's hurt

715
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,587
and a fire truck. Over!

716
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:49,763
Please cooperate

717
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,399
We ran into a road block, Boss

718
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:30,997
We don't have the kid

719
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,466
and we can't find Uncle

720
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,099
I want that kid!

721
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,206
I want that kid!

722
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:38,338
If you can't find him

723
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,648
prepare for your own funeral

724
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,343
Y es. Boss. We'll fix it

725
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,091
He hasn't stopped crying

726
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,259
What do you want?

727
00:43:58,736 --> 00:43:59,725
Just tell us

728
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,334
Humor him You do it

729
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:05,499
No. You do it! Hurry...

730
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,703
Shut up! Don't wake Landlady

731
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,102
What now?

732
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:19,678
What are you doing?

733
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,384
Put him to sleep

734
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,686
You'll kill him!

735
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:24,116
What else can we do?

736
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:25,217
Let's close the windows

737
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:27,754
Close the other one

738
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,263
What the hell do you want?

739
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,174
Hey! What are you doing?

740
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:39,569
He's fine, I left breathing space

741
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,599
Where's your common sense?

742
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,805
You'll kill him. He's just a baby

743
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,410
He'll be fine. I just want to muffle his noise

744
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,641
How can he be fine?

745
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,477
Hey, it works!

746
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:51,745
Carry on

747
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,086
It's working...

748
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,625
Keep it up... Yes!

749
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,189
Having fun? K. Eep it up!

750
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,500
Try something else. You're getting boring

751
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,505
Now try another trick

752
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,267
You didn't lock the door

753
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,505
What a surprise, Landlady!

754
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,039
Landlady?

755
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:19,211
I heard a baby's cry

756
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,175
Just doing the laundry...

757
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,277
Where's the baby?

758
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,150
No No?

759
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,098
Bite your tongue!

760
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,010
Where's my baby?

761
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,044
Don't you bully him

762
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:53,444
There's your baby

763
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,246
What a sucker!

764
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,724
Where's my Honey?

765
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:05,022
Where is he?

766
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,589
Landlord?

767
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,029
Where's my Honey?

768
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,456
Where is he?

769
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:12,692
He's gone to eat fondue

770
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,199
What kind of fondue? Where?

771
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,035
Shenzhen

772
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,404
For how long?
A month... no. A week

773
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:18,697
A week?

774
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,300
That'll kill him

775
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,444
Stop! Landlady...

776
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,379
Baby! Landlady!

777
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:33,018
Landlord is having fondue

778
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,450
for a day only. Not a week

779
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:36,616
He's there to close a deal

780
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,228
A big one. He'll be back soon

781
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,259
Yes... I think he told me

782
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,287
That's right...

783
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,128
Look! It's filthy! I'll clean up

784
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,433
I'll do it

785
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,370
It'll attract cockroaches, I know

786
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:51,696
And here...

787
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,266
I'll do it I'll do it

788
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,342
It's getting late

789
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:56,536
You should go to bed

790
00:46:57,014 --> 00:47:00,177
Clean up this mess

791
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,117
Sure. We'll clean the whole place up

792
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,585
Don't forget your laundry Bye

793
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,179
Where's the kid?

794
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,003
Damn! It won't stop!

795
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,496
Pull the plug!

796
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:27,707
Please don't cry! I'm begging you...

797
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,410
I'll offer you a sacrifice

798
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,204
Damn! Forgot to light it

799
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:31,976
This thing...

800
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,175
Chicken... it's great

801
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:34,711
Please don't cry...
Babies don't eat chicken

802
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,316
Please stop crying, Pity my ear-drums!

803
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,182
Have some chicken!

804
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:43,052
I'll knock him out with this

805
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,319
Let's give him a beer

806
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,121
He'll sleep better drunk

807
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,254
Drumstick...

808
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,161
Twinkle. Twinkle little star

809
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,358
How I wonder what you are

810
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,459
It's working!

811
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:55,368
Cut it out!

812
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,463
Keep singing

813
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,302
Sing anything. Hurry!

814
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,732
Hurry...

815
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,371
Fatso marries an expensive wife

816
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,242
We sharks are circling him left and right

817
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,146
With interest multiplying day by day

818
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:12,117
Our future has never looked so bright

819
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,381
You call that a song?

820
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,447
Then you do it

821
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,493
Wait! Let me strike my Elvis pose

822
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,654
Your mother re-married

823
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,292
a bearded fellow

824
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,493
with a scar on his butt

825
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:28,603
I love you. loving you...

826
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,572
like bees attracted to honey

827
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,506
No matter what happens

828
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,546
I will always love you

829
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,148
We wish you a Merry Christmas

830
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,615
We wish you a Merry Christmas

831
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:47,713

00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,459

And a Happy New Year

834
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:57,556
One little, two little. Three little Indians

835
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:01,465
Four little, five little. Six little Indians

836
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:05,605
Seven little. Eight little.
Nine little Indians...

837
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:14,350
This is local news at top of the hour...

838
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,543
There's a break-in at Tycoon Li's Peak mansion

839
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,750
Excuse me, officer

840
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,580
I need a favor...

841
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,057
I have a request

842
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,423
Hello?

843
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,068
Turn on the TV. Thongs

844
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:35,527
Now!

845
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:36,539
Thanks

846
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,041
According to the latest financial reports...

847
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:42,245
The Li family's net worth
is well over $50 billion

848
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,674
See that? He's not just a mongrel

849
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,707
He's a pedigree poodle

850
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:51,313
It's not regular price anymore

851
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,148
I'll jack it up when I get out

852
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,312
How long will it take?

853
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,652
A week at the most

854
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,252
I'm charged with dangerous driving

855
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,555
2 weeks tops

856
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,357
What? Who'll look after him?

857
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:04,396
No one except you, understand?

858
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:05,660
Wait till I get out

859
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,659
Bye-bye!

860
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,396
A week! My God...

861
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,064
It's not on!

862
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,099
Q, uiet...

863
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,435
Again?

864
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:17,736
What now?

865
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,241
Are you out of your mind?

866
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,379
What are you doing?

867
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,413
It stinks!

868
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:29,683
I don't believe this

869
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,418
He didn't even have much to eat

870
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,356
Don't shove it to me! There's shit everywhere

871
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:54,176
Eat this. Come on...

872
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,352
Y eah, good boy...

873
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,183
Baby! Baby!

874
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,984
Don't feed him just anything

875
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,286
How old is he?

876
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,450
How old? Yes!

877
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:06,291
How old?

878
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,456
5 to 6 months, I can tell

879
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,188
Who's the father?

880
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,291
He is

881
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,264
I see...

882
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,595
I know your kind

883
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:17,773
Y es. That's what we are

884
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,336
Don't worry. I have nothing against your kind

885
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,510
But men are so careless

886
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,080
Not this!

887
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:29,012
This is for 3 year-olds

888
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:33,188
No. This one doesn't have DHA

889
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:36,524
This is extra large!

890
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,526
His pee will leak from the side

891
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:41,187
No!

892
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:43,428
This is for breast enlargement

893
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,001
I need that, he wants a better feel

894
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,171
Don't complicate matters, just hurry!

895
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:50,737
Life is complicated

896
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,735
You are what you eat

897
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:55,544
What you feed and teach stay with him for life

898
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,236
You must take this seriously

899
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,440
Let me give you a lesson

900
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,605
I'll show you

901
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:03,118
Enough! Just hurry!

902
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,318
Whose napkins are these?

903
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:07,412
Napkins?

904
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,254
One with wings and one without...

905
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,291
One for day, one for night, which is it?

906
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,153
I want night time with no wings

907
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:14,387
Day time with wings for me

908
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:18,995
Just hurry...

909
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,093
Ready? Yes!

910
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,192
Drink this!

911
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,505
Is it too thick?

912
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,340
This is it

913
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:36,407
Hurry

914
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:39,277
Thanks!

915
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,389
We'll each take a class

916
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:42,547
Alright!

917
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,117
Thanks

918
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,619
Over there. Sir!

919
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,270
Help me please!

920
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:04,172
1.,. 2.,. 3

921
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,781
Sit down and relax

922
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:07,572
I don't get it. Can you show me again?

923
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,447
Carry on

924
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:12,346
Go home and teach your wife

925
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,223
Keep your back straight

926
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,124
Tighten your thighs and buttocks

927
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:20,218
Straighten the back? Y es

928
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,456
Is this straight enough?

929
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,121
Look! It's straight...

930
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,065
Keep it flat and straight

931
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,035
He's so cute! Yes!

932
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:29,365
How old is he?

933
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,234
A few months. I think

934
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,467
A few months? He's big

935
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:36,000
Where's his mother?

936
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,536
At work

937
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:38,603
You look after him alone?

938
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:41,310
That's wonderful!

939
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,742
So cute and loveable

940
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:52,152
We could have caught a taxi if you'd hurried

941
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:53,689
Shut up. Alright?

942
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:58,590
What a coincidence!

943
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,191
You just got off?

944
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,171
No. I work at the hospital

945
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,273
This is just part time

946
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:06,531
Chatting her up?

947
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,575
She was our instructor

948
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,204
What a cute baby!

949
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,418
Excuse me!

950
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:30,722
Where are you?

951
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,295
I'm with your Mom

952
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:34,470
Really? Put her on

953
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:35,660
What?

954
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:36,729
I can't hear you, Call me back

955
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,439
Hello? Hello!

956
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,735
Bitch!

957
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:45,615
Thank you...

958
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,313
Do stay in touch...

959
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,439
Bye-bye

960
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,020
You're not local?

961
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,024
I'm from Shaanxi

962
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,325
A student nurse on exchange

963
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,503
Dad had a stroke!

964
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:09,334
What?

965
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:10,396
He's in the hospital

966
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:11,562
Is it serious?

967
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,041
He's out of intensive care

968
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,139
I'll drop by after work

969
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:16,404
Hurry! Y es...

970
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:19,675
Where do you work?

971
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,084
Me?

972
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:25,154
This is my stop, talk to you later

973
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:26,721
Let's go!

974
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:37,494
I'm charged with running a road block.
Resisting arrest

975
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:38,556
and dangerous driving

976
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:39,590
They're refusing bail

977
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,672
But the lawyer said I'll be out next week

978
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:43,673
Next week?

979
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:47,234
Keep feeding the pedigree poodle

980
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,671
We're supposed to feed him well

981
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,272
And don't hand him over to anyone

982
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,648
Where is the poodle?

983
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:02,580
Oh my God!

984
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,263
It's the wrong bus!

985
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,435
Sorry...

986
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,407
Picture perfect! Give me a kiss!

987
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:57,535
It's your fault!

988
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,076
Are you alright?

989
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:05,746
Thanks

990
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:06,778
Don't hold him like that

991
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,988
Careful with his arm!

992
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:11,585
You're just plain negligent!

993
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,288
Leaving him behind on the bus

994
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,056
Can you help me?

995
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:09,609
Octopus!

996
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,690
I don't believe this!

997
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:27,329
How can he miss out by a whisker?

998
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,445
I should have known better

999
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:37,568
I lose money on him every time

1000
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,743
I do the dishes, you take a bath

1001
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,676
Let's take a bath together, OK?

1002
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,057
I'm rich!

1003
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,431
I've won. At last

1004
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:20,245
Isn't it fun?

1005
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,588
Hey!

1006
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,124
Can you believe this?

1007
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:56,023
Thanks so much. Melody

1008
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:57,448
If not for you

1009
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,723
We wouldn't know what to do with him

1010
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:01,663
Octopus and I are grateful

1011
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:04,463
Actually. I'm very grateful...

1012
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:24,976
So that's how he was revived

1013
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:51,337
Yan...

1014
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,112
Did you do what I told you to do?

1015
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,612
You don't have to go if you're busy

1016
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,196
Should I call her?

1017
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,229
Was I too harsh?

1018
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,104
This is Yan, I can't come to the phone right now

1019
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:21,301
Leave a message at the beep

1020
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:27,705
Alan!

1021
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:28,774
Long time no see, Thongs

1022
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:30,344
Your baby?

1023
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:31,985
Hey, stop it!

1024
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,113
Carry on...

1025
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:39,428
Come...

1026
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:43,054
Be a good boy!

1027
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,989
Don't do that!

1028
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,262
Thongs. What's your game?

1029
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:47,731
Get out if you're not playing!

1030
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:49,536
Don't bring a kid in here!

1031
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,695
Get lost!

1032
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:55,002
Life is complicated. You are what you eat

1033
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:57,510
What you feed and teach stay with him for life

1034
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:59,046
You must take this seriously

1035
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,739
Thongs. Are you in or not?

1036
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:03,577
Go home and babysit!

1037
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:05,611
Get lost!

1038
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:07,517
I'm not playing

1039
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,081
Loser!

1040
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:11,315
Cleaned out already?

1041
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,725
No. He was crying too much

1042
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,325
Yes. That's a good boy

1043
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,229
How about just one bet?

1044
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:21,258
Just one?

1045
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:26,499
No more gambling

1046
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,475
I quit.,.

1047
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,172
You're worse than my Dad!

1048
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,072
I really don't know

1049
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,708
I've been calling Landlord all night

1050
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,179
I'm a man of my word

1051
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,346
I'll fix it for you

1052
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,183
I just want the boy!

1053
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,352
Let me out...

1054
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,292
Is this a joke?

1055
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:55,771
Landlord has 2 partners in crime

1056
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,573
Thongs and Octopus

1057
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:00,604
Let me out!

1058
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:02,572
Thongs and Octopus

1059
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:05,704
I don't care what you do, find them

1060
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:25,064
I found them. Boss. They're inside
Very good! Now we change the diaper

1061
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,429
Are you Thongs?

1062
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,131
Give me the baby

1063
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,442
What baby? Don't play dumb

1064
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,052
I don't know any Uncles

1065
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,143
Don't play dumb with me

1066
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:47,178
What is it?

1067
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,348
They're looking for Baby

1068
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:51,056
My name is Baby, looking for me?

1069
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,753
Damn! You're asking for it!

1070
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:20,586
Go!

1071
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:49,106
What's the matter with you?

1072
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:50,446
Nothing. I just over jumped

1073
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:11,499
What did they say?

1074
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,774
Who cares? Let's go

1075
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,118
Remember? Yes

1076
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:35,024
Ring the bell. When he opens the door...

1077
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:36,562
I'll splash the paint on your cue

1078
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,124
Let him have it!

1079
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:39,527
Yes

1080
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,430
Wait!

1081
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:55,244
Thongs. Don't hide behind women and babies

1082
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,577
I won't spare you!

1083
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,686
I don't understand a word you're saying

1084
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:03,083
Thongs is my buddy

1085
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,522
He's not here right now. Come back later

1086
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,423
No problem. We'll wait for him inside

1087
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,529
He's my kid brother

1088
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,022
Nice to meet you

1089
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:18,635
There's no one here

1090
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,407
Fanny, I'm scared

1091
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,138
Is it worse than abortion?

1092
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,515
Ask him about the future?

1093
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,989
Confront him with the ultrasound

1094
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:39,253
Be good

1095
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:42,688
Who are you looking for?

1096
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:46,633
Octopus

1097
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,531
He is not here, come back later

1098
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:50,530
You'd better come in first

1099
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:21,260
Thongs

1100
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:30,235
Make sure the baby is home

1101
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,178
What's that look on your face?

1102
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:38,684
Toothache

1103
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:41,088
Why is Octopus off in such a hurry?

1104
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,417
He needs to use the toilet

1105
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:43,685
You live here? Y es

1106
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:45,285
I love to come up for a chat

1107
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,252
Steve!

1108
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,596
Octopus! Thongs...

1109
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:56,693
You've finally shown up!

1110
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,198
I'm tired of leaving messages on you voicemail

1111
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:01,700
Leave! I'll tend to you later

1112
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,068
Come here...

1113
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:04,735
Where's the baby?

1114
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,475
In your room. Who are they?

1115
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:07,638
Decorators

1116
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,490
My flat is a mess

1117
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:22,521
What's with the paint?

1118
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,492
We're renovating, just trying out the colors

1119
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:28,494
What is it, Yan?

1120
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,028
Oh. No!

1121
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,532
Talk to the officer

1122
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,275
What is it, Miss?

1123
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:36,537
Thongs...

1124
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,603
The police can help you with any problem

1125
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:41,512
There's a cop in there! Go to the roof

1126
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:44,448
Sit down and tell me your problem

1127
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,218
Meet my good friend

1128
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,018
Inspector Steve Mok

1129
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:53,154
He's my... cousin

1130
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,320
He's my... other cousin

1131
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:57,688
We came to show him...

1132
01:08:57,733 --> 01:08:59,530
the color sample

1133
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:01,091
Your face...

1134
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,536
I'm into body art

1135
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,081
What's with all the baby stuff?

1136
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:24,358
You know my pal Octopus...

1137
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,327
He's a born womanizer

1138
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:29,090
He got someone pregnant

1139
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:30,754
Can't do much about that

1140
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,327
Where is he now?

1141
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:33,728
In the toilet

1142
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,194
I need to go too

1143
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:36,360
You do?

1144
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,097
I'm investigating a break-in

1145
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:39,263
K. Now anything about it?

1146
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:41,035
I've quit long time ago

1147
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:43,268
Octopus. Inspector wants to have a word

1148
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,002
Hurry up

1149
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:47,576
Octopus...

1150
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:49,673
What took you so long?

1151
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:50,707
You're here?

1152
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,248
Your turn

1153
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,084
Not after him, it stinks in there

1154
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:02,756
You have a friend in there

1155
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:04,288
Friend?

1156
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:16,238
He's my cousin too

1157
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:18,707
I'm the eldest

1158
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:23,676
Then let's reminisce

1159
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:32,082
Never met each other?

1160
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,525
Of course they have

1161
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:43,603
Take care of this, Octopus

1162
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,007
Why are you still here? I want a divorce!

1163
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:47,598
What the hell is this?

1164
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,439
Never mind. I want a divorce

1165
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:50,567
You...

1166
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,540
And you...

1167
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:00,380
It sounds complicated

1168
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:03,251
Yes. Very complicated

1169
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:05,216
Thongs. We've been friends for so long

1170
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,362
I didn't know you have cousins of different races

1171
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,260
My Dad was a sailor...

1172
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:11,661
He must have stopped in India

1173
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:16,662
That'll make him your brother

1174
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:18,063
That's not right

1175
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:20,512
Maybe the sailor was his Grandpa

1176
01:11:20,857 --> 01:11:22,381
Or his mother's father

1177
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,829
What's the matter with you?

1178
01:11:46,749 --> 01:11:47,773
What's wrong?

1179
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:49,942
I have occasional

1180
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:51,953
muscle spasms

1181
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:54,852
Muscle spasms?

1182
01:12:03,499 --> 01:12:04,488
Well?

1183
01:12:04,534 --> 01:12:05,660
Cramps...

1184
01:12:05,702 --> 01:12:07,636
You're probably possessed! Give me a hand

1185
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:13,431
Baby...

1186
01:12:16,012 --> 01:12:17,707
Hold on...

1187
01:12:24,921 --> 01:12:26,855
Help me. Thongs!

1188
01:12:30,827 --> 01:12:32,294
Give us a hand!

1189
01:12:33,029 --> 01:12:34,053
I'd like to...

1190
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:35,554
I can use my mouth

1191
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,261
Catch! Beat it!

1192
01:12:45,842 --> 01:12:47,935
You won't get away with this!

1193
01:12:53,049 --> 01:12:54,676
You have a lot of nerve. Thongs

1194
01:12:55,952 --> 01:12:57,283
Hurry up!

1195
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,051
Oh no!

1196
01:12:59,789 --> 01:13:02,053
They're inside. Go get them!

1197
01:13:51,574 --> 01:13:52,563
Mind your head!

1198
01:13:57,413 --> 01:13:58,402
You're so greedy

1199
01:14:07,356 --> 01:14:09,051
Listen to me, Steve

1200
01:14:09,392 --> 01:14:10,416
You can confess at the station

1201
01:14:11,527 --> 01:14:12,858
I'll turn myself in afterwards

1202
01:14:12,895 --> 01:14:13,884
Who'd believe you?

1203
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:19,323
Are you alright?

1204
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:21,594
Just worry about yourself!

1205
01:14:32,749 --> 01:14:33,738
Don't hit my head

1206
01:14:33,783 --> 01:14:34,772
Thongs!

1207
01:14:35,284 --> 01:14:36,410
Stay back!

1208
01:14:37,987 --> 01:14:38,976
Should have listened to me

1209
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:56,062
I'll get you, Thongs!

1210
01:15:18,728 --> 01:15:19,990
Octopus! Run!

1211
01:15:23,466 --> 01:15:24,694
Come back!

1212
01:15:30,673 --> 01:15:33,005
Alright...

1213
01:15:35,578 --> 01:15:37,068
Get up! After the truck!

1214
01:15:42,752 --> 01:15:43,741
Stop!

1215
01:15:57,433 --> 01:15:58,593
Stop!

1216
01:16:16,919 --> 01:16:18,511
Police! I need to use your bike!

1217
01:16:18,654 --> 01:16:19,746
Go...

1218
01:16:19,956 --> 01:16:21,890
What? It's not mine

1219
01:16:21,924 --> 01:16:22,856
I'm on learner's permit

1220
01:16:22,892 --> 01:16:24,689
I'll ask the Commissioner

1221
01:16:24,827 --> 01:16:26,488
to grant you a proper license! Go!

1222
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:27,823
Really? Yes!

1223
01:16:36,839 --> 01:16:38,033
Mind if I ask...

1224
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:40,034
What did you use to drive?

1225
01:16:40,443 --> 01:16:41,569
I'm just a video gamer!

1226
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:00,524
Shit!

1227
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:03,724
Someone is tailing us

1228
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:04,822
Looks like a robber to me

1229
01:17:04,867 --> 01:17:07,335
In broad daylight? Now what?

1230
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:09,370
Don't worry. Call Headquarters

1231
01:17:09,538 --> 01:17:10,630
Ask for back up

1232
01:17:10,873 --> 01:17:11,999
Come in. Headquarters...

1233
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:14,605
This is 3321. Daniel calling

1234
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:16,710
Suspected robbery in progress!

1235
01:17:16,812 --> 01:17:17,801
Stop the car. Kid!

1236
01:17:18,414 --> 01:17:19,403
Who are you calling a kid?

1237
01:17:19,448 --> 01:17:20,710
I can tell that you're a thief!

1238
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:36,828
Having serious fun? I'll...

1239
01:17:36,966 --> 01:17:38,433
Ram your butt!

1240
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:55,641
Move closer... Easy. Slow down a bit...

1241
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,582
What? Another one?

1242
01:17:59,789 --> 01:18:01,620
On a motorbike?

1243
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:03,983
Stop the car! Stop

1244
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,349
He's cute!

1245
01:18:18,374 --> 01:18:19,363
Hop over!

1246
01:18:21,477 --> 01:18:23,468
The Commissioner will be in touch

1247
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:24,703
Bye!

1248
01:18:27,383 --> 01:18:28,907
That way! After him!

1249
01:18:41,597 --> 01:18:42,586
Free the pushchair!

1250
01:18:42,631 --> 01:18:44,428
Do you think I'm sunbathing?

1251
01:18:49,505 --> 01:18:50,802
Almost there!

1252
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:53,740
Move closer...

1253
01:18:54,043 --> 01:18:55,032
Stop! Turn...

1254
01:18:55,077 --> 01:18:56,567
Turn... ram him!

1255
01:19:36,352 --> 01:19:37,341
Thank God!

1256
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:38,409
Watch out!

1257
01:19:41,023 --> 01:19:42,422
You call yourself a driver?

1258
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:48,524
Thank God! That was close

1259
01:19:49,965 --> 01:19:51,933
Everything's fine

1260
01:19:52,301 --> 01:19:53,563
Back up was quick!

1261
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:56,528
Thanks to you

1262
01:19:58,774 --> 01:19:59,798
Where are you from?

1263
01:20:02,778 --> 01:20:04,541
I'm from Broke Broke Mountain!

1264
01:20:10,386 --> 01:20:11,614
I'm a cop, kid

1265
01:20:11,787 --> 01:20:13,311
I need to use your bike

1266
01:20:13,789 --> 01:20:14,915
You're nuts

1267
01:20:16,926 --> 01:20:18,587
I dare you to say that again

1268
01:20:20,062 --> 01:20:21,996
Everything is taken care of, keep in touch

1269
01:20:22,331 --> 01:20:23,320
Thanks

1270
01:20:40,816 --> 01:20:42,306
This is Octopus, if you need me...

1271
01:20:42,351 --> 01:20:43,716
Leave a message after the tone

1272
01:20:52,428 --> 01:20:54,362
IOU

1273
01:20:57,566 --> 01:20:59,864
Let's pay off Thongs' debts

1274
01:21:06,008 --> 01:21:08,772
Don't worry. Dad. Here's my contribution

1275
01:21:29,999 --> 01:21:32,297
What happened to you? Uncle...

1276
01:21:32,835 --> 01:21:34,325
You've turned into an ice-lolly

1277
01:21:37,806 --> 01:21:39,967
Boss, I can explain...

1278
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:41,970
We're men of honour...

1279
01:21:42,311 --> 01:21:43,403
We never renege

1280
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,747
We always keep our word

1281
01:21:45,881 --> 01:21:47,542
Never break a promise

1282
01:21:47,683 --> 01:21:48,843
One for all, and...

1283
01:21:48,984 --> 01:21:49,973
All for you!

1284
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:54,050
$30 millions

1285
01:21:54,456 --> 01:21:56,981
Thirty... Million...

1286
01:21:57,826 --> 01:22:00,522
That's my offer, take it or leave it

1287
01:22:00,829 --> 01:22:03,491
Money is nothing between you and me

1288
01:22:03,599 --> 01:22:04,588
Whatever you say

1289
01:22:09,004 --> 01:22:09,993
Who is it?

1290
01:22:10,072 --> 01:22:11,061
It's me

1291
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:12,729
You're home!

1292
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:14,840
Who's the kid? He's crying like crazy

1293
01:22:15,277 --> 01:22:16,938
Check him out for me

1294
01:22:20,916 --> 01:22:22,349
Well?

1295
01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:24,882
You need to change him and he's running a fever

1296
01:22:25,354 --> 01:22:27,015
Fever? Yes!

1297
01:22:27,323 --> 01:22:28,483
What shall I do? Take him to a doctor

1298
01:22:28,857 --> 01:22:30,722
Take him to a doctor?

1299
01:22:30,826 --> 01:22:31,850
Hurry!

1300
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:33,483
Landlord?

1301
01:22:33,729 --> 01:22:34,718
I'm free

1302
01:22:34,763 --> 01:22:35,787
Thank God for that

1303
01:22:36,398 --> 01:22:37,387
Where are you now?

1304
01:22:37,733 --> 01:22:38,961
On my way to the hospital

1305
01:22:39,435 --> 01:22:40,424
Hospital? What happened?

1306
01:22:40,536 --> 01:22:41,525
The baby is sick

1307
01:22:42,538 --> 01:22:43,766
Tell Octopus to meet us there

1308
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:02,348
Thongs?

1309
01:23:06,495 --> 01:23:07,723
Be careful. Dad

1310
01:23:13,269 --> 01:23:14,258
What happened?

1311
01:23:14,303 --> 01:23:16,828
I called you about Dad's stroke

1312
01:23:17,006 --> 01:23:18,303
You're too busy to care

1313
01:23:52,308 --> 01:23:53,434
I'm sorry. Dad

1314
01:23:58,514 --> 01:23:59,640
Take good care of Dad

1315
01:24:03,085 --> 01:24:04,416
Are you alright?

1316
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,289
The fever broke

1317
01:24:14,496 --> 01:24:16,396
The doctor said he'll be fine

1318
01:24:17,266 --> 01:24:18,255
Thanks

1319
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,426
You don't have to worry

1320
01:24:20,803 --> 01:24:21,792
I...

1321
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:23,564
You don't have to explain

1322
01:24:24,073 --> 01:24:25,563
No matter what

1323
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:28,307
You saved his life

1324
01:24:30,412 --> 01:24:32,403
Wait here, I'll get his prescription

1325
01:24:32,681 --> 01:24:34,512
Thanks

1326
01:24:42,524 --> 01:24:43,513
It's OK.

1327
01:24:47,663 --> 01:24:49,927
There you are, Thongs

1328
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,800
Don't do anything stupid

1329
01:24:53,836 --> 01:24:54,734
There's a baby...

1330
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:55,930
Watch the baby!

1331
01:24:56,004 --> 01:24:56,993
I have a baby too

1332
01:24:57,673 --> 01:24:58,662
Let go

1333
01:24:58,707 --> 01:24:59,696
You let go

1334
01:25:00,943 --> 01:25:01,932
Together on a count to three

1335
01:25:02,044 --> 01:25:03,807
1, 2.3

1336
01:25:05,013 --> 01:25:06,480
Don't cry

1337
01:25:09,685 --> 01:25:10,709
About the loan...

1338
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,683
I'm not in the mood for that

1339
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:15,648
But you grabbed me...

1340
01:25:16,592 --> 01:25:18,492
Just occupational reflex

1341
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:21,796
What's wrong with your baby?

1342
01:25:22,898 --> 01:25:26,390
Measles. He won't drink his milk

1343
01:25:26,869 --> 01:25:28,496
Boil some carrots

1344
01:25:28,604 --> 01:25:31,004
water chestnuts and barley

1345
01:25:31,473 --> 01:25:32,462
Give him the juice

1346
01:25:32,908 --> 01:25:33,897
What?

1347
01:25:33,942 --> 01:25:35,910
Just tell his mother to make it

1348
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:38,707
His mother? She ran off

1349
01:25:40,282 --> 01:25:41,442
What about his mother...

1350
01:25:42,418 --> 01:25:43,476
His mother?

1351
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,746
Gone as well

1352
01:25:48,557 --> 01:25:50,718
Where did you get his clothes?

1353
01:25:50,893 --> 01:25:51,917
Anywhere

1354
01:25:51,994 --> 01:25:54,326
$80 at the convenient store, 10% off

1355
01:25:54,863 --> 01:25:56,330
$72?

1356
01:25:56,565 --> 01:25:58,430
A further 10% off with a discount card

1357
01:25:58,834 --> 01:26:01,428
That's $64. 80

1358
01:26:01,637 --> 01:26:02,626
Do you have a discount card?

1359
01:26:02,871 --> 01:26:03,997
Here, take mine

1360
01:26:08,577 --> 01:26:09,942
I'll forfeit today's interest

1361
01:26:10,946 --> 01:26:13,471
But I'll start chasing tomorrow

1362
01:26:13,649 --> 01:26:15,014
Come on!

1363
01:26:15,317 --> 01:26:16,545
Just doing my job

1364
01:26:22,825 --> 01:26:23,814
Thongs

1365
01:26:27,729 --> 01:26:28,753
Landlord

1366
01:26:28,897 --> 01:26:30,023
Here's my million dollar poodle

1367
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:32,992
Let's get a suite and talk

1368
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:42,706
Hurry...

1369
01:26:43,412 --> 01:26:44,606
Now that you're here. Let's talk

1370
01:26:45,047 --> 01:26:46,947
Do you know how much more

1371
01:26:47,349 --> 01:26:49,442
I have bargained for you for this poodle?

1372
01:26:49,718 --> 01:26:50,810
I give you 3 guesses

1373
01:26:53,455 --> 01:26:54,649
$30 millions

1374
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:57,424
$30 millions!

1375
01:26:58,727 --> 01:27:00,456
This $5 millions is just the deposit

1376
01:27:00,963 --> 01:27:03,261
We deliver in 3 hours

1377
01:27:03,398 --> 01:27:06,333
and we get $25 millions more!
It's too good to be true

1378
01:27:08,036 --> 01:27:09,799
Give him this glucose later

1379
01:27:10,672 --> 01:27:13,072
It's not necessary, now that his fever broke

1380
01:27:13,742 --> 01:27:14,902
What?

1381
01:27:14,977 --> 01:27:16,774
You two have become nannies now?

1382
01:27:18,847 --> 01:27:19,973
It can't be

1383
01:27:21,917 --> 01:27:22,941
What is this?

1384
01:27:24,286 --> 01:27:26,015
3 Ferraris

1385
01:27:27,623 --> 01:27:28,647
What are you thinking?

1386
01:27:28,891 --> 01:27:32,349
Your own casino. Bigger than Monte Carlo

1387
01:27:32,995 --> 01:27:34,553
Come on!

1388
01:27:36,532 --> 01:27:38,523
Give us a chance

1389
01:27:38,634 --> 01:27:43,833
No matter what you want

1390
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,705
We'll do it

1391
01:27:48,043 --> 01:27:52,810
Just don't hurt our baby

1392
01:27:54,783 --> 01:27:55,807
There's nothing to watch on TV

1393
01:27:57,085 --> 01:27:58,609
You think she'll recognize him?

1394
01:27:58,954 --> 01:28:00,683
You're worried she'll recognize the baby?

1395
01:28:00,822 --> 01:28:02,346
This baby is barely...

1396
01:28:02,424 --> 01:28:03,413
I need some fresh air

1397
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:04,322
One of 100 a day

1398
01:28:04,359 --> 01:28:05,917
They all look the same

1399
01:28:06,028 --> 01:28:07,723
Everyone says he takes after his father.
I disagree

1400
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:08,818
She won't be able to tell, understand?

1401
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:11,849
We offer specialty sashimi

1402
01:28:11,951 --> 01:28:14,442

Hey... Miss

1410
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,632
You have to speak louder

1411
01:28:35,909 --> 01:28:37,900
Louder!

1412
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:42,370

01:29:07,073 --> 01:29:09,268
Darling...

1419
01:29:09,409 --> 01:29:11,707
I'm sorry

1420
01:29:12,645 --> 01:29:16,172
I don't deserve to be your husband...

1421
01:29:16,683 --> 01:29:19,516
So long,.,

1422
01:29:41,541 --> 01:29:44,032
Here you are. Madam

1423
01:29:46,546 --> 01:29:47,979
Honey!

1424
01:29:48,081 --> 01:29:49,343
Darling!

1425
01:29:49,482 --> 01:29:51,450
Silly. Why the tears?

1426
01:29:51,518 --> 01:29:54,646
You called from a hospital. What's going on?

1427
01:29:54,754 --> 01:29:57,723
Are you okay? I'm fine. Dear

1428
01:29:58,024 --> 01:29:59,719
What happened to your glasses?

1429
01:30:00,026 --> 01:30:01,721
I got run over by a bike on my way here

1430
01:30:01,995 --> 01:30:03,394
and cracked the lenses

1431
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:04,724
Get me a new pair tomorrow

1432
01:30:05,064 --> 01:30:06,088
Good girl

1433
01:30:06,199 --> 01:30:08,565
Now close your eyes. I have something for you

1434
01:30:08,601 --> 01:30:09,397
No peeking

1435
01:30:09,436 --> 01:30:11,563
Take a step back...

1436
01:30:11,704 --> 01:30:14,730
Honey, here's something you'll cherish

1437
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:17,475
Ready...

1438
01:30:22,248 --> 01:30:23,738
Lower your arm

1439
01:30:23,983 --> 01:30:26,611
Right. Now the other one

1440
01:30:28,121 --> 01:30:30,521
Now open your eyes

1441
01:30:37,797 --> 01:30:41,164
Not so loud. You'll scare him

1442
01:30:42,035 --> 01:30:44,526
Baby...

1443
01:30:44,604 --> 01:30:48,040
Mommie missed you

1444
01:30:54,647 --> 01:30:56,774
Honey...

1445
01:30:58,251 --> 01:31:03,018
Have I been a burden to you?

1446
01:31:03,122 --> 01:31:04,282
Don't be silly

1447
01:31:04,424 --> 01:31:07,188
You made me very happy

1448
01:31:07,293 --> 01:31:12,356
You're my most precious darling

1449
01:31:14,767 --> 01:31:17,827
Not so loud. You're waking him

1450
01:31:18,104 --> 01:31:20,402
Good baby

1451
01:31:48,401 --> 01:31:50,835
I'm returning him tomorrow

1452
01:31:51,070 --> 01:31:54,471
I have sorted out the baby formula

1453
01:31:54,574 --> 01:31:56,474
So nice to be a baby

1454
01:31:56,609 --> 01:31:59,373
Eat, sleep. Drink and shit

1455
01:31:59,479 --> 01:32:01,447
So happy

1456
01:32:01,548 --> 01:32:05,177
and without a care in the world

1457
01:32:05,685 --> 01:32:07,744
Right?

1458
01:32:08,521 --> 01:32:10,614
Right!

1459
01:32:13,693 --> 01:32:18,357
Why do you trust me? You know I'm a burglar

1460
01:32:18,464 --> 01:32:21,365
still you made friends with me

1461
01:32:23,703 --> 01:32:25,830
Actually...

1462
01:32:26,339 --> 01:32:29,706
The first time I saw you

1463
01:32:29,776 --> 01:32:32,574
I knew you have a conscience

1464
01:32:34,447 --> 01:32:37,848
If you have a chance to start over

1465
01:32:38,151 --> 01:32:40,585
Will you still be a burglar?

1466
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:42,581
It's too late for that now

1467
01:32:42,655 --> 01:32:47,183
You can start from this very second

1468
01:32:47,293 --> 01:32:50,353
It's never too late

1469
01:32:56,235 --> 01:32:58,396
Look at me

1470
01:32:59,272 --> 01:33:01,433
Look me in the eye

1471
01:33:02,241 --> 01:33:04,300
I've faith in you

1472
01:33:15,855 --> 01:33:19,552
It's Mommie

1473
01:33:19,692 --> 01:33:22,559
Daddy... Cut it out!

1474
01:33:22,662 --> 01:33:24,289
Mommie

1475
01:33:24,397 --> 01:33:26,695
Daddy...

1476
01:33:29,702 --> 01:33:31,192
Daddy...

1477
01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:33,704
Do you know his name?

1478
01:33:33,773 --> 01:33:35,798
Why do you want to know?

1479
01:33:36,476 --> 01:33:39,309
Just curious at what will happen

1480
01:33:39,445 --> 01:33:42,778
What do you think will happen to him?

1481
01:34:02,935 --> 01:34:04,596
I got the money

1482
01:34:04,704 --> 01:34:06,934
Bring the kid

1483
01:34:09,442 --> 01:34:12,309
Someone will fetch you in 5 minutes

1484
01:34:35,868 --> 01:34:37,267
Wait here!

1485
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:38,997
Open the gate!

1486
01:34:52,018 --> 01:34:55,579
Where is he? Give me the baby!

1487
01:34:55,688 --> 01:34:59,556
Thirty... Million...

1488
01:35:04,797 --> 01:35:06,890
Give me the baby

1489
01:35:07,533 --> 01:35:08,557
Listen...

1490
01:35:08,668 --> 01:35:11,034
Feed him milk every 4 hours

1491
01:35:11,337 --> 01:35:13,362
Check the temperature with the back of your hand

1492
01:35:13,506 --> 01:35:14,768
or you'll scald him. Understand?

1493
01:35:14,874 --> 01:35:15,898
Also, everyday at noon...

1494
01:35:15,942 --> 01:35:17,876
He needs his orange juice. Get it?

1495
01:35:17,944 --> 01:35:19,571
He chokes easily since he has no teeth

1496
01:35:19,712 --> 01:35:21,304
even crushed fruits will choke him

1497
01:35:21,414 --> 01:35:23,405
If you feed him solid food. You must chew...

1498
01:35:23,516 --> 01:35:24,574
Don't be such a nag

1499
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:25,639
Also

1500
01:35:25,685 --> 01:35:27,915
Hold him with your left arm or he'll cry

1501
01:35:28,788 --> 01:35:30,551
Give him congee in the afternoon

1502
01:35:30,656 --> 01:35:33,682
Chop up some lean pork, finely diced

1503
01:35:33,793 --> 01:35:35,351
Not too cold. Not too hot

1504
01:35:35,461 --> 01:35:37,395
Serve in two separate bowls

1505
01:35:38,498 --> 01:35:41,729
Okay. Okay. Just hand him over

1506
01:35:41,868 --> 01:35:43,563
Alright

1507
01:35:44,003 --> 01:35:45,402
Be careful I will

1508
01:35:45,505 --> 01:35:46,563
Here, take this bottle too

1509
01:35:46,672 --> 01:35:47,900
The temperature is right I got it...

1510
01:35:47,974 --> 01:35:49,635
Don't rock him too hard

1511
01:35:49,742 --> 01:35:51,073
It's time to feed him Enough

1512
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:53,608
I wonder if he'll survive the night

1513
01:36:02,088 --> 01:36:03,680
What are you staring at?

1514
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:05,382
Get lost

1515
01:36:15,034 --> 01:36:16,592
Come on. Let's go

1516
01:36:16,736 --> 01:36:18,067
What are you doing?

1517
01:36:18,104 --> 01:36:19,435
Don't worry

1518
01:36:19,572 --> 01:36:22,541
They have doctors and nurses, he'll be fine

1519
01:36:22,608 --> 01:36:24,769
It's just family squabbles

1520
01:36:24,911 --> 01:36:26,640
They're taking take him to his Grandpa

1521
01:36:26,779 --> 01:36:29,771
Think about your Ferrari and your casino

1522
01:36:29,849 --> 01:36:33,118
Come on!

1523
01:36:56,442 --> 01:36:58,637
Get the car ready Yes!

1524
01:37:05,484 --> 01:37:06,849
Finished?

1525
01:37:06,886 --> 01:37:07,875
Let's go

1526
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,751
Take him upstairs

1527
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:13,180
Daddy

1528
01:38:16,188 --> 01:38:18,816
Mommie

1529
01:38:28,467 --> 01:38:29,456
Daddy's coming!

1530
01:38:29,502 --> 01:38:30,935
Mommie's coming!

1531
01:38:40,613 --> 01:38:42,581
Get the kid!

1532
01:38:44,951 --> 01:38:45,940
Give me the baby! It's not our fault...

1533
01:38:45,985 --> 01:38:48,510
I know. Hand me the baby...

1534
01:38:48,621 --> 01:38:50,145
Good boy

1535
01:38:53,726 --> 01:38:54,954
Landlord!

1536
01:38:55,061 --> 01:38:56,892
Wait for us!

1537
01:39:00,066 --> 01:39:01,931
He took off!

1538
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:05,594
Open up!

1539
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:09,804
Give me the baby!

1540
01:39:30,963 --> 01:39:32,863
Turn on the machine

1541
01:39:32,932 --> 01:39:35,093
Hurry! Send someone to the ferris wheel

1542
01:39:35,234 --> 01:39:37,202
Yes. Sir!

1543
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:46,571
Oh my God!

1544
01:39:59,825 --> 01:40:01,315
Baby!

1545
01:40:01,627 --> 01:40:03,151
Baby!

1546
01:40:03,229 --> 01:40:05,993
Where are you. Baby?

1547
01:40:06,866 --> 01:40:08,993
Mommie

1548
01:40:14,974 --> 01:40:18,569
Don't move. I'm coming up!

1549
01:40:18,744 --> 01:40:20,769
Mommie

1550
01:40:51,644 --> 01:40:54,374
Stay right there...

1551
01:40:54,713 --> 01:40:56,613
I'm here

1552
01:41:11,063 --> 01:41:12,724
Baby!

1553
01:41:12,932 --> 01:41:14,729
Baby!

1554
01:41:19,004 --> 01:41:20,904
Daddy

1555
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,064
It's not funny!

1556
01:41:22,208 --> 01:41:24,733
Great job. Thongs! You deserve a kiss!

1557
01:41:24,977 --> 01:41:29,073
Don't hurt the baby. Morons!

1558
01:41:29,248 --> 01:41:30,272
Daddy!

1559
01:41:30,349 --> 01:41:32,840
Run, Daddy!

1560
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,934
Hurry up and get in!

1561
01:42:38,184 --> 01:42:40,175
Isn't it fun?

1562
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:41,911
Then let's continue

1563
01:42:41,987 --> 01:42:43,955
Get the kid!

1564
01:42:44,023 --> 01:42:45,718
Send the other train!

1565
01:43:18,524 --> 01:43:20,788
Don't worry

1566
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:24,361
I'll get it back for you

1567
01:43:29,168 --> 01:43:31,033
Thongs!

1568
01:43:31,103 --> 01:43:33,901
I only want the boy!

1569
01:43:34,039 --> 01:43:36,530
Come out...

1570
01:43:36,875 --> 01:43:39,207
or I'll drop him!

1571
01:43:39,311 --> 01:43:42,371
We all die sooner or later

1572
01:43:42,448 --> 01:43:45,508
It's a matter of going in style

1573
01:43:45,784 --> 01:43:48,412
Take the baby and go, Don't mind me!

1574
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:51,045
I doubt if he'll drop me

1575
01:43:52,491 --> 01:43:55,392
Thongs! On the count to 10...

1576
01:43:55,494 --> 01:43:58,054
and I'll let go

1577
01:43:59,064 --> 01:44:03,899
1, 2...

1578
01:44:04,003 --> 01:44:06,062
6, 7...

1579
01:44:06,171 --> 01:44:07,468
What?

1580
01:44:07,573 --> 01:44:09,564
What about 3 to 5?

1581
01:44:09,942 --> 01:44:12,103
8, 9,10!

1582
01:44:19,918 --> 01:44:22,113
Stop!

1583
01:44:23,289 --> 01:44:25,450
Stop!

1584
01:44:27,826 --> 01:44:29,953
Get the baby! Yes!

1585
01:44:30,029 --> 01:44:33,328
Who the hell invented free fall machines?

1586
01:44:34,533 --> 01:44:36,592
Master

1587
01:44:37,436 --> 01:44:40,166
What a cute baby

1588
01:44:40,439 --> 01:44:43,431
Give me a big smile...

1589
01:44:43,542 --> 01:44:46,136
You're my grandson

1590
01:44:47,613 --> 01:44:49,444
Don't cry. Mommie's here

1591
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:50,605
Daddy's here...

1592
01:44:50,649 --> 01:44:51,479
Mommie's here

1593
01:44:51,517 --> 01:44:54,577
Daddy's here... Mommie's here

1594
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:57,111
Hold him with your left arm or he'll cry

1595
01:45:02,394 --> 01:45:04,294
Not bad

1596
01:45:04,496 --> 01:45:07,192
I understand why

1597
01:45:07,266 --> 01:45:09,097
you're giving up your reward

1598
01:45:09,935 --> 01:45:12,199
But I'm keeping this baby

1599
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:16,931
You should go if you want to stay alive

1600
01:45:17,443 --> 01:45:19,468
Give me a smile

1601
01:45:20,479 --> 01:45:22,913
You're my grandson, understand?

1602
01:45:24,149 --> 01:45:26,140
Alright...

1603
01:45:26,485 --> 01:45:28,282
As soon as we get the result

1604
01:45:28,354 --> 01:45:31,118
The 3 of us are going to Brazil

1605
01:45:36,061 --> 01:45:37,892
Who are you?

1606
01:45:37,996 --> 01:45:40,089
I only want the baby

1607
01:45:42,101 --> 01:45:44,092
Nothing else matters

1608
01:45:44,269 --> 01:45:46,897
It's awful to separate him from his mom

1609
01:45:47,005 --> 01:45:48,267
Awful?

1610
01:45:48,374 --> 01:45:51,138
What about my dead son?

1611
01:45:51,543 --> 01:45:55,479
Max lost his mother when he was a child

1612
01:45:56,281 --> 01:46:00,684
I promised him his own amusement park

1613
01:46:01,253 --> 01:46:03,244
It's finished now

1614
01:46:04,189 --> 01:46:07,681
I also promised him a race track

1615
01:46:09,695 --> 01:46:12,926
But it's only half complete

1616
01:46:13,365 --> 01:46:16,664
and that bitch killed him

1617
01:46:21,573 --> 01:46:26,704
I already lost a son

1618
01:46:27,546 --> 01:46:30,674
I'm not going to lose my grandson

1619
01:46:31,950 --> 01:46:34,009
This child...

1620
01:46:34,119 --> 01:46:37,088
is my only hope for living

1621
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:39,714
If you feel this way. Think about his mother

1622
01:46:40,058 --> 01:46:41,491
She must be feeling the same

1623
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:43,994
Why must you separate them?

1624
01:46:44,496 --> 01:46:46,691
What if he's not your grandson?

1625
01:46:46,732 --> 01:46:49,064
What'll happen then?

1626
01:46:55,974 --> 01:46:58,704
The lab report, Master

1627
01:47:00,279 --> 01:47:02,076
You can go

1628
01:48:11,483 --> 01:48:13,644
What's going on?

1629
01:48:14,786 --> 01:48:16,276
What is he doing?

1630
01:48:16,355 --> 01:48:18,687
I'm not really sure

1631
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:38,075
I found the boy

1632
01:48:42,581 --> 01:48:45,106
But he's not your son

1633
01:49:16,848 --> 01:49:19,282
Don't do this, Master

1634
01:49:19,351 --> 01:49:20,818
Prepare the medication

1635
01:49:21,587 --> 01:49:23,418
Mind your health, sir

1636
01:49:35,734 --> 01:49:37,725
Watch him

1637
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:42,233
Take the kid with you

1638
01:49:42,307 --> 01:49:43,604
Easy... Don't shut the door!

1639
01:49:43,742 --> 01:49:46,302
Let him keep you company

1640
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:50,245
Be careful. Master

1641
01:49:50,749 --> 01:49:51,909
Give him a hand

1642
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:53,583
Where's the baby?

1643
01:49:53,652 --> 01:49:54,744
Give us the baby!

1644
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:55,844
I want my baby

1645
01:49:55,921 --> 01:49:57,411
Don't! Take your money and leave

1646
01:49:57,522 --> 01:50:00,650
I'm turning this place into an ice palace!

1647
01:50:02,828 --> 01:50:06,423
A big one

1648
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:09,429
A gigantic ice palace Master

1649
01:50:11,937 --> 01:50:14,462
Gigantic ice palace

1650
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:17,408
A gigantic ice palace

1651
01:50:31,323 --> 01:50:32,517
What's the matter with you?

1652
01:50:32,624 --> 01:50:34,285
See for yourself

1653
01:50:34,359 --> 01:50:35,951
You're useless

1654
01:50:39,931 --> 01:50:41,922
That was quick!

1655
01:50:42,668 --> 01:50:44,659
You saw them?

1656
01:50:44,870 --> 01:50:47,964
Yes. I saw them both...

1657
01:51:05,223 --> 01:51:06,622
Why are you still here?

1658
01:51:06,692 --> 01:51:08,557
Throw them out!

1659
01:51:11,663 --> 01:51:13,494
Can you do this?

1660
01:51:42,494 --> 01:51:43,620
Thank God

1661
01:52:24,903 --> 01:52:27,394
Round and round and round he goes!

1662
01:52:33,879 --> 01:52:35,847
Goddamn baldie!

1663
01:53:16,588 --> 01:53:18,852
Octopus. The baby hasn't cried for a while

1664
01:53:19,958 --> 01:53:21,789
I'm aware of it!

1665
01:53:26,698 --> 01:53:28,666
Baldie...

1666
01:53:28,767 --> 01:53:30,496
I hate bald heads

1667
01:53:58,029 --> 01:54:00,156
It's fresh

1668
01:54:07,405 --> 01:54:08,633
Baby!

1669
01:54:26,992 --> 01:54:28,857
Octopus!

1670
01:54:34,599 --> 01:54:36,191
Baby...

1671
01:54:36,501 --> 01:54:37,934
Baby!

1672
01:54:44,743 --> 01:54:47,610
Baby...

1673
01:55:01,026 --> 01:55:03,051
How is he? Take off your jacket

1674
01:55:08,934 --> 01:55:09,923
Baby, hang in there!

1675
01:55:10,001 --> 01:55:11,935
You'll be alright

1676
01:55:24,082 --> 01:55:26,073
Baby...

1677
01:55:32,991 --> 01:55:34,481
Go!

1678
01:55:38,063 --> 01:55:39,826
Put it on!

1679
01:55:43,101 --> 01:55:45,092
Baby...

1680
01:55:58,650 --> 01:56:00,584
Catch!

1681
01:56:27,078 --> 01:56:28,978
Turn it up

1682
01:56:36,588 --> 01:56:38,055
Gorge yourself!

1683
01:56:53,872 --> 01:56:56,306
Feed them something extra

1684
01:57:01,746 --> 01:57:03,646
See if you can open the door

1685
01:57:12,724 --> 01:57:15,352
There's no key hole to pick...

1686
01:57:15,693 --> 01:57:18,856
It can't be opened from inside

1687
01:57:49,761 --> 01:57:50,750
Thongs!

1688
01:57:50,795 --> 01:57:52,126
Octopus?

1689
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:54,721
Are you alright, Thongs?

1690
01:57:56,034 --> 01:57:57,092
Open the door!

1691
01:57:57,235 --> 01:57:59,226
Only the Master knows the combination

1692
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:00,803
What? Only he can open it?

1693
01:58:00,905 --> 01:58:03,373
You saw him, He has gone mad

1694
01:58:03,775 --> 01:58:07,233
You're on. Landlord, Do your stuff

1695
01:58:08,413 --> 01:58:11,746
How? It's a Swiss computerized mechanical lock

1696
01:58:11,816 --> 01:58:14,410
8 layers with over 4 million combinations

1697
01:58:14,652 --> 01:58:15,914
Same kind used by the C IA

1698
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:19,012
Save your breath. Open it while I call the cops

1699
01:58:19,390 --> 01:58:21,051
Run for it...

1700
01:58:21,159 --> 01:58:23,787
Stop!

1701
01:58:23,862 --> 01:58:25,352
Hey, come back!

1702
01:58:35,073 --> 01:58:36,734
Be quiet!

1703
01:58:36,808 --> 01:58:38,275
Freeze!

1704
01:58:38,943 --> 01:58:40,376
The machines are too loud

1705
01:58:40,445 --> 01:58:42,413
Turn off the machines

1706
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:43,908
and the refrigerator

1707
01:58:43,982 --> 01:58:46,007
Unplug the refrigerator

1708
01:58:47,785 --> 01:58:48,945
and the air conditioning

1709
01:58:49,087 --> 01:58:50,987
K. Ill the air conditioning

1710
01:58:51,723 --> 01:58:53,122
Everybody, hold your breath

1711
01:58:53,191 --> 01:58:54,180
What?

1712
01:58:54,225 --> 01:58:55,988
Hold your breath!

1713
01:58:56,694 --> 01:58:58,992
Silence!

1714
02:00:04,295 --> 02:00:05,353
Well? Is it open?

1715
02:00:05,396 --> 02:00:06,328
Why doesn't the door pop open?

1716
02:00:06,364 --> 02:00:07,388
Pops open?

1717
02:00:07,498 --> 02:00:09,363
Don't touch it!

1718
02:00:09,434 --> 02:00:12,198
Why doesn't it pop open?

1719
02:00:13,204 --> 02:00:14,364
Because of this?

1720
02:00:14,472 --> 02:00:16,440
It has nothing to do with something so intricate

1721
02:00:16,541 --> 02:00:18,532
Damn...

1722
02:00:23,114 --> 02:00:24,911
It's opened!

1723
02:00:30,088 --> 02:00:32,056
What took you so long?

1724
02:00:32,190 --> 02:00:33,214
Save the baby

1725
02:00:33,291 --> 02:00:35,122
Save him... How is he?

1726
02:00:35,226 --> 02:00:37,524
Save the baby

1727
02:00:38,129 --> 02:00:39,118
You promised me reduced sentence

1728
02:00:39,163 --> 02:00:41,495
Alright...

1729
02:00:53,578 --> 02:00:55,944
The car!

1730
02:01:01,419 --> 02:01:03,512
Don't die on me!

1731
02:01:18,936 --> 02:01:21,564
The car...

1732
02:01:22,874 --> 02:01:24,432
Hot-wired it!

1733
02:01:26,311 --> 02:01:29,144
Don't scare me. Baby...

1734
02:01:32,917 --> 02:01:34,942
Come get your milk

1735
02:01:36,454 --> 02:01:38,388
Baby!

1736
02:01:41,125 --> 02:01:43,389
Wake up for milk

1737
02:01:44,962 --> 02:01:46,930
Mommie's here. Don't be afraid

1738
02:01:47,031 --> 02:01:49,431
Don't be afraid...

1739
02:01:59,277 --> 02:02:00,608
Baby...

1740
02:02:01,446 --> 02:02:04,074
Don't die on me

1741
02:02:06,417 --> 02:02:10,478
Come drink your milk, Wake up!

1742
02:02:14,125 --> 02:02:16,320
Wake up!

1743
02:02:24,001 --> 02:02:27,095
Wake up, Baby

1744
02:02:46,991 --> 02:02:48,481
Pop the hood. Use the engine

1745
02:02:48,559 --> 02:02:50,550
Engine,., in the back!

1746
02:03:28,332 --> 02:03:30,163
1. 2!

1747
02:03:30,234 --> 02:03:32,361
3!

1748
02:03:40,411 --> 02:03:44,074
1. 2, 3!

1749
02:03:54,392 --> 02:03:56,792
Wake up...

1750
02:04:03,701 --> 02:04:05,760
One more time!

1751
02:04:07,038 --> 02:04:10,132
1, 2,3!

1752
02:05:01,826 --> 02:05:04,158
Take them away

1753
02:05:04,295 --> 02:05:06,661
Bring your men and block the exits

1754
02:05:06,764 --> 02:05:07,822
Don't let anyone through

1755
02:05:08,165 --> 02:05:09,496
Yes. Sir!

1756
02:05:13,371 --> 02:05:16,272
Baby...

1757
02:05:23,347 --> 02:05:24,780
Come back!

1758
02:05:24,849 --> 02:05:27,340
Never mind

1759
02:05:50,541 --> 02:05:52,133
Hurry, please...

1760
02:05:52,243 --> 02:05:53,733
Pulse rate 80 BPM

1761
02:06:30,748 --> 02:06:31,908
Max

1762
02:06:32,149 --> 02:06:33,844
This is the police!

1763
02:06:33,918 --> 02:06:36,819
Max. Come home

1764
02:06:38,189 --> 02:06:40,851
I want to play with you...

1765
02:06:40,891 --> 02:06:43,485
Just calm down! Max...

1766
02:06:49,533 --> 02:06:54,266
Sorry. Honey! Take care of yourself

1767
02:06:54,372 --> 02:06:58,274
I thought money was important, but I was wrong

1768
02:06:58,409 --> 02:06:59,706
If there's reincarnation...

1769
02:06:59,777 --> 02:07:02,769
I still want you for my wife

1770
02:07:02,913 --> 02:07:05,609
We'll have 10 kids. OK?

1771
02:07:05,683 --> 02:07:06,843
I love you

1772
02:07:06,951 --> 02:07:09,943
While I'm in jail

1773
02:07:10,287 --> 02:07:12,721
I missed you every single second

1774
02:07:12,823 --> 02:07:16,315
I now know how awful you must have felt

1775
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:18,621
when I was wild and unruly

1776
02:07:18,929 --> 02:07:21,261
I'm really sorry

1777
02:07:22,867 --> 02:07:26,564
If I have the chance to start over...

1778
02:07:27,805 --> 02:07:29,602
I'll cherish you more

1779
02:07:30,307 --> 02:07:33,538
All I did was gamble

1780
02:07:33,644 --> 02:07:36,272
and caused you a lot of trouble

1781
02:07:36,347 --> 02:07:38,815
I've been dealt a lousy hand

1782
02:07:38,949 --> 02:07:43,249
I thought if I had money

1783
02:07:43,821 --> 02:07:46,483
I'll earn respect and own the world

1784
02:07:46,624 --> 02:07:48,717
Now I've learnt my lesson

1785
02:07:48,826 --> 02:07:50,953
at the expense of my beloved family

1786
02:07:51,662 --> 02:07:54,654
I'm sorry. Dad

1787
02:07:57,401 --> 02:07:59,426
Goodbye

1788
02:08:00,805 --> 02:08:03,968
We'll have lots of kids and play in the garden

1789
02:08:04,241 --> 02:08:05,640
All of us will

1790
02:08:05,743 --> 02:08:09,941
race each other

1791
02:08:10,014 --> 02:08:12,642
May the Lord forgive your sins

1792
02:08:12,750 --> 02:08:14,684
In the name of the Father. The Son and the Holy
Ghost. Amen

1793
02:08:14,819 --> 02:08:16,582
We'll have our own children

1794
02:08:16,687 --> 02:08:18,314
We play in the backyard

1795
02:08:18,389 --> 02:08:20,721
while you make dinner...

1796
02:08:20,858 --> 02:08:22,849
And do our laundry

1797
02:08:23,327 --> 02:08:24,692
Fire!

1798
02:08:35,539 --> 02:08:37,632
The government policy back then

1799
02:08:37,742 --> 02:08:39,972
was very strict with the death penalty

1800
02:08:40,044 --> 02:08:43,275
It was only used on

1801
02:08:43,347 --> 02:08:46,316
convicts who have committed serious crimes

1802
02:08:46,417 --> 02:08:49,511
What you have just witnessed

1803
02:08:49,620 --> 02:08:52,054
are different forms of the death penalty

1804
02:08:52,323 --> 02:08:56,054
I'm sure you now have a better understanding

1805
02:08:56,327 --> 02:08:58,693
Let's have another round of applause

1806
02:08:58,796 --> 02:09:01,697
for our inmates who gave us the demonstration

1807
02:09:01,766 --> 02:09:06,499
Well done!

1808
02:09:06,570 --> 02:09:08,731
Thank you!

1809
02:09:10,908 --> 02:09:13,900
Please help yourselves to the refreshments

1810
02:09:16,647 --> 02:09:17,671
Hi there!

1811
02:09:17,782 --> 02:09:18,840
How are you, Landlady?

1812
02:09:18,949 --> 02:09:20,849
You were great, Thongs

1813
02:09:20,951 --> 02:09:21,975
Where's Dad?

1814
02:09:22,086 --> 02:09:24,987
You did a great job. Honey

1815
02:09:25,022 --> 02:09:25,920
I was so scared

1816
02:09:25,956 --> 02:09:27,651
It wasn't real. Silly

1817
02:09:27,725 --> 02:09:29,454
What about the I love you part?

1818
02:09:29,527 --> 02:09:31,392
Of course that's for real

1819
02:09:33,397 --> 02:09:36,093
Honey... I have adopted 10 kids

1820
02:09:36,367 --> 02:09:38,096
From South Africa, the Middle East. Germany...

1821
02:09:38,402 --> 02:09:39,767
Anyone from Cameroon?

1822
02:09:39,870 --> 02:09:41,462
Let me see...

1823
02:09:41,505 --> 02:09:42,494
I'm so happy

1824
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:44,565
Don't over exert yourself. You're pregnant

1825
02:09:44,642 --> 02:09:46,735
Let me carry that...

1826
02:09:47,378 --> 02:09:50,575
Don't frown. It's bad for the baby

1827
02:09:50,614 --> 02:09:51,546
Speak for yourself

1828
02:09:51,582 --> 02:09:54,073
The doctor said the baby is doing great

1829
02:09:55,686 --> 02:09:57,551
I almost forgot my appointment

1830
02:09:57,655 --> 02:09:59,885
With a man or a woman?

1831
02:09:59,990 --> 02:10:02,481
My clients are either men or women

1832
02:10:02,626 --> 02:10:04,526
I can only meet with women?

1833
02:10:04,562 --> 02:10:05,494
No

1834
02:10:05,529 --> 02:10:06,689
Space. Remember?

1835
02:10:06,764 --> 02:10:08,095
Yes...

1836
02:10:08,365 --> 02:10:11,027
I have plenty of space here

1837
02:10:12,002 --> 02:10:13,765
Alright...

1838
02:10:13,871 --> 02:10:15,702
Thanks for coming

1839
02:10:16,807 --> 02:10:18,968
Thanks for taking care of my Dad

1840
02:10:19,944 --> 02:10:21,411
How are you getting along?

1841
02:10:21,478 --> 02:10:24,140
There's nothing to it. It's not my first time

1842
02:10:24,648 --> 02:10:27,776
But I promise you it'll be my last

1843
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:31,149
Why are you making promises to me?

1844
02:10:31,455 --> 02:10:33,480
I...

1845
02:10:33,657 --> 02:10:35,989
I promise my Dad

1846
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:41,764
Thongs

1847
02:10:41,999 --> 02:10:43,660
Inspector

1848
02:10:44,668 --> 02:10:47,068
You have to thank your lucky stars

1849
02:10:48,405 --> 02:10:51,806
The Justice Department may put you on parole

1850
02:10:52,109 --> 02:10:53,474
Thanks Thanks

1851
02:10:53,577 --> 02:10:55,636
Look who's here to see you

1852
02:11:00,985 --> 02:11:01,974
Baby

1853
02:11:02,019 --> 02:11:03,680
Baby!

1854
02:11:03,854 --> 02:11:06,448
Baby...

1855
02:11:06,490 --> 02:11:07,479
Over here... Go on

1856
02:11:07,524 --> 02:11:09,116
Give me a hug

1857
02:11:09,193 --> 02:11:10,626
Mommie

1858
02:11:10,694 --> 02:11:12,184
It's been a long time

1859
02:11:12,429 --> 02:11:14,488
Sorry we didn't have a chance to apologize

1860
02:11:14,565 --> 02:11:15,554
We're really very sorry

1861
02:11:15,666 --> 02:11:16,997
We know. If it hadn't been for you

1862
02:11:17,067 --> 02:11:19,535
Our baby could have died

1863
02:11:21,205 --> 02:11:22,866
I wonder if they'll be interested

1864
02:11:22,907 --> 02:11:23,839
About what?

1865
02:11:23,874 --> 02:11:25,205
About working for us

1866
02:11:25,242 --> 02:11:26,004
What?

1867
02:11:26,043 --> 02:11:27,704
You'll be in charge of security

1868
02:11:27,778 --> 02:11:28,904
You can be the bodyguard

1869
02:11:29,046 --> 02:11:30,911
You can the chauffeur

1870
02:11:31,615 --> 02:11:33,776
I'm perfect for the job

1871
02:11:33,918 --> 02:11:36,978
Driving sports cars has to be my pet project

1872
02:11:37,655 --> 02:11:38,713
Are you interested?

1873
02:11:38,822 --> 02:11:40,517
Absolutely...

1874
02:11:40,557 --> 02:11:41,114
We'll wait for your discharge. Then

1875
02:11:41,158 --> 02:11:42,147
Our Open Day is over

1876
02:11:42,192 --> 02:11:44,490
Time to return to your cell

1877
02:11:46,063 --> 02:11:48,031
Baby...

1878
02:11:48,098 --> 02:11:49,929
Yes?

1879
02:11:50,067 --> 02:11:51,694
Mrs, Li

1880
02:11:51,769 --> 02:11:53,168
We don't even know his name

1881
02:11:53,237 --> 02:11:54,465
It's Matthew

1882
02:11:54,571 --> 02:11:56,732
K. A Sing

1883
02:11:56,807 --> 02:11:58,866
Li K. A Sing?

1884
02:12:06,150 --> 02:12:08,516
So long!

1885
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:12,987
Blindfold me, I can't bear to watch

1886
02:12:22,232 --> 02:12:23,221
How's Jackie?

1887
02:12:23,267 --> 02:12:24,598
Is he alright?

1888
02:12:29,606 --> 02:12:31,733
Bring me a towel

1889
02:12:36,814 --> 02:12:38,281
It hurts!

1890
02:12:38,615 --> 02:12:39,809
One more time

1891
02:12:43,587 --> 02:12:44,986
I get to keep this?

1892
02:12:45,289 --> 02:12:47,280
Action!

1893
02:12:50,761 --> 02:12:51,750
Help him up

1894
02:12:51,795 --> 02:12:54,889
The spine...

1895
02:12:59,770 --> 02:13:02,796
You should go for an X-ray

1896
02:13:06,043 --> 02:13:08,307
Bring the car

1897
02:13:19,656 --> 02:13:21,317
Bring the mattresses here

1898
02:13:21,658 --> 02:13:23,683
What are you doing over there?

1899
02:13:24,294 --> 02:13:26,194
Come on... over here

1900
02:13:26,663 --> 02:13:28,062
Over here

1901
02:13:31,902 --> 02:13:36,737
Careful...

1902
02:13:36,807 --> 02:13:38,138
Careful

1903
02:13:45,115 --> 02:13:46,104
Leave your card with my PA

1904
02:13:46,183 --> 02:13:47,673
She'll save you the best seat

1905
02:13:47,785 --> 02:13:49,980
When's the press conference?

1906
02:13:50,087 --> 02:13:52,112
I can't hear a word you're saying

1907
02:13:54,958 --> 02:13:57,722
Apply more honey

1908
02:13:57,861 --> 02:13:59,328
More

1909
02:14:01,598 --> 02:14:03,930
Stop. I can't stand this!

1910
02:14:40,871 --> 02:14:42,702
Thongs!

1911
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:45,108
Steve, I didn't see you

1912
02:14:45,242 --> 02:14:46,869
You say that every time

1913
02:14:46,944 --> 02:14:48,969
You missed the alumni gathering

1914
02:14:49,079 --> 02:14:50,103
Nobody called me

1915
02:14:50,147 --> 02:14:51,409
Are you sure?

1916
02:14:51,682 --> 02:14:53,081
Grade school or college?

1917
02:14:53,183 --> 02:14:55,242
It's supposed to be High School!

1918
02:14:55,419 --> 02:14:56,977
Stop fluffing your line!

1919
02:14:57,054 --> 02:14:58,715
It was a one-take!

1920
02:14:58,822 --> 02:15:00,016
Do you know how scary it was up there?

1921
02:15:00,124 --> 02:15:01,955
I now have to do it all over again!

1922
02:15:02,059 --> 02:15:04,721
I'll wring your neck for this!
