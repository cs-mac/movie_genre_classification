1
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:48,841
Our Loves Cheaters.

2
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,346
See you later at the office.

3
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:52,446
Agreed.

4
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,934
You have to start to follow until...

5
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,614
That was the black man.

6
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:22,709
And this is WHN in 1050 its dial,

7
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:25,277
the home of country music
in the city of New York.

8
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:27,448
It's a beautiful Monday in the Big Apple.

9
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:29,856
So, city dwellers, If you feel sad,

10
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:32,081
stay here already become.

11
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,492
Stavros.

12
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:39,592
Been a long time. Long.

13
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,374
- My wife.
- How are you, Mrs. Niota?

14
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,984
HELICOPTER FLIGHTS CENTER HELIPORT.

15
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,418
I just got and I must go.

16
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:03,919
Tomorrow I will go to Washington.

17
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:06,484
So take good care of my wife.

18
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,939
Dad, Dad.

19
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,184
Come in, look at this. It's beautiful.

20
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,498
No, stay here, I'm going to fly.
Take care of your mother.

21
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:54,743
Are we going to the Plaza, Mr. Niota?

22
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,206
It was Rodney Crowell, and now, quickly,

23
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:10,083
we have another rookie running
well, they say is New York,

24
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:12,110
Christy Miller 'Kentucky Nights.'

25
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,613
- Leave it here, Sam.
- Who is Sam?

26
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:17,785
- What is your name?
- My name is Deborah.

27
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:19,727
So I called Sam.

28
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:21,696
Makes sense.

29
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:25,621
Accept a tangerine
if you give me a cigarette.

30
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,902
What is police?

31
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:30,997
What? Do I look like cops?

32
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:32,734
Could be. My brother was a policeman. So?

33
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,937
So your brother was a cop.
Go here, will you, Sam?

34
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:37,037
Okay, boss.

35
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,095
Who is your friend beard?

36
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:47,818
Are the mafia or something?

37
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:49,791
You smoke too much.

38
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:52,261
But I'm much better.
They used to be three bundles.

39
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:54,525
Your friend's beard is weird.

40
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,327
I am now about to end a bundle.

41
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,427
- Too.
- I know.

42
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,061
These damn things kill people.

43
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:02,314
- I stop.
- Yes, I stopped.

44
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,410
Your friend does not smoke,
not like the music.

45
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,678
Do you is rare as a friend beard?

46
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:17,049
Me? No, Sam, I'm charming.

47
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:19,832
- Leave me here.
- I love it.

48
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,873
Well, Sam, see you later.

49
00:07:40,973 --> 00:07:43,777
I think it will, boss.

50
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:45,974
I do not know why I like you,

51
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:48,879
your freckles o... your freckles.

52
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,817
It...

53
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:54,152
Dad, Dad, Dad.

54
00:07:54,252 --> 00:07:56,252
Wait, Stefania.

55
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,095
My God, the best girls the world.

56
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:03,030
Knew you'd come today. I knew it.

57
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,090
- I knew it, too, Dad.
- Not true.

58
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,626
It was I who said to wait
more. You do not say anything.

59
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:10,196
- But what I thought.
- I thought.

60
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:12,730
- You're lying again.
- Of course not.

61
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,970
You're smoking, Johnny.

62
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,707
- God, how did that there?
- How did that there?

63
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:19,373
She is Sam, girls. This is Steffie.

64
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:20,883
- How you doing, Steffie?
- Pretty good.

65
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:22,384
- And Gina.
- Hello, Gina.

66
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:23,976
- Hello.
- I gotta go.

67
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:25,579
Yeah, go ahead, Sam. Have a nice day.

68
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,641
See you later, girls. Nice to meet you.

69
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,741
Bye, Dad.

70
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,787
- Is it new?
- What do you think?

71
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:35,694
- It's very pretty.
- I liked his freckles.

72
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:38,166
- Did you have freckles?
- Yes, Dad, lots of freckles.

73
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:39,828
Dad noticed the freckles.

74
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:43,413
- Thank you, Stefania.
- What about Christy?

75
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,331
You always say 'Christy, Christy,
Christy, 'Dad.

76
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:48,275
Why do it? It is so nice.

77
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,610
- I do not know what I do.
- I have not seen you in two days.

78
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,170
Two days passed, Dad.

79
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,376
Shut up, idiot keeps repeating
everything I say.

80
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:55,907
- I do not.
- Sure.

81
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:57,442
Maybe she has the same idea.

82
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:59,285
- But you always wanted.
- I have the same idea.

83
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:01,385
Very boring.

84
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,691
Dad, I can buy a pineapple?

85
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,524
What will you do with a pineapple
at school?

86
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:09,998
Who do you cut it? Your mother
you buy a pineapple.

87
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:11,624
- How is your mother?
- Okay.

88
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:13,794
- Okay.
- He threw a vase of roses Dad.

89
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,667
- I mean, Cliff.
- Roses, huh?

90
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,435
I do not know why I called him Dad.
You do not call it that.

91
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:21,375
- Do not worry about that.
- Mom likes to call Dad.

92
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:23,139
No, does not care.

93
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,874
Do not worry. It's crap children.

94
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:26,472
Call it whatever you want.

95
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:28,109
They look at it much more than me.

96
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,050
I was the one who left.

97
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,780
Sometimes I wish they were together.

98
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,220
But then we would not have known
Christy or Alicia.

99
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,692
O Suzanna. Are you still in Albuquerque,
New Mexico?

100
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,318
Yes, there will be a while.

101
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:41,194
- Christy is so funny. I like it.
- I like Alicia.

102
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:43,926
I also like Alicia. I said I did not like.

103
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:45,456
You like more Christy.

104
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:46,991
No, I like both.

105
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:48,662
But sometimes I feel bad by Christy.

106
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:49,967
- Why Angel?
- I do not know.

107
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,906
Christy's funny, Dad.

108
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:53,704
Christy is in love you, Dad.

109
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:55,040
Yes, well, I love her.

110
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,511
But you're not in love it.

111
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:58,309
What the hell do you know that?

112
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:00,712
- Feminine intuition.
- It's feminine intuition, Dad.

113
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:03,081
- Do you want to complete it?
- Come on, come later.

114
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:05,348
- Did you finish that case, Dad?
- Why not see me.

115
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:07,355
- Today I started a new one.
- You got a date tonight?

116
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:09,325
- What about the driver?
- Well, I hate to be alone.

117
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:11,292
Stop worrying, give you an ulcer.

118
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,228
- I love you, Dad.
- Oh, Gina, my Gina.

119
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:14,627
When can we eat?

120
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:16,996
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, goodbye.

121
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:19,126
Goodbye.

122
00:10:19,226 --> 00:10:21,068
Be good to your mother.

123
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:23,436
- Good luck tonight, Dad.
- Good luck tonight, Dad.

124
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:26,511
There you go again. Stop doing that.

125
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,329
Taxi.

126
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,079
Take me to Wall Street, yes?

127
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,945
God is very beautiful in that dress.

128
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:43,214
Keep your head in the business,
Charles. Already dark?

129
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:45,686
- I think not.
- Whatever you say, Chas.

130
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:48,315
Do you think it will be with her boyfriend
or your husband...?

131
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:51,135
We'll find out. Come on, come on.

132
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,394
It costs so much to say.

133
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:02,639
Yes, I think it happened once, but...

134
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,541
You never know.

135
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:14,641
I do not know.

136
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,283
Do you?

137
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:23,383
- No.
- Are you sure?

138
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,051
Goodbye. Goodbye.

139
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,758
- It's a hotel.
- Well, Chas.

140
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,477
- I can help you, sir?
- No, thanks. I am...

141
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:06,283
...well...

142
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:09,018
...yes, do you...? In fact, I already ate.

143
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:10,992
Then maybe...

144
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:13,153
Do you have a specialty? O...

145
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:15,254
It may take a tomato juice.

146
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:17,492
- Ice, I guess.
- Very good.

147
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:19,592
Unless... thanks...

148
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,303
Forget it, leave it pending.

149
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:32,974
I never want to talk to her.

150
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:34,573
Wait, wait, Amy.

151
00:15:34,673 --> 00:15:36,312
The gaucho has just arrived.

152
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:38,616
The boyfriend of Ms. Martin.

153
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:41,266
She has a girl I wish to know.

154
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,715
I do not know who the other girl.

155
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,725
You know what, I'll find out.

156
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:55,168
Johnny tell where we are, right?
I must go, little one.

157
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:57,638
See you later.

158
00:15:57,738 --> 00:16:00,267
Mary, you got a cigarette?

159
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:01,674
It's Sylvia.

160
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:03,735
Glad to hear it, Sylvia. Got a cigarette?

161
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:06,873
Sure, why not? Is something wrong
in sight, son?

162
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:09,111
Yes, you dazzle me attractive.

163
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:10,710
Got a match? Where will you be later?

164
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,744
- I'm busy.
- With the Gaucho?

165
00:16:12,844 --> 00:16:14,983
Maybe. What do you care? You know him?

166
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,891
No, do you?

167
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:19,986
Are not you getting curious?

168
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:22,086
How I can help?

169
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:24,964
No, just a friend. A rich kid.

170
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:26,661
But it's nice.

171
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:28,363
At least I can see his eyes.

172
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:32,883
The glasses disappear
at midnight. Where will you be?

173
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,520
- Here, sir.
- What?

174
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,620
Okay, thanks.

175
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,419
Georgie-George, one of the great
men. Can I borrow your phone?

176
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,156
Sure, Johnny, go ahead. Are you working?

177
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:02,256
No, never.

178
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,496
Yes, dear, do you communicate
with the Algonquin?

179
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,439
Honey, call Arthur Brodsky
to lobby for me, okay?

180
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,770
Mr. Arthur Bromsky.

181
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,352
- Yes? Yes?
- Telephone.

182
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:32,452
Brodsky.

183
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,022
Yes? Hello, Johnny, What's up?

184
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:38,533
Is the Plaza? What do the...?

185
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:40,915
Oh yeah? Really?

186
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,331
Not much.

187
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:49,916
Ms. Martin is leaving with her boyfriend.

188
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,171
What? Oh, again, no.

189
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:54,774
Christy is not so silly.

190
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:57,149
Da tip, friend.
Do not worry, I'll be there.

191
00:18:57,249 --> 00:19:00,734
- Who was that?
- Johnny, nothing important.

192
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,214
Go, go.

193
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,569
Perhaps best left to remove
the groom in the reports.

194
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:19,096
- Groom...
- You are four times this week.

195
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:20,903
- Yes, but never alone with him.
- Yes.

196
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:22,569
- Until today.
- That's what I meant.

197
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:25,644
I do not like. I do not like at all.

198
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,905
Quiet, quiet, well. Right here.

199
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,455
Thanks, buddy.

200
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,293
The husband asks many questions.

201
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,823
Already dark?

202
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:19,923
Yes, I suppose.

203
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,875
Just give me a puff.
It will be a long night.

204
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:31,975
Me too.

205
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,983
Look at it this way, Chas.

206
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,615
Is in preparation with boyfriend...

207
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:44,990
...when it has a husband.

208
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,791
If the groom goes on to deal
as husband, will be...

209
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:50,024
Will be away from her husband.

210
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,397
And if that happens with her husband,

211
00:20:52,497 --> 00:20:54,868
the case is over, pay us...

212
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:57,371
...and then it's every man for himself.

213
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,000
Yes, change the boyfriend what worries me.

214
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,443
Yeah, well, that's what worries everyone.

215
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:05,543
So we got the job.

216
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,344
Remember, Chas?

217
00:21:07,444 --> 00:21:09,444
- Yes, yes.
- Chas...

218
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,146
Remember?

219
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:13,246
I know, I know.

220
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:15,017
No, no, I'm leaving. Keep it.

221
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:16,581
I will see Johnny.

222
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:18,820
Call me later to Christy if you can, okay?

223
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
See ya.

224
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,267
Hello, beautiful.

225
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,524
City Limits.

226
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,095
You shit.

227
00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:47,340
Christy Miller, ladies and gentlemen.

228
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:57,506
I'm past tired, honey, old-sick.

229
00:24:57,606 --> 00:25:00,140
I will not be another your passive women...

230
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,843
...who tremble at the thought of you,

231
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:03,749
and have to endure any type of abuse...

232
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:05,753
...only for the glorious opportunity...

233
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:07,914
...spent a glorious night you,

234
00:25:08,014 --> 00:25:09,822
once in a while, every death of bishop.

235
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:11,826
No, sir, for nothing, honey.

236
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:13,926
No way.

237
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,948
Unfortunately, honey, kiss very well.

238
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,333
And you're very wrong with me.

239
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:32,369
Very bad. What you need is a good man...

240
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:33,972
...see all your actions,

241
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:36,609
have drinks waiting in the dressing room,

242
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,346
you rub your feet at night.

243
00:25:38,446 --> 00:25:39,910
Protect your throat...

244
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,560
...tell you how great you are,

245
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:44,149
and prepare eggs in the morning.

246
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:45,989
Once I made eggs.

247
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:47,619
Yes, and burned them.

248
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,719
They looked delicious.

249
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,193
Why you looked at the clock?

250
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,332
- Why would you tell time?
- Why? Have an appointment?

251
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,365
Yes, redhead, tall, freckled.

252
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:04,071
- It's a taxi driver.
- Do you take a walk?

253
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:06,672
- Not very far.
- You're such a liar.

254
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:08,772
I think so.

255
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,782
Hey, Christy.

256
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:13,515
It's Arthur.

257
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,989
- Sounds like it.
- What does Arthur here?

258
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:17,685
I do not know, why do not you ask?

259
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,353
Did you tell Arthur to come?

260
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,022
Why would you say to Arthur to come?

261
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,189
Something is not right. Pasa.

262
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:26,223
Hello, Christy. Sorry for the intrusion,
Johnny was looking for.

263
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:27,997
- Hey, Johnny.
- What is it, boy?

264
00:26:28,097 --> 00:26:29,629
- Well...
- We have a little problem.

265
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:32,231
- Yes, for Martin. Leon is...
- Furioso.

266
00:26:32,331 --> 00:26:35,038
- It comes foaming at the mouth.
- In fact, you're right and said...

267
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:38,307
If you're not there immediately,
are all dismissed.

268
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:39,904
I guess you better get out.

269
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:42,007
Yeah, I guess I better go.

270
00:26:42,107 --> 00:26:43,677
See you soon.

271
00:26:43,777 --> 00:26:45,777
I doubt it.

272
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,503
Sure, sure.

273
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,059
Hey, where are you going?

274
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,256
Where are your skates?

275
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,566
Yes, but I catch this guy.

276
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,943
Sylvia, still do not know what will later.

277
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:23,678
I must first find this other guy.

278
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:28,708
I love to be with both,
Tulips especially with your friend.

279
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,989
How are you, chasy, boy?

280
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,623
Hey, brother.

281
00:28:37,723 --> 00:28:40,294
- Oh, God, thank you.
- What are you doing here?

282
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:41,961
I do not know. I do not know what to do.

283
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:44,234
- Have you smoked the whole joint?
- I was just standing there...

284
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:46,172
The whole joint. ...Watching.

285
00:28:46,272 --> 00:28:48,698
When I realized I was here
skating like an idiot.

286
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:51,007
Look, we'll get into serious trouble.

287
00:28:51,107 --> 00:28:53,606
You know. I think we should
be more discreet.

288
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:55,207
I know, but let me kiss in the mouth.

289
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:56,979
The husband will like.

290
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,576
No, Arthur, I thought.

291
00:28:58,676 --> 00:29:00,676
- What?
- What?

292
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:02,179
Now what you thought.

293
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,798
Yes, if the groom...

294
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,371
Chasy what do you do?

295
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:20,738
Better take a break.

296
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:22,838
Be right back.

297
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,390
Hey, Tulips.

298
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:40,622
- You known?
- Who? She? No.

299
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:43,859
Well, Sylvia, Tulips, he is...
What's your name?

300
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:46,423
- Go maneuver.
- Not bad, huh?

301
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:49,335
Just say your name, girl
is incredibly resilient.

302
00:29:49,435 --> 00:29:50,962
I called Barbara Jo.

303
00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:52,802
Hello, Barbara Jo, what's up?

304
00:29:52,902 --> 00:29:55,877
What if you skate? Come on, come on.

305
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,405
Are you okay?

306
00:30:28,505 --> 00:30:30,630
Okay, thanks. How are you?

307
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,492
Sam, Sam, refrigerator.

308
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:48,587
- How was your day babe?
- I'm starving.

309
00:30:48,687 --> 00:30:51,064
Yes, what you had in mind?

310
00:30:51,164 --> 00:30:53,164
Nothing in particular.

311
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,137
- Frozen pizza?
- Well...

312
00:30:58,237 --> 00:31:00,487
I am a bit particular.

313
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,477
Yeah, well, I know a French.

314
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:05,706
Sounds chic.

315
00:31:05,806 --> 00:31:07,977
But it is not.

316
00:31:08,077 --> 00:31:10,077
LUNCH...

317
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,494
- Deborah, how are you?
- Well, well.

318
00:31:23,594 --> 00:31:25,192
- Cretin.
- Friend of yours?

319
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:27,201
- Briefly.
- You have a broken heart.

320
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:29,465
- You can see bleed.
- You think so?

321
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:31,665
- And I can see why.
- You're just a romantic.

322
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,731
Yes? What's wrong romance?

323
00:31:33,831 --> 00:31:35,742
There is nothing wrong.
It costs only to find it.

324
00:31:35,842 --> 00:31:37,609
You never had much of it, Do not you, babe?

325
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:40,671
Not much. I just do not like
sleep alone, I guess.

326
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:42,342
Well dressed lie. Why do not you?

327
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,681
- Why can not I sleep dressed?
- Yes, exactly.

328
00:31:44,781 --> 00:31:46,744
A man and a woman sleep in the same bed...

329
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:49,222
...but a plank between them,
a plank of wood.

330
00:31:49,322 --> 00:31:52,522
He can see it, you can hear her breathing
but can not touch.

331
00:31:52,622 --> 00:31:54,994
What will you do if you can endure?

332
00:31:55,094 --> 00:31:57,094
Eventually splintered.

333
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,775
This line here is the heart.

334
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:15,010
Show that you're very emotional.

335
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,110
Emotions are great.

336
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,211
Besides, no one can avoid feelings.

337
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:24,021
- That's a problem.
- What?

338
00:32:24,121 --> 00:32:26,501
- You're married, right?
- Yes.

339
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:29,496
That line is short, is weak.

340
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:32,021
- But that's not what worries me.
- No?

341
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:34,432
There's a bad romance.

342
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:36,532
Really?

343
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,266
Very bad. You see this line?

344
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:40,433
It's not going anywhere.

345
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:43,763
Well, that will not let me far, right?

346
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,062
Well, I do not know.

347
00:32:46,142 --> 00:32:49,450
Here's something new.

348
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,510
Very promising. You see this line?

349
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,610
Goes on forever.

350
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,892
Maybe my line as a skater.

351
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:00,121
Your line as a skater.

352
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:02,959
No, your true online of passion.

353
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,431
But is separated line marriage.

354
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:07,491
It does not start until...

355
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:10,527
Are you going to divorce?

356
00:33:10,627 --> 00:33:13,165
You get very personal, right?

357
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:14,572
Sorry. Sorry.

358
00:33:14,672 --> 00:33:16,907
They just have to step aside these...

359
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:20,658
- I gotta go.
- Yes?

360
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,643
Well thanks for reading. Got a phone?

361
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:29,156
If I have...? Yes 33901 Trafalgar.

362
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:32,061
- Goodbye.
- Can you... remember...?

363
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,863
Sorry, sorry.

364
00:34:52,963 --> 00:34:55,171
I'm not rude, it's just that my shoes are...

365
00:34:55,271 --> 00:34:58,076
The temple... I left my shoes...

366
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,255
...and my skates.

367
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,432
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

368
00:35:03,512 --> 00:35:06,217
Willy, a friend of mine, let it go, okay?

369
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:08,279
- Well, Arthur.
- See you tomorrow.

370
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,256
- Listen, I have a knot...
- Go.

371
00:35:10,356 --> 00:35:12,088
Go ahead, it's fixed.

372
00:35:12,188 --> 00:35:13,821
Toma.

373
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:16,762
Hello, Chas. How are you?

374
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:19,043
Good. Go ahead.

375
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,469
- Wait...
- Come on.

376
00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:34,694
- Come on, chasy.
- Come on.

377
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,017
- Come on, turn here.
- Holy God.

378
00:35:40,117 --> 00:35:42,614
- Have you...?
- Yes, here it is. Give me your foot,

379
00:35:42,714 --> 00:35:44,590
- And I will.
- What happened? Did you get anything?

380
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,753
Pretty much. Three votes say
that marriage will not last.

381
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,160
- Sure, but what about the groom?
- The gaucho?

382
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,961
- Two to one is not. Tulips says yes.
- Tulips says yes.

383
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:55,662
A big no to Barbara Jo. Sylvia
undecided, which is what I like.

384
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:59,417
- Sylvia is undecided...
- That's what I like.

385
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,647
- See, I call you BJ.
- Yes, I'll be home.

386
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:10,747
Good. I liked his hair.

387
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:12,829
- What?
- Nothing.

388
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,351
- Here's your change.
- Thanks.

389
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,834
Play serious brother.

390
00:37:18,914 --> 00:37:21,186
Something must have made her
change your mind.

391
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:24,851
- You think so?
- Chasy, chasy.

392
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,587
- You think so?
- I know.

393
00:37:26,687 --> 00:37:30,085
I go see Barbara Jo and find out more.

394
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:31,928
Wait, what...? What... Why...?

395
00:37:32,028 --> 00:37:34,230
Smoke this, try to sleep.

396
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,828
Tomorrow will be a difficult day.

397
00:37:36,928 --> 00:37:38,928
Now she knows you.

398
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:43,172
Incidentally, I met her. Worth the wait.

399
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
¿Snoring?

400
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,054
A lot?

401
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,070
Do you kicked?

402
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,806
A couple of times without bruising.

403
00:38:51,906 --> 00:38:53,906
No splinters.

404
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,079
Listen, you know where is the key.

405
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:02,988
When you...

406
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:05,474
- Need sleep?
- Yes, indeed.

407
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,915
See ya.

408
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,806
Hello, Ritzi, how are you?

409
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:28,178
Hello, Johnny, Where's Arthur?

410
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:29,807
I do not know. I was going to ask.

411
00:39:29,907 --> 00:39:31,875
Tell him to call me, okay?

412
00:39:31,975 --> 00:39:33,975
I will, I will.

413
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,406
Arthur.

414
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,610
Shit.

415
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,897
Sorry, Arthur. I thought not.

416
00:39:46,997 --> 00:39:48,997
Love, the girl is love.

417
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,497
I'll call you tonight at 6:30, Rita.

418
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:00,046
One day you stab.

419
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:01,844
What can you do? Is love.

420
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:04,009
Yes, have to queue behind Leon.

421
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:05,848
- Do you?
- Why? What happened?

422
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:08,514
I called him from the gym, is the day
Dolores in the gym.

423
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,148
Now is Dolores.

424
00:40:10,248 --> 00:40:12,523
- Yes.
- It was cold.

425
00:40:12,623 --> 00:40:14,623
Worse, it was nice.

426
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:16,222
I must go to the gym.

427
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:18,356
What? Will the spies this morning?

428
00:40:18,456 --> 00:40:20,264
No, but now much more difficult.

429
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:21,995
- I say...
- Yes, I know Barbara Jo,

430
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:23,766
not as good as I expected, but still.

431
00:40:23,866 --> 00:40:25,294
What, were discovered?

432
00:40:25,394 --> 00:40:28,365
No, no, but we talked.

433
00:40:28,465 --> 00:40:30,309
- You spoke.
- A while.

434
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:31,902
A while.

435
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:33,470
Enough.

436
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,072
- A little more.
- I figured.

437
00:40:35,172 --> 00:40:37,297
- But we connected.
- Still.

438
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,413
Well you need a beard.

439
00:40:39,513 --> 00:40:40,851
- A front.
- Intelligent, yes.

440
00:40:40,951 --> 00:40:42,151
Odyssey Detective Agency 'NEVER SLEEP'.

441
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:44,487
Odyssey Detective Agency, never sleep,

442
00:40:44,587 --> 00:40:46,219
- Can you wait, please?
- Amy, Amy.

443
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,988
- Hey, Amy, Leon is busy?
- Thanks.

444
00:40:48,088 --> 00:40:50,395
Charlie, where the hell are
case reports in Martin?

445
00:40:50,495 --> 00:40:52,797
- Well...
- We have them, Amy. Any calls?

446
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:54,733
Yes, Mandy, Sherry...

447
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,896
...Terry...
- Terry's sister, Sherry.

448
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,404
- The very same.
- Interesting.

449
00:40:58,504 --> 00:41:00,840
- Any calls for me, Amy?
- Only your father, Charles.

450
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,399
Ah, her father again.

451
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:04,309
Why do not you call and ruining your day?

452
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:05,369
Oh, God.

453
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:08,439
- Charles.
- Hello, Mr. Leondopolous, how are you?

454
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:10,417
Where are the reports Martin case?

455
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:13,545
Yeah, well, we have been
very busy lately, Leon.

456
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:15,522
We have them, Leon just yet tipeamos not.

457
00:41:15,622 --> 00:41:17,387
So we do not have, Arthur.

458
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:20,417
The typing is not a bureaucratic flourish
middle class.

459
00:41:20,517 --> 00:41:22,929
And I'd really rather not hear exasperation...

460
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:25,659
...in the tone of one this morning.

461
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:27,894
Because I'm on the verge of a precipice,

462
00:41:27,994 --> 00:41:30,062
further irritation and smallest...

463
00:41:30,162 --> 00:41:32,629
...could cause me to fall a yawning chasm,

464
00:41:32,729 --> 00:41:35,642
which I seriously doubt I would
able to leave.

465
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:37,940
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Holy Mother.

466
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,502
- Damn, that burns.
- Charlie.

467
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:41,105
- I know.
- Bring the ice.

468
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:42,706
- I have it.
- Butter.

469
00:41:42,806 --> 00:41:43,943
Ice, ice, butter makes it worse.

470
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,316
Once a week the same story, Leon.

471
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:47,820
Thank you. Thank you.

472
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,413
All right.

473
00:41:49,513 --> 00:41:51,482
In any case... in any case...

474
00:41:51,582 --> 00:41:53,391
...when Mr. Martin called this morning...

475
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:56,089
...requesting information on
his wife... Thanks, Miss Lester...

476
00:41:56,189 --> 00:41:58,462
...for the first time in three weeks...

477
00:41:58,562 --> 00:42:00,330
Thanks, Miss Lester...

478
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,359
...would have been happy with scribbles
in toilet paper.

479
00:42:03,459 --> 00:42:05,736
Anything would have been
better than nothing.

480
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:08,571
Charles, the file was empty.

481
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:11,476
- Is this all, I will tonight.
- The will tonight.

482
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:12,741
Tonight is too late I need them now.

483
00:42:12,841 --> 00:42:13,838
The need now.

484
00:42:13,938 --> 00:42:16,475
- Dolores I re...
- I could deal with Amy.

485
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,576
Have a call in line four, Mr. Leondopolous.

486
00:42:18,676 --> 00:42:19,607
Go ahead, Chas.

487
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:21,417
We can take care of everything,
Mr. Leondopolous.

488
00:42:21,517 --> 00:42:23,252
They can handle everything, Leon.

489
00:42:23,352 --> 00:42:25,622
Well, someone take care of something. John.

490
00:42:25,722 --> 00:42:28,093
- Yes, Leon?
- I can see you a minute?

491
00:42:28,193 --> 00:42:30,426
Sure. Sure, sure.

492
00:42:30,526 --> 00:42:32,526
Let's talk.

493
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,135
It has two calls on hold Mr. Leondopolous.

494
00:42:36,235 --> 00:42:38,570
I am very aware of this, Ms. Lester.

495
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,475
One of them is Mrs. Leondopolous.

496
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,335
Hello, yes?

497
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,310
I hear every word what the doctor said.

498
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:46,780
- Very good.
- Thanks, Amy.

499
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,374
- Sure.
- I love your wings, you know?

500
00:42:49,474 --> 00:42:52,249
I know. Detective Agency Odyssey...

501
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:54,720
...rarely sleep.

502
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,518
Hello, Christy.

503
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:58,525
What a pleasant surprise.

504
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:01,426
Good morning, Amy. You look great
this morning.

505
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:03,054
- Thanks, Christy.
- Very good.

506
00:43:03,154 --> 00:43:04,156
Thanks, Christy.

507
00:43:04,256 --> 00:43:06,826
Do you know the desktop Mr. Russo, Amy?

508
00:43:06,926 --> 00:43:10,064
Right there, Christy, not far Mr. Russo.

509
00:43:10,164 --> 00:43:13,403
Thanks, Amy. I can see that all
work hard today.

510
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:16,375
- Good morning, Christy, how are you?
- Good day, Judas.

511
00:43:16,475 --> 00:43:18,606
Here are some things I have
belonging to Mr. Russo...

512
00:43:18,706 --> 00:43:21,137
...and I'm sure that will need
much more than me.

513
00:43:21,237 --> 00:43:23,237
Yes, Harold, shut up.

514
00:43:23,315 --> 00:43:25,378
Who's this, honey? You have the wrong guy.

515
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,546
Very funny. Excuse me.

516
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,886
And Charles, how are you this morning?

517
00:43:29,986 --> 00:43:31,986
I am a bit exhausted...

518
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,994
Travel Odyssey ¿I can help?

519
00:43:35,094 --> 00:43:36,792
Just a moment please.

520
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:39,196
Arthur, is the line of travel: Barbara Jo.

521
00:43:39,296 --> 00:43:40,393
Barbara Jo.

522
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,561
Hi Jo, what do you know?

523
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,797
You look sexy, Charles.

524
00:43:43,897 --> 00:43:45,771
Yes? I've been late, it.

525
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:48,274
You say you always look sexy
when you have delayed?

526
00:43:48,374 --> 00:43:50,675
I guess I'll have to stay delayed.

527
00:43:50,775 --> 00:43:52,610
Yes, Harold. Say hello to Harold, Charles.

528
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,410
- Hey, Harold.
- Well, Jo, I must go.

529
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,076
- What?
- Meeting in the gym.

530
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,914
Christy, I must go.

531
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,854
- Can you drive?
- I can not really.

532
00:44:00,954 --> 00:44:02,617
- Thank you, Charlie.
- Sorry.

533
00:44:02,717 --> 00:44:04,454
- Where are you going?
- North of the city.

534
00:44:04,554 --> 00:44:06,584
- But there I go.
- Well to the north.

535
00:44:06,684 --> 00:44:10,290
- Do you shave today, Charlie?
- What? Yes.

536
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,424
It's funny, here it seems you had a beard.

537
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,627
Barba ¿?

538
00:44:14,727 --> 00:44:17,466
No, smooth as silk.

539
00:44:17,566 --> 00:44:20,405
Christy, where you said you were going?

540
00:44:20,505 --> 00:44:22,637
- North of the city.
- What a coincidence, me too.

541
00:44:22,737 --> 00:44:24,906
- Come on, I'll take you.
- Thanks, Charles.

542
00:44:25,006 --> 00:44:27,378
It's been a rough day
My toilet exploded this morning.

543
00:44:27,478 --> 00:44:29,440
- Oh, really?
- Yes, I pulled the chain innocently...

544
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,383
...and believe that a bomb exploded.

545
00:44:31,483 --> 00:44:34,628
- I was lucky not to be granted.
- Yes..

546
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,285
Yes, thanks for calling.

547
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:40,935
Listen, we will call you back.

548
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,623
I saw that.

549
00:44:45,723 --> 00:44:47,634
- What did you see?
- Nothing.

550
00:44:47,734 --> 00:44:49,226
- Type.
- Ray.

551
00:44:49,326 --> 00:44:52,136
Three back Monday... When?

552
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:54,265
Well, copious notes.

553
00:44:54,365 --> 00:44:56,640
All right, dear. Very good.

554
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,740
Yes.

555
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,463
God.

556
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:05,184
There is a virus going around.
Excuse me, my back.

557
00:45:05,284 --> 00:45:06,743
People drop like flies.

558
00:45:06,843 --> 00:45:09,085
I have not seen anyone fall, Leon.

559
00:45:09,185 --> 00:45:11,114
I saw a couple of guys running.

560
00:45:11,214 --> 00:45:13,540
They will fall soon.

561
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,633
Leon, last night I slept with a 23.

562
00:45:21,733 --> 00:45:23,261
Redhead.

563
00:45:23,361 --> 00:45:25,430
I put my arms around him, kissed.

564
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:28,100
- And fell asleep.
- Is there something wrong?

565
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,440
No, there was nothing wrong.

566
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,445
In this case, it must be spring.

567
00:45:32,545 --> 00:45:34,545
Is that it?

568
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:36,915
I've been noticing an expression
distant dreamer...

569
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:39,475
...in your eyes lately.

570
00:45:39,575 --> 00:45:41,716
I have the impression
that your personal life is...

571
00:45:41,816 --> 00:45:44,019
Yeah, well,

572
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:46,924
Sometimes we all come good a map.

573
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,554
- What about the husband?
- Stavros?

574
00:45:50,654 --> 00:45:52,292
Yes, Stavros, the husband.

575
00:45:52,392 --> 00:45:55,028
Rare. That marriage is rare.

576
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:57,264
- When is it going?
- Tonight, for five days.

577
00:45:57,364 --> 00:46:00,171
- Is he kidding?
- I really do not know.

578
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:02,004
But it was always a womanizer.

579
00:46:02,104 --> 00:46:04,738
Actually, I have 15 years without seeing it.

580
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:06,679
This is his second wife, I met the first.

581
00:46:06,779 --> 00:46:08,511
For man believes in marriage.

582
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:10,039
Do not we all?

583
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:12,139
Yes, indeed.

584
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,213
Well I'll take the boy with me.

585
00:46:15,313 --> 00:46:16,950
You have to rest the back, Leon.

586
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,582
What's that supposed to mean?

587
00:46:18,682 --> 00:46:21,235
You have to rest your back.

588
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,786
- Ready, son?
- Yes, it's good, Dad.

589
00:46:26,872 --> 00:46:28,530
Is there anything I can read?

590
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,503
What will Mr. Leondopolous.

591
00:46:30,603 --> 00:46:33,165
Odyssey, never sleep. Can you wait, please?

592
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:35,767
Take care of your back, Amy.
He is sensitive.

593
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:38,175
- It's a sensitive man.
- I know.

594
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:39,770
- John?
- Thanks, Ames.

595
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,870
Bye, guys.

596
00:46:41,948 --> 00:46:44,579
Yes? One moment, Ms. Leondopolous.

597
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:46,727
I have another call.

598
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:49,983
- Is your wife again.
- I went.

599
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:52,208
- Where'd he go?
- Anywhere.

600
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:57,155
Yes, Ms. Leondopolous, sorry.
Went to lunch early.

601
00:46:57,255 --> 00:46:59,028
¿I can give you a message?

602
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:01,168
I will. Have a nice day.

603
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,528
- It feels a lot worse.
- Sorry to find out.

604
00:47:04,628 --> 00:47:07,404
- Me too.
- Amy, I think John suspicion.

605
00:47:07,504 --> 00:47:08,635
Yes?

606
00:47:08,735 --> 00:47:10,540
Keep doing jokes about my back.

607
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,102
Probably right, we are overdoing it.

608
00:47:13,202 --> 00:47:15,202
Do you agree?

609
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,552
Stop here, driver, fine.

610
00:47:20,652 --> 00:47:22,419
- Well, Mack.
- Please, beware the change.

611
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:23,923
- Sure, sure.
- Thank you.

612
00:47:24,023 --> 00:47:26,323
Charles certainly are the man
more impulsive.

613
00:47:26,423 --> 00:47:28,226
- Have ever known.
- Repulsive, you said?

614
00:47:28,326 --> 00:47:31,163
'Im'... impulsive, Charles.
I do not believe at all repulsive.

615
00:47:31,263 --> 00:47:33,188
I thought you might want to juice
orange or a hot dog.

616
00:47:33,288 --> 00:47:35,395
- I think you're very handsome.
- Thanks, Christy.

617
00:47:35,495 --> 00:47:37,995
You look good. Do you want juice
or sausage?

618
00:47:38,095 --> 00:47:40,472
Yes, I would really like a juice big orange.

619
00:47:40,572 --> 00:47:43,271
A large orange juice, please.

620
00:47:43,371 --> 00:47:44,902
- Are you Greek?
- Yes.

621
00:47:45,002 --> 00:47:46,810
Thank you very much, dear.

622
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:49,110
In addition, Charles, I
thought you were late.

623
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:50,578
No, my watch is running fast.

624
00:47:50,678 --> 00:47:52,916
Would you like to walk?
Why did not cross the street?

625
00:47:53,016 --> 00:47:55,080
Honestly, Charles, sometimes you're weird.

626
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,249
Sorry, Christy, would you like sit?

627
00:47:57,349 --> 00:48:01,174
What's on your mind, Charles,
on the sidewalk?

628
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,992
Want to come to lunch, Charles?

629
00:48:09,092 --> 00:48:11,004
I can not cook, but I know
where everything is.

630
00:48:11,104 --> 00:48:13,506
Do you like eggs, honey?
I have no bread and eggs.

631
00:48:13,606 --> 00:48:15,701
Are bread, Harold? Remember? Yes.

632
00:48:15,801 --> 00:48:17,767
Harold also believed to no bread, Charles.

633
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:19,609
I have not really hungry, Christy.

634
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:21,136
- No?
- No.

635
00:48:21,236 --> 00:48:22,945
- Would you like some new shoes?
- New shoes?

636
00:48:23,045 --> 00:48:25,543
Did I say if you would like shoes
new? Those are quite old.

637
00:48:25,643 --> 00:48:28,612
Thank you very much, Charles. These are
original design of the 30s.

638
00:48:28,712 --> 00:48:32,707
That's what I mean.
Would not you like some new?

639
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,486
Well, Christy...

640
00:48:36,586 --> 00:48:39,226
- Charles.
- Here, stay with Harold.

641
00:48:39,326 --> 00:48:41,621
You are so strong about it.

642
00:48:41,707 --> 00:48:46,892
Look at those beautiful shoes, Harold.
Are not they beautiful?

643
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,472
- I can help?
- We would like to see new shoes.

644
00:48:50,572 --> 00:48:52,705
Yeah, well, here we do not sell used shoes.

645
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,765
- Good.
- This way.

646
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,343
Sorry, I'm terr...

647
00:49:00,443 --> 00:49:03,031
Sorry.

648
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,289
Do you like this, Charles?

649
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:07,953
- Yes, great.
- Really?

650
00:49:08,053 --> 00:49:10,190
I try them. I also I'll try a dress.

651
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,010
Watch Harold, will you, Charles?

652
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,117
Harold, quiet.

653
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:23,158
More or less.

654
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,257
I like it.

655
00:49:43,357 --> 00:49:46,130
What do you think, Charles?

656
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,690
God, Christy, what are they?

657
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:50,168
Where did you get? Not at all attractive.

658
00:49:50,268 --> 00:49:52,001
I hate you, honey. I thought you liked you.

659
00:49:52,101 --> 00:49:55,008
No, no, talking about these boots.

660
00:49:55,108 --> 00:49:56,703
Here, why do not you testing?

661
00:49:56,803 --> 00:49:58,643
Whatever you say, Charles.

662
00:49:58,743 --> 00:50:01,739
I just have to take off this dress
no use to me.

663
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,359
How do you like my new coat?

664
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,064
- Thank you, Charlie.
- The only...

665
00:50:26,164 --> 00:50:28,734
Harold. I can not even leave
take care of the dog.

666
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:31,437
I can not believe I'm so sorry. Harold.

667
00:50:31,537 --> 00:50:33,309
Harold, just calm down.

668
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:35,042
Hello, I'm sorry.

669
00:50:35,142 --> 00:50:36,606
Sorry, I'm Christy Miller.

670
00:50:36,706 --> 00:50:38,379
Hello, you're the singer.

671
00:50:38,479 --> 00:50:40,751
I'm afraid so. The record goes
through lists right now.

672
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:43,221
- I am Dolores Martin, gladly.
- Likewise.

673
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:45,190
- Ms Martin, Miss Martin?
- Mrs.

674
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,783
Ah, madam.

675
00:50:46,883 --> 00:50:48,523
And who is this big glass of water?

676
00:50:48,623 --> 00:50:51,395
Joseph, it is Christy Miller country singer.

677
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:53,126
Hello, nice to meet you.

678
00:50:53,226 --> 00:50:54,997
Charles. Come here.

679
00:50:55,097 --> 00:50:56,366
Who, me?

680
00:50:56,466 --> 00:50:59,099
Charles is like
the absent-minded professor.

681
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,902
- What? Who?
- Charles.

682
00:51:01,002 --> 00:51:04,468
He is Charles. Charles, she is Dolores.

683
00:51:04,568 --> 00:51:08,242
- Hello, Charles.
- Nice... know, Dolores.

684
00:51:08,342 --> 00:51:10,722
And this is Joseph, Charles.

685
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,115
- Hey, who are you?
- I'm Charles, Joseph, how are you?

686
00:51:15,215 --> 00:51:17,020
- I am Joseph.
- Good.

687
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,120
Hello.

688
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,459
This way.

689
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:26,185
And at any time the groom, right?

690
00:52:26,285 --> 00:52:27,716
No, the husband.

691
00:52:27,816 --> 00:52:29,922
- Is the husband?
- And the son.

692
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:32,295
Do you agree?

693
00:52:32,395 --> 00:52:34,543
Ah, yes, there it goes.

694
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,731
LIQUIDATION...

695
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,815
- Do you like this?
- Yes.

696
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,957
- Hey, no skating here.
- Yeah, agreed.

697
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,846
Come, come, come on.

698
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,707
You said just a week, Dad, right?

699
00:56:04,807 --> 00:56:06,336
Maybe more, maybe less.

700
00:56:06,436 --> 00:56:08,540
- May depend on your mother.
- Dad.

701
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,532
Well, look after your mother.

702
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,537
Goodbye, Angie.

703
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,818
The two behave yourselves.

704
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,822
The other side of the disc works well...

705
00:57:23,922 --> 00:57:26,051
...will also be a success.
This very excited about it.

706
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,027
- Do not you think, Charles?
- Sure.

707
00:57:28,127 --> 00:57:29,528
Sure. What?

708
00:57:29,628 --> 00:57:31,723
Gosh, really distracted.

709
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,562
Dolly was telling the disk,

710
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:36,194
how excited I am. It
fantastic, the trials were hard...

711
00:57:36,294 --> 00:57:38,067
...but are great Do not you agree?

712
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:39,331
What are you looking at?

713
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:40,736
Christy, what time did you say Friday?

714
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:42,240
At 8:00.
- At 8:00, right. Do they come, girls,

715
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,265
Friday night on the street Greene?

716
00:57:43,365 --> 00:57:44,298
Yes.

717
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:45,835
You're acting very peculiar, Charles.

718
00:57:45,935 --> 00:57:48,746
Anyway, it's Friday. At what time
Tonight we, Charles?

719
00:57:48,846 --> 00:57:51,046
- Where is fine.
- Arriving late to class.

720
00:57:51,146 --> 00:57:52,073
We better go.

721
00:57:52,173 --> 00:57:53,608
Heavens, I agree.

722
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:56,053
- The dog, the dog.
- Bye, girls.

723
00:57:56,153 --> 00:57:57,680
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Dolly, nice to meet you.

724
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,590
- Bye, I'll call you later.
- Bye, Joseph.

725
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:02,060
Christy, here. Then I'll see tonight, right?

726
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,324
One minute, Charles. Coming to take
something to my house?

727
00:58:04,424 --> 00:58:06,263
I can not really, Christy. I re...

728
00:58:06,363 --> 00:58:08,596
Charles, you are tense,
nervous and apprehensive.

729
00:58:08,696 --> 00:58:10,363
We will go to my apartment right now.

730
00:58:10,463 --> 00:58:12,099
I do not want to hear another word.

731
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:14,834
- Well, I do feel tense...
- Taxi.

732
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,968
I can not believe Charles,
really I can not.

733
00:58:18,068 --> 00:58:20,325
The dog is hurt. Charles.

734
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,588
- I cover the cost.
- Take off your skates.

735
00:58:32,688 --> 00:58:34,320
- What?
- Take off your skates.

736
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:38,047
- Do you think we should go?
- We're going to pick it up.

737
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,147
My God.

738
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:44,631
Your father is good for this.

739
00:58:44,731 --> 00:58:46,195
I do not.

740
00:58:46,295 --> 00:58:48,264
Well, it is very difficult.

741
00:58:48,364 --> 00:58:50,640
- Want to try?
- What you had in mind, Laura?

742
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,009
- Nice.
- Laura, Laura, face in the half,

743
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:54,639
give my son a rifle. Give a rifle.

744
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,706
- Thanks, Dad.
- It's not really your son.

745
00:58:56,806 --> 00:58:58,649
Sure, the hair curling to shame.

746
00:58:58,749 --> 00:59:00,585
My son is a hippy aged.

747
00:59:00,685 --> 00:59:02,611
- Finally.
- My God, I thought I was.

748
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:04,714
- I think it was you.
- Thanks, buddy.

749
00:59:04,814 --> 00:59:07,317
What is it, brother? Do you
Polish accent? What is that?

750
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:09,351
- Me? No, English.
- Really? Excuse me...

751
00:59:09,451 --> 00:59:11,488
Come Viville. Let's see some action.

752
00:59:11,588 --> 00:59:13,055
Laura, I read your mind.

753
00:59:13,155 --> 00:59:14,657
There.

754
00:59:14,757 --> 00:59:17,499
- Congratulations.
- Slow down, take your time, Arthur.

755
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,665
- Yes, Arthur, slowly.
- It's open shot, I can not miss.

756
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,139
You gave everything except what you want.

757
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,471
It is the story of my life, honey.

758
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:25,477
- Maybe he should point to.
- What say you, Mitchell?

759
00:59:25,577 --> 00:59:27,069
- Michael.
- Hi, Mike, I'm Arthur.

760
00:59:27,169 --> 00:59:28,238
That's my dad, and that, John.

761
00:59:28,338 --> 00:59:30,180
- Come on, honey, it's late.
- Just a second.

762
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,616
You have to aim carefully...

763
00:59:31,716 --> 00:59:33,312
...to the bottom of the light.

764
00:59:33,412 --> 00:59:35,116
Then you have to slowly squeeze.

765
00:59:35,216 --> 00:59:36,782
I can not believe it. You're a prince.

766
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:39,155
- Prince Mike, thanks for the advice.
- Nothing.

767
00:59:39,255 --> 00:59:41,421
- Goodbye, nice to...
- Listen, Mike, something more.

768
00:59:41,521 --> 00:59:42,793
Did you ever play checkers by computers?

769
00:59:42,893 --> 00:59:44,126
No, I do not.

770
00:59:44,226 --> 00:59:46,564
Laura, would you mind showing
my son and me some moves?

771
00:59:46,664 --> 00:59:48,567
I have a hunch you know them.

772
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:51,557
It's pretty good, what do you say?

773
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:21,315
Puzzle, puzzle.

774
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,589
Please, my husband I still do.

775
01:00:43,689 --> 01:00:45,689
Yes, I know.

776
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:48,939
I am following.

777
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:58,635
- I do not know what to say.
- Me neither.

778
01:00:58,735 --> 01:01:00,230
Why not have lunch and talk about it?

779
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:02,241
Sorry, that is not possible.

780
01:01:02,341 --> 01:01:03,799
Of course it's possible.

781
01:01:03,899 --> 01:01:06,311
It can be difficult, but definitely possible.

782
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:08,644
Now you bring your child I will bring mine.

783
01:01:08,744 --> 01:01:11,700
That is not his son, Mr. Russo.

784
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:16,718
Michael, are we?

785
01:01:16,818 --> 01:01:18,223
- You said that?
- Quiet.

786
01:01:18,323 --> 01:01:19,918
- Sorry.
- Tell me what, honey?

787
01:01:20,018 --> 01:01:22,223
- They work in secrecy.
- Top secret.

788
01:01:22,323 --> 01:01:24,423
Yes, and we should not tell anyone
who knew them.

789
01:01:24,523 --> 01:01:27,433
They are in covert mission. So the hair.

790
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:29,662
- I see.
- They need our help.

791
01:01:29,762 --> 01:01:32,569
You two think of everything.

792
01:01:32,669 --> 01:01:34,669
Come on.

793
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,973
Laura, see you after work.

794
01:01:38,073 --> 01:01:40,309
- Yes? Too bad.
- Better than none.

795
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:43,247
- For the penguin.
- See you later.

796
01:01:43,347 --> 01:01:45,982
- Is in love with me.
- I noticed.

797
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:50,285
Mike, do you have a girlfriend?

798
01:01:50,385 --> 01:01:52,814
- Two or three, nothing serious.
- Already have a stable.

799
01:01:52,914 --> 01:01:54,918
- Do not call it stable.
- Chiquita...

800
01:01:55,018 --> 01:01:58,078
I'll continue until you change mind.

801
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:00,654
I guess that's your job.

802
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:05,916
- See you.
- Bye, see you.

803
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:14,773
- Dad?
- What?

804
01:02:14,873 --> 01:02:16,475
What do we do?

805
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,178
I do not know.

806
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:21,016
I think I better bring your sisters.

807
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:24,307
- To my sisters?
- Tell them to go to work.

808
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,407
Yes.

809
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:32,463
Here we are, home at last.

810
01:02:32,563 --> 01:02:35,058
Do not make much mess, Harold,
be a good boy.

811
01:02:35,158 --> 01:02:37,434
Yes, Charles, just put it there.
Go ahead, Charles.

812
01:02:37,534 --> 01:02:39,267
Calm down, Charles, calm down.

813
01:02:39,367 --> 01:02:41,273
Is not it lovely? Do you hate dogs, honey?

814
01:02:41,373 --> 01:02:43,332
- Because I can lock him up.
- No, not at all.

815
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:45,606
A record, Charles. Want to hear?

816
01:02:45,706 --> 01:02:47,545
Sure. Nice view.

817
01:02:47,645 --> 01:02:50,413
Thank you, Charles. Why do not you
feel? Get comfortable.

818
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:52,111
Can I get you a drink?

819
01:02:52,211 --> 01:02:53,846
Yes, Harold. Calm down, dear.

820
01:02:53,946 --> 01:02:56,980
- Do you have vodka?
- Indeed yes, Charles.

821
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,389
Do you have a match somewhere, Christy?

822
01:02:59,489 --> 01:03:00,915
On the way, honey,

823
01:03:01,015 --> 01:03:03,394
but that smoking probably is a year ago.

824
01:03:03,494 --> 01:03:05,572
All right.

825
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,545
How are you, Charles?

826
01:03:23,645 --> 01:03:26,211
- Harold bother you?
- No, no. All right.

827
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:28,311
Thank you.

828
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:32,885
- Do not you love that song?
- It's very pretty.

829
01:03:32,985 --> 01:03:35,155
Here, Charles, but do not approve.

830
01:03:35,255 --> 01:03:37,465
Want to sit back, Charles?

831
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,258
I really do not feel very good Christy.

832
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:43,734
Do not, Charles? What is it?

833
01:03:43,834 --> 01:03:46,204
- I think I have a headache.
- Okay, Charles.

834
01:03:46,304 --> 01:03:48,572
- We have to do anything.
- Why do not we talk and nothing more?

835
01:03:48,672 --> 01:03:51,168
Sure. Want a massage Charles?

836
01:03:51,268 --> 01:03:53,007
Why do not you give acupressure?

837
01:03:53,107 --> 01:03:54,910
- What?
- Acupressure.

838
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:57,415
- Acupressure.
- I will relieve all the pressure.

839
01:03:57,515 --> 01:03:59,384
You'll feel like a cloud pants.

840
01:03:59,484 --> 01:04:01,352
- A cloud in trousers?
- Come on.

841
01:04:01,452 --> 01:04:03,355
- What?
- You have to sit back, Charles.

842
01:04:03,455 --> 01:04:05,964
Now, do not hurt.

843
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,255
How beautiful how music does that
there, do not you think?

844
01:04:10,355 --> 01:04:12,128
- Very nice.
- Not yet decorum that room.

845
01:04:12,228 --> 01:04:16,818
Look, I have a terrace.
Will you go out to the terrace?

846
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:20,601
That's not a terrace, Christy, is a ledge.

847
01:04:20,701 --> 01:04:23,473
- No, seriously, Charles, come on.
- No, Christy, no.

848
01:04:23,573 --> 01:04:27,143
Heaven, Charles, today you really nervous.

849
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:31,573
Now take off your tie, jacket
and shirt, honey.

850
01:04:31,673 --> 01:04:33,673
Be right back.

851
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:49,909
Want to play on the terrace, Harold?

852
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:54,538
Charles, I can not give Acupressure.

853
01:04:54,638 --> 01:04:57,065
- If you stand in a corner.
- Christy, I do not.

854
01:04:57,165 --> 01:04:59,271
- I really feel like...
- Of course not, Charles.

855
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:01,439
I'll give you acupressure...

856
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:03,505
...and then you go to enlist tonight.

857
01:05:03,605 --> 01:05:05,779
Now come on, lie down here.

858
01:05:05,879 --> 01:05:07,309
Is not it beautiful? Wants to play.

859
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:09,378
Calm down, Harold. Charles is very tense.

860
01:05:09,478 --> 01:05:11,617
Had a bad day. Come on, Charles, lie.

861
01:05:11,717 --> 01:05:14,148
Will not you take off some clothes?

862
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:16,491
- You will feel more comfortable.
- No, okay.

863
01:05:16,591 --> 01:05:18,258
I'm pretty comfortable.

864
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:21,960
It is enough, Harold.
Leave in peace Charles.

865
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:24,299
Let's give acupressure Charles.

866
01:05:24,399 --> 01:05:27,034
Here we go, Charles. Just relax.

867
01:05:27,126 --> 01:05:29,735
- Is not it nice the song?
- Very nice.

868
01:05:29,835 --> 01:05:32,573
- Do you feel my finger?
- Yeah, right.

869
01:05:32,673 --> 01:05:35,308
Well, just concentrate feel it.

870
01:05:35,391 --> 01:05:36,873
Do you feel my finger?

871
01:05:36,973 --> 01:05:39,441
- Tell me, Charles.
- Yes.

872
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:42,805
Close your eyes, dear, and feel my finger.

873
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,285
- Do you feel my finger?
- Yes.

874
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:51,862
- Do you feel my finger?
- Yes.

875
01:05:51,962 --> 01:05:54,366
- Do you feel my finger?
- Christy, not really think I can...

876
01:05:54,466 --> 01:05:56,129
I feel too much pressure here.

877
01:05:56,229 --> 01:05:59,799
- Do you feel my finger?
- Yes, sorry, but...

878
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:10,304
Just hold me, Charles.
We do not have to do anything.

879
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:13,124
Put your arms around me Charles.

880
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,541
No... anything.

881
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,365
- Do you feel my finger?
- Christy.

882
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,957
- Do you feel my finger?
- Yes, but...

883
01:06:28,057 --> 01:06:30,264
- Do you feel my finger?
- Yes.

884
01:06:30,364 --> 01:06:32,794
- Charles.
- Yes?

885
01:06:32,894 --> 01:06:36,039
- Do you feel my finger?
- Christy, I...

886
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:43,263
Do you feel my finger?

887
01:06:43,343 --> 01:06:44,910
This is a little crazy, right?

888
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,442
Yes Do you feel my finger?

889
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:49,545
Yes Oh, God.

890
01:06:49,645 --> 01:06:53,385
- What is it, Charles?
- Do you feel my finger?

891
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:03,673
Sorry, honey. It could be my agent.

892
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,251
Sure, I feel much better.

893
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:10,966
Hello? Who? Did Joseph?

894
01:07:11,066 --> 01:07:13,035
Hello, Jose, how are you? Joseph.

895
01:07:13,135 --> 01:07:14,603
- Did something happen?
- What?

896
01:07:14,703 --> 01:07:16,513
One moment, Joseph. Calm down, Charles.

897
01:07:16,613 --> 01:07:20,369
He just wants to know the time for this
night. Send a car.

898
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,115
At 8:00 is okay, honey. I can not wait.

899
01:07:23,215 --> 01:07:24,747
I said I can not wait.

900
01:07:24,847 --> 01:07:26,951
Wait. What?

901
01:07:27,051 --> 01:07:29,359
No matter, Joe. We'll see you tonight.

902
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:31,329
This guy is very attractive,

903
01:07:31,429 --> 01:07:33,628
but I do not understand language.

904
01:07:33,728 --> 01:07:36,499
Everyone has that problem ever, Christy.

905
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:39,095
- Do not you think?
- Sure.

906
01:07:39,195 --> 01:07:41,575
Kiss me again, yes, Charles?

907
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,133
I really like you, Christy, Did you know?

908
01:07:44,233 --> 01:07:46,838
Yes, I know, and why not keep it
well, right?

909
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:49,313
- Do not you think?
- Yes, I suppose.

910
01:07:49,413 --> 01:07:54,258
But why do not you kiss me
anyway? It's so nice afternoon.

911
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,316
Well, here.

912
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:19,544
Well, come on foot.
Grab your skates and went inside.

913
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:46,054
Here we go, my beautiful girls.

914
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:16,324
Sorry. Are these seats are occupied?

915
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,230
By the way, have you seen Arthur?

916
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:21,102
Yes Where is Arthur?

917
01:09:21,202 --> 01:09:22,903
Where's Arthur?

918
01:09:23,003 --> 01:09:25,003
I thought it was you.

919
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:26,637
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

920
01:09:26,737 --> 01:09:28,737
- Not laced.
- God.

921
01:09:28,815 --> 01:09:30,342
Arthur, of where did you get?

922
01:09:30,442 --> 01:09:32,180
- We are your sisters.
- We are your sisters...

923
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,810
- They are my sisters.
- Ah, yes.

924
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:36,463
Are your sisters.

925
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:40,089
I really fell into it, right?

926
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:42,924
- I'm not saying...
- I do not think she says...

927
01:09:43,024 --> 01:09:44,931
- Arthur always cares.
- Arthur is accustomed to children.

928
01:09:45,031 --> 01:09:47,091
You say you do not trust me...

929
01:09:47,191 --> 01:09:48,930
...to care for these three Dwarfs?

930
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:51,198
No, I do not know Who takes care of me.

931
01:09:51,298 --> 01:09:53,137
- John.
- That's what I'm afraid.

932
01:09:53,237 --> 01:09:54,730
You talk nonsense, mother.

933
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,502
The evening does not make sense.

934
01:09:56,602 --> 01:09:58,773
- John is very good with women.
- You have many girlfriends.

935
01:09:58,873 --> 01:10:01,644
- Would you shut up?
- Come on, leave it on site.

936
01:10:01,744 --> 01:10:04,209
- No.
- That's great, Mr. Russo.

937
01:10:04,294 --> 01:10:05,980
Mom, I promise that we will care.

938
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,612
- Iran to skate.
- Yes, waiting there.

939
01:10:08,712 --> 01:10:10,588
- The wait there.
- Thanks, Mom.

940
01:10:10,688 --> 01:10:12,319
- I said yes.
- You did not say no.

941
01:10:12,419 --> 01:10:14,588
- The child is right.
- Come on, get a taxi.

942
01:10:14,688 --> 01:10:16,185
Arthur, look after them.

943
01:10:16,285 --> 01:10:18,822
- Do not worry.
- Taxi, taxi.

944
01:10:18,922 --> 01:10:21,833
As for you, you forgot of it before.

945
01:10:21,933 --> 01:10:24,335
Oh yeah? Well, not mine, is it.

946
01:10:24,435 --> 01:10:26,804
Here you go. See you later, Dad. You too.

947
01:10:26,904 --> 01:10:29,273
- Take care.
- Michael, take care.

948
01:10:29,373 --> 01:10:30,775
- Do not worry.
- Do not worry.

949
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:32,276
- Bye, Johnny.
- Bye, Johnny.

950
01:10:32,376 --> 01:10:34,677
- You're amazing.
- Come on, Stefania...

951
01:10:34,777 --> 01:10:37,667
Why you have to repeat everything?

952
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:42,654
- I could never deal with men.
- I know what you mean.

953
01:10:42,754 --> 01:10:45,219
- You bet.
- No, not with women.

954
01:10:45,304 --> 01:10:46,818
I, with women.

955
01:10:46,918 --> 01:10:49,293
You say you do not know deal with women?

956
01:10:49,393 --> 01:10:51,660
You? How funny.

957
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,790
You are a professional, Mr. Russo.

958
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,801
- Women are their line.
- Why do not you call me Johnny...

959
01:10:55,901 --> 01:10:57,529
...or Jack, or Jake or Harry?

960
01:10:57,629 --> 01:11:00,334
- Whatever you want...
- Do I have reason or not, Mr. Russo?

961
01:11:00,434 --> 01:11:03,749
- About what?
- That women are their line.

962
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:06,367
Could be.

963
01:11:06,467 --> 01:11:08,107
That proves nothing.

964
01:11:08,207 --> 01:11:10,377
Only really matters falling in love.

965
01:11:10,477 --> 01:11:14,069
Because when you fall in love,
no one is professional.

966
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:17,316
Well, what if a girl
falls in love with a professional...

967
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:19,688
...and the professional is not reciprocal?

968
01:11:19,788 --> 01:11:21,788
The girl has a problem.

969
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:26,125
Are we talking about someone you know?

970
01:11:26,225 --> 01:11:28,225
Only slightly.

971
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:32,764
Are you in love right now Mr. Russo?

972
01:11:32,864 --> 01:11:35,330
I mean, personally.

973
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:38,673
On a personal level, no. Do you?

974
01:11:38,773 --> 01:11:40,543
It's a silly question. I am married.

975
01:11:40,643 --> 01:11:42,643
That's why I asked.

976
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:46,741
Mr. Russo, promise me never get married.

977
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:48,980
I promise.

978
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,140
Promise you will never fell in love.

979
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:55,293
I promise.

980
01:11:55,393 --> 01:11:57,858
Mr. Russo, he begins to like.

981
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,775
Honey, if you like the country,
I love this place.

982
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:17,804
What? What?

983
01:12:17,904 --> 01:12:19,374
Country is the best place, Joseph.

984
01:12:19,474 --> 01:12:20,942
I love music West, you know?

985
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:23,614
- Can you really sing?
- Has a hit record, Joseph.

986
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,714
You hear that, Charles?

987
01:12:25,792 --> 01:12:27,182
- He heard it, honey.
- What?

988
01:12:27,282 --> 01:12:29,282
- What? What?
- What?

989
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:36,943
Ladies and gentlemen,

990
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,953
Christy Miller is with us
tonight in the audience.

991
01:13:39,053 --> 01:13:41,432
She believes it is his night off
but we will give.

992
01:13:41,532 --> 01:13:43,298
Up here, Christy.

993
01:13:43,398 --> 01:13:45,398
Sing with us.

994
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:30,831
Come on. All singing.

995
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:59,869
Ladies and gentlemen, Christy Miller.

996
01:14:59,969 --> 01:15:01,969
Thanks, Christy.

997
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,600
- This is funny.
- What?

998
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:34,373
I was going to buy you a drink.
I live here.

999
01:15:34,473 --> 01:15:36,473
What a coincidence.

1000
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:39,951
But I see that my friend used the house.
A taxi driver I know.

1001
01:15:40,051 --> 01:15:41,850
That is his taxi.

1002
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:44,082
Do they use it, or you are...?

1003
01:15:44,182 --> 01:15:45,714
No, no, just hang out.

1004
01:15:45,814 --> 01:15:48,089
Oh well, I'll chaperone.

1005
01:15:48,189 --> 01:15:50,484
- Where is that drink?
- Here.

1006
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:01,516
- Your friend loves music.
- I like it.

1007
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:08,203
- It's me, Sam.
- I was going to drop you a note.

1008
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:11,211
She is Angela, Sam.

1009
01:16:11,311 --> 01:16:13,081
Hi, Deborah.

1010
01:16:13,181 --> 01:16:15,018
- Just me going.
- Hi, Deborah.

1011
01:16:15,118 --> 01:16:16,543
What are you drinking?

1012
01:16:16,643 --> 01:16:18,317
I have to work. I drive a taxi.

1013
01:16:18,417 --> 01:16:20,052
Yes, he said. I'll have a Scotch.

1014
01:16:20,152 --> 01:16:21,582
- Do you enjoy?
- How?

1015
01:16:21,682 --> 01:16:23,151
- Okay.
- Pure, thanks.

1016
01:16:23,251 --> 01:16:26,062
Management for my dad.
Had a slight... you know.

1017
01:16:26,162 --> 01:16:27,793
Sorry, how are you?

1018
01:16:27,893 --> 01:16:29,893
Great... will be great.

1019
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:32,894
Goodbye. I left the keys on the table.

1020
01:16:32,994 --> 01:16:34,994
Thanks for the house.

1021
01:16:35,087 --> 01:16:36,634
- Sure, Sam. Anytime.
- Goodbye.

1022
01:16:36,734 --> 01:16:38,734
Nice to meet you.

1023
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:44,912
Why do you call Sam?

1024
01:16:45,012 --> 01:16:46,941
Because it looks like a Deborah.

1025
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:48,612
Well, not like a Sam.

1026
01:16:48,712 --> 01:16:50,781
Sam seems more than Deborah.

1027
01:16:50,881 --> 01:16:54,155
- So why do not you call me Steve?
- Well, Steve.

1028
01:16:54,255 --> 01:16:56,255
But you seem a Angela.

1029
01:16:56,354 --> 01:16:57,922
How do you 'Angela'?

1030
01:16:58,022 --> 01:17:00,062
It means 'angel', right?

1031
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,666
Now you know why my husband I still do.

1032
01:17:07,766 --> 01:17:10,402
I am a woman who blatant
can not be trusted.

1033
01:17:10,502 --> 01:17:14,139
I had another idea.

1034
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:17,376
Reminded me of someone
whom I met at school.

1035
01:17:17,476 --> 01:17:19,748
My sister in eighth grade.

1036
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:21,650
He loved her.

1037
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,679
Surely it with me too.

1038
01:17:24,779 --> 01:17:27,658
But I waited for her make the first move.

1039
01:17:27,758 --> 01:17:29,758
What did?

1040
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,146
Just do it.

1041
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,571
I think it's sexy to have that car...

1042
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,309
...follow us the whole way.

1043
01:17:50,409 --> 01:17:52,214
Charles And why?

1044
01:17:52,314 --> 01:17:54,184
Are you in love or am I crazy?

1045
01:17:54,284 --> 01:17:57,154
It seemed a bit obvious that he wanted
take your friend home alone.

1046
01:17:57,254 --> 01:17:59,316
Oh, just, yes.

1047
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:01,656
You are incredibly beautiful.

1048
01:18:01,756 --> 01:18:03,285
Are you rich or something, honey?

1049
01:18:03,385 --> 01:18:06,700
- A little.
- I think I'm falling in love.

1050
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:08,791
Love? Do you want love?

1051
01:18:08,891 --> 01:18:11,029
Yes, bright eyes. How old are you?

1052
01:18:11,129 --> 01:18:13,230
- Me? 19.
- Not true.

1053
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:15,330
Will soon turn 20.

1054
01:18:15,408 --> 01:18:17,873
Well, there's no rush, honey.

1055
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:27,476
I came to drink, yes?

1056
01:18:27,576 --> 01:18:29,576
You came to drink, no.

1057
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:34,506
I have to rehearse early in the morning.

1058
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:39,410
I have to rehearse too early.

1059
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,545
But call me.

1060
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:57,997
This is fine.

1061
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:02,845
- Well...
- Well.

1062
01:19:02,945 --> 01:19:04,015
I must go, my husband...

1063
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:06,665
Yes, I... I just get up early.

1064
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:10,176
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1065
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,614
Go ahead, slowly.

1066
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:29,088
Good evening, sir.

1067
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:51,843
Pumpkin.

1068
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:54,996
Pumpkin, what is there?

1069
01:20:55,096 --> 01:20:57,524
What do you smell there?

1070
01:20:57,624 --> 01:20:59,624
Come on.

1071
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:03,804
What is it, Pumpkin?

1072
01:21:03,904 --> 01:21:06,759
What is it, Pumpkin? What is it?

1073
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:12,412
Charles, what are you doing down there?

1074
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:18,196
I could not leave.

1075
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:38,565
What work, Charles? I never said it.

1076
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:41,804
I am a travel agent.

1077
01:21:41,904 --> 01:21:45,544
You know, travel, trains, planes...

1078
01:21:45,644 --> 01:21:47,677
...bus, all that.

1079
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:50,916
What... rare.

1080
01:21:51,016 --> 01:21:53,016
Yes? Why?

1081
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,296
Do not look like a travel agent.

1082
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:01,226
- No.
- No.

1083
01:22:01,326 --> 01:22:03,580
What look like then?

1084
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,975
I do not know exactly travel agent but, no.

1085
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:11,324
- Maybe...
- Yes?

1086
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,928
It's more like...

1087
01:22:15,997 --> 01:22:17,997
...someone who travels.

1088
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:00,973
Take us to Foley Square.

1089
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:19,059
What are you doing?
Do not you know do not work?

1090
01:24:19,159 --> 01:24:20,697
It's an emergency.
Want to continue the taxi?

1091
01:24:20,797 --> 01:24:22,400
- Just drive, sorry.
- What taxi?

1092
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:26,240
That there. I'll show you,
just drive, we go.

1093
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,580
Sorry I'm late.

1094
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,348
Okay, boss, Need help?

1095
01:24:36,448 --> 01:24:39,083
- What?
- No, thank you very much.

1096
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:55,315
Hey, buddy.

1097
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:38,264
Sorry...

1098
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:01,334
Hello, sir, sorry to be late.

1099
01:26:01,434 --> 01:26:06,024
Hey guys, wait until you tell them
who just see here...

1100
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:19,038
Ms. Niota.

1101
01:26:19,118 --> 01:26:21,117
Sorry, Ms. Niota, just come this for you.

1102
01:26:21,217 --> 01:26:22,148
Thank you.

1103
01:26:22,248 --> 01:26:25,563
Okay, it's her husband. Have a nice day.

1104
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:29,348
Mom, come on foot.

1105
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:33,401
- What?
- Nothing, dear.

1106
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:36,236
Look, it's your father.
Return home tonight.

1107
01:26:36,336 --> 01:26:37,707
Really? Good.

1108
01:26:37,807 --> 01:26:39,972
Not so much, we're leaving tomorrow.

1109
01:26:40,072 --> 01:26:42,536
¿Go? I thought it would be two weeks
and spent only one.

1110
01:26:42,636 --> 01:26:44,138
Something must have happened.

1111
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:46,707
What would you say to Georgina?
It will be so disappointed.

1112
01:26:46,807 --> 01:26:49,117
- And you, little boy?
- I too am disappointed.

1113
01:26:49,217 --> 01:26:51,331
Well, then we all are.

1114
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:57,920
- Have a good day, sweetie.
- Bye, see you tonight.

1115
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:00,400
Do not think about tomorrow.

1116
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:11,268
Where to, lady?

1117
01:27:11,368 --> 01:27:13,578
No, that's all, thank you.

1118
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:17,096
- There.
- Thank you.

1119
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,822
What are you looking clown?

1120
01:27:35,922 --> 01:27:38,392
A vision in Stuyvesant.

1121
01:27:38,492 --> 01:27:41,303
They should stay here fix the place.

1122
01:27:41,403 --> 01:27:43,403
Are not we happy?

1123
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,626
Did you see Arthur?

1124
01:28:11,726 --> 01:28:14,365
If I see him cut off the instrument.

1125
01:28:14,465 --> 01:28:16,514
Well, I will.

1126
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,611
- Five minutes angel.
- Insurance.

1127
01:28:22,711 --> 01:28:24,711
Five minutes.

1128
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,805
Angela.

1129
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:53,939
It makes no sense, Johnny, not after
the last four days.

1130
01:28:54,039 --> 01:28:56,071
- It does not.
- Where the hell is Amy?

1131
01:28:56,171 --> 01:28:58,211
- Where is Leon?
- In here.

1132
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:05,495
- Leon?
- Here, for the love of God.

1133
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:20,261
Charles was trying to communicate you.

1134
01:29:20,361 --> 01:29:22,432
Ms. Martin seems to have Mr. Martin left.

1135
01:29:22,532 --> 01:29:23,463
He left a note.

1136
01:29:23,563 --> 01:29:26,068
- Where did it go?
- It was my fervent hope...

1137
01:29:26,168 --> 01:29:28,135
...you to have the answer, Charles.

1138
01:29:28,235 --> 01:29:30,943
After all, Mr. Martin we
pays for that very answer.

1139
01:29:31,043 --> 01:29:32,505
What do you mean with where he went?

1140
01:29:32,605 --> 01:29:34,314
Have not you followed this morning?

1141
01:29:34,414 --> 01:29:37,048
- Is your day off?
- I lost it, Leon.

1142
01:29:37,148 --> 01:29:39,386
What wonderful news.

1143
01:29:39,486 --> 01:29:41,984
Around City Hall. They just disappeared.

1144
01:29:42,084 --> 01:29:44,187
- I searched and searched.
- Who disappeared?

1145
01:29:44,287 --> 01:29:47,095
Joseph and her. They had luggage.

1146
01:29:47,195 --> 01:29:50,850
- Who is Joseph? Does the boyfriend?
- Well...

1147
01:29:53,121 --> 01:29:55,096
I guess you could say that.

1148
01:29:55,196 --> 01:29:56,970
Do you suppose you could say that?

1149
01:29:57,070 --> 01:30:00,102
Charles, you talk nonsense.

1150
01:30:00,202 --> 01:30:02,045
I want you to find out where woman...

1151
01:30:02,145 --> 01:30:03,638
...and I want to do it soon.

1152
01:30:03,738 --> 01:30:05,205
Because if we do not find,

1153
01:30:05,305 --> 01:30:07,376
will be difficult for Mr. Martin...

1154
01:30:07,476 --> 01:30:09,579
...justify pay us.

1155
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:11,747
It was a wonderful morning so far.

1156
01:30:11,847 --> 01:30:13,381
Niota The case is over.

1157
01:30:13,481 --> 01:30:15,119
No I told you.

1158
01:30:15,219 --> 01:30:17,024
- No.
- Come, gentlemen.

1159
01:30:17,124 --> 01:30:19,155
Martin Hall to the girl.
What are you waiting for?

1160
01:30:19,255 --> 01:30:23,165
Arthur, look for us new secretary.
Amy left us.

1161
01:30:25,019 --> 01:30:27,267
Niota What about?
I thought it was two weeks.

1162
01:30:27,367 --> 01:30:29,171
You must return to London for business.

1163
01:30:29,271 --> 01:30:30,799
I do not know. Arrive at midnight.

1164
01:30:30,899 --> 01:30:32,503
All will go tomorrow.

1165
01:30:32,603 --> 01:30:34,670
- John, I'm mortified.
- She'll come back, Leon.

1166
01:30:34,770 --> 01:30:36,407
- You think so?
- Insurance.

1167
01:30:36,507 --> 01:30:38,813
I guess... you have guessed...

1168
01:30:38,913 --> 01:30:40,374
From the beginning.

1169
01:30:40,474 --> 01:30:42,545
- When?
- For the past three years.

1170
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:44,613
Have you heard for three years
and never tell me?

1171
01:30:44,713 --> 01:30:46,247
- Yes, indeed.
- God.

1172
01:30:46,347 --> 01:30:47,882
Everyone knows it.

1173
01:30:47,982 --> 01:30:49,449
I do not know what to do.

1174
01:30:49,549 --> 01:30:51,603
Who knows?

1175
01:30:56,184 --> 01:30:58,398
- Good morning everyone.
- Wait.

1176
01:30:58,498 --> 01:31:01,098
- Christy, why are you here?
- I hope you all come...

1177
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:03,233
...the new show tonight.
And what they think of these leaflets?

1178
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:06,141
Are not they beautiful?
The album works so well...

1179
01:31:06,241 --> 01:31:07,838
...are beginning to invest money.

1180
01:31:07,938 --> 01:31:09,507
The magazine 'People' want an interview.

1181
01:31:09,607 --> 01:31:12,744
The mention as good in bed, honey,

1182
01:31:12,844 --> 01:31:14,752
But detectives are terrible.

1183
01:31:14,852 --> 01:31:17,220
They could not keep an elephant
on Fifth Avenue.

1184
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,917
The girls were drained
between your fingers like sand.

1185
01:31:20,017 --> 01:31:22,016
Christy, what are you talking?

1186
01:31:22,116 --> 01:31:24,755
- Do you know where are they?
- Charles, what are you talking about?

1187
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:26,319
What do you mean with 'what I mean?'.

1188
01:31:26,419 --> 01:31:28,390
How we could not continue
an elephant on Fifth Avenue?

1189
01:31:28,490 --> 01:31:30,560
Gosh, you're very nervous this morning.

1190
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:32,125
Did you have a bad day in court?

1191
01:31:32,225 --> 01:31:33,968
Did you hear that? Know where they are.

1192
01:31:34,068 --> 01:31:36,530
- Where is Christy?
- Today you do not shave, Charles.

1193
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:39,509
- Do you let your beard?
- Johnny, can you help us?

1194
01:31:39,609 --> 01:31:42,377
What they all talk?
What has she to do with this?

1195
01:31:42,477 --> 01:31:45,280
Are you kidding? Christy Miller knows all
what everyone in the city.

1196
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:46,909
- You probably know where is Amy.
- Yes.

1197
01:31:47,009 --> 01:31:48,475
- See?
- What?

1198
01:31:48,575 --> 01:31:50,419
- It's in the toilet.
- Agreed.

1199
01:31:50,519 --> 01:31:51,979
Barbara Jo is dumb.

1200
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:53,888
As Sylvia and Tulips.

1201
01:31:53,988 --> 01:31:56,155
- As Christy.
- Nobody knows anything.

1202
01:31:56,255 --> 01:31:58,253
- The girls agreed?
- What do you think?

1203
01:31:58,353 --> 01:32:00,561
- Come on, baby, give conditions.
- Wait a minute.

1204
01:32:00,661 --> 01:32:02,429
What does the toilet?

1205
01:32:02,529 --> 01:32:04,128
Go detectives.

1206
01:32:04,228 --> 01:32:05,999
Well, look who's here. Hi, Amy.

1207
01:32:06,099 --> 01:32:07,436
Hello, Christy.

1208
01:32:07,536 --> 01:32:09,581
Leon, say hello to Amy.

1209
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:14,018
- Hi, Amy.
- Hey, Leon.

1210
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:18,141
Well, folks, I gotta go. See you later.

1211
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:21,379
- I'll walk down, John.
- Christy, you can not go well.

1212
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:23,284
- Wait a minute?
- We miss you.

1213
01:32:23,384 --> 01:32:25,516
Thank you.

1214
01:32:25,616 --> 01:32:27,616
Is Ms. Leondopolous.

1215
01:32:27,693 --> 01:32:29,219
Can not say I'm here?

1216
01:32:29,319 --> 01:32:31,319
Tell him.

1217
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:37,952
Hello, I'm not here. I have long
delay. I'll call you later.

1218
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:40,052
Done.

1219
01:32:42,256 --> 01:32:44,256
Big deal.

1220
01:32:44,342 --> 01:32:46,342
Amy, I love you.

1221
01:32:46,405 --> 01:32:48,278
So why do not you kiss me?

1222
01:32:48,378 --> 01:32:51,076
¿Kiss you? There would... I did not think.

1223
01:32:51,176 --> 01:32:56,103
- That kiss would be appropriate, I mean...
- Will you shut up?

1224
01:32:56,203 --> 01:32:58,678
Christy, this is not very funny.

1225
01:32:58,778 --> 01:33:00,987
- Arthur, tell him not funny.
- It's not funny.

1226
01:33:01,087 --> 01:33:03,687
Have to wait for tonight affection.

1227
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:05,821
Only nine hours. Honestly, Charles.

1228
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:08,889
- I wonder who they are talking.
- I tell you.

1229
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:11,401
- Will you come tonight, Johnny?
- I'll try, girl.

1230
01:33:11,501 --> 01:33:13,699
- I know what that means.
- Look, Christy.

1231
01:33:13,799 --> 01:33:16,832
This is my job, right? It has nothing
to do with my personal interests.

1232
01:33:16,932 --> 01:33:18,433
Well, Charles, forgive me if I laugh.

1233
01:33:18,533 --> 01:33:20,239
Goodbye.

1234
01:33:20,339 --> 01:33:21,836
- Christy.
- Best.

1235
01:33:21,936 --> 01:33:24,006
- What?
- The follow.

1236
01:33:24,106 --> 01:33:26,106
Clever, huh?

1237
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:28,184
Yes, yes.

1238
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:31,479
- Look what I found.
- How are you, Sam?

1239
01:33:31,579 --> 01:33:34,218
- I can not complain, boss.
- Johnny.

1240
01:33:34,318 --> 01:33:36,522
- Another cab driver?
- Singer.

1241
01:33:36,622 --> 01:33:38,927
- Sorry to bother you. Hello, girls.
- Hello.

1242
01:33:39,027 --> 01:33:41,659
They told me the deal and business need.

1243
01:33:41,759 --> 01:33:43,189
- What I can do?
- I have one.

1244
01:33:43,289 --> 01:33:45,327
You're the singer, it's your show, right?

1245
01:33:45,427 --> 01:33:47,065
- Hi, Angela.
- Hi, Angela, I'm Christy.

1246
01:33:47,165 --> 01:33:48,799
Christy Miller Are You? Really?

1247
01:33:48,899 --> 01:33:51,034
There is some doubt about it, honey,
but thanks.

1248
01:33:51,134 --> 01:33:52,804
I love your album.

1249
01:33:52,904 --> 01:33:56,404
- Thanks, honey.
- Mr. Russo can enter your club?

1250
01:33:56,504 --> 01:34:00,701
- Perhaps you could take me tonight.
- If you can get in?

1251
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:03,015
I drive.

1252
01:34:03,115 --> 01:34:05,079
- Can you take, darling?
- Come on.

1253
01:34:05,179 --> 01:34:07,147
So long, boss. Take care of yourself.

1254
01:34:07,247 --> 01:34:08,818
Also, Sam.

1255
01:34:08,918 --> 01:34:12,295
- Thank you for smoking.
- Thanks for the fire.

1256
01:34:12,395 --> 01:34:15,822
I'll see tonight, but if they can
come, come whenever they want.

1257
01:34:15,922 --> 01:34:18,300
Goodbye, Johnny. Beware it, Angela.

1258
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,400
It's slippery as fish.

1259
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:25,500
Is it slippery as fish, Mr. Russo?

1260
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,065
I do not know, but I'm dizzy.

1261
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:31,107
I must say that you
very good taste in women.

1262
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:33,639
Which is more than can be said
about my taste in men.

1263
01:34:33,739 --> 01:34:36,118
Where does that leave me?

1264
01:34:36,218 --> 01:34:38,343
Hanging miserably I hope.

1265
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:42,891
Come on, show me the town.

1266
01:34:42,991 --> 01:34:45,286
Tell me your funny stories.

1267
01:34:46,747 --> 01:34:50,133
And take me back to your loft and Sedúceme.

1268
01:34:50,233 --> 01:34:51,691
You talk too much, you know?

1269
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:53,791
I know.

1270
01:35:01,729 --> 01:35:03,772
I can not believe you manage a taxi.

1271
01:35:03,872 --> 01:35:06,009
You have to be an actress,
model or something.

1272
01:35:06,109 --> 01:35:07,484
- You are beautiful.
- Thanks.

1273
01:35:07,584 --> 01:35:09,918
Used to model, but is a nuisance.

1274
01:35:10,018 --> 01:35:12,081
- You know...
- Everything is a hassle, honey,

1275
01:35:12,181 --> 01:35:14,319
- Unless you're in love.
- And that is a nuisance.

1276
01:35:14,419 --> 01:35:16,258
- The greatest.
- Yes.

1277
01:35:16,358 --> 01:35:18,887
- Where can I get that?
- I would love, love.

1278
01:35:18,987 --> 01:35:21,877
Boy, I love it. I could show you...

1279
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:44,211
Yes, here they come.

1280
01:35:44,311 --> 01:35:46,466
- What did I say?
- Wait.

1281
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,101
Do not go anywhere.

1282
01:36:01,201 --> 01:36:03,581
Stay there. Stay right there.

1283
01:36:05,025 --> 01:36:07,273
Where the hell believes that going?

1284
01:36:07,373 --> 01:36:09,923
Passing an intersection and...

1285
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:22,307
Hello, Mr. Russo.

1286
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:25,692
What fun now?

1287
01:36:25,792 --> 01:36:30,382
I never had a girl call me
sir at this particular time.

1288
01:36:31,552 --> 01:36:33,970
I have no time to call me 'Girl'.

1289
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:36,097
Neither had I felt like one.

1290
01:36:36,197 --> 01:36:38,577
Well, I feel like one to me.

1291
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:44,315
Could you say how long since...?

1292
01:36:44,732 --> 01:36:46,857
Did you feel like a girl?

1293
01:36:49,336 --> 01:36:52,481
- You get used to everything.
- Can you?

1294
01:36:55,609 --> 01:36:57,891
You know what makes me follow?

1295
01:36:57,991 --> 01:36:59,991
- I could guess.
- Yes?

1296
01:37:01,215 --> 01:37:03,258
Some think that whatever they do,

1297
01:37:03,358 --> 01:37:06,248
someone else should be doing well.

1298
01:37:25,206 --> 01:37:27,606
Where did you go recently?

1299
01:37:30,044 --> 01:37:32,044
Everywhere.

1300
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:43,418
Greene Street.

1301
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,760
Got a cigarette?

1302
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:23,854
Nothing more, right?

1303
01:38:23,926 --> 01:38:25,475
Makes sense.

1304
01:38:25,575 --> 01:38:27,040
What do you think I am a rat?

1305
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:29,780
So do an exchange.

1306
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,618
News Johnny news for Charles.

1307
01:38:32,718 --> 01:38:35,523
Look at the poor devil.

1308
01:38:35,623 --> 01:38:38,790
You've smoked two bundles today.
What do you do, kill him?

1309
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:41,821
Personally, I also came
late for an appointment.

1310
01:38:41,921 --> 01:38:43,663
Collect the son of Angela.

1311
01:38:43,763 --> 01:38:45,430
Forget the deal.

1312
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:47,062
I guess I have not heard to exchange.

1313
01:38:47,162 --> 01:38:48,731
What will you do later?

1314
01:38:48,831 --> 01:38:50,706
- Sleep.
- Do you want company?

1315
01:38:50,806 --> 01:38:53,073
- Welcome to the floor.
- I accept it.

1316
01:38:53,173 --> 01:38:55,408
You've got three girls there, curls.

1317
01:38:55,508 --> 01:38:57,209
What will you do with them?

1318
01:38:57,309 --> 01:38:58,682
Do you have a large floor?

1319
01:38:58,782 --> 01:39:00,581
It is a pleasure to meet you, Sam.

1320
01:39:00,681 --> 01:39:02,681
Similarly, doll.

1321
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:06,605
Thank you.

1322
01:39:17,318 --> 01:39:19,318
Thank you.

1323
01:39:20,154 --> 01:39:22,987
Come on. One, two, three, four.

1324
01:40:35,095 --> 01:40:37,928
Dolores, will you marry me?

1325
01:40:41,068 --> 01:40:43,714
Well, I will.

1326
01:40:43,814 --> 01:40:45,814
Will you?

1327
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:49,536
Well, yes, after my divorce.

1328
01:40:51,178 --> 01:40:53,028
Well, okay.

1329
01:40:53,128 --> 01:40:55,128
I can wait.

1330
01:41:33,287 --> 01:41:35,102
Hey, folks, is my fiance.

1331
01:41:35,202 --> 01:41:37,369
Is not it beautiful?

1332
01:41:37,469 --> 01:41:39,585
Goodbye.

1333
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:45,540
- I'm watching, curls.
- I know it is, Sam.

1334
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,142
- Are not you late?
- Yes, why do not you take me?

1335
01:41:48,242 --> 01:41:50,294
I thought about that.

1336
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:29,666
That's where I go pumpkin.

1337
01:42:34,915 --> 01:42:36,857
I regret that we did not see Christy's show.

1338
01:42:36,957 --> 01:42:38,595
Maybe we can tomorrow.

1339
01:42:38,695 --> 01:42:40,695
Yes, tomorrow. Sure.

1340
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:21,326
Goodbye, Arthur.

1341
01:43:22,496 --> 01:43:24,496
- Thanks.
- Why?

1342
01:43:25,232 --> 01:43:27,878
So long, Mike. See you soon.

1343
01:43:27,978 --> 01:43:30,443
- Maybe next year.
- Yes.

1344
01:43:30,543 --> 01:43:33,979
Michael said you were...

1345
01:43:34,079 --> 01:43:36,201
Yes, but I knew it.

1346
01:43:38,779 --> 01:43:40,993
I guess everyone knows it.

1347
01:43:41,093 --> 01:43:42,158
What do you know?

1348
01:43:42,258 --> 01:43:44,724
I knew this was too good to last.

1349
01:43:44,824 --> 01:43:46,963
See you, Angela. I meet with John.

1350
01:43:47,063 --> 01:43:48,835
Michael, take care of your mother.

1351
01:43:48,935 --> 01:43:50,533
How is John? Where is it?

1352
01:43:50,633 --> 01:43:52,098
Remains concealed.

1353
01:43:52,198 --> 01:43:54,198
Goodbye.

1354
01:43:59,533 --> 01:44:01,383
Are you crying, Mom?

1355
01:44:01,483 --> 01:44:05,393
No, honey, I got the wind
an object in the eye.

1356
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:11,011
- How are the sisters?
- His parents were good tonight.

1357
01:44:11,111 --> 01:44:13,052
I think Georgina is in love me.

1358
01:44:13,152 --> 01:44:14,723
Do you?

1359
01:44:14,823 --> 01:44:16,926
I do not know. I love her, clear, but...

1360
01:44:17,026 --> 01:44:18,663
I do not know if I'm in love with her.

1361
01:44:18,763 --> 01:44:20,763
We write.

1362
01:44:20,846 --> 01:44:23,433
- Good.
- And we'll see how it goes.

1363
01:44:23,533 --> 01:44:27,953
- No commitment, huh?
- It's better that way, huh, Mom?

1364
01:44:28,495 --> 01:44:30,495
Much better, dear.

1365
01:44:47,514 --> 01:44:49,557
Listen to Benny Goodman.

1366
01:44:49,657 --> 01:44:51,432
It's a beautiful Saturday morning...

1367
01:44:51,532 --> 01:44:55,017
- Well, six, beware the change.
- Thank you.

1368
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:50,842
Look who came.

1369
01:46:22,976 --> 01:46:24,587
Angela, do you remember Leonida?

1370
01:46:24,687 --> 01:46:26,687
Yeah, how are you?

1371
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:28,529
Well, thank you.
It's good to see you again.

1372
01:46:28,629 --> 01:46:29,759
Alike.

1373
01:46:29,859 --> 01:46:31,769
This is the partner of Leonida, Angela,
Mr. Russo.

1374
01:46:31,869 --> 01:46:33,869
How are you, Mr. Russo?

1375
01:46:33,959 --> 01:46:36,600
How are you, Mrs. Niota?

1376
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:38,574
I talk to Leonida a moment.

1377
01:46:38,674 --> 01:46:40,714
Do we apologize, please?

1378
01:46:45,966 --> 01:46:47,908
I hope that the case to work, John.

1379
01:46:48,008 --> 01:46:51,493
Thanks, Mike. Are you a good double agent.

1380
01:46:53,173 --> 01:46:55,553
Well, I'll watch the action.

1381
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:04,416
Expect much to come.

1382
01:47:05,218 --> 01:47:07,218
I expected much not to.

1383
01:47:07,312 --> 01:47:09,312
Yes, me too.

1384
01:47:11,358 --> 01:47:14,141
We had a promise fired on, Mr. Russo.

1385
01:47:14,241 --> 01:47:16,252
Yes, yes, we had it.

1386
01:47:17,964 --> 01:47:20,432
All right. Now we're even.

1387
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:24,269
I broke the biggest.

1388
01:47:29,009 --> 01:47:31,477
So do I.

1389
01:47:38,151 --> 01:47:41,296
You broke all his promises, Mr. Russo.

1390
01:47:48,161 --> 01:47:49,976
Leave without us.

1391
01:47:50,076 --> 01:47:52,012
Goodbye. I'm looking
forward to seeing you again.

1392
01:47:52,112 --> 01:47:52,346
Me too.

1393
01:47:52,446 --> 01:47:55,408
- Bye, Angela. Good flight.
- Bye, Leon, thank you.

1394
01:47:55,508 --> 01:47:57,766
- Good.
- Goodbye, Mr. Russo.

1395
01:47:59,372 --> 01:48:01,372
John.

1396
01:48:04,144 --> 01:48:05,994
- Michael?
- Yes.

1397
01:48:06,094 --> 01:48:08,088
- Come quickly, we must go.
- Coming.

1398
01:48:08,188 --> 01:48:10,483
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye.

1399
01:49:20,654 --> 01:49:23,300
No need you tomorrow, John, if you feel...

1400
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:25,400
What do I walk? Yes.

1401
01:49:26,893 --> 01:49:28,893
Goodbye, friend.

1402
01:49:49,482 --> 01:49:52,967
Hello, boss. Are you going to where I am?

1403
01:49:57,557 --> 01:50:00,032
What did you have in mind?

1404
01:50:00,132 --> 01:50:02,682
Go to Brooklyn cause problems.

1405
01:50:03,396 --> 01:50:05,990
Sounds good.

1406
01:50:12,572 --> 01:50:14,649
What are you doing here anyway?

1407
01:50:14,749 --> 01:50:16,750
Women.

1408
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:20,250
I thought you might need look after you.

1409
01:50:28,922 --> 01:50:31,254
Have chips, eh, Johnny?

1410
01:50:32,859 --> 01:50:34,859
A few, Sam.

1411
01:50:36,129 --> 01:50:37,979
Well cheer up, boss.

1412
01:50:38,079 --> 01:50:40,204
We're going to get drunk.
