You didn't want her
to go to Georgetown,

1089
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:08,035
so you concocted some ridiculous plan.

1090
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,044
I'm just trying to keep everybody safe.

1091
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,137
(SCOFFS) James.

1092
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:15,911
You took my home and you turned it
into a high-security prison.

1093
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,078
You can't even let her spend the night
with some friends

1094
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,121
without creeping around
like a cat burglar.

1095
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,918
What do you expect me to do?

1096
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:26,052
How am I supposed to know she's safe
if she goes all the way to Washington?

1097
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:30,096
James, how do you think I felt
when you left to join the army?

1098
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:33,430
- I don't know, Mama.
- I was terrified!

1099
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:37,734
I worried about you all the time.
I still do.

1100
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,607
But you had to follow your own path,
and I had to let you leave the nest.

1101
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:46,671
I wanted you home
every day you were gone,

1102
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,512
but I had to trust you.

1103
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:52,349
I had to trust
that you could take care of yourself.

1104
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:56,858
And I had to believe in you.
So why can't you believe in her?

1105
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,455
- L'll see you back at home.
- Is Mom gonna kill me?

1106
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:30,390
I got your back on this one.
Just don't let it happen again.

1107
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:32,324
- Good luck.
- You'll need this.

1108
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,760
- Mama, I love you.
- I love you, too, Son.

1109
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:36,161
TRE Y: Bye, Dad.

1110
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,264
Excuse me.
The flight to DC, has it left yet?

1111
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:47,275
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm afraid you've missed it.

1112
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,121
Mel.

1113
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,185
Hi.

1114
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,261
You missed the flight.

1115
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:09,854
I wouldn't have if you hadn't
gotten yourself arrested.

1116
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:13,094
- Mel, look. I was...
- Dad, listen.

1117
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:16,330
Georgetown is... It's over.

1118
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,100
You know, you're getting
exactly what you wanted.

1119
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,539
Me, closer to home.

1120
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:22,907
Baby, that's what I came here
to tell you.

1121
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,411
I don't want that anymore.

1122
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,880
- What are you talking about?
- You know...

1123
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,642
Dads don't know everything.

1124
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:33,483
We just try to do the best we can.

1125
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:35,750
Last night, when I came
to the sorority house?

1126
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,883
I was trying to protect you.

1127
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:41,589
That's what I do. I protect people.

1128
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,928
Now, sometimes I go too far.

1129
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,093
- In this case, I went way too far.
- Dad...

1130
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,364
No, baby, look. I love you.

1131
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:54,535
But I was so into what I wanted for you
that I couldn't see what you wanted.

1132
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:56,839
I want what every girl wants.

1133
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,449
I want a dad who loves me,
who adores me.

1134
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,578
I want you to know
that you raised a really good girl.

1135
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,588
I want you to trust me.

1136
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:17,525
Guess I still see you as that
little six-year-old girl

1137

singing <i>Double Dutch Bus.</i>

I'm not that little girl anymore, Daddy.

1139

I've grown up.

1140
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:30,740
Reality is,
you've shown me I can trust you.

1141
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:33,512
You have.

1142
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:37,783
Okay, l'll make a deal with you.

1143
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:43,123
No more my plan, only your plan.

1144
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:45,626
Now let's get you to Georgetown.

1145
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:46,956

we got to be in DC by 3:30.

- Is the plane going to Washington?
- Yeah, but it's for team members only.

1151
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:13,145
We got a police emergency.
You have to let us on that plane.

1152
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,487
- Are you guys divers?
- Yeah.

Dad, what are you afraid of?

1266
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,445
I was afraid that if I let you go,

1267
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:47,175
that you'd never
need your daddy again.

1268
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,548
But I'm always gonna need you.

1269

Mel, this is what you gotta do.
Go in there with all confidence.

Keep your head up. And do your best.

Yeah, I like that.

1273
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:12,270
And if they don't accept you after that,
it's their loss.
