1
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,673
Ha!

2
00:01:28,624 --> 00:01:29,956
What is this?

3
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:38,700
Uh!

4
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:42,147
Good hands, Nedderman.
Take a lap.

5
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:48,558
By itself, a basketball
is just a round sack of air.

6
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:50,666
Like many of you.

7
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:52,967
But in the hands of
someone properly trained...

8
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:54,532
in its use and skilled in its art...

9
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:57,173
this ball can do great things.

10
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,515
Oates, I can hear you
wheezing from here.

11
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,750
Take a lap. Lose the asthma.

12
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,121
To survive
outside these walls...

13
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:07,464
you need more than
just math and science.

14
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,800
The world does not stop...

15
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,329
for people who can spell
fancy words...

16
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:12,037
or tell you
the capital of Montana.

17
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:14,048
The capital of Montana, Watson?

18
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:16,143
- Helena?
- Who cares? Take a lap.

19
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,326
The only thing that matters
in this world, ladies, is strength.

20
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:23,891
Strength of body
and strength of mind.

21
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,198
Now if you're not
strong enough...

22
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:26,762
by the time you leave
these doors...

23
00:02:26,807 --> 00:02:29,301
you may as well give up
and go home to your mommas.

24
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:32,885
Or grandma.
Put your hand down, Lewis.

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,586
We all know your parents died.
Give it a rest.

26
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,902
- Oh!
- Pick up the pace, Nedderman.

27
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:48,314
Well, Farley, it looks like you
forgot your gym clothes again.

28
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,876
No, sir, somebody...

29
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,479
It's a rhetorical question,
Farley.

30
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:53,015
- What?
- It's a rhetorical question.

31
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,053
That means you don't have
to answer it.

32
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:56,862
Because either
I already know the answer...

33
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:59,201
or I don't care
what your answer is.

34
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:00,868
You see, in my class, Farley...

35
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:04,370
everyone is required to wear
regulation gym shorts and shirt.

36
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,354
Gutierrez, go get the rentals.

37
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,551
Start changing.

38
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:11,893
- No, in line.
- What?

39
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:13,696
See, the locker room
is reserved...

40
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,638
for people who brought
the appropriate attire.

41
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:18,906
- You change here.
- It's OK, John. Be strong.

42
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:21,472
No talking, Nedderman. 10 laps.

43
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:23,680
Take Wheezy with you.

44
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,991
Come on, let's go.

45
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:39,345
The rentals, Farley,
that's 25 cents.

46
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,050
- But somebody stole my...
- l... I didn't ask you a question, Farley.

47
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,061
- Not even a rhetorical one.
- Uh...

48
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:46,794
It seems to me
that someone needs a lesson...

49
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,667
in personal responsibility.

50
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:52,711
Not even one chin-up,
Farley?

51
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:53,975
Can't hang on!

52
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:55,780
You are a disgrace to fat...

53
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,314
gelatinous, out-of-shape
little kids the world over.

54
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:02,388
I don't tolerate losers
in my gymnasium.

55
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:05,301
- Are you gonna be a loser?
- No, sir.

56
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:08,936
Rhetorical, Farley.
I already know the answer.

57
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:10,777
Heads up, Nedderman.

58
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:12,913
Uh!

59
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:18,154
Don't you even think
about letting go.

60
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:19,928
Uh!

61
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:30,244
- You guys ready to let go?
- Yeah!

62
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:31,255
All right!

63
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:32,622
- Mr. Farley?
- Oh, sure. How you doing?

64
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,184
- All right, what's your name?
- Scott.

65
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:35,391
John, you don't have
time for this.

66
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:36,866
- Oh...
- Bye-bye.

67
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,960
I'm sorry, guys.

68
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:38,993
- Keep letting go.
- John! John!

69
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:45,016
OK, now remember they're
all potential stalkers.

70
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,679
Most want an autograph
and a handshake...

71
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,884
but some of them want an
autograph and a handshake...

72
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:50,656
and then they want to
take you home, tie you up...

73
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:52,460
and saw your feet off.

74
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:54,901
- Well, hi there.
- John Farley.

75
00:04:54,937 --> 00:04:56,770
Your book saved my life.

76
00:04:56,807 --> 00:04:59,073
I didn't do anything.
You did it.

77
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:01,345
All I did was
give you the raft.

78
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,114
- You had to inflate it yourself.
- Mm-hm.

79
00:05:03,153 --> 00:05:07,390
Mr. Farley, I used to feel
ostracized because of my weight.

80
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:10,697
But with your help I'm starting
to get my self-confidence back.

81
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:12,135
Ha! That's a great story.

82
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:14,199
Why don't you check out
the free coffee and donuts?

83
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:15,768
Oh!

84
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:21,154
By letting go, do you mean we
should just forget everything?

85
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,353
My mom said he wouldn't drink
so much...

86
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:26,298
if he could just forget about that summer
in Uncle Lou's house.

87
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,236
Well, we all have
an Uncle Lou.

88
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:30,571
And we all drink
for different reasons.

89
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:33,446
Long day.

90
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:35,713
I don't even think I can hold
a pen anymore.

91
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,053
Let me give you the same advice
I gave Nelson Mandela...

92
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:39,992
on his last book tour.

93
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:41,860
Quit whining, you pussy.

94
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:44,368
- That's helpful.
- You have no idea...

95
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:46,100
the stuff that
I am saving you from.

96
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,906
Some shithole in Nebraska
wanted to give you...

97
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:52,578
their corn husk bucket
or something.

98
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,816
The Corn Cob Key?

99
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:57,590
Uh, is that what it is?
L... I don't know. "The Forest...

100
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,622
"...Meadow Nebraska
Chamber of Commerce...

101
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:04,165
"wishes to award Mr. John Farley
the Corn Cob Key to the City."

102
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:06,179
Oh, my God. This is my hometown.

103
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:08,479
- This is awesome. What did you tell them?
- I told them yes.

104
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:09,919
- Really?
- No.

105
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,047
Why? Wait.

106
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,153
Maggie, the Corn Cob Key
is a huge honor.

107
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:15,789
They hardly ever
give it out anymore...

108
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:17,928
but when they do it's the
highlight of the whole cornival.

109
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:21,002
I'm sorry.
Did you just say cornival?

110
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:23,809
Well, yeah. It's a farm town...

111
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:27,288
so, you know, every year
we have this big celebration.

112
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,120
Corn carnival. Cornival.

113
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:32,563
- Cornival.
- Maggie, you don't understand.

114
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,762
My mom was Corn Cob Queen
in 1970.

115
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:36,796
I mean, she still rides
in the parade every year.

116
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:39,278
- This will mean so much to her.
- Cornival?

117
00:06:39,313 --> 00:06:41,044
You know what?
Call them back.

118
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,315
I could fly in tomorrow
and surprise her. It's perfect.

119
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:47,089
You would need a court order
to make me go see my mom.

120
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:50,967
This is different. Since my dad
died, I'm all she's got.

121
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:52,905
Oh, your dad's dead?

122
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,069
Lt's a major theme of my book.

123
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:58,481
The whole last chapter's
about how I let go of that pain.

124
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:02,919
You haven't read my book,
have you?

125
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,796
Well, there's no point now.
You just ruined the ending.

126
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,592
Hi, John!

127
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:32,711
Welcome home, John. Ha ha ha!

128
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:35,349
Luke Jessop, uh, Forest Meadow
Town Council.

129
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:38,887
We appreciate you taking time
out of your busy schedule...

130
00:07:38,932 --> 00:07:40,925
to... to... to come home and see
the little people.

131
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,837
Thank you. This is great.

132
00:07:42,873 --> 00:07:45,469
It's an honor to be considered
worthy of the Corn Cob Key.

133
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:47,071
Well, you've earned it, young...

134
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:51,384
Young man.
We are mighty proud of you.

135
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:53,986
So on behalf of... of...

136
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:57,525
Well, of all of us, John...

137
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,699
- Corn-gratulations!
- Ha ha ha!

138
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:21,273
...Famous award-winning corn chowder...

139
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:35,143
- Johnny! Oh, my God, you're here!
- Hey!

140
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:36,613
- How are you?
- Oh!

141
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:39,118
I heard your news and I tried to
call you but now you're here!

142
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,019
I was flying in.
I wanted to surprise you.

143
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:42,787
- Oh! I am so proud of you.
- Thank you, Mom.

144
00:08:42,827 --> 00:08:44,421
How's it going?
Ls the book tour good?

145
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:46,160
- Yeah, it's good.
- Are you having fun?

146
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,533
Yeah, I'm happy. You look great.

147
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,198
- Thanks.
- Yeah. You going somewhere?

148
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,038
Yeah. I have a date.

149
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:52,511
- Really?
- Yeah.

150
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:54,139
- A... Are you seeing someone?
- Yeah.

151
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:56,619
Oh, my God. That's fantastic.
For how long?

152
00:08:56,654 --> 00:08:58,920
- 5 months.
- What? Why didn't you mention it?

153
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,826
Oh, because you don't like
to hear when I have a date.

154
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:03,266
- Oh, well, so what's he like?
- Oh, he's great.

155
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:07,138
He's so handsome and he's...
he's sweet and consid...

156
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:09,908
- He's a gentleman.
- Oh, Mom, I'm so happy for you.

157
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:11,382
- Thanks.
- I can't wait to meet him.

158
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,684
- You know, you know him already.
- I do?

159
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:14,712
Yeah.

160
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:31,321
Mr. Woodcock?

161
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:38,499
Farley, I brought you
some daisies.

162
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:41,900
- Jasper!
- Sorry, I'm late, honey.

163
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,782
That's OK.

164
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,118
Uh, this is Johnny.

165
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:49,956
My son.
Do you remember him now?

166
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:51,623
No.

167
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,426
- But I've heard a lot.
- Hm.

168
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,906
It's not every day you get to
shake hands with a celebrity.

169
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:58,137
Ha ha ha!

170
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,677
- Uh, you ready for dinner?
- Mm-hm.

171
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:02,516
I don't know
about you...

172
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:03,074
I don't know
about you...

173
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:05,178
but I've been thinking
about meat all day long.

174
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:11,722
I can't believe
you don't remember him.

175
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:13,202
He was the cutest kid.

176
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,264
About this high
with his chubby little cheeks.

177
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:18,439
- Mom.
- I had a lot of fat kids over the years.

178
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:20,542
Oh, he wasn't fat!

179
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:22,555
Wait a minute.

180
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,582
It's coming back to me.

181
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:26,825
You're not that kid
that got the squirts...

182
00:10:26,865 --> 00:10:28,265
on the balance beam
that time, were you?

183
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:30,601
- Jasper.
- No.

184
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:34,510
Actually I remember you
pretty well.

185
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,709
You kinda gave me a lot of
personal attention back then.

186
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:39,815
- Aw.
- Well, I take a healthy interest in the kids.

187
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:41,690
Serves them well
later in life.

188
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:45,167
Oh, that's so true, that's
so true. And that is why...

189
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:49,232
they're making Jasper
the Educator of the Year.

190
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:51,770
- You're kidding!
- Why would she be kidding?

191
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:55,219
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
You know what I just realized?

192
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:59,754
Both of my fellas are being
honored in the same week.

193
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:04,364
They're giving Johnny
the Corn Cob Key.

194
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:06,877
You're kidding.

195
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:10,750
So I'm doing laps at the Y
and he's in the next lane...

196
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:14,658
and all of a sudden my leg
seizes up and I go under.

197
00:11:14,694 --> 00:11:18,292
It was a bad cramp.
And if I remember correctly...

198
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:20,327
I think it was about...

199
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:22,672
- Right here.
- Ha ha ha.

200
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:27,014
Ahem. So he saved
your life, then?

201
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:29,249
Well, it was
the shallow end.

202
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,191
You can drown
in six inches of water.

203
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:32,719
- That is so true.
- Hm.

204
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:35,291
Well, if you will
excuse me...

205
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:38,000
I am going to, uh,
the ladies room.

206
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,237
You boys behave yourself.

207
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:46,113
So what's your book about?

208
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:49,557
Oh. Um...

209
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:52,159
well, it teaches people how to
release painful memories...

210
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:54,399
so they can rebuild
their self-esteem.

211
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,306
It's called Letting Go.
How To Get Past Your Past.

212
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:58,678
I'm already past my past.

213
00:11:58,715 --> 00:12:01,311
That's why
it's called my past.

214
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,483
Well, some people
find my book helpful.

215
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,893
Lot of losers out there,
I guess.

216
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,874
Well, would you like
an espresso, er, cappuccino...?

217
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,937
- Um, a cup...
- Just the check.

218
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:17,350
Oh, OK.

219
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:19,990
Thanks, guys.

220
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:21,755
Um, my treat.

221
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:23,662
You're the guest.
L'll take care of it.

222
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,692
No, really, it's fine.

223
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:27,399
I can afford it.

224
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,170
So you're saying I can't?

225
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:32,070
No, of course not.

226
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:36,284
Well, then, why don't you take
your own advice and, uh, let go?

227
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,794
Thank you, Jasper.
That is so sweet.

228
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,472
Johnny, don't you have
something to say?

229
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,175
Thank you.

230
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:52,017
Don't mention it.

231
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:56,060
- Ha ha ha.
- I swear to God it's true.

232
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:59,558
No, no, no. No. No.
Thank you, honey.

233
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:03,305
No, I don't believe you.
You did not beat Santa Claus up.

234
00:13:03,345 --> 00:13:05,872
- Stop it.
- I was 7 years old at the time.

235
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,183
And some kids at school told me
that there's no Santa Claus.

236
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,211
Uh-huh?

237
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:10,987
Well, on Christmas Eve
when I come downstairs...

238
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:12,928
and see some guy messing around
under the Christmas tree...

239
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,228
I go to my dad's closet...

240
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:15,257
- and get a three wood...
- Oh, no!

241
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:17,066
And next thing you know,
Uncle Bob's in the hospital.

242
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:19,338
No! Oh, poor Uncle Bob.

243
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:21,176
Ate the entire Christmas dinner
through a straw that year.

244
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:22,204
- No!
- Yeah.

245
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,720
What a great story.

246
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:26,781
Well, I guess we'd better
call it a night.

247
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:29,228
It's good to see you,
Mr. Woodcock.

248
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:32,667
Well, I guess I could let you
have her for one night, Farley.

249
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:34,172
Probably good for
the old hip flexor...

250
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:35,368
to take a night off anyway, huh?

251
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:38,074
- Jasper!
- Ha ha ha! Yeah.

252
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:42,180
That was a fun night.
Come on, you guys!

253
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:45,855
You guys! Ooooohhhhhh! Mmmm!

254
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,434
- L'll call you tomorrow, honey.
- OK.

255
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:53,876
- Farley.
- Yep.

256
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:55,541
Mr. Woodcock.

257
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:04,194
And he is just so easy to be with.

258
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:08,833
Last month...
we went camping.

259
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:10,903
- You hate camping.
- I know!

260
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:13,281
I mean, it was just the 2 of us for 3 days...

261
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:14,809
and it was heaven.

262
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,325
Ha ha ha. It was great.

263
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,759
Wow.

264
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,630
Johnny, um...

265
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:26,299
this is really the first guy
since your father...

266
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:29,714
that... has felt right.

267
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:33,218
L'll get you some milk.

268
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,763
Oh! Look what I've got.

269
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:42,874
Chocolate, please.

270
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:47,646
I had a lot of fat kids over the years.

271
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,919
- This is Johnny.
- A lot of fat kids.

272
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,085
Remember him now?

273
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:53,154
No. A lot of losers out there, I guess.

274
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:55,100
Arrgh!

275
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:00,670
Probably good
for the old hip flexor...

276
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:02,979
to take a night off anyway, huh?
Ha ha ha!

277
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:28,601
When did you get here?

278
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:32,876
About 10 minutes after you said
good night to me.

279
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,820
Not even one chin-up, Farley?

280
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,122
You are a disgrace to fat...

281
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,531
gelatinous, out-of-shape
little kids the world over.

282
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,269
- Can I get a glass of water, please?
- Sure.

283
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,954
Son of a bitch!

284
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:04,232
- I'm sorry.
- John Farley?

285
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,377
- Nedderman?
- I can't believe it's really you!

286
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,579
I've read your book like 900 times...

287
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,747
and I'm not just saying this...

288
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:13,782
it's totally changed my life!

289
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:15,489
Really? That's great, man.

290
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,000
Hell, yeah.
I work here full-time...

291
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:20,665
and also I'm starting
my own pool cleaning business.

292
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:24,043
All I've got so far is a van but... but
at least it's a start, right?

293
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,913
Well, every journey
has to start somewhere.

294
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,013
Chapter 2.
You're totally right.

295
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:31,026
Totally right.

296
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:38,236
Can you believe it?
The Woodcock pan pizza?

297
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:40,336
What's next,
the Hitler calzone?

298
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,144
Yeah, well, you're never
gonna believe this.

299
00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:44,483
Mr. Deepdish
is dating my mom.

300
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:47,391
Woodcock?
He's doing your mom?

301
00:16:47,427 --> 00:16:49,397
- Wait. I wouldn't say doing...
- Hear that, Mitch?

302
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:51,127
Woodcock's slamming
his mom!

303
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:52,568
- You don't have to announce it.
- Hey, guys!

304
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:55,576
Check it out. Woodcock's
stuffing this dude's mom.

305
00:16:56,445 --> 00:16:57,970
Woodcock's pounding your mom?

306
00:16:58,014 --> 00:17:00,109
Hey, hey, guys, come on.
Show a little respect.

307
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,783
How would you feel if Woodcock
was porking your mom?

308
00:17:02,824 --> 00:17:05,796
Woodcock's porking your mom!

309
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,732
- Woodcock's porking your mom!
- Hey, shut your trap...

310
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,498
or you're not getting
that cheesy bread!

311
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:11,804
I want my cheesy bread!

312
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:13,243
Then shut up!

313
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,011
Keep your mouth shut and you get
your cheesy bread, all right?

314
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:21,394
I'm sorry about that.
You want a slice on the house?

315
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:23,261
Sausage and onion.
Extra sauce, right?

316
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:25,098
No, I don't really eat
that stuff anymore.

317
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:27,766
Yeah, yeah, l... l... I'd probably
lose my appetite too...

318
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,868
if Woodcock was giving it
to my mom.

319
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:32,280
The guy is pure evil.

320
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,719
You know he killed Oates?

321
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,155
- What?
- Yeah.

322
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:38,787
Remember, Woodcock used to
make Oates do, like, 6 miles...

323
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:40,628
every day after school?

324
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,570
The guy had bad asthma, dude,
you can't just run through that.

325
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:46,305
Holy shit.
Well, when did he die?

326
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:49,408
A couple of years ago.
But it was all Woodcock.

327
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,354
Ah...

328
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,157
Man, look, we can't blame
Woodcock for Oates's choices.

329
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:57,632
Oates coulda stopped
running, right?

330
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,136
When you make
a blame sandwich...

331
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,265
you gotta be prepared
to eat it yourself.

332
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:04,041
Chapter 10.
You're totally right.

333
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,314
So what are you gonna do?

334
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,689
I think it's time
Woodcock and I had a talk.

335
00:18:10,726 --> 00:18:13,095
The shortest distance
between 2 people...

336
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:15,102
Communication.

337
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,233
God, you must get so laid.

338
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:24,651
Farley, pass the ball.

339
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,521
Not even one pull-up, Farley?

340
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:28,289
Are you gonna be a loser, Farley?

341
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:30,526
I don't tolerate losers
in my gymnasium.

342
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:33,733
Now, before we begin our
exploration of wiffleball...

343
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:36,539
I think a little equipment check
is in order.

344
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:39,278
Well, Dunningham?

345
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,380
Spread 'em, Dunningham.

346
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,131
That's OK. I don't need to
see the cup, Dunningham.

347
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,333
Keep it in your pants.

348
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:58,783
You see, ladies, it's important
that you come prepared to class.

349
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:00,587
Because when we're prepared...

350
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:03,827
then we're ready to face
life's challenges.

351
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:08,605
Well, Farley, let's see whether
or not you came prepared today.

352
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:11,270
Spread 'em.

353
00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:18,695
Excuse me. Do you have
a visitors' pass?

354
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:21,499
Tracy Dettweiler?

355
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:25,999
- John Farley?
- Wh... You remember me?

356
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:28,071
Well, yeah, you're famous!

357
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,849
What are you doing here?

358
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:33,723
Oh, gee... what are you doing here?

359
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,957
Oh, l... I teach English.

360
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:37,489
- Wow.
- Ha ha ha!

361
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:39,435
I really wish I had you
as an English teacher.

362
00:19:39,472 --> 00:19:41,304
I would have paid
way more attention in class.

363
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:44,473
Ha ha ha! Wait a minute.
What year were you in again?

364
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:46,849
Uh, same as you, actually.

365
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,617
- Really?
- Yeah. I was...

366
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:50,853
I was actually
your 7th grade lab partner.

367
00:19:52,196 --> 00:19:54,223
Wait. Fat John?

368
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:56,738
- No way! Fat John!
- Yeah.

369
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:59,243
Yep, I was fat.

370
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:00,644
Ha ha ha!

371
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,877
Wow, you've changed a lot.

372
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:03,750
Yeah. Thank you.

373
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,481
Yeah. Thank you.

374
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,752
You're welcome. A... And they're
giving you the Corn Cob Key.

375
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,057
- I mean, that's amazing.
- Nah, it's nothing.

376
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:13,158
Don't be modest.
L... l... I love your book.

377
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:15,968
I mean, you totally deserve
the award.

378
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,806
- Wh... Really?
- Yeah.

379
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:19,837
- Wow, thank you.
- Mm.

380
00:20:19,882 --> 00:20:23,583
Say, listen, what are you doing
tonight? Do you want to, uh... um...

381
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,593
uh, a drink or go out for dinner
or something?

382
00:20:25,627 --> 00:20:28,428
I'd... love to but l... I can't.

383
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:30,368
I've got cheerleading practice.

384
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:32,430
- That's awesome.
- No!

385
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:33,874
I'm the coach now.

386
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,504
- Oh, oh.
- Yeah.

387
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:37,983
Um, h... here's my number.

388
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:42,486
Call me.

389
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:44,827
- I will.
- OK. Bye.

390
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:46,494
Bye.

391
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:52,345
God, I'm so glad
I wrote that book!

392
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,193
According to my syllabus...

393
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,325
we should be
well into wrestling by now.

394
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:04,428
But because of
your lack of focus...

395
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,411
we've yet to get past
the fundamentals of kickball.

396
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:10,382
Kreamer, first rule of Bunting.

397
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,444
Um, do... don't...

398
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:14,753
There is no Bunting
in kickball, Kreamer.

399
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:17,263
Set of ten.

400
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:20,599
Henderson, is there a reason
why your shoe is untied?

401
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:22,903
- Um...
- You see on the kickball field...

402
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:24,911
a screw-up like that
can put you in a wheelchair.

403
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:26,505
You'll end up
writing your name...

404
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:27,915
with a pencil taped
to your head...

405
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:29,921
the rest of your life.
Set of ten.

406
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,998
Until you learn
the basics of any sport...

407
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,934
you cannot participate in it...

408
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,167
let alone excel in it.

409
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,303
What are you doing in my class?

410
00:21:41,345 --> 00:21:42,904
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

411
00:21:42,949 --> 00:21:44,850
Well, you did. Set of ten.

412
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:47,322
- What?
- It was a joke.

413
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:49,988
- What do you want?
- Maybe I should just come back.

414
00:21:54,338 --> 00:21:55,898
Maybe you should spit it out now...

415
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,466
so I don't have to
explain to their parents...

416
00:21:57,511 --> 00:21:59,743
why they didn't graduate on time.

417
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:01,683
Well, I've just been feeling...

418
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:04,350
like there's been
some tension between us.

419
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,862
Like at dinner,
with the check, and uh...

420
00:22:06,897 --> 00:22:08,661
I guess I just
wanted to say...

421
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:11,671
that some of that
might have been my fault.

422
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:15,344
I'm sorry,
he seems to be in pain.

423
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,575
- Who?
- Him!

424
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:19,850
He's fine. Kreamer,
off your knees.

425
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:21,016
Well, he doesn't look fine.

426
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:22,549
Listen, I have
a class to teach...

427
00:22:22,594 --> 00:22:25,157
so why don't you get to
your point, if you've got one?

428
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,265
I guess I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

429
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:38,317
And I'm sure for your part
you're a little sorry too.

430
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:41,263
- I don't do sorry.
- What?

431
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:44,293
Sorry is for criminals and
screw-ups and I'm neither one.

432
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:46,171
Get up, Henderson.

433
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,303
Not you, Kreamer.

434
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:50,441
Now, if you don't mind...

435
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:52,784
these children
are in need of an education.

436
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:56,023
Schwartz, you better
fight your way...

437
00:22:56,061 --> 00:22:57,529
past that stutter of yours...

438
00:22:57,564 --> 00:23:00,297
and tell me about the pop fly
rule as it pertains to kickball.

439
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:04,506
W... Well, it... it...

440
00:23:04,544 --> 00:23:05,808
It...

441
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:09,780
- When...
- S... s... s... s... s... s... s... set of ten.

442
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:14,490
Fine. My mom wants to date that
asshole, she can go right ahead.

443
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:17,766
Chapter 12. Never interfere
in other people's lives.

444
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:20,971
I don't think
Mr. Woodcock's right for you.

445
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:23,311
- Really?
- Yeah.

446
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:25,410
He's, um...

447
00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:29,927
well, the truth is, he's not
a very nice person, Mom.

448
00:23:29,962 --> 00:23:31,556
- He isn't?
- Do you remember when I used to...

449
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,626
come home crying
every day after school?

450
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,161
You were so sensitive.

451
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,039
That's why you're
so good at what you do.

452
00:23:37,077 --> 00:23:38,706
It's not about being sensitive, Mom.

453
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:40,306
He made all of us miserable.

454
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,151
Sweetheart, you just
hated anything athletic.

455
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:45,125
You can't blame Jasper for that.

456
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:46,958
You don't know him like I do.

457
00:23:46,996 --> 00:23:49,559
And you don't know him like I do.

458
00:23:50,738 --> 00:23:54,142
- He touched me.
- What?

459
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:56,706
OK, that's not true.

460
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,686
But he's mean, and he's cruel.

461
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,747
Mom, I'm telling you,
he's still...

462
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,522
He's still what?

463
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:04,895
He's still teaching gym.

464
00:24:04,932 --> 00:24:07,768
- Oh! What'd you bring me?
- Dinner.

465
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:11,301
Sorry I'm late. Had a long day.
Got a little behind.

466
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:15,980
Wow. Jasper grills
the best beef in Nebraska.

467
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,458
Well, I am known for my meat.

468
00:24:18,493 --> 00:24:20,258
You only got 2 though,
sweetie.

469
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:23,929
I'm sorry. I guess it
must have slipped my mind.

470
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:28,402
John, you don't mind
running to the store, do you?

471
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:30,075
No.

472
00:24:31,051 --> 00:24:32,850
Take your time.

473
00:24:37,531 --> 00:24:40,001
"I'm known for my meat!"

474
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:42,337
"I'm known for my meat."

475
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:45,175
Actually, you're not known
for your meat, Woodcock.

476
00:24:45,214 --> 00:24:46,910
You're known for emotionally crippling...

477
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,886
an entire generation of children.

478
00:24:52,394 --> 00:24:53,623
Dickhead!

479
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:08,084
Mom.

480
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:09,526
Sweetheart.

481
00:25:09,562 --> 00:25:11,395
What's wrong?

482
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:14,404
Jasper and I are no longer dating.

483
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:16,932
Oh.

484
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:19,846
That's so sad.

485
00:25:19,882 --> 00:25:22,115
What happened?

486
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:25,354
We're engaged.

487
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:27,486
Oh.

488
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:34,306
Have we heard
a congratulations yet?

489
00:25:34,345 --> 00:25:37,784
Oh, I think he's in shock.

490
00:25:37,818 --> 00:25:39,720
That's so good.

491
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:41,190
Oh, l'll get it.

492
00:25:41,225 --> 00:25:43,422
I wanna start spreading the news.

493
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:47,594
Mm.

494
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:50,136
Ha ha ha.

495
00:25:51,646 --> 00:25:53,275
Hello?

496
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:58,153
Well, it looks like
I'm gonna be your new dad.

497
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,197
Come on, Johnny.
Stay, help us celebrate.

498
00:26:03,236 --> 00:26:05,103
Sorry, Mom.
Book tour emergency.

499
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,803
I have to get to the airport.

500
00:26:06,844 --> 00:26:09,371
- You haven't eaten.
- L... l'll grab something on the way.

501
00:26:09,415 --> 00:26:10,907
I love you, Mom.
It's great to see you.

502
00:26:10,952 --> 00:26:12,443
I love you too.

503
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,151
Farley.

504
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:19,524
Be safe.

505
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:31,159
Eenie, meanie, miney...

506
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:31,591
Eenie, meanie, miney...

507
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:33,460
Farley.

508
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:38,807
There's no truer test
of the human spirit...

509
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:40,332
than wrestling.

510
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,350
That's called a takedown.

511
00:26:47,391 --> 00:26:48,917
Get up, Farley.

512
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:50,828
There are many kinds
of takedowns.

513
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:53,735
Today, we're going to
cover some of my favorites.

514
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:56,367
This is called the head and arm.

515
00:26:57,612 --> 00:26:59,582
This is called
the single leg sweep.

516
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:01,278
You step and you sweep!

517
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,155
This is called
the fireman's throw.

518
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:07,425
Shoot the crotch,
collapse the hip and sling shot.

519
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,630
OK, Farley, you're up.

520
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,301
What?

521
00:27:13,343 --> 00:27:15,678
Put me on the mat.

522
00:27:15,715 --> 00:27:17,377
Come on. You were paying
attention, weren't you?

523
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:19,046
Let's go.

524
00:27:21,593 --> 00:27:23,118
OK, take me down.

525
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,709
You see there is no reason why
even a little porker like this...

526
00:27:29,743 --> 00:27:31,371
shouldn't be able to take me
straight to the mat.

527
00:27:31,412 --> 00:27:33,781
I once saw a 4-foot Laotian...

528
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,879
twist a 250lb Swede so hard...

529
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:37,516
that he mopped
the bleachers with his blood.

530
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,357
The only reason I'm still standing...

531
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:41,866
is because you don't believe
in yourself, Farley!

532
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,665
You don't believe in yourself!

533
00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:46,868
Stop the cab! Stop!

534
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,780
Don't believe in myself, my ass!

535
00:27:49,816 --> 00:27:51,683
I invented believing in yourself.

536
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,986
No way in hell this guy's gonna
run me out of my own house.

537
00:27:54,024 --> 00:27:57,395
Wow. Woodcock's still
plowing your mom, huh?

538
00:27:57,432 --> 00:27:59,368
He's marrying her.

539
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:02,066
Wait, Woodcock's marrying your mom?

540
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:03,667
Ha ha ha. Dudes!

541
00:28:03,711 --> 00:28:06,181
Don't even think about it!

542
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:07,741
Get me a pitcher!

543
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:11,725
What is that, Canadian bacon?

544
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,196
So I guess the talk didn't go very well?

545
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:17,135
God, can you imagine my family
with Woodcock in it?

546
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,074
A tie for Christmas, Farley?
Set of ten!

547
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,274
You didn't eat your vegetables?
Take a lap.

548
00:28:22,315 --> 00:28:25,253
You call that a grandchild?
Rhetorical question, Farley.

549
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:27,417
That sucks.
What are you gonna do?

550
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,394
I'm gonna kill Woodcock.

551
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:30,863
- And you're gonna help me.
- John.

552
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:33,095
I've already got 2 strikes
and I can't be a part of...

553
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:35,334
I'm just venting here. Is that
OK? Ls it OK if a guy vents?

554
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:37,674
Yeah, sure, because I thought
you were serious.

555
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:39,614
Ha! I've got it.
I'm gonna break them up.

556
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:41,448
How are you gonna do that?

557
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,549
You see, I made a mistake before.

558
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:46,687
I let him take me out of my game.

559
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,725
But this time,
I'm gonna get inside his head...

560
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,466
and spin him like a top.

561
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:56,141
That's good. I don't remember
anything like that in your book.

562
00:28:56,183 --> 00:28:58,050
It's not in my book, Nedderman.

563
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:01,992
- Hello.
- Hey, John.

564
00:29:02,027 --> 00:29:04,157
- How's my favorite author?
- Hey, Maggie.

565
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:05,861
Hold on a second.

566
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:08,395
OK, Mommy time's over.

567
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,430
But don't be sad.

568
00:29:09,476 --> 00:29:11,446
Yeah, uh, actually, I gotta
talk to you about that.

569
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,452
I know you have some kind of
corn chowder thing on Sunday...

570
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,980
but look, I have amazing news.
Oprah...

571
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:19,461
is seriously considering
your book for the book club.

572
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:21,762
It's unbelievable. I have you
on a 9:30 flight out...

573
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,736
and then l'll meet you on the
connecting flight in St. Louis.

574
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:25,172
Maggie, I can't.

575
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:27,677
- It's a long story but l... I can't.
- Knock it off!

576
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:30,377
- You can't what?
- I can't make it to Chicago.

577
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:33,015
My mom needs me. She's about
to marry the Antichrist.

578
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:36,257
Look, I don't care
if your granny's on fire.

579
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:37,594
This is Oprah.

580
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:39,067
She farts on a book...

581
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:41,038
and it magically
sells a million copies.

582
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:42,872
Just get your ass on that plane!

583
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,574
- Maggie, please, listen...
- Breaking up this phone call.

584
00:29:45,614 --> 00:29:49,851
Get on... plane tomorrow.

585
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,190
Hey! Where are you going?

586
00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:55,098
W... Wait! Tell me more about your wife!

587
00:29:59,742 --> 00:30:01,268
Mom?

588
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:04,984
See, I made a mistake before.
I let him take me off my game.

589
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:07,716
See, I made a mistake before.
I let him take me off my game.

590
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:10,488
But this time I'm gonna get
inside his head...

591
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:11,894
and spin him like a top.

592
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,529
Spin him like a top.

593
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:16,402
- Spin him like...
- Tickle machine!

594
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,876
No, no, no!
Not a tickle machine. No!

595
00:30:18,912 --> 00:30:21,542
Oh, oh, stop it!

596
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,419
Oh, Jasper, mind...

597
00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:29,091
Who was that?
I think someone's in the house.

598
00:30:29,132 --> 00:30:31,227
- Don't worry, I got it.
- Be careful.

599
00:30:34,242 --> 00:30:36,269
Oh, shit!

600
00:30:37,248 --> 00:30:40,482
No, no! Oh! Ow! Ow!

601
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:42,924
Ow, it's me! Lt's me! Lt's John!

602
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,693
Stop! Ow! Stop! Lt's John, man!

603
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:48,430
- Oh! Johnny!
- What the hell, Woodcock?

604
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,703
Well, it was dark.
Instinct took over.

605
00:30:50,742 --> 00:30:52,472
What about when I said,
"lt's me! Lt's John!"

606
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:55,108
John's a very common name.
There could be a burglar named John.

607
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,279
What burglar shouts out
his own name?

608
00:30:57,321 --> 00:31:00,556
I'm sure it was an accident,
sweetie. L... um...

609
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:02,325
Honey, I thought you were in danger.

610
00:31:02,365 --> 00:31:04,198
Oh.

611
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:06,604
Are you all right?

612
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,438
Yeah, I'm fine.

613
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:10,447
Well, uh, J-John,
what are you doing here?

614
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:11,745
I thought about it...

615
00:31:11,784 --> 00:31:13,309
and I just didn't want
to disappoint you, Mom.

616
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:16,952
Aw, that is so sweet.

617
00:31:16,994 --> 00:31:19,864
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yeah, I'm great.

618
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,336
All right, well, then, um...

619
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:24,899
- we'll see you in the morning.
- Great.

620
00:31:25,578 --> 00:31:27,069
Come on, Jasper.

621
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:30,011
Farley.

622
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:17,672
So you really didn't know
it was me last night?

623
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:19,014
Well, that's what happens...

624
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:21,078
when you go sneaking around
someone else's house.

625
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:22,591
What do you mean,
someone else's house?

626
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:24,117
Well, last time I checked, chief...

627
00:32:24,162 --> 00:32:25,461
you don't live here anymore.

628
00:32:25,498 --> 00:32:27,331
That's not the point.

629
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:54,116
- Morning. Oh, no, sweetheart. Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

630
00:32:54,156 --> 00:32:56,649
That is so rude. Don't do that.

631
00:32:56,694 --> 00:32:58,095
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

632
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,066
- I love you.
- Oh, thank you.

633
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:02,094
Oh, I love you too.

634
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:04,472
- I love you so much.
- Aww. Thank you.

635
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:06,308
He's the best.

636
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:09,182
Well, if it isn't
the future Mrs. Woodcock.

637
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:11,155
Aww.

638
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:15,028
Mmmmm. Mmmmmm.

639
00:33:15,698 --> 00:33:17,065
Mmmm! Ha ha!

640
00:33:17,102 --> 00:33:20,040
Hey, Jasper. How about we spend
the day together?

641
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:21,736
Get to know each other better,
you know?

642
00:33:21,777 --> 00:33:25,182
- What a great idea.
- Yeah.

643
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:29,190
Actually, I have a lot
on my plate today, John.

644
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:31,891
Oh, come on. We'll have fun.

645
00:33:31,931 --> 00:33:34,731
- Mmm!
- L'll take a rain check.

646
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,069
Honey.

647
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:39,707
I'm glad we're doing this.

648
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:41,215
Getting to know each other better...

649
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,879
talking things out.

650
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,322
Conversation leads
to inspiration, right?

651
00:33:47,262 --> 00:33:49,198
That's from my book.

652
00:33:49,232 --> 00:33:51,759
Ah, l'll get you a copy.

653
00:33:51,805 --> 00:33:56,109
Look, I love my mom.
We're very, very close.

654
00:33:56,146 --> 00:33:58,139
Not in a weird way, of course.
Just close.

655
00:33:58,184 --> 00:33:59,584
Listen, we could be pals.

656
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:01,954
We could be guys
that sit and watch foot...

657
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:05,225
...hanging loose at the gym.
To me, this is what life is about.

658
00:34:05,264 --> 00:34:07,861
Now, I'm not saying there's
a problem here. I don't judge.

659
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:09,964
You guys have only known
each other 5 months.

660
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,740
You've got your whole life
ahead of you. You could be kids.

661
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,943
I don't know what you guys
like to do...

662
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:17,011
but it's just
that's... that's what's important.

663
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,548
I'm just trying to tell you,
don't rush, OK?

664
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:21,723
Don't rush your life.

665
00:34:21,765 --> 00:34:23,529
You know?

666
00:34:25,004 --> 00:34:27,099
Running your mouth
doesn't count as exercise.

667
00:34:27,142 --> 00:34:28,873
You gonna work out or what?

668
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:19,506
I think you'll survive.

669
00:35:19,547 --> 00:35:21,345
You're not showering?

670
00:35:21,383 --> 00:35:23,650
No, no. I'm good.

671
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,213
This is not France, Farley.

672
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:26,852
Maybe you don't mind smelling
like a nut sack all day...

673
00:35:26,895 --> 00:35:29,024
but I gotta be in the car with you.

674
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:32,470
There are kids in Africa
who'd kill for a shower.

675
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:35,306
Come on, Farley. Move it.

676
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:38,205
You called me Farley.

677
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,687
You used to call me that
when I was in your class.

678
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,919
It's your name, isn't it?

679
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,827
You really don't remember me?

680
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:46,561
Well, with your innate athletic ability...

681
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:47,796
it's hard to believe, huh?

682
00:35:47,836 --> 00:35:49,669
Do you remember what...

683
00:35:49,707 --> 00:35:51,609
Simply rub the solution on your teeth...

684
00:35:51,644 --> 00:35:53,739
wait a few moments and then rinse.

685
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:58,485
- Morning, boys.
- Jasper, you old side-winder.

686
00:35:58,525 --> 00:36:00,016
Come to get your ears lowered?

687
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:01,826
Hey, you look like you could stand...

688
00:36:01,864 --> 00:36:04,358
to have a little taken
off the top, you damn hippy.

689
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:05,769
Well, looks like you could stand...

690
00:36:05,806 --> 00:36:08,437
to have a little taken off the
middle, you fat son of a bitch.

691
00:36:08,478 --> 00:36:10,380
Ha ha ha!

692
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:13,410
Hee hee hee.

693
00:36:13,455 --> 00:36:15,755
You got an appointment?

694
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:18,161
- No, sir. I'm with him.
- Sit down, Farley.

695
00:36:18,198 --> 00:36:20,259
God knows
you could use a little trim.

696
00:36:20,302 --> 00:36:21,565
- Ha ha ha!
- I don't know, Jasper.

697
00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:24,167
You think that boy
even knows what trim is?

698
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,203
Ha ha ha!

699
00:36:26,247 --> 00:36:28,045
Sit down, Huckleberry.

700
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:31,420
- Maybe clean up the back a little bit.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

701
00:36:31,457 --> 00:36:35,021
So, Jasper.
How's that hell cat of yours doing?

702
00:36:35,064 --> 00:36:37,729
- Yeah, she's keeping me young.
- Yes, she is.

703
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,740
- In the sack.
- Ha!

704
00:36:39,774 --> 00:36:43,111
Yeah, well, I'm gonna make
an honest woman out of her.

705
00:36:43,148 --> 00:36:44,980
Thought you woulda learned
the first time.

706
00:36:45,017 --> 00:36:47,511
Yeah, guess not.

707
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:49,253
You never told me
you were married before.

708
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:52,265
Yeah, well, I never told you about
my kidney stones either. So what?

709
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:56,469
Whoa! What are you doing?

710
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:59,445
Well, don't have a hissy fit, Nancy!

711
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,848
Lt's just a pair of clippers.

712
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,660
You knew they were gonna do that.

713
00:37:08,698 --> 00:37:10,691
If you didn't want a haircut
you didn't have to get one.

714
00:37:10,736 --> 00:37:12,729
This is not Russia.

715
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,624
- You're late, you fairy!
- How you doing, Dad?

716
00:37:24,663 --> 00:37:27,692
All I do all day is watch Judge
Joe Brown and piss myself.

717
00:37:27,736 --> 00:37:29,433
How the hell
do you think I'm doing?

718
00:37:29,473 --> 00:37:31,670
Wait, you have a father?

719
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:33,340
Yes, Farley, I'm not Jesus.

720
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:37,082
- Who is this genius?
- It's, uh, Beverly's kid.

721
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,454
Looks like he got a little retard in him.

722
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:39,686
Are you simple, boy?

723
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:41,526
- Ha ha ha.
- So, Dad...

724
00:37:41,564 --> 00:37:44,365
- I'm getting married.
- Again?

725
00:37:44,403 --> 00:37:45,428
So... Yes.

726
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,408
Didn't you screw that up enough
the first time?

727
00:37:47,442 --> 00:37:51,075
L'll give it 6 months. Oh, l'll
outlive this marriage. And you!

728
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:54,989
How down on her luck must your
momma be to marry a gym teacher?

729
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:58,657
She knows that he plays
hopscotch for a living, right?

730
00:37:58,698 --> 00:38:00,794
- You think I'm funny, boy?
- No.

731
00:38:00,837 --> 00:38:02,773
- You want to wrestle me?
- Uh, no, thank you.

732
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:04,503
Come on, wrestle an old man!

733
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:05,978
- Dad...
- Come on, cream puff!

734
00:38:06,013 --> 00:38:09,247
My legs are as useless
as your little pecker, but come on!

735
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,279
- Dad, Dad...
- Come on!

736
00:38:11,324 --> 00:38:13,989
I'm going to teach my class now.
Do you want to go to the pool?

737
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:17,696
Water sports is
for girls and sodomites!

738
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:18,727
Sodomites.

739
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:20,708
OK, l'll see you later, Dad.

740
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:23,441
- Well, it was a pleasure.
- Beat it, fruitcake!

741
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:26,180
He seems like a really nice guy.

742
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,588
You want a shoe up your ass, Farley?

743
00:38:28,626 --> 00:38:29,719
No.

744
00:38:31,364 --> 00:38:33,527
Robinson, go dump a bedpan.

745
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:38,477
OK, let's move it.

746
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:46,020
Get those arms up!

747
00:38:47,229 --> 00:38:49,564
Where's Palumbo?

748
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:52,333
Palumbo, are you crippled and deaf?

749
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,807
Into the pool!

750
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:57,375
Palumbo, don't push me.

751
00:38:57,416 --> 00:39:00,821
I think his hearing aid
is on the fritz.

752
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:02,689
I didn't ask you, did I, Weaver?

753
00:39:02,727 --> 00:39:03,888
Well, no, I guess not.

754
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:06,195
Rhetorical question, Weaver.
Take a lap.

755
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:08,704
Oh. I was just trying to help!

756
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:10,641
Don't you think you're being
a little harsh with them?

757
00:39:10,676 --> 00:39:12,737
They're just old, Farley.
They're not pathetic.

758
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,443
They enjoy a challenge.

759
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,782
Move those legs.

760
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:22,562
I'm not gonna ask you again, Palumbo.

761
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,433
Lose the attitude.

762
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:26,873
Oh, you think this is funny?

763
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:28,969
All right, that's it, Palumbo.
It's go time.

764
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:30,003
What the...

765
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,483
And Platts, don't think
I'm not watching you.

766
00:39:31,518 --> 00:39:34,284
You're not the first person
in the world to get a hip replacement.

767
00:39:34,324 --> 00:39:36,624
Pick up the pace!

768
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:39,029
OK, Palumbo,
this is your last chance.

769
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:43,204
Oh, really? OK,
we'll do it your way, then.

770
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:45,371
- Whoa, whoa...
- Sink or swim, old man.

771
00:39:45,413 --> 00:39:47,610
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no!
- Sink or swim!

772
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,454
Jesus, are you insane?

773
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:51,980
He doesn't need your help, Farley.

774
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:53,858
What the hell, man? Aah!

775
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:01,934
Sir, it's all right.
I'm trying to help you.

776
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:04,973
I'm trying to save your life!

777
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:06,483
Oh!

778
00:40:06,483 --> 00:40:06,710
Oh!

779
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,176
Hm.

780
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,097
Jackass!

781
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,703
Nice job, Scardusio.
Did you get any tongue?

782
00:40:37,745 --> 00:40:40,342
No, but I get better suction
without the choppers.

783
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:42,115
Makes sense.

784
00:40:42,822 --> 00:40:44,815
Oh!

785
00:40:49,502 --> 00:40:51,529
Come on, Farley, let's saddle up.

786
00:40:51,573 --> 00:40:53,133
I'm waiting for my clothes to dry.

787
00:40:56,183 --> 00:40:57,515
- Hello?
- Hey, John.

788
00:40:57,552 --> 00:40:59,852
I'm on an airplane heading for Chicago.

789
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:01,722
And you'll never guess
who's sitting next to me.

790
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,559
- Who?
- Nobody!

791
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:06,398
Now where is your ass
and why isn't it in seat 2A?

792
00:41:07,138 --> 00:41:09,005
Man, just hold on a second.
I got another call.

793
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:10,772
- Hello?
- I got your message, dude.

794
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:13,978
- What's going on?
- Hey. Hold on.

795
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:16,956
You know, Mr. Woodcock,
I'm just gonna get myself home.

796
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:19,929
Suit yourself, Farley.
Just get some pants on.

797
00:41:19,964 --> 00:41:21,900
This is not Miami.

798
00:41:22,635 --> 00:41:24,662
Suddenly it makes sense.

799
00:41:27,078 --> 00:41:29,640
Nedderman, Woodcock's
been married before.

800
00:41:29,682 --> 00:41:31,447
Now, I need you to find out
who she is...

801
00:41:31,486 --> 00:41:32,647
and then pick me up at Alterman's.

802
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:34,921
Right. The nursing home?

803
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,690
Yeah, and bring me some underwear.

804
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,495
Some of mine?

805
00:41:38,534 --> 00:41:40,470
- Listen, Maggie.
- Hello?

806
00:41:40,504 --> 00:41:42,098
Everything's going to shit
right now, OK?

807
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:43,131
I'm sorry. L'll call you tomorrow.

808
00:41:43,177 --> 00:41:44,976
No, John, don't hang...

809
00:41:45,014 --> 00:41:46,448
Asshole!

810
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:51,621
Excuse me. Hi.
Could I get a real bottle, please?

811
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,927
I'm an alcoholic, not a Barbie doll.

812
00:41:56,303 --> 00:41:58,136
What happened to your head?

813
00:41:58,173 --> 00:42:00,268
Just drive, Nedderman.

814
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:04,881
Her name is Sally Jensen.

815
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,152
Oh, good work!
Let's go see her right now.

816
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,660
Why?

817
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:11,063
Well, think about it, Nedderman.

818
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:13,696
Who's more likely to have dirt
on Woodcock than his ex-wife?

819
00:42:13,738 --> 00:42:16,231
But in your book don't you say...

820
00:42:16,276 --> 00:42:18,473
digging up the past
muddies up the present?

821
00:42:18,513 --> 00:42:20,415
Yes, I do...

822
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:21,943
but that's only true if the past...

823
00:42:21,988 --> 00:42:23,581
doesn't actually affect the present.

824
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,491
Think about it, Nedderman.

825
00:42:25,527 --> 00:42:27,623
If I can learn something
about Woodcock's past...

826
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:31,105
that'll save my mom from future
heartache in the future...

827
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:32,608
then I don't really have a choice...

828
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:34,373
but to address it
in the present, right?

829
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:36,405
L... Guess not.

830
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:38,351
Exactly.

831
00:42:41,794 --> 00:42:43,559
Who is that?

832
00:42:43,598 --> 00:42:45,659
That's my brother, Clark.

833
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:53,346
There it is.

834
00:42:53,383 --> 00:42:55,616
Home of the former Mrs. Woodcock.

835
00:42:56,423 --> 00:42:57,756
All right. I'm going in.

836
00:42:57,793 --> 00:43:00,856
Nedderman, I need you
to find more dirt on Woodcock, all right?

837
00:43:00,899 --> 00:43:04,896
Think outside the box.
See the challenge, focus on it...

838
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,673
visualize, attack it
and then reuse it, OK?

839
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:10,275
- You got me?
- L... I won't let you down, John. I promise.

840
00:43:10,317 --> 00:43:13,312
- Thanks for the underwear.
- Sorry if they're big.

841
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,962
Hey, see if she has a pool!

842
00:43:20,004 --> 00:43:23,067
Or a koi pond!

843
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,739
A fish tank?

844
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,271
Nedderman.

845
00:43:29,556 --> 00:43:31,321
Sally Jensen?

846
00:43:32,629 --> 00:43:34,257
Who are you?

847
00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:37,031
Um, I'm John Farley.

848
00:43:38,173 --> 00:43:39,870
Can I get you something to drink?

849
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,814
I think I have a clean glass
around here somewhere.

850
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:44,751
No, I'm good, thanks.

851
00:43:50,097 --> 00:43:52,124
I love your book.

852
00:43:52,168 --> 00:43:54,662
Turned my life around.

853
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,644
Must be my lucky day.

854
00:43:58,681 --> 00:44:01,949
Hometown hero in the flesh
right here in my own living room.

855
00:44:03,123 --> 00:44:05,093
What do you want?

856
00:44:05,127 --> 00:44:08,692
I'm doing research...
for my next book.

857
00:44:08,734 --> 00:44:11,433
If you don't mind my asking,
why did you divorce?

858
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:13,239
Why do you think?

859
00:44:13,277 --> 00:44:14,745
Infidelity.

860
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,014
Over and over again.

861
00:44:18,053 --> 00:44:20,820
Should have broke it off
years earlier, but...

862
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:22,158
But what?

863
00:44:22,195 --> 00:44:26,898
- The sex was amazing.
- Oh.

864
00:44:26,937 --> 00:44:28,930
I'm telling you,
that man knows how to use...

865
00:44:28,975 --> 00:44:30,604
what the good Lord gave him.

866
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:32,672
Oh, right. Thanks for that.

867
00:44:32,716 --> 00:44:36,315
Once, I actually blacked out.

868
00:44:36,357 --> 00:44:41,197
Can you imagine blacking out
from sheer pleasure?

869
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:45,901
Once I spoke Portuguese
and I don't even know the language.

870
00:44:45,942 --> 00:44:48,641
- OK, I think that's enough.
- Ha ha ha.

871
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:50,776
Um, this has been very helpful...

872
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:52,481
and disturbing all at the same time.

873
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:56,053
Why? Do you know Jasper?

874
00:44:56,096 --> 00:44:59,500
Actually I do. Uh, he was
a teacher of mine, years ago.

875
00:44:59,536 --> 00:45:02,133
And, uh, he's marrying my mom.

876
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:05,443
Saw him last week
at the coffee shop with her.

877
00:45:05,481 --> 00:45:07,883
A big-titted, blonde tramp.

878
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,983
Sorry. No offense.

879
00:45:11,026 --> 00:45:14,157
She looks awfully young
to be your mom.

880
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:16,362
- He's cheating on her.
- What?

881
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:19,102
Yup. He cheated on his ex-wife.
That's why they got divorced.

882
00:45:19,142 --> 00:45:20,167
Now he's doing the same thing
to my mom...

883
00:45:20,211 --> 00:45:23,274
with some big-titted, blonde tramp.

884
00:45:23,317 --> 00:45:25,880
So that's great. So... So we just
gotta tell your mom now.

885
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,992
No, I can't just tell her.

886
00:45:28,027 --> 00:45:29,393
She doesn't listen to me
when it comes to Woodcock.

887
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:31,194
- We need proof.
- No problem.

888
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:33,100
We've been working on
some killer stuff on our end.

889
00:45:33,137 --> 00:45:35,904
Good. Meet me at my place
as soon as possible.

890
00:45:40,118 --> 00:45:42,315
You wanted evidence, you got it.

891
00:45:42,355 --> 00:45:43,881
It may not prove Woodcock's cheating...

892
00:45:43,925 --> 00:45:45,758
but it does prove he's a huge dick.

893
00:45:45,796 --> 00:45:47,732
What happened to his eye?

894
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:50,567
Look, don't worry about him.
He's fine.

895
00:45:50,605 --> 00:45:54,842
When she sees this, man,
she'll come to her senses.

896
00:45:54,881 --> 00:45:58,320
No, Mr. Woodcock.
Please don't hurt me again.

897
00:45:58,354 --> 00:46:00,085
Aah!

898
00:46:01,393 --> 00:46:03,454
Ha ha ha. Well?

899
00:46:03,497 --> 00:46:06,025
You threw a chair at your brother?

900
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,165
Weren't you watching?

901
00:46:08,207 --> 00:46:10,074
Lt wasn't me that threw
the chair at him...

902
00:46:10,111 --> 00:46:11,944
it was Woodcock
that threw the chair.

903
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:13,814
He said Woodcock.
Woodcock threw that chair!

904
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:16,220
Honey? Hi, are you home?

905
00:46:16,256 --> 00:46:20,196
Oh, look, that's so nice.
You've got some friends over.

906
00:46:20,231 --> 00:46:21,632
Hi, I'm John's mom.

907
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,633
Nedderman.

908
00:46:26,678 --> 00:46:29,080
Nedderman.

909
00:46:29,116 --> 00:46:31,917
You remember him?
We were in the same class.

910
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,391
What happened to your head?

911
00:46:34,426 --> 00:46:36,123
Woodcock doesn't deserve her.

912
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:38,429
Farley's mom is hot.
I mean, yes, she's old and shit...

913
00:46:38,467 --> 00:46:40,403
but God, I just want
to stick my face...

914
00:46:40,438 --> 00:46:43,639
between those great old titties
and go, "Brrrrrrr!

915
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:47,412
"Brrrrr!
Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrrr!"

916
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:49,183
Nedderman, turn it off.

917
00:46:49,222 --> 00:46:51,989
...titties and go, "Brrrrrrr!"

918
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,193
Big old... big old titties...

919
00:46:54,232 --> 00:46:55,667
Big old titties...

920
00:46:55,702 --> 00:46:57,227
- Jasper.
- Brrrrrrrrr!

921
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,434
Jasper!

922
00:47:00,244 --> 00:47:03,445
I meant that in the most
respectful way possible.

923
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:08,590
Run!

924
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:10,893
Mrs. Farley!

925
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:12,800
You people are sick, Farley.

926
00:47:12,837 --> 00:47:15,673
- I barely know those guys, Mom.
- OK...

927
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:21,175
Well... Let's just pretend
that never happened.

928
00:47:23,592 --> 00:47:26,188
Johnny, are you all right?

929
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:31,172
Jasper said that he thought
you seemed upset today.

930
00:47:31,206 --> 00:47:34,976
Oh! He did? Oh.

931
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:38,920
Sweetie, look, I know
that it's not easy for you...

932
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:41,290
to have a new man in our house.

933
00:47:41,327 --> 00:47:42,886
But we're getting married...

934
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,695
and he's gonna be part of our family.

935
00:47:46,671 --> 00:47:50,941
All I want is for
just you two to get along.

936
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:53,712
Is that asking too much?

937
00:47:53,752 --> 00:47:55,244
Could you try?

938
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,814
For me?

939
00:47:58,495 --> 00:48:00,054
OK.

940
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:02,500
- I love you, Mom.
- Oh, sweetie. I love you too.

941
00:48:02,536 --> 00:48:05,372
- Thank you. Oh!
- Sorry.

942
00:48:05,409 --> 00:48:07,743
Let's go to Cornival.
Let's have a good time tonight.

943
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,115
Great. We'll have a great night.
All of us.

944
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:31,193
* My loves have some stories... *

945
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:34,362
- Come on, tell me.
- No, forget it.

946
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,029
No, I want to know!

947
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:38,666
- Look, I'm embarrassed, OK?
- Oh!

948
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,179
John, you can't just start
saying something and then stop.

949
00:48:41,214 --> 00:48:43,912
- Come on.
- Never mind, never mind.

950
00:48:43,952 --> 00:48:46,116
John.

951
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,354
Oh, all right. Um...

952
00:48:48,395 --> 00:48:53,360
I've had the biggest crush
on you since the 7th grade.

953
00:48:53,405 --> 00:48:57,641
Ha ha ha. And here we are!

954
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,741
Yeah, here we are.

955
00:48:59,784 --> 00:49:01,617
The cornival.

956
00:49:01,654 --> 00:49:04,626
- I'm glad you called.
- Yeah, me too.

957
00:49:05,897 --> 00:49:08,800
- Jasper! Let me do it.
- Lift it up. Keep it up high.

958
00:49:10,272 --> 00:49:12,003
Oh! Now you're cheating!

959
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:16,176
Aw. You have to admit,
they're kind of cute together.

960
00:49:16,217 --> 00:49:17,914
You're kidding?

961
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:21,051
No, your mom is beautiful.

962
00:49:21,094 --> 00:49:24,430
And Woodcock's kinda sexy,
you know.

963
00:49:24,467 --> 00:49:26,733
- Mr. Woodcock?
- Yeah.

964
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:30,734
I mean, just, I don't know,
the way he... he carries himself.

965
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,875
- What?
- There's just something about him.

966
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:35,683
It's like this bravado
and... I don't know.

967
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,057
All the girls at school love him.
I mean, he's hilarious.

968
00:49:38,094 --> 00:49:39,757
One time he grabbed me by my...

969
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:41,357
He coxes them
in the teachers' lounge.

970
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,735
He has this little game
that we play with his whistle.

971
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:47,713
Actually, I've always kinda
had a crush on Woodcock.

972
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:53,415
Wow! You... you wanna go?

973
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:54,984
Yeah, sure.

974
00:49:55,028 --> 00:49:56,998
That's cool, right?
You're not... you're not gonna eat that.

975
00:50:01,107 --> 00:50:03,043
Hey, guys. How are you doing?

976
00:50:03,077 --> 00:50:05,445
Oh, good. I'm done.

977
00:50:05,482 --> 00:50:07,483
Um, why don't you two
play a little bit, huh?

978
00:50:07,483 --> 00:50:08,416
Um, why don't you two
play a little bit, huh?

979
00:50:08,451 --> 00:50:10,512
- I thought you wanted to win a panda.
- Oh, it's all right.

980
00:50:10,555 --> 00:50:12,617
- L'll win you a panda, Mom.
- Oh!

981
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,495
- Sure you brought enough cash?
- Jasper.

982
00:50:15,532 --> 00:50:19,404
OK, so let's go get some cotton
candy and let the boys play.

983
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,000
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

984
00:50:21,043 --> 00:50:23,445
Win me a puppy.

985
00:50:23,481 --> 00:50:25,816
- OK, Woodcock.
- Looks like we got a challenge.

986
00:50:25,853 --> 00:50:27,982
- Let's play.
- Good luck, young man.

987
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,825
There you go, sir. Here we go!

988
00:50:30,863 --> 00:50:32,799
Ha! Harder than it looks!

989
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:34,997
Hey, nice shot!

990
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,642
Try again, kid.

991
00:50:37,677 --> 00:50:40,375
We got a shooter, folks!

992
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:42,852
- Oh!
- Nice one, Farley.

993
00:50:42,887 --> 00:50:45,380
- Damn it!
- Whoo!

994
00:50:45,425 --> 00:50:46,894
That's a winner right there.

995
00:50:46,929 --> 00:50:49,992
Looks like a panda to me, sir.
Nice job.

996
00:50:50,035 --> 00:50:53,805
All right, kid.
Everybody's a winner. Ha ha ha!

997
00:50:55,145 --> 00:50:57,639
I've seen better shooting
at the special Olympics.

998
00:50:57,684 --> 00:51:01,088
- Basketball's not really my game.
- Really?

999
00:51:01,123 --> 00:51:03,458
What is your game?
Whac A Mole?

1000
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:13,144
Stupid game!

1001
00:51:13,181 --> 00:51:16,814
I just wanna warn you, Farley.
I'm a card-carrying member of the N.R.A.

1002
00:51:16,855 --> 00:51:19,018
You don't have a prayer.

1003
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:20,926
Ready, gentlemen!

1004
00:51:31,518 --> 00:51:34,456
- We have a winner!
- Don't be a sore loser.

1005
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,290
I'm telling you,
my gun was messed up.

1006
00:51:36,328 --> 00:51:38,457
It's never the gun, Farley,
it's always the hunter.

1007
00:51:38,499 --> 00:51:40,901
"Corn-eating Corntest."

1008
00:51:42,407 --> 00:51:44,309
Oh, it's on.

1009
00:51:46,348 --> 00:51:47,714
You're going down, Woodcock.

1010
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,583
You must like
getting spanked, Farley.

1011
00:51:49,621 --> 00:51:51,614
- I guess it runs in the family.
- Here you go, boys.

1012
00:51:51,658 --> 00:51:52,717
Begin!

1013
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,527
Oh, I shoulda known
that you'd be here.

1014
00:51:55,566 --> 00:51:59,563
You know, Johnny won this competition
what, 6 times in a row?

1015
00:51:59,607 --> 00:52:01,577
- 7. 7.
- When he was little. 7 times!

1016
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:03,547
And against adults, too!

1017
00:52:03,582 --> 00:52:06,520
And here we go, corn-testants!
And may the best...

1018
00:52:06,555 --> 00:52:09,254
Oh, they're getting ready to go
so we'll just go over here.

1019
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:12,060
- Remember, half cobs do not count.
- Good luck!

1020
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,662
See you, girls.
That's funny, Farley.

1021
00:52:14,704 --> 00:52:16,731
I didn't know fat kids
ate their vegetables.

1022
00:52:16,775 --> 00:52:18,608
Save it for the corn-test, old man.

1023
00:52:18,645 --> 00:52:20,080
- Ready for this?
- Yes!

1024
00:52:20,116 --> 00:52:22,313
Are the corn-testants ready for this?

1025
00:52:22,353 --> 00:52:26,418
Lf you are ready, then get set...

1026
00:52:28,298 --> 00:52:30,564
There they go,
ladies and gentlemen...

1027
00:52:30,603 --> 00:52:32,163
Iook at them gnaw on that corn!

1028
00:52:32,206 --> 00:52:34,233
Do you see those teeth?

1029
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:39,443
Half a cob doesn't count.

1030
00:52:42,627 --> 00:52:44,096
Pretty good there, Farley?

1031
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,963
Keep it going. Look there.
Look at them go.

1032
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:47,629
You want to pace yourself, Farley.

1033
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,267
Just let go, Woodcock.

1034
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:54,647
Great tension. Hey, hey, keep your hand off
your neighbor's cob!

1035
00:52:54,684 --> 00:52:56,847
Penalty!

1036
00:52:56,889 --> 00:52:58,687
All right, here we go.
Keep chewing that corn!

1037
00:53:00,529 --> 00:53:01,622
10 seconds left!

1038
00:53:01,665 --> 00:53:03,498
Coming down to the end now.

1039
00:53:03,535 --> 00:53:08,136
5, 4, 3...

1040
00:53:08,178 --> 00:53:10,080
2, 1!

1041
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,114
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner!

1042
00:53:27,149 --> 00:53:30,280
And that winner is, again...

1043
00:53:30,322 --> 00:53:32,292
- John Farley!
- Whoo!

1044
00:53:32,326 --> 00:53:37,736
Ha ha ha! Yes! Whoo!
You got beat, sweetheart!

1045
00:53:37,771 --> 00:53:40,367
Whoo! Whoo!

1046
00:53:40,409 --> 00:53:43,814
Whooooooo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-whoo-whoo! Ha ha ha!

1047
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:48,291
Oh, yeah, baby! Whoo!
Whooo-hoo-hoo!

1048
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,660
I'm the big winner. I win!

1049
00:53:50,697 --> 00:53:53,760
I'm the big winner
'cause this is my house, bitch!

1050
00:53:53,803 --> 00:53:56,399
- Whoo-hoo!
- John Michael Farley!

1051
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,776
What has come over you?

1052
00:54:01,953 --> 00:54:03,421
Ugh!

1053
00:54:04,758 --> 00:54:08,162
Lt's OK, Farley.
I know how to cheer her up.

1054
00:54:08,198 --> 00:54:11,398
Do me a favor. Snag my bears.

1055
00:54:11,438 --> 00:54:14,969
Well, John, you really...
ate that corn.

1056
00:54:19,822 --> 00:54:21,154
Thanks.

1057
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:41,730
- Hello?
- Wake up!

1058
00:54:41,766 --> 00:54:43,793
I got something to show you.

1059
00:54:43,836 --> 00:54:45,772
Nedderman? What's going on?

1060
00:54:45,807 --> 00:54:47,470
And at 0800 hours...

1061
00:54:47,511 --> 00:54:49,275
a blonde chick
rolled up in that car...

1062
00:54:49,313 --> 00:54:50,748
and went into Woodcock's house.

1063
00:54:50,784 --> 00:54:55,419
How long you been
staking out his house?

1064
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,396
17, 18 hours.

1065
00:54:59,968 --> 00:55:02,063
Hey... there she is!

1066
00:55:02,106 --> 00:55:06,103
- What?
- Oh, that son of a bitch!

1067
00:55:06,147 --> 00:55:07,946
What kind of asshole
would cheat on his wife...

1068
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:09,419
before he's even married?

1069
00:55:09,455 --> 00:55:11,755
The same kind of asshole that
would make a kid run laps...

1070
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:13,557
until his nipples bleed.

1071
00:55:13,596 --> 00:55:14,894
Shit!

1072
00:55:24,718 --> 00:55:27,281
Now, then.
We gotta go in there.

1073
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,455
Oh, bro, staking out
the guy's place is one thing...

1074
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:32,056
but breaking and entering,
that's another.

1075
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:34,468
Nedderman,
we need concrete proof.

1076
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:35,803
John, I haven't shit my pants...

1077
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,605
since the balance beam
in the 7th grade.

1078
00:55:37,644 --> 00:55:40,012
L... l... I'd like to keep it that way.

1079
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:41,711
And what about your book,
chapter 14?

1080
00:55:41,752 --> 00:55:44,349
"Respect other people's boundaries."

1081
00:55:44,391 --> 00:55:46,019
Wait, do you have the book with you?

1082
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,359
Yeah.

1083
00:55:47,397 --> 00:55:48,558
Oh, great.

1084
00:55:49,902 --> 00:55:52,203
Let me see this. See.

1085
00:55:55,045 --> 00:55:57,983
Forget the book! Just forget it!

1086
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:01,286
I can't take this book anymore!

1087
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:04,593
'Cause every 30 seconds you're
in my ear, like, wah, wah, wah!

1088
00:56:04,631 --> 00:56:07,865
I can't do it, OK?
I wrote it, I know what's in it!

1089
00:56:07,904 --> 00:56:10,876
Lt's crap! I'm done with it, OK?

1090
00:56:13,082 --> 00:56:14,311
What?

1091
00:56:14,351 --> 00:56:16,412
Hey... it's Tracy.

1092
00:56:17,824 --> 00:56:19,623
Hey, Tracy.

1093
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:22,531
- How are you?
- Fine. Um...

1094
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:24,127
listen, John, about last night.

1095
00:56:24,171 --> 00:56:27,541
You seem like you're in
a really weird place right now.

1096
00:56:27,577 --> 00:56:31,813
Really? No, I feel great.

1097
00:56:31,852 --> 00:56:32,980
I really do.

1098
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:36,188
Well, maybe you should
just call me...

1099
00:56:36,228 --> 00:56:39,394
when things are
a little more... stable?

1100
00:56:39,434 --> 00:56:41,131
I think that'd be best.

1101
00:56:41,171 --> 00:56:43,198
Oh.

1102
00:56:43,242 --> 00:56:45,235
OK, um...

1103
00:56:46,548 --> 00:56:49,520
I respect your feelings
and your decision. L...

1104
00:56:49,554 --> 00:56:51,717
I'm sorry you feel that way.

1105
00:56:51,759 --> 00:56:54,754
All right. Well,
take care of yourself, OK?

1106
00:56:56,168 --> 00:56:57,431
Yep, you too.

1107
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:58,871
Bye.

1108
00:56:58,907 --> 00:57:00,239
Bye.

1109
00:57:05,921 --> 00:57:07,321
OK, this is the plan.

1110
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:08,883
We're gonna break into
Woodcock's place.

1111
00:57:08,927 --> 00:57:10,225
We're gonna plant
your video camera...

1112
00:57:10,263 --> 00:57:11,595
then we're gonna catch him
cheating on my mom...

1113
00:57:11,632 --> 00:57:13,295
and then we're gonna finish
this effing fiasco...

1114
00:57:13,336 --> 00:57:15,033
once and for all, OK?

1115
00:57:15,073 --> 00:57:18,375
Right, Clark, give me
the minicam. You're on lookout.

1116
00:57:18,412 --> 00:57:21,077
Anything happens, honk the horn,
you understand me?

1117
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,817
Nedderman! Lt's open.

1118
00:57:50,543 --> 00:57:52,479
What the...

1119
00:57:56,255 --> 00:57:57,952
- What are you doing?
- Sor...

1120
00:57:57,992 --> 00:57:59,825
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1121
00:57:59,862 --> 00:58:01,832
- Jesus.
- OK.

1122
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,777
Hello, smoking gun.

1123
00:58:34,397 --> 00:58:36,367
Damn it, Clark!

1124
00:58:37,605 --> 00:58:39,403
Oh, shit!

1125
00:58:41,913 --> 00:58:43,473
Nedderman?

1126
00:58:43,517 --> 00:58:45,213
Nedderman!

1127
00:58:55,674 --> 00:58:57,610
Jasper, I'm still upset with you.

1128
00:58:57,645 --> 00:58:59,911
I know, honey,
but you know how I get...

1129
00:58:59,949 --> 00:59:02,112
- when I don't have you to myself.
- Aah.

1130
00:59:02,153 --> 00:59:04,716
- I just need some... alone time.
- What about me?

1131
00:59:04,759 --> 00:59:07,890
Well, honey, it wouldn't be
alone time without you.

1132
00:59:07,932 --> 00:59:10,232
- You know what I mean!
- Ha ha ha!

1133
00:59:10,269 --> 00:59:13,139
Jasper, you charmer. Oh!

1134
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:16,011
Mmmmmm!

1135
00:59:16,048 --> 00:59:19,179
Oh, honey. Oh, darling.

1136
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,450
Bad boy!

1137
00:59:23,128 --> 00:59:26,100
- Feel good, baby?
- Yes! Yes!

1138
00:59:26,134 --> 00:59:27,626
Rhetorical question, Beverly!

1139
00:59:27,671 --> 00:59:30,199
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Oh, yeah!

1140
00:59:30,243 --> 00:59:32,236
- Feel the love!
- I don't want to black out again.

1141
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:34,147
The finish line's in sight, honey.

1142
00:59:39,495 --> 00:59:41,658
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

1143
00:59:41,699 --> 00:59:44,603
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Yes!

1144
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,787
That was way better than
anything on the internet.

1145
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:07,283
Excuse me,
may I have your attention?

1146
01:00:07,317 --> 01:00:08,716
Uh, if everyone
would, uh... would grab a seat...

1147
01:00:08,716 --> 01:00:10,117
Uh, if everyone
would, uh... would grab a seat...

1148
01:00:10,153 --> 01:00:12,089
and I get the honorees up on stage...

1149
01:00:12,123 --> 01:00:13,421
we can get started.

1150
01:00:13,459 --> 01:00:17,024
For the past 26 years,
Jasper Woodcock's name...

1151
01:00:17,067 --> 01:00:20,870
has been synonymous with
the words "physical education".

1152
01:00:20,907 --> 01:00:22,308
Now, before we get
to the presentation...

1153
01:00:22,343 --> 01:00:23,641
let's hear from some of the people...

1154
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:27,779
whose lives have been touched
by this great man.

1155
01:00:27,821 --> 01:00:29,450
Honey, where were you?

1156
01:00:29,491 --> 01:00:31,723
I thought you were gonna ride
with us. I was worried.

1157
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:34,963
Sorry, Mom.
L... I needed some alone time.

1158
01:00:35,002 --> 01:00:36,972
Oh.

1159
01:00:37,006 --> 01:00:42,074
My name is Zoe. And last summer,
my cat Raisins ran away.

1160
01:00:42,117 --> 01:00:45,887
That man found her. Her collar
was caught on a fence.

1161
01:00:45,924 --> 01:00:49,055
She was dead from stran... gulation.

1162
01:00:49,097 --> 01:00:51,033
But she's in heaven now.

1163
01:00:51,068 --> 01:00:53,766
Thank you for finding Raisins,
Mr. Woodcock.

1164
01:00:58,549 --> 01:01:00,018
You're kidding me.

1165
01:01:00,052 --> 01:01:01,418
When I was in his class...

1166
01:01:01,455 --> 01:01:04,120
Mr. Woodcock found a brick
of marijuana in my locker.

1167
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:07,725
He could have sent me
to the principal, but no.

1168
01:01:07,767 --> 01:01:09,829
He called the cops.

1169
01:01:09,872 --> 01:01:13,743
And instead of going to
detention I did 6 years in juvi.

1170
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:17,378
Where I found my lord
and savior, Jesus Christ.

1171
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,581
Jesus Christ!

1172
01:01:18,622 --> 01:01:21,993
And I have been
mostly drug-free ever since.

1173
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:25,332
Thank you, Mr. Woodcock.

1174
01:01:25,369 --> 01:01:27,806
"Mr. Woodcock is
one of the best teachers.

1175
01:01:27,841 --> 01:01:29,936
"He taught me how to play hard
and never give up.

1176
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:35,320
"Because of him, I got
a scholarship to play football.

1177
01:01:35,356 --> 01:01:37,121
"Ln college."

1178
01:01:38,095 --> 01:01:40,760
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Woodcock.

1179
01:01:40,801 --> 01:01:42,360
What the fuck?

1180
01:01:43,272 --> 01:01:45,299
Woodcock never talks down to us.

1181
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,313
He treats us just like everyone else.

1182
01:01:47,347 --> 01:01:49,249
I named my kid after Woodcock.

1183
01:01:49,852 --> 01:01:51,754
Woodcock taught me
how to be a man.

1184
01:01:51,789 --> 01:01:53,553
Woodcock taught me
how to be a man.

1185
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:55,722
Woodcock taught me
how to be a man.

1186
01:01:56,465 --> 01:01:57,764
Woodcock taught me CPR.

1187
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:59,497
- Woodcock saved my life.
- Bullshit!

1188
01:01:59,537 --> 01:02:00,527
- Woodcock...
- Woodcock...

1189
01:02:00,574 --> 01:02:01,564
- Woodcock...
- Woodcock...

1190
01:02:01,609 --> 01:02:02,907
Woodcock...

1191
01:02:02,945 --> 01:02:04,311
- Woodcock.
- Woodcock.

1192
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:06,614
Jasper Woodcock.

1193
01:02:06,653 --> 01:02:08,680
Educator of the Year.

1194
01:02:20,012 --> 01:02:21,743
Go, Jasper!

1195
01:02:23,052 --> 01:02:25,352
Thanks a lot. Uh...

1196
01:02:26,626 --> 01:02:28,528
appreciate it.

1197
01:02:33,873 --> 01:02:35,273
Ha ha ha.

1198
01:02:35,309 --> 01:02:37,279
That's, uh... that's good stuff,
Jasper. Thank you.

1199
01:02:37,313 --> 01:02:38,372
Unbelievable!

1200
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:41,251
We have one more award to give out.

1201
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,757
The Corn Cob Key.

1202
01:02:48,436 --> 01:02:50,736
Given to those
who go off into the world...

1203
01:02:50,774 --> 01:02:53,267
and make Forest Meadow proud.

1204
01:02:53,312 --> 01:02:55,111
Right.

1205
01:02:55,149 --> 01:02:58,850
Ladies and gentlemen, John Farley!

1206
01:03:14,622 --> 01:03:16,683
Ha ha ha.

1207
01:03:19,565 --> 01:03:22,035
Are you guys out of your minds?

1208
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:23,663
Ha ha ha.

1209
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:27,578
Seriously. Am I the only one...

1210
01:03:27,614 --> 01:03:28,843
that thinks that Woodcock's like...

1211
01:03:28,883 --> 01:03:30,512
the biggest asshole on the planet?

1212
01:03:37,701 --> 01:03:38,964
I mean, for 26 years...

1213
01:03:39,003 --> 01:03:41,770
this guy's been pelting children
with basketballs...

1214
01:03:41,809 --> 01:03:43,038
at point-blank range.

1215
01:03:43,078 --> 01:03:44,707
And now you're giving him
an award for it?

1216
01:03:44,748 --> 01:03:46,843
- He should be in jail!
- Johnny. Johnny.

1217
01:03:46,886 --> 01:03:49,380
I mean, is there any question
that he strangled this girl's cat?

1218
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:52,192
What... what was her name,
Raisins? Yeah, you know what?

1219
01:03:52,231 --> 01:03:54,724
Go home, dig up Raisins,
perform an autopsy on him...

1220
01:03:54,768 --> 01:03:57,331
you'll find out
it wasn't an accident.

1221
01:03:57,374 --> 01:04:00,369
Dogs don't strangle cats.
Sadistic gym teachers do.

1222
01:04:02,918 --> 01:04:03,749
OK.

1223
01:04:03,786 --> 01:04:05,949
Somebody put something
in the punch again this year!

1224
01:04:05,991 --> 01:04:08,258
Wait, wait. No, no, I'm serious!

1225
01:04:08,296 --> 01:04:10,664
Look, he hates children.

1226
01:04:11,936 --> 01:04:13,803
He killed one of my classmates.

1227
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,243
Yeah, after years of his abuse...

1228
01:04:16,279 --> 01:04:17,713
Trevor Oates took his own life...

1229
01:04:17,748 --> 01:04:19,775
and he died because of Woodcock.

1230
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:22,051
No, I didn't.

1231
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:26,596
- Oates, I thought you were dead.
- No.

1232
01:04:26,632 --> 01:04:28,933
I had minor surgery a few years back.

1233
01:04:28,971 --> 01:04:32,307
You know, to help with my wheezing.

1234
01:04:33,846 --> 01:04:37,547
Whatever. Oates is alive.
Whoop-di-doo! Who gives a shit?

1235
01:04:37,588 --> 01:04:39,387
- Johnny.
- I'm sorry.

1236
01:04:39,425 --> 01:04:41,156
I'm sorry.
I know you hate to hear that.

1237
01:04:41,195 --> 01:04:42,858
He's not what you think.

1238
01:04:42,899 --> 01:04:44,926
You're brainwashed, people!

1239
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:47,840
Oh, just ask his ex-wife
right there, Sally Jensen.

1240
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:49,241
Tell them about all the man whoring...

1241
01:04:49,278 --> 01:04:51,748
he did behind your back
when you were married.

1242
01:04:51,782 --> 01:04:54,310
Well, I think most of you know
I cheated on him.

1243
01:04:54,355 --> 01:04:56,655
I'm... I'm sorry. What?
You cheated on him?

1244
01:04:56,692 --> 01:05:00,291
A lot. I couldn't help it.
I was a sex addict.

1245
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:01,426
Am.

1246
01:05:01,903 --> 01:05:03,394
Uh, was.

1247
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,267
Am. Ha ha ha.

1248
01:05:06,312 --> 01:05:07,439
Yeah.

1249
01:05:07,481 --> 01:05:08,780
All right, let's go.

1250
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:11,379
That's enough.
That's enough of that!

1251
01:05:12,892 --> 01:05:15,328
- He's cheating on my mom!
- Johnny, sit down right now.

1252
01:05:15,363 --> 01:05:17,732
- That's enough, Farley.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

1253
01:05:17,769 --> 01:05:19,328
You've been sneaking
behind my mom's back...

1254
01:05:19,371 --> 01:05:20,840
with that blonde whore...

1255
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,573
right there, haven't you?

1256
01:05:23,613 --> 01:05:25,344
That's my realtor, you moron.

1257
01:05:25,383 --> 01:05:28,480
I was trying to surprise
your mother with a new house.

1258
01:05:28,523 --> 01:05:32,520
Well, how come I found
her panties in your bedroom?

1259
01:05:36,439 --> 01:05:38,534
Those are your mother's, Farley.

1260
01:05:38,576 --> 01:05:40,409
Mom?

1261
01:05:40,447 --> 01:05:43,283
Yeah. OK, Farley, you and me,
out in the hallway right now.

1262
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:44,720
Now!

1263
01:05:44,756 --> 01:05:46,726
- Uhh!
- You disrespectful little shit!

1264
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,630
I'm gonna give you a good old-fashioned
Nebraska ass-whipping...

1265
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:50,895
till you shit yourself.

1266
01:05:50,935 --> 01:05:52,335
Bring it, bro!

1267
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:54,067
I don't know what I'm gonna
enjoy more tonight...

1268
01:05:54,108 --> 01:05:55,975
kicking your ass
or nailing your mother.

1269
01:05:56,011 --> 01:05:57,742
- Oh!
- Let go of my son, Jasper.

1270
01:06:00,453 --> 01:06:03,254
- Uh, Bev...
- Let go of my son.

1271
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,228
- Bev, l...
- You two are unbelievable.

1272
01:06:05,263 --> 01:06:08,794
You won't be civil even though
it hurts and humiliates me.

1273
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:21,291
Mom!

1274
01:06:31,015 --> 01:06:33,315
Mom, are you OK?

1275
01:06:33,352 --> 01:06:35,915
Go away, John. Leave me alone.

1276
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:43,097
Maggie?

1277
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:45,838
I have been carting around
your damn luggage since Denver!

1278
01:06:45,878 --> 01:06:49,214
Thanks to you blowing off the most
powerful woman in America...

1279
01:06:49,251 --> 01:06:51,722
Walden Books has canceled
the rest of your appearances.

1280
01:06:51,756 --> 01:06:54,124
- I don't believe this.
- I know.

1281
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:56,826
If only someone had warned you!

1282
01:06:56,867 --> 01:06:59,099
- So it's over.
- No, not exactly.

1283
01:06:59,137 --> 01:07:01,130
When you hear about this,
you're gonna want to take me...

1284
01:07:01,175 --> 01:07:03,236
right here in your mommy's house.

1285
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,181
But first I have to pee.
Where's the bathroom?

1286
01:07:05,216 --> 01:07:07,687
You have indoor plumbing
in here, right?

1287
01:07:07,722 --> 01:07:09,316
Lt's not like you deserve
the extra effort...

1288
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,989
but since my reputation's
on the line, I called in a favor.

1289
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:13,624
You're gonna do a remote interview...

1290
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:15,227
on The Tyra Banks Show!

1291
01:07:15,271 --> 01:07:18,037
Tomorrow, 9am,
the diva of daytime talk...

1292
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:19,874
is gonna talk to you live...

1293
01:07:19,913 --> 01:07:23,216
right from this dingy little
shithole you call home.

1294
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:25,485
Fine, good, whatever you need.

1295
01:07:27,261 --> 01:07:29,322
What I need is for you to focus...

1296
01:07:29,365 --> 01:07:31,733
get it together, and point me
to the nearest liquor store.

1297
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:33,171
OK?

1298
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,741
OK, Tyra Banks, very nice.

1299
01:07:38,784 --> 01:07:42,747
But if you do not know your shit
she will gut you like a fish.

1300
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,694
Oh, my Lord.

1301
01:07:47,033 --> 01:07:49,266
You look very beautiful, Mrs. Farley.

1302
01:07:49,305 --> 01:07:50,432
Thank you.

1303
01:07:50,474 --> 01:07:53,344
She does know what decade it is, right?

1304
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:54,746
Mom, what are you doing?

1305
01:07:54,782 --> 01:07:57,447
- I'm going to Cornival.
- Ha ha ha.

1306
01:07:57,488 --> 01:07:59,685
I'm sorry, you hicks
just crack me up.

1307
01:08:02,298 --> 01:08:03,926
Are you sure? I mean...

1308
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,564
After last night, you know...

1309
01:08:06,606 --> 01:08:09,874
I have certain obligations.
I'm still the Corn Cob Queen.

1310
01:08:09,912 --> 01:08:14,217
- Ha ha ha.
- But you'll be by yourself.

1311
01:08:14,255 --> 01:08:16,817
John, I have been alone
on that float for 20 years.

1312
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,921
I think I can handle it.

1313
01:08:19,599 --> 01:08:21,934
Mom, I'm so sorry about last night.

1314
01:08:21,971 --> 01:08:25,171
I... just totally lost my head.

1315
01:08:26,579 --> 01:08:29,380
Do you remember Mr. Spanger?

1316
01:08:29,419 --> 01:08:31,355
He was the first man
that I tried to date...

1317
01:08:31,389 --> 01:08:33,416
after your father died.
I think you were 6.

1318
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,487
And you ran away
from the baby-sitter...

1319
01:08:35,531 --> 01:08:38,298
and we spent the entire night
trying to find you.

1320
01:08:38,336 --> 01:08:40,636
Yeah, I was under the sink.

1321
01:08:42,311 --> 01:08:45,442
Well, every time a man asked me
out, you either got sick...

1322
01:08:45,484 --> 01:08:47,317
or you threw a tantrum...

1323
01:08:47,354 --> 01:08:54,028
or you egged the car, or you did
something until I just gave up.

1324
01:08:54,068 --> 01:08:58,338
Did you ever think of how I felt...

1325
01:08:58,376 --> 01:09:01,371
on my own all these years?

1326
01:09:02,685 --> 01:09:05,350
Uh, I guess...

1327
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,451
I thought you... had me.

1328
01:09:11,035 --> 01:09:12,594
Oh.

1329
01:09:20,354 --> 01:09:22,017
All right, Mr. Farley. 20 seconds.

1330
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:25,325
Hey, game face.
Let's put the hillbilly drama on hold.

1331
01:09:25,364 --> 01:09:28,165
America is waiting.
You look great.

1332
01:09:28,203 --> 01:09:30,697
- This is gonna be fun.
- 15 seconds.

1333
01:09:33,513 --> 01:09:36,178
- I can't do this.
- OK, I understand.

1334
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:37,813
- That's fine.
- Really?

1335
01:09:37,856 --> 01:09:39,290
Of course not!

1336
01:09:39,325 --> 01:09:41,819
Now sit your ass down
and get in front of the camera.

1337
01:09:41,864 --> 01:09:44,391
Quiet on set.

1338
01:09:44,435 --> 01:09:48,968
- All right, people, we're on the air in 3, 2...
- Smile.

1339
01:09:50,715 --> 01:09:52,377
When I read
my next guest's book...

1340
01:09:52,418 --> 01:09:55,254
I knew I had to have him
on The Tyra Show.

1341
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:57,625
He's the best-selling author of
Letting Go...

1342
01:09:57,662 --> 01:09:59,928
How To Get Past Your Past.

1343
01:09:59,967 --> 01:10:03,030
Please welcome, via satellite
from Forest Meadow, Nebraska...

1344
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:04,633
John Farley!

1345
01:10:04,676 --> 01:10:05,905
Hey, John, how you doing?

1346
01:10:05,945 --> 01:10:07,311
I feel great.

1347
01:10:07,348 --> 01:10:09,250
Well, good. You should.

1348
01:10:09,285 --> 01:10:09,950
I mean, your book is inspiring...

1349
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:10,474
I mean, your book is inspiring...

1350
01:10:10,518 --> 01:10:12,647
so many people across this country.

1351
01:10:12,689 --> 01:10:15,525
Who's been your biggest inspiration?

1352
01:10:15,561 --> 01:10:17,052
- Uh, my mom.
- Aah.

1353
01:10:17,097 --> 01:10:19,898
See, my mom is
my biggest inspiration too.

1354
01:10:19,936 --> 01:10:22,236
I mean, I would not be where
I am today were it not...

1355
01:10:22,274 --> 01:10:24,973
Johnny, do you ever think of...

1356
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:28,851
what it was like for me
to be on my own all those years?

1357
01:10:28,888 --> 01:10:31,724
I mean, come on, you guys, give
it up for mommas everywhere!

1358
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,023
Whoo!

1359
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:36,461
I'm... I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1360
01:10:43,116 --> 01:10:45,143
- John?
- You go back in there!

1361
01:10:45,187 --> 01:10:47,681
- No, I won't!
- Go in there and sell that goddamn book!

1362
01:10:47,725 --> 01:10:49,091
No, I won't! My mom needs me!

1363
01:10:49,128 --> 01:10:50,529
I don't give a shit!

1364
01:10:50,565 --> 01:10:51,999
You're gonna go in there
and say something...

1365
01:10:52,034 --> 01:10:53,765
or I'm gonna shove
my arm up your ass...

1366
01:10:53,804 --> 01:10:55,067
and work you like a puppet!

1367
01:10:55,106 --> 01:10:56,096
Let go of me!

1368
01:10:58,112 --> 01:10:59,979
Fine! Run, you pussy!

1369
01:11:00,016 --> 01:11:02,111
- Go back to your mommy!
- What a bitch!

1370
01:11:02,154 --> 01:11:05,126
See if I care!

1371
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,356
Quiet, please!

1372
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:08,298
I don't know what to do!
I don't know what to do!

1373
01:11:09,769 --> 01:11:14,107
Ha ha ha. OK, John, take care.
He's helping people.

1374
01:11:48,881 --> 01:11:51,751
- You back for more?
- Look.

1375
01:11:51,787 --> 01:11:54,054
I screwed up, OK?

1376
01:11:54,092 --> 01:11:55,720
Big time.

1377
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:59,201
I shouldn't have meddled. L...

1378
01:11:59,235 --> 01:12:01,364
I'm... sorry.

1379
01:12:04,179 --> 01:12:05,875
Are you wearing make-up?

1380
01:12:06,951 --> 01:12:09,251
The truth is...

1381
01:12:09,289 --> 01:12:12,557
I did it because
I wanted my mom to be happy.

1382
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:15,294
And as it turns out, the thing
that makes my mom happy...

1383
01:12:15,334 --> 01:12:16,928
unbelievably...

1384
01:12:16,971 --> 01:12:19,168
is you.

1385
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:20,871
It's too late.

1386
01:12:20,912 --> 01:12:23,007
She's made her mind up, Farley.

1387
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:25,612
What? My mom's the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

1388
01:12:25,654 --> 01:12:28,057
One day you'll date girls
and you'll understand.

1389
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:30,825
Once a woman makes her mind up...

1390
01:12:30,866 --> 01:12:32,459
there's no changing it.

1391
01:12:32,502 --> 01:12:34,939
Oh, I get it. You're scared.

1392
01:12:34,974 --> 01:12:37,912
Your last marriage fell apart
because she was cheating on you.

1393
01:12:37,946 --> 01:12:41,441
Again and again and again.

1394
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:44,652
The woman's a deviant, Farley.
Who cares?

1395
01:12:44,692 --> 01:12:47,425
So you're scared
of getting hurt again?

1396
01:12:47,465 --> 01:12:49,731
Hey, spare me
the self-help crap, OK?

1397
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:51,899
You're not a guru.
You're a spoiled little kid...

1398
01:12:51,941 --> 01:12:55,107
who can't seem to let go
of his momma's right tit.

1399
01:12:55,147 --> 01:12:56,776
Oh, yeah?

1400
01:12:56,818 --> 01:12:58,947
Well, you're just
a pussy with a whistle!

1401
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:04,724
Really?

1402
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,599
You cocky little shit.

1403
01:13:06,636 --> 01:13:08,196
Do you actually think
you're tougher than me?

1404
01:13:09,108 --> 01:13:12,205
Oh. Any time, any place.

1405
01:13:20,197 --> 01:13:22,292
Get the rentals, Farley.

1406
01:13:34,425 --> 01:13:36,327
Seems like old times, doesn't it?

1407
01:13:36,363 --> 01:13:39,335
Yeah, well, a new day has come.

1408
01:13:39,369 --> 01:13:41,168
Ooh!

1409
01:13:41,206 --> 01:13:43,335
That was called a takedown, Farley.

1410
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:47,682
OK. So that's
how it's gonna be, huh?

1411
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,125
Ah!

1412
01:13:56,169 --> 01:13:58,036
Yep, now I'm gonna bring it,
Woodcock.

1413
01:13:58,073 --> 01:14:00,407
You never shut up, do you?

1414
01:14:00,444 --> 01:14:02,506
Why don't you make me?

1415
01:14:07,024 --> 01:14:09,392
Time to earn your wings, Farley.

1416
01:14:10,599 --> 01:14:12,535
It's called a suplex, Farley.

1417
01:14:12,569 --> 01:14:14,162
It's one of my favorites.

1418
01:14:14,205 --> 01:14:16,540
Here's another one of my favorites.

1419
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:19,207
The Vietcong shuffle.

1420
01:14:19,248 --> 01:14:22,049
The reverse Vietcong shuffle!

1421
01:14:22,088 --> 01:14:23,921
Here comes the thunder, Woodcock!

1422
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,950
Ooh!

1423
01:14:29,068 --> 01:14:31,197
Heads up, Farley.

1424
01:14:32,274 --> 01:14:34,507
- Say uncle!
- Pussy!

1425
01:14:34,546 --> 01:14:36,607
- Say it!
- Pussy!

1426
01:14:37,753 --> 01:14:38,778
Ow!

1427
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,791
Russian headlock!

1428
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:47,771
The gym teacher body slam!

1429
01:14:51,681 --> 01:14:53,115
Are you OK?

1430
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:55,519
Rhetorical question, Woodcock!

1431
01:15:04,072 --> 01:15:06,771
You remember me now, don't you?

1432
01:15:06,811 --> 01:15:08,508
- Bitch!
- Uh! Uh!

1433
01:15:16,664 --> 01:15:18,361
Mr. Woodcock?

1434
01:15:20,905 --> 01:15:22,374
Oh, shit.

1435
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:36,125
Got a white male, 50s,
possible concussion.

1436
01:15:37,239 --> 01:15:39,266
What are those? Bite marks?

1437
01:15:39,309 --> 01:15:40,641
Uh...

1438
01:15:42,382 --> 01:15:44,716
Come on, Scooter.
Get that mask off of me.

1439
01:15:44,753 --> 01:15:47,247
Oh, thank God.
I thought I'd killed you.

1440
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:50,458
You couldn't kill me with a shotgun
and a head start, Farley.

1441
01:15:50,498 --> 01:15:53,334
Said by the man flat on his back
in an ambulance.

1442
01:15:53,371 --> 01:15:58,439
Yeah, well, it's about time
you showed some backbone.

1443
01:15:58,481 --> 01:16:00,110
Is that a compliment?

1444
01:16:00,151 --> 01:16:01,312
Farley, I'm just saying...

1445
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:04,325
that you showed some sack
out there today, OK?

1446
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:05,850
Wow.

1447
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:09,027
Maybe there is a human being
hiding in there somewhere.

1448
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:11,973
I mean, seriously,
why can't you be nice to people?

1449
01:16:12,008 --> 01:16:15,640
Lt... it's not healthy being
such a dick all the time.

1450
01:16:15,682 --> 01:16:17,447
You're gonna end up like your dad...

1451
01:16:17,485 --> 01:16:20,355
just angry and bitter and alone.

1452
01:16:20,391 --> 01:16:23,158
If that's what you want, then
fine, but I don't think it is.

1453
01:16:23,197 --> 01:16:26,658
Now, right now, my mom is
on that float all by herself...

1454
01:16:26,704 --> 01:16:29,175
really wishing that you
were up there with her.

1455
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:31,702
The problem is...

1456
01:16:31,747 --> 01:16:35,312
I don't think you got
the backbone to win her back.

1457
01:16:35,355 --> 01:16:37,222
Oh, really?

1458
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,797
Watch out!

1459
01:16:44,473 --> 01:16:46,534
Come on, Farley!
Step up the pace!

1460
01:16:46,577 --> 01:16:48,444
I could if you weren't
such a fat ass!

1461
01:16:48,481 --> 01:16:50,576
Watch out! Excuse me!

1462
01:16:50,618 --> 01:16:52,144
- Keppen! You're off tempo!
- Aah!

1463
01:16:52,188 --> 01:16:54,385
- Watch out!
- You're flat, Mount-Gardner.

1464
01:16:54,426 --> 01:16:56,453
- Excuse us! Hey!
- Oh!

1465
01:16:56,497 --> 01:16:58,660
Excuse us!

1466
01:16:58,702 --> 01:16:59,795
Come on, Farley!

1467
01:16:59,837 --> 01:17:03,003
- Mom! Mom!
- Beverly! Beverly!

1468
01:17:03,044 --> 01:17:05,537
Oh, my God, what happened?

1469
01:17:05,581 --> 01:17:07,779
Jasper, why are you
on that gurney?

1470
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:11,452
I don't know, honey,
but I'm here to say that...

1471
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,190
I'm basically sorry.

1472
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:14,995
Basically sorry?

1473
01:17:15,034 --> 01:17:17,596
Mom, for an emotional cripple
like Woodcock...

1474
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,302
that's a huge step.

1475
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:22,144
Listen, I'm the one
who should be apologizing, OK?

1476
01:17:22,182 --> 01:17:23,674
This is all my fault.

1477
01:17:23,719 --> 01:17:25,621
Just give it another shot.

1478
01:17:25,656 --> 01:17:27,557
'Cause my lungs
are about to explode.

1479
01:17:27,593 --> 01:17:29,825
Please, honey.

1480
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:36,873
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

1481
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,107
Stop! Stop!

1482
01:17:41,487 --> 01:17:44,186
Mr. Woodcock!

1483
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:45,923
You OK?

1484
01:17:45,963 --> 01:17:47,956
Nice work, Farley.

1485
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,599
There's one pothole in this town
and you managed to find it.

1486
01:17:51,641 --> 01:17:53,873
Jasper! Oh, my God.

1487
01:17:53,912 --> 01:17:55,711
Oh, my God, Jasper.

1488
01:17:55,749 --> 01:17:57,810
Jasper.

1489
01:17:57,853 --> 01:17:59,846
Are you OK?

1490
01:18:04,032 --> 01:18:06,970
I'm sorry, Mom.

1491
01:18:07,005 --> 01:18:09,134
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

1492
01:18:09,176 --> 01:18:10,907
By killing him?

1493
01:18:10,946 --> 01:18:13,577
I called 911, didn't I?

1494
01:18:13,618 --> 01:18:16,454
Ha ha ha. Yes.

1495
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:19,291
For what it's worth,
I want you to be with Jasper.

1496
01:18:19,329 --> 01:18:22,461
- I don't believe you.
- I do. L...

1497
01:18:23,772 --> 01:18:26,437
If it means anything at all...

1498
01:18:26,478 --> 01:18:28,174
you have my blessing.

1499
01:18:34,927 --> 01:18:36,988
You can see Mr. Woodcock now.

1500
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:43,438
Listen, uh...

1501
01:18:45,582 --> 01:18:48,816
I just want to say I'm... I'm sorry...

1502
01:18:48,855 --> 01:18:52,055
About the "nailing your mother"
comment there.

1503
01:18:57,606 --> 01:18:58,938
That's it?

1504
01:18:59,977 --> 01:19:00,967
What do you mean?

1505
01:19:01,013 --> 01:19:02,812
I thought you would apologize for...

1506
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:04,683
Mom, Mom.

1507
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:08,922
I know this is gonna be hard for
you to believe, coming from me.

1508
01:19:08,962 --> 01:19:11,900
But Jasper is a good person.

1509
01:19:11,935 --> 01:19:14,429
You see, somewhere around the
time Jasper was choking me...

1510
01:19:14,473 --> 01:19:17,069
- Yeah, with your own foot.
- Right.

1511
01:19:17,112 --> 01:19:20,015
I had a revelation.

1512
01:19:20,051 --> 01:19:22,113
You don't get past your past.

1513
01:19:22,156 --> 01:19:24,422
You embrace it.

1514
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,396
And I'm not that fat little loser anymore...

1515
01:19:26,431 --> 01:19:27,956
and that's because he pushed me.

1516
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,237
And, in a really weird way...

1517
01:19:32,276 --> 01:19:34,405
he's a big part of who I am today.

1518
01:19:37,353 --> 01:19:40,757
For Christ's sakes, it was just
a P.E. Class, you fruitcake.

1519
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:42,989
- Jasper!
- Well, it was.

1520
01:19:46,004 --> 01:19:47,165
See?

1521
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:50,207
Set of ten, Farley.

1522
01:19:50,245 --> 01:19:52,272
- What?
- Just joking.

1523
01:19:56,524 --> 01:20:00,328
* I see a bad moon rising *

1524
01:20:01,701 --> 01:20:05,163
* I see trouble on the way *

1525
01:20:07,246 --> 01:20:10,844
* I see earthquakes and lightning *

1526
01:20:12,619 --> 01:20:15,318
Merry Christmas, Woodcock.

1527
01:20:15,358 --> 01:20:17,351
Merry Christmas, Farley.

1528
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,800
I read your book.

1529
01:20:21,839 --> 01:20:24,207
Really? What did you think?

1530
01:20:24,243 --> 01:20:26,874
Well, that part about, uh,
treating others...

1531
01:20:26,915 --> 01:20:28,885
how you want to be treated,
I guess that's all right.

1532
01:20:28,919 --> 01:20:32,255
Yeah, I sort of stole that
from the Bible, but...

1533
01:20:32,292 --> 01:20:34,194
l'll take credit for it.

1534
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:37,031
The rest of it's pretty much crap.

1535
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:40,037
What the hell, man?
That's my book!

1536
01:20:40,075 --> 01:20:41,634
Lt's my book, Farley.

1537
01:20:41,677 --> 01:20:44,376
You gave it to me.
I can do with it as I please.

1538
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:47,856
* I hear the voice
of rage and ruin *

1539
01:20:49,995 --> 01:20:52,261
* Don't go around tonight *

1540
01:20:52,299 --> 01:20:55,396
* Well, it's bound to
take your life *

1541
01:20:55,438 --> 01:20:58,501
Oh, hey. Look, your new book.

1542
01:20:58,545 --> 01:21:00,447
- Congrats, John.
- Let me see.

1543
01:21:00,482 --> 01:21:03,113
- Congratulations.
- Oh, my gosh. Look at that.

1544
01:21:04,056 --> 01:21:05,923
Oh, wow.

1545
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,258
Yeah, it's
really, really good, John.

1546
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:09,232
Wow, you read it?

1547
01:21:09,266 --> 01:21:11,202
Don't make me lie on Christmas.

1548
01:21:11,237 --> 01:21:12,968
Well, as long as we're
congratulating people...

1549
01:21:13,007 --> 01:21:14,772
Beverly and I have
a little announcement.

1550
01:21:14,811 --> 01:21:17,509
Recently, uh, one of my swimmers
took hold...

1551
01:21:17,549 --> 01:21:18,539
Mm!

1552
01:21:18,586 --> 01:21:21,022
And, uh, your mother's got
a little Woodcock in her.

1553
01:21:23,127 --> 01:21:24,152
What?

1554
01:21:24,196 --> 01:21:26,325
You're gonna be
a big brother, Farley.

1555
01:21:27,737 --> 01:21:29,365
Just joking.

1556
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:40,223
