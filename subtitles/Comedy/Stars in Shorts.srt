My Love From The Star

2
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:16,573
First love?

3
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:21,443
I almost got into a big
accident when I was young.

4
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:24,313
There was someone who saved me.

5
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:25,513
<i>Twelve years ago.</i>

6
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:28,053
<i>The person who saved you was me.</i>

7
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:31,193
<i>Do Min Joon!
What did you do to me?</i>

8
00:00:32,253 --> 00:00:34,923
<i>You did something to me, didn't you?</i>

9
00:00:35,723 --> 00:00:37,123
You did!<i></i>

10
00:00:37,123 --> 00:00:39,993
<i>Why else would I be acting like this?</i>

11
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:42,933
<i>The reason I saved you was...</i>

12
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:44,533
<i>because you looked like
the girl from 400 years ago.</i>

13
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:48,003
<i>The owner of this hair pin.</i>

14
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:53,013
Then you lived 400 years or what?

15
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:54,273
That's right.

16
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:58,013
I came here from an outside world
400 years ago.

17
00:00:58,013 --> 00:01:00,483
I could not return to my planet.

18
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:02,153
I had to live here for 400 years.

19

<i>[Gangwon Provincial Office]</i>

22
00:02:57,532 --> 00:03:01,297
You want me to report
this to the King?

23
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:04,543
Your Excellency! This is a bad omen.

24
00:03:04,543 --> 00:03:07,613
People are concerned.

25
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:10,483
Scandals cover scandals.

26
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:14,683
Speaking of which...

27
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:17,083
Do we have anything?

28
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:22,963
There's an interesting story
within my jurisdiction.

29
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,763
Why does Mother want me to
read books about Chaste Widows?

30
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:31,903
Does she want me to die after
my husband or what?

31
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,103
Why should I?

32
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:34,843
I'm only fifteen!

33
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:37,503
Being a widow already
is unfair enough.

34
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:49,983
<i>The daughter of Seo family
who became a widow at fifteen</i>

35
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:58,356
<i>recently committed suicide. And her
 in-laws applied for the Chastity Widow Award.</i>

36
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:44,443
<i>We will have the cremation tonight.</i>

37
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:47,113
<i>Find her and get rid of her.</i>

38
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:49,783
We have already applied for
the Chastity Widow Award.

39
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:54,183
We can't let anyone see her alive.

40
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:55,453
Yes, My Lady.

41
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:09,603
<i>Leave with me.</i>

42
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:16,673
I will protect you.

43
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:17,873
Come with me.

44
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:19,343
<i>My Lord!</i>

45
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:20,743
Miss is back.

46
00:05:20,743 --> 00:05:24,083
She's back alive!

47
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:28,856
You've saved my daughter's life.
I'm indebted to you.<i></i>

48
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:32,293
I can't express my gratitude enough.

49
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:38,693
Go somewhere.
And live as if you're dead.

50
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,363
Mother!

51
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:45,903
So why bring a man we can't even identify?

52
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:47,433
Mother!

53
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:48,973
What about him?

54
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,643
What happened to him?

55
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:55,313
<i>Is he still not dead?
What happened?</i>

56
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,043
<i>He ate the arsenic-laced food.</i>

57
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:00,383
<i>It should've been potent
 enough to kill an ox.</i>

58
00:06:00,383 --> 00:06:01,983
<i>But I don't know how he's still alive.</i>

59
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:06,053
Officer Choi!

60
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:11,859
Search Seo's family and capture
that fake chaste widow!

61
00:06:19,073 --> 00:06:22,203
Honey, did she run away all right?

62
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:24,403
She went to the man she came with.

63
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:29,058
<i>She said that she couldn't let her
life saver die like that.</i>

64
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:33,213
Sir! Your face is becoming more pale.

65
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:36,153
<i>Get them!</i>

66
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:47,833
<i>Come here.</i>

67
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:05,653
My late grandmother told me

68
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:10,253
that I should always say the
farewell before the time comes.

69
00:07:13,193 --> 00:07:16,463
Because when the time really comes...

70
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:22,063
I won't have time to say good bye.

71
00:07:22,063 --> 00:07:28,543
Thank you, and thank you again.

72
00:07:28,543 --> 00:07:33,613
I will not forget.
I will not be able to forget.

73
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:40,483
Even after death, no matter where I'll be,
I will not forget your death.

74
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:44,823
I will not forget you, sir.

75
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:50,163
Get them!
Over there!

76
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:53,763
Surround them!

77
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:00,033
Arrest them alive.

78
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:14,453
He's using dark arts!

79
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,383
Shoot them!

80
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:17,053
Kill them!

81
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:51,283
<i>There are moments I want to stop forever...</i>

82
00:08:51,283 --> 00:08:55,493
<i>Such as the moment of death
of my loved one.</i>

83
00:09:09,703 --> 00:09:14,243
<i>I didn't want to see it or believe it.</i>

84
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:17,443
<i>I couldn't do anything.</i>

85
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:22,453
<i>A moment where
I felt completely helpless...</i>

86
00:09:57,153 --> 00:10:02,893
<i>That was the first death
I had witnessed on Earth.</i>

87
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:12,703
<i>Do you know why people fear death?</i>

88
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:14,833
Because they will be forgotten.

89
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:21,870
It's because the world will not
change after they are gone.

90
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,843
And they will eventually be forgotten.

91
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:27,783
I was not afraid.

92
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:31,826
Even if I left this world and
went to a different world...

93
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:35,463
Even if no one remembered me...

94
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:37,723
I did not care.

95
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:39,133
But right now

96
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:45,273
I am afraid a little.

97
00:10:45,273 --> 00:10:50,073
There is someone whom I don't
want to be forgotten by.

98
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:53,813
<i>Cheon Song Yi!</i>

99
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:55,483
<i>Cheon Song Yi!</i>

100
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:08,423
Hello!

101
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:13,563
That kid!

102
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:14,693
What's he doing there?

103
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:15,963
Do you know him?

104
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:17,903
Yeah, I do.

105
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:19,903
He lives next door.

106
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:21,791
Really? That's good.

107
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:25,513
This isn't a drama class.
It's really hard for you.

108
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:28,843
You already received an F
and you needed to re-take it.

109
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:30,183
What?

110
00:11:30,183 --> 00:11:33,253
You didn't do anything
to offend him, did you?

111
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:37,410
You couldn't have had time.
You moved in yesterday.

112
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,723
I had time.

113
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:40,653
No! I'm going home alone!

114
00:11:40,653 --> 00:11:42,593
<i>Can we let her go home alone?</i>

115
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:45,733
<i>She met a pervert the last time
she got into an elevator alone.</i>

116
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,263
<i>It got really messy.</i>

117
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:50,663
Don't you remember that the pervert
was hospitalized for eight weeks?

118
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:53,473
She beat the hell out of him with
the metal studs on her bag.

119
00:11:53,473 --> 00:11:55,133
He was messed up.

120
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:59,273
Yeah I'm Cheon Song Yi.

121
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:00,943
How long have you been following me?

122
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:05,283
I see that you're young
and full of energy.

123
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:06,483
I see that.

124
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:08,013
Go study.

125
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:10,883
Or exercise and release that energy.

126
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:13,493
If you followed me here to
do something perverted...

127
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:15,363
Then you picked the wrong person!

128
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:18,763
This isn't the first time this
happened to me.

129
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:21,633
That pervert!

130
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:22,816
Hey!

131
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:27,057
Are you going to my place?
Where do you think you're...

132
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,573
You're going to the apartment next door.

133
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:33,573
You live there?

134
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:38,513
Don't you know me?

135
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:40,684
Don't you?
Me?

136
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:42,183
Do I have to?

137
00:12:42,183 --> 00:12:45,183
No, you don't have to.

138
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:53,933
I've waited 15 years.

139
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:56,333
Isn't that long enough?

140
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,073
Sorry.

141
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:08,683
What's the reason?

142
00:13:08,683 --> 00:13:13,153
Why not me?

143
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:16,553
Do you remember his face?

144
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:18,353
Who?

145
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:22,893
Song Yi!
<i>[12 years ago]</i>

146
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:24,023
Cheon Song Yi!
<i>[12 years ago]</i>

147
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:27,934
Stop following me! Leave me alone.

148
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:43,583
She had the same face as
the girl from 400 years ago?

149
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,848
Yes.

150
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:26,553
He's Song Yi's first love.

151
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:29,963
I wouldn't go that far.

152
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:34,668
But I want to see him again.

153
00:14:34,668 --> 00:14:37,903
To thank him for saving me.

154
00:14:37,903 --> 00:14:39,903
And ask him why he saved me.

155
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:41,833
Ms. Cheon Song Yi?

156
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:46,238
Perhaps you haven't read the syllabus
because you didn't come.

157
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:50,435
You can't plagiarize or cut-and-paste
for the papers in my class.

158
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:52,754
But it seems you did all of that.

159
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:55,453
So you will receive a zero for this paper.

160
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:59,453
Can you be eating ramen?

161
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:01,323
Don't you have to shoot tomorrow?

162
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:04,863
Asshole.

163
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:13,333
<i>Wrong pass code.</i>

164
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,543
Why?

165
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:19,241
- You have been blocked.
- Blocked?

166
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:21,738
You'd dare?

167
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:36,023
Open sesame!

168
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:41,033
Hul! It really opened!

169
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:45,103
Of course it did,
because I opened it.

170
00:15:47,503 --> 00:15:51,573
Did you like giving me a zero
and embarrassing me?

171
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:52,760
Did you?

172
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,043
I bet that you will bleed, blue blood.

173
00:15:58,043 --> 00:16:01,583
You wouldn't even spit
gum in a beggar's hand.

174
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,311
Excuse me, Cheon Song Yi.

175
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:04,783
Shut up!

176
00:16:06,123 --> 00:16:07,193
Where are you going?

177
00:16:07,193 --> 00:16:09,123
What's wrong with her?

178
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:12,393
Why sleep at her neighbor's?

179
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:13,593
Cheon Song Yi!

180
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:16,603
Do you know that you're sleeping
in a stranger's place?

181
00:16:18,663 --> 00:16:21,203
Wake up!

182
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:25,143
Watch out.

183
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:38,283
Hi Yoo Ra.

184
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:39,953
Hey!

185
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:12,523
Where is Cheon Song Yi?

186
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:13,923
<i>Why are you asking?</i>

187
00:17:13,923 --> 00:17:15,523
<i>Where is she?</i>

188
00:17:20,263 --> 00:17:21,793
You little!

189
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:30,403
What?

190
00:17:30,403 --> 00:17:31,873
How did you come here?

191
00:17:31,873 --> 00:17:33,413
Let's go out.

192
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:35,413
Where do you think you're going?

193
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:39,394
Look! Can't you see that
I'm talking to her?

194
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:42,553
Don't get in the way
and get lost!

195
00:17:56,103 --> 00:17:57,763
Who is she?

196
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:00,773
Why look at someone else's
picture without asking?

197
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:02,643
Who is she?

198
00:18:02,643 --> 00:18:05,043
Do I have to answer that?

199
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,113
What are you doing?

200
00:18:10,113 --> 00:18:11,913
Are you out of your mind?

201
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:18,183
Who are you?

202
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,203
<i>My belly...</i>

203
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:37,473
<i>Aww my belly...</i>

204
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,483
Excuse me.

205
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:51,153
I'm sorry, but where are you going?

206
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:52,623
Me?

207
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:55,623
Just... Songin University Hospital.

208
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:57,623
At two in the morning?

209
00:18:57,623 --> 00:18:59,213
I have business to attend to.

210
00:19:01,693 --> 00:19:04,903
She seems to have nausea and vomiting.

211
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:07,033
Also fever.

212
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:09,973
Sharp pain when probing
in the lower abdomen.

213
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:12,843
And the pain worsens when
the probing hand leaves.

214
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:15,373
I suspect appendicitis.

215
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:18,783
By the way, who are you?

216
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:19,812
Pardon?

217
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:23,123
How are you two related?

218
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:26,523
He's my manager.

219
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:27,644
My manager.

220
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:28,853
Me?

221
00:19:29,723 --> 00:19:31,523
No way.

222
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:36,863
How am I your manager?

223
00:19:36,863 --> 00:19:39,273
I'm an actress.

224
00:19:39,273 --> 00:19:42,673
If people hear about me coming to
the ER with a man...

225
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:47,337
There will be scandals of me being pregnant
 or that I tried to commit suicide.

226
00:19:47,473 --> 00:19:49,683
And you made me your manager?

227
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:51,413
You said that you would be my manager.

228
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:53,596
- Since when?
- Cheon Song Yi's Manager?

229
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:56,413
Yes?

230
00:19:59,953 --> 00:20:02,091
- So what are you going to do?
- About what?

231
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:03,478
<i>Her shoes.</i>

232
00:20:03,478 --> 00:20:05,623
<i>You said that you saw them in your vision.</i>

233
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:10,633
If you had foreseen like you did
twelve years ago...

234
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,973
Then the owner of the shoes may die.

235
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:15,433
Hey! What are you looking at?

236
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:18,973
Those shoes.
Are they yours?

237
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:20,443
Of course they are.

238
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:21,973
You thought they were sponsored?

239
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:27,313
Look here please.

240
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:27,983
Look here.

241
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:29,523
Smile!

242
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:30,583
Hi!

243
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:32,393
Oh!

244
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:36,393
Congratulations Seo Young!

245
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:47,473
You even copy my shoes now?

246
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,203
I didn't copy you.

247
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:52,003
I was the first to get them in Korea...

248
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:54,013
Why do you have to always fight?

249
00:20:54,013 --> 00:20:56,883
Just stand by my side.
Let's take a picture.

250
00:20:57,813 --> 00:20:59,953
Okay that's good.

251
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:12,023
What are you doing?

252
00:21:12,023 --> 00:21:14,433
Take it, now.

253
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:17,633
Damn it, I blinked.

254
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,773
Take one more, please.

255
00:21:48,863 --> 00:21:52,403
Oh yeah, where's your best friend?

256
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:54,333
She went to drink.

257
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,673
Again?

258
00:22:12,893 --> 00:22:14,753
Song Yi! It's dangerous.

259
00:22:39,853 --> 00:22:41,783
Careful.

260
00:22:41,783 --> 00:22:43,183
Are you okay?

261
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:45,723
Yeah, I'm okay.

262
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:53,333
Where did Song Yi go?

263
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,928
You said that she went to get a drink.

264
00:22:54,928 --> 00:22:58,463
She was there just now.

265
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:37,373
Crazy.

266
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:39,043
Cheon Song Yi, I...

267
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,513
Shhh...

268
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:47,913
It's rude to talk in
someone else's dream.

269
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:56,923
I'm cold.

270
00:24:00,863 --> 00:24:02,733
I'm cold.

271
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:21,753
<i>The body found in the river was
identified as Han Yoo Ra.</i>

272
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:23,753
<i>It's a shocking story.</i>

273
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,623
<i>The sudden death of a movie star</i>

274
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:29,093
<i>has shocked many.</i>

275
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:35,391
<i>Some find the reason of her death
as due to a fight with her colleague.</i>

276
00:24:45,973 --> 00:24:49,043
<i>Han Yoo Ra was found.</i>

277
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:50,583
Dead?

278
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:51,843
<i>Yes.</i>

279
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:54,383
How?

280
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:55,783
An accident?

281
00:24:55,783 --> 00:24:57,253
What happened?

282
00:24:57,253 --> 00:24:58,853
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

283
00:24:58,853 --> 00:25:00,723
<i>But we're dying.</i>

284
00:25:00,723 --> 00:25:01,993
Why?

285
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:05,776
<i>You have to leave now. The reporters
are going upstairs. You have to hurry.</i>

286
00:25:07,463 --> 00:25:09,133
<i>Get on the elevator!</i>

287
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,333
I'm on my way!

288
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,603
<i>No! Not the elevator.</i>

289
00:25:12,603 --> 00:25:14,003
No? Why not?

290
00:25:14,003 --> 00:25:15,733
<i>The reporters got on the elevator.</i>

291
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,873
- Emergency stairs!
- Emergency stairs?

292
00:25:18,673 --> 00:25:19,673
<i>No!</i>

293
00:25:19,673 --> 00:25:21,013
No? No?

294
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:22,213
Why not?

295
00:25:22,213 --> 00:25:24,143
Some walked up that way.

296
00:25:26,683 --> 00:25:29,410
Wait! Wait, wait!

297
00:25:31,953 --> 00:25:34,023
Over here.

298
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:38,423
<i>Cheon Song Yi!</i>

299
00:25:38,423 --> 00:25:40,033
<i>Just a few questions.</i>

300
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,833
Can you step out for a sec?

301
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,077
Have you heard?

302
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:45,349
Han Yoo Ra suffered from depression
because of Cheon Song Yi.

303
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:46,700
That's why she committed suicide.

304
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,373
I heard that she gave her a hard time.

305
00:25:48,373 --> 00:25:49,617
Really?

306
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:51,020
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

307
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,573
<i>Your last drama ended with
a 4% tune in rate.</i>

308
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:56,183
<i>That's the one I turned down.</i>

309
00:25:56,183 --> 00:25:57,843
Look at her talking.

310
00:25:57,843 --> 00:26:00,976
She's so mean.

311
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:04,583
Her family doesn't want an autopsy.

312
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:07,453
The police are assuming that it's a suicide.

313
00:26:07,453 --> 00:26:09,393
That's how the media portrays it too.

314
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:12,523
It's likely that the case
is going to be closed.

315
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:25,403
You're not drunk.
It's paralysis.

316
00:26:25,403 --> 00:26:31,013
You will just be another celebrity
who has committed suicide.

317
00:26:49,163 --> 00:26:51,503
However...

318
00:26:51,503 --> 00:26:56,872
We found videos and recordings of her
phone calls with you on her laptop.

319
00:26:57,573 --> 00:26:59,243
We took care of the laptop.

320
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,513
But there was a trace of her making a copy.

321
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:02,713
Where's the copy?

322
00:27:02,713 --> 00:27:04,783
I checked the black box on her car.

323
00:27:04,783 --> 00:27:06,583
She left her USB in her clutch bag.

324
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:15,653
It was Cheon Song Yi.

325
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:28,403
Good morning!

326
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:33,213
It was just...
having a person sleeping here.

327
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:35,343
And yet you've managed to change my place.

328
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:36,498
Right?

329
00:27:36,498 --> 00:27:38,886
Having a girl makes a
difference in the air right?

330
00:27:38,886 --> 00:27:41,553
It even looks brighter in a sense right?

331
00:27:44,823 --> 00:27:46,753
I'll kill you!

332
00:27:46,753 --> 00:27:49,293
Huh? Bring it on.

333
00:28:05,773 --> 00:28:07,443
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

334
00:28:07,443 --> 00:28:09,583
It's not what you think.

335
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:12,513
I just wanted to make sure.

336
00:28:12,513 --> 00:28:15,783
To see if there's really a connection
between Yi Hwa and her.

337
00:28:15,783 --> 00:28:17,923
Or if they just look alike.

338
00:28:17,923 --> 00:28:21,653
It's nothing more or less.

339
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:24,063
Fake eyelashes.

340
00:28:34,232 --> 00:28:36,012
<i>[Happy birthday! Cheer up.
Your fan.]</i>

341
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:49,013
Do Min Joon!

342
00:28:49,013 --> 00:28:51,353
Do Min Joon! Are you in there?

343
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,773
He's not there when I really need him.

344
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:09,903
Where did you go?

345
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:13,513
<i>Get a cell phone.</i>

346
00:29:13,513 --> 00:29:15,913
<i>I couldn't call you when I needed you.</i>

347
00:29:25,323 --> 00:29:27,193
<i>Final exam at four.</i>

348
00:29:27,193 --> 00:29:28,393
<i>Mandatory.</i>

349
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:30,593
<i>F for no shows.</i>

350
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:37,733
Vroongy!
Let's go for a ride.

351
00:29:55,483 --> 00:29:58,153
Ouch! Who the heck?

352
00:29:58,153 --> 00:30:02,423
Oh no! Oh my God.

353
00:30:03,293 --> 00:30:05,693
<i>I'm at Cheon Song Yi's place.</i>

354
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:14,233
I'm sorry! I rear-ended you.

355
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:15,903
Can you come out?

356
00:30:15,903 --> 00:30:18,043
It's fine! Just leave!

357
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:20,373
<i>You need to check your car.</i>

358
00:30:20,373 --> 00:30:23,843
<i>Cheon Song Yi!</i>

359
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:25,783
<i>Can I have an interview?</i>

360
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:29,183
<i>Cheon Song Yi! Your face please.</i>

361
00:30:29,183 --> 00:30:30,853
<i>Show us!</i>

362
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:44,333
This was not a car accident.
It was on purpose.

363
00:30:45,463 --> 00:30:47,603
You knew that a person was in there.

364
00:30:47,603 --> 00:30:50,273
You also knew that she could get hurt.

365
00:30:50,273 --> 00:30:52,543
And you purposely made the collision.

366
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:56,273
Hence, it falls under willful
 negligence destruction.

367
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:58,543
Who are you?

368
00:30:58,543 --> 00:31:02,353
I'm her legal representative.

369
00:31:02,353 --> 00:31:05,153
I'm also the witness.

370
00:31:07,353 --> 00:31:10,823
If the person in the car is hurt...

371
00:31:10,823 --> 00:31:13,293
I could also charge you with
assault battery.

372
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:17,033
If you yell at someone to get out of
 the car, when she doesn't want to...

373
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:18,633
Or do any threatening gesture...

374
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:22,503
It falls under Section 283 of
Criminal Law under threatening.

375
00:31:22,503 --> 00:31:26,443
For cases like this, you will
be arrested as a flagrant offender.

376
00:31:26,443 --> 00:31:29,513
Should I call the police?

377
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,453
You may take pictures.

378
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:38,723
But if you distribute them
without consent

379
00:31:38,723 --> 00:31:41,993
you will be subject to a lawsuit.

380
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,803
Come out.
It's okay.

381
00:31:58,273 --> 00:32:00,273
Only hide when you have something to hide.

382
00:32:00,273 --> 00:32:02,613
Don't just hide.

383
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,153
Where have you been, Manager Do?

384
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:15,823
Let's go.
Manager Do.

385
00:32:19,223 --> 00:32:20,833
Hey! Take it.

386
00:32:21,493 --> 00:32:23,363
Huh?

387
00:32:23,363 --> 00:32:24,503
It's not working.

388
00:32:24,503 --> 00:32:25,763
<i>Is it broken?</i>

389
00:32:25,763 --> 00:32:27,614
<i>Is it out of batteries? What's wrong?</i>

390
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,703
<i>What's wrong with it?</i>

391
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:38,153
<i>[Hurry]</i>

392
00:32:39,243 --> 00:32:40,653
<i>Yeah, it's Cheon Song Yi.</i>

393
00:32:40,653 --> 00:32:42,983
What kind of manager leaves
without telling me?

394
00:32:42,983 --> 00:32:44,453
Where did you go?

395
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:45,453
Call me.

396
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:47,779
You wanted to have a meeting.
What's our business?

397
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:51,323
What do you want to eat for dinner tonight?

398
00:32:51,323 --> 00:32:56,533
For your information,
I like sea cucumbers.

399
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:59,463
I want to eat them before winter passes.

400
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:01,933
What kind of a manager
leaves so frequently?

401
00:33:01,933 --> 00:33:03,873
You should've told me.

402
00:33:03,873 --> 00:33:05,743
Is something wrong?

403
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:08,813
Of course!

404
00:33:08,813 --> 00:33:11,143
Aren't we going to have a
meeting about our lunch?

405
00:33:11,143 --> 00:33:13,083
I want some pot udon.

406
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,153
Gosh, bye!

407
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:19,083
But I'm hungry.

408
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:23,493
Song Yi!

409
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:26,330
What? Why aren't you with Se Mi?

410
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:27,563
This.

411
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:29,963
You left it in your car last time.

412
00:33:29,963 --> 00:33:31,433
Oh yeah.

413
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:34,703
You can have it all after I'm gone.

414
00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:39,703
So clumsy.

415
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:43,243
I can't just throw it away.

416
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:45,313
But I can't keep it either.

417
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:56,453
What is this?

418
00:33:57,063 --> 00:34:02,716
We found videos and recordings of her
phone calls with you on her laptop.

419
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:04,803
I took care of the laptop.

420
00:34:04,803 --> 00:34:06,533
But there was a trace of her making a copy.

421
00:34:14,143 --> 00:34:17,343
<i>Get me out of here.</i>

422
00:34:17,343 --> 00:34:19,613
<i>I'm not crazy.</i>

423
00:34:19,613 --> 00:34:22,083
<i>I think I'm really going to go crazy.</i>

424
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:29,023
<i>Tell me.</i>

425
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:31,093
<i>Why did you end up here?</i>

426
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:34,633
<i>- You need to get away from him.</i>
- Who is that other girl?

427
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:38,233
<i>He could kill you too.</i>

428
00:34:50,113 --> 00:34:52,140
Where did you get it? It's good.

429
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:57,383
Hello?

430
00:34:57,383 --> 00:35:00,653
Oh! It's out already?

431
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:01,853
Today?

432
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:04,593
Manager Do! We have a schedule!

433
00:35:04,593 --> 00:35:06,993
- What is it?
- My tailoring is done!

434
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:09,663
What am I going to wear?

435
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:13,533
What's that?

436
00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:14,533
Oh that?

437
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:17,273
A present from an anonymous fan.

438
00:35:17,273 --> 00:35:18,673
Isn't it cute?

439
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:51,303
<i>What are you doing?</i>

440
00:36:03,983 --> 00:36:05,583
What's that?

441
00:36:07,323 --> 00:36:09,993
Things have gotten inconvenient.

442
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,325
Start.

443
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:14,663
<i>Who was watching me?</i>

444
00:36:14,663 --> 00:36:19,919
<i>Does he hate me so much to
invest his own time and money?</i>

445
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:42,353
I'm Do Min Joon.

446
00:36:42,353 --> 00:36:44,423
Oh yes. You reported him right?

447
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:48,833
Is he the culprit?

448
00:36:58,173 --> 00:36:59,443
I'm administering your shot.

449
00:36:59,443 --> 00:37:01,313
Okay.

450
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:10,583
I admitted to everything.

451
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:12,983
Why wouldn't I admit to this one then?

452
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:16,393
That wasn't me!

453
00:37:16,993 --> 00:37:22,663
Then is there someone else?

454
00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:31,744
<i>[Manager Do]</i>

455
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:10,513
<i>Do Min Joon!</i>

456
00:38:10,513 --> 00:38:12,183
Help!

457
00:38:15,313 --> 00:38:17,053
Do Min Joon!

458
00:38:38,143 --> 00:38:39,743
Who's that?

459
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,743
What was that?

460
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:47,883
The master cylinder was taken out.

461
00:38:47,883 --> 00:38:50,223
It couldn't have stopped.

462
00:38:56,823 --> 00:38:57,823
Finish her.

463
00:38:57,823 --> 00:38:59,163
Yes sir.

464
00:39:00,493 --> 00:39:02,163
What?

465
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:08,103
When we woke up...

466
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:12,843
We were both on a highway
far away from that place.

467
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:15,313
When we got back there,
Cheon Song Yi was already gone.

468
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:17,913
Who was the man who came out of nowhere?

469
00:39:17,913 --> 00:39:20,383
I don't know.

470
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:23,383
I can't even make a guess.

471
00:39:35,193 --> 00:39:37,263
Is this what you want?

472
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:41,473
If I hand this over to you,
will you stop then?

473
00:39:41,473 --> 00:39:44,073
Yes, of course.

474
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:48,073
I will pay you back in return then.

475
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:49,873
Do you know what this is?

476
00:39:52,013 --> 00:39:54,683
It's a tranquilizer for animals.

477
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,553
It will put you to sleep.

478
00:39:57,553 --> 00:40:01,693
Your suicide will look more
natural than anything I've ever done.

479
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:06,823
You killed Han Yoo Ra and assaulted
the prosecutor on the case.

480
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:09,363
Then you couldn't handle the pressure.

481
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:11,363
You chose your death.

482
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:15,233
<i>I need to take care of you first.</i>

483
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:17,973
To get rid of Cheon Song Yi.

484
00:40:20,313 --> 00:40:21,843
Bye.

485
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:33,453
Listen well.

486
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:37,193
Stop right here. Don't do anything.

487
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:46,733
Come out! Come out!

488
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:16,433
Yeah Yoon Jae.

489
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:19,033
It's me.

490
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:20,433
Where?

491
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:21,633
I'm next door.

492
00:41:21,633 --> 00:41:23,773
Unit 2302.

493
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:26,243
Yeah, I'm at the front door.

494
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:28,313
I just opened the door...

495
00:41:37,723 --> 00:41:39,723
What happened?

496
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:42,053
I just called you.

497
00:41:42,053 --> 00:41:43,993
Are you okay?

498
00:41:51,663 --> 00:41:53,533
<i>Wake up!</i>

499
00:41:54,603 --> 00:41:56,133
Are you awake?

500
00:42:03,073 --> 00:42:04,343
Where am I?

501
00:42:04,343 --> 00:42:05,691
My room.

502
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:07,193
You slept for more than ten hours.

503
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:09,263
What happened last night?

504
00:42:11,553 --> 00:42:13,223
What if someone's in there?

505
00:42:13,223 --> 00:42:16,423
I will take care of it.
You just worry about yourself.

506
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,703
You said that it wasn't
unrequited love.

507
00:42:28,703 --> 00:42:29,773
It's not!

508
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:33,173
I didn't know that the
prosecutor was your brother.

509
00:42:33,173 --> 00:42:34,973
How is he?

510
00:42:34,973 --> 00:42:39,626
He received surgery for
traumatic subdural hemorrhage.

511
00:42:41,713 --> 00:42:45,183
Do Min Joon could hear me sing.

512
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:48,653
He could even hear me screaming.

513
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:51,923
The wall is perfectly sound-proof.
How did he do it?

514
00:43:00,003 --> 00:43:01,873
Leaving now?

515
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:03,250
Yeah.

516
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,338
See you later.

517
00:43:08,343 --> 00:43:10,683
Where are you going Do Min Joon?

518
00:43:10,683 --> 00:43:12,416
- Supermarket.
- Supermarket?

519
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:14,572
Good I need to go too.

520
00:43:15,883 --> 00:43:18,023
Like that?

521
00:43:18,023 --> 00:43:19,153
Oops.

522
00:43:19,153 --> 00:43:22,623
I'll just put a coat on.
Wait just a sec.

523
00:43:22,623 --> 00:43:24,311
Don't go.

524
00:43:32,163 --> 00:43:34,503
I told you to wait for me!

525
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:35,773
Let's shop together
and split it in half.

526
00:43:35,773 --> 00:43:37,033
I don't buy more than I need.

527
00:43:38,303 --> 00:43:39,943
- Potato?
- I don't like potatoes.

528
00:43:40,173 --> 00:43:42,243
Do you dip salt or sugar in potatoes?

529
00:43:42,243 --> 00:43:44,113
Why would I want to dip?

530
00:43:44,113 --> 00:43:46,829
What about chicken?
Do you like the legs or the breasts?

531
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:48,369
Breasts.

532
00:43:48,432 --> 00:43:50,783
We like the opposite stuff.

533
00:43:50,783 --> 00:43:54,193
We won't fight over food
our whole lives then.

534
00:43:58,923 --> 00:44:02,133
I won't eat anything with you
for my whole life.

535
00:44:18,213 --> 00:44:20,143
Where are you going?
Is it far?

536
00:44:20,343 --> 00:44:21,953
Can I come along?

537
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:22,974
No.

538
00:44:22,974 --> 00:44:25,269
I have something to tell you.

539
00:44:34,433 --> 00:44:38,233
Did you come all the way here because
you wanted to hear my answer?

540
00:44:39,503 --> 00:44:41,970
What do you think about me?
Wait!

541
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,049
Don't answer that! I will kill you!

542
00:44:45,243 --> 00:44:47,043
I'm not normally like this.

543
00:44:47,043 --> 00:44:49,173
Yeah, I admit that you were good to me.

544
00:44:49,173 --> 00:44:52,113
<i>But am I someone who can't
distinguish gratefulness and love?</i>

545
00:44:52,113 --> 00:44:53,315
<i>No.</i>

546
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,983
<i>But why do I have to think about you?</i>

547
00:44:55,983 --> 00:44:57,723
<i>I'm normally someone to be thought about.</i>

548
00:44:57,723 --> 00:45:04,219
<i>My airport fashion, my lipstick, my hair...
I'm always thought about by people.</i>

549
00:45:04,274 --> 00:45:08,256
<i>Should I think about you?
Your kiss...</i>

550
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:10,082
Have I lost my mind?

551
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,832
What do you think of me?

552
00:45:11,832 --> 00:45:14,481
Wait don't answer that! I will kill you!

553
00:45:15,473 --> 00:45:17,343
I don't like you.

554
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:23,413
And now I dislike you even more.

555
00:45:29,013 --> 00:45:31,223
What do you want me to do?

556
00:45:32,683 --> 00:45:37,023
I want you to get out of my sight.

557
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:44,963
But...

558
00:45:51,773 --> 00:45:54,373
Why do I feel like...

559
00:45:56,973 --> 00:45:59,913
you're lying?

560
00:46:50,233 --> 00:46:53,163
One-person management?

561
00:46:53,163 --> 00:46:55,703
Yes, Mrs. Yang.

562
00:46:55,703 --> 00:46:59,373
I feel bad about Song Yi's scandal.

563
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:04,513
I want to manage her career from now.

564
00:47:20,393 --> 00:47:23,333
<i>You were protecting
Cheon Song Yi too well. </i>

565
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,733
<i>So I found a different way.</i>

566
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:30,636
<i>So what will you do?
Choose.</i>

567
00:48:40,073 --> 00:48:42,013
You always said...

568
00:48:42,013 --> 00:48:46,083
on the night you almost
died twelve years ago...

569
00:48:46,083 --> 00:48:47,883
<i>The person who saved you.</i>

570
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:54,287
<i>If he came to you again,
you said that you'd recognize him.</i>

571
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:55,843
And?

572
00:48:55,843 --> 00:48:57,563
He's right next you.

573
00:48:57,563 --> 00:49:00,223
So why can't you recognize him?

574
00:49:00,223 --> 00:49:01,963
Next to me?

575
00:49:03,293 --> 00:49:04,903
<i>Where?</i>

576
00:49:06,103 --> 00:49:07,833
<i>Blood?</i>

577
00:49:12,373 --> 00:49:17,443
Do Min Joon?

578
00:49:23,313 --> 00:49:25,383
Do Min Joon?

579
00:49:48,143 --> 00:49:49,813
Do Min Joon?

580
00:49:49,813 --> 00:49:52,283
Do Min Joon? Wake up!

581
00:49:52,283 --> 00:49:54,213
Do Min Joon? What about me?

582
00:49:56,883 --> 00:50:00,353
<i>You shouldn't have gotten involved.</i>

583
00:50:00,353 --> 00:50:03,293
<i>Then you wouldn't have gotten hurt.</i>

584
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:05,623
<i>Min Joon is leaving soon.</i>

585
00:50:05,623 --> 00:50:07,893
In less than two months now.

586
00:50:07,893 --> 00:50:13,952
If you have feelings for him, I think
it's best that you stop for both your sakes.

587
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:23,043
<i>Think of it as it never happened
in the first place.</i>

588
00:50:23,573 --> 00:50:27,789
<i>I...</i>

589
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:30,459
<i>I...
like her.</i>

590
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:33,383
Two months are good.

591
00:50:33,383 --> 00:50:35,593
One month is enough.

592
00:50:38,663 --> 00:50:40,933
I just want to be with her.

593
00:50:43,663 --> 00:50:46,203
Is it really not going to work?

594
00:50:49,933 --> 00:50:52,073
Will it not work?

595
00:50:57,943 --> 00:50:59,543
This was unexpected.

596
00:51:00,413 --> 00:51:02,953
I didn't think that you'd call me first.

597
00:51:02,953 --> 00:51:05,023
I came to make a proposition.

598
00:51:06,353 --> 00:51:10,153
I will do what you want me to do.

599
00:51:11,493 --> 00:51:16,963
You want me to take the
blame and disappear right?

600
00:51:18,703 --> 00:51:20,633
I will do that.

601
00:51:21,503 --> 00:51:24,443
Then... will you stop here?

602
00:51:25,903 --> 00:51:28,643
<i>You said that you wanted
to ask something.</i>

603
00:51:28,643 --> 00:51:30,713
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

604
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,643
<i>Who you are...</i>

605
00:51:32,643 --> 00:51:34,983
<i>Or what happened...</i>

606
00:51:34,983 --> 00:51:37,383
<i>If there's something
you can't tell me now...</i>

607
00:51:38,523 --> 00:51:40,723
<i>It really doesn't matter.</i>

608
00:51:42,123 --> 00:51:45,193
I'm going to tell you what secret
lies behind the man

609
00:51:45,193 --> 00:51:47,663
you foolishly trust.

610
00:51:47,663 --> 00:51:49,193
That's why I wanted to see you.

611
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:57,412
Didn't you want to know who
saved you twelve years ago?

612
00:51:59,073 --> 00:52:04,013
The person that saved you was me.

613
00:52:05,483 --> 00:52:08,283
The reason I saved you was...

614
00:52:08,283 --> 00:52:14,023
because you looked like
a girl from 400 years ago.

615
00:52:15,493 --> 00:52:20,223
The owner of this hair pin.

616
00:52:23,563 --> 00:52:28,233
Do Min Joon, let's go home.

617
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:32,043
You're not well yet.

618
00:52:37,643 --> 00:52:41,313
<i>I came here from an outside
world 400 years ago. </i>

619
00:52:41,313 --> 00:52:43,583
<i>I could not return to my planet.</i>

620
00:52:43,583 --> 00:52:45,723
<i>I lived here on Earth for 400 years.</i>

621
00:52:45,723 --> 00:52:47,653
Don't you get it?

622
00:52:47,653 --> 00:52:53,523
I can hurt you right now if I want to.

623
00:52:54,193 --> 00:52:55,933
So...

624
00:52:58,333 --> 00:53:00,603
Leave while I let you.

625
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:04,543
Leave!

626
00:53:06,473 --> 00:53:08,743
<i>Then why did you do it?</i>

627
00:53:11,343 --> 00:53:14,953
<i>Why did you save me so many times?</i>

628
00:53:14,953 --> 00:53:17,093
<i>And do the things I wanted to do.</i>

629
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,823
<i>Doing everything for me.</i>

630
00:53:19,823 --> 00:53:21,623
Why did you protect me?

631
00:53:21,623 --> 00:53:23,753
Why?

632
00:53:23,753 --> 00:53:25,763
<i>Because you looked like her.</i>

633
00:53:25,763 --> 00:53:27,693
<i>I wanted to see if you
two were connected.</i>

634
00:53:27,693 --> 00:53:31,903
But that doesn't seem to be the case.

635
00:53:31,903 --> 00:53:35,573
If you are just Cheon Song Yi.

636
00:53:35,573 --> 00:53:37,433
Then I'm not interested.

637
00:53:40,443 --> 00:53:44,583
<i>You never liked me for one second?</i>

638
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,783
<i>Your heart never fluttered for me?</i>

639
00:53:46,783 --> 00:53:49,183
<i>You never worried about me sincerely?</i>

640
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:55,646
<i>You never liked me without having
to do anything with her?</i>

641
00:53:55,653 --> 00:53:59,063
No, never.

642
00:54:02,593 --> 00:54:04,663
I will give up then.

643
00:54:07,003 --> 00:54:09,133
Good idea.

644
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,501
- Are you shooting that today?
- Yeah.

645
00:54:36,501 --> 00:54:37,869
You should watch if you have time.

646
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:40,763
I'm going to make history in action films.

647
00:54:59,123 --> 00:55:00,653
<i>Hee Kyung!</i>

648
00:55:10,593 --> 00:55:12,733
Prosecutor!

649
00:55:12,733 --> 00:55:14,063
Look!

650
00:55:14,063 --> 00:55:16,873
Cheon Song Yi got into
an accident while filming.

651
00:55:19,803 --> 00:55:21,673
How did that happen?

652
00:55:21,673 --> 00:55:24,473
<i>I was talking!</i>

653
00:55:24,473 --> 00:55:25,213
<i>Do Min Joon!</i>

654
00:55:49,103 --> 00:55:52,573
What do you think I'm going to do?

655
00:56:01,713 --> 00:56:03,913
Die!

656
00:56:09,193 --> 00:56:14,263
I will show you what
total destruction is.

657
00:56:14,263 --> 00:56:17,352
- You dare.
- You dare!

658
00:56:17,352 --> 00:56:22,109
I will show you who exactly
you dared to infuriate.

659
00:56:36,213 --> 00:56:38,153
Wow! Did you see this?

660
00:56:38,153 --> 00:56:41,553
A man caught Song Yi from her fall.

661
00:56:41,553 --> 00:56:43,553
He's an heir to a corporation.

662
00:56:43,553 --> 00:56:44,621
<i>Dang!</i>

663
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:46,759
<i>He's got money and height?</i>

664
00:56:46,759 --> 00:56:48,376
<i>She's so lucky.</i>

665
00:56:48,763 --> 00:56:52,447
We know each other personally.
Three times is too much!

666
00:56:56,373 --> 00:56:58,443
My daughter is Cheon Song Yi.

667
00:56:58,443 --> 00:57:01,640
You dared to reject her?
Who do you think you are?

668
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,973
We're not sorry at all.

669
00:57:02,973 --> 00:57:05,643
Song Yi got a contract with S&C.

670
00:57:05,643 --> 00:57:07,583
She's going to get engaged with Hee Kyung.

671
00:57:10,053 --> 00:57:13,523
Is it because you heard
that she's getting engaged?

672
00:57:15,323 --> 00:57:17,323
Cheon Song Yi doesn't like him.

673
00:57:17,323 --> 00:57:20,323
He saved her life.

674
00:57:20,323 --> 00:57:23,193
She could change her mind.

675
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:25,803
Haven't I saved her?

676
00:57:25,803 --> 00:57:27,403
I've saved her more than once!

677
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:28,603
Why are you getting angry?

678
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:32,403
I'm not angry! You're
just not making any sense!

679
00:57:41,213 --> 00:57:42,683
<i>Wake up.</i>

680
00:57:51,293 --> 00:57:53,293
Stop.

681
00:57:53,293 --> 00:57:55,433
Stop it. Stop.

682
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:58,103
She says it tickles!

683
00:57:58,103 --> 00:57:59,903
She says to stop!

684
00:57:59,903 --> 00:58:01,433
She says to stop!

685
00:58:01,433 --> 00:58:02,833
Fried chicken and beer!

686
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:22,523
Get in.

687
00:58:22,523 --> 00:58:24,453
I said no!

688
00:58:24,453 --> 00:58:26,123
I will count to three.

689
00:58:26,123 --> 00:58:29,933
One, two, three, three and a half.

690
00:58:40,073 --> 00:58:42,944
Come here when you're done.
I will wait.

691
00:58:42,944 --> 00:58:45,873
No, Do Min Joon.
Don't wait.

692
00:58:47,613 --> 00:58:49,153
<i>Leave.</i>

693
00:58:50,753 --> 00:58:54,428
<i>- Cheon Song Yi, I...
- Do Min Joon.</i>

694
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:57,458
<i>We're nobodies to each other.</i>

695
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,958
<i>You said that you didn't like me.</i>

696
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:02,833
<i>Then act like it.</i>

697
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,503
Cut!

698
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:11,303
<i>Thank you! Thank you!</i>

699
00:59:21,243 --> 00:59:24,383
Did everyone just leave me?

700
00:59:24,383 --> 00:59:26,183
I'm Cheon Song Yi!

701
00:59:26,183 --> 00:59:28,453
It's unbelievable.

702
00:59:32,793 --> 00:59:34,263
I said leave.

703
00:59:34,263 --> 00:59:35,793
I said I'll wait.

704
00:59:35,793 --> 00:59:37,463
Why wait for me?

705
00:59:37,463 --> 00:59:41,822
Because I...

706
00:59:41,822 --> 00:59:44,090
I need to protect you.

707
00:59:44,379 --> 00:59:51,962
I want you to know how selfish you are.

708
01:00:27,722 --> 01:00:32,035
What are you doing?

709
01:00:32,035 --> 01:00:38,001
This is the most selfish thing
I can do to you.
