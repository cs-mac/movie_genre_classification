1
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,400
Planet Desire... I've dreamt of it

2
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,988
For you, tomorrow,
Get free access to riches

3
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,789
Who needs to save?

4
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,790
Warning: This movie has been paid
for by inserted Advertisements.

5
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:20,090
It doesn't change the world
but it contributes

6
00:01:50,090 --> 00:02:01,091
French Petrochemicals Products
" Welcome into the brave new world "

7
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,124
Everything can be bought

8
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,925
Love, Art, planet Earth

9
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:12,426
you, me

10
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:13,627
particularly me

11
00:02:21,627 --> 00:02:25,227
Man is a product, like other things,
with a sell by date

12
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:27,394
I'm a publicist

13
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:31,630
I'm a part of those who make you
dream of things you'll never have

14
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:32,631
sky always blue

15
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:33,631
wenches never dumpy

16
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:36,332
perfect photoshopped happiness

17
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,433
You believe I make the world prettier?

18
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:41,435
Wrong: I screw it up

19
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:46,835
Everything is temporary

20
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:50,651
Love, Art, planet Earth

21
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,383
You, me

22
00:02:53,518 --> 00:02:56,638
particulary me

23
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:21,039
That's it, it's done

24
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,740
The corner is turned

25
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:25,241
I can look back on my life

26
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:26,242
It's cool

27
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,230
For example I had completly
forgotten how much,

28
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:32,531
when very young,

29
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:34,932
I loved sophisticated pictures

30
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,933
- Arch your back!

31
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:45,934
Show me your butt!

32
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:49,636
- Octave, honey,
Dinner's ready!

33
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:54,036
- Yes mummy, I'm coming!

34
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:00,538
I've always been 'set apart'

35
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:03,938
I was really made for that job

36
00:04:57,454 --> 00:04:58,540
- Beat it

37
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,994
Fuck, it's shit!

38
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,396
I'm on a bad trip

39
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:03,196
Sorry Stephanie, you're alright?!

40
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,497
I didn't know you were here

41
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,799
It's not against you, sorry

42
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,400
You're alright? Wait...

43
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:12,392
I

44
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,815
To me, everything
had started so well...

45
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,896
the mood was good,
the dj excellent,

46
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:41,897
pleasant temperature,
superb girls,

47
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,898
alcohol a gogo,
drugs of quality...

48
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,001
Undeniably, my first 33 years
were really successful

49
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:55,401
But I won't disguise the truth

50
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:57,802
I'm not a nice boy

51
00:06:58,403 --> 00:06:59,503
- We're closing

52
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:01,304
I am a big shit

53
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,105
A modern hero

54
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,706
I find my trousers,
in the Italian Vogue

55
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:09,107
and in the German
Vanity Fair

56
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:11,208
a month before you can read them.

57
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:17,479
Concerning my shirts, they come
from New York, Tokio, Bombay, Guetary

58
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:22,747
I'm sorry to be so much
in advance of you, but...

59
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,949
I'm the one who decides today
what you'll want tomorrow

60
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,450
I drug you with novelty

61
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:29,250
and novelty's advantage, is that
it doesn't stay new for long

62
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:34,551
You should ideally hate me, before
hating the era that created me

63
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:39,553
So here it is, my name is
Octave Parengo

64
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:41,053
and my dresser is APC

65
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,989
I have spent my life manipulating you
for 75,000 F per month

66
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,989
When, by dint of savings, you'll
be able to buy your dream car,

67
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,791
I shall already have
made it old-fashionned

68
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,612
I always manage
to frustrate you

69
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,819
I penetrate your brain

70
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:07,828
I come in your right hemisphere

71
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:12,356
Your desires don't belong
to you anymore

72
00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:13,957
I impose mine on you

73
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:19,446
There has never been such a devious and
powerful cunt as me for 2,000 years

74
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:25,342
- Octave Parengo, 312 chamber

75
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,342
- I got that for you

76
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:27,843
- thank you...

77
00:08:28,844 --> 00:08:29,444
Sorry,

78
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:32,945
it's ugly

79
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:33,946
Popular

80
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,346
Here we are in "the Ross"-
Ross and Witchcraft

81
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:38,847
one of the biggest advertising
companies in the world

82
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:40,348
Median age: 28 years old

83
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,049
Sales: 1,430,000 F

84
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:45,973
My open ended job
is copywriter

85
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:48,780
I write 30 second
film scenarios

86
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:49,781
and slogans for posters

87
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:51,282
I say "slogan"
for you to understand

88
00:08:51,283 --> 00:08:52,683
but you should
know that we say

89
00:08:52,684 --> 00:08:54,084
"catcher" or "headline"

90
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:57,986
For example: Wonderbra

91
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,286
"Look at me in the eyes"

92
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:00,287
"I said in the eyes!"...

93
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:01,288
- Ave Octavus!

94
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:02,289
- Hi to the dorks!

95
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,891
...it comes from me

96
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:09,192
Arch your back!

97
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:22,450
Here new territory is being
explored regarding dry sausage

98
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:25,451
Stan, consolidate the "teen shower"
spirit and the 15/35 year olds.

99
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:29,851
Alexandra, try to optimize the
strategical approach of seniors' nappies

100
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:30,952
Funky...

101
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:38,961
Here is the accounting department,

102
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:40,562
and she is...

103
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:41,563
What is her name?

104
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:42,764
ohhh, nevermind...

105
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:49,685
Here is Marc Maronnier,
my creative director

106
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:51,686
After Philippe, the president,

107
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:53,888
he is the most important
man of the company

108
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,076
- Hi

109
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:57,076
- Hi, how are you?

110
00:09:57,077 --> 00:10:00,077
- I just spent the week-end
with my man

111
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:01,078
Four days in Cabourg

112
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm so happy!
- Oh yeah?!

113
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,581
- ... A charming little corner

114
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:07,582
so romantic,
we landed up there,

115
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,582
We dug it so much...

116
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,583
it was great,
I'm so peachy!

117
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:15,585
- you're fired, take your stuff
right now and beat it!

118
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:17,986
I am not joking

119
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:24,865
Marc is like that, for 10 years
he has taught me everything

120
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,066
Alright you stay,

121
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:28,066
And your out of date language

122
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:32,066
"We dug it, it was awesome,
we got a kick out of it"

123
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:34,068
Avoid that, when I'm plunged into a file

124
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:35,069
it's disgusting to me

125
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,070
And you spend this week-end here,
I want a balance for Tuesday

126
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:39,072
- Yes Mr Maronnier

127
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,273
- Ok, it's cool, you
can call me Marc

128
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:44,074
- He is a genius
- You're ok?

129
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,075
You're ready for this afternoon's
presentation for Madone?

130
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:48,776
- Yeah, we've got something
- I won't be there

131
00:10:48,777 --> 00:10:50,277
Jeff will be
- Wait, Jeff...

132
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:51,878
- that's the way it is!

133
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
I can rely on you?

134
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
- Yeah, so, I rely on myself...

135
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:02,643
- You adore me?!

136
00:11:04,244 --> 00:11:09,344
Creative is not such an easy job,
and that's also why we're so well-paid

137
00:11:09,345 --> 00:11:12,345
To shut us up.
You won't believe me, but

138
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:15,346
money is not the only reason
I chose that job

139
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,046
I was 17 and a half
when I had my first "ad-shock"

140
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,347
I knew it was what
I wanted to do

141
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:27,748
When I went to the ciné, the ads
were sometimes better than the film

142
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:30,548
Some of them were little
treasures of ingenuity

143
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:53,339
This day I decided
to become a publicist

144
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,940
and I succeeded

145
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,213
Here, on the 14th floor,
is my office

146
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:03,256
Near the radiator
it's Cuddly,

147
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:05,141
a blond hamster, picked up
on a filming shoot

148
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,275
and next to it,
this retarded teenager

149
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:11,322
He's my Charly

150
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:12,322
He's mine

151
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:13,323
He's my partner

152
00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:16,418
He is artistic director, my D.A.

153
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:17,419
or A.D., "Art Director"

154
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,536
as we say in the profession,
because it makes it more American

155
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:24,269
Hello Thierry, it's Charly,
Hello, sorry to disturb you,

156
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:27,339
I'm embarrassed with an email
I received, the one with the eel...

157
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,340
the moray eel... sorry

158
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:31,917
I can't tell if it's a guy or
a wench it's fucking with?

159
00:12:33,363 --> 00:12:34,595
I thought it was a guy...

160
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:35,596
It's bad...

161
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:38,853
Oh, you're working now...

162
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:41,671
As does every creative of every company
in the world, my Charly spend 89%

163
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:44,872
of his working time sharing
trash pictures via the internet

164
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:48,402
There, he's now coming out of a great
"Japanese vomit eater" period

165
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:52,095
- Charly...
- Yes, Octave?

166
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:57,153
- If I told you, I have the vague feeling
I'm going to blow a fuse inside myself

167
00:12:57,154 --> 00:12:58,808
what would you say?

168
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:00,741
- Wait, wait, are you telling
me this here?

169
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:01,742
- Yeah, I'm telling you here

170
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:04,841
- Ok then, tell me,
I am listening to you

171
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:08,490
- I simply have the vague feeling
I'm going to blow a fuse inside myself

172
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,446
Yeah, of course

173
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:12,477
- alright, I understand you completely,
I'd like to tell you many things

174
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:13,478
- So come on, come on...

175
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,785
- Did you snort, with someone else?

176
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:18,594
- No I would never do this to you

177
00:13:18,595 --> 00:13:19,595
- So this is me you...

178
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:23,591
you are provoking me!

179
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:26,173
- I said nothing, stop, stop

180
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,993
Oh yeah insult me in German

181
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:28,994
come on, punish me!

182
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:33,140
- Guys, we're waiting for you, on the stage,
for the shooting in Boulogne...

183
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:36,207
- Yeah, we're coming, we finish, we go...

184
00:13:58,928 --> 00:14:00,209
- A masterpiece!

185
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:06,575
- Someone told Steven it's
an ad for sauerkraut?

186
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:09,869
- Don't know, I really have my doubts...

187
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:18,016
- Please go and tell him!

188
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:19,933
- No you!
- No you!

189
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:23,850
you, it's better...
- What a bitch that guy is

190
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:29,272
- like that, yes. You detest me,
despise me with your mouth...

191
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,566
- Steve... Can I talk to you
just 2 seconds...

192
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:35,567
sorry

193
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:40,957
It's super good, super glamour,
super sensual...

194
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,677
but could you just give
me a square plan

195
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:46,595
cuz I have more options,
to make it more classical,

196
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:49,156
more neutral, you see,
it's not Aubade...

197
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:51,834
it's sauerkraut...

198
00:14:53,177 --> 00:14:55,406
- Sauerkraut, it's not what you want?

199
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:56,407
- No, but it's good!

200
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:57,608
- Turn on the radio!

201
00:14:59,836 --> 00:15:01,776
move, come on move!

202
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:09,060
there...
Who's that?

203
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:12,648
- Ooh, it's Jeff
- Hi guys, all is right?

204
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:15,095
- Be careful, you got a
drooping piece of fabric

205
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:17,474
- Sorry I don't feel like kidding

206
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,462
You're ready for "Starlight"?

207
00:15:19,463 --> 00:15:22,548
- That's it!
- That's the name! I told you earlier!

208
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:23,549
- No it's me, I told you!

209
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,550
- Ok, ok, alright,

210
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:27,252
I don't want to put
pressure on you,

211
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:30,030
but currently it's super hot
with Madone...

212
00:15:30,031 --> 00:15:31,834
- Yeah, Starlight is now in linear...

213
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:34,159
What!? I'll call her back...

214
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,972
You don't seem to realize,

215
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:38,855
though that's normal...
you're artists,

216
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:43,066
but Madone amounts to 39%
of the Ross sales, so...

217
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,048
Fuck! I'm gonna spit
in your mug!

218
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:46,849
I told you, I'll see to
that later...

219
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,368
Jeff always owns the
newest rubbish gadget

220
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:52,008
For example, his telephone
is built into his earphone,

221
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:53,869
the whole time permanently
linked to his secretary

222
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,728
- This bitch bugs me...
Here, it's my cellphone.

223
00:15:56,729 --> 00:15:59,880
With that I'm permanently linked to her,
so I always know everything

224
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:01,937
It's very expensive
and it drives me mad...

225
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:02,938
What was I saying?

226
00:16:06,184 --> 00:16:08,301
It stinks like shit of
sauerkraut in here, no?

227
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,281
- Jeff, let me introduce you to
Sir who produces that sauerkraut.

228
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:14,879
- oh yes, Jean-pierre Rannu:
Jean-françois Marolle,

229
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,438
Jean-françois Marolle:
Jean-Pierre Rannu

230
00:16:17,473 --> 00:16:19,996
- Sir Rannu, really,
I'm deeply sorry, but...

231
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:23,869
you know, we have so much stress
with this job, we need to relax...

232
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,252
- Forget it.
He's the floor manager...

233
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:26,253
- Beat it!

234
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:29,123
What Jeff doesn't say is that
today is the 12th

235
00:16:29,124 --> 00:16:32,754
On the 15th he will receive the evaluation
report of his work filed by his client

236
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:34,443
That's to say by Madone

237
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:36,390
A sort of school report
for adults

238
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:39,306
So, he freaks out. It's normal,
it's meant to be that way

239
00:16:39,307 --> 00:16:40,807
But it doesn't matter.
That's cool

240
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:45,211
Moreover, at the Ross everything
is cool... Even the sauerkraut

241
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:49,819
The Madone executive
would 'dig it' to be... cool

242
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,234
But, it's not easy to tumble about
in schizophrenia land

243
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:55,703
when your name is Jean Christian Gagnant
with initials engraved on your briefcase

244
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:58,564
For example, to him this morning
must have been a nightmare

245
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:06,128
In Madone every product manager
wears short-sleeved shirts...

246
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:07,430
- Have you received
my confirmation e-mail?

247
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:10,666
...and neckties with
little animals on them

248
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:14,505
You have received
my confirmation mail?

249
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:28,886
To a product manager,
looking cool is hyper important

250
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:31,287
We shall never forget that
a client has no ideas

251
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:33,964
and that's why he comes
to our advertising company

252
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,058
- that don't fit,
fuck, fuck and fuck!

253
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,489
fuuuuuuuck!

254
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:46,776
In those days, giant pictures
were put on the walls,

255
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:49,553
on bus stops,
on trucks, on taxis

256
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:53,704
The human eye had never been so much
solicited in all of recorded history

257
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:57,918
Between birth and 18 years old,
we had calculated that each person

258
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,892
had been exposed to an
average of 350,000 ads

259
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,799
It had taken 2,000 years
to come to this

260
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:17,659
- Gas Parengo
- Hello sir

261
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,002
- Charles Nagou, we have come
for the Starlight meeting

262
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:22,203
- Alright, you have an ID card?

263
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:23,204
- Yes

264
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:26,005
- Thanks

265
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:30,904
- We leave you the helmets

266
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:33,906
- Here are your badges,
1st floor, Veneziano room

267
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:34,907
- Thanks

268
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:37,975
- You have some left

269
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:44,104
Always arrive late to meetings,

270
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:46,566
A creative on time is not credible

271
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:51,852
Entering the room, where everybody's
waiting for him for 45 minutes,

272
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:54,107
he should by no means apologise

273
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:07,318
Upon reflection, it's true
this afternoon meeting

274
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,924
was even more important than an
interview with the head of the state

275
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,537
This meeting changed my life

276
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:22,537
I think originally, I wanted
to make good around me

277
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,908
It has not been possible,
for two reasons

278
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:30,546
Because I've been prevented, and also
a bit because I have abdicated

279
00:19:37,748 --> 00:19:42,056
- We're passing through a deep crisis
in the yoghurt industry

280
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,657
You know only too well,

281
00:19:43,658 --> 00:19:47,730
since the mad-cow disease cases,
yoghurt is threatened around the world

282
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:51,164
In this eroding market, our
answer is the "Foodament"

283
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:55,242
The "Foodament" is a food
which would also be a medicament

284
00:19:55,243 --> 00:19:59,366
And then, Starlight innovates and
focuses on a white cheese's new vision

285
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:00,167
The "bodymaking"

286
00:20:00,368 --> 00:20:04,138
With Starlight, I eat smart, so I am
smart, so Starlight makes me smart

287
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:05,140
It's when we 'catch' them

288
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:07,949
It's a bit "head to legs"

289
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,817
The guy that doesn't laugh
at Jeff's "non-joke"

290
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:14,463
is the one to be convinced.

Votes Republican

295
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:30,904
Adores karting. At Madone and at Ross
he is feared and dreaded

296
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:33,204
- Yes, next

297
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:37,100
- Here, working in this perspective...
of "bodymaking",

298
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:40,691
Octave and Charly have worked
for several weeks

299
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:44,558
I hand over to Octave...

300
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,772
- Sorry, I don't know what happened,

301
00:20:46,773 --> 00:20:49,478
I thought the meeting would
take place at the company

302
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,952
You have received
my confirmation e-mail?

303
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:54,154
- Gagnant, sit down

304
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,064
- Octave and Charly,
we're listening to you

305
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:16,568
- Right, before beginning, I'd like
to dedicate this film to Tatiana

306
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:18,895
I met her in a disco, two
years ago, in Saint Barth'

307
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:19,896
Thanks to her...

308
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:25,177
- Please, a bit of concentration

309
00:21:25,178 --> 00:21:28,067
Always begin by lightening the
atmosphere with a shitty joke

310
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,617
Drugs help you to gain
this nonchalance,

311
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:34,494
this needed detachment to
survive that kind of meeting

312
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:40,847
We all want to change the world,
and in taking part in these meetings

313
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:42,868
I'm aware of collaborating

314
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:47,203
Being sat down at this table is
taking part in deadening people's minds

315
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,795
To succeed, a sacrifice is needed

316
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:58,846
But I was thinking of being,
some day, incapable of it

317
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,622
- Octave, you're high

318
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:04,287
Octave, you're high

319
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:07,401
- Yes... sorry

320
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:10,786
- He's on drugs

321
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,287
- A discovery?

322
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:13,289
- We're on a beach

323
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,730
- Yes, so... Heavenly beach,
coco palms, turquoise sea,

324
00:22:16,731 --> 00:22:18,031
white sand, the Eden

325
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:19,432
- Two women,

326
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:20,433
- Two 'bombs'!

327
00:22:20,434 --> 00:22:21,434
- Of course

328
00:22:21,435 --> 00:22:22,436
are running
on the sand

329
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:23,962
Long focal length on
the young women

330
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:24,963
Pamela speaks

331
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:30,364
" In fact, I consider the exegis of our
mastitis are facing crippling hermeneutics.

332
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:31,444
Christina answers

333
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:35,317
Be careful, Pamela. You're slowly
slipping to an ontological paronomasis.

334
00:22:35,318 --> 00:22:38,010
- Not at all, it's just
an allegorical solipsism,

335
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:40,110
nothing to do with it...
Just look

336
00:22:40,145 --> 00:22:42,255
She bends over an
equation drawn in the sand

337
00:22:42,256 --> 00:22:44,050
- I have made an equation
for you to understand

338
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:45,854
if we accept the hypothesis
X cube root

339
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:49,055
varies according to the infinite
- Ah ok

340
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:50,026
- You just have to
subdivide the set

341
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:51,027
which will tend
to the asymptote

342
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:53,057
Exactly, it's good,
I've understood!

343
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:55,608
They leave laughing.

344
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:59,937
Packshot: "Starlight to remain slim
except in your head"

345
00:23:09,883 --> 00:23:11,211
- It's good?

346
00:23:11,212 --> 00:23:12,213
- Absolutely

347
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:18,318
- Now I ask a question;
Why make humour?

348
00:23:24,994 --> 00:23:27,371
- Yes, in fact we thought
it would be interesting...

349
00:23:28,763 --> 00:23:33,876
- No, no, no, I say:
Why make humour?

350
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:36,798
- Because humour makes
the brand friendly,

351
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,764
excellent for the
product identity memorization

352
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,554
Customers remember easier
what makes 'em laugh

353
00:23:42,064 --> 00:23:44,856
- Days after, people in offices
recall the joke... at dinners...

354
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,964
- No, no, no. Why?

355
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:53,083
- For it. For you. Think about comedies
that succeed, people going to the cine

356
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:58,059
They sometimes like
to have fun, people... No?

357
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:03,087
- Yes, except they don't
eat the reel after

358
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:19,832
Alfred Dulère is a big asshole

359
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:24,643
Come on Octave, open your mouth,
once and for all, and shove off

360
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:26,235
"Listen to me carefully dumb shit,

361
00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:29,340
when you go to the dentist, you
don't tell him how to do his job

362
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:30,342
you rely on him.

363
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,493
Here it's the same:
You rely on us!"

364
00:24:37,123 --> 00:24:38,749
- So, you have something else?

365
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:46,518
We're off our rocker,
stop to shoot up, guys

366
00:24:49,296 --> 00:24:52,896
Who the fuck do we sell the
yoghurt to?!

367
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,172
- The housewife

368
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:57,986
- The housewife is what?
You need to go out, guys!

369
00:24:59,813 --> 00:25:06,025
The housewife is tired...
She is in her suburban supermarket

370
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,225
her kids are bitching

371
00:25:07,226 --> 00:25:09,841
her hands are full of shit,
she's blown-out

372
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:13,755
She has a bunch of problems,
her husband boozes,

373
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:20,162
She doesn't feel like having a headache with
ironic references... that nobody understands!

374
00:25:20,163 --> 00:25:23,144
So, before thinking about your
4 friends in Paris you'll make laugh

375
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:27,096
I'm also a part of this production. Sometimes
it makes me laugh, your bullshit

376
00:25:27,097 --> 00:25:32,577
Before that, you should ask yourself,
"What does she want to see, our housewife?

377
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:35,682
What does she want to hear?
What does she want us to tell her?"

378
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:39,632
There, that's all!
That's the question

379
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:41,883
you should stop lying
to yourself, now...

380
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:44,183
- Really nice, your
view of the world!

381
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,870
- Me, guys, I have 12,000 tons
of yoghurt to sell off this year,

382
00:25:54,445 --> 00:25:59,236
So, youth: ok
Sexy: ok

383
00:26:01,957 --> 00:26:03,188
and...?

384
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:05,835
and dream!

385
00:26:06,985 --> 00:26:10,835
What the fuck, we are
dreams sellers!

386
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:15,251
Yesterday, I went to see my goddaughter,
she had her dance show...

387
00:26:15,252 --> 00:26:17,237
decors were painted by children...

388
00:26:21,054 --> 00:26:22,166
I got off on it

389
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,703
I took off

390
00:26:30,636 --> 00:26:33,541
My kind of 'high', Charly

391
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:39,308
So, I was wondering, dance, would there
be something to find around dance?

392
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:52,873
yoghurt, lightness, femininity,
... A dancer wearing tutu?

393
00:26:55,673 --> 00:26:56,931
No?

394
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:57,932
- Yes

395
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:03,533
- no, no, we will find,
we will... huh guys

396
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:07,202
- still with your style,
humor, glamour,...

397
00:27:07,203 --> 00:27:11,749
Now you know, you know why you've
been watching shit ads for years

398
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,709
It's here, at this moment,
that everything's tied up

399
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,849
Creatives don't lack ideas... behind
every shitty ad there's a good idea

400
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,776
thrown in the bin, just because everyone,
me included, shits in his pants

401
00:27:22,777 --> 00:27:23,977
- Excuse me

402
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:37,316
- You alright?

403
00:27:37,317 --> 00:27:39,687
- No, no because I leave the Ross

404
00:27:39,688 --> 00:27:40,688
I leave that pigsty

405
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:44,362
I stop working,
I get out of the system,

406
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:47,363
I stop it all, I piss on you,
I despise you all

407
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:49,397
I give you my card back

408
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:55,542
Of course, it's not a resignation,
it's a layoff, of course

409
00:27:55,543 --> 00:28:00,572
you fire me, classic stuff;
indemnities, cash, golden parachute

410
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:01,639
big money, ok!?

411
00:28:01,674 --> 00:28:04,474
- What's happened to you Octave?

412
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,068
You've recently had a change of drug?

413
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,022
- No, no

414
00:28:09,023 --> 00:28:15,114
- Ah, I see, you're writing a script
on a guy who thrives on depression

415
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:18,382
Ok, no it's good but it lacks of some...

416
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:24,865
No it's funny, you're still funny,
but I don't know, the guy...

417
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:26,733
...could lose everything,

418
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:32,090
He could become a shit

419
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:39,892
Think about it

420
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:57,383
Octave... I adore you,
you know it

421
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:10,682
YOU

422
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:32,938
Sophie has worked
at the Ross for 3 years,

423
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:36,739
She is a part-time planning
manager, Marc hired her

424
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:40,653
He has always
had good taste

425
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:47,707
No, no don't insist

426
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:50,488
to make love in an elevator
with an intern, it's...

427
00:30:50,489 --> 00:30:51,489
far too, "adrenalin" to me

428
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:55,670
even if I feel you're hot as hell

429
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:57,614
it's out of the question!
Negative!

430
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:00,120
I've got a reputation to preserve,
you understand?

431
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:06,875
Here it's more in the mood,
dirty parking, shabby lights,

432
00:31:06,876 --> 00:31:07,876
very Mike Lee...

433
00:31:07,877 --> 00:31:08,877
we fancy it at this time

434
00:31:08,878 --> 00:31:10,686
piss smell, the real one

435
00:31:12,094 --> 00:31:14,584
What you will do, Sophie?
You'll take your lil' scooter in the rain

436
00:31:14,585 --> 00:31:17,051
you'll return to your lil' husband,
watch the Saturday night show?

437
00:31:17,052 --> 00:31:19,260
That's it, the happiness
he offers you... That's it?

438
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,283
- I'm alone and I don't have a TV

439
00:31:22,284 --> 00:31:25,129
- ok, wait, wait, I know I am a
superficial and arrogant shit

440
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,130
ok I don't deny

441
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:28,110
But I like you, you understand?

442
00:31:28,111 --> 00:31:31,111
Your hair, your eyebrows,
your small intestine please me

443
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,003
even your rebuffs please me

444
00:31:34,004 --> 00:31:35,005
- If my rebuffs please you...

445
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:37,705
- Nobody, nobody
ever pleases me

446
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:48,639
I'm sure if you let yourself be kissed,
it could be relatively... pleasant

447
00:32:02,226 --> 00:32:06,252
It's really what I thought,
you're really a beautiful slut

448
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,925
- Wear them, wear them, so I can kiss
myself a little

449
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:52,722
Everything's alright,
everything's alright!

450
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:15,071
Hi, it's Sophie, leave me a message,
and I may call you back

451
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:17,576
Since Sophie left you,
you wander around your flat,

452
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:20,308
you no longer
open your curtains,

453
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:22,629
You only use one
room out of nine

454
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:27,844
the microwave sets the
rhythm of your week-ends

455
00:33:28,956 --> 00:33:31,208
you order your
ready-meals by phone

456
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:35,532
since you're living alone,
you fuck a lot of video-tapes

457
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:38,354
you always have pieces of kleenex
stuck to your fingertips

458
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:46,169
Being without Sophie
made you ugly

459
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,170
Not only drugs cause
withdrawal

460
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:51,170
It was easier to have a single
retarded behaviour

461
00:33:52,172 --> 00:33:55,171
when you knew lovely Sophie
was waiting for you

462
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:13,458
Since Sophie left you
nothing goes on

463
00:34:14,311 --> 00:34:15,712
When was it?

464
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,314
- It's going alright,
thanks a lot!

465
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:23,315
- Stop it...

466
00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:28,194
You've finished eating?

467
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:38,161
- I can't with these... Like this I can,
with my hand

468
00:34:38,162 --> 00:34:39,162
- I see that

469
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:41,951
- With these, I can't,
or maybe if I 'sting'...

470
00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:42,952
You see, if I sting...

471
00:34:44,131 --> 00:34:45,942
- So you've finished now?

472
00:34:45,943 --> 00:34:46,941
- Yes

473
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,800
- So, I got a little
gift for you

474
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:53,001
Happy St. Valentine Day

475
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:57,527
Ah yeah, it was that day

476
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:03,085
- You're unfair, plus
we said no gifts

477
00:35:03,086 --> 00:35:04,986
- But here, it's a little
bit more than that

478
00:35:04,987 --> 00:35:07,629
- What, sorry?
Lot more than that?

479
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,630
- Lot more...

480
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,131
- So, it's a surprise

481
00:35:13,632 --> 00:35:15,132
I open it

482
00:35:16,796 --> 00:35:18,781
It won't blow me in the...

483
00:35:20,782 --> 00:35:21,782
here I go

484
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,823
It smells like pee-pee a bit

485
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:02,345
- It's a pregnancy test

486
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:06,440
Positive

487
00:36:15,112 --> 00:36:16,961
I'm pregnant by you

488
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:21,066
- Holy cow! It was hard

489
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:23,832
I spilled all my guts,
everything that every man

490
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:26,918
of the world says to their
pregnant girl, in those moments

491
00:37:14,271 --> 00:37:16,546
- Sir, Madame
Have you finished?

492
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:18,347
- Yes it's over

493
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:21,249
- You don't want
a little dessert?

494
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:41,193
Sophie never told anyone
she was pregnant

495
00:37:41,194 --> 00:37:42,194
except to you

496
00:37:42,195 --> 00:37:45,280
Moreover, at the Ross, nobody
knew you were together

497
00:37:46,544 --> 00:37:49,247
What is she doing?
Who is she phoning to?

498
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:51,823
Where is she when
she's not here?

499
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:03,040
Marc and Sophie, didn't fit together,
but they were good together

500
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,122
Which is lot more rare

501
00:38:07,823 --> 00:38:08,871
They go to a full
of stars hotel,

502
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:11,179
three times per week,
at about 14h15

503
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:14,547
In order to have sex in
a clean and a central place

504
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,584
Ouch, you're hurt

505
00:38:23,544 --> 00:38:30,571
- Guys, fun's over, joke's over,
good mood's over, all this game is over

506
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:34,015
I am not joking here!

507
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:37,025
Dulère just phone me, he never
talked to me that way!

508
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:39,345
Listen to me!

509
00:38:39,346 --> 00:38:41,046
if we don't have a
new concrete script

510
00:38:41,091 --> 00:38:43,356
before 14 o'clock,
we're all dead!

511
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:46,021
I tell you, in one hour,
we're all on the dole!

512
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,349
- It's hardly depressing in here,
it looks like 3 Ross' employees...

513
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:55,482
- President, it so kind to come
to see the small workers

514
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,582
- Hi youngsters!

515
00:38:57,895 --> 00:39:00,358
- Tell me, Jeff, we've been phoned
by Dulère: it's not right

516
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,859
- Jean-François, what stage
are you at with Madone?

517
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,460
- Precisely, we're in
the middle of a meeting

518
00:39:04,461 --> 00:39:07,652
We're on a lot more
federative concept

519
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:08,653
We're at that stage

520
00:39:08,654 --> 00:39:12,126
- Oh, really, we're
at that stage?

521
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:14,127
- We got your green
light, Marc?

522
00:39:26,332 --> 00:39:28,928
- it's swotting? uh?

523
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:32,378
- it's swotting hard!
hey that's good...

524
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:40,610
- Hey Cuddly is not punchy...

525
00:39:41,635 --> 00:39:44,204
- Stop with it, you idiot,
you're gonna kill it,

526
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:47,063
stop doing that, it,s gonna
choke, I tell you

527
00:39:47,064 --> 00:39:49,532
- Hey, we should already
be shooting, now!

528
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:51,133
and your bullshit!

529
00:39:51,134 --> 00:39:53,596
Fuck, we are done now!

530
00:39:53,631 --> 00:39:56,184
We lose Madone,
it's direct layoff...

531
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:59,394
But you don't give a fuck,
anyway, you'll always find a job

532
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:01,522
At least, move your ass
for the others!

533
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:02,923
I don't even
talk about me

534
00:40:02,924 --> 00:40:04,800
anyway, I know you despise me,
you don't like me,

535
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:06,663
I'm just a little shitty
salesman, that's it?

536
00:40:06,664 --> 00:40:10,207
Think about low wages,
small posts, they will pay the price

537
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,001
Jacqueline, at the accountancy,
with her handicapped kid

538
00:40:12,002 --> 00:40:13,637
45 years old, you think
she will find a job?

539
00:40:13,638 --> 00:40:14,738
She can still dream on!

540
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:17,740
...and Momo who cleans your shit up
every evening, your coke, your porn mags

541
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:18,741
He also can still dream on!

542
00:40:18,742 --> 00:40:21,509
Be humans, fuck!

543
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:26,073
Of course, it feels weird to him,
realising he will shortly be homeless

544
00:40:26,074 --> 00:40:29,646
J.- F. Marolle has been programmed
for a streetless existence

545
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:32,087
He has accepted being insulted
and humiliated, during 15 years,

546
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:35,678
by his employers and his clients,
to be able to borrow money from the Bank

547
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,155
in order to acquire 3 rooms
in Levalois-Perret.

548
00:40:38,156 --> 00:40:41,645
- That's fine, come on
we go, uh?

549
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:43,446
- ok

550
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:45,575
- Come on, it's good, stand up

551
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:50,574
He freaks out so much, he would
almost become touching

552
00:40:53,124 --> 00:40:56,761
- So... The last-minute dung, ok?

553
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:57,962
- Absolutely

554
00:40:57,963 --> 00:40:59,463
- The dung...

555
00:40:59,464 --> 00:41:00,464
- A charming woman,

556
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:02,629
- neither too old,
nor too young

557
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,630
- neither blonde nor dark

558
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:04,631
- chestnut?

559
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:06,332
- dark

560
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:09,630
- ... Performs small dance steps,
wearing a tutu

561
00:41:09,631 --> 00:41:13,452
- ah no, no, no, a Vanna
White's little shirt

562
00:41:13,453 --> 00:41:14,453
- I take

563
00:41:14,454 --> 00:41:17,451
She is on a beautiful
seaside house's terrace

564
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:18,452
decorated like in...

565
00:41:18,741 --> 00:41:19,757
- "Friends"

566
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:21,558
- warm without being flashy

567
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,757
she looks at the camera,
she exclaims with a voice...

568
00:41:24,758 --> 00:41:27,659
- suave but authentical...

569
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,660
- I'm pretty aren't it?

570
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:32,049
no, I'm told I'm pretty...

571
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,988
I'm said to be pretty,

572
00:41:34,989 --> 00:41:36,289
- but I don't ask myself the question

573
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,481
- I'm quite simply myself!

574
00:41:38,482 --> 00:41:42,842
She grabs a Starlight pot
she delicately opens

575
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:44,143
- Neither too fast nor to slow,

576
00:41:44,144 --> 00:41:46,045
- before enjoying a spoonful

577
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:49,081
- She closes her eyes with pleasure,
while enjoying the product

578
00:41:49,668 --> 00:41:50,596
- That's good,

579
00:41:50,597 --> 00:41:53,664
- in passing, plan on 2 seconds,
at least...

580
00:41:53,665 --> 00:41:54,665
- minimum, uh...

581
00:41:54,967 --> 00:41:56,767
- Then, she looks straight
to the camera:

582
00:41:56,768 --> 00:41:58,168
"My secret is...

583
00:41:58,169 --> 00:41:59,669
- Starlight!"

584
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,982
Scuse me...

585
00:42:02,983 --> 00:42:03,983
- Starlight...

586
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:07,075
- So there you put
the product demo...

587
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:09,683
with 6 white cheeses, fat-free,
with calcium, vitamins, proteins,

588
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:12,684
to be healthy in head and body
there's nothing better...

589
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,684
- They will adore...

590
00:42:13,685 --> 00:42:15,786
- She resumes;

591
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:19,399
Here is my secret,

592
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,103
- but it's no more,
since I told you all!

593
00:42:23,084 --> 00:42:24,111
- Impish laugh,

594
00:42:24,146 --> 00:42:25,053
- Not too much...

595
00:42:25,054 --> 00:42:28,496
- Packshot, "Starlight to stay slim
except inside your head "

596
00:42:31,603 --> 00:42:32,968
- It's awesome;

597
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:34,370
guys you blew me away!

598
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,577
- it's in your email

599
00:42:36,578 --> 00:42:39,302
- Dulère is gonna shit in
his pants, when he sees this

600
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:43,252
- You have no self-esteem,
I despise you, bite it

601
00:42:43,253 --> 00:42:44,588
- They're gonna go mad!

602
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:45,589
- Run away!

603
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,797
- Uh Charly, we gonna bugger
Madone once again...

604
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:50,800
What?! yeah
I'm coming, bitch...

605
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,650
- Go check your emails out

606
00:43:00,613 --> 00:43:05,183
You idiot,
she's dead

607
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:31,589
- I'm a daddy,
she's pregnant!

608
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:35,916
- it's not true!
It's working, it's true?

609
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:43,469
- You never thought of being a model?

610
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,470
- rather a comedian, it's my dream

611
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:48,480
I do lots of castings, but
there are too many girls

612
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:49,980
I heard I'm too "exotic"

613
00:44:51,431 --> 00:44:55,067
- If someday I hear of stuff, would you
like me to pull the strings for you?

614
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:57,787
You know, I'm an
important person

615
00:45:00,187 --> 00:45:02,186
- I'll make you 10%
on your blow jobs

616
00:45:02,187 --> 00:45:06,741
That's true, to a professionnal like Tamara,
Octave is a puzzling customer

617
00:45:06,742 --> 00:45:09,363
He asks her to wear Obsession,
Sophie's perfume

618
00:45:09,364 --> 00:45:10,364
She appeases him

619
00:45:10,565 --> 00:45:13,174
Tamara is the call-girl
he doesn't fuck

620
00:45:14,717 --> 00:45:16,242
- Come on

621
00:45:20,615 --> 00:45:24,619
wait wait ola, softly,
light, light, cruising,

622
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,420
respect yourself

623
00:45:28,348 --> 00:45:30,320
you got beautiful hair

624
00:45:32,484 --> 00:45:33,722
- That's additions

625
00:45:33,723 --> 00:45:36,145
- You got beautiful eyes

626
00:45:37,649 --> 00:45:39,392
- That's lenses

627
00:45:40,132 --> 00:45:42,354
- You've got beautiful breasts

628
00:45:42,355 --> 00:45:44,805
- It's a wonderbra

629
00:45:51,286 --> 00:45:52,782
- You got beautiful legs

630
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:56,185
- aah, at last a compliment!

631
00:46:00,182 --> 00:46:03,965
- Stop!

632
00:46:04,466 --> 00:46:07,466
Why are you whoring?

633
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:09,554
You're unhappy?

634
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,871
- I'm never unhappy
When I do...

635
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:19,041
- To me it's the opposite, I call you
not to be unhappy

636
00:46:19,675 --> 00:46:21,362
It's beautiful

637
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:23,991
- You think some day
we'll make love?

638
00:46:24,655 --> 00:46:27,395
- Call me back, Sophie,
I regret...

639
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:53,640
Octave it's Jeff, I hope you
had my messages on your cellphone,

640
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:57,763
anyway your voicemail is full,
anyway, I wanted to tell you

641
00:46:57,798 --> 00:47:02,193
I made Tamara come,
the actress you told me about

642
00:47:02,228 --> 00:47:06,010
by the way, she is terrific, if you
can call me back that would be nice

643
00:47:06,011 --> 00:47:09,211
IT'S THE FIRST AND LAST TIME
YOU SEE YOUR DAUGHTER. Sophie

644
00:47:09,212 --> 00:47:11,648
It's 18:00, you can pass by
at the office,

645
00:47:11,649 --> 00:47:13,601
I hope you don't have
personal worries

646
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:23,172
Octave, It's Jeff again, call me
back, I went out to have a run

647
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,369
I passed by back at the office, I try
to call you on your cellphone

648
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:33,247
So, Octave, I've called all Paris clubs,
you're not under the tables

649
00:47:33,248 --> 00:47:39,921
It would be nice of you to call me back,
I hope you have no worries...

650
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,535
- Octave! Fuck!
where have you been?

651
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:03,553
Where have you been?
You have had my mess...?

652
00:49:03,554 --> 00:49:04,554
- Leave me alone!

653
00:49:45,413 --> 00:49:48,011
I'm on a bad...

654
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:08,196
- Darling, Eric Won the match!
- I scored 3 goals!

655
00:50:08,197 --> 00:50:10,139
- Eric has won the match!

656
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:16,401
There, honey. A beautiful chocolate bar,
filled with good milk moss for your growth

657
00:50:23,343 --> 00:50:24,703
- Hello!

658
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,815
- Have you seen a cute chick passing, here,
leaving from here, she was in yellow

659
00:50:32,816 --> 00:50:37,043
- ah, ah, Eric has won the match!
- I scored 3 goals!

660
00:50:37,044 --> 00:50:42,612
- Ok, it's over, you can leave, you can
stop, all is over, you can go back home,

661
00:50:42,613 --> 00:50:44,166
All that's here doesn't exist!

662
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,586
Look at yourselves,
you match with nothing,

663
00:50:46,587 --> 00:50:49,344
your aspect, your hairdos,
your white teeth, everything,

664
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:52,541
the blotch, here; dirt with
clean around, it doesn't exist,

665
00:50:52,542 --> 00:50:54,493
nobody, blotches himself like that,
you understand?

666
00:50:54,494 --> 00:50:56,308
- Eric has won the match!

667
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:58,437
- Look at your mouths,
you are Danish,

668
00:50:58,438 --> 00:50:59,966
You're overdub

669
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,927
You're not synchro, I am.
I've got a microphone, you understand?

670
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:08,924
- Eric has won the match!
- I scored 3 goals!

671
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:10,990
- What match? Fuckin' shit!
What match?

672
00:51:10,991 --> 00:51:13,659
What sort of match? Foot,
tennis, waterpolo? What...?

673
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:16,848
The numbers of birds in here, it's crazy!

674
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:17,849
What's your food like?

675
00:51:20,582 --> 00:51:23,986
- A beautiful chocolate bar,
filled with good milk moss

676
00:51:23,987 --> 00:51:24,987
for your growth

677
00:51:30,115 --> 00:51:31,957
- Could you turn that
music off, it's a pain...

678
00:51:33,362 --> 00:51:35,544
- You're walking on crosses,
This orange juice is fake,

679
00:51:35,545 --> 00:51:38,447
this plate is glued, look,
there's a technician here, look

680
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:43,173
there are cameras everywhere!
look! look, go away...

681
00:51:46,363 --> 00:51:51,172
ah yeah, look!
Look!

682
00:51:57,025 --> 00:51:59,069
What are these rails here?!
we'll tumble down!

683
00:52:01,991 --> 00:52:04,618
- Hello girls
- Hello Jeff

684
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:06,568
Here, at the Ross and Witchcraft,
the customer is always right

685
00:52:06,569 --> 00:52:08,211
and the customer is you

686
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:10,507
Stéphanie, give me the call!

687
00:52:10,508 --> 00:52:13,519
Yes, Jean-Christian,
how is the little family?

688
00:52:14,944 --> 00:52:16,812
You'll always have
the last word

689
00:52:17,314 --> 00:52:20,970
Yes, I read your proposition,
It's really a great idea!

690
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,607
Ah yes, it's terrific,
really. Good bye!

691
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:25,306
See you Wednesday!

692
00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:29,835
Even if it's not your job,
we'll make you feel important

693
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:32,481
You won't come to us
only by chance

694
00:52:33,842 --> 00:52:37,533
The World is a concept
and your concept will be ours

695
00:52:42,505 --> 00:52:44,006
- It feels good

696
00:52:46,749 --> 00:52:53,093
For my anus, I use R n' W, "Smell and Flavour",
thereby, with one touch

697
00:52:53,094 --> 00:52:55,461
I keep my anus and my breath fresh...

698
00:53:05,665 --> 00:53:14,481
- It's charming... relax, try to
quiet down, it's gonna be alright

699
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:15,483
try to appease yourself,

700
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:20,327
I'm here, I'll be just behind
the ambulance...

701
00:53:20,362 --> 00:53:22,046
- He's gonna die!
- it's ok, it's ok,

702
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,047
- He's gonna die!
- Go away, go away!

703
00:53:23,048 --> 00:53:25,721
- Let him breathe!
Here we go

704
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:31,631
- Prepare me some adrenalin,
- block, block

705
00:53:34,134 --> 00:53:35,197
- Charge

706
00:54:07,768 --> 00:54:10,070
- We're losing him

707
00:55:06,175 --> 00:55:07,873
Octave is back from the dead

708
00:55:26,202 --> 00:55:28,789
To him, life without cocaine
is nearly a discovery

709
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,537
It's a bit like a life
without TV to others

710
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:36,905
Everything is slower,
and it quickly gets boring

711
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:02,927
He tells himself, maybe that's the secret
that would save the world:

712
00:56:02,928 --> 00:56:05,928
accepting boredom

713
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:10,929
...Not easy...

714
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:33,128
Jeff never held a grudge
towards him for the punch

715
00:56:33,129 --> 00:56:35,428
Finally, he's nice Jeff

716
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:38,280
- He looks fine, uh?
- Not so much

717
00:56:38,336 --> 00:56:38,936
- Yes, he looks fine

718
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:43,559
Octave and Jeff could die together...
It would be good for society

719
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:48,832
- Octave, you're ok?
You look really well today

720
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:49,833
It's a pleasure

721
00:56:52,554 --> 00:56:53,938
- It's a pleasure to see you

722
00:56:58,657 --> 00:57:00,388
I have something to tell you

723
00:57:00,389 --> 00:57:02,364
- Well, we'll talk in the car

724
00:57:04,898 --> 00:57:06,614
- I'll take your bag

725
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:27,581
- Him, Octave's new friend...
it's Pyjamaman

726
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:37,061
Marc Maronnier is dead.
Octave and the other people

727
00:57:37,096 --> 00:57:39,039
from the agency were
shocked by Marc's Suicide

728
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:42,620
but to say his gesture
surprised them, would be a lie

729
00:57:42,662 --> 00:57:45,129
- I was feeling it coming
- I didn't expect it at all

730
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:50,298
- I expected it. Now, to speak of
positive things, at Madone they are 100%...

731
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:53,349
At the agency everything's going as
expected with Starlight

732
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:56,198
The train of mediocrity,
hasn't run a minute late

733
00:57:56,199 --> 00:57:58,254
Rather, It has even got ahead:

734
00:57:58,255 --> 00:57:59,255
page setting of the dung

735
00:57:59,256 --> 00:58:01,386
presenting at Madone

736
00:58:01,387 --> 00:58:02,387
appreciating at 200%

737
00:58:02,388 --> 00:58:04,937
buying of even more
broadcasting spaces

738
00:58:04,938 --> 00:58:05,938
congratulating

739
00:58:05,939 --> 00:58:06,939
treating genius

740
00:58:08,915 --> 00:58:11,381
- Sophie? You have news?

741
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:16,570
- Precisely,
- She went away to Canada,

742
00:58:16,605 --> 00:58:17,903
She has resigned

743
00:58:35,872 --> 00:58:39,869
Marc was fired.
At the agency seminary,

744
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:43,723
on the beach, at sunset
he shot a bullet in his head

745
00:58:43,724 --> 00:58:47,163
In advertising, when one's self joins
up with Spacetime's Matrix

746
00:58:47,164 --> 00:58:51,258
there are no articles in the papers,
no half-mast posters,

747
00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:52,259
no souvenir show,

748
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,421
only unsold stock options remain

749
00:58:55,422 --> 00:58:59,554
When a publicist joins up with god,
he's replaced with a live publicist

750
00:59:01,312 --> 00:59:03,353
Marc, I'll avenge you

751
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,035
- Watch out, it's fragile...

752
00:59:08,036 --> 00:59:09,335
Arriving at the PPM,

753
00:59:09,336 --> 00:59:13,180
PPM it means, in American,
Pre Production Meeting

754
00:59:13,181 --> 00:59:18,288
It's to say the last meeting where all the
details are decided before the shooting

755
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:20,850
At the top of the meeting syndrome,

756
00:59:20,885 --> 00:59:23,875
the one who's just 34 years old,
and who already speaks to herself.

757
00:59:23,876 --> 00:59:25,875
It's Fabienne, the tv-prod

758
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:30,410
Always under Prozac,
she always does her best

759
00:59:30,411 --> 00:59:33,496
It's tiring her enormously,
but it's the same for us

760
00:59:37,337 --> 00:59:43,097
- Right, before starting this meeting,
I'd like us to have a moments thought

761
00:59:43,098 --> 00:59:47,701
for Marc Maronnier, who left us
tragically some days ago

762
00:59:47,702 --> 00:59:53,958
A thought for the great professional
he was, but above all for the man

763
00:59:59,944 --> 01:00:03,109
Concerning the Jean Christian's
confirmation mail, shooting list details...

764
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:05,447
It was phone contacts for the
shooting, everybody agree with it?

765
01:00:05,448 --> 01:00:07,624
- It must be 'yoghurt in your life'

766
01:00:10,427 --> 01:00:14,449
moreover, the laptop on the table idea
for the packshot... it's perfect, it's modern

767
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:20,451
It makes it catch...
Giovanni what does he think about it?

768
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,242
- Giovanni M. Dulère

769
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:31,125
Him, it's Giovanni Del Toro, he has
been chosen cause he is very pro

770
01:00:33,779 --> 01:00:35,995
Translate: He bows down to the agency

771
01:00:37,848 --> 01:00:40,921
- If everybody agrees, we can
proceed to casting now, Charly...

772
01:00:40,922 --> 01:00:45,293
Now at this moment, the Client
must choose the human being

773
01:00:45,294 --> 01:00:47,774
who will best embody his product...
it's always a bit of a sensitive point

774
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:52,667
- These are our 2 choices
for the Starlight woman

775
01:00:52,668 --> 01:00:56,514
Jennifer you can reach at 88-60-90

776
01:00:58,797 --> 01:01:01,295
We love her, she is fresh,
she is modern

777
01:01:01,296 --> 01:01:06,368
- What's that mess?
What's that black?

778
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:09,839
Jeff, restrain your guys, cuz
we're again starting off with...

779
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,598
Scuse me, I'm not racist, but no...

780
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,834
at a pinch, the day we bring
a Starlight Chocolate out

781
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:19,823
why not, but here, it's not my fault
if our youghurt is white

782
01:01:19,824 --> 01:01:22,796
Blacks - It's too much segmenting

783
01:01:22,797 --> 01:01:23,797
- it produces too much anxiety

784
01:01:24,483 --> 01:01:27,429
- I'm ok to be open-minded,
but there are limits...

785
01:01:28,354 --> 01:01:31,130
- So we reach too much africanity,
not enough francity, we agree?

786
01:01:31,131 --> 01:01:36,804
- Too much africanity, not enough...
- africanity, not enough francity,

787
01:01:37,442 --> 01:01:40,191
- There, it's better, that's better,

788
01:01:40,192 --> 01:01:43,491
it's even really good,

789
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,392
she is really good that Tarama...

790
01:01:45,427 --> 01:01:47,191
- Tamara
- Yes, Trama...

791
01:01:47,493 --> 01:01:52,008
- Superb, she's totally
in the brand values

792
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:05,160
- it's Madone's proper image

793
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:06,161
it's superb

794
01:02:07,252 --> 01:02:09,619
- it's different?
- it's different

795
01:02:09,654 --> 01:02:12,153
Excuse me, she looks less
prostitute than the previous one

796
01:02:12,154 --> 01:02:13,154
- That's right

797
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:15,982
- It's completely Starlight

798
01:02:15,983 --> 01:02:21,467
- That's no more and no less than
Jennifer Lopez, more junior, more trendy

799
01:02:21,468 --> 01:02:24,395
- It wouldn't be still
too much africanity?

800
01:02:27,163 --> 01:02:29,806
- You can brighten her face
a little, in post-prod?

801
01:02:29,807 --> 01:02:32,719
- Completely, we'll rework the tone,
during the calibration, no problem

802
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,210
- Ok Bingo!
That's her

803
01:02:35,211 --> 01:02:36,211
- So, we optionalize it

804
01:02:38,778 --> 01:02:42,651
The meeting lasted 7 hours,
7 hours of jerk-off

805
01:02:42,652 --> 01:02:43,652
with some piece of bravery...

806
01:02:43,653 --> 01:02:45,034
- Gagnant, anything else?

807
01:02:45,035 --> 01:02:46,034
- Eh, yes, important,

808
01:02:49,178 --> 01:02:53,588
- I'd like us to validate the
green density of the lawn, now

809
01:02:53,623 --> 01:02:57,160
Well in brief, it's bootlickin'
it's titillating, it's nit-picking

810
01:02:57,161 --> 01:03:00,859
it's diddling at night,
as usual,

811
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,521
and during office hours...
- up, up, down,

812
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:13,085
right, right, up, up, up,...

813
01:03:13,086 --> 01:03:15,818
It looks as if it were nothing,
that small meeting, to you,

814
01:03:15,819 --> 01:03:17,820
completely surrealist and entertaining

815
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,275
and yet...

816
01:03:20,276 --> 01:03:23,323
- It's not for you, there will
be chocolate, after and before

817
01:03:23,324 --> 01:03:25,445
- Not a custard tart!
- It will be after

818
01:03:25,446 --> 01:03:30,857
- Chocolate mousse!
- Stop it kids, stop it,

819
01:03:44,252 --> 01:03:46,454
that's enough kids!

820
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:27,050
Pay less, less,
it's cheaper for you

821
01:04:46,859 --> 01:04:50,280
- Validated, perfect!

822
01:04:50,281 --> 01:04:53,910
- I think we're totally focused, here
- 7 hours meeting, I think we did a good job

823
01:04:53,911 --> 01:04:58,065
- I personally really enjoyed myself,
- Good, there will be fewer

824
01:04:58,066 --> 01:05:00,164
- really, really good meeting, Corinne,
I like your work a lot

825
01:05:00,165 --> 01:05:02,514
- No but my name is Fabienne,
- Welcome to the Ross

826
01:05:02,515 --> 01:05:03,950
- I've been working here for 5 years

827
01:05:03,951 --> 01:05:07,843
- Look at this! Octave is
already set to go to Miami

828
01:05:07,844 --> 01:05:11,976
He has ready his little bag,
bloody Octave!

829
01:06:14,547 --> 01:06:18,367
- Tamara it's really good, honestly,
come on spit!

830
01:06:18,368 --> 01:06:19,982
There, softly...

831
01:06:22,406 --> 01:06:24,297
- Still respect yourself...

832
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:28,809
It's really good,

833
01:06:28,844 --> 01:06:31,411
but just a little bit
greedier, please,

834
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,979
offer it to us, give it to me,
greedier,

835
01:06:34,141 --> 01:06:36,213
think about closing your eyes
when swallowing, ok?

836
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:36,965
- Yes,

837
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,897
- One has to feel the
pleasure in your throat

838
01:06:38,898 --> 01:06:39,585
come on, act it for me,

839
01:06:39,614 --> 01:06:43,215
right, close you eyes
while swallowing

840
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,232
you take your time,

841
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:46,198
That was good
what you did in the end

842
01:06:46,233 --> 01:06:48,904
really good, more smiley
at the end than at the start

843
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:51,855
that's the product benefit, that makes
you fresh, happy and blooming, ok?

844
01:06:53,206 --> 01:06:57,388
We're here, we rule,
of course you keep it inside,

845
01:06:57,389 --> 01:07:00,896
but you give to the other, you rule,
you take, without ever...

846
01:07:00,897 --> 01:07:04,558
because otherwise we are...
but, raise the product up

847
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:10,554
There, mysterious, that's right
look at the product, look at us

848
01:07:10,555 --> 01:07:11,754
and offer Starlight!

849
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:15,677
There that's it!
We do it again

850
01:07:20,042 --> 01:07:21,209
- it's really...

851
01:08:00,429 --> 01:08:02,775
- It's good?
- Huge, nothing to do...

852
01:08:03,661 --> 01:08:05,957
don't you think?
- Superb

853
01:08:10,842 --> 01:08:13,431
It was the last take of the day,

854
01:08:13,432 --> 01:08:16,538
and the most important for an ad film;
the 'packshot'

855
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:25,334
Hours of lighting, each minor detail
matters, yoghurt choice, the spoon...

856
01:08:28,236 --> 01:08:30,986
In fact, the jerk-off's Everest

857
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:45,641
- Best thing is to do a wrap up
on Starlight, I think...

858
01:08:45,642 --> 01:08:46,642
- It's really well done!

859
01:08:46,643 --> 01:08:49,007
- All right
- No, that's shit and you know it

860
01:08:49,008 --> 01:08:50,876
You see the two fuckers, there?

861
01:08:54,287 --> 01:08:56,239
- I've always known we
could count on him

862
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,363
- I want to make them cry.
After the take,

863
01:08:58,364 --> 01:09:00,409
you hang on with the chief
cameraman for 10 minutes

864
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:01,911
We'll shoot our version

865
01:09:01,912 --> 01:09:03,878
of stuff never done before.

866
01:09:03,879 --> 01:09:05,963
A commando operation

867
01:09:05,964 --> 01:09:08,268
- With what he's put in his turbinate bone,
he won't go far...

868
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:14,576
- He's an artist, it works
like that with artists

869
01:09:14,577 --> 01:09:20,877
Simple customer,
we'll find another one

870
01:09:25,254 --> 01:09:27,763
Octave I wanted to tell you
how much you impressed me

871
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:31,454
Thank you, Octave, thank you
for your involvement

872
01:09:31,455 --> 01:09:37,296
I know this script wasn't
your favourite...

873
01:09:37,297 --> 01:09:40,128
You played the game
as a great professional

874
01:09:40,129 --> 01:09:44,462
Obviously, Alfred Dulère
is a big prick even abroad

875
01:09:44,463 --> 01:09:47,139
- See you soon
- See you very soon

876
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,431
- So, we've got a plane to take

877
01:09:49,432 --> 01:09:51,644
- Yes, didn't you want
to salute Tamara?

878
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:55,604
- Oh, yes Tamara... yes,
Gagnant! I leave you my house keys

879
01:09:55,605 --> 01:09:56,605
Details Diana, details!

880
01:09:56,606 --> 01:10:00,299
- Buddy, come see. You're ready?
- Yes

881
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,300
- You're ready?
- Yes

882
01:10:01,301 --> 01:10:06,892
- Wait, wait, They propose to us
the creative director post

883
01:10:06,893 --> 01:10:10,240
250,000 F per month, plus expense claims,
paid apartment, company Porsches

884
01:10:10,241 --> 01:10:13,580
company bitches, stock options,
well there, Everests of coke

885
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:16,216
- No
- But yes, you must say yes!

886
01:10:16,217 --> 01:10:18,970
- No, no, no
- Why?

887
01:10:18,971 --> 01:10:22,859
- Because I've got more of a
turn-on, that's more revolutionary

888
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:25,266
- That's what?
- After...

889
01:10:27,618 --> 01:10:29,286
- We do the packshot

890
01:10:29,287 --> 01:10:32,007
- No, skip it, this movie is shit

891
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:40,017
- But it's important, the packshot!
- After Fabienne, after

892
01:10:46,756 --> 01:10:50,572
US

893
01:10:53,924 --> 01:10:55,467
We have succeeded

894
01:10:55,468 --> 01:10:59,106
Our version was in the can,
we were kings, we were the greatest

895
01:11:00,108 --> 01:11:02,718
Here it is, I was a comeback

896
01:12:49,879 --> 01:12:55,427
- That's weird, that stuff
doesn't seem to get any bigger...

897
01:13:43,108 --> 01:13:45,304
- Try again

898
01:15:24,104 --> 01:15:27,703
- May I serve you something?
Tea, coffee?

899
01:15:33,097 --> 01:15:35,314
Madam, sir, would you like a drink?

900
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,695
I stayed cloistered at home,

901
01:15:40,804 --> 01:15:43,323
crying and systematically stumbling
upon Sophie's answerphone

902
01:15:43,878 --> 01:15:47,126
In the meantime, Charly, that fuckhead,
had already answered for us both,

903
01:15:47,127 --> 01:15:49,748
I just had to sign the papers

904
01:15:49,749 --> 01:15:55,969
Visually, Creative Director
initials makes D.C.

905
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:56,970
Young blood at R.&W.

906
01:15:56,971 --> 01:15:59,613
- ahh, you're no dorks!
You could have smiled a bit more,

907
01:15:59,614 --> 01:16:01,014
but you are no dorks!

908
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:06,545
It's in behalf of all at Ross that I raise
my glass to our two new Creative Directors:

909
01:16:06,546 --> 01:16:08,878
Octave and Charly

910
01:16:10,981 --> 01:16:14,945
Yes Stephanie, wait, speak louder...
- Come on,

911
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:16,082
- What the cops!?
- have a drink

912
01:16:18,388 --> 01:16:21,435
- Well, ok, let them come up, yeah

913
01:16:22,806 --> 01:16:28,476
Police want to see you,
They're coming up

914
01:16:38,982 --> 01:16:42,916
- Hello,
- Hello Octave, Mrs and Mr. Lacase

915
01:16:42,917 --> 01:16:44,572
on the phone, Sophie's parents

916
01:16:44,573 --> 01:16:45,777
- Oh hi, how are you?

917
01:16:45,778 --> 01:16:50,597
- Inspector Parretti. We come for
Octave Parengo and Charly

918
01:16:50,598 --> 01:16:52,956
- We heard your messages,
on Sophie's mobile phone

919
01:16:52,957 --> 01:16:56,169
and we don't really understand

920
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:58,476
Our daughter commited suicide,
Octave

921
01:16:58,477 --> 01:16:59,477
- Wanted for murder

922
01:17:02,808 --> 01:17:05,697
- it's because of you,
She commited suicide in Senegal

923
01:17:05,698 --> 01:17:09,041
with her friend, Marc,
you understand?

924
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:11,968
She fired a gun's bullet in her face, Octave
- I understand

925
01:17:20,184 --> 01:17:22,363
- It's better. Can I
call you back later?

926
01:17:22,364 --> 01:17:24,330
Cuz I'm here at
a meeting now,

927
01:17:24,365 --> 01:17:27,099
I can't really answer you.
I'll call you back on Tuesday,

928
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:31,236
ok? Kisses...
- Octave you're fired!

929
01:17:31,237 --> 01:17:34,670
- Now it's too late, it had to be
done earlier, I'm sorry...

930
01:17:34,671 --> 01:17:37,086
- This boy is a real shit

931
01:17:37,087 --> 01:17:40,121
- what are you doing here?
- I quit my life, by myself!

932
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:41,722
- Get him! he's buggering off!

933
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,814
- Wait, it's ok, it's ok
- Get him!

934
01:17:46,793 --> 01:17:48,667
- it's alright

935
01:17:53,417 --> 01:17:55,713
- I've an idea, I'm gonna...

936
01:17:56,314 --> 01:17:57,714
- You stay here!

937
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:34,214
- It's locked!

938
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:53,684
- Tamara, Alfred,
Alfred Dulère,

939
01:18:53,685 --> 01:18:56,542
Tell-me, would you fancy
a small dinner at the silver tower,

940
01:18:56,543 --> 01:19:00,587
one of these evenings?
And I have a little surprise for you

941
01:19:03,657 --> 01:19:05,331
- Put your gun away

942
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,260
- Parengo don't mess up!

943
01:19:12,824 --> 01:19:16,631
Come back Parengo!
Don't do it, I tell you!

944
01:19:45,216 --> 01:19:47,724
Give me your hand,
stop that!

945
01:20:17,201 --> 01:20:22,098
Everything is temporary:
Love, Art, planet Earth

946
01:20:22,099 --> 01:20:24,417
You, me

947
01:20:25,418 --> 01:20:26,706
particulary me.

948
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:45,216
PROJECTION TEST
You're part of a pre-test panel

949
01:20:45,217 --> 01:20:49,442
Option END n°2

950
01:20:57,493 --> 01:21:01,502
- Octave, fuck, I am in a mid-bad,
an enormous bad... I'm not fine at all

951
01:21:01,503 --> 01:21:06,814
- Yes good evening, do you want
champagne? Amuse la bouche?

952
01:21:07,924 --> 01:21:09,168
- Thanks madam

953
01:21:10,369 --> 01:21:12,535
- I didn't come here to croak with you,

954
01:21:12,536 --> 01:21:16,092
There's a little girl waiting for me
in Morocco. All I do is for her.

955
01:21:17,633 --> 01:21:18,697
- What's that?

956
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:22,983
- Vomit. You both swallowed
that shit together

957
01:21:29,827 --> 01:21:31,983
- You puked on yourselves

958
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:47,890
- Fuck, Octave, I believed
we had killed people

959
01:21:47,891 --> 01:21:51,296
I believed we were pursued by the cops,
I was really scared, no joke...

960
01:21:51,297 --> 01:21:54,453
- Me too
- Come here

961
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:09,530
At this instant, we were beautiful inside
but pitiful outside...

962
01:22:15,951 --> 01:22:18,130
- Stop laughing! Fuck!

963
01:22:21,197 --> 01:22:24,825
Deep inside us, very deeply,
it was a new birth

964
01:22:25,662 --> 01:22:28,092
The universe was offering
us a second chance

965
01:22:29,688 --> 01:22:31,478
- Thank you
- And, there is your bag...

966
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:33,378
- No, that's fine, I'll take it,
thank you

967
01:22:44,128 --> 01:22:49,077
Dulère had to be blasted...
Then I'd disappear, very quickly

968
01:22:49,078 --> 01:22:51,913
To help me transmit the commercial,
I contacted the AAF guys,

969
01:22:51,914 --> 01:22:56,269
the Anti-Ads Front, a small secret activist
group, Charly dug out on the internet

970
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:58,468
- You behave exactely like them, here...
Watch out Seb...

971
01:22:58,469 --> 01:22:59,470
- Like them, Why?

972
01:22:59,471 --> 01:23:01,958
- Excuse me to tell you that, but you
do verbal marketing here

973
01:23:01,959 --> 01:23:04,310
- Wait, I'm doing verbal marketing?!
You know what you're saying here?

974
01:23:04,311 --> 01:23:06,817
- A terrorist attack should be tried

975
01:23:06,818 --> 01:23:10,393
Like Hud, he had gotten a good job,
at the Channel 1 Ad section

976
01:23:10,394 --> 01:23:12,550
It's him who broadcasted
the film.

977
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:20,922
Here it is, Octave is dead,
and so is his car

978
01:23:42,454 --> 01:23:46,830
But I couldn't leave this world,
without savouring my victory

979
01:23:56,926 --> 01:23:58,066
- Excuse me president...

980
01:23:58,094 --> 01:24:03,933
Yes? Well, ok, of course...

981
01:24:04,866 --> 01:24:07,208
Can you turn on the television
on the first channel?

982
01:24:07,246 --> 01:24:08,494
- My pleasure, sir

983
01:24:08,495 --> 01:24:11,412
- It's good, we're watching
- Here it is, thank you

984
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:13,402
It will be awesome,
director!

985
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:18,799
We'll rip the other agencies up!

986
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,854
Tests are super positives,
I think we can say it

987
01:24:21,889 --> 01:24:27,486
- Yes my dear
- Finally, they're friendly,

988
01:24:27,487 --> 01:24:30,704
and we live for great things

989
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:40,105
- Look my dear, I think
it's going to begin

990
01:25:18,419 --> 01:25:22,011
- Sorry... I feel stupid, I'll do it again
- Hello, here is Starlight

991
01:25:22,012 --> 01:25:25,218
A new diet yoghurt that's strictly
without any relevance

992
01:25:27,196 --> 01:25:29,444
So why are we trying
to sell it to you?

993
01:25:29,445 --> 01:25:33,312
Because we've got goals...
We have numbers to make

994
01:25:33,313 --> 01:25:35,713
What did you think?
You think we're having fun, here?

995
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:37,793
- You know how much it costs to
buy 30 seconds of people's brains?

996
01:25:37,794 --> 01:25:40,171
Who's watching TV at this hour?
400.000 French

997
01:25:40,172 --> 01:25:42,735
So how do we do it all?
With what do we pay for all this?

998
01:25:42,736 --> 01:25:44,436
And our executives,
how do we pay them?

999
01:25:44,437 --> 01:25:47,318
Wait, our CEO for example,
whose salary is nearly a closed secret

1000
01:25:47,319 --> 01:25:49,320
Burkina Faso PIB, eh?

1001
01:25:49,321 --> 01:25:50,971
What do we pay him with?
Where do we find the cash?

1002
01:25:50,972 --> 01:25:52,728
And our shareholders?
The investors?

1003
01:25:52,729 --> 01:25:55,288
How do we do it? How do we?
How do we?

1004
01:25:55,323 --> 01:25:56,448
- Fuck, that's disgusting!

1005
01:25:56,449 --> 01:25:59,435
So now, turn your lil' TV off,
take your lil' coin holder,

1006
01:25:59,436 --> 01:26:01,160
and go directly to the
supermarket to buy off the stocks

1007
01:26:01,161 --> 01:26:03,181
12,000 tons are to be gobbled up!

1008
01:26:30,433 --> 01:26:34,863
Madone. Buy it, otherwise
it won't sell up

1009
01:26:34,864 --> 01:26:37,365
Who is slim in his head?

1010
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,262
- Anyway, we can't say you give
your customers shit...

1011
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:30,611
I was savouring my revolution,
I was disappearing... Far

1012
01:27:34,131 --> 01:27:35,680
learn to live differently

1013
01:27:38,131 --> 01:27:40,410
My friend Pyjamaman told
me about the jungle

1014
01:35:32,056 --> 01:35:36,689
Each year, the world-wide budget

1015
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:39,491
spent on advertising
exceeds 500 billion dollars.

1016
01:35:39,584 --> 01:35:42,299
An UN study estimates that
only 10% of that amount

1017
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:47,100
would be necessary to reduce starvation
in the world by a half
