1
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,471
Hi, sis.

2
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:19,782
Michael, if I could just get you
to sign this right here...

3
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:24,982
...which gives you the contents
of the safe deposit box.

4
00:01:27,473 --> 00:01:30,590
Thank you.
And this one which clears the bank...

5
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,711
...of all responsibility
for the contents.

6
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:35,227
It's kind of exciting.

7
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:39,785
Maybe we'll find out
that your mother had secret millions.

8
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:43,349
Why don't we get started?
Your mother is interred...

9
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:48,348
...at the Cedar Heights Funeral Home
until arrangements can be made.

10
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:50,545
I thought it was arranged.

11
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:52,465
-There's a problem.
-What problem?

12
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:57,025
Your mother left explicit instructions
to be cremated.

13
00:01:57,273 --> 00:02:01,061
-I don't understand it either.
-When did she decide this?

14
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:03,622
Apparently just before her death.

15
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:07,502
-I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
-Lots of people do.

16
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,428
Nobody in my family did.
Dad bought plots at Prairie Hills...

17
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,789
...one for him, one for Mom.

18
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:17,264
-The will clearly states...
-I don't care what it says.

19
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:21,665
Maybe Mom was delirious. Maybe
she didn't know what she was saying.

20
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:26,185
If she wanted to be cremated, why
the hell did she let Dad buy 2 plots?

21
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,185
She was very specific.

22
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:32,148
She wanted her ashes to be thrown off
Roseman Bridge.

23
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:33,985
-What?!
-Bizarre!

24
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:36,952
Mr. Peterson, are you sure
Mom wrote all this?

25
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:40,708
It was notarized and witnessed by
Mrs. Lucy Delaney.

26
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,944
-Maybe you could ask her.
-Who the hell is she?

27
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:45,184
I remember her, I just don't...

28
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:49,906
I don't care if it's legal. We're
not cremating her or throwing...

29
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:53,384
...her ashes off some bridge
where we can't visit her...

30
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,101
...because she'll be blown all over!

31
00:02:56,513 --> 00:03:01,348
-And people driving all over her, dogs...
-We're not doing it.

32
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:03,909
I'm not even sure
it's Christian.

33
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:07,111
Maybe it's an Italian thing.
She was Italian.

34
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,230
Doesn't matter!

35
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:11,101
Move on.

36
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:13,503
We can come back to this.

37
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:16,062
Why don't we open the box?

38
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,024
Michael, look at these.

39
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:50,783
Have you ever seen these pictures?

40
00:03:57,393 --> 00:04:00,191
It was in this envelope from 1965.

41
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,391
She's not wearing a bra.

42
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,188
That's the Holliwell Bridge.

43
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:14,262
-In case anyone's interested.
-Why are there 2 deeds here?

44
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:18,582
This is for the additional acres
he purchased in’59.

45
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:21,472
And this?

46
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:26,590
Those were bills of sale
from equipment your mother sold.

47
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:38,429
-This is for the original land parcel.
-Beautiful picture of her.

48
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,672
What?

49
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:51,348
Could you come here for a minute?

50
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:53,428
What?

51
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,152
Where are we going?

52
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:08,986
She say anything in there about me?
About leaving me anything?

53
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,951
No.

54
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:17,307
What's going on?

55
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:24,502
We were just wondering
if it might be better...

56
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:28,268
...if Carolyn and I
looked at this stuff ourselves.

57
00:05:28,513 --> 00:05:31,073
We don't want to keep you
waiting around.

58
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:36,350
I'll contact your office
about the legal work.

59
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:39,342
"I struggle to...

60
00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:43,986
...put it together in a way
that allows me to continue...

61
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:47,384
...knowing that we're
on separate roads.

62
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:55,869
But then, I look through the lens
of my camera and you're there.

63
00:05:56,113 --> 00:06:00,868
I start to write an article
and I find myself writing it to you.

64
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:05,506
It's clear to me now that we
have been moving towards each other...

65
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:08,392
...towards those 4 days,
all of our lives."

66
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:11,352
I don't want to hear anymore.
Burn the damn thing.

67
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:13,265
I don't want to hear it.

68
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:15,272
Throw it away.

69
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:21,786
What's he saying now?

70
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:26,823
He just goes on about how
if Mom ever needed him...

71
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:31,669
...she could reach him through the
National Geographic Magazine in D.C.

72
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,224
He was a photographer.

73
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:38,063
He promises not to write again.

74
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:41,273
And then, all it says is:

75
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,628
"I love you, Robert."

76
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,586
Robert!

77
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:49,426
Jesus!

78
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:51,701
I'll kill him.

79
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:56,391
That would be some trick. He's dead.
That's what this letter is...

80
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,271
...from his attorney.

81
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,267
He left most of his things to Mom.

82
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:05,631
And requested...

83
00:07:08,073 --> 00:07:09,267
What?

84
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:14,865
That he be cremated and his ashes
thrown off Roseman Bridge.

85
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:19,861
Damn him! I knew Mom
wouldn't have thought that up herself.

86
00:07:20,353 --> 00:07:23,629
It was some damn perverted...

87
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:26,990
...photographic mind influencing her.

88
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,871
When did the bastard die?

89
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:30,381
'82.

90
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:33,584
Wait a minute, that was...

91
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,190
...3 years after Daddy...
Do you think...?

92
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:40,072
I don't know!
I'm completely in the dark.

93
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:42,190
That's what I get for moving away.

94
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:44,310
We were kids when this happened.

95
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:47,505
I can't believe it.

96
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:52,632
Do you think that she...

97
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,591
...had sex with him?

98
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:59,506
Must be nice inside your head
with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.

99
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:02,506
Don't talk to me like that.
She was my mother!

100
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:05,187
Now I find that she was...
She was a...

101
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,071
A what?
Don't say that!

102
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:09,269
What am I supposed to think?

103
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:17,108
I can't believe she never told me.

104
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:21,467
We spoke at least once a week.
How could she do that?

105
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:24,147
When did she meet him?
Did Dad know?

106
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:27,306
Is there anything else in that envelope?

107
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:29,624
No, I don't think so.

108
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:10,592
You read it.

109
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,352
You read it.

110
00:09:26,593 --> 00:09:29,153
"January, 1987.

111
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:32,786
Dear Carolyn:

112
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:35,668
I hope you read this with Michael.

113
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:39,870
I'm sure he wouldn't be able
to read it by himself...

114
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,866
...and he'll need help
understanding all this.

115
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,866
First and most of all...

116
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:01,263
...I love you both very much.

117
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:04,744
And although I feel fine,
I thought I'd put my affairs...

118
00:10:04,993 --> 00:10:06,665
...excuse that word, in order."

119
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:09,222
I can't believe she's making jokes.

120
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:11,941
"After going through
the safe deposit box...

121
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:15,390
...I'm sure you'll find your way
to this letter.

122
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:18,352
It's hard to write this
to my own children.

123
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:22,142
I could let this die
with the rest of me, I suppose.

124
00:10:22,553 --> 00:10:24,589
But as one gets older...

125
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,028
...one's fears subside.

126
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:30,427
What becomes more and more important...

127
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:32,752
...is to be known.

128
00:10:33,193 --> 00:10:36,503
Known for all that you were
during this brief stay.

129
00:10:36,753 --> 00:10:39,142
How sad it seems to leave this earth...

130
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:44,148
...without those you love the most
ever really knowing who you were.

131
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:48,387
It's easy for a mother to love
her children, no matter what.

132
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:51,193
I don't know
if it's as simple for children.

133
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:55,346
You're all so busy being angry
at us for raising you wrong.

134
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:04,988
His name was Robert Kincaid.

135
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:08,903
He was a photographer
and he was here in 1965...

136
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:11,189
...shooting a National Geographic
article...

137
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:14,152
...on the covered bridges
of Madison County.

138
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:17,783
Remember when we got that issue,
when we got the subscription...

139
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:20,627
...how we felt like celebrities?"

140
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:30,224
That's Roseman Bridge.

141
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:38,862
That must be Robert Kincaid.

142
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:43,828
And that's Mom's medallion.

143
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:52,266
"I don't want you to be angry with him.

144
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:57,428
I hope after you know the story,
you think well of him, even grateful."

145
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:01,586
-Grateful?
-"It's all there in the 3 notebooks."

146
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:13,142
"It was the week
of the Illinois State Fair.

147
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:17,428
The two of you were going
with Dad to exhibit...

148
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:20,701
...Carolyn's prize steer.

149
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:26,983
It was the Sunday night you left.
I know it sounds awful..."

150
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,383
But I couldn't wait for you to leave.

151
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,863
You were going to be gone until Friday.

152
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:34,065
4 days.

153
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:36,190
Just 4 days.

154
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:58,549
Richard! Dinner!

155
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:10,024
-What I tell you about the door?
-Sorry.

156
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:26,944
Would you like to say grace?

157
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:28,992
Grace.

158
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:40,466
More sauces.

159
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:50,546
A piece of bread.

160
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:53,468
Thanks.

161
00:14:27,673 --> 00:14:29,152
Damn drawer.

162
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:31,668
Here.

163
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:35,590
You can't get mad at it.

164
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:37,745
Sorry. Didn't mean to yell.

165
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,552
I want you to stay away
from anything too spicy.

166
00:14:43,353 --> 00:14:44,832
And you promise me.

167
00:14:45,113 --> 00:14:48,628
I swear. Only filters.
No more than half pack a day.

168
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:51,182
-I've got my orders.
-Doc Reynolds said so.

169
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,344
I know, I'm only kidding.

170
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:56,790
-Are you sure you don't want to go?
-I'm positive.

171
00:14:58,153 --> 00:15:00,826
What are you going to do
as a woman of leisure?

172
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:04,906
Same thing I do as a hired hand,
except with less help.

173
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:10,263
I won't be able to sleep. I can't sleep
without you next to me anymore.

174
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:11,992
It's only 4 days.

175
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,782
Oh, God, where have you been?

176
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:04,862
You missed them.
They already left.

177
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:09,386
Why do you love me so much?
I don't like you.

178
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:11,112
Get down.

179
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:16,871
You like that song?

180
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:23,705
It's just you and me.

181
00:16:25,913 --> 00:16:27,426
Just you and me.

182
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:02,988
Hi.

183
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:06,945
I get the distinct feeling
that I'm lost.

184
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,704
You supposed to be in Iowa?

185
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:14,264
Then you're not that lost.

186
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:18,630
I'm looking for a bridge.

187
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:21,785
One of those covered bridges
in this neighborhood.

188
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:23,421
Roseman Bridge?

189
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,987
That's it.

190
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:30,941
You're pretty close.
It's only about 2 miles from here.

191
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,861
Which way?

192
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:42,143
You go that way and come to Cutter's
and turn left.

193
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:44,431
To Cutters?

194
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,991
Cutter's a farm.
Small house, close to the road.

195
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:50,985
Big, mean yellow dog.

196
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:53,344
Mean yellow dog. Okay.

197
00:17:55,113 --> 00:18:00,141
Then you go along that road
until you come to a fork.

198
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:03,107
It's only...
Less than half a mile.

199
00:18:04,873 --> 00:18:07,023
And then where, after the fork?

200
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:11,147
The right.

201
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:12,867
And then you...

202
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,348
No, no. Not that fork.
Excuse me.

203
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,147
You pass Peterson's.

204
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:21,702
Peterson's.

205
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,224
Peterson's is a farm.

206
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:28,785
Past the old schoolhouse, you turn left.
It'd be easier to tell you...

207
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:30,785
...if the roads were marked.

208
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,950
It certainly would.

209
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:36,783
I can take you if you want.

210
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,392
Or I can tell you.

211
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:41,625
I can take you
or tell you.

212
00:18:41,873 --> 00:18:44,262
It's up to you.
I don't care.

213
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:47,502
I wouldn't want to take you away.

214
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:51,982
No, I was just going to have
some iced tea, and then...

215
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:54,508
...split the atom,
but that can wait.

216
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:56,987
Okay.

217
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:58,825
I'll just get my shoes.

218
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:33,907
I wasn't exactly expecting company.

219
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:46,471
Where are we headed?

220
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,309
Out. Then right.

221
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:50,622
Out...

222
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:52,392
...then right.

223
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:17,031
Wonderful smell to Iowa. Kind of
particular to this part of the country.

224
00:20:17,273 --> 00:20:18,626
You know what I mean?

225
00:20:19,473 --> 00:20:20,428
No.

226
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:26,948
It's kind of hard to explain.
I guess it's in the loam of the soil.

227
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:31,182
That kind of rich, earthy...

228
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:34,307
...alive...
Well, maybe not alive.

229
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:35,912
You don't smell it?

230
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:40,550
Maybe it's because I live here.

231
00:20:40,913 --> 00:20:42,505
Yeah, I guess so.

232
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,585
Smells great though.

233
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:58,069
Are you from Washington?

234
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:01,911
I lived there till I was in my mid-20s.

235
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:04,542
I moved to Chicago
when I got married.

236
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:08,666
When did you move back?

237
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:10,711
After the divorce.

238
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:19,264
How long have you been married?

239
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:28,861
Long time.

240
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,225
Long time, huh?

241
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:36,387
Where are you from?
Do you mind me asking?

242
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:40,182
I don't mind your asking.
I'm from...

243
00:21:40,873 --> 00:21:44,183
-I'm born in Italy.
-Italy?

244
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:49,663
From Italy to Iowa.
Where in Italy?

245
00:21:51,673 --> 00:21:54,665
We lived in a small town
on the eastern side.

246
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,585
No one's heard of it.
Bari.

247
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:00,826
I know Bari.

248
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:08,184
I was on assignment to Greece...

249
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:11,106
...and I went through Bari
to get to Brindisi.

250
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:15,230
I was looking out,
it looked like pretty country.

251
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:18,033
So I got off the train
and stayed a few days.

252
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:22,147
You got off the train
because it looked pretty?

253
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:27,752
Yeah, I did.

254
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:31,062
Excuse me.

255
00:22:45,153 --> 00:22:46,666
Care for a cigarette?

256
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,830
Sure, I'll have one.

257
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,906
So tell me, how long
have you lived in Iowa?

258
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:13,065
Long.
You just got off the train...

259
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:16,032
...and stayed
without knowing anyone there?

260
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:33,707
That's it.

261
00:23:35,353 --> 00:23:36,945
It's beautiful.

262
00:23:38,473 --> 00:23:40,191
Yeah, this is great.

263
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:03,066
I won't shoot this today.
I'll just do a little prep work.

264
00:24:03,313 --> 00:24:06,350
Shoot it tomorrow.
The light's no good right now.

265
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:10,583
So I'll just wait.

266
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,107
I don't mind.

267
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,950
Go on down here.

268
00:24:16,553 --> 00:24:19,545
This is about as good a place
to start as any.

269
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:25,705
Beautiful bridge.

270
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,869
Beautiful.
You out here much?

271
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:50,188
No.

272
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:38,104
Always this hot around here?

273
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:42,462
Oh, yes. This time of year.

274
00:25:50,153 --> 00:25:53,350
There's some sodas in the truck
if you'd like one.

275
00:25:54,673 --> 00:25:57,665
-Would you like one?
-Not right now.

276
00:25:57,913 --> 00:25:59,312
I'll go get one.

277
00:26:54,193 --> 00:26:55,467
There you are.

278
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,432
You caught me.

279
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:03,228
I was picking you some flowers.

280
00:27:07,673 --> 00:27:10,949
Men still do that, don't they?
I'm not out of date, am I?

281
00:27:11,193 --> 00:27:14,071
Picking flowers
as a sign of appreciation?

282
00:27:14,313 --> 00:27:16,383
No, except those are poisonous.

283
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:21,791
I'm kidding!
I'm sorry.

284
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:24,350
I'm just kidding.

285
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:28,111
I'm so sorry.

286
00:27:30,793 --> 00:27:33,307
Are you sadistic by nature or what?

287
00:27:35,393 --> 00:27:37,145
I don't know why I did that.

288
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:40,111
-Here.
-They're beautiful.

289
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:44,432
I'm sorry.

290
00:27:50,913 --> 00:27:55,031
You're looking for something specific?
There's not much selection.

291
00:27:55,393 --> 00:27:59,591
I had a station out of Chicago earlier.
Played good blues.

292
00:28:00,393 --> 00:28:02,031
It's 1410.

293
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:08,952
That's nice.

294
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:13,751
Care for another cigarette?

295
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:16,707
Sure.

296
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,705
Is that the mean yellow dog?

297
00:28:30,313 --> 00:28:32,463
-Is it white?
-No, it's yellow.

298
00:28:43,873 --> 00:28:47,149
I want to thank you for all
your kindness, Mrs. Johnson.

299
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:48,872
Francesca.

300
00:28:50,593 --> 00:28:51,708
Robert.

301
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:02,429
Would you like some iced tea?

302
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:05,588
Yeah.

303
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:16,151
Now I'm alone with you

304
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:22,712
Yes, sit down.

305
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,862
-You like lemon?
-Sure.

306
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:34,662
Maybe...

307
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:36,546
...a little bit of sugar?

308
00:29:36,793 --> 00:29:37,828
You bet.

309
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:50,304
If you want more...

310
00:29:52,393 --> 00:29:53,382
Thanks.

311
00:29:58,353 --> 00:30:00,548
Aren't you afraid to have those in here?

312
00:30:04,593 --> 00:30:07,551
I'm so sorry I did that.
I don't know why...

313
00:30:07,793 --> 00:30:09,385
...why I said that.

314
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:15,669
Where are you staying?

315
00:30:17,193 --> 00:30:19,468
Some place with small cabins.

316
00:30:19,753 --> 00:30:21,505
Something or other motor inn.

317
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,426
I've got it written down,
but I haven't checked in yet.

318
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:31,103
And how long are you here for?

319
00:30:33,193 --> 00:30:36,788
I don't know, maybe 4 or 5 days,
a week on the outside.

320
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:40,548
As long as it takes to do the work.
Where's your family?

321
00:30:40,793 --> 00:30:43,512
My husband took the kids
to the state fair.

322
00:30:43,753 --> 00:30:46,426
My daughter is entering a prize steer.

323
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:48,541
How old?

324
00:30:49,353 --> 00:30:50,672
A year and a half.

325
00:30:51,113 --> 00:30:52,546
No, I meant the kids.

326
00:30:54,993 --> 00:30:58,668
Michael is 17.
And Carolyn is 16.

327
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:01,668
That's nice, having kids.

328
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:06,189
They're not kids anymore.

329
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:10,186
Things change.

330
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:12,871
They always do.

331
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:15,071
One of the laws of nature.

332
00:31:16,113 --> 00:31:19,389
Most people are afraid of change,
but if you look at it...

333
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:22,864
...as something you can count on,
then it can be a comfort.

334
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:27,153
There's not many things
you can really count on.

335
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:28,747
I guess.

336
00:31:29,873 --> 00:31:32,706
I'm one of those people
it frightens, I think.

337
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,621
I doubt that.

338
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:38,591
Why do you say that?

339
00:31:39,473 --> 00:31:42,749
From Italy to Iowa,
that's a big change.

340
00:31:45,193 --> 00:31:47,707
But Richard was in the Army there.

341
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:50,952
I met him
when I was living in Naples.

342
00:31:51,193 --> 00:31:53,388
I didn't know anything about Iowa.

343
00:31:54,193 --> 00:31:56,753
I just cared that it was America...

344
00:31:57,993 --> 00:32:00,268
...and, of course,
being with Richard.

345
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:02,627
What's he like?

346
00:32:04,113 --> 00:32:05,865
He's very clean.

347
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:07,787
Clean?

348
00:32:08,953 --> 00:32:10,511
No. I mean...

349
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:12,866
He's other things too.

350
00:32:14,793 --> 00:32:16,545
He's a very hard worker...

351
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:17,828
...very caring...

352
00:32:18,073 --> 00:32:19,267
...honest.

353
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:21,507
He's gentle.

354
00:32:21,753 --> 00:32:23,311
He's a good father.

355
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:25,147
And clean.

356
00:32:27,793 --> 00:32:29,385
Clean.

357
00:32:35,113 --> 00:32:38,185
And you like living here in Iowa,
I guess?

358
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,586
Go ahead.
I'm not going to tell anyone.

359
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:53,664
I'm supposed to say:

360
00:32:53,913 --> 00:32:58,668
"It's just fine. It's quiet
and the people are real nice."

361
00:32:58,913 --> 00:33:01,507
And all that's true.
Mostly.

362
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,312
It is quiet.

363
00:33:03,953 --> 00:33:06,023
And the people are nice.

364
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:08,271
In certain ways.

365
00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:10,949
We all help each other out.

366
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:14,503
If someone gets sick or hurt,
all the neighbors come in.

367
00:33:14,753 --> 00:33:18,871
They pick the corn, harvest the oats
or whatever needs to be done.

368
00:33:19,273 --> 00:33:23,744
In town, you can leave your car
unlocked, and let the kids run around.

369
00:33:23,993 --> 00:33:25,346
Don't worry about them.

370
00:33:26,793 --> 00:33:28,670
There are a lot of nice...

371
00:33:28,913 --> 00:33:30,744
...things about the people here.

372
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:33,223
And I respect them for those qualities.

373
00:33:38,473 --> 00:33:39,428
But...

374
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:41,188
But?

375
00:33:47,273 --> 00:33:49,070
It's not...

376
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:51,305
...what I dreamed of...

377
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,347
...as a girl.

378
00:34:02,993 --> 00:34:05,553
I scribbled something down
the other day.

379
00:34:06,313 --> 00:34:09,350
I often do that
when I'm out on the road.

380
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,470
Kind of goes like this:

381
00:34:12,753 --> 00:34:14,471
"The old dreams...

382
00:34:15,473 --> 00:34:17,065
...were good dreams.

383
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,670
They didn't work out,
but I'm glad I had them."

384
00:34:29,393 --> 00:34:32,908
I don't know what it means.
I thought I might use it someday.

385
00:34:37,913 --> 00:34:41,223
Anyway, I think I know how you feel.

386
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:49,670
Would you like to stay for dinner?

387
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:52,550
There's not much in town.

388
00:34:52,913 --> 00:34:55,143
And you'd have to eat alone.

389
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,912
So would I.

390
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,065
Yeah, I'd like that.

391
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:06,181
I don't get a home-cooked meal too often
out on the road.

392
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,262
Okay.

393
00:35:41,113 --> 00:35:42,831
This is ridiculous.

394
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,472
Do you mind
if I put some film in the fridge?

395
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:34,750
-No, go ahead.
-This heat out here isn't too forgiving.

396
00:36:41,793 --> 00:36:43,988
Anything I can do to help?

397
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,389
-To help? What, cook?
-Yeah, men cook.

398
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:50,985
Okay, sure.

399
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,112
What can I do?

400
00:36:57,353 --> 00:36:58,832
You can scrape the carrot.

401
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:00,552
Scrape the carrots.

402
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:03,023
And grate them.
Make a nice salad.

403
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:10,544
Scrape the carrots. Like that.
How's that?

404
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:12,749
Very good. Very nice.

405
00:37:12,993 --> 00:37:14,472
Not bad, huh?

406
00:37:19,793 --> 00:37:22,182
Don't forget to pick off the end.

407
00:37:24,593 --> 00:37:26,345
Pick off end.

408
00:37:32,953 --> 00:37:35,308
Let me get these...

409
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:38,909
Excuse me.
I can take the ends off of these too.

410
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:42,344
Yes. That's a good idea.

411
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:45,232
This the way you do it?

412
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,752
That's good.
But don't use your fingers.

413
00:37:49,753 --> 00:37:51,425
Then they smell like...

414
00:37:51,673 --> 00:37:53,391
I'll get you some lemon.

415
00:37:57,393 --> 00:37:58,985
Would you like a beer?

416
00:37:59,473 --> 00:38:02,067
-I've got some in the car.
-I would love a beer.

417
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,902
Anything to get out of a little work.

418
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:14,388
Very nice.

419
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:19,587
No, wait a second.
It gets better.

420
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:23,223
You must picture this:
I have 3 cameras around my neck...

421
00:38:23,473 --> 00:38:26,192
...and I've got a tripod,
and my pants are around my ankles.

422
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:29,869
I'm behind a bush, and then
suddenly I see this gorilla.

423
00:38:30,113 --> 00:38:32,388
A huge gorilla,
staring right at me...

424
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:35,705
...with the most lascivious look
you've ever seen.

425
00:38:35,953 --> 00:38:38,786
More than any creature
with that much hair.

426
00:38:39,793 --> 00:38:43,468
I freeze, because that's
what you're supposed to do.

427
00:38:44,473 --> 00:38:47,067
And then
it started coming towards me.

428
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:49,552
And what?

429
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:53,632
What?
My God!

430
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:55,107
I can't...

431
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,191
You're blushing.

432
00:38:57,433 --> 00:38:59,708
It's a very painful subject.
A very sore...

433
00:38:59,953 --> 00:39:02,183
...sore subject matter, really.

434
00:39:02,993 --> 00:39:04,949
-What happened?
-We became engaged.

435
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:18,545
You should really...

436
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:21,988
...write these stories down.

437
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:26,192
I would, except this is a female
gorilla. It had on eye shadow...

438
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:29,869
...and a little lip gloss on
and it was so nice...

439
00:39:30,113 --> 00:39:31,341
We still write.

440
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:36,149
I don't want
to put this stuff down.

441
00:39:37,553 --> 00:39:38,508
I'm afraid...

442
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:42,466
I'm afraid my writing's
a little too technical.

443
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:46,109
The trouble with being a
journalist too long is...

444
00:39:46,353 --> 00:39:48,947
...you stop allowing yourself
to invent.

445
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:52,421
I'll just stick to making pictures.

446
00:39:53,873 --> 00:39:55,511
Making pictures.

447
00:39:56,793 --> 00:39:58,192
I like that.

448
00:40:00,113 --> 00:40:02,308
You really love what you do.

449
00:40:03,953 --> 00:40:05,944
I'm obsessed by it, really.

450
00:40:07,353 --> 00:40:09,230
Why is that, do you think?

451
00:40:09,713 --> 00:40:11,032
I don't know.

452
00:40:11,273 --> 00:40:15,551
I don't think obsessions have reasons.
That's why they're obsessions.

453
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,785
You sound like an artist.

454
00:40:21,273 --> 00:40:22,831
I wouldn't say that.

455
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:26,190
National Geographic
likes their photos in focus...

456
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:30,472
...and not too much personal comment.
I don't mind really.

457
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:32,112
I'm no artist.

458
00:40:32,673 --> 00:40:36,666
That's one of the curses of being
too well-adjusted, too normal.

459
00:40:36,913 --> 00:40:39,029
I don't think you're so normal.

460
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:40,742
Really?

461
00:40:40,993 --> 00:40:43,143
I didn't mean it in the way...

462
00:40:43,393 --> 00:40:45,270
...in the way that it sounded.

463
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:50,943
We'll just chalk it up
to a compliment...

464
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:52,672
...and move on.

465
00:40:55,513 --> 00:40:57,390
Did you just love teaching?

466
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:03,861
Yes, when there was a particular student
who can make a difference...

467
00:41:06,193 --> 00:41:09,424
They're all supposed to, but they don't.
You tend...

468
00:41:09,673 --> 00:41:14,793
...to single out 1 or 2 who you think
you can contribute something to.

469
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:18,821
-And did you?
-I hope so. One went to medical school.

470
00:41:20,593 --> 00:41:21,912
Why'd you quit?

471
00:41:23,673 --> 00:41:25,868
My children, my kids.

472
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:27,945
And...

473
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:31,021
...Richard didn't like my working.

474
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:33,865
But you miss it, obviously.

475
00:41:34,393 --> 00:41:35,906
I never think about it.

476
00:41:36,153 --> 00:41:39,225
What's the most exciting place
that you've ever been?

477
00:41:41,113 --> 00:41:45,470
-Unless you're too tired to talk.
-Most exciting...

478
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:54,301
You're asking if a man's tired of
talking about himself? Been out much?

479
00:41:56,713 --> 00:41:59,227
Didn't mean to make
it sound like a dumb...

480
00:41:59,473 --> 00:42:01,623
Maybe it's a little dull for you...

481
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:05,263
...telling this to some housewife
in the middle of nowhere.

482
00:42:07,873 --> 00:42:10,512
This is your home.
This isn't nowhere.

483
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:15,032
And it's not dull.

484
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:19,592
Let's see.

485
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:27,663
I guess I'd say that the most exciting
place I've been to was Africa.

486
00:42:28,073 --> 00:42:29,870
Because it's another world.

487
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:33,230
It's not just the cultures
and the people.

488
00:42:33,473 --> 00:42:35,543
That's great, but it's the air.

489
00:42:35,793 --> 00:42:38,102
The colors from dawn to dusk.

490
00:42:38,353 --> 00:42:40,742
There's something tangible about it.

491
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:45,631
The cohabitation of man and beast,
and beast and beast.

492
00:42:45,873 --> 00:42:47,909
Who'll survive and who won't.

493
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:51,067
There's no judgment about it either.

494
00:42:51,313 --> 00:42:53,383
There's no imposed morality.

495
00:42:53,633 --> 00:42:56,101
It's just the way it is.

496
00:42:56,353 --> 00:42:58,423
It's beautiful, really.

497
00:43:01,473 --> 00:43:03,748
Just nothing like it.
It's...

498
00:43:03,993 --> 00:43:06,382
...a voyeur's paradise.

499
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:10,749
I'd love to see that.

500
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,825
There's safaris.
You can ask your husband.

501
00:43:20,113 --> 00:43:21,341
Yeah.

502
00:43:27,113 --> 00:43:30,423
It's a beautiful evening.
Would you like to take a walk?

503
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:39,110
You've got it all right here.

504
00:43:40,513 --> 00:43:44,745
I'm serious. This is as nice a place
as I've ever been.

505
00:43:49,073 --> 00:43:52,509
"The silver apples of the moon,
and the golden apples of the sun."

506
00:43:53,273 --> 00:43:56,709
Yeats.
"The Song of Wandering Aengus."

507
00:43:58,473 --> 00:44:00,782
-Good stuff, Yeats, huh?
-Yes.

508
00:44:01,033 --> 00:44:04,105
Realism,
economy, sensuousness...

509
00:44:05,273 --> 00:44:09,664
...beauty, and magic.
All that appeals to my Irish ancestry.

510
00:44:20,153 --> 00:44:23,543
-Something wrong?
-Would you like something to drink?

511
00:44:24,033 --> 00:44:25,307
Coffee?

512
00:44:25,553 --> 00:44:27,509
Maybe some brandy?

513
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,425
Maybe some both.

514
00:44:30,953 --> 00:44:32,181
Yes?

515
00:44:32,913 --> 00:44:34,107
Let's.

516
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:50,668
Sure you don't want me to help?

517
00:44:52,113 --> 00:44:56,948
No. I'm not going to wash them now.
I'll rinse them now. I'll do it later.

518
00:45:01,193 --> 00:45:02,785
Francesca.

519
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:07,261
You all right?

520
00:45:09,393 --> 00:45:10,587
Yeah.

521
00:45:16,553 --> 00:45:17,781
What?

522
00:45:20,073 --> 00:45:21,267
What?

523
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:24,749
We're not doing anything wrong.

524
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:28,028
Nothing you couldn't tell your kids.

525
00:45:43,673 --> 00:45:45,982
To ancient evenings and distant music?

526
00:46:13,033 --> 00:46:16,662
He's getting her drunk.
That's what happened.

527
00:46:17,073 --> 00:46:20,827
Maybe he forced himself.
That's why she couldn't tell us.

528
00:46:21,073 --> 00:46:22,825
He did not.

529
00:46:23,793 --> 00:46:29,390
-He's such a nice guy.
-Trying to sleep with somebody's wife?!

530
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:33,587
I don't think so.
And that doesn't make you a bad person.

531
00:46:34,153 --> 00:46:37,304
He reminds me of Steve in a way.
Steve's...

532
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:40,824
...weak, immoral and a liar,
but still a nice guy.

533
00:46:41,073 --> 00:46:42,825
He just shouldn't be married.

534
00:46:43,753 --> 00:46:45,311
At least not to me.

535
00:46:46,073 --> 00:46:49,145
I'm hungry.
Are you getting hungry?

536
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:56,863
I had no idea it's that bad, sis.

537
00:46:58,553 --> 00:47:02,910
Please, don't feel sorry for me.
Nobody's forcing me to stay.

538
00:47:03,233 --> 00:47:04,427
Why do you?

539
00:47:17,353 --> 00:47:20,789
-Do you mind if I ask you a question?
-No.

540
00:47:21,993 --> 00:47:23,631
Why did you get divorced?

541
00:47:25,193 --> 00:47:26,911
I was never around.

542
00:47:27,593 --> 00:47:30,471
So, why'd I get married?
That's a good question.

543
00:47:30,953 --> 00:47:34,150
I guess I needed a home base.
Roots.

544
00:47:35,033 --> 00:47:37,547
You can kind of get lost on the road.

545
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,346
So what happened?

546
00:47:40,073 --> 00:47:41,631
I never got lost.

547
00:47:41,873 --> 00:47:45,104
I was more at home everywhere
than just in one place.

548
00:47:45,393 --> 00:47:47,748
Kind of like a citizen of the world.

549
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:53,104
-Must get lonely sometimes.
-No. I never indulge in that.

550
00:47:53,753 --> 00:47:58,144
I've got friends all over the world
I can visit from time to time.

551
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:01,345
Women friends too?

552
00:48:05,993 --> 00:48:08,268
I'm a loner, but not a monk.

553
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:15,344
You really don't need anyone?

554
00:48:18,233 --> 00:48:19,905
I think I need everyone.

555
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:22,793
I love people.
I'd love to meet them all.

556
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:25,024
That's the thing about Iowa.

557
00:48:25,273 --> 00:48:28,549
You tend to meet the same
kind of person repeatedly.

558
00:48:28,793 --> 00:48:33,025
So when Mr. Delaney has an affair
with the Redfield woman...

559
00:48:33,273 --> 00:48:35,184
...the whole town wakes up.

560
00:48:36,553 --> 00:48:38,623
There's a lot of that going around.

561
00:48:39,353 --> 00:48:41,821
It seems to me there's too much of:

562
00:48:42,073 --> 00:48:44,507
..."This is mine"
and "He or she is mine."

563
00:48:44,753 --> 00:48:47,221
There's just too many lines being drawn.

564
00:48:48,393 --> 00:48:49,587
You know?

565
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:53,026
Doesn't it scare you though?
Being alone?

566
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:55,591
I don't think so.

567
00:48:56,873 --> 00:48:58,829
I think I embrace the mystery.

568
00:49:00,953 --> 00:49:02,591
Do you ever regret it?

569
00:49:03,593 --> 00:49:06,426
-What?
-The divorce, I mean.

570
00:49:07,313 --> 00:49:08,541
No.

571
00:49:09,993 --> 00:49:12,348
Do you ever regret
not having a family?

572
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:17,262
Not everyone's supposed to have one.

573
00:49:21,673 --> 00:49:25,632
How can you live for just what you want?
What about others?

574
00:49:27,153 --> 00:49:30,384
-I love other people.
-But no one in particular.

575
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,591
-But I love them just the same.
-It's not the same.

576
00:49:33,873 --> 00:49:36,068
I know it's not the same...

577
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,512
...but what you're saying is
it's not as good, it's not normal.

578
00:49:40,753 --> 00:49:42,072
That's not what I said.

579
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,669
I have a problem with
this American family ethic...

580
00:49:45,913 --> 00:49:48,791
...that seems to have hypnotized
the country.

581
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:52,867
You probably think of someone like me
as a displaced soul...

582
00:49:53,113 --> 00:49:58,028
...destined to wander the planet
with no TV or self-cleaning oven.

583
00:49:58,553 --> 00:50:03,069
Because someone decides to have a
family doesn't mean they're hypnotized.

584
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:09,503
Never having seen a gazelle stampede
doesn't mean I'm asleep in my life.

585
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:15,872
Want to leave your husband?

586
00:50:18,353 --> 00:50:20,742
No. Of course not.

587
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:23,992
I'm sorry about that.
I apologize for that.

588
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:25,871
What made you ask that?

589
00:50:26,113 --> 00:50:29,264
I thought that's what we were doing.
Asking questions.

590
00:50:29,513 --> 00:50:33,188
We were having a conversation.
But you ask me questions...

591
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:38,587
...reading these meanings into them
I must be too simple to interpret.

592
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:41,027
I'm sorry.

593
00:50:41,353 --> 00:50:42,468
I apologize.

594
00:50:48,153 --> 00:50:49,552
Roseman Bridge at dawn.

595
00:50:50,593 --> 00:50:52,265
I better be going.

596
00:50:53,393 --> 00:50:54,348
I'm sorry.

597
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:56,624
I apologize.
You must forgive me.

598
00:50:56,873 --> 00:50:59,626
That was a very indiscreet question.
It was...

599
00:50:59,873 --> 00:51:01,101
...dumb.

600
00:51:05,593 --> 00:51:07,663
I feel something's been spoiled.

601
00:51:07,913 --> 00:51:10,666
It was a perfect evening,
just the way it was.

602
00:51:18,153 --> 00:51:20,064
Perfect evening...

603
00:51:20,313 --> 00:51:21,746
...a nice walk.

604
00:51:22,233 --> 00:51:23,746
Thank you for the...

605
00:51:24,473 --> 00:51:26,384
...company and the brandy.

606
00:51:26,673 --> 00:51:28,868
You're a good woman, Francesca.

607
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:33,505
Keep the brandy forward in the cupboard.
It might work out after a while.

608
00:51:36,473 --> 00:51:38,668
And don't kid yourself, Francesca.

609
00:51:39,073 --> 00:51:40,950
You're anything but a simple woman.

610
00:51:58,153 --> 00:51:59,506
Johnson's.

611
00:51:59,913 --> 00:52:01,665
Richard, hi.

612
00:52:05,073 --> 00:52:07,109
Everyone settled in okay?

613
00:52:15,153 --> 00:52:16,711
I said, "good."

614
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:39,589
Hi, it's Robert Kincaid.

615
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,547
Hi.

616
00:56:44,553 --> 00:56:45,542
Got your note.

617
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:47,750
W.B. Yeats and all.

618
00:56:48,273 --> 00:56:52,266
I didn't read it right away
because the light was changing.

619
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:54,310
I had to get my shots.

620
00:56:54,553 --> 00:56:56,145
The light was changing.

621
00:56:56,433 --> 00:57:01,029
But I do accept your invitation.
It'll have to be later though.

622
00:57:01,273 --> 00:57:04,106
I'm going to the Holliwell Bridge
and shoot over there.

623
00:57:04,353 --> 00:57:06,230
After 9, how about that?

624
00:57:07,473 --> 00:57:09,464
Your work's what's important.

625
00:57:09,713 --> 00:57:12,671
I'll make something nice
we can warm up.

626
00:57:12,913 --> 00:57:15,950
Maybe you'd like to come along with me.

627
00:57:20,713 --> 00:57:22,943
Yes, I would like that, but I...

628
00:57:23,553 --> 00:57:27,228
I'll drive my pickup and meet you.
All right?

629
00:57:27,473 --> 00:57:29,782
-All right.
-What time?

630
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:31,989
How about 6?

631
00:57:33,513 --> 00:57:35,026
Okay.

632
00:57:35,593 --> 00:57:36,787
Great.

633
00:58:33,353 --> 00:58:36,868
-God, it's Lucy Redfield!
-Apparently Mrs. Delaney caught them.

634
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:45,544
There's a seat here,
if you'd like.

635
00:58:52,953 --> 00:58:54,147
Thank you.

636
00:59:14,393 --> 00:59:16,065
Kind of hot out, isn't it?

637
00:59:16,793 --> 00:59:17,782
Yeah.

638
00:59:20,873 --> 00:59:22,625
Are you ordering anything?

639
00:59:24,433 --> 00:59:25,707
No.

640
00:59:26,513 --> 00:59:28,708
Thanks.
I've changed my mind.

641
01:00:20,553 --> 01:00:22,111
How about this one?

642
01:00:28,113 --> 01:00:29,751
I don't know, I don't
know, I don't know.

643
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:32,905
I haven't bought a dress
for myself in so long.

644
01:00:33,873 --> 01:00:38,025
I'm just buying a dress.
It's not for a special occasion.

645
01:00:38,273 --> 01:00:41,026
I'm just shopping for
a new dress is all.

646
01:00:41,193 --> 01:00:42,865
That might work.

647
01:00:43,113 --> 01:00:46,867
And if he's still mad, tell him
you married him out of pity.

648
01:00:47,313 --> 01:00:49,110
That always works for me.

649
01:01:01,153 --> 01:01:02,791
Hi, it's Robert.

650
01:01:05,673 --> 01:01:09,507
Listen, I'm running a little late.
But I'll still...

651
01:01:09,793 --> 01:01:10,748
...be there.

652
01:01:10,993 --> 01:01:13,632
I don't want this
to sound the wrong way...

653
01:01:13,993 --> 01:01:16,461
...but I wonder
if this is a good idea.

654
01:01:18,553 --> 01:01:19,986
I had lunch in town.

655
01:01:20,233 --> 01:01:23,270
And I crossed paths
with that Redfield woman.

656
01:01:25,153 --> 01:01:27,269
I guess you got the whole story.

657
01:01:28,153 --> 01:01:30,951
The cashier at the grocery store
was most generous.

658
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:35,063
He's running for town crier next year.

659
01:01:35,313 --> 01:01:38,908
I know more about the Delaney affair
than I knew about my marriage.

660
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:43,545
If it's going to be a problem for you
to see me tonight, don't do so.

661
01:01:43,793 --> 01:01:46,705
I'm not too bright
about people's reactions.

662
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:51,071
I wouldn't want you to be put
in a compromising situation.

663
01:01:52,113 --> 01:01:54,024
Yeah, I understand.

664
01:01:56,073 --> 01:01:59,224
That's very kind of you
to think of that.

665
01:02:04,913 --> 01:02:05,948
Robert?

666
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:10,710
I want to come.

667
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:20,669
Okay? So I'll meet you at the bridge
like we planned...

668
01:02:20,913 --> 01:02:23,108
...and don't worry about the rest.

669
01:02:24,913 --> 01:02:26,141
I'm not.

670
01:02:27,633 --> 01:02:29,908
All right.
I'll see you then.

671
01:02:30,353 --> 01:02:31,627
Okay.

672
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,152
Beautiful here.

673
01:03:19,393 --> 01:03:22,624
Make yourself at home.
I have to knock off a few shots.

674
01:03:34,913 --> 01:03:36,710
Look at the butterfly.

675
01:04:11,673 --> 01:04:12,742
Got you!

676
01:04:17,433 --> 01:04:18,582
Come on.

677
01:04:19,553 --> 01:04:21,430
No, don't take my picture.

678
01:04:23,873 --> 01:04:25,784
Go ahead, give me a pose.

679
01:04:26,633 --> 01:04:28,863
One of those French model looks.

680
01:04:29,753 --> 01:04:31,823
-I can't.
-Like Gina Lollobrigida.

681
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:18,026
Can I help?

682
01:05:18,993 --> 01:05:21,427
No, I've got everything under control.

683
01:05:21,913 --> 01:05:23,665
I'm just going to go...

684
01:05:24,033 --> 01:05:27,184
...clean myself up a bit.
I'm going to take a bath.

685
01:05:27,433 --> 01:05:29,947
What happens if I set the table?

686
01:05:31,433 --> 01:05:33,469
That's fine. Sure.
Good.

687
01:05:33,713 --> 01:05:35,544
Would you like a beer...

688
01:05:35,793 --> 01:05:36,987
...for your bath?

689
01:05:39,273 --> 01:05:40,262
Yeah.

690
01:05:42,793 --> 01:05:44,431
That's nice.

691
01:05:45,473 --> 01:05:47,031
Dinner will be ready...

692
01:05:47,273 --> 01:05:48,831
...in half an hour.

693
01:06:06,913 --> 01:06:10,588
I realized that he had been
here just a few minutes before.

694
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:14,073
I was lying where the water
had run down his body...

695
01:06:14,313 --> 01:06:17,066
...and I found that intensely erotic.

696
01:06:18,033 --> 01:06:20,627
Almost everything
about Robert Kincaid...

697
01:06:20,873 --> 01:06:23,387
...had begun to seem erotic to me.

698
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:57,307
What's wrong?

699
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:10,428
You look stunning.
If you don't mind me saying so.

700
01:07:15,913 --> 01:07:19,383
Make-them-run-around-the-block-
howling-in-agony stunning.

701
01:08:04,793 --> 01:08:06,431
Hi, Madge.

702
01:08:08,353 --> 01:08:10,071
No, I was just...

703
01:08:10,313 --> 01:08:12,031
...fixing something to eat.

704
01:08:13,073 --> 01:08:14,426
No, what?

705
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,902
Yeah, I heard about him.

706
01:08:20,993 --> 01:08:23,985
I hear he's some kind of
photographer or something.

707
01:08:29,393 --> 01:08:31,145
Hippie? No.

708
01:08:31,393 --> 01:08:33,588
Is that what a hippie looks like?

709
01:08:36,753 --> 01:08:41,383
I was just going to step into a bath
when you called, so maybe...

710
01:08:42,273 --> 01:08:44,343
They don't get back till Friday.

711
01:08:46,673 --> 01:08:48,823
Maybe I'll call you then, okay?

712
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:35,393
If you want me to stop, tell me now.

713
01:10:44,513 --> 01:10:46,663
No one's asking you to.

714
01:12:43,953 --> 01:12:47,787
"He told me he wouldn't apologize
for what was going to happen."

715
01:12:48,313 --> 01:12:49,826
What's the matter?

716
01:12:53,553 --> 01:12:55,464
I'm going to get some air.

717
01:13:21,033 --> 01:13:23,069
Take me someplace.

718
01:13:23,793 --> 01:13:26,307
Right now. Take me someplace...

719
01:13:26,553 --> 01:13:28,032
...that you've been.

720
01:13:28,993 --> 01:13:31,553
Someplace on the other side
of the world.

721
01:13:34,393 --> 01:13:35,985
How about Italy?

722
01:13:38,513 --> 01:13:39,741
Yeah.

723
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:43,471
How about Bari?

724
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:47,112
Yeah.

725
01:13:51,073 --> 01:13:53,064
Tell me about that time...

726
01:13:53,953 --> 01:13:56,467
...you got off the train.

727
01:13:57,473 --> 01:13:59,225
You know the station.

728
01:14:01,313 --> 01:14:05,226
You know the little restaurant
with the striped awning...

729
01:14:05,633 --> 01:14:07,863
...serves arrancino.

730
01:14:09,073 --> 01:14:10,347
Arancino.

731
01:14:12,913 --> 01:14:15,746
And zeppoli.
I know that place.

732
01:14:16,593 --> 01:14:18,788
I had coffee there.

733
01:14:21,753 --> 01:14:22,947
Did you sit...

734
01:14:23,553 --> 01:14:28,229
...by the doorway
or near the front of the church?

735
01:14:29,113 --> 01:14:30,705
I was near the church.

736
01:14:33,433 --> 01:14:35,822
I know, I sat there once.

737
01:14:39,593 --> 01:14:41,185
I sat there once...

738
01:14:41,433 --> 01:14:44,152
...on a day like this.
It was very hot and...

739
01:14:46,993 --> 01:14:51,271
...I'd been shopping and I had
all these packages around my feet.

740
01:14:51,513 --> 01:14:53,424
I had to keep moving them.

741
01:15:02,193 --> 01:15:03,467
Then what?

742
01:15:22,153 --> 01:15:24,542
You make me forget my story.

743
01:15:33,193 --> 01:15:34,626
Lucky me.

744
01:15:39,313 --> 01:15:41,702
I had thoughts about him...

745
01:15:42,473 --> 01:15:44,589
...I hardly knew what to do with.

746
01:15:45,553 --> 01:15:47,509
And he read every one.

747
01:15:48,553 --> 01:15:49,952
Whatever I felt.

748
01:15:50,193 --> 01:15:52,787
Whatever I wanted,
he gave himself up to.

749
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:55,027
And in that moment...

750
01:15:55,273 --> 01:15:59,186
...everything I knew
to be true about myself, was gone.

751
01:16:00,073 --> 01:16:02,541
I was acting like another woman...

752
01:16:03,593 --> 01:16:06,710
...yet I was more myself
than ever before.

753
01:16:14,073 --> 01:16:16,826
We decided to spend Wednesday
away from Winterset...

754
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,950
...away from Madison County.

755
01:16:20,433 --> 01:16:23,425
Away from pastures and bridges
and people too familiar...

756
01:16:23,673 --> 01:16:25,903
...and reminders too painful.

757
01:16:26,713 --> 01:16:29,432
We let the day take us
where it wanted.

758
01:16:35,113 --> 01:16:37,627
Is that India?
It's beautiful.

759
01:16:38,793 --> 01:16:40,590
Look at this one.

760
01:16:41,593 --> 01:16:43,948
Look at their expressions.
Beautiful.

761
01:16:44,273 --> 01:16:46,468
As if the camera isn't on them.

762
01:16:48,073 --> 01:16:51,190
They're not photographs,
they're stories.

763
01:16:52,073 --> 01:16:54,871
You should publish these,
have your own collection.

764
01:16:56,753 --> 01:16:57,947
Nobody'd buy it.

765
01:16:58,193 --> 01:16:59,512
Why do you say that?

766
01:17:00,113 --> 01:17:02,832
6 publishers have told me so.

767
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:06,585
No big deal.

768
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,346
Whatever it is...

769
01:17:08,593 --> 01:17:11,869
...that makes an artist
look like one to the world...

770
01:17:12,113 --> 01:17:14,388
...is just a feature I don't have.

771
01:17:15,273 --> 01:17:18,390
Maybe you have to
convince yourself first.

772
01:17:18,633 --> 01:17:19,827
Maybe.

773
01:17:20,233 --> 01:17:23,782
Maybe you have to ask yourself
why it's an obsession.

774
01:17:24,233 --> 01:17:25,507
What's that?

775
01:17:27,593 --> 01:17:30,266
I had this the other night,
after you left.

776
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:33,022
It was made for me in Assisi.

777
01:17:34,033 --> 01:17:36,024
I got it for my 7th birthday.

778
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:39,825
"Francesca."

779
01:17:42,153 --> 01:17:43,142
Keep it.

780
01:18:08,633 --> 01:18:12,546
A musician friend of Robert's
told him of a place off the interstate.

781
01:18:12,993 --> 01:18:17,032
A place, Robert assured me,
no one I knew would see us.

782
01:19:16,913 --> 01:19:18,141
Thank you.

783
01:19:22,593 --> 01:19:24,072
Cheers.

784
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:35,628
What were you like as a young man?

785
01:19:36,553 --> 01:19:37,747
Trouble.

786
01:19:40,113 --> 01:19:42,707
-Why?
-I just wondered.

787
01:19:43,873 --> 01:19:45,591
Why were you trouble?

788
01:19:49,673 --> 01:19:51,231
I had a temper.

789
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,671
What were your mother and father like?

790
01:20:04,473 --> 01:20:06,987
I don't know if I can do this.

791
01:20:09,113 --> 01:20:10,068
What?

792
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:15,029
Try to cram in a whole lifetime
between now and Friday.

793
01:20:41,793 --> 01:20:44,546
For all we know

794
01:20:49,793 --> 01:20:53,308
We may never meet again

795
01:20:57,873 --> 01:21:00,387
Before you go

796
01:21:03,713 --> 01:21:07,183
Make this moment sweet again

797
01:21:13,233 --> 01:21:16,430
We won’t say good night

798
01:21:19,553 --> 01:21:22,750
Until the last note

799
01:21:29,553 --> 01:21:32,431
I'll hold out my hand

800
01:21:34,753 --> 01:21:37,904
And my heart will be in it

801
01:21:44,273 --> 01:21:46,833
For all we know

802
01:21:50,393 --> 01:21:53,624
This may only be a dream

803
01:22:25,633 --> 01:22:28,830
-Where'd you go?
-Bar in town.

804
01:22:30,593 --> 01:22:31,912
Did you call Betty?

805
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:35,512
Maybe you should.

806
01:22:36,593 --> 01:22:38,424
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.

807
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:42,432
Remember the Delaneys
from Hillcrest Road?

808
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:45,506
Yeah, but I thought she died.

809
01:22:46,353 --> 01:22:48,821
He remarried.
Lucy Redfield.

810
01:22:49,113 --> 01:22:52,071
Apparently, they were having an affair
for years.

811
01:22:52,313 --> 01:22:55,225
The first Mrs. Delaney
was a bit of a stiff.

812
01:22:56,033 --> 01:22:57,227
You mean...

813
01:22:57,873 --> 01:22:59,465
...she didn't like sex?

814
01:23:02,753 --> 01:23:04,311
Mom could have helped.

815
01:23:06,593 --> 01:23:08,072
Oh, boy!

816
01:23:11,313 --> 01:23:15,545
I've resented not living the wild life
in some place like Paris.

817
01:23:15,793 --> 01:23:18,182
I could have moved back to Iowa.

818
01:23:24,553 --> 01:23:25,827
Are you drunk?

819
01:23:30,713 --> 01:23:31,941
Not yet.

820
01:23:35,393 --> 01:23:37,304
Want to get out of here?

821
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,391
I think I better.

822
01:23:47,793 --> 01:23:49,545
I'll take the keys.

823
01:23:51,113 --> 01:23:52,512
I'm driving.

824
01:23:55,393 --> 01:24:00,626
I've never cheated on Betty.
Not once we were married, I mean.

825
01:24:01,753 --> 01:24:05,302
-Did you want to?
-Only about a thousand times.

826
01:24:08,673 --> 01:24:10,186
What do I do now?

827
01:24:12,513 --> 01:24:15,186
What's good enough for Mom
is good enough for me?

828
01:24:20,353 --> 01:24:21,911
What gets me...

829
01:24:22,953 --> 01:24:25,387
...is I'm in my forties.

830
01:24:25,753 --> 01:24:29,428
I've been in this crummy marriage
for over 20 years...

831
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:33,871
...because that's what I was taught.
You stick things out.

832
01:24:34,113 --> 01:24:37,105
I don't recall when he made love to me
so intensely...

833
01:24:37,353 --> 01:24:39,503
...that he sent me to Africa.

834
01:24:39,753 --> 01:24:42,267
Frankly, I don't think he ever did.

835
01:24:43,313 --> 01:24:47,989
Now I find out that in between
bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin.

836
01:24:48,233 --> 01:24:49,348
What about me?

837
01:24:49,953 --> 01:24:52,069
I feel really weird.

838
01:24:52,313 --> 01:24:55,703
Like she cheated on me, not Dad.
Isn't that sick?

839
01:24:56,033 --> 01:24:58,866
When you're the only son
you sort of feel...

840
01:24:59,113 --> 01:25:03,072
...like the prince of the kingdom.
In your mind, you think...

841
01:25:03,313 --> 01:25:06,828
...your mother shouldn't want sex,
because she has you.

842
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:10,184
You're right, that is sick.

843
01:25:13,313 --> 01:25:16,066
If she was so unhappy,
why didn't she leave?

844
01:25:30,273 --> 01:25:31,342
Can I...

845
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,021
...read it now?

846
01:25:38,513 --> 01:25:40,469
Did I miss anything important?

847
01:25:44,513 --> 01:25:47,107
She just took him to her room.

848
01:25:47,353 --> 01:25:48,832
Dad's room?

849
01:25:49,793 --> 01:25:53,263
All right, you can skip that part.
Let's just start...

850
01:25:53,513 --> 01:25:54,628
...here.

851
01:26:04,673 --> 01:26:07,107
"Robert lay asleep in the bed.

852
01:26:07,993 --> 01:26:10,063
I was up all night that night.

853
01:26:11,153 --> 01:26:13,064
What happens tomorrow?

854
01:26:13,953 --> 01:26:16,911
He will leave
and everything new and unknown...

855
01:26:17,153 --> 01:26:19,383
...that had become so familiar..."

856
01:26:19,713 --> 01:26:21,066
...would be gone.

857
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:39,826
Did you sleep well?

858
01:26:40,073 --> 01:26:41,222
Thanks.

859
01:26:42,553 --> 01:26:43,747
Good.

860
01:26:46,553 --> 01:26:48,783
-More coffee?
-Sure.

861
01:27:04,273 --> 01:27:07,583
I hope you don't mind my asking,
but I feel I should.

862
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:09,792
What?

863
01:27:13,873 --> 01:27:18,503
These women friends of yours
all over the world, how does it work?

864
01:27:19,753 --> 01:27:24,065
Do you see some of them again,
or do you forget others?

865
01:27:24,753 --> 01:27:27,870
Or do you write to some of them
now and then?

866
01:27:28,113 --> 01:27:31,310
-How do you manage it?
-What do you mean?

867
01:27:31,833 --> 01:27:36,668
I just need to know the procedure,
so I don't upset your routine.

868
01:27:37,193 --> 01:27:38,262
Want some jam?

869
01:27:40,153 --> 01:27:43,111
What are you talking about?
There's no routine.

870
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:45,191
Is that what you think this is?

871
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:47,911
Well, what is this?

872
01:27:51,393 --> 01:27:53,031
Is it up to me?

873
01:27:54,393 --> 01:27:57,703
You're married with no intent
to leave your husband.

874
01:27:58,033 --> 01:27:59,227
To do what?

875
01:27:59,473 --> 01:28:03,989
Go off with someone who needs everyone,
but no one in particular?

876
01:28:04,233 --> 01:28:06,872
What would be the point?
Pass the butter, please.

877
01:28:07,993 --> 01:28:09,904
I was honest with you.

878
01:28:12,073 --> 01:28:14,792
Yes. Absolutely!

879
01:28:15,673 --> 01:28:20,622
You have this habit of not needing,
and that's very hard to break.

880
01:28:24,073 --> 01:28:26,633
In that case, why sleep?
You don't need rest.

881
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:29,710
Why eat?
You don't need food.

882
01:28:30,313 --> 01:28:31,587
What're you doing?

883
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:34,667
I'm not cut out to be a world citizen...

884
01:28:34,913 --> 01:28:37,302
...who experiences
everything and nothing.

885
01:28:37,593 --> 01:28:39,504
How do you know
what I experience?

886
01:28:41,433 --> 01:28:42,786
I know you.

887
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:47,348
What can this possibly mean
to someone who doesn't need meaning...

888
01:28:47,593 --> 01:28:51,506
...who just goes with the mystery,
pretending he's not scared to death?

889
01:28:51,753 --> 01:28:53,232
Let's stop this right now!

890
01:28:53,513 --> 01:28:56,710
After you leave,
I'll have to sit here all my life...

891
01:28:56,953 --> 01:29:00,502
...and wonder what happened to me,
if anything.

892
01:29:01,593 --> 01:29:05,871
I'll have to wonder if you're in some
housewife's kitchen in Romania...

893
01:29:06,113 --> 01:29:10,982
...telling her of your world of good
friends, including me in that group.

894
01:29:11,353 --> 01:29:12,832
What should I say?

895
01:29:13,273 --> 01:29:17,152
I don't want you to say anything.
I don't need you to say anything.

896
01:29:17,473 --> 01:29:19,509
I want you to stop this now.

897
01:29:20,153 --> 01:29:21,506
Fine.

898
01:29:22,633 --> 01:29:25,705
More eggs? Or shall we fuck
on the linoleum one last time?

899
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:29,862
-I won't apologize for who I am.
-No one asked you to.

900
01:29:30,113 --> 01:29:34,425
-I won't feel like I did anything wrong.
-You won't feel, period!

901
01:29:34,673 --> 01:29:37,824
You've carved yourself a part
in the world as a voyeur...

902
01:29:38,073 --> 01:29:40,541
...a hermit, a lover
when you feel like it.

903
01:29:40,793 --> 01:29:45,867
The rest of us are supposed to feel
grateful for this...Go to hell!

904
01:29:46,273 --> 01:29:50,061
It isn't human not to be lonely
and afraid!

905
01:29:50,313 --> 01:29:52,543
You're a hypocrite and a phony!

906
01:29:53,553 --> 01:29:55,464
I don't want to need you.

907
01:29:56,273 --> 01:29:57,547
Why?

908
01:29:58,073 --> 01:30:00,382
Because I can't have you.

909
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:04,622
What difference does that make?

910
01:30:21,713 --> 01:30:23,146
Don't you see?

911
01:30:25,273 --> 01:30:29,505
Robert, don't you see?
I just have to know the truth.

912
01:30:29,993 --> 01:30:33,508
I have to know the truth,
because if I don't, I'll go crazy.

913
01:30:35,233 --> 01:30:36,951
So just tell me, either way.

914
01:30:37,193 --> 01:30:40,629
I can't act like this is enough
because it has to be.

915
01:30:41,233 --> 01:30:44,509
And I can't pretend not
to feel what I feel...

916
01:30:44,753 --> 01:30:46,471
...because it's over tomorrow.

917
01:30:50,353 --> 01:30:52,423
If I've done anything...

918
01:30:53,353 --> 01:30:54,672
...to make you think that...

919
01:30:54,913 --> 01:30:58,189
...what we have between us
is nothing new for me...

920
01:30:59,113 --> 01:31:01,149
...is just some routine...

921
01:31:02,473 --> 01:31:04,703
...then I do apologize.

922
01:31:09,593 --> 01:31:11,948
What makes it different?

923
01:31:15,513 --> 01:31:17,026
When I think...

924
01:31:17,273 --> 01:31:19,423
...of why I make pictures...

925
01:31:20,153 --> 01:31:22,906
...the only reason
I can come up with...

926
01:31:23,473 --> 01:31:27,261
It just seems
that I've been making my way here.

927
01:31:30,873 --> 01:31:33,865
Seems right now,
that all I've done in my life...

928
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:36,229
...was making my way here to you.

929
01:31:38,713 --> 01:31:41,352
And if I think about
leaving here tomorrow...

930
01:31:41,593 --> 01:31:42,946
...without you...

931
01:32:00,233 --> 01:32:01,586
Don't let go.

932
01:32:05,273 --> 01:32:07,867
My God, what are we going to do?

933
01:32:30,233 --> 01:32:31,586
Where's your truck?

934
01:32:31,833 --> 01:32:34,472
It's out behind the barn.
I'll go...

935
01:32:34,993 --> 01:32:36,392
...upstairs.

936
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:55,264
-Hi, Madge.
-I made some brown betty.

937
01:32:55,553 --> 01:32:57,828
Sent Floyd and the boy to town.
I said...

938
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:01,429
..."I'm visiting my girlfriends
for the afternoon."

939
01:33:01,673 --> 01:33:04,187
He said, "Who will make lunch?"
I said...

940
01:33:04,433 --> 01:33:07,311
..."I'm taking a sick day.
Eat at the diner."

941
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:11,064
Isn't that hilarious?
He didn't dare raise an eyebrow.

942
01:33:11,313 --> 01:33:14,908
I don't even want to tell you
how late he was out.

943
01:33:15,153 --> 01:33:19,465
Sorry 2 days passed before I came by.
With the boy home, time escapes me.

944
01:33:19,713 --> 01:33:22,591
Have you heard from Richard?
God, it's hot.

945
01:33:22,833 --> 01:33:25,188
Yes. It's hot.

946
01:33:59,673 --> 01:34:00,992
Come with me.

947
01:34:08,553 --> 01:34:10,225
Come away with me.

948
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:53,186
Care for a beer?

949
01:35:53,593 --> 01:35:54,628
No.

950
01:36:11,593 --> 01:36:13,902
You're not coming with me, are you?

951
01:36:23,673 --> 01:36:27,348
No matter how many times
I turn it over in my mind...

952
01:36:29,153 --> 01:36:31,348
...it doesn't seem like the right thing.

953
01:36:33,033 --> 01:36:34,432
For who?

954
01:36:36,873 --> 01:36:38,306
For anyone.

955
01:36:41,033 --> 01:36:43,672
They'll never be able
to live through the talk.

956
01:36:46,913 --> 01:36:48,346
And Richard...

957
01:36:51,753 --> 01:36:55,109
Richard will never be able
to get his arms around this.

958
01:36:59,113 --> 01:37:02,264
It will break him in half.
He doesn't deserve that.

959
01:37:02,513 --> 01:37:04,981
He's never hurt anyone
in his whole life.

960
01:37:07,953 --> 01:37:11,070
He can move on.
People move.

961
01:37:14,833 --> 01:37:18,667
His family has had this farm
for over 100 years.

962
01:37:21,473 --> 01:37:24,067
He doesn't know how
to live anywhere else.

963
01:37:26,473 --> 01:37:28,065
And my kids...

964
01:37:28,473 --> 01:37:32,227
They're practically grown.
You said they hardly talk to you.

965
01:37:32,473 --> 01:37:34,304
Yeah, they don't say much.

966
01:37:35,873 --> 01:37:37,909
But Carolyn is only 16.

967
01:37:40,793 --> 01:37:44,069
She's about to find out
about all of this for herself.

968
01:37:44,313 --> 01:37:46,463
She's going to fall in love...

969
01:37:46,793 --> 01:37:49,910
...and she'll try to
build a life with someone.

970
01:37:53,153 --> 01:37:54,552
If I leave...

971
01:37:54,793 --> 01:37:56,511
...what does that say to her?

972
01:38:02,953 --> 01:38:04,386
What about us?

973
01:38:05,753 --> 01:38:07,425
You have to know...

974
01:38:08,033 --> 01:38:09,432
...deep down...

975
01:38:09,673 --> 01:38:12,233
...the minute we leave here,
everything will change.

976
01:38:14,393 --> 01:38:16,953
Yeah, it could...
It could get better.

977
01:38:17,193 --> 01:38:21,948
No matter how much distance we put
between ourselves and this house...

978
01:38:23,913 --> 01:38:25,824
...I carry it with me.

979
01:38:27,513 --> 01:38:30,232
I feel it every minute
we're together.

980
01:38:32,873 --> 01:38:36,866
And I will start to blame loving you
for how much it hurts.

981
01:38:37,993 --> 01:38:39,506
And then, even these...

982
01:38:40,393 --> 01:38:41,587
...even these 4...

983
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:46,065
...beautiful days will seem just like
something sordid and a mistake.

984
01:38:48,153 --> 01:38:52,226
Do you think that what happened with us
just happens to anyone?

985
01:38:53,353 --> 01:38:55,344
What we feel for each other?

986
01:38:56,993 --> 01:38:58,312
We're hardly...

987
01:38:59,273 --> 01:39:01,787
...hardly 2 separate people now.

988
01:39:04,113 --> 01:39:07,662
Some people search all their life
and never find this.

989
01:39:07,913 --> 01:39:09,824
Others don't even think it exists.

990
01:39:10,633 --> 01:39:12,783
You're going to tell me...

991
01:39:13,033 --> 01:39:17,823
You're going to tell me this
is the right thing to do? Giving it up?

992
01:39:20,113 --> 01:39:23,742
We are the choices
that we have made, Robert.

993
01:39:29,753 --> 01:39:31,789
You don't understand.

994
01:39:33,593 --> 01:39:34,867
Don't you see?

995
01:39:35,113 --> 01:39:38,310
Nobody understands when
a woman makes a choice...

996
01:39:38,553 --> 01:39:40,783
...to marry and have children...

997
01:39:41,193 --> 01:39:46,347
...in one way, her life begins,
but in another way, it stops.

998
01:39:47,393 --> 01:39:50,749
You build a life of details...

999
01:39:51,273 --> 01:39:54,743
...and you just stop
and stay steady...

1000
01:39:55,073 --> 01:39:58,270
...so that your children can move.
And when they leave...

1001
01:39:58,513 --> 01:40:01,664
...they take your life of details
with them.

1002
01:40:02,153 --> 01:40:06,465
You're expected to move on,
but you don't remember what moved you...

1003
01:40:06,713 --> 01:40:10,262
...because no one's asked you
in so long, not even yourself.

1004
01:40:14,513 --> 01:40:16,231
But you never think...

1005
01:40:17,033 --> 01:40:20,309
You never think love like this
will happen to you.

1006
01:40:22,393 --> 01:40:24,190
But now that you have it...?

1007
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:28,825
Now I want to keep it forever.

1008
01:40:29,073 --> 01:40:33,510
I want to love you the way I do now
for the rest of my life...

1009
01:40:35,273 --> 01:40:36,831
...but if we leave...

1010
01:40:37,073 --> 01:40:38,472
...we lose it.

1011
01:40:39,513 --> 01:40:42,550
And I can't make
an entire life disappear...

1012
01:40:42,793 --> 01:40:44,511
...to start a new one.

1013
01:40:44,753 --> 01:40:47,472
All I can do is
try to hold on to us...

1014
01:40:47,713 --> 01:40:49,510
...somewhere inside of me.

1015
01:40:49,753 --> 01:40:51,789
You have to help me.

1016
01:41:04,153 --> 01:41:05,666
Don't lose us.

1017
01:41:06,953 --> 01:41:08,625
Don't throw us away.

1018
01:41:15,233 --> 01:41:17,952
Maybe you feel this way.
Maybe you don't.

1019
01:41:18,793 --> 01:41:21,307
Maybe it's because
you're in this house.

1020
01:41:21,753 --> 01:41:25,666
Maybe tomorrow, when they come back,
you'll feel differently.

1021
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:28,473
-Don't you think that's possible?
-I don't know.

1022
01:41:31,593 --> 01:41:35,029
Look, I'm going to be here
a few more days.

1023
01:41:35,273 --> 01:41:38,390
We can talk later.
We don't have to decide now.

1024
01:41:40,233 --> 01:41:42,747
Robert, don't!
Don't do this.

1025
01:41:42,993 --> 01:41:45,268
I don't want to say goodbye now.

1026
01:41:45,673 --> 01:41:47,868
We don't have to make that decision.

1027
01:41:48,873 --> 01:41:50,750
Maybe you'll change your mind.

1028
01:41:51,593 --> 01:41:54,153
Maybe we'll see each other
and you'll change your mind.

1029
01:41:57,513 --> 01:41:59,947
If that happens
you have to decide...

1030
01:42:00,193 --> 01:42:01,990
...because I can't.

1031
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:41,664
I'll only say this once.

1032
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:45,989
I've never said it before.

1033
01:42:46,953 --> 01:42:50,548
But this kind of certainty
comes just once in a lifetime.

1034
01:44:48,673 --> 01:44:49,901
Look!

1035
01:45:03,873 --> 01:45:06,467
-You got it.
-I couldn't sell him.

1036
01:45:06,713 --> 01:45:09,227
I know.
I knew you would win.

1037
01:45:09,473 --> 01:45:12,431
-Good girl. Proud of you.
-Thanks.

1038
01:45:12,673 --> 01:45:14,072
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, darling.

1039
01:45:14,313 --> 01:45:16,383
-Did you eat?
-Yeah. I ate.

1040
01:45:17,633 --> 01:45:19,430
Hey, there.
How you doing?

1041
01:45:19,673 --> 01:45:22,392
It didn't take you too long to get here.

1042
01:45:25,873 --> 01:45:28,023
-We had fun.
-Are you hungry?

1043
01:45:28,273 --> 01:45:30,104
I got something for you.

1044
01:45:32,553 --> 01:45:34,066
The fair was great.

1045
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:41,544
You all came home.

1046
01:45:41,793 --> 01:45:43,021
And, with you...

1047
01:45:43,273 --> 01:45:45,628
...my life of details.

1048
01:45:50,633 --> 01:45:53,830
A day or 2 passed,
and with each thought of him...

1049
01:45:54,073 --> 01:45:56,871
...a task would present itself
like a lifesaver...

1050
01:45:57,113 --> 01:46:00,503
...pulling me further away
from those 4 days.

1051
01:46:01,713 --> 01:46:03,351
I was grateful.

1052
01:46:03,633 --> 01:46:05,510
I felt safe.

1053
01:46:12,553 --> 01:46:16,432
Put me out of my misery.
I can’t stand the suspense.

1054
01:46:16,673 --> 01:46:18,504
I'm not talking about you.

1055
01:46:18,753 --> 01:46:21,790
I know I'm a goner.
I can’t stand the suspense. Shoot.

1056
01:46:22,033 --> 01:46:23,944
I don’t even need a blindfold.

1057
01:46:24,193 --> 01:46:27,708
Condemned man’s dinner.
Chicken, peas, watermelon.

1058
01:46:45,113 --> 01:46:49,789
-Do you want anything special?
-How about that brown sugar meat loaf?

1059
01:48:46,153 --> 01:48:48,951
For a moment,
I didn't know where I was.

1060
01:48:49,673 --> 01:48:53,666
And for a split second, I thought
that he didn't really want me.

1061
01:48:54,793 --> 01:48:57,068
That it was easy to walk away.

1062
01:49:36,153 --> 01:49:39,543
Robert leaned over as if to get
something from the glove box.

1063
01:49:40,793 --> 01:49:43,261
8 days ago, he'd done that...

1064
01:49:43,553 --> 01:49:46,147
...and his arm had
brushed across my leg.

1065
01:49:47,033 --> 01:49:50,150
A week ago I'd been in Des Moines,
buying a new dress.

1066
01:50:17,553 --> 01:50:19,589
That truck's a long way from home.

1067
01:50:20,073 --> 01:50:21,825
Washington State.

1068
01:50:22,313 --> 01:50:26,386
I'll bet it's that photographer
they talked about at the café.

1069
01:50:32,313 --> 01:50:34,508
What's he waiting for?

1070
01:51:06,073 --> 01:51:07,267
Come on!

1071
01:51:32,313 --> 01:51:33,507
Oh, no!

1072
01:51:37,913 --> 01:51:40,029
The words were inside of me.

1073
01:51:40,273 --> 01:51:43,504
"I was wrong, Robert, to stay,
but I can’t go.

1074
01:51:43,753 --> 01:51:46,472
Let me tell you again
why I can’t go.

1075
01:51:50,033 --> 01:51:52,786
Tell me again why I should go. "

1076
01:51:53,033 --> 01:51:56,025
I heard his voice coming back to me:

1077
01:51:56,513 --> 01:52:00,631
"This kind of certainty comes
once in a lifetime. "

1078
01:52:05,353 --> 01:52:06,706
What's wrong, Franny?

1079
01:52:10,793 --> 01:52:13,227
Will you please tell me what's wrong?

1080
01:52:16,553 --> 01:52:18,430
I just need a minute.

1081
01:53:20,793 --> 01:53:23,512
Dad, you bought the wrong feed!

1082
01:53:47,673 --> 01:53:50,824
I was grateful for the
silence that night.

1083
01:53:52,033 --> 01:53:55,548
I realized
love won’t obey our expectations.

1084
01:53:55,913 --> 01:53:59,223
Its mystery is pure and absolute.

1085
01:53:59,873 --> 01:54:01,545
What Robert and I had...

1086
01:54:01,793 --> 01:54:04,387
...could not continue
if we were together.

1087
01:54:04,873 --> 01:54:09,503
And what Richard and I shared
would vanish if we were apart.

1088
01:54:10,073 --> 01:54:12,871
But how I wanted to share this!

1089
01:54:13,673 --> 01:54:17,666
How would our lives have changed
if I had?

1090
01:54:18,153 --> 01:54:21,543
Could anyone else have seen
the beauty of it?

1091
01:54:26,473 --> 01:54:28,145
I'm Francesca Johnson.

1092
01:54:28,553 --> 01:54:30,145
And I...

1093
01:54:31,833 --> 01:54:35,667
I feel awful that I haven't visited
sooner. Is it a bad time?

1094
01:54:35,953 --> 01:54:38,513
Am I interrupting anything?
Is it too late?

1095
01:54:38,753 --> 01:54:40,709
No, not at all.

1096
01:54:41,233 --> 01:54:44,350
We became inseparable,
Lucy and I.

1097
01:54:45,473 --> 01:54:50,308
The funny thing is, I didn't tell her
about Robert until years later.

1098
01:54:53,593 --> 01:54:55,982
But for some reason,
being with her...

1099
01:54:56,233 --> 01:54:58,064
...somehow made me feel...

1100
01:54:58,713 --> 01:55:00,624
...it was safe to think about him...

1101
01:55:01,313 --> 01:55:03,031
...to continue loving him.

1102
01:55:05,193 --> 01:55:09,505
This town loved talking
about the two of us, but we didn't care.

1103
01:55:10,553 --> 01:55:12,384
And neither did your father.

1104
01:55:13,993 --> 01:55:15,392
It's time.

1105
01:55:34,313 --> 01:55:35,632
Is better?

1106
01:55:39,193 --> 01:55:40,592
Is better.

1107
01:56:09,713 --> 01:56:10,907
Franny.

1108
01:56:13,553 --> 01:56:15,783
I just want to say...

1109
01:56:18,193 --> 01:56:21,424
...I know you had your own dreams.

1110
01:56:24,233 --> 01:56:27,305
I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you.

1111
01:56:31,833 --> 01:56:34,552
I love you so very much.

1112
01:57:01,993 --> 01:57:05,144
After your father died,
I tried to get in touch with Robert...

1113
01:57:05,393 --> 01:57:08,271
...but he had left National Geographic.

1114
01:57:08,633 --> 01:57:10,908
No one seemed to know where he was.

1115
01:57:11,233 --> 01:57:15,431
My only connections to him
were the places we'd been that day.

1116
01:57:15,673 --> 01:57:18,790
And so, each year on my birthday...

1117
01:57:19,033 --> 01:57:20,466
...I'd revisit them.

1118
01:57:28,073 --> 01:57:31,463
Then one day,
I received a letter from his attorney...

1119
01:57:31,713 --> 01:57:33,032
...with a package.

1120
02:01:07,273 --> 02:01:11,346
There has not been a day since
that I have not thought of him.

1121
02:01:12,513 --> 02:01:15,983
When he said that we were no longer
2 people, he was right.

1122
02:01:20,113 --> 02:01:22,866
Bound together as tightly as
2 people can be.

1123
02:01:24,793 --> 02:01:26,863
If it hadn’t been for him...

1124
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:30,742
...I could not have lasted on the farm
all those years.

1125
02:01:34,033 --> 02:01:36,672
Remember my dress you wanted, Carolyn?

1126
02:01:37,273 --> 02:01:39,912
The one you said I never wore?

1127
02:01:41,113 --> 02:01:42,785
I know I was silly...

1128
02:01:43,033 --> 02:01:47,629
...but it was like you wanted
to wear my wedding dress to the movies.

1129
02:01:51,433 --> 02:01:53,230
After reading all this...

1130
02:01:53,473 --> 02:01:57,386
...I hope you can now
understand my burial request.

1131
02:01:57,633 --> 02:02:00,625
It was not the ravings
of some mad old lady.

1132
02:02:00,913 --> 02:02:04,144
I gave my life to my family.

1133
02:02:04,393 --> 02:02:07,544
I wish to give Robert
what is left of me.

1134
02:02:07,993 --> 02:02:09,221
Hey, Dad.

1135
02:02:11,473 --> 02:02:13,270
Can I talk to you?

1136
02:02:19,073 --> 02:02:22,588
You've been gone all night.
Do I have the right to ask where?

1137
02:02:22,833 --> 02:02:25,108
Do I make you happy, Betty?

1138
02:02:25,353 --> 02:02:26,945
Because I want to.

1139
02:02:27,193 --> 02:02:28,865
More than anything.

1140
02:02:40,073 --> 02:02:41,665
Hi, Steve. It's me.

1141
02:02:41,913 --> 02:02:43,187
Good.

1142
02:02:43,433 --> 02:02:44,309
You?

1143
02:02:45,593 --> 02:02:47,823
Listen, we have to talk.

1144
02:02:48,393 --> 02:02:50,065
How about now?

1145
02:02:54,073 --> 02:02:56,667
I've decided to stay here for a while.

1146
02:02:58,073 --> 02:02:59,904
I don't know how long.

1147
02:03:00,753 --> 02:03:03,392
No, I'm not angry, Steve.

1148
02:03:04,233 --> 02:03:06,064
I'm not.

1149
02:03:06,313 --> 02:03:08,383
I'm not angry at all.

1150
02:03:10,073 --> 02:03:12,382
I gave Lucy his photography book.

1151
02:03:12,793 --> 02:03:15,591
If you're interested, take a look.

1152
02:03:15,953 --> 02:03:19,309
If my words still leave
some things unclear...

1153
02:03:19,553 --> 02:03:22,386
...perhaps his pictures can illuminate.

1154
02:03:22,833 --> 02:03:26,508
After all,
that's what an artist does best.

1155
02:03:35,033 --> 02:03:36,910
I love you both...

1156
02:03:37,153 --> 02:03:39,064
...with all my heart.

1157
02:03:40,273 --> 02:03:43,743
Do what you have to
to be happy in this life.

1158
02:03:44,593 --> 02:03:47,266
There is so much beauty.

1159
02:03:48,513 --> 02:03:51,073
Go well, my children.
