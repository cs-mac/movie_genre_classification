So you're finally going?
Good decision.

81
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,495
그런가요?

82
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,495
You think so?

83
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,330
물론이죠, 정남씨

84
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,330
Of course.

85
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,167
사연 보내신 3개월 동안
제가 한결가이 말씀을 드렸었죠

86
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,167
Ever since you first started
writing in your story,

87
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,269
아버지 꼭 찾아가시라구요

88
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,269
l told you to
go to your father.

89
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,433
몰랐다면 모르겠지만
알게 된 이상 가셔야죠

90
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,433
Now that you found him,
of course you should go.

91
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,271
- 정말 갑니다?
- 가야죠, 당연히

92
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,271
- Then, l'm really going.
- Of course you should.

93
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:16,716
정남씨. 아버지 만나면 제일 먼저
해드리고 싶은 게 뭐예요?

94
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:16,716
What's the first thing you want
to do when you meet him?

95
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,616
뭐 해드릴까요?

96
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,616
What would you like?

97
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,015
네?

98
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,015
Huh?

99
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,554
남자... 혼자 살면...

100
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,554
Well, for a man living alone...

101
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,888
밥이죠, 밥. 하루 세끼

102
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,888
Food. Three meals a day.

103

아침에 딱 일어났는데

104
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:32,999
When he wakes up and
there's breakfast made for him...

105
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,999
탁 이렇게 아침 밥이
차려져있고 이야~

106
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,627
- 꼭 차려드리겠습니다
- 아휴 부럽습니다

107
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,627
- Breakfast it is, then.
- Great.

108
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,906
정남씨는 아버지 만나면
뭐 바라는 거 없나요?

109
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,906
Any hopes after meeting
your father?

110
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,840
노래 부르고 싶습니다

111

가수가 되고 싶으시단
말씀이신가요?

115
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,643
You want to become a singer?

116
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,048

122
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,351

00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,672
한참 꿈을 키울 나이에

159
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:50,202
22 year-old Jung-nam is raising
a kid instead of her dreams.

160
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:50,199
아이를 키운
스물두 살의 정남씨

161
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,375
이제, 따님의 그 꿈까지
포근히 안아주실 아버지

162
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,375
Now, her father awaits to
warmly embrace her.

163
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,877
그리고 사랑스러운 손자...

164
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,877
And his loving grandson.

165
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,319
남현수, 오후의 휴식은

166
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,319

170
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,053
She's going!

171

A daughter and
a grandson out of nowhere!

175
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,531
야 정말 이게 날벼락이란
이런 것일까?

176
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,038
선배도 조심해요
언제 찾아올지 몰라

177
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,038
You never know.
You should be careful, too.

178
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,467
야, 나 프로야 프로~

No, l don't.

216
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,426
어! 김준영이! 그 비디오
터진 거 어떻게 됐니?

217
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,426
What happened to Joon-young Kim
after his sex video incident?

218
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,894
아이 지랄났죠~

219
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:18,164
He got canned from all his ads
and went into hiding.

220
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,164
전속 잘리고, 위약금 꼴고
준영이 잠수 타고

221
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,866
그래, 걔 너무 많이
해먹었어~

222
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,866
He's been milking it too long.

223
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,460
그럼 T.O 난 거네?
걔 전속하던 거 응?

224
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,460
Then there are openings in
his ads, right?

225
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:27,306
봉필중 기자, 그 인간 이번에
아주 제대로 까발렸더만

226
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:27,306
Pil-joong Bong the slimy reporter
really stripped him bare.

227
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,969
걔 원래 그게 전문이야
어우 하이에나 가은 새끼 거...

228
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,969
That's his specialty.
That hyena.

229
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,578
야, T.O 난 거지? 응?

230
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,578
You sure there are openings?

231
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,443
났겠죠~

232
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,443
Yup.

233
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,146
아 그 자식 아까 보이던데?

234
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,146
Wait, l saw him earlier.

235
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,312
하이에나 저기 오네

236
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,312
Here comes the hyena.

237
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,327
봉기자님
아, 여긴 어쩐 일로?

238
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,327
Reporter Bong!
What brings you here?

239
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:54,123
아~ 저기 옆 세트장에서
냄새가 나서...

240
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:54,123
Thought l smelled
something around here.

241
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,994
냄새는...

242
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,994
What smell...

243
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,004
아, 결혼 날짜 잡으셨다며?

244
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,004
Heard your wedding date's set.

245
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,972
어, 가을에

246
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,972
Yes, it's in the fall.

247
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,140
올꺼지?

248
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,140
You're coming, right?

249
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,971
가야지~

250
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,971
Of course.

251
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:08,948
아이 저, 그나저나 거
특종 하나 하셨어? 김준영이~?

252
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:08,948
l saw your big exclusive
on Joon-young Kim.

253
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,317
나 이러다가 준영이한테
쳐 맞는 거 아닌가 몰라

254
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,317
l'll be lucky if he doesn't
come and kill me.

255
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,319
기자가 진실을 추구하다보면

256
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:15,686
A reporter is bound to get into
a few scrapes when out to get the truth.

257
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,685
가끔 뭐 쳐 맞을 때도 있고
뭐 그런...

258
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:20,054
아이 그리고 뭐 걔가 맨날
여자 밝히고 그러다 그런 거지 뭘~

259
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:20,054
lt's his fault for having a
messed up love life.

260
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,560
그러고 보면 자기는
참 소문 안나

261
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,560
Unlike you and your quiet life?

262
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,231
잘 숨겨~?

263
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,231
You're hiding it well.

264
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,968
어후, 내, 내가 뭘
숨기질 뭘 숨겨~?

265
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,968
l'm not hiding anything.

266
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,636
나도 스캔들 좀 만들어 주라

267
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,636
Write up a scandal for me!

268
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,638
신문 1면에 한 번 나와보게~

269
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,638
So l can be on the
front cover for once!

270
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,007
사건은 지난 일요일 저녁
김준영씨와 한 여성이 전라의

271
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,007
A sex video of
Joon-young Kim was...

272
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,170
어우, 넌 어쩜 화면도
이렇게 섹시한 게...

273
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,170
You look so sexy on TV.

274
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,573
아이 그럼 지금 보고 있지~

275
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,573
Of course l'm watching you.

276
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,741
경비한테는 조카 온다고
얘기해놨어

277
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,741
l told the security guard
that my niece is coming.

278
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,779
널 노예로 만들고 싶어

279
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,779
l'll be your slave, tonight.

280
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,138
뭐예요?

281
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,138
Who are you?

282
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,139
맞죠?

283
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,139
You're him?

284
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,044
뭘요?

285
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,044
What?

286
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,346
남현수. 오후의... 휴식?

287
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,346
Afternoon Radio

288
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,643
아난데요

289
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,643
Sorry.

290
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,651
집을...
잘못 찾아오셨나본데...

291
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,651
You got the wrong house.

292
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,689

293

295
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,592

아아~ 황정남씨~

00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:15,440
Oh that Jung-nam!

306
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,077
아이~ 아빠 못 만났구나?!

307
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,077
You didn't meet your father?

308
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,739
아아...아니
여...여...여긴 어쩐 일로?

309
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,739
What are you doing here?

317
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,918
Should l?

318
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,553
아실텐데?

319
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,553
Sure you do.

320
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,180
모를 걸요?

321
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,180
l'm sure l don't.

322
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,751
남현수씨 중 3때

323
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,751
When you were in ninth grade.

324
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,497
옆집 살던 누나

325
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,497
The girl next door.

326
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,633
다섯살 많고

327
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,633
5 years older.

328
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,326
남현수씨 첫 경험

329
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,326
Your first.

330
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,515
나는 이분이 꼭 내 딸 같애
황정남씨 사연입니다

331
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,515
l feel like l know her,
Jung-nam Hwang.

332
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,885
저도 어릴 적에 외갓집이 그 쪽이었는데
방학 때 종종 놀러 갔었어요

333
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,885
My grandmother's house is there.
l visited often when l was young.

334
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,822
아니 그때 아버지 나이가
중학교 3학년이시라고요?

335
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,822
Your father was in ninth grade?

336
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,557
야~ 정말 대단하시다

337
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,557
Wow!

338
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,325
우아~ 저도 그 아는 친구가...

339
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,325
l have a friend who...

340
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,462
중학교 3학년 때...
그랬다고 뭐, 하... 하더라고요

341
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:10,629
you know, did it,
in ninth grade, too.

342
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,629
아는 친구가...

343
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,667
아버지는 꼭 찾아가십쇼. 찾아가십쇼
찾아가십쇼. 찾아가십쇼. 꼭...

344
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,667
Make sure you go to your father.
Go to him!

345
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,693
Go! Go! Go!

346
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,425
인사드려. 할아버지

347
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,425
Say hello to your grandpa.

348
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,968
- 할아버지~
- 어우야, 잠깐만, 잠깐만. 아니, 아니야

349
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,968
- Hi, Grandpa!
- Wait! No!

350
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:49,769
안돼, 하지마

351
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:49,769
No!

352
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,237
- 할아버지~
- 오지마, 오지마

353
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,237
- Grandpa!

354
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,404
야, 잠깐 스톱! 잠깐!

355
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,404
Stop! Don't come near me!

356
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,736
- 할아버지~
- 아이, 앉아봐. 앉아봐, 잠깐. 잠깐...

357
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,736
- Grandpa!
- Sit down!

358
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,082
어떡해...

359
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,082
Damn!

360
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,888
야, 내놔, 내놔. 일루와

361
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,888
Give me that!

362
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,397
야, 빨리 가
빨리 가, 빨리 가

363
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,397
Go! Hurry!

364
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,842
잘 들어, 오래 안 걸려

365
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,842
Listen, it won't be long.

366
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,243
그냥, 조용히만

367
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:07,074
Just keep quiet and
stay right here!

368
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,076
나오지 말고 가만히만
있으면 되는 거야! 알았죠?

369
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,748
- 얘 지금 쉬해야 되는...
- 바지에 싸!

370
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,748
- But he's gotta pee.
- Pee in your pants!

371
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,219
자, 제...제발
네, 응? 제발...

372
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,219
Please? Help me out, here.

373
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,005
어우, 땀 흘리는 것 봐

374
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,005
Sweating, already?

375
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,821
드디어 와 보네
분위기 좀 잡고 있었어?

376
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,821
Finally, l get to see your place.

377
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,156
아~ 좋다

378
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,156
lt's nice.

379
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,532
저기 있잖아, 오늘...

380
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,532
Look babe, tonight...

381
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,090
오늘...

382
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,090
Tonight?

383
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,702
나 그냥 확 흐트러져 버릴까?

384
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,702
Want me to get loose?

385
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,999
아유, 오빠 체취
정말 무너진다

386
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,999
You smell so good.

387
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,240
계속 이렇게 세워 놀꺼야?

388
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,240
You're gonna keep me standing?

389
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,785
로... 로봇 청소기...

390
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,785
lt's the robot vacuum.

391
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,495
욕조. 물 받는 소리

392
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,495
That's the bubble bath.

393
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,197
어우... 대놓구...

394
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,197
Why you...

395
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,671
나, 그렇게 쉬운 여자 아니야

396
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,671
l'm not an easy gal.

397
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,086
어우, 왜 이래?

398
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,086
What are you doing?

399
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:06,063
너한테 중요한 할 말 있다

400
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:06,063
l have something important
to tell you.

401
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,867
말 해

402
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,867
What's that?

403
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,339
헤어지자

404
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,339
Let's break up.

405
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,720
거, 손님 갔어요?

406
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,720
ls your friend gone?

407
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,731
자, 잘 들어요
내가 천천히 말 할 테니까

408
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,731
Listen, l'll say it slowly.

409
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,631
난 빠른게 좋은데

410
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,631
Fast would be better.

411
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,635
하세요

412
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,635
Go ahead.

413
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:48,507
그래, 자 지금 상황을 냉철하게
살펴보자면, 아가씨가 지금

414
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:48,507
Let's think this
through clearly, Miss.

415
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,909
- 애 엄만데...
- 그래, 애 엄마가!

416
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,909
- l'm a mom.
- Whatever!

417
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,812
여튼 지금 이건 아니죠, 예?

418
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,812
This is crazy!

419
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,814
그래 뭐 가끔
그런 사람들 있더라고

420
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,814
Some people send in
their stories

421
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,283
사연을 오래 보내다 보니까
내가 편해서

422
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,283
and feel comfortable with me.

423
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,419
친구가고, 오빠가고
삼촌가고

424
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,419
Like a friend, a brother,
an uncle...

425
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,353
아버지고

426
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,353
A father.

427
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,188
그건 아니고!

428
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,188
Not that!

429
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,248
아니, 내가 지금 어떻게
당신만한 딸이 있나, 어?

430
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,248
How the hell do l have a
daughter your age!

431
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,761
그래, 보경이 누나

432
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,761
Bo-kyung?

433
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,964
아, 그 누나 그렇게 된 건 슬퍼
아이, 거 너무 슬픈 일이야

434
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,964
l feel sorry for
what happened to her.

435
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,694
나 아까 저기 가서
엉엉 울다왔거든요, 응?

436
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,694
l cried my heart out over there.

437
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,759
그런데 내가 그 누나랑 내가
정말 딱 한 번 내가 어?

438
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,759
But it was my first
and only time!

439
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,498
내가 생생해
내가 다 기억해 그거!

440
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,498
l remember everything!

441
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,677
에이 나 아니야~
나 어려서 조준도 잘 못했다고

442
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,677
lt can't be me!
l didn't even aim right!

443
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:26,779
조준 잘 했어요

444
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:26,779
You aimed well.

445
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,481
아니 중3짜리가
뭔 재주로 애를 만들어?!

446
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,481
How can a boy in
ninth grade make a kid?

447
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,216
전 고1 때...

448
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,216
l did in tenth grade.

449
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,318
에이 진짜. 너 누군데?

450
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,318
Damn it, who are you?

451
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,219
- 황! 기동입니다!
- 너 말구!

452
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,219
- l'm Ki-dong Hwang!
- Not you!

453
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:41,293
아가씨! 아가씨 지금 이러는 거
이거 범법행위야

454
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:41,293
Look Miss.
What you're doing is a crime.

455
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:45,127
무단침입! 3년 이하 징역이나
오백이하 벌금!

456
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:45,127
Forced entry!
3 years or $5000 in fines!

457
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,892
감옥가고 싶어?

458
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,892
Wanna go to jail?

459
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,902
진짜 가요?

460
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,902
You want us to go?

461
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,336
오지도 말았어야죠

462
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,336
You should never have come.

463
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,604
얘 잘 시간인데?

464
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,604
But it's his bedtime.

465
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,839
저도 잘 시간입니다

466
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,839
lt's my bedtime, too.

467
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,636
차도 끊겼는데?

468
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,636
There's no bus at this hour.

469
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,438
건강하세요

470
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,438
Take care.

471
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,659
영화배우 김준영
비디오 파문?

472
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,659
Actor Joon-young Kim's
sex video revealed?

473
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,991
끝났네, 끝났어

474
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,991
He's so over.

475
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,229
어쩌다 글쎄...

476
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,229
Poor guy.

477
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,857
할아버지 안녕히 주무세요

478
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,857
Goodnight, grandpa.

479
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,833
아유 시끄러워...
아우씨... 아휴...

480
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,833
What's all the noise!

481
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,938
Grandpa

482
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,904
할아버지, 안녕히 주무셨어요?

483
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,904
Good morning, grandpa.

484
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,448
밥차려 달라매요?

485
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,448
You asked for breakfast.

486
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,197
차린 게 많아요
적당히 드세요

487
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,197
l cooked a lot.
But don't eat too much.

488
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,000
저기

489
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,000
Look.

490
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,369
내가 어제 곰곰히
생각을 해봤는데

491
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,369
l've thought it over.

492
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,704
아가씨 내 딸 아니야

493
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,704
You can't be my daughter, Miss.

494
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,972
아가씨 아니라니까

495
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,972
Stop calling me, Miss.

496
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,307
당신 황씨잖아, 나 남씬데

497
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,307
Your last name's Hwang.
Mine's Nam.

498
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:46,209
엄마성 따서 황씨죠
황보경. 황정남. 황기동

499
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:46,209
Hwang's my mom's last name.

500
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:51,209
뭐, 닮은 데가 없잖아, 어?
봐봐. 댁은 쌍꺼풀도 있...

501
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:51,209
You look nothing like me.
Your eyes are...

502
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,245
난 웃을 때
눈 안 보이잖아

503
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,245
You can't see my eyes
when l smile.

504
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,096
입술! 입술 완전 다르네
입술!

505
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,096
Lips!
They're totally different!

506
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,654
완전 다행이죠

507
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,654
Totally lucky.

508
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,000
유전자 검사 해?

509
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,000
Let's get a DNA test.

510
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,301
피가 제일 확실하대요

511
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,301
Great idea.

512
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,669
- 딸 아니면?
- 기면요?

513
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,669
- lf you're not my daughter...
- lf l am?

514
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,837
경찰서 간다~

515
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,837
You're going to jail.

516
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:15,534
한편 비디오의 주인공인
영화배우 김준...

517
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:15,534
Actor Joong-young Kim's video is...

518
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,972
아니 뭐 밑도 끝도 없이
딸이라고 쳐들어와서는...

519
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,972
You can'tjust claim to
be my daughter and...

520
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,321
Veterinary Hospital

521
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,788
완전 이거...

522
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,788
Classic!

523
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:34,325
이런 게 진짜 사연감이거든~

524
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:34,325
Now, that's a story.

525
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,895
내가 너 한 큐 한다
그랬지? 어?

526
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,895
l knew you'd mess up.

527
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,364
나 진짜 믿을 인간
형 밖에 없어

528
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,364
You're the only one
l can trust, man.

529
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,628
개집에서도
이런 걸 다 하네요

530
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,628
A DNA test at a dog house?

531
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,936
아가씨. 하
여긴 개집이 아니고

532
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,936
Hey, this is not a dog house.

533
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,201
아~ 개병원. 하~

534
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,201
Sorry, a dog hospital.

535
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,709
멘트가 아주... 참신한데?

536
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,709
Such novel comments.

537
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,482
느낌이 아주 후지고 좋아
야, 이거 꼭 검사 해봐야지 알겠냐?

538
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,482
So rustic.
Why do the test?

539
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,719
혀 끝에서 파바박 느낌이 오잖아
나 남현수 딸이라고~

540
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,719
lt's so obvious
she's your kid.

541
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,754
시끄럽고~
결과 언제 나와?

542
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,754
Shut up.
How long will it take?

543
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,153
열흘

544
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,153
10 days.

545
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,492
- 아저씨, 옛날에 드럼치셨죠?
- 어, 그거?

546
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,492
- Weren't you a drummer once?
- Oh that?

547
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,518
저때 진짜 멋있었는데

548
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,518
You were so cool back then.

549
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,522
뭐, 지금도 멋있으시네!

550
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,522
Haven't changed a bit!

551
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,605
근데 무슨 노래 할 때가
그렇게 멋있었는데?

552
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,605
What song did you like?

553
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,301
너 저거 알아?
나 기억해?

554
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,301
You know the band?
You remember me?

555
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:28,708
야~ 딸내미 이쁘다 야~

556
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:28,708
Your daughter's so pretty!

557
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,515
어이 이름이 뭐야?

558
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,515
What's the kid's name?

559
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,017
황! 기동입니다!

560
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,017
Ki-dong Hwang!

561
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,076
야~ 기동이 일루와!
사탕 먹어

562
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,076
Come here, Ki-dong.
Have some candy.

563
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,521
뭐 먹을까? 오렌지?
청포도? 어?

564
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,521
Orange or grape flavor?

565
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,614
근데 이거 너무 많이 먹으면
이빨 다 썩어

566
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,614
Not too much or
your teeth will rot.

567
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,766
자식 맞네

568
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,766
She's yours.

569
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,344
백프로다야

570
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,344
100 percent.

571
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,091
애들은 친환경적으로
살아야 돼~

572
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,091
Kids need to grow up
where the air is fresh.

573
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:51,821
이! 너! 너너너 지금 긁...긁었지?
너 긁었잖아 지금?

574
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:51,821
See! You're scratching!
You scratched, didn't you!

575
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,466
야, 이거 아토피야
이거 죽어~

576
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,466
That's atopic dermatitis!

577
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,035
이거 막 간지러워가지고 긁다가
나중에 죽는다니까?!

578
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,035
lt starts with scratching
then you die!

579
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,004
야, 빨리 시골가서 살아야 돼

580
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,004
You have to live in the country!

581
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,908
여기는 공 기  진짜 안좋지
막 차들 막 쌩쌩 다니지

582
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,908
The air's terrible here.
Cars race around everywhere!

583
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:06,745
밖에 나가면 애들 막 치어가지고
막 팔다리 부러지고 막 날라다녀~

584
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:06,745
Kids get run over here
all the time!

585
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,542
야, 밖에만 나가봐...

586
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,542
Go out and look!

587
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,476
앉지

588
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,476
Have a seat.

589
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:52,049
그동안 힘들었지?
혼자 애 키우느라

590
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:52,049
lt must've been hard
raising a kid by yourself.

591
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,260
뭐, 그렇죠...

592
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,260
Well, kinda.

593
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:02,098
사실 너희 엄만
내 처음이자 마지막 사랑이었다

594
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:02,098
Your mom was my first
and only love.

595
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,162
우란 너무 사랑했지만

596
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:10,065
We had to part because
we loved each other.

597
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:10,066
사랑하기에 헤어질 수
밖에 없었지

598
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:16,973
너희 엄마, 보경이 누난
그래서 널 감췄던거야

599
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:16,973
Your mom hid you
because of that.

600
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,248
사랑하는 남자의 앞길에
방해가 될까봐

601
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,248
She didn't want to hold me back.

602
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,054
차라리 그때 알았더라면
좋았을 것을...

603
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,054
But l wish l could've known
back then.

604
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,449
미안하다

605
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,449
l'm sorry.

606
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,341
나, 노래 잘 해요

607
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,341
l'm a good singer.

608
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,303
음식, 그런 거 국산을 선호해요

609
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,303
l love Korean food.

610
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:55,886
어렸을 때... 그럴 때는
내가 반항을 안했어. 임신을 했지

611
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:55,886
l wasn't rebellious when
l was young. Just got pregnant.

612
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:02,794
보다시피 내가 좀
귀여운 스타일 이잖아요

613
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:02,794
As you can see,
l'm irresistibly cute.

614
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,455
아~ 예~

615
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,455
Of course.

616
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,191
나 갈거야

617
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,191
l'm leaving.

618
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,303
나 갈 거예요. 붙잡지마

619
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,303
l'm going! Don't stop me!

620
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,406
난 니 의견을 존중한다

621
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,406
l respect your decision.

622
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,038
아부지도 한 잔 해~

623
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,038
Have a drink, dad.

624
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,638
따르시오~

625
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,638
Pour it on!

626
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,074
빨개, 빨개, 빨개...

627
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,074
Red! Red!

628
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,587
- 아이구 우리 네병 다 딴 거야?
- 으하하... 오, 빨간 술~

629
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,587
- We drank four bottles?
- Red wine!

630
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,956
어떻게 세상에 이런 일이
난 딱 한 번 했는데 하하

631
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,956
Unbelievable.
l did itjust once!

632
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,447
나두, 나두
나두 한 번 이게...

633
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,447
Me, too! Me, too!

634
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,661
- 어, 잠깐만...
- 이거 뭐, 술이, 술이 없네...

635
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,661
- Enough.
- All gone.

636
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,029
어? 황기동이!

637
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,029
Ki-dong!

638
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,198
어, 일루와, 일루와
술 한 잔 해~ 술 한 잔 해~

639
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,198
Come here and have a drink.

640
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,366
아유 애 한테 무슨?

641
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,366
He's just a kid.

642
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,636
아이 괜찮아, 조기 교육인데
아 어차피 배울거...

643
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,636
lt's okay.
He can learn to drink early.

644
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,605
- 아, 한 병 더? 좋아~
- 한 병 더~

645
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,605
- One more bottle?
- One more!

646
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,530
할아...

647
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,530
Grand...

648
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,401
회의가 있어서

649
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,401
l have a meeting.

650
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,582
어제 약속 기억 다 나시죠?

651
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,582
Remember your promise last night?

652
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,651
어, 나...

653
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,651
Ah, sure.

654
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,389
여튼 연말까지 잘 해봐요

655
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,389
lt's just till
the end of the year.

656
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,820
거~ 금방 간다니까

657
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,820
Then we're out of here.

658
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,523
그래서 이따가
다음주 출연자들 모이고?

659
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,523
Next week's guests are coming?

660
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,633
네, 다섯시 까지요

661
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,633
Yes, by 5 p.m.

662
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,498
- 출연자 체크 한 번만 해줘요
- 네에

663
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,498
- Check on them again.
- Okay.

664
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,472
- 노래 죽이는 애 있대매?
- 걔 완전 가수더라

665
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,472
- Heard there's a killer singer.
- She's a real pro.

666
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,907
- 선배, 보셔야죠?
- 이름이... 제인?

667
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,907
- Wanna check it out?
- Her name's Jae-in.

668
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,707
그런건 댁들이
알아서들 좀 하세요 좀...

669
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,707
Be my guest and handle it.

670
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,974
아, 그리고 미혼모 황정남이...

671
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,974
About Jung-nam the single mom...

672
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,684
걔 사연 안올라오냐고
게시판이 아주 난리네

673
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,684
People are writing in
wondering about her.

674
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,652
- 청취율도 좀 떨어지고
- 음... 그건 그래

675
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,652
- Our ratings are down, too.
- True.

676
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:18,957
야, 그거 뭐 걔 사연 안왔다고
청취율이 자빠 지나?

677
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:18,957
Our ratings won't plummet
because she stopped writing in.

678
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,687
왜 안 그래요~
그걸로 재미 좀 봤지

679
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,687
l wouldn't be so sure.

680
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,095
저번에 국장님도
한말씀 하시던데

681
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,095
Even the director mentioned her.

682
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,428
나참. 아 언제부터
그렇게 신경을 쓰셨대?

683
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,428
Since when did he start caring
so much about our show.

684
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,901
아 그러면 자기가
DJ를 하던가?

685
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,901
Then tell him to do it.

686
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,835
그 방법이 있었네~

687
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,835
Now, there's an idea.

688
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,297
어이 디제이 아저씨

689
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,297
Look Mr. DJ.

690
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:42,711
광고, 광고 하다가 광고
하나 찍더니 라디오 재미 없지?

691
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:42,711
You shoot a commercial and
now you're bored of radio?

692
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,078
아니, 제가 무슨 뭐...

693
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,078
Of course not, sir.

694
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,376
야!

695
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,376
You!

696
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,884
너 아직 얘기 안해줬냐?

697
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,884
Didn't you tell him?

698
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:55,984
걔 사연 소개하는 날
청취율 확~ 올라가는 거

699
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:55,984
How the ratings shot up
when her story was mentioned?

700
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,796
알아, 몰라?

701
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,796
You know?

702
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,821
그래서 말입니다. 국장님

703
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,821
l've been thinking, sir.

704
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:04,792
앉아서 기다리지만 말고
찾아보는 건 어떨까요?

705
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:04,792
lnstead ofjust waiting for her,
why don't we find her?

706
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:08,406
제 친구 중에 사람 잘 찾는
애가 있거든요, 허동구라고

707
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:08,406
l have a friend who's really
good at finding people.

708
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,875
이참에 직접 찾아서
스튜디오로 한번 데려오는 거죠

709
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:12,672
Let's find her and have her
on the show with her dad, too.

710
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,672
걔 아빠까지 가이 해서

711
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,078
괜찮어 괜찮어

712
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,078
Good idea.

713
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,849
얘들이 사람 찾는 거 일도 아니거든요
수배자도 아난데

714
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,849
lt'll be a piece of cake
finding her.

715
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:18,883
맞어

716
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:18,883
Yeah!

717
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,652
거, 괜찮네

718
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,652
l like it.

719
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,176
데려와서 방송하는 거

720
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,176
Have her on the show.

721
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,118
뭐, 바로 추진할까요?

722
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,118
Should l get right on it?

723
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,790
제가 연락을 해서...

724
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,790
Then l'll make the call.

725
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,587
연락은 뭘?!

726
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,587
Stop!

727
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,289
아니~

728
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,289
Look.

729
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:34,399
그 원래 사연은 사연일 때
더 아름다운 거 아닙니까 예?

730
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:34,399
Let's not taint
the beauty of the story.

731
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,568
신비감?! 뭐 그런 것도
있어야 되고...

732
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,568
Keep the mystique going.

733
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,903
아 그러고 뭐 데려와서
방송하고 나면, 응?

734
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:40,839
lf we bring her in for a show,
then what?

735
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,839
이 다, 다음이 없잖아? 응?

736
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,364
그, 그죠?
그그...그렇잖아~ 응?

737
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,364
Think about it.

738
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,244
사연 안 보내?

739
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,244
Why aren't you writing?

740
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,614
아, 예?

741
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,614
Huh?

742
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,791
라디오!

743
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,791
The radio.

744
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,190
예?

745
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,190
What?

746
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,825
아, 사연 안 보내냐고?

747
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,825
Write to the show!

748
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,397
내가 언제 쪼잔하게 응?
그랬냐고?

749
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,397
When did l ever do that?

750
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,233
카드 도로 뺏어갔잖아요
치사하게

751
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,233
You took the credit card back!

752
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,567
야, 내 카드 내가 가져가는게
그게 뭐가 치사한 거...

753
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,567
lt's my credit card!

754
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,069
그런 걸 치사한 거라고
하는 거라니까

755
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,069
You're so mean.

756
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,037
야, 치사한 건
그런게 치사한 게 아니지

757
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,905
That's not being mean!
lt's my credit card!

758
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:13,905
아니, 내 카드를 내가...

759
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,374
아 지워, 지금 지운다구
여기 다 지웠네!

760
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,374
Fine! l'll erase it!
Look!

761
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,069
당연히 다 지워야지 그러면

762
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,069
Of course you should!

763
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,677
아우 뭐 쓸 게 없다
쓸 게 없어

764
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,677
Man, there's nothing to write.

765
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:26,106
아우 야 답답해, 아 비켜봐 비켜봐
아유 좀... 아이 나~

766
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:26,106
Aw, come on! Move!
l'll do it!

767
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:30,142
아니 사연을 그렇게 쓰면은
느낌이 다르잖아 느낌이~

768
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:30,142
That's no way to write a story!

769
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,125
자상한 아버지는 선뜻 카드까지
내주시면서 이러셨습니다

770
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,125
My loving father gave me
his credit card and said...

771
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:39,130
그까짓 카드 값이 대수냐?
너희가 원한다면, 깡도 해주마

772
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:39,130
'A credit card is no big deal,
l'll give you anything you want'.

773
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,899
호탕하게 웃으셨죠

774
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,899
And laughed heartily.

775
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,602
염치없이 민폐만 끼쳤던
저는 결심했습니다

776
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,602
So l decided to stop
being a nuisance,

777
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:48,339
하루빨리 독립해서 더 이상
아버지를 괴롭히지 않으리라!

778
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:48,339
and stop burdening my dad!

779
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,809
- 괜찮을까? 어이구 내새끼~
- 지랄하네...

780
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,809
- Will my baby be okay?
- My ass...

781
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,436
네에?

782
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,436
What?

783
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,778
혹시라도 저를 찾으신다면

784
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,778
lf you ever thought
about finding me,

785
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:00,049
절대 그러지 말아주세요

786
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:00,049
please don't!

787
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:04,088
사연은, 사연일 때
아름다운 것이랍니다

788
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:04,088
Let's not taint the beauty
of an anonymous story.

789
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,646
빨래~

790
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,646
The laundry!

791
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,871
정말 아이를 얼마나
사랑하시는지 모르겠어요

792
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,871
My father adores my son.

793
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,839
철없고 시끄러운 우리 아이는

794
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:24,275
My noisy little son
keeps the TV blaring,

795
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,275
집안이 떠나가라 TV를 켜놓고

796
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,711
소파는 혼자 다 차지한답니다

797
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,711
and has the sofa all to himself.

798
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:30,010
언제나 양보만 하시는
아~ 아버지!

799
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:30,010
Always so giving and kind.

800
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,616
희생과 헌신

801
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,616
Sacrificing and devotional...

802
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,911
저희 아버지의
다른 이름이 아닐요?

803
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,911
That's my father.

804
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,295
물 떠와

805
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,295
Get me some water.

806
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,727
유람선은 데려가
본 적도 없을텐데?

807
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,727
Took us on a cruise?

808
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,630
개뿔~ 오리배도 못타봤구만

809
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,630
Yeah, right! l've never been
on a paddle boat.

810
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,836
백화점에서 옷...
백화점에서?

811
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,836
Bought clothes from
a department store?

812
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,175
가면 될 거 아냐, 가면?

813
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,175
Fine! l'll take you!

814
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,055
Wow, your father plastered you
with expensive clothes?

815
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:19,088
네~ 명품으로 도배를 시켜주셨다니
아버지가 참 무리를 하셨겠네요

816
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,566
황정남씨
사연 진심으로 감사드립니다

817

아, 왜일까?

840
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,646
Take a guess.

뭐 물론 네티즌의 투표로
결정이 나겠지만

871
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,524
The winner will be decided

No, it means
'be gentle' in Korean.

00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,984
어질게 살라고
어머니가 지어주셨습니다

889
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,984
My mom named me.

전국민이 지켜보고 있으니까
긴장하지 마시고...

897
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:07,064
Don't get scared of millions
watching you.

898
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:11,262
어, 노래는 최용준씨의
아마도 그건

899
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:11,262
She'll be singing,
'Maybe' by Young-joon Choi.

900
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,697
아... 이게... 의상이...

901
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,697
The dress...

902
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,870
아, 이게 옛날 노래라
옛날 컨셉으로...

903
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,870
Nice and old to suit
the old song.

904
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,408
어쩐지...

905
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,408
Perfect.

906
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,641
자, 하세요. 시~작~!

907
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,641
Ready? Go!

908
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,492
저, 긴장을
너무 많이 하셔가지고

909
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:11,355
Probably a little nervous.
Better luck next time.

910
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:11,359
어, 안타깝게도
아, 다음 기회에...

911
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,207
아마도

912
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,207
Maybe

913
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,145
그건 사랑이었을거야

914
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,145
lt was love

915
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:42,420
희미하게 떠오르는 기억이...

916
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:42,420
The faint memories

917
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,255
이제야

918
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,255
Finally

919
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,400
그 마음을 알아버렸네

920
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,400
l realized

921
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,463
그대 눈에 비친 나의 모습을...

922
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,463
My reflection in your eyes

923
00:37:55,039 --> 00:38:01,545
차가운 내마음에 남은
너의 뒷모습

924
00:37:55,039 --> 00:38:01,545
You walked away
from my cold heart

925
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:06,983
열란 문틈으로
너는 내게 다가올 것 가아

926
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:06,983
l thought you'd walk back
in through the door

927
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:13,388
한참을 멍하니 문만 바라보다

928
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:13,388
As l stood still waiting

929
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:18,793
아침 햇살에 눈을 뜨고 말았네

930
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:18,793
l opened my eyes
in the morning sun

931
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:25,195
사랑 그것은
엇갈란 너와 나의 시간들

932
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:25,195
Love passed us by

933
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:30,673
스산한 바람처럼 지나쳐갔네~

934
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:30,673
Passing by us like the wind

935
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:37,173
사랑 그것은
알수 없는 너의 그리움

936
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:37,173
Maybe love was in missing you

937
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:42,981
남아있는 나의 깊은 미련들

938
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:42,981
And the lingering regrets
in my heart

939
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,264
좀 합디다

940
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,264
Pretty good.

941
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,065
좀 하죠

942
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,065
Darn right.

943
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:54,932
나가지 말자

944
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:54,932
Drop the contest.

945
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,167
나갈 건데요

946
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,167
No way.

947
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,903
내가 많이 잘못했다
나가지 말자

948
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,903
l'm sorry for everything.
Don't do this.

949
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,604
내가 쪼끔 잘못한 걸로 하고

950
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,604
l'm also sorry, so...

951
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,808
왜? 왜? 왜 하필
우리 방송이냐고?

952
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:03,808
Why does it have to be my show!

953
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,504
꼭 한 번 참가해 달라면서요

954
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,504
You said to enter it.

955
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:11,449
아, 그래, 그래. 인정! 어?
그래 요즘 다 니덕이야

956
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:11,449
Okay, l know it's
all thanks to you!

957
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,440
니 덕에 청취율도 올라가고

958
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,440
Our ratings are up
because of you.

959
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,353
아프다 그러자, 어?

960
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,353
Let's just call in sick.

961
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,722
오! 맹장! 맹장 터졌다고!

962
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,722
Say your appendix burst!

963
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,256
맹장은 제작년에 터졌는데?

964
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,212
lt burst two years ago.

965
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:23,461
아우~ 너, 이씨~ 너. 너

966
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,357
Why you!

967
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,363
너 할 말 미리
다 연습해 놓지? 어?

968
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,363
You practice arguing with me?

969
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,231
아주 한 마디를 안 꺾여~

970
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,231
You never back down, do you!

971
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,900
너, 애까지 있는 애가
애 육아에 애를 써야지

972
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,900
You should focus on
raising your kid,

973
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,469
노래나 부르러
다난대고 말이야

974
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,469
not go around singing!

975
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:34,438
너 성장배경이
어쨌길래 이 모양이야?!

976
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:34,438
Didn't you ever learn to
use your head!

977
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,569
뭐? 왜?

978
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,569
What?

979
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,242
애비없이 커서 그럴 걸요

980
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,242
lt's probably because
l grew up without a dad.

981
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,547
미혼모도 하고 싶은 거 많아요

982
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,547
Single mothers have dreams, too.

983
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,716
애는?

984
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,716
What about Ki-dong?

985
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,487
아... 거 노래 부르러 댕길 때~

986
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:26,349
What will you do with him
when you come to the studio?

987
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,354
애는 어떡할거냐고
방송국 나올 때

988
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,326
뭐... 가이 다녀도 되고

989
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,326
l can take him with me.

990
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,850
안돼~

991
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,850
No way!

992
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,531
나 거기 방송국에
아는 사람 얼마나 많은데

993
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,531
l know everyone in the station!

994
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,624
알아서 광고 낼 일 있어?

995
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,624
Word can get out!

996
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,891
유치원 가면 되겠네~

997
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,891
How about kindergarten?

998
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,230
아들! 우리 유치원갈까?

999
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,230
Would you like that, son?

1000
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,167
어이, 거기!

1001
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,167
Hey, kid.

1002
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,576
내가 누구야?

1003
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,576
Who am l?

1004
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,567
할아버지...

1005
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,567
Grandpa.

1006
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,782
자, 여기 할아버지가 있지. 어?

1007
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,782
This is your grandfather.

1008
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,853
이 할아버지가 아들 셋을 낳았어
이게 삼형제가 되겠지

1009
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,853
He had three sons.

1010
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,122
이 둘째 아들이
우리 아버지가 되는거야

1011
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,122
The second son is my dad.

1012
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,590
요 큰 아들 있지, 큰 아들

1013
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,091
The first son had two sons.

1014
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,091
이 큰 아들이
또 아들 둘을 낳았는데

1015
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,218
그럼 성이 가은데?

1016
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,218
But our last names are different.

1017
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:07,458
자 이게 딸, 딸. 아들 아니야 딸 어?
그럼 이제 성이 인제 달라...

1018
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:07,458
Fine! A daughter!
The last names are different, then.

1019
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,902
자, 다시 할게

1020
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,902
Let's start over.

1021
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:15,105
자, 할아버지가 아들 셋을 낳았는데
둘째 아들이 우리 아빠고

1022
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:15,105
Grandpa had three sons,
and the second son is my father.

1023
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:18,008
자 그러면 큰 딸이야 자, 이 큰 딸이
또 아들 둘을 낳은 거야...

1024
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:18,008
And the oldest daughter
had two sons.

1025
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,710
뭐 맨날 아들만 낳아

1026
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,710
Why so many sons?

1027
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,378
어떡하니, 나오는 거를!

1028
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,976
Who cares! lt's not like
l gave birth to them!

1029
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,972
아들만 나온 걸 어떡하니 나보고?!
내가 낳았니?

1030
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,156

1031
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,156
Who am l?

1032

00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,390
My uncle.

1034
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,458
어떻게 삼촌이야

1035
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,458
How?

1036
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,791
아빠네 할아버지네
둘째아들 삼촌이요

1037
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,791
My dad's grandpa's
second son's son.

1038
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,361
부모님은?

1039
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,361
Your parents?

1040
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,025
잘했어

1041
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,025
Good job.

1051
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:19,197
Hey, kid! Come over here
and sit down.

1052
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:38,212
아니, 뭐? 뭐 보는데 뭐?

1053
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:38,212
What are you looking at?

1054
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,819
얘 아들 아니예요

1055
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,819
He's not my son.

1056
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,820
물 좋아?

1057
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,820
Any cute girls?

1058
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:15,188
찍은 애 있어? 이름이 뭐야?

1059
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:15,188
Anyone you like?
What's her name?

1060
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,860
아, 빨랑~

00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,860
Tell me!

1062
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,861
진짜? 그래서 원장님이
또 뭐라 그랬는데?

1063
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,861
Really?
What did the director say?

1064
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:36,237
들어가서 놀든가, TV보는데~

1065
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:36,237
Go in and play.
l'm watching TV.

1066
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,081
궁금하세요?

1067
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,081
You're curious?

1068
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:39,950

You want in?

1070
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,985
시끄럽거든

1071
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,985
Be quiet.

1072
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,782
그래서 귓속말로 하잖아요

1073
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,782
That's why we were whispering.

1074
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,114
저거 재밌는거 한다

1075
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,114
That show's funny.

1076
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:51,861
- 아우, 저거 누가 본다고?
- 즐겨 보거든요

1077
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:51,861
- Who watches that?
- l do.

1078
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,427
명상의 시간

1079
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,427
Relax and meditate

1080
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:05,075
웃었죠? 웃었죠?

1081
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:05,075
You laughed!

1082
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:05,676
안웃었거든

1083
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:05,676
l did not!

1084
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,211
지금 웃고 있구만

1085
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,211
l saw you!

1086
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,576
아니거든

1087
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,576
No way!

1088
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,279
에이참

1089
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,279
Stop it.

1090
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:26,761
밥 안줘?

1091
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:26,761
l'm hungry.

1092
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,627
나 결혼한지 3년만에
어제 처음 갔잖아 나이트~

1093
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,627
l went to a club last night.
First time in three years.

1094
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,170
야, 결혼 왜 했나 싶드만

1095
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,170
Wonder why l ever got married.

1096
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,509
애들이 춤추는데
가슴이 완전 쌍라이트가!

1097
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,509
The hooters on the
ladies dancing...

1098
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,011

But you gotta admit,

애가 어딘가
은근히 색기가 있더라, 그지?

1117

그건 그래, 시골 애들이

1118
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,595
True, country girls like

l'd like to thank you for
taking care of my nephew.

1145
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:43,629

좋아하시는지...

1146
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:43,629
What kind of food do you like?

1149
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,710
기동이가 좋아하는
애가 있는데

1150
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,710
There's a girl
who Ki-dong likes.

1151
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,271
기동이 촌스럽다고
같이 안 논대요

1152
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,271
But she says he dresses tacky
and won't play with him.

1153
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,812
보니까 애기 옷이 좀
많이 낡았던데...

1154

1177
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,708

1196
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:03,434
Still can't reach Jae-in Hwang?

1197
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,175

1201
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,579
왜 마지막에
등장하는 걸 즐겨?!

1202
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,579
Always wanting to

1206
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:18,418
You're a little late.

1207
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,817
저기, 차가 많이 밀리셨나봐요

1208
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,817
Must've been the traffic.

1209

조명 잘 받는 곳으로
모셔드려라

1210

남자분, 비켜주세요

1214
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,664
Will you move for her, please?

1215
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:39,398
사랑하는 건 내 마음이겠지

1216
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:39,398
lt's up to me to fall in love

1217
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,646
능력있다 말 할 수도 있지만~

1218
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,646
Maybe l'm a fool at heart

1219
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:46,707
단 한번 사랑하기도
쉽지 않은 세상에

1220
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:46,707
ln a world where it's hard to
fall in love

1221
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,843
상처받을 그 사람을 생각해~

1222
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,843
Think of my heartbroken love

1223
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,137
제인아!

1224
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,137
Jae-in!

1225
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,743
황제인 맞지?

1226
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,743
Jae-in Hwang, right?

1227
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,715
오빠야, 상윤 오빠

1228
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,715
lt's me, Sang-yoon.

엄마 차례!

1232
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,355
Your turn, mommy.

1233
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,417
어?

1234
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,417
Huh?

1235
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,628
기동이가 이겼다
오늘은 그만 하자

1236
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:32,829
You win, Ki-dong. Let's stop
playing for today, okay?

1237
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:32,829
엄마 잠깐만~

1238
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,228
네~

1239
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,228
Sure.

1240
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:39,197
아이구, 애한테 좋은 거
가르친다. 거, 에이~

1241
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:39,197
What a mother,
teaching a kid how to play cards...

1242
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,377
사람들이
나 누구냐고 안물어봐?

1243
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,377
Don't people ask you about me?

1244
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,004
아니요

1245
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,004
No.

1246
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,682
물어보면 지난 번에
연습한것 처럼 얘기 잘 해

1247
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,682
lf they do, tell them like we
practiced last time.

1248
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:53,979
네

1249
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:53,979
Okay.

1250
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,353

1251
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,353
You sure?

1252
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:01,083
너 나 그 티비광고에서 봤잖아
나 인기 되게 많아

1253
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:01,083
You saw my TV commercial.

1254
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,583
쌌어요

피박에 쌍박에
전판 나가리요

1257
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,698
Double whammy! Pay up!

1258
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:19,976
아, 왜?

1259
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:19,976
What now?

1260
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,466

1261
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,466

1262
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:24,779
- 내가 섞어? 섞는다
- 네~

1263
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:24,779
- Want me to shuffle, then?
- Okay.

1264
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:28,217
- 조준 잘 해. 세 번 털고
- 네~

1265
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:28,217
- Aim well and flush.

1266
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:46,536

1267
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:46,536
Cut the deck.

1268
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:47,969
퉁!

1269
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:47,969
Stick!

1270
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:24,831
저기!

1271
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:24,831
Look!

1272
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,883
어란 놈이 어디서
못되먹은 거나 배워가지고!

1273
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,883
Kids shouldn't play
this darn game!

1274
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:40,717
나, 안해 안해! 에이~

1275
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:40,717
l quit!

1276
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:51,368
사진 찍는 거 좋아하더니

1277
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:51,368
You liked taking pictures.

1278
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,003
사진 작가 되는 거네

1279
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,003
Now, you're a photographer?

1280
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,369
너 아직도
사진 찍을 때 그래?

1281
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,369
Do you still do that
when you take pictures?

1282
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,733
뭘?

1283
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,733
Do what?

1284
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:15,322
너 다시 만나면 보여주려고
가지고 있었는데

1285
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:15,322
l kept it to show you,
if we ever met again.

1286
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,688
진짜 오래 걸렸다

1287
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,688
But it took so long.

1288
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:22,088
너 어쩜 노래를
그렇게 잘 하냐?

1289
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:22,088
You're a great singer.

1290
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:25,294
내가 그거 칠만번은
본 거 가은데

1291
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:25,294
l watched you
like a million times.

1292
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:28,167
사실 보면서 조금 울었다

1293
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:28,167
l even cried a little.

1294
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:31,800
나 사실 거기 나간 거...

1295
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:31,800
l entered the contest...

1296
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:39,182
뭐 그거 혹시 방송타면
오빠가 나 보지 않을까해서...

1297
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:39,182
Thinking maybe you'd see me
on the air...

1298
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:46,245
그럼 뭐 다시 만날수 있지 않을까...
뭐 그런 것도 좀 있어

1299
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:46,245
Then maybe we could meet again.

1300
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,802
왜 말씀 안하셨어요?

1301
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,802
Why didn't you tell me?

1302
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,429
예?

1303
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,429
Pardon?

1304
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,565
기동이 잘 치는 거~

1305
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,565
That Ki-dong can play so well.

1306
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,443
얘 여기서 고스톱 쳤어요?

1307
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,443
He played cards here?

1308
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,591
야, 너, 여기서 그걸...

1309
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,591
How can you...

1310
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,559
기동아

1311
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,559
Ki-dong?

1312
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,027
아까 그거 삼촌 보여드려

1313
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,027
Can you show your uncle?

1314
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,925
아니 그걸 우리 셋이
그걸 왜 그걸 여기서 쳐...

1315
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,925
You want us to play it here?

1316
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:31,394
야, 하지마
기동아 하지마 야 왜...

1317
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:31,394
Don't do it, Ki-dong!

1318
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,038
좀 칩디다

1319
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,038
Pretty good.

1320
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:25,014
어쨌거나 니가
이제 원장선생님 집에

1321
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:27,317
Now that you're going to the
director's house for piano lessons.

1322
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:27,317
피아노 배우러 왔다갔다
이렇게 다니기로 했잖아. 어?

1323
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,184
네

1324
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,184
Yeah?

1325
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:31,121
어, 그러면은 그 혹시
그... 남자친구가 있는지 좀

1326
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:33,247
Can you find out
if she has a boyfriend or not?

1327
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:33,248
이렇게 알아봐 주면
안되겠니?

1328
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,195
그러니까 좀 자연스럽게

1329
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,195
Act natural

1330
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,731
절대 내가 시켜서 했다는
티가 나면 안돼요

1331
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,731
without her catching on
that l put you up to it.

1332
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:46,269
요새 만나는 남자가 있는지
없다면 만날 의향은 있는지

1333
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:46,269
Find out
if she's willing to date.

1334
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:50,262
의향이 있다면 나에 대해선
어떻게 생각을 하는지...

1335
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:50,262
lf she is, then find out
what she thinks about me.

1336
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,971
아이 그걸 왜 집에서
타고 난리야~!

1337
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,971
Not in the house!

1338
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,540
아이 잘했다 기동아

1339
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,540
Good job, Ki-dong.

1340
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,711
조금만 쉬자 기동아

1341
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,711
Let's take a break.

1342
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,616
원장님~!

1343
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,616
Ms. Cho?

1344
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:05,479
없어?

1345
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:05,479
No boyfriend?

1346
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:06,990
크~ 좋았어

1347
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:06,990
Alright!

1348
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,016
자~ 그럼 우리 이번엔
이렇게 해볼까?

1349
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,016
Now, for step two.

1350
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:16,023
제가 식사 한번 대접 할게요
어떤 음식 좋아하세요?

1351
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:16,023
Let me treat you to dinner.
What do you like?

1352
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,463
저 돈가스...
이런 거 다 좋아해요

1353
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,463
l like cutlets.
Anything, really.

1354
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,810
돈가스에 후추?

1355
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,810
Cutlets with black pepper?

1356
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,549
소스 없이 후추만?

1357
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,549
No sauce?

1358
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,549
아~ 나 돈가스
진짜 싫어하는데

1359
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,549
But l hate cutlets.

1360
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:45,793
하이튼 그래서?

1361
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:45,793
Anything else?

1362
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,333
선생님~

1363
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,333
Ms. Cho!

1364
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,908
얘들아, 너무 뛰지 말구

1365
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,908
Stop running around.

1366
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,646
게임 하는 남자? 음...

1367
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,646
Men who play computer games well?

1368
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,224
게임 잘하는 남자?

1369
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,224
Men who play computer games well?

1370
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:16,923
확실해?

1371
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:16,923
You sure?

1372
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,887
아 이거 매치가 안 되는데...

1373
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,887
That doesn't match up.

1374
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,553
좀 나갔다 올게요

1375
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,553

1376
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,459
아, 이거 남자 목소리가
들리는 듯 해 어?

1377

아 오늘 뭐 그 갈치 조림을

1381

But it's fried fish night.

1382
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:39,009
아 내가 지금 반찬투정을
하는게 아니고

1383
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:39,009
l'm not whining about the food.

1384
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,084
아니 사람이 밥을 먹어야지

1385
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,084
Aren't you coming home to eat?

1386
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,381
아이 몰라 끊어!

1387
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,381

00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,533
아직 안 먹었습니다

1409
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,533
No plans, yet.

1410
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,311
가실까요?

1411
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,311
Shall we?

1412
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,507
근데 기동이가 졸리다고...

1413
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,507
But Ki-dong says he's sleepy.

1414
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:51,721
나 할머니랑 있을래요

1415
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:51,721
l wanna stay with granny.

1416
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:52,956
누구 할머니?

1417
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:52,956
Granny?

1418
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:54,757
저희 엄마...

1419
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:54,757
My mother.

1420
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,815
가...

1421
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,815
Go.

1422
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:59,853
가... 가...

1423
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:59,853
Go.

1424
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:16,074
제가 돈가스를 제일 좋아해서요
광고 보셨죠?

1425
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:16,074
Cutlets are my favorite!
Did you see my commercial?

1426
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:21,150
아! 여기에 이 또 후추를
뿌려 먹으면 되게 맛있는데...

1427
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:21,150
l love putting
black pepper on it.

1428
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,583
소스없이

1429
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,583
Without the sauce.

1430
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:24,819
저도 그거 좋아해요

1431
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:24,819
l love that, too.

1432
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:28,558
어? 이런 사람 흔하지 않은데?

1433
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:28,558
Really? That's not common.

1434
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:31,527
야~ 이거 뭐 운명인가요?
아이 참~

1435
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:31,527
Must be fate.

1436
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,631
아니 쉬는 날
주로 뭐 하세요?

1437
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,631
What do you do
on the weekends?

1438
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,332
언제 게임 한 번
안 하실래요?

1439
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,332
Wanna play a
computer game with me?

1440
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:38,766
저는 뭐 거의 중독자
수준이거든요

1441
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:38,766
l'm a total fanatic.

1442
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:41,504
아이~ 그저께 이거
허리 끊어질 뻔 했잖아요

1443
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:43,206
l almost broke my back
playing the other day.

1444
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,206
아유 어제 겨우 붙였네

1445
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,936
게임 하는 남자
싫어 한다는 얘기였는데...

1446
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,936
l meant l didn't like men
who play computer games.

1447
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:48,373
전달이 잘못 된 것 가네요

1448
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:48,373
You got the wrong message.

1449
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:56,116
아무래도 기동이를 거처서 가니까
그럴 수도 있죠...

1450
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:56,116
Since it goes through
Ki-dong and all.

1451
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:01,215
그냥 저한테 바로
물어보셔도 되는데

1452
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:01,215
You could've just asked me.

1453
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:10,022
어떤 남자한테
매력을 느끼시는지?

1454
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:10,022
What kind of men are
you attracted to?

1455
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:38,319
사실 제가 2집 망하고
노래 끊은 지 좀 됐는데...

1456
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:38,319
l stopped singing since
my second album bombed.

1457
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:43,355
뭐 제 노래 할 거 아니니까
안심하시고요

1458
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:43,355
Don't worry.

Why are you out so late?

1509
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:22,959
왜? 걱정돼서?

1510
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:22,959
Why? Worried about me?

1511
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:24,060
남자 만났지?

1512
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:24,060
Were you with a man?

1513

그래서 지금 내가 입고 있어

01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:51,069
You know it?
lt's a hidden classic.

1566
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:51,074
야 이게 완전히
숨겨진 명곡이거든. 어?

1567
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,707
여자 키로 바꾸면 되니까...

1568
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,707
We can change it to your key.

1569
01:05:56,252 --> 01:06:00,245
나의 기억 속에

1570
01:05:56,252 --> 01:06:00,245
ln my memories

1571
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:05,061
그 어릴 적 소원들이

1572
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:05,061
Of childhood dreams...

1573
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:07,363
사랑고백 하듯이
신랑님께서 신부님한테...

1574
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:07,363
Show more love!

1575
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:08,097
- 그렇지 그렇지
- 아, 요렇게 요렇게...

1576
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:08,097
- That's it!
- Like this?

1577
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:08,764
아 스탑!

1578
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:08,764
Stop!

1579
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:12,335
비발디~ 비발디~ 자, 상윤씨
커피 한 잔만~ 오케이. 좋아요

1580
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:12,335
Great! Get me some coffee,
Sang-yoon.

1581
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:15,065
하지마 하지마!
하지마 상윤씨 하지마! 하...

1582
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:15,065
No, stop! Don't!

1583
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,371
쉬었다 가시죠

1584
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,371
Let's take five.

1585
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:23,312
상윤씨 전에 스턴트맨 했어?
여기서 왜 이 지랄이야?!

1586
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:24,611
What are you a klutz?
Get out of the way!

1587
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,609
저리 나와, 내가 치울테니까

1588
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:26,716
아아, 대가리야

1589
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:26,716
Ouch, my head!

1590
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:31,053
빠가야로~ 쥬노 세파~
이게 뭐하는 짓이야

1591
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:33,519
What the hell!
l don't believe this.

1592
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:33,521
내 스타일 다 구기고

1593
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,228
왜?

1594
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,228
What's wrong?

1595
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:43,597
어, 아니. 아 그 디제이
남현수있잖아

1596
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:43,597
You know Hyun-soo Nam, the DJ?

1597
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:47,536
그 사람 소문이 안좋더라구
완전 싸가지 없구

1598
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:47,536
He's got a pretty bad rep.

1599
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:48,901
몰라...

1600
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:48,901
Really?

1601
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,996
아, 인터넷 안보는구나?

1602
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,996
Don't you surf the Net?

1603
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:54,010
그 맨날 어란 여자애들
바꿔가면서

1604
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:56,278
He dates young girls and
likes to do freaky things.

1605
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,278
변태짓을 그렇게 좋아한다
그러더라구

1606
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:59,008
- 여자 팬티도 즐겨 입...
- 아니거든!

1607
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:59,008
- He wears their underwear and...
- No, he doesn't!

1608
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,793
그런 거 아니지?

1609
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,793
Tell me it's not true.

1610
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:22,736
넌 아난거잖아... 가이...

1611
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:22,736
You can't be.

1612
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:25,866
살거나 그런 거
아난 거잖아?

1613
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:25,866
You're not living
with him are you?

1614
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,504
응?

1615
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,504
Right?

1616
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,372
어?

1617
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,372
Right?

1618
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,475
나중에 얘기해줄게

1619
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,475
l'll tell you everything later.

1620
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,308
잤지?

1621
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,308
You slept with him?

1622
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,444
잤구나...

1623
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,444
You did.

1624
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,958
내가 남현수 이 새끼 찾아가서
그냥 확 그냥 다 엎어버...

1625
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,958
l'll get that bastard!

1626
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:44,186
야!

1627
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:44,186
Stop it!

1628
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,954
너 그러기만 해봐

1629
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,954
Don't you dare.

1630
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:51,967
아 편드세요 지금? 숨겨주는 거야?
그 새끼 다칠까봐?

1631
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:51,967
You're covering for him?
So he won't get hurt?

1632
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:54,026
다 뽀록 날까봐?

1633
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:54,026
So he won't be exposed?

1634
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:57,373
그 새끼가 그렇게 좋디?
걔가 데리고 살아주니까 좋아?

1635
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:57,373
You like him that much for
taking you in to live with him?

1636
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:00,638
그래 좋다. 좋아 죽겠다

1637
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:00,638
Yeah, l like him! So what!

1638
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:04,780
나 남현수 가만 안 둬

1639
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:04,780
He's going down.

1640
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:08,648
어느 기자가 자기한테 사진 넘겨주면
다 알아서 한댔어

1641
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:08,648
Some reporter said he'd ruin him
if l gave him the pictures.

1642
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:11,481
남현수 이 새끼
완전히 망쳐버릴거야! 이씨!

1643
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:11,481
l'll destroy him!

1644
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,396
넌 옛날이나
지금이나 똑가애

1645
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,396
You haven't changed one bit!

1646
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:26,026
다시는 우리 앞에
나타나지마

1647
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:26,026
Get out of our lives for good!

1648
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:38,046
너 그렇게 굶었냐?

1649
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:38,046
Were you that desperate?

1650
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:41,275
이젠 출연자한테까지
껄떡 되셨어?

1651
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:41,275
Did you have to mess
with the contestants?

1652
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,578
누가 벌써 제보했더만

1653
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,578
Someone sent in a tip.

1654
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:48,185
봉필중 이 새끼
벌써 호미질하고 다녀

1655
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:48,185
Reporter Bong is
already digging around.

1656
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:52,324
너 2집 자빠지고
한 3년 추워 봤잖아

1657
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:52,324
You've been out cold for
three years after your second album.

1658
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:56,155
이 바닥 스텝 꼬이면은
한 순간인 거 몰라?

1659
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:56,155
Forget that everything can
crumble in a flash in this field?

1660
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,890
알죠

1661
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,890
l know, sir.

1662
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,369
제인인가 걔

1663
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,369
That girl Jae-in?

1664
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,667
연말에 노래 부르는 거
못 나오게 해

1665
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,667
Make sure she doesn't come
to the finals.

1666
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:06,764
스캔달 나고 그러면은
자빠지는 거 나 아니다

1667
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:06,764
l'm not the one to
fall to a scandal.

1668
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,240
너야 너

1669
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,240
lt's you!

1670
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,227
써요

1671
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,227
l'm using it.

1672
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:38,135
얘기 좀 하지~

1673
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:38,135
We need to talk.

1674
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,006
어?

1675
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,006
Please?

1676
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:43,338
쫌 걸리는데...

1677
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:43,338
lt'll be a while.

1678
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,246
저기...

1679
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,246
Look.

1680
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:55,485
그 공개방송
나가는 거 말이야...

1681
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:55,485
About the singing finals...

1682
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:58,082
들어?

1683
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:58,082
Are you listening?

1684
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:00,092
말해요

1685
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:00,092
Go on.

1686
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:05,134
아니 내가 요즘
뭐 광고도 좀 들어오고

1687
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:07,128
l landed some commercials
and the show's going great.

1688
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,125
개편도 얼마 안 남고...

1689
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,033
뭐 그렇다고...

1690
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,033
That's that.

1691
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,672
그런데...

1692
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,672
But...

1693
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:13,738
너... 저...

1694
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:13,738
You...

1695
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:17,237
그 나가지 말자

1696
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:17,237
Let's stop here.

1697
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,817
아니 니가 뭐 방송 나가
어, 일등 한다 쳐

1698
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:23,852
So you go and win,
then what?

1699
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,852
그 다음은 어쩔 건데?

1700
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:26,288
니가 뭐 내 딸이다
애도 있는 미혼모다

1701
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:28,255
Tell everyone you're
my daughter and a single mom?

1702
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,256
뭐 이러고 다닐 거야?

1703
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:33,890
아 그러면 너도 힘들구
나도 힘들구...

1704
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:33,890
Then it'll be hard
for both of us.

1705
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:37,155
너 안 그럴거라는 거
내가 아는데

1706
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:37,155
l know you won't tell...

1707
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:41,604
아니 막말로 니 존재가
알려져 봐봐. 나 완전 끝이야

1708
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:41,604
But if people find out about you,
my career's over!

1709
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:44,471
너 내가 2집 망하고
여기까지 오는데 얼마나 고생...

1710
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:44,471
You know how hard it was
for me to get here after...

1711
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,082
이상한 전화가 왔는데

1712
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,082
l got a strange call saying

1713
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,919
황제인이랑 동거하는 거
다 안다구 조심하라구...

1714
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,919
they know about him living
with Jae-in Hwang.

1715
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,754
눈빛 주고 받는 거 같더라고

1716
01:10:56,919 --> 01:11:00,522
l knew something was up
between them!

1717
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,522
저번에 괜히 PD님한테
막 화내고 그랬잖아

1718
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:02,858
- 야! 왔어

- He's here!

1720
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:07,496

개버릇 못버리고 뒷통수를 갈겨?

1721
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:07,496
l took you in when you were down
and this is the thanks l get?

1722

너 아주 개편 영순윈줄 알어

1723
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:11,455
Pack your bags next season!

1724
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:19,938
제인아

1725
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:19,938
Jae-in.

1726
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:25,242
제인아 나랑 얘기 좀 하자

1727
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:25,242
Please, talk to me.

1728
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:30,407
오빠가 잘 할게
오빠가 잘 할게

1729
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:30,407
l'll be good.

1731
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:31,854
Listen to me.

1732
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:36,314
오빠 너 구해야 돼. 네가 악의
구렁텅이 안에 산다는 걸 안 이상...

1733
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:36,314
l have to save you. l can't let
you live in that hellhole.

1734
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:41,253
잠깐만 잠깐만
제인아 잠깐만

1735
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:41,253
Please, Jae-in! Don't go!

1736
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:46,969
남현수 이 색골 새끼야
어디 있어?

1737
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:46,969
Where's Hyun-soo Nam!
You bastard!

1738
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,664
남현수 나와!

1739
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,664
Come out!

1740
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,839

1741
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,839
Go. We'll talk later.

1742
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:54,543
내가 책임진다고 그랬잖아
내가 더 잘 해 줄 거라고

1743
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:54,543
Let me take care of you.

1744
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,211
가. 부탁 할게~

1745
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,211
Please, just go.

1746
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:59,815
나 그때 니 눈빛에서
다 읽었어. 응?

1747
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:59,815
l could see it in your eyes.

1748
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:03,945
나 구해달라고
응 나 도와달라고

1749
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:03,945
Begging me to save you.

1750
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:08,114
그 집에서 나와서
나한테 오고 싶다고

1751
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:08,114
And help you escape from
that house.

1752
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:10,693
오빠가 구해줄게. 응?

1753
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:14,090
l'll save you from
that freak!

1754
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:14,094
내가 그 돈 많고
그 뺀질이 한테서 꼭 구해서...

1755
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,153
나오라 그래~

1756
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,153
Where is he!

1757
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,574
너 처음부터
이럴려고 온 거지?

1758
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,574
You came to ruin me,
didn't you?

1759
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,479
니 엄마가 시키디?

1760
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,479
Did your mom put you up to it?

1761
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,210
자기 인생 망쳤으니까
가서 내 인생 조지라고?

1762
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,210
To destroy my life
for ruining hers?

1763
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,652
엄마 인생 망친 적 없어요

1764
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,652
Mom's life was never ruined.

1765
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:38,620
그럼 왜 이러는 건데? 응?

1766
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:38,620
Then why are you doing this?

1767
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:42,324
혼자 조지기 힘드니까
어디서 토하는 놈 하나 데려왔드라?

1768
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:42,324
You even brought in
some loser to help you?

1769
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:45,782
뭐라 그랬냐?
한 몫 챙겨준다 그랬냐?

1770
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:45,782
Did you promise him a cut?

1771
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:49,487
어디서 눈을 똑바로 떠?

1772
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:49,487
Don't look at me like that!

1773
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:52,156
다녀왔습니다

1774
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:52,156
l'm home.

1775
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:58,272
좀 있다 해요

1776
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:58,272
Not now.

1777
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,310
뭘 있다가 해?
이따가 시간 없어

1778
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,310
Yes, now!

1779
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:04,046
야 니들 가
짐 싸갔고 빨리 가

1780
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:04,046
Just pack up and leave!

1781
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:07,516
가서 신문사에 까발리건
방송 나가서 마이크 잡고 떠벌리건

1782
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:07,516
Go ahead and tell the papers
and the stations!

1783
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,677
니 애 새끼 데리고
좀 사라져!

1784
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,677
Just take your kid and
get the hell out!

1785
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:17,659
기동이 들어가 있어

1786
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:17,659
Go to your room, Ki-dong.

1787
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:20,719
- 어딜 들어가?
- 빨리 안 들어가?

1788
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:20,719
- Stay right there!
- Go in, now!

1789
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,175
나 못 가요

1790
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,175
l'm not leaving.

1791
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:34,243
못 가?

1792
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:34,243
What?

1793
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,645
나 아부지 자식이야
딸이야

1794
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,645
l'm your daughter, dad.

1795
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:38,545
나 여기 있을 자격 있어

1796
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:38,545
l have a right to be here.

1797
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:39,982
돈 때문이야?

1798
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:39,982
You want money?

1799
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:41,417
돈 줄게

1800
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:41,417
Fine, l'll give you money!

1801
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,685
집도 얻어줄게
해준다 그랬잖아

1802
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,685
l told you l'd get you a house.

1803
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:46,288
빌어먹을 차도 사줘?
다 해준다고!

1804
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:46,288
You want a car, too? Fine!

1805
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:48,891
그러니까 가라구
걸리적 거리니까 좀 꺼지라고!

1806
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:48,891
Just leave!
Get the hell out of my life!

1807
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:50,392
내가 돈 때문에 온거야?

1808
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:50,392
You think l came
for the money?

1809
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:52,227
너 돈 때문에 왔잖아

1810
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:55,431
You came because you can't raise
your damn kid by yourself!

1811
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:55,431
니가 싸질러 논 애 새끼
데리고 살기 힘들어서

1812
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,899
아니야?

1813
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,899
Didn't you?

1814
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:59,902
그럼 나한테 아빠질
뭐 그런 거 바라고 온거야?

1815
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:59,902
Then you came looking
for me to be your father?

1816
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:01,403
그래!

1817
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:01,403
Yes!

1818
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,005
나 그거 바라고 왔다

1819
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,005
That's why l came!

1820
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:04,873
그거 바라고 왔어

1821
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:04,873
l wanted my father!

1822
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:08,070
남들 다 아빠 있잖아
다 있잖아!

1823
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:08,070
Everyone else has a dad!

1824
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:11,146
나 왜 있는 아빠도
없다고 하면서 살아야 돼?

1825
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:11,146
Why can't l live with mine?

1826
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,315
내가 나오고 싶어서 나왔어?

1827
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,315
l didn't ask to be born!

1828
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:17,786
나 조용히 살겠다잖아
하고 싶은 노래도 안 하면서 살겠다잖아!

1829
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:17,786
All l wanted to do was to live
quietly and sing!

1830
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,988
내가 뭘 그렇게 잘못 했는데?

1831
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,988
What did l do so wrong!

1832
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:21,649
여기 있는 내 눈

1833
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:21,649
My eyes!

1834
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:23,292
이거 코

1835
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:23,292
My nose!

1836
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,661
이거 다 아부지가
만든 거잖아

1837
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,661
You made me!

1838
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,129
나 여기 있잖아

1839
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,129
l'm here, dad!

1840
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,031
왜 내가 없었으면 해?

1841
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,031
Why don't you want me around?

1842
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,065
왜?!

1843
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,065
Why!

1844
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:33,057
내가 여기 이렇게 있는데 왜?!

1845
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:33,057
When l'm right here!

1846
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,405
너 원한적 없어

1847
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,405
l never wanted you.

1848
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:38,524
그동안 신세 많았어요

1849
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:38,524
Thank you for everything.

1850
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:39,828
너...

1851
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:39,828
But...

1852
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:43,064
다신 안와요
없는 듯 살게요

1853
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:43,064
l won't bother you again.

1854
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:44,863
건강하세요

1855
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:44,863
Take care.

1856
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:02,758
전화도 한 통 없구?

1857
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:02,758
She hasn't called?

1858
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:03,759
없고~

1859
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:03,759
Nope.

1860
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,193
니가 해보지

1861
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,193
So call her.

1862
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:06,662
내가 뿌셨어

1863
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:06,662
l broke her phone.

1864
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,493
걱정 안돼?

1865
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,493
Aren't you worried?

1866
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:11,033
- 내 걱정은 돼
- 야

1867
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:11,033
- l'm worried about me.
- Look.

1868
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:15,936
뭘 그렇게 복잡하게 사냐?
그냥 밝혀~

1869
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:15,936
lt's simple.
Just confess it.

1870
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,739
니가 무슨 아이돌이야?

1871
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,739
You're no mega star.

1872
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:20,435
너 이제
인기 하나도 없거든~

1873
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:20,435
You're not that popular.

1874
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:22,301
인기 있거든

1875
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:22,301
l am, too.

1876
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,280
지랄이 지랄을 나셨네. 어~

1877
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,280
You lost your mind!

1878
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,317
야 솔직히 알지도 못하는
사람이 중요하냐?

1879
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,317
Who's more important?

1880
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:31,587
아니면 뜬금없이 찾아왔어도
니 새끼가 중요하냐?

1881
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:31,587
Strangers or your long
lost daughter?

1882
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:34,489
지들이 알아서
다 커서 왔으면은

1883
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:34,489
She's all grown up.

1884
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:38,727
그게 땡큔거지 임마~
참~ 나 이거

1885
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:38,727
You should be thankful!

1886
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:42,390
아이~ 거 개병원 아니랄까봐
무지하게 낑낑거리구 증말

1887
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:42,390
Why's there so much yapping
in this dog hospital?

1888
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:47,869
아주 짐승하고 인간하고
입체 써라운드로다가 아주

1889
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:47,869
Yapping and barking everywhere.

1890
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:50,133
가서 안주나 더 가져와

1891
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:50,133
Get me another drink.

1892
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,599
너는 이거나 처먹어
이 시끼야. 이런...

1893
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,599
Shove this dog food down
your throat instead.

1894
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:59,338
쟤들도 지들 새끼 없어졌다고
저러는 거야 임마~

1895
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:59,338
Even the dogs are crying
because their puppies are gone.

1896
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,636
유리 다 제거 했구요
여기에 서명 좀...

1897
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,636
Your recorder is all fixed now.

1898
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:55,771
여기요~

1899
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:55,771
Excuse me?

1900
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,170
잠시만요

1901
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,170
Hold on, please.

1902
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:20,862
- 줘 봐봐
- 아 노래 내가 할거잖아요

1903
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:20,862
- Give me that.
- l'm the one who'll be singing.

1904
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:24,764
내가 원곡자거든?
애가 학습의 의지가 없어

1905
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:24,764
l'm the original singer.
Listen up.

1906
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:35,476
나의 기억속에
그 어릴 적 소원들이

1907
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:35,476
ln my memories of childhood dreams

1908
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:39,678
지금 이순간에...

1909
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:39,678
Even at this moment

1910
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,207
아유 됐다~

1911
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,207
Forget it.

1912
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,654
야 이게 여기서
이렇게 부르니까 그렇지

1913
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:49,558
lmagine singing this on the stage
with 50 choir members behind you.

1914
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:49,558
너 나중에 무대 응? 무대 뒤에다가
이렇게 50명 코러스 쫙~ 깔고

1915
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,260
오브리 쫘악~ 들어가면
이거 완전 작살나거든?

1916
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,260
Add in strings.
lt's a classic!

1917
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,795
느낌이 다르잖아 느낌이

1918
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,795
More feeling!

1919
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:56,531
그럼 아버지가
나가서 노래하시던가

1920
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:56,531
Then you sing it, dad.

1921
01:18:56,531 --> 01:18:59,034
DJ하다가 노래하다가
혼자 다 해 먹으면 되겠네

1922
01:18:56,531 --> 01:18:59,034
Be the DJ, the singer,
and everything!

1923
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:02,060
가르쳐준다고 그럴때
잘 좀 배우세요

1924
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:02,060
Listen when
l'm trying to teach you.

1925
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:10,803
- 애기 엄마 탕 두개 나왔어요
- 예~

1926
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:10,803
- Two stews to serve!
- Coming!

1927
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:13,804
이모 3번에 뼈 두 개요

1928
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:13,804
Two more for table three.

1929
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:18,286
뼈 두개 나왔습니다~
맛있게 드세요

1930
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:18,286
Here's your stew. Enjoy.

1931
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:19,821
- 여기 물 좀 더 주세요
- 에?

1932
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:19,821
- Water, please.
- What?

1933
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:22,891
아 그건 셀픈데 잘 생겼으니까
내가 하나 갖다드릴게

1934
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:22,891
Right away, sir.

1935
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,092
- 여기요
- 네?

1936
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,092
- Miss?
- Yes?

1937
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,093
오뎅 좀 더 주세요

1938
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,093
More tofu, please.

1939
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:29,154
아 오뎅 거덜나게 생겼네
금방 갖다 드릴게요

1940
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:29,154
Right away, sir!

1941
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:32,597
어, 언니 잠시만, 잠시만
자리, 자리 있어요, 있어요

1942
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:32,597
Wait, we have room.

1943
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:34,603
여기 이 아저씨랑
가이 먹으면 안될까

1944
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:37,038
Mind sitting here with them?
l'll add in extra side dishes.

1945
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,038
내가 그 계란 후라이
하나 드릴게. 어?

1946
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:38,403
미안해요~

1947
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:38,403
Sorry.

1948
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:48,980
라디오 좀 켜봐

1949
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:48,980
Turn the radio on.

1950
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:51,652
켜봐, 켜고 올라와~

1951
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:51,652
Turn it up.

1952
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:55,253
이구, 허리야. 맨날 아파

1953
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:55,253
Ouch, my back.

1954
01:19:57,726 --> 01:20:00,028
예, 뭐 무엇보다
건강이 우선이죠

1955
01:19:57,726 --> 01:20:00,028
Being healthy is most important.

1956
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:03,732
강영주씨, 임한희씨
건강하게 잘 사셨으면 좋겠네요

1957
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:03,732
l hope you both get healthy soon.

1958
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:06,768
사연 감사하구요
오래오래 행복하십쇼

1959
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:06,768
Thank you for sending
in your story.

1960
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:10,795
자, 남현수 오후의 휴식
오늘 마지막 사연으로

1961
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:10,795
Now for Afternoon Radio's
fi]nal story for today.

1962
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:14,509
아주 오랜만에 사연을
또 보내주셨습니다

1963
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:14,509
lt's been a while since
we heard from her.

1964
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:18,138
미혼모 황정남씨의 사연입니다

1965
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:18,138
lt's a letter from
the single mom, Jung-nam Hwang.

1966
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:26,181
아버지와 심하게 다툰 후
집을 나왔습니다

1967
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:26,181
l left my father's house
after a big fi]ght.

1968
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:29,291
아버지가 좀 심한 말을
하시긴 했지만

1969
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:29,291
He said some harsh things,

1970
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:32,260
사실 그게 진심은
아니었을텐데요

1971
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:32,260
he probably didn't mean.

1972
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:36,164
아버지도 횟김에 흥분해서

1973
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:39,067
He blurted some things
in the heat of anger.

1974
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:39,067
자신도 모르게
뱉은 말이었을텐데

1975
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,365
그래서 후회하고 계실텐데요

1976
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,365
And is probably regretting it.

1977
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:46,231
그런 아버지를 생각하면
다시 돌아가고 싶지만

1978
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:46,231
l want to go back to him.

1979
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:50,344
어떻게 화해를 하고 돌아가야
할지 잘 모르겠습니다

1980
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:50,344
But l don't know how to make up
and go back.

1981
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:53,637
남현수씨께서 알려주세요

1982
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:53,637
Any ideas?

1983
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,083
황정남씨

1984
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,083
Ms. Hwang?

1985
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,215
이 방송 듣고 계신다면

1986
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,215
If you're listening...

1987
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:04,357
아버지께 전화하세요. 꼭

1988
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:04,357
Call your father, now.

1989
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:12,027
- 저기요, 참이슬 하나만 주세요
- 네~ 금방 가요

1990
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:12,027
- A beer, please.
- Right away!

1991
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:20,336
- 추우면 불 떼고
- 네. 안녕히 가세요

1992
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:20,336
- Turn the heater on.
- Yes, goodnight.

1993
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:45,189
할아버지네 안 가?

1994
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:45,189
Can't we go to grandpa's?

1995
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,264
할아버지 보고 싶어?

1996
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,264
You miss him?

1997
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:57,343
사람 괜찮드만

1998
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:57,343
He's a pretty good guy.

1999
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:03,813
아, 간지러...

2000
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:03,813
That tickles.

2001
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,187
자자

2002
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,187
Let's sleep.

2003
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:16,031
이게 계속 반복될 것
같더라구요

2004
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:18,833
So l went to get a waxing job
because of him.

2005
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:18,833
그래서 제가 병원가서
제모 수술을 확 해버렸어요

2006
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:20,869
- 그랬더니 이번엔 발목이 왜 이렇게 두껍냐면서
- 선배! 선배! 모니터, 모니터!

2007
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:22,304
- Then he said my ankles were thick!
- Look at the monitor!

2008
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,304
또 지적질을 하는 거예요

2009
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:24,706
어후 그래... 이제 이 놈이
원하는 걸 해준다

2010
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:24,706
That made me so mad and...

2011
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:27,676
뭐 그렇게 하기 보다는
오기가 막 생기더라구요

2012
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:27,676
Jung-nam Hwang is on the line
That made me so mad and...

2013
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:30,211
그래서 제가 병원에 갔어요
뼈 깍아 달라고

2014
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:31,479
So l went to the hospital,
but the doctor said...

2015
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:31,479
그랬더니 의사 선생님이
저한테 그러시더라구요

2016
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:33,214
- 김장미씨
 - 네?

2017
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:33,214
- Ms. Kim?
- Yes?

2018
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:34,683
- 그냥 헤어지세요
 - 네?

2019
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:34,683
- Just break up with him.
- What?

2020
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:37,049
아 예... 저...
사연 감사합니다

2021
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:37,049
Thank you for calling in.

2022
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:39,821
자 그럼 계속해서
오랜만에 전화를 주신

2023
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:42,886
Now, we're on line
with Jung-nam Hwang.

2024
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:42,881
황정남씨와 연결이 되있습니다

2025
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:44,748
여보세요?

2026
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:44,748
Hello?

2027
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,129
황정남씨?

2028
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,129
Jung-nam?

2029
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:49,892
지금 어디세요?

2030
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:49,892
Where are you calling from?

2031
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:54,493
전화를 하셨으면 말씀을
하셔야죠. 여보세요?

2032
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:54,493
You're on the air. Hello?

2033
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:58,503
여전히 글은 잘 쓰시네요

2034
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:58,503
You're writing well as usual.

2035
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:04,572
숨어서 연락을 안 하신다고 문제가
다 해결 되는 건 아닙니다

2036
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:04,572
Hiding and not calling won't
solve the problem.

2037
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:09,117
문제는 제 존재 자체가
문제였던 것 같습니다

2038
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:09,117
My existence itseIf
is the problem.

2039
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:12,416
누가 그러던가요?
아버지가 그러던가요?

2040
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:12,416
Who said that?
Your father?

2041
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:15,716
정남씨

2042
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:15,716
Jung-nam...

2043
01:23:15,957 --> 01:23:19,828
사연으로 보내셨듯이
아버지가 그런 얘기를 했더라도...

2044
01:23:15,957 --> 01:23:19,828
Just like you wrote before...

2045
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:24,663
혹시 감정이 격해서 말 실수
뭐 그런거 아니었을까요?

2046
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:24,663
Maybe your father made
a mistake in an angry moment.

2047
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:28,069
- 실수 아니거든요
- 그거 실수 맞거든요

2048
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:28,069
- lt wasn't a mistake.
- Yes, it was!

2049
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:30,060
저희 아버지 아세요?

2050
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:30,060
Do you know my dad?

2051
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:36,439
아... 모... 모...
모르죠. 네~

2052
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:36,439
Ah, of course not.

2053
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:39,080
평생 저란 존재도 모르고

2054
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:42,817
He lived his whole life
without even knowing l existed.

2055
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:42,817
자기 인생 줄겁게 살던
사람한테 갑자기 찾아가서

2056
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:46,878
선뜻 자식으로 인정하고 받아주리라고
생각했던 게 잘못이었습니다

2057
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:46,878
l was wrong to think he'd
suddenly welcome me into his life.

2058
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:50,492
그럼 자기 혼자 아니라고 생각되면
그냥 떠나면 되는 겁니까?

2059
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:50,492
You can'tjust walk away
like that.

2060
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,494
그럼 다 해결이
되는 거예요?

2061
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,494
That doesn't solve anything.

2062
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:56,197
할 말 다하지 못한 아버지 얘기도
좀 들어봐야 되는 거 아닙니까?

2063
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:56,197
Shouldn't you listen to
what your father has to say?

2064
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:58,062
얘기 해보세요

2065
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:58,062
Be my guest.

2066
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:04,328
제가 아버지의 딸이 되기에는

2067
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:04,328
For me to be my father's daughter,

2068
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:07,771
저희 아버지는
너무 잃을게 많습니다

2069
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:07,771
he has too much to lose.

2070
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,843
그 동안 사연
소개해주셔서 감사했습니다

2071
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,843
Thank you for airing my stories.

2072
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:14,776
저... 저기요. 정남씨

2073
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:14,776
Wait! Jung-nam!

2074
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,612
야 정대야 음악 음악

2075
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,612
Music! Now!

2076
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,719
황정남씨

2077
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,719
Jung-nam?

2078
01:24:25,627 --> 01:24:28,118
아직도 이 방송을
듣고 계신다면

2079
01:24:25,627 --> 01:24:28,118
If you're still listening,

2080
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,694
한 마디만 드리겠습니다

2081
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,694
l have just one thing to say.

2082
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,630
아버지를 용서하고
안하고를 떠나서

2083
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,630
Whether you forgive
your father or not.

2084
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:37,870
본인의 꿈까지 접지는 마십쇼

2085
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:37,870
Don't give up your dreams.

2086
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:42,067
하고 싶은 거 있댔죠?
그거 꼭 하세요

2087
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:42,067
You said you wanted to sing.
Then do it!

2088
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:44,568
누구 위해서 말고

2089
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:44,568
Not for anyone else.

2090
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:47,978
아버지, 아들 이런 거
다 떠나서

2091
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:47,978
Not your father or your son.

2092
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:50,745
자기 자신을 위해서
하십쇼 꼭

2093
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:50,745
Do it for you!

2094
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:53,948
미혼모도 하고
싶은 거 많잖아요

2095
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:53,948
Single mothers have dreams, too.

2096
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:03,057
정대야, 나간 라이트
어떤 거라고?

2097
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:03,057
Which light is out, kid?

2098
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:04,699
- 야, 나야
 - 너 말고 AD

2099
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:04,699
- lt's me.
- Get the AD on.

2100
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,301
- 아 몰라 찾고 있어
 - 불 나갔다메?

2101
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:06,301
- l'm looking.
- Which light is out?

2102
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:08,792
아 몰라몰라
아 찾으면 얘기할게

2103
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:08,792
Don't know, man.

2104
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:12,499
어. 아 여기 있네
찾았어, 찾았어

2105
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:12,499
Here he is.

2106
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:15,074
이거 흘리고 다녀

2107
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:15,074
Don't lose it.

2108
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:18,413
정대야, 라이트 나갔다메?
그거 어떤거야?

2109
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:18,413
So which light is out?

2110
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:21,950
어, 도엽이형 3번 백라이트
나갔거든요. 체크 좀 해주세요

2111
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:21,950
The number three backlight.

2112
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,284
어, 3번 백라이트

2113
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,284
The number three backlight?

2114
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:25,275
헤이저 위치. 왼쪽이요

2115
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:25,275
On the left!

2116
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,190
저 여기 출구가 어디죠?

2117
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,190
Where's the exit?

2118
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:32,125
저기요, 저기. 거기, 거기 아니예요
거기 아니예요

2119
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:32,125
That way.
No, not there.

2120
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:34,562
아 형 여기서 뭐해~?

2121
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:34,562
What are you doing?

2122
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:36,698
어 미안 미안 미안
여기 좀 봐줘

2123
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:36,698
Stay here for a sec.

2124
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,066
3번 나갔다. 3번~

2125
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,066
Number three is out!

2126
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:40,159
저기 3번 체크좀요

2127
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:40,159
Check on three!

2128
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:46,231
저 어떻게 황제인이꺼
지금이라도 취소 시킬까요?

2129
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:46,231
Should we cancel
on Jae-in Hwang's act?

2130
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:50,436
지금 취소하면
일당 반만 줘도 되는데...

2131
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:50,436
We won't have to pay them all
if we cancel now.

2132
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:52,847
너 딸이 몇 살이라고 그랬지?

2133
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:52,847
How old is your daughter?

2134
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:54,747
내년에 유치원 들어가죠

2135
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:54,747
Going into kindergarten next year.

2136
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:57,452
언제 키워서 손자 보냐?

2137
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:57,452
When will you raise her
and get a grandson?

2138
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:58,817
에?

2139
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:58,817
Huh?

2140
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,553
취소시켜~

2141
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,553
Cancel it.

2142
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:06,427
취소~ 그거 취소해

2143
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:06,427
Cancel it!

2144
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:34,213
십분 후에
무대 리허설 있겠습니다

2145
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:34,213
10 minutes to full rehearsals!

2146
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:36,524
자, 십분 후에
리허설 들어갑니다

2147
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:36,524
10 minutes to rehearsals!

2148
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:38,617
준비 빨리빨리 해주시구요

2149
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:38,617
Places everyone!

2150
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:41,763
이피디~

2151
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:41,763
Hey, Lee!

2152
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:43,060
예?

2153
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:43,060
Yeah?

2154
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:46,062
취소 시킨 거 취소

2155
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:46,062
Cancel on the cancel.

2156
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:06,920
수고하셨구요

2157
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:06,920
Thank you.

01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:09,890
Take center stage.

2162

조명 다 꺼주시고요

2163
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:11,583

2287
01:35:41,502 --> 01:35:45,106

You said he died.

01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:13,894
You can't fight
inside a police station!

2338
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:13,894
경찰서에서 이렇게
싸우고 그러면 어떡해요?

2339
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:15,663
- 뭐~? 아이고 죄송합니다
- 아 예 예

2340
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:15,663
- Sorry.
- Right.

2341
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:18,232
- 일루와 이 새끼야 너. 내가 임마
- 아니 저 살살 하시라구요~

2342
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:18,232
- Come here you!
- Not so rough!

2343
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:19,533
경찰서에서 이러시면 안 된다고요
아니 그러니까 경찰서에서...

2344
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:19,533
You're in a police station!

2345
01:37:19,533 --> 01:37:21,660
아빠가 살아 있었잖아!
이 새끼야~

2346
01:37:19,533 --> 01:37:21,660
The father was alive!

2347
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:24,327
내가 이 나이에!

2348
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:24,327
Calm down, sir!

2349
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:28,475

저 조금 있다 때리시구요

2350
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:28,475
Wait! Hit him later!

01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,842
에?

2354
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,842
Yes?

2355
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:35,274

01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:44,055
아빠네 할아버지네
둘째 아들 삼촌?

2360
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:44,055
His dad's grandpa's
second son's son?

2361
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:45,292

How did you...

2363
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:48,162
아니 그럼
혹시 여기 황제인씨 계세요?

2364
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:49,663
ls Jae-in or
Jung-nam Hwang here?

2365
01:37:48,162 --> 01:37:49,663
황정남이기도 하고...

2366
01:37:49,663 --> 01:37:50,865
네?

2367
01:37:49,663 --> 01:37:50,865
Yes?

2368
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:55,996
아, 그러니까 그러면 황기동의
큰 삼촌 딸 누나?

2369
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:55,996
Ki-dong's uncle's daughter?

2370
01:37:58,839 --> 01:38:03,310
아이 참나... 내가 이 경찰 질
뭐 오래한 건 아난데

2371
01:37:58,839 --> 01:38:05,972
ln all my years as a cop,
this is really something.

2372
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:05,972
참 나~ 이런 경운
또 처음 봤네...

2373
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:11,880
그 황기동 어란이가 울면서
두 분 그 112에다 실종신고 했어요

2374
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:11,880
Ki-dong called 91 1 and
reported you two missing.

2375
01:38:12,219 --> 01:38:14,653
새벽까지 기다려도
안 온다고

2376
01:38:12,219 --> 01:38:14,653
He's waiting for you at home.

2377
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:18,649
봉기자간 누구 피해서
갔대던데...

2378
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:18,649
He says he ran from
some reporter named Bong?

2379
01:38:27,501 --> 01:38:28,832
기동아!

2380
01:38:27,501 --> 01:38:28,832
Ki-dong!

2381
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:37,478
야! 너 이 놈 새끼야
너 임마 어디 갔다 왔...

2382
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:37,478
Where were you!

2383
01:38:37,478 --> 01:38:39,246
애는 왜 때려...

2384
01:38:37,478 --> 01:38:39,246
Stop hitting him!

2385
01:38:39,246 --> 01:38:42,483
야 이... 이 새끼야
가면 간다고 얘기를 해야 될 거 아냐

2386
01:38:39,246 --> 01:38:42,483
You should've told us
where you were going!

2387
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:44,885
하여튼 말은 드럽게 안 들어
이 놈의 새끼

2388
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:44,885
You never listen, do you!

2389
01:38:44,885 --> 01:38:46,978
왜 자꾸 때리냐구!

2390
01:38:44,885 --> 01:38:46,978
Stop it!

2391
01:38:47,521 --> 01:38:48,656
Hyun-soo Nam's secret daughter
and grandson exposed!

2392
01:38:48,656 --> 01:38:52,114
네, 그럼 남현수씨 기자회견
시작하도록 하겠습니다

2393
01:38:48,656 --> 01:38:50,357
Hyun-soo Nam's secret daughter
and grandson exposed!
The press conference
will now begin.

2394
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:52,154
The press conference
will now begin.

2395
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:25,615
어릴 적...
사랑한 여인이 있었습니다

2396
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:25,615
When l was young,
l fell in love with a woman.

2397
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:31,227
처음 느끼는
사랑이라는 감정에

2398
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:36,062
My first love.
l lost my heart completely to her.

2399
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:36,060
저의 마음조차 갈피를
잡지 못 할 만큼

2400
01:39:38,339 --> 01:39:39,473
사랑했...

2401
01:39:38,339 --> 01:39:39,473
l loved her...

2402
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:40,633
김준영이다!

2403
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:40,633
lt's Joon-young Kim!

2404
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:44,975
책...책임과...

2405
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:44,975
But l was too young...

2406
01:39:46,246 --> 01:39:48,737
의무까지 알지 못...

2407
01:39:46,246 --> 01:39:48,737
to take responsibility.

2408
01:39:52,519 --> 01:39:56,546
빨랑 하세요 마저. 네?
아이씨...

2409
01:39:52,519 --> 01:39:56,546
Hurry it up, will you?

2410
01:40:02,196 --> 01:40:04,264
잠적 중이었던
영화배우 김준영씨는

2411
01:40:02,196 --> 01:40:04,264
Actor Joon-young Kim came out

2412
01:40:04,264 --> 01:40:06,900
자신의 비디오 사건을
폭로한 모일간지 기자

2413
01:40:04,264 --> 01:40:08,635
to face the reporter
who exposed him.

2414
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,635
봉모 씨를 대면하자

2415
01:40:08,635 --> 01:40:11,705
그 자리에서 폭행하는
사건까지 저질렀는데요

2416
01:40:08,635 --> 01:40:11,705
He violently attacked
the reporter.

2417
01:40:11,705 --> 01:40:14,541
김준영씨는 그간 불면증에
시달리고 있었으며

2418
01:40:11,705 --> 01:40:20,114
Doctors claim Kim has been
suffering from insomnia.

2419
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:17,177
정신이 몽롱한 상태에서
무작정 찾아가...

2420
01:40:17,177 --> 01:40:20,114
봉기자를 대면하는 순간
그만 이성을 잃고 우발적으로 폭행을...

2421
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:21,181
왜?

2422
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:21,181
What?

2423
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:23,911
내가 별로 너
인기 없다 그랬지?

2424
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:23,911
l told you you're not popular.

2425
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:27,983
봉모 기자는 코뼈가 부러지고
두개골에 금이가는

2426
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:27,983
Bong suffered severe injuries
and will be hospitalized...

2427
01:40:28,822 --> 01:40:31,017
왜? 네

2428
01:40:28,822 --> 01:40:31,017
What! Yes?

2429
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:38,588
숨기려고 할 의도는...
있었습니다

2430
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:38,588
l lied from the beginning.

2431
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:43,700
입술이 열 개라도
할 말이 없네요. 죄송합니다

2432
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:43,700
l don't know what to say.
l'm sorry.

2433
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:46,366
할아버지

2434
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:46,366
You're a grandpa?

2435
01:40:48,842 --> 01:40:51,936
우리가 연애하던 사이가
아니었던것 가은데

2436
01:40:48,842 --> 01:40:51,936
We weren't dating at the time.

2437
01:40:53,113 --> 01:40:55,308
그런 사이는 아니었죠...

2438
01:40:53,113 --> 01:40:55,308
Ah, right you are.

2439
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:58,543
그럼 이렇게 미안해
안하셔도 되는건데

2440
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:58,543
So you don't have to be sorry.

2441
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:02,516
뭐... 그런거죠. 네

2442
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:02,516
Well, l guess.

2443
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:09,559
근데 혹시 우리가
사귀게 되면

2444
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:09,559
But if we do start dating...

2445
01:41:10,431 --> 01:41:12,661
제가 할머니가 되는거죠?

2446
01:41:10,431 --> 01:41:12,661
Ki-dong will call me, grandma?

2447
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:22,201
근데 연예인이 그렇게
인기가 없어서 어떡해요?

2448
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:22,201
lt must be sad being
an unpopular celebrity.

2449
01:41:24,144 --> 01:41:28,945
저기 컨셉을
아저씨로 잡아보는 게 어때요?

2450
01:41:24,144 --> 01:41:28,945
How about setting a new image
as the kind man next door?

2451
01:41:33,954 --> 01:41:36,957
그러니까 이걸
컨셉으로 잡잔 말이지?!

2452
01:41:33,954 --> 01:41:36,957
That's your new concept?

2453
01:41:36,957 --> 01:41:37,758
아저씨~

2454
01:41:36,957 --> 01:41:37,758
Uncle Nam?

2455
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:39,282
봐봐. 봐봐

2456
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:39,282
Listen.

2457
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:42,129
요새 니 이미지가 책임감

2458
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:45,462
You have a new image of
being a kind, responsible man.

2459
01:41:42,129 --> 01:41:45,462
뭐 책임지는 남자
이런 이미지가 생겼거든

2460
01:41:47,134 --> 01:41:48,601
너도 깨지?

2461
01:41:47,134 --> 01:41:48,601
Crazy, huh?

2462
01:41:49,736 --> 01:41:52,039
