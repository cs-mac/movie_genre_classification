00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,333
<i>For the last 12 years,</i>

2
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:52,137
<i>Biblical archaeologist Don Verdean</i>

3
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:54,038
<i>has received worldwide acclaim</i>

4
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,875
<i>for his incredible
discoveries in the Holy Land.</i>

5
00:00:56,876 --> 00:00:59,878
<i>Don's discoveries have touched the lives</i>

6
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,412
<i>of countless millions,</i>

7
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:04,348
<i>confirming their faith and
the miraculous narratives</i>

8
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,984
<i>found in the Bible.</i>

9
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,919
<i>On his latest trip
to the Middle East,</i>

10
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,023
<i>Don contacted Adabi
Hassan from Saudi Arabia,</i>

11
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:15,427
<i>who agreed to accompany
Don to a location</i>

12
00:01:15,428 --> 00:01:19,297
<i>rumored to be the burial site
of Samson from the Bible.</i>

13
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:21,767
<i>But, sadly, upon their arrival,</i>

14
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:25,202
<i>all that remained of the
site was a large, empty hole</i>

15
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:27,906
<i>caused by looting
the previous month.</i>

16
00:01:27,907 --> 00:01:29,541
<i>Don was devastated.</i>

17
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:32,344
<i>Adabi then informed him
of a lesser known location</i>

18
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:34,079
<i>in the valley of Sorek.</i>

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,547
<i>After months of intense excavation,</i>

20
00:01:36,548 --> 00:01:39,216
<i>Don made the discovery
of a lifetime...</i>

21
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:44,055
<i>iron shears dating
back over 3,000 years.</i>

22
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:46,023
<i>Could these be the very blades</i>

23
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:48,460
<i>used to strip Samson
of his strength?</i>

24
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:50,461
<i>Don decided to share his findings</i>

25
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:53,264
<i>with Dr. Stelios Patrokolis,</i>

26
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:56,934
<i>world-renowned for his excavations
of the Byzantine Empire.</i>

27
00:01:56,935 --> 00:02:00,305
<i>After reviewing the forensic data,</i>

28
00:02:00,306 --> 00:02:04,177
<i>Dr. Patrokolis made the
following statement:</i>

29
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,456
I'll bet.

30
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:21,526
<i>After this brief
interview with Dr. Patrokolis,</i>

31
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:24,563
<i>Don's discovery was made public.</i>

32
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:28,567
<i>He now travels the world
sharing his message of faith</i>

33
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:31,671
<i>to a whole new
generation of believers.</i>

34
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,973
<i>The tireless efforts of Don Verdean</i>

35
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:38,277
<i>will continue to bless
millions everywhere.</i>

36
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:47,720
Next question.

37
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:50,956
Yeah?

38
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:53,992
Mr. Verdean, there's a... a, uh, letter.

39
00:02:53,993 --> 00:02:56,260
Well, it's an online document

40
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,263
that's received wide distribution

41
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:00,998
throughout the ministry, as
I'm... I'm sure you've seen it.

42
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:03,301
It's, for the record, from the, uh,

43
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:05,302
Israeli Antiquities Authority.

44
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:07,906
I'd like to share that,
if that's all right.

45
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:10,442
<i>Yes, go right ahead.</i>

46
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:13,378
"Thank you for your inquiry dated July 13th

47
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,247
asking about Don Verdean.

48
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:18,415
We cannot confirm his finds

49
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,319
and have no information
about them whatsoever.

50
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
<i>If he says he has
excavated in Israel,</i>

51
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:26,157
<i>he has committed an illegal act.</i>

52
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:27,492
<i>We have never heard of this man,</i>

53
00:03:27,493 --> 00:03:29,628
<i>nor have we had any
dealings with him.</i>

54
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:32,264
Legitimate archaeology finds

55
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:35,033
are published in professional journals

56
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:39,403
or by universities and
other scientific institutes.

57
00:03:39,404 --> 00:03:42,307
Sincerely yours, Nahum Ishalom,

58
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:45,245
spokesman for Israeli Antiquities."

59
00:03:46,678 --> 00:03:49,181
<i>Thank you. Thank
you for reading that.</i>

60
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:54,920
Now, uh,

61
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:58,622
Satan takes advantage
of situations like this.

62
00:03:58,623 --> 00:04:00,992
There's two things happening here.

63
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:04,628
One, the Israelis don't
want this discovery confirmed

64
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:06,497
until, you know,

65
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:09,934
it can be done in a manner
that won't cause a bloodbath.

66
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:13,237
Two, all of my excavating was done

67
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:16,074
in a very public place,

68
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:18,375
and had I done it without a permit,

69
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:22,213
I can assure you I would've
been thrown in prison.

70
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:27,084
<i>Unfortunately, this is how
the Israelis handle things.</i>

71
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:29,321
If you ask any of them

72
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:33,226
if they know Don Verdean,
they'll say they don't.

73
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:36,360
Carol, did you, uh...

74
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:37,995
bring that book with you?

75
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:40,732
The one with my ugly face on the front?

76
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,435
Could you hand it to me?

77
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:45,838
Thank you.

78
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:50,607
Now...

79
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:53,745
if you'll all be so kind
as to look right here.

80
00:04:53,746 --> 00:04:57,482
In this picture, you will
see myself and another man.

81
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,651
This gentleman standing next to me

82
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:02,653
is none other than Nahum Ishalom,

83
00:05:02,654 --> 00:05:05,357
spokesman for the Israeli Antiquities

84
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:09,229
and author of the letter
that was just read to you.

85
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:15,266
When asked if he knew
Don Verdean, he said "no."

86
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,002
But if you look at this picture,

87
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:19,271
you'll see that the
truth is something else.

88
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,615
Thank you so much.

89
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:37,557
<i>-  You may ask me how I know </i>
- <i>You bet. Let's take a picture.</i>

90
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:41,793
<i>My Lord is real... </i>

91
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:43,694
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

92
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:46,264
<i> My Lord is real... </i>

93
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:48,199
<i>Let me make one thing clear.</i>

94
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,136
<i>These things are God's
things, not my things.</i>

95
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:53,737
He is allowed me to find these treasures

96
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:55,639
because I am simple man.

97
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,608
<i>It's very obvious that
I have never found</i>

98
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:00,578
anything based on my own intellect.

99
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:03,447
Nobody on Earth is...
is clever enough to...

100
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:06,083
...find these
things of their own volition.

101
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:07,352
- <i>That's right.</i>
- You know.

102
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:09,586
I work with Tony Lazarus,

103
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:12,757
and we'd love to set up a meeting
with Mr. Verdean, if we could.

104
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:17,161
<i> I can feel His hand in mine </i>

105
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:22,367
<i> And that's enough for me. </i>

106
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:27,538
How'd we do tonight?

107
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,141
Oh, everyone just loved
your presentation, Don,

108
00:06:30,142 --> 00:06:32,576
but we only sold about 10 copies.

109
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:35,780
Well, long as kept a few
sheep from goin' astray,

110
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:38,115
can't ask for much more than that.

111
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:40,552
What's the rest of our week lookin' like?

112
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:42,586
Well, the Friday lecture group

113
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:44,822
for the Bible study class just cancelled.

114
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:48,425
Well, that's unfortunate.

115
00:06:48,426 --> 00:06:50,295
But I did get a request from a place called

116
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:52,696
The Lazarus Fellowship Center.

117
00:06:52,697 --> 00:06:56,401
<i>Apparently, their pastor's just
dyin' to meet with you tomorrow.</i>

118
00:06:56,402 --> 00:07:00,170
Wait... wait a second, are
you talkin' about Tony Lazarus?

119
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,439
Yes. Should I know who that is?

120
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,809
Well, Tony died in a
car accident 10 years ago

121
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,245
while drivin' to Wendover with a hooker.

122
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:10,381
<i>The spirit left his
body and everything,</i>

123
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,550
but the good Lord decided
to give him a second chance

124
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:15,386
and send him back to Earth
as a modern day Lazarus.

125
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:17,588
Incredible.

126
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,189
Tony married the hooker and they started

127
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,824
their own ministry together.

128
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:22,494
Wow.

129
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:25,262
Tony Lazarus.

130
00:07:25,263 --> 00:07:26,797
What time's he want to see me tomorrow?

131
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:29,333
First thing in the morning.

132
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:34,540
<i>Praised be the
Lord, there he is.</i>

133
00:07:36,308 --> 00:07:37,675
Whoo!

134
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:41,278
Oh, well...

135
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:44,848
It is such a pleasure to see you.

136
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:47,352
And an absolute honor to finally meet ya.

137
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:49,586
I've been followin' your work for
years. I feel like I already know ya.

138
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:51,756
Well, it's a real pleasure to be here.

139
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:53,824
I-I-I tell
you what, I...

140
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:55,826
Well, this is my beautiful wife, Joylinda.

141
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:58,429
- Oh.
- I've seen the pictures.

142
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,398
Lovely to meet you.

143
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,800
I bet these hands have touched all kinds

144
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:04,602
- of sacred relics.
- Yes, ma'am.

145
00:08:04,603 --> 00:08:06,437
Just a few.

146
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:08,239
And who's your wonderful companion?

147
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,706
Who? Oh, yes! I'm sorry.

148
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,942
This is my car... uh,
secretary. Carol Jensen.

149
00:08:11,943 --> 00:08:13,877
- Carol? Oh, that's a lovely name.
- Yes.

150
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:15,547
- Thank you.
- We're just so happy you two could be here.

151
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:17,482
Please, please, y'all, come have a seat.

152
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:19,550
We're so grateful you're
here. We have much to discuss.

153
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:22,220
- Come take a seat.
- Whoo!

154
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:24,355
I feel it!

155
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:26,423
Well, Don, it should be no surprise to you

156
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:27,958
that we are all big fans.

157
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,660
I mean, perhaps your biggest fans.

158
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:31,829
We've seen all the DVDs,
read all your books.

159
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,532
There is no one in the
world that does what you do.

160
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:37,936
Well, thank you, Tony.
I've been very fortunate.

161
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:39,870
<i>Well, God knows
what He's doin'.</i>

162
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:41,940
Don, if you would bear with
me, I'm just gonna go ahead

163
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:44,209
and cut to the chase and tell
you why I brought you here.

164
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,544
<i>As I'm sure you're aware,
church attendance in America</i>

165
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:50,280
has been on a massive
decline in recent years.

166
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:54,219
And I've felt the effects of that
right here in my very own congregation.

167
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,520
Slowly but surely, this
nation is becommin' godless,

168
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:58,255
and it's frightening.

169
00:08:58,256 --> 00:08:59,923
<i>I mean, not to mention the
fact that there is a...</i>

170
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:02,594
a new church that has sprung
up mere blocks from here.

171
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:05,763
The pastor there has been
siphonin' my flock for months now.

172
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:07,966
You know, he's a former
Satanist turned Christian.

173
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:10,368
<i>Oh, people are really
taken by his story.</i>

174
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:13,403
Oh, yes, but I fear he's
leadin' them down the wrong path.

175
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:14,839
You see,

176
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,408
he holds them with...
with a fear of the occult.

177
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:18,576
That's how he keeps his numbers up,

178
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:20,611
and that is not a good foundation.

179
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:22,980
And right now, Don, people need
a good foundation more than ever.

180
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:24,682
You got that right.

181
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:27,317
False prophets aside,
there are some evil factions

182
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:29,019
"withinside" the scientific community

183
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,655
that are dead-set upon
destroyin' the truth.

184
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:33,825
You know, the other day I
was walkin' down the street

185
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:35,793
and this man told me... he said,

186
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:38,997
"Did you know that we have
evolved from protozoas?"

187
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:41,466
Do you know what a protozoa is?

188
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:42,899
No, I do not.

189
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,302
It's a God dong sea monkey.

190
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:47,938
- Say what?
- Can you imagine that?

191
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:49,673
Lookin' around at the loved ones...

192
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:52,409
at your mother, at your
father, at your beautiful wife,

193
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,345
and sayin', "You're a sea monkey.

194
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:56,748
You belong on the bookshelf of a child

195
00:09:56,749 --> 00:09:58,483
<i>that's going to neglect you</i>

196
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:00,817
and watch you swim around for a few days

197
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:03,020
and then end up falling to the bottom

198
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:05,556
of the sea monkey aquarium
and turning into dust."

199
00:10:05,557 --> 00:10:07,557
Holy Ghost power. That's awful.

200
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:10,360
Did you evolve from that, Don?

201
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,562
Now, you see, these
younger generations, Don,

202
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:14,532
they need proof. Okay?

203
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,967
They need hard evidence
in these dark, dark, times.

204
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:19,970
And I believe that the
Lord has been preparing you.

205
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:22,307
<i>The Lord wants you to be His...</i>

206
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,775
<i>His instrument in this great work.</i>

207
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:26,844
Now, what I'm proposing, Don,

208
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:28,845
is that you allow us

209
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:31,648
to participate with you in this great work

210
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:33,784
by letting us bankroll

211
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:36,520
all your future digs and projects.

212
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:41,658
I honestly don't know what to say.

213
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,727
Any artifact you would find, you would...

214
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:46,331
you would bring it here and we'd
present it to our congregation.

215
00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:50,435
And we'd put it on display for
the whole world to see His truth.

216
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:54,071
It'd be like a little museum of
sorts here at the Lazarus Fellowship.

217
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:55,740
<i>It would
be like a Holy Land</i>

218
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:57,774
<i>set in the good ol', U.S. of A.</i>

219
00:10:57,775 --> 00:11:01,747
Right here, where it
should be. Not over there.

220
00:11:03,716 --> 00:11:05,817
Well, Tony, I think it's very clear to me

221
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:08,019
that the hand of... Providence

222
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,955
has... brought us to this juncture.

223
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:13,691
I-I think it's fair to say this
might be a match made in heaven.

224
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:15,960
<i>Oh, I was hopin'
you were gonna say that.</i>

225
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:18,929
Don, we have been prayin'
so long and hard for this,

226
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,633
and we would love nothin' more than
to begin this adventure immediately.

227
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:24,969
Well, today's your lucky day.

228
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,903
I believe I have a solid lead

229
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:28,806
on the location of Lot's wife.

230
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:30,807
You gotta be kiddin' me.

231
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:40,985
<i>2 weeks ago my sources
inside Israel sent me this.</i>

232
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:43,388
Approximately three furlongs to the south

233
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:46,058
of where I discovered the sulfuric
remains of Sodom and Gomorrah.

234
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:52,663
This is incredible.

235
00:11:52,664 --> 00:11:55,399
Have the Israelis tested
this for salt content?

236
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,068
The sample taken to the lab
indicated that this structure

237
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:01,405
was made up of 97% sodium chloride.

238
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:04,575
I was told that's the purest
salt they've ever tested.

239
00:12:07,612 --> 00:12:09,315
I don't know what to say.

240
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:13,418
I mean, Don, you've
actually found Lot's wife.

241
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:18,956
It's all right, sweetheart.

242
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,128
When can we bring her here?

243
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:34,871
Hi, shalom, Boaz?

244
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:37,041
It's Don Verdean.

245
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:39,076
I can... I can barely hear you.

246
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:41,778
Boaz, it's Don Verdean

247
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,614
from America. How are ya?

248
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:46,750
<i>Shem, sheket. Sheket!</i>

249
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:48,852
Shalom
<i>from... can you hear me?</i>

250
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:50,821
No, tell the camel, "Shut up."

251
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:52,523
The camel keep talking.

252
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:55,592
Boaz, it's Don Verdean from America.

253
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:57,595
- How are ya?
- <i>Hello, Don.</i>

254
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:59,831
Ah, yes, it's me, Boaz.

255
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:01,798
Uh, what's up, man?

256
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,735
Well, uh, good news. You
remember that pillar of salt

257
00:13:04,736 --> 00:13:06,937
you and your brother found out
in the desert two weeks ago?

258
00:13:06,938 --> 00:13:09,874
Well, I need you to ship it to me.

259
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,009
I can wire you the money tonight.

260
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,111
- Oh, yeah, yeah, that thing.
- Yeah, about that.

261
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:17,682
That's not there anymore.

262
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:19,484
<i>Uh, I'm sorry, say that again?</i>

263
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:21,251
I said, "That is not there anymore."

264
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:23,553
What do you mean, "It's not there anymore"?

265
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,190
- Where'd it go?
- <i>Me and Shem were out there today,</i>

266
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:28,625
and we're looking and we're looking,

267
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:32,196
but, uh, we don't see her.

268
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:35,166
Well, are you sure you're
looking in the right place?

269
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,168
No?

270
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:39,736
- <i>Uh, say what?</i>
- Uh, maybe.

271
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,672
<i>Now come on, Boaz!</i>

272
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:43,807
I mean, this could be
the find of the century.

273
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:45,509
I mean, we're talkin'
about Lot's wife here.

274
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,177
<i>There are a lot of
rocks out there, Don.</i>

275
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:49,779
They all look the same. How
do I know which one is the one?

276
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,916
Well, it can't be that hard.

277
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:54,251
We need the one with breasts.

278
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:57,922
Oh, the breasts. Okay, that one.

279
00:13:57,923 --> 00:14:01,926
- Oh, yeah.
- There's one big white rock,

280
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:04,061
and it has breasts on it.

281
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:06,696
All right. Chill out, <i>sababa.</i>

282
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:08,666
- It's cool.
- <i>No, it's not cool!</i>

283
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,802
Okay? Get the Marines, get the Taliban,

284
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:14,839
get the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir, if you have to,

285
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,974
but find the pillar of salt!

286
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:18,909
Now, don't you be facetious, Don.

287
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,778
<i>Don't screw this up, Boaz.</i>

288
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,846
You get her on a plane tomorrow.

289
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:26,817
There are countless souls whose
very salvation is at stake here.

290
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:29,220
You do not want their blood on your hands.

291
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:31,821
- <i>Do you want to go to hell?</i>
- No.

292
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:34,091
- <i>Do you believe in hell?</i>
- I'm not sure,

293
00:14:34,092 --> 00:14:36,092
but I don't take chances.

294
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:38,095
<i>All right, well, I'll wire
you the money tonight.</i>

295
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:40,063
- <i>Hey, Don?</i>
- What?

296
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:42,299
<i>Catch you later, man.

297
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,001
All right, well, I'll catch you later, too.

298
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:47,005
All right. Goodbye, now.

299
00:14:47,838 --> 00:14:50,575
Good Lord, have mercy.

300
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,828
I brought you some supper.

301
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:11,861
You didn't have to do that.

302
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:15,666
It's just some pot stickers
and a raisin cookie.

303
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,735
Well, I don't care much for raisins,

304
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:20,303
<i>but thank you.</i>

305
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:24,174
Carol, how long you
been workin' for me now?

306
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:27,311
- Almost 8 months.
- <i>Wow.</i>

307
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:30,748
Time's really flown by.

308
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:32,783
<i>Well, after what's transpired today,</i>

309
00:15:32,784 --> 00:15:35,786
<i>I need you to cancel
the rest of the tour.</i>

310
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:37,388
But, more importantly, it doesn't look like

311
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:40,358
I'm gonna need anyone to
manage my schedule anymore.

312
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:44,361
Oh, uh, uh, okay.

313
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:46,096
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Well, um,

314
00:15:46,097 --> 00:15:48,365
I'm happy to stick around a few more days

315
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:50,033
to help you transition.

316
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:52,836
What? No. No, no, Carol,

317
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:56,072
you're not getting fired.
I-I-I want to promote you

318
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:59,210
<i>to research assistant
and field documentarian.</i>

319
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:02,113
Oh, Don, I would be honored!

320
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:06,951
Carol, I want to make one thing very clear.

321
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:09,820
Finding treasure in
the Earth is meaningless

322
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:11,788
unless it will help someone get to heaven

323
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:13,923
<i>that wouldn't get there otherwise.</i>

324
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:16,661
That's what I admire about you, Don.

325
00:16:16,662 --> 00:16:18,428
You're in this for all the right reasons.

326
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:22,001
Well...

327
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:25,671
- good night.
- <i>Night.</i>

328
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,510
Ah!

329
00:17:07,912 --> 00:17:11,148
Well, there she is. Lot's wife.

330
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:14,485
Don, don't get me wrong, I
mean, she obviously is beautiful,

331
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:17,254
but, uh, is it just me, or does she look

332
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:18,889
a little different than
she does in the, uh,

333
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,925
photograph the Israelis sent you?

334
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:24,462
<i>Well, Tony, I'm always
amazed at how certain artifacts</i>

335
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:27,732
have the ability to
completely re-write history.

336
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:30,133
<i>Based on the evidence
standing right here before us,</i>

337
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,369
I think it's very plausible that

338
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,440
Lot's wife was a hermaphrodite.

339
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:37,908
<i>I'm sure it was quite
common in those days.</i>

340
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:40,878
Limited gene pool,
incest, and what have you.

341
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:43,046
That would probably explain why Lot's wife

342
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:45,416
was so dead-set upon returning
to the Forbidden City.

343
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:47,418
<i>Bingo.</i>

344
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:49,152
My only fear is the, uh,

345
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,421
milk drinkers of my congregation.

346
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:54,625
Is this meat going to be
too much for them to swallow?

347
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,071
- Hello?
- Boaz, what in the hell did you send me?!

348
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:08,906
<i>What do you mean
what did we send you?</i>

349
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:11,508
We sent you Lot's wife. The
one with the two breasts.

350
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:13,276
Well, she also came

351
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:16,781
with a veritable fruit salad in her pants!

352
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:18,783
<i>Now, come on, Boaz!</i>

353
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:21,952
I just can't tolerate this
type of sloppy archaeology.

354
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:23,987
<i>Let me ask you this,</i>

355
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:27,457
which one of you screwed
up my pillar of salt?!

356
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,927
<i>Don, Don, this is the real
Lot's wife. I promise you.</i>

357
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:33,330
She was smuggled straight
out of the Holy Land.

358
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:36,065
<i>I know it's different from
the picture we sent you,</i>

359
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:39,069
<i>but this one matches the
description in the "Bibla."</i>

360
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,171
- What did you say?
- <i>You have to believe me</i>

361
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:43,006
<i>that this is really her, Don.</i>

362
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:45,208
This is Lot's wife.

363
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:48,478
<i>I'm telling you, Don.
I'd bet my life on it.</i>

364
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,380
<i>Now stop calling me about this.</i>

365
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:58,088
<i> Don't turn back </i>

366
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:02,325
 When your husband tells you not to 

367
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:06,030
 It's not a woman's lot in life 

368
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:10,234
 To give a single thought to 

369
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:13,102
 What her husband commands 

370
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:17,107
 Is what she ought to do 

371
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:19,209
 And don't turn 

372
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,112
 To a pillar of salt 

373
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:27,117
 Pillar of salt 

374
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:29,954
 It's all her fault 

375
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:32,255
 She should have listened 

376
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:37,227
 When her husband shouted "halt" 

377
00:19:37,228 --> 00:19:40,997
 Instead of Sodom and Gomorrah 

378
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:43,000
 She should have just stayed home 

379
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:45,168
 And read the Torah 

380
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:48,539
 Now she's a pillar 

381
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,176
 Of salt. 

382
00:19:57,082 --> 00:19:58,882
Wonderful.

383
00:20:03,153 --> 00:20:04,921
Wasn't that beautiful?

384
00:20:04,922 --> 00:20:07,492
Beautiful voice, beautiful message.

385
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:10,895
Brothers and sisters, I am humbled

386
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:13,330
by what I am going to share with you.

387
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:15,131
Just a few weeks ago,

388
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,901
an incredible discovery
was found in Israel.

389
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:20,471
<i>World renowned
archaeologist Don Verdean</i>

390
00:20:20,472 --> 00:20:22,907
<i>and his team of experts</i>

391
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:25,109
have uncovered what many scholars believe

392
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,444
to be the remains of Lot's wife,

393
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:31,447
as found in Genesis 19, verse 26.

394
00:20:31,448 --> 00:20:34,584
<i>"His wife looked
back from behind him</i>

395
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:37,187
<i>and she became a pillar of salt."</i>

396
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:41,024
Just when the world thought that
the windows of heaven were closed,

397
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:44,294
the Lord has granted us a miracle.

398
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:45,963
And an answer

399
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:49,099
to life's greatest mystery.

400
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,402
Who was this woman, and
why was she so dead-set

401
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:54,205
about returning to that hellhole?

402
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:56,940
<i>Without further ado,</i>

403
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:59,677
I present to you the
first of what I hope to be

404
00:20:59,678 --> 00:21:02,545
many archaeological discoveries

405
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:05,181
to prove that the Bible

406
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:06,951
is true.

407
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:37,949
Hallelujah.

408
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:40,618
<i>Praise the Lord.</i>

409
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:42,719
Whoo!

410
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,521
Blessed be.

411
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:57,033
Whoo.

412
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:03,540
<i>Thank you. Praise God.</i>

413
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,441
Congratulations, Tony.

414
00:22:05,442 --> 00:22:07,011
<i>Impressive turnout today.</i>

415
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:09,612
Looks like your ministry
is almost relevant again.

416
00:22:09,613 --> 00:22:12,282
Don, this is Dennis Fontaine.

417
00:22:12,283 --> 00:22:14,650
He's from the Friendship Harvest Temple.

418
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:17,888
- Ah, good to meet ya.
- <i>You know, a funny little piece of trivia</i>

419
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,556
- about Mr. Fontaine, he used to be a Satanist.
- Is that right?

420
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:22,626
Oh, yeah. He was a high priest.

421
00:22:22,627 --> 00:22:24,762
Participated in the orgies, the whole deal.

422
00:22:24,763 --> 00:22:27,630
Then one day he woke up and decided
he was playin' for the wrong team.

423
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:29,166
Decided to become a Christian.

424
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,467
Quite a discovery you've made here.

425
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:33,236
Where exactly was it located?

426
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:36,305
In the Valley of Sittim,
Southern tip of the Dead Sea.

427
00:22:36,306 --> 00:22:38,508
Ah, I'm sure it was.

428
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:40,310
My colleague Dr. Stanley here

429
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:42,646
teaches life sciences
at Sioux Valley Vo-Tech.

430
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:45,215
<i>He was wondering if he could
take a sample back to his lab</i>

431
00:22:45,216 --> 00:22:47,316
<i>for carbon dating purposes?</i>

432
00:22:47,317 --> 00:22:50,754
What makes you think you can carbon
date the wrath of the Almighty?

433
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:53,724
<i>Besides, anyone with a brain
knows that carbon dating</i>

434
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:57,194
<i>is completely ineffective when
dealing with mineralized fossil.</i>

435
00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:58,629
The isotopes are rendered useless.

436
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,229
Why don't you leave the science

437
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,398
to the scientists, Mr. Verdean?

438
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:05,202
Why don't you leave the things
of God in the hands of his people?

439
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:08,405
Just thought you boys might like some
forensic data to back up your claims.

440
00:23:08,406 --> 00:23:11,742
But I totally understand if
you're skittish about the results.

441
00:23:11,743 --> 00:23:14,610
I think you might be better off
gettin' some of your own lab work done,

442
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:18,081
<i>make sure your blood ain't loaded
with V.D. from your Satanic orgy days.</i>

443
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:19,582
Hey, you better watch yourself.

444
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:21,485
You better watch yourself.
Fontaine, get ahold of

445
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:24,254
"Planet of the Apes" here.

446
00:23:24,255 --> 00:23:27,523
You put this jackrabbit in a
corner, he's gonna find a way out.

447
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:29,293
Look, you can avoid the facts all you want,

448
00:23:29,294 --> 00:23:31,527
but sooner or later
people will want the truth.

449
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:33,731
Get ready for it.

450
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:40,637
Fontaine!

451
00:23:40,638 --> 00:23:42,738
I know you'd like to take a
sample back to your machine,

452
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:44,241
but you can find out what it's made of

453
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:46,110
right now with a good,
old-fashioned lick test.

454
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:56,386
What in the world was that?

455
00:23:56,387 --> 00:23:59,656
I believe that was some
sort of demonic hiss.

456
00:23:59,657 --> 00:24:02,661
Yo, Don, I'm not so sure that
was a wise move to challenge him.

457
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:13,603
<i>I don't think
you could have asked</i>

458
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:15,304
for a better reaction today.

459
00:24:15,305 --> 00:24:17,341
The look on everyone's
faces should be bottled up

460
00:24:17,342 --> 00:24:19,408
and sold as an anti-depressant.

461
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:20,978
Mm-hmm.

462
00:24:22,514 --> 00:24:25,482
Oh, that Joylinda's a real surprise.

463
00:24:25,483 --> 00:24:29,218
She and Tony are perfect for each other.

464
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,687
It's a shame they can't have any kids.

465
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:33,823
<i>You know, doctor's
say a woman her age...</i>

466
00:24:33,824 --> 00:24:36,459
she should have plenty of fresh eggs.

467
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,562
What in the world are you jabberin' about?

468
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:41,831
Oh, I'm sorry.

469
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:45,569
Seems like that pastor may
have shaken you up a bit.

470
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,571
I've had to deal with vipers
like him my whole life.

471
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,373
Nothin' but bottom-dwellers

472
00:24:50,374 --> 00:24:52,609
tryin' to destroy the work.

473
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,812
Oh, I know, but you just gotta
let it just roll right off you.

474
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:59,448
Well, now, Carol, you need to learn
your place in this partnership.

475
00:24:59,449 --> 00:25:02,518
<i>And right now I need
you to stay quiet</i>

476
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,222
when I think things through.

477
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,793
You know, in the
8 months that you've known me,

478
00:25:10,794 --> 00:25:13,397
you've never asked me one
thing about my personal life.

479
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:16,366
I-I-I assumed it was a
professional courtesy,

480
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:20,204
but now I realize you think of
me as a mindless subordinate.

481
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:22,206
Now, Carol, that's not true.

482
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:24,341
I just never thought
you had a personal life.

483
00:25:24,342 --> 00:25:27,311
Well, if you cared to ask...

484
00:25:27,312 --> 00:25:29,815
you'd learn that I have a son in prison.

485
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:35,552
Carol, I-I-I had no
idea you had a son.

486
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,626
<i>He was my youthful indiscretion.</i>

487
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:47,965
Sometimes I feel like that French
whore from "Les Miserables."

488
00:25:55,907 --> 00:25:58,075
I'm sorry to hear that.

489
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,745
How'd your son end up in prison?

490
00:26:01,746 --> 00:26:04,648
Well, he
said he was starting to become

491
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:07,850
a Forest Ranger, but he was
actually growing cannabis

492
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:10,419
in Zion National Park.

493
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,854
3 tons of it.

494
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:15,258
Good Lord be, that's some serious weed.

495
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:17,561
Yeah.

496
00:26:17,562 --> 00:26:19,862
Now he's servin' a 12-year sentence.

497
00:26:19,863 --> 00:26:23,000
<i>It's a heavy burden
for a single mother.</i>

498
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:28,905
All I've ever wished for that
boy is to have a father figure.

499
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:31,276
He just needed a dad.

500
00:26:33,878 --> 00:26:36,848
I can't believe you've
shouldered this all by yourself.

501
00:26:37,948 --> 00:26:39,750
My life's just been a train wreck.

502
00:26:41,052 --> 00:26:43,052
But ever since I started workin' for you,

503
00:26:43,053 --> 00:26:46,624
I feel like it's slowly
gettin' back on the right track.

504
00:26:51,996 --> 00:26:55,132
Carol, I want you to know
that I'm here for you.

505
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:58,368
I'm glad you shared that with me.

506
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:00,971
I-I know it can't be easy bein' the mother

507
00:27:00,972 --> 00:27:03,907
of a dope slinger, but know that God

508
00:27:03,908 --> 00:27:06,709
can heal even the worst of sinners.

509
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,414
He doesn't want anything
to do with that right now.

510
00:27:10,415 --> 00:27:13,684
Well, he'll come 'round.
We'll get that boy saved

511
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:16,018
if it's the last thing we do.

512
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:18,421
Now have a bite of your bacon.

513
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:24,761
Gotta have your protein.

514
00:27:24,762 --> 00:27:26,662
Praise God.

515
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,435
Donald, I'm gonna go ahead
and swing for the fences

516
00:27:31,436 --> 00:27:32,668
with this one, all right?

517
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:34,737
We're battin' 1,000, so why not?

518
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:37,040
Lot's wife has gone over like gangbusters,

519
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,708
and we cannot succumb to a sophomore slump.

520
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:40,476
We need to come correct.

521
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:43,080
<i>I think the very next
artifact we go after,</i>

522
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:46,084
Ark of the Covenant.

523
00:27:48,052 --> 00:27:50,353
Well, that's a great idea, Tony, but, uh,

524
00:27:50,354 --> 00:27:51,888
we already know where she is.

525
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:54,023
We do?

526
00:27:54,024 --> 00:27:56,959
- Where?
- <i>Ethiopia.</i>

527
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,527
It's rested there for hundreds of years

528
00:27:58,528 --> 00:28:00,897
at the church of Our
Lady Mary of Zion in Axum.

529
00:28:00,898 --> 00:28:04,501
It's watched over by a
single guardian monk 24/7.

530
00:28:04,502 --> 00:28:06,605
Does this monk know martial arts?

531
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:09,939
Tell me this, is there anything into

532
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,609
tryin' to strike up some sort of
friendship with this monk fella?

533
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,610
<i>Convince him to bring
the Ark over here?</i>

534
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,146
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

535
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:18,381
Years ago, I tried to make
small talk with the fellow

536
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:21,685
when he came up for air... not a good idea.

537
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:24,053
Besides, if anyone actually sees the Ark,

538
00:28:24,054 --> 00:28:25,821
they will implode.

539
00:28:25,822 --> 00:28:29,024
Whoo. Well, that sounds
like that would suck.

540
00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:30,894
Frankincense.

541
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:33,863
Penicillin.

542
00:28:33,864 --> 00:28:36,733
Sweetheart, those are wonderful
ideas, they really are,

543
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:39,535
<i>but, uh, we don't need
to waste Don's time</i>

544
00:28:39,536 --> 00:28:41,838
findin' penicillin, baby,

545
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,408
'cause we are... the
world has that already.

546
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:47,610
What about a scuba expedition
to the bottom of the Red Sea?

547
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:50,013
Search for the remains of Pharaoh's army?

548
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:52,849
Gold chariots, breastplates, and the like?

549
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,686
Well, the Red Sea's roughly
170,000 square miles of open water.

550
00:28:56,687 --> 00:28:58,821
I'm not sure I'd know where to begin.

551
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,623
Well, I'll tell you where to begin, Don.

552
00:29:00,624 --> 00:29:03,025
- Faith.
- You got me there.

553
00:29:03,026 --> 00:29:07,097
But dredging the ocean floor's an operation
that's way out of our budget range.

554
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:10,966
<i>I'd say our current resources are
best suited for land excavation.</i>

555
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:12,869
Don, this is hard.

556
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,772
Oh, this is tough. I
got a jumble of thoughts

557
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:17,440
just going on like there's a fog.

558
00:29:17,441 --> 00:29:19,877
Like Lucifer has farted inside my brain.

559
00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:22,712
<i>Well, what sort of, uh,</i>

560
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:24,553
artifacts do you think
will be more reasonable?

561
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:29,054
Well, there's one object
that's eluded me for years.

562
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:32,789
I'm goin' after...

563
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,193
the Goliath skull.

564
00:29:36,194 --> 00:29:37,862
<i>That is brilliant.</i>

565
00:29:38,662 --> 00:29:40,030
<i>Goliath's skull.</i>

566
00:29:40,031 --> 00:29:43,733
Don, I'm gonna get you some SkyMiles

567
00:29:43,734 --> 00:29:46,805
and we're gonna get you to Israel.

568
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,907
You know about the road to Jericho?

569
00:29:50,908 --> 00:29:53,109
- No, I don't.
- Well, it's a long story.

570
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,678
I don't want to get into it right
now, but the Valley of Kidron

571
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,849
and the Valley of Josaphat...
I'm stuck between left and right.

572
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:24,006
So, Carol, is this your first time

573
00:30:24,007 --> 00:30:26,210
in the Valley of Elah?

574
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:35,051
Okay, right now we're
standing in the very creek bed

575
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:38,522
where David collected his 5 stones.

576
00:30:38,523 --> 00:30:43,126
That means the Philistine army
would have camped over here

577
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:45,594
and the Israelites would have camped...

578
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,597
over there.

579
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:49,099
Yeah.

580
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,635
Yeah. Yeah.

581
00:30:51,636 --> 00:30:53,171
Yeah.

582
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:12,621
Military protocol of the day

583
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:14,323
would put David and Goliath somewhere

584
00:31:14,324 --> 00:31:16,860
right here in the middle.

585
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:19,094
To pinpoint a more exact location,

586
00:31:19,095 --> 00:31:20,696
you go stand over there, Boaz.

587
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:23,166
Let's see how this thing
would've played out.

588
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:29,841
You better not sling that rock at me, Don.

589
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:32,309
This will give us a general area

590
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,844
of where they might have buried the skull.

591
00:31:35,845 --> 00:31:40,617
<i>Hold that shovel above your
head so I have about six cubits.</i>

592
00:31:40,618 --> 00:31:43,753
Now, if I'm David, I'm
thinkin', "I've got to swing

593
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:46,590
this contraption as hard as I can.

594
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:49,258
I'm probably only gonna
get one chance at this."

595
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:51,761
<i>And then David begins to pray</i>

596
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:53,263
for a kill shot right between

597
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:56,733
the Philistine's eyes.

598
00:31:56,734 --> 00:31:58,200
<i>Carol!</i>

599
00:31:58,201 --> 00:32:00,270
Carol!

600
00:32:00,271 --> 00:32:02,171
Are you all right?

601
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:05,207
- You hit her in the uterus, Don.
- I am so sorry, Carol.

602
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:08,011
The sling just fell apart on me

603
00:32:08,012 --> 00:32:10,746
it's... it's... it's clearly
not a reliable weapon.

604
00:32:10,747 --> 00:32:12,849
- Can you breathe?
- Yeah.

605
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,586
Well, let's all gather
'round for a word of prayer.

606
00:32:16,387 --> 00:32:18,156
Okay.

607
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,660
Dear Lord, we are indeed grateful

608
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:26,096
that Carol's flesh was not harmed.

609
00:32:26,097 --> 00:32:27,897
Bless her with renewed vigor.

610
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:31,767
We pray, Lord, that when I throw
this river stone in the air,

611
00:32:31,768 --> 00:32:34,004
that it may land in the general area

612
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:36,171
of where we should begin to dig,

613
00:32:36,172 --> 00:32:39,208
that we might be able to locate the remains

614
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:40,944
of that heartless Philistine.

615
00:32:40,945 --> 00:32:44,482
Yay, even Goliath. Amen.

616
00:32:47,284 --> 00:32:49,319
All right, there she is.

617
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,155
Let's start diggin'.

618
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:09,673
"Remember, my child, I
never said it would be easy,

619
00:33:09,674 --> 00:33:11,142
I only said it would be worth it."

620
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,878
Our Lord and Savior said that.

621
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:16,879
I know you people don't
respect him as a deity,

622
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,815
so I figured you may have missed
one of his best one-liners.

623
00:33:24,988 --> 00:33:28,190
Hey! Hey!

624
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,327
Stay cool, I'll handle this.

625
00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:35,632
<i>Shabbat shalom.</i>

626
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:39,936
- Mazel tov. Mazel tov.
- He says it's illegal to dig here.

627
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:42,405
Why are you digging here?

628
00:33:42,406 --> 00:33:44,006
He said, "Shut your face, you."

629
00:33:44,007 --> 00:33:45,809
Hey!

630
00:33:47,178 --> 00:33:48,777
Well, I was told to pack a shovel

631
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,414
when touring these parts
in case of inclement bowels.

632
00:33:51,415 --> 00:33:52,881
No toilets anywhere.

633
00:33:55,419 --> 00:33:56,985
He says you can't come here

634
00:33:56,986 --> 00:33:59,188
to our country and bury your caca.

635
00:34:05,763 --> 00:34:07,429
You need a government permit to dig here.

636
00:34:12,436 --> 00:34:14,938
If we don't put it back, everybody to jail.

637
00:34:14,939 --> 00:34:16,371
Move!

638
00:34:16,372 --> 00:34:18,141
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

639
00:34:18,142 --> 00:34:21,411
There's no need for that.

640
00:34:21,412 --> 00:34:24,047
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

641
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:29,252
We will return everything
to exactly the way it was

642
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:30,920
and be on our way.

643
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:34,290
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

644
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:36,995
<i>Thank you.</i>

645
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:06,322
- This is Don.
- <i>Don, it's Tony. How are ya?</i>

646
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:09,192
I'm good, Tony, I'm really... I'm good.

647
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:11,995
How's everything goin' there? I just
really wanted to check up on your progress.

648
00:35:11,996 --> 00:35:13,797
You know, people are
chompin' at the bit here

649
00:35:13,798 --> 00:35:15,197
to see the head of that Philistine.

650
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:17,967
Well, Tony, I...

651
00:35:17,968 --> 00:35:21,170
- we're gettin' close.
- Yeah, you think you'll be able

652
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:22,806
to wrap it up there in the next day or two?

653
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:24,809
I know your return trip is on Friday.

654
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,480
Praise God, I think there's an 80% chance.

655
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:33,982
Those odds have me a little worried, Don.

656
00:35:33,983 --> 00:35:36,819
Well, we've already
located the burial site.

657
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,054
At this point, it's
just a matter of digging.

658
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:41,123
Hmm. Okay.

659
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:43,192
Well, I gotta be honest with you, Don,

660
00:35:43,193 --> 00:35:44,927
we need that skull.

661
00:35:44,928 --> 00:35:48,431
<i>The fate of thousands
of people's very souls</i>

662
00:35:48,432 --> 00:35:51,100
- <i>are in the balance here.</i>
- I understand that.

663
00:35:51,101 --> 00:35:53,837
<i>I mean, their fate is... is
barely hangin' on by a thread.</i>

664
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:55,337
If they do not have this second witness,

665
00:35:55,338 --> 00:35:57,005
we could lose these people forever.

666
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:58,810
Can you imagine that?

667
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,110
I promise you, I will not return

668
00:36:02,111 --> 00:36:05,181
until I have Goliath's head in my carryon.

669
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:07,951
All right. Well, I never doubted you, Don.

670
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:09,853
Why don't you go ahead
and get some shut eye?

671
00:36:09,854 --> 00:36:12,054
I'm sure it's pretty late
over there in the Holy Land.

672
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:13,922
Will do, Tony. Thank you.

673
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:15,324
<i>God speed. Good night to you.</i>

674
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:13,551
Come on, now.

675
00:37:19,356 --> 00:37:21,826
Please don't be cremated.

676
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:21,984
Dear Lord, please forgive
me for what I'm about to do.

677
00:38:21,985 --> 00:38:25,989
And I know that someday
this man will be resurrected

678
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,257
and his members will be made whole again.

679
00:38:28,258 --> 00:38:32,362
Until that day comes,
I pray that his remains

680
00:38:32,363 --> 00:38:34,230
will be put to good use

681
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:37,400
and bring You many new souls unto Thee.

682
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:39,403
Amen.

683
00:40:24,207 --> 00:40:27,542
- Hello?
- <i>Carol, I need you to wake up.</i>

684
00:40:27,543 --> 00:40:29,479
I'm up.

685
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:33,516
<i>I was wrong about
our location yesterday.</i>

686
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:35,417
<i>They never would've
buried Goliath there.</i>

687
00:40:35,418 --> 00:40:36,886
<i>It's just too obvious.</i>

688
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:39,355
That police officer yesterday was God's way

689
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,757
of telling us that we
were on the wrong path.

690
00:40:41,758 --> 00:40:44,127
Well, where could it be, then?

691
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:47,464
Praise God, we'll find out.

692
00:40:55,305 --> 00:40:56,873
<i>What is this place?</i>

693
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,574
This is the ancient village of Gath.

694
00:40:58,575 --> 00:41:00,442
Goliath's birthplace.

695
00:41:00,443 --> 00:41:03,212
We all need to keep our eyes
peeled for any natural landmarks...

696
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:06,781
a... a monument of sorts.

697
00:41:06,782 --> 00:41:08,985
What about that monolith right there?

698
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,623
- What monolith?
- Right there.

699
00:41:16,325 --> 00:41:19,529
That's not a bad idea.

700
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,665
All right, boys, let's head over there.

701
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,368
Good thinkin' there, Carol.

702
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:27,904
You have really great ideas, Carol.

703
00:41:32,508 --> 00:41:34,576
All right, Carol, this is your call.

704
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:37,380
You take the lead on this one.

705
00:41:37,381 --> 00:41:39,714
Well, to me,

706
00:41:39,715 --> 00:41:41,417
this monolith represents

707
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:43,652
the physical strength of Goliath.

708
00:41:43,653 --> 00:41:45,955
So, it only makes sense
that they would've used

709
00:41:45,956 --> 00:41:48,723
something like this as a grave marker.

710
00:41:48,724 --> 00:41:50,493
Dang, you're a natural.

711
00:41:50,494 --> 00:41:52,930
<i>Where should we start digging?</i>

712
00:41:54,865 --> 00:41:56,799
Right here.

713
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,601
All right, boys, you heard the lady.

714
00:41:58,602 --> 00:41:59,803
Let's get to it.

715
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:03,471
Everyone be careful. Most Philistine graves

716
00:42:03,472 --> 00:42:05,507
in this region are quite shallow.

717
00:42:05,508 --> 00:42:06,875
That being said, let's dig fast.

718
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:09,078
Don't want any looky-loos showin' up.

719
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:17,120
Don.

720
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:20,522
I hit something.

721
00:42:20,523 --> 00:42:22,357
Okay. Ho, ho, ho... everyone stop.

722
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:24,694
- Where is it?
- Right there.

723
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:32,603
Carol, can you hand me
that brush from my kit?

724
00:42:34,771 --> 00:42:38,074
- I can see a chunk of bone.
- Let's not get carried away.

725
00:42:44,347 --> 00:42:46,382
Ooh! Is that the dome of a skull?!

726
00:42:46,383 --> 00:42:48,650
Phew. Certainly appears that way.

727
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:50,888
Wow.

728
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:54,889
<i>Carol, would you do the honors?</i>

729
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,826
No, I'm afraid I'll break it. You do it.

730
00:42:56,827 --> 00:42:58,694
All right, next time.

731
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:00,498
Get that bag ready.

732
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,609
Oh, my God.

733
00:43:14,577 --> 00:43:16,679
I don't believe it. That's...

734
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,082
the skull of Goliath.

735
00:43:19,615 --> 00:43:22,784
Hey! Hey! T-these guys just
found the skull of Goliath!

736
00:43:22,785 --> 00:43:24,622
All right. Let's get out of here.

737
00:43:33,963 --> 00:43:35,964
<i>Can I come in, Don?</i>

738
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:38,268
<i>Sure. What can I do you for?</i>

739
00:43:42,372 --> 00:43:45,841
I was just thinking about the
incredible discovery we made today.

740
00:43:45,842 --> 00:43:48,710
Another big win for Christianity, huh?

741
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:50,446
Your people, too.

742
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:52,348
You should be proud of
yourself. <i>Shalom.</i>

743
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:54,949
<i>Your shovel made first contact.</i>

744
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,851
I guess you're right.

745
00:43:56,852 --> 00:44:00,556
<i>I just found it a
little strange that...</i>

746
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,424
we found the skull

747
00:44:02,425 --> 00:44:05,728
in the very first place we started digging.

748
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:08,998
<i>My brother and I both agree
that that ground felt very soft.</i>

749
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:12,734
Almost like somebody had already dug it up.

750
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:15,438
I'm sure you can guess where
I'm going with this, Don.

751
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:17,772
No, Boaz. Actually, I don't.

752
00:44:17,773 --> 00:44:21,743
Oh, don't you? It just seemed a
bit convenient, don't you think?

753
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:25,413
What we experienced today is
nothing short of a miracle.

754
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:28,083
Don't ever forget that.
God has always said,

755
00:44:28,084 --> 00:44:30,719
<i>"My ways are not your ways."</i>

756
00:44:34,523 --> 00:44:36,692
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
- What the hell?

757
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:38,761
- Hey, hey, hey. Mind your business.
- What is wrong with you?!

758
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:40,763
You sick, sick man, Don.

759
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:43,866
Easy, now, Boaz. Let's... let's
talk about this, all right?

760
00:44:43,867 --> 00:44:45,368
No, there's nothing to talk about.

761
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:46,935
You're a grave robbing creep!

762
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:50,538
<i>Dismembering the head
of Johnny Jerusalem?!</i>

763
00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:52,708
Johnny Jerusalem is a hero here!

764
00:44:52,709 --> 00:44:55,411
Listen to me now, Boaz!

765
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:57,380
I was always gonna put him back.

766
00:44:57,381 --> 00:44:59,047
Give him the proper hero's burial,

767
00:44:59,048 --> 00:45:02,384
but you need to understand
why I had to do this.

768
00:45:02,385 --> 00:45:05,554
<i>I-I-I'm doin' it for
the good of everyone.</i>

769
00:45:05,555 --> 00:45:08,591
I should report you to
the authorities right now.

770
00:45:08,592 --> 00:45:10,926
Let's not be rash here.

771
00:45:10,927 --> 00:45:14,163
I'm sure there's somethin'
we can work out between us.

772
00:45:14,164 --> 00:45:15,797
You trying to bribe me, Don?

773
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:18,167
<i>I don't want your filthy</i> luka.

774
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:20,703
Well, wh... what do you want?

775
00:45:22,572 --> 00:45:24,540
I want to come to the States.

776
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:27,842
<i>I want to live the
American Dream for a while.</i>

777
00:45:27,843 --> 00:45:31,114
And get a Pontiac.

778
00:45:32,448 --> 00:45:34,817
And I want the Levi's jeans,

779
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:37,819
acid wash, super taper.

780
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,889
<i>Like John Stamos.</i>

781
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:44,592
I want a wife, Don. I'm lonely here.

782
00:45:44,593 --> 00:45:47,830
<i>She has to be gentle</i>

783
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:52,667
and sweet and hot like stripper.

784
00:45:52,668 --> 00:45:55,438
Well, that can be arranged.

785
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:56,971
But on one condition, now.

786
00:45:56,972 --> 00:45:59,507
<i>I need you to bear
witness to the skull.</i>

787
00:45:59,508 --> 00:46:02,645
You're gonna have to be
a part of this for a bit.

788
00:46:02,646 --> 00:46:04,513
Maybe even share how the experience

789
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:06,748
has caused you to consider Christianity,

790
00:46:06,749 --> 00:46:09,585
<i>but you're still on the
fence about the whole ordeal.</i>

791
00:46:09,586 --> 00:46:13,656
Christians love hearin' that
thing from a real-live Jew.

792
00:46:13,657 --> 00:46:17,227
<i>What do you say? Do we have a deal?</i>

793
00:46:22,499 --> 00:46:25,835
You better start lining up
some hot chicks for me, Don.

794
00:46:26,769 --> 00:46:28,705
<i>Amen.</i>

795
00:46:48,124 --> 00:46:50,759
<i>Hey, t-these guys
just found the skull of Goliath!</i>

796
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,261
Let's get out of here.

797
00:46:52,262 --> 00:46:54,496
One of those tourists
uploaded it this morning.

798
00:46:54,497 --> 00:46:56,531
It already has over 1,000 views.

799
00:46:56,532 --> 00:46:58,766
Let's hope the authorities don't
see it before we're airborne.

800
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:00,636
Put that away.

801
00:47:00,637 --> 00:47:03,638
They got a lot of undercovers
on these Jew planes.

802
00:47:06,108 --> 00:47:07,942
Stick it below the seat in front of ya.

803
00:47:07,943 --> 00:47:10,012
Sorry, Carol.

804
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:13,882
Keep a close eye on it. Be gentle, now.

805
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:21,959
I think it's broken.

806
00:47:25,227 --> 00:47:28,864
If Satan can get in there and get
you to start your day off wrong,

807
00:47:28,865 --> 00:47:31,065
he's gonna do it. Trust me.

808
00:47:31,066 --> 00:47:33,801
And he's gonna do it
through breakfast cereal.

809
00:47:33,802 --> 00:47:35,804
Kay?

810
00:47:35,805 --> 00:47:38,841
<i>Listen to some of the deviant
names of these cereals.</i>

811
00:47:38,842 --> 00:47:42,076
Grape-Nuts.

812
00:47:42,077 --> 00:47:44,078
Grape-Nuts!

813
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,315
Nice try, Satan.

814
00:47:46,316 --> 00:47:49,618
Nuts, testicles.

815
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,987
Come on. Don't get that image
in my head in the morning.

816
00:47:52,988 --> 00:47:55,991
Banana Nut Crunch.

817
00:47:55,992 --> 00:47:58,594
Yeah, we know what the nuts
are, we've established that.

818
00:47:58,595 --> 00:48:00,763
Bananas?

819
00:48:00,764 --> 00:48:02,864
We know what that is.

820
00:48:02,865 --> 00:48:04,433
It's a penis.

821
00:48:05,936 --> 00:48:08,002
Well, I'm here to tell you
that each and every time

822
00:48:08,003 --> 00:48:10,572
you spoon into a bowl of Lucky Charms,

823
00:48:10,573 --> 00:48:14,909
you might as well be partaking
of Lucifer's sacrament.

824
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:17,279
<i>I mean, come on!</i>

825
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,150
Turn it around! Let's get God cereal in ya!

826
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:23,985
Start the day off with a
little God in your life.

827
00:48:23,986 --> 00:48:25,888
You know what I eat?

828
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:28,022
I eat Life.

829
00:48:28,023 --> 00:48:30,359
I eat Raisin Bran.

830
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,995
I eat Special K.

831
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,996
Right? Special K.

832
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:37,098
Come... come
right now. It's on TV.

833
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:39,000
Oh. Brothers and sisters,

834
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:41,404
let's all take a 15-minute recess.

835
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:49,145
Fontaine, I'm tellin' you, you
could really be screwed here, man.

836
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:55,917
Ladies and
gentlemen, members of the press,

837
00:48:55,918 --> 00:48:57,920
<i>at this time, I would
like to introduce to you</i>

838
00:48:57,921 --> 00:49:00,121
<i>the people sitting here to my left.</i>

839
00:49:00,122 --> 00:49:03,625
First we have Boaz Yohalem,

840
00:49:03,626 --> 00:49:06,194
field supervisor and Israeli national.

841
00:49:06,195 --> 00:49:07,962
<i>Next to him Carol Jensen,</i>

842
00:49:07,963 --> 00:49:09,964
<i>chief research assistant.</i>

843
00:49:09,965 --> 00:49:11,833
And, finally,

844
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:14,402
world-famous archaeologist,
Donald Verdean.

845
00:49:14,403 --> 00:49:18,107
<i>Mr. Verdean is also
the president and CEO</i>

846
00:49:18,108 --> 00:49:22,076
of BibleQuest Enterprises,
headquartered in Duchesne, Utah.

847
00:49:22,077 --> 00:49:24,313
Now, at this time, I'd
like to hand the floor over

848
00:49:24,314 --> 00:49:26,348
to Mr. Verdean so he can share with you

849
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:28,884
<i>the evidence of his latest find.</i>

850
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:31,020
I'm gonna book you a massage right now.

851
00:49:33,023 --> 00:49:34,355
<i>Earlier this month</i>

852
00:49:34,356 --> 00:49:36,158
on a routine dig in Israel,

853
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:38,661
Miss Jensen, Mr. Yohalem

854
00:49:38,662 --> 00:49:40,395
and myself unearthed the remains

855
00:49:40,396 --> 00:49:42,964
of a very large human skull

856
00:49:42,965 --> 00:49:44,400
containing a river stone

857
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:47,402
embedded in the frontonasal suture.

858
00:49:47,403 --> 00:49:49,672
This discovery was made in Gath,

859
00:49:49,673 --> 00:49:52,341
the ancient birthplace of Goliath.

860
00:49:52,342 --> 00:49:55,677
And I'm gonna quit talkin' about it

861
00:49:55,678 --> 00:49:57,446
and let you be the judge.

862
00:50:03,787 --> 00:50:06,121
- <i>Mr. Verdean, how tall was he?</i>
- <i>Question. Question.</i>

863
00:50:06,122 --> 00:50:07,255
- <i>Over here.</i>
- <i>Question right here, Mr. Verdean.</i>

864
00:50:07,256 --> 00:50:08,723
I want you to find the home addresses

865
00:50:08,724 --> 00:50:11,125
of everyone involved in this broadcast.

866
00:50:11,126 --> 00:50:12,995
And I want you to go to their homes

867
00:50:12,996 --> 00:50:15,998
and put a dead dog in
each one of their cars.

868
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:18,000
<i>First
question, right over here.</i>

869
00:50:18,001 --> 00:50:19,400
How do you respond to critics

870
00:50:19,401 --> 00:50:22,237
who claim this is all a big hoax?

871
00:50:22,238 --> 00:50:23,739
Well, I invite critics everywhere

872
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,473
to take a good, hard look at the evidence

873
00:50:25,474 --> 00:50:28,143
<i>and, uh, make a decision.</i>

874
00:50:28,144 --> 00:50:31,746
Bone shavings from the skull
will soon be taken to the lab

875
00:50:31,747 --> 00:50:33,348
for radio carbon analysis.

876
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:36,719
So you see, it's all scientific.

877
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,786
Tell them the truth, Don.

878
00:50:41,423 --> 00:50:43,693
What?

879
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:48,065
I think you should really tell the truth.

880
00:50:52,434 --> 00:50:55,170
Tell them how we were chased

881
00:50:55,171 --> 00:50:58,940
by 3 al-Qaeda
guys on "motorcyc-les."

882
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:05,179
Oh, yeah, well, I-I tried
to forget about that.

883
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:09,352
- It was, uh...
- Will you please tell us about this run-in with al-Qaeda?

884
00:51:10,186 --> 00:51:11,386
Uh...

885
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:14,822
<i>well, yes, as you already know</i>

886
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:17,826
word of our discovery spread
quickly and not 10 minutes after

887
00:51:17,827 --> 00:51:19,460
<i>we were on the road with the skull,</i>

888
00:51:19,461 --> 00:51:23,464
we were followed by
3 masked men on motorcycles...

889
00:51:23,465 --> 00:51:25,199
<i>With AK-47s.</i>

890
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,502
<i>...with AK-47s. Uh...</i>

891
00:51:27,503 --> 00:51:29,505
I immediately took evasive action

892
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:31,773
and I knocked all 3
of them off the road.

893
00:51:31,774 --> 00:51:35,476
What al-Qaeda would want with the skull

894
00:51:35,477 --> 00:51:38,313
of a Philistine, I have no idea.

895
00:51:38,314 --> 00:51:40,348
They're possibly cloning

896
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:44,085
an army of giant al-Qaeda guys.

897
00:51:44,086 --> 00:51:46,087
Uh...

898
00:51:46,088 --> 00:51:48,290
What makes you think
they were from al-Qaeda?

899
00:51:49,793 --> 00:51:51,560
Well, I've received numerous death threats

900
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:54,228
since the incident that, uh...

901
00:51:54,229 --> 00:51:56,397
confirm they were indeed

902
00:51:56,398 --> 00:51:59,635
al-Qaeda operatives.

903
00:52:01,236 --> 00:52:04,172
Indeed they had... were
wearing those crazy hats.

904
00:52:04,173 --> 00:52:07,308
- Thank you, Dan.
- <i>Now, I tell ya, if I had my druthers,</i>

905
00:52:07,309 --> 00:52:09,812
<i>the very next thing
we'd be goin' after...</i>

906
00:52:09,813 --> 00:52:12,114
the wreckage of Noah's vessel.

907
00:52:12,115 --> 00:52:14,850
I'm not talkin' about the Ark, there
was this... an earlier prototype.

908
00:52:14,851 --> 00:52:16,518
It's more of a recreational vehicle.

909
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:20,054
I believe his boys wrecked
it across a rocky shore

910
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:21,522
when they were gallivanting one evening.

911
00:52:21,523 --> 00:52:23,391
If I can put that piece
of the puzzle together,

912
00:52:23,392 --> 00:52:26,527
I can finally close the door
on all this dinosaur nonsense,

913
00:52:26,528 --> 00:52:28,529
prove that that stuff never existed.

914
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:30,531
Just a hodgepodge of
different reptilian bones.

915
00:52:30,532 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm sure if you're
familiar with the old, uh,

916
00:52:33,001 --> 00:52:35,370
'80s cartoon "Vultron."

917
00:52:35,371 --> 00:52:37,105
Familiar with that? I believe they were

918
00:52:37,106 --> 00:52:38,507
crime-fighters of some nature.

919
00:52:38,508 --> 00:52:40,275
They all had their own machines,

920
00:52:40,276 --> 00:52:43,145
but together the machines
would form a giant machine.

921
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:46,080
And I do believe that that
is what we can discover.

922
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:47,616
That these bones, these relics,

923
00:52:47,617 --> 00:52:49,884
they're just like a little
Vultron of reptilians.

924
00:52:49,885 --> 00:52:53,955
It was all tiny ones kinda
fell together to form something

925
00:52:53,956 --> 00:52:55,758
that looks like a creature.

926
00:52:58,026 --> 00:53:02,063
- Have I lost ya?
- Appreciate you bein' here.

927
00:53:02,064 --> 00:53:03,531
Right.

928
00:53:03,532 --> 00:53:05,568
Well...

929
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,471
Hey, Carol. How you holdin' up?

930
00:53:10,472 --> 00:53:12,440
Boy, I'm sure you're not used to

931
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:13,875
this much limelight, though.

932
00:53:13,876 --> 00:53:15,576
You really glowed up there today.

933
00:53:15,577 --> 00:53:17,645
Stop it, Don.

934
00:53:17,646 --> 00:53:21,049
Did you plan that
publicity stunt with Boaz?

935
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,585
What? No, no, no.

936
00:53:23,586 --> 00:53:25,453
Because I would like to
be forewarned the next time

937
00:53:25,454 --> 00:53:28,491
you decide to lie to the
entire Christian nation.

938
00:53:32,327 --> 00:53:33,962
Carol, I-I'm... I'm sorry,

939
00:53:33,963 --> 00:53:36,931
but Boaz caught me totally off-guard.

940
00:53:36,932 --> 00:53:38,500
I-I-I didn't
know what to say,

941
00:53:38,501 --> 00:53:40,368
so I just rolled with it.

942
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:43,438
<i>But I sure as heck didn't
ask him to lie for me.</i>

943
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,574
Well, you know, in life I had to learn

944
00:53:46,575 --> 00:53:49,210
<i>that sometimes the small untruths</i>

945
00:53:49,211 --> 00:53:51,112
<i>are necessary for the greater good.</i>

946
00:53:51,113 --> 00:53:53,080
My sentiments exactly.

947
00:53:53,081 --> 00:53:55,951
But you know the second those
lies hurt the ones you love,

948
00:53:55,952 --> 00:53:58,321
the sin is on you.

949
00:54:03,258 --> 00:54:07,496
He also was in the Masad training
program for about three months.

950
00:54:07,497 --> 00:54:10,364
<i>Weapons training,
counter-intelligence,</i>

951
00:54:10,365 --> 00:54:12,366
making booby-traps,

952
00:54:12,367 --> 00:54:14,469
- kicking...
- Would you excuse us for just a moment?

953
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:15,703
I just want to talk

954
00:54:15,704 --> 00:54:18,005
to Dr. Yohalum for a second.

955
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:19,975
- I'm just talking to the lady about the...
- Yes. Yes.

956
00:54:19,976 --> 00:54:22,109
What in the Sam Hill were
you thinkin' in there?!

957
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,379
Al-Qaeda, Boaz?! Cloning?!

958
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,549
You don't know a damn heck thing
about the media, do you, Don?

959
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:30,518
I was saving you up
there! You were suffering.

960
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:34,121
Those people were bored, they were yawning.

961
00:54:34,122 --> 00:54:36,525
They couldn't give a rat's butthole

962
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:40,194
about your Goliath skull
until I mentioned al-Qaeda.

963
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:41,996
We're front page news now.

964
00:54:41,997 --> 00:54:43,998
Everybody wants a piece of us.

965
00:54:43,999 --> 00:54:47,703
Piece of you. Piece of
me. Piece of all of us.

966
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:49,737
This is my operation, Boaz.

967
00:54:49,738 --> 00:54:52,641
Anything you say or do
need to run by me first!

968
00:54:52,642 --> 00:54:55,743
- You understand?
- Do you understand that we're partners now?

969
00:54:55,744 --> 00:54:59,580
I've started drumming up some
business from some new clients.

970
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:04,152
- What?!
- We should cut bait with this... this Tony guy.

971
00:55:04,153 --> 00:55:08,556
We could be making serious
<i>luka</i> from big-time collectors.

972
00:55:08,557 --> 00:55:11,426
No, no, no, no. Hold on.
That's not why I do this.

973
00:55:11,427 --> 00:55:15,330
A Chinese billionaire
emailed me 2 minutes ago.

974
00:55:15,331 --> 00:55:17,565
He wants to finance us.

975
00:55:17,566 --> 00:55:20,569
I told him we're onto something big, Don.

976
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:23,038
Something really big.

977
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:26,910
The Holy Grail of Biblical artifacts.

978
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:30,578
And what might that be?

979
00:55:30,579 --> 00:55:34,181
The Holy Grail.

980
00:55:34,182 --> 00:55:36,717
You're an idiot. Are you jokin' me?

981
00:55:36,718 --> 00:55:38,719
I'm not a joking you, Don.

982
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,759
And apparently he just
leaked that to the press.

983
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:50,031
Well, you've just turned
this into a royal crap storm.

984
00:55:50,032 --> 00:55:52,500
How in the heck are we gonna find that?!

985
00:55:52,501 --> 00:55:55,536
The same way we found the
Goliath skull, I guess.

986
00:55:55,537 --> 00:55:57,873
We fabricate it.

987
00:56:02,477 --> 00:56:04,312
Don't walk away from this, Don.

988
00:56:06,148 --> 00:56:08,817
I'm the one who knows
your dirty little secret.

989
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:22,763
Don! Hold on. Let me
holler at you for a moment.

990
00:56:22,764 --> 00:56:24,799
Hey, Tony, hey. How are ya?

991
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,069
What's going on? I-I just
talked to a reporter in there.

992
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,371
He said you were thinkin'
about jumpin' ship?

993
00:56:29,372 --> 00:56:31,908
Go work for some Chinese
billionaire. That's not true, is it?

994
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:36,578
Tony, I don't know what to say.

995
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:38,647
- <i>A lot of big things have happened today.</i>
- All right, well,

996
00:56:38,648 --> 00:56:40,214
what's he offering you? You gotta give me

997
00:56:40,215 --> 00:56:41,984
the opportunity to match his offer.

998
00:56:43,418 --> 00:56:45,487
Well, Tony, I...

999
00:56:48,124 --> 00:56:51,259
I'm sorry, Tony, I never
planned it to happen like this,

1000
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,661
<i>but...</i>

1001
00:56:53,662 --> 00:56:57,565
This is just too big an
opportunity to pass up.

1002
00:56:57,566 --> 00:57:00,101
You know, I don't believe this.

1003
00:57:00,102 --> 00:57:01,435
I thought you and I were friends.

1004
00:57:01,436 --> 00:57:04,138
Real soldiers in the Lord's army.

1005
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:06,875
But you've turned out
to be a Judas Iscariot

1006
00:57:09,412 --> 00:57:11,279
- Wait, Tony, I...
- Good day to you, sir.

1007
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,616
Tony, my hands are tied here! I...

1008
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:28,330
There are a few items of business
I want to discuss with you.

1009
00:57:28,331 --> 00:57:30,531
- Keep your voice down.
- All right.

1010
00:57:30,532 --> 00:57:31,866
First item,

1011
00:57:31,867 --> 00:57:34,335
if you're worried about the analysis

1012
00:57:34,336 --> 00:57:36,237
of the Goliath skull, don't be.

1013
00:57:36,238 --> 00:57:38,640
Boaz has taken care of it.

1014
00:57:40,443 --> 00:57:43,277
- Excuse me?
- <i>I offered the lab tech guy</i>

1015
00:57:43,278 --> 00:57:45,848
10 grand to fake the results.

1016
00:57:47,849 --> 00:57:50,752
- You just what?
- Don't worry about the money, Don.

1017
00:57:50,753 --> 00:57:54,589
I'll take care of that, too.
I'm gonna negotiate an advance

1018
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,259
when we have our Skype
call with Poon-Yen tomorrow.

1019
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,326
Who's Poon-Yen?

1020
00:57:59,327 --> 00:58:02,730
- <i>Poon-Yen.</i>
- That's what I said. Poon-Yen.

1021
00:58:02,731 --> 00:58:05,866
No, you said Poon-Yen,
it's Poon-Yen.

1022
00:58:05,867 --> 00:58:08,335
<i>He's the Chinese
guy that's paying us</i>

1023
00:58:08,336 --> 00:58:09,871
to find the Holy Grail.

1024
00:58:09,872 --> 00:58:12,675
<i>Second item of business,</i>

1025
00:58:14,776 --> 00:58:17,680
I want one night with Carol.

1026
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:22,884
Absolutely not.

1027
00:58:22,885 --> 00:58:24,953
You offered to find me a wife, Don,

1028
00:58:24,954 --> 00:58:26,554
that was part of the deal.

1029
00:58:26,555 --> 00:58:28,757
<i>Just one night with Carol.</i>

1030
00:58:28,758 --> 00:58:31,659
Not lovemaking, just dancing, talking,

1031
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:35,197
flirting, having fun.
Smelling each other's hair.

1032
00:58:35,198 --> 00:58:37,232
Absolutely not. Carol's her own woman.

1033
00:58:37,233 --> 00:58:39,366
I can't make her do anything.

1034
00:58:39,367 --> 00:58:42,703
You and I both know that she'll do
just about anything for the cause.

1035
00:58:42,704 --> 00:58:44,471
I need you to make this happen, Don.

1036
00:58:44,472 --> 00:58:46,776
Don't forget about what's at stake here.

1037
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,377
<i>I'll see you 9:00 AM tomorrow</i>

1038
00:58:49,378 --> 00:58:51,246
<i>for the Skype call with Poon-Yen.</i>

1039
00:58:51,247 --> 00:58:54,684
Make up a good story about
where we find this Grail.

1040
00:58:56,385 --> 00:58:58,587
Boaz.

1041
00:58:59,588 --> 00:59:01,589
Boaz.

1042
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:16,237
- Hello?
- <i>Carol, it's Don.</i>

1043
00:59:16,238 --> 00:59:18,706
- Hi.
- <i>Carol, I'm sure you've heard already,</i>

1044
00:59:18,707 --> 00:59:20,708
<i>but I-I just wanna tell you myself.</i>

1045
00:59:20,709 --> 00:59:22,576
<i>We're now being financed</i>

1046
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:24,679
<i>by a wealthy Christian
fellow from China.</i>

1047
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,248
<i>Oh, I know, it's all
over the Internet.</i>

1048
00:59:27,249 --> 00:59:28,984
<i>What did Tony say?</i>

1049
00:59:28,985 --> 00:59:31,920
Well, he didn't take very kindly to it,

1050
00:59:31,921 --> 00:59:34,656
but, uh, we're still on the Lord's
errand and that's what matters.

1051
00:59:34,657 --> 00:59:38,826
<i>Uh... uh, Carol, I had a great
conversation with Boaz today.</i>

1052
00:59:38,827 --> 00:59:41,429
He was askin' me all
kinds of deep questions

1053
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:44,431
about Christianity and
the search for truth.

1054
00:59:44,432 --> 00:59:47,268
I think he might be
interested in gettin' saved.

1055
00:59:47,269 --> 00:59:49,571
<i>Really? Oh, that's wonderful.</i>

1056
00:59:50,972 --> 00:59:52,873
<i>I was wonderin' if you might be able</i>

1057
00:59:52,874 --> 00:59:54,708
<i>to spend some time with
him tomorrow night,</i>

1058
00:59:54,709 --> 00:59:57,045
bear witness of your conversion story.

1059
00:59:57,046 --> 01:00:00,382
I think that might help him get to
the finish line a little quicker.

1060
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:03,551
<i>Oh, absolutely! It
would be my pleasure!</i>

1061
01:00:03,552 --> 01:00:06,453
<i>Thank you, Carol. Hallelujah.</i>

1062
01:00:06,454 --> 01:00:09,723
<i>I'll go ahead and let him know. I'm sure
he'll look forward to hearin' your story.</i>

1063
01:00:09,724 --> 01:00:12,794
- <i>Good night.</i>
- Oh, good night.

1064
01:00:38,486 --> 01:00:40,755
Poon-Yen, hi.

1065
01:00:40,756 --> 01:00:43,458
We realize your time is precious,

1066
01:00:43,459 --> 01:00:45,627
so we're gonna get
straight to the business.

1067
01:00:45,628 --> 01:00:48,462
My business partner's
right here. Don Verdean.

1068
01:00:48,463 --> 01:00:50,364
Pleasure to meet ya, Poon-Yen.

1069
01:00:50,365 --> 01:00:52,801
Hello, Don. I'm a big fan of your work.

1070
01:00:52,802 --> 01:00:55,837
- I have all your DVD.
- Thank you.

1071
01:00:55,838 --> 01:00:58,540
Uh, Don is going to
brief you on what he knows

1072
01:00:58,541 --> 01:01:01,042
about the location of the Holy Grail.

1073
01:01:01,043 --> 01:01:03,844
Uh, many people believe the Grail is buried

1074
01:01:03,845 --> 01:01:06,047
on a booby-trapped
island off of Nova Scotia.

1075
01:01:06,048 --> 01:01:09,484
<i>Even Franklin D. Roosevelt
blew a significant load of cash</i>

1076
01:01:09,485 --> 01:01:12,520
tryin' to find it there, but the
Knights Templar were tricky fellows.

1077
01:01:12,521 --> 01:01:15,790
Oh, yes, those... those damn bastards.

1078
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:18,125
But based on my study of
the Kensington Runestone,

1079
01:01:18,126 --> 01:01:20,728
I believe I have a mountain of evidence

1080
01:01:20,729 --> 01:01:25,065
<i>that places the Grail on an Indian
reservation in the American Southwest.</i>

1081
01:01:25,066 --> 01:01:29,272
Oh, that's very interesting!
Which Indian reservation is it?

1082
01:01:30,773 --> 01:01:33,674
Of course, that information is confidential

1083
01:01:33,675 --> 01:01:36,143
until we've formally
entered into an agreement.

1084
01:01:36,144 --> 01:01:38,078
That's right. Don's right.

1085
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,949
We're going to need a
substantial retainer fee

1086
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:44,685
um, before we can begin. For our services.

1087
01:01:44,686 --> 01:01:47,855
Oh, uh, how much of my money do you want?

1088
01:01:47,856 --> 01:01:50,759
Um, a million dollars sound okay?

1089
01:01:53,528 --> 01:01:57,565
- A million dollars sounds okay.
- Sure... certainly be a start.

1090
01:01:57,566 --> 01:02:00,067
So, when can we go look for the Grail?

1091
01:02:00,068 --> 01:02:02,703
Well, give us a few days
to organize our game plan

1092
01:02:02,704 --> 01:02:05,105
- and we'll call you.
- <i>Sound great!</i>

1093
01:02:05,106 --> 01:02:07,574
Uh, so how will you be paying us?

1094
01:02:07,575 --> 01:02:10,779
We've got a few urgent matters
we need to take care of.

1095
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:14,114
Oh, when I fly out for the
dig, I will bring you cash.

1096
01:02:14,115 --> 01:02:17,719
Is there any way that you could

1097
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,721
wire us the money right now?

1098
01:02:19,722 --> 01:02:22,489
Uh, maybe, I don't know, 10 grand to...

1099
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:25,460
<i>to hold us over till then?</i>

1100
01:02:25,461 --> 01:02:26,895
I'm sorry. Can you say again?

1101
01:02:26,896 --> 01:02:29,163
I can't understand you say. What you say?

1102
01:02:29,164 --> 01:02:32,000
Oh, is there any way that you can wire us

1103
01:02:32,001 --> 01:02:35,002
the money straight away? Like,
say, maybe 10 grand maybe?

1104
01:02:35,003 --> 01:02:38,974
Your accent are very
strong. Can you say again?

1105
01:02:40,608 --> 01:02:43,578
Is there any way you can wire us the money

1106
01:02:43,579 --> 01:02:46,214
straight away, maybe? Just to tide us over.

1107
01:02:46,215 --> 01:02:48,850
Perhaps, about 10 grand?

1108
01:02:50,686 --> 01:02:54,121
Hey, no problem. I'll just, uh...
send me your bank account number.

1109
01:02:54,122 --> 01:02:57,958
Okay, thank you. We'll
do that straight away.

1110
01:02:57,959 --> 01:03:01,529
Okay, fantastic. Uh, goodbye, gentlemen.

1111
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:08,236
And that is what I'm talking about.

1112
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:13,475
Ooh, <i>shalom!</i>

1113
01:03:36,831 --> 01:03:39,199
Ah, good evening, Carol.

1114
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,668
You're lookin' very nice.

1115
01:03:41,669 --> 01:03:44,638
Oh, Boaz.

1116
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:47,074
I didn't know this was a formal event.

1117
01:03:47,075 --> 01:03:49,210
Just a little bit of light dancing

1118
01:03:49,211 --> 01:03:51,813
and maybe some cocktails for two.

1119
01:03:51,814 --> 01:03:54,214
I brought you an outfit.

1120
01:03:54,215 --> 01:03:57,753
Where we're going has a strict dress code.

1121
01:03:59,521 --> 01:04:02,390
Okay, I just need a minute.

1122
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:05,826
Can I...

1123
01:04:14,068 --> 01:04:15,837
<i>Wow.</i>

1124
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:18,174
You look great!

1125
01:04:19,675 --> 01:04:24,078
<i> Come on, baby,
down to paradise </i>

1126
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,049
<i> Tell some stories
over cheese and wine </i>

1127
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:32,955
<i> I can see the sun goin'
down in your eyes... </i>

1128
01:04:36,057 --> 01:04:39,860
So, Carol, I've been meaning
to ask you since I met you

1129
01:04:39,861 --> 01:04:42,663
what qualities are you
looking for in a mate?

1130
01:04:42,664 --> 01:04:45,567
Oh, um...

1131
01:04:45,568 --> 01:04:47,768
I'm sorry, Boaz,

1132
01:04:47,769 --> 01:04:52,739
I was under the impression you had
some questions about Jesus of Nazareth.

1133
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,875
Oh, yeah.

1134
01:04:54,876 --> 01:04:57,612
What is it that you like about that guy?

1135
01:04:57,613 --> 01:05:00,214
Well, um...

1136
01:05:00,215 --> 01:05:03,917
he was kind, handsome,

1137
01:05:03,918 --> 01:05:05,687
merciful,

1138
01:05:05,688 --> 01:05:08,121
forgiving.

1139
01:05:08,122 --> 01:05:10,857
He's the perfect man.

1140
01:05:10,858 --> 01:05:15,064
So, I guess, that's what
I'm looking for in somebody.

1141
01:05:16,965 --> 01:05:18,699
Looks like your Lord and me

1142
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,201
have a lot in common.

1143
01:05:21,202 --> 01:05:23,770
We grew up in the same neighborhood

1144
01:05:23,771 --> 01:05:25,873
and we walked the same streets

1145
01:05:25,874 --> 01:05:28,578
under the same sunshine.

1146
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,779
E-excuse me?

1147
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:35,518
We're both Jewish guys.

1148
01:05:37,285 --> 01:05:39,388
Shall we dance?

1149
01:06:23,698 --> 01:06:25,667
So, Carol, tell me

1150
01:06:25,668 --> 01:06:26,967
do you want children?

1151
01:06:26,968 --> 01:06:28,969
Your hips say that

1152
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:30,471
you can handle many.

1153
01:06:32,407 --> 01:06:36,544
Oh, well, your hips do spread
a little after childbirth.

1154
01:06:38,981 --> 01:06:42,585
- What?
- Oh, didn't Don tell you I have a son?

1155
01:06:43,985 --> 01:06:47,721
He's at the Wayne County
Correctional Facility.

1156
01:06:47,722 --> 01:06:49,723
Oh, he's in jail.

1157
01:06:49,724 --> 01:06:52,928
So I won't have to provide for him.

1158
01:06:54,896 --> 01:06:57,966
I don't want to provide for another's son.

1159
01:07:01,003 --> 01:07:02,370
Carol, wait!

1160
01:07:02,371 --> 01:07:04,971
Don promised me a night with you!

1161
01:07:04,972 --> 01:07:07,975
Don't go! He promised me!

1162
01:07:07,976 --> 01:07:09,409
Please!

1163
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:14,417
<i> I'm here with you </i>

1164
01:07:16,017 --> 01:07:21,122
<i> I'm here with you... </i>

1165
01:07:29,198 --> 01:07:31,132
<i>Carol, what on
Earth happened to you?</i>

1166
01:07:31,133 --> 01:07:33,101
Are you all right?

1167
01:07:33,102 --> 01:07:35,902
Oh, well, I see my pimp has
finally decided to check up on me.

1168
01:07:35,903 --> 01:07:37,871
What are you talking about?

1169
01:07:37,872 --> 01:07:40,208
You know what I'm talkin' about!

1170
01:07:40,209 --> 01:07:43,344
One night with Boaz?!

1171
01:07:43,345 --> 01:07:46,515
I'm no Potiphar's wife!

1172
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:50,851
I am so sorry, Carol. I-I...

1173
01:07:50,852 --> 01:07:53,755
he just said he wanted
to get to know you better.

1174
01:07:53,756 --> 01:07:57,125
- <i>Did he hurt you?</i>
- You know, Don, I think it's time you find yourself

1175
01:07:57,126 --> 01:07:58,995
a new research assistant.

1176
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:21,181
You are a really great dancer.

1177
01:08:21,182 --> 01:08:23,218
Aah!

1178
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:30,424
Ow!

1179
01:08:30,425 --> 01:08:33,360
<i>Ow!</i>

1180
01:08:33,361 --> 01:08:35,164
<i>Don!</i>

1181
01:08:46,074 --> 01:08:48,110
Ooh!

1182
01:08:52,514 --> 01:08:54,682
We've got a major problem.

1183
01:08:56,918 --> 01:09:00,354
<i>I hate this guy, man. This
lab tech guy, I hate this guy.</i>

1184
01:09:00,355 --> 01:09:02,489
<i>- He's a "dootchbag".</i>
- <i>What'd he say?</i>

1185
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:04,858
He says that the press
have been hounding him

1186
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:08,229
and hounding him and unless
he sees some money today...

1187
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:10,163
- he wants it in cash.
- Wait a minute.

1188
01:09:10,164 --> 01:09:12,867
- You haven't paid him yet?!
- I haven't paid him because...

1189
01:09:12,868 --> 01:09:15,336
- Oh!
- Poon-Yen hasn't paid me yet. Okay?

1190
01:09:15,337 --> 01:09:18,038
So don't blame me, Don. Don't put it on me.

1191
01:09:18,039 --> 01:09:20,006
How am I supposed to bring the money?

1192
01:09:20,007 --> 01:09:22,177
Produce it from my anus?

1193
01:09:37,426 --> 01:09:39,559
<i>I understand we
owe you some money.</i>

1194
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,295
Hell, yeah, you do.

1195
01:09:41,296 --> 01:09:43,029
Well, we apologize for the delay,

1196
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:45,366
our money's been tied up
in an offshore account,

1197
01:09:45,367 --> 01:09:47,601
but if you give us another day
or two we'll double your offer

1198
01:09:47,602 --> 01:09:49,537
<i>maybe even throw in a bucket
of chicken or somethin'.</i>

1199
01:09:49,538 --> 01:09:51,605
I need cash now.

1200
01:09:51,606 --> 01:09:53,974
<i>That was the deal.</i>

1201
01:09:53,975 --> 01:09:55,443
If you can't make that happen,

1202
01:09:55,444 --> 01:09:57,545
I'll send everyone the real results.

1203
01:09:57,546 --> 01:10:00,081
- It's that simple.
- <i>We... we understand.</i>

1204
01:10:00,082 --> 01:10:02,582
Okay, drop the phone.

1205
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:05,318
- <i>Oh, whoa. Boaz! What are you doing?</i>
- <i>Put the phone down.</i>

1206
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:07,054
<i>Do you think I'm
fooling around, creep?</i>

1207
01:10:07,055 --> 01:10:09,590
I said drop the phone!

1208
01:10:09,591 --> 01:10:11,458
<i>Boaz, put the gun down.</i>

1209
01:10:11,459 --> 01:10:13,193
Please.

1210
01:10:13,194 --> 01:10:14,929
Oh, my Lord.

1211
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:25,807
Get into the car.

1212
01:10:28,409 --> 01:10:30,144
<i>Come on, get in the
trunk of the car.</i>

1213
01:10:30,145 --> 01:10:32,212
<i>Get in the Fiero!</i>

1214
01:10:32,213 --> 01:10:35,417
Just... see if you can fit in there.

1215
01:10:38,419 --> 01:10:41,354
- Don, help get these...
- No! I'm not helpin' you do nothin'!

1216
01:10:41,355 --> 01:10:43,256
Tuck your knees together, maybe.

1217
01:10:43,257 --> 01:10:44,925
<i>You're gonna crush his skull.</i>

1218
01:10:44,926 --> 01:10:46,226
<i>He's not gonna fit in there.</i>

1219
01:10:46,227 --> 01:10:47,896
Put that gun away!

1220
01:10:49,364 --> 01:10:52,166
Listen to me now, Boaz,
this just got real serious.

1221
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:55,638
You better tell me right now
what you plan to do with this guy.

1222
01:11:08,249 --> 01:11:09,983
Make yourself comfortable.

1223
01:11:09,984 --> 01:11:12,385
If you promise to stay
put for the next few days,

1224
01:11:12,386 --> 01:11:14,188
you'll get 50 grand

1225
01:11:14,189 --> 01:11:16,690
and we can all pretend
like this never happened.

1226
01:11:16,691 --> 01:11:18,860
- Understand?
- Yeah, sure.

1227
01:11:24,065 --> 01:11:27,201
<i>As I surveyed the landscape</i>

1228
01:11:27,202 --> 01:11:29,502
<i>with our expedition
team, a large monolith</i>

1229
01:11:29,503 --> 01:11:32,640
caught my attention,
and somethin' inside me

1230
01:11:32,641 --> 01:11:35,275
just knew that's where
we had to start digging.

1231
01:11:35,276 --> 01:11:38,712
So, following my lead, that
is precisely what we did.

1232
01:11:38,713 --> 01:11:43,416
And within minutes, we unearthed the skull.

1233
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:46,287
It must have been the hand of
the Lord that guided us that day.

1234
01:11:46,288 --> 01:11:49,290
I don't know how else to explain it.

1235
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:52,294
I understand
you've parted ways with Don Verdean.

1236
01:11:54,363 --> 01:11:57,163
Would you mind explaining
what happened, exactly?

1237
01:11:57,164 --> 01:11:59,433
<i>Well, after
a while, some people</i>

1238
01:11:59,434 --> 01:12:02,269
start to chase money, I suppose.

1239
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:05,038
But I am here to promote the faith.

1240
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:09,510
Are you suggesting Don Verdean
made a pact with Lucifer, then?

1241
01:12:09,511 --> 01:12:13,514
Uh, no, no. No, Don is
an honest, gentle man.

1242
01:12:13,515 --> 01:12:15,683
<i>He would never side
with The Dark One.</i>

1243
01:12:15,684 --> 01:12:18,887
Not even if it were to
help him find the Grail?

1244
01:12:32,533 --> 01:12:34,734
<i> Put your hand in the hand </i>

1245
01:12:34,735 --> 01:12:39,273
<i> Of the man who
stilled the water </i>

1246
01:12:39,274 --> 01:12:41,809
<i> Put your hand in the hand </i>

1247
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:44,680
<i> Of the man who
calmed the sea </i>

1248
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,649
<i> Take a look at yourself </i>

1249
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:53,254
<i> And you can look at
others differently </i>

1250
01:12:53,255 --> 01:12:55,589
<i> By puttin' your
hand in the hand </i>

1251
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:58,960
<i> Of the man from Galilee </i>

1252
01:13:00,828 --> 01:13:02,563
<i> My mama taught
me how to pray </i>

1253
01:13:02,564 --> 01:13:05,634
<i> Before I reached
the age of 7 </i>

1254
01:13:07,435 --> 01:13:09,737
<i>-  She said 
-  They'll come a time </i>

1255
01:13:09,738 --> 01:13:14,774
<i> When there'll probably
be room in heaven </i>

1256
01:13:14,775 --> 01:13:18,546
<i> But I'm feelin' kinda guilty
'bout the number of times </i>

1257
01:13:18,547 --> 01:13:21,649
<i> To do what we must do </i>

1258
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:24,085
<i> But we forget what He said </i>

1259
01:13:24,086 --> 01:13:27,153
<i> Then we figure they'll
still make room </i>

1260
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:29,355
<i> Put your hand in the hand </i>

1261
01:13:29,356 --> 01:13:32,561
<i> Of the man who
stilled the waters </i>

1262
01:13:34,128 --> 01:13:36,363
<i> Put your hand in the hand </i>

1263
01:13:36,364 --> 01:13:39,968
<i> Of the man who
calmed the sea </i>

1264
01:13:41,136 --> 01:13:43,403
<i> Take a look at yourself </i>

1265
01:13:43,404 --> 01:13:47,741
<i> And you can look at
others differently </i>

1266
01:13:47,742 --> 01:13:50,277
<i> By puttin' your
hand in the hand </i>

1267
01:13:50,278 --> 01:13:53,314
<i> Of the man from Galilee </i>

1268
01:13:53,315 --> 01:13:55,181
<i> Everybody come a long </i>

1269
01:13:55,182 --> 01:13:57,417
<i> Put your hand in the hand </i>

1270
01:13:57,418 --> 01:14:02,288
<i> Of the man who
stilled the waters </i>

1271
01:14:02,289 --> 01:14:04,492
<i> Put your hand in the hand </i>

1272
01:14:04,493 --> 01:14:07,696
<i> Of the man who
calmed the sea... </i>

1273
01:14:09,197 --> 01:14:12,166
How stupid is this Poon-Yen guy?

1274
01:14:12,167 --> 01:14:15,235
<i>We are now inviting
those passengers with small children</i>

1275
01:14:15,236 --> 01:14:17,571
<i>and any passengers
requiring special assistance</i>

1276
01:14:17,572 --> 01:14:19,806
<i>to begin boarding at this time.</i>

1277
01:14:19,807 --> 01:14:23,309
<i>Please have your boarding
pass and identification ready.</i>

1278
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:27,214
<i>Regular boarding will begin in
approximately 10 minutes. Thank you.</i>

1279
01:14:27,215 --> 01:14:29,215
<i>Ni hao ma.</i>

1280
01:14:29,216 --> 01:14:30,717
How was your flight from the Orient, sir?

1281
01:14:30,718 --> 01:14:33,621
It was fine. When do
we leave for the Grail?

1282
01:14:33,622 --> 01:14:35,322
In 25 minutes.

1283
01:14:35,323 --> 01:14:36,590
We chartered a helicopter to take us

1284
01:14:36,591 --> 01:14:39,626
deep inside the Indian reservation.

1285
01:14:39,627 --> 01:14:42,328
They'll set us down about one
click south of the Templar cave.

1286
01:14:42,329 --> 01:14:44,331
Now, after that, we'll
have under 3 hours

1287
01:14:44,332 --> 01:14:46,500
to penetrate the cave, locate the Grail,

1288
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:48,601
and rendezvous back at
our extraction point.

1289
01:14:48,602 --> 01:14:50,203
You're gonna need to wear this.

1290
01:14:50,204 --> 01:14:53,674
The cave is guarded 24/7
by Native American warriors,

1291
01:14:53,675 --> 01:14:55,809
we don't wanna take any chances.

1292
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:57,746
All right, let's roll in!

1293
01:15:07,756 --> 01:15:10,757
<i>I got 5 helicopters
just like this at home.</i>

1294
01:15:10,758 --> 01:15:14,495
<i>I replaced all the engine
with Rolls Royce engine.</i>

1295
01:15:14,496 --> 01:15:16,698
<i>That... that's
great, Poon-Yen.</i>

1296
01:15:52,234 --> 01:15:54,367
Okay, so our latest intel

1297
01:15:54,368 --> 01:15:57,537
says that the guards
work in 12-hour shifts.

1298
01:15:57,538 --> 01:16:00,707
It takes them 15 minutes to
ride the horse out of the canyon

1299
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:04,377
<i>and another 15 for the
replacement guard to ride back.</i>

1300
01:16:04,378 --> 01:16:07,747
By my calculations we
got a 30 minute window

1301
01:16:07,748 --> 01:16:10,084
in which to fetch the Grail.

1302
01:16:20,928 --> 01:16:23,231
Okay, now's our chance. Let's move.

1303
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:28,601
I can't believe
we're so close to the Grail.

1304
01:16:28,602 --> 01:16:30,703
I can feel its power inside me!

1305
01:16:30,704 --> 01:16:32,774
Well, hopefully,
we can all get a cell.

1306
01:16:49,858 --> 01:16:51,660
All right.

1307
01:16:53,461 --> 01:16:56,064
Better get them lanterns
on. We haven't much time.

1308
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:09,243
All right. Let's sally forth.

1309
01:17:28,329 --> 01:17:31,332
- Maybe we should pray.
- You bet.

1310
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:33,099
<i>That's a great idea. Um...</i>

1311
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,601
Why don't you take the lead on this one?

1312
01:17:35,602 --> 01:17:37,604
Okay.

1313
01:17:37,605 --> 01:17:39,605
Dear Lord,

1314
01:17:39,606 --> 01:17:43,743
please guide us safely to
Your Holy Grail of wonders.

1315
01:17:43,744 --> 01:17:45,778
We promise to take good care of it.

1316
01:17:45,779 --> 01:17:47,948
Amen.

1317
01:17:47,949 --> 01:17:49,849
- Amen. That was good.
- Amen.

1318
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:52,853
How you feelin'? We should get
that... you wanna power through?

1319
01:17:54,989 --> 01:17:56,924
I feel that God is on our side.

1320
01:17:56,925 --> 01:17:59,727
Well, let's sally forth, then.

1321
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:49,177
Poon-Yen, this is all you, buddy.

1322
01:19:15,803 --> 01:19:18,240
It's more beautiful than I ever imagined.

1323
01:19:19,974 --> 01:19:22,876
And to think that the lips of your Lord

1324
01:19:22,877 --> 01:19:25,047
graced this very cup.

1325
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,917
Plenty of time to examine
it later. Put it in here.

1326
01:19:31,185 --> 01:19:32,885
Let's roll.

1327
01:19:32,886 --> 01:19:34,823
<i>Come on. Let's go!</i>

1328
01:19:44,097 --> 01:19:46,901
Head for the safety of the trees!

1329
01:19:51,573 --> 01:19:53,172
They're shooting!

1330
01:19:53,173 --> 01:19:56,009
Hurry! Hurry!

1331
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:57,478
Get down! Get down!

1332
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:02,384
<i>The Indian guys.
They're shooting at us!</i>

1333
01:20:03,685 --> 01:20:05,652
Do they know we have the Grail?

1334
01:20:05,653 --> 01:20:07,554
I think we're trapped.

1335
01:20:07,555 --> 01:20:09,189
<i>What should we do?</i>

1336
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:10,957
They won't stop shooting!

1337
01:20:14,061 --> 01:20:15,828
- I've been hit.
- Oh, no! Oh, no!

1338
01:20:15,829 --> 01:20:17,930
Ow!

1339
01:20:17,931 --> 01:20:19,632
- Oh, my God!
- It's bad.

1340
01:20:19,633 --> 01:20:21,734
They must have hit an artery.

1341
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:24,203
- It's okay.
- I need a tourniquet or a bandage or...

1342
01:20:24,204 --> 01:20:27,174
- tissue paper, anything!
- I'm sorry, Boaz,

1343
01:20:27,175 --> 01:20:30,210
I-I-I think this will take
nothing short of a miracle.

1344
01:20:30,211 --> 01:20:32,546
Oh! What about the Holy Grail?!

1345
01:20:32,547 --> 01:20:35,815
Poon-Yen, fill the Grail with water.

1346
01:20:35,816 --> 01:20:38,784
It contains the secret of eternal life.

1347
01:20:38,785 --> 01:20:40,888
- I'll go fill 'er up.
- Stay calm.

1348
01:20:40,889 --> 01:20:42,356
Just breathe.

1349
01:20:44,859 --> 01:20:46,225
He's bleeding really bad.

1350
01:20:46,226 --> 01:20:48,595
It hurts!

1351
01:20:48,596 --> 01:20:50,229
Just focus on God.

1352
01:20:55,703 --> 01:20:58,538
Hold still. This could hurt.

1353
01:21:02,577 --> 01:21:05,245
<i>It's working!</i>

1354
01:21:05,246 --> 01:21:07,249
Praise the Lord!

1355
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:12,318
I don't believe it because that...

1356
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:15,957
I was in pain and now it's all healed.

1357
01:21:18,059 --> 01:21:20,126
It really is the Holy Grail!

1358
01:21:20,127 --> 01:21:23,330
- <i>Hallelujah.</i>
- All right, let's go.

1359
01:21:25,065 --> 01:21:28,167
Yeah, I think we still may have
time to make the rendezvous.

1360
01:21:32,806 --> 01:21:34,274
Poon-Yen!

1361
01:21:34,275 --> 01:21:36,710
<i>Hey! Cease fire! Cease fire!</i>

1362
01:21:36,711 --> 01:21:38,644
I thought you told them to use blanks!

1363
01:21:38,645 --> 01:21:41,148
They didn't have any blanks, I
told them to fire above our heads.

1364
01:21:41,149 --> 01:21:44,917
Poon-Yen!

1365
01:21:44,918 --> 01:21:47,821
<i>Dr. Odain, you're needed in Oncology.</i>

1366
01:21:47,822 --> 01:21:50,091
<i>Dr. Odain in Oncology.</i>

1367
01:21:53,093 --> 01:21:54,462
What did you tell them?

1368
01:21:55,762 --> 01:21:58,065
I told them it was a hunting accident.

1369
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,868
I wish that guy would
just hand over our money.

1370
01:22:02,869 --> 01:22:04,871
We gave them the Grail,
what more do they want?

1371
01:22:04,872 --> 01:22:07,174
- Shut up, Boaz.
- He can't understand me.

1372
01:22:07,175 --> 01:22:08,908
<i>Can't speak English.</i>

1373
01:22:08,909 --> 01:22:12,078
I should just stick him up
right now and done with it.

1374
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:13,846
Listen here, Boaz.

1375
01:22:13,847 --> 01:22:16,983
You easily the stupidest man I've ever met.

1376
01:22:16,984 --> 01:22:21,054
<i>Bringing you out here was the biggest
damn mistake of my entire life.</i>

1377
01:22:21,055 --> 01:22:24,024
As soon as we pay off that
lab tech, you and I are done.

1378
01:22:24,025 --> 01:22:26,792
I don't ever wanna see or hear from you

1379
01:22:26,793 --> 01:22:29,396
ever again. You understand me?

1380
01:22:36,938 --> 01:22:39,372
Let's just call it quits
right now, then. Shall we?

1381
01:22:39,373 --> 01:22:41,675
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't do this.

1382
01:22:41,676 --> 01:22:43,409
<i>Hold on, now.</i>

1383
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:45,345
<i>Don't do this, Boaz.</i>

1384
01:22:45,346 --> 01:22:47,415
<i>Come on!</i>

1385
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:51,518
Good riddance, Don,
you washed up, old hack.

1386
01:22:55,189 --> 01:22:58,058
Stay here.

1387
01:22:58,059 --> 01:23:00,961
<i>Security
wanted in the parking lot three.</i>

1388
01:23:21,248 --> 01:23:23,282
- Give me the case.
- No!

1389
01:23:23,283 --> 01:23:26,318
- Give me the case!
- No, Don, no!

1390
01:23:34,194 --> 01:23:36,064
Open it up.

1391
01:23:53,413 --> 01:23:57,016
<i>Chang, it's me, Fontaine.</i>

1392
01:23:57,017 --> 01:23:58,918
<i>You're not gonna believe this,
but the Sherriff's department</i>

1393
01:23:58,919 --> 01:24:01,787
<i>just found the lab guy
locked up in a storage unit.</i>

1394
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:03,989
<i>The GPS I stuck on their
car led 'em right to him.</i>

1395
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:06,059
<i>So, I-I'm with the police.</i>

1396
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:08,161
<i>We're waiting for some backup
and then we'll be right over.</i>

1397
01:24:08,162 --> 01:24:10,263
<i>Thank you so much for
your help with this.</i>

1398
01:24:10,264 --> 01:24:12,200
<i>We got 'em.</i>

1399
01:24:13,967 --> 01:24:16,538
We were set up.

1400
01:24:19,106 --> 01:24:22,041
We were set up!

1401
01:24:22,042 --> 01:24:25,010
<i>Poon-Yen was working for
Fontaine this whole time,</i>

1402
01:24:25,011 --> 01:24:27,046
<i>and his name is Chang!</i>

1403
01:24:27,047 --> 01:24:30,250
He doesn't have a billion dollars.

1404
01:24:39,993 --> 01:24:41,528
They've been tracking us!

1405
01:24:47,935 --> 01:24:49,802
You better hit the road, buddy.

1406
01:24:49,803 --> 01:24:51,904
What about you? Where are you gonna go?

1407
01:24:51,905 --> 01:24:54,241
It's better if we split up.

1408
01:25:10,557 --> 01:25:14,161
Stupid bastard. Stupid, greedy bastard!

1409
01:25:16,497 --> 01:25:19,177
<i>Ah, that's him! Go, go, go, go!</i>

1410
01:25:20,368 --> 01:25:22,301
Oh, man.

1411
01:25:22,302 --> 01:25:24,104
Oh, no!

1412
01:25:24,105 --> 01:25:26,439
How do you do this? Is there a button or...

1413
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,375
Hello? Somebody?

1414
01:25:28,376 --> 01:25:31,243
I'm in a-a police car
and we need a spike strip.

1415
01:25:31,244 --> 01:25:33,180
<i>Get me snipers, get me SWAT.</i>

1416
01:25:33,181 --> 01:25:35,916
<i>I want to set up a roadblock
from Kern to Hawthorne.</i>

1417
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:37,449
Can't you ram them or something?

1418
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:40,252
Let's see if you pigs can beat a Pontiac.

1419
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:44,190
<i>Main Street!
They're on Main Street!</i>

1420
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,196
<i>We're only going 35?!
Come on, step on it!</i>

1421
01:25:49,197 --> 01:25:51,399
<i>Do a pit maneuver or something!</i>

1422
01:25:55,136 --> 01:25:57,269
<i>Oh, man. Oh, no.</i>

1423
01:26:04,212 --> 01:26:06,513
- Don't shoot!
- <i>Get your hands up!</i>

1424
01:26:06,514 --> 01:26:08,247
- <i>Get your hands above your head!</i>
- Don't shoot.

1425
01:26:08,248 --> 01:26:09,882
- Get over here!
- <i>We got him!</i>

1426
01:26:11,452 --> 01:26:13,185
You have the right to remain silent.

1427
01:26:13,186 --> 01:26:15,221
- Anything you say...
- That's enough, buddy.

1428
01:26:15,222 --> 01:26:17,290
...can be held against you. Okay.

1429
01:26:17,291 --> 01:26:20,059
You are done, man. You
and Verdean are done!

1430
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:22,429
Tony Lazarus's church is crap!

1431
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:25,431
- Huh? How does it feel?
- It feels great, man.

1432
01:26:25,432 --> 01:26:26,899
Yeah, I'm sure it does.

1433
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:28,902
You had a hand in taking it down.

1434
01:26:28,903 --> 01:26:32,439
A huge hand, and I give
you a hand for that.

1435
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,209
Get him out of here. Get him to jail.

1436
01:26:38,578 --> 01:26:40,447
Yeah!

1437
01:26:40,448 --> 01:26:42,116
Whoo!

1438
01:26:52,025 --> 01:26:54,226
Carol. Carol!

1439
01:26:54,227 --> 01:26:57,898
<i> I started a joke </i>

1440
01:26:57,899 --> 01:27:01,467
<i> Which started the
whole world crying... </i>

1441
01:27:01,468 --> 01:27:03,269
I don't know how to tell you this, but...

1442
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:04,938
I'm a...

1443
01:27:04,939 --> 01:27:06,605
I'm a charlatan.

1444
01:27:06,606 --> 01:27:09,909
- I don't understand.
- I stole the Goliath skull

1445
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:13,046
from a grave in Jerusalem...

1446
01:27:13,047 --> 01:27:15,215
and I buried it in Gath.

1447
01:27:15,216 --> 01:27:18,350
<i>I never meant to hurt anybody,
I just wanted to give people</i>

1448
01:27:18,351 --> 01:27:20,620
a reason to believe.

1449
01:27:20,621 --> 01:27:22,922
How long have you been doin' this?

1450
01:27:22,923 --> 01:27:24,590
It was just the skull.

1451
01:27:24,591 --> 01:27:27,260
Carol, I swear.

1452
01:27:27,261 --> 01:27:29,662
If I have to spend the rest of my life

1453
01:27:29,663 --> 01:27:32,900
tryin' to earn your forgiveness, I will.

1454
01:27:34,668 --> 01:27:37,470
- I love you, Carol.
- <i>Hey, get down on your knees.</i>

1455
01:27:37,471 --> 01:27:40,408
Put 'em up! Right now!

1456
01:27:42,443 --> 01:27:45,245
<i> I </i>

1457
01:27:45,246 --> 01:27:48,180
<i> Looked at the sky </i>

1458
01:27:48,181 --> 01:27:51,984
<i> Running my hands </i>

1459
01:27:51,985 --> 01:27:55,721
- <i> Over my eyes... </i>
- Bye.

1460
01:27:55,722 --> 01:28:00,659
<i> And I fell out of bed </i>

1461
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:04,163
<i> Hurting my head </i>

1462
01:28:04,164 --> 01:28:07,334
<i> From things that I said </i>

1463
01:28:09,403 --> 01:28:13,506
<i> Till I finally died </i>

1464
01:28:13,507 --> 01:28:15,007
<i> Which started the whole... </i>

1465
01:28:15,008 --> 01:28:16,542
We are standing just outside

1466
01:28:16,543 --> 01:28:19,578
the recently foreclosed on
Friendship Harvest Temple

1467
01:28:19,579 --> 01:28:22,381
where Pastor Fontaine is
accused of... there he is now!

1468
01:28:22,382 --> 01:28:24,016
- Not today. Get that thing out of my face.
- Pastor Fontaine,

1469
01:28:24,017 --> 01:28:26,152
what do you have to say about the misuse...

1470
01:28:26,153 --> 01:28:28,354
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- ...of church funds

1471
01:28:28,355 --> 01:28:31,524
- to hire local restaurateur Chang...
- Don Verdean is the fraud.

1472
01:28:31,525 --> 01:28:33,626
- Not me and that's all I have to say.
- Your actions were in fact

1473
01:28:33,627 --> 01:28:35,427
- fraudulent...
- This interview is done!

1474
01:28:35,428 --> 01:28:37,899
- ...even un-Christian!
- Done!

1475
01:28:39,499 --> 01:28:42,068
<i>Reverend Lazarus, what
has this been like for you</i>

1476
01:28:42,069 --> 01:28:44,571
and for your flock since
Mr. Verdean was convicted

1477
01:28:44,572 --> 01:28:46,506
of fraud, larceny,

1478
01:28:46,507 --> 01:28:49,509
aggravated assault, and
accessory to kidnapping?

1479
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:51,176
Well, as you can imagine,

1480
01:28:51,177 --> 01:28:53,712
it has been very, very difficult.

1481
01:28:53,713 --> 01:28:55,314
It's been tough times.

1482
01:28:55,315 --> 01:28:57,349
Tough for my marriage,

1483
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:59,485
tough for my members,

1484
01:28:59,486 --> 01:29:01,121
tough for my very faith.

1485
01:29:01,122 --> 01:29:04,024
But I do believe that Don Verdean

1486
01:29:04,025 --> 01:29:05,492
has a good heart,

1487
01:29:05,493 --> 01:29:07,726
and I believe his heart
was in the right place.

1488
01:29:07,727 --> 01:29:09,595
So, Don,

1489
01:29:09,596 --> 01:29:11,230
I forgive you.

1490
01:29:11,231 --> 01:29:13,198
And if you are watchin' this,

1491
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:16,202
I think the Lord forgives you, too.

1492
01:29:16,203 --> 01:29:17,636
Amen.

1493
01:29:24,444 --> 01:29:25,912
Let's go.

1494
01:29:40,093 --> 01:29:41,561
Whoo.

1495
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:45,033
So, have you joined a gang yet?

1496
01:29:46,499 --> 01:29:50,103
Gotta join a gang, Don, I'm telling you.

1497
01:29:50,104 --> 01:29:52,171
I'm in the Jewish Brotherhood

1498
01:29:52,172 --> 01:29:54,174
with Todd Katzenberg.

1499
01:29:54,175 --> 01:29:56,275
Todd's a tough guy, man.

1500
01:29:56,276 --> 01:29:58,144
A good accountant, too.

1501
01:29:58,145 --> 01:30:01,547
We're called the "He-bros."

1502
01:30:01,548 --> 01:30:03,683
I can get you in...

1503
01:30:03,684 --> 01:30:07,153
but we might have to jump you first.

1504
01:30:07,154 --> 01:30:10,090
No, thank you, Boaz, I'm doin' all right.

1505
01:30:10,091 --> 01:30:12,224
Okay.

1506
01:30:12,225 --> 01:30:14,561
I made you something.

1507
01:30:20,133 --> 01:30:21,867
Check it out.

1508
01:30:21,868 --> 01:30:25,138
It's a toothbrush/shiv.

1509
01:30:25,139 --> 01:30:27,172
This part can brush your teeth,

1510
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:28,675
this part is a knife.

1511
01:30:28,676 --> 01:30:31,679
Brush, stab. Brush, stab.

1512
01:30:33,114 --> 01:30:36,149
Take it, Don, I made this one for you.

1513
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:38,617
It's okay, I've got another
one in my butt crack.

1514
01:30:38,618 --> 01:30:40,555
No, thank you.

1515
01:30:45,626 --> 01:30:47,760
Anytime,

1516
01:30:47,761 --> 01:30:49,362
anywhere,

1517
01:30:49,363 --> 01:30:51,197
any place.

1518
01:30:51,198 --> 01:30:53,668
I'll be here to protect you.

1519
01:30:57,303 --> 01:30:58,837
<i>Shalom.</i>

1520
01:30:58,838 --> 01:31:00,674
<i>Shalom.</i>

1521
01:31:45,351 --> 01:31:47,087
Mind if I sit down?

1522
01:31:51,458 --> 01:31:53,027
My name's Don.

1523
01:31:55,895 --> 01:31:57,564
Hey.

1524
01:32:01,334 --> 01:32:03,503
Your mother named Carol?

1525
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:09,877
- Yeah.
- I know your mother, son.
