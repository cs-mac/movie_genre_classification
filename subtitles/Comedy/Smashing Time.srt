00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,190
What are you doing?<br>♬ <i>From when it was</i> ♬

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,790
You said you were coming but why didn't you come?

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,130
Won...<br>♬ <i>Or how it started</i> ♬

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,840
Are you waiting for Cha Seo Hoo?<br>♬ <i>Or how it started</i> ♬

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,600
♬ <i> You and me, together</i> ♬

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,420
You said you had gone through enough and gotten hurt enough so that you know better now.

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,260
I know Cha Seo Hoo is a bad person,

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,000
but he said he has something he needs to tell me.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,420
So once again you're waiting here because of something that jerk said.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,040
When Seo Hoo left me,

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,200
I wasn't able to hear anything.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,080
I want to hear at least an apology or an explanation.

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,940
So what if you hear those words? What are you going to do with it?

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,820
I also want to hear why he sent me a rabbit doll.

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,470
There's definitely something dangerous in there, I'm telling you!

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,690
Let's go. I'm going to get rid of it completely for you.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,740
<i>Episode 6</i>

23
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,000
Seo Hoo.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,180
Was I very late?

25
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,420
I'm sorry I made you wait.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,090
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Timeless Lovers @ Viki </i>

27
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,180
What are you?

28
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,240
I'm in the middle of talking with Ha Na,

29
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,040
so don't you think it's something you shouldn't interfere with?

30
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,060
Go. You don't have anything to talk about with this punk.

31
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,920
Let's go inside.

32
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,360
Weren't you waiting for me?

33
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,180
"I'll come and pick you up in the evening."

34
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,760
Did you think I would wait for you because you said that?

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,920
Why? What are you, Seo Hoo?

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,800
What are you for me to wait for you?

37
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,420
Don't look for me again.

38
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,830
Did you wait a long time?

39
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,090
As usual, you only say what you want to say

40
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,990
and hear only what you want to hear.

41
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,020
What are you doing? Go inside.

42
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,510
You've become a lot stronger, Oh Ha Na.

43
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,620
Did you enjoy the movie?

44
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,620
I didn't get to watch it.

45
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,100
Thanks to you, I wasted the movie tickets.

46
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,940
No, today

47
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,940
the Sales team has made a big deal over nothing, that's why.

48
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,200
Hey. Brush your teeth first and then talk.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,240
<i>Why? What are you Seo Hoo?</i>

50
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,040

51
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,780
<i>Don't look for me again.</i>

52
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,140
Won.

53
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,910
I wish I didn't have that rabbit doll.

54
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,810
Ha Na.

55
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,590
Should I throw that away too?

56
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,130
She's been like that, not moving at all.

57
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,050
It's the third day already.

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,590
The loser has to pay for chicken feet for three years. Deal?

♬ <i>That's precisely my song of love. </i>♬

68
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,720
Just letting you know, I got a score of 178 for it. Prepare for it.

<i>Girl Fighter<br>Upper cut!!</i>

73
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,110
Wow!

74
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,050
Yes!

75
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,130
That will be 5 dollars.

76
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,880
Why is it so exp- Hey! Hey! Eat a different thing!

77
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,700
What can I do when my mouth yearns for finer quality?

78
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,260
Finer quality, my butt.

79
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,850
There's no way you can get stronger fists as you get older.

80
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,830
Are you angry these days?

81
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,810
<i>Shaking her is my decision. If she wavers, then isn't that her decision?</i>

82
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,250
Hey! Anger or whatever is the past.

83
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,750
It's the age to control your emotional expression.

84
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,030
The machine must be out of order. No wonder, it's old.

85
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,550
It must be you that's old.

86
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,790
How do I not even get above 100?

87
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,220
Starting tomorrow, let's start exercising. At this age, we need to concentrate on building stamina, not strong fists.

88
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,540
They say you must have physical strength on your lower body.

89
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,780
That way, you will have a better body balance.

90
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,440
Hey hey. Your knee is out too far!

91
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,970
Watch. The knee can't go past this point

92
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,570
Oh it's so tiring.

93
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,850
I can't do it.

94
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,100
Let's start that tomorrow too. Together.

95
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,520
Tomorrow at 6. The late person has to pay for chicken feet.

96
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,100
Deal!

97
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,000
Sleep well.

98
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,220
<i>The reason why you repeatedly look back on things that you've thrown away</i>

99
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,530
<i>is not because you don't know why you threw them away.</i>

100
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,980
<i>It's because you wonder maybe one day, you'll need them.</i>

101
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,020
<i>You can never know when that day will come.</i>

102
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,320
- Gather you energy up! <br>- Ugh, I'm dying.

103
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,080
Where did you put all the energy you got from diligently eating three meals a day for 34 years?

104
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,260
Hey! You keep going about my age...

105
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,520
Look at you! You are already huffing.

106
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,920
Go, go.

107
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
Ahh!

108
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,840
Don't push!

109
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,580
Hey, I'm going to fall.

110
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,260
Wow, how refreshing! Rest is really nice.

111
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,160
You really over exerted yourself from the first day, Oh Ha Na.

112
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,420
Are you going to fall asleep at the office?

113
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,000
At this age, for me to have my own room in the office,

114
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,560
it's not a song and a dance.

115
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,040
This is piece of cake.

116
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,780
I see, okay, okay.

117
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,880
I am starting a new project from today.

118
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,320
I've been working on it for a year on my own.

119
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,020
This time I am going to make the Crap Director eat it.

120
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,580
Crap Director.

121
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,040
Wow, I'd see your face on the Time Magazine soon.

122
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,560
Oh, hey~~

123
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,960
Ahh, so refreshing.

124
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,480
Hello, hello.

125
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,880
Good morning So Eun!

126
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,760
Sunbae, you seem to be in a good mood today.

127
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,780
Uhh? What is?

128
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,160
You seem happy about something.

129
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,680
Because the weather is great.

130
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,300
I'll put your shoes under the seat.

131
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,080
I'll put a cushion for you.

132
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,430
As a result of my research for a year,

133
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,480
the best suitable partner for our target

134
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,420
It is Jumei Global.

135
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,480
When did she prepare this?

136
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,740
<i> That's what I am saying.</i>

137
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,040
<i> I get scared every time she does this.</i>

138
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,980
-Shall we look at the slides? <br> -Yes.

139
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,540
They have 2 million customers visiting their website each day.

140
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,860
Not only foreign luxury products, but they also have Korean makeup products.

141
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,980
<i>Through events, we are anticipating good results.</i>

142
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,940
Starting tonight, we are going to work overtime.

143
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,740
If we can't get a contract with this company,

144
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,280
get ready to get your desks removed. So do it well.

145
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,080
That surprised me!

146
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,140
<i>-Were you surprised? <br> -Yeah.<i></i></i>

147
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,100
<i>I don't like us taking long flights like this. We can't be alone.<i></i></i>

148
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,140
<i>What if people see?<i></i></i>

149
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,620
<i>Exactly. Outside we can't do this.<i></i></i>

150
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,520
<i>Let's stay here just a bit longer.<i></i></i>

151
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,800
<i>People don't listen to classical music these days because it's stuffy, do they?</i>

152
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,820
Rather than new things I've always preferred old things.

153
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,040
Wow, I've also been like that recently.

154
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,740
I met a fan with the same preference.

155
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,840
Wow. I didn't know last time I saw you, but you really are a famous person.

156
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,880
You know me?

157
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,660
No, last time when you came to our company I saw you.

158
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,860
While you were coming out of Sunbae Won's office.

159
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,360
Ahh...

160
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,800
But, what is your relationship with Sunbae?

161
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,540
<i> Our relationship is kind of deep.</i>

162
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,940
Then, what kind of relationship does he have with you?

163
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,120
I'm a junior. A company junior.

164
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,200
A company junior.

165
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
-Just? <br> -Yeah.

166
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,980
Uhm...No, I am actually not sure.

167
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,800
I think Sunbae prefers friends over lovers.

168
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,980
Oh Ha Na.

169
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,940
- You know Unni Ha Na too?<br>- I know, right?

170
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,420
Those two are a package where ever they go.

171
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,820
Can I ask for a favor?

172
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,460
Aren't you going home, Team leader?

173
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,440
You go home first.

174
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,720
I'll go once I finish this.

175
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,900
-Then I'll be going first. <br> -Good work today.

176
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,840
Sorry, no no to the early morning workout tomorrow.

177
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,800
<i> I plan to work all night on presentation preparation.</i>

178
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,540
<i> Don't be sorry. The absentee will buy chicken feet twice.</i>

179
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,100
<i> What to do. I am so thankful.</i>

180
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,540
<i> You are genius when it comes to that kind of memory, you cold-hearted punk.</i>

181
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,460
<i>Won!</i>

182
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,540
<i>Would you bring me some cucumber from the fridge?</i>

183
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,660
<i> I think my face had gained some weight. I don't have enough cucumber.</i>

184
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,580
<i> My calves didn't used swell up even after long flight but they do now.</i>

185
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,840
- You need a bottle of beer too.<br>- Man of good sense.

186
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,000
You seem to be in good mood these days.

187
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,000
Tell me if you have something good happening.

188
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,080
Except about Ha Na.

189
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,940
Go ahead and tell me about Ha Na.

190
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,120
I am proud of Ha Na these days.

191
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,900
Why are you being cheesy out of the blue?

192
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,720
There was quite a worrisome issue.

193
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,080
But she overcame better than I thought she would.

194
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,220
And she seems to be living diligently as well.

195
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,700
- Is that all? <br> - Yeah.

196
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:01,420
When did she ever not live her life diligently and well?

197
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,680
She was, right?

198
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:14,820
Okay. You guys continue to be friends like you are playing house as kids.

199
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,040
Then get married when you get older.

200
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,620
Should I?

201
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,800
Huh? What's up with you?

202
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,220
You always beat around the bush.

203
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,390
What is this? What are you doing?

204
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,640
You are already going to work?

205
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,580
I have an important presentation to do today.

206
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,930
Oh, okay. I got it.

207
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,230
You leaving already? What about breakfast?

208
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,150
It's okay. I'll eat when I get to the office.

209
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:20,550
You should eat. If you lose weight as you get older, it makes you look older.

210
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,940
Ugh! I understand.

211
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,340
- Ha Na! Wait just a moment. Fruit, fruit, fruit! <br> - Geez.

212
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,740
So, you are wrapping it up today?

213
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,260
Uhh. Once I finish this presentation, I'll have some room to breathe.

214
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,700
Fighting, Oh Ha Na!

215
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,710
Shall we catch a movie tonight?

216
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,090
That would be nice.

217
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,910
How about a trilogy movie marathon from midnight to early morning?

218
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,590
I am sorry to keep bringing up your age.

219
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:54,200
But you would probably pass out before the first movie is over. <br><i> Let's not waste your physical energy.</i>

220
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,710
How about just watch one movie cleanly and drink some beer?

221
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,320
Fine.

222
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,310
<i>Yeah, yeah. In Ha's mother!</i>

223
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:23,610
Yeah. Yeah.

224
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,210
Ah, I went out and just got back.

225
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,130
What?

226
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,130
Oh my world...

227
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:39,970
In-n Ha is getting married already?

228
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,540
Oh.

229
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,070
Honey! Do we have new tooth brush?

230
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:49,550
Uhh? Yeah, congratulations. Congrats ,congrats!

231
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,590
Where is the wedding venue?

232
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,790
Yeah.

233
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,550
Wow, must be nice.

234
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:21,910
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Timeless Lovers @ Viki </i>

236
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,260
<i> Will you talk to me now?</i>

237
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,440
<i> Come here. It's okay my son.</i>

Oh, this song? <br> ♬ Now, the past things for us

240
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,960
For two, please!

241
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,920
- Alright. <br>- Hello!

242
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,630
We'll get seated.

243
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,030
-It's nice visiting here again. <br> - Yeah.

244
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,590
-What would you like? <br> -We'll start with one kettle.

245
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,290
-I want cod pancake and fish cake soup. <br> -These too.

246
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,490
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

<i> For the day Oh Ha Na will adorn Time Magazine's page.</i>

249
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,810
This is nice!

250
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:23,450
♬ Just looking at your gaze, there's no woman like you

♬ who would talk to me first <br>It's the same for me, just like this!

252
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:40,690
Now that I think back, you were never once

253
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,530
close with any of my past boyfriends.

254
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,450
You never had a nice relationship with any of my past girlfriends either.

255
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,450
Why do you think that is?

256
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,770
Don't know.

257
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,080
Perhaps it's because we are seeing something for each other that both of us wasn't able to see at the time.

258
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,210
You are blinded when you are in love, so you can't see things clearly for yourself.

259
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,100
You can't see what the real problem is or what misfortune you are about to face.

260
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,900
But we each can see it from one step behind.

261
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,610
So we get upset and even think we are being wasted.

262
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:24,280
Right. All you past girlfriends were skanks.

263
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,510
Don't attack my past love.

264
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:31,900
Oh~ You are going to be loyal to your past women.

265
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:40,130
Right. All those women couldn't acknowledge you either.

266
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,470
Ahh.

267
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,230
Okay, okay. I won't date any woman you don't like.

268
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,150
-Really? <br> -If you take out loyalty from Choi Won, then I am only left with this face.

269
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:04,160
Nevermind! Uhh, seriously! Drink!

270
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,720
You really can't date,

271
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,880
unless I give you permission to.

272
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,180
Cheers!

273
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,820
<i> I will see you tomorrow.</i>

274
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,930
<i>I think she'd have dumped me if I didn't have that ring.</i>

275
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,230
<i> Do you like a woman who might dump you over a measly ring?</i>

276
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,530
She fits the bill for my ideal woman.

277
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:51,430
Slight dimples and white hands...

278
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,230
You've gone crazy.

279
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:57,790
I can say this for sure being the only married man here.

280
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,980
Once you are married,

281
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,190
they all are the same.

282
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,510
<i>We'll see about that.</i>

283
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,170
What is your ideal woman, Sunbae Won?

284
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,740
You have those when you are young.

285
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,510
Come on! Slim body? Small face?

286
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,750
You are playing again.

287
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,410
Oh by the way, about Unni Ha Na...

288
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,640
What is Unni Ha Na's ideal man?

289
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,820
<i> Won, my ideal man...</i>

290
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,550
<i> That's because you don't know...</i>

291
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,550
<i> I will find my ideal man with a kiss.</i>

292
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,090
<i> Kiss?</i>

293
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,550
<i> Ideal man is usually described with details such as the height</i>

294
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,090
<i>and how his face looks. Aren't these the sort of thing?</i>

295
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:32,050
<i> I will think about on the first date whether I can kiss him or not.</i>

296
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:38,410
<i> If I can't then he will be scratched from my ideal man.</i>

297
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,670
<i>Give up on your romance novels. You're a serious case.</i>

298
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:48,260
<i> Within the pool of guys who passed the first round.</i>

299
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,920
<i> I will date with the guy who makes my heart pounds and make my head hazy.</i>

300
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,500
<i>That kind of love...</i>

301
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,420
<i> Do you even know it ruins peoples' lives?</i>

302
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,990
<i> It makes hard for the people around to watch the person being ruined too.</i>

303
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,240
<i> Even so, someday...</i>

304
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,810
<i> I want to experience that kind of love.</i>

305
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,950
<i> Crazy love.</i>

306
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,480
<i>Cha Seo Hoo</i>

307
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,410
<i>See you later.</i>

308
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,320
<i>Cha Seo Hoo <br>Delete Conversation</i>

309
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,960
<i>Delete</i>

310
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,250
<i>So Eun</i>

311
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,260
Yes, So Eun.

312
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,840
An arranged blind date?

313
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,860
Yes.

314
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:18,100
If I tell you it's an arranged blind date, I was worried you wouldn't come because you might be uncomfortable with it. That's why I didn't tell you.

315
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:23,510
So Eun, thank you but I don't do arranged blind dates.

316
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,290
I have no thoughts nor time for blind dates.

317
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,950
I'm sorry. I'm going first.

318
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,490
Unni, he said you two know each other.

319
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,290
I was also curious what kind of relationship you two have.

320
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,620
He knows me?

321
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,800
Oh, he's here. Over here!

322
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,820
I asked her.

323
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,960
I wanted to meet you, and I needed to meet you.

324
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,990
What relationship do they have?

325
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,160
You've built a strong wall that I can't even get close to you.

326
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,760
Did Choi Won make it that way?

327
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,940
Did So Eun plan this meeting?

328
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:37,290
I said I wanted to give this to you personally, so she said she's going to have us meet.

329
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,370
I think she really likes Choi Won.

330
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,200
What exactly do you want from me?

331
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,730
You suddenly show up after all these years. What do you want?

332
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,390
Is the wall finally having a crack?

333
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:56,850
You're still the same. You make judgments by yourself,

334
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,990
and digging around by yourself.

335
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,010
I realized something I didn't know.

336
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,390
That I am endlessly thinking of you.

337
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:17,590
Whenever I am walking by myself, driving,

338
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:23,930
whenever it's snowing like crazy or the sun is shining so brightly, I think of you.

339
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,400
Even if I just hear someone talk in Korean in the heart of New York,

340
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,540
because I wanted to hear your voice,

341
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,920
I think I'm going out of my mind.

342
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:42,390
I realized that reason.

343
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,950
You were the one that was dearest to me in my life.

344
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,630
The time we were together was too hot and profound,

345
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,470
that whoever I date couldn't compare to that.

346
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:06,150
I want to meet Oh Ha Na again. I need to meet her.

347
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,190
That's why I came back.

348
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,690
What? Who?

349
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,150
Cha Seo Hoo?

350
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,630
Ha Na is with Cha Seo Hoo right now?

351
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,620
Where is that place? Where is it?

352
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,530
I know it was hard on you.

353
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:48,640
But can you be so sure that you had worse than me?

354
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,240
Say something. Whether you curse or resent me, just say something, anything. In front of me.

355
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,650
I won't talk to you.

356
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,730
Why? Because you might waver?

357
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,670
What?

358
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,660
You're using all your strength to push me away.

359
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,910
I can see everything, Ha Na.

360
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,880
You... really...

361
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,820
<i>Oh Ha Na! Where are you, Oh Ha Na? </i>

362
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,510
Ha Na! Oh Ha Na!

363
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,530
Choi Won's here.

364
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,630
Ha Na! Ha Na! Where are you?

365
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,730
Oh Ha Na!

366
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:35,010
Whenever Oh Ha Na goes, Choi Won comes to find you anytime.

367
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,600
I'm going first.

368
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,440
Don't think you know everything.

369
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,990
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Timeless Lovers @ Viki </i>

<i>Cha Seo Hoo</i>

374
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,010
It's me, Choi Won. Where are you?

375
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,770
What are you doing now?

376
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,110
I told you not to appear in front of Ha Na, didn't I?

377
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:48,530
Have you never thought that you acting like this is something you shouldn't do for Ha Na's sake?

378
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,010
What?

379
00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:00,810
If not for you, Ha Na and I wouldn't turn out this way. Have you never thought of that?

380
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,400
If you didn't hurt Ha Na, things wouldn't turn out this way.

381
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,870
That's not right. You took away the chance for me to prevent Ha Na from getting hurt.

382
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,810
Don't make me laugh. You abandoned Ha Na!

383
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,770
No! I didn't abandon Ha Na!

384
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,730
And you're still the same, getting involved in our relationship.

385
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,100
I'm telling you this again, Choi Won.

386
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,810
You are someone who doesn't have the right to block me.

387
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,270
You're wrong.

388
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,570
You would never be able to go to Oh Ha Na.

389
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:34,050
I will definitely stop that from happening.

390
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,460
It's my first time seeing him that angry.

391
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,980
Unni, what should I do?

392
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,580
Ha Na dated Cha Seo Hoo.

393
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,540
Pardon me?

394
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,220
Cha Seo Hoo, to both Ha Na and Won,

395
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,160
could be the biggest wound.

396
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,770
Ah.

397
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,420
Ha Na! Hey, Oh Ha Na!

398
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,580
Why are you not still up at this time? Are you not going to work?

399
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,360
Work? What time is it, Mom?

400
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,260
It's almost 8 o'clock. How can you still be like this?

401
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,280
Are you really not going to work?

402
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,550
I need to get to work!

403
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,640
Hurry up!

Oh, Assistant Hong. What's wrong?

406
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,230
Team Leader, why can't I reach you?

407
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,030
What's wrong?

408
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:23,550
Yesterday, there was a huge problem because Jumei Global has, all of a sudden, sent additional provisions.

409
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,300
Oh, really?

410
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,880
Fortunately, Team Leader Hwang and Director Byeon

411
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,160
have resolved it well, so I don't think it would pose a huge problem.

412
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,980
That's a relief.

413
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,300
Alright then. I'll see you at work.

414

<i> You definitely can't go to Oh Ha Na. </i>

415
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,230
<i>Because I will stop you no matter what. </i>

416
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,400

417

Hmm? Ok.

418
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,060
I've grabbed the handle tightly.

419

Where should I take you?

420
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,150
I will accompany you wherever you want to go.

421

I'm sorry.

Don't worry, because I took care of it well.

Yes, I'm sorry.

425
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,540
You can go now.

426
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,790
Thank you.

427

428
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,850
You're eating well, right?

Yeah. Still, thanks to you guys I'm fighting through this.

Hey, Oh Ha Na!

438
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,680
What is Choi Won doing?

439
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,950
My first love, Choi Won!

440
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,110
Tell him to come out. It has been a while. I want to see his face.

441
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:14,840
He can come out and pay for the alcohol bill.

442
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,680
Even more grateful if buys an insurance policy.

443
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,450
Really?

444
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:23,850
Then... I'll ask him to buy an insurance policy for me.

445
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,600
Hey, mirror. I need to see a mirror for a second.

446
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,620
Why isn't he answering?

447
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,240
I'm sorry, because of me.

448
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,810
No, I'm sorry for yelling at you yesterday.

449
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:59,410
Is it okay for me to ask why you got so mad?

450
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,930
Who is Cha Seo Hoo?

451
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,790
I guess I can't know everything that goes on between you and Unni Ha Na.

452
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:19,260
But you look like you're worried.

453
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,580
Worried?

454
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,090
Although I don't know what it is,

455
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:28,980
in my eyes, it seems like my chance to get closer to you.

456
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,650
The most important thing for me is the way to get closer to you.

457
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:42,950
How is it that you always show all of your feelings?

458
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:52,560
Because if I hide my feelings, then the other person wouldn't know my heart.

459
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,540
Because then there's a chance that I might lose that person.

460
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,500
Oh, Won!

461
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,020
Hey, Won changed a lot.

00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,290
The extravagant guy is here!

465
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,460
Forgive me, Jeong Mi.

466
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,950
Why are you doing this?

467
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,480
I want to start over again with you.

468
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:46,150
So you changed you mind?

469
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,100
Rather than changing my mind

470
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,510
I realized what I didn't know.

471
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:57,210
I can't live without you!

472
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,580
You can't live without your mother!

473
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,430
But I realized my mom has my dad.

474
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,880
I needed you.

475
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,710
I'm sorry, Jeong Mi, because I'm so immature.

476
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:17,960
I gave you huge pain, Jeong Mi! I deserve to die!

477
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,620
You only know now?

478
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,060
Aigoo.

479
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,500
Chang Soo has matured. He has matured.

480
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,670
You did well, Chang Soo.

481
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:37,080
Yeah, what does it matter if you're late. You can just start over again.

482
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,120
<i> I can't live without you either.</i>

483
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:48,280
It turned out well for you guys!

484
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,500
Good for you!

485
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,320
Don't be like that in the future!

486
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,720
Why are you crying, too?

487
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:12,510
<i>If you realized something you didn't know, </i>

488
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,780
<i>can love also be turned around? </i>

489
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,930
<i>Don't think that what you know is everything there is. </i>

490
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:23,980
<i>It's not that I changed my mind, </i>

491
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,350
<i>but I realized something I didn't know. </i>

492
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:28,310
<i>I realized something I didn't know. </i>

493
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:44,180
This project to begin between us, Tandy, and Cha Seo Hoo,

494
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:49,470
is projected to be a three-month long project that will be of much profit to us.

495
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:54,710
It's a collaboration project between the country's hottest celebrity and Korea's representative shoe brand.

496
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:59,030
From Tandy, Team Leader Oh Ha Na will be in-charge of this project.

497
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:03,490
Cha Seo Hoo personally requested her.

498
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:04,790
I'm sorry?

499
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:07,470
- Do well. <br>- Excuse me, Director Byeon.

500
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:11,330
Because I'm busy with the Chinese project, I don't think that I'll be able to oversee this project.

501
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:15,970
But why? Cha Seo Hoo specifically said that he wanted you, though.

502
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,040
Dae Bok!

503
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,280
What's the problem?

504
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,130
The thing is...there's something I need to ask you.

505
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,110
What is it? Tell me.

506
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:47,400
It's my parents' wedding anniversary next week.

507
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,930
Oh, yeah. It's around this time, isn't it.

508
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,710
I want to send them on vacation but,

509
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:55,540
you know how I'm a bit lacking.

510
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:01,240
Ok. I'll get you the plane ticket. Give it to them as a present.

511
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,390
I should prepare a present too.

512
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:08,780
Thank you, Hyung. I really hope my sister fixes her personality and dates you.

513
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,970
I love you.

514
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,050
Hey! It's gross. It's gross, you punk.

515
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:17,780
Okay. So I got Hyung, now Oh Ha Na.

516
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,650
Hey Noona, I'm going to your company.

517
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,260
There you go.

518
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,260
Okay. I'll give you gift certificates for the present, just think about what you want to buy.

519
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,750
I'm busy with office work right now, so I'll send it through one of my hoobaes.

520
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,580
Ok.

521
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,660
Team Leader, what should I do?

522
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,540
Director Byeon is going on a business trip to China tomorrow, but

523
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,810
no one from our team is going and he said he's just taking the design team.

524
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,980
What?

525
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,830
Team Leader Hwang?

526
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:02,340
Are you really going on a business trip to China tomorrow?

527
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,630
Yes. Director requested me to come.

528
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:10,030
Why are you making a move without even discussing it with the buyer, the marketing team?

529
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:14,230
We're in a meeting right now.

530
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:18,300
If you're going to raise your voice, lets talk somewhere else.

531
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,770
You're dating these days, right?

532
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,540
Why are you talking about that all of the sudden?

533
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:32,580
You are famous for blanking out at work whenever you have a problem with a guy.

534
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,160
What did you say?

535
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,790
Omo. It seems it's only you who doesn't know.

536
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:45,370
Your boyfriend made a ruckus at the wedding of your company junior, you had a scandal with a younger intern,

537
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:51,280
and your famous boyfriend keeps poking his nose into your office, company, and work.

538
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,750
Everyone at work knows that you can't maintain a clear line between official and private matters.

539
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,270
Since the last PPT,

540
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:04,340
did you not realize what is happening at work?

541
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,120
How would you know, when you are so preoccupied with other things?

542
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:13,380
This is work. You know that even if you endure with all your strength, it could end in an instant, right?

543
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:20,540
Stop exaggerating because of your dating matters and get your head together, Team Leader Oh Ha Na.

544
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,940
And at the company,

545
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,200
we will directly carry on the case with Director Byeon.

546
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:31,800
You worked hard till now.

547
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,090
<i> It wasn't that I didn't know, but I forgot.</i>

548
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:05,890
<i> Even through cracks,</i>

549
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,730
<i> wind that can swallow up everything can come in.</i>

550
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,920
<i> What the thirty-four-year old Oh Ha Na has to handle</i>

551
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,390
<i> is not only a love full of scars.</i>

552
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,210
Oh, Father! Where are you going at this hour?

553
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,620
Won! Good thing I met you here.

554
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,100
I went to a reunion few days ago snd came home at dawn.

555
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:35,500
She keeps nagging me about it for days.

556
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,700
Why? Did you drink a lot that night?

557
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,310
I'm going to drink from now. Do you have time?

558
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,150
Of course.

559
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:56,860
She says with words that she doesn't care, but when are even the smallest of something she can nag me with,

560
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,580
"So you felt sad? That's right.

561
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:04,250
Your first love is now alone after a divorce. Of course you should help her".

562
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,970
She keeps getting on my nerves.

563
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:12,210
Mother is being jealous. You should understand.

564
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:15,860
I find it nice to see that you're still fighting over love.

565
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,490
What do you mean fighting over love?

566
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:21,630
How can this be a melodrama? This is a thriller.

567
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,550
- Father.<br>- What?

568
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:26,870
I'm jealous.

569
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:31,030
These kids are still like this even after turning thirty-four.

570
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:36,480
How did you two never change from when you still were in school?

571
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,300
That's right.

572
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:56,670
<i> How did you two never change from when you were still in school?</i>

573
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,560
<i> Wow, Kang Na Yeong is so persistent.</i>

574
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,800
<i> Last time, she wanted to do a three-party meeting at the cathedral.</i>

575
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,170
<i> Now, she told the kids that we should play a truth game.</i>

576
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,470
<i>- Truth game?<br>- Yeah.</i>

577
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:18,520
<i> I don't think you can get away from Na Yeong.</i>

578
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:21,340
<i> - You should continue on with what you were talking about. <br>- What?</i>

579
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:24,690
<i> Truth game. So what did you do?</i>

580
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:29,670
<i> Na Yeong asked again. What kind of person is Choi Won to you?</i>

581
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:32,380
<i> So?</i>

582
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,950
<i> What are you expecting?</i>

583
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,410
<i> Do I have to?</i>

584
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,920
<i> I answered her honestly.</i>

585
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,440
<i> Until I die, Choi Won</i>

586
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,790
<i> will be a far important person than my boyfriend,</i>

587
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:55,290
<i> husband, or family.</i>

588
00:55:56,290 --> 00:56:00,800
<i> I wished we will stay that way. I'm being sincere.</i>

589
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:21,090
<i> You bastard. </i>

590
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,160
<i> Let's go.</i>

591
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,080
<i> You bastards!</i>

592
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,900
<i> You bastard!</i>

593
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,400
<i> Why can't I like Oh Ha Na?</i>

594
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,300
<i> Why can't I?</i>

595
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,290
<i> Hey!</i>

596
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,500
<i> Why?</i>

597
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,460
<i> Why?</i>

598
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:44,900
<i> Stop getting beaten up. Who are the kids who hit you?</i>

599
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,250
<i> Tell me. I will avenge you.</i>

600
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:50,710
<i> It's your fault.</i>

601
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,120
<i> Why? Why is it because of me?</i>

602
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:59,770
<i> Why? Are there iljins (kids who do bad things such as drinking or smoking) who are after me?</i>

603
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:02,540
<i>Did they pick a fight because you are my friend?</i>

604
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,820
<i> So because it's troublesome, are you going to say</i>

605
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,880
<i> "I'm never going to love you" again?</i>

606
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,840
<i> I</i>

607
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:27,340
<i> won't love you either.</i>

608
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,540
<i> Don't worry, Choi Won.</i>

609
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:52,590
<i> If you knew back then about my secret I couldn't tell you,</i>

610
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,770
<i>would you have been happier?</i>

611
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:11,030
<i>Even the times when you got hurt because of love</i>

612
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,410
<i> and had difficult times,</i>

613
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:21,880
<i> would I have been able to stop that?</i>

614
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,450
<i>Even now, Oh Ha Na...</i>

615
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:34,370
<i> If you find out everything that you didn't know about,</i>

616
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:41,750
<i> will I be able to protect you?</i>

617
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,630
<i> Can I</i>

618
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,000
<i> love you</i>

619
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,330
<i> now?</i>

620

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Timeless Lovers @ Viki </i>

00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,910
<i> Ha Na, I'm here.</i>

623
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,420
<i> I'll go to you. Stay still and don't move.</i>
