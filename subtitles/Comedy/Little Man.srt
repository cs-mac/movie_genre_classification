1
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,074
One, two, three...

2
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,299
three, three.

3
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:54,736
Yo, what comes after three?

4
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:57,234
Four. Four comes after three.

5
00:00:57,407 --> 00:00:59,398
- I don't hear you counting.
- Four.

6
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:02,468
Four.

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,165
- Five.
- Five.

8
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,808
- Six.
- Six. Faster.

9
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:10,738
- Seven, eight.
- Sims. Sims!

10
00:01:10,907 --> 00:01:12,340
You're going home.

11
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,667
I'll see you around,
sweet mouth.

12
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:25,668
Inmate on deck.

13
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,535
- He'll be back.
- What's up, baby?

14
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:30,231
See you around, big man.

15
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:33,168
Gate open.

16
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:57,935
Where the hell is this guy?

17
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,170
Cal. Cal.

18
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:17,473
- What an idiot.
- Let me pop this door for my man.

19
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,631
My main man, just getting
home from prison.

20
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:26,002
- Percy.
- I'm sorry, Cal.

21
00:02:26,173 --> 00:02:27,801
You stupid?

22
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:32,409
All right, wait. Hold up. So
they want us to steal a diamond?

23
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:36,567
- How much your man Walken paying?
- Dig this. A hundred G's.

24
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,708
A hundred G's?

25
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:41,171
- That's good loot.
- Enough to get my label started.

26
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:44,540
Let me give you a taste
of my first single.

27
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:48,737
- It's fire.
- Yeah.

28
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,698
Never been shot before...

29
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:55,310
but I've been beat about the skull
and the neck area with a crowbar.

30
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:57,237
Check the lyrics,
check the lyrics.

31
00:02:57,707 --> 00:02:59,436
I'll take you to
the butcher shop.

32
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:02,137
Let you lick a big pork chop.

33
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,468
Girl, I know you like ham hocks.

34
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,939
If you're Jewish, I
even got lox Hey! Hey!

35
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,171
Yo, camel-mouth.

36
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,935
- That's 50 Cent.
- Cal, that's not 50 Cent.

37
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:15,404
He talk about candy.

38
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:17,972
I'm talking about meat.

39
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,836
That's a whole other level.
P-Unit.

40
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:23,168
You better off stuffing
your money in a mattress.

41
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,104
Yeah. I bet you gonna
mess your money up...

42
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,741
on booze and cheap hookers.

43
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,135
- So?
- What you need to do...

44
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:31,775
is iust find you a nice
girl and settle down, Cal.

45
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,771
Come on, P, you know
that ain't happening.

46
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,306
I mean, you being
all short and all.

47
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,005
Let me tell you
something about love.

48
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:42,735
I never had it. I don't want it.
I don't need it. All right?

49
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,402
You ain't gotta keep hitting me, Calvin.
I'm not your child.

50
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:50,476
How am I gonna be a hard-core rapper
if you keep putting your hands on me?

51
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,737
Don't push me Because
I'm close to the edge.

52
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:58,774
Check this out. You hang in the
back until Vanessa gets here.

53
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,532
When I give a signal,
you come out.

54
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,765
That's cool. I got you.

55
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,602
Hey, Jimmy, please, man. This
is the biggest day of my life.

56
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:08,073
- It's gotta go off right, okay?
- Baby, what'd I tell you? I got you.

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,730
And can I say something?

58
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:12,671
- Congratulations, man.
- Thank you.

59
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,673
You done stepped up to the plate.
Give me a hug, homeboy.

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,003
Oh, man, you done
did it, you know.

61
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:23,941
Hey, man, you ain't
had to do this.

62
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,498
You know, the valet tripping.

63
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:29,142
- Made me park around the corner.
- Jimmy, get-Beat it.

64
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:30,934
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Get on it.

65
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,304
- Hi.
- Hey, beautiful.

66
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,434
So I'm so glad that you got
out of work to be here.

67
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:47,541
You think I wouldn't take off work?
And miss this? Are you crazy?

68
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:49,436
Look at you, beautiful.

69
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:52,474
- You are glowing. My God.
- Thank you.

70
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:55,639
It feels like it was
iust yesterday...

71
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,132
sitting in this same restaurant,
when I asked you to marry me.

72
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:02,807
I'm still working on that diamond.
I didn't forget the diamond.

73
00:05:02,973 --> 00:05:06,637
I know, baby. You are the sweetest,
most supportive man on the planet.

74
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,398
Can I talk now?

75
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:11,542
- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
- Okay.

76
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:14,437
So you know what I've been
waiting all week to find out.

77
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,302
Yes. Yep.

78
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:18,669
- Well, I got the news...
- Yeah.

79
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,332
- ...and I'm-
- Pregnant. Yes! Yes!

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,400
- Having my baby.
- Oh, no.

81
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:27,405
- Is so important to me.
- No. No, no.

82
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:29,474
- Darryl. Darryl.
- Baby.

83
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,803
- There's nothing more special.
- Darryl-No, honey, I'm not pregnant.

84
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:34,805
- I'm not pregnant.
- Than to raise a family.

85
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:37,442
- Excuse me, sir. Sir. Sir.
- I thought that you-

86
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:38,733

87
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:40,374

00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,567
No. Stop. No.

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,902
I'm not pregnant.

91
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,965
- No?
- No.

92
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,263
You're not pregnant?

93
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,307
Baby, but you was nauseous and
throwing up all over the place.

94
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:01,839
Well, I was very nervous.

95
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:04,235
Baby, what are we doing here?

96
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,568
Darryl...

97
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,537
I got the promotion.

98
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:12,143
And we're movin' on
up To the east side

99
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:13,569
Jimmy.

100
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,208
They'll be movin' on up To
that apartment in the sky.

101
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:20,276
- I'm gonna hurt him.
- Hey. Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy, stop.

102
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,670
- Man-Man, you ain't got to do this.
- Hey...

103
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,142
- Okay, then. All right.
- Beat it.

104
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:29,837
Congratulations. I'm
really proud of you.

105
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:33,806
But?

106
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:36,801
But I thought we was
gonna start a family.

107
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,107
We will, baby.

108
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:43,805
You know, with this promotion,
everything's on track now.

109
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:48,001
In a couple of years I'll be senior V.P.,
and I can take time off to have a child.

110
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,142
A couple of years? I
don't wanna wait years.

111
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:52,639
Darryl, you know, having a
baby changes everything.

112
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:54,871
Hey, I'm willing to
do whatever it takes.

113
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,133
So no more late-night
poker with the guys.

114
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:58,896
Cool.

115
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,837
No more...

116
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,736
afternoon quickies.

117
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:05,398
Stop right there. We haven't
had a afternoon quickie...

118
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:06,905
since your father moved in.

119
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:10,669
That is not fair. My dad is getting old.
Sometimes he forgets things.

120
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,138
I don't feel comfortable
with him living by himself.

121
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,569
What about Whispering Glen?

122
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,300
That place looked like a country
club inside the brochure.

123
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:19,408
They got Viagra
vending machines.

124
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:20,563
You listen to me.

125
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,301
Until he is a danger to himself
or others, he is staying with us.

126
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,334
Now...

127
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:29,168
can we celebrate?

128
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,334
Celebration, come on We
gonna celebrate tonight.

129
00:07:34,507 --> 00:07:37,738
Come on, come on, let's celebrate
Let's not have a fight.

130
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,068
And I'm not talking tonight.

131
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,174
Remix! Now just you ladies.

132
00:07:42,873 --> 00:07:47,334
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate.

133
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,338
Hey, oblivious.
What are you doing?

134
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:04,600
Getting ready to rob a
iewelry store, Calvin.

135
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:06,264
I'm going straight Jesse James.

136
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,671
Percy, put the gun away. Guns is
how you wind up back in prison.

137
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,469
I'm telling you, I ain't going back to jail.
You understand?

138
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,335
Now put the gun away.

139
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:17,332
Why you gotta keep
hitting me, Cal?

140
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:20,169
Sometimes I gotta slap some
sense into you, Percy.

141
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,398
Come on. Give me a hand.

142
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:27,074
Now, would you
trust the big man?

143
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,997
I got a plan, yo.

144
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,805
Now, this stone is a
3-karat, G-color diamond.

145
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,774
- VVS2, nearly flawless.
- It's been a pleasure, sir.

146
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:41,732
Just be cool, Cal.
I'm telling you.

147
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,201
Oh, there she go. There's-

148
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:45,841
Go ahead. Do your thing, Cal.

149
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,008
Pardon me for iust a moment.

150
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,404
- Do your thing.
- Yes? May I help you?

151
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:08,771
Percy. CEO and A&R
of P-Unit Records.

152
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,931
Here to pick up iewelry
for one of my artists.

153
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:13,432
Well, holler at your girl.

154
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,172
Step this way, Percy P.

155
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,331
I like the way you
said my name just now.

156
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:20,065
Can I sit down?
She's sitting down.

157
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,572
Of course you may. Would you
like some gin and juice?

158
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:43,475
Well, I'm gonna show you some
shiznit right about now.

159
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:50,402
Yes. Come to daddy.

160
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:04,604
Now that's what I'm
talking about, baby.

161
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:06,901
So, what can I get for
you today, Percy P.?

162
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:10,775
All of the above.

163
00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:17,074
I'll send one of my assistants
from P-Unit Records...

164
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,502
to pick everything up.

165
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:22,667
Just tell him to pull up to my bumper,
and I'll throw that junk in his trunk.

166
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:24,467
Word?

167
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,699
Let me get up out of here.
I gotta bounce.

168
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:30,342
I got some people meeting me
down there, and I gotta...

169
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:32,733
So I'm gonna leave, you know?

170
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,405
- Okay? See you later, all right? Peace.
- Peace.

171
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,731
Be cool. What's
going on in there?

172
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,568
Has anyone seen my dog?

173
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,231
Hi, puppy.

174
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,164
He stole my dog.

175
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:54,563
Holy crap.

176
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,340
The Queen's diamond. It's gone.

177
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:00,271
Relax. We almost there, man.
We about to be paid, man.

178
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,238
I need the police. Yes,
there's been a robbery.

179
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:08,634
We did it. Modern-day Butch
Cassidy and Sundance.

180
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:11,002
Come back here with my dog.

181
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:14,167
- Get out of here, mutt.
- You just tossed a Chihuahua.

182
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,173
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Gotcha that. We are gone.

183
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,637
Come on, Percy.

184
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:23,932
- Oh, man.
- This ain't time to be doing doughnuts.

185
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:28,604
I can't believe this, man.

186
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,498
Damn it, Percy.

187
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:33,575
You got a boot on the car, and you
about to get one in your butt.

188
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,674
- She finally got me.
- Who?

189
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,741
Nettie, down at Motor Vehicles.
Said I got her pregnant.

190
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,341
I went to family court.
I had all my receipts.

191
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:43,433
I'm out.

192
00:11:44,507 --> 00:11:47,169
- Hey, yo, Percy. You forgot something.
- What?

193
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,171
Me!

194
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:53,066
- Come on!
- Sorry, Cal.

195
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:03,041
- They went that way.
- What'd he look like?

196
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:04,765
- Black.
- I got him.

197
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,067
- Dark or light?
- Medium.

198
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,731
Suspect is escaping on foot.
African-American male.

199
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:12,740
About 5'1 O", not real dark,
more of a mocha-caramel color.

200
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:24,298
What? You shot?

201
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,441
Sweet beiesus. My muscle,
I think I pulled it.

202
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:29,404
Quick. In here.

203
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,265
Yo, quick, put me down.
We gotta split up.

204
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,964
Okay.

205
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,571
It's late because of the stress,
not because I'm pregnant.

206
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,232
Please, don't even say words like "stress.
" It's not good for the baby.

207
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,935
Darryl, there is no baby.

208
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,234
- Aisle two.
- Well, why didn't you just say that?

209
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,207
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay, fine. Just humor me, okay?

210
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,069
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

211
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:20,943
- Enough.
- Okay, okay.

212
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,901
I got one!

213
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:37,299
- Come on, man.
- Do not resist. Do not resist.

214
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:39,408
- I'm not resisting.
- Wilson. Wilson. Wilson.

215
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:41,007
Come on. It's not our guy.

216
00:13:41,174 --> 00:13:43,404
What? You said African-American.

217
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:46,005
Yeah, but I said a
mocha-caramel color.

218
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:48,836
He's like a Starbucks black
decaf, maybe a little cream.

219
00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:51,571
- It's not our guy. Sorry about that.
- Come on, man.

220
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,402
- You sure?
- Yeah. He's okay.

221
00:13:57,307 --> 00:13:59,434
- Wilson!
- Well, he looked mocha to me.

222
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,572
- Thank you.
- What?

223
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,501
He looked real shady. He gonna do
something else, and I'll be waiting.

224
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:13,332
- You still got the diamond?
- No.

225
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:15,304
- I had to ditch it.
- Where?

226
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,398
In her bag.

227
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:19,973
Calvin, now what?

228
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,232
We go get it.

229
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,971
Let's go. Come on.

230
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,407
Follow that car.

231
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:58,601
Yo, there they are.

232
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,002
- There is no baby.
- There is.

233
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:02,642
- Honey, there is no baby.
- Well, there will be.

234
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:05,141
Let's go.

235
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:11,801
Daddy, we're home.

236
00:15:12,174 --> 00:15:15,735
- There's my baby girl.
- Hi, Daddy.

237
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:19,733
Who's the best daddy in
the whole, wide world?

238
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:22,273
- I am.
- I know you can do better than that.

239
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,670
Who's the best daddy in
the whole, wide world?

240
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,604
- I am.
- I can't hear you.

241
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:29,935
I'm the best daddy in
the whole, wide world!

242
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:45,406
So, what's the good news?

243
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:47,007
Dad...

244
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:48,607
I got the promotion.

245
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,267
Congratulations. Soon you'll make
enough money to leave that bum.

246
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,135
Oh, Dad, he's not a bum.

247
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:58,003
No? What kind of man gives
the woman he loves...

248
00:15:58,173 --> 00:15:59,766
a wedding ring with no diamond?

249
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,103
Hey, as soon as I make enough
money, I'm gonna buy her a diamond.

250
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:05,674
And I'm going to do the nasty
with Jennifer Lopez...

251
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,741
while Halle Berry
tickle my butt.

252
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:12,503
You know, for a moment I thought
you were gonna tell me...

253
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:14,733
you were gonna let this
one impregnate you.

254
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,637
But I see now, this man ain't
got no bullets in the chamber.

255
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:19,274
What's that supposed to mean?

256
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,408
You heard me. You're
shooting blanks.

257
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:24,236
- Cooking with a wet noodle.
- What?

258
00:16:24,407 --> 00:16:26,238
Can't hoist the mainsail.

259
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:29,808
My sperm have fallen
and it can't get up.

260
00:16:29,974 --> 00:16:31,965
I'll have you know, I
hit that every night.

261
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,971
Hey, that's my daughter
you talking about.

262
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,904
- Back up, old man.
- Okay, okay. Stop. Stop. Please.

263
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:38,098
Gentlemen.

264
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:43,211
Dad, we are going to have a
baby when the time is right.

265
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:46,202
Play nice.

266
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,734
It's still in the bag.

267
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,708
Still in the bag. Let's
go get the rock.

268
00:16:58,873 --> 00:17:02,435
Yo, Percy, how many times I
gotta tell you? No guns.

269
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:03,596
What we gonna do?

270
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,743
Walken is gonna kill us if we
don't give him the diamond.

271
00:17:06,907 --> 00:17:08,932
Then I guess we gotta
find a way to sneak in.

272
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,904
Well, they did say
they wanted a baby.

273
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,206
No. No.

274
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,104
No. I ain't dressing
up like no baby.

275
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:26,007
Keep still, Cal. You heavy.
You gonna make me drop you.

276
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:28,665
You drop me and I'm
gonna drop you.

277
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,501
Now, look, you stay close.

278
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:33,268
I'm gonna go in, I'm gonna get
the diamond, and I'm out.

279
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,740
If you don't mind me saying, Cal,
you make a cute little baby.

280
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:38,965
I'm out.

281
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,404
You couldn't find nothing
better than a dog basket?

282
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:45,010
You iust be cool. I told you,
this gonna be great, Cal.

283
00:17:48,974 --> 00:17:50,805
Just hold tight.
Everything gonna be fine.

284
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:53,135
I'm gonna be over
here in the bushes.

285
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,302
Move, dog.

286
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,499
Get out of here. I'll
make a coat out of you.

287
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:08,006
Get out of here before I
feed you some chocolate.

288
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:11,142
Get out of here, you fleabag.

289
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:12,968
- Go.
- Get out of here.

290
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,165
Wait, hold-Wait. Muttley, wait.
No, no.

291
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:32,406
Honey.

292
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:34,303
- Yeah?
- Come here.

293
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:36,505
- What is it, Darryl?
- Look.

294
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:41,170
Oh, my God.

295
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,807
It's a baby.

296
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:46,799
I know. And here's a note too.

297
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,335
"Plez luk tafter Kalvin.

298
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:52,999
We wuzn't abele to keap em."

299
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,108
Poor guy. His parents
must've been retarded.

300
00:18:55,974 --> 00:18:57,566
Well, let's get him inside.

301
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,106
- It's cold out here.
- Okay, okay. All right.

302
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:01,468
Come on, little guy.

303
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,505
- Yes.
- I got you.

304
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,898
Oh, damn.

305
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,567
- What in the hell is that?
- I don't know.

306
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:13,406
Man.

307
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:16,071
Dad, we found a baby
on the doorstep.

308
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,936
- What? What is it? A boy or girl?
- Dada.

309
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,572
I think it's a boy.

310
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,901
Well, whatever it is,
it smell like piss.

311
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,736
Yeah. I think Janet may have
left diapers here. Let's look.

312
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:28,966
Doesn't your dad have
some diapers upstairs?

313
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,734
I heard that. I don't wear diapers.
Who you talking about?

314
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,830
Haven't worn a diaper in years.

315
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,998
I think she put them in here.

316
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:44,932
What is it?

317
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,001
That ain't no baby.
That's a porn star.

318
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:52,743
What on girth is that?

319
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:55,940
I'm gonna call Child Services.

320
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,165
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Do that.

321
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:04,666
Directory assistance.

322
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,638
Yes, can I have the number
for Child Services, please?

323
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,468
Connecting you.

324
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,002
Child Services is now
closed for the weekend.

325
00:20:13,173 --> 00:20:16,701
We will re-open at 9 a.
M. Monday morning.

326
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:22,240
They're closed for the weekend.

327
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:25,171
The office doesn't open until
9:OO on Monday morning.

328
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,099
So, what do we do now?

329
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,907
I say, toss this creature back in the
Black Lagoon where it came from.

330
00:20:31,074 --> 00:20:32,234
Daddy, stop it.

331
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:35,135
Maybe we should call the police.

332
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,973
- That doesn't sound good.
- No, we should take him to the doctor.

333
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,973
Get him checked out. Who knows
what he's been through?

334
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,607
- Okay?
- I'll go get the car keys.

335
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:55,763
- All right.
- Okay.

336
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:59,474
Now, when you get to the hospital,
don't stop. Don't stop.

337
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,108
Toss that monster out the
window and keep moving.

338
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:05,300
Hit the accelerator. I don't wanna
see that little ugly thing again.

339
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:08,799
Stinky little thing.

340
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:10,973
Was it a little cough?

341
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,129
- No.
- No.

342
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:15,765
No, this was like a
grown-man, smoker's cough.

343
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:18,938
Well, it's probably nothing.

344
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:21,598
Come on, let's get
his shirt off.

345
00:21:23,974 --> 00:21:27,102
He's a strong little fella.

346
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,768
Oh, my God. What is that scar?

347
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:35,898
From the look of it, I'd say...

348
00:21:36,074 --> 00:21:38,474
this little guy has had
his appendix removed.

349
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,471
Or he was in one hell
of a knife fight.

350
00:21:43,907 --> 00:21:45,534
What kind of person
tattoos a child?

351
00:21:45,707 --> 00:21:47,197
Oh, you'd be amazed. Come on.

352
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,300
Open up. Open up and say:

353
00:21:50,474 --> 00:21:52,305
Come on. Come on. Come on.

354
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,336
- Wha-? What is it?
- I've never seen a...

355
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:00,735
baby with bridgework.

356
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:04,970
This child has the mouth
of a 40-year-old man.

357
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,877
I can't tell whether these teeth
are coming in or falling out.

358
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,667
Well, he's gonna be okay?

359
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:13,404
He's fine.

360
00:22:13,574 --> 00:22:17,874
His tonsils are a little swollen
and he might have a bit of a cold.

361
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,029
As a precaution...

362
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:21,971
you should take his temperature
before you put him to bed.

363
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,108
- All right. Thank you, Dr. Murphy.
- Okay.

364
00:22:24,274 --> 00:22:26,834
- Thank you very much.
- Bye.

365
00:22:27,673 --> 00:22:30,165
This is iust-It's horrible.
Look at this child.

366
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,205
Let's turn him over
to the authorities.

367
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:34,501
They can find his parents
and prosecute them.

368
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:36,141
Are you crazy? We can't do that.

369
00:22:36,307 --> 00:22:38,070
This kid's been
through the wringer.

370
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,572
Besides, his birth parents
are probably crackheads.

371
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,640
They're iust gonna
put them in rehab.

372
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:45,799
Then they'll be back on the street,
selling him for a bag of rocks.

373
00:22:46,474 --> 00:22:48,704
What are you saying?

374
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:51,104
I'm saying, why don't
we just keep him?

375
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:53,236
- Just until Monday.
- No. No, Darryl.

376
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:54,601
- Just until-
- He's a child.

377
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:57,334
- I don't know what to do with a child.
- Just until Monday.

378
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:59,372
And then we'll take him
to Child Services.

379
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,701
They'll find a home for him.

380
00:23:01,873 --> 00:23:04,934
Besides, who could take better
care of this child than us?

381
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:11,172
- Where is he?
- Oh, man.

382
00:23:16,974 --> 00:23:19,340
Where do you think you're going?

383
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,536
Well, what do we got here?

384
00:23:22,974 --> 00:23:24,737
- Is this your baby?
- Yes, thank you.

385
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:28,174
Well, actually...

386
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,002
- ...we found him-
- Mama.

387
00:23:36,107 --> 00:23:37,734
He called me Mama.

388
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,164
There you go.

389
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:46,069
Thank you, officer. Thank you.

390
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,138
You know, Percy, I don't like
having to look for people.

391
00:23:51,574 --> 00:23:53,599
Who, me? I wasn't hiding, Mr. W.

392
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:55,105
Not Percy. Not the Kid.

393
00:23:55,274 --> 00:23:57,242
I was gonna come soon
as I got the diamond.

394
00:23:57,673 --> 00:23:59,141
So you don't have
my diamond, huh?

395
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:00,774
No. I mean, I do.

396
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,840
I don't have it on me
now, but it's safe.

397
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:06,067
We got everything on lockdown.
Believe me. Trust me.

398
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,504
You trying to hustle me, Percy?

399
00:24:08,974 --> 00:24:11,966
Hustle a hustler? Ain't
nothing happening, Mr. W.

400
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:15,207
It's iust that the robbery didn't
go as smooth as we wanted to.

401
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:18,537
And a situation had popped
up, so we had to split.

402
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,767
- But my partner, he-
- Your partner is not my problem.

403
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,408
My problem is I don't
have my diamond.

404
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:26,798
Now, I'm gonna
give you 24 hours.

405
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:30,239
After that, my problem becomes
Bruno and Rosco's problem.

406
00:24:31,474 --> 00:24:32,839
And they...

407
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,565
become your problem.

408
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,105
You got a problem with that?

409
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,704
Ain't got no problem
with that, Mr. W.

410
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:40,774
I got it all under
control, I swear.

411
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,101
Don't want a smudge on it,
not a speck, nothing.

412
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,333
Not a smudge.

413
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,968
Okay, Mr. W.

414
00:24:48,007 --> 00:24:49,406
Get him out of here.

415
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:51,542
- Get him out of here.
- Come on.

416
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,665
Ain't nothing better
than the evening news...

417
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,365
and my favorite,
milk and cookies.

418
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:05,268
Damn, I forgot my milk.

419
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,670
Jeez, man, you can't be
popping up like that.

420
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,903
For a moment I thought
you were Chucky.

421
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,101
About to put you in a chokehold.

422
00:25:14,107 --> 00:25:15,699
What are you looking at?

423
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:20,407
A man who exposed himself to police
oflicers in a doughnut shop...

424
00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:22,940
claimed that voices
made him do it.

425
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:25,974
Oh, honey, look how
comfortable he is with us.

426
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,131
He is so cute.

427
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:29,899
Oh, no, you don't.

428
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:32,907
No, you don't. No, no, no.

429
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:34,939
- Dad.
- Come on, Pop, let him sit there.

430
00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:38,508
- Let him have a cookie.
- This is my throne, my sanctuary.

431
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:40,665
This is my air, my end zone.

432
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,900
- It's iust a cookie.
- Oh, it start with the cookie.

433
00:25:46,307 --> 00:25:50,334
Then they want to come to dinner.
Then they want to move in.

434
00:25:50,907 --> 00:25:54,673
Next thing you know, they're
married to your daughter.

435
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,676
- Why he got to bring it back here-
- Already made that mistake once.

436
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,068
- Come on, now.
- Honey.

437
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,105
No more, my brother.

438
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:05,471
Nobody makes a fool out of me.
I'm from Detroit.

439
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,998
- Everybody's here.
- I can't wait...

440
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:11,108
for everybody to
meet little Calvin.

441
00:26:11,907 --> 00:26:13,465
- I'm so excited.
- Yeah, yeah.

442
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,269
Introduce him to everybody else, and
go over to somebody else's house.

443
00:26:21,307 --> 00:26:22,899
Cookie got a little bite to it.

444
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,308
- Hi. Come in, come in, come in.
- Hello, hello, hello.

445
00:26:26,474 --> 00:26:30,103
- Hello, hello.
- I'm so excited.

446
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:31,502
- Hey.
- Hello.

447
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:35,701
- Consuela, welcome. Come in.
- So where is the little one?

448
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,668
- Here's Calvin.
- Here's Calvin.

449
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,174
- What a mess.
- Honey, that's not nice.

450
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,274
He's scary.

451
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:52,166
Yeah, well, I mean...

452
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:58,077
- I mean, lucky he's not yours, right?
- Yeah.

453
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,903
I iust think he is precious. I think
he is a precious gift from God.

454
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:04,838
You know, God gives gifts.

455
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:09,410
Sometimes he wraps them in a hurry. Sometimes.
Isn't he a precious gift?

456
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:12,908
Oh, yeah. He's adorable...

457
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,305
in a National
Geographic sort of way.

458
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:19,770
What is he, a pygmy?

459
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,470
Consuela, why don't you
take the kids to go play?

460
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,937
Yes, good idea. Come on, guys.

461
00:27:28,107 --> 00:27:30,735
Tommy, show Nicholas that
scissor-lock thing...

462
00:27:30,907 --> 00:27:32,397
we've been working on, huh?

463
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,203
Hey, little man. No
hard feelings, right?

464
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,571
Give me five.

465
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,606
Hey, guess what, Calvin?
We brought you some stuff.

466
00:27:51,774 --> 00:27:54,334
We got you some stuff. We got
a box full of bottles, bibs.

467
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,704
Oh, and all of the Dinosaurus Rex
tapes you could possibly want.

468
00:27:57,873 --> 00:27:59,637
Well, thank you.
That's a lot of stuff.

469
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:03,800
He is so cute. I got your nose.

470
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:07,171
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

471
00:28:09,507 --> 00:28:11,099
Oh, you got my nose.

472
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,505
You got my nose. Yes, you do.

473
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:18,605
He's got my nose. He's got my nose.
He's hurting-

474
00:28:18,774 --> 00:28:20,139
Darryl, he's hurting me.

475
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:22,798
- He's hurting me.
- Okay, okay, okay.

476
00:28:22,974 --> 00:28:24,839
Wow, is he strong.

477
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,908
Yeah, tell me about it. I
still can't feel my hand.

478
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,542
Okay, Darryl, I think you
should take the crib upstairs.

479
00:28:30,707 --> 00:28:33,005
- Yes.
- Ladies, will you help with this stuff?

480
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:34,402
Okay.

481
00:28:34,574 --> 00:28:36,633
- Guys, help me grab this.
- I'll get this box.

482
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:39,002
Let's go into the kitchen.
Come, Calvin.

483
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:42,041
- Come on, baby.
- Come on, little pumpkin-butt.

484
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:45,334
Janet, this fits perfectly.

485
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,206
- Thank you.
- Let me see.

486
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,737
I'm glad I kept it.

487
00:28:50,307 --> 00:28:53,105
Can't remember the last time I
could wear horizontal stripes.

488
00:28:54,074 --> 00:28:56,975
But, you know, here I go again.
How about you, woman of the hour?

489
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,973
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Oh, thank you.

490
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,506
It's awesome. Was Darryl
so excited or what?

491
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:06,838
No, actually. He
was disappointed.

492
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:09,237
Baby up-up.

493
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:14,643
He thought I was going to
tell him I was pregnant.

494
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:21,298
Okay, right.

495
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:23,237
Little Ms. Corporate-Climber
pregnant?

496
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:28,709
What? You guys. I want to
have a baby at some point.

497
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:32,571
You could schedule one between a
conference call and a client meeting.

498
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:37,670
Okay, you know, Darryl is the one
that I'm really worried about.

499
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,240
Are you kidding me? You're
lucky he wants one at all.

500
00:29:40,407 --> 00:29:42,307
I had to promise Greg
I'd give him these.

501
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,843
Okay, now. Okay, easy, fella.

502
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:54,476
This one's real grabby. He
must have been breast-fed.

503
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:56,939
Is the baby hungry?

504
00:29:57,407 --> 00:29:58,465
He should be nursed.

505
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,631
Baby like nursey-nursey.

506
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:03,572
Well, are you sure
you should do that?

507
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,368
Yeah. You don't have to be the
birth mother to breast-feed.

508
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,632
- Nursey-nursey?
- You want to nursey?

509
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:14,507
Okay.

510
00:30:18,574 --> 00:30:19,939
All right.

511
00:30:20,673 --> 00:30:24,405
- Drink up, precious.
- This one's real wriggly, huh?

512
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:27,668
Come on. Come on, now. Suck it.

513
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,607
Latch-Oh, that is not okay.

514
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:35,769
Let's get these kids home.

515
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,636
I have to take Nicholas and
Chrissy to Mommy and Me tomorrow.

516
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:40,104
Oh, have fun.

517
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:43,368
Don't worry about the nose.
He's adorable.

518
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,373
- Thanks for all the stuff.
- Call if you need anything.

519
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,007
- Bye, good night.
- Good night.

520
00:30:48,173 --> 00:30:50,904
If you change your mind about
Consuela, you can take her.

521
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:53,133
- Oh, thanks.
- I've got, like, all the chores.

522
00:30:53,307 --> 00:30:54,968
One for you...

523
00:30:56,307 --> 00:30:58,298
and one for the baby.

524
00:31:16,907 --> 00:31:18,704
He's a little charmer, isn't he?

525
00:31:18,907 --> 00:31:21,137
Call me.

526
00:31:23,307 --> 00:31:25,798
I could have sworn he iust
stuck his tongue in my mouth.

527
00:31:35,007 --> 00:31:37,305
- Well, I-That was-I thought-
- That went well.

528
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:39,635
- Yeah.
- I thought they thought he was cute.

529
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:42,367
Great. You're wonder-Oh,
Calvin, you did so good.

530
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,599
- Come on. Yeah.
- You did so well.

531
00:31:44,774 --> 00:31:47,709
If that lady touches you in a way
that makes you uncomfortable...

532
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:49,364
you let us know, okay?

533
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,901
- Yeah. You're the charmer.
- Yeah.

534
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:56,137
Does that warm water feel good?
Does it feel nice?

535
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:58,502
Yeah. Look at you.

536
00:31:58,673 --> 00:32:02,303
Do you want some company
in there with you?

537
00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:03,771
I think we can work that out.

538
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,036
Yeah? Yeah?

539
00:32:07,207 --> 00:32:08,572
Hey, Darryl?

540
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,800
Hello. It's bath time.

541
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:16,632
Come on, let's get clean.

542
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:20,542
We gonna clean your little butt-butt.
Yes, we are.

543
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:22,538
And then we gonna play
Snatch the Marbles.

544
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,140
We're gonna fart in the tub...

545
00:32:24,307 --> 00:32:27,435
and make our own little
Jacuzzi bubbles.

546
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:36,008
Oh, the little baby. Yes,
you're so clean now.

547
00:32:36,173 --> 00:32:37,607
You're so nice and clean.

548
00:32:42,373 --> 00:32:45,241
Hey. Okay-Calvin.

549
00:32:45,407 --> 00:32:47,637
Okay, Calvin.

550
00:32:48,873 --> 00:32:50,341
Okay. Hey, Darryl?

551
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:53,635
- All right, sweetie.
- Hello, little boy.

552
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:55,468
Hi, cutie.

553
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,870
Now it's time to get you
all dressed for bed, huh?

554
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,838
Don't forget the doctor said we
need to take his temperature.

555
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:02,531
Okay.

556
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,968
- Yeah.
- All right.

557
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,607
Open up wide.

558
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:08,641
- Darryl, what are you doing?
- I'm taking his temperature.

559
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:12,334
Sweetie, he's a baby, so
that's a rectal thermometer.

560
00:33:13,874 --> 00:33:15,171
Yeah. Go ahead.

561
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,568
- You're such a-
- Okay, baby.

562
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,765
All right. Here we go. There we-

563
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:21,737
- Oh, shit.
- Darryl, what are you doing?

564
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:24,803
Darryl, come on. Darryl, iust-

565
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:27,272
- I'm trying to-
- Honey.

566
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,340
It's okay, Calvin. It's okay.

567
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,771
- If he'll iust roll over here.
- Okay, good, good.

568
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,635
- I could get him down like-
- No, no.

569
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:37,140
- Wait, be gentle. Calvin, it's okay.
- He's a little strong.

570
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,470
Okay, all right. Nobody
likes this, I know.

571
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,131
I know, nobody-Nobody
likes this.

572
00:33:43,307 --> 00:33:47,300
It's okay. It's okay. Oh, yeah.
There we go, son.

573
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:51,205
- Here comes the choo-choo train.
- You're okay, baby. Oh, yeah.

574
00:33:56,907 --> 00:34:01,401
It's in the tunnel, son.
It's almost at your stop.

575
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,201
There you go, little man.

576
00:34:08,574 --> 00:34:12,374
Now, this is gonna
put you to sleep.

577
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,932
All right, little buddy.

578
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,136
Good night, baby.

579
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,675
Like this thing's gonna
put somebody to sleep.

580
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:35,242
I'm gonna wait for
you to go to sleep.

581
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,875
I'm gonna get my
diamond and be out.

582
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,733
Come on, baby, be in here.
Come on.

583
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,602
Come on.

584
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,833
Come on, where you at?
Where you at?

585
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:18,565
There we go.

586
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,443
Hi, beautiful. Yes.

587
00:36:39,974 --> 00:36:42,670
Man, this idiot better
pick up the phone.

588
00:36:57,207 --> 00:36:59,607
People calling here
all kind of time.

589
00:36:59,773 --> 00:37:03,608
Like people don't live here. I mean,
you can't be calling nobody house...

590
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:08,503
P- Unit Productions, in association
with Go Get a Girl Entertainment.

591
00:37:08,673 --> 00:37:11,006
- Hey, yo, Percy. It's me.
- Calvin?

592
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:14,109
- What's going on?
- I need you to come pick me up.

593
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:17,141
- Now, look, I got the dia-
- Reach for the sky.

594
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,335
Who you talking to, sonny boy?

595
00:37:25,507 --> 00:37:28,169
Oh, don't give me that old...
crap.

596
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,671
Hand me that damn phone.

597
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,703
- Who is this?
- Me no speak no English.

598
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:34,136
Wrong number. Sorry.

599
00:37:34,307 --> 00:37:36,969
Who the hell's "No speak the English"?
Who the hell is this?

600
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,903
- Say something.
- What are you doing?

601
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:41,372
I heard some noises,
came downstairs...

602
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,599
and caught this little
hoodlum on the phone.

603
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:46,299
- Must've looked for the safe.
- We don't have a safe.

604
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:49,238
- He didn't know that.
- Dada.

605
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,142
Pop, man. He's a baby.

606
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:57,174
It's his first night in a new house.
Probably couldn't sleep.

607
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,401
Look at you. You look crazy, man.
Holding a shotgun, wearing red socks.

608
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:04,702
You look like Fred Sanford on crack.
Put that away, man. Go to bed.

609
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:07,104
Oh, you are good.

610
00:38:07,273 --> 00:38:09,139
You are real good.

611
00:38:09,307 --> 00:38:11,502
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

612
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,464
You gonna give me the finger?

613
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,098
Where did you learn that, huh?
BET videos _fter Dark?

614
00:38:19,974 --> 00:38:21,236
Him scary.

615
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:23,102
There we go.

616
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:26,437
Don't pay him any mind.
He just a old, crazy man.

617
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:30,168
I know iust what to fix you so you
can have a good night's sleep.

618
00:38:44,207 --> 00:38:47,142
Go. Boy, you must have
had a rough first night.

619
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:50,666
That's because I'm new
at this dad stuff.

620
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,468
Give me a minute,
I'll get it together.

621
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,641
Man, can't imagine what kind
of life you must have had.

622
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:02,702
I'll tell you this:

623
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,434
This weekend is gonna be the
best weekend of your life.

624
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:06,835
You know why?

625
00:39:07,007 --> 00:39:09,908
Because I'm gonna show you how
great it is to have a dad...

626
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:13,771
and you're gonna show me how
great it is to be a dad.

627
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:17,843
Vanessa don't think I can do
it, but I know I got it in me.

628
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:20,840
You know why? Because I would
never abandon my child.

629
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,671
Ever. I'll always
be there for him.

630
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,032
And there'll never be a time
when my son can't come to me...

631
00:39:29,207 --> 00:39:31,573
and talk to me about
anything in the world...

632
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,676
over a nice, warm cup of milk.

633
00:39:45,307 --> 00:39:47,969
What's so funny? What
are you all giggly for?

634
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,765
You're drinking
Janet's breast milk.

635
00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:58,276
Baby, you did the right thing, letting
him stay with us this weekend.

636
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,571
Thank you.

637
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:07,009
But you know, I still can't wait
for us to have one of our own.

638
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:12,070
- Yes, I know.
- All right.

639
00:40:13,173 --> 00:40:15,938
You wanna know the nice thing
about you not being pregnant?

640
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,964
What?

641
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,299
We get to keep trying.

642
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:33,667
Honey? What about the baby?

643
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,638
He's asleep, don't worry about him.
You've got me.

644
00:40:36,807 --> 00:40:38,604
But, honey...

645
00:40:40,574 --> 00:40:42,337
he's watching.

646
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:48,402
He's too young to know what's going on.
Forget him.

647
00:40:51,974 --> 00:40:53,373
Okay.

648
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,435
Okay.

649
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,498
Good morning.

650
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:17,108
More like, great morning.

651
00:41:17,273 --> 00:41:20,675
Looks like someone had a really
good night's sleep last night.

652
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,267
Who could sleep?

653
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,603
- You were an animal last night.
- Oh, well, you know-

654
00:41:26,773 --> 00:41:30,574
I don't remember the last time
we did it twice in one night.

655
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,207
Twice?

656
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:36,274
Hey, when did he get in the bed?

657
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:41,340
I don't know. I don't know how
he gets out of that crib.

658
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:43,134
He's such a crafty little fella.

659
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,401
You want some breakfast?

660
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:51,007
Some more ass.

661
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,905
Twice?

662
00:42:13,474 --> 00:42:16,602
- How's my baby girl this morning?
- So good, Dad.

663
00:42:16,773 --> 00:42:19,174
- How are you?
- Mighty fine, thank you.

664
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,807
No, no, no.

665
00:42:20,974 --> 00:42:23,340
Thanks very much, Jim.
And in other news...

666
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:26,442
police have a suspect in
yesterday's daring diamond heist.

667
00:42:26,607 --> 00:42:29,269
It is this man, Calvin
"Baby Face" Sims...

668
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,635
- ...who was released-
- D. Rex, D. Rex, D. Rex.

669
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,672
Stop that, whatever
you're talking about.

670
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,604
D. Rex, D. Rex, D. Rex.

671
00:42:36,773 --> 00:42:38,002
Just be quiet.

672
00:42:38,374 --> 00:42:40,001
- D. Rex.
- Baby Face-

673
00:42:40,273 --> 00:42:43,334
Dad, let Calvin watch his show.

674
00:42:43,707 --> 00:42:47,108
You have to be the adult.
Let Calvin watch his tape.

675
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,175
- I wanna watch the news.
- I don't care what you wanna watch.

676
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,934
He was watching the TV first.

677
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:54,574
I'll read the news.

678
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,177
I tell you, the world is
going to hell in a handcart.

679
00:43:35,374 --> 00:43:38,309
Wow, Dad, you really
cleaned your plate.

680
00:43:38,474 --> 00:43:40,772
What? That hobgoblin
ate my breakfast.

681
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,831
Oh, Daddy, don't be ridiculous.

682
00:43:44,007 --> 00:43:47,135
I ain't being ridiculous. That
little sucker ate my breakfast.

683
00:43:47,307 --> 00:43:50,834
I'm going to the diner, where I can
eat and watch the news in peace.

684
00:43:51,107 --> 00:43:54,599
Okay, Dad. Be careful.

685
00:43:54,773 --> 00:43:58,608
Why don't we get you some food?
You must be so hungry.

686
00:43:58,773 --> 00:44:01,242
It's time for you
to eat something.

687
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:04,765
- Morning, sweetie.
- Oh, good morning, baby.

688
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,237
Hello.

689
00:44:06,407 --> 00:44:09,399
- I have your breakfast right here.
- Oh, goodie.

690
00:44:10,974 --> 00:44:14,671
Oh, sweetie, okay, now your
dad is really tripping.

691
00:44:15,107 --> 00:44:18,599
Last night, I caught him holding
little Calvin at gunpoint...

692
00:44:18,773 --> 00:44:21,265
because he heard him
talking on the phone.

693
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,337
That is-That's crazy.

694
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,268
Well, you know...

695
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:31,468
iust now he ate all of his breakfast,
and then he told me the baby ate it.

696
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:35,575
- Can you say, "Whispering Glen"?
- No, Darryl.

697
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,139
No nursing homes, okay?

698
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,741
I don't wanna have this
conversation with you again.

699
00:44:39,907 --> 00:44:42,603
I have to go to work, but
the baby's food is here.

700
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:44,901
- And I love you.
- I love you too.

701
00:44:45,074 --> 00:44:48,441
Have a good day. Kiss. Feed him.

702
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,169
All right.

703
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:56,706
Okay, okay, let's
get you all fed.

704
00:44:56,874 --> 00:45:01,971
All right. Open up wide.
Here come the airplane.

705
00:45:07,974 --> 00:45:09,771
Oh, I see.

706
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,101
You want to play a
game of peekaboo, huh?

707
00:45:12,273 --> 00:45:14,265
Okay, okay, okay.

708
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,067
Peekaboo, I see you.

709
00:45:19,307 --> 00:45:21,571
Peekaboo, I see you.

710
00:45:37,474 --> 00:45:40,637
You gotta be kidding me. God.

711
00:45:47,807 --> 00:45:49,399
Darryl?

712
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,335
Where did I put it?

713
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,001
Honey, I forgot my purse.

714
00:46:01,907 --> 00:46:03,898
Darryl. Darryl.

715
00:46:04,307 --> 00:46:07,674
Sweetheart. You can't just
fall asleep like this.

716
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,906
Oh, honey, I know that you're tired,
but you have to watch the baby.

717
00:46:12,074 --> 00:46:15,134
You take your eyes off him for a
minute, God knows what could happen.

718
00:46:15,307 --> 00:46:16,797
I was...

719
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,231
- Darryl.
- I was...

720
00:46:20,407 --> 00:46:22,272
- What...?
- I don't-

721
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,342
Honey, iust take him to the
park or something, okay?

722
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,071
Okay.

723
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,971
What...?

724
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,939
Peekaboo. Then I don't-What?

725
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:49,735
We gonna play baseball.
We gonna play football.

726
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,808
And we're gonna play golf.

727
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,041
And we're gonna shoot a plane.

728
00:46:56,207 --> 00:46:58,675
We're gonna have fun.

729
00:47:02,374 --> 00:47:04,035
There we go.

730
00:47:04,207 --> 00:47:07,643
All right, son. Now, don't be afraid
to really swing that bat, okay?

731
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:11,072
Now, the trick is to really keep
your eye on the ball, okay?

732
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,764
Here we go.

733
00:47:17,974 --> 00:47:20,602
Yeah, you want that
sucker to really fly.

734
00:47:20,773 --> 00:47:22,901
You wanna give that thing
a lot of air, okay?

735
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:24,769
There you go. Give
it some good pump.

736
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,500
You want it to really fly.
You want it to blast off.

737
00:47:27,673 --> 00:47:31,166
Yeah, there you go. No, no, no.
You want to point that up.

738
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,605
No. No, no, son. What are you-? No, no, no.
Don't push that button.

739
00:47:37,907 --> 00:47:41,104
Okay, so now, what you wanna do
is you wanna wind that baby up...

740
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:43,299
and you throw it as
hard as you can, okay?

741
00:47:43,474 --> 00:47:45,066
- Okay.
- All right. Come on.

742
00:47:50,074 --> 00:47:52,508
Look at that. Yeah.

743
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,338
Yeah. Look at that sucker.

744
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,171
Where'd it go?

745
00:48:10,107 --> 00:48:11,904
The ducks teach you playfulness.

746
00:48:12,074 --> 00:48:14,770
Here, you can borrow this if you want.
He'd love it.

747
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,965
Hey, Dad-For-A-Weekend.

748
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:18,835
How's it going?

749
00:48:19,007 --> 00:48:21,942
I think they designed all the
toys to hit you in the nuts.

750
00:48:22,507 --> 00:48:23,906
Oh, yeah.

751
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,729
Get off.

752
00:48:25,907 --> 00:48:29,070
Richard, I bet my son could kick
the crap out of both your kids...

753
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,902
blindfolded, one hand
tied behind his back.

754
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:35,532
Come on, Greg. Nicholas is
a sweet, sensitive kid.

755
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:37,732
He's not a fighter.

756
00:48:37,907 --> 00:48:40,933
I'm telling you, Darryl, see, you
gotta be tough on kids nowadays.

757
00:48:41,107 --> 00:48:44,565
All right, the slightest bit of
weakness and they could end up...

758
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,440
like that.

759
00:48:48,607 --> 00:48:51,542
Well, I don't know about all that,
but I gotta be honest with you.

760
00:48:51,707 --> 00:48:54,767
I'm starting to dig this father thing.
It's kind of cool.

761
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,671
It's kind of like I get to do all the
things that I never did with my dad.

762
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,671
- You know?
- That's real cute.

763
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:04,404
Really, I think I'm having a
positive influence on him.

764
00:49:05,907 --> 00:49:08,307
Cee-lo, that's right. Dig
up in your OshKosh...

765
00:49:08,474 --> 00:49:09,941
your babyGap and pay the man.

766
00:49:10,107 --> 00:49:13,304
- That's right. Yeah.
- It's not fair.

767
00:49:13,474 --> 00:49:15,135
Come on, put your
money in the pot.

768
00:49:15,307 --> 00:49:17,070
Whine to your mama,
don't whine to me.

769
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,571
Right, good game, good game.

770
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,230
Come here, you guys. Come here.

771
00:49:21,773 --> 00:49:23,935
Yo, y'all bring your
money tomorrow...

772
00:49:24,107 --> 00:49:26,974
I'm gonna sell y'all some
pictures of some naked girls.

773
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,302
What I say? Y'all don't
like big breasts?

774
00:49:31,474 --> 00:49:33,101
Daddy, can I have
some ice cream?

775
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:34,673
Sure, sweetie. What flavor?

776
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,432
- Vanilla.
- You got it.

777
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:38,074
- I think we'll go with you.
- Okay.

778
00:49:39,307 --> 00:49:41,298
- You're getting big.
- Janet, do me a favor?

779
00:49:42,474 --> 00:49:44,840
- Could you watch Calvin for me?
- No problem.

780
00:49:45,907 --> 00:49:47,340
Calvin.

781
00:49:47,507 --> 00:49:48,769
Percy.

782
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:53,176
- Cal, you get the diamond?
- Yeah, it's in the diaper bag. Come on.

783
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,500
Hold hands.

784
00:49:54,673 --> 00:49:57,199
Cal, which one is it?

785
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,403
The one with the duck on it.

786
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:04,836
- They all got ducks on them.
- I think it's that one.

787
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,001
Come on.

788
00:50:07,773 --> 00:50:09,799
Hey, that guy's not
even here with a child.

789
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:11,441
Hey.

790
00:50:12,773 --> 00:50:15,265
Hey, get away from him.
Girls, let's get him!

791
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,931
- I'm out.
- There he is.

792
00:50:19,507 --> 00:50:21,737
Pumpkin, are you okay?

793
00:50:22,173 --> 00:50:23,801
- Did he touch you anywhere?
- No.

794
00:50:23,974 --> 00:50:26,135
No? Okay. Good.

795
00:50:26,307 --> 00:50:28,502
- Hey, is everything okay, Janet?
- It's not okay.

796
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:31,336
Some sick pervert tried to run
away with this little guy.

797
00:50:31,507 --> 00:50:33,441
Hey, that psycho
took my diaper bag.

798
00:50:33,607 --> 00:50:35,666
- What?
- Damn.

799
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,501
Pervert.

800
00:50:40,007 --> 00:50:43,773
Okay, we gonna get you home where
it's nice and safe, all right?

801
00:50:47,474 --> 00:50:50,170
Keys, keys. I want the keys.

802
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:54,673
Keys, keys, I want keys.
Keys. Keys. Keys.

803
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,967
No, no, no. Daddy needs
these to drive the-

804
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,664
- Keys.
- Oh, God.

805
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,569
Keys. Give me the keys.

806
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,734
- Oh, no. Here. Take that.
- No. Keys.

807
00:51:03,907 --> 00:51:05,807
- I want keys.
- Play with that for a while.

808
00:51:05,974 --> 00:51:08,306
- No, no, no. I need these.
- I want keys.

809
00:51:09,173 --> 00:51:10,573
- Want keys.
- Okay, here.

810
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,768
- Keys.
- All right, all right.

811
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,876
All right, you wait right there,
and I'll be right back, okay?

812
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:25,068
Hey!

813
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,673
My car. My kid.

814
00:51:27,974 --> 00:51:30,636
Hey, stop!

815
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:38,732
Someone iust stole my
car with my kid in it.

816
00:51:38,907 --> 00:51:40,169
Hop in.

817
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,606
- Thank you.
- Let's go get that son of a bitch.

818
00:51:54,007 --> 00:51:55,440
Damn.

819
00:52:07,474 --> 00:52:10,170
Man, my wife is gonna kill me
when she finds out about this.

820
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,171
My advice to you is
don't tell her a word.

821
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,171
I left Bobby Jr. At
an amusement park.

822
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,808
Told his father he was at summer camp.
Bought me a week.

823
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:25,034
Hello? I'm on my way. I'll be
there in about five minutes.

824
00:52:25,207 --> 00:52:27,641
I have the cupcakes. Yes.

825
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:29,638
I didn't bring iuice.
You didn't tell me.

826
00:52:29,807 --> 00:52:32,401
- Don't talk to me that way.
- Excuse me.

827
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,667
- I'm hanging up.
- Oh, my God.

828
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,671
I'm hanging up. I'm hanging up.

829
00:52:38,307 --> 00:52:40,400
Watch the road, moron.

830
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,472
Come on, baby. Let's go.
Let's do this.

831
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,841
Oh, wow, you are really upset.

832
00:52:55,007 --> 00:52:58,670
It makes me feel so good to know that
there are people out there who care...

833
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,933
- Mommy, Mommy...
- ... about their kids-What?

834
00:53:01,107 --> 00:53:02,096
As I do.

835
00:53:02,273 --> 00:53:04,208
- Mommy, Mommy.
- Just one second, honey.

836
00:53:04,374 --> 00:53:07,400
I'm fixing my makeup.

837
00:53:07,574 --> 00:53:09,735
- Mom.
- What?

838
00:53:09,907 --> 00:53:12,137
I think Dillon did a doodie.

839
00:53:12,307 --> 00:53:15,003
- Mom, hurry up. Come on, hurry.
- Change him.

840
00:53:15,173 --> 00:53:18,109
Oh, wait, no. Wait.

841
00:53:19,574 --> 00:53:22,270
Oh, my God. Excuse me. A truck.

842
00:53:22,474 --> 00:53:24,806
Excuse me. A truck.

843
00:53:24,974 --> 00:53:26,942
There you go. Can you
hand me the powder?

844
00:53:27,107 --> 00:53:28,597
What? No, stop.

845
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,232
We're gonna die.

846
00:53:38,074 --> 00:53:40,099
Oh, my God.

847
00:53:40,273 --> 00:53:42,469
Don't worry. You'll get
your little boy back.

848
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,507
It ain't worth it. Let me out.

849
00:53:52,007 --> 00:53:53,269
Oh, no.

850
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:12,501
- Suspect got away.
- Damn it!

851
00:54:13,407 --> 00:54:17,901
- But the kid's okay.
- I want my daddy.

852
00:54:19,273 --> 00:54:23,472
I want Daddy. I want my daddy.

853
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,540
Thanks for everything.

854
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,333
Oh, by the way, I
run a carpool...

855
00:54:29,507 --> 00:54:32,499
if the little one ever
needs a ride to preschool.

856
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,503
- Daddy.
- That's my kid.

857
00:54:34,773 --> 00:54:36,969
Daddy. Daddy.

858
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,576
- Are you okay, huh?
- Daddy.

859
00:54:40,874 --> 00:54:45,140
- Son's okay, but car's totaled.
- Screw the car. Long as he's okay.

860
00:54:45,307 --> 00:54:48,242
I'm sorry, man. I'm
sorry, little buddy.

861
00:54:48,407 --> 00:54:51,001
I would never want
anything to happen to you.

862
00:54:51,173 --> 00:54:53,039
I love you, man.

863
00:54:55,807 --> 00:54:57,399
- Mr. W.
- Yeah.

864
00:54:57,574 --> 00:55:00,509
Your boy came through. I got it.

865
00:55:02,807 --> 00:55:05,298
Bring it to me. Watch
my drink, babe.

866
00:55:20,673 --> 00:55:24,633
Keep looking. Keep digging in there. It's in there.
It's in there, baby.

867
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,505
Look around in there.

868
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,270
Mr. Dub, could you
dig deeper in there?

869
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,737
Damn.

870
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:36,637
Is that a dirty diaper?

871
00:55:37,907 --> 00:55:41,274
- Did I iust touch a dirty diaper?
- Wait a minute.

872
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,704
Whoa, that baby had
lasagna last night.

873
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:46,308
I know it's in here.
The diamond's in here.

874
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:50,240
- He said the diamond's in there.
- Your 24 hours are up, Percy.

875
00:55:54,874 --> 00:55:56,899
And you haven't
delivered my diamond.

876
00:55:57,074 --> 00:55:59,235
Do you know how
that makes me feel?

877
00:56:00,507 --> 00:56:03,840
Please, Mr. Dub, give me a little more time.
I promise I'll get the rock.

878
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:06,567
It makes me feel like wanting
to hurt you very badly.

879
00:56:07,107 --> 00:56:08,904
But I won't.

880
00:56:09,507 --> 00:56:12,635
Because that diamond means
more to me than your life.

881
00:56:12,974 --> 00:56:15,238
Now, you get out of here
and find me that diamond.

882
00:56:18,273 --> 00:56:21,869
- Get out of here.
- I promise you, okay? I got you.

883
00:56:23,207 --> 00:56:25,641
Follow him. Find his partner.

884
00:56:25,807 --> 00:56:29,334
Get me my diamond, then stick
them both in the ground.

885
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,067
Aren't you taking
this a bit far?

886
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,765
I didn't even know they
made a LoJack for kids.

887
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:38,569
No, I'm telling you, I'm not taking any chances.
This guy's tricky.

888
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,105
Maybe I should skip the game.

889
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:44,335
Are you crazy? They're
playing Detroit, D.

890
00:56:44,907 --> 00:56:48,775
Why don't we pack up the little ugly
son of a bitch and take him with us?

891
00:56:51,773 --> 00:56:53,639
You really think
that's the best idea?

892
00:56:53,807 --> 00:56:56,139
Yeah, Richard, I do think
it's the best idea.

893
00:56:56,307 --> 00:56:58,639
It's never too early to
become a Chicago fan.

894
00:57:00,574 --> 00:57:03,839
- You know what, I'm in.
- Yeah. Come on, let's go.

895
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:07,568
Okay, but when the ladies ask,
I was the one that said no.

896
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:08,968
I- No.

897
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,808
Are you ready to see how
exciting a hockey game is?

898
00:57:17,974 --> 00:57:19,271
It's like boxing on ice.

899
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,931
Five rows up behind the penalty box.
Who the man?

900
00:57:22,107 --> 00:57:23,597
- Yeah, boy. Yeah.
- That's right.

901
00:57:28,307 --> 00:57:31,071
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

902
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,675
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, what are you watching?

903
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:39,137
Did you see that play? Hey.

904
00:57:39,307 --> 00:57:41,400
What you got in your mouth
there, little fella?

905
00:57:42,107 --> 00:57:45,474
What you got in your mouth? Open up.
Open. Let me see.

906
00:57:46,207 --> 00:57:48,141
Oh, okay, it was nothing.

907
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:50,241
Come on.

908
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,529
T Man!

909
00:57:53,707 --> 00:57:55,675
- Come on.
- Here we go.

910
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:57,536
Yeah.

911
00:58:00,173 --> 00:58:01,732
Yeah.

912
00:58:05,874 --> 00:58:08,468
- All right, who needs drinks?
- I'm good.

913
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:14,340
Oh, wait. Yeah, I guess I
need another one, please.

914
00:58:16,074 --> 00:58:17,302
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

915
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,031
How about you guys?
Anything to drink?

916
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:23,005
- Yeah, I'll grab a beer, sure.
- Me too, me too. Get me one.

917
00:58:23,673 --> 00:58:26,165
- There you go.
- Thank you.

918
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:29,867
- Okay. Here you go.
- Nice ass.

919
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,005
Pig.

920
00:58:35,173 --> 00:58:36,903
Tramp.

921
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:51,176
What the hell was that for?

922
00:58:51,707 --> 00:58:53,572
- What did I do?
- You know her?

923
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,173
No, I don't know her.

924
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,737
I don't know-I don't.

925
00:58:57,907 --> 00:58:59,602
- Hey, man. Get your own.
- Hey.

926
00:58:59,907 --> 00:59:01,499
- What?
- Beer. It's empty.

927
00:59:01,673 --> 00:59:04,074
- So get another one.
- I'm gonna-

928
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,333
- Get off. Wait.
- What's your problem, man?

929
00:59:07,407 --> 00:59:09,739
- Come on, man. Come on, Miller.
- Miller.

930
00:59:12,773 --> 00:59:14,742
You suck.

931
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:20,137
- You suck, man. You suck.
- Shut it, you losers!

932
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:23,276
Want some of me? Come down here.
Come play with the big boys.

933
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,671
- You're a bully. You're a bully, man.
- Yeah, I thought so, you princess.

934
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,638
- Come on, you.
- Pick on somebody your own size.

935
00:59:29,807 --> 00:59:31,798
Come on down here, then.

936
00:59:35,407 --> 00:59:37,102
Who did that?

937
00:59:39,773 --> 00:59:42,436
You. You're dead!

938
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,807
He's gonna kill me.

939
00:59:48,007 --> 00:59:50,771
- Get out of my way.
- It wasn't me. It was the baby.

940
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,407
- You're mine.
- Get him.

941
00:59:52,574 --> 00:59:54,007
Hockey fight!

942
01:00:00,307 --> 01:00:03,333
He's got my ear. Get
this baby off of me.

943
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,742
- Hey. Hey, hey.
- Is that all you got?

944
01:00:15,874 --> 01:00:17,341
I don't know, baby.

945
01:00:17,507 --> 01:00:20,374
Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm
not ready to be a dad yet.

946
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:23,202
It really wasn't your fault.

947
01:00:23,507 --> 01:00:25,566
It's so funny, man. It
just happened so fast.

948
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,605
I took my eyes off him
for one second and:

949
01:00:27,773 --> 01:00:29,833
He would've never had
another birthday again.

950
01:00:32,173 --> 01:00:35,109
Hey. Why don't we do that?

951
01:00:35,273 --> 01:00:37,003
Why don't we throw him
a birthday party?

952
01:00:37,173 --> 01:00:39,642
Well, we don't know
when his birthday is.

953
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,434
So what? We'll
celebrate it tomorrow.

954
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:45,134
We'll throw him a big birthday bash. The
biggest birthday party he ever had.

955
01:00:45,307 --> 01:00:47,275
That is a really good idea.

956
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,576
And I got a little
surprise for him.

957
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,799
Does everyone know
what time it is?

958
01:00:53,974 --> 01:00:58,809
It's time to dance and sing,
and have lots and lots of fun.

959
01:00:58,974 --> 01:01:01,636
Hey there, boys and girls,
it's Dinosaur Rex...

960
01:01:01,807 --> 01:01:03,832
your favorite prehistoric pal.

961
01:01:04,007 --> 01:01:06,100
Now, where's the birthday boy?

962
01:01:06,273 --> 01:01:07,798
- There.
- Yo, no, no.

963
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,167
- Happy birthday.
- Hey, yo.

964
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,637
Happy birthday, little buddy

965
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,001
I got a nasty hangover...

966
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:14,937
and a rock stuck in my gut...

967
01:01:15,107 --> 01:01:17,507
that got my colon backed
up like rush-hour traffic.

968
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:20,268
Now, either you're gonna stop
with your fruity kid songs...

969
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,806
or I'm gonna kick you right
in your furry balls.

970
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,274
- All right?
- Well...

971
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,635
maybe we should
talk about manners.

972
01:01:27,807 --> 01:01:29,741
Now, manners are very important.

973
01:01:29,907 --> 01:01:33,843
When I was a tiny lizard, my mom told
me that if I had good manners...

974
01:01:34,007 --> 01:01:38,671
one day I could grow up to be
president of the whole United States.

975
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,206
But instead, you entertain
snotty-nosed kids...

976
01:01:41,374 --> 01:01:43,035
in a crusty, blue
dinosaur suit...

977
01:01:43,207 --> 01:01:46,540
that smell like sweaty
armpits and baby urine.

978
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:49,274
Far cry from president, buddy.

979
01:01:53,273 --> 01:01:55,435
I iust got out of rehab.

980
01:01:55,607 --> 01:01:57,768
Because of the new
"deadbeat dad" law...

981
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:01,899
my wife's garnishing 85
percent of my dinosaur wages.

982
01:02:02,074 --> 01:02:05,976
So if I weren't afraid to lose
this iob, I'd kick your ass.

983
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:09,405
Oh, you so pathetic you need
$4.50 an hour that bad?

984
01:02:09,574 --> 01:02:11,405
Come on, get your ass kicked.

985
01:02:15,407 --> 01:02:17,500
- Bring it on.
- Come on. Come on, then.

986
01:02:18,574 --> 01:02:21,668
- Hey.
- Oh, you mine now. You mine.

987
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,773
Get him, get him, get him.

988
01:02:29,107 --> 01:02:30,768
You little bastard.

989
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,672
That was a cheap shot.

990
01:02:37,673 --> 01:02:41,007
- You stink.
- I hate your show.

991
01:02:41,173 --> 01:02:43,836
It has been confirmed, the
driver of the stolen vehicle...

992
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:47,534
matches the description of the
suspect in Friday's diamond heist.

993
01:02:47,707 --> 01:02:50,073
- Police are looking to question...
- I knew it.

994
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,730
Calvin "Baby Face" Sims.

995
01:02:51,907 --> 01:02:55,308
Sims, who was recently released from
state prison, has thus far eluded-

996
01:02:55,474 --> 01:02:57,669
Hey, guys, what do you say
we liven this party up?

997
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,671
We have a little
father-son football game.

998
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,832
Football? Greg, I don't know. I
don't think that's a good idea.

999
01:03:03,007 --> 01:03:05,737
Nicholas is a little young
and small for football.

1000
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,432
How about Simon Says instead?

1001
01:03:08,673 --> 01:03:11,438
You know, Richard, your son
practically squats to pee.

1002
01:03:12,007 --> 01:03:14,771
Come on, man. Look, we gotta
scar these kids for life.

1003
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,771
All right? We gotta
toughen them up a bit.

1004
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,339
You don't-

1005
01:03:18,974 --> 01:03:19,963
- Come on.
- Come on.

1006
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,404
Darryl, you in, or does
Calvin have ballet class?

1007
01:03:22,574 --> 01:03:23,666
I'm down.

1008
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,801
- All right.
- All right, let's do it.

1009
01:03:28,773 --> 01:03:31,743
Football? That's not in the books.
I've read all the books.

1010
01:03:31,907 --> 01:03:34,432
Yeah, you're wetting yourself here.
Go play football.

1011
01:03:34,607 --> 01:03:36,234
- You sure?
- Rich, let's go.

1012
01:03:36,407 --> 01:03:40,070
- It's 7-O already.
- All right. I'm playing football.

1013
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,299
Take off the sli-Oh, my God.

1014
01:03:42,474 --> 01:03:44,704
Whoa, here we go.

1015
01:03:44,874 --> 01:03:47,968
P- U-T-I-T-I-N Put it in.

1016
01:03:48,173 --> 01:03:51,337
P- U-T-I-T-I-N Put it in.

1017
01:03:52,707 --> 01:03:56,302
You and me, this is father-son stuff.
Right here, huh? Here we go.

1018
01:03:56,474 --> 01:03:59,932
- Ready, set...
- I love you, baby.

1019
01:04:00,107 --> 01:04:01,768
Hike.

1020
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,999
One Victoria's Secret. Two-

1021
01:04:05,173 --> 01:04:06,732
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

1022
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:09,273
You want the hospital
or the graveyard, punk?

1023
01:04:09,773 --> 01:04:10,934
Yeah.

1024
01:04:11,107 --> 01:04:12,904
- Here we go.
- Are you okay?

1025
01:04:13,074 --> 01:04:15,907
- I thought this was a touch game.
- You have his license number?

1026
01:04:16,074 --> 01:04:18,474
- What is he doing?
- Sorry, D, did I hurt your vagina?

1027
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,542
Our team is what? Dynamite
Our team is what? Dynamite.

1028
01:04:22,707 --> 01:04:24,504
- What's going on?
- Our team is.

1029
01:04:25,707 --> 01:04:26,731
Dynamite.

1030
01:04:26,907 --> 01:04:28,067
Break.

1031
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,237
Run, Dad.

1032
01:04:35,407 --> 01:04:37,068
Nicholas, are you okay?

1033
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,105
Game on.

1034
01:04:39,307 --> 01:04:42,606
- Just stay down, son.
- Thattaboy. You did it.

1035
01:04:43,207 --> 01:04:45,971
Now, that's why we put
creatine in our corn flakes.

1036
01:04:46,607 --> 01:04:48,905
- You okay?
- Punch him, kick him.

1037
01:04:49,074 --> 01:04:51,508
Stick him in the eye.

1038
01:04:53,007 --> 01:04:54,998
Here we go, here we go.

1039
01:04:55,173 --> 01:04:57,301
All right, here we go.
Come on, boys.

1040
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:06,268
- Yeah.
- Your husband is a brute.

1041
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,067
- That's right.
- Yo, Greg, man.

1042
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,901
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

1043
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:12,474
Hey, what are you doing, Greg?
Man, he's a kid.

1044
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,438
Hey, Darryl, Darryl.
Shut your pie-hole, man!

1045
01:05:15,607 --> 01:05:18,337
- It's football. It's football.
- I know.

1046
01:05:18,507 --> 01:05:20,907
- Stop acting like a bitch.
- Why you starting, man?

1047
01:05:21,074 --> 01:05:24,305
Come on, let's go. Man, come on.
You guys suck.

1048
01:05:24,707 --> 01:05:26,834
It's time to kick some butt.
Come on.

1049
01:05:27,574 --> 01:05:31,943
Ready, set, hike.

1050
01:05:34,374 --> 01:05:37,104
- I got him.
- Nicholas, block left. Come on.

1051
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:42,340
- Tommy.
- How do you like them apples?

1052
01:05:42,507 --> 01:05:45,305
- Get him.
- Yeah, come on.

1053
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,637
- Yeah.
- Yes. Yes.

1054
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,108
Tommy, what's going on?
You call that a tackle?

1055
01:05:57,574 --> 01:05:59,269
Told you, you gotta
stay in the zone.

1056
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,000
You gotta eat some lightning
and crap thunder, son.

1057
01:06:02,173 --> 01:06:04,938
You wanna get up? Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1058
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,404
- Come on. Come on, man.
- Shut up, Darryl. It's my son.

1059
01:06:11,273 --> 01:06:15,904
All right, it's do-or-die time.
Last point wins.

1060
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:19,242
Nicholas, you ready?

1061
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:25,276
Purple Haze. Purple Haze 15.

1062
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:29,805
Ready, set, hike.

1063
01:06:31,007 --> 01:06:32,235
Follow me.

1064
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,433
- Go, Nicholas. Go, Nicholas.
- Come on, come on.

1065
01:06:37,407 --> 01:06:38,965
- Bring it on.
- Go. Go.

1066
01:06:41,507 --> 01:06:43,839
- Go. Oh, my goodness.
- Come on, get up.

1067
01:06:45,007 --> 01:06:46,998
Go, Nicholas. Go, Nicholas.
Go, Nicholas.

1068
01:06:47,173 --> 01:06:49,734
- Come on.
- Tommy, hurry.

1069
01:06:49,907 --> 01:06:53,274
This team is dynamite
We're dynamite.

1070
01:06:54,507 --> 01:06:58,375
- That's my son.
- That is my boy. That is my boy.

1071
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:01,475
You did it, son. You
crapped thunder.

1072
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,268
Nine months inside. Yes.

1073
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,273
Dad, Dad.

1074
01:07:06,973 --> 01:07:10,171
- Yeah, son?
- You suck.

1075
01:07:10,773 --> 01:07:12,571
Son, Dad hurt his pee-pee.

1076
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:14,435
- Get up, you pussy.
- I can't.

1077
01:07:18,607 --> 01:07:21,599
All right, everybody, here she comes.
Everybody, on three.

1078
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:24,340
One, two, three.

1079
01:07:29,207 --> 01:07:30,902
They trying to punk me.

1080
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:36,066
All these people trying
to make a fool out of me.

1081
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,798
Trying to make me cry.

1082
01:07:38,074 --> 01:07:43,068
I didn't cry when I went to prison,
and I ain't gonna cry now.

1083
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:48,007
I don't care if I never had a
mother who threw me a party.

1084
01:07:48,674 --> 01:07:53,702
Today is my birthday and
I'm gonna smile, damn it.

1085
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:59,202
I wish I had a family.

1086
01:07:59,374 --> 01:08:03,333
Well done, baby.
What is this, Dad?

1087
01:08:03,507 --> 01:08:06,476
I got a gift for the kid. I know
I've been a little tough on him.

1088
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,632
But it ain't easy when I've been
the center of all the attention...

1089
01:08:09,807 --> 01:08:12,298
and all of a sudden, a kid
walk in the house. A baby.

1090
01:08:12,473 --> 01:08:15,932
I want you to know now, from
now on, I'm here to help.

1091
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,201
Now, Calvin, make a wish.

1092
01:08:20,374 --> 01:08:25,505
And I hope all of your
wishes come true.

1093
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,898
Oh, great, you're here.

1094
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,506
The bouncy's in the back.
Just go around the side.

1095
01:08:41,674 --> 01:08:43,141
No, I'm here to get my son.

1096
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,435
Little dude. Little man.

1097
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,367
- Son?
- That's right.

1098
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:51,600
I didn't think I could do it, but
I got myself together, baby.

1099
01:08:51,773 --> 01:08:54,937
So if you iust give me the boy,
we're gonna slide out of here.

1100
01:08:55,107 --> 01:08:58,770
So you're the guy who left
his baby on my doorstep...

1101
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:01,773
- ...in a dog basket?
- That's right, but that was a mistake.

1102
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:03,771
The guy who gave his
own kid a tattoo?

1103
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,465
Wait. I can explain that. His
mother was in the service.

1104
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,371
The person responsible for allowing his
baby boy to take a knife in the gut?

1105
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,167
Wait. The boy needed discipline.

1106
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:13,932
- You should be castrated.
- What?

1107
01:09:14,107 --> 01:09:15,972
Ain't nothing wrong
with my bowel movement.

1108
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,768
I go two, three times a day.
Let me tell you something.

1109
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:20,931
I ain't got to explain nothing.
I'm a grown-

1110
01:09:21,107 --> 01:09:24,406
You iust caught yourself the
official Brooklyn beat-down, homes.

1111
01:09:24,574 --> 01:09:26,735
You iust entered the
dragon, homeboy.

1112
01:09:26,907 --> 01:09:29,205
Word up. I'm gonna tap you
right on your Flintstone.

1113
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:32,104
Here it come, homeboy. Here
it come, homeboy. Here it-

1114
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,435
Who is Mike Jones?

1115
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,299
Get the hell out of here.
And don't come back.

1116
01:09:45,273 --> 01:09:47,208
I want my mother.

1117
01:09:48,174 --> 01:09:51,803
Looks like Percy's partner decided
to keep the rock for himself.

1118
01:09:51,973 --> 01:09:54,841
- Better go tell Mr. Walken.
- Yeah.

1119
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:58,975
There you go. Good.

1120
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,107
- Come on.
- Honestly, Janet...

1121
01:10:01,273 --> 01:10:02,673
I don't know how you do it.

1122
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,001
- What's that, sweetie?
- All of this.

1123
01:10:05,174 --> 01:10:07,404
The parenting, the
responsibility.

1124
01:10:07,574 --> 01:10:09,872
It's really no different
than any other career.

1125
01:10:10,574 --> 01:10:13,839
I mean, you have scheduling, you have planning.
Budgeting, of course.

1126
01:10:14,007 --> 01:10:16,635
I guess the big difference
is that my boss...

1127
01:10:16,807 --> 01:10:18,968
I want to slather in
kisses all day long.

1128
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,332
And I can, without being
sued for sexual harassment.

1129
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,335
And you don't miss
the iob at all?

1130
01:10:26,507 --> 01:10:29,340
You know, sometimes I
think I miss it...

1131
01:10:29,507 --> 01:10:31,975
but then I remember all they
really liked about me...

1132
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,971
was the money that
I made for them.

1133
01:10:34,473 --> 01:10:39,377
You know? I mean, this... This is real.
These guys dig me.

1134
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:43,636
I am a diva, a giant, a goddess.

1135
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:46,275
I'm perfect. Aren't I perfect?

1136
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:50,965
Mommy, I don't feel good.

1137
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:53,438
What's the matter, honey?
You got a tummy ache?

1138
01:10:53,607 --> 01:10:57,168
Yeah? Think maybe it's from
eating 16 pieces of cake...

1139
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,864
and beef ierky...

1140
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,304
and a balloon? Yeah.

1141
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,942
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1142
01:11:07,107 --> 01:11:08,597
Just a little teaspoon of this-

1143
01:11:08,773 --> 01:11:10,002
It is magic.

1144
01:11:10,174 --> 01:11:13,974
And he will poop very shortly.

1145
01:11:14,607 --> 01:11:16,268
It'll slide right out.

1146
01:11:18,273 --> 01:11:19,332
Good boy.

1147
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,674
Well, maybe you
should take him home.

1148
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,467
Yes, maybe we shall.

1149
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,609
- You wanna go home?
- And you too. Yeah.

1150
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,135
Oh, goodness, what do
you feed this kid?

1151
01:11:30,307 --> 01:11:31,740
What do I feed you?

1152
01:11:31,907 --> 01:11:33,841
- All right. I'll see you soon?
- Okay.

1153
01:11:34,007 --> 01:11:35,804
- Thank you.
- See you later. Come on, hon.

1154
01:11:35,973 --> 01:11:39,205
Such a good boy,
helping your mom.

1155
01:12:01,374 --> 01:12:03,934
Oh, sweetie. Wha-?

1156
01:12:04,273 --> 01:12:08,005
Oh, honey, what's wrong?
Sweetie?

1157
01:12:08,174 --> 01:12:11,268
- Hey, little man, what's the matter?
- I don't think he's feeling well.

1158
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,237
Are you okay?

1159
01:12:16,574 --> 01:12:19,202
What's the matter, you
gotta make a poo-poos?

1160
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:23,976
You gotta make a poo-poo. He gotta
make a little poo-poo, yeah.

1161
01:12:26,874 --> 01:12:28,273
God.

1162
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,001
What's going on, man, huh?

1163
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,966
Ain't that cute. He made
a little surprise...

1164
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:49,539
for Mommy.

1165
01:12:49,707 --> 01:12:50,969
- Mom-? For me?
- Go ahead.

1166
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:54,337
- Mommy take care.
- Darryl, why me? I did it last time.

1167
01:12:54,507 --> 01:12:56,407
Wash your hands before
you make dinner.

1168
01:12:56,574 --> 01:12:58,371
Come on, Calvin.

1169
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:00,300
Come on.

1170
01:13:08,074 --> 01:13:10,008
Man, what a day.

1171
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:14,700
- I can't believe you did this.
- Did what?

1172
01:13:14,874 --> 01:13:18,275
- This. Darryl, it's so beautiful.
- I did-I-

1173
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,772
It's so romantic, the way
you put it in his diaper.

1174
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:24,068
Then you made me change him even
though I didn't want to. Oh, so-

1175
01:13:24,807 --> 01:13:27,002
- No, but, honey-
- We should go out and celebrate.

1176
01:13:27,174 --> 01:13:28,801
- Somewhere nice? I'll change.
- Wait.

1177
01:13:28,973 --> 01:13:31,499
Thank you, baby. I love
it, I love it, I love it.

1178
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:34,939
- I love it, I love it, I love it.
- I gotta talk to you.

1179
01:13:35,107 --> 01:13:36,938
- Baby, come here.
- Damn.

1180
01:13:40,273 --> 01:13:42,003
Are you sure you guys
are gonna be okay?

1181
01:13:42,174 --> 01:13:46,133
- We'll be fine, won't we, little boy?
- I love Papa.

1182
01:13:46,307 --> 01:13:47,934
- All right. Bye.
- Okay.

1183
01:13:48,107 --> 01:13:50,337
Y'all have a good time, now.
I know we will.

1184
01:13:52,607 --> 01:13:54,302
Bye-bye.

1185
01:13:54,807 --> 01:13:58,971
We going to have a good time. He's a
nice little boy too. Yes, indeedy.

1186
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:02,075
He's a cute little boy too.
Look at the little baby.

1187
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:05,971
Yeah, he's a good little boy.
One, two, three.

1188
01:14:08,174 --> 01:14:10,506
Now, you come clean, you little punk.
Who are you?

1189
01:14:10,674 --> 01:14:13,404
Where you from? What you all about?
What is all this?

1190
01:14:16,973 --> 01:14:19,966
Look here, old man. You been
a real pain in my butt.

1191
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:22,506
And you're right, I did
rob that jewelry store.

1192
01:14:22,674 --> 01:14:25,643
And now there's some real
bad people after me.

1193
01:14:25,807 --> 01:14:27,968
And the people you love
are gonna get hurt...

1194
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,607
if I don't get that diamond.

1195
01:14:29,773 --> 01:14:34,336
And I don't want that to happen, so
you better just stay out of my way.

1196
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:43,002
Hey, yo, Percy, it's me.
Be here in a hour.

1197
01:14:43,174 --> 01:14:45,802
- I'll have the diamond then.
- How can you do this to us?

1198
01:14:46,407 --> 01:14:48,568
We took you in, thought
you were a child in need.

1199
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:52,301
- You turn out to be a lowlife thief.
- Look, I didn't mean for it to go this far.

1200
01:14:52,473 --> 01:14:54,567
I was iust trying to get
my diamond and be out.

1201
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:58,801
- You ain't getting away with it.
- Then it's time to dance. Come on.

1202
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,803
- Baby, I-
- Sweetheart...

1203
01:15:01,973 --> 01:15:03,999
this means so much to me.

1204
01:15:04,174 --> 01:15:06,267
I know it's not real.
Look at the size of this.

1205
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,431
There's no way you could
afford that, but...

1206
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,134
Well, it's what the ring symbolizes
that makes it so special to me.

1207
01:15:13,307 --> 01:15:15,969
- Yeah, about that, baby. I didn't-
- Please. Let me finish.

1208
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:20,304
Please. I know that you are not
the one who isn't ready. It's me.

1209
01:15:20,473 --> 01:15:23,068
I have always needed for
everything to fit my schedule.

1210
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:26,607
And you have shown me that sometimes
life doesn't work that way.

1211
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:30,642
It's unpredictable, and sometimes
you have to go with the flow and...

1212
01:15:30,807 --> 01:15:32,798
I'll never be ready
until it just happens.

1213
01:15:32,973 --> 01:15:36,273
- Vanessa, I iust wanna tell you-
- I think that we should just do it.

1214
01:15:37,307 --> 01:15:38,934
Do what?

1215
01:15:39,174 --> 01:15:40,471
Let's adopt him.

1216
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,131
Tomorrow let's take the
baby to Child Services...

1217
01:15:43,307 --> 01:15:44,604
and start the paperwork.

1218
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:46,332
You mean we can keep him?

1219
01:15:46,507 --> 01:15:48,407
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1220
01:15:49,674 --> 01:15:51,608
So, what did you wanna tell me?

1221
01:15:53,907 --> 01:15:54,896
Nothing.

1222
01:15:55,074 --> 01:15:56,905
Nothing at all.
Let's-Let's toast.

1223
01:15:57,407 --> 01:15:59,034
Okay.

1224
01:16:02,574 --> 01:16:04,303
You don't mess with
a man from Detroit.

1225
01:16:04,473 --> 01:16:05,634
I'm from Detroit.

1226
01:16:05,807 --> 01:16:08,002
The hell you doing?

1227
01:16:08,174 --> 01:16:10,074
- What's going on?
- Daddy, get off of him.

1228
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,265
- Get off of the baby.
- Stop it.

1229
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,930
Ain't no baby.
That's a criminal.

1230
01:16:14,107 --> 01:16:17,270
I have had it with you. I'm
calling Whispering Glen.

1231
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,702
Vanessa, I ain't crazy.

1232
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:21,604
You see, I know what is
and I know what ain't is.

1233
01:16:21,773 --> 01:16:23,935
And he ain't is
what he say he is.

1234
01:16:24,107 --> 01:16:26,302
You see, "is" is and
"ain'ts" ain't.

1235
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,435
Check the teddy bear.
The teddy bear.

1236
01:16:28,607 --> 01:16:30,074
Teddy bear knows.

1237
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,936
- Come on, then. Please.
- We'll take good care of your father.

1238
01:16:33,107 --> 01:16:35,166
Whispering Glen is
a safe facility.

1239
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,399
Give him a couple of
days to adjust...

1240
01:16:37,574 --> 01:16:39,906
- Let me go.
- ... and then come visit.

1241
01:16:47,973 --> 01:16:52,001
Vanessa, believe me.
"Is" is, "ain'ts" ain't.

1242
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,142
Use the Taser if you have to.

1243
01:16:54,307 --> 01:16:55,774
Check the teddy bear.

1244
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,430
The teddy bear.

1245
01:16:59,607 --> 01:17:01,472
I'm gonna go put him to bed.

1246
01:17:02,074 --> 01:17:03,598
Yeah.

1247
01:17:12,074 --> 01:17:13,063
Man.

1248
01:17:14,074 --> 01:17:17,441
How does one child turn a household
upside down in a weekend?

1249
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,900
Look at this place. It's a mess.

1250
01:17:35,973 --> 01:17:37,839
Check the teddy bear.
The teddy bear.

1251
01:17:38,007 --> 01:17:39,531
Teddy bear knows.

1252
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,465
Grandpa bad.

1253
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,268
No. No, baby. No, no, no.

1254
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,931
Papa's not bad. He didn't
mean to hurt you. He just-

1255
01:17:49,674 --> 01:17:52,768
He's a little... Yeah.

1256
01:18:19,773 --> 01:18:22,470
Wow, look here, old man. You've
been a real pain in the butt.

1257
01:18:23,174 --> 01:18:25,404
And you're right, I did
rob that jewelry store.

1258
01:18:25,574 --> 01:18:28,168
And now there's a lot
of bad people a_er me.

1259
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,932
People you love are
gonna get hurt...

1260
01:18:30,107 --> 01:18:31,665
if I don't get the diamond back.

1261
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,102
Vanessa.

1262
01:18:33,273 --> 01:18:34,434
Vanessa.

1263
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,700
- Where's Calvin?
- I put him in the cr-

1264
01:18:37,874 --> 01:18:40,104
- Where's the diamond?
- It was-

1265
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:43,135
- Gone.
- Damn. Pops was right.

1266
01:18:43,307 --> 01:18:46,174
- I'm calling the police.
- I'm gonna get my dad.

1267
01:18:47,874 --> 01:18:49,000
Dad!

1268
01:18:49,174 --> 01:18:51,540
Yes, I have some information
on a stolen diamond.

1269
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:53,864
That's what I'm talking about.

1270
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,871
We did it. We rich, baby.

1271
01:18:57,773 --> 01:19:00,971
- Yes. Just in the nick of time.
- We blinging.

1272
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,108
Walken and his goons is
going to that house.

1273
01:19:03,507 --> 01:19:04,735
- What?
- Don't worry.

1274
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:06,875
He thinks Darryl's my partner.

1275
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,941
You idiot. Walken will kill him
if he don't have his diamond.

1276
01:19:10,107 --> 01:19:13,338
Exactly. Which means he
won't be coming after you.

1277
01:19:13,507 --> 01:19:16,943
It's perfect. We get
away scot-free.

1278
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:20,698
This is the time
you hit me, right?

1279
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,564
Let me pull over.

1280
01:19:28,574 --> 01:19:31,873
Don't start beating me like
I'm a R & B singer, man.

1281
01:19:33,507 --> 01:19:36,601
Police is here. Hey.

1282
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,765
Hey. Can I help you?

1283
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,908
Is this the guy that
double-crossed Percy?

1284
01:19:42,074 --> 01:19:43,302
Yeah, that's the guy, boss.

1285
01:19:43,473 --> 01:19:46,671
I don't know anybody named Percy.
You must got the wrong guy.

1286
01:19:46,973 --> 01:19:49,442
- Cut the crap. I want my diamond.
- I don't have it.

1287
01:19:49,607 --> 01:19:52,235
Too bad. I guess we're gonna
have to beat it out of you.

1288
01:19:52,407 --> 01:19:55,137
I iust called the police. And
they're on their way over here.

1289
01:19:55,507 --> 01:19:57,771
Really? That doesn't
leave us much time then.

1290
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:01,602
- Take him.
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait, guys.

1291
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,400
Dada?

1292
01:20:07,174 --> 01:20:08,801
Dada.

1293
01:20:09,707 --> 01:20:10,765
Who's this little guy?

1294
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:13,632
That's my son.

1295
01:20:16,273 --> 01:20:17,298
Take him upstairs.

1296
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,674
- I wanna talk to you.
- Cute kid.

1297
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,468
It's-Just-I don't have-Listen.
That's my nipple.

1298
01:20:29,473 --> 01:20:30,600
Time to take a nap.

1299
01:20:30,773 --> 01:20:32,366
Night-night?

1300
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:35,475
And don't worry about any loud
noises you may hear downstairs.

1301
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,904
It's iust us beating
up your daddy.

1302
01:20:40,074 --> 01:20:41,666
Here you are.

1303
01:20:44,807 --> 01:20:46,968
Nighty-night.

1304
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:24,471
Click.

1305
01:21:29,773 --> 01:21:32,334
Now tell me, where's my diamond?

1306
01:21:32,507 --> 01:21:33,804
I told you, I don't have it.

1307
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:35,908
You don't tell me where
my diamond is...

1308
01:21:36,074 --> 01:21:39,703
that cute little baby of
yours is gonna get hurt.

1309
01:21:46,107 --> 01:21:48,667
Moron, get the kid. Get the kid.

1310
01:21:50,374 --> 01:21:51,602
I want him.

1311
01:21:57,407 --> 01:21:58,874
There you are, little buddy.

1312
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:01,539
Come on.

1313
01:22:01,707 --> 01:22:03,038
Come to Uncle Rosco.

1314
01:22:11,973 --> 01:22:13,601
Okay. Play nicey-nicey.

1315
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,305
Okay, get your ass up.

1316
01:22:45,473 --> 01:22:48,443
Yeah, get up. I got you now.

1317
01:22:48,607 --> 01:22:50,131
Yeah. Yeah.

1318
01:22:50,973 --> 01:22:52,236
Ain't so tough now, are you?

1319
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:58,401
Back up. Or I'll shoot you.

1320
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,672
Shoot me, tough guy. Come on.

1321
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:04,500
Oh, boy.

1322
01:23:04,674 --> 01:23:06,073
I'm surrounded by morons.

1323
01:23:06,574 --> 01:23:08,439
Here. You dropped your gun, sir.

1324
01:23:08,607 --> 01:23:11,075
Here you go. It's all yours.

1325
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,105
- What are you gonna do?
- Wait, wait, I-

1326
01:23:13,273 --> 01:23:16,038
Come on, get out of here.
Come on.

1327
01:23:20,473 --> 01:23:21,498
All right, dude.

1328
01:23:21,674 --> 01:23:26,134
You busted my Sergio da Vincis,
$62.50 designer frames.

1329
01:23:26,307 --> 01:23:29,299
Not cool. Not cool.

1330
01:23:29,807 --> 01:23:31,001
Okay, buddy.

1331
01:23:31,174 --> 01:23:33,574
We can either do this the
easy way or the hard way.

1332
01:23:35,407 --> 01:23:38,843
I think I like it the hard way.

1333
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,730
Did we get him?

1334
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,668
He's yours, man.

1335
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:00,929
Dude...

1336
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:04,005
you iust woke the dragon up.

1337
01:24:04,174 --> 01:24:05,835
Prepare for pain.

1338
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:08,805
It's time for the dragon
to go back to sleep.

1339
01:24:20,807 --> 01:24:22,604
What are you doing?

1340
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:27,841
- Stop.
- You going down, Sasquatch.

1341
01:24:28,007 --> 01:24:29,804
Better not.

1342
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:50,864
What the hell is going on here?

1343
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,564
That ain't no baby.

1344
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:53,934
- Who else is here?
- Nobody.

1345
01:24:54,107 --> 01:24:56,473
- Who's here?
- Nobody, I swear.

1346
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,232
Come on.

1347
01:24:58,407 --> 01:25:00,739
Inside. Inside.

1348
01:25:01,973 --> 01:25:03,202
There's the little monster.

1349
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,775
Listen, what does he got there?

1350
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,631
- It's an airplane.
- Tell him to get rid of the plane.

1351
01:25:09,973 --> 01:25:11,032
Get rid of it.

1352
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:14,571
Calvin, throw the plane.

1353
01:25:24,674 --> 01:25:25,663
What are you doing?

1354
01:25:31,973 --> 01:25:33,601
Don't move.

1355
01:25:34,874 --> 01:25:36,535
Save it, tough guy.

1356
01:25:36,707 --> 01:25:38,834
You're not gonna shoot me.

1357
01:25:39,407 --> 01:25:40,635
But I will.

1358
01:25:42,473 --> 01:25:43,600
Freeze! Police!

1359
01:25:43,773 --> 01:25:45,207
Freeze! Police!

1360
01:25:45,374 --> 01:25:47,365
I got this. You check the house.

1361
01:25:48,507 --> 01:25:51,442
Black cops, come with me.
White lady, you stay here.

1362
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,665
I'm telling you, guys,
that ain't no baby.

1363
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,070
He's the mastermind
behind the whole thing.

1364
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,764
Get him out of here.

1365
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:00,500
He's a stone-cold
killer, that kid.

1366
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:03,397
Would you get this thing off me?

1367
01:26:03,574 --> 01:26:06,975
Relax. Where you're going, you
might want to keep that on.

1368
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:09,303
I don't wanna go to iail.

1369
01:26:09,473 --> 01:26:11,567
It's too dark. There's no TV.

1370
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,235
Hey, where you
going, little guy?

1371
01:26:21,674 --> 01:26:23,471
Ain't this your kid?

1372
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,664
Dada?

1373
01:26:26,174 --> 01:26:26,975
Yeah, that's my son.

1374
01:26:28,407 --> 01:26:30,102
Now, Calvin...

1375
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,504
don't you have something
for the nice policeman?

1376
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,005
- No.
- Come on.

1377
01:26:36,174 --> 01:26:39,109
You don't wanna go to prison with
the rest of the bad men, do you?

1378
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:45,932
There we go.

1379
01:26:46,107 --> 01:26:48,166
Hey, the diamond.

1380
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:51,104
Thanks, kid. Now your dad's
gonna get a big reward.

1381
01:26:51,273 --> 01:26:53,606
- A reward?
- Yeah, the insurance company...

1382
01:26:53,773 --> 01:26:56,470
offered $ 1 OO, OOO to
whoever found the diamond.

1383
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,232
A hundred thousand dollars?

1384
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,307
God, that's gonna come in handy.

1385
01:27:00,473 --> 01:27:01,998
Shoot, I could get
my car fixed...

1386
01:27:02,174 --> 01:27:03,903
get a new wedding
ring for my wife...

1387
01:27:04,074 --> 01:27:07,407
I could take a vacation,
buy a TV set-

1388
01:27:07,874 --> 01:27:09,774
And if there's any
change left over...

1389
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:12,841
I'll give a little
something to my son.

1390
01:27:13,174 --> 01:27:15,836
Right. Well, we'll be in touch.

1391
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:27,300
So...

1392
01:27:27,574 --> 01:27:30,372
Oh, come on. Let's not get
all mushy about this.

1393
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:33,509
Let's iust shake hands
and part ways like men.

1394
01:27:33,674 --> 01:27:35,608
All right? No hard feelings?

1395
01:27:36,007 --> 01:27:38,407
- Nah, no hard feelings.
- All right.

1396
01:27:38,574 --> 01:27:41,441
Besides, it was kind of cool
having a son for a minute.

1397
01:27:41,607 --> 01:27:44,599
See? There you go with all
that sentimental stuff.

1398
01:27:45,473 --> 01:27:47,066
If that's the game
you wanna play...

1399
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:50,141
I guess it was cool
having you as a fa-

1400
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,700
Oh, boy.

1401
01:27:51,874 --> 01:27:55,935
What I'm trying to say is,
I've never really had a daddy.

1402
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,037
I guess what I'm saying is...

1403
01:27:58,207 --> 01:28:00,368
you're gonna make a great
father, all right?

1404
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,269
There, I said it.
Are you happy now?

1405
01:28:03,707 --> 01:28:05,538
Now, I'm gonna walk
out that back door...

1406
01:28:05,707 --> 01:28:09,473
and you ain't gonna see me no more.
Ever.

1407
01:28:10,473 --> 01:28:12,237
- But-
- Oh, it hurts.

1408
01:28:12,407 --> 01:28:14,238
- We-
- I know.

1409
01:28:14,407 --> 01:28:15,897
We'll never see
each other again.

1410
01:28:16,074 --> 01:28:18,372
- But we-
- Maybe that's for the best.

1411
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:19,700
You'll start a family...

1412
01:28:19,874 --> 01:28:22,775
and you won't need a
lowlife criminal like...

1413
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:24,771
Calvin Sims around anymore.

1414
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:28,467
Actually what I was gonna say
is, we don't have a back door.

1415
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,972
Okay, well, then I'll
go out the front.

1416
01:28:31,874 --> 01:28:34,399
- Fine.
- Well...

1417
01:28:35,007 --> 01:28:39,410
I'll be out of your lives for
good, never to return again.

1418
01:28:39,973 --> 01:28:41,566
Cool.

1419
01:28:45,174 --> 01:28:46,573
So long.

1420
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:50,267
Farewell. Oh, God.

1421
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:56,673
Aren't you gonna miss me?
Just a little bit?

1422
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:00,332
- See you around, buddy.
- No?

1423
01:29:00,907 --> 01:29:02,101
Take care.

1424
01:29:02,607 --> 01:29:04,234
Goodbye.

1425
01:29:04,407 --> 01:29:09,606
It's so hard to say goodbye.

1426
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:26,067
Why?

1427
01:29:26,874 --> 01:29:30,970
Nobody loves Calvin.

1428
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:33,131
Because I'm short.

1429
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:37,234
- They think I'm ugly.
- Hey, little man.

1430
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:39,835
Wanna share a glass of milk?

1431
01:29:49,807 --> 01:29:52,605
Enough of all this girlie stuff.
This ain't Brokeback Mountain.

1432
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:56,300
Hey, how about we put a little
bit of liquor in that milk?

1433
01:29:56,473 --> 01:29:58,271
Forget that. Let's go to a bar.

1434
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,600
All right. Bet.

1435
01:29:59,773 --> 01:30:02,265
- Are you over 21?
- And then some.

1436
01:30:02,473 --> 01:30:03,998
All right.

1437
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,367
Hey, I know this
great strip club.

1438
01:30:08,807 --> 01:30:10,741
Don't say that loud.
My wife might get mad.

1439
01:30:10,907 --> 01:30:12,670
- Oh, sorry.
- Got change of a hundred?

1440
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,138
- No, we steal it from Pops.
- All right. All singles.

1441
01:30:28,574 --> 01:30:31,304
You a cute little fellow.
Yes, you are.

1442
01:30:31,473 --> 01:30:34,238
Take after your mama. You got a
lot of grandpoppy in you too.

1443
01:30:34,407 --> 01:30:38,639
Yes, you do, little boy.
Look at the little boy.

1444
01:30:39,074 --> 01:30:40,803
Where's the bottle?
The kid is starving.

1445
01:30:40,973 --> 01:30:43,306
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Old grouch.

1446
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,337
Here he comes, little boy.

1447
01:30:45,507 --> 01:30:50,035
Don't worry. We gonna get
you some milk. Yeah.

1448
01:30:50,407 --> 01:30:52,637
That little guy's so cute...

1449
01:30:52,807 --> 01:30:55,002
it's making me go soft.

1450
01:30:55,174 --> 01:30:57,506
He look iust like his daddy.

1451
01:31:00,074 --> 01:31:02,565
Howdy-do, little boy.

1452
01:37:48,857 --> 01:37:49,983
So...

1453
01:37:50,257 --> 01:37:53,055
Oh, come on. Let's not get
all mushy about this.

1454
01:37:53,224 --> 01:37:56,193
Let's iust shake hands
and part ways like men.

1455
01:37:56,357 --> 01:37:58,291
All right? No hard feelings?

1456
01:38:23,224 --> 01:38:24,953
There, I said it.
Are you happy now?

1457
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:28,221
Now, I'm gonna walk
out that back door...

1458
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:32,156
and you ain't gonna see me no more.
Ever.
