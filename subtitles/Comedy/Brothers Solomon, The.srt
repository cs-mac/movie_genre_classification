1
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:16,752
Wow, the food is really good here!

2
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,611
It's got a nice vibe, too.

3
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:20,009
(December 24th, Christmas Eve)

4
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:22,580
You should get a girlfriend
and bring her here.

5
00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:24,759
I'll give you my card if you do.

6
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:26,002
Dad!

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,416
I'll be a senior next year, busy
for college!

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,916
Hey! That doesn't mean you can't have
a dinner out with your girlfriend.

9
00:00:36,112 --> 00:00:37,814
(Advert: Learn English Online!)

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,517
Is there someone you're waiting for?

11
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,197
Oh... So-woo.

12
00:00:42,963 --> 00:00:45,563
I think he's having some issues lately.

13
00:00:46,604 --> 00:00:47,681
So-woo?

14
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:49,369
Yes.

15
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:53,278
He hasn't been in school and I can't
get a hold of him.

16
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:55,595
I think he's starting to be depressed
again.

17
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:57,533
But I don't know how to help him.

18
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:59,321
Don't stress about it.

19
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:00,986
It happens pretty often, doesn't it?

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,610
He'll be fine soon.

21
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,064
It's a little different this time.

22
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:08,483
He keeps telling me things
I don't understand.

23
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:11,970
It's as if he's a completely
different person.

24
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,649
But Dad,

25
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:21,072
you seem very tired these days.

26
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,166
Maybe we can go on a trip
once my break starts.

27
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:27,072
Sounds good! Where?

28
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:38,976
When are you returning to school?

29
00:01:39,822 --> 00:01:41,756
Ji-hoon is worried about you.

30
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:45,101
He said it seems like you're having
a hard time.

31
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:46,868
I wonder...

32
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:50,882
How you looked when you heard that.

33
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,547
I heard from Ji-hoon.

34
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:58,392
How his biological father killed his mom,

35
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,783
and how you touched his heart after.

36
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,189
How you accepted him as family,

37
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:05,813
and how you

38
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,461
looked after him.

39
00:02:11,143 --> 00:02:13,361
You quit being a prosecutor

40
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:16,767
because you worried that Ji-hoon will
still remember that incident?

41
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:20,313
I was surprised.

42
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:25,509
I couldn’t believe there is such a great
person in the world.

43
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:28,800
A good will without any ulterior
motive exists!

44
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:31,821
But you...

45
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:43,502
I'm afraid that one day I'll grow up and be
an adult like you.

46
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,194
You don't have to worry about me.

47
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,200
Just worry about Ji-hoon.

48
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:59,028
What do you mean by that?

49
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:02,111
Does...

50
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:03,727
Ji-hoon know about this?

51
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:06,274
Why?

52
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:09,485
Are you ashamed?

53
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:13,485
I'm going to tell him.

54
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,790
He should know.

55
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:19,392
He should know what kind of a person
his father is.

56
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:22,752
He just got OK.

57
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,755
Don't make it hard for him.

58
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,744
I should keep my mouth shut because
it's an inconvenient truth?

59
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,135
That doesn't work on me anymore.

60
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,241
Ji-hoon is different from the kids
on the list.

61
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:40,479
- He's my friend.
- If he is...

62
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:43,483
You should protect him even more.

63
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,080
Why should Ji-hoon know about this?

64
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:47,704
Because it's sad.

65
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:51,201
Don't you feel sad for him?

66
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:54,775
He firmly believes that you are the savior
of his life.

67
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,399
He loves you and respects you the most!

68
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,430
It's sad to see.

69
00:04:01,814 --> 00:04:03,681
The real you is far from it.

70
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,206
To be disappointed and hurt by you

71
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,883
is his burden to bear.

72
00:04:14,064 --> 00:04:15,664
It's not my fault.

73
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:21,934
What I wanted to tell you

74
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:24,836
was that.

75
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,689
How dare you talk about Ji-hoon like that?

76
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:48,688
Jeong-guk Watchman.

77
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:54,252
Don't be mistaken about yourself, you were
just acting like a hero online.

78
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,478
No one will accept you in reality.

79
00:04:57,682 --> 00:05:00,205
You can't get along with anyone, you're
always negative,

80
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:04,150
always complaining about the system,
spreading negativity like cancer!

81
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:07,370
Not just your school life, but

82
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:10,181
you'll live alone in your entire life
typing on your keyboard just like now,

83
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:11,564
and die alone!

84
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:16,719
But Ji-hoon

85
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:19,556
is not like you, you're not fit
for society.

86
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,230
Never show your face around Ji-hoon!

87
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:09,830
(Solomon's Perjury Episode 11)

88
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:31,196
It's been a while!

89
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,244
Hello.

90
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:37,201
You've grown up quite a bit
since the last time I saw you.

91
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,322
We've never met with just us two before,
without So-woo.

92
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:43,946
No.

93
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,158
It is a bit awkward.

94
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,400
Have you been well?

95
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:52,439
Just so so. How about you?

96
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:56,563
I shouldn't have asked.

97
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,450
I'm sure you're not fine.

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,806
No.

99
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,861
I'm OK.

100
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:05,152
You don't need to hide it from me.

101
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:07,376
Really...

102
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:09,258
Are you OK?

103
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,658
No.

104
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:15,383
Then why?

105
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,291
Why do you torture yourself that way?

106
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:19,915
I want to know.

107
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:25,016
There's an answer I have to find out.

108
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,579
From whom?

109
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:30,009
Ji-hoon.

110
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,100
When I heard about the trial...

111
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:35,603
I wasn't sure why you'd go that far.

112
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:38,094
People have the right to forget, too.

113
00:07:38,315 --> 00:07:41,353
To talk about So-woo whom people had
already said good-bye's to...

114
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,892
And to discuss the incident in public,
all in detail,

115
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:45,298
it was uncomfortable.

116
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:47,455
I didn't think it was necessary.

117
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,384
But...

118
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:54,556
I kept hearing about how the trial was
going, and I realize what you're doing.

119
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,916
So,

120
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,206
I decided to go on the trial, too.

121
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:00,244
I'm a witness to the prosecutor.

122
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:02,736
You're gonna talk about the school?

123
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,041
Yes.

124
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:07,065
Choi Woo-hyuk's innocence is already
proven.

125
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:09,907
I think it's about time I should step in.

126
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,930
- I think that's a good idea.
- But...

127
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:17,173
How much should I say?

128
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,463
All of it.

129
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:22,086
All of it?

130
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:24,672
About you, too?

131
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:25,884
Yes.

132
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:27,259
Can you handle it?

133
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:30,041
I was already prepared before
the trial began.

134
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:34,533
I'm no longer the defense counsel
in the trial.

135
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:48,259
You can't call the judge into
the prosecutors' meeting!

136
00:08:48,283 --> 00:08:53,775
Then what do I do? Soo-hee's not here
and I'm no help to Seo-yeon.

137
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:57,134
You're the one who came so quickly when
I asked you to come see me!

138
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:58,994
You didn't say anything about a meeting.

139
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:01,900
Then what, you thought I had something
to tell you alone?

140
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:03,524
Yes... No.

141
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:07,955
Hurry, I've pushed back my lesson for this.

142
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:09,797
Nothing extraordinary.

143
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:15,549
But I felt like I should let you know what
might be said in this session.

144
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:20,502
I already know about the call records.

145
00:09:20,924 --> 00:09:22,486
I saw this video.

146
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:26,095
Lee Jung-woo? The teacher?

147
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,142
Yes.

148
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,947
He was our art teacher last year.

149
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,158
He was close to So-woo.

150
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,822
He's got something to say about the school.

151
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:35,978
Really?

152
00:09:35,986 --> 00:09:37,586
That's surprising.

153
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,869
The vice principal again? Why?

154
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:43,720
Don't you remember how upset he was
last time?

155
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:45,244
I know.

156
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:47,588
But he's speaking from a different
position this time.

157
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:50,298
He said he'll give an honest testimony
this time.

158
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,353
He'll talk about why the school wanted
to hide the So-woo incident.

159
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:56,777
Then he's being a whistle-blower
after he's fired?

160
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,892
It's going to upset many people,
regardless.

161
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,516
I know. I'll be careful.

162
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,314
Who's the last witness?

163
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:07,673
I've never heard this name before.

164
00:10:07,697 --> 00:10:09,197
That's to be told in court.

165
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:10,821
OK.

166
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,080
But you understand that your witnesses and
evidence are not so objective, right?

167
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:18,338
Your witnesses are former faculty members,
and your evidence is just assumptions about

168
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:19,954
that night.

169
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:23,806
There's no clear purpose the prosecutor has
in this trial session.

170
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,814
You only have three days before
you're expelled.

171
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,983
I can't set our objective to
just one thing.

172
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:34,822
I feel like I can find evidence as we go
through the testimony,

173
00:10:34,838 --> 00:10:36,595
about the male student.

174
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:39,767
I think it'll be a psychological
examination.

175
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:42,978
I want to try it first.

176
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:45,900
When did you become so audacious?

177
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:47,713
This is just like Schrödinger's cat!
A paradox!

178
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:48,791
That's true.

179
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,064
What is this?

180
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:52,368
What are you guys talking about?

181
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:53,689
What is that?

182
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:54,884
Don't worry about it.

183
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,766
What happened?

184
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:08,005
Happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you!

185
00:11:08,424 --> 00:11:11,259
What's this? We decided to skip
my birthday this year!

186
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:13,884
No matter how busy you are, you shouldn't
skip your birthday!

187
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:15,947
You probably only have about
80 birthdays left.

188
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:17,571
OK, again!

189
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:22,095
Happy birthday dear Seo-yeon...

190
00:11:22,502 --> 00:11:26,767
Happy birthday to you!

191
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:35,002
Thanks! That made me feel so much better.

192
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:37,338
Hey, too early to feel that way.

193
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:39,509
You still have this!

194
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:56,791
Wait, stop!

195
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:12,627
I hate my sister! How come there's
no birthday party?

196
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:14,643
I waited for this day for so long!

197
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,158
I know, I know...

198
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:19,502
Let's go out to eat ourselves when Dad
gets home.

199
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:21,041
Not that!

200
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:23,713
I like the birthday atmosphere.

201
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:26,275
The party hats, the candles...

202
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,431
Grow up already!

203
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:30,869
You still like birthday parties
at this age?

204
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:34,775
Dad's home!

205
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,399
Hello, Dad!

206
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,048
What's wrong?

207
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:43,736
Seo-yeon banned her own birthday party.

208
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,072
She said she has to focus
on the trial.

209
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:51,376
You guys go ahead.

210
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:53,563
Go on and eat it.

211
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:58,978
You know anything about tomorrow's trial?

212
00:12:59,627 --> 00:13:01,353
She hasn't been out of her room.

213
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:04,689
She just says, "I'm leaving for school,"
then, "I'm back from school."

214
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:06,446
That's all she says to me.

215
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:15,314
You didn't know?

216
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:20,048
Ji-hoon's father is the one who ordered
the club members to be expelled.

217
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:23,056
Do you think that was my only lie?

218
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:25,900
I am Han Kyung-hoon, the head of
the legal department.

219
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:49,197
(The day of the fourth trial)

220
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,080
(Notice: The participating trial club
members have been suspended for 5 days)

221
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:29,324
The defense counsel's space
has been closed off.

222
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,059
We can't use the main school building.

223
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:36,464
Ko Seo-yeon.

224
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:39,772
Tell me if you got something to say.

225
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:41,762
No need to avoid it.

226
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,933
I never did.

227
00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:49,455
Isn't it because you're hiding something
that you feel that way?

228
00:14:58,004 --> 00:15:01,027
This is the list of witnesses for
today's trial.

229
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:03,527
How about the defense counsel?

230
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,832
No witnesses.

231
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:06,456
No witnesses?

232
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,574
Why?

233
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:09,198
You said it yourself.

234
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:15,363
You asked me to pick apart your witnesses
and evidence, and assert for his suicide.

235
00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:18,323
I'll do just that.

236
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:10,138
You haven’t heard?

237
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:14,098
They're threatened to be expelled,
counting the days until it happens.

238
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:15,410
Expelled?

239
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,769
Five points off just for watching it!

240
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:20,644
All the students are stuck in their
classrooms.

241
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,268
They're taking it too far!

242
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:24,868
The school's out of their mind.

243
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:29,691
What do you think? Don't you feel like
Ji-hoon's target it the school?

244
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:46,363
Hello.

245
00:16:46,387 --> 00:16:50,699
We thank you very much for coming
this trial.

246
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,637
There is no defendant in this session.

247
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:56,590
We are here to find out the truth behind
Lee So-woo's death.

248
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:59,559
Please understand that there is no
defendant.

249
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,183
Please be seated.

250
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,559
We'll start the examinations.

251
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:37,918
You are Lee Jung-woo, the art teacher
in Jeong-guk High School until last year?

252
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:39,582
Yes, that's me.

253
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:42,848
You said you spoke with Lee So-woo
frequently.

254
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:48,129
Was it a personal relationship or just
between a teacher and a student?

255
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:54,035
I believe we were close friends, regardless
of age or being a teacher and a student.

256
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,645
We often met outside of school.

257
00:17:56,786 --> 00:18:01,293
Was there a specific incident where you and
Lee So-woo became close?

258
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:03,230
He liked drawing.

259
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:09,027
We felt connected in a sense that both of
us are the outsiders of Jeong-guk school.

260
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:10,949
"The outsiders"?

261
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:11,996
Yes.

262
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,059
We'd joke about it together.

263
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,598
He was probably the only student who didn't
care much about his grades in school.

264
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:24,473
I was just an art teacher that's hired
on contract, no one cared about me.

265
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:26,941
We were the outsiders in that sense.

266
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:32,738
Do you mean that Lee So-woo felt like
no one cared about him?

267
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,444
But he didn't feel particularly lonely
or anything.

268
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:42,012
So-woo said he was much more comfortable
talking to people online.

269
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:44,566
So-woo communicated online?

270
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:46,175
Yes.

271
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:48,198
Jeong-guk Watchman.

272
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:49,965
What?

273
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:53,855
So-woo was the admin for
the Jeong-guk Watchman account.

274
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:12,748
So-woo was the Watchman.

275
00:19:15,762 --> 00:19:17,362
So-woo was the Watchman.

276
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:21,339
So-woo was the Watchman!

277
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,254
Who was that?

278
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,777
Keep quiet during class!

279
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:31,875
Really?

280
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,113
Jeong-guk Watchman...

281
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,629
is still active.

282
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:42,902
So how can So-woo...

283
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:46,613
I believe a friend took over
that account.

284
00:19:46,715 --> 00:19:48,315
Lee So-woo's friend?

285
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,518
From this school?

286
00:19:56,168 --> 00:19:57,768
That...

287
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:03,456
I'm not sure.

288
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:06,222
Why...

289
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,270
Why did So-woo hide the fact that
he was the Watchman?

290
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,301
He didn't like getting attention.

291
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:15,991
He was also afraid that people might be
disappointed that it was him.

292
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:19,654
He said he'd rather remain
an imaginary friend.

293
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:26,948
Prosecutor.

294
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:31,698
Ko Seo-yeon!

295
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:34,526
I apologize.

296
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:40,434
Do you know how Lee So-woo started
to be active as Jeong-guk Watchman?

297
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,058
He...

298
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:45,012
Wanted to communicate with other students.

299
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,551
He was curious about what other students
were thinking.

300
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:53,020
He said they're not so honest in school,
always pretending to be someone else.

301
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:54,761
So...

302
00:20:55,778 --> 00:20:59,738
He wanted to know what the students
were hiding in their hearts?

303
00:20:59,762 --> 00:21:02,848
You make it sound like it was out of a
bad intention.

304
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,558
But it wasn't like that.

305
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:09,536
What So-woo wanted was more like
a release, an outlet,

306
00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:11,973
for the students, so they can breathe.

307
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,342
Watchman! Tell me about Han Ji-hoon.

308
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:22,770
No girlfriend, went to Jeong-guk elementary
and middle school, living in

309
00:21:22,786 --> 00:21:24,386
Monte Visa Penthouse.

310
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:29,512
Whoever took Lee Yoo-jin's wallet by
mistake, or found it, please message me.

311
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:35,137
I'll deliver it to the owner anonymously.

312
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,761
Jeong-guk Watchman!

313
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:42,543
Ahn Yoo-min in Class 2-1 is not
a teacher's pet who's reporting

314
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,367
everything to the teachers.

315
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:48,699
Please refrain from assumptions and
witch hunts.

316
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:52,379
Jeong-guk Watchman strikes again!

317
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:54,336
- What is it?
- Take a look!

318
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:00,082
Wow, how could he have thought of this?

319
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:01,691
It's such a relief!

320
00:22:01,715 --> 00:22:04,152
- Did you see what he posted?
- He's so awesome!

321
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:06,543
I'm sure he's a tall and handsome guy!

322
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:10,066
As you all know, people liked him
very much online.

323
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:12,769
Many people went to him to be counseled,

324
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:14,519
many reported things to him and
exposed things, too.

325
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:16,488
Exposed things? What kind?

326
00:22:18,176 --> 00:22:19,668
Were there things about the school?

327
00:22:19,692 --> 00:22:22,035
I can't pinpoint it like that.

328
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:26,309
But So-woo took it as something that's
related with the school.

329
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:30,599
Can you show the picture that's on
the Watchman's profile page?

330
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:32,675
Yes.

331
00:22:37,614 --> 00:22:39,809
Yes, this painting.

332
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:42,527
This was his favorite painting.

333
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:46,551
From So-woo's perspective, this is what
the school felt like.

334
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:48,832
Could you elaborate in more detail?

335
00:22:49,028 --> 00:22:52,348
It's called "the Magpie on the Gallows" by
Bruegel.

336
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,777
It just looks like an ordinary landscape
painting of a farm.

337
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:57,020
But look at the middle.

338
00:22:57,036 --> 00:23:03,684
There's a gallows, and a person seized by
people and being dragged to the gallows.

339
00:23:04,364 --> 00:23:07,340
This was painted in the Netherlands in the
16th century.

340
00:23:07,364 --> 00:23:10,988
Witch hunts and inquisitions were
popular then.

341
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:14,066
But their evidence against those charges
were completely absurd.

342
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:16,302
- Anonymous accusations.
- Yes.

343
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:19,707
Someone just had to say, "So-and-so
is a witch, a heretic."

344
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,473
Just with that, they could kill someone.

345
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:27,363
To today's standards, it seems like they
were such bad people.

346
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:33,137
But they had to do so to protect
themselves.

347
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:34,941
It was a way of life to them.

348
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:36,863
Then how did So-woo...

349
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:41,504
Relate this painting to Jeong-guk
High School?

350
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:45,730
There was once a bad rumor about a
particular student in school.

351
00:23:45,754 --> 00:23:48,154
- It was a big issue.
- Ahn Yoo-mi?

352
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,449
Yes. That student.

353
00:23:52,356 --> 00:23:57,449
She had told a teacher about another
student who broke a school rule,

354
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,723
and didn't get her own points deducted
because of it.

355
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:03,730
That other student started a bad rumor
about Yoo-mi.

356
00:24:04,153 --> 00:24:07,598
So-woo calmed the students down a bit,
but Yoo-mi was very upset.

357
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:10,598
But wasn't that just between them?

358
00:24:11,247 --> 00:24:13,520
Not to So-woo.

359
00:24:22,465 --> 00:24:24,065
People don't change.

360
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:30,397
They make up systems and oppress,
or be oppressed.

361
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:35,676
And make scapegoats out of others so
out of their fear of being oppressed.

362
00:24:35,997 --> 00:24:40,597
He wasn't sure why the world hasn't
changed, after all that time.

363
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:45,146
He had asked, "Isn't the school at fault
for creating a system that makes students

364
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:47,277
report on each other for
higher points?"

365
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,469
I couldn't answer his question.

366
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:54,004
You stated that So-woo was already
at odds with the school.

367
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:56,973
Was it because of his rebellious feelings
like this one?

368
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:59,598
It wasn't really about his rebellious
nature.

369
00:24:59,622 --> 00:25:03,824
But I was told that he was asked to leave
the school for posting something

370
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,223
on the Watchman account.

371
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:12,613
The school had threatened to move
So-woo to a different school!

372
00:25:12,622 --> 00:25:14,222
He was asked to leave?

373
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:17,102
Just what did he post online?

374
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,874
I don't know its content.

375
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:23,229
That's why he stopped coming to school?

376
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,215
It wasn't about the science lab fight?

377
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:30,121
It was long before the fight when he
mentioned that he was asked to leave.

378
00:25:30,145 --> 00:25:33,551
There were a few months that Jeong-guk
Watchman didn't post anything.

379
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,167
Yes.

380
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:38,473
- That started around October.
- It was then.

381
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:41,941
That's when the school asked So-woo
to leave this school for a different one.

382
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,776
- Recess!
- Recess!

383
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
Time out!

384
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:50,848
Recess!

385
00:25:50,872 --> 00:25:52,707
Adjourn the trial for a second!

386
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,690
Objection!

387
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,957
Objection... To Prosecutor?
You're in her team!

388
00:25:58,981 --> 00:26:00,371
It's not that...

389
00:26:00,395 --> 00:26:01,215
I request for a recess.

390
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,839
Yoo-jin!

391
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,220
I request a break for 30 minutes.

392
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,215
We'll be adjourned for 30 minutes.

393
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:13,832
Mr. Han.

394
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:15,789
It's brought up in the trial!

395
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:22,683
Lee Yoo-jin!

396
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:24,176
The students are asking for a recess?

397
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,200
Yes, they're going crazy saying that
they want to watch it.

398
00:26:29,683 --> 00:26:31,809
Crazy, So-woo was the Watchman?

399
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:34,504
- I'm getting the chills!
- Why kick him out of school? For what?

400
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:37,629
- Hurry to the auditorium!
- For sure, we have to see this!

401
00:26:37,653 --> 00:26:40,676
- Forget about the points deduction!
- Who can take my seat here?

402
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,262
Hey!

403
00:26:42,286 --> 00:26:44,426
Hey, Joon-young!

404
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,629
So-woo was the Watchman?

405
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:50,198
- How about your class?
- That's not so important right now.

406
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:52,489
All the other kids are coming too!

407
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:54,918
What happened? Tell me the details!

408
00:26:54,942 --> 00:26:58,020
We'll explain later, but have them sit
in the auditorium.

409
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,559
Hurry! Before we get in trouble!

410
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:02,527
Why me? I'm not even on the defense team
anymore.

411
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:04,151
Are you proud of that?

412
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,190
Just go.

413
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,613
Ko Seo-yeon.

414
00:27:10,637 --> 00:27:12,771
Let me talk to you for a second.

415
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:21,029
Prosecutor. You get the feel for it?

416
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:24,073
I see what's happening.

417
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:28,137
We need to hear more details from
the next witness.

418
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:29,761
Are you sure about this?

419
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:47,276
You're just like them.

420
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:57,793
(Jeong-guk Watchman)

421
00:27:57,817 --> 00:28:00,350
Did you watch the movie I recommended?

422
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,402
It was good!

423
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:05,559
What's your next recommendation?

424
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:34,527
Please be quiet.

425
00:28:34,551 --> 00:28:36,402
We'll begin the examination.

426
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:41,035
What is your position as a witness
in this trial?

427
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:46,566
The former vice principal and interim
principal of Jeong-guk High School.

428
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:48,610
But you're not one currently?

429
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:50,652
No.

430
00:28:50,676 --> 00:28:53,010
Did you quit your post on your own?

431
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,831
No way.

432
00:28:55,528 --> 00:28:58,496
I am very attached to this school.

433
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:05,348
This is all from my effort to protect this
trial from the pressures from school.

434
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:06,762
Pressures from school?

435
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,012
Yes.

436
00:29:08,036 --> 00:29:09,723
From Jeong-guk Foundation.

437
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,754
How were you pressured?

438
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:14,582
They told me to disband the trial club.

439
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:16,406
And if they don't listen...

440
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,746
They told me to expel the students involved
in it, so harsh!

441
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:27,237
The foundation?

442
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:33,434
You were fired because you didn't
listen tot hem?

443
00:29:33,536 --> 00:29:35,059
Yes.

444
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:39,121
Like you, I was punished for doing
the right thing!

445
00:29:39,317 --> 00:29:41,117
We're all in the same boat.

446
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:43,957
Just earlier,

447
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:49,558
Lee Jung-woo, who was once a faculty member
here, revealed that So-woo was

448
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:51,182
Jeong-guk Watchman.

449
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,558
Did you know this fact?

450
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:54,761
Yes.

451
00:29:54,785 --> 00:29:59,191
He also testified that because of what
So-woo posted on the Watchman account,

452
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:03,074
So-woo was asked to leave the school.

453
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,159
Is that true?

454
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,043
Yes, it's true.

455
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:18,902
Do you know the content he wrote?

456
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:20,395
Yes.

457
00:30:20,504 --> 00:30:22,304
It was about Jeong-guk's...

458
00:30:30,356 --> 00:30:34,098
unfair admission documents, their pictures.

459
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:40,504
Unfair admission?

460
00:30:40,528 --> 00:30:43,754
There are students admitted to Jeong-guk
High School unfairly?

461
00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:45,823
Yes, there are several.

462
00:30:53,903 --> 00:30:55,503
So you mean...

463
00:30:56,176 --> 00:31:00,801
Lee So-woo posted documents proving
unfair admission practice of the school,

464
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,667
then he was asked to leave the school?

465
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:10,090
Technically, it wasn't the document itself,
but the cover of the document.

466
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:15,129
The school didn't ask him to leave, but the
foundation did.

467
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:18,121
- Where's that photo...
- It was immediately deleted.

468
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:22,812
I'm sure it was someone high up in the
foundation who pressured him.

469
00:31:24,106 --> 00:31:27,660
Do you have any evidence to prove
your statement?

470
00:31:27,684 --> 00:31:29,284
I don't.

471
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:36,590
Is there anyone who remembers seeing
the photo the Watchman posted?

472
00:31:42,372 --> 00:31:43,972
I remember it.

473
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:48,457
The cover of the document said,
"VIP."

474
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:51,168
Yes, that's the one.

475
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:54,379
It's the list of students who were
admitted unfairly.

476
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:00,261
Witness.

477
00:32:00,402 --> 00:32:03,769
Please tell us everything about this
unfair admission practice.

478
00:32:03,793 --> 00:32:06,816
Because I was just the vice principal
then...

479
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,379
I was just told that there was a list.

480
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:13,803
The principal and people from the
foundation know more about it.

481
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:17,919
The School Violence Prevention Committee,
too, was not suggested by Choi Woo-hyuk's

482
00:32:17,943 --> 00:32:19,543
parents.

483
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:24,035
While Lee So-woo was refusing to leave
the school,

484
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:26,951
he got in trouble by getting into a fight.

485
00:32:26,975 --> 00:32:30,375
The foundation took it as an opportunity
for them.

486
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:35,115
That's why the Committee was called
so quickly,

487
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:38,072
and determined Lee So-woo as
the assailant.

488
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,490
It was already determined that
Lee So-woo...

489
00:32:42,514 --> 00:32:44,114
will be expelled.

490
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:51,443
They are just too much!

491
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:53,606
I agree.

492
00:32:55,818 --> 00:32:59,021
Who made that call?

493
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:03,091
Who pressured Lee So-woo
to move school?

494
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:06,396
And determined that he is to be expelled
through the Committee?

495
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,912
- That's my question.
- Do you really need me to spell it out?

496
00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:15,404
It was Han Kyung-moon, the head of the
legal department of the foundation.

497
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:18,427
Defense Counsel, ask questions
after Prosecutor's examination.

498
00:33:18,451 --> 00:33:20,051
No.

499
00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:23,818
I'll finish my examination here.

500
00:33:25,677 --> 00:33:27,944
You may cross-examine the witness.

501
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:39,974
You testified last time that the School
Violence Prevention Committee was called

502
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:41,798
according to school policy.

503
00:33:41,998 --> 00:33:44,398
- Do you remember it?
- That was...

504
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,029
When I was still hired by the school.

505
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:49,357
Of course I couldn't speak the truth.

506
00:33:49,381 --> 00:33:51,091
You committed perjury then?

507
00:33:51,115 --> 00:33:53,818
I guess you can say that, technically.

508
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:59,138
But... I'm now here to correct it.

509
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,591
You knew that it was wrong then.

510
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:05,255
Yes.

511
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,755
But...

512
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:09,240
I was only following an order.

513
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:11,490
I wasn't the one who gave the order.

514
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:14,146
- I had no authority to do so!
- At that time, you were...

515
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:18,029
The committee chair of the School Violence
Prevention Committee.

516
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:23,005
Are you saying a harsh punishment like
expulsion was given without

517
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:25,363
the consent of the committee chair?

518
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:31,763
Isn't it that you also wanted to get rid
of So-woo from the school,

519
00:34:31,787 --> 00:34:34,333
because he exposed the school's
corruption?

520
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:38,818
- I had no choice then!
- A great power called the foundation

521
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:42,615
drove an 18-year-old to
death.

522
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,615
You knew it was the wrong thing to do.

523
00:34:47,248 --> 00:34:49,427
Yet you agreed to it and watched it happen.

524
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:53,901
Now you're saying, "I'm not responsible,"
"I had no choice."

525
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:57,045
Don't you think those words...

526
00:34:58,303 --> 00:34:59,857
Are so cowardly?

527
00:35:01,678 --> 00:35:03,013
Han Ji-hoon!

528
00:35:03,037 --> 00:35:06,591
Do you have any right to say
those kinds of words to me?

529
00:35:06,615 --> 00:35:08,949
- You are...
- Mr. Vice Principal!

530
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:24,325
Hey, Han Ji-hoon!

531
00:35:34,076 --> 00:35:35,591
Illicit admission...

532
00:35:35,615 --> 00:35:37,396
Isn't it a serious matter if it's true?

533
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,693
Of course!

534
00:35:38,717 --> 00:35:42,250
Do you know how hard I studied
to enter this school?

535
00:35:42,352 --> 00:35:44,216
How can someone just pay money
to get in?

536
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,318
They have no conscience!

537
00:35:45,342 --> 00:35:49,865
If it is true, we have to find out
who were admitted unfairly and expel them.

538
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,970
I won't allow them to study in the same
classroom as me.

539
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:58,318
But where did Han Ji-hoon go?

540
00:35:58,482 --> 00:36:01,240
- I thought he was here.
- He's been weird lately.

541
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:03,309
He hasn't met with the rest of the
defense counsel, and doesn't

542
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,654
check his messages.

543
00:36:04,678 --> 00:36:07,865
It feels like... He's getting ready
to leave.

544
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:10,285
Just a hunch.

545
00:36:30,963 --> 00:36:33,923
You didn't go to school today either?

546
00:36:34,502 --> 00:36:35,954
Get out.

547
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:38,017
I'm going to sleep.

548
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:39,641
So-woo!

549
00:36:45,111 --> 00:36:47,524
It's not that I'm not going to school.

550
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:49,148
It's the school...

551
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:52,813
That doesn't want me.

552
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,000
Where is it?

553
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:20,821
Hey there, I have a...

554
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:23,492
Wait.

555
00:37:24,892 --> 00:37:28,009
You're the guy from...

556
00:37:29,478 --> 00:37:31,078
Hello.

557
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:33,938
How...

558
00:37:37,345 --> 00:37:38,945
Yes, sir.

559
00:37:39,963 --> 00:37:42,564
I'm watching the trial.

560
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:45,939
It's pretty surreal what's happening here.

561
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:47,719
Unfair admission?

562
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:50,531
Who testified?

563
00:37:51,384 --> 00:37:52,984
OK. I'll be right there.

564
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:03,642
We'll being the examination.

565
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,165
Please keep quiet.

566
00:38:05,189 --> 00:38:08,456
Next is the third witness from
the prosecutor.

567
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,500
Please come in.

568
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,820
Ji-hoon.

569
00:38:29,423 --> 00:38:30,923
Your honor!

570
00:38:30,947 --> 00:38:33,680
I need a moment with the defense counsel.

571
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,037
Before the witness testimony.

572
00:38:47,072 --> 00:38:50,564
- You...
- I know he's your father.

573
00:38:52,853 --> 00:38:54,423
I met him a few days ago.

574
00:38:54,447 --> 00:38:59,047
He asked why I wanted to continue with
the trial, and its direction.

575
00:38:59,181 --> 00:39:01,767
And I asked him to come on the trial.

576
00:39:03,423 --> 00:39:05,557
- What will you ask him?
- Why?

577
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:09,758
Is there something I shouldn't ask about?

578
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:12,897
Are you hiding something from us?

579
00:39:13,658 --> 00:39:15,258
Something else?

580
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,985
I want to confirm if there truly are
students who were admitted illegally.

581
00:39:24,009 --> 00:39:27,845
And if they really wanted to kick So-woo
out of school for knowing it.

582
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,570
And if he is...

583
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,173
The one who was behind all this.

584
00:39:34,236 --> 00:39:35,836
Let me do it.

585
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:41,328
I ask you.

586
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:44,978
I want to examine my father.

587
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,500
No.

588
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,266
I don't trust you.

589
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:22,228
Witness.

590
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:25,118
You must swear an oath as written
on your table.

591
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:26,501
Do you agree to it?

592
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:27,571
Yes.

593
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:30,329
Please swear with your right hand raised.

594
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:38,493
I pledge an oath to testify to the
truth according to my conscience.

595
00:40:38,517 --> 00:40:41,485
I will not hide anything nor add anything,
and only speak the truth.

596
00:40:44,853 --> 00:40:46,453
Thank you.

597
00:40:47,103 --> 00:40:48,946
Prosecutor may begin the examination.

598
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:50,563
Yes.

599
00:41:03,822 --> 00:41:07,267
Are you Mr. Han Kyung-moon, the head of
the legal department of Jeong-guk

600
00:41:07,283 --> 00:41:11,392
Foundation, to which Jeong-guk High School
belongs?

601
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:15,243
- Yes.
- The legal department...

602
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,134
What is your main responsibility there?

603
00:41:17,158 --> 00:41:22,384
We make sure that there are no legal issues
that arise in our schools.

604
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:23,525
Then...

605
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:26,907
You have a say in the school's management.

606
00:41:28,728 --> 00:41:30,610
I receive general reports.

607
00:41:30,853 --> 00:41:35,204
What happens when you feel that there is
an issue based on the reports?

608
00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:39,204
Do you give orders to resolve
those issues?

609
00:41:40,384 --> 00:41:44,118
There hasn't been an issue that I had to
give an order.

610
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,852
Witness.

611
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,391
Did you know Lee So-woo?

612
00:41:51,627 --> 00:41:53,227
- Yes.
- How?

613
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,517
He's the student that died last December,
in Class 2-1 of Jeong-guk High School.

614
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:01,541
I was briefed about him after
then incident.

615
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:05,706
Was that all? Being reported
after the incident?

616
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,141
There was a testimony that you had
pressured Lee So-woo to go to a

617
00:42:09,157 --> 00:42:11,876
different school because of what was posted
in Jeong-guk Watchman account,

618
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,180
also that you wanted to expel him through
the School Violence Prevention Committee.

619
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,610
That statement...

620
00:42:16,626 --> 00:42:18,508
Is not trustworthy.

621
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:19,781
What makes you say that?

622
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:23,930
The former vice principal has been let go
of his position due to violating

623
00:42:23,954 --> 00:42:25,621
the committee's policies.

624
00:42:26,102 --> 00:42:29,797
Thus, he has a motive to testify
against the school.

625
00:42:29,821 --> 00:42:33,828
Another teacher, Lee Jung-woo, also
gave the same testimony.

626
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:37,539
He said that Lee So-woo was at odds
with the school because of the

627
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,132
Jeong-guk Watchman account.

628
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:43,343
All the same, he's no longer hired
by the school as his contract expired.

629
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:47,476
Did you know that Lee So-woo was
Jeong-guk Watchman?

630
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:49,234
Yes.

631
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:55,194
But Lee So-woo never revealed that he was
the Watchman to anyone.

632
00:42:56,382 --> 00:43:00,916
Do you admit that you secretly investigated
to find out who he was?

633
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:04,358
It was to find out basic information
about the account.

634
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:08,835
You're saying that the school and Lee
So-woo did not have any issues...

635
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:13,062
Then why did the Foundation investigate to
find out about who's behind it?

636
00:43:13,086 --> 00:43:16,686
Jeong-guk Watchman was an anonymous
online community.

637
00:43:16,968 --> 00:43:20,929
It had the potential to cause legal issues
such as spreading false rumors or

638
00:43:20,953 --> 00:43:24,734
harshly criticizing certain students.

639
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,038
The legal department had every reason
to watch the account.

640
00:43:29,062 --> 00:43:31,921
If you have been watching it closely...

641
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:36,866
Then you must've seen the illicit admission
document that was posted.

642
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:43,882
This is the first time I've ever
heard about such a list.

643
00:43:44,765 --> 00:43:46,365
Can you show it to me?

644
00:43:48,773 --> 00:43:52,573
The picture of the list that So-woo
apparently posted...

645
00:43:53,312 --> 00:43:54,912
Can you show it to me?

646
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:08,788
The picture has been since deleted but the
judge here also admitted that he saw it.

647
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,116
A cover that said, "VIP."

648
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:15,327
How can you prove that the letters, "VIP,"
refer to a list of students who were

649
00:44:15,343 --> 00:44:17,124
unfairly admitted?

650
00:44:17,148 --> 00:44:18,116
Witness!

651
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,474
The judge determines the credibility
of evidence.

652
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,780
Not you.

653
00:44:23,656 --> 00:44:25,256
Your honor.

654
00:44:25,515 --> 00:44:27,726
It's easy to be confused.

655
00:44:27,961 --> 00:44:32,718
But admissibility and credibility are two
different things.

656
00:44:34,226 --> 00:44:39,210
Even in real courtrooms, the judge is not
to determine the credibility of evidence

657
00:44:39,234 --> 00:44:40,991
on his own.

658
00:44:44,062 --> 00:44:48,233
Prosecutor has assumed that a document
showing students who were unfairly admitted

659
00:44:48,257 --> 00:44:52,093
exists, as well as issues between Lee
So-woo and the school.

660
00:44:52,117 --> 00:44:53,827
She's questioning me with these
assumptions.

661
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:57,601
Although it is a school trial
done by students,

662
00:44:58,211 --> 00:45:03,421
shouldn't it be based on evidence
with credibility?

663
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:09,236
I'd like to confirm it before I go on
with my further statements.

664
00:45:10,492 --> 00:45:14,359
Can you prove that such a list
exists?

665
00:45:28,554 --> 00:45:32,351
The defense counsel can turn in
such evidence.

666
00:45:51,203 --> 00:45:55,279
These are the photos of the document
Jeong-guk Watchman had posted.

667
00:45:55,303 --> 00:45:56,710
Just as I said before...

668
00:45:56,726 --> 00:45:58,326
And this!

669
00:46:06,172 --> 00:46:10,640
Is the actual list of students who were
unfairly admitted to school.

670
00:46:39,086 --> 00:46:40,686
The letters, "VIP,"

671
00:46:41,797 --> 00:46:44,679
did refer to the list of unfairly admitted
students.

672
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:47,441
The existence of such a list is

673
00:46:48,047 --> 00:46:49,647
also true.

674
00:46:49,843 --> 00:46:51,069
Witness.

675
00:46:51,172 --> 00:46:52,546
Please answer.

676
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,890
You are the head of the legal department
of Jeong-guk Foundation,

677
00:46:55,914 --> 00:46:59,538
and you admitted that you've been closely
watching Jeong-guk Watchman.

678
00:47:00,398 --> 00:47:01,804
Yet...

679
00:47:01,906 --> 00:47:05,239
This is the first time you knew about
this list?

680
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:08,260
When Lee So-woo posted this picture...

681
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:12,562
You never gave any kind of order
because of it?

682
00:47:19,453 --> 00:47:25,054
It's just a piece of paper with a list of
names, anyone can make it up.

683
00:47:25,664 --> 00:47:28,312
This does not serve as the evidence to
prove that there were students

684
00:47:28,336 --> 00:47:29,773
who were admitted unfairly.

685
00:47:29,797 --> 00:47:34,624
Just as such, I never gave any kind of
orders based on this claim.

686
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,765
I never pressured anyone to move to
a different school, or frame someone

687
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:38,921
through the Committee.

688
00:47:39,867 --> 00:47:41,467
Witness.

689
00:47:42,047 --> 00:47:43,647
You just swore an oath.

690
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:47,195
You must follow your conscience,

691
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:52,687
not add or hide anything from the truth,
you swore it at your seat.

692
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:56,037
I'll ask again.

693
00:47:57,578 --> 00:47:59,178
Are your words...

694
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,490
True?

695
00:48:05,562 --> 00:48:07,162
They are.

696
00:48:21,882 --> 00:48:24,296
That was enough examination.

697
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:28,113
We'll adjourn for 30 minutes.

698
00:48:53,453 --> 00:48:57,124
They are extraordinary all around,
Ji-hoon who questioned his own father,

699
00:48:57,148 --> 00:48:59,569
and Mr. Han who denied it
until the end.

700
00:48:59,944 --> 00:49:02,429
You said Ji-hoon planned for the trial?

701
00:49:02,453 --> 00:49:03,640
Yes.

702
00:49:03,664 --> 00:49:05,464
Seo-yeon doesn't know this?

703
00:49:05,687 --> 00:49:10,124
She did ask if I knew whom Jeong-guk
Watchman is.

704
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:13,937
I didn't tell her, it wasn't my place.

705
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:16,279
Good.

706
00:49:16,523 --> 00:49:19,523
She'll find out eventually, she should
hear it from him.

707
00:49:19,632 --> 00:49:21,366
We shouldn't get involved.

708
00:49:22,554 --> 00:49:25,062
But illicit admission...

709
00:49:25,398 --> 00:49:30,429
Should we investigate it since there are
witness testimonies and the pictures?

710
00:49:30,616 --> 00:49:32,538
It wasn't reported to us directly.

711
00:49:32,562 --> 00:49:34,495
The vice principal earlier...

712
00:49:34,711 --> 00:49:38,077
I think he'll agree to report it
if we talked to him.

713
00:49:38,195 --> 00:49:40,595
It's a very well-managed foundation.

714
00:49:41,547 --> 00:49:45,577
It's hard to investigate, only a few
probably know about such a list.

715
00:49:45,976 --> 00:49:48,929
If the vice principal had a conclusive
evidence,

716
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,886
they wouldn't have fired him.

717
00:50:05,148 --> 00:50:06,679
Hello.

718
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,960
Hey there, nice to see you again!

719
00:50:08,984 --> 00:50:10,460
You came for the trial?

720
00:50:10,484 --> 00:50:13,648
Yes, after you guys came,

721
00:50:13,765 --> 00:50:16,499
I've been curious about how it was going.

722
00:50:16,945 --> 00:50:18,612
You must be disappointed.

723
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:21,437
We couldn't figure anything out.

724
00:50:21,461 --> 00:50:23,061
But more than that...

725
00:50:23,843 --> 00:50:25,443
Seo-yeon.

726
00:50:25,953 --> 00:50:29,953
You know that male student I said
I saw in the phone booth?

727
00:50:30,968 --> 00:50:32,568
Why is he here?

728
00:50:33,937 --> 00:50:35,537
What?

729
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:46,898
Him, right there!

730
00:50:53,437 --> 00:50:55,037
You must be mistaken.

731
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,390
No.

732
00:50:57,414 --> 00:50:59,747
He saw me just now and
greeted me.

733
00:50:59,968 --> 00:51:02,768
He thanked me for worrying about him then.

734
00:51:04,203 --> 00:51:05,491
Is that really true?

735
00:51:05,515 --> 00:51:07,115
Yes, it's true.

736
00:51:12,929 --> 00:51:14,648
Hey there, are you OK?

737
00:51:15,859 --> 00:51:17,210
Hey!

738
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:21,390
It was him alright.

739
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,030
The one you were looking for!

740
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,940
The one in the phone booth!

741
00:52:06,836 --> 00:52:10,140
Seo-yeon, come! We need to discuss
what to do.

742
00:52:10,312 --> 00:52:12,112
We've been waiting for you.

743
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:24,525
That was the last witness Prosecutor
submitted.

744
00:52:25,321 --> 00:52:26,921
Now what do we do?

745
00:52:27,547 --> 00:52:30,524
Well, we'll be expelled tomorrow.

746
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:34,039
- We better stop the trial.
- So just end it here?

747
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:36,555
Should I tell the jury to start
deliberation?

748
00:52:37,024 --> 00:52:38,172
No.

749
00:52:39,024 --> 00:52:40,624
I found him.

750
00:52:41,141 --> 00:52:43,341
The male student from that night.

751
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,023
I'll put him on the stand.

752
00:52:48,931 --> 00:52:52,797
I want to hear everything that was
hidden from us so far.

753
00:52:53,235 --> 00:52:54,835
I have to know why.

754
00:52:56,681 --> 00:52:59,891
He's our last witness.

755
00:53:04,555 --> 00:53:06,078
One more day.

756
00:53:06,102 --> 00:53:07,836
Just give me one more day.

757
00:53:12,587 --> 00:53:15,653
So I can prepare for the next trial
session.

758
00:53:16,165 --> 00:53:18,930
I just need one more day, today.

759
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,430
I feel so drained today.

760
00:53:31,868 --> 00:53:33,935
The prosecutors seem down, too.

761
00:53:34,071 --> 00:53:36,477
It'd be weird if you were actually
happy as usual.

762
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:40,118
Is that right?
Well, that's a good thing for me.

763
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,743
I'll get going first.

764
00:53:41,766 --> 00:53:43,366
Do well tomorrow!

765
00:53:43,906 --> 00:53:45,125
See ya.

766
00:53:45,149 --> 00:53:47,483
Wait for me, we're on the same bus!

767
00:53:47,704 --> 00:53:49,304
Bye!

768
00:53:54,071 --> 00:53:55,671
Joon-young!

769
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:08,171
Thank you.

770
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:12,024
This is nothing, I'm your dad!

771
00:54:13,663 --> 00:54:14,992
Joon-young.

772
00:54:15,016 --> 00:54:16,616
Won't you come home now?

773
00:54:18,532 --> 00:54:19,922
I...

774
00:54:19,938 --> 00:54:21,672
- I'm still...
- It's OK.

775
00:54:24,509 --> 00:54:27,094
Mom's not home.

776
00:54:30,173 --> 00:54:33,706
We decided to spend some time
apart from each other.

777
00:54:34,845 --> 00:54:38,778
We need to think about if we can continue
living this way.

778
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,109
She agreed to it, too.

779
00:54:45,993 --> 00:54:48,193
After your brother died that way,

780
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:51,454
it was hard for me to see her
being sick, too.

781
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,805
I wasn't living each day, I was just
persevering.

782
00:54:56,766 --> 00:55:00,321
It's not that it justifies my leaving
you alone that way.

783
00:55:03,141 --> 00:55:04,741
I'm really sorry.

784
00:55:07,384 --> 00:55:10,946
I didn't know you were having that hard
of a time, to think such thoughts.

785
00:55:12,087 --> 00:55:13,687
I'm sorry.

786
00:55:14,993 --> 00:55:16,593
But for me...

787
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:19,899
I want to start up our family
all over again.

788
00:55:20,306 --> 00:55:22,239
I want to go back to the time

789
00:55:23,626 --> 00:55:26,969
that we were all OK, just as your
brother remembered.

790
00:55:28,423 --> 00:55:30,023
Can we try it?

791
00:55:33,149 --> 00:55:34,749
Dad...

792
00:56:01,352 --> 00:56:03,375
Did you know Lee So-woo?

793
00:56:03,891 --> 00:56:05,491
No.

794
00:56:06,634 --> 00:56:09,250
Prosecutor is imagining things.

795
00:56:09,423 --> 00:56:12,266
Someone had called So-woo from
pay phones.

796
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:13,890
- Five times.
- So?

797
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:16,398
Did you find out?

798
00:56:28,587 --> 00:56:29,828
Yes?

799
00:56:39,352 --> 00:56:41,752
What's happened? Is something wrong?

800
00:56:44,102 --> 00:56:45,586
Yoo-jin.

801
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,210
Unfair admission...

802
00:56:48,016 --> 00:56:49,616
It's true.

803
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,327
My dad and the principal are friends.

804
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:56,766
They paid money so I can be in this school.

805
00:56:57,431 --> 00:57:00,164
Lee Yoo-jin, why are you telling us this?

806
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:05,453
I saw the list earlier, your birthday was
there!

807
00:57:05,477 --> 00:57:08,555
I was going to just forget it,
why did you bring it up?

808
00:57:08,665 --> 00:57:09,665
Soo-hee...

809
00:57:10,243 --> 00:57:11,516
Just forget it.

810
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,149
This never happened.

811
00:57:13,251 --> 00:57:16,571
Let's just say that you got lucky in
the admission exam,

812
00:57:16,595 --> 00:57:19,063
and you're just not so good in school.

813
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:21,055
I don't know any of this, and you
don't know either.

814
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:23,146
How can we pretend not to know?

815
00:57:23,883 --> 00:57:26,032
It hurt other students.

816
00:57:27,337 --> 00:57:30,789
Someone must've not made the cutoff
because of me.

817
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:33,196
A student who deserved to be admitted.

818
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:36,399
I pushed that person aside and I got myself
in, though I'm wasn't qualified.

819
00:57:36,509 --> 00:57:38,109
I'm stupid!

820
00:57:39,016 --> 00:57:40,539
And I don't even put in the effort!

821
00:57:40,563 --> 00:57:44,899
But I'm the same Jeong-guk student as you
are, because my family is rich!

822
00:57:45,024 --> 00:57:47,969
I feel so ashamed and I feel so bad
for them.

823
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:51,203
How can I just ignored it?

824
00:57:51,227 --> 00:57:52,836
You're such a fool!

825
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,664
Did you ask to come to this school?

826
00:57:54,688 --> 00:57:57,288
Your parents did that behind your back!

827
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:58,953
How can that be your fault?

828
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:01,377
Why should you feel bad and ashamed?

829
00:58:03,251 --> 00:58:05,184
I'll go and testify tomorrow.

830
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:08,086
I'll admit that it's true.

831
00:58:09,806 --> 00:58:12,606
I'll testify that I was admitted that way.

832
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,140
I'll say it all.

833
00:58:15,649 --> 00:58:16,516
Yoo-jin.

834
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,993
No one can deny it if I admit it.

835
00:58:22,454 --> 00:58:26,921
It needs to be exposed so a case like mine
can never happen again.

836
00:58:27,993 --> 00:58:31,414
That's how people who were responsible
will no longer be there.

837
00:58:32,423 --> 00:58:34,023
Isn't that right?

838
00:59:35,345 --> 00:59:36,945
I'm sorry I'm late.

839
00:59:37,759 --> 00:59:39,625
I needed some time to think.

840
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:41,429
I...

841
00:59:41,649 --> 00:59:43,516
Was even more late than you.

842
01:00:00,595 --> 01:00:02,195
Seo-yeon!

843
01:00:03,915 --> 01:00:06,735
Seo-yeon, you'll be home all day
from starting tomorrow?

844
01:00:06,759 --> 01:00:07,930
You're lucky!

845
01:00:07,954 --> 01:00:09,633
I want to be expelled, too!

846
01:00:09,657 --> 01:00:12,391
She's about to be expelled,
not quite yet!

847
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:15,914
If you're jealous, then you should
just get in trouble, too!

848
01:00:16,235 --> 01:00:18,375
Mom! They should be in trouble!

849
01:00:18,399 --> 01:00:20,133
They're speaking nonsense!

850
01:00:20,337 --> 01:00:21,937
Hey guys!

851
01:00:22,759 --> 01:00:24,875
You all need to wash up!

852
01:00:24,899 --> 01:00:27,235
Otherwise we have to go to the dentist
again!

853
01:00:29,095 --> 01:00:31,361
Make sure you're completely clean!

854
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,070
I'll see you.

855
01:00:36,868 --> 01:00:38,468
You'll do great!

856
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:49,891
(The last day of trial)

857
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,852
(Notice: The students involved in the
trial club are suspended for 6 days)

858
01:01:05,891 --> 01:01:07,383
Hello.

859
01:01:07,407 --> 01:01:11,672
I am Kim Min-seok, and I'll be the
presiding judge of this trial.

860
01:01:11,696 --> 01:01:15,438
Thank you for attending this school trial.

861
01:01:16,095 --> 01:01:17,695
Please be seated.

862
01:01:22,149 --> 01:01:24,483
Today's the last day of this trial.

863
01:01:25,571 --> 01:01:28,422
After the last witness testimony, each side
will give their final argument.

864
01:01:28,446 --> 01:01:33,368
And when the jury goes into deliberation,
there will be no more school trial.

865
01:01:33,548 --> 01:01:35,414
We'll begin the examination.

866
01:01:38,852 --> 01:01:40,586
- Witness...
- But first!

867
01:01:41,274 --> 01:01:43,208
I have something to tell you.

868
01:01:51,938 --> 01:01:55,338
The person I am about to examine is
not a witness.

869
01:01:55,493 --> 01:01:58,026
He is the new defendant of this trial.

870
01:01:59,931 --> 01:02:04,094
The defendant is a party directly involved
in this case, though he has been in hiding.

871
01:02:04,212 --> 01:02:08,412
But he mustered up a great amount
of courage to be here today.

872
01:02:09,704 --> 01:02:12,211
Until the defendant is done
with the examination process,

873
01:02:12,235 --> 01:02:16,977
I ask that you'd watch in silence without
any remarks.

874
01:02:22,774 --> 01:02:24,708
Defense Counsel, Han Ji-hoon.

875
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:32,274
Please sit in the defendant's seat.

876
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:36,883
- Ji-hoon!
- Seo-yeon! What are you doing?

877
01:02:36,899 --> 01:02:38,899
Why does he need to sit there?

878
01:02:57,688 --> 01:02:59,563
I'll ask you directly.

879
01:03:01,173 --> 01:03:03,573
On the night that Lee So-woo died...

880
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,880
Where were you and what were you doing?

881
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,907
I was with So-woo on top of the school
building.

882
01:03:20,571 --> 01:03:22,704
What should you be charged with?

883
01:03:25,688 --> 01:03:28,266
The murder of Lee So-woo.

884
01:03:30,212 --> 01:03:33,211
(Solomon's Perjury)

885
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:29,836
(Strong Woman, Doh Bong-soon,
Coming February 24th)
