{2942}{2999}Tina...
{3158}{3198}Tina!
{3366}{3416}Tina...
{6707}{6748}You OK, Tina?
{6749}{6843}Just a dream, Ma.
{6844}{6917}Some dream, judging from that.
{7095}{7170}You coming back|to the sack or what?
{7171}{7222}Hold your horses.
{7315}{7394}Tina, honey, you got|to cut your fingernails...
{7395}{7467}or you got to stop|that kind of dreaming.
{7468}{7500}One or the other.
{7790}{7856}One...two...
{7857}{7953}Freddy's coming for you.
{7954}{8018}Three...four...
{8019}{8110}Better lock your door.
{8111}{8170}Five...six...
{8171}{8257}Grab your crucifix.
{8258}{8311}Seven...eight...
{8312}{8400}Gonna stay up late.
{8401}{8460}Nine...ten...
{8461}{8511}Never sleep again...
{8512}{8546}lt was so scary.
{8547}{8602}When l woke up...
{8603}{8659}it seemed like he was still|in the room with me.
{8660}{8696}Sounds like a real bogeyman.
{8697}{8770}''One...two...|Freddy's coming for you.''
{8771}{8864}That's what it reminded me of--|that old jump rope song.
{8865}{8909}lt was|the worst nightmare l ever had.
{8910}{8952}You wouldn't believe it.
{8953}{9030}As a matter of fact, l had|a bad dream last night myself.
{9031}{9114}l had a hard-on this morning|when l woke up, Tina.
{9115}{9164}Had your name|written all over it.
{9165}{9220}There's four letters|in my name, Rod.
{9221}{9326}How could there be room|on your joint for four letters?
{9327}{9409}Hey! Up yours|with a twirling lawnmower.
{9410}{9469}Rod says the sweetest things.
{9470}{9509}He's nuts about you.
{9510}{9568}Yeah, nuts. Anyway...
{9569}{9646}l couldn't go back|to sleep last night.
{9647}{9705}So, what did you dream?
{9706}{9750}Forget it, Tina.
{9751}{9815}The point is that everyone has|a bad dream once in a while.
{9816}{9853}lt's no biggie.
{9854}{9906}Next time you're having one,|just tell yourself...
{9907}{9960}that's all it is|right while you're having it.
{9961}{10010}Once you do that,|you wake right up.
{10011}{10081}At least, it works for me.
{10216}{10259}Did you have a nightmare, too?
{10377}{10438}Maybe we're going|to have a big earthquake.
{10439}{10510}They say things get|really weird just before.
{10724}{10797}l'm so glad you guys|could come over tonight.
{10798}{10878}When my mom said she was taking|off for two days, l almost died.
{10879}{10976}No problem, Tina.|Nancy and Glen to the rescue.
{10977}{11081}l can't believe his mother's|letting him spend the night.
{11082}{11183}Right, well...she's not exactly.
{11223}{11300}See, l got this cousin|who lives near the airport.
{11301}{11341}lt's OKfor me|to stay with him.
{11342}{11414}And l got this|sound effects tape from Rod--
{11415}{11505}Hello, Mom?
{11506}{11564}Yeah. Out here at Barry's.
{11665}{11721}Yeah, noisy as usual.
{11722}{11778}Glad we don't live here, huh?
{11779}{11839}Aunt Eunice says hello.
{11887}{11961}l'll call you in the morning.
{11962}{12009}Yeah, sure--
{12086}{12192}Just some kids drag racing|outside, l think, Mom.
{12193}{12244}Listen, Mom. l gotta go.
{12245}{12302}l think there's been|an accident out front.
{12480}{12538}All right, l'll call the police.
{12569}{12647}l'll call the police!
{12648}{12722}Just some neighbors having|a fight, l guess.
{12723}{12757}l'm fine.
{12758}{12801}l'll call you in the morning.
{13044}{13081}lt worked like a charm.
{13082}{13123}Smooth.
{13124}{13159}Jesus.
{13202}{13264}See? l told you|you'd be feeling better.
{13323}{13442}All day long l've been seeing|that guy's weird face...
{13443}{13512}and hearing those fingernails.
{13513}{13597}Fingernails?
{13598}{13652}That's amazing you saying that.
{13653}{13748}That made me remember|the dream l had last night.
{13749}{13796}What did you dream?
{13797}{13916}l dreamed about a guy in|a dirty red and green sweater.
{13957}{14073}What about the fingernails?
{14074}{14180}He scraped his fingernails|along things.
{14181}{14253}Actually, they were more like|finger-knives...
{14254}{14324}something he made himself.
{14325}{14399}But they made a horrible sound.
{14400}{14441}lt was like...
{14524}{14603}You dreamed|about the same creep l did.
{14657}{14703}That's impossible.
{14796}{14827}What?
{14861}{14914}Nothing.
{14915}{14986}There's something out there,|isn't there?
{14987}{15037}l didn't hear anything.
{15038}{15106}l heard something.
{16137}{16211}l'm going to punch out|your lights, whoever you are.
{16356}{16398}Kitty, kitty.
{16611}{16658}Chow, chow, chow?
{16850}{16901}lt's Rod Lane|bringing Lantz down...
{16902}{16973}just three yards|from the goal line!
{16974}{17055}What a brilliant tackle,|and the fans go wild!
{17056}{17096}What the hell|are you doing here?
{17097}{17188}Came to make up. No big deal.
{17189}{17219}Your mom home?
{17220}{17318}Of course. What's that?
{17319}{17355}lntense, huh?
{17480}{17553}What's going on here,|an orgy or something?
{17554}{17611}Maybe a funeral, dickhead.
{17612}{17691}lt's just|a sleep-over date, Rod.
{17692}{17782}Tina and me.|Glen was just leaving.
{17846}{17883}Did you see his face?
{17927}{18034}Your mom ain't home, is she?
{18035}{18104}Me and Tina|got stuff to discuss.
{18209}{18268}We got her mother's bed.
{18269}{18318}You guys got the rest.
{18436}{18525}l think we should|get out of here.
{18526}{18609}You guys are going|to hang around, right?
{18610}{18702}Don't leave me alone|with this lunatic.
{18703}{18769}Please, Nancy?
{18932}{18996}Glen, not now.
{19050}{19131}We're here for Tina now,|not ourselves.
{19235}{19316}Why is she so bothered|by a stupid nightmare anyway?
{19317}{19411}Because he was scary,|that's why!
{20596}{20680}Morality sucks.
{21035}{21112}l knew there was something|about you l liked.
{21113}{21171}You feel better now?
{21172}{21236}Jungle man fix Jane.
{21290}{21327}No more fights?
{21389}{21428}No more fights.
{21499}{21570}No more nightmares|for either one of us, then.
{21623}{21661}When did you have a nightmare?
{21780}{21853}Guys can have nightmares, too,|you know.
{21854}{21936}You ain't got a corner|on the market.
{24882}{24991}Who do you think you are?
{24992}{25082}Whoever you are.
{27181}{27231}Somebody there?
{27894}{27941}Who the hell is that?
{28797}{28833}Shit.
{29150}{29188}Please, God--
{29189}{29257}This...
{29258}{29289}is God.
{29965}{30004}Watch this.
{30318}{30415}Nancy! Open the door!
{30813}{30855}Rod, help me!
{31033}{31085}Help me, Rod!
{32595}{32677}Who did this? l'll kill you!
{32678}{32709}Who did this?
{32710}{32782}You scared me!
{33293}{33327}What have you got?
{33328}{33399}Her name was Tina Gray.|lt was her home.
{33400}{33451}Father abandoned, 10 years ago.
{33452}{33483}Mother's in Vegas|with a boyfriend.
{33484}{33517}We're trying to reach her now.
{33518}{33567}What's the coroner got?
{33568}{33642}Something like a razor|was the weapon...
{33643}{33709}but nothing was found|at the scene.
{33710}{33780}lt looks like|the victim's boyfriend.
{33781}{33812}Lieutenant, where is she?
{33813}{33848}l put her in your office.
{33849}{33893}His name's Rod Lane.
{33894}{33940}He's a musician type.
{33941}{34026}He's been arrested for drugs,|brawling.
{34027}{34083}Terrific. What the hell was she|doing there?
{34084}{34113}She lived there.
{34114}{34234}l don't mean her.
{34235}{34301}l mean you.
{34302}{34402}What was she doing there?
{34403}{34471}Hello to you, too, Donald.
{34472}{34539}Marge. OK.
{34712}{34754}How you doing, baby?
{34755}{34878}l'm OK, Dad.
{34879}{34938}Look, l don't want to get|into this now.
{34939}{34983}God knows you need time.
{34984}{35028}But l sure would like to know|what the hell you were doing...
{35029}{35149}shacking up with three kids|in the middle of the night...
{35150}{35219}especially a lunatic|delinquent like Lane.
{35220}{35303}Rod is not a lunatic, Dad.
{35304}{35361}You have a sane explanation|for what he did?
{35435}{35508}Apparently,|he was crazy jealous.
{35509}{35578}Nancy said they'd had a fight.
{35579}{35632}lt wasn't that serious.
{35633}{35714}Maybe you don't think|murder is serious.
{35715}{35799}How can you say l don't|take her death seriously?
{35835}{35938}Look, all l meant...
{36031}{36105}was that their fights|weren't that serious.
{36254}{36362}You know Tina dreamed|this was going to happen.
{36363}{36407}What?
{36408}{36620}She'd had a nightmare that|someone was trying to kill her.
{36621}{36742}That's why we were there, Mom.
{36743}{36791}She just didn't want|to sleep alone.
{37006}{37099}Police say the victim,|15-year-old Christina Gray...
{37100}{37211}had quarreled earlier|with her boyfriend Rod Lane.
{37212}{37293}Lane is now the subject|of a citywide manhunt.
{37294}{37338}The murder weapon...
{37339}{37408}a straight razor or similar|sharp object, has not yet--
{37517}{37632}Where do you think you're going?
{37633}{37678}To school.
{37679}{37747}Honey, you were tossing and|turning all night last night.
{37748}{37814}You have no business|going to school today.
{37815}{37867}l've got to go to school,|Mother.
{37868}{37918}Otherwise, l'll sit up there|and go crazy.
{37919}{37973}Did you sleep?
{37974}{38100}l'll sleep in study hall.
{38101}{38192}l'd rather keep busy.
{38193}{38251}Right home after?
{38252}{38312}Right home after.
{38352}{38387}See you.
{39540}{39638}l'm not going to hurt you!
{39732}{39783}They're going|to kill me for sure.
{39784}{39845}Nobody's going to kill you.
{39922}{39954}Did you do it?
{39998}{40034}l never touched her.
{40035}{40105}You were screaming like crazy.
{40106}{40163}There was somebody else there.
{40164}{40235}The door was locked|from your side!
{40236}{40304}Don't look at me|like l'm some fucking fruitcake!
{40305}{40355}l'm warning you!
{40356}{40452}Just move away from her, son.
{40453}{40547}Real easy, like your ass|depended on it.
{40548}{40590}Hold it!
{40629}{40677}Jesus Christ!
{40938}{40975}Hold it right there!
{40976}{41027}Watch it!
{41028}{41057}l'm cool!
{41058}{41087}l got him.
{41088}{41117}On the ground! Now!
{41118}{41160}Come on! Get down!
{41161}{41215}Lieutenant, look at this!|A switchblade!
{41216}{41297}l didn't do it!|l didn't kill her, Nancy!
{41298}{41341}Daddy?
{41342}{41403}You used me.
{41404}{41458}What the hell were you doing...
{41459}{41505}going to school today for|anyway?
{41707}{41748}Let go of my arm !
{41749}{41868}What is seen|is not always what is real.
{41880}{41947}According to Shakespeare,|there was something operating...
{41948}{42163}in nature, perhaps inside human|nature itself, that was rotten.
{42164}{42268}''A canker,'' as he put it.
{42270}{42347}Of course,|Hamlet's response to this...
{42348}{42541}and to his mother's lies was to|continually probe and dig.
{42542}{42627}Just like the gravediggers...
{42628}{42728}always trying to get|beneath the surface.
{42729}{42773}The same is true|in a different way...
{42774}{42803}in Julius Caesar.
{42805}{42847}John, will you go ahead, please?
{43108}{43179}''ln the most high|and palmy state of Rome...
{43197}{43297}''A little ere|the mightiest Julius fell.
{43298}{43342}''The grave stood tenantless...
{43343}{43408}''and the sheeted dead|did squeak and gibber...
{43409}{43466}''in the Roman streets.
{43467}{43555}''As stars with trains|of fire and dues of blood...
{43556}{43627}''disaster's in the sun|and the moist air...
{43628}{43723}''upon whose influence|Neptune's empire stands...''
{44069}{44131}''Oh, God, l could be|bounded in a nutshell...
{44132}{44312}''and count myself|a king of infinite space...
{44313}{44464}''were it not|that l have bad dreams.''
{45857}{45901}Where's your pass?
{45903}{45974}Screw your pass.
{46089}{46138}Hey, Nancy!
{46139}{46240}No running in the hallway.
{48666}{48712}Who are you?
{50116}{50195}Gonna get you.
{50466}{50507}lt's only a dream !
{50508}{50586}Come to Freddy.
{50587}{50636}God damn you!
{50900}{50996}OK! OK! Thompson!
{50997}{51082}l'll call your mother.
{51083}{51149}Everything is all right now.
{51150}{51192}Come on. Sit down.
{51318}{51366}l'm OK.
{51367}{51396}l'm fine.
{51397}{51436}You sure?
{51437}{51526}l'll go straight home.
{51527}{51581}You'll need a hall pass.
{51692}{51724}Back to work.
{53357}{53398}And then what happened?
{53399}{53499}l told you.
{53500}{53583}lt was dark, but l'm sure|there was somebody in there...
{53584}{53627}under the covers with her.
{53628}{53709}How could somebody be under|the covers with you guys...
{53710}{53753}without you knowing about it?
{53754}{53830}How the fuck do l know?
{53831}{53919}l don't expect you|to believe me anyway.
{53972}{54019}What did he look like?
{54075}{54134}Did you get a look at him?
{54274}{54351}Then how do you know|that somebody else was there?
{54399}{54464}Because somebody cut her|while l watched.
{54465}{54532}And you didn't get a look|at him?
{54533}{54624}l couldn't even see the fucker.
{54625}{54714}You could just see...
{54715}{54775}cuts happening...
{54776}{54811}all at once.
{54812}{54949}What do you mean all at once?
{54950}{55136}lt was as if|there were four razors...
{55137}{55232}cutting her at the same time...
{55233}{55283}but invisible ones.
{55284}{55453}You know, l probably|could have saved her...
{55454}{55502}if l'd have moved sooner.
{55566}{55668}But l thought it was|just another nightmare...
{55669}{55747}like the one l had|the night before.
{55833}{55910}There was this guy.
{56001}{56063}He had knives for fingers.
{56397}{56451}You think l did it?
{57055}{57107}One...two...
{57108}{57204}Freddy's coming for you.
{57205}{57258}Three...four...
{57259}{57368}Better lock your door.
{57369}{57431}Five...six...
{57432}{57546}Grab your crucifix.
{57547}{57576}Seven...eight...
{57577}{57772}Gonna stay up late.
{57773}{57835}Nine...ten...
{57836}{57974}Never sleep...again.
{58476}{58505}What, Mother?
{58507}{58570}Don't fall asleep in there.
{58571}{58609}You could drown, you know.
{58610}{58665}Oh, for Pete's sakes.
{58666}{58709}lt happens all the time.
{58710}{58768}l've heated up|some warm milk for you, honey.
{58769}{58843}Warm milk?
{58844}{58873}Gross.
{59798}{59866}Help!
{60329}{60368}Hold on, baby!
{60369}{60416}Mom !
{60571}{60600}l'm OK.
{60601}{60691}-You're OK?|-l'm OK.
{60692}{60771}But l heard you screaming.|You were calling me.
{60772}{60878}l just slipped getting out|of the tub, Mom.
{60879}{60920}But l told you...
{60921}{60990}hundreds of people a year|get killed like that, honey.
{60991}{61051}l know, but l'm OK, Mother.
{61052}{61104}l'm sorry for scaring you.
{61152}{61211}l'll turn down your bed.
{61212}{61269}l'll get my pajamas on.
{61945}{62034}...the act of|bodily dismemberment.
{63276}{63334}l'm sorry.|l saw your light was on.
{63335}{63383}l thought l'd see how you were.
{63384}{63463}Sometimes l wish you didn't live|right across the street.
{63464}{63502}Will you shut up and let me in?
{63503}{63585}Did you ever stand on a trellis|in your bare feet?
{63586}{63668}Get inside before|somebody sees you.
{63669}{63713}l hit my head.
{63714}{63775}Gotta be quiet.|Mom's not even asleep yet.
{63922}{63951}lf you don't mind.
{64218}{64287}So, l heard you freaked out|in English class today.
{64288}{64345}Yeah, l guess l did.
{64346}{64412}You haven't slept yet, have you?
{64413}{64472}Not really.
{64474}{64533}What did you do to your arm?
{64534}{64608}l burned it in English class.
{64776}{64850}Oh, God. l look 20 years old.
{64977}{65043}Did you have|any weird dreams last night?
{65044}{65090}Slept like a rock.
{65091}{65143}Do you believe that people...
{65144}{65208}can dream about|what's going to happen?
{65314}{65343}No.
{65344}{65393}Do you believe in the bogeyman?
{65394}{65443}No.
{65444}{65497}Rod killed Tina,|and you know that.
{65569}{65625}l've got a crazy favor|to ask you.
{65655}{65708}lt's nothing hard or anything.
{65709}{65864}l'm gonna go and look|for somebody...
{65865}{65997}and l want you to stand...|like a sort of a guard, OK?
{66176}{66249}Now, you can't mess up.
{66250}{66297}A lot might depend on this.
{66298}{66353}l won't screw up.
{66354}{66405}Turn off the light.
{66559}{66624}Here's what we're going to do.
{66625}{66669}lt's dark in here.
{66670}{66749}And it's not|what you're thinking.
{68334}{68378}Are you still watching?
{68455}{68500}Yeah. So?
{68502}{68535}l'm just checking.
{71754}{71806}Watch out!
{71849}{71878}Watch out!
{72752}{72826}Wake up!
{72875}{72962}Are you there?
{72963}{73012}l'm here.
{73902}{74009}Nancy, help me, please.
{74010}{74049}Save me from--
{74050}{74090}Freddy!
{74389}{74440}This is just a dream.
{74441}{74478}This isn't real.
{74479}{74523}This is just a dream.
{74525}{74579}He isn't real.
{76094}{76196}Glen, you bastard.
{76197}{76240}What did l do?
{76241}{76311}l just|asked you to do one thing...
{76312}{76377}just stay awake and watch me...
{76378}{76496}just wake me up if it looked|like l was having a bad dream...
{76497}{76538}and what did you do?
{76539}{76594}You shit.
{76595}{76636}You fell asleep.
{76682}{76711}Oh, shit.
{76713}{76764}Hurry.
{76790}{76877}Shut up and stay there.|Don't go away.
{77040}{77073}Are you OK?
{77074}{77163}Yeah. lt was just|a little dream, that's all.
{77164}{77233}l'm going right back to sleep.
{77234}{77300}Call me if you need anything.
{77833}{77908}You mind telling me|what's going on?
{77910}{77962}Just come on.
{78013}{78136}Garcia, l've got to see|Rod Lane again.
{78137}{78186}You know,|l took the night shift...
{78187}{78245}so l could get|some peace and quiet.
{78246}{78282}lt's urgent!
{78785}{78839}We have reason to believe|that there might be...
{78840}{78894}something very strange|going on here.
{78895}{78943}Got no argument with that.
{78944}{78996}What are you doing here?
{78997}{79041}There's an unsolved murder...
{79042}{79092}and l don't like|unsolved murders...
{79093}{79159}especially ones that|my daughter's mixed up in.
{79160}{79201}What are you doing here?
{79202}{79254}At this hour,|you should be home in bed.
{79255}{79306}l just want to see if he's OK.
{79307}{79370}Nancy, take my word for it.
{79371}{79415}The guy's sleeping like a baby.
{79417}{79454}He's not going anywhere.
{79699}{79757}Just go down and look at him.
{79833}{79870}Please, Daddy.
{79926}{79968}All right.
{79969}{80038}Garcia, give me the keys.
{80039}{80083}Right.
{80117}{80188}Where the hell|did l put the keys?
{80712}{80798}Help! Help!
{81087}{81118}Jesus!
{81337}{81379}Cut him down.
{81425}{81468}Grab his legs.
{81469}{81524}l got him.
{81686}{81744}Grab his back, would you?
{81745}{81781}Lower him.
{82511}{82553}Ashes to ashes...
{82554}{82597}Dust to dust.
{82598}{82673}May God be|with this young man's soul.
{82747}{82822}His life and his death...
{82824}{82920}attest to|the scriptures' warning...
{82921}{83025}that he who lives by the sword|shall die by the sword.
{83027}{83130}But let us recall also|our Lord's admonition...
{83131}{83314}that we judge not,|lest we be judged.
{83315}{83403}And may Rod Lane rest in peace.
{83568}{83620}Time to go, honey.
{83831}{83861}Hop in.
{83960}{84021}The killer's still loose,|you know?
{84022}{84125}You're saying somebody else|killed Tina?
{84127}{84158}Who?
{84159}{84262}l don't know who he is...
{84264}{84389}but he's burned,|and he wears a weird hat...
{84390}{84530}and a red and green sweater,|really dirty...
{84531}{84647}and he uses these knives,|like giant fingernails.
{84762}{84829}You better keep her home|for a few days...
{84830}{84875}until she really gets|over the shock of this.
{84877}{84921}l've got something better.
{84922}{84996}l'm going to get her some help.
{85741}{85812}l don't see why you couldn't|just give me a pill...
{85813}{85851}to keep me from dreaming.
{85852}{85914}Everyone's got to dream,|young lady.
{85915}{86023}lf you don't dream, you go.
{86024}{86059}All set.
{86117}{86219}Please, Nancy, trust us.
{86220}{86315}lt's not you l don't trust.|lt's just...
{86570}{86644}Let's do it.
{86795}{86842}Thank you, nurse.
{87368}{87420}How long has this been going on?
{87421}{87490}Since the murders.
{87491}{87551}She was fine before that.
{87553}{87627}Now she thinks|her dreams are real.
{87629}{87739}There's no sign|of pathology in her EEG.
{87740}{87820}l'd guess that what we have|is just a normal girl...
{87821}{87889}who happens to have gone|through two days of hell.
{88166}{88240}She's asleep now.
{88241}{88304}Thank God.
{88409}{88489}What the hell are dreams anyway?
{88490}{88526}Mysteries.
{88527}{88597}lncredible body hocus-pocus.
{88598}{88682}The truth is we still|don't know what they are...
{88683}{88755}or where they come from.
{88993}{89080}She's going into deep sleep now.
{89170}{89225}Heart rate is a little high.
{89226}{89286}lt's just due to anxiety.
{89288}{89354}Otherwise, she's nicely relaxed.
{89355}{89414}All signs are normal.
{89416}{89490}She could dream at any time now.
{89599}{89659}Beta waves are slowing.
{89803}{89889}She's into REMs now.
{89890}{89947}She's definitely dreaming now.
{89948}{90037}lt's a good one, too.
{90039}{90100}Typical dream parameter.
{90101}{90258}A nightmare now would be|plus or minus five or six.
{90259}{90357}She's about three.
{90564}{90608}Doctor, what's she doing now?
{90609}{90680}ls she asleep or awake?
{90681}{90755}Something's wrong.|lt never gets this high.
{90785}{90821}What's she doing?
{90822}{90863}l don't know.
{90864}{90905}ls she dreaming?
{91145}{91224}Nancy, it's Mom !
{91345}{91377}What?
{91378}{91419}Her hair.
{91420}{91450}Excuse me.
{91452}{91490}This'll help you sleep.
{91587}{91621}Oh, my God, her arm !
{91622}{91655}Get something.
{91656}{91715}What happened, baby?
{91717}{91766}What happened?
{91871}{91916}lt's OK.
{91993}{92093}l brought something out|from my dream.
{92094}{92153}Where did you get that?
{92200}{92275}l grabbed it off his head.
{92701}{92810}She said she grabbed it off|his head in her dream.
{92811}{92857}No, l'm not crazy.
{92859}{92939}l'm holding the damn thing|right here in my hand.
{92940}{93011}l don't know where|she really found it.
{93012}{93056}l gotta go.
{93408}{93504}You didn't sleep at all|last night, did you?
{93505}{93602}You know the doctor says|you have to sleep, or--
{93603}{93667}l'll go even crazier?
{93668}{93719}l don't think you're crazy.
{93720}{93795}And stop drinking|that damn coffee.
{93908}{94062}So, did you ask Daddy|to have the hat examined?
{94063}{94173}l threw that filthy thing away.
{94174}{94218}l don't know|where you really found it...
{94220}{94253}or what you're trying to prove.
{94254}{94325}What l learned|in the dream clinic...
{94326}{94400}that's what l'm trying|to prove, Mother.
{94401}{94549}Rod didn't kill Tina,|and he didn't hang himself.
{94550}{94634}lt's this guy.
{94635}{94727}He's after us in our dreams.
{94833}{94923}That's just not reality, Nancy.
{94925}{94969}lt's real, Mama.
{94971}{95016}Feel it.
{95018}{95069}Give me that damn thing.
{95070}{95130}lt even has his name|written in it.
{95132}{95196}Fred Krueger, Mom.
{95271}{95351}Do you know who that is, Mother?
{95352}{95399}Because if you do,|you better tell me...
{95400}{95445}because he's after me now.
{95447}{95557}Nancy, trust your mother|for once, please.
{95558}{95628}You'll feel better|when you get some sleep.
{95629}{95681}Feel better?
{95682}{95752}You call this feeling better?
{95792}{95911}Or maybe l should grab that|bottle and veg out with you.
{95913}{96016}Avoid everything happening to me|by just getting good and loaded.
{96231}{96334}Fred Krueger|can't come after you, Nancy.
{96335}{96368}He's dead.
{96369}{96419}Believe me.
{96420}{96454}l know.
{96455}{96565}You knew about him|all this time...
{96566}{96684}and you've been acting like|it was something l made up?
{96686}{96757}Nancy, you're sick.
{96758}{96800}There's something wrong|with you.
{96801}{96878}You're imagining things.
{96879}{96926}You'll feel better|when you sleep.
{96927}{97004}lt's just as simple as that.
{97005}{97042}Screw sleep!
{97257}{97331}lt's just a nightmare.
{97332}{97375}That's enough.
{97656}{97740}Whenever l get nervous, l eat.
{97741}{97830}And if you can't do that,|you sleep.
{97831}{97895}l used to.
{97896}{97935}Not anymore.
{98045}{98178}Did you ever read about|the Balinese way of dreaming?
{98253}{98374}They got this whole system|they call dream skills.
{98376}{98487}So if you have a nightmare,|for instance, like falling.
{98488}{98521}Right.
{98522}{98649}Well, instead of screaming|and getting all nuts...
{98650}{98779}you say, ''l'm going|to make up my mind...
{98780}{98828}''that l fall|into a magic world.''
{98829}{98968}Make it something special|like a poem or a song.
{98969}{99053}They get all their art|and literature from dreams.
{99054}{99084}Just wake up and write it down.
{99086}{99135}Dream skills.
{99136}{99255}What if they meet a monster|in their dreams?
{99257}{99302}They turn their back on it.
{99304}{99360}Take away its energy,|and it disappears.
{99361}{99460}But what happens|if they don't do that?
{99461}{99584}Then l guess those people don't|wake up to tell what happens.
{99585}{99621}Great.
{99739}{99835}''Booby Traps & lmprovised|Anti-Personnel Devices''?
{99882}{99938}What are you reading that for?
{99939}{100019}l'm into survival.
{100068}{100116}See ya.
{100117}{100188}You're starting to scare me.
{100506}{100561}Oh, gross.
{101438}{101503}Mother!
{101638}{101701}What's with the bars?
{101757}{101792}Security.
{101841}{101904}Security from what?
{101905}{101958}Not from what, from whom.
{102059}{102116}Come down to the cellar with me,|and l'll tell you.
{102757}{102851}You want to know|who Fred Krueger was?
{102852}{102933}He was|a filthy child murderer...
{102934}{103027}who killed at least 20 kids|in the neighborhood.
{103028}{103072}Kids we all knew.
{103126}{103190}Oh, Mom.
{103191}{103295}lt drove us crazy when we|didn't know who it was...
{103297}{103408}but it was even worse|after they caught him.
{103656}{103699}Did they put him away?
{103700}{103794}The lawyers got fat|and the judge got famous...
{103795}{103864}but somebody forgot|to sign the search warrant...
{103865}{103898}in the right place...
{103899}{103950}and Krueger was free|just like that.
{103951}{104038}What did you do, Mother?
{104039}{104150}A bunch of us parents|tracked him down...
{104151}{104211}after they let him out.
{104213}{104301}We found him in|an old abandoned boiler room...
{104302}{104399}where he used to take his kids.
{104400}{104459}Go on.
{104461}{104554}We took gasoline...
{104599}{104677}We poured it|all around the place...
{104678}{104781}and made a trail of it|out the door...
{104782}{104875}then lit the whole thing up|and watched it burn.
{105081}{105177}But he can't get you now.
{105178}{105280}He's dead, honey,|because Mommy killed him.
{105378}{105441}l even took his knives.
{105687}{105761}So it's OK now.
{105858}{105939}You can sleep.
{106309}{106376}Oh, hi, how you doing?
{106377}{106406}Fine.
{106407}{106459}Stand by your window|so l can see you.
{106460}{106512}You sound a million miles away.
{106642}{106708}That's much better.
{106709}{106810}l see your mom went ape|at the security store today.
{106811}{106875}You look like the Prisoner|of Zenda or something.
{106876}{106921}How long's it been|since you slept?
{106923}{106982}lt's coming up|on the seventh day.
{106984}{107043}lt's OK. l checked Guinness.
{107044}{107080}The record's 11.
{107081}{107193}Listen, Glen, l know who he is.
{107194}{107229}Who?
{107230}{107259}The killer.
{107260}{107308}-You do?|-Yes.
{107309}{107411}And if he gets me,|l'm pretty sure you're next.
{107412}{107471}Why would anybody|want to kill me?
{107473}{107502}Don't ask.
{107504}{107582}Just give me some help|nailing the guy...
{107583}{107623}when l bring him out.
{107624}{107666}Bring him out of what?
{107667}{107714}My dream.
{107716}{107794}How do you plan to do that?
{107795}{107840}Just like l did the hat.
{107842}{107916}Have a hold of the sucker|when you wake me up.
{107917}{107989}Wait a minute.
{107990}{108040}You can't bring somebody|out of a dream.
{108041}{108108}lf l can't,|then you can all relax...
{108109}{108174}because it's just a case|of me being nuts.
{108175}{108233}l can save you the trouble.
{108234}{108285}You're nutty as a fruitcake.
{108286}{108320}l love you anyway.
{108321}{108375}Good.
{108376}{108441}Then you won't mind|cold-cocking this guy...
{108442}{108481}when l bring him out.
{108482}{108511}What?
{108513}{108549}You heard me.
{108550}{108600}l grab the guy in my dream.
{108601}{108661}You see me struggling,|so you wake me up.
{108663}{108759}We both come out, you whack|the fucker, and we got him.
{108760}{108813}Are you crazy?|Hit him with what?
{108814}{108852}You're the jock.
{108853}{108916}You have a baseball bat|or something.
{108917}{109043}Just meet me at my porch|at midnight.
{109044}{109089}Oh, and meanwhile...
{109091}{109134}Meanwhile?
{109135}{109298}Whatever you do,|don't fall asleep.
{109375}{109454}Midnight?
{109737}{109788}Oh, man.
{109789}{109842}Midnight.
{109843}{109894}Baseball bats and bogeymen.
{109946}{109984}Beautiful.
{110837}{110871}Honey?
{111256}{111308}How can you listen|to television...
{111309}{111371}and hear your records|at the same time?
{111372}{111435}Oh, l wasn't listening|to the tube, Ma.
{111436}{111490}Just watching.
{111491}{111564}Miss Nude America|is going to be on tonight.
{111565}{111644}How can you hear|what she's going to say?
{111645}{111698}Who cares what she says?
{111699}{111780}Don't be such a smart guy.
{111781}{111834}l want you to go to bed.
{111835}{111907}lt's almost midnight.
{111908}{111969}Goodness knows we've all|had a lot to deal with...
{111971}{112009}these last few days.
{112010}{112039}l will, Mom.
{112041}{112072}You guys turning in?
{112074}{112123}Pretty soon.
{112124}{112169}Now get to bed.
{112493}{112546}lt's over now, baby.
{112547}{112613}The nightmare's over.
{112614}{112648}Please.
{115078}{115137}You shouldn't stare.
{115181}{115240}You know what l think?
{115242}{115346}l think that kid|is some kind of lunatic.
{115348}{115479}You shouldn't talk that way|about that poor child.
{115480}{115533}You mean those bars?
{115534}{115689}Marge is just being cautious|with her being all alone...
{115690}{115814}and Nancy|acting so nervous lately.
{115815}{115876}l don't care what you say.
{115878}{115974}l don't want that kid hanging|around with our son anymore.
{117471}{117544}Glen, answer the phone.
{117741}{117798}Just a minute.
{117799}{117893}lt's her.|She wants to talk to Glen.

{125007}{125072}Lieutenant Thompson,|l'm sorry to wake you...
{125073}{125160}but l've never seen anything|like this before in my life.
{125161}{125192}And l knew|this is your neighborhood...

{127925}{128029}That'll be exactly|half past midnight.

{128212}{128262}Honey, you just do that.
{128263}{128293}Get yourself some sleep.
{128295}{128338}That's what l've been|telling you all along.

{131723}{131786}What has the coroner got to say?

{135822}{135876}What happens if they|don't do that?
