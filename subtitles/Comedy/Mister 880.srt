1
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:13,416
Regardless of what he said, don't make us waver
since we are just barely trying to live on.

2
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:18,436
It's up to us... to live without Yeong Soo.

3
00:00:18,437 --> 00:00:22,136
Who will take that spot?

4
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:23,137
That's not something you should be wo-

5
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:29,417
Can't I do it? Can't I like you, ajumma?

6
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:43,117
Did Yeong Soo tell you to
make me laugh like this?

7
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:49,197
I feels as if I've loved you
long before we ever met.

8
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,656
Why do you like me?

9
00:00:52,657 --> 00:00:57,957
I'm also looking for that reason,
about why I can't hate you.

10
00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:19,356
You said you wanted us to become like
family right? You don't like me,

11
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:23,197
you just need someone by your side.

12
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:27,017
I was like that once before.

13
00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:30,236
You needed someone by your side?

14
00:01:30,237 --> 00:01:35,557
Yes. That's why you feel like
that, you don't like me.

15
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:43,656
Then let's do this. Whether I'm
mistaken or you're mistaken,

16
00:01:43,657 --> 00:01:45,877
let's go out together.

17
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:52,846
You think that I'm a better person that you thought
I was? Be careful that you don't fall for me.

18
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:56,807
Alright, I'll be careful.

19
00:01:58,897 --> 00:02:03,336
Ajumma, I'd like to pay for our table.
Also, can I get chicken feet to-go?

20
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:05,897
You'll have to be really careful.

21
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,617
<i>Episode 10</i>

22
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:21,176
There are a lot of young and pretty ladies out
there. Why are you being like this to me?

23
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:23,896
I don't have time to put
up with your nonsense.

24
00:02:23,897 --> 00:02:26,457
I also don't have time.

25
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:32,997
Don't be like that. You're not
my style, Branch Manager.

26
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:38,016
What's wrong with me? What style do you like
then? A style similar to Kim Yeong Soo?

27
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:40,956
Isn't this style a lot
better than that style?

28
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:46,177
You wouldn't understand a woman like me.
Don't play around.

29
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,496
What's wrong with you, Ajumma?

30
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:50,856
If you find out, you'll get hurt.

31
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:52,896
I want to know.

32
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:56,116
I won't tell you.

33
00:02:56,117 --> 00:02:59,497
I need to make you more drunk.

34
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:08,037
I bet Kim Yeong Soo didn't
know your true feelings.

35
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:12,956
Was he that indifferent toward you?

36
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:17,697
He was the most considerate
person of anyone I've ever met.

37
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:21,936
Yeong Soo never asked about someone's past.

38
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:25,517
He never said anything
that could wound someone.

39
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:29,697
That's what I liked about him
and so I married him, but

40
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:36,477
after time his behavior felt like ignorance.
I couldn't talk about any deep feelings.

41
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:42,837
You know... Those kinds of talks you can
only have between married partners.

42
00:03:55,797 --> 00:03:58,516
Let's start over from the beginning.

43
00:03:58,517 --> 00:04:03,217
Hello, my name is Lee Hae Joon.
What is your name?

44
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:06,677
It's Shin Da Hye.

45
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:09,796
What's your favorite food? Chicken feet?

46
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:11,216
Stop that!

47
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,357
You hands are hot (strong)!

48
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:18,396
Where are you going?

49
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:20,177

Where did all of my high heels go?

60
00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:38,177
Where did they go?

61
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:43,496
Excuse me!

62
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:47,657
Will you be okay going to work
in slippers, Shin Da Hye?

63
00:05:56,157 --> 00:06:01,546
Can't you throw away that bag?
Let me see this.

64
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:04,626
How long have you used this to
create this smell of Ajusshi?

65
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:07,967
What do you mean it's an ajusshi smell?

66
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:15,017
Use this.

67
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:18,976
What's this?

68
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:20,637
<i>Lamatt</i>

69
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,657
A bag.

70
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:29,996
Is this a gift?

71
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:32,177
Not particularly.

72
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:38,336
Are you crying?

73
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:42,677
Feeling embarrassed at a time like this.

74
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:50,756
Receiving a gift is this
kind of feeling, huh?

75
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:54,777
What kind of girl are you

76
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:59,256
I will never let this
bag part from my body.

77
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:03,756
Right, you made a good decision.
Come over here.

78
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,456
You are at the peak of your beauty.

79
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:10,376
If I were you, I would brush
my hair to make it pretty...

80
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:16,676
Stop acting so stiff!

81
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:22,317
And put on some pink blush
to make yourself prettier.

82
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:36,717
How do you apply this?

83
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:52,357
What!? What a waste.

84
00:07:57,397 --> 00:08:01,377
Wow I'm pretty.

85
00:08:05,437 --> 00:08:08,497
<i>Big Brother is critical.</i>

86
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,457
Aish...

87
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:15,236
Seung Jee!

88
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:17,257
Seung Jae!

89
00:08:19,537 --> 00:08:21,236
What are you doing here, pretty lady?

90
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:22,736
Na Seok Cheol, you bastard!

91
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:26,377
You... How did you come here...

92
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:31,517
Is this what our Seung
Jae is so worried about?

93
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:35,256
Stop right now!

94
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:36,796
What's your identity?

95
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:39,676
- I am Han Gi Tak's—-No!

96
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:43,356
Han Gi Tak's little sister.

97
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:47,296
Why did Han Gi Tak's
little sister appear here?

98
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:52,256
Your organization is low on money.
I came to get my money.

99
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:58,296
All the money that person skimmed from
the top and entrusted to Han Gi Tak,

100
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:00,737
I came to find that.

101
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:06,356
I was wondering where that money went.
So it went to Han Gi Tak in the end.

102
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:11,936
That's right. If you cooperate
with us, then I'll give you half.

103
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:14,056
- Cooperate? - My brother,

104
00:09:14,057 --> 00:09:19,916
also that Song Yi Yeon who ruined our family. I'm going
to take her to the top and throw her down alone.

105
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:26,746
Aigoo, so scary! While you're doing this, do you
think Cha Jae Gook will let you do as you please?

106
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:33,196
Cha Jae Gook has a different adversary. Lee Hae
Joon. That half brother is going to stomp on him.

107
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:37,777
It's you choice which
side you'll stand behind.

108
00:09:40,657 --> 00:09:48,657
That's right. Song Yi Yeon is
the reason behind your scar.

109
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,856
Does Cha Jae Gook know that?

110
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,747
So it's revenge for Han Gi Tak.

111
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:59,257
Gi Tak taught his juniors well, huh?

112
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:03,507
You made a good decision.

113
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:11,716
If I bite once, I won't let go. I'm
a crazy dog so keep that in mind.

114
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:13,777
I know that.

115
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:47,407
Choi Seung Jae, I have
a good eye for people.

116
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:54,186
That's right. There's no way
you'd betray Han Gi Tak.

117
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:58,417
You're a charming person.

118
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:07,056
Hey, you like that pretty girl right?

119
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:10,467
"Nanny nanny boo boo."

120
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:18,126
If that girl finds the money,
then you bring it to me.

121
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:22,946
That is, if you don't want her
pretty face to end up like mine.

122
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:24,617
Do you understand?

123
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:31,757
Then work hard.

124
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:41,936
It doesn't matter whether Han Gi
Tak's sister attacks Cha Jae Gook

125
00:11:41,937 --> 00:11:45,446
or Cha Jae Gook attacks
Han Gi Tak's sister.

126
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:48,036
Play both sides.

127
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:50,626
All I have to do is observe
from the sidelines.

128
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,277
This is exciting! This is fun!

129
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:59,506
Hyungnim, we keep getting calls by
peons looking for Song Yi Yeon.

130
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:01,136
Connect the calls.

131
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,036
Also create a meeting
time with the reporters.

132
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:08,326
If both sides are going to get
ready to go at each other,

133
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,357
don't you think I should make the
process go smoother by greasing it?

134
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:17,646
What are you doing?

135
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:19,296
Give it here.

136
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:21,426
Is your back okay?

137
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:24,726
Are you crazy? Don't pretend
you know at the company.

138
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:28,346
Then make it so that I
don't have to notice.

139
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:32,866
You carry heavy stuff like this.
I know you're a strong woman,

140
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:34,896
but you'll hurt your back this way.

141
00:12:34,897 --> 00:12:38,037
I don't need your help.

142
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:43,646
Who do you think I became like this for?

143
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,606
Then I'll take responsibility.

144
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:49,576
What nonsense are you talking about?

145
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:51,706
- Oh right...- What now?

146
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:56,326
You didn't forget about
our date today, right?

147
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:59,657
Do you want to get hit again?
Get out of my way, please.

148
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:14,386
I was about to call you. I
guess it all worked out.

149
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:17,216
When you see the employee lounge, you will
know the quality of the department store.

150
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:20,956
If a company serves its employees, then the employees
will grow the company. That is my principle.

151
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:23,006
I didn't know you have
that kind of principle.

152
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:25,616
Make a good employee lounge
as big as a school yard.

153
00:13:25,617 --> 00:13:29,317
Also make an employee nap room.
Are you writing this all down?

154
00:13:30,297 --> 00:13:33,717
And Jade mat with few massage chairs.

155
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,186
How hard it must have been.

156
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,866
Yesterday, I found that
her waist is so slim

157
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:46,866
I could reach around her with one arm.

158
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,576
What?

159
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:51,216
Can you take care of this,
Department Head Jeong?

160
00:13:51,217 --> 00:13:53,606
What is this?

161
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:58,187
I purchased a pair of shoes yesterday. I forgot
to get reward points for them. Those shoes!

162
00:14:02,037 --> 00:14:06,246
Look at the shoes! Who purchased those
shoes. What a great sense of style!

163
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,916
I don't think its time for
you to be idle right now.

164
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:11,226
Before the company serves its employees,

165
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:14,957
Branch Manager should first treat
the employees like human beings.

166
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,986
Jeong Ji Hoon, what did you do now?

167
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:37,596
It's not me, it's something
that you created.

168
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:40,517
- What?- Now everything...

169
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:44,837
We all got to know who you really are.

170
00:14:48,707 --> 00:14:51,266
Did you see the anonymous
comment on the company website?

171
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:54,606
The Branch Manager said to fire us all.

172
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:56,766
What?

173
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,306
He brought over a woman
and told us to play,

174
00:15:00,307 --> 00:15:02,627
and he's going to stab us
in the back like this?

175
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,767
I know, right?

176
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:13,446
Laying off 50% of our workforce
in an effort to reduce costs.

177
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:17,037
Transitioning permanent employees
to temporary employees.

178
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:21,957
There was a reason why you were not
interested in increasing the revenue.

179
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:27,086
I sent this?

180
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:30,117
Anyway it is impossible
to increase the revenue.

181
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:34,376
Lay off your employees by your own hands.

182
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:37,456
How funny. I'm not doing it.

183
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:40,577
By doing it, isn't it better
that you save your reputation?

184
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:45,387
I will sell the department
store for a good price.

185
00:15:46,617 --> 00:15:51,636
No, I can't sell it. You know why?

186
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:54,066
I will make the price of
the department store crap.

187
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:57,417
Don't get in my way.

188
00:15:58,537 --> 00:16:02,086
This won't do. I wasn't going to
work, but now I'll have to work hard

189
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,527
to get in your way.

190
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:13,436
No. I mean, why did you have to choose a
bastard like him? I'm about to flip out.

191
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,446
I'm the one who is about to flip out.

192
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:19,126
Lee Hae Joon is the person who
works with data and numbers.

193
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:23,406
He doesn't know at all how much affection
you have for this department store.

194
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:27,926
No, I— I have to work now.

195
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:31,097
I don't care if this company
goes bankrupt or not.

196
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:35,097
Shin Da Hye.

198
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,056
What's with that look?
Are you suspecting me?

199
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:45,386
You want me to go get the elevator again?

200
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:48,176
- The rumor about you firing the
employees...- Yes, that's right.

201
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:50,676
- It's right?- It's right, but it's not.

202
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,576
Lee Hae Joon did it but I didn't do it.

203
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:54,826
What?

204
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:58,446
I am me but I am not the me from my past.

205
00:16:58,447 --> 00:17:04,206
Anyway, I will not lay people off. There
are no layoffs as long as I am here.

206
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,226
I already knew it.

207
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:09,347

You're as big as a mountain.

212
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:35,736
Do you think I came here to see this look?

213
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:39,596
Are you crazy? What are you trying to
do by saying you're his little sister?

214
00:17:39,597 --> 00:17:43,126
I told you, if something happens,
just hand me over to him.

215
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:45,416
How could I hand you over?

216
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:49,316

219
00:17:57,177 --> 00:18:00,356
Do you really know where the fund is?

220
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:03,437
If I knew, I would've found it already.

I don't have much time left.

223
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:15,856
What do you want to do? Do you
want to work together with me?

224
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:17,766
- Revenge?- No!

225
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:21,187
Don't say the word revenge so lightly!

226
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:26,307
If you take revenge, you'll be over.

227
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:39,966
Resolve Han Gi Tak's resentment, find
the fund and exonerate Song Yi Yeon.

228
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:44,436
Our Big Hyungnim has to wake up again.

229
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:49,647
Find the law again so you guys
can live a lawful life again.

230
00:18:52,877 --> 00:18:56,787
Whose son is this? He is so good-looking.

231
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:18,517
You guys! What a scene!

232
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:23,686
I knew this would happen.

233
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:26,186
You already got beat up by Hong Nan!

234
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:29,037
She can fight like a
rooster in a cock fight!

235
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:37,267
This won't do, I'll be late.
Let's go to the filming site.

236
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:46,826
Da Hye, what are you doing
with the branch manager?

237
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:50,036
What's this about your back and
what are those high heels?

238
00:19:50,037 --> 00:19:54,046
I can understand you feeling thankful to him
for looking into your husband's death, but

239
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:55,766
why do you keep giving him openings?

240
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:59,436
He is boarding. He is boarding at my house.

241
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:03,186
Why a single man— Why?

242
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:04,746
What are you thinking?

243
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:09,076
Then, as a single man, what do you care?

244
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:13,886
Da Hye... My words are... Do you
know what kind of person he is?

245
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,096
- What kind of person is he then?-
He's trying to fire his employees,

246
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:18,997
and that's why he came.
He's a cruel human being.

247
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:25,777
It seems that I know him
better than you do.

248
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:53,937
This is the branch manager.

249
00:20:59,987 --> 00:21:04,137
It's a bit hot so turn down the air conditioning
about 1 degree, no 2 degrees lower?

250
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:18,517
Raise the volume of the music as well.

251
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:31,976
What are you doing right now?

252
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:34,346
- Taking care of my employees.-
Please stop fooling around.

253
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:35,986
She's not a woman who you can do that to.

254
00:21:35,987 --> 00:21:40,777
If you're allowed to, then why am I not allowed to?
I'm also a hundred times better looking than you are.

255
00:21:42,297 --> 00:21:44,497
You have no clue.

256
00:21:47,147 --> 00:21:49,927
That... That jerk!

257
00:21:51,387 --> 00:21:55,857
<i>I want to hit that jerk. I want
to beat the daylights out of him.</i>

258
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:05,826
<i>Employees of Sunjin, this is
Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon.</i>

259
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:09,687
Employees who are on their break right
now come to the rooftop please.

260
00:22:19,027 --> 00:22:23,146
I, Branch Manager, Lee Hae Joon

261
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:26,906
will sacrifice myself
to relieve your stress.

262
00:22:26,907 --> 00:22:29,557
Throwing away all the notion of rank...

263
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:33,877
Now, the first candidate is...

264
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,457
Department Head Jeong Ji Hoon.

265
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:41,807
<i>Alright!</i>

266
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,566
<i>Fighting!</i>

267
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:49,067
Department Head Jeong!
Department Head Jeong!

268
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:59,257
<i>You're dead now.</i>

269
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:03,156
I'm counting on you, chocolate bar.

270
00:23:03,157 --> 00:23:05,626
Don't worry about rank and
let's have a fair play.

271
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:07,526
This is just a game.

272
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:09,387
Alright then.

273
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:42,027
<i>Wow!</i>

274
00:23:44,227 --> 00:23:46,886
I'm warning you. Stop
playing around with Da Hye.

275
00:23:46,887 --> 00:23:49,876
- What if it's not a joke?- Are you
saying that you really like Da Hye?

276
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:52,546
It's better than a previous boyfriend
wanting to meet her again.

277
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:54,346
I can do everything that Da Hye wants.

278
00:23:54,347 --> 00:23:56,496
- What would that be?- You see.

279
00:23:56,497 --> 00:23:59,277
You don't know anything about Da Hye.

280
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:12,306
Branch Manager! Branch Manager!
Branch Manager!

281
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:15,357
Yes, I will get to know
about her from now on.

282
00:24:25,357 --> 00:24:28,357
<i>Maya, stop time for me!</i>

283
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:36,877
<i>Oh, My!</i>

284
00:24:42,487 --> 00:24:44,776
Director! Director!

285
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:46,487
Director! Director!

286
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:57,667
At least, I should get hit like this.
Your stress has been relieved, right?

287
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:01,806
I'm okay, Department Head Jeong.

288
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:03,047
Okay. Next?

289
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:06,797
Who's the next player?

290
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:16,007
<i>Maya, please help me.</i>

291
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:24,377
Maya, you really have to help me!

292
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:39,617
The chairman wanted me to give you this.

293
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:42,726
You really come after
me at the filming site?

294
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:44,707
Why did you have to come here?

295
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:54,307
Uncle, who's does this belong to?

296
00:25:56,707 --> 00:25:59,457
This is Gi Tak Hyung's picture.

297
00:26:01,087 --> 00:26:02,476
He had a younger brother?

298
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,247
Yong Chan.

299
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:12,736
My baby. Listen to Dad well. Okay?

300
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,236
Okay, bye Mom.

301
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:17,306
Yeah. Get in the car.

302
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:21,097
<i>Request for child custody</i>

303
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:28,197
Reasons for request: Financial inability.
Due to alcoholism, instability, unstable...

304
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:37,326
What should I do for you?

305
00:26:37,327 --> 00:26:41,436
Should I steal Yong Chan away
and put him in your arms?

306
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:46,336
Or you want me to sucker
punch Cha Jae Gook's face?

307
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:49,156
- Really?- Yes, really.

308
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:54,857
So don't hold it in and
cry by yourself anymore.

309
00:26:56,627 --> 00:27:00,446
It's best to ignore these kinds of things.

310
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:02,796
I'm the one who is upright.

311
00:27:02,797 --> 00:27:05,607
Since I'm the one who is upright,
I have no reason to cower.

312
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:09,217
Let's go. They'll start filming soon.

313
00:27:18,217 --> 00:27:22,086
Hello! Drink this, please
take care of Actress Song.

314
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:24,236
Thank you.

315
00:27:24,237 --> 00:27:26,326
Hello there! Actress Song...

316
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:29,447
Extras stand by there.

317
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:48,466
For how many hours have we been waiting here? They
don't give us any food because we are extras.

318
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,296
How can you discriminate
against people like this?

319
00:27:51,297 --> 00:27:53,546
What? What do you want?!

320
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:57,567
Since while ago, your stare has been crass.

321
00:27:58,257 --> 00:28:00,326
Oppa, are you an aspiring actor?

322
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:03,936
We came at dawn and have been waiting
since filming started at ten.

323
00:28:03,937 --> 00:28:07,096
But since the main actress is over four
hours late, we are stuck here like this.

324
00:28:07,097 --> 00:28:09,486
That wench, Wang Joo Yeon!

325
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:12,386
- But Unni, you're an aspiring actor?

326
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:15,506
Kids, this unni is the celebrity.

327
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:17,426
Actress Song Yi Yeon.

328
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:18,476
Who?

329
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:22,346
Kiddos, what were you doing in 1995?

330
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:25,087
I was born in 1999.

331
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:33,026
Be more careful!

332
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:34,316
Are you alright?

333
00:28:34,317 --> 00:28:37,656
The filming schedule has been
cancelled so you may all leave.

334
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:41,167
What? You made us wait for
this long and now this?!

335
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:45,207
Forget it.

336
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,647
What should we do?

337
00:28:55,257 --> 00:28:58,146
What is this? Did something happen?

338
00:28:58,147 --> 00:29:03,126
The head ajusshi told us he'll
pay us the month's wage today.

339
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:06,746
Since we didn't act
properly, he won't pay us.

340
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:09,006
He says he won't pay us for today
since we didn't get to act.

341
00:29:09,007 --> 00:29:13,146
What? If I stand idle by in
this unjust circumstance

342
00:29:13,147 --> 00:29:15,106
Han...

343
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:17,267
Who is that head ajusshi?

344
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:37,937
That tickles the throat doesn't it?

345
00:29:40,557 --> 00:29:41,377
You're doing well, right?

346
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:43,376
No, I am not doing well.

347
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:49,776
You overwork my kind and
you're just sitting here...

348
00:29:49,777 --> 00:29:51,686
I want to use bad language...

349
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:55,356
Hey, Mister.

350
00:29:55,357 --> 00:30:00,636
If you used them for work,
isn't proper to pay them?

351
00:30:00,637 --> 00:30:03,756
Why? Is there some problem with money?

352
00:30:03,757 --> 00:30:06,866
Yes. I have no money right now so
next month when I get some money...

353
00:30:06,867 --> 00:30:11,916
I have the money to buy luxury goods
but no money to pay part-timers?

354
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:14,076
This is the Labor Department, right?

355
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:21,517
There is a vicious employer who
abuses innocent part-time workers.

356
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:30,066
It's because I feel so bad for them that...

357
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:31,896
Ah Director, this is Song Yi Yeon.

358
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:35,956
Do you know Ah Jae Agency
who supplies staff members?

359
00:30:35,957 --> 00:30:38,056
I don't think it's a good place.
Don't use them.

360
00:30:38,057 --> 00:30:40,446
Anyway, don't use them. You
know my personality right?

361
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:45,676
Reporter Park, you said you want to investigate that
part-time agency that abuses the workers, right?

362
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,596
It's right here! Here!

363
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,477
I'll give it!

364
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:56,467
You should've done that from the beginning.

365
00:31:00,507 --> 00:31:06,097
<i>Sunjin VIP Lounge</i>

366
00:31:08,097 --> 00:31:12,897
Excuse me, I'm from the Fashion Department.

367
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:29,476
Sit down, I called for you.

368
00:31:29,477 --> 00:31:33,416
Don't do these things. This is a place
my livelihood is dependent upon.

369
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:36,136
Just sit for now and drink some tea.
Enjoy some cookies as well.

370
00:31:36,137 --> 00:31:39,896
- If you're going to take me on a date, do it properly.
How could you do it like this—- This isn't a date.

371
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:43,626
O-Oh, so it wasn't.

372
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:45,816
Lounge. Dessert. Taste.

373
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:49,037
It's because you keep saying
weird things about a date.

374
00:31:53,217 --> 00:31:55,507
Oh my! What are you doing?!

375
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,686
Shin Da Hye. I told you
that I'm working right now.

376
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:08,337
You should receive services from a
customers' perspective so that you know.

377
00:32:09,697 --> 00:32:11,337
Sit down.

378
00:32:21,227 --> 00:32:24,146
This won't do. I'll clean my own feet.

379

Cha Yong Chan. Why isn't your Mom calling?

411
00:35:57,237 --> 00:36:00,537
Someone's excited.

412
00:36:04,477 --> 00:36:08,036
Yeah, did you get what I sent you?

413

Yep, Mom ate too and is working hard.

416
00:36:17,997 --> 00:36:25,056
But Yong Chan, since Mom is so busy,

417
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,716
I think you'll have to stay with Dad for
few days because I can't pick you up.

00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:32,287
Can you play with Dad
and Grandpa until then?

00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:37,156
You're so kind, my baby.

420
00:36:37,157 --> 00:36:39,237
I understand.

421
00:36:42,017 --> 00:36:45,966
What is it? Did she hang up?
Did your Mom hang up?

422
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:50,537
Yeah, she said to play with you.

Yeah, then work hard.

What's wrong with your face?
It's really red.

457
00:39:37,817 --> 00:39:40,236
It's not red.

458
00:39:40,237 --> 00:39:41,916
Is it menopause already?

459
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:43,937
What did you say?

460
00:39:44,797 --> 00:39:46,797
Then, are you jealous?

00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:51,796
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
Hurry and go, I'm busy.

462
00:39:51,797 --> 00:39:53,987
Let's go then, I'll take you to the front.

463
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:08,047
I haven't seen any taxis.

464
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:16,727
Do you want to eat this? If you do, your
whole body will have a strawberry aroma.

465
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:19,777
Really?

466
00:40:23,877 --> 00:40:26,577
How's it? Can you smell that?

467
00:40:28,457 --> 00:40:31,156
I can't smell it.

468
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:33,506
I can smell it. Why?

469
00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:35,476
Yummm!

470
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:37,497
- Does it smell? - Yes.

471
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:40,987

00:40:41,747 --> 00:40:43,637

It takes her only two hours

- This is a killer taste!

You're so stingy.

Anyway, would it be alright?

491
00:41:57,377 --> 00:42:00,646
During this precious time when there's not
even enough to spend with sister-in-law.

492
00:42:00,647 --> 00:42:03,646

Oh my!

I'm sitting here working overtime.

00:42:17,097 --> 00:42:19,516
What the heck?

499
00:42:19,517 --> 00:42:24,366
I also think to myself,
what am I doing here?

500
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:28,166
What's with you again?

501
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:33,237
After seeing Song Yi Yeon's life that
has fallen completely to the bottom,

502
00:42:36,007 --> 00:42:40,186
I'm responsible for that.

503
00:42:40,187 --> 00:42:44,116
Are you talking about that thing
that happened ten years ago?

504
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:49,466
I was so sick of my life as a gangster,

505
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:52,736
I wanted to commit suicide back then.

506
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,136
That was when

507
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:58,167
Yi Yeon came into my life.

508
00:42:58,937 --> 00:43:05,407
That girl who lived way above me

509
00:43:05,957 --> 00:43:09,186
She asked me to take her anywhere.

510
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:11,436
Back then,

511
00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:14,076
the flame that was about to go out

512
00:43:14,077 --> 00:43:17,986
felt as if I was completely restored.

513
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:21,146
Yes. Let's run away.

514
00:43:21,147 --> 00:43:25,446
"If you're with me, I
can start fresh again,"

515
00:43:25,447 --> 00:43:27,806
I said to her.

516
00:43:27,807 --> 00:43:32,647
The next day, her manager found us.

517
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:37,116
That's how Yi Yeon was sent away.

518
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:38,876
Aigoo.

519
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:43,266
Yi Yeon thinks she betrayed me back then,

520
00:43:43,267 --> 00:43:46,036
but it was I who called

521
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:48,357
her manager.

522
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:52,137
I'm a bastard.

523
00:43:52,777 --> 00:43:56,026
What an idiot I was, don't you think?

524
00:43:56,027 --> 00:44:01,197
Still, I cannot tell her the truth.

525
00:44:01,857 --> 00:44:06,377
What a coward I am!

526
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:10,837
What am I so afraid of! I
am the one who's dead.

527
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:19,186
Aiyoo.

528
00:44:19,187 --> 00:44:24,216
It must have been very difficult for you, Han
Hyung. I would have done the same thing.

529
00:44:24,217 --> 00:44:28,417
It's not because of you
so don't feel so guilty.

530
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:46,497
Song Yi Yeon sent me.

531
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:07,526
I'm a little tired, so
I'm going to rest first.

532
00:45:07,527 --> 00:45:10,406
Are you okay?

533
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:15,387
As for me, I feel as though
my tiredness is going away.

534
00:45:18,477 --> 00:45:21,156
Let him go! Let him go, Maya!

535
00:45:21,157 --> 00:45:24,416
No, not Seung Jae!

536
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:28,236
He's never been married or had a woman yet.

537
00:45:28,237 --> 00:45:30,706
Oh you are so damn strong!

538
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:35,327
No!

539
00:45:39,227 --> 00:45:43,317
Welcome.

540
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:09,657
Oh Jae Song, Happy Birthday!

541
00:46:10,817 --> 00:46:15,037
How did you know? Thank you so much!

542
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:24,696
Look at the time. I'm just too busy.

543
00:46:24,697 --> 00:46:28,017
How'd he know?

544
00:46:43,107 --> 00:46:45,367
I am sorry.

545
00:46:48,777 --> 00:46:51,016
Cut! Okay!

546
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,426
<i>Applause. Applause.</i>

547
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:56,476
Wow, you're a great actress.

548
00:46:56,477 --> 00:46:59,496
Wasn't that completely real?

549
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:03,316
You were great actress Song!

550
00:47:03,317 --> 00:47:05,946
How many times did I die today?

551
00:47:05,947 --> 00:47:10,106
Am I going to get typecast as dying person?
What is the next scene?

552
00:47:10,107 --> 00:47:12,306
You fall and due to concussion...

553
00:47:12,307 --> 00:47:14,846
Oh, really!

554
00:47:14,847 --> 00:47:19,017
What is this about concussion? Then,
what's next? With a hot soup or something?

555
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:22,026
You'll be a different person.

556
00:47:22,027 --> 00:47:23,456
Yes,

557
00:47:23,457 --> 00:47:27,947
please get me ten concert tickets.

558
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:37,587
Mom, I thought ajussi ran away
but he came to my school.

559
00:47:38,257 --> 00:47:39,977
What?

560
00:47:53,877 --> 00:47:59,357
He bought us hamburgers and gave
us an extra ten concert tickets.

561
00:48:00,267 --> 00:48:02,607
He's the best!

562
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:04,866
That's what happened.

563
00:48:04,867 --> 00:48:07,996
He reminds me

564
00:48:07,997 --> 00:48:11,387

Our Han Na got heavier. Did you
get fat or did you get taller?

591
00:50:56,197 --> 00:50:58,286
How can you say that one got fat to a lady?

592
00:50:58,287 --> 00:51:02,556
This little bean-sized girl. You have
be as old as your mom to be a lady.

593
00:51:02,557 --> 00:51:05,266
Forget it. Don't touch me.

594
00:51:05,267 --> 00:51:08,217
Alright, Miss. Let us sit down.

595
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:23,906
Father-in-law, your meal is ready.

596
00:51:23,907 --> 00:51:25,517
Oh.

597
00:51:32,037 --> 00:51:34,826
Gang Ja's food has run out, Yeong Soo.

598
00:51:34,827 --> 00:51:37,637
Yes, Father. I'll buy it on my way home.

599
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:46,516
What did I say just now?

600
00:51:46,517 --> 00:51:49,847
You called Dad's name.

601
00:51:51,157 --> 00:51:55,316
I'm sorry, it's a habit of mine. It
happens when you get old like me.

602
00:51:55,317 --> 00:52:01,556
It's okay, Father! You can think
of me as a son. I like that.

603
00:52:01,557 --> 00:52:05,497
You can call me a punk. It's okay.

604
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:17,016
"One punk can't stay quiet because of a scandal
and the other punk blows off the fashion show."

605
00:52:17,017 --> 00:52:20,416
"Do you guys see how the mall is
being viewed in the public's eye?!"

606
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:25,246
"What are you two even
doing?!" is what he says.

607
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:30,056
Like Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon has mentioned
before, raising the sales up by 130%.

608
00:52:30,057 --> 00:52:36,026
Even so, we need to do something so that Sunjin
Mall can get something out of it, right?

609
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:39,626
If not, there's no method
but to put it up for sale.

610
00:52:39,627 --> 00:52:40,686
We can't put it up for sale.

611
00:52:40,687 --> 00:52:43,296
Don't just say we can't. Take action.

612
00:52:43,297 --> 00:52:47,786
I told him to cut employees and he
makes longer contracts with them.

613
00:52:47,787 --> 00:52:51,076
I told him to make budget cuts
and what did he say again?

614
00:52:51,077 --> 00:52:56,126
Massage chair, games, karaoke, sauna,
sleeping room, coffee shop for workers,

615
00:52:56,127 --> 00:52:58,336
free and open cafeteria for all employees.

616
00:52:58,337 --> 00:53:02,446
From now on, no more buying
beer with that money.

617
00:53:02,447 --> 00:53:04,076
You have a lot of money.

618
00:53:04,077 --> 00:53:10,417
The things written on here are very easy. If we follow
even 1/10 of what is on it, the sales will rise.

619
00:53:20,037 --> 00:53:22,426
Branch Manager Lee, are you running
for election or something?

620
00:53:22,427 --> 00:53:29,086
If we reduce our luxury marketing budget and provide higher
employee benefits, we can improve the quality of our service.

621
00:53:29,087 --> 00:53:32,336
Why? Does this sound absurd?

622
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:35,617
Yes, this much is not enough.

623
00:53:36,907 --> 00:53:41,507
For now, we have to change the image
of our Sunjin Department Store.

624
00:53:42,907 --> 00:53:47,406
Why do you think the image of our Sunjin Department
Store, with its long history, was dirtied? Why?

625
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:49,137
Because of whom?

626
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:57,026
Luxury, the kind you and I
all know, is not enough.

627
00:53:57,027 --> 00:54:02,306
We need reverse marketing. We need to become the
hot issue, most talked about and positive image.

628
00:54:02,307 --> 00:54:05,696
And so? What is this reverse
marketing that you speak of?

629
00:54:05,697 --> 00:54:08,676
Good timing! That's a good question.

630
00:54:08,677 --> 00:54:14,727
The sole, aggressive, and unconventional marketing
that will raise our Sunjin Department Store again.

631
00:54:15,907 --> 00:54:19,487
We'll use Song Yi Yeon as our model.

632
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:36,476
Recently, she earned the nickname
justice's goddess, Song Crush, and became

633
00:54:36,477 --> 00:54:41,907
the hot issue that grabbed the attention of not just our target
customers, women aged 20-50, but also women in their teens.

634
00:54:43,187 --> 00:54:46,256
The icon of reversal, who transformed from
being hated to the goddess of justice.

635
00:54:46,257 --> 00:54:51,337
Anything she wears becomes the
"it" item and is sold out.

636
00:54:54,007 --> 00:54:59,166
The clothing and accessories she
wore today are selling out.

637
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:02,606
These results were created all through
word-of-mouth, without any advertising.

638
00:55:02,607 --> 00:55:05,216
Branch Manager Lee Hae Joon! Are
you joking around right now?!

639
00:55:05,217 --> 00:55:06,656
Cha Jae Gook!

640
00:55:06,657 --> 00:55:12,396
Song Yi Yeon's scandal...
Rumor... And suicide.

641
00:55:12,397 --> 00:55:15,196
These are all things involved
with Sunjin Department Store.

642
00:55:15,197 --> 00:55:20,577
The only person who can break us out of this
negative stigma is who? Only Song Yi Yeon can.

643
00:55:22,327 --> 00:55:26,716
Realistically, using the divorcee
as a model doesn't make any sense!

644
00:55:26,717 --> 00:55:30,556
Emphasizing that it's a good relationship, a
relationship in which they trust each other as parents.

645
00:55:30,557 --> 00:55:34,546
Didn't you also use the
media in the same way?

646
00:55:34,547 --> 00:55:38,366
From one family to another.

647
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:42,946
Song Yi Yeon and Sunjin's collaboration
will make us look better.

648
00:55:42,947 --> 00:55:45,317
You bastard. Are you crazy!?

649
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:54,846
"Bring Song Yi Yeon as the
model", is what he says.

650
00:55:54,847 --> 00:55:56,517
Father...

651
00:56:00,867 --> 00:56:03,797
That is an excellent decision!

652
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:08,007
That is an excellent decision!

653
00:56:17,357 --> 00:56:19,496
Will you be alright?

654
00:56:19,497 --> 00:56:24,606
A pathetic guy who can't even win over a
woman's heart and is doing reckless things.

655
00:56:24,607 --> 00:56:27,816
We can use this opportunity to reunite
them and bring him back to his senses.

656
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:32,737
<i>The icon of reversal, who transformed from being hated to being
the goddess of justince! Anything Song Yi Yeon sells out!!!</i>

657
00:56:35,747 --> 00:56:37,666
Scared me!

658
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:42,216
Explain. No matter how I look
at this, this kid is a boy.

659
00:56:42,217 --> 00:56:43,956
<i>How did he get this picture?</i>

660
00:56:43,957 --> 00:56:47,626
How? It looks exactly like me!

661
00:56:47,627 --> 00:56:49,366
What's your real identity?

662
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:52,437
It really is me!

663
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,847
The truth is...

664
00:56:58,677 --> 00:57:01,706
I completely changed my face.

665
00:57:01,707 --> 00:57:02,607
What?

666
00:57:02,608 --> 00:57:06,916
I completely changed my face (through
plastic surgery). You're too much.

667
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:09,167
So cruel!

668
00:57:16,897 --> 00:57:18,476
No... That's not what I...

669
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:22,926
I don't know, I don't know. It hurt.

670
00:57:22,927 --> 00:57:26,846
It's a secret from Song Yi Yeon, okay?

671
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:29,347
It hurts my pride.

672
00:57:46,237 --> 00:57:50,727
You had a younger sibling?
Why didn't you say anything?

673
00:57:51,907 --> 00:57:55,666
When I was younger, my Mother passed away,

674
00:57:55,667 --> 00:58:02,076
"raising the kid in
private to protect him."

675
00:58:02,077 --> 00:58:05,606
This ad lib didn't come out of nowhere.

676
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:09,197
And so? You're not going to find him?

677
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:14,457
I've already buried him in my heart.
What would I do if I find him?

678
00:58:15,197 --> 00:58:20,147
He's probably living well somewhere.

679
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:31,276
That bastard... Should I beat him up?

680
00:58:31,277 --> 00:58:36,417
No thank you! Stop doing
that "nananana" thing too!

681
00:58:39,027 --> 00:58:42,157
Did Han Gi Tak really
have a younger sibling?

682
00:58:43,127 --> 00:58:46,547
Ah yes, I have time. When
should I come see you?

683
00:58:47,087 --> 00:58:48,787
One moment please.

684
00:59:07,077 --> 00:59:15,077

<i>That's nice.</i>
