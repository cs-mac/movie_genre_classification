ART: Bunyon crushes it.

1468
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,430
It's going, going...

1469
01:26:58,464 --> 01:26:59,665
One foot foul.

1470
01:26:59,698 --> 01:27:00,738
(CROWD CHEERING) (LAUGHING)

1471
01:27:04,002 --> 01:27:06,905
Fastballs. Crush has got 'em timed.
We're dead.

1472
01:27:06,938 --> 01:27:09,575
Hey, Al. It ain't over
until it's over, buddy.

1473
01:27:10,008 --> 01:27:11,076
Mmm.

1474
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:14,713
Hey, don't touch the bat, taco.

1475
01:27:14,746 --> 01:27:16,214
MAN: He's yours now, baby!

1476
01:27:16,247 --> 01:27:19,851
Well, The Crush has got
Cooper's fastball timed now.

1477
01:27:19,885 --> 01:27:22,721
But the last time Cooper
threw this guy a curveball,

1478
01:27:22,754 --> 01:27:24,623
he hit it out of the zip code!

1479
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:27,025
So, Rockets fans,
what's it gonna be?

1480
01:27:29,728 --> 01:27:30,796
(IN SPANISH)

1481
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,333
(GRUNTING)

1482
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:05,764
Yes!

1483
01:28:05,797 --> 01:28:06,898
Yeah!

1484
01:28:07,566 --> 01:28:08,667
Yes! Yeah!

1485
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,835
(CROWD CHEERING)

1486
01:28:11,002 --> 01:28:12,037
RODRIGUEZ: Deja vu!

1487
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:13,872
I want Cooper in LA next week!

1488
01:28:13,905 --> 01:28:15,907
Pay him whatever he wants!

1489
01:28:15,941 --> 01:28:16,942
(EXHALES)

1490
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,077
(CHITTERING EXCITEDLY)

1491
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:20,110
(CROWD CHEERING LOUDLY)

1492
01:28:22,648 --> 01:28:23,949
(ALL CHEERING)

1493
01:28:51,977 --> 01:28:53,845
Oh. Like I didn't
see that, you guys.

1494
01:28:53,879 --> 01:28:55,447
(LAUGHING) Act your age.

1495
01:28:58,617 --> 01:28:59,985
You hungry?

1496
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:07,759
