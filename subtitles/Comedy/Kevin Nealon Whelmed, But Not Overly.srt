Oh, boy!

16
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,658
Want to eat anything?

17
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,575
No. I do not feel hungry.

18
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,742
Yes, it does.

19
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:14,408
Yes.

20
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,684

<i> As you well. I want

00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:17,950
Eva Khatchadourian!

27
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:37,200
She has done a lot here.

28
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,116
Listen, Eva.

29
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:43,824
I does not matter
that she was,

30
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:46,532
or she has done. If you know
typing and clerical

31
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:48,408

Well, thank you.

Looks like someone is there
must be a happy day?

38
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,282
You're pleased you?

Sorry?

I hope you washed crushed
Hell, old whore!

Oh God, what?
She all right?

00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,074
Nothing.
I'm alright.

- Let me call an ambulance.
- Self-causing me there.

44
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:57,283
- But she has ...
- No, I'm fine.

45
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,533
<i> Eva, when you home?

46
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,783

On safe?

Where not.

00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:47,075
The real you?

55
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:52,908
Are you sure?

He made <i> here.

59
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:12,199
I needed her placement this
today, Eva.

60
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,157
But today my afternoon break.

61
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:16,532
You remember? I told then that.

62
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,241
Really dead, that's right.

63
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:21,533
- Give these to Massughi.
- Yes.

64
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,617
- Hi Eva.
- Hey, Al.

65
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,657
No, leave me out!
Please leave me alone!

66
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:14,449
- Put me out!
- Continue to go.

67
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,867
She Oi! She Oi!
Please help me!

68
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,533
Put me out!

69
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:33,408
Eva, do not hold your breath.

70
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,408
Do not hold your breath, Eva.

71
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,033
Eva!

72
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:40,575
And know.

73
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:44,032
Do not sleep anymore, Eva.

74
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:46,325
On nearly finished.

75
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:50,074
- Welcome!
- No, do not wake it.

76
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:52,158
I just finished it sleep, Franklin.

77
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:56,699
Hi baby.

78
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,867
World instead. I want to play?

79
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:03,200
I want to play the game?

80
00:23:06,325 --> 00:23:07,992
You all right?

81
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,492
Do not do more than that.
You all right?

82
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,242
You think I do too why?

83
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:21,116
Just swing it is a ty.

84
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:24,242
Just swing it a ty is given,
How that time.

85
00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:26,783
He your father's small!

86
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:12,033
My God! All 12 results?

87
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,491
- They are why I still get.
- No need to ...

88
00:25:17,492 --> 00:25:18,950
I was still taking off!

89
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,866
<i> I am a pretty boy boyfriend.

00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:55,825
We would love <i> daughter headline.

91
00:26:11,117 --> 00:26:15,158
You know it. Do not wake up.
Do not wake up.

92
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,616
I say "mother" go?

93
00:26:20,617 --> 00:26:24,992
"Me mother seriously," "mother," Kevin?

94
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:28,575
I said, "shadow", go? "Bong ... excellent ...

95
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:31,617
"Shadows"?

96
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:33,825
Not? OK.

97
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:37,699
She will be throwing it for me,
I threw it to me, the house?

98
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,116
Do.

99
00:26:39,117 --> 00:26:40,867
Throw it to me.

100
00:26:44,117 --> 00:26:46,867
Now, go throw it to me.

101
00:26:55,075 --> 00:26:56,825
No stars, no stars.

102
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,907
Throw back okay?
Cho is to be rolled.

103
00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:04,158
Cho is to be rolled.
So ...

104
00:27:05,117 --> 00:27:07,657
When I was last birth,
it does not stop crying.

105
00:27:07,658 --> 00:27:09,950
I used to think that
will damage your hearing.

106
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:15,867
No, it's very good hearing.

107
00:27:19,158 --> 00:27:21,408
But it must be said, right?

108
00:27:22,242 --> 00:27:25,449
I once read somewhere that
without saying that ...

109
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,700
Early symptoms of autism.

110
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,200
It did not manifest
other symptoms.

111
00:27:35,658 --> 00:27:37,700
Do not worry too
about it.

112
00:27:44,825 --> 00:27:46,700
It is not
baby against children?

113
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:50,575
But how well it's all right.

114
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,200
Thank you.

115
00:28:04,908 --> 00:28:06,407
Got it.

116
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:07,950
Roll it to me lightly.

117
00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:18,324
Very good. Any rolling again.

118
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:19,949
This is done, Kev.

119
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,033
Got it. Making light.
Is not?

120
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:24,992
Is not?

121
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:40,574
<i> This is elephant gray,
it's as big as houses,

122
00:28:40,575 --> 00:28:44,199
<i> very big, not baby
the same mouse.

123
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,116
I say "elephant" to go, Kevin?
"Elephant"?

124
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:50,492
"Elephant."

125
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:53,492
Kevin?

126
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,449
Kevin?
I say "mother" your mother go?

127
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,074
No!

128
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:01,532
- "Mother"?
- No!

129
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:03,658
- Say "mother" to go.
- No.

130
00:31:59,908 --> 00:32:01,492
Hoax or kind?

131
00:32:03,408 --> 00:32:06,825
Hoax or kind?
I got you know someone.

132
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,574
<i> I do not like it.

133

Mother been happy before
with Kevin, you know?

136
00:32:33,325 --> 00:32:36,949
I now had to wake up every morning ...

137
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,242
and wish I was in France!

138
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:55,116
The elevator is
deadly traps here.

139
00:32:55,117 --> 00:32:57,741
It needs a garden,
a place to play,

140
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,117
a swimming pool.

141
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:03,075
But I love New York.

142
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:05,532
Come on!

143
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:07,407
Slogan of someone by it.

144
00:33:07,408 --> 00:33:10,032
This is the priority, Eva.

145
00:33:10,033 --> 00:33:12,075
It only children
once it has.

146
00:33:12,942 --> 00:33:14,991
He clung to "the things he wanted to," go.

147
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,950
I will not leave this city where.

148
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:19,991
Kevin, come on, there's enough.

149
00:33:19,992 --> 00:33:21,657
Mother and father are talking.

150
00:33:21,658 --> 00:33:23,283

00:33:57,783 --> 00:33:59,617
Our castles!

156
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:41,408
I seek food preparation,
anyone want anything?

157
00:34:57,533 --> 00:34:59,575
Wait! Ms. K!

158
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:06,251
I'm here.

159
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:08,450
Soweto.

160
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,783
Good evening.

161
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,325
I just want to know
This stroll at it.

162
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:23,450
She was healthy, thank you.

163
00:35:24,742 --> 00:35:26,491
She looks good here.

164
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:30,658
Yes. The doctors said it was still
opportunity for me to walk again.

165
00:35:31,492 --> 00:35:32,867
So good.

166
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:37,992
Keep healthy light and K.

167
00:35:38,992 --> 00:35:40,783
Me too.

168
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,241
Come on, come on!

169
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:22,199
Die! Die!

170
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,533
No! No! No!

171
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:28,658
- This Death!
- I jumped What kind?

172
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:31,825
This death!

173
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:38,242
Come on! Come on!

174
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:40,242
This death!

175
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:53,699
Kev, you on it you?

176
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,158
Kevin?

177
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:58,700
Kevin, you heard?
Dad is pee on the toilet.

178
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:03,033
I can also do that.

179
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:29,157
Sister, click here.

180
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:33,157
See that? She clicked the connector
then it will open.

181
00:37:33,158 --> 00:37:37,074
If not ...
We'll try again.

182
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:40,325
- Press left his cell. Want to try?
- Yes.

183
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:43,199
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.

184
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,574
- Place it, then.
- Right.

185
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:48,657
See that? Open it here.

186
00:37:48,658 --> 00:37:52,408
Right. Thank you.
Sure I understand.

187
00:37:53,075 --> 00:37:54,908
Thank you for help.

188
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:13,492
The extrusion and diarrhea.

189
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:15,867
Welcome, old, star?

190
00:38:17,825 --> 00:38:19,282
The extrusion à diarrhea?

191
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:22,241
No problem. Dad will help you.

192
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:23,617
No problem.

193
00:38:24,158 --> 00:38:26,992
I went to his room, he'll be to soon.

194
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,157
Do I wake up.

195
00:38:30,158 --> 00:38:32,075
Go away, cu.

196
00:39:08,158 --> 00:39:12,158
All square sheets of paper
lem painted trash, stupid.

197
00:39:16,242 --> 00:39:18,824
Everyone should have
a corner of their own.

198
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:20,824
I have my room.
This is the mother's room.

199
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,949
Mother can help make your room
so special, if you prefer.

200
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,992
"Special" mean?

201
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,950
This means that it reflects
of human personality.

202
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:34,908
What is personality?

203
00:39:36,783 --> 00:39:38,658
I thought I knew there and then.

204
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,867
It's absurd.

205
00:40:07,283 --> 00:40:09,200
No, no, good.

206
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:11,908
I do not need it you?

207
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:14,617
And him?

208
00:40:15,658 --> 00:40:17,533
Got it.

209
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:22,282
I mean if you have to take care of all ...

210
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:24,116
I can.

211
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:25,450
Really?

212
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:31,282
Both which are great.

213
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:32,657
Okay, John.

214
00:40:32,658 --> 00:40:35,992
Be mild. I'll tell you later.
Goodbye.

215
00:40:45,158 --> 00:40:46,742
Kevin?

216
00:40:48,867 --> 00:40:50,283
Kevin?

217
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,783
Nothing to say anymore?

218
00:41:37,825 --> 00:41:40,242
Go wash your face!

219
00:41:57,783 --> 00:42:00,033
It just said sorry.

220
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:04,242
And it's just trying to help children
so special.

221
00:42:28,575 --> 00:42:30,533
Remember why you have that?

222
00:42:32,742 --> 00:42:35,242
What is really most
mother did.

223
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:40,908
You know how people
teach a cat?

224
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:44,200
Tuck them into your nose
Department of faeces.

225
00:42:46,575 --> 00:42:48,282
We do not like that.

226
00:42:48,283 --> 00:42:50,533
And from there they discharge into the box.

227
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,574
Now, let's work
with numbers.

228
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:58,533
- Number of 3's behind?
- 9.

229
00:43:00,908 --> 00:43:03,950
- Number 7's behind?
- 71.

230
00:43:04,742 --> 00:43:06,657
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

231
00:43:06,658 --> 00:43:10,907
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

232
00:43:10,908 --> 00:43:15,491
21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 30,

233
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:20,241
31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40,

234
00:43:20,242 --> 00:43:26,241
41, 42, 43, 44, 45,
46, 47, 48, 49, 50.

235
00:43:26,242 --> 00:43:28,492
Now we stop now?

236
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:39,543
Hold off.

237
00:43:39,843 --> 00:43:43,367
The community they go,
because you are too intelligent.

238
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,158
I do not ...

239
00:44:02,492 --> 00:44:04,283
I do not ...

240
00:44:24,783 --> 00:44:26,950
I felt good to do you?

241
00:44:59,242 --> 00:45:01,825
I can see
doctors alone.

242
00:45:17,742 --> 00:45:20,283
I have to tell her this, Eva.

243
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:23,992
She is very energetic boy.

244
00:45:30,283 --> 00:45:32,742
- Thank you.
- Nothing.

245
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:59,325
What did your mother,
it is wrong.

246
00:46:00,408 --> 00:46:03,992
And she very apologetically.

247
00:46:16,617 --> 00:46:19,408
Kev? Kev, wait minute!

248
00:46:20,742 --> 00:46:22,200
Kev?

249
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:24,200
Kevin?

250
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,658
Kev, why is this?

251
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:30,949
I broke my hand.

252
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,824
Why do you break your hand?

253
00:46:32,825 --> 00:46:34,657
The extrusion diarrhea in diapers.

254
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:37,116
Mother had to go for a new diaper.

255
00:46:37,117 --> 00:46:40,366
And I fell down from the table
truck toys at changing diapers.

256
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:43,200
Mother took me to
Goldbutt doctor.

257
00:46:49,617 --> 00:46:51,617
It's all in me.

258
00:46:53,825 --> 00:46:55,991
No, I do not think cycle.

259
00:46:55,992 --> 00:46:58,825
Where can I look after it
any time of day was.

260
00:47:28,075 --> 00:47:29,700
Franklin ...

261
00:47:44,825 --> 00:47:46,450
Unbelievable.

262
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,033
What style do it?

263
00:47:54,325 --> 00:47:56,325
Anyway, also progressive.

264
00:48:11,408 --> 00:48:12,950
Unfinished.

265
00:48:24,617 --> 00:48:26,075
Got it.

266
00:48:45,117 --> 00:48:46,533
I love you.

267
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,283
I do not like this.
Turn it off.

268
00:50:09,242 --> 00:50:12,074
Department of pet, you mind
if the supermarket where she parked?

269
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,283
I want to go home.

270
00:50:15,408 --> 00:50:17,783
As the mother should buy ...

271
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,075
Well we go home.

272
00:50:46,575 --> 00:50:48,075
Hi all!

273
00:50:48,783 --> 00:50:52,242
Dad! What now?
Dad took the beautiful photos you?

274
00:51:03,158 --> 00:51:05,575
Eva, it was just a boy.

275
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,532
A very good boy.

276
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,617
Like every other boy.

277
00:52:05,075 --> 00:52:06,950
Fat mom out!

278
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,524
Ever ...
I never new him to say?

279
00:52:14,525 --> 00:52:16,900
Soon. The time now.

280
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,900
Why do arbitrarily decide
without him?

281
00:52:21,733 --> 00:52:23,567
Now I know I say?

282
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,899
Then he planted the seed bears little

283
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,732
Bear in the womb, then it
become an egg.

284
00:52:37,733 --> 00:52:40,150
18 + games is that right?

285
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,317
I understand that it is?

286
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:49,400
Is this guy put the "pee spot"
the "primary site" of the other.

287
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,316
Hug ...

288
00:52:54,317 --> 00:52:57,774
I do not want anyone
play with me?

289
00:52:57,775 --> 00:52:59,149
No.

290
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,732
You might like here.

291
00:53:00,733 --> 00:53:02,649
What if I do not like?

292
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,566
Then only you will become familiar.

293
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:06,899
Just because she was familiar
with something ...

294
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,482
does not mean she likes it.

295
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:10,150
Familiar with the child and that parent only.

296
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:15,566
Oh yeah ...

297
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:20,067
In the few months we
will have to get used to new people.

298
00:53:24,817 --> 00:53:26,567
Linda.

299
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,899
Kev, I went to see my sister.

300
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,232
This is his son, Kevin.

301
00:53:34,233 --> 00:53:36,982
This is his child.

302
00:53:36,983 --> 00:53:40,482
Yes, that's right.

303
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:44,816
This is Kevin.
Yes, yes ...

304
00:53:44,817 --> 00:53:48,066
Kevin! Do not do that ...

305
00:53:48,067 --> 00:53:50,732
No, Kevin, where so wise.

306
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:52,816
No problem dear.

307
00:53:52,817 --> 00:53:55,233
I went shopping for food?
Come on.

308
00:54:08,483 --> 00:54:13,566

Why not send someone else to go?

Kevin!

Department of honey?

324
00:55:23,483 --> 00:55:24,983
I all right?

325
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:52,650
I'm sorry mom.

326
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:55,304
Do not worry, dear.

327
00:55:56,313 --> 00:55:58,317
Now I support it.

328
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,399
"With all our hearts," Gilbert exclaimed.

329
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,316
"He is a devil in disguise,
good but why watch it? "

330
00:56:06,317 --> 00:56:10,899
"No," Robin said, laughing.
"I believe I do not promote the sort."

331
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,900
"Then he took an arrow other ..."
I okay, Department of honey?

332
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,232
"Then he took an arrow other
and placed on the cord. "

333
00:56:24,233 --> 00:56:25,732
Once again, he fired.

334
00:56:25,733 --> 00:56:29,066
Again, he withdrew the arrow and
release into the stele near the middle.

335
00:56:29,067 --> 00:56:31,482
The third time, he stretched cord

336
00:56:31,483 --> 00:56:34,149
and release the arrow on
next two steles,

337
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,649
at the center of attention,

338
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,316
The plumes of birds
the three arrows stuck

339
00:56:38,317 --> 00:56:41,816
come together as one big bundle.

340
00:56:41,817 --> 00:56:45,982
Then the excited whispers
appeared in the crowd ...

341
00:56:45,983 --> 00:56:47,900
Hi warrior, child stars then?

342
00:56:48,817 --> 00:56:50,400
I better yet?

343
00:56:51,567 --> 00:56:53,733
Dad went away. I'm tired.

344
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:57,067
Alright.

345
00:56:58,317 --> 00:57:01,066
Yeah, boy.
I need sleeping?

346
00:57:01,067 --> 00:57:03,733
Read on to her.

347
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:14,232
He released the arrow into the target 280,

348
00:57:14,233 --> 00:57:17,816
with speed and accuracy horrible.

349
00:57:17,817 --> 00:57:21,232
All were shot on target
back of a porcupine ...

350
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:24,067
detector when hunting dogs arrive.

351
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:15,232
Hello, ma'am.

352
00:58:15,233 --> 00:58:17,316
I hope not to disturb her.

353
00:58:17,317 --> 00:58:18,899
Actually there is.

354
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,233
We just have some questions for her only.

355
00:58:21,817 --> 00:58:23,317
Regarding what?

356
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,317
She will go after death?

357
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:30,140
Ah yes, I know but.

358
00:58:30,448 --> 00:58:31,899
I will go straight to hell.

359
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,149
Are doomed forever.

360
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,983
Thanks for asking.
Yet?

361
00:58:44,317 --> 00:58:46,650
Department of honey, to me, please help her.

362
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,900
I know how self-dressing.
Mother was not going out?

363
00:58:52,983 --> 00:58:54,483
Be.

364
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,232
Mother was glad I was better.

365
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,566
I want to eat soup
no lunch?

366
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:01,066
Whatever.

367
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:04,567
- With cheese or bread?
- I do not care.

368
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,066
Thanks Dad, this is amazing.

369
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:18,482
What where cu.

370
00:59:18,483 --> 00:59:20,567
So, looking into the middle.

371
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,149
Nearly hit by then. Take.

372
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:25,733
Play again.
Try lightly.

373
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,442
Use your finger ...

374
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,858
Keep your eyes looking arrows.

375
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:29,400
You do, Kev.

376
01:00:29,817 --> 01:00:31,483
I have genius here.

377
01:00:34,067 --> 01:00:35,482
Perfect.

378
01:00:35,483 --> 01:00:37,150
Thanks Dad.

379
01:01:15,775 --> 01:01:17,233
<i> Okay.

380
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,400

inside the TV program,
they also watch TV.

394
01:02:07,317 --> 01:02:09,400
And what do we see?

395
01:02:14,483 --> 01:02:16,400
Those who like children.

396
01:02:19,317 --> 01:02:22,567
<i> And now she is doing what?

397

400
01:03:21,483 --> 01:03:24,732
Kevin and his children are playing
game "Kidnapping Christmas."

401
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:26,900
Kevin!

402
01:03:27,567 --> 01:03:31,149
Kevin, he is your friend!
He is your friend.

403
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:34,067
Come on, Celia.
Get his soda.

404
01:03:44,233 --> 01:03:46,899
Not that, you stupid.

405
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,275
Root Beer cans marry.

406
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,733
Why?

407
01:03:55,317 --> 01:03:57,733
Thank you, Celia.
He thirsty.

408
01:04:01,483 --> 01:04:02,982
Hey, I want to know
a secret?

409
01:04:02,983 --> 01:04:04,400
Again recently.

410
01:04:05,317 --> 01:04:07,733
I know everyone is not thirsty?
Not you?

411
01:04:11,067 --> 01:04:13,150
Beast in a vacuum.

412
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,233
Stop Now!

413
01:04:19,233 --> 01:04:21,483
- Hi all!
- Dad!

414
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,399
See What brought about this announcement!
Kev, get him back here.

415
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,775
Well, of course.

416
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:53,150
- Want to dance?
- No, thank you.

417
01:05:55,567 --> 01:06:00,067
- Take that, once.
- Where I do not dance.

418
01:06:11,483 --> 01:06:14,233
The something new her pleasure,
pride that went there?

419
01:06:17,483 --> 01:06:20,317
She also thought that madman
She now wants you?

420
01:06:39,233 --> 01:06:41,150
Stay away. Drink extra billion more.

421
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:44,733
Why?

422
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,482
- The fun?
- Yes.

423
01:07:06,483 --> 01:07:08,817
I could not believe it too!

424
01:07:08,978 --> 01:07:11,422
- Too great discretion?
- Yes.

425
01:07:27,233 --> 01:07:28,650
Kevin!

426
01:08:11,983 --> 01:08:14,567
Looks like the mother that children in
bookstores today, right?

427
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:18,900
No.

428
01:08:20,483 --> 01:08:22,567
The delicate, she vowed always.

429
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:31,400
By the way, you can do
on Friday?

430
01:08:34,858 --> 01:08:36,233
Why?

431
01:08:39,317 --> 01:08:41,899
I thought the house could
do something together.

432
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,817
That we are family.

433
01:08:45,233 --> 01:08:46,733
Do what?

434
01:08:48,317 --> 01:08:50,900
It is possible to restaurants.

435
01:08:51,567 --> 01:08:54,150
Or go out on a
yard mini-golf place?

436
01:09:09,483 --> 01:09:10,858
Got it.

437
01:09:24,942 --> 01:09:26,733
Why do not you bring
jacket on?

438
01:09:28,608 --> 01:09:31,192
I always do everything to
not comfortable enough?

439
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:34,400
Uncomfortable?
With his mother?

440
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:48,483
Every time I see fat people,
is that they are eating.

441
01:09:49,317 --> 01:09:53,232
Not due to poor digestion
or item which is hardly trivial.

442
01:09:53,233 --> 01:09:54,816
It's food.

443
01:09:54,817 --> 01:09:56,816
They are fat because food lying around.

444
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:58,900
Eat more and eat his lips dripping.

445
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:06,232
Sometimes a mother is enough.

446
01:10:06,233 --> 01:10:08,732
I was talking too.

447
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:10,719
Well, yes.

448
01:10:11,559 --> 01:10:13,442
The children who inherit it from?

449
01:10:31,567 --> 01:10:34,067
Good, I won.

450
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:58,733
What happens next here, mama?

451
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,566
I will go home, I'll wear
something more serious.

452
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:04,233
Then she take me to dinner.

453
01:11:04,817 --> 01:11:06,233
Or.

454
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,650
We eat of that preparation.

455
01:11:24,067 --> 01:11:25,650
I feel hungry.

456
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:28,067
You're that big.

457
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:41,983
I choose salads,

458
01:11:43,525 --> 01:11:46,899
re-steak and a bottle of wine.

459
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,400
Got it.

460
01:12:03,858 --> 01:12:06,317
How about at school?

461
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:13,317
The world.

462
01:12:14,067 --> 01:12:15,775
Every school schedule.

463
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,982
What about teachers?
Some have ...

464
01:12:20,983 --> 01:12:24,067
Mother asked the listening
music groups you?

465
01:12:25,567 --> 01:12:29,149
Then she asked what is the pro-

466
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:31,482
is making me insane.

467
01:12:31,483 --> 01:12:35,066
And we can always say mouth
everything depends on you,

468
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:40,150
but before the goods can opener,
make sure you are ready.

469
01:12:40,483 --> 01:12:43,399
By the time dessert,
she'll talk about drugs,

470
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,816
Be careful,

471
01:12:44,817 --> 01:12:47,524
she did not want to intimidate the
Where am drunk on drugs.

472
01:12:47,525 --> 01:12:50,733
Then she tells me
what she experienced.

473
01:12:53,317 --> 01:12:55,774
And when she stopped gulping
This wine,

474
01:12:55,775 --> 01:12:57,232
she looked gently ...

475
01:12:57,233 --> 01:13:00,232
and to say to you is great
when spending time together,

476
01:13:00,233 --> 01:13:03,900
her arms on the shoulders of children,

477
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,358
I clutched at a time.

478
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,858
Too bad!

479
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:15,525
- Computer and damaged mother.
- Yeah, that's right.

480
01:15:16,233 --> 01:15:21,067
The job data as well.
I thought I deserved that.

481
01:15:26,233 --> 01:15:30,900
- Why do you have things like this?
- The collection here.

482
01:15:34,233 --> 01:15:36,316
The craziest is worth collecting stars?

483
01:15:36,317 --> 01:15:39,233
I do not like the postage stamp.

484
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,400
What is the purpose here?

485
01:15:47,275 --> 01:15:48,422
There is no purpose at all.

486
01:15:49,322 --> 01:15:51,233
That is the aim here.

487
01:15:56,233 --> 01:16:00,067
No, really does not matter where.

488
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:14,983
As Sam. I gotta go.
Wish her a good day.

489
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,483
Bye.

490
01:16:20,483 --> 01:16:21,983
Merry Christmas.

491
01:16:38,775 --> 01:16:40,733
Okay, Kev,
I now turn.

492
01:16:42,317 --> 01:16:43,817
Guess what?

493
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:52,857
Series 7 here. Vendor
said that the best ones in the shop.

494
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:58,608
- Sun. Thanks Dad much.
- Merry Christmas.

495
01:17:05,858 --> 01:17:08,900
What do you want any breakfast?

496
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,150
You're doing good, Snuffles?

497
01:17:31,442 --> 01:17:33,524
I heard a noise in there?

498
01:17:33,525 --> 01:17:35,400
Sounds great discretion?

499
01:17:45,317 --> 01:17:46,817
Celia!

500
01:17:51,775 --> 01:17:54,358
Any child. Go to bed now and then.
Stand up.

501
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:06,275
I thought I
but closed it.

502
01:18:08,567 --> 01:18:11,817
Kevin said I was stupid,
and he was right.

503
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,150
Where I am not stupid.

504
01:18:17,483 --> 01:18:21,650
Do not worry, parents will find.
Now go to bed.

505
01:18:27,817 --> 01:18:29,233
Uncomfortable?

506
01:19:07,067 --> 01:19:10,066
I now make are Snuffles
pet shop in the sky then.

507
01:19:10,067 --> 01:19:13,732
- Do not say that! Do not say that!
- It's the truth!

508
01:19:13,733 --> 01:19:15,232
O you,

509
01:19:15,233 --> 01:19:18,066
We focus here
Snuffles pray for ...

510
01:19:18,067 --> 01:19:19,399
Come on!

511
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:24,900
Who died ... a tragedy ...

512
01:19:25,817 --> 01:19:29,732
Then mother and father have found it all night,

513
01:19:29,733 --> 01:19:32,149
and know why that child
not find it?

514
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:35,983
Because Snuffles is out
to live in the garden then.

515
01:19:36,733 --> 01:19:38,524
Now it is living in my garden,

516
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:41,692
with so many new animals.

517
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:46,567
Celia.

518
01:19:50,983 --> 01:19:52,650
Okay, put her spoon.

519
01:19:54,692 --> 01:19:57,275
We will have a big party tonight

520
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:04,024
with small raccoon and squirrels, cats and bears ...

521
01:20:04,025 --> 01:20:08,775
they will eat nuts with fruit,

522
01:20:09,192 --> 01:20:15,025
very much the same ...

523
01:21:29,817 --> 01:21:32,400
Why do water bottles to
cleaning out?

524
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:35,900
I did not.

525
01:21:36,650 --> 01:21:38,983
- I had taken so long.
- So why is he out?

526
01:21:49,192 --> 01:21:50,857
As Kevin.

527
01:21:50,858 --> 01:21:53,067
Kevin did.

528
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,817
You should see a psychiatrist come.

529
01:23:16,233 --> 01:23:20,358
Kev, mother to have
want to say to you here.

530
01:23:30,817 --> 01:23:33,067
I want ...

531
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:36,900
Thank you for calling an ambulance.

532
01:23:40,692 --> 01:23:42,067
And?

533
01:23:44,317 --> 01:23:45,650
And ...

534
01:23:47,233 --> 01:23:52,650
Mother worried that children might feel
I take responsibility.

535
01:23:54,275 --> 01:23:55,650
Why?

536
01:23:57,233 --> 01:23:59,732
Because you have to look after his brother.

537
01:23:59,733 --> 01:24:01,983
I have nothing to blame myself at all.

538
01:24:03,108 --> 01:24:06,817
No. I did not
Where self-blame.

539
01:24:07,983 --> 01:24:10,566
I assume it will have to use your eyes, Kevin.

540
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:14,232
Should parents expect children
good will for his brother

541
01:24:14,233 --> 01:24:16,317
institutions rather than a name ...

542
01:24:18,192 --> 01:24:21,733
Dad did not remember that
I was a child star?

543
01:24:22,358 --> 01:24:24,817
Celia not only to overcome.

544
01:24:32,275 --> 01:24:33,983
Mother thought I hated the fabric.

545
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:37,983
Not so at all.
Now for the ...

546
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:43,067
I like to eat them.

547
01:25:41,025 --> 01:25:42,567
I'm very sorry.

548
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,317
Do.

549
01:25:57,817 --> 01:25:59,317
Got it.

550
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,817
Thank you.

551
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:23,400
- His son. Set next to you?
- Yes yes.

552
01:26:23,733 --> 01:26:26,733
- Celia, who wishes to pick a name?
- No!

553
01:26:48,983 --> 01:26:52,150
So ...
Are you trying to do?

554
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,775
Let's wait for the school year ends,

555
01:27:04,358 --> 01:27:06,483
and prepared for anything this summer.

556
01:27:10,067 --> 01:27:12,692
At least the guardianship
is also easy decision.

557
01:27:14,233 --> 01:27:15,650
What?

558
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,317
He decided already?

559
01:27:23,317 --> 01:27:25,692
Eva, what else to decide where.

560
01:27:27,983 --> 01:27:29,358
What happened then.

561
01:27:41,483 --> 01:27:45,150
- I need a drink of water.
- Hi, Kev.

562
01:27:47,317 --> 01:27:48,899
Listen, son,

563
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:52,900
very misunderstood what the child
heard if the "external context" here.

564
01:27:56,650 --> 01:27:58,900
Something that "out of context"?

565
01:28:01,483 --> 01:28:03,317
The key is context.

566
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,232
- Appeals are free to kill.
- No.

567
01:28:24,233 --> 01:28:26,482
She will lose everything.
Work, home.

568
01:28:26,483 --> 01:28:28,816
I will pay by the house.
I always hated it.

569
01:28:28,817 --> 01:28:30,483
What the hell die!

570
01:28:50,067 --> 01:28:53,567
A package sent to
Kevin Khatchadourian.

571
01:29:00,567 --> 01:29:02,233
- Careful, it's heavy.
- So you?

572
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,650
- Have a good day.
- Sister too.

573
01:29:35,483 --> 01:29:38,816
It used to do?
Where can I use the bikes.

574
01:29:38,817 --> 01:29:41,649
I saw it on the network
very cheap.

575
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:44,233
I will make a whole lotta
when sold at the school.

576
01:29:44,983 --> 01:29:47,067
Just like Donald Trump.

577
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:29,483
He will lead you to your boat.

578
01:31:40,983 --> 01:31:42,399
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

579
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,649
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

1, 2, 3.

584
01:31:53,650 --> 01:31:55,900
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

585
01:31:58,233 --> 01:31:59,733
Ready for the end yet?

586
01:32:03,817 --> 01:32:05,232
<i> 1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

587
01:32:05,233 --> 01:32:07,482
<i> 1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

588
01:32:07,483 --> 01:32:09,817
<i> 1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

589
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:11,983
<i> 1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

590
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:14,483
<i> Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

591
01:32:20,733 --> 01:32:23,317
<i> - No, not where.
- Do you instead.

592
01:32:23,983 --> 01:32:26,566
<i> - No, not where.
- Do you instead.

593
01:32:26,567 --> 01:32:27,983
<i> Okay.

594
01:32:35,983 --> 01:32:39,399
Hot forehead.
I all right?

595
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,317
Having never been better.

596
01:32:44,067 --> 01:32:47,649
And third is that the 16th day there.

597
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:50,816
The should do something.
How about Sunday?

598
01:32:50,817 --> 01:32:52,650
I do not know.

599
01:32:53,567 --> 01:32:54,983
Perhaps your child then.

600
01:32:56,817 --> 01:33:00,191
It's clean up this pile
I dressed to go?

601
01:33:00,192 --> 01:33:01,566
I do not want to go to school.

602
01:33:01,567 --> 01:33:04,399
You know, but it would take a bath
then we go.

603
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,317
Say "goodbye" What!

604
01:33:16,733 --> 01:33:20,482
<i> I think we can talk, only two of us,

605
01:33:20,483 --> 01:33:21,899
<i> without kids do not?

606
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,483
<i> I want to overcome it.

607
01:33:26,233 --> 01:33:28,733
Is Kevin studied in
School Glanston not?

608
01:34:06,025 --> 01:34:07,399
<i> Franklin ...

609
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:10,983
Pick up the phone <i> go!
Franklin ...

610
01:34:40,567 --> 01:34:41,900
My son is there.

611
01:34:44,067 --> 01:34:45,442
Kevin?

612
01:34:46,983 --> 01:34:48,358
Kevin!

613
01:34:55,817 --> 01:34:57,150
Kevin!

614
01:34:58,567 --> 01:34:59,900
Kevin!

615
01:36:51,317 --> 01:36:54,650
Lauren!

616
01:38:18,733 --> 01:38:21,025
Franklin?

617
01:38:28,317 --> 01:38:29,733
Celia?

618
01:38:36,983 --> 01:38:38,567
Franklin?

619
01:38:42,733 --> 01:38:44,317
Celia?

620
01:43:33,983 --> 01:43:36,231
I do not seem happy.

621
01:43:42,233 --> 01:43:43,733
I had a star?

622
01:43:47,567 --> 01:43:49,983
The nearly 18 then, right?

623
01:43:53,983 --> 01:43:58,483
Mean?
Prison makes you afraid?

624
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:02,400
Fear?

625
01:44:04,733 --> 01:44:07,650
Do you know anything about the place
like this?

626
01:44:16,817 --> 01:44:19,317
I have been calculated
satisfied with everything.

627
01:44:20,983 --> 01:44:26,150
A minor child was
incapacitated by the drug Prozac say.

628
01:44:27,983 --> 01:44:30,483
I'll be out of jail
after 2 years.

629
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:39,566
Know today is what?

630
01:44:39,567 --> 01:44:42,067
I know my mother to
no visits on Mondays?

631
01:44:42,983 --> 01:44:46,900
Knowing, the birthday child.

632
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:50,900
Two years.

633
01:44:52,567 --> 01:44:55,150
Enough time to soak about it.

634
01:45:09,317 --> 01:45:14,317
I want you to tell me why.

635
01:45:34,483 --> 01:45:36,400
Before I thought I knew ...

636
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:42,150
Now I'm not sure anymore.

637
01:46:03,067 --> 01:46:04,733
Time's visit then.
