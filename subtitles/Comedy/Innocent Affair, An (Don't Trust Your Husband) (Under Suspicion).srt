<i>Living in New York

2
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:06,445
<i>that life is full of surprises.</i>

3
00:00:06,446 --> 00:00:09,432
<i>They can be scary,
but if you're open to them...</i>

4
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:11,432

5
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:13,374
Steven.

6
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,495
Chloe.

7
00:00:14,496 --> 00:00:17,400
I knew this was
going to happen.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,471
So did I.

9
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:25,396
Oh, God! Yeah.

10
00:00:25,396 --> 00:00:27,454
Oh!

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,429
- Ohh!
- I like this picture of you.

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,442
Oh, thank you.

13
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,386
Yeah. Uhh.

14
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:36,482
Ohh! Oh, God.

15
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:38,382
Such a bad boy.

16
00:00:38,383 --> 00:00:40,386
Oh, yeah, take me.

17
00:00:40,387 --> 00:00:42,396
- Aah!
- Oh! Oh! June.

18
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:43,483
What the hell is going on?!

19
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:45,479
Hey, um... I can explain.

20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,496
No, Steven, let me.

21
00:00:50,408 --> 00:00:51,458
June, sweetheart,

22
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:54,386
I screwed your fiance
on your birthday cake,

23
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,474
and I'm gonna be late
with my half of the rent.

24
00:00:57,053 --> 00:01:00,027
<i>That's right. My roommate
slept with my fiance</i>

25
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:01,683
<i>on my birthday cake,</i>

26
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:05,418
<i>and it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

28
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:20,467
It's just like in "Friends."

29
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,398
Have you ever seen
anything so beautiful

30
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:23,425
in your entire life?

31
00:01:23,426 --> 00:01:25,442
Only my newborn son's face.

32
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:27,373
I have to take a picture.
I have to show my parents.

33
00:01:27,374 --> 00:01:28,463
They're not gonna believe this.

34
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:32,374
<i>I've heard that bread out there

<i>Don't buy bread!
I will send you bread!</i>

36
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:36,419
I can't wait to show this
to Steven.

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,485
He's my fiance.

38
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:39,492
He's getting his master's degree
in behavioral psychology.

39
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:42,428
<i>Once I finish my thesis,
I'll join you in New York,</i>

40
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:44,404

41

June-bug.</i>

- <i>I made a giraffe out of pipe cleaners.</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

43
00:01:48,404 --> 00:01:50,387
I know what you're thinking.

44
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:51,492
How did I get here?

45
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:53,478
It's like you're
inside my mind.

46
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,479
Buchwald mortgage company.
They paid to relocate me.

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,458
They gave me
this company apartment.

48
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:01,432
I mean, can you believe it?
I'm turning 26 next week,

49
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:03,433
and my life plan
is right on schedule.

50
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:23,407
Hey! What's going on?

51
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:25,036
Uh, we've been shut down.

52
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:26,727
- The government froze all our assets.
- What?!

53
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:28,330
Yeah. Apparently, Mr. Buchwald's
been embezzling

54
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,841
investors out of
billions of dollars.

55
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,248
Police are looking for him
right now.

56
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:33,366
Where's Buchwald?!

57
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,419
I don't think you understand.

58
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,398
I moved all the way
from Indiana for this job.

59
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:42,344
Oh, you're June Colbern.
Mark Reynolds. Hey.

60
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:44,408
I would've been
your associate mentor.

61
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:47,416
Little advice...
adopt a looting mentality.

62
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:52,348
Oh, see? She gets it. You're
never gonna use that, Rhonda!

63
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:54,028
I love it.

64
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,175
Oh, Rhonda.

65
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,170
Oh, my...
What happened?

66
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,177
This building is an asset
of Buchwald mortgage company

67
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:07,125
and has been seized
by the government.

68
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:08,483
But I live in there.

69
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:09,788
I don't think you do.

70
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,788
June Colbern?

71
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:13,759
Where you want your crap?

72
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:19,746
Excuse me.
You can't live here.

73
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:21,500
I ordered a small coffee.
They said I could sit here

74
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,261
if I ordered a small coffee,
so...

75
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:26,709
June? It's me, Mark.
Hey, yeah.

76
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:27,790
Just got hired
as a manager here.

77
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,780
Can't have a gap
in the resume, right?

78
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:32,288
It's been, like, four hours.

79
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:33,391
Oh, yeah, I know.

80
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:34,439
Right. Well,
I have a plan, too,

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,855
and it does not involve me
going home and telling my family

82
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:38,985
that I'm a failure.

83
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,983
<i>We have a spent a </i>lot <i>of money</i>

00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:44,968
<i>You're our little investment.</i>

<i>but no pressure, honey!</i>

88
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,657
I have to make it.
I'm just...

89
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,664
I'm just gonna have to
wait out the storm.

90
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:56,633
I mean, this bad luck
cannot last forever.

91
00:03:58,953 --> 00:04:01,906
"Roommate... wanted."

92
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,015
And that's Billy. That's Joanne.

93
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:06,990
That's Austin,
and that's Karen.

94
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:08,970
She's the serious one.

95
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,003
Oh.

96
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:13,901
Can you believe
I'm a grandmother?

97
00:04:13,902 --> 00:04:14,941
Look at my thighs.

98
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:16,012
Taut. Ropey.

99
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:17,983
<i>Madonna </i>ropey.

100
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:22,969
I don't enjoy rude women,
loud women,

101
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,990
talky women,

102
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:25,948
or redheads.

103
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,937
We may or may not
become lovers.

104
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:29,949
That's... up to you.

105
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:33,998
So my last roommate
of four years just moved out

106
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:36,907
to get married,
and I say "roommate,"

107
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:37,960
but we were more like sisters.

108
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,001
We helped each other
through all the ups and downs.

109
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:41,974
New York can be
such a scary place

110
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:43,295
when you first move here.

111
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:44,970
You really need to have
a good support system.

112

Chicken satay?

113
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:49,348

114
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:50,011
chicken satay,

115
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:52,940
live Brazilian music,
and Baz Luhrmann movies.

116
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:54,970
And prince Harry in my bed!

117
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,920
I extended it.
I extended it to four things.

118
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:01,906
Is that a picture of Dawson?

119
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:04,907
Ah, yeah.
James Van Der Beek.

120
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:06,974
The beek from the creek.
<i>Le beek c'est chic.</i>

121
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:10,907
Yeah, we dated for a while
and then decided

122
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:11,974
we are better off as friends.

123
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:14,944
We weren't really compatible
genitally.

124
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:17,915
Imagine trying to fit a cucumber
into a coin purse.

125
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:18,969
Ooh.

126
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,633
Anyway, so yeah, now he's like
my gay B.F.F. but straight.

127
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:23,371
Have you ever had
a straight gay B.F.F.?

128
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:24,920
You're fantastic.
You're fantastic.

129
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:27,002
And you're drinking
a pink drink,

130
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:29,919
and... I-I wanna live here.

131
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,015
It's first, last,
and security to move in.

132
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:34,898
Oh, fine. I mean, that's
everything I have in my savings,

133
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,924
but it is worth it.

134
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:37,962
Okay. Let's do it.

135
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,016
Oh, my God! Really?
Thank you!

136
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:42,974
Friends!

137
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,990
Psst! You.

138
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:52,928
Come here.

139
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:53,991
Come here.
I'm trying to help you.

140
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:55,953
This is important information!

141
00:05:57,012 --> 00:05:59,003
Are you here for
the roommate posting?

142
00:05:59,004 --> 00:06:00,977
Oh, yes, in fact, I-I...

143
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:04,919
Don't trust the bitch
in apartment 23.

144
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,799
Uh, excuse me? I'm... I'm sorry.

145
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:08,305
You said something
really disturbing,

146
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:09,466
and then you slammed the door.

147
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:11,866
Hello?

148
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:12,936
No one's home!

149
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:16,930
Hi, Steven, it's me.

150
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:19,948
Oh, you're never gonna
believe what has happened.

151
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:22,452
Call me when you get this.
Okay? Bye.

152
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:23,748
Hello, neighbor.

153
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:27,676
Hi. I'm Eli.
Building next door.

154
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:30,669
Oh, hi. I'm June.
I-I just moved in.

155
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,696
You must be pretty hot from
carrying all those boxes, huh?

156
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:33,735
- Pretty sweaty?
- Yeah.

157
00:06:33,736 --> 00:06:35,730
I guess I am.
I'm a little sore.

158
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:37,714
Yeah.

159
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:38,723
Sore.

160
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:42,702
What are you doing?

161
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:43,710
Hmm?

162
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:46,740
Oh, no. Oh, no.

163
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,273
- No! You stop.
- Mm-hmm.

164
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:50,132
No, you stop that!
I'm calling the cops.

165
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:51,173
I'm calling the police!

166
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:52,185
What's up?

167
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:54,519
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. Hey.
I can see your no-no's.

168
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,757
Don't come in here.
There's a pervert right there.

169
00:06:57,174 --> 00:06:58,247
Hey, Eli.

170
00:06:58,257 --> 00:06:59,281
Hey, Chloe.

171
00:06:59,282 --> 00:07:00,965
Wait. You know that guy?

172
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:02,284
Oh, yeah, we're old friends.
He shut down

173
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:04,295
this underground sushi
restaurant I was working at.

174
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:07,253
Health inspector.
Too much rat feces, Chloe.

175
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,295
So how was moving?

176
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:12,231
I was gonna help you,
but then I didn't want to.

177
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:15,210
Um... every... yeah,
it was fine.

178
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:16,924
It was fine.
Um, I did kind of have

179
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:18,795
a weird exchange
with a woman down the hall.

180
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:21,914
She sort of warned me
not to... trust you.

181
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:25,282
- Ohh. That's Robin.
She's in love with me.
- Okay.

182
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:27,282
Yeah. We met a few years ago
shooting a rap music video.

183
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:30,914
She was a P.A. I got
champagne sprayed on my ass.

184
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:33,939
♪ Bitch, do your dance ♪

185
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:35,031
♪ I can draw a circle ♪

186
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:36,967
Take it.

187
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:38,370
Yeah. Take it!

188
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:41,325
I wrote a rap
at Christian camp.

189
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:43,363
It was called
"Jesus is My 'n' Word."

190
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:47,371
It's funny.

191
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:52,362
Oh.

192
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:54,387
What is going on?

193
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:56,316
Oh, hey, roomie.

194
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:58,378
You're just in time
for a little 4-way action.

195
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,353
Take off your pants.
I gave assurances.

196
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:03,400
I support
that idea wholeheartedly.

197
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,441
One... I'm engaged,
and number two...

198
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,362
I have... I have
job interviews tomorrow, so...

199
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,350
- just keep it down.
- Oh, come on. Are you sure?

200
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,375
They're super hot!

201
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:15,321
Ugh. Get off me.

202
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:18,296
Go to sleep.

203
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,328
Hey, "tiger beat."

204
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,354
Hey, whore-nado.
What you doin'?

205
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:30,995
Nothing. Just watching some TV.
What are you doing?

206
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,058
Just reading a script.

207
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,071
Something judd apatow
wants me to do.

208
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:36,040
You know, with my schedule...

209
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,056
You got a fan over, huh?

210
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:40,013
- Yeah.
- Did she get you to
put on the flannel?

211
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:42,029
We're negotiating.

212
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:44,180
So the new roommate
move out yet?

213
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,472
Soon.
I give her three days, tops.

214
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:48,018
You are such a con artist.

215
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:50,074
No, I'm a humanitarian.

216
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:53,120
Really? A humanitarian
posts for roommates,

217
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:56,058
takes their money, and drives
them crazy till they move out?

218
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:58,140
Eventually these girls realize
that they don't belong here,

219
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:00,136
and I'm just helping
push them out.

220
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:02,069
I'm part of
the great digestive system

221
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,140
- that is New York city.
- Do you think maybe this is why

222
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:05,556
you don't have
any female friends?

223
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:07,457
Whatever. I don't want any.
Girls are too mean.

224
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:10,018
- So what's this one called?
- It doesn't matter what her name is.

225
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,141
She's just another
small-town, trusting doormat.

226
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:15,488
Like, she's got this fiance
she's always gushing about.

227
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:16,546
Meanwhile, he never takes

228
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:18,482
her phone calls,
and he spends all of his time

229
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:19,972
with some 13-year-old boy.

230
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:22,151
Hello. Something is not right
with that guy.

231
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,545
Okay. Gotta go.

232
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:29,736
This job is yours. You just have
to go in there and take it!

233
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,742
So if you could just
give my resume to your boss,

234
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:33,078
you'd see that I have my MBA...

235
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:35,634
Lady, we are not hiring.

236
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,732
I told you a million times.

237
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:43,781
- Hey!
- I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

238
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,773
We have another runner!

239
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:47,765
I... oh, my God!

240
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:52,096
<i>You have one new message.</i>

241
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:55,050
Hi, honey. Uh, sorry
we keep missing each other.

242
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:57,535
Uh, things are crazy
with Jeremy.

243
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:59,514
He's developed a fear
of bicycles,

244
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,460
so I put him
in the wind chamber.

245
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,535
I'm gonna be here all night.
Uh, I'll try again tomorrow.

246
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:06,535
I love you.

247
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:09,535
Hey.
How did the job hunt go?

248
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:12,473
Um, I'd kind of like
to be alone.

249
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:13,542
Oh, sorry.
Were you masturbating?

250
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:14,335
What? No.

251
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:15,281
Don't worry. I get it.

252
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:17,506
I have a long-standing
sexual history with that tub.

253
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:21,452
It's like I'm Jessica Tandy,
and that tub is hume cronyn.

254
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:24,477
Don't mind me.
Get your cronyn on.

255
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:27,540
Um, I'm sorry.
I-I don't mean to be rude.

256
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,479
- But I really had a long...
- You like it?

257
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,533
It's Alexander McQueen.

258
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:32,544
I bought it with the extra rent
money you gave me.

259
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,056
The extra rent money?

260
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:35,474
Oh, well, duh.
The real rent is way lower

261
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:37,458
than what I told you,
so I used the extra money,

262
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:38,481
and I bought the purse.

263
00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:42,481
So... you're saying that
you stole from me?

264
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:43,548
Oh, that's such an ugly word.

265
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,548
But yes. That's exactly
what I'm saying.

266
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:47,456
Sue me.

267
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,450
And you really
don't feel bad at all?

268
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:51,546
Survival of the fittest,
my friend.

269
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:53,525
Nobody gave me a break
when I first moved to New York,

270
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:55,519
and she'll be happier back
in Ohio or whatever.

271
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,548
I remember when you first
moved here.

272
00:10:57,592 --> 00:10:59,182
You told me your name
was Simone,

273
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:00,462
- and you sold me a condo.
- Aah!

274
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,498
And then the owners
came back from vacation.

275
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,452
They were really angry.

276
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:10,513
Well, it worked.
All her stuff is gone.

277
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:13,547
No, all of <i>my </i>stuff is gone.
Where the hell is my furniture?

278
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,484
I sold it. Since you
stole money from me,

279
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:20,501
I felt like you owed me.
Hmm. Sue me.

280
00:11:20,502 --> 00:11:23,526
Well... look who decided
to pick up a racquet

281
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:26,490
and join the game.
Good for you.

282
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,540
Yeah, well, you can go
to hell, too. Wait. What? What?

283
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:32,522
You've surprised me,
and I'm rarely surprised.

284
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:35,476
James, meet June.
June, meet James.

285
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:37,472
Heard a lot about you, June.

286
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:39,480
So you like to rub-a-dub-dub
in the tub?

287
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,526
What? No. Wait. Did... she...
she said that?

288
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:43,547
Whatever. Most of that stuff
was junk anyway.

289
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:45,531
Wait. Who bought it?

290
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:47,475
Hello, mom,
I can't talk right now.

291
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:48,540
I'm hanging out
with Chloe's stuff.

292
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,509
Ha ha ha ha!
Chloe, you are so funny.

293
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,451
Puns.

294
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:05,445
It's...
it's so nice to meet you.

295
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:08,398
I was
a huge "Dawson's Creek" fan.

296
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,395
Aw, thank you.

297
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:10,445
♪ I don't want to wait ♪

298
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,327
Yeah.

299
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,378
That's the song.

300
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,345
You sold my bedroom furniture,
too?

301
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:17,711
Yeah. Like you said,

302
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:19,705
all the stuff in the living room
was junk.

303
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,708
That Ottoman had been
in my family for generations.

304
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,700
My mother gave it to me
when my Nana died.

305
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,671
I was 9 years old.

306
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:30,746
It's the only thing that I owned
that I even cared about.

307
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:33,747
Yeah, well, you deserve...
I'm sorry.

308
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:35,715
I'm really not good
at counterpunching,

309
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:37,665
and I brought a gun
to a knife fight.

310
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,741
I did that once.

311
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:40,738
I was arm-wrestling Kevin Sorbo
in a Canadian production of...

312
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,738
James, not now.

313
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:49,737
Hmm. <i>Hello.</i>

314
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:52,742
Robin, hi. I need to buy back
that Ottoman that I sold you.

315
00:12:52,743 --> 00:12:56,721
Oh, hmm. How's it feel being
on the short end of the stick?

316
00:12:56,722 --> 00:12:58,683
Huh? Yeah.

317
00:12:58,684 --> 00:13:00,684
It's payback time, bitch.

318
00:13:00,684 --> 00:13:02,217
I thought you said
she was in love with you.

319
00:13:02,218 --> 00:13:03,725
Whoa! No,
I was roommate number four.

320
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:05,737
She stole my jewelry,
and she got me fired

321
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:07,730
from the hospital.

322
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,695
Well, I finally got you back.
I've reclaimed my power,

323
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:10,751
and it feels amazing.

324
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:14,659
- You never say hi to me in the elevator.
- I need the Ottoman.

325
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:15,734
I sold it. The fabric was...
drab.

326
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:17,663
I'm so sorry.

327
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:18,717
Well, who did you sell it to?

328
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,708
I need the Ottoman,
Mrs. Yilmaz.

329
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,688
I'll pay over full market value.

330
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:25,634
I'm sorry, but my kids
like to sit on it

331
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:26,709
while they're playing the Xbox.

332
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,693
There's no "the," mom.
It's just "Xbox."

333
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:30,743
You want a spanking, Kadir?

334
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:31,742
Ugh.

335
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:33,708
Excuse me.

336
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,750
Of course.

337
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:38,728
We've been wasting our time dealing
with the woman of the family.

338
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,169
What are you talking about?

339
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,127
No! Don't.

340
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:44,135
Don't!

341
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:46,089
Hey, papa.

342
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,136
Look who wandered
into your frosty forest,

343
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:52,132
ready to whisper
wicked promises.

344
00:13:55,124 --> 00:13:57,132
What are you doing?

345
00:13:57,132 --> 00:13:58,163
Going over your head

346
00:13:58,164 --> 00:14:00,132
and dealing with the patriarch
of the family.

347
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:03,174
He's our neighbor. He comes over
to watch the weather channel.

348
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,147
Get out.

349
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:09,089
Get out!

350
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,131
- Okay, God.
- I told you, get out.

351
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:14,140
Okay, look, yes, Chloe is
screwed up, but, you know,

352
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:16,124
she didn't start off that way.

353
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:17,182
She was a child once.

354
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:20,089
A normal human being
before she got seduced

355
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,178
by the dark side or whatever.

356
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,161
She got this Ottoman
at a time in her life

357
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:26,161
when she could still
care about something.

358
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:28,168
Don't take away
the one connection

359
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:31,106
that she has left
to her humanity.

360
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:33,160
If you do, then...

361
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:37,140
the crazy bitch might
burn this place to the ground.

362
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,178
I like to watch the flames
from across the street.

363
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,132
It reminds me of Christmas.

364
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:46,131
- I'm serious.
- Oh.

365
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:48,153
Oh, thank God.
You got it back.

366
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,126
June did.
She was kind of a genius.

367
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:51,169
Hey, all my stuff.

368
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,169
How did you get it back?

369
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:55,086
I negotiated.

370
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:01,182
Hey, lovely eyes.

371
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:04,136
How come you got
such lovely eyes?

372
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:10,168
Hey, so... it was really cool
what you did back there.

373
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:13,139
You know, all the mean stuff
I've done to you,

374
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,690
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

375
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,711
You're welcome.

376
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:18,748
Wait. What...
what are you doing?

377
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:20,773
Ahh.

378
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:22,736
Oh, good.

379
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:23,761
- Whew.
- Yes.

380
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:25,728
I loaned her $1,000
to buy those.

381
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:27,774
Chinese energy tablets.
They make you extremely focused

382
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:29,714
and super slutty.

383
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:32,773
Wait. So that... that whole story
about your great-grandmother...

384
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:34,736
that... that was a lie?

385
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:36,757
Oh, no, that was true.
You can love grandma's Ottoman

386
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:39,718
and still wanna make money
on pills.

387
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:42,764
I have paid for drugs. You have
made me an accomplice in drugs!

388
00:15:42,765 --> 00:15:45,768
I sell them and give the money
to charity.

389
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:47,698
No, I don't really do that.

390
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,472
I can't believe you!
You know what?

391
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:51,657
You... you just stay
the hell out of my life!

392
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:53,662
Oh, come on. It's not
that big a deal. June, don't...

393
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:55,298
Oh, my God. Steven?

394
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:57,205
- June-bug!
- Oh, my God. Steven.

395
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,211
Well, we kept missing
each other,

396
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:01,553
and, you know, your birthday's soon,
so I thought I'd surprise you.

397
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:02,579
Can I have a snack?

398
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,000
Breakthrough.
Um, make a note of that

399
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:06,091
in Jeremy's cravings journal.

400
00:16:06,092 --> 00:16:08,048
Oh. Who's this now?

401
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:10,048
Oh. Jeremy's traveling nurse,
Nicole.

402
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,112
She's here to monitor him
when I can't so that

403
00:16:12,112 --> 00:16:14,070
you and I can have
some alone time.

404
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:16,037
Mwah!

405
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:17,712
He talks about you
all the time.

406
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:19,989
I'm just happy to be a part
of his important work.

407
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:21,095
Oh.

408
00:16:21,095 --> 00:16:23,099
I used my miles to come here.

409
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:26,052
Is this your roommate?

410
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:28,031
Oh! Oh, yes.
That was so rude of me.

411
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,047
How could I forget?

412
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:30,112
Everyone, this is Chloe.

413
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:32,112
She's the bitch
in apartment 23.

414
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:37,090
Anyone wanna get weird
and play "Mario Kart"?

415
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:48,324
Hey, Jeremy.

416
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:50,659
- Where is everyone?
- June's at work,

417
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:53,659
and Dr. Clayton and nurse Nicole
are in a meeting.

418
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,588
Those two have
a lot of meetings, don't they?

419
00:16:59,638 --> 00:17:02,646
Hey, you know what's fun?

420
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,655
Alcohol.

421
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:07,650
Oh, yeah.
They're doing it.

422
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,625
They've been doing it
for so long,

423
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:11,662
and he's also doing
nurse Simone,

424
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,613
physical therapist Sheila,

425
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:17,575
and the lady with the limp
that sells car insurance.

426
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:27,740
Hey.

427
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:29,701
Oh, are you here
to cause drama?

428
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,022
I mean, do you have any idea

429
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:32,541
how hard it was for me
to get this job?

430
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,572
Mark here had to pull
some serious strings.

431
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:36,597
Oh, come on. It was nothing.

432
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,532
I just fired someone
for no reason

433
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:40,597
so I could hire a friend.
No big deal. I'm no hero.

434
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:43,609
Steven is sleeping
with nurse Nicole.

435
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,559
Why would I believe
anything you say?

436
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,542
It's true, dude.
Jeremy told me.

437
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,563
I love Steven.

438
00:17:49,564 --> 00:17:51,559
He would never cheat on me.

439
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,605
June, you're too trusting.

440
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,532
Yeah, I guess so.
I mean, I trusted you,

441
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,614
and look where that got me.

442
00:17:56,615 --> 00:17:59,610
Fine. You know what?
Forget it.

443
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,534
I was just trying to help.

444
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,563
June. Dawson.

445
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:07,604
Come here.
I know you're upset,

446
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:10,443
but Chloe's actually
trying to do the right thing.

447
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,404
Look, she may have
the morals of a pirate,

448
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:14,099
but she would do anything
for her friends.

449
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,318
Like this one year,
on my birthday,

450
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:18,215
I was in Vietnam, shooting
an energy drink commercial.

451
00:18:18,551 --> 00:18:20,520
She flew all my family
and friends out,

452
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:22,524
threw me this huge
surprise party. It was amazing.

453
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:25,576
Of course, she left me with the
bill, took all my credit cards.

454
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:31,526
Don't be a blonde dude
in a vietnamese jail, June.

455
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,580
That's
the real life lesson here.

456
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:45,526
Steven.

457
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:46,614
Chloe.

458
00:18:55,543 --> 00:18:57,589
- Aah!
- Uhh! Uhh!

459
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:00,529
All right, uh,
she seduced me, okay...

460
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,533
Just to prove to you
that he's a cheater.

461
00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:05,589
I can't... I'm not...

462
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:07,172
What... what the hell
is going on here?

463
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,284
Ooh.

464
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:11,222
I knew you were
cheating on her with me,

465
00:19:11,222 --> 00:19:12,289
but you're cheating on me
with <i>her?</i>

466
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,280
I thought I was
your only mistress,

467
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:17,259
you <i>son of a bitch!</i>

468
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,225
Ask her about the girl
that sells car insurance.

469
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:23,280
My... my sister?!

470
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:25,289
Oh! Oh! God!

471
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,251
Oh! Whoa!

472
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,197
Hey.

473
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,233
Okay, listen,
I knew that the only way

474
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:45,201
you would believe Steven
was a bad dude

475
00:19:45,202 --> 00:19:48,275
was to literally walk in on him
in the worst possible scenario...

476
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:52,196
having sex with your roommate
on your birthday cake.

477
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,276
That is the nicest thing
anyone has ever done for me.

478
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,260
How sad is that?

479
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:01,210
It's pretty sad.

480
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:05,197
I mean, if you hadn't
stepped in,

481
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:07,251
I probably wouldn't have
found out for another ten years.

482
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:09,193
I'd be divorced with two kids,

483
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:11,467
you know,
hiding fast food wrappers

484
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,779
in the waistband
of my mom jeans.

485
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:14,242
I mean...

486
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:20,200
you saved me from wasting
the best years of my life.

487
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:22,288
Yeah, well, you know,
it came at a price.

488
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:26,201
I got a lot of frosting
in my crack.

489
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:27,789
Sorry. I don't know why
I brought that up.

490
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:28,914
I think that genuine emotion

491
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:31,055
just sometimes
makes me feel uncomfortable.

492
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:32,285
Bartender, kamikaze shots.

493
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:35,238
Thank you.

494
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,285
Happy birthday?

495
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:39,239
Yeah.

496
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:45,196
Come on. Let's go home.

497
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:53,234
- Did we pay for those drinks?
- No. Hard times. Keep walking.

498
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,030
So did James actually shoot an
energy drink commercial in Vietnam?

499
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:59,631
Oh, yeah. It's really good.

500
00:20:59,723 --> 00:21:02,665
<i>High energy surge machine!</i>

501
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:03,753
<i>New cherry taste.</i>

502
00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:05,749
<i>Kapow!</i>

503
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:09,757
<i>Van Der Beek like.</i>

504
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:12,703
<i>Dawson is the moon!</i>

505
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:18,744
<i>What is this? I mean, what...</i>

506
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,680
<i>Could somebody get my agent
on the phone?</i>

507
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:22,719
<i>Have we... have we figured out
the country code yet?</i>

508
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:25,734
<i>Van Der Beek!</i>

509
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:38,848
