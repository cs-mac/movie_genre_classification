<i>Zhong Yu Tang is the king while you're a pawn. A pawn should listen to his king.</i>

<i>- You will be in Sales Team 3.<br>- Sales Team 3?!</i>

<i>The cemetery of the talented and the incinerator of MUSE?</i>

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Starting from now, I will...

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,300
specially monitor this section.

49
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,400
It can't be. Are the superiors serious?

50
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,790
Strange.

51
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,190
I've been in MUSE Cosmetics for 30 years.

52
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,580
From the time the company started 'til now,

53
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,200
the number of CEO's that have come and gone

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,600
is more than the number of shoes I've thrown out.

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,500
But there were never a CEO who focused on us Sales Team 3.

56
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,400
Such a big movement today... could it be...

57
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,800
could it be someone has offended the new CEO?

58
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,680
Me?

59
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,960
How could it be me?

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,300
It can't be. I don't even know him so why would he give Sales Team 3 a hard time just because of me.

61
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
Although I'm a newbie in sales,

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,700
I'm full of energy and passion.

63
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,100
I believe that as long as we work hard, there's nothing that we can't do!

64
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,390
Let's all strive together!

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Make our Sales Team 3 the grand prize winner for this year! Everyone say,

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,000
okay!

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
It's 12 o'clock sharp. Let's all eat outside.

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,800
- Okay, I'm so hungry.<br>- Otherwise, the supervisor will come looking for trouble again later.

69
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,610
We are not ordering take out?

70
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,000
Hui Xin, are you going with us or not?

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,400
- Right. I still have to call my nanny.<br>- Let's go...

72
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,600
Okay... you guys go first. I'll go the lavatory first for a while.

73
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,450
Let's do our best.

Zhong Yu Tang

75
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,000
cannot be defeated.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,400
You should never become like them who only work to wait for death,

77
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,600
a useless talent with a brain that only thinks about lunch and dinner.

78
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,220
Even you don't listen to me..?

79
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,800
Sigh. Always have to think hard of what to eat everyday...

80
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,200
Should we go to the Shabu-Shabu on the left side or the Roasted Chicken on the right side? Please decide, Team Leader.

81
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Shabu-shabu! Go as a group of four and you get one share for free!

<i>She likes to use her free time to secretly go the the market to buy ingredients.</i>

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,600
- $20 NTD<br>- How can that be?

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,100
Owner, this is not 3 kg of spring onions.

87
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,800
Okay, okay.

88
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
<i>Regarding the likes of housewives</i>

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,600
<i>and what's popular among the commoners, she knows them very well.</i>

90

<i>She's MUSE Cosmetics moving information bank.</i>

91

<i>Her brain automatically stores the previous years' amount of items sold and its sales numbers.</i>

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,400
<i>She's the only employee who owns 20% of the company's stocks that is not also a company executive.</i>

93
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,100
<i>Meng He... better at gossip than sales...</i>

<i>Auntie Type of Refresh Man</i>

95
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,600
Okay. It's agreed.

96
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,800
Eh, wait!

97
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,400

<i>And even was the top person of the year in a career magazine.</i>

104

<i>But after giving birth to her child...</i>

105

Little baby, I'll fetch you later after I get off from work. You have to be good.

- I'll leave this here. <br> - Okay.

Don't think about your child all the time.

112

117
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,200
Then do you want to take a look at my romance novel

<i>She entered MUSE as a cashier.</i>

129

<i>She thinks business is too complicated and busy and that she doesn't have the capabilities,</i>

<i>so she asked to be transferred.</i>

Jiang Hui Xin checks-in then sleeps.

132
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
It's lunch time! What are we eating, what are we eating?

<i>She only revives during lunch break.</i>

<i>No. You are destined to stand on top of this scattered desert.</i>

142

<i> how long you can keep it up.</i>

144

If there's no problems, then you have strong abilities,

I know. Let's go.

148
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,540
A bouquet of fresh flowers can cause lazy people

to change beyond recognition.

150
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,680
I must allow myself to be like

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,140
flowers in full bloom when reporting on my first day of work.

152
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,100
So foolish! Why cause yourself to be so tired?

153
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,100
The semi annual reporting with W Corporation.

154
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,400
Director Zheng likes to drink English milk tea with double cream and sugar.

155
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,000
This Elsa would most likely not know.

156
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,200
Section Chief!

157
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,300
I ask to be excuse for 10 mins and go back to the secretary department to take care of some turnover work.

158
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,200
Perfect example of being subjugated by one authority but remaining loyal to another.

159
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,200
This little girl completely doesn't understand the situation.

160
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,800
This can only lead to a cold rebuke despite having shown warm feelings.

161
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,200
Right. She's only begging to be rebuffed. She's so idle.

162
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,000
If I had known earlier, I would have asked her to stand in line for me to buy a limited edition bag.

163
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,200
Tada!

164
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,000
The scent of the glue will cause the baby to have an allergic reaction.

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,100
Sorry.

166
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,800
Be careful!

167
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
This is the English mlik tea with double cream and sugar that Director Zheng likes to drink.

168
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
Every time he comes, he always instructs me to make this.

169
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Don't make a fuss, Director Zheng will be upset.

170
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,620
That's right. I'm sorry.

171
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,000
What are you doing here?

172
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,800
Open the door for me now. I want to bring this in.

173
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,600
Ai Sha.

174
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,000
Director Zheng likes to drink English milk tea the most.

175
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,200
I have especially added double the amount of cream and sugar.

176
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,200
Thank you for your advice.

177
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,800
But this month's Korea magazine just interviewed Director Zheng.

178
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,600
Director Zhong mentioned that his mother passed away after being diagnosed with diabetes,

179
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,400
because of that, he is considered to be at high risk for diabetes.

180
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,660
He isn't able to drink English milk tea with double cream and sugar.

181
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,560
And that is why I changed it to Jingdong matcha.

182
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,180
Director Zheng, you won't blame me for asserting my own assumptions, right?

183
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,600
This cup of Jingdong matcha,

184
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,820
is made using hundred year-old green tea, carefully and thoroughly.

185
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,270
Bittersweet and wonderfully scented.

186
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,800
It is good for diabetes and good for your health.

187
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,900
Okay.

188
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,500
It's really good.

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,200
Your new secretary is excellent.

190
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,900
She is very attentive.

191
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,100
Director Zheng, you're overpraising.

192
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,800
By the way, why are you still here?

193
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,200
Weren't you already transferred to Sales Team 3? There's nothing for you to do here. Please leave.

194
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Sorry, excuse me. I will leave now.

195
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,400
- Sorry, we'll continue. <br> - Okay.

196
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,600
I always thought Yu Tang was going to safely get MUSE's top secretary position.

197
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,620
Who knew that after Ai Sha came,

198
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,580
I'd realize the true abilities of a head secretary? Perfection!

199
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,100
Yes.

200
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,800
Hey, to drop from our secretary division

201
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,350
to that garbage-like Sales Team 3...

202
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,470
It's literally like dropping from heaven to hell!

203
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,950
Yu Tang fell hard this time.

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,900
You feel sympathetic towards her?

205
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,200
I feel like she brought this upon herself.

206
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,100
Did you see her bring the milk tea in earlier?

207
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,600
- She looked so proud of herself <br>- Yeah.

208
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,200
She doesn't even know what she is capable of.

209
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
No wonder she lost to Ai Sha.

210
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000
This level of skill is far too great.

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,100
That's right.

212
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,300
You two...

213
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Do you want me to move your offices here? It's very convenient to talk here.

214
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,200
Go now.

215
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,100
- Yes.<br>- Yes.

216
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,800
So the person who really didn't understand reality...

217
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,660
was me.

218
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,600
Chief...

219
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,220
the main brand Mei Mei that Sales Team 3 is responsible for...

220
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,990
why can't I find the newest business for this year?

221
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,500
<i>It smells so good. I like this fragrance.</i>

222
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,040
<i>Wash using Mei Mei, and you'll become "Mei Mei." <br> (Mei Mei=beautiful)</i>

223
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,350
<i>Yu Tang likes Mei Mei that much?</i>

224
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,050
<i>Then you should go to Mei Mei to work when you grow up.</i>

225
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,000
<i>Okay, Mom. It's agreed then. Let's make a promise.</i>

226
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,100
Mom, I'm really working in the sales department of Mei Mei now,

227
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,900
but I didn't imagine that

228
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,600
it would be under such a harsh environment.

229
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,000
Wait.

230
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,000
- What's wrong? <br>- Your jacket.

231
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,000
Thanks.

232
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh right, did you get William's favorite 91 Burgundy Red Wine for me?

233
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,200
Without this bottle, I couldn't even get in the front door.

234
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,200
No wonder Director Zheng praised you.

235
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,400
Let's go.

236
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,300
That is already not a level I can climb to.

237
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Sorry, it's all been sold out.

238
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,000
What? It's sold out?

239
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,600
Why do you look so tired? Have you eaten yet?

240
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,000
I haven't eaten yet.

241
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,700
I'm starving to death!

242
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,200
Here, two eggs and two pieces of cheese.

243
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,300
Eh, pretending to cry? I'm not giving this to you.

244
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
Give it to me!

245
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,800
Was today's business that good? Everything is already sold out.

246
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,600
Do you think that's possible?

247
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,000
Dad didn't go to the market today, so there aren't any ingredients to make three servings of food for us.

248
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,850
I know, my omurice isn't as good as your mom's.

249
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,400
I don't know what it's missing so business can't improve.

250
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,300
No way. I think it tastes really good.

251
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,100
It's my favorite.

252
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,800
I find that his is okay.

253
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,600
Why don't you let me drink it instead of throwing it away? Such a waste!

254
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm going after the world's highest-level first-place coffee-latte art title.

255
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,700
You can't drink it if it's not done well.

256
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh, that's right, Sis. Shouldn't you treat Dad and me to a big meal?

257
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,800
What big meal?

258
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
You really love to act.

259
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,700
How long have you waited for that position?

260
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,600
Son, just stay here at home, it's a lot easier.

261
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,400
Dad, if we don't go to a restaurant, it's not considered a celebration.

262
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,500
Sis, you're now an executive secretary.

263
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,400
The restaurant is going to be more classy, right?

264
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,530
Yes. I'm now...

265
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,800
My position has changed.

266
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,200
Sis, there's this amazing top notch restaurant.

267
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,800
What about this? Let's set it at tomorrow. I'll make the reservations, I'll make the reservations.

268
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,000
Okay, okay, fine.

269
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,800
How can I tell them that I didn't just not get a promotion

270
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,060
but I also got degraded?

271
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,800
This wont' do. I can't be brought down by Ji Wen Kai.

272
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:40,050
That type of person doesn't deserve my anger.

273
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,400
At least I have a day off. I don't need to work.

274
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,100
I don't have to see that petty person's face!

275
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,100
And I get to sleep until I naturally wake up.

276
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,800
<i>Everyone listen carefully. Aunties and uncles, grandmas and grandpas,</i>

277
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,000
<i>I have a very important thing to announce!</i>

278
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,200
<i>- Zhong Yu Tang!<br>- Ji Wen Kai is</i>

279
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,000
<i>going to confess to the girl he likes!</i>

280
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
<i>The recorded love confession will be broadcasted live later!<i></i></i>

281
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:32,750
<i>It'll be live! Everyone please give Ji Wen Kai lots of support and encouragement!<i></i></i>

282
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,600
You called me up this early just to bring this thing over?

283
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,600
Why are you wearing sunglasses? Is the sun even out?

284
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
I look handsome.

285
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,400
What else then? What are friends for?

286
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,100
Friends are of use on social networking sites. So please...

287
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,850
don't bother me with such small things, okay?

288
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,100
I'm going to sleep.

289
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,600
Hey.

290
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,600
Trust me, friends are for bothering.

291
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,500
Let's go.

292
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:42,200
All the locals, neighbors, aunties, uncles, grandpas, grandmas. Everyone good morning.

293
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Today the chief of the office has something very important to announce.

294
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,000
<i>Zhong Yu Tang, who was top in her class since childhood,</i>

295
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,600
<i>has been transferred from MUSE's secretarial office to the sales team. I repeat, from the secretarial office to the sales team.</i>

296
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,600
<i>Zhong Yu Tang has gone from executive secretary to office clerk.</i>

297
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,400
<i>So, I'm asking people to give support to this Refresh Man.</i>

298
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
<i>Zhong Yu Tang, wake up!</i>

299
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,600
What's going on?

300
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,000
<i>Make me breakfast quickly. Wake up, wake up!</i>

301
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm not dreaming!

302
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,200
Make breakfast for me now.

303
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,700
Zhong Yu Tang. Hey! Are you home?

304
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,840
Zhong Yu Tang, hi.

305
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,800
Ji Wen Kai, what are you trying to do?

306
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,400
Can't you leave me alone? I have the day off today!

307
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Hey, hurry up and come down. It's time to eat breakfast.

308
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,200
Remember to brush your teeth and wash your face. All the locals good morning!

309
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,400
I have a very important thing to announce.

310
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,800
This person, who's living at number fi—

311
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,200
You! Shut up!

312
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,000
Hi.

313
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,300
- Who are you?<br>- My friend.

314
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,000
You want me to shut up? Catch me if you can.

315
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,200
Ji Wen Kai!

316
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,800
Everyone, uncles and aunts, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers,

317
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,000
I want to announce something to everyone.

318
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,480
- Ji Wen Kai!<br>-Miss Zhong Yu Tang has transferred from the position of MUSE's

319
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,800
executive secretary to office clerk.

320
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,400
Don't let me catch you!

321
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,800
Stop it right now!

322
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,400
She is so cute. Don't you feel bad about it?

323
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,450
I don't.

324
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,800
Zhong Yu Tang! Run faster with those little legs. Don't you want me to shut up?

325
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,600
Listen carefully everyone. The girl who would score number one since childhood—

326
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,200
- What's wrong with this car?<br>- I forgot to tell you,

327
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,100
rhis car isn't reliable. Its engine is thirty years old, practically the same age as us.

328
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,200
What, what, what? You just asked me for a car, you didn't say you were gonna drive it.

329
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,800
What would you use a car for if not to drive?!

330
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,200
Ji Wen Kai!

331
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,300
Hey, hurry, she's catching up! Hit the gas pedal all the way!

332
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,400
I've already pressed it down all the way!

333
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,800
Everyone, don't forget, when it's breakfast time—

334
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,000
there is something to announce to everyone. It's very important and everyone must hear it.

335
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,200
You must let her know of your support for her transfer!

336
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,400
Okay. Bye-bye.

337
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,900
I'm not playing anymore.

338
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,600
- Are you going back?<br>- Yeah I'm going back to sleep.

339
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,800
- Bye. <br>- Bye-bye.

340
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,900
Want some shaved ice?

341
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,800
Wait for me!

342
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,700
Uncle Wang!

343
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,200
Long time no see.

344
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,600
It's Ji Wen Kai.

345
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,400
Uncle Wang.

346
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
Hey, Yu Tang?

347
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,200
I didn't imagine that your relationship is that good.

348
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,600
You're even eating shaved ice together?

349
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,970
Hey, not bad.

350
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,600
That year, you would never pass your tests. I was scared you wouldn't graduate.

351
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,250
Look at you now! Who would have thought?

352
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,200
Uncle, we'll have the usual.

353
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Okay, the usual order.

354
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,000
The better person can pay.

355
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,000
Ji Wen Kai, what exactly are you doing?

356
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,800
Ji Wen Kai!

357
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,400
I heard my dad talking out here and I couldn't believe it.

358
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:25,950
You've become so handsome!

359
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,090
Wang Hai Di, don't go crazy for the flowers!

360
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,800
Hi, Hai Di.

361
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,700
You still remember me?

362
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,900
You're right.

363
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,200
Back in those days I was also a class flower (the prettiest girls in a class).

364
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
You remember?

365
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,400
Although at that time, I didn't pay close attention...

366
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,000
This place is still the same as ten years ago.

367
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,410
Are you trying to say that

368
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,020
I haven't changed at all?

369
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,500
That's what you said.

370
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,800
Hey. I say, Zhong Yu Tang,

371
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,600
I swear, the way you talk is so inaccurate.

372
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
The Ji Wen Kai now,

373
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,880
isn't like the guy you said he was before.

374
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,400
How can you say that!? Be quiet!

375
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,200
What else did she say?

376
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,200
She said you were super naive and careful.

377
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,600
And mischievous... it was so funny!

378
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,400
I'm coming! A double egg-yolk shaved ice coming up!

379
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,000
Here, eat.

380
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,700
Wasn't this your favorite?

381
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,400
You haven't eaten this for ten years. You must have missed it.

382
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,000
What's wrong? Want me to share some with you?

383
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,430
No, thanks.

384
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,200
You never heard that when women past the age of 25,

385
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,800
their metabolism will slow down?

386
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,000
Aren't you afraid your cholesterol levels will be high and you'll have a stroke?

387
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,600
It was out of the kindness of my heart to share some with you.

388
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,200
No need.

389
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,400
I am a very important CEO.

390
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,400
My health is very important.

391
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,300
Hai Di, take this.

392
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,600
Thanks.

393
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,000
Uncle Wang.

394
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,300
Give me a bowl of plain ice.

395
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,500
Okay. Eh, I almost forgot.

396
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,900
Old rules, if you want to eat shaved ice, please take out your report cards.

397
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,800
<i>First?</i>

398
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
<i>Excellent.</i>

399
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,400
<i>What about yours?</i>

400
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,500
<i>It's still the same with so many red marks?</i>

401
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,400
<i> Hey, Ji Wen Kai, this seems to be the</i>

402
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,600
<i> fifty-eighth time I've beaten you.</i>

403
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,600
<i>Sorry. You will have pick up the tab again today.</i>

404
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,500
<i> Thank you.</i>

405
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,800
<i>This is the taste of victory!</i>

406
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,600
<i> When it's free, it tastes especially good.</i>

407
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,900
<i> Add some fighting spirt, huh?</i>

408
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,210
<i>You need to win and get your pride back.</i>

409
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,830
<i>Uncle Wang will treat you to a huge bowl of shaved snow.</i>

410
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,400
CEO? Hmm, that's pretty impressive.

411
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Eh? What is this?

412
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,100
Dad! This is a black platinum credit card.

413
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,100
There's no limit, you can swipe as much as you want.

414
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,600
This card can not only buy this entire store,

415
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,000
but also this entire street!

416
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,600
Wow, that impressive? Hey, let's return this to him.

417
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,300
Eh, Yu Tang, what about you?

418
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,740
Today I left the door too quickly,

419
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,780
so I didn't get the chance to take anything.

420
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,140
Here is Yu Tang's report card.

421
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:37,080
Dad... without comparing you should know, so it's uncomfortable to say...

422
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,100
I see.

423
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,540
It's very rare for Wen Kai to win over Yu Tang.

424
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,600
Yu Tang will buy today's shaved ice.

425
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,870
- Why do I have to buy? <br> - Ehhh!

426
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,800
This is my store. We play by my rules.

427
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,200
Kiddo, you've won 58 times already,

428
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,460
just giving in once isn't too bad.

429
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:06,010
Good kid, I'll get a large order of shaved ice for you!

430
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,260
Okay!

431
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,200
How can there be a man as selfish as you?

432
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,940
I think you're just getting me back for every single thing I did.

433
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,400
Oh, what a coincidence. We come for shaved ice and you've brought my business card.

434
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:26,000
What else then? You think I've just been sleeping these past ten years?

435
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
If you're not satisfied, then turn your life around as a sales clerk.

436
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
- I—<br>- I'm afraid,

437
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,290
you're so used to your secretarial position,

438
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,200
that you can't take off your high heels and go down to sales.

439
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,300
Wow! How great is it to be a CEO!

440
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,310
If you dare to provoke me, Zhong Yu Tang. Be prepared to lose everything, you loser!

441
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,400
It's been ten years, and your body lines are starting to sag.

442
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,190
I hope it's not just your voice that you can raise.

443
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,600
You—! I will definitely win and show you!

444
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,400
Hai Di! Let's go.

445
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,400
You need to pay!

446
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,780
Don't you have a platinum card?!

447
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,000
Where are you going?!

448
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,300
- Wen Kai. <br> - Yes? <br> - Once you irritate a woman,

449
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,800
you'll be pursued for your whole life.

450
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,400
Really? Perfect.

451
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,000
In the past, I pursued her. Now it's her pursuing me.

452
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,600
You're shaved ice is almost ready.

453
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,200
What are you doing? Why am I coming in here?

454
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Tang, why did you bring me here?

455
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
You're wearing your pajamas! Why are we shopping?

456
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,400
Who said I'm here to shop? I'm here to wear my armour.

457
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,500
The battle of me as a Refresh Man...

458
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,850
it starts from now on!

459
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,200
Battle?

460
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,700
Here.

461
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,600
Here, take this.

462
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,810
Take this.

463
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,900
Hai Di, foot the bill.

464
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,100
Me!?

465
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,500
Does it look like I've brought my wallet?

466
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,210
No way!

467
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,320
You are still shopping?

468
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,800
I'm home.

469
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Daughter, we are ready.

470
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,640
Why are you both dressed like this?

471
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,540
We are going to a high class restaurant.

472
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,970
Don't tell me you forgot! You're lacking sincerity.

473
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,510
I almost forgot.

474
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,590
How about I quickly use the restroom and change my clothes, so that we can go?

475
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,940
I totally forgot.

476
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:29,650
Which one of you locked the door again? I'm in a rush.

486
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,570
What are you doing here?

487
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,230
<i>Daughter, this is...</i>

488
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,230
Xiao Kai said that he wants to eat with us. <br><i>(Xiao Kai is a nickname; "xiao" means "little") </i>

489
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,970
I invited him and he accepted.

490
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,150
That's right. I haven't seen Daddy Zhong and Yu Han in such a long time.

491
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,170
We should get together and have a meal once in a while.

492
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,970
Hurry up.

493
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,980
Am I the goddess of unluckiness? Why won't he leave me alone?

494
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,170
If he comes along to eat with us,

495
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:54,000
then the fact that I didn't get the promotion will come to light!

496
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,180
<i>Da Antonio Italian Restaurant</i>

497
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,600
That's right, Kai Ge. What have you been up to these last few years?

498
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,860
These few years I've been working abroad.

499
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,030
For real?

500
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,400
Working and studying abroad. So cool!

501
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,420
If you knew what work I was doing, you wouldn't find it so cool.

502
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,960
Why is all the food on the menu so expensive?

503
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,150
Should we go to another restaurant?

504
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,670
Dad, it's so embarrassing to leave without even ordering.

505
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:37,030
Kai Ge, what do you want to eat? Sis is going to pay.

506
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,760
She's going to pay?

507
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,150
Oh, then I won't be so courteous then. Waiter!

508
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,560
Order as you wish.

509
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,260
I want...

510
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,820
I want this set at NT$5,280.

511
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,470
Make it four servings.

512
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,470
Before we eat, let's raise our glasses.

513
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,940
Okay.

514
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,950
Let's congratulate Zhong Yu Tang for becoming more and more...

515
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,950
Hey! Ji Wen Kai.

516
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:15,020
Have you lost weight recently?

517
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,280
So pitiful. You must be working too hard.

518
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,220
It's better that you eat more meat

519
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,360
and talk less.

520
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,130
Understand?

521
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,550
It's fine!

522
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,550
I will eat to my fill later.

523
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,190
What's more important now is that we still need to congratulate Yu Tang.

524
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,280
I need to fix my makeup.

525
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,130
Daughter, we're congratulating you on successfully changing your profession.

526
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,320
Let's raise our glasses.

527
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,950
Being a secretary is a dead end, where you earn dead money.

528
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,970
Now in sales, you can earn living money.

529
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,760
The possibilities are endless!

530
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,000
That's right.

531
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,940
Your sister is making big bucks now. Congratulations!

532
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,300
Congratulations!

533
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,290
Thank you.

534
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,800
How did you guy know about this?

535
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,090
The people fixing the screen doors and windows announced it so loudly this morning.

536
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,550
Everyone knows.

537
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,770
Oh right, Xiao Kai. How did you know about her change in profession?

538
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:30,280
Oh... Yu Tang and I are working in the same company now.

539
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,000
Oh! You're working in security? That fits you well.

540
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,760
Sis originally wanted me to apply for a job there, but I'm a coffee connoisseur.

541
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,060
Siblings think alike, huh?

542
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,640
Dad, Yu Han,

543
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,140
let me make the introductions.

544
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,050
This is our company's new CEO.

545
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:06,460
He is more senior than the director.

546
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,730
He's a famous person now!

547
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,770
Xiao Kai, after our meal,

548
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:14,470
come to our store and autograph our wall.

549
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,200
Having the support of a famous person like you will boost our business!

550
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,300
- Yes, yes, yes!<br>- Mr. Kai, you're a CEO now.

551
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,760
Then you must know latte master, Terry Yang. Please, I want to be his apprentice!

552
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,290
You two! Don't you think treating someone who use to <i>work</i> for us

553
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:31,890
like this... is a little embarrassing?

554
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,400
Not at all.

555
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,510
Daughter, Xiao Kai is our family member.

556
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,400
Being proud of our family member is normal!

557
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,940
We are proud of Brother Kai.

558
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,580
Kai Ge, cheers.

559
00:39:49,190 --> 00:40:00,190
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Marvelous Rivals @ Viki </i>

560
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,150
<i>Ji Wen Kai, you wait and see.</i>

561
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,310
<i>I will definitely impress you.</i>

562
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:20,160
<i>And revert the hierarchical statuses between us back to how they were ten years ago.</i>

563
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,180
Please, Director.

564
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,860
Aiyo, aren't you making it hard for me?

565
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:43,250
The clients for Sales Team #3 are all long-term and loyal clients. How could I give the client list to you?

566
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:47,790
You want to develop a business? Then you must do it yourself, right?

567
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,770
Hello? Sister Jia Yin isn't here yet.

568
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,430
I can take a message for you.

569
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:15,560
Di Shi Kang? Yes, I know you are a pharmacy store that sells our "Mei Mei" products.

570
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,120
An emergency that requires she go over there immediately? Yes, I got it.

571
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,980
Yes, I'll pass on the message for you. Thank you.

572
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,360
Sister Jia Yin, Di Shi Kang just called and said—

573
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,420
I heard.

574
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,130
Oh no, I can't go over there today.

575
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,020
Last night, when I was changing my son's diaper,

576
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,830
I found a red spot on his butt!

577
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:44,790
I suspect the nanny is abusing him, so I must monitor the video feed all day.

578
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,400
But... but they said it was an emergency.

579
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,840
No one gets to bully my son!

580
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,470
Jia Yin, since you don't have time right now,

581
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:02,840
why not leave Di Shi Kang to Yu Tang?

582
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,800
<i>Zhong Yu Tang, not in office</i>

583

<i>This is my first time going on a trip as a business person.</i>

584
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,300
<i>Dad said that working outside the office tests your strength and endurance.</i>

585
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,210
<i>There are more opportunities here than there are staying in the office all day.</i>

586
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,430
Excuse me, where are the Mei Mei products?

587
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,830
They should be over there.

588
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,030
Excuse me miss, do you know where the Mei Mei products are?

589
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:11,210
- Over there. <br>- Okay, thank you.

590
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:20,210
- Excuse me, do you know where the Mei Mei products are?

591
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:21,660
They're right there.

592

<i>[Mei Mei]</i>

593
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,790
Mei Mei should be put at this height.

594
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,220
That way, it can be at the most customers' eye level,

595
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,650
and make them want to make a purchase.

596
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,230
It's almost time for the meeting.

597
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,680
Excuse me. May I ask where the manager's office is?

598
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,920
- Third floor. <br> - Alright...

599
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,250

602
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,550
What?

603
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,400
I'm sorry.

604
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,860
I'm sorry. I probably didn't listen clearly just now.

605
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,280
You said...?

You didn't hear incorrectly.

00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,490
Not to mention we have partnered with Di Shi Kang for so many years.

626
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,450
Why is this so sudden?

627
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,960
Sorry, I have a meeting to attend. Please go back first.

628
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,530
But—

629
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,890
But I—!

630
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,910
<i>How could this happened?</i>

631
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,910
<i>The first client that I worked so hard to get</i>

632
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,250
<i>wants to terminate the contract?</i>

633
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,320
<i>If you're not satisfied,</i>

634
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,860
<i>change your lifestyle as a Refresh Man.</i>

635
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,910
Give it to me.

636
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:20,450
I heard about the products going off the shelves situation. Is it serious?

637
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,160
This was my first client.

638
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,740
Business hasn't even been expanded yet

639
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,680
and now it is coming off the shelves.

640
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,690
And I even bought clothes for the job.

641
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,980
Are you happy now?

642
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,840
You can laugh if you want.

643
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,950
If you're here to look for sympathy,

644
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:19,490
I've already done what you asked for.

645
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,620
Hurry and go back.

646
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,410
♫<i> My uncertain footsteps are slow, </i>♫

647
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,990
♫<i> although I’m nervous. </i>♫

648
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,780
I'm here to advise you.

649
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,400
In twenty minutes, I will hold the Sales Team 3 meeting.

650
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,960
Do what you have to.

651
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,420
Are you not going to give me a ride since you're heading back?

652
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,480
What are the feet of a businessperson for?

653
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,220
It's almost time.

654
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,690
<i>Twenty minutes?</i>

655
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,870
<i>Would you like coffee?</i>

656
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:28,340
<i>That</i> person is about to come report for duty.

657
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,440
Okay... when it's time, let the east wind enter <i> (let that person come in to help)</i>.

658
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,610
These are the decisions from the board of directors.

659
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,650
The big cases that have to be fulfilled this year.

660
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,830
Two-thousand YOURS Retail chain-stores' collaboration cases.

661
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,350
It'll be given to Sales Team 1 to handle.

662
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,910
Sales Team 1... is the elite among the elite,

663
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,720
the people on the top of the pyramid.

664
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,480
Letting them negotiate high-end merchandise is no problem of course.

665
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,630
But...?

666
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,430
But... it's different this time.

667
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:16,710
The flagship of YOURS is regardless of class and borders.

668
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:20,110
Using the method of penetrating into family households for sales.

669
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:21,710
This time MUSE must

670
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:23,560
think of a way

671
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,040
to get into each level of dressing tables and sinks.

672
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,280
Only this type of sales method

673
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,680
can make the upcoming case a success.

674
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:39,050
Bring the YOURS proposal and follow me.

675
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,590
A coffee a day

676
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:56,500
makes happiness seem everlasting! Anyone want coffee?

677
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,970
Ah, I forgot! I have to...

678
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,520
Everyone stop what you're doing.

679
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,970
I have something to announce.

680
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:29,810
Come to the front.

681
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,320
Is there a problem today?

682
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,240
What I'm holding in my hand,

683
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,800
present in two thousand places across the country,

684
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,950
is the very powerful YOURS chain-store project.

685
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,090
I want each one of you,

686
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,060
within three months,

687
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,360
to settle the YOURS shelve-stocking distribution agreement.

688
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,960
Note that

689
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,820
it includes each— one— of— you.

690
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,190
You're so funny! How can it be only three months?

691
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:22,020
I probably can... you guys...

692
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:30,430
Even my grandma doesn't use this type of cellphone.

693
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,650
Do you think this is my first day on the job?

694
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,170
I don't recall MUSE's

695
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:49,700
cooperation with this company.

696
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,150
How much longer do you need?

697
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,420
Half a month.

698
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:06,120
- Clear it all right now! <br> - Yes! CEO, I've done wrong.

699
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,050
I don't want to see

700
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:12,430
you guys messing things up.

701
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:15,880
I'm telling you guys...

702
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,760
If you don't reach my requirements within three months,

703
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,160
the notice of dismissal

704
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,900
will be the

705
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:30,850
last document that will have your personal signature.

706
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,020
Also...

707
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,580
if there are any clients

708
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,880
who want to terminate their contract,

709
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,040
I want you to put your life on the line to get it back!

710
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:58,150
There are a lot of people who can order lunch here at MUSE.

711
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:01,110
I don't need to spend money to support this department.

712
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:02,920
<i>Refresh Man fact #2 </i>

713
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,740
<i>Don't worry when the sky is falling down </i>

714
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:09,060
<i>since there is definitely someone who will have to hold up. </i>

715
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,160
<i>But if you're the unlucky one who</i>

716
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,660
<i>has to face the consequences...</i>

717
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,360
<i>don't get flustered as well because...</i>

718
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,070
<i>there is bound to be more unfortunate things to come.</i>

719
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:24,130
Okay.

720
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,390
One last thing I have to announce.

721
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:28,450
Come in!

722
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:31,100
Hello!

723
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:40,340
This is

724
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,610
your new colleague, Chen You Rui.

725
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,250
Everyone, I'm Chen You Rui.

726
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,400
Not bad. You guys have quite the spirit.

727
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,600
Zhong Yu Tang?

728
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,790
You could even recognize me this way?

729
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,990
What are you doing here?

730
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:58,150
You both know each other?

731
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:59,630
She is my girlfriend.

You both know each other?

She is my girlfriend.

743
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,870
That was two years ago.

744
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:39,110
Oh!

745
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:45,340
Romeo, are you done talking?

746
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,190
Remember this, it's three months. Did you hear me?

747
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:56,020
Yes, sir.

748
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,310
Zhou Yu Tang, why don't you pick up my phone calls?

749
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,740
I've spent so much time trying to find you.

750
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,270
Everyone gather together.

751
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,910
We need to discuss how that YOURS case is going to move forward.

752
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:22,020
Jia Yin, get the sales reports to me tomorrow morning.

753
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:25,840
And then tomorrow afternoon, Hui Xin and Liang Yu will come with me to observe the stores.

754
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:30,090
- We need to see where our clients are spending their money. <br> - Let's go.

755
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:37,740
Then Yu Tang and her ex-boyfriend should stay and watch over the office.

756
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,010
My, that scared me!

757
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:42,310
What a huge contrast.

758
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,520
Come out with me!

759
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,840
Woah! Gentler! Hey!

760
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,570
Hey!

761
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,670
That new CEO that just came doesn't have problems in his head, right?

762
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:03,270
Why is he handing such a huge project to us?

763
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:07,330
A meat pie which fell from the heavens is a trap.<br><i>("Meat pie" and "trap" sound similar in Chinese)</i>

764
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:10,210
He obviously wants us to die.

765
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:13,030
Jia Wen Qing, who cares if he is a meat pie or a trap?

766
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,240
If he is a meat pie, then eat him.

767
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,500
If he is a trap...

768
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,010
we can just push those two Refresh Men!

769
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,360
No matter how big the earth and sky are, we just need to fill our bellies.

770
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,240
Hey, it's almost lunchtime.

771
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,290
- What should we eat? <br>- What should we eat?

772
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,030
- Fish soup? Helps increase lactation.

773
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:30,180
No. How about pizza delivery?

774
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,660
After all that, I've lost all creativity.

775
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,880
Do you want low fat food?

776
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,320
Sure, let me know once you've decided.

777
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,440
Have some creativity.

778
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:52,260
Even though Chen You Rui is reputed to be the Casanova of MUSE Cosmetics,

779
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:57,970
I never thought that Yu Tang was also one of his former girlfriends.

780
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,530
What is so surprising about that?

781
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:01,260
Haven't you heard of the best match for a turtle is a green bean,

782
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,460
and the best match for a flea is a bed bug?

783
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,880
Everyone has their place in life. <br><i>(T/N: Literally translates to one hole for one radish.)</i>

784
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:11,980
<i>What kind of place is this?</i>

785
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,600
<i>I'll just wait and see when you guys clean this place up.</i>

786
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,600
I have not been kabe-don before.

787
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,250
Can you be a little gentle?

788
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:27,960
I'm warning you.

789
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,750
Don't you dare even bring up the words "ex-boyfriend" in front of anyone.

790
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,310
Otherwise...

791
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,520
But we've held hands...!

792
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,480
A relationship so touching.. you wouldn't have—

793
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,000
Hey! I was crossing the road and almost fell, and you just happened to lend me a hand. That's it, okay?

794
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,040
The next day I saw you flirting with someone else and blacklisted your number.

795
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,790
- What relationship?<br>-But...

796
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:53,130
I've already given my true heart.

797
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,200
Can't you tell?

798
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,210
Forget it.

799
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,890
If you can even resist this trick of mine which no one could.

800
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:12,680
Looks like I should tidy up.

801
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,310
Very good.

802
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,430
I'm making this clear to you.

803
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:20,570
We have only a working relationship and nothing else. Understand?

804
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:21,970
Okay, I get it.

805
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:24,020
Peace and love, right?

806
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,880
Peace and love.

807
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,450
There is only peace. No love.

808
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:32,450
Don't worry.

809
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:36,020
Anyways, I need to stay here for a month.

810
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,590
Next month is our anniversary sale.

811
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:41,650
MUSE Cosmetics can't be without this sales god, Chen You Rui.

812
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,890
Or else the stock drops ten percent.

813
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:47,950
To put it frankly, everyone, I'm here to save you.

814
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:55,200
- Yes. <br>- Yes.

815
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,580
<i> Good! You've got it.</i>

816
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:03,240
Zhong Yu Tang, calm down. Everything will be peaceful.

817
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,310
Peace.

818
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,830
Since you're the savior of Sales Team #3,

819
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,970
I'll give the biggest case to you.

820
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,830
No problem!

821
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:18,410
Chen You Rui, Chen You Rui.

822
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,270
Chen You Rui, sales god, Chen You Rui.

823
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:23,300
Good! Yeah! Yes!

824
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,200
Wait a minute.

825
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:30,600
Didn't the Director say that this case needs to be handled by each and every one of us?

826
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:35,410
You're giving it to this flower boy? I don't think that's very safe.

827
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,860
I say, young lady, you...

828
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,540
Why do you care about how the boss assigned this?

829
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:43,270
Once the boss is gone, we can reassign it ourselves.

830
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:44,940
Wait a minute.

831
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:49,950
Why don't you two ex-lovers take care of this case together?

832
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:51,520
That's fine with me, I don't find it awkward.

833
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,670
That's a plan!

834
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:57,630
<i> I'm already being pushed the edge with the Di Shi Kang products being taken off the shelves.</i>

835
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:00,500
<i>How can I take on another big case?</i>

836
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,460
Director, it's fine.

837
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,630
I think you should just assign it.

838
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,410
Okay, it's agreed.

839
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:14,740
Xia Zhi Hui?

840
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,330
God really does have a good eye.

841
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:19,390
Their big manager is a woman!

842
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:21,740
Everyone, leave this up to me.

843
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,010
I'll get it done within a week.

844
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,430
Hey, handsome boy. Their small manager is a man.

845
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:32,260
A man?

846
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:37,930
My colleagues at the counters told me that though Shen You Rui is really good with women.

847
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:44,290
But whenever he meets a man (a hard task), he'll immediately... [chokes] become mute.

848
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,730
And can't get a word out.

849
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:49,730
No, not... Listen to me, guys.

850
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:51,100
Actually...

851
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,670
Back down.

852
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,360
Everyone has their own field of speciality.

853
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,830
Must you be so heartless?

854
01:01:56,830 --> 01:02:00,380
Hello, I'm sales assistant, Jiang Hui Xing.

855
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,480
Hui Xin, is there anything you need my help for?

856
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:10,760
Ah Jiao Bento Store, five signature-

857
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,840
Sorry. Originally this task was meant for Yu Tang.

858
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,400
But, you came after her. So now it's yours.

859
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,740
- I— <br> - Oh right!

860
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:22,230
Extra spicy carrots and pickled vegetables. Thank you!

861
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,600
Hey! Have you ever seen someone like me buy lunch—?

862
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,440
Yu Tang, what is this?

863
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,000
Hey! You—

864
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,440
Guys, I don't know how to get lunch. Guys?

865
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,940
Hello?

866
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:37,140
Hello?

867
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,980
Hello, CEO.

868
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,450
I don't understand.

869
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:48,710
Shen You Rui's performance is considered really good.

870
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:53,020
Why did you move the prince of VIP to Sales Team #3?

871
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:56,580
He wasn't a player in my original game of chess.

872
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,890
He burst in unexpectedly.

873
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:00,440
It might be a good thing.

874
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,590
After all the saying goes, "It's better for things to come at the right time than early."

875
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:05,850
At least there are more players.

876
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:13,170
Putting qualified personnel in Sales Team #3... wouldn't they turn out bad too?

877
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,480
All these Refresh Men who have different symptoms, if up until this point,

878
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,540
still do not know to save themselves.

879
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,440
Then I have to come out myself,

880
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,240
to get them up to standard before they all rot.

881
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,020
Isn't it just about buying bentos?

882
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,620
Why do we have to go get diapers and storybooks as well?

883
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,250
I actually think it's interesting.

884
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:47,810
Why do you have to drag me into buying lunches with you?

885
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:51,670
Before in sales, I would be eating French cuisine with VIP customers.

886
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:55,450
Even if there isn't, female colleagues would willingly bring me a Japanese bento.

887
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:57,120
How would I know how to get to the bento shop?

888
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,260
For goodness sake!

889
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,390
Stop recalling your amazing accomplishments from the past, okay?

890
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:04,190
Don't you know that the company has already dealt with you like waste?

891
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:05,870
Waste?

892
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:09,860
I'm outstanding achiever Shen You Rui.

893
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:12,240
It's weird. What exactly did I do wrong?

894
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,450
It probably would have something to with your luck in love.

895
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:20,720
Peach blossom... oh, I knew it!

896
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,790
Right, I wanted to use this chance to be in love. And wrap up my virg—

897
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,870
virgin adolescence... and become an adult officially.

898
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,210
When can I actually end my virgin life?

899
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,570
I—

900
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,320
Yu Tang, I'll just suffer a bit.

901
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,270
If it's you, I can.

902
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:47,830
I can't!

903
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:49,600
There is nothing going on between us!

904
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,120
No... eh, there's a lot!

905
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:02,000
♫<i> The first person I think of is you </i>♫

906
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,370
♫<i> There is no reason </i>♫

907
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,580
♫<i> Lead me on! Let me be on my own ♫</i>

908
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:11,270
♫<i> Dreams are currently flowing free with the wind ♫</i>

909
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:15,080
♫<i> Say La La La La La La La ♫</i>

910
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,290
♫<i> There will be sadness! There will be happiness ♫</i>

911
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:20,230
♫<i> Good and bad will naturally divided ♫</i>

912
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,690
♫<i> All my partners are accompanying me ♫</i>

913
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,410
There is nothing going on between us.

914
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:27,040
No... eh, there's a lot!

915
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,620
Zhong Yu Tang!

916
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:39,600
What time is it now?

917
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,050
You can still fool around with your ex-boyfriend here... buying bentos?

918
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:44,970
You're very inactive.

919
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,520
You didn't forget the Di Shi Kang matter right?

920
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,400
You're just a Refresh Man who only knows how to escape from problems.

921
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,810
- What are you—<br> - Ai Sha.

922
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:02,940
Have the punishments for the departments who fail to get the desired results been announced yet?

923
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,690
Let's go.

924
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:18,750
This CEO seems to know you very well.

925
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:21,230
What is the relationship between you two?

926
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,160
It can't be the same holding-hands relationship as me right?

927
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,350
Hold hands, hold hands!

928
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,860
Hey, what are you looking at?

929
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:44,740
My son's appetite hasn't been too good these past 2 days.

930
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:48,520
So I want to look on the Internet for baby food that can help nourish him.

931
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,990
You're exaggerating!

932
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:55,010
I'm just taking a long break before the year-end sale.

933
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:56,850
I'll make a comeback soon.

934
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,420
It's you who should take care of yourself well.

935
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:00,700
Don't make me worry, okay?

936
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,270
Please, Chief.

937
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:10,740
Jia Yin, why don't you pass Di Shi Kang to Yu Tang?

938
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:13,860
<i>Next week, Di Shi Kang is going to remove all of Mei Mei's products from the shelves. </i>

939
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:16,090
<i>- Huh?<br> - This is the contract for removing the products off the shelves. </i>

940
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:18,040
<i> Please take it with you.</i>

941
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:27,060
<i>This is the first case I've tried to get on my own initiative since becoming a salesperson.</i>

942
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:32,310
<i>But it has unexpectedly caused Sales Team 3 to lose its biggest client.</i>

943
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:37,090
<i>How can I admit such a big mistake?</i>

944
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:53,610
Chief Meng He, I...

945
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:58,790
Thanks.

946
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:00,460
Is there anything else?

947
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:04,150
Everything's good. There isn't really anything.

948
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:13,340
<i>Sister Jia Yin has always been in charge of Di Shi Kang.</i>

949
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,820
<i>I'll just tell her first.</i>

950
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,360
- Sister Jia Yin, may I ask you a question? <br> - I'm sorry...

951
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:31,360
Every time I think about my son, all my maternal love comes bursting out at once.

952
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,100
I'm going to go squeeze some milk out.

953
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,690
But I wanted to discuss with you about Di Shi Kang... there's...!

954
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:41,370
My dear colleagues, there are thirty seconds remaining until we get off work and go back to our warm homes.

955
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:49,850
Time to get off work.

956
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:53,140
Get off work... pick up my son!

957
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,310
That... that...

958
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:02,000
Urgent announcement!

959
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:09,460
Di Shi Kang wants to terminate their contract with us and take Mei Mei off the shelves.

960
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:13,480
Why this all of a sudden? Jia Yin?

961
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:16,230
What do we do?

962
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:23,330
Wasn't it still fine before? Why would it be like this?

963
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,820
Yu Tang, wait a second.

964
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:28,530
I'm going to call the nanny to see if she can take care of my son for a bit longer.

965
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:32,690
What's going on?

966
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:36,730
Why is she not answering now?

967
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:38,320
Jia Yin, there shouldn't be any problems right?

968
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,120
If Di Shi Kang really removes Mei Mei off the shelves,

969
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,950
our whole sales performance will be cut to less than half!

970
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:44,720
Then the whole Sales Team 3 will be cut by our CEO!

971
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:50,050
That's great! I didn't think I would be able to return to the VIP station this soon.

972
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,530
Anyone want to catch a ride with me?

973
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:54,180
Yu Tang?

974
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:58,880
Then...I'll be leaving first.

975
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:06,030
Let's leave first then.

976
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,710
What?

977
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,930
Yu Tang, I still can't get in touch with the nanny.

978
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:22,710
I am really worried about my son.

979
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:25,880
Let's talk about Di Shi Kang's situation tomorrow. Okay?

980
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,510
Tomorrow? It will be too late by tomorrow.

981
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:33,090
-Yu Tang.<br>-What's the matter, Chief?

982
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:35,020
Remember to switch off the lights.

983
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,370
Chief!

984
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,080
Chief!

985
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,240
Chief!

986
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,480
Something so big happened

987
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,640
so aren't we supposed to have an urgent meeting to discuss countermeasures?

988
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:07,480
Young lady... because such a big thing happened, it therefore has nothing to do with us.

989
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,940
If the sky falls down, there is someone who will have to hold it up.

990
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,090
I'm telling you...

991
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:15,190
for those of us who get paid a low wage, it's considered passing if you just complete your duties.

992
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:18,030
Don't stick your nose into other things, okay? That's it.

993
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:19,500
Bye.

994
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,050
But...!

995
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:22,330
Hey!

996
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:23,660
- Sister Jia YIn! Sister Jia Yin! <br> - Oh... Yu Tang,

997
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,760
I've called my nanny more than thirty times and still can't get in contact with her.

998
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,130
I'm really worried right now.

999
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:29,550
Let's talk about the Di Shi Kang's situation tomorrow. Okay?

1000
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:31,100
Why don't you teach me then?

1001
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,340
Just give me ten minutes.

1002
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,820
Teach me how to do it. I'll deal with it. No problem.

1003
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:37,150
I'm really worried about my son now.

1004
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:40,360
I promise you that as soon as I reach the company tomorrow, I'll discuss it with you.

1005
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,350
Sorry.

1006
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:43,330
Huang Jia Yin!

1007
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:47,250
You have always been in charge of Di Shi Kang's business.

1008
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:52,070
After you had your child, it seems that you haven't even stepped through Di Shi Kang's doors.

1009
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:55,310
The CEO said before that if the sales performance drops, the whole team will be cut.

1010
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:58,340
Others may be able to go find free time, do nothing, and wait for the worst to come,

1011
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,430
but what about you?

1012
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,260
Do you have this choice?

1013
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:04,360
Or do you want to go set up a stall at the night market while carrying your child?

1014
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:09,020
Hello?

1015
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,730
My son is in the emergency room?

1016
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:13,910
Which hospital is he at?

1017
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:17,330
Okay, I'm going over now.

1018
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:21,360
The nanny just called and said that my son is having a high fever.

1019
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,750
He was brought to the emergency room.

1020
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:27,370
I'm sorry, I really need to go now. I'm sorry.

1021
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:29,360
I will go with you.

1022
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,920
Let's go.
