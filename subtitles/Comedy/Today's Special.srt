1
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,577
(hindi music playing)

2
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,205
(music stops)

3
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,654
Lobster fennel.

4
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:06,825
Okay, chard, arugula,
mesclun, radicchio.

5
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,861
Okay? No beet greens,
no beet greens.

6
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:12,364
Tell eduardo that dairy
delivery gets here at 10:00,
not 10:15, not 10:30.

7
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:15,167
Okay, go, go. Freddie,
what the hell is this?

8
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,735
Salmon.
Salmon.
I know it's salmon,

9
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,537
But why does it have
scales and a mouth?

10
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,573
If we serve it like that,
it'll scare the customers,
right?

11
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,208
I just thought...
Yeah, don't think.

12
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,677
Fillet, fillet like
the wind, freddie.

13
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,324
Two beef,
one salmon, one rib.

14
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,526
Two beef, one rib.

15
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:44,563
Chicken's up, lobster's up,
how long on that snapper,
freddie?

16
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,265
Freddie: Thirty seconds.
Ladies.

17
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,669
Samir, what's
the word, stud?

18
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,904
Steady as she goes, chef.

19
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:54,940
That's my boy.
That's my boy
right here.

20
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,782
Who do we
have this week?
Oh, henna.

21
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,284
Okay, you know what?
Give me that.

22
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:08,420
Horny henna?
Heterosexual henna?
Just give me it.

23
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,655
Honey-dipped henna?

24
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,490
Just give me that.

25
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:15,260
You know,
I'm gonna give your mom
my e-mail address,

26
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,963
She's obviously
wasting her
time on you.

27
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:22,301
You know what?
You are a sick man,
and I have to go.

28
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,269
Hey.

29
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,973
Please try.

30
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,274
Okay.

31
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,579
Henna: So,
you're a cook?

32
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,448
Yeah, I'm a
sous-chef right now.

33
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,218
The sous-chef
is the, you know,

34
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,223
And oversees all the cooking,
takes care of administration,
inventory,

35
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,892
And basically
solves any problems
that come up.

36
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:50,295
And the chef is
the one who gets
all the credit, so...

37
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,701
It's not easy to
get to be the chef,

38
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:01,473
But my boss
is part-owner
of a restaurant

39
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:07,412
And that looks like
that job is pretty much
mine for the asking, so...

40
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,414
So...

41
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,520
If we get married,
I want to have
a lot of children,

42
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,923
And my mother
would live with us.

43
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,296
Samir: All right,
okay, chard, arugula,
mesclun, radicchio.

44
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,364
Go, go, go, go.

45
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,332
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop, whoa.

46
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,600
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

47
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,738
Right, it's called
cilantro oil,
not cilantro water.

48
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,375
Right. The thing is,
your cilantro oil was
coming out flavorless,

49
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,677
So, I'm finishing
it with water
instead of oil.

50
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,745
You changed it?

51
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:43,282
Okay, you just
transferred here
from red grill?

52
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,616
Yeah.
Okay, carrie,

53
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,385
If this is not
the best cilantro oil

54
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,987
That I've ever tasted
in my entire life,

55
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,790
You'll be back
at red grill
by dinnertime.

56
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,834
Get your hair
out of your face.

57
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,970
This is a kitchen,
not a rock concert.

58
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,008
How's everyone doing?
All right?
Rosie, what's good?

59
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,444
Thank you. Louis?

60
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,479
Watch that seasoning,
son, all right?

61
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,681
Louis: Got it, chef.

62
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,349
You can talk to him now.

63
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:19,851
Do it now,
don't be a pussy.

64
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:20,952
Shut the fuck up.

65
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,660
Chef, chef,
I wanted to...

66
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,329
(all exclaiming)

67
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,032
It's not my fault.

68
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,634
Is that table 11?

69
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:36,935
That better
not be 11.

70
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,537
I've got vips on 11.
I got it.

71
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,806
Come on, let's go.
Chop, chop.

72
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,709
Samir: I'm gonna need this.

73
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,647
Coming through, corner.

74
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,084
Okay, thank you, freddie.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

75
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,352
Yo, this is for table 23.

76
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,553
Yeah, don't worry, freddie.

77
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,088
Hey, wait,
that's 16's salmons.

78
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,823
Don't worry.
Hang in there.
Samir.

79
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,792
Pea puree.
Carrie: Pea puree.

80
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,597
Potato puree.
Potato puree.

81
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,934
Saffron.
Saffron.

82
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,371
Turnip.

83
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,538
Turnip.

84
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,741
Cabbage.

85
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,478
Cabbage.

86
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,023
Team work.

87
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,467
(indistinct chattering)

88
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,939
(inaudible)

89
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,685
(hindi music playing)

90
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,755
44th and 10th.

91
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,004
Are you indian?

92
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,473
Yeah.

93
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,175
(speaking hindi)

94
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,043
No.

95
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,447
No.

96
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,815
(exclaims)

97
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,450
(truck horn blows)

98
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,485
Whoa, hey, hey, watch it.
Watch it.

99
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,787
So, what's your name?

100
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,189
Samir.

101
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:38,523
What do you do?

102
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,493
I'm a chef.

103
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:42,794
You...

104
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,629
Oh, really?

105
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,199
Hey, that's wonderful!

106
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:51,470
You know, I used to cook
for the oberoi sheraton.

107
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,706
The finest hotel
kitchen in all of mumbai.
Whoa.

108
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,210
I met indira gandhi
when she came there
for a banquet.

109
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:01,012
I created
a special pulao
in her honor,

110
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,881
And she was so taken
by it, that she came

111
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,517
Back to the kitchen
to thank me personally.

112
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,220
Hey, hey, hey, whoa,
watch it. Watch it.

113
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,255
So, do you cook
indian food?

114
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:16,628
I make a murghi masala
that will haunt you
like a lost love.

115
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,698
Okay, could we
just not talk, please?

116
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,834
Oh, yeah.
Sure, sure, boss. Sure.

117
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,670
(tires screech)

118
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,212
(taxi reversing)

119
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,185
Hey, mr. Samir.
Better keep my card.

120
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,819
Samir: Ken fucking curzon?

121
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,289
Just calm down,
buddy, all right?

122
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,657
Dude, this is my job.

123
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,725
This is my job,
you know it is.

124
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,627
And you give it to
fucking 25-year-old

125
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,130
Fucking ken fucking curzon?
Come on!

126
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,731
I know you're upset.
I'm upset.

127
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,667
Yes, I am upset.

128
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,202
I have six years in the line,
I have two as your sous-chef.

129
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:35,106
I know, pal,
and you're the best damn
sous-chef I've got, okay?

130
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,676
Oh, great. But what?

131
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,177
Huh?

132
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,716
Look, samir.

133
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,918
Samir, you...

134
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,754
You are an incredible cook.

135
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,723
All right?

136
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,892
But to be the chef,
that's, I mean,

137
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,928
You got to be more
than just a good cook,
man. You know?

138
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,664
No, no. You've got to
be a creative force.

139
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,701
You've got to be
the man with the magic.

140
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,669
The bing, the bang,
the boom, the pop.

141
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,240
And ken curzon,
he may be 25 years old,
but he's got that magic.

142
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:13,078
When he slices salmon,
it's fucking pornographic.

143
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,314
I get a boner
watching this guy cook.

144
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,249
That's a chef.

145
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,855
Frankly, samir, I know
you've been doing this
for a few years,

146
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,758
But your cooking's cold.

147
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:35,300
I'm sorry,
buddy, but you know what,
it's paint by numbers.

148
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:39,104
It's by the book.
And as a businessman,
I have to ask myself,

149
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,039
"where's the magic?

150
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,642
"where's the emotion?

151
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,944
"where's my boner?" hmm?

152
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,351
Hey, hey. Samir!
Where're you going, buddy?

153
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,405
I heard you quit,
I'm sorry about that.

154
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:14,839
It's all for the best,
you know.

155
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,875
What are you
going to do?

156
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,417
I'm going to paris.

157
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,820
You got a job in paris?

158
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:33,158
Yeah, I'm going to stage
with jacques renaud.

159
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,859
Really?

160
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,928
At la cantatrice?

161
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,096
Yeah.

162
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,898
Wow, that's amazing.

163
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,734
Well, it's just
a stage, you know.

164
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:45,737
Call me crazy,
but most people would
seem happy about it.

165
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,806
I am happy.

166
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,409
Good luck.

167
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,249
Wait.

168
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:07,792
Here.

169
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,028
Wow.

170
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,431
This is good
stuff. Thanks.

171
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,067
If you're
gonna be working
in this madhouse,

172
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,302
You're gonna need
it more than me.

173
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,813
(woman speaking
instructional french)

174
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,316
(translating)
I need directions
to the discotheque.

175
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,251
Stanton: You know,
you don't have to
actually go to paris,

176
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:37,188
No, no. No, no, no, no.
No, you don't understand.

177
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,859
This was me telling myself
what I already knew,

178
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,360
But I didn't know yet.

179
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,028
Right.

180
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,902
Samir: Look,
I go to paris,

181
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,437
I stage with
the great ones.

182
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,774
Renaud, verge,
robuchon, troisgros.
Whoever will take me in.

183
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,176
But you know what?
When I get back,

184
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,944
Doors are gonna
fly open for me

185
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,946
That I didn't
even know existed.

186
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,865
Stanton: Have you told
your folks yet?

187
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,268
I've been waiting.

188
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,402
For what?

189
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,839
The last minute.

190
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,146
Shoes.

191
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,102
Samir. Oh!

192
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,874
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

193
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,042
Aw!
(chuckles)

194
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,010
(chanting indistinctly)

195
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,324
Hi, mom.

196
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,425
So...

197
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,559
So?

198
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,528
What happened with
that girl, henna?

199
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,629
How did it go, beta?

200
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:25,930
Mmm...

201
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,932
Oh, samir.

202
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,601
Why am I
breaking my head?

203
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,536
I don't know, ma.

204
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,905
Beta, how will
I answer god,

205
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,641
If you're still
without a family
when I'm gone?

206
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:37,976
Mom, listen.

207
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,344
Okay, all right.
I need to talk...

208
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,045
Never mind. Chalo.

209
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,348
There's more than
just fish in the sea.
Come on.

210
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,151
What about her?

211
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,656
Ma, I don't think
that would work.

212
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:54,225
Why not?
What's wrong with her?

213
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,464
I just don't
like architects.

214
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:03,001
Oh, beta.
You're too old
to be this picky.

215
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,005
Ma. I have some news.

216
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,640
Where is shereen
from connecticut?

217
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,341
I know
I bookmarked her.

218
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:13,678
Okay, ma, listen.
Um, I need to talk
to you, okay?

219
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,648
She used to be a waitress,
working in a restaurant,
just like you.

220
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,650
I'm not a...
I'm not a waitress
working in...

221
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,585
Okay, look.

222
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,654
I just e-mailed
this to you.

223
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:26,024
Now, you make sure
that you call her
when you get home.

224
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,325
Where's dad?
Is he at the restaurant?

225
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,593
Yes, yes.

226
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,528
Rasool is delivering
the meat this morning,

227
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,530
So, of course,
your father has to go

228
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:35,033
Down there to be
cheated in person.

229
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,236
Beta.

230
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,939
You'll end up
with a widow.

231
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,006
(door closes)

232
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,728
(hindi music playing)

233
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,467
Samir.

234
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,136
Oh, hello, uncles.

235
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,640
A table for one, sir?

236
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,375
Oh, no, I'm fine.

237
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:20,044
Hey, man, I was just
thinking about him

238
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,013
And here come
the manhattan son.

239
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,548
Patel: Hey, did you read?

240
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,550
We beat the bloody brits
in the second test.

241
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,452
Oh, you know, I don't
follow cricket, uncle.

242
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:32,190
You see? This is
the bloody problem
with our children.

243
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,592
No culture.
Cricket is culture.

244
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:35,660
Yeah.

245
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,562
Cricket is the
gentleman game.

246
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:38,997
Exactly.

247
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,198
You have to
wear a sweater.

248
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,134
I'm gonna go
find my dad.

249
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,775
Oh!

250
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,244
Ow!

251
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,281
You really shouldn't
put that there.

252
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,593
Rasool: Khuda hafiz,
hakim-bhai.

253
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,528
Hakim: Ah, thank you,
rasool-bhai.

254
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,363
(speaking hindi)

255
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,072
(both chuckle)

256
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,775
Khuda hafiz.

257
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,744
Bloody bastard crook.

258
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,647
Look at this bullshit.

259
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,417
(engine starting)

260
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,719
Dad.

261
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,187
Hakim: Samir?

262
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,257
Everything okay?
Yeah.

263
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,526
Oh, yeah.
Everything is great.

264
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,063
Okay.

265
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,833
I just wanted to
let you know that

266
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:52,270
Even though the reason
that I actually came...

267
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,338
New clothes? Hmm?

268
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,107
No.

269
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:59,610
(speaking hindi)

270
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,145
Maaf karna,
I'm sorry, boss.
(cell phone ringing)

271
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,780
"maaf karna,
sorry, boss."

272
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,583
Huh!

273
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,086
(coughs) hello?

274
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,524
(shouting)

275
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,427
I told you I sent it
on Thursday.

276
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,197
What you mean
it bounced?

277
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,600
Wait, wait, wait.

278
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,203
Uh, just calm down,
calm down.

279
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,673
Hello? I'll call you back.

280
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,176
I have a bad connection.
I can't hear you.

281
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,779
I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.

282
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,154
Um...
(coughs)

283
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:47,125
So, dad, I wanted
to tell you that
I'm probably...

284
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,494
Hey! Hey.

285
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,729
Hello.

286
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,532
(laughs) hello.

287
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,401
Please,
please come in.

288
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,204
We are going to
be open for lunch
in just five minutes.

289
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,807
Oh, we were just
looking at the menu,
thank you.

290
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,143
You can eat in,
take away,

291
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,444
Whatever your pleasure.

292
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,815
Free papadam.

293
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,189
(sighs)

294
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,397
Listen, dad, I...

295
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,501
I need to tell you
something, okay?

296
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:32,703
So tell.

297
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,840
I'm going to paris.

298
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,808
Why?

299
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,943
Well, I quit my job.

300
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,319
Why?

301
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,756
Well, I'm doing a stage

302
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,325
With this very,
very important chef.

303
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:55,393
Stage.

304
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,228
What is stage?

305
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,799
(stammering)
well, it's like a job.

306
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,234
Like a job.

307
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,604
I see.
What does it pay?

308
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,574
This "like a job"?

309
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,275
It doesn't pay
anything, okay?

310
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,677
It's like an
apprenticeship.

311
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,612
I see.

312
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:17,949
So you are quitting
your job where you
are making money

313
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:22,286
To go to France to
do the same job, mmm?

314
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,854
For free?

315
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,693
You are a bloody
brilliant businessman.

316
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,962
I didn't come here
to argue with you, okay?

317
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:33,998
That this could be
a tremendous opportunity.

318
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,867
For what?
Going backwards?

319
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,436
What's wrong with you?

320
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:41,305
Do you know that
you're a bloody old man?

321
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,674
Keep it down.
If your brother
were alive today...

322
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:48,312
He would've been a doctor
and you would've
been respected,

323
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:51,282
And he would've had a wife,
and a family and kids,

324
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,517
I understand and
I'm doing nothing...

325
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,986
Badtameez!

326
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,288
You are making mockery
of your brother's memory.

327
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,357
I'm not making
a mockery, okay?
I'm just...

328
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,294
Your poor mother
still thinks a woman
will make you change.

329
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:06,597
But you are not interested
in bloody anything.

330
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,568
Money, business,
a career, wife,
family. Nothing?

331
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,737
You just want
to be a loser.

332
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,507
So, go, go, go.

333
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:19,710
Go to France,
go to England,
go to china.

334
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,746
Marry a bloody
chinese clown-girl,

335
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:25,516
And invite your mother
to come and cry at
the bloody wedding!

336
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,318
Dad, relax, all right?
Would you just...

337
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,887
(coughing)
I just came
to tell you...

338
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,593
You okay?

339
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,330
(wheezing)

340
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,601
Dad. Dad!

341
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,636
Samir. Samir.

342
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,506
Dad? Dad, come down,
come down. Oh, my god.

343
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,309
Here, sit down, sit down,
sit down, sit down, okay.

344
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,944
You okay? You okay?
Dad, sit down, sit down.

345
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,913
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

346
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,015
Dad!

347
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,518
Call 911!
Call 911!

348
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,021
Dad. Dad! Dad. Help.

349
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,556
That boy's
killed his father.

350
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,092
Dad. You're gonna
be fine, okay?
Don't worry.

351
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,471
Don't worry, ma.

352
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,481
I'll take care
of the restaurant.

353
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,172
(laughing)

354
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:30,541
(hindi music playing)

355
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:33,177
Yeah, hi,
jfk to paris.

356
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,416
Um, next week.
Yeah, the 13th.

357
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,718
Okay.

358
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,153
I'll hold, yes.

359
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:44,989
So this guy,
he rips the teabag,

360
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:46,690
And pours it
into the water.

361
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,659
I don't like teabags.

362
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,494
Will you shut up?

363
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:53,664
So I tell him,
"arre-bhai, that's
not the way you do it.

364
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:57,535
"you take the teabag
and you dip it into
the water like this."

365
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,503
Okay, so now he's
very thankful.

366
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:03,741
So I go to the toilet,
and when I come back,
guess what?

367
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,211
He's putting
the sugar packets
into the water.

368
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,748
Thank you, bhai,
you ruined my joke!

369
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,451
Huh, it is old joke.

370
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,019
Not as old as you.

371
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:16,620
Loose tea is better.

372
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,088
Never mind
the tea business.

373
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,190
He's giving you
the joke, listen.

374
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,524
But loose tea is better.

375
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:23,561
(hindi music playing)
but loose tea is better.

376
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,463
He's giving you the
joke and you say,
"tea, tea, tea."

377
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:26,964
Loose tea is better.

378
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,500
Loose tea is better, yes.

379
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:38,209
That bloody restaurant
will be the death of you.

380
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:39,777
Hakim: I know.

381
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,812
I don't want.

382
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,583
And now, this bloody
heart-attack-whart-attack
business.

383
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,184
No good.

384
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,954
Honestly, no good.

385
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,857
Hakim, you've got
to get smart.

386
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:56,727
I'm telling you,
franchising is
the wave of the future.

387
00:24:56,729 --> 00:25:00,865
And of course, I'll make
you full partner-whartner,
that is not the issue.

388
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,666
Let me think it over.

389
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,801
Mmm.

390
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:08,205
Did I show you?
My nimith is on msnbc.

391
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,108
Really?

392
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:17,281
Talking about municipal bonds
and such matters, you see?

393
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:18,883
Very good.

394
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,218
...The government has
put into the economy.

395
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,621
That they essentially
primed the pump.
So, with the s&p right now...

396
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,757
My ali used
to listen to me.

397
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,796
But samir...

398
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,700
I don't know.

399
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,837
He has always defied me.

400
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,607
Never wanted to listen.

401
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,679
And now it's too late.

402
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,180
Hakim-bhai.

403
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,250
It's never too late
to be a father.

404
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,854
Sure, easy
for you to say.

405
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,814
(sighs)

406
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,847
Foot massage?

407
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,720
(moaning)
that feels so good.

408
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:37,921
(chuckles)

409
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:43,794
Do you remember
when you and ali
massaged my feet?

410
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:48,132
And as a joke,
you rubbed blue ink
all over them.

411
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:50,668
(both chuckling)

412
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,369
For two weeks,
I had blue feet.

413
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:57,941
And then mrs. Sanchez,
right, she thought that
it was a religious thing

414
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:01,779
Because she'd seen
a picture of a hindu
god that was blue.

415
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,220
Listen, ma,
I looked at the books.

416
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,122
It's pretty bad.

417
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,792
He's not even making
any money anymore.

418
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,427
You should just
sell the place
to amit-uncle,

419
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,162
He'll give you
a good price for it.

420
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,798
He'll turn it
into some franchise.

421
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,399
Kfc.
So what?

422
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,435
So what?

423
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,807
When you look
at the restaurant,

424
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,410
All you see
is peeling paint,
broken chairs...

425
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:37,848
You know your dad
never wanted to
run a restaurant.

426
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,251
He dreamed of
being a doctor.

427
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:44,822
I know, I know, I know,
and dada couldn't

428
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:46,457
Afford to send him
to medical school,

429
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:49,226
So he came to
this country instead.
I know this story, ma.

430
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,494
Do you?

431
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:54,131
Do you know
that when he came
to this country,

432
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,300
He became
a third-class citizen?

433
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,869
America wasn't
like it is today.

434
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:01,772
People had never
seen an indian before.

435
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,842
He worked as a janitor.

436
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,213
He worked as a dishwasher
in a white man's restaurant.

437
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,782
He was so determined.

438
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,018
And slowly, slowly,

439
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,489
He saved up enough money
to start his own business.

440
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,291
He worked
18 hours a day,

441
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,794
Just so that he
wouldn't have to
tell his children

442
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:26,530
That he couldn't
afford to send them
to college.

443
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,934
And now,
one son is gone.

444
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:37,808
And the other son
only sees his failure.

445
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:46,083
Doctor: He's a fighter,
but remember,
his heart is still weak.

446
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:49,319
He should stay home
the next couple of weeks,
you know, take it easy.

447
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,855
Make sure you
monitor his blood
pressure regularly,

448
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:54,024
And above all,
no stress.

449
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,261
You hear that, hakim?
No stress.

450
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,030
I'm not deaf, woman.

451
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,866
(sniffs)

452
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:07,471
(woman translating)
please, madam, my cat
is stuck in your tree.

453
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:08,839
Excuse me, waiter?

454
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:10,207
Repeat after m.
Waiter!

455
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,441
Hello.

456
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,277
Yes, yes.

457
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,449
This is what you
serve to your customers?

458
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,819
This greasy slop?

459
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:22,886
Oh.

460
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:26,924
You should be
ashamed of yourselves.
Excuse me.

461
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,992
Stop eating, come on.

462
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,396
I've had high
blood-pressure.

463
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:33,831
I didn't want to
come to this place.

464
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,132
I can't believe
you brought me here.

465
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:44,374
Samir: Hey, hey,
listen to me.

466
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,310
This is too greasy.

467
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:49,213
Okay? Look at this grease.
Look at that, okay?

468
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:52,416
It's too much.
The customers
are complaining.

469
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:54,985
Okay? Too much ghee.

470
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:58,589
Ghee. Ghee, there's
too much ghee. Too much.

471
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,025
I'm talking
to you here.

472
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:07,064
And this. This is
a health violation,
all right?

473
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,167
This has to go
in the trash.

474
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,402
Okay? It's disgusting.

475
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,130
Oh!

476
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,035
Fuck!

477
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,570
Fuck! Look at this.

478
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:47,671
Fuck?

479
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:49,373
Look at my shirt?
Fuck?

480
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,308
You fuck to me?

481
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,176
What?
I fuck to you.

482
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,646
What?
You fuck to me,
I fuck to you!

483
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,414
I fuck to you!

484
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,416
What? Where
are you going?
I finish.

485
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,984
I finish.
Where are you going?

486
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,320
What's he...
What are you doing?

487
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:04,454
Hey.

488
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,992
Hey, hey!
Come back. What the...

489
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:10,627
(indistinct arguing)

490
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,664
Don't speak to me!

491
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:15,032
Hey, hey,
you can't quit.

492
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:16,233
Health violation...

493
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:17,434
This is your job!

494
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,002
Big shit,
I am leaving.

495
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,971
What? Okay, come back.
That's over. Over!

496
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,472
Uh-uh, come finish.

497
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,144
Hey!

498
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,051
Great!

499
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,991
Just be a few
more minutes.

500
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,630
Tikka masala,
tikka masala.

501
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:52,469
Okay. Onions, garlic...
Okay, onions.

502
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,971
Um...

503
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,672
Onions... Ah!

504
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,108
Onions.

505
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,177
Okay, lamb, lamb, lamb.

506
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,083
Is this lamb or beef?

507
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,385
Yes?

508
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,421
No, what kind
of meat is this?

509
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,724
Yes?

510
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,459
Thanks for your help.

511
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:17,127
(sniffing)

512
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:18,462
(exhales)

513
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,098
Let's call it lamb,
shall we?

514
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,199
Yes?

515
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,567
Thought so.

516
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:28,171
Okay. Garam masala.
Garam masala.

517
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,140
No.

518
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:36,747
Garam masala?
Garam masala?
Yeah. Okay.

519
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,584
(containers clattering)

520
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,371
Thank you, pierre.

521
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:08,111
Two    saag paneer,
one    palak paneer,
one chicken vindaloo.

522
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:11,481
Yeah, seven naan.
Seven, okay?

523
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:17,721
Yeah, it's tandoori palace,
7414 37th avenue. Yeah.

524
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,093
I know it's an
indian restaurant.

525
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,197
Just come to
the back. Yeah.

526
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:31,101
Okay, credit card is...

527
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:33,136
Oh! Oh, shit!

528
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,149
Have you any idea
how many taxi drivers

529
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,118
There are in new york
named akbar?

530
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,853
Okay, well,

531
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,421
He said he was
an amazing cook

532
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,390
And he used to cook
for indira gandhi.

533
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:56,159
No, man,
good luck to you.

534
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,628
Well, I guess
I'll just have
to go and beg

535
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,363
Munnamia to come
back and cook for us.

536
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:01,431
No wait!
No, no, no, no.

537
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,632
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

538
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:05,869
Whoever he is,
we'll find him.
Whoever he is.

539
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,206
(all speaking hindi)

540
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,576
(speaking hindi)

541
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,158
Wow!
Hey!

542
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,127
Um, thank you
very much.

543
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:36,266
Look, this would not be
a permanent position
or anything like that.

544
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,601
Oh! That's perfectly
all right.

545
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:40,303
I've never had
a permanent
position in my life.

546
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,404
Oh.

547
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,407
Oh, that's quite
an accomplishment.

548
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,778
Okay, so it's a standard
menu, pretty much.

549
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,882
Whoa, what is it?
What are you doing?

550
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:54,484
Hmm! Masala.

551
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,256
(hindi music playing)

552
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:04,628
Masala is the soul
of indian food.

553
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:12,169
And food is
the soul of india.

554
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,552
Smell it.

555
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:37,327
Of course you
can't really tell
until it's in the oil.

556
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,330
The masala
is the symphony,

557
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:41,665
And the oil
is the orchestra.

558
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:44,534
The greatest
chef in the world
taught me that.

559
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,203
Really, who?

560
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:47,604
My mother.

561
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,272
(chuckles)

562
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:51,274
(speaking hindi)

563
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,378
Come on,
come on! Move!

564
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,314
(akbar speaking urdu)

565
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,421
A man should have
three passions in his life.

566
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:08,792
His country,
his religion
and his cricket.

567
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:10,293
What about his wife?

568
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:15,365
Wife is not a passion.
Wife is an expense.

569
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,267
(chuckling)

570
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,235
Oh, man.

571
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,003
Oh, there.

572
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,805
It was wonderful!

573
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,607
We're going to
tell everyone we know.

574
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,376
And she knows everyone.

575
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,944
Good night.
Thank you again.
Lovely!

576
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,981
Wonderful meal!
Good luck to you.
It's been a pleasure.

577
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:32,282
We'll see you again.

578
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:33,550
Okay, bye-bye.
Thank you.

579
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:35,852
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

580
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,456
Woman: Oh! Lester,
what's gotten into you?

581
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,327
Delivery man
not back yet.

582
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,563
Oh.
And we have backup.

583
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,401
Uh, backup? Well,
who goes usually?

584
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,372
It's never
happened before.

585
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,899
Oh, man!

586
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,400
Oh, no!

587
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:58,868
You okay...

588
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,372
Oh, samir?

589
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,641
Hey, hi.

590
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:06,409
Hi. Yeah.

591
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:07,377
(laughs)

592
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:08,845
Are you okay?

593
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,747
Yeah, I'm fine.

594
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:13,783
Well, what...
What are you
doing here?

595
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:17,420
Oh, we live here.
We live over
on 78th street.

596
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,489
And this is my
daughter, abigail.

597
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:21,491
Oh. Hi, abigail.

598
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:24,994
Well, what are
you doing here?

599
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:28,465
I mean, shouldn't you
be off in paris making
terrines or something?

600
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,401
Yeah, no,
I'm doing that.

601
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:34,938
Yeah, I just got
a little bit delayed.

602
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,374
Just had
a family emergency.

603
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:38,808
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

604
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,411
No, it's totally fine.
It's all good.

605
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,114
(both exclaiming)

606
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:45,548
Oh, god!

607
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,885
Okay. Well, maybe
"fine" is not the word.

608
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,387
(laughs)

609
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:53,390
Mmm, this is
really good.

610
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,592
Really?

611
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,895
Yeah, it's...
Where's this from?

612
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:03,466
Um, well, it's...
My family owns
a restaurant

613
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:05,635
On 74th street.
Tandoori palace.

614
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,405
That's why I'm helping
out making deliveries.

615
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:10,507
I know that place,
I used to go there
all the time

616
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:12,442
When I first moved
here from buffalo.

617
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:14,644
But I don't remember
it being this good.

618
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:18,181
Back then, all
I could afford was
the free papadam.

619
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:19,582
(chuckles)

620
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,952
Um, we're going
this way.

621
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,554
Oh, okay.
But...

622
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,425
Pumpkin,
look at your face.
It's all over you.

623
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,995
Do you mind?
I need to get
a wet nap for her.

624
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:33,129
Uh...
Please?

625
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:35,432
Okay, okay. All right.
Thanks.

626
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,434
Hi. Hi, pumpkin.

627
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,968
Thank you.
Hi.

628
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,471
All right.
Oh, gosh!

629
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:42,906
Uh, you know what?
I actually have a napkin.

630
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:46,075
I think
I can probably
take care of it.

631
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,679
There you go, there.

632
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:55,652
She has very good taste.
It's one of our most
favorite dishes.

633
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,222
Okay, I think she's clean.

634
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,926
Well, thank you.
Say, "thank you."

635
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:04,627
Thanks.
And, uh...

636
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,730
Okay, I'll see you.

637
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:10,233
See you.
See you around. Yeah.

638
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:12,101
Good to see you.

639
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:13,937
Hey.

640
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:18,975
Get together sometime
and get a bite to eat.

641
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,944
Yeah, sure.

642
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,513
But only because
we're neighbors.

643
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:24,481
Right.

644
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,616
And I'm off
on wednesdays.

645
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:29,085
Yeah, I know.
I made the schedule.

646
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:35,992
Thank you.
Everything was delicious.

647
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,560
Thank you.

648
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:40,129
I've never tasted
curries like that.

649
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,702
Well, that's that.

650
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:47,570
Shall we settle up?

651
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:52,942
Yes. So, I was hoping
that maybe you'd
come back tomorrow

652
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:54,544
Or finish out the week
if you're free.

653
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:59,883
Well, yeah,
of course I'm free,
but as for coming back,

654
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,151
I'll think it over. Hmm?

655
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:04,621
Well, when will you
know for sure?

656
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:05,955
Um...

657
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,025
Tell you what,
may I borrow your pen?

658
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,093
Hold that for a second.

659
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:13,696
I'll give you
my address,

660
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:19,769
You come over
to my house
tomorrow morning,

661
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,673
And we'll discuss
issues large and small.

662
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,747
(alarms blaring)

663
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,124
Hakim: Wake up! Samir!

664
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:42,659
(metallic banging)

665
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:43,760
Wake up!

666
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:45,962
Ow!

667
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,632
Wake up, samir!

668
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,668
Wake...

669
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,036
Okay, all right, okay.

670
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:54,771
What's happening? What?

671
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,576
Go, wash yourself.
It's time for
morning prayers.

672
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,778
When did you
become religious?

673
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,781
Hakim! Hakim,
are you all right?

674
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:06,950
Please, woman,
you stay out of this.

675
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:10,119
I'm teaching our son
how to say his
morning prayers.

676
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,823
When did you
become religious?

677
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,926
Just follow my
movements, huh?

678
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,262
Okay.
I'm going
to pray aloud.

679
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,706
No, no, no.
Don't be crazy.
Come on.

680
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,374
Shh!
This is...

681
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:33,042
Stop talking.

682
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:34,644
(clears throat)

683
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,079
Okay, just be
careful, all right?

684
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:37,747
Follow my hands.

685
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,251
Allah...
(all exclaiming)

686
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:44,687
You see! You see?
This is what happens.

687
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:45,955
Okay? You can't do this.
Come on, hakim.

688
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,290
Would you just,
please, sit down.
Don't do this.

689
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:48,725
Sit down!
Jesus!

690
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:50,693
Never mind
bloody jesus.

691
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,163
Jesus is not going
to teach you namaz.

692
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,937
Nobody is going
to teach you namaz!
Only me, your father.

693
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,407
Please, please,
woman, please.

694
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:09,679
You have never
wanted to learn
anything from me.

695
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,715
Never wanted to
listen to me about
anything in life.

696
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:14,017
Okay, okay.
Please stop.

697
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,419
And now, now...

698
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:19,422
Okay, you know what?
I'm done. Okay?
I'm out of here.

699
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:21,424
All right,
I have to go.

700
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:24,227
Beta, it's 6:00
in the morning.

701
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:26,062
I'm meeting someone
for breakfast.

702
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,831
Meeting?
Whom are you meeting?

703
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,967
Samir: Nobody you know.

704
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,872
See what you did?
Now he has a meeting.

705
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,345
Please, please, woman.

706
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,151
I'm sorry
I'm a little early.

707
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:50,720
You're right on time,
my friend. Come on in.

708
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:03,266
That was a present
from the granddaughter
of a maharaja.

709
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:06,069
Oh! Wow,
it's beautiful.

710
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:09,872
You didn't need
to go to all this
trouble, really.

711
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,741
No trouble at all.

712
00:45:11,743 --> 00:45:16,879
Sharing breakfast with
someone is very good
for the digestive system.

713
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,781
Wow!

714
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,450
Mmm-hmm.

715
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:21,884
Oh, my god!

716
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:24,353
Is that you with
the queen of England?

717
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,422
(laughing)
yeah, yeah.

718
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,992
You know, I was in charge
of an orphanage in delhi
way back in the '60s.

719
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:32,061
She came over
for a visit.

720
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,732
What a wonderful,
wonderful woman.

721
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,434
Such a pity
about her kids.

722
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:42,271
Wait, I thought you
said that you were
a cook in mumbai.

723
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:46,109
That was after
I came back
from pakistan.

724
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:51,180
I was in partnership
with three pakistani
guys in karachi.

725
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:54,784
We were all going to
be bloody millionaires.

726
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:57,854
Hmm, I thought my
future was worked out.

727
00:45:57,856 --> 00:46:01,290
I even proposed
to the daughter of
a wealthy nutmeg merchant.

728
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:03,926
Oh, you can't believe
how good she smelt.

729
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,828
(chuckles) really?
Hmm.

730
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:08,798
And then her father
married her off

731
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,434
To a carpet tycoon
from kashmir.

732
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,536
Never heard
from her again.

733
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:14,871
Hmm.

734
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:16,873
You ever think about her?
Hmm.

735
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,875
Every time
I drink eggnog.

736
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:20,009
(laughs)

737
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,378
How is the dosa?

738
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,280
It's good.
Mmm.

739
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,883
It's...
It's really good.

740
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,319
How do you...
How do you
get this texture?

741
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,221
Ah, you noticed?

742
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:33,489
Mmm-hmm.

743
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:35,258
It's the stone.

744
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:40,363
A griddle has
a will of its own.
But with a dosa stone,

745
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:45,201
You can determine
the character of the dosa
according to your mood.

746
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:49,839
Hmm. Seems like
you're in a pretty
good mood today.

747
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,142
Wish I could say
the same about you.

748
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,243
Well,

749
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:58,247
I had some plans
that changed.

750
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:02,385
Ah! I had
a million and one
plans that changed.

751
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:07,456
(chuckles) even the ones
that worked out didn't work
out the way I had planned.

752
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,294
Listen, um...

753
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,463
About the restaurant,
I was...

754
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,432
Hmm. Come on, let's go.

755
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:26,008
Cumin. Cumin.
It's a saucy wench.

756
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,879
Give you great pleasure,
but she herself
is never satisfied,

757
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:30,613
So be careful.

758
00:47:30,615 --> 00:47:31,914
Okay.

759
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:34,116
Coriander seed,

760
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:39,889
Like a young girl
walking through a lemon
grove by the ocean,

761
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:42,024
Wondering what
her future holds.

762
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:46,462
Ah! Cloves and cinnamon.

763
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:47,864
(inhales deeply)

764
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:49,932
Hmm, like a crazy
aunt and uncle.

765
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,103
Very noisy, very funny,
very opinionated.

766
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:56,305
But a little
goes a long way.

767
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,208
And turmeric.

768
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,943
(inhales deeply)

769
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:04,280
Ah! Glee!
The golden spice.

770
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,183
Makes everything glow.

771
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,118
You know we used
to use turmeric

772
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,387
To color the elephants
at the delhi circus?

773
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,488
You were
with the circus?

774
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,624
Yes, of course
I was with the circus.

775
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:17,226
Come on, come on,
you're lagging.

776
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,567
Whoa! Don't you want
to measure that?

777
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:29,305
A man who measures life
will never know
his own measure.

778
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,476
What, did you read that
on a fortune cookie?

779
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:35,044
Actually, yes.

780
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:36,946
So what, you never
use a recipe?

781
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:41,918
Everything I need is here,
here and here.

782
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,953
And a little bit here.

783
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:45,454
All right.

784
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:47,290
Here, come on,
you try it.
Me?

785
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:48,991
Yeah, of course you,
who else?

786
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:50,459
No, no, I don't
work like that.

787
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:53,029
Well, come on,
give it a try,
my friend. Come on!

788
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,464
Come on!

789
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,668
I don't even know
the proportions.

790
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:01,637
Oh! Guess-timate!

791
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,444
(samir sighs)

792
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,573
(coughing)

793
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,610
I thought you said
you couldn't tell
until it was in the oil.

794
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:43,713
Um, sometimes
you can tell.

795
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,082
(sighs)

796
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,351
(sniffling)

797
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:58,227
I'm sorry,
is everything okay?

798
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,229
It's delicious.

799
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:03,699
It reminds me
of my grandmother
cooking back home.

800
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:05,434
How happy I was then,
you know.

801
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,107
It's so spicy.

802
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,709
(exhales)

803
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,560
Farrida: Samir,
are you in there?

804
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,033
Mom, I'm on the phone.
I'm busy.

805
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,103
Why are you
taking the phone
in the toilet?

806
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,107
Mom, I just want
some privacy, okay?

807
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,815
Samir, are you
doing phone sex?

808
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,354
Mom.

809
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,227
(knocking)

810
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,296
What?

811
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:09,698
Samir, please
be a good boy.

812
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:12,234
Mom!

813
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,252
(ringing)

814
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,675
(classical indian
music playing)

815
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,832
(clucking)

816
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,174
Akbar.

817
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:27,643
(making clucking noise)

818
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,413
You nasty little egg!

819
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:33,182
Couple of them got
the door loose.

820
00:52:33,184 --> 00:52:34,717
They're crafty.

821
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,752
Okay. Why are there live
chickens in the kitchen?

822
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:39,455
Fresh meat.
It's much tastier than
that frozen stuff.

823
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:40,890
And it's healthier, too.

824
00:52:40,892 --> 00:52:43,159
We can't have
live poultry
in the kitchen.

825
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:45,261
This is new york.
They will shut us down.

826
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:46,428
Nobody's going
to find out.

827
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:48,664
There are
feathers everywhere.

828
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,732
Oh, we'll sweep up.

829
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:50,900
Besides, we have
to do something.

830
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:52,601
I just fired
that meat guy.

831
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:55,171
You did what?
What...

832
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:56,438
Rasool?
Yeah.

833
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,909
Oh, I chased him out
of here with a shank.

834
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:02,211
He's a bloody crook,
that fellow.

835
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:05,247
I know he's a crook.
Oh, my god!

836
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,683
What are these?

837
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,452
(chuckling) menus.

838
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:11,687
Really? I know
they're menus.

839
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:15,958
They're too limited.
I prefer to improvise.

840
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,195
Oh, really? What if
people don't want
what you improvise?

841
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:20,429
People don't know
what they want.

842
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:22,298
They know what
they've had.

843
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,500
So let's give them
something new.

844
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,639
Listen to me, okay?
Mmm-hmm.

845
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:33,642
I asked you to work here.
I want you to work here.

846
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:35,878
But I am in charge here.
Do you understand?

847
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,281
So before you
go hiring people,
or firing people,

848
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:43,252
Or ordering live
chickens, okay, you
have to ask me first.

849
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:44,954
I am the boss.
Do you understand?

850
00:53:44,956 --> 00:53:48,657
Oh, yes, boss.
Here, have some lunch.

851
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:56,865
(classical indian
music playing)

852
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,251
Take that thing
off your head.

853
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:15,985
But I was told...

854
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:18,287
Would you just
take it off?

855
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:20,022
Yes, sir.

856
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,854
I know everything
that is going on.

857
00:54:52,356 --> 00:54:59,328
You tell my chef to
fuck himself while
he's praying namaz.

858
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:00,396
What?

859
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:01,697
Namaz.

860
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:04,500
Please, calm down.
Your heart.

861
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:06,468
And you could
use a nicer word.

862
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,805
Okay, he wasn't
praying namaz.
He was, like, eating lunch.

863
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,907
You threw his things.
You hit him!

864
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:13,642
Beta, roti?
No, ma.

865
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:15,311
I didn't hit him.
I didn't hit anybody.

866
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:18,080
Beta, man cannot
live on frosty frosty.

867
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:20,849
How can a human
being do this, huh?

868
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:22,418
Whose child is this?
What are you...

869
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,853
Calm down, hakim,
he said he didn't hit him.

870
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,757
Beta, it's very bad
to hit someone
when they are praying.

871
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:32,761
I didn't hit him
while he was praying.
I didn't hit him, okay?

872
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:36,332
He was eating lunch and
he was spitting paan juice
all over the kitchen

873
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:38,000
Which is a health
code violation.

874
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:40,502
Are you bloody
lecturing me
about my business?

875
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:44,740
Sala, I made
that restaurant
before I made you.

876
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:46,408
That's not true, hakim.

877
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,844
Please, please, woman.
I'm not talking to you.

878
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:52,414
Arre, you have hired a bloody
taxi cab driver to cook
food in my restaurant?

879
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:56,518
Yes, yes, but he was
a chef in mumbai.

880
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,954
Of course he was.

881
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:01,790
And I used to be
the king of sweden.

882
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,559
You didn't
know that, huh?

883
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:07,062
And your mother
is the bloody
michael jordan.

884
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:11,100
Anything anybody
tells you, you believe,
except your father.

885
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:13,702
You know what?
This is exactly...

886
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:19,675
You know, I'm not
going to fight with
you, all right?

887
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,844
I have to go to work.

888
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:29,685
(door closes)

889
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:31,520
Amit-bhai is right.

890
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:34,156
I should just sell
the bloody restaurant.

891
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:36,759
One less headache
around my neck.

892
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,163
Akbar: Nah, not yet. Not yet.

893
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:42,865
You have to wait
until the flavor

894
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:45,167
Of the aromatics
is fully absorbed
by the oil.

895
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,003
You got to
trust your senses.

896
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:49,671
(inhales deeply)

897
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,008
Now?
Now, now.

898
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,610
There you go!

899
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,445
Give it a stir.

900
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:57,713
I know.

901
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,750
You think too much,
you know.

902
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:07,089
Always remember,
from here, here
and here. All three.

903
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:10,793
You cook only
from there, everything
turns out cerebral.

904
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:12,528
Okay, you know what,
that's great,

905
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:14,463
But cooking isn't
all just here
and here and here.

906
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:16,698
Yes, of course,
you've got to have
some structure as well.

907
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,101
You don't put chilies
into a jalebi.

908
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:25,641
But with indian cooking,
a recipe is like a raaga
in indian music.

909
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,142
You know raaga?

910
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:28,744
(scatting raga)

911
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,451
It's just a template.

912
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:38,787
The important thing
is the interpretation,

913
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,556
The improvisation.

914
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,826
You ever been in love?

915
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,564
Yeah.

916
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,533
I mean, no, I don't...
I don't know.

917
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:52,734
You don't know?

918
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:56,572
A person who's
been in love, knows
he's been in love.

919
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:59,842
Ah, with my wife,
it was love
at first sight.

920
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,712
The first time
I looked into her eyes,

921
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,982
Everything disappeared.

922
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,852
What happened to her?

923
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:15,257
She died the summer
after we were married
during childbirth.

924
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,494
The baby died as well.

925
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,567
I'm sorry.

926
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,239
I had a brother.

927
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:36,578
He died in a car accident.

928
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,881
I'm sorry.

929
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,986
You must miss him.

930
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:54,530
You know what,
I don't know why I'm
doing this, actually.

931
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:58,300
I'm a chef. I don't
need to learn how to
cook from a cab driver.

932
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:14,583
I didn't...

933
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,852
I...

934
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,655
I didn't mean that.

935
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:27,296
Come here,
I want to show
you something.

936
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:29,331
Come here,
come here.

937
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:40,609
You know, my parents were
killed during partition.

938
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:45,714
I got that
trying to save them.

939
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:49,685
(sighs)
of course I couldn't,
I was only a child.

940
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,721
So, I was orphaned.

941
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:57,593
Throughout my
childhood, I kept
asking myself, "why?"

942
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:04,700
And then, one day I was
out walking in a field,
a storm blew up.

943
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:09,771
Right in front of my eyes,
this huge tree got
struck by lightning.

944
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,273
Boom!

945
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:14,176
It split into two.

946
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:21,049
And suddenly,
I was filled with
an overwhelming joy.

947
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,853
Why?

948
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:29,758
Because it was
the only sensible
way to feel.

949
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,162
You're alive.

950
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,403
You brother no longer
has that chance, you do.

951
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:45,007
I think you
should take it.

952
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,777
It'll help your masala.

953
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,919
Carrie: Hello?
Samir: Carrie?

954
01:00:57,921 --> 01:01:00,889
I was wondering
when I'd hear from you.

955
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:03,392
Samir: I meant
to call earlier.

956
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:05,994
Carrie: You did,
or at least your
parents did.

957
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,763
I have it on
my caller id.

958
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:08,997
Samir: Oh, right.

959
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,399
Carrie: Oh, busted.

960
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:11,967
Samir: Hmm.

961
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:16,438
Samir: Actually, I was
hoping that you'd let me
take you out to dinner.

962
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,708
Carrie: Sure. Will your
parents be coming?

963
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:22,377
Samir: They will not.

964
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,084
Hi.

965
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:30,819
Hi.

966
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:32,688
So you ready to go?

967
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:33,755
Yeah.

968
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:36,425
And I have
the perfect place.

969
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:38,760
You know, I made this
reservation at this...

970
01:01:38,762 --> 01:01:40,162
This is better.

971
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,431
Really?
Come on. Yeah.

972
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,175
What? You don't
like my place.

973
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,745
No, I... I was just
expecting something

974
01:01:56,747 --> 01:01:58,780
With a few
more amenities,
that's all.

975
01:01:58,782 --> 01:02:01,416
Like a table, chair,
I don't know,
maybe a ceiling.

976
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:02,951
Oh, I get it.

977
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,986
What?
You're a food snob.

978
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:06,722
Samir: I'm not a snob.
I just happen to know

979
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:08,457
A little about
food sanitation.

980
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:13,862
Okay.

981
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:17,766
Well?

982
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:19,868
Mmm!

983
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,438
Good, it's good.
Mmm-hmm.

984
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:26,775
See? When I eat
something like this,

985
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:30,145
I remember why
I got into cooking
in the first place.

986
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,815
What about you?
What's the first thing
that you ever cooked?

987
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,387
Samosas.

988
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,959
Yeah,
my brother and I,
we used to sneak

989
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:46,762
Into the restaurant
kitchen after school.

990
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:48,163
We used to have
this old cook.

991
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:52,334
He was amazing.

992
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:54,803
The way his hands moved,
he was like a magician.

993
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,975
He used to let us
play with the spices,

994
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:03,044
All the colors
and the smells,
and...

995
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:06,515
It was great.

996
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:09,851
I used to love
going back there.

997
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,123
Hmm.

998
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,237
(hindi music playing)

999
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,913
Sorry, ma'am,
we're not open for
another hour or so.

1000
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:13,849
Oh, well,
thank you.

1001
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:15,884
But I was only
looking for my son.

1002
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:21,857
Oh! You must be
samir's mother?

1003
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:24,059
(chuckles)
salam walaikum.

1004
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,394
You must be very proud.

1005
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:32,934
Of course, it's evident
where he gets his spirit,
his good looks.

1006
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:36,304
What a fortunate fellow
to have someone like
yourself for his mother.

1007
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:40,342
Excuse me,
but what is your
good name please?

1008
01:04:40,344 --> 01:04:42,410
Akbar hamidbhai khambati.

1009
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,946
But you can
call me akbar.

1010
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,650
So, you are
from khambhat?

1011
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:49,985
Khambhat, of course.

1012
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:56,157
Baldiwala is my father's
best friend's neighbor.

1013
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:59,361
Because, you see,
my sister married

1014
01:04:59,363 --> 01:05:01,897
Baldiwala's sister's
middle son.

1015
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:03,932
Uh-huh.
I'm rassiwala's daughter.

1016
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:08,103
Hey, farrida,
the older one.
Yes, yes, of course.

1017
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:09,938
Aaiye, aaiye.
Come in, please.

1018
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,207
Uh, music
not bothering
you, I hope.

1019
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:14,676
Oh, no, no, no,
not bothering.

1020
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:19,014
I tell you, nobody
can sing a love song
like mukesh.

1021
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:21,683
Wah, wah, wah.

1022
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:25,253
I used to sing
this song to my wife.

1023
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:32,661
But your husband
must also be
singing to you. Hmm?

1024
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:34,396
How could he not?

1025
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,399
Well, of course.

1026
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:41,970
In fact, my husband,
he asked me to come here,

1027
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:45,607
Oh, please tell
your husband that
I am most fortunate

1028
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,709
To be working
with your son.

1029
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:51,079
He runs a very tight ship.
Ship shape.

1030
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:52,681
I'm proud to
call him my boss.

1031
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:55,617
Oh! Well...

1032
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,652
(both chuckle)

1033
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,454
Good!

1034
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,725
Thank you.
Oh, you're welcome.

1035
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:10,031
Oh, uh...

1036
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:11,533
(chuckling)

1037
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:20,041
(speaking hindi)

1038
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,012
If you want to die,

1039
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,748
If you want to die,

1040
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,350
Why don't you
just kill yourself?

1041
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:06,788
Darling?

1042
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:09,591
So, did you go
to the restaurant?

1043
01:07:09,593 --> 01:07:10,792
Yes.

1044
01:07:10,794 --> 01:07:12,127
Ah.

1045
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:15,096
And you saw
the taxi driver?

1046
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:16,031
Yes.

1047
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:20,568
What did he
say to you?

1048
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:23,405
Many things.

1049
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:28,043
What's wrong
with you, huh?

1050
01:07:28,045 --> 01:07:30,145
Why can't you talk?

1051
01:07:30,147 --> 01:07:32,047
You want to know
what he said to me?

1052
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:34,482
Well, I'll tell you
what he said to me.

1053
01:07:34,484 --> 01:07:35,784
He said,

1054
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,086
I'm a very
beautiful woman.

1055
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,588
He said I'm
filled with spirit.

1056
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:45,727
And he sang to me
a love song he used
to sing to his wife.

1057
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,134
A love song?

1058
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,106
Which love song?

1059
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,275
(knocking on door)

1060
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,444
(laughing)

1061
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:03,711
Sorry, we're
a little late.

1062
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:05,613
You are right on
time, my friend.

1063
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:07,582
Akbar, this is carrie.
Carrie.

1064
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:09,217
Carrie, meet akbar.

1065
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:10,652
This is an honor.
Nice to meet you.

1066
01:08:10,654 --> 01:08:12,520
Come in,
come in, my friends.
Welcome, welcome.

1067
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:14,589
I hope you don't mind,
I've invited some
friends of mine.

1068
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,091
Notorious reprobates
of course,

1069
01:08:16,093 --> 01:08:18,827
But they do enjoy
fine cuisine.

1070
01:08:18,829 --> 01:08:20,195
Sit, sit, carrie,
sit please.

1071
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:23,698
Hi, I'm carrie.

1072
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,166
Patel.

1073
01:08:25,168 --> 01:08:25,834
Shah.

1074
01:08:25,836 --> 01:08:28,136
Babu. Howdy?

1075
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,238
Hi, nice to meet you.

1076
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,173
Shahjahani biryani.

1077
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:37,645
Mmm, it's named after
the mughal emperor
who built the taj mahal.

1078
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:40,181
He was also
a renowned glutton.

1079
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:43,418
He tends to be a
show off when it comes
to beautiful woman.

1080
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,386
Well, I don't see
anything wrong with that.

1081
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:46,488
(akbar chuckles)

1082
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,790
(speaking hindi)

1083
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:50,658
Roast leg of lamb.

1084
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:54,229
And chicken hara bhara.

1085
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:57,732
And this is my specialty,
ande ki bhurji.

1086
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,400
What's that?

1087
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:00,502
Scramble egg.

1088
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:01,569
Scrambled eggs.
Scrambled eggs.

1089
01:09:01,571 --> 01:09:02,804
(laughing)

1090
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:07,575
Yeah, put a little
scramble egg here.

1091
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:10,778
Samir: My goodness.
Pass me that.

1092
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,213
Where did you get these?
This?

1093
01:09:12,215 --> 01:09:14,883
Oh, I found them
in a chinese market.

1094
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:19,821
They reminded me
of a dish I ate once
in pondicherry.

1095
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:21,356
Oh, pondicherry?

1096
01:09:21,358 --> 01:09:23,158
Pondicherry was
a french colony,
you know?

1097
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,627
The only french
colony in india.

1098
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:29,664
I've always considered it
one of the great
tragedies of history,

1099
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:33,201
That the french in
india never made it
further up north.

1100
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,203
Just think of it.

1101
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:36,938
Two of the finest
cuisines in the world.

1102
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,740
The french
and the indian
coming together

1103
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:41,943
For an epicurean
meeting of the minds.

1104
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:45,513
Instead, we end up
getting colonized
by the bloody british,

1105
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,582
Whose greatest
culinary achievement
in 2,000 years

1106
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:49,384
Is the fish and chips.

1107
01:09:49,386 --> 01:09:50,451
(all laughing)

1108
01:09:50,453 --> 01:09:54,822
Whether it's
a frenchman or englishman
occupying your land,

1109
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:55,924
It's still occupation.

1110
01:09:55,926 --> 01:09:57,458
(speaking hindi)

1111
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,727
The french
cooking is heavy.

1112
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:00,795
(all chuckle)

1113
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:09,204
But, is there
a trick to...

1114
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:11,206
Well, the trick is,

1115
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,474
Pick it up,
don't flick it.

1116
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:16,277
Pick it up and put
it in your mouth.

1117
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:19,981
And that's it.

1118
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:24,819
You know,
the shah of iran
visited india once,

1119
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:27,755
And he was heard
to remark that
eating with a utensil

1120
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,826
Is like making love
through an interpreter.

1121
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:34,329
Mmm!
(all chuckling)

1122
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,598
Yeah, it's good, man.

1123
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:41,936
Why don't you pass
the eggplant? Okay.

1124
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:43,271
Thank you.

1125
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:45,340
(hindi music playing)

1126
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,875
(laughs)

1127
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,932
Samir: You know,
when I was a kid,

1128
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:49,904
My dad used to bring
ali and I up to our roof,

1129
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,573
Just to look out
at those lights.

1130
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:55,677
He used to say,

1131
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:58,546
"in a place with
lights like that,

1132
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:01,482
"any dream can come true."

1133
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:30,104
(snoring)

1134
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,619
What happened?

1135
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,160
It's time for
morning prayers.

1136
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:59,066
(both chanting in arabic)

1137
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:28,716
Samir, what did you do?

1138
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:31,018
Look what you did.

1139
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:33,754
Who told you
to do this?

1140
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:35,823
Nobody told you
to do this.

1141
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,693
Why did you do this?

1142
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:43,631
I wanted to make it
like it used to be.

1143
01:16:43,633 --> 01:16:45,633
Like it used to be.

1144
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:48,970
But things are not
like they used to be.

1145
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,172
Don't you understand that?

1146
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:54,108
Samir, I'm not
keeping the restaurant.

1147
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:56,344
Amit-bhai is going
to buy it from me.

1148
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:57,945
Okay, dad,

1149
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:02,717
You don't have to,
because business is
really picking up.

1150
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:04,051
And I'm telling
you if we...

1151
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:05,886
Listen to me, samir.

1152
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:09,090
I'm closing the restaurant.

1153
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,292
Amit-bhai is right.

1154
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:13,794
It's too much for
me with my heart.

1155
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:18,799
Besides, ali is gone.

1156
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:22,036
And you're grown.

1157
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,772
What am I
breaking my back for?

1158
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:27,808
Dad, you're wrong.
You're wrong.

1159
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,211
Dad, it's your restaurant.

1160
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,048
If you just give it away,
then what the hell
was it all for?

1161
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:36,317
Dad, it's our restaurant!

1162
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:05,212
Andrei.

1163
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:08,449
Pierre.

1164
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:10,251
Was it 225?

1165
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:11,686
Yes.

1166
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:12,787
Or was it 250?

1167
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:14,822
Yes.

1168
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:18,259
Pierre, you ever
slept with two woman
at the same time?

1169
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:21,128
Yes.

1170
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:24,365
You, rascal.

1171
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:27,968
I'm sorry, guys.

1172
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:44,885
So, on to
new adventures.

1173
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,254
Do you ever
get discouraged?

1174
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:51,892
Despair is the solace
of fools, my friend.

1175
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:56,764
I tell you, they're
really a fount of wisdom.

1176
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:02,036
Well, khuda hafiz.

1177
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,809
Thank you, akbar.

1178
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:12,413
Truly my pleasure, samir.

1179
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:11,105
Samir, what
brings you here?

1180
01:20:11,107 --> 01:20:13,808
Oh, I was just
looking for steve.

1181
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:14,875
Is he...

1182
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:16,310
Oh, he's upstairs
actually.

1183
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:17,378
Okay, thanks.

1184
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:19,280
Hey, congratulations.

1185
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:23,918
Samir, I was about to
call you. What the hell
are you doing here?

1186
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,986
Hi. Oh, wow!

1187
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:30,157
Well, I was gonna
get on my hands
and knees

1188
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,393
And beg steve
for my job back.

1189
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:34,261
Job? What the hell
are you talking about?

1190
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:35,563
You're famous.

1191
01:20:35,565 --> 01:20:37,131
What?
Oh!

1192
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:40,000
The    times!
You got three stars.

1193
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:43,938
Look, "best indian
in new york." trust me.

1194
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,307
Oh, my god.

1195
01:20:46,309 --> 01:20:48,042
Oh, my god. Wow!

1196
01:20:48,044 --> 01:20:49,877
Three stars and it
would have been four,

1197
01:20:49,879 --> 01:20:51,579
Except the decor
was for shit.

1198
01:20:51,581 --> 01:20:53,347
Oh, my god.
I gotta go there.

1199
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:55,149
Yeah, go, go!

1200
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,386
Yeah!

1201
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:03,891
Be careful with that.
Careful with that.

1202
01:21:03,893 --> 01:21:05,526
That's my persian
fertility relic.

1203
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:06,994
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, samir!

1204
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:08,062
Where are you going?

1205
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:09,463
Akron, ohio.

1206
01:21:09,465 --> 01:21:10,531
What?

1207
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:13,234
Akron, the city
of the future!

1208
01:21:13,236 --> 01:21:14,435
You know,
about a year ago,

1209
01:21:14,437 --> 01:21:16,604
I met a guy from akron,
ohio in my taxi.

1210
01:21:16,606 --> 01:21:18,639
He was in import-export.

1211
01:21:18,641 --> 01:21:21,408
I told him,
"way back in the '70s,

1212
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,010
"I used to be part
owner of a company

1213
01:21:23,012 --> 01:21:25,012
"that exported
lotas from calcutta."

1214
01:21:25,014 --> 01:21:26,881
He seemed very
interested in my idea.

1215
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:29,650
Yeah, lotas. You know,
that metal bucket,

1216
01:21:29,652 --> 01:21:31,418
That villagers in
india carry water in,

1217
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:34,889
We're going to export
those lotas to paris,

1218
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:36,957
For the french to
chill their champagne.

1219
01:21:36,959 --> 01:21:42,563
Okay, you can't leave.
You know why?
Because we got three stars.

1220
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:46,233
Oh-ho, very impressive.
Yeah.

1221
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:48,636
"veritable symphony
of flavors.

1222
01:21:48,638 --> 01:21:52,339
"inspired choice of spices.
Inspired...Blah, blah, blah,

1223
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:55,943
"one occasion,
the    murghi masala
was a little dry."

1224
01:21:58,013 --> 01:21:59,647
Ignorant bastard.

1225
01:21:59,649 --> 01:22:01,649
So, I need you
to come back.

1226
01:22:01,651 --> 01:22:04,518
Yes, I do.
Because in about an hour,

1227
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,987
There's gonna be
100 people in
that restaurant.

1228
01:22:06,989 --> 01:22:09,590
Why, that's wonderful!
That's wonderful.

1229
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:11,292
Yeah, and some of
them may be hungry.

1230
01:22:11,294 --> 01:22:12,993
So, I don't know
what you want me to do.

1231
01:22:12,995 --> 01:22:17,965
Remember what I told you?
From here, here and here.

1232
01:22:17,967 --> 01:22:19,500
It's not my cooking
that they're coming for.

1233
01:22:19,502 --> 01:22:21,302
It's yours. You are
the chef. Not me.

1234
01:22:21,304 --> 01:22:23,203
You were beginning
to get the hang of it.

1235
01:22:23,205 --> 01:22:25,239
Now just don't
think too much.

1236
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:27,174
I can't do what you did.

1237
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:29,376
Don't do what I did.
Do what you do.

1238
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:30,444
I don't know
what that is.

1239
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:32,947
Don't worry,
it'll come to you.

1240
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:40,554
Samir?

1241
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:54,201
Mom. Yeah,
put dad on the phone.

1242
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:55,970
Farrida:
He's not here, beta.

1243
01:22:55,972 --> 01:22:57,504
He's gone to
see amit-bhai.

1244
01:22:57,506 --> 01:23:00,007
What, he hasn't
seen the review?

1245
01:23:00,009 --> 01:23:03,610
He hasn't...
Okay, mom,
I have to go.

1246
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:06,246
Please call him
and tell him

1247
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:09,149
To come to
the restaurant
immediately, okay?

1248
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:11,151
All right.
I love you.

1249
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:15,155
Andrei: Step back. Step back.

1250
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,658
Step back.
Keep it clear.

1251
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,030
Step back.
Keep it clear.

1252
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:26,467
We're not to open
for another two hours.

1253
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:27,768
Sounds like it's
worth the wait.

1254
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:29,737
I told you,
she knew everyone.

1255
01:23:29,739 --> 01:23:32,473
I bought you
another copy.

1256
01:23:32,475 --> 01:23:33,574
Thank you for
coming back.

1257
01:23:33,576 --> 01:23:35,175
Thank you.

1258
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,645
It'll be just
a few more minutes.

1259
01:23:38,647 --> 01:23:41,582
Step back.
Keep it clear.

1260
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:45,719
(panting)

1261
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:59,099
You guys busy?
What am I saying?

1262
01:23:59,101 --> 01:24:01,802
Of course
you're not busy.
Come with me.

1263
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:08,108
No, I'm really serious.
Come with me.

1264
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:10,811
Come on. Let's go.

1265
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:33,600
Take this all
back to the kitchen.

1266
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:36,770
Straight back.
Straight back
to the kitchen.

1267
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:38,472
I'll be right in.

1268
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:05,833
Andrei: Excuse me.

1269
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:09,870
It's an even dice.
See, like this.

1270
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:12,506
Carrie?

1271
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:14,174
I...

1272
01:25:14,176 --> 01:25:17,211
I figured
that you might
need a little help.

1273
01:25:17,213 --> 01:25:18,345
Oh.

1274
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,515
And, I got you
a little present,

1275
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,283
Chef.

1276
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:27,621
Thanks.

1277
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:31,425
Okay, come on,
cover up.

1278
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:22,943
You know what,
this is crazy.

1279
01:26:22,945 --> 01:26:24,645
I think I'm just
gonna get the recipes,

1280
01:26:24,647 --> 01:26:26,713
Just to get the basic
proportions. Okay?

1281
01:26:26,715 --> 01:26:28,582
Okay, I'll be
right back.

1282
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:29,683
No.

1283
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,788
Pierre,
you said, "no."

1284
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,495
(hindi music playing)

1285
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:45,826
(sniffing)

1286
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,578
That's it?

1287
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:05,646
That's it.

1288
01:28:06,514 --> 01:28:08,682
The magic is
all in here.

1289
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:18,025
(sighs) you sure?

1290
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:24,765
Sometimes you can't tell
until it's in the oil.

1291
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:27,434
So...

1292
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:34,408
Come on, everyone.
Let's get to work!

1293
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:43,016
Okay, whip in this
ghee, all right?

1294
01:28:43,018 --> 01:28:44,885
Whip it in
nice and good.

1295
01:28:44,887 --> 01:28:46,420
Who's on that dal?

1296
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:51,391
Whip it in.
Don't let it puddle, okay?

1297
01:28:51,592 --> 01:28:54,428
Samir: All right. Yeah, yeah.
Put some of this in there.

1298
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:56,563
There we go. Beautiful.

1299
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:03,036
Okay, that's looks good.

1300
01:29:03,038 --> 01:29:05,472
That's great.
Put in some of this.

1301
01:29:05,474 --> 01:29:07,474
Yeah, keep stirring.
Keep stirring.

1302
01:29:07,476 --> 01:29:10,510
Okay, don't overdo it
on the tamarind glaze.

1303
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:17,050
Two half tandoori
chops of lamb

1304
01:29:17,052 --> 01:29:19,886
With gnocchi
in summer pea puree.

1305
01:29:19,888 --> 01:29:23,457
Next to it is a
baby goat garam masala

1306
01:29:23,459 --> 01:29:28,128
On top of
jerusalem artichoke puree
with cardamom braised carrots.

1307
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:32,399
Just little squiggles,
little squiggles.
That looks beautiful.

1308
01:29:32,401 --> 01:29:34,368
Just hurry up on
those garnishes.

1309
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:36,036
You can't hurry
a work of art.

1310
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:38,372
Samir: Looks good.
Looking good,
everybody.

1311
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:40,040
What's a guy gotta
do to get a table
in this joint?

1312
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:44,378
Well, you can take
these to table two.

1313
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,580
Go.

1314
01:29:46,582 --> 01:29:50,917
It's a wild king salmon
encrusted in mustard seed.

1315
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:54,421
Then roasted in
the tandoor oven

1316
01:29:54,423 --> 01:29:58,592
And finished in
mango-pickle beurre blanc.

1317
01:29:58,594 --> 01:29:59,726
Samir: How we coming along?

1318
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:01,995
We're running low on...

1319
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:06,032
Yeah, that.
And otherwise,
everything's good.

1320
01:30:06,034 --> 01:30:07,768
Samir?
Not now, mom.

1321
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:09,970
Uh, how's that vindaloo?
Coming, chef.

1322
01:30:09,972 --> 01:30:12,439
But, samir...
Not now, mom.

1323
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:14,174
Uh, I need more
cilantro sprigs.

1324
01:30:14,176 --> 01:30:15,442
But, samir...

1325
01:30:15,444 --> 01:30:16,643
Mom, what?

1326
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:20,013
It's just that
they're asking for you.

1327
01:30:25,019 --> 01:30:26,119
Oh.

1328
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:50,677
(all applauding)

1329
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,558
Thank you.
Thank you.

1330
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:06,560
Enjoy your meal.

1331
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:11,698
Enjoy your food.

1332
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:30,917
I think it is time for me
to meet this cab driver.

1333
01:31:34,622 --> 01:31:35,789
He's gone.

1334
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:37,190
He's gone?

1335
01:31:37,692 --> 01:31:39,559
Who cooked
all this food?

1336
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:43,029
You?

1337
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:45,565
Your father
was just saying,

1338
01:31:45,567 --> 01:31:48,235
How much he regrets
not having tasted
your cooking

1339
01:31:48,237 --> 01:31:52,506
And how much he's
looking forward to it.
Isn't that right, hakim?

1340
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:26,273
(sighs)

1341
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:37,584
This is bloody good food.

1342
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:17,724
I'm sorry, amit-bhai.

1343
01:33:18,225 --> 01:33:20,327
I'm afraid
the deal is off.

1344
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:23,663
I'm going
into business

1345
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:26,766
With my son.

1346
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:35,041
You don't introduce us
to your friend, beta?

1347
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:40,714
Mom, dad,

1348
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:46,219
This is carrie.

1349
01:33:50,324 --> 01:33:51,625
She's my

1350
01:33:53,894 --> 01:33:55,295
Sous-chef.

1351
01:33:56,831 --> 01:33:58,231
Sous-chef?

1352
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:00,767
She helped
with everything.

1353
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:04,804
That's wonderful.

1354
01:34:05,106 --> 01:34:06,840
I'm so pleased
to meet you.

1355
01:34:06,842 --> 01:34:08,775
Pleased to
meet you also.

1356
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:10,410
Very nice.

1357
01:34:10,412 --> 01:34:12,012
Thank you.

1358
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,280
Excuse me.

1359
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:21,187
You know what?
We should head back.

1360
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:24,290
Oh, yeah, go, go, go.
Don't worry about us.
Go, go.

1361
01:34:24,292 --> 01:34:25,692
I'm sorry.

1362
01:34:28,763 --> 01:34:30,030
(sighs)

1363
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:32,265
Sous-chef. Hmm.

1364
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:33,867
(chuckles)

1365
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,869
You believe that?

1366
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:39,839
Not for a second.

1367
01:34:41,976 --> 01:34:43,410
Do we care?

1368
01:34:43,744 --> 01:34:45,745
Not for a second.

1369
01:34:52,753 --> 01:34:54,988
So, sous-chef, huh?

1370
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:57,757
Uh, yeah, well,
I think you're ready.

1371
01:34:58,092 --> 01:35:00,093
Really?
What does it pay?

1372
01:35:00,095 --> 01:35:02,395
Oh, the pay? Terrible.

1373
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:05,799
But I really think
you gonna like
the benefits.

1374
01:35:13,908 --> 01:35:15,942
We are in the weeds,
people. Let's go!
