1
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,390
China in the mid-19th century...

2
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,300
the suffering of its people under
the corrupt rule of the Qing dynasty

3
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,990
set the stage for the Taiping Rebellion.

4
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,490
During the chaos of
the 14 years long civil war,

5
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,990
70 million people died
in battle or from starvation...

6
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,600
The casualties equaled
the recorded death toll from WWll.

7
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
He said...

8
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,300
the day he crawled out
from the pile of corpses...

9
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
he was a dead man

10
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,800
He also said...

11
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,100
it was an age when death came easy...

12
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,900
but living was hard

13
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,400
All my men died

14
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,900
I alone survived

15
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,300
You were lucky

16
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,300
I played dead

17
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,500
My brothers... more than 1600 men...

18
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
fought for three days and nights...

19
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,000
They all died...

20
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,800
The Kui army were inhuman

21
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,400
They only stood behind us and watched

22
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,800
My brothers were
slaughtered one after another

23
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,900
No one survived

24
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,400
He met a woman that day

25
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,800
They spent the night in a deserted house

26
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,000
He didn't know if it was
the woman or the soup...

27
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,300
that brought him back to life

28
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,400
Where can I find food?

29
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,900
Try the main street

30
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,900
He said...

31
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,200
the first time he met me...

32
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,600
the sky was overcast, like his mood

33
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,500
But I remember clearly...

34
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,700
that it was a glaringly sunny day

35
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,400
Eat your food and let's get going!

36
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,200
Eat and get to work!

37
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,600
Dig in!

38
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,300
You sure know how to fight

39
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,200
I should introduce you to my big brother!

40
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,200
Where are we going?

41
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,400
To rob!

42
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,100
from the rebel army!

43
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,100
He later told me he was outraged...

44
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,300
that bandits like us dared steal from troops

45
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,100
What did we care? Famine is everywhere

46
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,200
We either robbed or died

47
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,100
Ride out!

48
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,000
Kill them!

49
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,700
Seize their leader, hurry!

50
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,100
He saved my life that day...

51
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,200
and taught me a lesson

52
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,600
Strike the head... and the body will fall

53
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,700
Brother Jiang...

54
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,000
Look!

55
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
That man gave them to you

56
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,600
They're for generals

57
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Brother Jiang has become a general!

58
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,600
Brother Jiang has become a general!

59
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,100
What are you thinking about?

60
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,800
My home

61
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,900
They've returned!

62
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,800
Come with me! We've got food!

63
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,700
I have good news, tonight we feast!

64
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Why are you alone?

65
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,700
I ran away from home

66
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,800
Is that a Yangzhou accent?

67
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
You noticed?

68
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,000
How could you tell?

69
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,000
Have you ever heard of Yangzhou Ponies?

70
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,600
You mean pretty young girls
who are trained as courtesans...

71
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,300
and sold to rich men?

72
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,200
Yes

73
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,900
But when I turned 15...

74
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,800
and was about to be sold...

75
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,100
a man came and stole me away

76
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,100
He was my childhood playmate

77
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,800
He killed a few people

78
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,700
We went into hiding and he became a bandit

79
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,100
He thought he saved you,

80
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,400
but you were no longer the same peasant girl

81
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
He's a good man

82
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,500
Go in peace!

83
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,300
Go in peace!

84
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,000
Big brother laid down the rule...

85
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
to save seats and wine...

86
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
for the brothers who died

87
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Were you a general in the army?

88
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,000
Not anymore

89
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Why did you desert?

90
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,700
Drink up!

91
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,100
My troops and the Kui troops

92
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,500
planned to join forces against the enemy

93
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,100
But they betrayed us

94
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,200
We were outnumbered...

95
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,100
and all my brothers were killed!

96
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,600
There's nothing more important
than the love between brothers

97
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,400
That I agree

98
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,400
These days, without brothers...

99
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,700
you can't survive

100
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,200
Wu-Yang, dinner's here

101
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,900
Are the new recruits staying?

102
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,400
No one wants to leave when there's food

103
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,900
Except for Pang, he 's not our kind

104
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,900
I don't know if he's staying or not

105
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
Pretty, isn't it?

106
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,600
I snatched it from a dead man

107
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,800
Do you know what this is?

108
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,000
No

109
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
It protects you

110
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,900
Did that night really happen?

111
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,700
I waited there for you...

112
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,200
wondering if it was all a dream

113
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,400
If you ran away, why did you come back?

114
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,600
I ran away many times,

115
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,200
had it all thought out

116
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,000
But I always ended up back here

117
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,800
Why did you come back?

118
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,600
You should decide for your own life

119
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,400
Stay here!

120
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,900
"Kui"

121
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
Why are you robbing our food?

122
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,400
I dare you to hit me?

123
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,900
Go ahead!

124
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
Stop fighting!

125
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm old enough to be your grandmother!

126
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,500
Stand back or I'll shoot!

127
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
I dare you!

128
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,000
I swear I'll shoot...

129
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,500
Go ahead! Kill me too!

130
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,500
You!

131
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,500
Nobody moves!

132
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Look at me when I speak

133
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,100
You think you can keep the food you robbed?

134
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,400
Consider this as a pay back to your country

135
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,300
Let's go!

136
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,400
If only we had guns... we could fight them!

137
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,800
That's suicide!

138
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,300
I'd rather die than live like this!

139
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,400
Thieves are always on the run

140
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,700
Why not join the army?

141
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,400
Once you're in the army...

142
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,600
you'll receive wages to feed your families

143
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,100
You'll get guns so...

144
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,100
that no one will bully you

145
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,900
This village will finally have peace

146
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,900
We're bandits, will the army take us?

147
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,900
The Kui army is grandiose and powerful

148
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,900
They couldn't care less about us

149
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,000
But Lord Chen's army is desperate for men

150
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,900
He wants to increase his power...

151
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,000
to rival the Kui army

152
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,100
He should welcome us with open arms

153
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,200
Er-Hu, seize this opportunity

154
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,400
Then today's event...
will never happen again

155
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,000
Alright!

156
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,500
As bandits...

157
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,900
We have to be the biggest!

158
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,200
You deserted the Ching army,

159
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,900
now you want us to join them?
You're a two-faced man

160
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,400
Why shall we trust you?

161
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,900
Take the blood oath!

162
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,300
To be blood brothers, we kill an outsider...

163
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,800
to show our loyalty to the brotherhood

164
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,300
Only the lives of our brothers count

165
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,900
The rest are expendable

166
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,000
I asked him that day

167
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,900
There's no turning back

168
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,100
Are you certain?

169
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,500
He said nothing

170
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,300
Let me...

171
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,400
Masters, what is it?!

172
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
What are you bastards doing?!

173
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,200
We were only passing through!

174
00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:00,100
Mercy me... please...

175
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,900
Remember my face...

176
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,000
and take revenge in your next life!

177
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,800
We, Pang Qing-Yun

178
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,700
Zhao Er-Hu

179
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,100
and Jiang Wu-Yang...

180
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,300
join the brotherhood today

181
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,900
We take the blood oath

182
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,700
We pledge our lives

183
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,600
Those who bring us harm...

184
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,100
must die

185
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,900
A brother who harms another brother...

186
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,600
must die

187
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,700
Heaven and earth bear witness...

188
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,100
and strike dead any man who breaks his oath

189
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,800
We share one heart...

190
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,600
He told me later that...

191
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,700
he didn't believe in the pledge

192
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,400
I asked him what he believed in

193
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,800
He said Er-Hu...

194
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,100
and me

195
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,700
Wait! Take these shoes with you

196
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,400
Take care!

197
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,800
Mother may never see you again

198
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,600
Good-bye, ma

199
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,500
Er Hu!

200
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,300
Shi and his men are leaving!

201
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,700
He said that he'd rather die...

202
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,700
than serve the Qing army!

203
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,400
Your entire battalion perished...

204
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,100
in the battle against
the Taiping rebels in Hechuan...

205
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,300
and you disappeared for 2 months!

206
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,600
How dare you return now?

207
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
My Lord Chan

208
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,100
Lord Jiang sent the Kui army...

209
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,100
to aid us in the battle at the Hechuan

210
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,600
But they left us to fend for ourselves

211
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,400
My men were slaughtered on the battlefield

212
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,000
All your men died...

213
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,400
but you alone survived?

214
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,100
I stayed alive...

215
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,700
just to see you again...

216
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,200
Lord Jiang

217
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
How many men do you have?

218
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,500
800

219
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,900
Give me another 800...

220
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,300
and I will capture Shu City within 15 days

221
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,000
Don't jest with me!

222
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,700
10!

223
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,900
I will capture Shu City in 10 days!

224
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,100
Well...

225
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,600
then...

226
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,400
I'll give you 1,500 fine soldiers...

227
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,400
but no wages

228
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,200
We don't need wages;

229
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,900
we get half the spoils
once we capture Shu City

230
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,200
Pang Qing-Yun

231
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,100
Name your army "Shan"

232
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,700
Thank you, my lords

233
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,100
You're gambling...

234
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,500
with 800 lives

235
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,600
War is a gamble

236
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,600
I won't gamble

237
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,200
My 1500 men are the last of Lord Chen's army

238
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,400
If we lose them...

239
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,300
my lord will be powerless
at the imperial court

240
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,300
Make me an offer!

241
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,400
My army...

242
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,700
will only give you a semblance of multitude

243
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,700
This is your only chance for victory

244
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,100
Otherwise...

245
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,800
you'll forever be
at the mercy of the Kui army!

246
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,800
Big brother!

247
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,500
They're all useless

248
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,700
We'll be facing 200 rifles

249
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,500
The odds are against us

250
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,600
To win, we need to attack

251
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,100
Break through their firing line...

252
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,900
Engage them in hand to hand combat

253
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,900
Brothers!

254
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,400
Tell him who's the toughest?

255
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,200
We are!

256
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,100
The enemy will be 300 paces away

257
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,600
Rifles have a range of 200 paces...

258
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,800
arrows have only 100

259
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,300
We'll need a vanguard of 200 men...

260
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,000
to run straight at the firing range

261
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
They must not dodge the bullets...

262
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,500
but must use their bodies as shields...

263
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,900
so that our archers...

264
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,700
who run behind them can get within range

265
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Many brothers will die in the process

266
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,700
I'm in!

267
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,800
Who's with me?

268
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Die and your family will
receive double your wages!

269
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,700
Live and you receive triple!

270
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,300
Don't you want to be rich?

271
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,400
Where are the real men?!

272
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,700
Come on!

273
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,800
Damn it, count me in!

274
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,900
Me too, I'm in...

275
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,400
Count me in...

276
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,100
me too...

277
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:30,900
I'm in...

278
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,600
Take Shu City!

279
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,700
Take their money, their food, their women!

280
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,800
Take Shu City!

281
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:49,600
Take their money, their food, their women!

282
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,500
You're vastly outnumbered...

283
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,100
victory is already ours

284
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,400
Surrender and your life will be spared

285
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,500
Kill them!!!

286
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,200
Fire!

287
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,900
Kill them!!!

288
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,900
Fire!

289
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,400
Fire!

290
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,500
Fire!

291
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,600
Kill them!!!

292
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
They're dying out there! Let's go!

293
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,600
Shut up and listen!

294
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
There's only one commander in a battle!

295
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,400
Kill them!!!

296
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,900
Shoot!

297
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,100
Shoot!

298
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,800
Brother!

299
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,200
Brother!

300
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,900
Prepare!

301
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,700
Blinders on!

302
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,500
He's using himself to goad me into combat

303
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,300
Go!

304
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,800
Big brother!

305
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,000
Brother...

306
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,100
No! Don't pull that out!

307
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,100
Hold steady!

308
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,600
We're really going to die this time

309
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,600
We're blood brothers!

310
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,500
We die as one!

311
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,400
That's right!

312
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,100
We might as well take a few with us...

313
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,300
as we go down!

314
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,500
Let's go...

315
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,100
Kill them!

316
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,200
It's madness!

317
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,800
800 men manage to upset an army of 5000...

318
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,200
We can win!

319
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,300
We really need a victory badly!

320
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,300
Follow me!

321
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,900
Wu-Yang!

322
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,200
Wu-Yang!

323
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,700
Lord Di...

324
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,200
Pang Qing-Yun must be blessed

325
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,700
Pang...

326
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,600
Fate has brought us together again

327
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,200
How fortunate of you to capture Shu City...

328
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,100
you have made a name for yourself

329
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,000
Pang...

330
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,500
how does 5 more battalions sound?

331
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,500
On top of that...

332
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:18,900
- Lu Da-Shan...
- Sir

333
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,200
will be under your command

334
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,100
Thank you, My Lord

335
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,300
Pang Qing-Yun

336
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,900
Your old friend from the
Kui army is waiting for you

337
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,100
He Kui

338
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,300
Sir

339
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,800
Greetings, my lords

340
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,000
It's been a long time, General Pang

341
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,500
lt'll be a reunion of old allies...

342
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,100
with you leading the attack...

343
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,200
and him bringing up the rear

344
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,700
How do we divide the spoils?

345
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,000
Lord Di and...

346
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,700
Lord Chen...

347
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,300
no objections I trust?

348
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,600
I'm afraid he won't be able to keep up!

349
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,400
We'll take Suzhou, and then Nanking!

350
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,700
What are they laughing at?

351
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,300
Nanking is the enemy's capital

352
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,700
To topple Nanking, we must first take Suzhou

353
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,700
Since they have nothing to
gain when the war is over...

354
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,700
they won't let us take Suzhou

355
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,900
If we attack, they can't stop us

356
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,400
The Kui army was precisely sent...

357
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,300
to keep an eye on us

358
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
They've returned!

359
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,000
Xiao-Wu

360
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,700
Xiao-Wu, Xiao-Wu...

361
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,000
Xiao-Wu's shoes...

362
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,100
Xiao-Wu...

363
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,900
Xiao-Qi?!

364
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:57,200
Xiao-Qi... my boys...

365
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,800
We were no longer bandits

366
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,700
He said a bandit kills for his own interests

367
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,900
But a hero sacrifices for others

368
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,900
I wanted to be a hero

369
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,000
You've lost weight

370
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,300
Big brother says,
we'll only be away for 3 years

371
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,500
I know you've never liked it here

372
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,200
When the war is over...

373
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,600
I'll find us a better place to settle down

374
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,100
Where's Brother Pang?

375
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,000
He's staying outside the village tonight

376
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,700
We'll leave tomorrow morning

377
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,900
Remember...

378
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,400
Winning is all that matters!

379
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,500
Begin!

380
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,800
Kill them!

381
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,700
We're here to take over

382
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,300
Give the men 3 days leave to pillage!

383
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,700
Let them take their money,
their food, their women!

384
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,000
You can come out now, the war is over

385
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,900
Come

386
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,000
Come, don't be afraid

387
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,200
Have you eaten?

388
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,300
You hungry?

389
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,900
Let go!

390
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,800
What are you doing?!

391
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Don't just stay there! Give me a hand!

392
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,100
No!

393
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,500
Don't touch me!

394
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
Gouzi, I'm leaving!

395
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,000
Let me go...

396
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,100
Brother Pang

397
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,700
- Move!
- What is it?

398
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,800
Why am I being arrested?

399
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,900
- Go!
- What is it?!

400
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,500
Gather the people for a public execution!

401
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,900
Brother Zhao!

402
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,300
Brother, what's this about?

403
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,700
They raped 2 women

404
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,300
They were given three days of pillage,
this was bound to happen!

405
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,000
From this day on, I will not tolerate
such conduct under my command!

406
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,700
It's what we've always done

407
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,300
We're soldiers now, not bandits

408
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,100
We must better ourselves or
we won't achieve anything!

409
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,600
If we allow this to happen...

410
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,000
we're no better than those Kui bastards!

411
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,500
Today is the day we start
setting down some rules!

412
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,600
We've just killed their families!

413
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,900
Now you want to protect them?

414
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,700
By killing our own?

415
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,600
No one will risk their lives
fighting for you after this!

416
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,200
Brother...

417
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,900
Listen to me, look at them!

418
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,700
They've learned their lesson

419
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,600
There's no need to kill them, right?

420
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,900
Don't just kneel there!

421
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,400
Say you're sorry!

422
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,000
Big brother, we were wrong, we're so sorry...

423
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,100
Gouzi!

424
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,800
Say it again!

425
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,500
Gouzi, say you're sorry!

426
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,200
Say it!

427
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,100
Come on, Gouzi...

428
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,100
Big brother, we're sorry!

429
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,000
Big brother, they know they're wrong

430
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,200
Have mercy

431
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,200
When I was still a civil servant...

432
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,200
I saw a soldier...

433
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,400
beating a peasant on the street...

434
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,900
...until the man was
covered with his own blood

435
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,500
There was no reason for it...

436
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,000
except that the man was poor

437
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,100
But the poor man never retaliated

438
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,400
He accepted it as part of his lot in life

439
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,100
I promised myself that day...

440
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,300
I would never allow...

441
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,600
something like that to happen again!

442
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,700
You joined the army...

443
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,800
because you don't want to be bullied

444
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,400
Let me tell you

445
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,300
not only you but everyone...

446
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,400
men and women alike should
be free from oppression!

447
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,100
That's what we're fighting for!

448
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,700
That day...

449
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,400
he finally revealed his dream
for the future

450
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,600
He said...

451
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,000
he waited because he was afraid

452
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,600
we wouldn't understand

453
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,000
But I did
Stop!

454
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,800
Don't you touch my men!

455
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,300
Back off!

456
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,700
Brother...

457
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,200
Please...

458
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,400
Who do you owe your lives to?

459
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,100
Who?!

460
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,800
Big brother!

461
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,300
What will you tell my mother?

462
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,900
Closes your eyes

463
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,800
I'll be quick

464
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,800
Brother Jiang... What will you tell my mother?

465
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,300
Don't tell my mother!

466
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,600
How I wish I could sacrifice my life...

467
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,900
for this future of his

468
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,300
I used to think...

469
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,300
we only kill to survive

470
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,400
Now I see that...

471
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,600
we must also kill in order to do good

472
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,900
We must end this war in 3 months

473
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,300
We must take Suzhou!

474
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,500
Look! The abandoned!

475
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,000
You're behaving like Pang -

476
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
too ambitious

477
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,800
Thinks he can take Suzhou
with a few thousand men?

478
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,700
I'm worried for you, Lord Chen

479
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,500
With no supplies or reinforcements...

480
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,000
He's dead for sure!

481
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,100
There's a fine line between winning
and losing

482
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,500
If I add the right piece... here

483
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:55,200
Pang might just climb to the top...

484
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,200
and then...

485
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,500
Do you think I'd let Pang
return to the fold?

486
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,900
Leaving him stranded...

487
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,800
benefits everyone

488
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,500
"Suzhou City, One Year Later"

489
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,400
I saved you once in Ji-An...

490
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,900
you ungrateful bastard!

491
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,100
What's keeping all of you?!

492
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,300
Suzhou is at an impasse;

493
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,500
both sides will starve to death

494
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,700
The Kui army are waiting
to swoop like vultures!

495
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,000
How much longer can you afford to gamble?

496
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,100
Butcher...

497
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,300
sing me a song

498
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,500
I heard that...

499
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,200
there is a man named Jesus

500
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,200
Each day at noon...

501
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,300
He gives the Taiping general Huang
in Suzhou...

502
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,900
5 loaves of bread and 2 fat pigs

503
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,000
He would then divide the food casually...

504
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,800
and somehow he feeds all 5000 people...

505
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,800
Everyone is fed

506
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,300
Their bread never runs out

507
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:09,800
And new piglets are being born everyday

508
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,000
Sit down!

509
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,500
Sit down!

510
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,000
I'll steal into the city and kill Huang

511
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,300
Those who tried never came back

512
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,100
I won't put more lives at risk

513
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,300
I'll go ask Lord Di...

514
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,900
for food and weapons

515
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:04,800
But we've defied their
orders by attacking Suzhou

516
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,600
I'm still of some use to them

517
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,600
Please leave now

518
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:27,400
Give me provisions and I'll seize Suzhou!

519
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,700
My men may die in battles but not from hunger!

520
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,800
Please, I beg you!

521
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,900
My lord says he didn't know Suzhou was at war

522
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,000
To the Kui army!

523
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,800
We can't go begging to them!

524
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,500
Then I will go alone!

525
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,800
Let's go!

526
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,700
Quick!

527
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,100
Hurry...

528
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,600
Take my hand!

529
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,000
They tried to steal into the city;

530
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,600
they all said there was food inside

531
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,100
I must go in for myself

532
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,600
Give me provisions and weapons...

533
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,100
I'll make you a deal

534
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,200
I don't need that

535
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,200
Suzhou is already mine

536
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,600
I'm talking about...

537
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,000
Nanking

538
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,800
My men do the fighting and the dying!

539
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,700
All you have to do is stand behind us

540
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,800
We divide Nanking between us;

541
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,000
we enter the city together...

542
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,100
unless you want to be under

543
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,500
the power of those three old men forever

544
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,400
We must capture Nanking...

545
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,000
before the Kui army arrives to take credit

546
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,700
But we only have 10 days' supplies

547
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,300
We act quickly

548
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,900
We capture Suzhou within 2 days!

549
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,900
The heavens are good to me...

550
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,600
sending you to me tonight

551
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,700
It can protect you

552
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,600
If you don't see a red flare
by dawn from inside the city...

553
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,300
my men will take you to safety

554
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,400
Tell big brother and Wu-Yang that...

555
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,500
Er-Hu wanted to be a hero

556
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,800
General Pang is back!

557
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:17,200
Sir, the provisions have arrived!

558
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,000
General Zhao has entered the city

559
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,900
He said if we see a red flare by dawn...

560
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,900
it means he has succeeded

561
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,400
My friend, did you bring the goods?

562
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,000
They say we have food in the city

563
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,400
But we may start eating each other soon

564
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,400
I promised they would be clothed and fed...

565
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,300
and could go home within 3 years

566
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,200
It's been 5 years now...

567
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,500
We attack at dawn

568
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,100
Lian

569
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,600
I like to study different faces...

570
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,900
but I haven't seen a new face...

571
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,000
since Suzhou came under siege a year ago

572
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,700
I hear the opium dealer is a new face

573
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:16,400
but I don't use opium anymore

574
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,500
it only eases the pain

575
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:27,200
My wife's grave is just
outside the city in the woods

576
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,800
I long to see her...

577
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,700
but can't

578
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,700
Do you know what it's like to be a prisoner?

579
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,300
Suzhou has become one big prison...

580
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:52,000
I can't get out...

581
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,600
you can't get in either...

582
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,700
unless...

583
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,700
I let you in

584
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,400
Remember Shi?

585
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,800
You joined the Qing army, he followed me

586
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,400
Hurry!

587
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,400
Sir... it's past dawn

588
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,800
Prepare the horses

589
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,600
Escort Lady Zhao away

590
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,200
Er-hu said that...

591
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,000
he wanted to be a hero

592
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,600
If I survive, I will...

593
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,200
marry you

594
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,000
4,000 soldiers are outside crazed with starvation

595
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,600
If you kill me...

596
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:38,200
you will all die in a blood bath

597
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,500
I too have 4,000 men

598
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:44,300
They'll defend every inch of the city...

599
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,500
to their last drop of blood

600
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,900
Stand down

601
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,000
Lay down your arms

602
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,200
Please surrender!

603
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,200
11 years ago...

604
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:24,900
I closed my business and sold everything...

605
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,300
to join the Taiping rebellion

606
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,900
From that day on...

607
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:34,600
the word "surrender"...

608
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,200
no longer existed for me!

609
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:26,600
As long as I live...

610
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,800
the people of Suzhou City...

611
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,200
will never be free

612
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Spare my soldiers... let them go home

613
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:48,900
Don't make the civilians suffer

614
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,700
May you...

615
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,100
go in peace!

616
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,900
Get ready!

617
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:09,600
Er-Hu... Er-Hu...!

618
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,600
Zhao Er-Hu!

619
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,100
I want to see Zhao Er-Hu!

620
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,700
We want bread! Bread!

621
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,500
Are we going to conscript them?

622
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,800
They will never agree

623
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,100
There are 4,000 captives

624
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,700
How much of our food will you give them?

625
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,300
Brother...

626
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,100
They surrendered only because...

627
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,100
I promised to let them live

628
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,200
The city's granaries are empty, and...

629
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,600
we have only a 10-day supply of food

630
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,500
We must save it for Nanking

631
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,400
Nanking?

632
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,800
Are we attacking Nanking?

633
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,200
The Kui army decamped yesterday;

634
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,000
they will attack Nanking at any moment

635
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:49,900
I can't read!

636
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,300
Just tell me where the supplies are from?

637
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,400
Where?!

638
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,500
The Kui army

639
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,300
How could you make a deal with He Kui?!

640
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,400
These solders will never join our army

641
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,000
If we attack Nanking...

642
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,700
Suzhou will be defenseless

643
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,700
Can you leave the city in their hands?

644
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:06,800
Listen to me!

645
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:07,900
No, you listen!

646
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,600
These soldiers are our enemies!

647
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:14,700
We want bread! Bread!

648
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,600
Open the stores!

649
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,600
Give me what I need

650
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,400
No!

651
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,200
Pang Qing-Yun!

652
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,000
I knew you were a liar!

653
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,600
This bread...

654
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,600
was meant for our brothers

655
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,000
But you want to give half to the captives...

656
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,100
and then the other half to the civilians

657
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,800
Our brothers have fought for 9 months...

658
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,300
and starved for 9 months!

659
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:01,600
You tell me...

660
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,400
Who should get this bread, them or us?

661
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,300
I don't care!

662
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,000
Give them food!

663
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,700
Now!!!

664
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,500
Let them eat

665
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,600
It's their last meal

666
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,400
But I promised to spare their lives!

667
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,100
Winning is all that matters in war!

668
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,800
A man who breaks his word is an animal!

669
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,800
Brother...

670
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,300
He's right

671
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,400
Move!

672
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,600
He's right

673
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:45,000
Get out of the way!

674
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,800
He's right

675
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:57,800
Let me go!

676
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:05,100
Let me go! I promised to spare their lives!

677
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,400
Archers!

678
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:32,600
Quiet!

679
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,800
Don't kill them!

680
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,300
Again!

681
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:27,900
Again!

682
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,500
Again!

683
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,900
Don't kill them! Don't kill them!

684
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:01,100
Again!

685
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,300
From that day on...

686
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,400
Er-Hu never said another word to me

687
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,300
It hurts, but...

688
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:17,600
big brother was right

689
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,500
Let's go home!

690
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,000
Who's with me?

691
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:51,600
Er-Hu, you can't go

692
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,900
We still have to take Nanking

693
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,000
What for? To kill more defenseless people?

694
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,600
They were soldiers

695
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,500
They surrendered!

696
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,000
They were still soldiers!

697
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,300
Do you remember what you said to us?

698
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,700
You said everyone deserves...

699
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:10,300
to be free even the poor!

700
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:13,300
What have you done now?

701
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,200
You have ordered right here...

702
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,400
the massacre of 4,000 poor people?!
You know that?!

703
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,500
Only the poor are willing to go to war!

704
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:23,700
Which one of us weren't poor!

705
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,200
Those men were soldiers

706
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,000
Soldiers are prepared to die

707
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:35,600
But the millions in Nanking are civilians

708
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,600
If He Kui reaches them first, they're dead!

709
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:44,900
I need your help to take Nanking

710
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,000
Please don't go

711
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:51,400
If you go, it will be mutiny

712
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:54,200
The Shan brothers will turn on each other!

713
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,800
Think about the consequences!

714
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:58,600
Don't force my hand!

715
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,400
I'll kill anyone who touches Er-Hu!

716
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:09,300
Brother, you must not leave

717
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:15,500
If you leave now...
ours pledge will be broken

718
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,000
Er-Hu!

719
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,300
The Kui army has already left

720
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,800
We must leave now or we'll be too late!

721
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,400
I promise you...

722
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,600
after Nanking...

723
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,200
there'll be peace

724
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,000
One day you'll see that...

725
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,200
my decisions today were right

726
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,600
Fine

727
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,500
I'll be watching you in Nanking

728
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,600
If you're right, I'll kneel before you

729
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,100
But if you're wrong, I'll kill you

730
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,600
Let's go!

731
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,400
We...

732
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,900
- Zhao Er-Hu...
- Pang Qing-Yun...

733
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:19,500
- Jiang Wu-Yang...
- three brothers as one...

734
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,200
Attack!

735
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:50,000
Victory is ours, Nanking is ours!

736
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Long live the Empress Dowager!

737
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:59,300
One month after the capture of Nanking

738
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:36,200
Go in peace

739
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,300
We swore an oath...

740
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:44,400
to remain loyal to the Shan regiment

741
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:48,600
As long as there is hunger, oppression...

742
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,100
and injustice...

743
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:56,200
the Shan regiment will fight!

744
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,800
Dole out the wages!

745
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,800
Zhang Wen-Fang, 5 taels

746
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,100
Wang Xiao-San...

747
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,400
Er-Hu, what are you doing?!

748
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:14,100
The money belongs to the imperial coffers!

749
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:19,300
We agreed to take Nanking and
give half of the spoils to our men

750
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:23,300
If you won't do it! I will!

751
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,400
Remember!

752
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,500
The Shan regiment has only one leader!

753
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,500
And that's General Pang!

754
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:39,600
Show him your gratitude!

755
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,700
Thank you General!

756
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,100
Again!

757
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:47,700
Thank you General!!!

758
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,700
Back to the wages...

759
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:54,200
Wang Xiao-San, 3 taels 4 mace

760
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,300
Wang Long, 4 taels

761
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,100
My lord

762
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:08,500
He needed your help to take Nanking

763
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:11,200
Now you're at his mercy

764
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,100
I will kill him eventually!

765
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:15,000
You're always a step behind

766
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,200
The Empress is making
him Governor of Jiangsu

767
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,300
So what?

768
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:22,500
He Kiu, even I can't help you this time

769
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:25,300
We just need to get Zhao Er-Hu on our side...

770
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,700
and Pang's downfall is ensured!

771
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:31,200
- Zhao Er-Hu... - Pang Qing-Yun...
- Jiang Wu-Yang...

772
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:34,700
three brothers as one...

773
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,100
Drink up!

774
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:49,800
Heaven and earth be our witnesses

775
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:57,000
We take a blood oath, pledge our lives

776
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:05,500
We were born apart but die as one

777
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,900
Loyalty through good times...

778
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:34,900
and bad

779
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,800
General Zhao, you did the fighting

780
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,500
but he took the credit

781
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:24,600
How can you live with that?

782
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,700
So what?

783
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:31,100
This opera is about brotherhood

784
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:35,200
He's your brother, yet he had you in chains?

785
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:39,000
He forced you to break your
word and made a fool out of you

786
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,600
Make him pay

787
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,600
If we join forces and Nanking can be ours

788
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:50,000
Give it some thought

789
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
General He is only thinking of your future

790
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:58,500
Come over here!

791
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:20,700
Revenge is sweet!

792
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,800
Shallow wounds heal...

793
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,100
but deep wounds fester

794
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:31,300
General Zhao, take your time to think it over

795
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,600
General He

796
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,100
You must be wondering...

797
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:02,100
how long it takes to get from the gates to here?

798
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:05,500
I had the same thought the first time...

799
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,700
I stood outside the palace gates

800
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:10,600
By the time I reached this far...

801
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,100
my hair had already turned gray

802
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:18,200
it took me 30 years

803
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:22,100
Now I'm too old to walk

804
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:25,800
Li Lianying

805
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:40,800
The Empress said your youth is an asset;

806
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,100
you will serve us for a long time

807
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:46,600
The Empress also said

808
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:49,900
Pang should be commended
for the capture of Nanking

809
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:53,200
He will receive the Golden Robes

810
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:58,200
and appointed Governor of Jiangsu!

811
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,400
Show your gratitude!

812
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,100
Your servant Pang requests that...

813
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:10,000
the people of Jiangsu be
exempt from 3 years of taxes

814
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,900
to recover from the war

815
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:20,800
Request granted!

816
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,400
Thank you your Highness

817
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,800
You're responsible for the Suzhou massacre...

818
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:32,800
yet you saved the people of Nanking

819
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,500
Lord Pang, you're surely adaptable

820
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:41,700
The Empress favors Lord Pang because

821
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:44,400
he does not belong to any fractions

822
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,200
Nanking may be yours

823
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:49,600
But you've offended Lord Jiang
and He Kui along the way

824
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,800
Now, without allies...

825
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,800
how long do you think you'll last?

826
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,800
Lord Pang, I checked the lunar calendar

827
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,100
The 8th day of the 4th month...

828
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:05,200
will be the most auspicious
time for your inauguration

829
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,300
...and for all

830
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:08,300
Before you can do good...

831
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:11,600
Lord Pang, you must look after yourself!

832
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,400
You must look after yourself

833
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:19,600
I must leave now, My lords

834
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:22,200
The unrest has subsided,

835
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:27,000
but the local militias wield too much power

836
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:33,500
Lord Pang, the Empress is concerned

837
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,800
The Shan regiment will be the first to disband

838
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,000
Good!

839
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,900
Once you sever your old ties...

840
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:46,600
you can devote yourself
to your duties as governor

841
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:51,400
Your brother Zhao Er-Hu
threatened to desert the army in Suzhou

842
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,200
He almost created...

843
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,300
a mutiny there

844
01:39:55,300 --> 01:40:00,300
In Nanking, he doled out funds
meant for the royal coffers

845
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:03,000
Does he own your regiment?!

846
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:20,200
Be careful, my lord!

847
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:25,400
I've walked on thin ice my whole life

848
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,800
Do you think I can safely cross over?

849
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,800
You're awake

850
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,500
Yes, I am

851
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:19,700
Perhaps they're right

852
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,000
Nanking...

853
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,700
doesn't need someone like me

854
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,100
I want to go home

855
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,900
Will you come with me?

856
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,500
I don't need this anymore

857
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,800
What is it?

858
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,400
Bad news, my lord!

859
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:05,200
He Kui plans to assassinate Lord Pang!

860
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,100
It's nothing

861
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:11,500
General Zhao

862
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,200
Big brother!

863
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:13,900
General Zhao

864
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,300
Big brother!

865
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,400
General Zhao

866
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,300
Where's he?

867
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:21,800
Lord Pang has not returned
from the imperial court

868
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:34,200
Decided?

869
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:37,300
Then I'm off

870
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,100
General Jiang

871
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,000
General Jiang

872
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:52,600
Who are they?

873
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,500
Guards sent by the imperial court

874
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:57,600
Cover that table with the red cloth

875
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,400
Move these vases as well

876
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:01,800
Hurry!

877
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,700
- Brother Wu Yang
- You have guests coming?

878
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:06,300
General Pang has invited General Zhao to dine

879
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:07,800
They've reconciled!

880
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,200
Is big brother home?

881
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,400
He should return by the afternoon...

882
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:14,700
why have they replaced all the guards?

883
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,200
General Zhao, wait!

884
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,200
Sir...

885
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:27,000
We received news that...

886
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,500
He Kui plans to assassinate Lord Pang

887
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,000
He must not return to the city now

888
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,600
he asked you to meet him at Jianpu

889
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,800
Tell Wu-Yang to bring
the others and meet us there

890
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,600
Wu-Yang

891
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,300
Where's Er-Hu?

892
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:01,200
He...

893
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,300
went to see Brother Pang

894
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:01,700
You're up to something!

895
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,900
What's with all those new guards?

896
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,700
You're going to kill Er-Hu...

897
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,500
all because of Lian?!

898
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,400
Have you forgotten our pledge?!

899
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:19,900
When will Er-Hu arrive?

900
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,100
Tell me when!

901
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,600
Nightfall...

902
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,500
He'll be here by nightfall

903
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:31,000
Wait for me!

904
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:09,800
You scared me

905
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,800
Lian, I'm here to say goodbye

906
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:18,000
Are you leaving?

907
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,800
No, you are

908
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:24,100
But where to?

909
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,800
I'm waiting for Er-Hu...

910
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,300
I've just prepared dinner

911
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:35,800
Big brother is going to kill Er-Hu over you

912
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:40,500
No, it can't be!

913
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:45,900
Come down here

914
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,000
No

915
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:52,400
I have to finish draping this frame

916
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,300
Have you ever seen such beautiful fabric?

917
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:59,800
I haven't seen one in years

918
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,000
I saw the red one in a shop yesterday...

919
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:06,900
but I also wanted the green one

920
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:08,800
I asked Er-Hu what to do

921
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,500
He said...

922
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,500
green for this year and red for the next

923
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,900
I'll be 29 next year

924
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:18,600
I lived through 14 years of war...

925
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:20,500
didn't starve to death or get killed

926
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:21,800
I've been lucky!

927
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,600
I still have to hang the red curtain next year

928
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,400
I still have to hang the red curtain next year

929
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,600
Come down!

930
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:40,400
You wouldn't kill me... I won't let you!

931
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:41,900
It wasn't easy for me to survive!

932
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:43,700
Why must you kill me?

933
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:47,800
If I don't kill you... how will I save Er-Hu?

934
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:53,400
Can you really save him by killing me?

935
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:54,800
I don't know...

936
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:57,800
but it's all I can do

937
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:00,900
I watched you grow up

938
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:04,500
You wouldn't do it... You won't!

939
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:08,000
I know you can't kill me...

940
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:08,900
You wouldn't do it...

941
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:10,600
Anyone who harms our brothers...

942
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:12,300
You can't kill me!

943
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:14,300
must be...

944
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:16,200
killed!

945
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,200
5 years ago...

946
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:51,000
108 men left their village to join the army...

947
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:54,600
risking their lives for a little food

948
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:59,700
They were the first to join the Shan army

949
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:04,000
The three of us were their leaders

950
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:16,100
Today, I found a good place to free you

951
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,500
I told you...

952
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:25,600
there will come a day when
you'll see that I was right

953
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:38,200
Each year at this time, I'll drink with you

954
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:41,600
I'll tell you what I've done in the past year

955
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,300
I just returned from the palace

956
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:02,900
The people of Jiangsu have been...

957
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:06,800
spared from taxes for 3 years

958
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:11,200
Next year, I promise...

959
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,500
no one will go hungry

960
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:17,500
You'll understand eventually

961
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:21,100
that Xiao-Qi and Gouzi...

962
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:23,700
didn't die in vain...

963
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:26,900
and the massacre of the 4000 captives...

964
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:31,300
was necessary

965
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:35,800
And you...

966
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:41,200
You...

967
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:47,000
You will not die in vain

968
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:51,200
You defied my orders in Suzhou

969
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:54,400
I could have killed you then,

970
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:57,300
but I couldn't do it

971
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,800
But now it's the imperial court...

972
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:05,200
that wants you dead

973
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:09,100
What choice do I have?

974
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:21,600
My brother...

975
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,400
go in peace

976
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:28,500
Brother...

977
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:48,700
Big brother, you don't need to kill Er-Hu!

978
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:50,800
Brother!

979
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,200
Brother!

980
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,500
you don't need to kill Er-Hu!

981
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,100
Lian is dead!

982
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,500
You don't have to kill Er-Hu!

983
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:12,800
Lian is already dead...

984
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:17,000
no reason to kill Er-Hu now!

985
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,100
Brother!

986
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,500
Lian is dead!

987
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:25,200
The gods bless this day

988
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:27,400
Joining the ranks of those that went before...

989
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:29,200
a great servant to the empire

990
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:31,600
To lead by example and serve his people

991
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:37,300
The inauguration of Pang Qing-Yun
as Governor of Jiangsu will take place...

992
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:41,500
at noon on this day, the 8th of the 4th month

993
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,600
A fence needs three pillars

994
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:39,800
It's not the same without Lord Jiang here

995
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:04,400
A quarter to 12

996
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:29,500
Stand down!

997
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:33,100
A brother who harms another brother...

998
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,600
must die!

999
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,200
A brother who harms another brother must die

1000
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:28,400
It's time

1001
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,100
Don't push me!

1002
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:56,400
A brother who harms another brother...

1003
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,000
must die!

1004
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:34,500
Wu-Yang!

1005
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:43,000
I beg you stop!

1006
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:49,200
A brother who harms another brother must die

1007
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:47,200
Pang Qing-Yun!

1008
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:06,200
Pang has talent

1009
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:08,600
but doesn't know how things work

1010
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:12,400
Nanking is of vital importance

1011
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:15,100
to the peace of the country

1012
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:18,700
The Empress would never entrust it
to an outsider

1013
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:22,700
Pity... such is life

1014
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:26,900
Noon is here! Salute cannons, fire!

1015
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:12,000
Honor our pledge...

1016
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,600
now!

1017
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:38,400
I, Jiang Wu-Yang, killed Pang Qing-Yun!

1018
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:50,200
At that moment...

1019
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:53,700
My mind went back to
the day we took the blood oath

1020
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:58,300
We are born apart but we shall die as one

1021
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:07,150
Our origins are different...

1022
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:11,900
but our hearts act as one

1023
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:16,600
In good times and bad, in life and in death

1024
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:20,700
We honor our pledge

1025
02:02:27,870 --> 02:02:30,290
Governor of Jiangsu, Pang Qing-Yun...

1026
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:34,200
was assassinated on the 26th of July, 1870.

1027
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:39,300
His assassin Jiang Wu-Yang
was executed 2 months later.
