00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,092
<i>Gaming and tourism</i>
<i>has been cold</i>

2
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:02,127
<i>for the entire month</i>

3
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,465

4
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,548
<i>A diet Pepsi, please.</i>

5
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:36,395
Thank you.

6
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,493
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

7
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:08,894
The roulette pit
was a zoo tonight.

8
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,597
Two Haitians got drunk,
one of them

9
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,533
- tried to urinate on me...
- Let's get out of here.

10
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,768
Doris, I just arrived.

11
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,507
I picked this place 'cause it's
deserted, you know? We can think.

12
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,910
This is our future
we're talkin' about now.

13
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:27,312
Sweetheart, I don't
mean to pressure you,

14
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,182
but the Caesars people
have offered me

15
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,584
a roulette pit of my own
in Atlantic City.

16
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,319
That's a big break.

17
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,555
And tomorrow's my deadline
for telling them yes or no,

18
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,690
so you gotta tell me tonight.

19
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,860
Will you come with me?

20
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,696
That's not what you mean
when you say, "come with me"

21
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:48,700
You mean, "Come live with me,
then love me, then marry me"

22
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,904
Yes, and have children.
Is that so awful?

23
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:54,273
Come on, Osgood, I've
been married three times.

24
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,841
I suck at it.

25
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:59,578
- You just haven't found...
- <i> Let's dance.</i>

26
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,246
You and me, just you and me.
Come on.

27
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,881
- I don't want to dance.
- We're talking here.

28
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,816
Alright?

29
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,219
- Let's go, come on.
- Hey, hey!

30
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:10,556
- Excuse me!
- Let go! Let go!

31
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,925
Look, buddy, I don't think
you want to make me mad.

32
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,294
I don't care what games
you two want to play...

33
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:17,896
That's twice now you've touched her.
Don't do it again!

34
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:21,600
I won't touch her again...
until she asks me.

35
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,438
I got one question.

36
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,840
Is it alright if I touch you?

37
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,310
- Ay, Osgood!
- Oh, dear, look at...

38
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,711
Give me that!

39
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,580
- I fuckin' knew it.
- Give me that!

40
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:36,248
- Hey!
- All you gotta do is come and get it.

41
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,482
It's mine and I want it.

42
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,851
God damn it,
be careful with that!

43
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,787
- Come on, let's go. Take me out of here.
- That cost a lot of money,

44
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,622
- I had it made special.
- Fuck the money, Osgood!

45
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,824
Osgood?

46
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,993
No one's got a fuckin'
name like Osgood.

47
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,295
- Jesus.
- Son of a bitch.

48
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,931
Come on. Let's go,
I'm scared.

49
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,733
- <i> Who the fuck's</i> got a name like Osgood?
- You don't have to be scared.

50
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,935
I can't help it.
That guy...

51
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,904
- I could've handled him.
- You don't want this?

52
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,307
<i>- I know.</i>
- Is it house trained?

53
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,845
God damn it!

54
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,583
I try to behave
like a gentleman, Doris.

55
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:15,454
I really do, you know, but there's
an animal side to everybody.

56
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,623
You think less of me,
don't you? For walking out.

57
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,024
Please, how can you
even say that?

58
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,026
I was the one who dragged
you out of there.

59
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,595
I say that 'cause
I think it's the truth.

60
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,933
- Osgood.
- No, no, no! Walk me to the car, please.

61
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:31,670
Come back! Come over
here, mate.

62
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,938
<i>I'll brought your hamster back!</i>

63
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,408
Ozzie, wozzie, wozzie.

64
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,644
- <i> Osgood.</i>
<i>- </i> God damn it!

65
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:40,779
That's enough!

66
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,715
Hey, look, I don't
want this no more.

67
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,384
I wouldn't know
what to feed it.

68
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,619
<i>Osgood,</i> come back!

69
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,656
<i>Osgood, please!</i>

70
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,728
Oops.

71
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,831
- Move back.
- Move back, why?

72
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,901
Safety precaution, let's say.

73
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,870
I don't need no tricks

74
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:08,740
to deal with a peewee
shrimp fag like you.

75
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,909
All I need is my hands.

76
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,758
- <i> Osgood...</i>
- Shut up!

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,996
- But I...
- Close your god damn mouth, Doris.

78
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,831
<i>No one is leaving</i>
<i>till it's over,</i>

79
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,401
and it isn't over
till you say it is.

80
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,374
It's over.

81
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:45,677
Help me up, okay?

82
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,646
You know what you are, pal?

83
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:51,550
You're a coward,
and your breath stinks!

84
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,792
No, no, I'm a mess.
I'm a mess.

85
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,961
You're my own little hero.

86
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,786
<i>Coming through, coming through!</i>

87
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,958
<i>- Drew, what happened?</i>
- Found her in the parking lot.

88
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,894
She's in and out.
Stand clear.

89
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,629
<i>Can you tell me your name?</i>

90
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,667
Nick...

91
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,750
<i>Do you have any allergies?</i>

92
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,906
Tell me who did this to you.
Who did this to you?

93
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,642
Sweetheart, can you tell me
who did this to you?

94
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:07,078
Nick...

95
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,182
Nick...

96
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,618
Nick.

97
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,859
<i>Well, I never thought</i>
<i>you'd make it in, huh?</i>

98
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:04,095
Isn't this the 5,000th morning
in the Athens of America?

99
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,031
Five fuckin'
thousandth morning.

100
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,899
How you survivin'?

101
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,269
Eh, you know.

102
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,704
Here.

103
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,240
- Nut mail?
- It looks like it.

104
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,841
I'm not up to it, Pinky.

105
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,411
Read it to me.

106
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,813
Alright.

107
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:24,683
Let the games begin.

108
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,317
How about... aha.

109
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,788
<i>Mr. Wild, how can I become
a mercenary like you?</i>

110
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,090
<i>If someone were hypothetically
interested</i>

111
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,359
<i>in creating a small explosion,</i>

112
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,462
<i>how would one hypothetically</i>
<i>research such a thing</i>

113
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,265
<i>without leaving a computer trail
Thanks.</i>

114
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:44,069
<i>P.S. This is research for a
hypothetical screenplay.</i>

115
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,205
Hypothetically,
I wouldn't answer this guy.

116
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,940
Great advice, Pinky.

117
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,945
Oh, good morning.

118
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,181
Pinchus Zion, attorney-at-law.

119
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,718
- How can I help you?
- Cyrus Kinnick, looking for a Nick Wild.

120
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,489
He's right behind you.

121
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:07,759
<i>Nick?</i>
<i>This is Cyrus Kinnick.</i>

122
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:08,960
Thank you.

123
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,129
Hello, Mr. Wild.

124
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,364
<i>I was thinking of hitting</i>
<i>the casino tonight.</i>

125
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,966
I wish I could help you, pal.

126
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,835
You gotta be 21.
They'll lose their license.

127
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,203
I'm 23 years old,

128
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,038
but my youthful appearance
is one of the reasons

129
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,840
why I believe
I need a bodyguard.

130
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,108
May I be frank?

131
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,511
Grab a seat.

132
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,083
I looked you up on an online guide
to Vegas but you weren't in it.

133
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,786
That bothers me.

134
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:38,089
See, I'm a
considerable gambler,

135
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,491
if that isn't being
too boastful

136
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,326
and safety means much to me.

137
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,194
I checked under every
synonym for safety,

138
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,363
but there was no Nick Wild.

139
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,399
Well, you should've tried between
"chapels" and "charm schools"

140
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,835
<i>I don't want to be too
boastful either, Mr. Kinnick,</i>

141
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,205
but you're talking to the only
chaperone in all of Nevada.

142
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:58,309
See, now, I'm confused. I was
referred to you by an ex-client.

143
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,345
He was a neighbor
of mine in Boston.

144
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,113
<i>I simply took him</i>
<i>off his advice,</i>

145
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,115
<i>but now I fear you</i>
<i>may be too jocular.</i>

146
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,152
Could you tell me
about yourself?

147
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:10,021
You mean, you want
my qualifications?

148
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,791
Along those lines.

149
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,260
Along those lines.

150
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,432
Well, I've been knocked down,
blown up, lied to, shit on,

151
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,901
and shot at.

152
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,569
So nothing surprises
me much anymore,

153
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,938
except the things that
people do to each other.

154
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,376
I'm a licensed pilot,
took karate in Tokyo.

155
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,545
I lectured
on economics at Yale.

156
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:34,913
I can memorize the front pages

157
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,381
of the New York Times
in five minutes

158
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,483
<i>and repeat it back</i>
<i>to you in five weeks.</i>

159
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,986
I was the National Golden Gloves
champion three years in a row.

160
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,822
I'm fluent in four languages

161
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,824
and can wrestle with
a menu in five more...

162
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,859
- Jesus!
- Don't interrupt me. There's more.

163
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,861
- More?
- Yeah.

164
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,363
I lie a lot.

165
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,078
I'm staying
at Caesars, Mr. Wild.

166
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,213
Shall we say 7:00?

167
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,250
7:00, Mr. Kinnick.

168
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,378
It worked, Nicky!

169
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,249
It fuckin' worked!
It really worked.

170
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,451
How could you be such
a bastard Os, huh?

171
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,620
You said I was a coward
and my breath was bad.

172
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:50,655
That's not an insult,
that's a fuckin' insult.

173
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,423
That was in character, man.

174
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,592
I'm fuckin' around.
You're too sensitive.

175
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,262
And you didn't tell me you were
gonna take my fuckin' hair.

176
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,163
What was that, man?

177
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,398
She likes you
better without it.

178
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,269
Heh, women, they like honesty.

179
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,905
Who knew?
Word to the wise.

180
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,474
Alright, fresh from the bank...

181
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:12,543
- one thousand dollars.
- That's not the right amount.

182
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,346
Are you callin' me a crook?
'Cause I am not a crook.

183
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,381
Nobody said you were.

184
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,016
You forgot the bonus, Nicky!

185
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,918
I said if she came along
out of pressure

186
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,520
I was putting on, fine.
Whatever. Done.

187
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,156
But if by seeing the real me,

188
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,926
it could bring out
that she loved me,

189
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:31,162
there'd be a
$500 bonus. $1,000.

190
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:34,465
And that's what happened?
She saw the real you?

191
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:38,202
She fuckin' loves me, man.

192
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:40,471
Love.

193
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:53,151
I'll take the $500, Os.

194
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,455
This day keeps gettin'
better and better.

195
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,095
I love you, man.
I mean, I love you.

196
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,596
Yeah!

197
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:09,100
<i>Hey, I'm gonna write you</i>
<i>from Atlantic City.</i>

198
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,569
It's where we'll all headed.
How you doin', Nick?

199
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,504
Oh, great, Rox.

200
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,309
So, I put Casanova
on table two like you asked.

201
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,678
I'll bet you give him the room
with the busted toilet.

202
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,014
Oh, yeah, I like that one.

203
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,149
<i>- I'm not wearing a ring.</i>
<i>- You wouldn't have known it.</i>

204
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,353
I stay with her on account of our
four kids and I can survive,

205
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,755
except when fate, through a
toilet that won't flush,

206
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:37,495
brings me in contact with a
special specimen like you.

207
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,031
- What'd I miss?
- The special specimen.

208
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,633
- Fuck!
- Shh, he's about to ask for a memory.

209
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,302
Okay, she's dead,
but she won't lie down.

210
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,004
Oh, she'll lie down.
She just doesn't realize

211
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,639
it's gonna happen
in five minutes.

212
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,509
<i>I could get a key</i>
<i>to a $1,000 suite.</i>

213
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,779
So please, Marie,
leave me with the memory.

214
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:58,149
Give me something
I can cherish to remember.

215
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,018
Okay.

216
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,687
Okay. Thank you.
Come on.

217
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,790
Son of a bitch! How does
he get fucked every time?

218
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,559
- What is that?
- Hey, he wants it that much.

219
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,328
Well, I don't have
anything like that.

220
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,130
- Do you?
- Sure.

221
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:14,665
Never ever to rest my head
on the same pillow twice.

222
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,434
- Well, travel costs.
- Tell me.

223
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:20,371
I need $500,000
to buy me five years.

224
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,674
Right now, I'm only
short $499,500.

225
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,810
- Well, luck will find you then.
- I know.

226
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,413
When it does, I'll grab
that fucker by the throat.

227
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:29,781
Yeah.

228
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,537
Oh, and hey, Nick?
Holly just called.

229
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,539
Said if you're not finished
with your grapefruit juice,

230
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,408
don't waste it.

231
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,656
<i>It's open.</i>

232
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,730
- <i> You want some coffee?</i>
- No.

233
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,732
<i>I just brewed it.</i>

234
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:26,170
<i>It's 100% Colombian,</i>
<i>it's right there on the table.</i>

235
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:29,572
Holly, if you're gonna hide, why couldn't
we have just talked on the phone?

236
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,612
<i>I just don't think I want</i>
<i>you seeing me like this.</i>

237
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,600
Hey, Nick.

238
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,217
You know, I kept calling out
for you in emergency.

239
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,356
The doctor says I kept saying
"Nick" over and over again.

240
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,759
They thought that you
were the one who...

241
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,197
Who did?

242
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,934
I don't know.

243
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,639
That's why I phoned you.

244
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,182
<i>So I had a date last night.</i>

245
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:47,218
When I left, I got
to the elevator

246
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,321
and the doors were opening
and it was going up.

247
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,652
There were three guys inside.

248
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,361
The young guy was the boss.

249
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,364
He spoke real strong,
like a fighter.

250
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,833
The two big guys
were his flunkies.

251
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:07,838
And the fighter says,
"Come on to the party"

252
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,875
And I said I was tired,
and he said,

253
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,578
"Hey, I'm too pretty
to turn down"

254
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,417
And he pulled me inside and...

255
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:24,555
We get to his suite,
I said, "Where's the party?"

256
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,662
And he says, "You're it"

257
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:35,333
<i>And he signals for the big
guys to go into the next room.</i>

258
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,568
<i>And he says, "Aren't
you the lucky bitch?"</i>

259
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,941
"You're the only girl in the world
tonight that gets to touch it"

260
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,748
<i>And he looks down</i>
<i>at himself and says,</i>

261
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,418
"The envy of all mankind"

262
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,330
Well, he did what he did.

263
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,738
And the big guys worked me over
real good on the service stairs.

264
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,307
And some hotel people,
they dumped me at Emergency.

265
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,757
Isn't $100 what you charge
for the first hour?

266
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,662
Today's my day
for turnin' down money.

267
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,024
What'd you wanna pay me for?

268
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,667
'Cause I wanna sue
his ass, Nicky.

269
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,969
You must hire a lawyer, Holly.
I'm not a lawyer.

270
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,071
I don't even know his name
or what room he was in

271
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,907
or any god damn thing
about him.

272
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:52,510
Then you must hire a detective, Holly.
I'm not a detective.

273
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,011
I don't know any god damn
detectives, Nick.

274
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:57,648
I know you,
and you know everybody.

275
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,418
I mean, how could
you not help me?

276
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,720
'Cause I'm gonna guess the three
gentlemen you talked about

277
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:05,022
were not IBM executives.

278
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,091
What hotel were you in?

279
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,095
The Golden Nugget.

280
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:13,431
Better and better.

281
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,066
A lot of people like it.

282
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:18,402
True, and so is this...

283
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,338
every high school student knows

284
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,972
there's no such thing as
organized crime in America.

285
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,442
<i>Every elementary school</i>
<i>student knows</i>

286
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,844
<i>that if organized crime</i>
<i>ever dreamt of invading,</i>

287
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,047
the last city they would
come to would be Vegas.

288
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,749
And every kindergarten
student knows

289
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,751
that if the mob ever
did to town,

290
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:37,121
the last hotel to be tainted
would be the Golden Nugget.

291
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:40,624
Shit, Holly, I mean,
even their fucking showgirls

292
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:41,959
can rip the phonebook in half.

293
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,862
Remember when I told you
not to go to that place?

294
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:51,453
You know what? You could
always piss me off, Holly.

295
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,606
<i>I'm leaving now.</i>

296
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,889
But I want us to be clear.

297
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,913
Holly, when I came
to this town,

298
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,149
you was just a kid who
lived across the street.

299
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:08,619
That first year, Baby himself tried
to recruit me for his organization.

300
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:11,522
I said no.

301
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,758
If someone got bloody, I wanted
it to be for my reasons,

302
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,992
not anybody else's.

303
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,129
Baby accepted that.

304
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,930
Since then I've stayed
away from them

305
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,732
and they stayed away from me.

306
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,871
I don't know a soul that
works at the Golden Nugget.

307
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,875
I don't have one contact there.

308
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,478
I swear to God.

309
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,521
Hey, Millicent.

310
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,491
I don't think they much
appreciate us having visitors.

311
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:24,128
Hey, listen, I'm interested in a
guy who looks like a fighter.

312
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,831
<i>Has a suite, I guess</i>
<i>on a high floor,</i>

313
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,566
travels with two
large bodyguards.

314
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:31,235
You still live in Naked City?

315
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,971
- You know Big Daddy's?
- Of course.

316
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,773
I get off at four.

317
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:38,576
You come down there
at about 4:15.

318
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:41,846
<i>If I ain't there,</i>
<i>I couldn't find nothin'.</i>

319
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:44,682
<i>If I am, we'll talk.</i>

320
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:50,254
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey, Millicent.

321
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:53,624
Too bad you got all that
British blood in you.

322
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:57,862
If you was black,
I'd bed you good and fast.

323
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,730
You could make believe.

324
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:03,000
Nah. Don't think this
is racial or anything,

325
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:06,136
but I never feel like
you people are clean.

326
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,939
This is a housekeeper
you're talking to, remember?

327
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:13,277
I can tell if a Brit's been
in a room, just like that.

328
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,613
Why should I think that
was racial or anything?

329
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:18,015
Glad you don't.

330
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:22,086
Now, this fighter guy,
his name is Danny DeMarco,

331
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:24,154
suite 3506.

332
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:27,191
He's from a fine old
Italian family back east.

333
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,894
He's a son and heir
and his daddy loves him

334
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:33,531
which is why he never goes no place
without them two big mothers.

335
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,533
How big are they?

336
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:36,767
A lot bigger than you.

337
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,772
You did me something once.

338
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:45,776
I will owe you forever.

339
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:48,913
But now, I need you
to do me something.

340
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:56,754
Do not fuck with these guys.

341
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,794
Pickle.

342
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,801
Lady in the housekeeping,
I just met with her.

343
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,671
She struck out, Holly.
Couldn't find out a thing.

344
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:17,074
Oh, Nick.
Don't lie anymore.

345
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,615
<i>You know what he did</i>
<i>when he was finished?</i>

346
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,930
He put a gun inside me.

347
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,357
<i>He said, "You got</i>
<i>one shot at breathing"</i>

348
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,399
<i>"Tell me you love me, and if I
believe you, I'll let you go"</i>

349
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,700
I said, "Oh, God, I love you"

350
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:45,970
"I love you so much,
I do"

351
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:50,007
And he said,
"Never shit a shitter"

352
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:52,329
And then he pulled the trigger.

353
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,379
And I scream

354
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:58,215
<i>and I hear a click.</i>

355
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:04,412
Some fucking games to play with
another human. Right, Nicky?

356
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:11,095
And I want to sue him,

357
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,964
<i>and you know who he is,</i>

358
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,733
and you just let him walk away.

359
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,368
<i>Just know I tried, Holly.</i>

360
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:23,340
Sure, you liar.
Just know this one thing.

361
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:26,243
All those times I told you
I cared for you...

362
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:27,878
Yeah, I know, I know.
You were lying.

363
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,882
Wrong. I loved you.

364
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,885
Every good thing
I ever said was true.

365
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:38,656
And when you hit bottom, who
climbed down there and found you?

366
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:41,358
- Only me.
- <i> Holly...</i>

367
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,066
Hey!

368
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:25,348
Sorry, made a wrong
turn back that way.

369
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,907
I am ready to see the sights.

370
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:32,209
Follow me,
Mr. Kinnick.

371
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,801
I hadn't realized these
places were so big.

372
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:33,170
Yeah, the noise
bothers people sometimes.

373
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:35,405
I don't mind the noise.

374
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:37,107
Golden Gate is much smaller.

375
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,176
It's just a short drive
down the block.

376
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,512
By all means.

377
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,960
This isn't as nice as some
of those other places.

378
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,996
Eh, tourist traps.

379
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,566
How did you get into
this line of work?

380
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,034
Special forces, am I right?

381
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,804
Trained to run around
all commando.

382
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:11,441
What were you?
SBS? SRR? SAS?

383
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,877
- Just "S"
- Just "S"

384
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,913
- "S" for special?
- "S" for shut your mouth.

385
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:18,081
It's not something
I'm getting into with you.

386
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,317
I can take care of things.
That's all you need to know.

387
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,020
That, and running around
"all commando"

388
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,588
isn't a preferred
military term.

389
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,990
Are you always so touchy?

390
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,496
Oh, hi, excuse me.

391
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,531
Can I get a Fiji water, please?

392
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,601
You knock the bottles over,
they don't roll away.

393
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:40,204
- Nicky?
- Vodka double.

394
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:43,240
In a square glass
so it doesn't roll away.

395
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:45,475
Mm.

396
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,245
Well, I am going to hit
the craps table.

397
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:50,314
The hundred dollar
tables are back there.

398
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:51,982
Yeah, but I can make
a greater number

399
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:54,484
of smaller bets
at the $10 tables.

400
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:56,353
Sounds like a winning system.

401
00:30:56,355 --> 00:31:00,090
- I got your back.
- Great.

402
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:01,625
I'd like to bet $10
on the shooter, please.

403
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:03,093
<i>Ten on the shooter, yes sir.</i>

404
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:05,229
Hey, Nick.

405
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,097
I've seen you happier.

406
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:09,166
How wrong you are, Cassandra.

407
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:12,102
This is the highlight
of my career.

408
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:14,571
- I'm protecting a Fiji drinker.
- Here we go!

409
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,241
<i>Big bet's $10 on a
single roll of the dice.</i>

410
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:20,077
What you see on
my face is ecstasy.

411
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,514
My shift's starting.

412
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,985
Yellow 11, that's it. Yellow
11 is the on line winner.

413
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:29,319
Winner's rolling hot.

414
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:42,266
<i>You know who he is</i>

415
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,501
<i>and you just let him walk away.</i>

416
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,143
We're quits, okay?

417
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,444
But I intend
on gambling for hours.

418
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:57,014
I don't have hours.

419
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,448
And you're safe in
the casino, Kinnick.

420
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,350
Nobody'll mug you
in the casino.

421
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:03,587
And outside they've got these
yellow things called taxis.

422
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,189
Just grab one and you'll
be back at Caesars

423
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:08,025
in half a minute.
Home and dry.

424
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:09,426
Goodbye, Kinnick.

425
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,677
His name's Danny DeMarco. He's
staying at the Golden Nugget.

426
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:29,112
Suite 3506.

427
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,249
- Good night, Holly.
- Wait.

428
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:35,218
- What?
- At least let me write it down.

429
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,322
Then write it down.

430
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:41,058
- <i> You know how to spell it?</i>
- No.

431
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,592
- What'd you say?
- <i> That's what I said.</i>

432
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:45,329
Good luck with your
fucking lawsuit, okay?

433
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:47,397
What are you so angry about?

434
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,566
- Liar!
- I'm not.

435
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:52,402
You never once intended suing the
son of a bitch, did you, sweetness?

436
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:55,072
<i>You'll see.</i>

437
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,207
I won't help you anymore.
I don't help liars.

438
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,276
- Quit calling me that.
- Quit doing it, then.

439
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,244
Would you help me?

440
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,480
- What kind of help could I give you?
- You know.

441
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,349
Yeah, I'd get killed.

442
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,584
- There's only three of them.
- Three of them with guns.

443
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,120
You gotta go in there and you gotta
soften them up so I can have my chance!

444
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:13,190
- Chance for what, Holly?
- I want his nuts in my hands!

445
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,160
And if they kill me?

446
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,330
I'll be miserable for days.

447
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,736
I want him so bad
for what he did to me.

448
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:28,038
I want my revenge, Nicky.

449
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,688
Yeah?

450
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,559
I'm here to see
Mr. DeMarco.

451
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,162
About?

452
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:26,663
It's personal.

453
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:29,566
Well, he's busy.

454
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,169
I don't think Baby is gonna be too
happy with me stuck out here.

455
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:34,137
I don't give a shit.

456
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,077
- Who was it?
- It was some guy.

457
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,240
Said he was a friend of Baby's.

458
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,548
Shit.

459
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,693
So you're a friend of Baby's?

460
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:54,291
- What's this about?
- A girl.

461
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,396
<i>You two get the fuck out.</i>

462
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:07,404
Hey, you kidding me?

463
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,712
- You searched him?
- Mm..hmm. Yup.

464
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:24,354
Sorry about that, Santy Claus.
Can't be too careful these days.

465
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,490
We should have a drink.
Any friend of Baby's...

466
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,758
It's good of you to see me
like this, Mr. DeMarco.

467
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,261
Danny. Call me Danny.

468
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:33,763
- What do I call you?
- Nick.

469
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:38,435
We'll, Nick, I'm told there's
something about a girl?

470
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:40,904
- Where is she?
- In my sled on the roof.

471
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:44,875
Oh, is she pretty?

472
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:48,245
- Was.
- Come again?

473
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:52,382
Last night a friend of mine was shown
some disrespect and I thought, you know,

474
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,584
maybe you might do something
to make things okay.

475
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:57,487
Oh, that.

476
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:02,425
We'll you see, Nick,
that wasn't disrespect.

477
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:05,595
That was a game.

478
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,364
We were having ourselves
a little party.

479
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:10,267
And what happened after
wasn't so nice either.

480
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:12,802
<i>She had to be stitched up</i>
<i>in Emergency.</i>

481
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:14,204
Oh.

482
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,544
Could he be talking about us?

483
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:22,946
- No, that's not us.
- No, not us, boss.

484
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:25,182
They're lying, Nick.

485
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,417
I know this is probably
another game you're playing,

486
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,539
only this time it's with me.

487
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,623
You can't show
disrespect to a whore

488
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,825
and that's what your friend is.

489
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,495
- No, she's...
- It's best not to interrupt me, Nick.

490
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,198
Yes, sir.

491
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,433
She's a whore, you're her pimp.

492
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:46,795
At least you look like a two-bit
pimp to me. Am I right?

493
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,307
No, I'm legit,
Mr. DeMarco.

494
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,275
Look, see.

495
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:56,279
Credit cards, driver's
license, they're all mine.

496
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:02,485
Well, Nick, what the hell.

497
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:05,822
Maybe you have a point.

498
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:08,959
Would $50,000 cover
your disrespect, Nick?

499
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:10,694
You're very generous.

500
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,830
And you're very stupid.

501
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,268
But even so, you probably
know what this is.

502
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,337
And where it's been.

503
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,872
- Let me just leave.
- Oh, you're gonna leave, Nick.

504
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,841
The question is what shape
you're gonna be in

505
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,610
- when you do so.
- Listen, I...

506
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,445
Didn't I tell you something
about interrupting me,

507
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,547
you dumb fuck?

508
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,487
Yes, sir.

509
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,356
You remember what?

510
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,292
- You said it was best not to.
- Right.

511
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,596
You see, if I'm sweet
to you, Nick,

512
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,965
if I just let you walk
out of here free as air,

513
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,935
<i>well, I want people</i>
<i>to know how sweet I am.</i>

514
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:54,371
<i>So, be honest, Nick.</i>

515
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,539
Tell me about my
good qualities,

516
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,021
and if I believe you,
you're free as air.

517
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,351
You're a great man,
Mr. DeMarco.

518
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:10,920
A peach of a guy.
You're the best.

519
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,890
A genuine top of
the line human being.

520
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:21,431
You failed so far, Nick, but I'm
gonna give you one more chance.

521
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:24,000
So go ahead, talk about me.

522
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,874
The fuck are you
thinking about, huh?

523
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:52,462
Corsica.

524
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:54,864
- But it went away.
- Tiel, Kinlaw,

525
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,733
take this dumb fuck
out of my sight.

526
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:59,669
Why don't you show him
how sweet I really am?

527
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,940
Let's go.

528
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,569
Stop him!

529
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,143
That's him.

530
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:14,677
Better be,

531
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,119
or he's got one
hell of a lawsuit.

532
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,993
You softened them up
pretty good.

533
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,157
Remember me?

534
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,963
<i>Sure, you're the party girl</i>

535
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:37,967
- we had all those nice games with.
- Right.

536
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:42,439
I had so much fun, I can't
stand that that party is over.

537
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:44,841
I wanted it to go on forever.

538
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,644
Hey, what's she up to, huh?

539
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:59,622
- The envy of all mankind.
- Yeah.

540
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:04,060
- Do you know who I am?
- Of course.

541
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,200
You're the party giver.

542
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,238
What the fuck
is she doing, huh?

543
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,708
<i>What is this about? Money?</i>
<i>Is that what this is?</i>

544
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,544
Sure it is. You know what,
just take the 50, huh?

545
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,847
- <i> Take it for chrissakes.</i>
- What money?

546
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:25,748
$50,000.
Top desk drawer.

547
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,152
Yeah, there you go.

548
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,027
- Yeah, see?
- This isn't about money.

549
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,600
- This is about love.
- Is it?

550
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,869
Hey, I didn't do nothin'.

551
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:47,537
It was all Tiel and Kinlaw.

552
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,771
It was them. Why don't
you tell your girl

553
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:49,973
to put those away?

554
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,335
I hope I sharpened
these enough.

555
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,746
- Let's see.
- Hey...

556
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:59,282
Hey, wait...
Wait! Hey...

557
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:02,552
Guess they're sharp enough.

558
00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:06,689
Look, there's a little tiny cut
right on the envy of all mankind.

559
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:12,095
Let me... just let me be!
Let me be, please!

560
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:14,831
I... you got the wrong idea!
I'm really a good guy!

561
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,766
- I am!
- So you're not mad at me, then?

562
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:19,202
No! No!

563
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:25,909
Good, I'm not mad
at you, either.

564
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:29,552
I'm gonna give you the same
break that you gave me.

565
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,717
Tell me you love me,

566
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,254
and if I believe it,
then I'll let you keep it.

567
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:41,991
But if I don't believe you,
that means you're a bad boy.

568
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:45,595
And bad boys need
to be punished.

569
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:49,232
So that the envy of all mankind

570
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:53,636
will have to go away with me.

571
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,344
I... love you.

572
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:04,247
- What'd you say?
- I love you.

573
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:07,784
I don't think that
sounded very sincere.

574
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:10,753
- Did it?
- This is your show.

575
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:15,224
Don't! Don't do this,
don't! Don't!

576
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,826
Last chance.

577
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,596
I fucking love you!

578
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:20,863
I just...
I just love...

579
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:22,198
I love you!
I love you!

580
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,967
Please, please don't...
look, okay.

581
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:26,035
I made a little mistake.
I made a little mistake!

582
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:28,237
Everyone can make
a little mistake, okay?

583
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,272
Just don't!

584
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:31,107
No, no, no, please don't!

585
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,876
Don't! Don't!
I'm sorry!

586
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,050
Don't!

587
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:04,140
- Wish I brought my camera.
- Okay. Okay.

588
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:09,912
<i>You have to leave town, Holly.</i>

589
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:12,115
<i>They're coming for me, too.</i>

590
00:44:12,117 --> 00:44:14,384
First, I'm gonna win enough cash
to get out of this place for good.

591
00:44:14,386 --> 00:44:17,954
Yeah, I know. I spent the last hours
packing, without regret I might add,

592
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:20,089
- because I'm heading straight for...
- Hey, don't tell me.

593
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,958
If I don't know,
I can't tell anybody.

594
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,760
You that sure
they'll come after you?

595
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:25,428
- You know damn well they will.
- You could've killed them.

596
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,263
I try not to do that.

597
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,403
No, you keep it all.

598
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:35,206
You're the one
that took the risk.

599
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,946
Okay, I want half.

600
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:45,828
I'm the one that
took the beating.

601
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:48,044
Well, you only look about a
million times better than before.

602
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:50,079
A friend of mine left town.

603
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,515
We had this kind of
going away thing.

604
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:54,150
Sounds sweet.

605
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:55,852
How much longer
you on this shift?

606
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:58,121
11:50. Ten minutes.

607
00:45:58,123 --> 00:46:00,523
What the hell,
I shall keep you company.

608
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:03,326
Well, I've been killin'
everyone tonight, Nicky.

609
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:07,163
You did something for me once.
So believe this, bet small.

610
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,767
Changing 100.

611
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:14,270
Since it's a $5 minimum,
how's if I bet five dollars?

612
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,814
Bust.

613
00:46:24,816 --> 00:46:26,048
It's been like that.

614
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:32,955
Blackjack.

615
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,277
I lose more friends this way.

616
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,975
What is it?

617
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,178
Cass, I've got 19.

618
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:00,249
And you've a 10 showing,
except I know somethin'.

619
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:02,351
Your down card
is another picture

620
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:06,856
which makes 20,
so my 19 is shit.

621
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:08,457
You want me to hit 19, Nicky?

622
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:11,360
I'll tell you why.

623
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:13,429
Because there's a weight
on my shoulder now.

624
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:17,433
Locks right into my shoulder now.
It's happened.

625
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:19,502
I've got to go
for the throat, Cass.

626
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:23,105
Because of all the people in all
the casinos in all the world,

627
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:26,175
luck's come camping with me.

628
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:29,612
So, yes, I want you
to hit my 19.

629
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,384
<i>And I'd like a two.</i>
<i>Two is 21.</i>

630
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:37,486
Means I win.

631
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:42,058
My two please, Cass.

632
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,902
Jesus.

633
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:57,006
I'd like a $1,000 dollar
chip please, Cass.

634
00:47:57,008 --> 00:47:59,508
One way or another, this
is my last night in Vegas.

635
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,645
Changing 1,000.

636
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,683
Take care, Nicky.

637
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:47,089
- You playing?
- No.

638
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,258
You got mean eyes.

639
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,023
Up or down?

640
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,063
I had luck riding with me,

641
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,445
then they changed dealers.

642
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:40,977
Asshole!

643
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,281
Not you, me.

644
00:49:45,283 --> 00:49:46,523
How do I know it's gone?

645
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,722
Blackjack.

646
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,018
Give me a chip rack, please.

647
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,006
Can I raise the limit?

648
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:11,474
No.

649
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:13,876
I'll play the whole table then.

650
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:43,639
Nah, I'm not greedy.

651
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,115
You gotta win some time.

652
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,288
- Blackjack.
- What the fuck is this?

653
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,323
Retribution for 5,000 mornings.

654
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:03,659
And watch your mouth
in front of a lady.

655
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:06,062
Thanks, sweetie.

656
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:22,278
God, what a thing when
luck comes callin', huh?

657
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:25,848
Good.

658
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:31,087
Yes!

659
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,495
Son of a god damn bitch.

660
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:56,579
Good.

661
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,817
<i>If I win...</i>

662
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:03,819
I'm over 500.

663
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,723
<i>And that'll be the last</i>
<i>you ever hear of me.</i>

664
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,818
Yes! What the hell!

665
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,820
Yes!

666
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:41,690
500 and...
6 thousand.

667
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,561
It isn't exactly
a round number,

668
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:48,664
but then I was never
one to quibble.

669
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,875
- Fiji?
- Vodka.

670
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:02,511
- Rocks with a twist?
- Look at that.

671
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,313
Doubles, please, Veronica.

672
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:06,182
Thank you, Veronica.

673
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,285
So what do your
friends call you?

674
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,687
Cyrus is a pretty shitty name.

675
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,556
I always wanted to
be called Ace or Duke.

676
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:16,258
But Cyrus seems like
the overwhelming choice.

677
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,862
How are you not more excited?

678
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,631
Never hit over
half a mil before.

679
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:25,367
I don't know why
I'm not more excited.

680
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,470
Maybe it's because I never
dared think it would happen.

681
00:53:28,472 --> 00:53:31,307
That make sense?

682
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:32,808
Kinda.

683
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,311
- Anything else?
- That's all, thanks, hon.

684
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:38,614
Here, love, take some time off.
Go see your mom.

685
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:44,220
Thank you so much, Nick.

686
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:46,422
- Well, cheers.
- Hey, cheers.

687
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,494
- You're leaving town?
- Think bigger.

688
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:53,729
State, country, continent.

689
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,400
Five free years, Duke.

690
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,369
I've been dreamin'
this since forever.

691
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:04,873
$100,000 per. I've got
it figured to the penny.

692
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,577
Guess you haven't
liked Vegas much, huh?

693
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,879
You're not supposed
to like Vegas.

694
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:15,751
It's just this creeping virus
people catch sometimes.

695
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:20,022
Sweet dreams.

696
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:22,258
I'm off to Corsica
in the morning.

697
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,893
I'm gonna sail the
Mediterranean before I die.

698
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:26,795
Well, I'll walk you out.

699
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,864
That's very kind of you, Duke.

700
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,463
Fuck.

701
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:37,333
What's happened?

702
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:40,069
It was all horseshit.

703
00:55:40,071 --> 00:55:43,939
It's just a loser's dream.

704
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,975
I don't get you.

705
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:50,045
This is not what I need.

706
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:53,582
Five years would only
be fine at first.

707
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:55,884
After that I'd just
realize that every day

708
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:59,488
was another day closer
to bein' back here.

709
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:02,825
I never pushed the logic, because I
never thought I'd be in this position.

710
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:05,994
Half a million.

711
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:09,898
Well, half a million's nothing.

712
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,340
I know now what I really need.

713
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:17,005
- What's that?
- "Fuck you" money.

714
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,745
Enough so I'll never
have to come back here.

715
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:28,884
Freedom. That's what
"fuck you" money is.

716
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:46,402
I don't want any limit.

717
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:47,770
I have to clear that.

718
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,174
Let me check.

719
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:59,114
He thinks I'm gonna lose.

720
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:00,916
You've got it.

721
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:02,050
Asshole.

722
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:06,054
It's 500.

723
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:07,089
You count it.

724
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:16,198
- 500,000 going out.
- Send it.

725
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:26,675
That's 525,000.

726
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,979
This fella's gettin'
awful heavy.

727
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:32,681
All on one, Cass.

728
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,869
<i>It's just like</i>
<i>we started, Cass.</i>

729
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,808
I know you've got another
picture under there.

730
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:07,883
Hit me.

731
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,155
A four.

732
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:14,790
If you don't mind.

733
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,639
You should've stood, Nicky.

734
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:05,874
You would've won.

735
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:19,655
I came in with $25,000.
Lost $25,000.

736
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,192
No big deal.

737
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:58,860
You fuckin' had it.

738
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:00,228
You fuckin' had it!

739
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:02,264
<i>It was right there.</i>

740
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:03,932
<i>You fuckin' had it!</i>

741
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,901
<i>You fuckin' had it.</i>

742
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,280
It was all there.
It was all there.

743
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,949
<i>On the fucking table.</i>

744
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:23,652
<i>You fuckin' had it!</i>

745
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:25,287
On the fucking table!

746
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,663
<i>You fuckin' had it.</i>

747
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:35,998
You fuckin' had it!

748
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,175
Would you like your
grapefruit juice now?

749
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,216
How did I get here?

750
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:30,118
After you passed out,
I tipped some of the staff

751
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,753
to help me bring you.

752
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,427
Thank you.

753
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:45,734
Hmm, I thought
you'd be thirsty.

754
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,138
<i>Listen, Duke,</i>
<i>you're a great caterer,</i>

755
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,707
<i>and I appreciate it.</i>

756
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,475
But I think you
got somethin' to say

757
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:57,145
and it's time you said it.

758
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:58,213
You won't laugh?

759
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,115
Not today.

760
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,956
Alright, I...

761
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:10,158
I lied about my friend
recommending you.

762
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,394
<i>And I didn't have to ask</i>
<i>for your qualifications.</i>

763
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:15,197
I knew everything about you,
I've researched you.

764
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:17,265
I knew about the
grapefruit juice, right?

765
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:19,501
<i>And the double vodka.</i>

766
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:21,503
<i>And I know about why</i>
<i>you always sit</i>

767
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:23,505
in the same spot
at the Silver Spoon Counter.

768
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:30,212
I need something from you and I've
come too far for a no answer.

769
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:40,188
A while back in Boston I saw
this old guy on the street

770
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,390
and he had a sign
on his back that said,

771
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:44,192
"Please don't hit me"

772
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:49,364
<i>And my first thought was,</i>
<i>"What a sad thing"</i>

773
01:02:49,366 --> 01:02:51,299
<i>But then...</i>

774
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:54,436
I got so fucking mad

775
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:57,305
because I realized that was
going to be me when I got old.

776
01:02:57,307 --> 01:03:01,209
<i>Just an old nut</i>
<i>scared of the world.</i>

777
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:04,546
And so I've come to you.

778
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:06,414
I want you to teach me.

779
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:12,554
- Teach you what?
- Anything. Everything.

780
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:16,324
I need you to kill the fear that
lives inside of me every day.

781
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:17,793
You want to sail
the Mediterranean,

782
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:20,295
I want to do something
brave before I die.

783
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:26,034
Hey, listen, kid...

784
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:31,339
I earned 70 million dollars
by the time I was 19.

785
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,409
Don't call me kid.

786
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:41,249
Jesus. How?

787
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:42,851
It was nothing.

788
01:03:42,853 --> 01:03:45,554
I put a new twist
on an old twist

789
01:03:45,556 --> 01:03:48,290
on computer software.

790
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:51,393
Being smart is the only
defense I've ever had,

791
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:54,863
but it's not enough anymore.

792
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:57,966
You've got to help me.

793
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,103
You know how fuckin'
weird this is?

794
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:06,274
<i>You're not even 30,</i>
<i>set for life.</i>

795
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:08,610
I'm pushing 40, broke.

796
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:10,378
I'll pay you.
I'll make you rich.

797
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:13,381
I have been rich.
Most recently last night.

798
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:16,084
Yeah, I could help you
with that, too.

799
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,222
Help me with what?

800
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,025
Are you serious?

801
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:27,529
I like blackjack
maybe more than I should.

802
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:31,032
- That's all.
- Why do you think you stay here?

803
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:34,135
You hate it so much it's the
only place you can stay.

804
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:35,577
It's the only place
you're worthy of.

805
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:38,607
It's all so obvious.

806
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:40,275
Well, if it's all
so fuckin' obvious,

807
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:42,143
why are you so fuckin' wrong?

808
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:43,979
Huh?

809
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,415
Don't go!
We can help each other!

810
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:50,118
You know what? You're just
like the nuts who write to me.

811
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,088
You want adventure? Swell!

812
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:56,224
Well I earned my past, Cyrus.
Go earn your own.

813
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,954
This one's on me, Nick.
Looks like you need it.

814
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,064
Nick Wild, how you doin'?

815
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:38,667
You need to come with us.
Mr. DeMarco's waiting.

816
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:59,868
Take five.

817
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,811
Nicholas. Nicholas.

818
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:12,280
Baby.

819
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:15,683
I heard you were up over 500
last night at the Gate.

820
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:16,918
Talk of the town.

821
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,853
Do you remember, when was it?

822
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:20,355
A couple months ago when you
had us beaten for 200 grand?

823
01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:22,457
Right here at the Nugget?

824
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:25,660
- Till your luck changed.
- I'll get there some day.

825
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:31,366
Nicholas.

826
01:09:31,368 --> 01:09:35,503
I'm just in a terrible bind
and it's all because of you.

827
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:38,940
It seems that somebody broke
into room 3506 last night,

828
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:43,311
beat up on three guys
and took $50,000.

829
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:45,594
And that was before
I had my Wheaties.

830
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:48,950
If only that were funny.

831
01:09:48,952 --> 01:09:53,321
No, it seems that
this same somebody

832
01:09:53,323 --> 01:09:57,192
shot and killed two gentlemen
names Kinlaw and Tiel.

833
01:09:57,194 --> 01:10:00,929
Shot them while they
were tied and helpless.

834
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:05,400
And an eyewitness claims
that that someone was you.

835
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,443
And you believe that?

836
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:11,472
If I did, you'd be dead.

837
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,412
- Come along, Nicholas.
- Come along where?

838
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:20,615
To see DeMarco. I have
to find the truth.

839
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:23,351
Wait a minute,
you mean I'm on trial?

840
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:25,154
For your life,
I should imagine.

841
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,269
<i>Why do I have to tell it again?</i>

842
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:18,606
<i>I told you.</i>
<i>You believe me. So why?</i>

843
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:22,577
Because, Daniel, you are asking
me to kill Nicholas here.

844
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:24,545
And if a mistake
was later discovered,

845
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:26,681
I would feel simply dreadful.

846
01:11:26,683 --> 01:11:29,751
So please, be as brief
as you will.

847
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,722
I feel guilty
because I let him in.

848
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:36,758
<i>When the knock came</i>
<i>on the door, I...</i>

849
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:40,695
<i>I wasn't thinking</i>
<i>and I opened it.</i>

850
01:11:40,697 --> 01:11:42,930
And right away
he pistol whips me,

851
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:44,432
right in the mouth,
you see? Right there.

852
01:11:44,434 --> 01:11:45,800
- Mm..hmm. Yes.
- <i> Right there.</i>

853
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,435
- Yeah.
- <i> And he's quick.</i>

854
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:50,405
He takes out Tiel and Kinlaw
like they were nothing.

855
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:51,773
And he ties them up
back to back

856
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:53,441
the way they were
when you found 'em.

857
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:59,314
And then he rifles my desk,
he takes the 50 and...

858
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:03,685
for no fucking reason
he goes crazy

859
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:07,555
<i>and he shoots maybe my two best
friends in the whole world.</i>

860
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:11,392
Why?

861
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:17,965
Probably he's pissed that
there wasn't more cash.

862
01:12:17,967 --> 01:12:19,967
<i>And probably he</i>
<i>would've killed me, too,</i>

863
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:21,969
but there was a noise
out in the hall

864
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:24,339
and he panicked and he ran.

865
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:27,909
Shot 'em with their
own guns, Baby.

866
01:12:27,911 --> 01:12:30,845
Can you believe that?

867
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,847
You check.

868
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,849
You'll see that
I'm telling the truth.

869
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:37,385
They're gonna have his
fingerprints all over 'em.

870
01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:38,920
Don't bother checkin'.

871
01:12:38,922 --> 01:12:42,890
- The fingerprints are mine.
- This is all true then?

872
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:44,959
- Some.
- Which?

873
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,630
You better speak, Nicholas.

874
01:12:49,632 --> 01:12:52,033
And I suggest you
begin right now.

875
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:56,637
I'll ask just two
questions, Baby.

876
01:12:56,639 --> 01:12:58,506
If you're gonna answer them
to your satisfaction,

877
01:12:58,508 --> 01:13:01,376
do what you will.

878
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:03,144
First, why would I use a gun?

879
01:13:03,146 --> 01:13:05,580
The fuck kind of
question is that?

880
01:13:05,582 --> 01:13:08,149
Why does anybody use a gun?

881
01:13:08,151 --> 01:13:10,785
Nicholas never does.

882
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:13,388
Believe me, he could
kill you with...

883
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,523
he could kill you with this

884
01:13:15,525 --> 01:13:17,792
<i>from five feet or 15.</i>

885
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:21,162
And the answer to your
question is this.

886
01:13:21,164 --> 01:13:22,897
It's the perfect cover.

887
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:25,533
<i>Nobody would ever dream</i>
<i>that Nick Wild needed a gun</i>

888
01:13:25,535 --> 01:13:28,736
to commit a robbery.

889
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:31,072
Alright, Nicholas.
Second question.

890
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:32,907
Second and last.

891
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:39,013
Baby, what do you
know about my body?

892
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:43,117
- I mean, underneath my clothes?
- Obviously nothing.

893
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:45,186
<i>Well, then, there's</i>
<i>my second question.</i>

894
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:49,624
How is it possible that I
know that Mr. DeMarco here

895
01:13:49,626 --> 01:13:52,026
has a small but definite cut

896
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:54,095
on the upper side
of his Hampton?

897
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:57,999
<i>Answer?</i>

898
01:13:58,001 --> 01:14:00,134
<i>I saw it put there</i>
<i>by a dear sweet lady</i>

899
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:02,837
with a pair of garden shears.

900
01:14:02,839 --> 01:14:05,573
- What is this shit, huh?
- It's easy to find out if I'm lying,

901
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:07,041
just have him take
down his trousers.

902
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:09,477
You're not buying this crap,
are you, Baby?

903
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:10,812
Someone go get a microscope

904
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:13,080
so we locate
Mr. DeMarco's pecker.

905
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:14,682
<i>- You know what?</i>
<i>- I'm not stripping.</i>

906
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:16,451
I'm not stripping for nobody.

907
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:17,985
I think you must, Daniel.

908
01:14:17,987 --> 01:14:20,455
Nicholas is risking his life

909
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:23,825
on a very unusual
long shot here.

910
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:25,126
<i>I know it's embarrassing,</i>

911
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:27,462
<i>but I'll make it</i>
<i>easier for you.</i>

912
01:14:27,464 --> 01:14:29,564
You and I will go
in the other room,

913
01:14:29,566 --> 01:14:32,133
and we'll both
take down our pants.

914
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:35,069
I won't. I won't.

915
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:37,605
- I'm afraid you must.
- It's...

916
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:39,874
It's a matter
of principle, Baby. I...

917
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:41,776
<i>- Nobody would...</i>
<i>- Second cousin.</i>

918
01:14:41,778 --> 01:14:44,545
- It's principle.
- Oh, dear.

919
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:47,615
It's principle! He...

920
01:14:47,617 --> 01:14:50,251
Would somebody shut
this god damn fucker up?

921
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:52,854
Oh, Daniel, you just
blew the ballgame.

922
01:14:52,856 --> 01:14:55,790
Nobody in your family has had
even a passing relationship

923
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:58,192
with a principle
in the past 50 years.

924
01:14:58,194 --> 01:14:59,894
So you're siding with him?

925
01:14:59,896 --> 01:15:02,497
Baby, you believe him over me?

926
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:06,267
I believe this.

927
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:11,606
I believe that somebody
who looks like Nicholas

928
01:15:11,608 --> 01:15:13,608
did the deed.

929
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:17,678
And I will endeavor
to find him.

930
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:18,646
Now you may go.

931
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:25,786
You. I'm gonna see
you real soon.

932
01:15:25,788 --> 01:15:27,788
I'm gonna see you real soon.

933
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:32,860
<i>You watch your fuckin' back!</i>

934
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:36,597
Why do you think he did it?

935
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:39,634
He's a very macho little slime.

936
01:15:39,636 --> 01:15:42,476
And he broke down and humiliated
himself in front of them.

937
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,074
You know he'll come for you.

938
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:48,042
Yeah.

939
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,949
If you don't care,
why'd you defend yourself?

940
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:57,218
I didn't wanna be remembered
for doin' what he said.

941
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:01,188
Dyin' ain't so bad.

942
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:04,292
And at least I'll be
out of Las Vegas.

943
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:08,996
Thank you, Nicholas.
Good luck.

944
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:12,099
- Cheers, Baby.
- Alright. Be well.

945
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,644
Hey.

946
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:30,447
That bad, huh?

947
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:37,418
<i>Could you get the</i>
<i>check, please?</i>

948
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:57,338
I'm leaving.

949
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:00,041
I'm only here to give you
a present of gratitude

950
01:18:00,043 --> 01:18:02,677
of everything you taught me.

951
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:05,312
What, for chrissakes?

952
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:09,817
That everyone's afraid.

953
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:18,726
That I'm not the only cowardly
asshole in this world.

954
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:20,127
You're one, too.

955
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:22,329
I really needed this now.

956
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,401
What I have to deal
with is that

957
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:30,805
I'm the one inside my own skin.

958
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:32,773
Maybe it's not so terrible.

959
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:34,108
And if you can admit
what you are,

960
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:36,343
you might find it's
not so terrible either.

961
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:50,991
Okay, Duke.
I admit it.

962
01:18:50,993 --> 01:18:52,960
<i>If I'd won the full million,</i>

963
01:18:52,962 --> 01:18:57,898
I would have figured out
some reason to go for more.

964
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,134
I'm a trapped compulsive.

965
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:03,738
There. I said it.

966
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,140
See me tap dancing?

967
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:11,212
No, but you might have taken

968
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:13,013
the first tiny step
toward your sailboat.

969
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:15,883
Yeah, doubtful.

970
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:19,386
Doubtful for two reasons, the
first being the lack of funding.

971
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:24,091
I knew you were gonna say that.

972
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,160
Reach under the counter.

973
01:19:26,162 --> 01:19:27,928
I told you I bought
you a present.

974
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,865
<i>I taped it there</i>
<i>before you got here.</i>

975
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:45,946
What's this?

976
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,349
One plane ticket to Corsica

977
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:53,354
<i>and a check for $500,000.</i>

978
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:01,896
Okay, so, first reason's
taken care of.

979
01:20:01,898 --> 01:20:03,964
Now what's the second?

980
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:08,435
I'm bein' murdered any minute.

981
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:11,906
Murdered?

982
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:14,074
Really? When is
this happening?

983
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:22,116
Now.

984
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:29,456
Oh.

985
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,499
Put them away, put them away.

986
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:16,136
I want him found now, today.

987
01:21:16,138 --> 01:21:18,172
I want you to find
that asshole.

988
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:19,874
I want you to find him.
I don't care how long

989
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:22,042
it takes any of you dumb fucks.

990
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,944
<i>You call more fuckin' guys.</i>

991
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:26,413
<i>Get two on the bus station</i>
<i>and a few at the airport.</i>

992
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:29,016
<i>Check every bar, every
casino, every whorehouse.</i>

993
01:21:29,018 --> 01:21:31,418
<i>Turn over every god damn rock</i>
<i>he could slither under.</i>

994
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,654
<i>You find out where he lives...</i>

995
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:36,991
<i>Where he works...</i>

996
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,561
<i>how much it costs.</i>

997
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:43,297
<i>Go back inside there,</i>
<i>grab that fuckin' kid</i>

998
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:45,432
<i>and kill that</i>
<i>motherfucker, too!</i>

999
01:22:23,638 --> 01:22:26,106
Get in there!
Get in there! Go!

1000
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:44,651
You don't wanna go back there.

1001
01:23:44,653 --> 01:23:46,720
- <i> You lost them?</i>
- In a manner of speaking.

1002
01:23:46,722 --> 01:23:49,123
Hey, wait, you forgot these.

1003
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:50,391
Take them.

1004
01:23:50,393 --> 01:23:52,760
- Nah, nah.
- No, take them!

1005
01:23:52,762 --> 01:23:55,662
Nick, please.
I can leave town now

1006
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:57,431
and know that I'm not a coward.

1007
01:23:57,433 --> 01:24:00,134
And you have no idea what
a relief that is for me.

1008
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:06,073
You earned this.

1009
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:14,581
Thanks. And not
just for this.

1010
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:16,583
Not just for acting
like an idiot

1011
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:20,087
so I could get
out of the diner.

1012
01:24:20,089 --> 01:24:22,256
You're a good friend.

1013
01:24:22,258 --> 01:24:24,391
We're friends?

1014
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,193
Don't ruin it.

1015
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:37,304
- <i> Good-bye, Duke.</i>
- Merry Christmas, Nick.

1016
