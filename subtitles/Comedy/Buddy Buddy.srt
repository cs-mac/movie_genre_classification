outside his home in Banning.
</i>

6
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:19,128
<i>
The other two witnesses, 
Barney Pritzig and Rudy Disco Gambola

7
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:20,422

<i> San Gabriel Valley and... </i>

17
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:44,243
They're three for a dollar.

18
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:47,646
One at a time.

19
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:30,918
Come on, open up!

20
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:32,966
Open up in there!

20
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,914
- Yes?
- Barney Pritzig?

21
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:43,121
Why do you want to know?

22
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:45,821
I'm Captain Hubris,
the District Attorney sent us.

23
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:47,557
We're gonna be
your babysitters.

24
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:48,926
Thank God

25
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:53,216
Come in, gentlemen, come in.

26
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:02,014
Would you believe I was afraid
to bring in the milk and the paper?

27
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:03,467
Let's see, what’ve
we got here?

28
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:04,499
You guys had your breakfast?

29
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:05,599
Yes, thank you.

30
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:06,751
You're welcome.

31
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,975
Moffet, you secure all the 
doors and windows.

32
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,296
I want this place sealed up
tighter than Fort Knox!

*** Fort Knox is a US Army post in Kentucky, south of Louisville and north of Elizabeth Town, the base occupies an area of 441 square Kms and a large portion of the US Bullion depository is kept there in a fortified vault building ***

33
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:13,350
Garcia, check the joint-out
from top to bottom.

34
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:16,138
Look in every closet,
under every bed,

35
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:17,640
behind every curtain.

36
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,094
Jacobie, you go out
and cover the backyard...

37
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:22,097
and the garage and the alley.

38
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,106
Tell me..

39
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:28,658
Mr Pritzig..

40
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:30,892
this fire place, 
is ita real one?

41
00:05:31,193 --> 00:05:32,364
or just a dummy?

42
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,232
Because we don't want any
Santa Claus dropping in on you.

43
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:41,613
Did you say something,
Mr Pritzig?

44
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:46,421
Mr Pritzig!

45
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,122
Cyanide!

46
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:16,654

53

Rudy Disco Gambola,
the man who knows too much.

54
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,874
<i>

00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:46,820
<i> On the stock market today... </i>

59
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:17,771
- Check my tires please.
- Yes, ma'am.

60
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:19,374
- Fill  her up.
- Right.

61
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:20,693
- Unleaded!
- All right.

62
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:28,846
- Did you wash your hands?
- Yes.

63
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:45,250
<i> Just a minute! </i>

64
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,596
I'm sorry.
I was throwing up.

65
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:54,348
I have a nervous stomach!

66
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:57,587
They say it's psychosomatic
because of my wife.

67
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,160
We're separated.

68
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:01,283
Three months
this Thursday.

69
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:05,701
Bye.

70
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:15,238
All yours!

71
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,231
#Cecilia#

72
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:52,427
- Let's go.
- Right!

73
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:55,455
We're there the
top of the stairs.

74
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:56,837
- Here you go.
- Check!

75
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:34,312
Just exactly where are you
hiding this guy Gambola?

76
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:35,478
When are you bringing him in?

77
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:38,085
In Vegas, it's 7 to 5
Gambola won't live to testify.

78
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:40,038
You've already lost
two witnesses.

79
00:10:40,212 --> 00:10:42,181
What makes you think
you won't lose this one?

80
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:44,199
All right!
shut up for a minute!

81
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,282
I know what you guys 
Think about cops...

82
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:48,719
a bunch of dumb,
trigger-happy Yo-Yos!

83
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:51,022
You'd just love it if we
blew this one, wouldn't you?

84
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,457
Well, we're not going to!

85
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:55,247
You stick around because
come 2:00 this afternoon,

86
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:57,918
Gambola will sing!
I guarantee you.

87
00:10:58,485 --> 00:10:59,747
Now, have you got
any other questions?

88
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:00,898
I'm a busy man.

89
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:07,784
Yes?

90
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:09,972
I have a reservation,
name of Trabucco.

91
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,141
Oh, yes, Mr Trabucco.

92
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:14,510
You asked for a room
at the front of the hotel,

93
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:15,744
not too high up.

94
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:17,213
We have just the thing for you.

95
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,816
Will you fill this in, please?

96
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,951
How long will you 
be staying with us?

97
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,689
I'll let you know.

98
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:32,759
361.

99
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,012
I'll take that.

100
00:11:35,563 --> 00:11:36,798
This way.

101
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:40,268
First time in Riverside?

102
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:42,804
Salesman?

103
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:46,307
Last month, we had convention
of computer salesmen here.

104
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:48,875
The stories I could tell you.

105
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:51,323
The booze, the broads,
the grass.

106
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:54,094
They had to smuggle out
three naked hookers,

107
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,797
down the laundry chute.

108
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,551
You want me to shut up, right?

109
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:06,748
Good morning,
May I help you?

110
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,231
How many would you like?

111
00:13:13,942 --> 00:13:15,511
Lot of excitement
down there today.

112
00:13:15,956 --> 00:13:18,975
The bathroom's in here
and that's the closet in there.

113
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:21,204
And this is the switch
for the air conditioning.

114
00:13:21,304 --> 00:13:23,696
It's... temporarily out of order.

115
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:25,699
And if you need
anything at all...

116
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:26,847
I won't need anything.

117
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:28,483
...ask for Eddie.

118
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:49,486
Is everybody
in position up there?

119
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:51,187
Can you hear me up there?

120
00:14:08,504 --> 00:14:10,623
Operator, how do I get long distance?

121
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:11,723
Thank you.

122
00:14:22,684 --> 00:14:24,058
Hello, Mr Green?

123
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:25,794
Oh, Mr White.

124
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:27,597
Let me speak to Mr Brown.

125
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,771
Hello, Mr. Brown?
This is the dentist calling.

126
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,028
Everything is on schedule
I'm right here in the operating room,

127
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:39,233
but I've been looking at those X-rays
and I'm afraid we're gonna

128
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:40,669
have to renegotiate the deal.

129
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:44,195
I know I gave you an estimate
for those three rotten teeth,

130
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:45,577
but it's just not realistic.

131
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:48,054
The first two were
simple extractions.

132
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:52,922
This one is a root canal job.
I figure it's worth another 10 grand.

133
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:55,864
Come on, you know I do nice work.

134
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:59,199
I'd better, because if I don't, you
guys are gonna have my ass, right?

135
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:01,758
So, what's it gonna be?
do I go ahead?

136
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:04,358
or should I cancel
the 2:00 appointment?

137
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,314
Okay, then we're in business.

138
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:10,000
Goodbye, Mr Brown.

139
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,313
How long will you be 
with us, Mr Clooney?

140
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:09,549
That depends...

141
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:13,622
on my wife, She is
staying with a friend.

142
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,460
Actually, he is no friend of mine.

143
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:17,756
359.

144
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:19,149
Enjoy your visit.

145
00:16:19,365 --> 00:16:20,567
I sure hope so.

146
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:22,378
First time in Riverside?

147
00:16:22,478 --> 00:16:25,196
Yes. Uh.. come to think of it, no.

148
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:27,396
We passed through...
me and my wife...

149
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:29,815
on our honeymoon
on our way to Palm Springs.

150
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,610
That was 12 years ago.

151
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:39,042
<i> Here you are. </i>

152
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:44,715
<i>
A nice, quiet room
on the side of the hotel,
</i>

153
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,215
<i>
away from all the excitement.
</i>

154
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:48,018
<i> Quiet is what I need. </i>

155
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:53,541
Well, the bathroom's here,
the closet's there,

156
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:57,094
And..Uh, forget the air conditioning.
It hasn't worked in years.

157
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:59,798
My name's Eddie.
If there's anything you need...

158
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,762
I do.

159
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,875
Could you bring up
a.. a bucket of ice, please,

160
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:06,776
and two glasses?

161
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,431
None of that plastic stuff,
just two, nice...

162
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:11,672
long stemmed glasses
made out of glass.

163
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:13,087
I'll see what I can do.

164
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:16,209
Thank you.

165
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:53,190
Is it all ashes
or is there still a spark?

166
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:56,850
Is it all ashes
or is there still a spark?

167
00:18:00,097 --> 00:18:02,535
Operator, can I have an
outside line please? Thank you.

168
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,141
Is there still a spark...?

169
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:19,745
Uh... would you
connect me please...

170
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:23,817
uh... with Mrs Clooney...
Mrs Victor Clooney. It's personal.

171
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:31,182
Uh, Celia?

172
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,375
Hi, Celia, it's me.

173
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,874
Don't hang up!

174
00:18:37,753 --> 00:18:40,497
Uh, no no no. I'm here in Riverside,
at the Ramona Hotel.

175
00:18:40,648 --> 00:18:41,846
Oh, I want to see you.

176
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:46,207
Well, you may have nothing
to discuss, but I do.

177
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,038
All I want you to do is come up
here for one half an hour.

178
00:18:50,138 --> 00:18:52,585
Now, is that too much to ask?
A lousy half hour?

179
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:55,739
What do you mean the
doctor wouldn't like..?

180
00:18:56,987 --> 00:18:59,487
I'm your husband, for heaven's sakes.
Don't I get any points for that?

181
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:01,638
What? Are you gonna tell
me I came all the way here

182
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:02,801
and you won't even...

183
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:09,290
Is this how we are going to
end 12 years of marriage?

184
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:12,717
Look. I am not proud.
I'm not vindictive.

185
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,745
I am willing to forgive
and forget.

186
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:17,592
I tell you, it has been hell
since you left, Cilia.

187
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:20,296
I've been sleeping on 
two chairs in the living room.

188
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:22,684
I couldn't bear to go
near the bed.

189
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:31,749
Celia, Celia, is it all ashes,
or is there still a spark, Celia?

190
00:19:35,697 --> 00:19:37,291
Aren't you gonna say
anything, Celia?

191
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:40,229
What do you mean "No way"?

192
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,799
I tell you, you are talking to a
man who is at the end of his rope!

193
00:19:44,386 --> 00:19:45,338
Celia?

194
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,332
Goodbye, Celia.

195
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:10,203
Rope.

196
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:12,404
Rope.

197
00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:20,974
#Does your mother#
#know your heart, Cecilia?# 

198
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:29,658
#And does she know that#
#I'm about to steal ya?#

199
00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:33,989
#Oh, my#

200
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:46,008
#When I look in your eyes,#
#something tells me#

201
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:51,890
#that you and I#
#should get together#

202
00:21:53,187 --> 00:22:02,033
#How about a little kiss, Cecilia?#

203
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:11,898
#Just a kiss you’ll never miss, Cecillia#

204
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:22,296
#... why do we two#
#just keep on wastin' time?#

205
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:24,380
#Oh, Cecilia#

206
00:22:25,816 --> 00:22:30,517
#say that you'll be mine#

207
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,778
Sir, it's me... Eddie, the bellhop.

208
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:56,120
Oh, my God!

209
00:24:00,091 --> 00:24:01,296
Hey, Mister!

210
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,708
Are you all right?!

211
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:26,653
Where's the cut-off? God dammit!

212
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,582
Hey, what the hell
is goin' on in here?

213
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:46,326
Tried to hang himself.
The guy checks in,

214
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:48,527
orders ice and real 
champagne glasses,

215
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:53,128
and you think he's getting ready
for a little daytime action, right?

216
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,829
Wait a minute,
who are you calling?

217
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,630
The desk, to get the police.

218
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:04,447
Police? What for?
He isn't dead.

219
00:25:04,655 --> 00:25:06,782
An attempted suicide.
You've got to report it.

220
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:07,882
That's the law.

221
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:10,734
Forget the cops. 
They got better things to do,

222
00:25:10,835 --> 00:25:11,935
especially today.

223
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:13,186
This is a respectable hotel.

224
00:25:13,286 --> 00:25:14,637
You bet. That's why
you don't want cops…

225
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:16,697
all over the place asking
stupid questions.

226
00:25:16,813 --> 00:25:18,089
Let me take it
up with the manager.

227
00:25:18,189 --> 00:25:19,340
You're not going to take it
up with anybody!

228
00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:21,241
Don't you think
that poor son of a bitch…

229
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:22,942
has enough troubles?
He doesn't need cops.

230
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:24,018
he needs sympathy,
understanding,

231
00:25:24,118 --> 00:25:26,344
a little human warmth!

232
00:25:28,022 --> 00:25:29,145
Celia...

233
00:25:33,927 --> 00:25:37,609
Here. Get yourself a hair dryer
and keep your mouth shut.

234
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:39,299
Anything you say.

235
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,348
But you'd better watch him.
He'll try it again.

236
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:44,649
They all do. I know.

237
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,650
I tried out
for the paramedics.

238
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,802
12 years, and she wouldn't
give me a half an hour...

239
00:25:51,902 --> 00:25:53,704
One lousy half an hour.

240
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:55,354
Haven't I seen you before?

241
00:25:55,603 --> 00:25:57,154
We met at the gas station.

242
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:59,956
Oh, yeah! What's this
with you and bathrooms?

243
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,357
Either you're throwing up
or you're trying to kill yourself.

244
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,592
Sorry…

245
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,459
What made you do it?

246
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,110
They caught you with
the hand in the till?

247
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,411
Bookies after you?
Terminal cancer? What?

248
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:10,725
Terminal love.

249
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:13,040
Love? You did it for a dame?

250
00:26:13,411 --> 00:26:15,864
Celia's not a dame!
She's my wife!

251
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:19,765
Actually, she's my second wife.
I left my first wife for Celia.

252
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:21,562
Gave up everything...

253
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:25,017
...the three kids, the house,
and the insurance.

254
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,773
I owned a piece of the rock,

255
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:30,525
and the two cars,
and the Betamax, and...

*** The Betamax was a consumer-level product for analog recording and playback of VHS format tapes released by Sony on May 1975 and now it’s only history after the great revolutionary vast development in the field in Video and audio Media recording, storage and playback ***

256
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:32,651
Now Celia's left me...

257
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:33,496
That's tough.

258
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:38,282
...for some phony doctor...
Dr. Zuckerbrot or...

259
00:26:39,573 --> 00:26:41,273
He runs this fancy clinic.

260
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,975
“Institute for Sexual Fullfilment”

261
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:49,476
What the fuck is that?

262
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,077
That's a racket!
That's what that is!

263
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,478
She came up here
to investigate it.

264
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,379
What is she, with the FBI?

265
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:59,055
No, she's with CBS.
Their research department.

266
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:00,352
You know "60 minutes"?

267
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:01,982
They were going to expose
the whole set-up.

268
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,964
Next thing I know,
she's not coming home.

269
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:05,284
She falls for that quack.

270
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:07,924
She walks out on me,
walks out on her job.

271
00:27:08,156 --> 00:27:10,086
I get a nervous breakdown
and ulcers.

272
00:27:10,187 --> 00:27:12,000
The whole thing
is in my suicide note.

273
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:14,188
- Do you want to read it?
- No.

274
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:17,280
Now, look...

275
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,063
You want to hang yourself,
it's okay with me.

276
00:27:19,191 --> 00:27:21,132
Go out in the country,
find yourself a tree,

277
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:22,444
but don't make waves
around here.

278
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,158
I'm tryin' to work next door.

279
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:26,867
I could drown myself,
but he turned off the water.

280
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,492
Listen, you give me
any more trouble

281
00:27:29,592 --> 00:27:32,146
and I'm gonna strangle you
with my bare hands.

282
00:27:32,246 --> 00:27:33,606
That's another solution.

283
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,498
You makin' it very difficult
for me to like you.

284
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:27,153
Now what is it?!

285
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:28,722
- I had an idea.
- As?

286
00:28:28,884 --> 00:28:30,705
- Why don't you call her?
- Call who?

287
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:33,442
My wife. Tell her
that I tried to kill myself.

288
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:35,707
- Here's the number.
- I don't even know your wife.

289
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:37,258
Well, tell her you're a friend of mine.

290
00:28:37,358 --> 00:28:39,120
I'm nobody's friend.

291
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:42,010
Tell her that my life
is hangin' by a thread

292
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:44,909
and that I'm slippin' fast
and then she'll have to come.

293
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:49,356
Look, I don't seem to be
getting through to you.

294
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:50,629
I'm a very busy man,

295
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:52,264
so don't bug me,
don't hassle me.

296
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:53,640
Get off my back!

297
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:57,646
- You mean you're not going to call?
- No.

298
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:00,667
Okay, the deal is off.

299
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:01,606
What deal?

300
00:29:01,768 --> 00:29:03,519
You don't call her,
I'm gonna do it again.

301
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:05,220
- Oh, you are?
- And again and again!

302
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:07,221
I got razor blades,
I got sleeping pills.

303
00:29:07,322 --> 00:29:09,086
- You got a handkerchief?
- A handkerchief?

304
00:29:09,503 --> 00:29:10,823
Well, yeah.

305
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:15,200
What are you gonna 
Do with that?

306
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:16,450
Ooh! Ugh!

307
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:20,572
<i>
What are you doing to me?! 
Are you crazy?!
</i>

308
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:34,327
Now, is everything checked out?
Roof tops? Sewers? Air traffic?

309
00:29:34,428 --> 00:29:35,301
Yes, sir.

310
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:37,229
Let's see...12:20.

311
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,530
Now here's the game plan.

312
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:40,720
At 1 o'clock we throw
up the road blocks.

313
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:41,733
Right.

314
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:44,133
They are liable to try some
kind of a stunt, a diversion.

315
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:47,684
I don't care if a frigging bomb
goes off in the next block!

316
00:29:47,784 --> 00:29:49,334
Nobody leaves his post, you understand?

317
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:50,631
Roger.

318
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:52,387
Bird watcher 1 to
bird watcher 2.

319
00:29:52,487 --> 00:29:54,661
- How's the canary?
<i>
- Doing just fine.
</i>

320
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:58,239
Keep him on ice, we'll
pick him up at 1:45 sharp.

321
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,570
Over and out.

322
00:30:31,574 --> 00:30:32,987
<i> The maid! </i>

323
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,227
I come to mop up.

324
00:30:49,568 --> 00:30:51,646
Madre de Dios!

** In Spanish means “Mother of God!” ***

325
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:10,650
You know, I don't have
to do this for a living.

326
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:13,151
My husband and I, we have
a catering business.

327
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:15,652
We do parties,
Mexican dinners,

328
00:31:15,945 --> 00:31:19,395
guacamole, quesadillas, chile...

*** guacamole: Traditional avocado-based Mexican Salad.
Quesadilla: Usually a Corn-made Tortilla or sometimes Wheat-made Tortilla filled with Cheese and then grilled
Chile is an alternative to the word “Chili which means the hot pepper sauce***

329
00:31:19,557 --> 00:31:23,378

330
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:26,204
All that for $7 a head.

331
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:29,806
My mother-in-law, she cooks.
My husband and I do the serving.

332
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:31,877
Our son Philippe...
he parks the cars.

333
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:33,336
And we have two
cousins and an uncle,

334
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,212
they're the Mariachi Band.

***El Mariachi is a traditional folklore Mexican musician***

335
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:41,742
#Cucurucucu Paloma...#

336
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,912
So, if you ever plan
to have a party,

*** Yellow pages are the pages of Ads in Newspapers and magazines

337
00:31:57,012 --> 00:32:01,843
we're in the Yellow Pages
under "Tijuana gourmet."

338
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,578
You think you can remember that
or shall I write it down?

339
00:32:17,174 --> 00:32:18,772
<i>
Thank you.
Thank you..
</i>

340
00:32:21,782 --> 00:32:24,029
<i>
Wait! Come back!
Come back!
</i>

341
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:25,372
Have a nice day.

342
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:27,247
<i>
Son of a bitch!
</i>

343
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,969
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-ahh!

344
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,363
Hey! Where are you?

345
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,777
What the hell do you think you're
doing? Are you crazy or something?

346
00:34:17,877 --> 00:34:21,274
Not at all. I know
exactly what I'm doing.

347
00:34:21,575 --> 00:34:24,575
Come on back, I promise
not to tie you up again.

348
00:34:25,776 --> 00:34:28,776
I know why you did that..
because you're a good person.

349
00:34:28,977 --> 00:34:30,877
You didn't want me to
hurt myself. Right?

350
00:34:32,478 --> 00:34:33,689
Come on back!

351
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,428
Hey!

352
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:47,028
Jesus Christ! All those cops
down there. They'll see ya!

353
00:34:47,144 --> 00:34:49,020
Oh, good. I want 'em to see me.

354
00:34:49,136 --> 00:34:51,482
- Listen you lunatic...
- I am gonna stay up here

355
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,393
until they bring my wife.

356
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:55,184
And if they don't, I jump.

357
00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:57,385
Just come in here for a minute.
Let's talk it over.

358
00:34:57,486 --> 00:35:00,336
I don't want to talk to you.
I want to talk to my wife.

359
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:03,864
All right, all right, I'll call.
I'll fix it up. Okay?

360
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,439
But first come in here.

361
00:35:05,948 --> 00:35:08,889
First you fix it up,
then I'll come in.

362
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,382
What's the God damn number?

363
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:16,392
It's on the folder
in my room, Okay?

364
00:35:24,104 --> 00:35:25,167
Hey, Lieutenant.

365
00:35:25,267 --> 00:35:26,693
- There's a guy up there on the ledge.
- Where?

366
00:35:26,994 --> 00:35:29,594
Third floor, don't you see him?
Last window on the right.

367
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,927
- We better check it out.
- No, you don't.

368
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:34,965
This may be a diversion.
You know what Hubris said...

369
00:35:35,127 --> 00:35:36,797
“Nobody leaves his post”.

370
00:35:45,398 --> 00:35:46,497
Outside line.

371
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,813
Hey, psst, what's her name?

372
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,152
Celia. Celia Clooney.

373
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:03,032
Dr Zuckerbrot's clinic.
Ecstasy is our business.

374
00:36:04,103 --> 00:36:05,255
What kind of shit is that?

375
00:36:06,552 --> 00:36:08,845
Listen, let me talk
to Mrs Clooney, fast.

376
00:36:09,215 --> 00:36:12,064
Mrs Clooney?
She's in ultrasound stimulation…

377
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:13,314
She can't be disturbed.

378
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,607
It's an emergency,
for Christ's sake!

379
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:18,208
A matter of life and death!
So don't jerk me around!

380
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:20,559
You're a very vulgar man.

381
00:36:20,933 --> 00:36:23,666
I'll let you talk
to Dr Zuckerbrot himself.

382
00:36:25,612 --> 00:36:26,885
87,

383
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,057
88,

384
00:36:32,214 --> 00:36:33,508
101,

385
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:37,097
105,

386
00:36:43,817 --> 00:36:45,217
Zuckerbrot here.

387
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:48,518
Repeat that, please.

388
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,436
What?

389
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:52,844
You are speaking too fast.

390
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:54,605
Okay, doc,
I'll slow it down..

391
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,063
There's a guy here
name of Clooney,

392
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:58,352
standing on the ledge
of the Ramona Hotel.

393
00:36:58,452 --> 00:37:01,181
He's threatening to jump
unless he can see his wife.

394
00:37:01,425 --> 00:37:02,941
I do not know the gentleman.

395
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:05,442
What did you say his 
name was? Mr Clooney?

396
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:07,758
Yeah, like in Mrs Clooney.

397
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:09,981
You know, the dame
you've been balling.

398
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,927
That is neither
here nor there,

399
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,930
but I will under no circumstances..

400
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,031
permit his wife to see him.

401
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:16,905
This is emotional blackmail.

402
00:37:17,346 --> 00:37:20,310
And I will absolutely
not allow her to submit to it.

403
00:37:20,495 --> 00:37:23,034
So my advice
to Mr Clooney is... jump!

404
00:37:24,154 --> 00:37:25,543
Wait a minute, doc.

405
00:37:25,836 --> 00:37:27,280
Hey, doc!

406
00:37:27,437 --> 00:37:28,531
How are we doin'?

407
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,815
Hello, Mrs Clooney.

408
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,270
Did the doctor
explain the situation?

409
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,887
Yes, I'm afraid he means it.

410
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:40,758
You will? Thank you.
I knew you would.

411
00:37:40,897 --> 00:37:42,657
You sure sound
like one terrific lady.

412
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:43,792
Well?

413
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:45,135
It's all set, she'll see ya.

414
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,145
Oh, Celia? She will? Swear?

415
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,197
Who would lie
about a thing like that?

416
00:37:50,297 --> 00:37:51,273
Come on in!

417
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:53,349
When is she gonna come?
I better get some fresh ice.

418
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:56,050
Don't bother! She wants you
to come to see her.

419
00:37:56,251 --> 00:37:57,251
Oh.

420
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,852
It's better than nothing.

421
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:01,322
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

422
00:38:01,454 --> 00:38:03,731
So take it easy,
relax. I'll drive ya.

423
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:07,524
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
- You'll need some moral support.

424
00:38:07,624 --> 00:38:08,956
I don't want to keep you
from your business.

425
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,021
That's all right. I think
I just have time to make it,

426
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:12,160
but we better step on it.

427
00:38:12,284 --> 00:38:14,360
Let me change my shirt.
Be back in a minute.

428
00:38:55,257 --> 00:39:00,861
#Cecilia. Da da-dee da-da da daa#

429
00:39:01,093 --> 00:39:02,528
That's right, no water.

430
00:39:26,235 --> 00:39:28,998
#Cecilia#

431
00:40:04,476 --> 00:40:05,587
How are you comin'?

432
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:06,953
Almost ready.

433
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,928
#Cecilia#

434
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:21,667
Oh, I'll bring these
flowers along.

435
00:40:21,768 --> 00:40:22,724
Can't hurt.

436
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:25,219
You know, it is a lucky thing
I wound up next door to you.

437
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:27,587
You know what they say...
the kindness of strangers?

438
00:40:27,703 --> 00:40:28,721
Let's get a move on, huh?

439
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:30,372
I promise you, after this..

440
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:31,623
I'll never make
any more trouble for you.

441
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,376
That's for sure.

442
00:40:47,676 --> 00:40:49,776
What's with all these policemen?
What are they doing?

443
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,949
Blowing the tax payers' money..

444
00:40:52,178 --> 00:40:55,778
just to protect some
god damn stool pigeon.

445
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:57,229
Oh, yeah, yeah.

446
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,614
I've been seeing that
in the news.

447
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:02,204
Yeah, once we get out of town,

448
00:41:02,304 --> 00:41:05,182
it's about..7 miles
on the road to Elsinore.

449
00:41:10,962 --> 00:41:12,884
Can I ask you a question,
Mister, uh...

450
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:14,285
I don't even know your name.

451
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:15,199
Trabucco.

452
00:41:15,338 --> 00:41:16,536
Oh, Trabucco.

453
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:18,303
What kind of name is that?

454
00:41:18,673 --> 00:41:21,574
My mother was Turkish,
my father was Brazilian.

455
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:23,050
I was born in Detroit.

456
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:24,291
Is that a fact?

457
00:41:24,532 --> 00:41:26,084
Close enough.

458
00:41:26,385 --> 00:41:28,052
You ever been married,
Mr Trabucco?

459
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:31,109
Once, but I got rid of her.
Now I just lease.

460
00:41:31,294 --> 00:41:32,545
Oh.

461
00:41:32,985 --> 00:41:34,188
Why did you get rid of her?

462
00:41:34,288 --> 00:41:36,296
Because she was a pain in the ass,

463
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:39,816
always getting on my nerves,
interfering with my work.

464
00:41:40,187 --> 00:41:43,637
Yeah, I know. People like...
What line of work are you in?

465
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,467
Pest control.

466
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:49,607
Oh.. like ants and cockroaches 
and termites?

467
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,886
Something like that.

468
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:53,688
I spray them, I poison them,
I shoot them.

469
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,813
You shoot termites?

470
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:56,905
Coyotes, I shoot coyotes...

471
00:41:57,006 --> 00:41:58,875
and skunks and rats.

472
00:42:00,707 --> 00:42:02,807
I guess...somebody
has to do these things.

473
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,210
Are you from L.A.?

474
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:11,867
Not necessarily.

475
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:13,512
Oh. I am.

476
00:42:13,913 --> 00:42:15,713
I'm in television... CBS.

477
00:42:16,014 --> 00:42:17,514
That's where I met Celia.

478
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:18,715
How about that?

479
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:20,516
I started out in the legal department.

480
00:42:20,717 --> 00:42:24,217
I'm in Standards and Practices,
what you'd call..Censorship.

481
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:27,318
I have to read every script
and see every foot of film..

482
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:29,719
You'd be surprised at what
some of these so-called creators..

483
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,720
try to sneak past you...
all the sex and violence.

484
00:42:32,821 --> 00:42:34,421
There's a lot of that
going around.

485
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:37,422
But not through
the Iron Duke.

486
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:42,223
You know, just last week,
we had three new shows come in.

487
00:42:42,324 --> 00:42:44,658
Every one of them
had a girl in a wet T-shirt.

488
00:42:44,774 --> 00:42:45,475
So?

489
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:47,226
Well, I'm not against
a little cleavage

490
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:48,527
if it's done in good taste,

491
00:42:48,628 --> 00:42:50,328
but nipples are a definite no-no.

492
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:51,404
Everybody's got 'em.

493
00:42:51,504 --> 00:42:53,852
Not in prime time.

494
00:42:55,731 --> 00:42:58,231
We had a sitcom on Christmas Eve.

495
00:42:58,437 --> 00:43:00,869
Do you know what one of 
the characters was named?

496
00:43:01,725 --> 00:43:04,018
Señor Cajones.

497
00:43:04,203 --> 00:43:05,034
What's wrong with that?

498
00:43:05,135 --> 00:43:07,785
Cajones is Spanish for testicles.

499
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,205
No shit?

500
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:12,687
You sure we're goin'
in the right direction?

501
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:13,787
Trust me.

502
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:15,139
Sunnyvale?

503
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,148
Nothing but a lot of
rocks and sage brush.

504
00:43:17,287 --> 00:43:19,511
It's a short cut.
We're almost there.

505
00:43:19,673 --> 00:43:22,429
We are? Uh!

506
00:43:22,776 --> 00:43:24,976
Oh, getting
that nauseous feeling again.

507
00:43:25,694 --> 00:43:27,844
Don't worry. You'll
handle it okay.

508
00:43:28,045 --> 00:43:31,245
You know the truth is I've never
been that very good with women.

509
00:43:31,446 --> 00:43:33,915
I guess I just don't have
the killer instinct.

510
00:43:44,847 --> 00:43:46,281
What are we stopping here for?

511
00:43:46,443 --> 00:43:47,948
This looks like a
good spot for it.

512
00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:49,024
For what?

513
00:43:49,124 --> 00:43:52,070
Don't you think you'd better
up chuck before you see her?

514
00:43:52,351 --> 00:43:55,174
You're right. I gotta
be at my best.

515
00:43:56,752 --> 00:43:59,296
Over there. Over there
behind the rock.

516
00:44:00,053 --> 00:44:01,936
Always thinking of me.

517
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:09,068
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

518
00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:04,207
Do you suppose there's a law
against puking on private property?

519
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,060
Hey, there!

520
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:12,261
Is this your car?

521
00:45:12,868 --> 00:45:14,188
What about it?

522
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,463
We got a very pregnant 
woman in there.

523
00:45:16,664 --> 00:45:18,964
And that heap ain't gonna
make it to the maternity ward.

524
00:45:19,165 --> 00:45:20,672
She needs a lift, Okay?

525
00:45:20,788 --> 00:45:25,266
No, it's not okay, ‘cause
I got a very sick man here myself.

526
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:26,693
- Right?
- No, not any more.

527
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:28,685
I'm feeling much better now.

528
00:45:29,169 --> 00:45:32,645
Come on! Let's move it 
Before this lady pops!

529
00:45:34,497 --> 00:45:36,535
You heard him. She's gonna pop!

530
00:45:37,462 --> 00:45:42,070
Damn busybodies! Why aren't
they out trying to catch crooks?

531
00:45:55,733 --> 00:45:57,725
Is it safe to leave my car here?

532
00:45:58,165 --> 00:45:59,462
Who's gonna steal it?

533
00:46:00,434 --> 00:46:02,843
I think you better
back her in.

534
00:46:10,716 --> 00:46:12,777
There's a clinic
just down this road.

535
00:46:12,878 --> 00:46:14,445
They'll have nurses and stuff.

536
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,508
I don't care what you say, I think
that people are basically decent.

537
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:33,781
Now take you for instance...

538
00:46:33,882 --> 00:46:35,732
First, you save my life,
and now you're helping..

539
00:46:35,832 --> 00:46:37,383
to bring a new life
into the world.

540
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,335
You really ought to
name the kid after him.

541
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,185
Unless it's a girl,
of course.

542
00:46:42,286 --> 00:46:45,186
But a lot of girls have 
boys' names these days.

543
00:46:46,055 --> 00:46:48,000
I know one called Bruce.

544
00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:51,289
Is this your first one?

545
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:52,390
Yeah.

546
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:55,712
Hold tight, Jenny.
Everything's gonna be cool.

547
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:58,487
Did you... did you get
the hash out of the trunk?

548
00:46:58,587 --> 00:46:59,904
Shh!

549
00:47:00,894 --> 00:47:03,894
#Hush little baby,#
#don't say a word#

550
00:47:04,095 --> 00:47:07,345
#Papa's gonna buy you#
#a mockingbird.#

551
00:47:07,445 --> 00:47:08,596
Sing. Ah, sing.

552
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,697
First babies are
very unpredictable, you know.

553
00:47:11,798 --> 00:47:14,398
I mean you always read
about them being born in taxis.

554
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:17,874
planes and buses, escalators.

555
00:47:18,823 --> 00:47:22,073
I wouldn't be surprised if she
had it right here in the car.

556
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,663
Shut up!

557
00:47:48,998 --> 00:47:51,036
Oh oh oh! This is it!
Dr. Zuckerbrot's.

558
00:47:51,175 --> 00:47:52,472
Just dumb luck.

559
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:55,946
Wait a... wait a s... will you
wait a second, officer?

560
00:47:56,108 --> 00:47:58,205
You've got to understand 
Something..This is a sex clinic!

561
00:47:58,306 --> 00:48:00,106
We don't deal with the
finished product here!

562
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:03,703
I don't give a shit!
Get her out of my car!

563
00:48:11,484 --> 00:48:15,236
Hey, man, that was beautiful. And I
want... you know, like, uh, thank you.

564
00:48:15,398 --> 00:48:17,737
- Okay?
- Glad to do it anytime, aren't we?

565
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,460
#And if that looking#
#glass gets broke,#

566
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,716
#papa's gonna buy#
#you a billy goat.#

567
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:26,074
What a mess.

568
00:48:30,844 --> 00:48:33,596
Uh... Look, I know that
you're in a hurry...

569
00:48:33,696 --> 00:48:36,726
but you wouldn't possibly consider
coming in with me, would you?

570
00:48:36,842 --> 00:48:37,768
Just for a minute?

571
00:48:37,884 --> 00:48:41,034
And, uh, you speak to her
first. Sort of break the ice?

572
00:48:41,149 --> 00:48:42,122
No!

573
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,218
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

574
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,319
I've got to learn to
stand on my own two feet.

575
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,598
It's always been
my problem.

576
00:48:50,721 --> 00:48:51,825
That's...

577
00:48:52,219 --> 00:48:53,922
no spine. No...

578
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:55,855
cojones.

579
00:49:01,724 --> 00:49:03,424
She said she
thinks she's in love.

580
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:04,625
She really said that?

581
00:49:04,726 --> 00:49:06,927
- Hmm.
- That's an improvement.

582
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,527
Well, I think she's 
starting to open up...

583
00:49:19,684 --> 00:49:20,528
Yes?

584
00:49:20,678 --> 00:49:21,628
I'm here to see Mrs Clooney.

585
00:49:21,728 --> 00:49:24,177
- And you are..?
- Victor... Clooney.

586
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:25,427
Are you a relative?

587
00:49:25,636 --> 00:49:28,383
Am I? About the closest 
Relative that you can have.

588
00:49:28,483 --> 00:49:31,784
I'm her... I'm her hus...
Where is she?!

589
00:49:31,884 --> 00:49:33,069
Uh, not so loud, please.

590
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:35,736
She's in the library,
but you're going to have to get

591
00:49:35,837 --> 00:49:37,387
written permission
from Dr. Zuckerbrot.

592
00:49:37,487 --> 00:49:39,288
Well, damn it! Did he get
written permission from me...

593
00:49:39,388 --> 00:49:40,364
before he started...

594
00:49:40,464 --> 00:49:42,440
- …fooling around with her mind?
- Look, fill this out in duplicate

595
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:43,977
and come back after lunch.

596
00:49:46,842 --> 00:49:49,243
- I'm not having lunch.
- Well, I am.

597
00:49:57,339 --> 00:49:58,311
It's a boy!

598
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:02,196
Hey! Wow! Man!
I'm a father!

599
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:03,753
Congratulations, kid.

600
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:08,148
Listen to him!
"B" flat!

601
00:50:08,249 --> 00:50:09,936
That's real heavy.

602
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,619
Uh, here... Have a joint.

603
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:16,004
Thanks.

604
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:18,273
#Happy birthday to you.#

605
00:50:18,412 --> 00:50:20,566
#Happy birthday to you.#

606
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:26,564
#Happy birthday, Elvis Junior.#
#Happy Birthday to you.#

607
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,265
...which brings us
to today's subject...

608
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,557
premature ejaculation.

609
00:51:06,881 --> 00:51:08,364
Premature ejaculation

610
00:51:08,503 --> 00:51:11,420
means always having 
to say you are sorry.

611
00:51:11,745 --> 00:51:13,597
There are many 
schools of thought

612
00:51:13,852 --> 00:51:17,696
on how to pace yourself
and maintain self-control.

613
00:51:17,882 --> 00:51:22,119
Some advocate keeping a bucket
of ice water beside the bed

614
00:51:22,305 --> 00:51:25,863
and dipping your toes into it
at the critical moment.

615
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,349
Others recommend

616
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:30,265
that you concentrate
on something prosaic.

617
00:51:30,827 --> 00:51:35,269
Try to think of the names
of the Seven Dwarves

618
00:51:35,369 --> 00:51:36,431
in "Snow White."

619
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,468
Try to remember
your Social Security number...

620
00:51:48,195 --> 00:51:50,206
Excuse me, could you tell me
where the library is?

621
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:53,892
Sorry, not now.
My fiancée has a slow leak.

622
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:22,862
Celia?

623
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:25,572
Celia!

624
00:52:28,907 --> 00:52:31,778
- Hi.
- Victor!

625
00:52:32,033 --> 00:52:33,450
What are you doing here?

626
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:35,151
You said you 
wanted to see me.

627
00:52:35,251 --> 00:52:36,178
I said?

628
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,703
He said that you said it.

629
00:52:37,804 --> 00:52:38,754
Who's he?

630
00:52:38,854 --> 00:52:40,601
Come on. Pack your things.
We're going to go home.

631
00:52:40,717 --> 00:52:41,319
You've had your fun.

632
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,757
Fun? You think
I'm doing this for fun?

633
00:52:43,857 --> 00:52:46,758
This has been the most 
Meaningful experience of my life.

634
00:52:46,858 --> 00:52:48,637
Looking at dirty pictures?

635
00:52:48,776 --> 00:52:52,760
Is that what you think it is?
This is basic scientific research..

636
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,211
Oh, Come off it, will ya?
First you were into ferns,

637
00:52:55,312 --> 00:52:56,287
and then it was whales.

638
00:52:56,387 --> 00:52:58,919
Are you aware, for instance,
that a woman has 89

639
00:52:59,035 --> 00:53:00,964
different erogenous zones
in her body?

640
00:53:01,064 --> 00:53:02,064
Oh, 89!

641
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:07,266
Who says so?!
That pygmy doctor of yours?!

642
00:53:07,366 --> 00:53:08,567
To me, he's a giant.

643
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:10,268
He's a giant!
He's a giant phony!

644
00:53:10,368 --> 00:53:11,100
Quiet!

645
00:53:11,285 --> 00:53:14,170
I am afraid you have been
totally brainwashed.

646
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:15,220
Not totally.

647
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,052
I've only reached
the fourth plateau.

648
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:18,048
The fourth what?

649
00:53:18,186 --> 00:53:21,058
Dr. Zuckerbrot's
theory of sexual awareness.

650
00:53:21,313 --> 00:53:24,068
A few lucky ones make it all
the way up to the ninth plateau.

651
00:53:24,231 --> 00:53:25,551
What's happening up there?

652
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,248
The ultimate orgasm.

653
00:53:27,415 --> 00:53:29,528
Oh, I knew it. I knew that
was coming! The "o" word!

654
00:53:29,629 --> 00:53:32,529
That's when the earth moves
and the sky bursts open

655
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,323
and the white-hot
flames consume you...

656
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:36,226
That's enough! I don't
want to hear it any more!

657
00:53:36,342 --> 00:53:37,657
I don't want to 
hear any more, either!

658
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:40,831
I'm trying to write a paper on the
pros and cons of circumcision.

659
00:53:40,931 --> 00:53:42,386
The pros and cons of...

660
00:53:43,336 --> 00:53:45,235
You ought to be 
locked up... all of ya!

661
00:53:45,437 --> 00:53:47,237
You're nothing but a 
bunch of damned perverts!

662
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:48,313
Please!

663
00:53:48,413 --> 00:53:49,989
Sexual deviants! Animals!

664
00:53:50,089 --> 00:53:51,182
People are studying here.

665
00:53:51,282 --> 00:53:53,841
Studying?! They're nothing
but a pack of wild dogs in heat!

666
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:54,891
That's all you are!

667
00:53:55,007 --> 00:53:58,828
Frontal nudity! Consenting adults!
Premature ejaculation!

668
00:53:58,991 --> 00:54:00,945
Up yours, buster!

669
00:54:01,046 --> 00:54:03,046
Excuse him, he's going 
Through a stress situation.

670
00:54:03,647 --> 00:54:05,058
Ah.

671
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:07,548
Tums. Where are my tums?

672
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:08,972
What have you been eating?

673
00:54:09,157 --> 00:54:11,843
It's not what I'm eating,
it's what's eating me!

674
00:54:14,483 --> 00:54:17,169
Victor, you must really learn
to deal with your hostility.

675
00:54:17,331 --> 00:54:19,802
It's poisoning your system
and corroding your mind.

676
00:54:19,902 --> 00:54:21,384
You're not living, Victor.

677
00:54:21,546 --> 00:54:25,529
You're just using up time,
using up space, using up air.

678
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:36,455
What plateau are they on?

679
00:54:36,556 --> 00:54:39,656
Wake up, Victor. You can't just
bleep out what's happening today.

680
00:54:39,757 --> 00:54:42,057
You've got to go
with the flow!

681
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:47,992
What happened
to your wedding ring?

682
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:50,959
I had it melted down and 
made into a charm for Hugo.

683
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:52,531
Hugo?

684
00:54:52,647 --> 00:54:53,911
Dr. Zuckerbrot.

685
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,962
He wears it on a chain 
around his neck.

686
00:54:56,063 --> 00:54:59,455
This son of a bitch is wearing
my wedding ring around his neck?!

687
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:02,860
I have no more use for it.

688
00:55:04,713 --> 00:55:07,565
You might as well know, Victor,
I'm filing for divorce.

689
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:08,666
Divorce?

690
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:12,123
Celia, what happened to us?

691
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:14,114
Where has all the magic gone?

692
00:55:14,323 --> 00:55:17,241
We've been together
for 12 years.

693
00:55:17,403 --> 00:55:18,538
That long?

694
00:55:19,001 --> 00:55:21,071
Well, maybe they 
weren't 12 great years,

695
00:55:21,172 --> 00:55:23,472
but we had a few 
good weeks here and there.

696
00:55:23,573 --> 00:55:26,624
That’s what we’ll do, let's the two of us g
o back to the hotel, huh? It's all set up.

697
00:55:26,828 --> 00:55:30,510
I got a bucket of ice water
and I'll set it next to the bed, hmm?

698
00:55:31,737 --> 00:55:34,794
What kind of a crazy idea is that?

699
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,327
Well it's not my crazy idea!

700
00:55:36,427 --> 00:55:37,805
It's your crazy doctor's
crazy idea!

701
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:40,329
How shall we handle this?
your lawyer or mine?

702
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,180
No.

703
00:55:45,081 --> 00:55:46,281
No? What do you mean 'no'?

704
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,527
There will be no lawyers
and no divorce.

705
00:55:49,106 --> 00:55:50,681
You're gonna give 
Me a hard time?

706
00:55:50,797 --> 00:55:54,334
There will be no divorce because
a widow doesn't need a divorce.

707
00:55:54,594 --> 00:55:56,698
Victor, stop making empty threats.

708
00:55:56,798 --> 00:55:58,045
Empty threats?

709
00:55:59,587 --> 00:56:01,079
Read that after I've gone.

710
00:56:03,348 --> 00:56:05,386
Don't bother with flowers.
You can use these.

711
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:18,689
They couldn't save her.
She's gone.

712
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,690
I know how you feel.

713
00:56:26,135 --> 00:56:28,034
<i>
Here are the headlines
at 1 o'clock.
</i>

714
00:56:28,792 --> 00:56:31,692
<i>
As the hour approaches
for Rudy Disco Gambola

715
00:56:31,793 --> 00:56:33,393

to testify before 
the Grand Jury,

716
00:56:33,494 --> 00:56:36,494

the police exercising every
possible precaution

717
00:56:36,595 --> 00:56:37,570

718
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,696
<i>around the entire civic center.</i>

719
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,797
<i>
Motorists are advised to
use alternate routes.
</i>

720
00:57:04,878 --> 00:57:06,036
Come on.

721
00:57:06,152 --> 00:57:08,329
All right, All right.
Keep it moving, Come on.

722
00:57:09,162 --> 00:57:10,402
Come on lady.
Keep it moving.

723
00:57:10,503 --> 00:57:12,253
This is police harassment.
That's what it is.

724
00:57:12,474 --> 00:57:14,754
Look, I'm a citizen.
I'm a tax payer.

725
00:57:14,854 --> 00:57:17,796
I've got a driver's licence.
I can go anywhere I want!

726
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:18,866
Where do you want to go, lady?

727
00:57:18,981 --> 00:57:21,007
J.C. Penney.
I've got this girdle.

728
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:22,083
It's too tight.

729
00:57:22,183 --> 00:57:24,146
- I'm going to exchange it.
- Did you ever think of going on a diet?

730
00:57:24,331 --> 00:57:26,110
A diet? What kind of diet?

731
00:57:26,211 --> 00:57:28,661
The 14-day diet
at the county jail.

732
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,796
Now, move your car.

733
00:57:29,912 --> 00:57:32,760
All right.
All right, officer. Okay.

734
00:57:38,851 --> 00:57:40,101
Good afternoon, father.

735
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,371
And a good afternoon 
to you, officer.

736
00:57:42,765 --> 00:57:44,516
What, uh.. seems to be
the trouble?

737
00:57:44,617 --> 00:57:45,667
Just a routine check.

738
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,651
May I ask where 
you're going, father?

739
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:50,406
Oh, it is a very sad mission
I'm on. Very sad.

740
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,718
I'm off to administering last rites
to one of me parishioners.

741
00:57:53,857 --> 00:57:56,428
Poor soul, barely 40 years old.

742
00:57:56,636 --> 00:58:00,272
Ah, well that's the breaks.
The lord giveth, the Lord taketh away.

743
00:58:00,423 --> 00:58:02,726
For His is the power
and the glory.

744
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:04,324
Ain't that the truth?

745
00:58:05,325 --> 00:58:06,710
Pass him through.

746
00:58:08,122 --> 00:58:09,651
Bless you my son.

747
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,300
What is it, Celia?
What can be so important?

748
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:21,476
I saw him.

749
00:58:21,576 --> 00:58:22,665
He's going to do it!

750
00:58:22,851 --> 00:58:24,303
Who is going to do what?

751
00:58:24,404 --> 00:58:26,510
Victor, he's going to kill himself.

752
00:58:26,672 --> 00:58:27,805
That's his problem.

753
00:58:27,906 --> 00:58:30,632
It's our problem too.
Look at this.

754
00:58:32,114 --> 00:58:33,807
He blames you
for the whole thing.

755
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:36,908
A warped mind.
Nobody will take this seriously.

756
00:58:37,009 --> 00:58:38,909
You don't know those guys
from "60 minutes." They get hold..

757
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:41,469
..of something like this and
Mike Wallace will crucify you.

758
00:58:41,794 --> 00:58:43,183
Who pays attention
to that foolishness?

759
00:58:43,368 --> 00:58:47,212
Only 50 million people! Look what
they did to the Shah and Dr. Kissinger!

760
00:58:47,313 --> 00:58:50,872
Kissinger? I don't even 
Think he is a real doctor.

761
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:54,994
Hugo, I'm thinking about us.

762
00:58:55,295 --> 00:58:56,915
We can't let
anything like this happen,

763
00:58:57,016 --> 00:59:00,042
now that we've reached
the fourth plateau.

764
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:04,998
Please, schatzi, before it's too late.

*** Mein Schatzi in German means: My love ***

765
00:59:06,434 --> 00:59:10,818
All right. You get the car.
I get my bag.

766
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:35,265
#Aya yaya yaya yaya ay...#

767
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,347
Muchas gracias.

**Many Thanks in Spanish***

768
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:44,294
Room 359... would you
prepare my bill, please?

769
01:00:44,394 --> 01:00:45,522
You're checking out?

770
01:00:45,622 --> 01:00:46,625
You could say that.

771
01:00:48,726 --> 01:00:49,903
Lighter fluid.

772
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:52,227
- Butane or regular?
- Regular.

773
01:00:52,497 --> 01:00:54,228
- What size?
- The largest.

774
01:00:55,044 --> 01:00:56,229
How many of those
have you got?

775
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:59,050
Hmm, about a dozen.

776
01:00:59,235 --> 01:01:00,416
I'll take them all.

777
01:01:03,132 --> 01:01:05,048
You are a heavy smoker,
aren't you?

778
01:01:48,836 --> 01:01:50,206
Oh, shit.

779
01:02:07,921 --> 01:02:09,056
Are you okay?

780
01:02:09,195 --> 01:02:11,038
Fine. Care for a little
warm champagne?

781
01:02:11,534 --> 01:02:13,039
How did it go
with your wife?

782
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,444
- It's all settled.
- Good for you.

783
01:02:15,544 --> 01:02:17,023
She never wants
to see me again.

784
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:18,574
She. Women.

785
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:19,743
Go figure them.

786
01:02:19,894 --> 01:02:21,932
I once knew a guy, he
had two heart attacks.

787
01:02:22,045 --> 01:02:24,989
So they put in one of them
gadgets, uh, pacemaker.

788
01:02:25,151 --> 01:02:27,246
So his wife divorced him,
because she said..

789
01:02:27,347 --> 01:02:30,523
it was interfering
with the TV reception.

790
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,848
Are you leaving?

791
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,249
Yeah. I didn't want
this to go to waste.

792
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:36,550
Are you sure you won't join me?

793
01:02:36,651 --> 01:02:38,951
I'd better not.
I gotta keep a clear head.

794
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:42,218
I want you to know 
I..I'm very grateful

795
01:02:42,404 --> 01:02:44,465
to you for everything
that you did.

796
01:02:44,604 --> 01:02:47,054
You just may be the nicest
person that ever lived.

797
01:02:47,155 --> 01:02:49,555
I don't have to stand here
and listen to that kind of talk.

798
01:02:49,656 --> 01:02:50,648
Well, I mean it.

799
01:02:51,007 --> 01:02:52,356
I'm 48 years old

800
01:02:52,457 --> 01:02:55,707
and in this whole stupid,
miserable world

801
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:57,410
the only friend that I've got is

802
01:02:57,572 --> 01:02:59,409
somebody that I met
two hours ago.

803
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:00,536
Now, isn't that pathetic?

804
01:03:00,675 --> 01:03:01,711
Don't let it
get you down.

805
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,014
Oh, I screwed up again.

806
01:03:03,153 --> 01:03:04,663
- What's the matter?
- I forgot to get matches. I..I..

807
01:03:04,764 --> 01:03:06,414
You wouldn't
happen to have any...

808
01:03:06,514 --> 01:03:08,549
- Here you are. Keep them.
- ...matches. Thank you.

809
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:12,066
You sure? Maybe just 
half a glass? Huh?

810
01:03:12,267 --> 01:03:13,193
Bon voyage?

811
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:15,380
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to kill myself.

812
01:03:15,569 --> 01:03:16,395
Not again?

813
01:03:16,495 --> 01:03:18,923
Oh, yes, but don't worry.
You don't have to tie me to a chair.

814
01:03:19,085 --> 01:03:20,171
- I'm not going to do it here.
- You sure now?

815
01:03:20,272 --> 01:03:22,050
- Oh, a word of honor.
- That's my boy.

816
01:03:22,188 --> 01:03:24,273
This time, I'm gonna give them
something to remember me by.

817
01:03:24,374 --> 01:03:26,774
I'm gonna set myself on fire!

818
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:28,875
- What!?
- Oh, I'm gonna climb up there,

819
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:30,926
I'm gonna douse myself
with all of that fluid,

820
01:03:31,026 --> 01:03:34,377
light a match, and...
pa-wheww!... human torch!

821
01:03:34,532 --> 01:03:36,241
They'll see me
for miles around.

822
01:03:36,341 --> 01:03:38,979
- You're gonna climb up where?
- Up the fire escape to the roof,

823
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,480
- And when I jump...
- You're gonna jump from this roof?!

824
01:03:41,581 --> 01:03:43,081
You talk about your
ninth plateau?

825
01:03:43,182 --> 01:03:45,182
I'll show them
some white-hot flames!

826
01:03:45,283 --> 01:03:47,183
Are you out
of your fucking mind?!

827
01:03:47,284 --> 01:03:49,978
Nobody's gonna 
stop  me this time!

828
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:53,243
Open up you crazy bastard!

829
01:03:54,007 --> 01:03:56,138
I ain't got time
for this kind of shit.

830
01:03:57,782 --> 01:03:59,612
Apocalypse now!

831
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:03,822
Wait a minute!

832
01:04:03,922 --> 01:04:05,517
Ah! Ooh!

833
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:14,849
You hurt?

834
01:04:43,056 --> 01:04:45,325
All right, take it easy.

835
01:04:46,622 --> 01:04:48,451
Just take it easy.

836
01:04:53,697 --> 01:04:55,931
Ah! Don't... don't worry.

837
01:04:56,232 --> 01:04:57,691
I won't leave you alone...

838
01:04:58,317 --> 01:04:59,706
Buddy.

839
01:05:01,601 --> 01:05:03,701
We're ready just about
ready to pick up Gambola.

840
01:05:03,802 --> 01:05:05,658
- … Alert the choppers to stand by.
- Yes, sir.

841
01:05:07,302 --> 01:05:08,154
Come in.

842
01:05:08,254 --> 01:05:09,130
MacCluskey here.

843
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:11,030
Observed man climbing
out on fire escape.

844
01:05:11,192 --> 01:05:13,253
Alley side of hotel.
Third floor.

845
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:14,434
I read you.

846
01:05:14,573 --> 01:05:16,797
I wonder if it's the same guy
who was out on the ledge before?

847
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:18,060
What guy? What ledge?

848
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,015
Somebody clowning around
up there, but he went back in.

849
01:05:20,178 --> 01:05:21,289
What do you mean,
clowning around?

850
01:05:21,405 --> 01:05:22,863
- Did you check him out?
- Of course not.

851
01:05:22,963 --> 01:05:24,230
You told us not to 
leave our posts.

852
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:26,592
- In case it was a diversion.
- Jesus Christ!

853
01:05:26,754 --> 01:05:29,418
Do I have to do everything 
around here myself?

854
01:05:39,218 --> 01:05:40,858
Parks the car.
See you upstairs.

855
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,243
Anything you say, schatzi.

*** Mein Schatzi in German means my love ***

856
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,920
Are these all the people you got
registered on the third floor?

857
01:05:46,021 --> 01:05:47,421
Yes, captain.
Something wrong?

858
01:05:47,522 --> 01:05:49,472
Oh, just that one of your
guests keeps climbing around

859
01:05:49,572 --> 01:05:51,223
on the outside
of the building, that's all.

860
01:05:51,324 --> 01:05:52,483
That's very unusual.

861
01:05:52,598 --> 01:05:55,325
I bet it's that guy in 359
who tried to hang himself.

862
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:56,535
Hang himself?

863
01:05:56,698 --> 01:05:57,647
I saw it.

864
01:05:57,786 --> 01:05:58,928
And you didn't
report it?

865
01:05:59,029 --> 01:06:01,229
359... Victor Clooney.

866
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:02,371
That's the joker.

867
01:06:04,531 --> 01:06:06,790
Victor Clooney.
What room is he in?

868
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:07,767
Who are you?

869
01:06:07,906 --> 01:06:10,233
I'm doctor Zuckerbrot.
I must see him immediately.

870
01:06:10,334 --> 01:06:11,309
What's the trouble?

871
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:13,835
I am sorry, but the 
confidential relationship…

872
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:14,886
…between doctor and patient...

873
01:06:14,986 --> 01:06:16,057
Come on.

874
01:06:16,312 --> 01:06:18,373
The trouble is
he's a fruitcake

875
01:06:18,651 --> 01:06:20,457
with suicidal tendencies.

876
01:06:20,828 --> 01:06:22,490
He's in room 359.
Let's go.

877
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:25,529
Please. In his condition,
it is better I see him alone,

878
01:06:25,645 --> 01:06:27,742
or he may flip out altogether.

879
01:06:28,007 --> 01:06:30,230
Okay, doc, you handle it.

880
01:06:33,744 --> 01:06:35,344
Tell him to keep away
from the windows

881
01:06:35,445 --> 01:06:38,127
or he's liable
to get his ass shot off.

882
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,504
Sorry, I have no brandy.

883
01:06:42,619 --> 01:06:43,322
Your mouth.

884
01:06:43,422 --> 01:06:45,148
Open your mouth.

885
01:06:45,649 --> 01:06:46,649
Oh, my head.

886
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,650
I'll get you a cold 
compress, okay?

887
01:06:53,451 --> 01:06:54,751
I keep forgetting.

888
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:04,967
Relax, Mr Clooney.

889
01:07:06,153 --> 01:07:07,953
You are in good hands.

890
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:28,078
Who invited you here?

891
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:32,256
I'm a doctor. Quick!
Help me pull down his pants.

892
01:07:32,357 --> 01:07:33,451
His pants?

893
01:07:33,729 --> 01:07:35,258
I'm going to give 
Him an injection.

894
01:07:35,396 --> 01:07:36,786
Wrong end...
he hurt his head.

895
01:07:36,924 --> 01:07:38,499
Do not tell me
my business.

896
01:07:39,461 --> 01:07:40,931
What are you
gonna give him?

897
01:07:41,255 --> 01:07:43,617
A shot of Thorazine,
to quiet him down.

898
01:07:43,895 --> 01:07:45,724
We don't want him jumping
out of the ambulance.

899
01:07:45,887 --> 01:07:46,906
What ambulance?

900
01:07:47,139 --> 01:07:48,865
To take him to the
psychiatric ward.

901
01:07:48,966 --> 01:07:49,941
Psychiatric ward?

902
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:50,866
That's the law.

903
01:07:51,042 --> 01:07:53,868
Anybody who is suicidal has to 
be locked up for observation.

904
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:55,590
Suicidal? Him?

905
01:07:56,099 --> 01:07:57,628
Born loser

906
01:07:58,371 --> 01:07:59,471
Misfit.

907
01:08:00,772 --> 01:08:02,282
His wife walked out on him.

908
01:08:03,649 --> 01:08:05,848
Oh! Ah, really?

909
01:08:06,057 --> 01:08:07,624
From the way
she described him,

910
01:08:07,724 --> 01:08:09,875
I somehow thought
he would be a lot homelier.

911
01:08:09,976 --> 01:08:10,951
Is that so?

912
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:13,097
Although, I must say...

913
01:08:13,815 --> 01:08:16,078
he's better equipped than
I would have expected.

914
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:17,713
She discussed it with you?

915
01:08:17,813 --> 01:08:19,234
You are a friend of Mr Clooney?

916
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:22,383
No, no, no. Just met him this morning. 
Next door neighbours.

917
01:08:23,634 --> 01:08:24,732
Well...

918
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,825
from what she told me
about their sex life...

919
01:08:27,987 --> 01:08:29,884
not that there's
that much to tell...

920
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:30,985
Go on, go on.

921
01:08:31,786 --> 01:08:34,032
Imagine, for 12 years,

922
01:08:34,217 --> 01:08:37,181
every Wednesday and
Saturday night like clockwork.

923
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:40,288
and during all that time,
not one orgasm.

924
01:08:40,389 --> 01:08:41,535
That's a lie!

925
01:08:41,674 --> 01:08:45,286
Of course. Like any
good wife, she faked it.

926
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:49,191
For 12 years?

927
01:08:58,764 --> 01:08:59,895
How is he?

928
01:08:59,995 --> 01:09:00,941
Under sedation.

929
01:09:01,168 --> 01:09:02,794
Help me with the strait jacket.

930
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:07,981
Who's that?

931
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,199
What do you mean, "who's that"?
That's your husband.

932
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,100
Try again, doc.
You're not even warm.

933
01:09:12,335 --> 01:09:13,284
Who's he?

934
01:09:13,423 --> 01:09:16,502
Tell him, big mouth.
You told him everything else...

935
01:09:16,603 --> 01:09:17,603
how great I was
in the sack.

936
01:09:17,704 --> 01:09:18,679
Victor!

937
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:19,680
What else did you tell him?

938
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:20,656
that I cheat on crossword puzzles, hmm?

939
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:23,150
I steal sugar
in restaurants?

940
01:09:23,312 --> 01:09:25,208
that I wet my bed
till I was 11?

941
01:09:25,309 --> 01:09:27,409
No, Victor, believe me.
I never mentioned that.

942
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:28,710
A bed wetter.

943
01:09:29,008 --> 01:09:31,411
Aha! That explains everything.

944
01:09:31,512 --> 01:09:34,636
I'll kill him, so help me!

945
01:09:34,914 --> 01:09:36,326
Look what you did
to my best friend!

946
01:09:36,465 --> 01:09:37,715
They ought to get you
for malpractice...

947
01:09:37,816 --> 01:09:38,866
sticking a needle
up the wrong guy.

948
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,217
Victor, we were doing it
for your own good!

949
01:09:41,318 --> 01:09:43,760
My own good?! You were going to
put me in a nut house.

950
01:09:44,061 --> 01:09:45,635
I admit I made a mistake...

951
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,789
but that's easily corrected.

952
01:09:49,021 --> 01:09:52,221
If you will be so kind
as to drop your trousers.

953
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:54,822
Wouldn't you like that?

954
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:58,023
I drop my pants, you drop
your pants, she drops her pants.

955
01:09:58,124 --> 01:10:00,827
I've heard of that...
ménage a trois!

*** ménage a trois is a French expression literally means “A Household of three” and it refers to romantic or sexual relationship with three persons ***

956
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:02,525
Victor, you're running amok!

957
01:10:02,726 --> 01:10:05,088
You are one sick doctor and 
you ought to be horse whipped!

958
01:10:05,204 --> 01:10:08,608
..and have your cojones
cut off and be deported!

959
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:10,391
Don't you touch him!

960
01:10:11,529 --> 01:10:13,429
There it is,
your wedding ring.

961
01:10:18,103 --> 01:10:20,118
Oh my God. It's the 'p' word.

962
01:10:20,465 --> 01:10:22,202
You know what
your problem is, Victor?

963
01:10:22,341 --> 01:10:24,101
You should have
been born a man!

964
01:10:24,309 --> 01:10:25,833
Celia, I may have
loved you once.

965
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:27,482
Right now, I don't 
Even like you much.

966
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,535
Now get the hell out of
here before I lose my cool!

967
01:10:29,636 --> 01:10:32,716
Good idea. I have a lecture
on sex at the condominium.

968
01:10:32,878 --> 01:10:35,337
Here, take this with you,
you little geek!

969
01:10:38,181 --> 01:10:40,288
You can always go back
to your first wife.

970
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:41,538
Out!

971
01:10:42,697 --> 01:10:43,901
Oh.

972
01:10:48,231 --> 01:10:49,690
What time is it?

973
01:10:50,742 --> 01:10:51,751
You mean right now?

974
01:10:51,913 --> 01:10:53,419
Is it 2:00 yet?

975
01:10:54,067 --> 01:10:55,248
20 minutes off.

976
01:10:55,873 --> 01:10:57,147
Jesus!

977
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:00,899
What happened here?

978
01:11:01,037 --> 01:11:02,473
We had to take
your pants down.

979
01:11:03,075 --> 01:11:03,793
Who?

980
01:11:03,909 --> 01:11:05,249
Me and the doctor.

981
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:07,150
What for?

982
01:11:07,336 --> 01:11:10,201
- So he could give you a shot.
- Why?

983
01:11:10,301 --> 01:11:11,458
He thought you were me.

984
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:15,257
You? You son of a bitch!

985
01:11:18,035 --> 01:11:19,193
You'll feel better
tomorrow.

986
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:22,044
Tomorrow? I got 20 minutes.

987
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,056
- I got to get ready.
- For what?

988
01:11:24,242 --> 01:11:26,785
Coffee... I need black coffee.

989
01:11:26,885 --> 01:11:27,738
I'll call downstairs.

990
01:11:27,877 --> 01:11:29,659
Shower, cold shower.

991
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,374
Oh, wait, no, not in there.

992
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:32,861
Here. Here.

993
01:11:39,757 --> 01:11:40,753
Ah.

994
01:11:50,363 --> 01:11:51,663
Room service, please.

995
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:56,570
Ah..this is room 361. Would 
you send up a pot of coffee?

996
01:11:56,894 --> 01:11:59,974
No, no cream, no sugar.
Just black, hot, and strong.

997
01:12:03,957 --> 01:12:05,879
Feeling better, are we? Huh?

998
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,566
Hit me.

999
01:12:09,052 --> 01:12:11,414
Hit you? Why?
You're my buddy.

1000
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:13,770
Hit me!

1001
01:12:14,425 --> 01:12:15,571
Okay.

1002
01:12:18,572 --> 01:12:19,774
Harder!

1003
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:24,267
Again!

1004
01:12:26,027 --> 01:12:27,926
Again! I got to wake up!

1005
01:12:28,065 --> 01:12:29,675
20 minutes to go.

1006
01:12:30,774 --> 01:12:33,676
You got a date
or something? Huh?

1007
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:04,607
Possible straight.

1008
01:13:04,746 --> 01:13:06,378
- Possible nothin'.
- You're right.

1009
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:08,938
Queensies, pair of 10s.

1010
01:13:09,656 --> 01:13:11,280
All right, break it up!

1011
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:13,681
Let's get this show
on the road.

1012
01:13:13,782 --> 01:13:14,866
Where is he?

1013
01:13:21,443 --> 01:13:23,083
Hey, Gambola!

1014
01:13:24,593 --> 01:13:26,075
Where the hell are you?

1015
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:30,892
At a time like this,
you're dancing?

1016
01:13:31,008 --> 01:13:34,041
Who's dancing? I'm trying to
keep from freezing my balls off.

1017
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,487
Let's go.

1018
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,308
Well, are you ready
for your finest hour?

1019
01:13:42,563 --> 01:13:44,643
To tell you the truth,
I'm scared shitless.

1020
01:13:44,743 --> 01:13:47,144
Well, you should be.
But I've got it all worked out.

1021
01:13:47,244 --> 01:13:49,891
I'm gonna save that 
miserable life of yours.

1022
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,386
Well, I'm sure 
Glad to hear it.

1023
01:13:51,549 --> 01:13:52,993
I need a volunteer.

1024
01:13:53,633 --> 01:13:54,894
Get out of here.

1025
01:13:55,207 --> 01:13:56,295
Lee!

1026
01:13:57,454 --> 01:13:59,746
Nah, too short.
Kowalski, you try it.

1027
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:05,258
Good, you two change clothes.

1028
01:14:06,323 --> 01:14:07,713
What's the gag?

1029
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:09,499
If they're gonna
pick off anybody,

1030
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,136
it's gonna be the guy 
in civilian clothes.

1031
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:13,151
Clever?

1032
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:14,602
Yeah, I like it.

1033
01:14:17,022 --> 01:14:19,222
Personally, I think it stinks.

1034
01:14:22,812 --> 01:14:25,004
What time is it now?

1035
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:26,605
12 minutes to 2:00.

1036
01:14:34,854 --> 01:14:37,540
That lighter fluid.
Where is it?

1037
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:38,906
What do you want
with that?

1038
01:14:39,485 --> 01:14:40,620
Get it!

1039
01:14:41,384 --> 01:14:42,519
Hurry!

1040
01:14:50,138 --> 01:14:52,175
Open it! Open it up! Quick!

1041
01:15:01,712 --> 01:15:02,812
Ah.

1042
01:15:23,462 --> 01:15:24,805
I need help.

1043
01:15:35,226 --> 01:15:36,914
Hey, that's a gun!

1044
01:15:39,232 --> 01:15:42,127
Well, what are you 
gonna... do with that?

1045
01:15:45,554 --> 01:15:47,384
You're gonna shoot
across the street?

1046
01:15:48,866 --> 01:15:50,279
You're gonna kill
that witness!

1047
01:15:51,618 --> 01:15:53,497
You killed the other 
two, didn't you?

1048
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:56,416
What is this,
20 questions?

1049
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,197
You're a killer.

1050
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,731
- Give it to me.
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

1051
01:16:09,916 --> 01:16:12,302
Come on, you stupid asshole.

1052
01:16:12,423 --> 01:16:13,641
I'm not gonna let 
you kill anybody.

1053
01:16:13,741 --> 01:16:14,926
You keep saying
we're buddies.

1054
01:16:15,026 --> 01:16:16,007
That's why.

1055
01:16:16,169 --> 01:16:17,763
So now you want 
Me to get killed.

1056
01:16:17,863 --> 01:16:18,927
Well, if you're worried
about the cops...

1057
01:16:19,028 --> 01:16:20,328
Screw the cops!

1058
01:16:20,569 --> 01:16:24,529
It's the people I work for... I'm talkin'
about the guys with the pinky rings.

1059
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:27,350
I got a contract and if I don't
deliver, you know what happens?

1060
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:30,631
I wind up on fisherman's wharf,
all chopped up for bait.

1061
01:16:30,832 --> 01:16:33,074
Why don't we get out of here
right now? I'll hide you.

1062
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:34,208
Give me that gun.

1063
01:16:34,308 --> 01:16:36,849
I got a cousin in Colorado, he has
a ski lodge and it's out of season.

1064
01:16:36,965 --> 01:16:40,091
- What we do is get a couple of canned goods...
- Asshole.

1065
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:05,537
Hey, Gambola.

1066
01:17:06,398 --> 01:17:08,923
A suit like this...how 
much it set you back?

1067
01:17:09,038 --> 01:17:10,798
Oh, like $700, $800.

1068
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,276
Shame to get blood all over it.

1069
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:16,611
Don't worry.
I got three more like that.

1070
01:17:18,394 --> 01:17:19,830
Okay, you're gonna 
Shoot that guy,

1071
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:22,076
then you'll have to shoot me, too,
because I'll be a witness.

1072
01:17:22,331 --> 01:17:23,257
Where does it end?

1073
01:17:23,373 --> 01:17:24,878
You gonna kill everybody
in the world?

1074
01:17:24,994 --> 01:17:27,246
Don't you ever 
Stop yakking?!

1075
01:17:42,947 --> 01:17:45,147
Son of a bitch.
I don't think I can do it.

1076
01:17:45,248 --> 01:17:45,998
Good.

1077
01:17:46,207 --> 01:17:49,349
I can't focus. I can't see a
god damned thing out there.

1078
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:50,653
I'm a dead man.

1079
01:17:50,951 --> 01:17:51,951
Don't say that.

1080
01:17:52,274 --> 01:17:55,152
This was gonna be enough 
money to retire on..

1081
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:56,228
…because in this line of work,

1082
01:17:56,328 --> 01:17:59,154
you don't qualify
for social security.

1083
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,703
I loused it up
for you, didn't I?

1084
01:18:00,935 --> 01:18:02,106
I had my island
all picked out.

1085
01:18:02,206 --> 01:18:04,607
On a clear day,
you can see Tahiti.

1086
01:18:04,779 --> 01:18:07,651
I came this close,
but no cigar.

1087
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:11,171
Listen, this guy that you
were gonna.. knock off...

1088
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:12,120
who is he?

1089
01:18:12,259 --> 01:18:15,571
A hood. A mobster.
A no-good fink.

1090
01:18:16,288 --> 01:18:17,377
Maybe I could help.

1091
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:19,663
Yeah, pray for an earthquake.

1092
01:18:19,924 --> 01:18:20,966
Let me do the job.

1093
01:18:21,082 --> 01:18:24,788
- You?... 
- Yeah. I have nothin' to lose. Besides, I owe you one.

1094
01:18:24,996 --> 01:18:26,266
What are you gonna do...

1095
01:18:26,367 --> 01:18:29,217
walk across the street
and throw up all over him?

1096
01:18:29,317 --> 01:18:30,768
I know how
to handle a gun!

1097
01:18:30,869 --> 01:18:32,519
I used to be able
to hit a milk bottle

1098
01:18:32,619 --> 01:18:35,185
with a BB gun from 200 feet.

1099
01:18:35,348 --> 01:18:37,071
Well, this is no BB gun,

1100
01:18:37,172 --> 01:18:38,983
and it's more like 200 yards,

1101
01:18:39,122 --> 01:18:41,484
and we're not talking 
about any milk bottle.

1102
01:18:41,623 --> 01:18:43,574
I know what I'm doing.

1103
01:18:44,379 --> 01:18:45,475
One thing... the safety catch...

1104
01:18:45,576 --> 01:18:46,976
is it on or off?

1105
01:19:02,878 --> 01:19:04,278
Okay, bring him out.

1106
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:28,773
Here they come.

1107
01:19:28,935 --> 01:19:30,181
What do you see?

1108
01:19:32,038 --> 01:19:34,182
A lot of cops... and one civilian.

1109
01:19:34,307 --> 01:19:35,210
That's him!

1110
01:19:35,743 --> 01:19:37,410
All right, it's all set up for you.

1111
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:39,785
As soon as he reaches
the eighth step...

1112
01:19:39,935 --> 01:19:40,954
Za-ping!

1113
01:19:42,575 --> 01:19:43,887
Nervous time.

1114
01:19:46,002 --> 01:19:47,368
They're on the first step...

1115
01:19:47,484 --> 01:19:49,406
Second.. Third..

1116
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:50,772
Fourth...

1117
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:53,158
Five..Six..

1118
01:19:54,092 --> 01:19:55,092
Seven...

1119
01:19:55,293 --> 01:19:56,293
Now!

1120
01:19:59,688 --> 01:20:00,777
Oh my God!

1121
01:20:00,985 --> 01:20:01,673
What's the matter?

1122
01:20:01,773 --> 01:20:03,199
I think I shot a cop.

1123
01:20:04,945 --> 01:20:06,600
You fuckup!

1124
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:10,873
Third floor. Last window
on the right.

1125
01:20:35,303 --> 01:20:37,403
They got the son of a bitch.

1126
01:20:39,704 --> 01:20:41,954
Must be a real pro up there.

1127
01:20:42,054 --> 01:20:43,054
Yeah.

1128
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,427
All right! Let's
smoke him out!

1129
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:08,648
The fire escape.

1130
01:21:08,748 --> 01:21:10,708
This way, piss brain.

1131
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:24,610
You take the elevator!

1132
01:21:38,665 --> 01:21:40,212
359... let's get him!

1133
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,813
Stay close together.

1134
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,235
- There's nobody in here!
- Search the whole floor!

1135
01:21:52,351 --> 01:21:54,065
What now? they'll find us!

1136
01:21:54,216 --> 01:21:56,265
In there, you turkey!

1137
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:02,448
All the way down?
Oh, no!

1138
01:22:02,633 --> 01:22:03,884
Oh, yes!

1139
01:22:09,094 --> 01:22:11,873
Yoooooaaahh!

1140
01:22:12,684 --> 01:22:15,120
Wooooaaah!

1141
01:22:26,161 --> 01:22:27,134
We made it!

1142
01:22:27,273 --> 01:22:28,922
Not yet!

1143
01:22:33,109 --> 01:22:35,623
You'd better drive, shit head.

1144
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:40,218
- Have I done something to offend you?
- Get in there.

1145
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,665
You wouldn't have
a spare dickie, would you?

1146
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:10,856
Stop that car!

1147
01:23:11,031 --> 01:23:12,199
Stop it!

1148
01:23:12,685 --> 01:23:14,445
Oh, Christ!

1149
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:18,151
I'm sorry.

1150
01:23:22,481 --> 01:23:24,234
Boy, am I glad I caught you.

1151
01:23:24,426 --> 01:23:25,538
Are you, now?

1152
01:23:25,677 --> 01:23:27,336
I've got a dying 
Man over here.

1153
01:23:27,437 --> 01:23:28,938
I don't know what 
denomination he is,

1154
01:23:29,038 --> 01:23:32,254
but just to be on the safe side,
would you mind saying a few words?

1155
01:23:32,462 --> 01:23:35,056
Of course, my son.
That goes with the job...

1156
01:23:35,287 --> 01:23:39,109
to give light in darkness,
comfort in despair,

1157
01:23:39,271 --> 01:23:41,494
tranquility in stress.

1158
01:23:41,702 --> 01:23:43,601
He's right up here
on those steps.

1159
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:49,553
Psst. I'll wait for you.

1160
01:23:49,793 --> 01:23:51,694
Get out of here.Beat it!

1161
01:23:51,794 --> 01:23:53,049
What about you?

1162
01:23:53,397 --> 01:23:55,620
Never mind.
Save your own ass.

1163
01:23:55,759 --> 01:23:57,102
Will I see you again?

1164
01:23:57,311 --> 01:23:59,534
You heard me. Fuck off.

1165
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:03,795
Father,

1166
01:24:04,099 --> 01:24:05,462

It's Latin.

Gambola on you.

11 hundred dollars.

They moved them out when
they started testing the A-bomb.

There's lots of radiation

And man eating turtles.

Well, I guess you're stuck with me.

But there's no need
to get emotional about it. Huh?

1242
01:29:22,099 --> 01:29:23,813
Lunch... it is ready!

1243
01:29:24,531 --> 01:29:26,893
Just a minute. There'll
be one more for lunch...

1244
01:29:27,032 --> 01:29:29,236
...and dinner, and breakfast.
Where can I wash up?

1245
01:29:29,337 --> 01:29:33,400
Oh, when you fix my bed, would you put 
a board under the mattress? bad back, you know.

1246
01:29:33,538 --> 01:29:35,692
When does the rainy season start?

1247
01:29:38,842 --> 01:29:40,039
Tell me, Tatupu.

1248
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:43,840
Didn't you guys use to have
human sacrifices around here?

1249
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:46,641
tossing people
into that volcano?

1250
01:29:46,742 --> 01:29:49,147
Yes, but not for 200 years.

1251
01:29:49,865 --> 01:29:52,806
Ever think of reviving the custom?

1252
01:29:52,991 --> 01:29:56,344
Well, for that you must have
a leap year, and a full moon,

1253
01:29:56,465 --> 01:29:57,745
and a virgin.

1254
01:29:58,549 --> 01:30:01,421
We don't have to be that neat.

1255
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:15,200
See you in coming movies and subtitles
