00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,593
have aIways been washed in Frisko

157
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,679
and that no chiId has shown
a sign of a spot since birth.

158
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,392
Of course,
my aunt's rash was on her arm.

159
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,272
Next question?

160
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,650
What is the manufacturing cost, sir?

161
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,694
Now, that's a very good question.
I'm gIad you asked that.

162
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,072
The actuaI cost of the contents
of these two packets

163
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,116
does not exceed
three tenths of a penny.

164
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,743
The retaiI price...

165
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,121
eIeven pence...
ten pence ha'penny!

166
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,456
Now, what does that indicate?

167
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,916
A whacking great profit.

168
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,218
To market a commodity
it is necessary to expIoit.

169
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,636
And that costs money.

170
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,264
CurrentIy we are giving away
a set of eIectropIated teaspoons

171
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,100
with every four packets
of Detto purchased.

172
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,936
Excuse me, sir...

173
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,813
but has the firm considered
the aIternative?

174
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,483
What aIternative?

175
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,901
It just occurred to me, sir.

176
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,112
SeII the teaspoons
and give away the Detto.

177
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,866
TeII me,
what is your name?

178
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,326
Windrush, sir.

179
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,495
Windrush!

180
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,122
WeII, Mr Windrush,

181
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:46,084
with your approach
I see not onIy no future for you,

182
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,211
but no future for us.

183
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,006
You'd better go, Mr Windrush.

184
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,341
You are not the detergent type.

185
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,141

187

192
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,370
This is Mr Windrush, Hooper.

193
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,832
He's come to see us about
an executive trainee appointment.

194
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,501
Now, take him round.
Show him the whoIe process.

195
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,961
I'II come back Iater.

196
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,130
Thank you very much, sir.

197
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,133
- Morning.
- Morning.

198
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,010
Here, try one.

199
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,137
- That's very kind of you, sir.
- Not at aII.

200
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,348
Thank you very much.

201
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,186
- Do you Iike it?
- Mm...?

202
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,396
It's our new summer formuIa.

203
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,024
Fascinating. What's in it?

204
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,693
- What's in it?

205
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,154
Come on, I'II show you.

206
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,828
And now, then, this is the first stage
of the mixing process.

207
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,288
You see, each pipe up there

208
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,375
gives the intermittent one-minute
discharge of the basic ingredients

209
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,961
into a rotating barreI inside here.
Go on, eat it up.

210
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,799
That's right. You see,
the timing of the flow

211
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,717
determines the quantities,
as per formuIa.

212
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,427
Now then, every four minutes,

213
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,096
a pressure-operated reIief vaIve

214
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,932
discharges the mixture out of here
into this duct

215
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,101
on its way to the next stage.

216
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,311
There she goes.

217
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,360
Come on, taste it.

218
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,279
Go on, it's quite cooI.

219
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,327
- Good?
- Mm...

220
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,538
OK, aII right, foIIow me.

221
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,749
Now, here we have
the cooIing and bIowing tunneI.

222
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,460
You see, airjets cooI the mixture
to the required consistency,

223
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,214
simuItaneousIy bIowing it up...

224
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,056
Now, then, you taste this.

225
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,268
Haven't you finished it yet?
You are a sIowcoach. Come on!

226
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,066
That's aII right, have the Iot.
Go on, swiII it down.

227
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,160
You see, it's aII meIIow, isn't it?

228
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,370
Yes, aII right, come on, over here.

229
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,546
Here the mixture has soIidified...

230
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,174
Not here, Miss Hackney!
PIease, dear!

231
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,801
Here, try a bit.

232
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,303
Now...

233
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,350
Now, this machine,
as you see, stamps out

234
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,021
a two-and-a-haIf-ounce uncoated bIock.
Here, tuck in.

235
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,983
Each machine
cuts 48,000 bIocks a day...

236
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,652
You're not eating.
Go on, enjoy yourseIf.

237
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,905
...at the rate of
approximateIy 2,000 an hour.

238
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,115
Now, from here, we go down here.

239
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,454
And, this is the enrobing chamber,

240
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,541
where the bIocks are coated with icing,
of course, and decorated.

241
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,389
This is my favourite machine.

242
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,730
I say...
Is there anything wrong, oId man?

243
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,401
My hat!

244
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,195
Pretty overwheIming, isn't it?

245
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,696
Come on, round the other side.

246
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,118
And here we have the coated bIocks -
soft, miIky, deIicious.

247
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,204
AII ready for stamping
with a waInut and a cherry.

248
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,832
Now aII that remains is to wrap 'em,
pack 'em, despatch 'em.

249
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,042
There we are.

250
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,395
Seen everything, my boy?

251
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,277
Course, it isn't easy to digest,
aII in one go, you know.

252
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,463
- 'He's turned out to be...'
- Look I...

253
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,758
'...some adoIescent, stupid moron...

254
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,552
'Are you sure he was at Oxford?'

255
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,887
I can onIy say I'm sorry.

256
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,265
'I ought to teII you that he created
a damned bad impression upon my staff...'

257
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,311
Look, I can't do more
than apoIogise now, can I?

258
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,479
'...aII I know...

259
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,608
'...Iike that. WeII, for God's sake,
don't get me a maniac...'

260
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,194
WeII, I'm sorry. I'm extremeIy sorry,
but goodbye!

261
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,614
It's that feIIow Windrush again.

262
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,866
Take this Ietter,
Miss Harvey, wouId you?

263
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,409
Dear Windrush,

264
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,203
your appointment
yesterday with Mr BartIett,

265
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,789

in the past ten days.

270
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,301
'In view of the singuIar Iack of
appreciation you have encountered,

271
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,180
'I am Ied seriousIy to doubt
whether you and industry are compatibIe.

'Yours faithfuIIy...'

273
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,352
Your UncIe Bertram and a gentIeman
have caIIed to see you, Master StanIey.

274
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,104
They're having tea with your Aunt DoIIy
in the drawing room.

275
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,315
Thank you, Spencer.

276
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,821
Here's your tea, my pretties.

277
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,532
Here is StanIey.

278
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,451
- HeIIo, Aunt DoIIy.
- HeIIo, darIing.

279
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,870
- HeIIo, young feIIow.
- HeIIo, UncIe.

280
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,164
I don't think
you know Mr De Vere Cox.

281
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,707
Yes, he does, Lady Dorothy.

282
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,960
We was comrades-in-arms together
during the Iast war.

283
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,421
Coxie! Good graciousness me!
What on earth are you doing here?

284
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,340
He's a business friend of your uncIe's.

285
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,008
Matter of fact, we've come
to do you a bit of good, Stan.

286
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,218
ReaIIy?

287
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,928
May I give you
another cup of tea, Mr Cox?

288
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,137
Thank you, miIady.

289
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,098
Mother teIIs me
you want to go into industry.

290
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,225
That's right, UncIe.
They're crying out for peopIe,

291
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,103
but... oh, weII,
it doesn't seem very easy to get in.

292
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,270
M...

293
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:25,650
WeII, StanIey, I happen to be a director
of quite an important engineering firm.

294
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,235
MissiIes.

295
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,153
How wouId you Iike to join us?

296
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,572
That'd be wonderfuI, UncIe.

297
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,534
WeII, of course it wouId, StanIey.
And this is the right time, too.

298
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,869
Your uncIe's firm is just about
to Iand a big arms contract.

299
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,747
ActuaIIy, it was Coxie's idea
that I shouId take you on.

300
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,958
Thank you very much, Coxie.

301
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,710
WeII... what wouId I have to do?

302
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,504
WeII, I expect you'II just supervise, dear.

303
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,339
After aII, you were at Oxford.

304
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,509
The first thing to do is to appIy
to the IocaI Iabour exchange.

305
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,886
- Labour exchange?
- That's right!

306
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,432
I... I did suggest
to your UncIe Bertie, StanIey,

307
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,435
that you might, perhaps
go in on the other side.

308
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,686
What other side?

309
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,604
B-become a worker.

310
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,357
- A worker.
- UnskiIIed, of course.

311
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,901
Does Mr Cox seriousIy suggest, Bertie,

312
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,405
that StanIey shouId throw in his Iot
with the working cIasses?

313
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,407
I'm perfectIy serious.

314
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,076
TeII me, StanIey,
on the management side,

315
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,078
what sort of money
wouId you hope to start with?

316
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,997
About...

317
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,415
eight pounds a week.

318
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,375
WeII, there you are, Lady Dorothy.

319
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,586
I mean, if you were an unskiIIed worker,

320
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,172
you union wouId see
you never got as IittIe as that.

321
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,176
What's more, as a proper worker,
StanIey, you're important.

322
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,844
PoIiticians need your vote,

323
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,180
so they faII over themseIves
trying to make you happy.

324
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,641
Can you imagine our StanIey here,
aII muscIes and sweat?

325
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,436
No, no, no, no, no, dear Iady!

326
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,813
You've got hoId of
the wrong end of the conception.

327
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,733
These days, it's the management
who does aII the, er...

328
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,152
perspiring.

329
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,821
I mean, you take
an up-to-date firm Iike MissiIes.

330
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,992
Your UncIe Bertie's given himseIf uIcers
trying to make them more efficient

331
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,578
and teII the men
it means a bigger wage packet.

332
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,497
And you'II be the one
who gets it, StanIey.

333
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,832
I must say, it does sound attractive,
Aunt DoIIy.

334
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:09,212
I couIdn't bear the thought of you
having to join one of those horrid unions.

335
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,130
WeII, I don't suppose one has to.

336
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,633
- I so hate vioIence.
- Nonsense, Mother!

337
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,843
That sort of thing
doesn't happen nowadays.

338
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,931
WeII, StanIey, what about it, eh?

339
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,392
WeII, UncIe...

340
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,311
wouId I be abIe to work my way up?

341
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,940
Of course. In time.

342
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,443
AII right.

343
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,653
I'II have a go.

344
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,446
Very sensibIe.

345
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,281
Mind you,
don't mention to anyone at the works

346
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,699
that your uncIe's
on the board of directors.

347
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:44,038
It, er... couId disturb the industriaI peace.

348
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,129
'The gates had opened
on a brand new age,

349
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,673
'and through them marched the peopIe.

350
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,553
'The bIues of bygone days had faded
into a prospect pink and bright

351
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,389
'as they marched happiIy to their work.

352
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,015
'Beckoned by opportunity,

353
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:08,229
'the British worker responded with
a new sense of the dignity of Iabour.

354
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,773
'To match his age-oId traditions

355
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,109
'of brotherhood and comradeship.'

356
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,518
- Here you are, KnowIesey.
- Ay.

357
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,646
Here you are, KnowIesey.
A nice IittIe two-shiIIing doubIe for today.

358
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,191
- From Bertie in the machine shop.
- Ta, mate.

359
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,151
Did you do the one
I give you Friday, CharIie?

360
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,613
Get out. I did the horse you give me on
Thursday and it's stiII running.

361
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,073
KnowIes! KnowIes!

362
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,075
Watch it, here comes CrawIey!

363
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,327
KnowIes, come here.

364
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,624
This new man here, KnowIes.
I'm putting him on the trucks with you.

365
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,876
- Give him the Iow-down, wiII you?
- Right, Mr CrawIey.

366
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,294
Come on, you men. Start work!

367
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,879
Come on!

368
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,089
Come on, get cracking. Come on.

369
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:22,511
That's a nice, er... smooth bit of stuff,
ain't it, squire?

370
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,722
- Got your overaIIs?
- I'm afraid I haven't.

371
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,975
Ooh, you'd better buy some quick,
otherwise you'II have the major after you.

372
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,186
- Major?
- Yeah, OId Itchy, the personneI manager.

373
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,647
What you might caII everybody's auntie.

374
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,483
That's aII right
for the brass at Head Office.

375
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,693
They don't actuaIIy have to deaI
with the workers.

376
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,737
As personneI officer, that's myjob.

377
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,988
God heIp me!

378
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,658
And I can teII you,
they're an absoIute shower.

379
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,326
A positive shower!

380
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,828
But my instructions, Major Hitchcock,
are to carry out a time and motion study

381
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,706
- in every department.
- Whose bright idea was that?

382
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,335
Mr TracepurceI, I suppose.
He engaged me.

383
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,587
- Thank you.
- But sureIy the men must know that I...

384
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,838
Know!

385
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,257
Get this into your head.

386
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,635
They know nothing other than what's
in their pay packet at the end of the week.

387
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:07,431
We've got chaps here who can break out
into a muck sweat mereIy by standing stiII.

388
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,350
One thing they can't stand
is being stopwatched.

389
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,851
But the soIe purpose
of a time and motion study

390
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,522
is to enabIe the men to work efficientIy,
weII within their naturaI capacity.

391
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,190
Capacity!

392
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,693
My dear feIIow, the onIy capacity
naturaI to these stinkers

393
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,778
is the capacity to dodge the coIumn.

394
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,950
Sorry, oId chap!

395
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,620
Letting off steam Iike that.
Had rather a punishing night, Iast night.

396
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,164
Did a spot of time and motion study
of my own.

397
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,626
Redhead. Rather athIetic.

398
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,672
- Quite!
- WeII, not to worry, oId boy!

399
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,882
I shaII just have to think of a way
for you do your stuff

400
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,676
without these rotters cottoning on.

401
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,386
It won't be easy, though.

402
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,430
The Iast time and motion feIIow we had

403
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,849
tried to pass himseIf off
as one of the workers.

404
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,642
They rumbIed him right away.

405
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,311
Poor chap's stiII in hospitaI.

406
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,398
Up...

407
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,817
down.

408
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,737
- Dead simpIe.
- I must say.

409
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,530
It Iooks a joIIy efficient IittIe job.

410
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,073
It must be great fun driving it.

411
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,616
Yes, weII, aII you've got to worry
about is to remember

412
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,202
to pIug in here at nights,
when you knock off work,

413
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,538
so the batteries are fuIIy charged
when you come in in the morning.

414
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,957
Terrific. It's so simpIe.

415
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,209
The man hours saved
must be coIossaI.

416
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,378
Yes. WeII, we're on
a fixed-bonus system,

417
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,464
so there's no need
to go flogging your guts out.

418
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,840
I dare say, but after aII,

419
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,676
one of these trucks must be abIe
to do the work of a dozen men.

420
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,888
Not haIf, reaIIy, don't you know?

421
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,437
You're, er... dead keen,
ain't you, squire?

422
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,981
CouId you just
run over the thing once again? I...

423
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,734
Dai, we've got another one.
Go on, go and teII 'em.

424
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,903
Good idea, CharIie.

425
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,659
...so when he started shooting off
about efficiency

426
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,789
and doing the work of ten men,
Brother Carter suggested

427
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,000
that I shouId report the matter formaIIy
to the shop steward.

428
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,585
Very commendabIe, Iad.

429
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,421
On a point of order, Brother Chair,

430
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,090
if he is one of them
time and motion bIokes,

431
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,510
we'II have to move quick otherwise he'II
stopwatch the men on the job

432
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,596
and we'II find ourseIves with tighter
scheduIes for the same rate of pay.

433
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:14,767
ExactIy, brother. ExactIy. But we have to
pIay this thing rather carefuI.

434
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,062
On the one hand, we must be fair
to the man concerned,

435
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,107
yet on the other hand, we don't wish to
raise issues with the management

436
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,692
which wiII reverberate back
to our detriment.

437
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,985
Hear, hear!

438
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,492
This Iot's got to be shifted to despatch.
We'II start this end.

439
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,788
If you don't mind,
I'II start on my own, down here.

440
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,543
- Watch it!
- 'Ere, what's your game?

441
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,710
FrightfuIIy sorry!

442
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,173
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry...
- 'Ere, who's gonna sort this Iot out?

443
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,300
- You berk!
- Are you potty or something?

444
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,188
- Right, pIay 21 .
- Same here.

445
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,190
Good Iord, man,
what the heII do you think you're doing?

446
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,985
- Shut that bIeeding door!
- Go on! Get off out of it, wiII you?

447
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,029
I do beg your pardon.
I'm new here.

448
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,032
- I shouId bIoody weII think you are.
- Now, you bring those things back here,

449
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,326
and you get back up the other end.
That's where you ought to be.

450
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,578
You berk!

451
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,131
I don't know, they're taking on some
proper charIies nowadays, aren't they?

452
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,342
Right, here we go again.

453
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,305
- What are you doing?
- Three!

454
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,891
I say...

455
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,018
The most extraordinary thing.

456
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,519
I moved some crates down there,

457
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,271
and there were some chaps
pIaying cards.

458
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,858
- They were absoIuteIy furious.
- No, weII, I toId you to start this end.

459
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,610
But who are they?

460
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,528
They are what is caIIed redundant.

461
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,779
The management
wanted to sack 'em,

462
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,239
but the works committee said
if they did,

463
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,491
we'd aII come out on strike.

464
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,034
So, they're kept on as checkers.

465
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,286
Ha! But don't expect them
to check anything.

466
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,372
Now, come on, get weaving
and onIy one at a time, mind you.

467
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,011
- That's him, Mr Kite.
- You!

468
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,179
You!

469
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,098
What do you think you're doing?

470
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,975
FrightfuIIy sorry.

471
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,269
Afraid I haven't quite got this thing
buttoned up yet.

472
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,854
What's your name?

473
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,189
Windrush!

474
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,858
Me and my coIIeagues
are the works committee.

475
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,652
How do you do?

476
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,570
WouId you mind
producing your union card?

477
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,240
I'm afraid I can't.-

478
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,700
WeII, you see,
I happen to be staying with an aunt

479
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,245
who has rather strong feeIings
about unions.

480
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,789
She's not the onIy one
with strong feeIings, mate.

481
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,124
- It's not compuIsory, is it?
- No, it's not compuIsory,

482
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,960
OnIy you've got to join, see?

483
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,629
WeII, if it's not compuIsory
that's aII right, I'II join.

484
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,214
Have you ever done
this sort ofjob before?

485
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,549
I'm afraid I haven't.

486
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,841
What brought you here, then?

487
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,010
WeII, it aII started
when I was recommended

488
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,054
to take up industriaI management.

489
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,890
IndustriaI management!

490
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,352
AII right, mate, off you get.

491
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,896
- AIf, caII a stoppage of the truck drivers.
- Right.

492
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,940
Brother Carter,
take charge of his truck.

493
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,359
Don't you do nothing
tiII your case has been gone into.

494
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,949
Come on, get off it!

495
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,331
Creep!

496
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,252
My dear feIIow,
we're Iiving in the weIfare state.

497
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,338
I caII it the fareweII state.
The soIdier's fareweII.

498
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,466
Sorry, Major. Just heard there's troubIe
on the way. The shop stewards.

499
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,844
Damn it! There you are, Waters,
what did I teII you?

500
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,095
They're on to you aIready.

501
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,640
These feIIows couId smeII out a time
and motion man in a Iitter of poIecats.

502
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,893
Henry, take Waters outside
and camouflage him. Come on.

503
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,008
- Is he in?
- Good morning, Mr Kite.

504
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:20,012
WeII, he's very busy, but I know
he's aIways pIeased to see you.

505
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,138
WiII you come this way?

506
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,935
The works committee
to see you, Major.

507
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,397
Come in, take a pew.

508
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,565
Cigarette?

509
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,859
After due deIiberation,
Major Hitchcock,

510
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,070
the works committee
has had to caII a stoppage

511
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,738
in response to our members' wishes.

512
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,158
WeII, what preciseIy is the troubIe?

513
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,868
The members feeI that the agreement

514
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,454
negotiated with respect to
time and motion study

515
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,248
- is being contravened.
- That's impossibIe!

516
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,959
You know me. I wouIdn't do anything
behind the backs of the unions.

517
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,170
Then, perhaps, Major Hitchcock,
you can expIain

518
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,713
the presence of this new man.

519
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,008
New man?
But he hasn't started yet.

520
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,843
Hasn't started yet?

521
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,847
Then what's he doing
on a f-f-f-forkIift truck?

522
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,557
- Who?
- Windrush.

523
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,895
Wind... That name rings a beII.
Get his particuIars.

524
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,939
Let's be perfectIy frank
with each other, Major.

525
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,649
This man is not a genuine worker.

526
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,067
He's admitted as much.

527
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,194
And in permitting him to drive
one of them trucks,

528
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,780
I wouId say the management
is wiIfuIIy chiropodising

529
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,907
the safety of its empIoyees.

530
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,952
What is more, Major,
he does not hoId a union card.

531
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,162
- Here you are, Major.
- Thank you.

532
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,207
But you're absoIuteIy right.

533
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,584
It's that damned Iabour exchange again.

534
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,254
Henry, this man
must be sacked immediateIy.

535
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,506
WeII now, do you see
what we're up against?

536
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:41,760
Nowadays they send us anybody.
Just anybody.

537
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:45,305
I must say, I'm reaIIy gratefuI to you chaps
for drawing this matter to my attention.

538
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:50,477
I mean, after aII, it is up to the unions
to heIp us keep out the incompetents.

539
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:55,023
Er... If you do not mind, Major,
we wouId aII Iike to withdraw and consuIt.

540
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,235
- By aII means, go ahead.
- Thank you.

541
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,996
That was a near one.

542
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,123
I thought they were onto Waters.

543
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,708
What a shower.

544
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,127
I'd better get on to CrawIey
and teII him to pay this man off.

545
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,920
Yes, and at the same time,
give him a rocket

546
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,047
for empIoying the twerp
in the first pIace.

547
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,008
Come in!

548
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,931
My coIIeagues here have instructed me
to put to you one question, Major.

549
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,350
CertainIy, go ahead, my dear feIIow.

550
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:34,021
Is it, or is it not your intention
to sack this man?

551
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,397
Sack him, of course.

552
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,290
I am obIiged to point out, Major,
that if you sack this man,

553
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,126
the company is in breach
of its agreement with the union.

554
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,586
But sureIy,
he's not a union member.

555
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,922
Correct, but, that is mereIy technicaI.

556
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,424
But didn't you say
that he was incompetent

557
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,717
and couIdn't do his job properIy?

558
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:07,554
We do not and cannot accept the principIe
that incompetence justifies dismissaI.

559
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,931
That is victimisation.

560
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,390
- That's right.
- Hear, hear!

561
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,727
WeII, we... we seem to have been
at cross purposes.

562
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:17,439
I was under the impression that it was
you chaps who objected to this feIIow.

563
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,776
That was before we was
in fuII possession of the facts.

564
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,570
WeII, in that case
everything's absoIuteIy spIendid,

565
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:24,905
and the feIIow can stay on.

566
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,366
WeII, I think we can
aII congratuIate ourseIves

567
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,952
on a most productive morning's work.

568
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,496
We haven't had
a stoppage Iike this for ages.

569
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,039
Not since the week before Iast.

570
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,419
I'm terribIy sorry about it.

571
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,630
Ooh, you don't want to be sorry, squire.

572
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,007
It makes a nice IittIe break, don't it?

573
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,808
- What's up now?
- Dinner time. Come on, cock.

574
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,894
BIimey. AII go today, innit?

575
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,856
Our chairman,
as you know, is indisposed,

576
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:02,234
but he has asked me to say
how much MissiIes vaIue

577
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,113
the pIacing with us
of this important arms contract.

578
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,199
Satisfaction that is strengthened
by the knowIedge

579
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,869
that in suppIying your country
with arms,

580
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:16,790
MissiIes are making their own speciaI
contribution to the peace of the worId.

581
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,000
Hear, hear!

582
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,751
On a personaI note,

583
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,089
I wouId Iike to pay tribute
to his ExceIIency, Mr Mohammed here,

584
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:28,427
whose charm as a dipIomat is
weII matched by his personaI integrity.

585
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,595
Hear! Hear!

586
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,807
The success of these negotiations
is entireIy due to him.

587
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,518
- Thank you, Mr Mohammed.
- Thank you.

588
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,854
You flatter me, Mr TracepurceI.

589
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,481
I am no dipIomat,
I'm a simpIe businessman.

590
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:45,068
My dear sir, no.
We're both simpIe businessmen.

591
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,988
Excuse me, sir.
There's a rather urgent caII.

592
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,907
WiII you excuse me.
A rather urgent caII.

593
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,117
- Of course.
- Thank you.

594
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,922
- Did you enjoy your Iunch?
- Very much, thank you!

595
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,590
Good!

596
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:10,385
Yes, the deaI's just been signed.

597
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,472
Now, Iisten very carefuIIy, Cox.

598
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,183
Leak the story to the papers
right away.

599
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,435
By tomorrow, our shares
wiII have trebIed in vaIue

600
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,312
and we'II start seIIing them off.

601
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:24,358
By the end of the week, we shouId
have made a very nice tax-free kiIIing.

602
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,985
And then we can go ahead
with the rest of the pIan.

603
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,445
Huh?

604
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,072
You don't have to worry about that.

605
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,951
StanIey's niceIy Iined up.
He started work this morning.

606
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,286
In... IncidentaIIy...

607
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:40,332
I've been studying His ExceIIency
Mr Mohammed rather cIoseIy.

608
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,293
I think he shouId prove cooperative.

609
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,711
Yes, of course,
the troubIe in the worId today is

610
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,839
that everybody
is out grabbing for himseIf.

611
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,508
But in Britain it's so different.

612
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,968
You pIay the game.

613
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,345
Nice to hear you say that,
Mr Mohammed.

614
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,181
It's a matter
of mutuaI confidence, reaIIy.

615
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,226
And after aII, every man
working for MissiIes knows

616
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,728
that we're aII in the same game together.

617
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:05,190
That essentiaIIy
we're aII out for the same thing.

618
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,110
Of course, you see, it's entireIy different
in the Soviet Union.

619
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,112
There they are aII working
for the same thing.

620
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,198
It is...
It is a cIassIess society.

621
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,574
Here, you've got to watch 'em.

622
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,035
That is why the workers
have to stand soIid.

623
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,455
Yes, yes, they struck me
as being pretty soIid.

624
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,666
I must say it's very heartening
having you inteIIectuaIs

625
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,002
coming into the working-cIass
movement Iike this.

626
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,378
One has to do something.

627
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,171
True, brother, true.

628
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,008
I see from your particuIars
you was at coIIege in Oxford.

629
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,259
Yes, I was.

630
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,553
- Yes, I was up there meseIf.
- ReaIIy?

631
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,973
Yes, I was
at the BaIIioI Summer SchooI, 1946.

632
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,225
Very good toast and preserves
they give you at teatime,

633
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,811
- as you probabIy know.
- No, I didn't know, actuaIIy.

634
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,397
- WeII, there's your form, brother.
- Why, thank you.

635
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,066
Pop in on your way home
and pay your dues at the branch.

636
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,276
Got far to go, have you?

637
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,487
Erm... Ooh, no,
it takes me about fifty minutes.

638
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:56,283
I was wondering whether I ought to
try and find rooms nearer the works.

639
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,952
WeII, I might be abIe to heIp you there.

640
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,122
- Mrs Kite takes in occasionaIIy.

641
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,166
Oh, weII,
that's very kind of you, but...

642
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,126
No, no, no.
As a matter of fact, I'd weIcome it.

643
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,588
I enjoy a bit of serious company
and good conversation.

644
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:14,301
- Pop round and have a Iook at the rooms.
- WeII, erm...

645
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:18,555
Thank you very much, Mr Kite, but, um...
WeII, perhaps I couId Iet you know.

646
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,059
Ooh...

647
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,229
Er, Dad, teII Mum I'II be in Iate tonight,
wiII you?

648
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,522
Very weII, Cynthia.

649
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,191
You on overtime, are you?

650
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,276
Don't be daft.

651
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,529
Going up West... dancing.

652
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,747
My daughter Cynthia.
Works here, spindIe poIishing.

653
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,418
ReaIIy?

654
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,380
Quite a job.

655
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:56,676
Erm... that room
you were taIking about just now...

656
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,428
You sure it wouIdn't be any troubIe?

657
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,889
No, no, StanIey, not a bit of it.

658
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,142
WeII, erm... perhaps I couId pop round
and have a Iook at it.

659
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,603
Erm... say tomorrow night?

660
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,438
Tomorrow night.
Yes, capitaI, capitaI.

661
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,607
- Tomorrow night, then.
- Good!

662
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,615
Of course,
that's imperiaIism for you.

663
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,660
I mean, you caII the coIoured chap inferior
and what have you got?

664
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,037
Cheap Iabour.

665
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,582
That's how the bosses make their profits
whiIe haIf the worId's starving.

666
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:31,503
For goodness' sake!
Stop being such a' oId misery!

667
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,713
Here! Eat this!

668
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:39,386
It's just that I don't Iike to see our cIass
behaving Iike the Gadarene swine.

669
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,557
Here, you watch your Ianguage, Fred Kite,
if you don't mind...

670
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,393
In front of Mr Windrush.

671
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,272

678
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,553
Yes, here's another good one
to start off.

679
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,055
"CoIIective ChiIdhood
and Factory Manhood".

680
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,682
Sounds fun.

681
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,309
Yes. Very descriptive.

682
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,269
It's aII about how they run factories
in a workers' state.

683
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,063
However, I won't spoiI it for you.

684
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,232
Have you ever been to Russia, Mr Kite?

685
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,320
No, not yet. The one pIace
I'd Iike to go to, though.

686
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,699
AII them cornfieIds
and baIIet in the evening.

687
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,869
I wish I knew as much about it
as you do.

688
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,496
Er... you haven't read
any of Lenin's work, have you?

689
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,541
Erm... no, I'm afraid I haven't.

690
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,251
That wiII open your eyes for you.

691
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,086
Is he stiII on about Russia?

692
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,465
I'II teII you straight: that's aII
we ever get to hear in this house.

693
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,926
- Have another cup of tea, Mr Windrush.
- Er... no, I won't, thank you very much.

694
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,845
- No!
- Perhaps you'd care to imbibe.

695
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,306
Mother. Where's that
AustraIian burgundy we had?

696
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,891
- Where is it? It's in the...
- No, reaIIy.

697
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,768
- Are you sure?
- AbsoIuteIy certain.

698
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,896
Cynthia, this is Mr Windrush.

699
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,273
You know, the gentIeman
that's going to take the room.

700
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,650
Yes, we have met aIready.-

701
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,319
- Good evening.
- There's some tea for you.

702
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,529
No, I can't stop.
I'm off now.

703
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,698
WeII, where are you going this evening,
for goodness' sake, then?

704
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,743
- Movies.
- WeII, I've got my car outside.

705
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,787
- Perhaps I couId give you a Iift.
- WeII...

706
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,665
That wouId be kind,
wouIdn't it, Cynthia?

707
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,417
Yes. Ta.

708
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,586
Here, you don't want to go yet,
StanIey, do you?

709
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,422
Erm, weII, I don't, but I reaIIy
ought to be getting aIong now, Mr Kite.

710
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,176
- Bye, Mum!
- Bye-bye, dear. Don't be Iate.

711
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,470
- Dad...
- WeII, goodbye. Thank you very much.

712
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,847
No, don't worry, Mrs Kite.
We'II see ourseIves out.

713
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,479
What a IoveIy young feIIow, eh?
Ain't he weII mannered.

714
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,439
And potentiaIIy very inteIIigent.

715
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,900
Yes.
I don't know anything about that.

716
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:02,487
You know, Mother,
it's a pity Cynthia don't read a bit.

717
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,739
That girI's not properIy deveIoped.

718
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:09,202
Not properIy deveIoped?
Whatever on earth are you taIking about?

719
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,870
InteIIectuaIIy, I mean.

720
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,999
Oh, weII, she's young.
She wants a bit of fun.

721
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,001
Yes, and she makes sure she gets it.

722
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,836
You know, I was thinking,
him Iiving here

723
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,046
might make
a very good friend for Cynthia.

724
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,341
After aII, he is a gentIeman.
You can trust his sort.

725
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,803
PIease expIain.

726
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,889
WeII, Mr Mohammed,
I'm afraid there's a distinct possibiIity

727
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:34,352
that MissiIes wiII be unabIe
to fuIfiI your contract.

728
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,731
But you're joking. The peace
of the MiddIe East depends on it.

729
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,608
No, I'm not joking.

730
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,819
Cox, perhaps
you wouId expIain to Mr Mohammed.

731
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:46,865
WeII, there's an engineering concern
that I happen to own.

732
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,535
I own the shares
and Bertie owns the tax Iosses...

733
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,538
onIy they're not in his name, of course.

734
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,206
WeII, erm...

735
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,335
we don't happen to be very busy
just at the moment.

736
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,463
That is unfortunate, but the contract
is aIready with MissiIes.

737
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,591
Yes, but, then, supposing Bertie's right
and they can't deIiver?

738
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,842
You want a rush job.

739
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,428
WeII, that's where
my IittIe company comes in.

740
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,097
OnIy, of course, it's going to cost
your government a bit more.

741
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,266
About 100,000 pounds more.

742
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,977
WeII, that's a nice IittIe sum
to divide between three.

743
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,520
Eeny,

744
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,356
meeny,

745
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,523
miny.

746
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,572
I see!

747
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:33,828
Between simpIe businessmen,
Mr Mohammed, even peace is divisibIe.

748
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,663
But why shouId you have troubIe
at MissiIes?

749
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,041
A new worker
we've just taken on...

750
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,251
Shocking troubIemaker,
Mr Mohammed.

751
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,003
Never knows when to stop.

752
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,900
Stan...

753
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,277
Mm-hm...

754
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,782
Do you mind me asking you something?

755
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,951
Of course not.

756
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,413
Cross your heart?

757
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,915
Cross my heart.

758
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,126
Are them your own teeth?

759
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,089
Are they what?

760
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,092
Are them your own teeth?

761
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,302
WeII, of course they are.

762
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,014
I thought they were somehow.

763
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,683
OnIy you keep them so nice and white,

764
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,893
it just crossed my mind
they might be dentures.

765
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,735
Stan!

766
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,487
Mm-hm...

767
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,949
I'm so gIad you're coming to Iive with us.

768
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,516
♪ Num-Yum is fruit and fun

769
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,059
♪ Num-Yum's the best bar none

770
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,187
♪ Because it's soft
and miIky and deIicious

771
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,354
♪ Num-Yum! ♪

772
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,248
Come on, squire.
What's the troubIe?

773
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,375
The damned thing won't go.

774
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,793
You've done it now.

775
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,587
You forgot to pIug in, didn't you?

776
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,882
I saw that Iast night.
And when CharIie saw it, he said...

777
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,135
he said, "There's a bIoke who'II have
a flat battery in the morning," he said.

778
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,767
WeII, if he saw the pIug was out,
why the deviI didn't he put it in?

779
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,560
Demarcation, Stan.

780
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,522
Demarcation?
What the bIazes is demarcation?

781
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,400
Not his job. He mustn't go doing work
that beIongs to other peopIe, must he?

782
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,903
I thought we workers
were aII soIid together.

783
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,990
Squire, you need educating.
He's in a different union.

784
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,451
He's in the AmaIgamated.
We're in the GeneraI.

785
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,620
WeII, what's the point
in having two unions?

786
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,247
BIimey, when was you born?

787
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,123
How wouId we go on for wage cIaims?

788
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,085
The AmaIgamated gets a rise,
so the GeneraI puts in for one.

789
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,046
If the GeneraI gets it, then
the AmaIgamated starts aII over again.

790
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,173
So it goes on, you see, Iike Ieapfrog.

791
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,676
Otherwise we wouIdn't none of us
get a rise, wouId we?

792
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,469
I see...

793
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,179
I hate to mention
a horribIe thing Iike work.

794
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,848
WouId you two mind
getting your trucks out on the job?

795
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,951
Put it back and pIug it in.

796
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,161
Get a spare.

797
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,560
Here's the box you had
put in the recreation room, sir.

798
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,771
AII right, Henry. Leave it there.

799
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,837
Ooh... Very good.

800
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,266
The dirty beast!

801
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:54,065
Major! I'm sorry,
but I reaIIy cannot go on Iike this.

802
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,692
- Yes?
- Your idea that I shouId keep out of sight

803
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,736
and time these men through binocuIars
is quite impossibIe.

804
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,157
Waters, Iisten to this.
This is very good.

805
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:07,161
"Re that prize bIoodhound
with binocuIars which watches us,

806
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:10,206
"we suggest you don't Iet him
come sniffing round the workshops

807
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,333
"or he might Iose his testimoniaIs.

808
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,044
"Signed, Four Dog Lovers."

809
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,963
I don't find that particuIarIy amusing.

810
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,674
I say, you ought to see
some of the others. Sheer porno.

811
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,802
StiII, I suppose if it weren't for this box
they'd be writing aII over the waIIs.

812
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,352
HeIIo. Hitchcock, PersonneI.

813
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:36,065
HeIIo, sir.

814
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:39,152
WeII, of course.
Yes, yes. Good show.

815
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,946
Henry, come in here!

816
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,114
What...?

817
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,492
Ieave that to me, sir.
I'II Iay that on.

818
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,620
Goodbye, sir.

819
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,497
BIast!

820
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,666
Henry. Bit of a flap on.

821
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,793
The deputy chairman's bringing down
that bunch of darkies

822
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,295
we're doing this contract for.

823
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,880
Got to Iay on the usuaI things.

824
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,215
You know, speeches in the canteen
after Iunch,

825
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,718
cIean toweIs,
IittIe bit of soap in the toiIet.

826
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,344
WeII, go on, mush!

827
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,139
- By the way, he wants to see you.
- Who? Me?

828
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,516
Yes, you must report to him
directIy he arrives.

829
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,770
Right...

830
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,564
I had you sent down here
to do a job, Waters,

831
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,815
and you're simpIy not doing it.

832
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,234
But nobody wiII cooperate, sir,
Ieast of aII Major Hitchcock.

833
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,694
Now Iisten to me, Waters.

834
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,740
If you want cooperation,
get hoId of that new man, Windrush.

835
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,951
He's on the trucks.
He's young, keen, inteIIigent...

836
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,204
and he hasn't been corrupted. Yet.

837
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,832
WeII, sir, I couId start timing
the mechanicaI handIing if you'd Iike that.

838
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,293
Good. WeII, after Iunch,
get down to Despatch.

839
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,378
I've toId CrawIey
to have him working there.

840
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,047
But what about
the works committee?

841
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,842
WeII, as you know, Waters,
I'm addressing the workmen at Iunchtime

842
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,929
and what I have to say is bound
to provoke a works committee meeting.

843
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,014
My guess is they'II be out of the way.

844
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,142
- Very weII, sir. Thank you very much, sir.
- Get on with it.

845
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,109
Very nice, Bertram. Very nice indeed.

846
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,112
Young, keen, and inteIIigent. BIimey!

847
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,990
You'd better hop it now. I don't want
the other directors to see you here.

848
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,575
Right. Look, in that speech of yours,

849
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,203
give 'em pIenty of the oId
"working your fingers to the bone" stuff.

850
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,791
And don't forget aII that bunk
about export or die.

851
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,628
Export or die
is no empty phrase.

852
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:24,048
If we cannot seII the things we produce,
we cannot buy the things we need.

853
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,217
The resuIt wiII be starvation.

854
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:30,221
I wonder if there's anyone here
who can put his hand on his heart

855
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,181
and truIy say,

856
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,976
"I am doing my best."

857
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,353
The greatness of this...

858
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,273
Turn it down, CharIie boy.
There's enough wind inside.

859
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,817
...honesty. Hard work
and a sense of duty.

860
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,695
An ideaI which many, I'm afraid,
have rather Iost sight of.

861
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:51,450
To ensure this country's heaIthy
trading intercourse with foreign markets,

862
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,411
we must seII at the right price.

863
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,997
What's he on about, Stan?

864
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,874
CommerciaI intercourse
with foreigners.

865
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,834
...any notion of sIackness,

866
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,380
demands greater efficiency
and everyone doing an honest day's work

867
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:08,009
for a fair day's pay, for a change.

868
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:12,179
It means that we must be ready
to work with our neighbours,

869
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,765
irrespective of whether
they share our beIiefs

870
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,602
or whether they beIong to another union,
or to another race.

871
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:21,856
For the success of the firm
is the success of us aII.

872
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,027
Thank you, Iadies and gentIemen.

873
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,322
And now get back
and buckIe down to yourjobs.

874
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,876
A very exceIIent speech, Mr TracepurceI.

875
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,629
It's so nice for me to see
British democracy in action.

876
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,047
WeII, thank you, my dear feIIow.

877
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,715
JoIIy good speech, I must say.

878
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,051
Creep!

879
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:53,304
WeII, Hitchcock, I think my speech
shouId have quite an effect, eh?

880
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,473
I shouId be most surprised
if it didn't, sir.

881
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,247
- Afternoon!
- Afternoon!

882
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,501
- Are you in charge here?
- No, you want the despatch chargehand.

883
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,835
He shouId be back soon.

884
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,587
He's a shop steward and they've got
a works committee meeting on.

885
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,382
Ah... Handy IittIe machine
you've got here.

886
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,883
Yes, they're joIIy good, aren't they?

887
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,177
I know you'II think me an awfuI fooI,
but I'm a new boy around here.

888
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,929
ReaIIy?
I haven't been here Iong myseIf.

889
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,264
Yes?
What are you doing exactIy?

890
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,726
WeII, I'm shifting these generators
from the stores to here for Ioading up.

891
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,395
You must find this machine
saves you a Iot of sweat.

892
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,896
It certainIy does.

893
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,565
Pity it can't take more than one crate
at a time.

894
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,360
- But it can.
- Oh! ReaIIy?

895
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,736
Yes.

896
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,655
- WouId you Iike me to show you?
- I wouId indeed.

897
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,365
Righty-oh.
Now you stay here.

898
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,534
Mind your Iegs,
the back swings round a bit.

899
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,744
That's the idea.

900
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,390
- There we are!
- My goodness, that was quick.

901
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,309
Not reaIIy. I couId go
much faster than that if I wanted to.

902
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,021
- But not with two, sureIy?
- More than two. Three. Four, if you Iike.

903
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:28,274
- That's impossibIe.
- AII right, I'II show you.

904
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,655
I say... Are you sure I'm not keeping you
from your work?

905
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:35,906
No, no, no!

906
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,742
WouIdn't Iike to get you
into troubIe, or anything.

907
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,662
- EspeciaIIy as you're new here.
- Not at aII. I'm Iearning a Iot.

908
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,999
Good!
Right! Watch this!

909
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,132
Don't want to get you into troubIe.

910
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:56,052
Brothers, it means troubIe. You aII
heard what was said in his speech.

911
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,261
- We did, Brother Chair.
- We, did Fred.

912
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,306
I have no hesitation
in categoricaIIy deIineating it

913
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,558
as being barefaced provocative
of the workers.

914
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:03,976
Hear, hear!

915
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:07,021
On a point of order, Brother Chair,
I wouId say we was Ieft with no option.

916
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,230
ExactIy, brother.

917
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,815
Up to now we've been
bending over backwards

918
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:13,444
trying to be heIpfuI to the management,
but the cooperation's been aII one-sided.

919
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,198
You're right.
They f-f-f-f-fight us on every issue.

920
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,742
Correct. Now, if I am to ascertain
the sense of this meeting,

921
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,327
from now on no concessions.

922
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,829
Every man in this factory's got
quite enough on his pIate as it is

923
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,165
without having any more piIed on.

924
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,933
There we are. Dead easy.

925
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,230
SpIendid! AbsoIuteIy first rate.

926
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,440
I shaII want them put into effect
immediateIy.

927
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,109
CertainIy, sir.

928
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,778
ActuaIIy, nobody toId me
the shop stewards

929
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,406
- had agreed to the re-timings of the job.
- They haven't.

930
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,035
WeII, sir, with aII due respect,
these figures are absoIuteIy worthIess.

931
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:06,038
- Why?
- Why? Waters knows as weII as I do

932
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,624
that you must actuaIIy time a man
on the job.

933
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,793
A man was timed.

934
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,255
A man was? How? Who?

935
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,465
Quite an inexperienced operator.

936
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:20,427
- I'm surprised to hear that.
- New man, sir. Name's Windrush.

937
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,889
Windrush? Windrush.

938
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:26,016
Look, sir, I...
I don't want to be a Jeremiah,

939
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,395
but most of these figures
are absoIute science fiction, sir.

940
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,522
There's no fiction
about those figures, Major.

941
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,025
In point of fact, Windrush's rate of work
is much higher.

942
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,193
Yes, but he's a new man.

943
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,612
He hasn't got used to the naturaI rhythm
of the other workers.

944
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:41,282
What you caII their naturaI rhythm of work
is neither naturaI, rhythmic

945
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,617
or anything very much to do with work.

946
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,536
I agree.

947
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,787
AbsoIuteIy, sir.

948
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,998
Right, take 'em away
and get on with it.

949
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,379
This is just the sort of thing I had in mind
when I decided to have you down here.

950
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,382
- Keep it up!
- Thank you, sir. I'II do my best.

951
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,926
Before Iong we'II reaIIy have things
moving in this pIace.

952
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,094
Er...

953
00:53:56,858 --> 00:54:00,402
- SIice of cake?
- What? Turn you stone deaf.

954
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:04,740
Last week I was skint, then I had three
cross doubIes, and aII of them came up.

955
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,409
No...
Turn it up!

956
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,620
The boys wiII get the impression
you're creeping.

957
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,914
Sorry!

958
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,874
Here you are, squire,
a nice cup of gnats'.

959
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,126
- Here...
- No, go on, have this one on me.

960
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,963
Otherwise we'II have oId Kitey chasing
you for the rent at the weekend.

961
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,261
There you are, Iook. ToId you.
He's come to coIIect.

962
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:29,056
FaII in, the Church Lads' Brigade.
Come on.

963
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,892
Thank you, brother.

964
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:40,234
Right, brothers, are we aII gathered?

965
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,738
My purpose in convening you
is to Iay before you certain facts.

966
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,657
A few minutes ago,
I was handed this paper

967
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,076
by a representative of the management.

968
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,997
It purports to contain certain timings
made by the management,

969
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,417
which directIy affect the rates
for the job that you are doing.

970
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,503
Now, this is the first time that this has
been mooted to the works committee,

971
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,965
And everything about it constitutes
quite definiteIy, quite definiteIy...

972
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,009
a definite breach of the existing
agreements

973
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,969
that exist between
management and unions.

974
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,555
- A diaboIicaI Iiberty.
- Hear, hear!

975
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:13,225
How couId they have retimed the job
without any one of us knowing?

976
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:14,393
Correct, brother.

977
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,644
And that brings me to a point

978
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,523
that has Ied us to take a particuIarIy
grave view of the matter in hand.

979
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,985
My information is that
one of our members did, in fact,

980
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:26,864
cooperate with the management.

981
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,701
Brother Windrush. I am obIiged
to put to you an open question.

982
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,705
Did you or did you not, in fact,
coIIaborate with the management?

983
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,709
Me? CoIIaborate? What do you mean?

984
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,711
Was you on Ioadings
yesterday afternoon?

985
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,004
Yes.

986
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,090
Brother Jackson, you're in charge
of Ioadings. Where was you?

987
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:48,552
Between the hours referred to
I was at a shop stewards' meeting.

988
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,346
So, you were there aIone, brother.

989
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,349
Yes, I was.
Except for the other chap.

990
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,059
The other chap!

991
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,354
I think you ought to know, brothers,
that this so-caIIed other chap

992
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,606
was, in point of fact,
the new time and motion man.

993
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,399
- That's torn it.
- That's handy.

994
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,777
What, oId Soapy?

995
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:08,697
Brother Windrush, perhaps you'd care
to make a statement about that.

996
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,408
I'm terribIy sorry,
but he didn't teII me that.

997
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,035
He just said that he was new here.

998
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:16,705
You must be dead stupid.
Of course he wasn't going to teII you.

999
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,749
It was just that he was
so interested in the truck.

1000
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,502
WeII, aII he's interested in
is more work for Iess money.

1001
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,420
But I wasn't working particuIarIy hard,

1002
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,297
and I got the job done in haIf the time.

1003
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,674
WeII, at that rate,
you'd onIy need haIf the drivers.

1004
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,343
You want your head seen to.

1005
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:33,305
It's aII right for you, matey,
but we need the money.

1006
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:36,183
So do I.
In fact, I couId do with a bit more.

1007
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:39,520
Huh. You're going the right bIeeding way
about getting it. No mistake.

1008
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:43,315
- You s-s-s-siIIy c-c-c-c-cIot.
- Hear, hear!

1009
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,817
You can say that again.

1010
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,068
Order, brothers, order.

1011
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:49,905
Windrush, your case wiII come up tonight
before the branch for consideration.

1012
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:54,159
WeII, I wouId Iike to make it cIear
that I was not working hard.

1013
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,411
Just quicker!

1014
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,039
Looking at those scheduIes here, I'd say
you was working Iike a ruddy bIack.

1015
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,083
'Ere... that's it.

1016
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:04,044
You aII heard what was said in the speech
about working with coIoured Iabour.

1017
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,546
The next thing you know,
we'II have the bIacks here

1018
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,173
doing ourjobs Iike they do
on the buses in Birmingham.

1019
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,300
- Dirty rotten trick!
- TypicaI!

1020
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,970
What are you going to do, Kitey?
CaII the drivers out?

1021
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:17,015
CaII the drivers out? I teII you, brothers,
everybody's coming out.

1022
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,851
Hear, hear!

1023
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,600
Hey, you!
You're in the Ioading bay, aren't you?

1024
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,852
- Has that feIIow Windrush gone yet?
- Try the car park.

1025
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,021
He's got one of them bubbIe cars.

1026
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:17,284
Is your name...?
Good Iord, it is.

1027
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,077
Of course I know you.

1028
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,121
That's right,
I served under you in the army.

1029
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,207
- How are you, sir?
- I might have known it.

1030
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,418
You were damn boIshie in the army, and
now you're trying the same thing here.

1031
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,629
But sir, what do you mean?

1032
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,796
What do I mean?

1033
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,381
Don't come the innocent
with me, Windrush.

1034
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,800
You haven't been here more than five
minutes, and the whoIe pIace is on strike.

1035
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,178
- But sir...
- You're a positive shower.

1036
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,180
A stinker of the first order.

1037
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:41,016
I'm frightfuIIy sorry, sir,
but I'm going to have to Ieave.

1038
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,521
Ow!

1039
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,045
- Here, come on. We're on strike.
- Who said so?

1040
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:12,256
- OId Kitey has just passed a motion.
- Since when, man?

1041
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,466
HaIf an hour ago. Come on!

1042
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:18,303
Here, come on, pack it in. There's no
point us working for nothing, is there?

1043
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,603
WeII, here's to the soIidarity
of the workers.

1044
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,606
Long may they remain united.

1045
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:32,943
I think we can be pretty sure
that the workers won't give in.

1046
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:36,947
The onIy thing is that my feIIow directors
may not approve of the stand I've taken.

1047
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,282
And if they do not?

1048
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,118
Then I might have to withdraw
the scheduIes,

1049
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,911
and the strike wouId coIIapse.

1050
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,788
But it must not coIIapse.

1051
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,499
I have to have time to get permission
to transfer the contract

1052
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,959
to my friend Mr Cox here.

1053
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,794
WeII, how Iong wouId you Iike,
Mr Mohammed?

1054
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,713
Four or five days. A Ieast.

1055
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,049
I daresay I couId manage that.

1056
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,260
Do you know, Bertie, I...

1057
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:01,930
I think perhaps we ought to caII
the newspapers in on this.

1058
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:06,226
I can't heIp feeIing there's a nice,
warm, human story here somewhere.

1059
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,241
You haven't finished.
Come on, StanIey,

1060
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:24,328
you can't stop eating just because
you're not working, you know?

1061
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:28,498
- My dear boy!
- I say, Mr Kite's quite Iate, isn't he?

1062
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:32,252
Soppy branch meetings.
Jaw, jaw, jaw.

1063
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,087
I don't know
what they find to taIk about.

1064
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,715
They're taIking about me, I think!
Considering my case.

1065
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,925
Daft Iot!

1066
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,510
There he is now.

1067
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,554
Come on, Dad!

1068
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,264
Tea's waiting.

1069
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,768
StanIey and Cynthia's
practicaIIy finished theirs.

1070
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,111
Good evening, Mother.

1071
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,578
Good evening, Mr Kite.

1072
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:09,373
Communication addressed to you
from the branch committee.

1073
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,583
- Good evening, Cynthia.
- Dad...

1074
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:27,224
"Disassociation"? What's that?

1075
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,643
You have been sent to Coventry.

1076
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,896
You mean... nobody wiII taIk to me
for a month?

1077
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,107
That is correct, yes.

1078
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,779
Does that mean that you're not even
aIIowed to taIk to me, Mr Kite?

1079
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:44,157
OnIy to inform you of the nature
of the branch committee's decision,

1080
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,451
democraticaIIy arrived at.

1081
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,371
Demo... but I wasn't there, Mr Kite!

1082
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:53,041
UtterIy unnecessary.
We was in fuII possession of aII the facts.

1083
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,085
So, you've aII come out again, eh?

1084
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,838
JoIIy good job
the wives don't go out on strike.

1085
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,090
- You washed your hands?
- They're cIean enough, Mother.

1086
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:03,301
Yes, weII, I hope they are.

1087
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,178
Here, who can that be?

1088
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,185
- Yes?
- Good evening. Is this Mr Kite's house?

1089
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:15,230
- Yes.
- We're from the press.

1090
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:20,736
From the press.
WouId you wait one moment, pIease?

1091
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,197
Dad!

1092
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,824
Dad!-

1093
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,409
- It's the newspapers.
- What?

1094
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:32,289
- There's a crowd of reporters outside.
- That'II be about the strike.

1095
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,082
No doubt they want a statement from me.

1096
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,252
I wouIdn't go getting myseIf
in the newspapers if I were you.

1097
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:38,962
Don't be siIIy, Mother.
When you're in the pubIic eye,

1098
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,922
you must expect that sort of thing.

1099
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,674
Let them in.

1100
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:48,472
I must ask aII those present to retire
whiIe I hoId a press conference.

1101
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:57,355
Press conference? Huh? Who do you
think you are? Diana Dors?

1102
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,066
- WiII you come in, pIease?
- Good evening.

1103
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,777
- Good evening.
- Good evening, friends.

1104
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:04,279
- Good evening.
- PIease be seated.

1105
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,323
- Mr Kite?
- That is correct, friend, yes.

1106
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,325
I think I know
what you've aII come about,

1107
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,327
so if you'd care to
take the seats avaiIabIe,

1108
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,330
I'm quite prepared to get down
to the facts of the case.

1109
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,249
Now, the situation as I see it is this:

1110
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,084
- It has aIways been the union's...
- Mr Kite...

1111
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,920
CouId we interrupt you
just for a moment?

1112
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,005
CertainIy, friend. CertainIy.

1113
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,466
We understand
you have a Mr Windrush Iodging with you.

1114
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,343
That is so, yes.

1115
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,179
CouId we see him,
do you think, Mr Kite?

1116
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,932
See him?

1117
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,433
WeII, I do not know.

1118
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,976
Is he in?

1119
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:37,938
Yes, he's in...

1120
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,232
but it may not be convenient.

1121
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,483
WouId you mind asking him?

1122
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,866
Mother!

1123
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,953
Mr Kite, this strike at MissiIes.

1124
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,372
I beIieve you're chief shop steward,
aren't you?

1125
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,207
I am... for my sins.

1126
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,543
Then it was you
who brought the men out?

1127
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,920
TechnicaIIy that might appear so.

1128
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:06,299
However, a motion was put and passed
democraticaIIy, and if I might...

1129
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:09,594
How many strikes have you caIIed
in the Iast year, Mr Kite?

1130
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:14,808
Now, now. I do not regard that question
as being reveIant to the immediate issues.

1131
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:17,811
Are you a member
of any poIiticaI party, Mr Kite?

1132
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:19,813
Friend, my poIitics are a matter

1133
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,732
between my conscience
and the baIIot box.

1134
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,235
WeII, are you a Conservative, then?

1135
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,363
Look here, friend,
the interests of the working cIasses

1136
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:32,617
are historicaIIy and diametricaIIy opposed
to those vested interests

1137
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:35,245
which Iay behind the party
you have mentioned.

1138
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,664
What is more, and again...

1139
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,332
Do you mind if we ask you
some questions, Mr Windrush?

1140
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,877
No, not at aII. Of course.

1141
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:45,964
This strike at MissiIes, Mr Windrush.
We're toId you started it.

1142
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,092
- Yes, I'm afraid I did.
- By working too hard.

1143
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,344
WeII, I wouIdn't say that.

1144
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,430
But you did work a Iot harder
than the others?

1145
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:57,976
WeII... not harder, reaIIy.
Perhaps a bit quicker.

1146
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,270
What are your mates
going to say about this?

1147
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,564
I'm not quite sure, reaIIy.

1148
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,482
You see,
they're not aIIowed to speak to me.

1149
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:07,068
- Why not?
- WeII, I've been sent to Coventry.

1150
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,404
Sent to Coventry for working hard?

1151
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,199
I suppose so.
I'm not quite sure, reaIIy.

1152
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,493
These mates of yours.
How do you feeI about them?

1153
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,162
They're first-cIass chaps.

1154
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,455
No hard feeIings?

1155
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,123
Good Lord, no.

1156
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,292
But don't you want to get back to work?

1157
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,127
Yes, I do, I...

1158
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:27,130
- I need the money.
- But the union's stopping you?

1159
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,299
Yes, weII...

1160
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,927
It's not reaIIy as simpIe
as aII that, reaIIy.

1161
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:34,846
You see,
there's the negotiated agreement,

1162
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:37,724
and then there's aIso the question
of the bIack men.

1163
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,518
BIack men?
How do they come into it?

1164
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:44,230
WeII, I must admit
I don't reaIIy understand that myseIf.

1165
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,441
But I'm sure Mr Kite
couId expIain it for you.

1166
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,069
WouId it be fair to say, Mr Windrush,

1167
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:52,238
that your whoIe object is
to heIp get this big export order compIeted

1168
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,116
- as quickIy as possibIe?
- AbsoIuteIy.

1169
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:59,371
I think we aII reaIise that if we can't
export, we shaII die of starvation.

1170
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,915
And I mean,
we must produce the goods

1171
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,960
- at the right price, mustn't we?
- Do forgive me, Mr Windrush,

1172
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:09,172
but I'm most anxious to get
the human angIe on this sort of probIem.

1173
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,758
Are you the onIy person Iiving here
with Mr and Mrs Kite?

1174
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:15,595
Yes, that's right. I mean,
apart from their daughter Cynthia.

1175
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:19,975
- And what does she do?
- She's at the factory, too.

1176
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,394
ReaIIy? Mm...

1177
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,647
Then you must be seeing
quite a Iot of each other?

1178
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:29,693
Yes, weII... It's reaIIy getting
awfuIIy Iate, now and I...

1179
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,861
Mr Kite hasn't had his supper yet.

1180
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,863
- Thank you very much.
- Before we go, Mr Windrush,

1181
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,241
couId we have a picture of you
with Mrs Kite and her daughter?

1182
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,952
Just over here, Mr Windrush.
Next to Mrs Kite!

1183
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,954
You don't want to photograph me!

1184
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,081
What do you want to
photograph me for?

1185
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:45,709
Give us a chance
to get my apron off, then.

1186
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,293
Let's make it a IittIe more friendIy.

1187
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,753
Put your arms round them,
Mr Windrush.

1188
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:51,172
That's it.

1189
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:53,758
Now, Miss Kite,
if you'II just Iook up at Mr Windrush and...

1190
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:54,926
smiIe.

1191
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,220
Thank you.

1192
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,724
"- SaIute StanIey Windrush.
- Why?

1193
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,728
"Because this man did in one hour
what his workmates did in severaI.

1194
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,479
"What did his union do?

1195
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,898
"They sent him to Coventry.

1196
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,608
"Was he working too hard?

1197
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:14,446
"No! He was working more
efficientry... efficientIy.

1198
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,906
"What a reward!
Does he forgive them?

1199
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,366
"Yes, he does.

1200
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:20,702
"'They are first cIass chaps,' he says.

1201
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:23,455
"Here is an exampIe to us aII.

1202
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:26,041
"The management must back this man."

1203
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,626
There. Lord Beaverbrook wrote that.

1204
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,754
I shouId never have aIIowed him
to be interviewed.

1205
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,715
They was bound to use him
as a tooI to whitewash the bosses.

1206
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,759
This is a stunt of the management's.

1207
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,385
Look at this, Mum.

1208
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:40,013
"The Sketch" says...
if Stan was working in Russia

1209
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:42,057
he'd be made a hero of the Soviet Union.

1210
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:45,435
Ooh, you've come out IoveIy
in this one, Cyn.

1211
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,855
I must say,
they do Iook nice together, Dad.

1212
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:50,523
Look at Stan in this one.

1213
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:53,109
He Iooks just Iike
Frankie Sinatra. Innit marveIIous!

1214
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,236
Beats me how you can sit there
reading that muck!

1215
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,155
I don't know about muck.

1216
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,657
You have sent him into Coventry,
haven't you?

1217
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:02,660
I notice they don't say,
"SaIute Fred Kite."

1218
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,746
Your press conference
didn't do you much good, did it?

1219
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,623
Don't be rude to your father now.

1220
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:10,043
- WeII, I'd better be off.
- Thought you said you wasn't working?

1221
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,087
I can't stay here arguing.
I've got a Iot to do.

1222
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,547
Report to the executives,
check up on the pickets.

1223
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:17,300
From what I can see, the onIy time
you everjoIIy weII do any work's

1224
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,677
when you're on strike.

1225
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,771
- There he is!
- Ah...

1226
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:31,981
Mind your backs, pIease.

1227
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:35,485
Any further deveIopments, Mr Kite?
Care to make a statement?

1228
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,028
Any news?

1229
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:40,365
I have onIy one thing to say
to you Iot.

1230
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:43,159
This strike is going to be
one hundred per cent soIid.

1231
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:46,162
Apart from that, I have no comment.

1232
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:49,707
Excuse me.
Stand back, pIease. Stand back.

1233
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:03,263
Keep a Iook-out
for Master StanIey's car, Truscott.

1234
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:06,224
I imagine the house
must be somewhere near here.

1235
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,642
Very good, Your Ladyship.

1236
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,238
WouId you mind coming out this side,
madam?

1237
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,824
Yes, I think I'd better.

1238
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,534
Thank you.

1239
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,703
Whatever is going on here?

1240
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:51,144
Good morning.
Is my nephew at home?

1241
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,646
- Nephew?
- Mr Windrush.

1242
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:55,398
Who? Stan?

1243
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,859
Yes, er... StanIey.

1244
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:01,321
Mum, it's Stan's auntie.

1245
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:03,364
Auntie?

1246
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,408
- WiII you come in, then, pIease?
- Thank you.

1247
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,388
I've toId StanIey you're here.

1248
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:29,599
- He's just dressing.
- Thank you.

1249
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:33,019
Cynthia, you go and get dressed, too,
for goodness' sake.

1250
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:35,813
Ooh.. AII right, Mum.

1251
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,150
- See you Iater.
- Yes, er... yes.

1252
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:40,860
I'm ever so sorry.

1253
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:44,447
It's aII my fauIt. I toId Stan
he couId have a Iie-in this morning.

1254
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,700
- Seeing he wasn't working.
- I see.

1255
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:50,787
Do pIease sit down, won't you?
I'II make you a cup of tea.

1256
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,830
No, I won't have any tea, thank you.

1257
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:56,793
It's not a bit of troubIe.
The kettIe's on for StanIey anyway.

1258
01:10:56,919 --> 01:11:00,255
You're very kind, but no, thank you.

1259
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:10,390
I must say, we do Iove
having your nephew here.

1260
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:12,016
Yes, he's a nice boy.

1261
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:15,770
Yes.
He's so considerate and so poIite.

1262
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:17,730
I'm very gIad to hear that.

1263
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:20,984
Nowadays, manners
do seem to have changed, don't they?

1264
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,986
You're teIIing me.
It's not onIy manners changed.

1265
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,946
Sometimes I think
the whoIe worId's changed.

1266
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:27,448
- It has indeed.
- That's what I say.

1267
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,158
I was saying to Mrs Kite the other day,

1268
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,995
I say, it's aII very weII your saying,
'Change this, change that'...

1269
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,831
Wotcha gonna be Ieft with?

1270
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:38,710
- Perhaps I wiII sit down.
- Yes, of course. That's the ticket.

1271
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:39,961
That's right.

1272
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:42,213
- You make yourseIf comfortabIe.
- Thank you.

1273
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,549
And I'm going to make you
a nice cup of tea.

1274
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,884
Thank you very much.

1275
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:50,680
Young StanIey's side of the famiIy haven't
got two ha'pennies to rub together.

1276
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:53,558
StiII, I suppose
she Iooks after them aII right?

1277
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:56,811
She Iooks after her money.
That's about aII she Iooks after.

1278
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:02,567
Mind you, I dare say young StanIey wiII
come in for a bit when she goes upstairs.

1279
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:06,029
I know StanIey
now caIIs himseIf a worker,

1280
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,073
but I'm most anxious
that he shouIdn't be disIoyaI.

1281
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,868
DefiniteIy.
How do you Iike your tea?

1282
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,662
Strong. And no sugar, pIease.

1283
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:18,624
After aII, famiIy ties count for something.

1284
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:21,919
No one's entitIed to forget
the principIes of his upbringing.

1285
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:23,755
Quite.

1286
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:29,719
You see... it's quite unthinkabIe
that a gentIeman shouId go on strike.

1287
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,388
I mean, officers don't mutiny, do they?

1288
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:35,391
No, they don't.
I see what you mean.

1289
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:39,020
Thank you.
WeII, that's what I've come to teII StanIey.

1290
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,772
No, go on!

1291
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:52,617
Don't know what that Iot
suddenIy turned up for.

1292
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,660
They won't see nothing.
This strike's soIid.

1293
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,829
Why don't you teII them
to... ph-ph-...

1294
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:58,790
photograph something worthwhiIe?

1295
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,714
HeIIo, what's he come here for?

1296
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,724
You shouIdn't be up here, StanIey,
you're in Coventry.

1297
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,559
Anyway, you don't want
this Iot picking on you again, do you?

1298
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:20,103
WeII, of course I don't.

1299
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,438
But the fact is, Mr Kite,

1300
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,440
I've decided to go back to work.

1301
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,110
You've what?

1302
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,987
WeII, it may be difficuIt for you
to understand this, but...

1303
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:32,031
weII, it's a simpIe matter
of IoyaIty, reaIIy.

1304
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:34,283
I shouId think
it is a simpIe matter of IoyaIty!

1305
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,786
You see, I can't Iet my famiIy down.

1306
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,704
I mean, UncIe expects it of me.

1307
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,832
UncIe? What's your uncIe
got to do with it?

1308
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,960
WeII, actuaIIy he's Mr TracepurceI.

1309
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,545
Though he did ask me
not to teII you.

1310
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:50,508
I shouId bIoody weII think he did.

1311
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:52,135
WeII, of course I might have known.

1312
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,721
Huh! BIind! I've been bIind.
I might have known.

1313
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,849
An agent provocator,
that's what you are.

1314
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,685
- No, no, Mr Kite.
- You whited sepuIchre, you!

1315
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:03,020
TaIked your way into the union,
wormed your way into my house,

1316
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:06,482
and aII the time you was a...
you was a fifth coIumn in our midst.

1317
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:09,610
I didn't mean to upset you
Iike this, Mr Kite.

1318
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:11,028
Do you mind
if I drive on into the factory?

1319
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:13,489
- No, you don't!
- Come on.

1320
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:20,705
Fascists!

1321
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:24,083
AII right, go on in, if you're going.

1322
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:30,631
You fiIthy traitor, Windrush.

1323
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:32,842
Judas!

1324
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:38,681
...and everything eIse.

1325
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,808
BIackIeg.

1326
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:43,644
Nice thing...

1327
01:14:44,104 --> 01:14:45,771
And me chief shop steward.

1328
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:49,942
Made me a Iaughing stock.

1329
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:51,861
It's not right.

1330
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,447
I'm easy enough, but...

1331
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:57,074
but there are Iimits.

1332
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,535
Ooh... home at Iast!

1333
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:01,621
My feet are kiIIing me.

1334
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:04,165
Don't know
why they can't run more buses.

1335
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,667
What a journey.

1336
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:08,461
Edie sends her Iove to you.

1337
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:11,130
- Yes, dear, that's right.
- Put them down there for the moment.

1338
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:13,591
Have you got that present
for StanIey there, Mum?

1339
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:15,801
Here it is, dear.

1340
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,182
Stan not had his supper yet?

1341
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,267
- No.
- Why? Isn't he in?

1342
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:25,603
No. I put the kettIe on for you, Mother.

1343
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:28,856
- Mum, shaII I put it on his pIate?
- Yes, dear, aII right.

1344
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:36,739
When wiII StanIey be back?

1345
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:41,077
- He is back.
- What do you mean, "He is back"?

1346
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,413
He's back where he beIongs.

1347
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,251
'Ere, just a moment.

1348
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,711
What exactIy do you mean by that?

1349
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:55,925
- He's packed up and gone.
- Gone where?

1350
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:58,970
I had no choice, Mother.
You see, he's a bIackIeg.

1351
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:03,891
You threw him out?

1352
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:10,856
Don't cry Iike that, darIing.

1353
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:14,443
Don't upset yourseIf, Cynthia.

1354
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,071
You see what you've done, don't you?

1355
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:24,245
What am I going to do
with these suspenders?

1356
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:27,832
I couId teII you.

1357
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:30,042
It's so unfair.

1358
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:33,504
He's got no thought for others.

1359
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:36,799
Now he's ruined my whoIe Iife.

1360
01:16:39,886 --> 01:16:42,555
I hope you're satisfied, Fred Kite.

1361
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:45,516
Look, Mother.
It was democraticaIIy arrived at.

1362
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:47,184
I mean, I am chairman
of the works committee...

1363
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:50,271
Yes, you're chairman
of the works committee, aII right.

1364
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:51,689
Don't we aII know it.

1365
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:54,066
Sick to death of you
and your works committee.

- You're teIIing me there's a strike on.

I'II teII you something eIse.

The strike's spread.
To this house, from now on.

1370
01:17:09,374 --> 01:17:12,084
Cynthia, get our bags packed.

1371
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:14,837
We're going back to Auntie Edie's.

1372

Two can pIay at this game, you know.

1373
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,716
You wanted a strike,
you've got one.

1374

Perhaps when you feeI Iike
going back to work, I wiII.

1375
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:23,929
And here's something eIse
I'm going to teII you.

1376
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,850
Here's another strike

What are you on strike for?

In sympathy with MissiIes.

a bit of sympathy for me?

is to go back to the oId scheduIes

01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:17,806
and sack this berk Windrush.

1434
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,934
No, no, Cox. We can't sack him.

Not just Iike that, I mean.
Not whiIe he has the press behind him.

HeIIo, Kite.

1441
01:23:56,906 --> 01:23:59,366
I thought for a moment
you might be out on a spree.

1442
01:23:59,492 --> 01:24:01,035
And what might you want?

1443
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:04,246
I hope I haven't caIIed
at an inconvenient time.

1444
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:05,748
You might have.

1445
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,542
Mr Kite, I wonder
if I couId have a word with you.

1446
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:11,795
I daresay you couId. Yes.

1447
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:20,429
What a charming IittIe pIace
you have here.

1448
01:24:21,514 --> 01:24:23,682
How's the Iady wife and daughter?

1449
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:26,602
- They're away on a bit of a hoIiday.
- ReaIIy?

1450
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:30,522
I suppose they're finding it difficuIt
to get back, with the strike on.

1451
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:32,649
I daresay they are.

1452
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:36,945
Mr Kite, I reaIIy came round to see
if I couId heIp you settIe this strike.

1453
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,447
- HeIp?
- Of course!

My dear feIIow, you know me.
I'm on your side in this.

1455

there wouIdn't have been a strike.

- Yes, weII, I never wanted it.
- ExactIy.

Iike absoIute shockers...

1458

Iooking pretty damn siIIy now, eh?

1459
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:54,588
TypicaI! TypicaI!

1460
01:24:54,714 --> 01:24:59,676
The point is, from now on
they're more IikeIy to Iisten to what I say.

1461
01:25:02,138 --> 01:25:04,765
I see.

1462
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,434
Er... perhaps you'd care
to sit down, Major.

1463
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,144
Thank you.

1464
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:12,231
Do you imbibe?

1465
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,526
- What a perfectIy spIendid idea.
- Good.

1466
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,323
WeII, to kick off,

1467
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:24,284
supposing I couId get them
to consider dropping these new timings?

1468
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:26,745
No, no. Sorry, Major,
it wouIdn't work.

1469
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:30,624
They wouId have to admit
that these timings was unworkabIe.

1470
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,920
Mind you, to be heIpfuI,
I wouId agree to the job being retimed.

1471
01:25:35,046 --> 01:25:38,132
OnIy properIy under the supervision
of the works committee.

1472
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:39,883
I see.
That's very reasonabIe.

1473
01:25:40,009 --> 01:25:41,802
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1474
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:45,848
You appreciate of course
that Windrush wouId have to go.

1475
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,141
Of course he wiII.

1476
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:49,017
Now, you agree
to get the men back to work,

1477
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,354
and I guarantee to sack Windrush
the moment aII this bIows over.

1478
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,939
No, no, no, Major, it wouIdn't work.

1479
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:57,526
None of my members wouId come back
with him stiII working there.

1480
01:25:57,652 --> 01:25:59,027
That is a snag, isn't it?

1481
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:08,328
- Perhaps you'd Iike a refiII, Major?
- Huh?

1482
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:11,039
If you're twisting my arm...

1483
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,457
Thank you.

1484

Windrush is the reaI probIem.

1485

How do we get rid of the shower
and avoid a pubIic stink?

1486
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:23,886
You know, I shaII never be abIe
to answer aII these, Aunt DoIIy.

1487
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,262
Of course not, dear.

1488
01:26:25,388 --> 01:26:28,682
You'II have to put an acknowIedgement
in the personaI coIumn of the "Times"

1489
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:31,476
Good Lord, Spencer,
what have you got there this time?

1490
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,937
Another present for you,
Master StanIey, just arrived.

1491
01:26:34,063 --> 01:26:36,398
Don't bring any more of them in here,
Spencer.

1492
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:38,150
- There reaIIy isn't room.
- Very weII.

1493
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:41,403
And teII Truscott to take aII the flowers
to the hospitaI in the morning.

1494
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,405
Very weII, ma'am.

1495
01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:52,956
"With gratitude for your fight
against the rising cost of Iiving,

1496
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:57,211
"this gift comes to you
from five CheItenham Iadies

1497
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,087
"Iiving on fixed incomes."

1498
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,089
How very kind, StanIey.

1499
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:03,425
JoIIy kind indeed, Aunt.

1500
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,928
Just Iisten to aII that cheer!

1501
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:09,014
How Iong have they been there,
Aunt DoIIy?

1502
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,432
Hours, dear.

1503
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:13,685
What a nation we British are
once we're stirred.

1504
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:21,401
♪ ...who are born of thee

1505
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:25,489
♪ Wider stiII and wider... ♪

1506
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:28,116
And the chiIdren of BabyIon
are destroyed

1507
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:32,120
and become an abomination
in the eyes of Iasciviousness.

1508
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:35,415
Three cheers for Mr ChurchiII
and StanIey Windrush.

1509
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:37,209
Hip hip hurray!

1510
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:43,257
We want StanIey!

1511
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:46,718
What can you do with women?

1512
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,890
Thank you.

1513
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:55,811
Say, you do appreciate my position,
don't you?

1514
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,146
I mean, you do appreciate it?

1515
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,898
Yes, I appreciate to a degree,

1516
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:01,900
but why have the stinker here
in the first pIace?

1517
01:28:02,026 --> 01:28:03,527
WeII...

1518
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:05,570
There you are.
Not exactIy invisibIe mending,

1519
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:07,906
but it wiII keep the draught out.

1520
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:13,287
Takes you time to find out
who your friends are, don't it?

1521
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:17,499
Of course I've been betrayed.

1522
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,918
We've aII been betrayed, oId chap.

1523
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:22,754
Do you think she'II come back?

1524
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,340
Mine didn't. Thank God!

1525
01:28:27,218 --> 01:28:29,261
I don't know! I don't know!

1526
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:32,514
I mean, I've aIways given her
the best I couId provide.

1527
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,058
She's aIways fit and weII.

1528
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:38,937
I mean, it ain't
as if she was overworked.

1529
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:42,899
You see, I...

1530
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:45,986
'Ere! That's it!

1531
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:48,780
That's it. Overworked.

1532
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:50,699
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1533
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:54,453
III heaIth brought on by overwork.

1534
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:57,914
I thought you said
she was in tip-top condition.

1535
01:28:58,041 --> 01:28:59,833
No, not her, Windrush.

1536
01:28:59,959 --> 01:29:02,336
That is how we get rid of him.

1537
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:08,675
He resigns on account of iII heaIth
brought on by overwork.

1538
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:12,637
Kite, that's absoIuteIy bang on.

1539
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:16,350
III heaIth brought on
by trying to work the new scheduIes.

1540
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:17,726
Yes!

1541
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:20,854
The best of British Iuck.

1542
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:23,398
Do you think
he can he be made to do it?

1543
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,734
You trust his UncIe Bertie.
He'II do as he's toId.

1544
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:28,445
But I'm perfectIy fit, UncIe.

1545
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:30,572
Yes, yes, I know you're perfectIy fit.

1546
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:34,493
This is just a formuIa, used every day.
Army poIitics... whatever you Iike.

1547
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,745
I do wish you'd stop worrying
about me, UncIe.

1548
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,456
Resignation wouId be
far too easy a way out.

1549
01:29:39,582 --> 01:29:41,083
What you've done
has been wonderfuI,

1550
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,752
and there's no question
of my Ietting you down now.

1551
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:46,505
That's very nice of you, StanIey.
I appreciate it, but...

1552
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:49,549
No, no, UncIe.
I wouIdn't dream of it.

1553
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:52,052
You've aIready sacrificed that contract.

1554
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:54,846
I'm not gonna have you
sacrifice your principIes as weII.

1555
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:57,933
Don't be such a damned fooI, StanIey.
To heII with my principIes!

1556
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:00,477
The two heroes of the hour.

1557
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:03,772
They're stiII caIIing for you, StanIey.
You simpIy must show yourseIf.

1558
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:06,358
- ReaIIy, Aunt DoIIy, must I?
- Indeed, you must!

1559
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,902
And you too, Bertie.
Come aIong.

1560
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:20,080
Quiet, feIIers, quiet!

1561
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:23,500
Tonight at eight-thirty,
we are presenting once again

1562
01:30:23,626 --> 01:30:26,378
our popuIar discussion programme
"Argument".

1563
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:30,132
and the subject this evening
is the present industriaI strike.

1564
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:32,217
The producers have arranged

1565
01:30:32,343 --> 01:30:35,303
for some of the Ieading personaIities
connected with the strike

1566
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,055
to appear in the programme.

1567
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:40,559
So you wiII hear a spokesman
for the management,

1568
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:42,811
for the shop stewards,

1569
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:47,399
and of course Mr StanIey Windrush
who was the cause of the strike.

1570
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:49,484
The chairman
wiII be MaIcoIm Muggeridge,

1571
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:52,112
so don't forget to Iook in at eight-thirty.

1572
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:01,788
If you'd Iike to put your things in here,
then come down to the make-up room.

1573
01:31:01,914 --> 01:31:04,332
It's just down the corridor.
The others are aIready there.

1574
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,126
Thank you very much.

1575
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,615
That's right, Stan.

1576
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:40,577
- It's yours.
- Coxie...

1577
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:43,163
What on earth are you doing here?

1578
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:45,665
That's your cut.
A IittIe idea of mine.

1579
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:49,169
My cut?

1580
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:52,672
WeII, you didn't think we was
going to Ieave you out, did you?

1581
01:31:52,798 --> 01:31:55,717
OnIy of course, you've got to do
what your uncIe says.

1582
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:58,887
What on earth are you taIking about?

1583
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:01,431
Resign, on grounds of iII heaIth.

1584
01:32:01,557 --> 01:32:04,726
Now, I've aIready had aII this out
with UncIe.

1585
01:32:06,103 --> 01:32:08,355
Now, Iook at me, oId Stan.

1586
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:12,192
This is a bit deIicate.

1587
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:14,945
I daresay your UncIe Bertie
wouIdn't Iike me teIIing you aII this,

1588
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:19,449
but if you don't resign,
the strike goes on.

1589
01:32:19,575 --> 01:32:22,577
And we aII Iose
a hundred thousand smackers!

1590
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:23,745
Who's "we"?

1591
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:30,293
WeII, there's me, your UncIe Bertie
and that bIack feIIow Mohammed.

1592
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:33,964
This is absoIute nonsense.

1593
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:36,216
UncIe's firm's aIready Iost the contract.

1594
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,635
WeII, yes, in a way.

1595
01:32:40,137 --> 01:32:42,556
To me... Union Jack Foundries.

1596
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:46,017
You see what it is.
It's business.

1597
01:32:46,143 --> 01:32:47,727
High finance and that...

1598
01:32:47,853 --> 01:32:51,064
Are you suggesting UncIe Bertram
stirred up aII this troubIe deIiberateIy?

1599
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:54,192
That's right.
With your heIp, don't forget.

1600
01:32:54,318 --> 01:32:56,778
OnIy, it's got to stop now,
or it's no good.

1601
01:32:57,905 --> 01:32:59,906
I'm going crazy!

1602
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,992
I'd have thought
if you wanted to stop the strike,

1603
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:03,868
you wouId have been taIking to Mr Kite.

1604
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:07,247
We have, Stan.
Very amicabIe, too.

1605
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:10,041
It was him who suggested
the iII-heaIth Iark.

1606
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:16,089
- There you are, Mr Kite.
- Thank you, Miss.

1607
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:20,343
Ask the girI to go and see
what's happened to Mr Windrush.

1608
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:22,137
I know you won't say nothing,

1609
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:26,474
because if you do, your UncIe Bertie
wiII go inside for a few years.

1610
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,602
KiII your Aunt DoIIy, that wouId.

1611
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:31,896
Anyway, I prefer to be honest,
put my cards on the tabIe.

1612
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:34,274
Quite a change for you.

1613
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:38,570
Yes, weII, you take my advice, Stan.

1614
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:40,822
When it's your turn on the oId teIIy,

1615
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:43,908
get up quietIy and teII them
you want to resign.

1616
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:45,535
Right?

1617
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:49,331
Ta-ta!

1618
01:33:57,923 --> 01:34:00,133
Make-up's waiting for you,
Mr Windrush.

1619
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:02,761
Mr Windrush!

1620
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:05,889
They're waiting for you.

1621
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:09,434
Yes, of course!

1622
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:22,781
'On the air in five seconds.

1623
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:24,115
'Quiet, everybody!

1624
01:34:24,241 --> 01:34:27,786
'Four... three... two... one.'

1625
01:34:33,459 --> 01:34:36,961
"Argument". The programme
that puts you in the picture.

1626
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:53,561
Good evening.

1627
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:57,565
The subject on everyone's mind today
is unquestionabIy the strike.

1628
01:34:58,192 --> 01:35:01,444
'Now, some peopIe think
that the nationaI economy

1629
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:04,072
'is being endangered
by the irresponsibIe...'

1630
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,532
'Ere! Turn it up, wiII you?

1631
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:10,412
Other peopIe take the view
that the Iiving standards of the workers

1632
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:13,331
have been viciousIy attacked
by the empIoyers,

1633
01:35:13,457 --> 01:35:15,792
who in any case
are in breach of contract.

1634
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:20,004
We've got in the studio
four peopIe intimateIy concerned

1635
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,924
in the deveIopment
of this unhappy situation.

1636
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:26,970
On my right is His ExceIIency,
Mr Mohammed.

1637
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:29,973
And next to him, Mr TracepurceI.

1638
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:33,476
Then, on my Ieft, Mr Kite.

1639
01:35:33,602 --> 01:35:36,104
And next to him, Mr Windrush.

1640
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:39,858
Before turning these gentIemen over
to the studio audience for questioning,

1641
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:43,278
I'm going to ask each of them
to make a brief individuaI statement.

1642
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:45,905
And I'm going to begin with Mr Kite.

1643
01:35:46,031 --> 01:35:49,659
Now, Mr Kite, as Chairman
of the works committee at MissiIes,

1644
01:35:49,785 --> 01:35:51,536
where do you stand?

1645
01:35:52,788 --> 01:35:54,622
Um... oh, yes.

1646
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:59,669
Um, the situation
is quite straightforward.

1647
01:36:00,963 --> 01:36:05,717
As trades unionists,
we have aIways been concerned with...

1648
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:09,637
for efficiency
and for the individuaI worker.

1649
01:36:10,514 --> 01:36:12,348
And it is...

1650
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:15,518
It is for that reason

1651
01:36:15,644 --> 01:36:19,147
that we oppose the attempt
of the management

1652
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:21,691
to overwork the man on the job.

1653
01:36:21,817 --> 01:36:23,860
Hear, hear!

1654
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:29,949
It is for that reason that we oppose
the introduction of bIackIeg Iabour.

1655
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:31,743
Hear, hear!

1656
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:34,454
And it is for that same reason...

1657
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:45,799
It is for that same reason
that we oppose...

1658
01:36:47,259 --> 01:36:48,802
Erm...

1659
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:52,430
That reason we oppose...

1660
01:36:52,556 --> 01:36:54,015
Hear, hear!

1661
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:55,183
Thank you, Mr Kite.

1662
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:57,268
You've made the point, I think.

1663
01:36:57,394 --> 01:36:59,604
Now I'm going to caII on Mr Windrush,

1664
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:02,148
who, as a worker at MissiIes,

1665
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:05,193
might perhaps be described
as the odd man in.

1666
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:08,863
And now, Mr Windrush,
what have you got to say?

1667
01:37:17,706 --> 01:37:19,874
Mr Windrush.

1668
01:37:25,589 --> 01:37:30,343
I'm going to find it pretty difficuIt
to say what I want to say in a few words.

1669
01:37:31,595 --> 01:37:34,973
In fact, I'm onIy now
just beginning to catch on.

1670
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,978
As my friend KnowIes
wouId have said,

1671
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:42,313
I must have been dead stupid.

1672
01:37:43,023 --> 01:37:45,942
I've swaIIowed everything
they have given me to swaIIow.

1673
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:48,069
Everything!

1674
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:52,657
AII the phoney patriotic cIaptrap
of the empIoyers.

1675
01:37:52,783 --> 01:37:56,077
AII the biIge I've heard taIked
about workers' rights

1676
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:58,413
untiI my head's reeIing
with the stink of it aII.

1677
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:03,918
The troubIe is, everybody's got so used
to the smeII, they no Ionger notice it.

1678
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:06,462
Furthermore, they're deaf, too.

1679
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:08,590
So deaf
they can't even hear the fiddIes.

1680
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:10,967
In fact, they don't want to.

1681
01:38:11,093 --> 01:38:15,263
Wherever you Iook, it's a case of
"BIow you, Jack, I'm aII right".

1682
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:16,598
On a point of order, Mr Chairman...

1683
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:19,392
I might have known
you'd have a point of order.

1684
01:38:19,518 --> 01:38:21,311
Hey, this is going to be a beaut...

1685
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,354
This meeting
has got to foIIow the ruIes...

1686
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,940
- Shut up, Fred!
- Mum!

1687
01:38:26,066 --> 01:38:27,859
We aII know
your proper procedure.

1688
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:31,362
Hang a chap without giving him a hearing.
Is that what they do in the Soviet Union?

1689
01:38:31,488 --> 01:38:34,282
I protest. My poIitics is a matter
between my conscience

1690
01:38:34,408 --> 01:38:36,242
- and the baIIot box.
- Your poIitics?

1691
01:38:36,368 --> 01:38:38,411
"To each according to his needs,

1692
01:38:38,537 --> 01:38:40,455
"from each as IittIe
as he can get away with,

1693
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:44,250
"and no overtime except on Sundays
at doubIe the rate."

1694
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:46,669
That's a damn fine way
to buiId a new JerusaIem.

1695
01:38:46,795 --> 01:38:50,465
Mr Chairman, I do think that we aII
ought to try and deaI with each other fairIy.

1696
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:53,426
Don't you faII for that soft soap,
Mr Muggeridge.

1697
01:38:53,552 --> 01:38:55,303
When a deaI's fair for UncIe Bertie,

1698
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:57,805
you can bet your Iife
it's a wet and windy one for the rest of us.

1699
01:38:57,932 --> 01:38:59,557
Sit down, StanIey,
you're making a fooI of yourseIf.

1700
01:38:59,683 --> 01:39:01,476
You and your taIk of "country"!

1701
01:39:01,602 --> 01:39:03,186
You're waving a great big Union Jack,

1702
01:39:03,312 --> 01:39:05,063
so nobody can see
what you're up to behind it.

1703
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:06,606
What does the idiot think he's doing?

1704
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:09,692
- What the deviI are you pIaying at?
- Not your IittIe game, UncIe Bertie.

1705
01:39:09,818 --> 01:39:12,362
'You've cheated everyone,
even Aunt DoIIy.'

1706
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,739
- 'You Ieave my mother out of this!'
- 'Pon my souI!

1707
01:39:14,865 --> 01:39:16,574
'You're a bounder,
UncIe Bertie,

1708
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:20,411
'a streamIined, chromium-pIated,
oId-fashioned bounder.'

1709
01:39:20,537 --> 01:39:22,330
- You cad!
- You humbug!

1710
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:24,374
- You traitor!
- You twister!

1711
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,250
- Snake!
- Skunk!

1712
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:28,711
GentIemen! GentIemen, pIease...

1713
01:39:28,837 --> 01:39:32,423
- What we want to get at are the facts.
- The facts?

1714
01:39:32,549 --> 01:39:34,884
I've got the facts over here.

1715
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:39,806
Here they are. Hundreds of them.

1716
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:46,396
These are the onIy facts
that interest anybody in this dispute.

1717
01:39:47,189 --> 01:39:49,941
This is what they aII want.
This is aII they want.

1718
01:39:51,443 --> 01:39:52,610
Something for nothing.

1719
01:40:11,213 --> 01:40:13,256
Camera three onto MurieI!

1720
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:17,760
We're sorry to have to Ieave "Argument"
at this point,

1721
01:40:17,886 --> 01:40:21,055
but a technicaI hitch has deveIoped
which is beyond our controI.

1722
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:23,391
'We expect to resume
normaI services shortIy.'

1723
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:25,435
BIimey! Ain't it marveIIous?

1724
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:28,604
Just when they was getting
niceIy warmed up. Ain't it marveIIous?

1725
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:32,191
Brothers, pIease! Brothers!

1726
01:40:32,317 --> 01:40:34,444
Use your seIf-controI!

1727
01:40:39,074 --> 01:40:40,908
Give me that! That's mine!

1728
01:41:05,809 --> 01:41:10,188
This is the sort of conduct
society can never... will never toIerate.

1729
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:13,608
You wiIfuIIy instigated
these disorderIy scenes,

1730
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:15,735
and in the course of doing so,
you saw fit

1731
01:41:15,861 --> 01:41:19,113
to make a wicked and sIanderous attack
upon the integrity of your empIoyer,

1732
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:22,950
a man sureIy entitIed
to your gratitude and IoyaIty.

1733
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:24,077
Not content with this,

1734
01:41:24,203 --> 01:41:27,580
you impugned the motives and actions
of your feIIow workers

1735
01:41:27,706 --> 01:41:30,625
in the person
of their representative, Mr Kite.

1736
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:33,961
He offered you comradeship,
and he gave you sheIter.

1737
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:36,672
His reward has been
your treachery and spite.

1738
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:50,812
WiII that Iady kindIy compose herseIf
or Ieave the court?

1739
01:41:52,189 --> 01:41:53,731
- Shut up, wiII you?
- Fred!

1740
01:41:53,857 --> 01:41:55,441
- You shut up, too!
- Fred!

1741
01:41:55,567 --> 01:41:57,443
In the face of these outrages,

1742
01:41:57,569 --> 01:42:00,530
your victims behaved
with remarkabIe generosity.

1743
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:02,490
Rather than testify against you,

1744
01:42:02,616 --> 01:42:05,243
Mr Mohammed has invoked
his dipIomatic immunity.

1745
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:08,704
Mr TracepurceI and Mr Kite
were both emphatic in their pIea

1746
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:11,749
that your behaviour
couId onIy be expIained by iII heaIth,

1747
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:13,543
brought on by overwork.

1748
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:15,878
In the circumstances,
I am prepared to accept

1749
01:42:16,004 --> 01:42:19,715
that your conduct
was in part due to a mentaI instabiIity.

1750
01:42:20,509 --> 01:42:23,177
Provided that you
immediateIy seek medicaI aid,

1751
01:42:23,303 --> 01:42:26,556
you'II be bound over to keep the peace
for the period of one year.

1752
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:41,654
Good shot, Major!

1753
01:42:46,285 --> 01:42:49,412
GIorious worId to be aIive in.-

1754
01:42:49,538 --> 01:42:51,914
- PeacefuI here, isn't it?
- Yes, I suppose it is.

1755
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:55,835
Rather a contrast to aII
the undignified rushing and grabbing

1756
01:42:55,961 --> 01:42:58,171
- that goes on outside, eh, StanIey?
- Yes, Father.

1757
01:42:58,297 --> 01:43:01,465
We've turned our back
on aII that kind of vuIgarity.

1758
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:03,843
We're onIy interested in
the simpIe things

1759
01:43:03,969 --> 01:43:06,053
that mankind has aIways been after.

1760
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:08,472
Yoo-hoo! Mr Windrush?

1761
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:12,185
- Is that your son with you?
- Yes, do you want him?

1762
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:13,811
Goodie!

1763
01:43:13,937 --> 01:43:15,646
StanIey, wouId you Iike
to come and pIay with us?

1764
01:43:15,772 --> 01:43:18,816
We're going to have a tournament.
Knockout, you know...

1765
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:22,320
Thanks, but I don't think
I'm reaIIy quite up to it.

1766
01:43:22,446 --> 01:43:24,113
Nonsense, StanIey,
a young feIIow Iike you?

1767
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:26,115
Go on, be a sport.

1768
01:43:26,241 --> 01:43:28,701
- I bet you're joIIy good.
- Come on, StanIey!

1769
01:43:28,827 --> 01:43:30,828
None of us are terribIy hot, you know.

1770
01:43:32,497 --> 01:43:34,498
- I wouIdn't be any good, honestIy.
- Rubbish!

1771
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:36,542
He's onIyjust being modest.

1772
01:43:36,668 --> 01:43:39,003
Come on, Iadies,
come and make him pIay.

1773
01:43:44,426 --> 01:43:45,509
No!

1774
01:43:46,762 --> 01:43:48,721
