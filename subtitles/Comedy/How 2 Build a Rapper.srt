1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,200
We just want to be
the best at what we do.


2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,120
And we don't engage
in any programme,


3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,080
be it Formula 1 or
the production of the McLaren 12C,


4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,040
unless we can realistically expect
to be the best in the world.


5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,720
If you built a Formula 1 car
and you wanted it


6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,400
to go as quick as it possibly could
with massive amounts of horsepower,


7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,400
these are the trick bits
you'd put on a Formula 1 car.


8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,200
It's British engineering
at its best.


9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,920
We're taking on
the world of sports cars.


10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,960
Formula 1 has the most
technically-advanced gadgets,


11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,360
you know,
it's like NASA of motorsport.


12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,720
I think NASA would compare
themselves to us, to be honest.


13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,320
The temperatures coming out
of the exhausts are approximately
about 800 degrees,


14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,560
so we've seen problems
with the bumpers melting before.


15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,600
To actually be here
looking at the car like this,


16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,160
at this stage of the programme,
is unheard of.


17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,800
This is almost as if
it's in the womb of the mother,


18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,160
and not even the doctor
has seen it yet.


19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,480
This is a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.


20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,040
Heavy most of the time,
hot some of the time.


21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
It's more than just
one person's dream,


22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,240
this holds really the future key
to 800 jobs in automotive.


23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,200
There's a lot riding
on this working.


24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,640
Hidden amongst
the Surrey countryside


25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,680
lies a building like no other.


26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,160
The glass-and-steel structure is
the brainchild of both the architect


27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,520
and one of Britain's best automotive
engineers, McLaren boss Ron Dennis.


28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,840
Lots of people visit this facility
and sort of cross-reference us


29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
to a sort of Bond film or something.


30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,240
I haven't quite had a stuffed
white cat presented to me


31
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,160
to stroke at my desk, but
those comparisons have been drawn.


32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,200
Is that such a bad thing, though?


33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,120
I mean, what's being portrayed
is someone who is


34
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,720
clearly looking to have


35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,280
an incredible environment in which
to take on the world.


36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,440
And it's an environment


37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,800
where every detail
is thoroughly thought through.


38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,240
Ron is obsessed with perfection.


39
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,880
Now here there's a broken tile.


40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,880
Most people would be annoyed
and just, as I am, thinking,


41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,720
"Oh, that's a broken tile."


42
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,040
But the reality is that when
it's changed it will be imperfection


43
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,840
because effectively
the colour won't match.


44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,520
It's impossible.
Tiles come in batches, therefore...


45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,480
you can see here, this one's been
changed. Doesn't that bug you?


46
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,280
It bugs me. Big time.


47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,440
It's 7.30am
and one of McLaren's newest recruits


48
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,960
is on her way to work.


49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,920
My name's Rachel, I'm 19 and
I'm currently a trainee at McLaren,


50
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,280
so after I've done that, I'll become
a full-time production member.
There's


51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,840
the big McLaren sign there,
which is lit up red


52
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,320
when either Jenson or Lewis
wins at a Grand Prix.


53
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,720
Rachel Melvin is
an apprentice production engineer.


54
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,560
It really does look like
a Batcave entrance with
the spiral staircase going down


55
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,320
and you can't really see anything


56
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,560
until you get back up
inside the building.


57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,840
This is not really
a general entrance corridor,


58
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,080
like any
other building would have.


59
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,200
I thought at first it looked like
Charlie And The Chocolate Factory.


60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,960
You know, when they've got
that massive white door


61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,320
that goes into nowhere.


62
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,920
There's no question in my mind you
are being mentally de-cluttered,


63
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,560
and it's a cleansing experience.


64
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,160
You are stimulated by the whiteness.


65
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,400
I think there's a slightly sterile
feel, but it's a small price to pay


66
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
for someone coming into the building
and then having the impact


67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,080
of all the colour that comes as a
result of the products that we make.


68
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,200
Comfy trainers off,
big, clumpy work boots on.


69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,160
Not really a girlie-type shoe,
but have to put up with it.


70
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,080
It really is a maze,
it's unbelievable.


71
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,520
Unless you know where your going
you'll definitely get lost.


72
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,920
If you look at these two sides,
you can see


73
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,360
that side is exactly
the same as that side.


74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,440
It's very easy to look at things
in this building and question


75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,160
what anal mind is behind it
and what is the thinking behind it.


76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,080
Of course, it's very apparent
that it's very clean.


77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,480
It's less apparent
that it is odourless.


78
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,920
It is also a constant temperature.


79
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,160
We hold the whole building
within one degree of 22 degrees.


80
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,360
There's no clutter in this building.
Cluttered building, cluttered minds.


81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,040
It's the attention to detail that
I'm really quite well known for.


82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,800
And in his search for perfection,
Ron hopes the building's message


83
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,320
can translate into
McLaren's newest venture.


84
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,440
I've worked in a few garages before,


85
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
which is a lot more of
a mucky environment,


86
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,960
which I didn't like too much.


87
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,280
This is a much better environment
to work in,


88
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,840
you don't smell of grease,


89
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,120
you go home cleaner than you were
before you came into work.


90
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,080
The company is
branching out of Formula 1


91
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,960
and, for the first time ever,


92
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,760
they aim to create and produce
a range of road cars.


93
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,920
I'm the privileged one
that's orchestrating it.


94
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,400
But I'm certainly not the only one.


95
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,120
I am merely a chapter in the book.


96
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,760
The first is the MP4-12C,


97
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,240
which is being built
in a special production line


98
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,680
right next door to
the company's Formula 1 cars.


99
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,200
This is the production hall


100
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,840
where the whole car is
built from start to finish.


101
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,000
This car doesn't really look like
a car at the moment.


102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,760
As you can see, great big hole there


103
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,920
where the engine will go
when it's fitted.


104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,040
Gearbox also attached to engine.


105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,960
There is some interior,
such as the dash


106
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,920
and some of the carpet inside,
you've got a lot of the wiring


107
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,440
going on here, which obviously
has to go in first.


108
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,640
Moving down to this car,


109
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,000
we've got some brake discs
and callipers on it.


110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,920
These are the carbon ceramic
brake discs.


111
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,640
The car's now looking
more like a car.


112
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
It opens this way.


113
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,320
If you move round to the front, you
can also see that the bonnet's on


114
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,440
and the front side panels
are also on.


115
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,760
This new venture is a big risk.
The company has already invested


116
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,880
nearly £800 million


117
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,480
into what is a very competitive
and established industry.


118
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,920
It's great for engineering within
the UK


119
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,000
to have a real brand that's
exciting, can really take the fight


120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,880
to a lot of brands around the world


121
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,400
and supercars around the world.


122
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,840
At £168,500 each, the new car


123
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,280
is clearly aiming at
high-end, luxury customers,


124
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
customers who just might want


125
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,760
a piece of Formula 1 engineering
for themselves.


126
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,000
But it's a big gamble
for the company.


127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,600
I think this represents
the best of world engineering


128
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,560
because there is
nowhere else in the world


129
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,080
they're going to be able to match
what our team's able to do.


130
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,640
At this end of the building,
we have the Formula 1 team


131
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,360
with all the inherent technologies


132
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,000
that are needed to support it.


133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,960
Here are the cars that were racing
just two days ago.


134
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,920
Engineering innovations from
over 50 years of experience


135
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,320
have often placed McLaren
on the winning podium,


136
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,480
but Ron knows
he'll have to enjoy the same success
with his new venture


137
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,400
if it's to pay off.


138
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,160
I've never really embraced
coming second.


139
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,760
I've always considered coming second
as being the first of the losers.


140
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,360
Formula 1 technology
means the company builds


141
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,760
some of the fastest and most
sophisticated cars in the world,


142
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,120
but mass-producing this car is
going to be a whole new ball game.


143
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,080
The car started life in the hands
of this man and his team -


144
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,680
chief designer Frank Stephenson.


145
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,800
We're the guys
that sit on the airplane,


146
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,680
we don't watch movies,
we sketch or we're sitting
at a table in a restaurant,


147
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,680
we're sketching on the napkin,
we sketch in our heads.


148
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,160
Designers, I think
that's just a normal thing
to sketch, sketch, sketch.


149
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,480
Car designers like Frank use
all sorts of inspiration.


150
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,600
I personally keep some of
my favourite animals in the studio.


151
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,720
Sharks, there's a horse.


152
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:09,560
I love that. I love shapes, so this
is one of my favourite shapes.


153
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,120
I get a lot of inspiration from
looking at sculptures such as that.


154
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,560
I'm never bored.
Just walking down the street,


155
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,040
you can find so many things,


156
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,440
not just the shops,
you can find things on the sidewalk,


157
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,480
the type of tiles,
the paintings on the signs,


158
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,640
there's always something
to inspire you.


159
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,000
So where'd my bike go?


160
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,680
My big interest
since I was a kid was motorcycles.


161
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,560
This just keeps me inspired
because I look at it and think,


162
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,440
if I had done it I probably would
have ended up with something


163
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,840
a bit different than that.


164
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,800
I love that guy.


165
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,440
You know, you'd think we're kids,


166
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,160
because we're allowed to have
these toys in front of us -


167
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,840
that's the nature
of any designer,


168
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,040
you'll find they have
a toy shop around them.


169
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,120
The Fokker Dr.I,
this is my favourite plane.


170
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,840
Morning, Mark.


171
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,280
Hi, Frank.


172
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,000
And Frank's inspiration
doesn't stop with his toys.


173
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,520
I mean, if you look
at the animal kingdom


174
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,040
you'll see a lot of animals
that were build for speed.


175
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,920
None of them have fat on them,
they're all shrink-wrapped.


176
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,040
I mean, you could
really relate to all the energy
being coiled over the rear wheels,


177
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,120
especially because that's the
driving part of our car at the back,


178
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,960
as an animal,
or a cheetah or whatever,


179
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,840
they're driving off their
rear legs most of the time


180
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,040
and you get the undulations
of the skin


181
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,280
and the muscles actually
pushing through.
That's an element


182
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,320
that we're starting to actually
bring into the design.


183
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,240
Animals that have gone through
hundreds of thousands of years of
evolution, are still around,


184
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,440
still look extremely beautiful,


185
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,480
nobody says that a cheetah
doesn't look beautiful.


186
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,720
You know, it's
an optimised design of what works.


187
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,880
And therein lies the beauty
of perfected design.


188
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,120
While computers help Frank
conceptualise his designs,


189
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,000
it's vital for him to bring
his computer images to life.
Something he can physically touch.


190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,640
Good. Now I'm going to take
you into the design studio.


191
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,600
It's probably
the most restricted area


192
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,280
in the McLaren Technology Centre,


193
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,720
very rare that people come
in here even within McLaren itself,


194
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,960
so what I'll show you is what
we actually do in here.


195
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,320
And when you come in,


196
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,440
you'll notice
there's a very sticky pad here.


197
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,840
That collects anything
that's on your feet,


198
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,000
so we have a very, very clean area
here to work in.


199
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,600
What you are going to see
is the clay model


200
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
and, contrary to popular belief,


201
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,040
it's actually done by people
who build it by hand


202
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,600
so mostly they're like
trained sculptors


203
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,720
who are very, very efficient
at creating a physical object


204
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,400
from a sketch and they are masters
at what they do.


205
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,840
McLaren are incredibly secretive
when it comes to showing off their
clay designs,


206
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,080
because they are constantly
experimenting with the finer shapes
and contours for their cars.


207
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,040
To actually be here
looking at the car like this


208
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,720
is unheard of,
we don't let anybody in.


209
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,440
I mean, for us,
it's a joy to come in


210
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,800
and see the baby sort of
being developed.


211
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,200
This is almost as
if it's in the womb of the mother.


212
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
The advantage of clay,


213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,880
it's been around for
the whole history of car design,


214
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,440
is because you can actually
put it on the model


215
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,160
and then if you
put too much on you can take it off,


216
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,440
if you need more, you can put it on.
It's almost a labour of love.


217
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,680
You have to actually get
very close to the model


218
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,440
and feel how the transition
from a hard radius


219
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,360
goes to a softer radius. We can't
do that on a computer screen.


220
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,960
It's almost as if you could
design the car blind.


221
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,040
You don't have to see it you,
have to feel it,


222
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,520
and by feeling it, you feel if
it's right or if it's not right.


223
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,160
The design work is obviously
the first thing a customer sees.


224
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,560
But underneath the skin,
engineers have taken advantage


225
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,600
of some of their
Formula 1 innovations.


226
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,560
Chief mechanic to racing legends
Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost,


227
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,920
Neil Trundle has worked with McLaren
for over four decades.


228
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,200
You do 10, 15, 20 years
of travelling


229
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,640
and then you kind of think
you've seen every hotel and track.


230
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,920
The passion doesn't go but then you
want to find a job at base,


231
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,000
see the family.


232
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,280
This is the F1 preparation area,


233
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:15,200
where we prepare the cars
for demonstrations, for testing,


234
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,880
and also,
we prepare our old historic cars.


235
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,040
This is MP4/1, the first
carbon-chassis car ever made.


236
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,160
This is an old friend
of the family.


237
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,880
The new car has its genesis
in this Formula 1 car,


238
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,160
the first to use
a lightweight material


239
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,320
borrowed from
the aerospace industry -


240
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,680
carbon fibre.


241
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,120
Everyone had narrow chassis,
same kind of shape as this,


242
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,440
but because of this
inherently weak area here,


243
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,080
the aluminium chassis were twisting.
When we did the carbon chassis,


244
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,520
we realised we achieved
a 100% stiffer chassis


245
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,960
than had been made before,


246
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,040
so suddenly our car was, you know,
the leading technology.


247
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,120
Some of the other teams said
that it was a fragile material,


248
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,880
that it would shatter,


249
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,800
but all the accidents we've had in
it proved that it was up to the job.


250
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,280
And since then, carbon chassis
have got stronger and stronger


251
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,320
and safer and safer.


252
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,720
But this was the start of it.


253
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,200
Not only was the company's
carbon chassis stronger and safer,


254
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,560
it was also a lot lighter,


255
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,760
which meant acceleration
and handling were greatly improved.


256
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,480
And applying these design features
to the new road car


257
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,200
has obvious advantages.


258
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,320
In the 1990s,
McLaren set the land-speed record


259
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,480
for the fastest road car
at the time -


260
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,040
240mph in this, the XP5.


261
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,760
The secret was the carbon-fibre
chassis, called a monocell.


262
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,200
But it took 4,000 man hours to make


263
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,840
and cost the lion's share
of the £600,000 price tag,


264
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,520
so production numbers were limited.


265
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,320
But through precision engineering,


266
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,360
strength like this can now be
mass-produced by the company


267
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,200
at a much lower cost.


268
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,120
How do you make a composite car,
which is normally unaffordable,


269
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,880
ie north of 500,000 euros,


270
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,200
how can you make the same car
for 2,000 euros?


271
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,800
Well, that remains
a closely-guarded secret at McLaren.


272
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,640
But, all of the new road cars
start life like this,


273
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,040
a carbon-fibre tub.


274
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,360
This is the very first component
that goes to making the car.


275
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,480
Without the tub,


276
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,240
the interior
doesn't have anywhere to fit


277
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,200
and you can't put
the crash structure on,


278
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,080
you can't put the engine in,
you can't put the body panels on.


279
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,680
Everything about this tub


280
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,520
is maximised to combine
as many functions as possible


281
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
into a single component.


282
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,520
Everything has to be perfect
in order for us


283
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,320
to be able to build the car.


284
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,160
The tub is made away from
prying eyes in a factory in Austria.


285
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,200
Now what I have here is
a Biax material,


286
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
which means that on one side,
you have fibres running that way,


287
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,000
and on the other side,
you have fibres running that way.


288
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,520
That's held together by the
stitching that you can see here.


289
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,320
Now, by layering this up
in different ways,


290
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,400
by using the Triax material
and the Biax material,


291
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,480
we can orientate the strength
in the direction that we want it


292
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,440
without adding additional weight.


293
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,120
Pieces of carbon fibre are layered
until they form the correct shape.


294
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,160
This is the part of the process
that I'm really excited about.


295
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,920
It's where we actually combine
the carbon-fibre pre-forms


296
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,280
with the resin that
will hold the whole lot together


297
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,960
and form the carbon monocell.


298
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,680
So, we have three different areas
of this system.


299
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,360
We have
the pre-form loading section,


300
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
which is what you can see behind me,


301
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,320
we have the transfer system,


302
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,960
which will then take the tool from
this area into the press


303
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,120
and we then have
the resin injection system,


304
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,040
and that is where
all of the clever bits are done.


305
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,080
This machine is where
a secret process


306
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,520
injects a resin into the mould
under intense pressure.


307
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,360
Unfortunately, I can't go into
too many details


308
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,120
because it is top secret,
it's the sensitive area of the tub


309
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,640
where we really don't want
everyone to understand


310
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,280
exactly how we make what is
effectively the recipe for the tub.


311
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,800
This secret system
is completely unique to McLaren


312
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,920
and means a new tub can now
be produced about every four hours.


313
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,120
With this process, we've reduced
the number of man hours it takes


314
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,520
to build the chassis from 4,000
on the F1 road car


315
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,680
down to four hours on the MP4-12C,
which makes me really proud.


316
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,400
Once the engineers have
the monocell back in the UK,


317
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,080
the rest of the car
can start to be built.


318
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,800
The first stage of the assembly
takes place at Unit 22,


319
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
two miles from the main building.


320
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,840
Welcome to body assembly.


321
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,800
So this is the start of the MP4-12C.


322
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,120
This is where
we get the first components,


323
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,160
the start of
the production line for us.


324
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,760
So within this unit,
we're completing that monocell


325
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,840
prior to it going to paint.


326
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,400
The first things added to the tub
are the crash structures,


327
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,800
which help absorb energy
in the event of an impact.


328
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,880
Every car is hand-built


329
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,400
and assembled by
a team of engineers.


330
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,400
You load these longies,
you load them into here,


331
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,600
with the clamps and so what,
slide it in, slide it in,


332
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,880
put the bolts in,
tighten the bolts up.


333
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,080
Job's a good 'un, out it comes.


334
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,400
It looks all technical
and tricky and that,


335
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,040
but it's just three parts there.


336
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,480
All that, just to put three
parts on, that's what the jig's for,


337
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
to make sure they're
all in the right position.


338
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,680
Many of the body parts
are made from a special,
lightweight plastic material


339
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,600
and are secured using
an extremely strong adhesive.


340
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,040
This allows them to bond plastic,
carbon fibre and aluminium together


341
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,400
and is the same bonding technique


342
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,680
used in
the aircraft and space industries.


343
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,040
Better than superglue.
But you've got two parts to it -


344
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,320
you've got the orange
and the yellow sides.


345
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,040
One is harder. Once it's bonded,
it doesn't come apart.


346
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,480
Once you've applied all the adhesive


347
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,160
then you've got to put the parts
into the jig.


348
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,800
You line it up
on these two holes here,


349
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,160
which line up on
these two pins here


350
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,760
and then you put that in, pull the
clamp round and locks it into place.


351
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,080
With the body panels attached,


352
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,480
the car is moved from jig to jig,


353
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,720
where the various other parts
are fitted into place.


354
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,080
It's like a big Airfix kit,
really, you know,


355
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,920
it's a similar thing,
obviously a bit more complicated.


356
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,720
There's so many clamps and heaters,


357
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,320
you've just got to make sure
they're all on.


358
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,440
With the car's outer pillars
in place,


359
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,280
the rear body upper structure
is attached.


360
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,760
Then the side panels, which attach
to the lower side of the car.


361
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,640
And with the rear panels fitted,
the roof tops the list
and the body is complete.


362
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,160
The body is then taken
to a huge robot arm,


363
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,960
which measures 356 points to make
sure everything is in place to
within thousandths of a millimetre.


364
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,720
The process time within
body assembly, from getting
that carbon fibre tub


365
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,960
to a completed monocell
that you see on the CMM
is a total of 495 minutes.


366
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,440
Our main aim in the facility
in MPC is to get one car out
every 45 minutes.


367
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,840
Currently, the new car is assembled
within two separate buildings,


368
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,720
but to streamline the process,
a new facility is being built
to house everything under one roof.


369
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,800
And if the company's to make
this a viable project,


370
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,880
they need to ramp up production
from 10 to over 80 cars a week.


371
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:08,000
One of the biggest challenges when
you're trying to build a super car,
is without question, paint quality.


372
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,040
Painting cars is often
an automated process,


373
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,160
but here, even this is done by hand.


374
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,600
It's going to take over 12 hours
from the body first entering
the paint shop until it leaves.


375
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,760
And in this facility, attention
to detail is everything.


376
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,400
We do it until it's perfect,


377
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,680
until every surface on this car
is flat.


378
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,560
Until all the imperfections are
sorted, we won't let it go through.


379
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,480
It can be tough but we don't
stop until we get it right.


380
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,680
You're just fighting against dust,
dirt, sweat, water...


381
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,160
That's why we wear gloves.


382
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,440
Everything that can contaminate
paint,


383
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,600
no matter how small it is,
will contaminate it.


384
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,040
We all take pride in making sure it
is perfect and some, you know.


385
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,160
After day's work you can't wait to
jump in the shower or bath.


386
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,680
Plenty of deodorant. But the correct
stuff because some deodorants can
contaminate the paintwork.


387
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,120
Some hair gels do affect
the paint work as well,


388
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,520
but some people don't have to worry
about that.


389
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,880
I don't have to worry about
that, no. Thank you, John(!)


390
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,280
Behind the booths, paint mixer
David Carter has worked in the trade
for over 30 years.


391
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,840
This is called a paint kitchen


392
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,360
because you make stuff and create
masterpieces, if you like.


393
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,600
Different tinters
and Xirallics, metallics,
straight colours, reds, greens.


394
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,600
All colours of the rainbow and some.


395
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,720
I would imagine with these tinters
we can reproduce any colour that
you could ever imagine.


396
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,800
Today, Dave is hand mixing
volcano orange.


397
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,120
Gently stir it in, trying not to
splash any out or onto the side,


398
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,520
and with the special colours,
the extra sparkle as well.


399
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Sometimes it may just sit on
the bottom there


400
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,040
and using a clear cup you can see
those last bits in there.


401
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,480
You don't want to get to a point
where you pour it out


402
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,080
and half the ingredients are still
stuck to the side or bottom.


403
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,560
But before the paint goes on,
there's one last job to do.


404
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,360
This is an anti-static gun.


405
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,760
We pass it over the vehicle and it
takes away the static electricity,


406
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,640
which draws particles to the body
and will end up as dirt inclusion.


407
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,240
Finally, the paint can be applied.


408
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,680
This is a pressure-pot system
where all the paint is in a pot
at the front there.


409
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:07,040
The pot is charged and paint is fed
through the line at a constant rate.


410
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,360
The cars come in a variety
of colours,


411
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,800
but whatever the customer chooses,
they have to pass an eagle eye.


412
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,560
My name is Claude but my nickname
in the business


413
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
is either Hawkeye or The Master.


414
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,680
If I see something, I have to pull
it up. I just can't leave it.


415
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,040
I am fussy. I have to be for these
sort of jobs.


416
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,360
Customers are looking for perfection
and I have to deliver that.


417
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,320
I'm looking through the centre
of the door.


418
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,840
I'm looking for flat marks, which
will be where I've DA'd the panel.


419
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,840
I'm going to look through there
to see if the panel
is uniform all the way through.


420
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,400
It's going to be one of those days


421
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,680
where this panel
is going to be spot on.


422
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,840
HE LAUGHS


423
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,080
Once painted, the car is ready for
the rest of the assembly process.


424
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,000
First, is the electrics, which
come in something called a loom.


425
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,600
In this box is the wiring loom
for the car, in its entirety.


426
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,640
With over 2km of cable and 2,000
individual circuits,


427
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,720
it takes a team of three men
to put it in place.


428
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,080
The way we put the loom in is,
operator one sits in the middle


429
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,720
and feeds the loom from the inside
of the car to the rear,


430
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,800
and then feeds it to me,
operator three,


431
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,280
from the inside of
the car to the front.


432
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,240
I am, literally, the middle man.


433
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,080
One feeds and one tugs.


434
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,280
Your knees and your back,
they tend to hurt


435
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,000
after about 10, 15 minutes,
but it's not too bad.


436
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,440
You get used to it.


437
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,360
I run it across the back
and then make sure it's not twisted,


438
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,600
and once I've made sure
it's not twisted,


439
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,080
there's a fir tree up here
which I plug in,


440
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,240
and then I drop it through
this gap here,


441
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,080
work out which wires go where.


442
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,920
It's not too bad once you've done
it a few times.


443
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,040
You get the hang of it. You get to
know which plugs go which side,


444
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,320
which side the wiring loom's
got to go in.


445
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,600
It's the nervous system,
the veins.


446
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,320
Without a loom,
nothing's going to work.


447
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,680
You have to be careful of the plugs,
because they can break easily


448
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,200
if you're a bit ham-fisted with it,
but other than that, it's all right.


449
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,400
We just work all right as a team.
Everyone sort of mucks in


450
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,760
and you just get the job done,
really.


451
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,960
Help each other out where needed.


452
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,200
It's all compact. It's like moving
a stick without breaking it.


453
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,400
It's just a bit hard to move,
get into place,


454
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,360
try and get the plugs coming out
in the right directions,
just getting it sitting nice,


455
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,040
so you can put the rest
of the interior on top of it


456
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,160
without wires bulging out
everywhere.


457
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,120
It can be tricky.


458
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,880
The team fit out a loom
in just two hours,


459
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,040
but to hit the targets
for the future,


460
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,320
they'll be trying to
do this job in 45 minutes,


461
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,120
which means more workers
and more space.


462
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,880
Since March 2010, this purpose-built
production line has emerged on


463
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,760
the landscape right next to the main
building for exactly that reason.


464
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Operations Director Alan Foster
is in charge of the build.


465
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,520
It's really only when you stand up
on the hill that you actually


466
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,680
see the true scale of the
production centre.


467
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,640
All you see is the top one-third.
I mean, there's
a basement underneath here.


468
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,080
For McLaren to succeed
with their ambitious business plan


469
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,480
and recoup their costs, the new
facility has to increase production


470
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,280
to at least 2,000 cars a year.


471
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,200
So, what you've got here is
general assembly.


472
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,000
It's just a larger version
of what we saw previously


473
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,040
in the technology centre.


474
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,200
It's a row of 18 cars
on the right-hand side,


475
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,800
14 cars on the left-hand side.


476
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,920
They come back towards us before
they move off into completion.


477
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,960
When you open this door,
you'll walk onto the production
floor of McLaren Automotive.


478
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,720
This is the new production centre
for the 12C.


479
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,000
So we've got body construction,
which is just to the right of me,


480
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,480
just behind the wall is
the new paint shop,


481
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,000
and then general assembly,


482
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,360
and then final vehicle
and line certification for the cars


483
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,800
before they go out to the customers.


484
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,400
You can create a facility to do
today's job,


485
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,040
but in five years' time, that
facility possibly won't be able to
do what you want to do,


486
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,840
so then you're into
large structural changes,


487
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,640
equipment changes - very expensive -
so what we've tried to do is
maintain openness,


488
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,840
and there's only really three hard
points in the facility -


489
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,360
the rolling road, the monsoon
and the paint shop.


490
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,960
Everything else is completely
interchangeable,
at almost within a week's notice.


491
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,520
The carbon-fibre mono-cell tub
is not the only F1 innovation


492
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,240
to cascade into the new car.


493
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,360
They've also included a technology
that was actually
banned from Formula 1.


494
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,800
We've introduced some very
innovative ideas over the years.


495
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,520
Brake steer was our secret weapon.


496
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,560
Brake steer was a fourth pedal,
inside the cockpit.


497
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,400
So, conventionally, you had
three pedals - the throttle,


498
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,080
the brake and the clutch.


499
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,640
We introduced a fourth pedal
on the left,


500
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,840
and in the corner, the driver could
squeeze that pedal


501
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,240
and it biased the drive to
the outside wheel


502
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,120
and enhanced
the turning of the car.


503
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,200
Well, we kept it a secret for,
I think, about six races,


504
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,520
and then a journalist
put his camera down inside the car


505
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,560
and he got a picture of that fourth
pedal, and the secret was out.


506
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,560
But it's a great method
of improving the cornering.


507
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:51,600
Neil's car had an extra pedal, but
the 12C does this all via computer.


508
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,280
At this speed, the car would
normally follow this line,


509
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,240
but using brake steer allows it
to follow this line,


510
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,880
holding the apex of the corner
and killing any understeer.


511
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,720
By taking into account the speed
and steering angle,


512
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,920
the computer works out
the correct trajectory.


513
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,600
Located in the front luggage
compartment, it sends a signal


514
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,840
to the inside rear brake
when cornering,


515
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,520
allowing the car to effectively
pivot around the desired path.


516
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,440
So all you feel is like
someone's grabbed hold of


517
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,000
a pole on the inside
and you're swinging around it,


518
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,680
so it just buys you


519
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,800
massive cornering performance
without having to compromise
high-speed stability,


520
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,480
and so we've got
the best of both worlds.


521
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,400
But it's not just the brake steer
that helps with handling.


522
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,240
The braking system on the 12C means
it can come to a complete stop


523
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,360
from 124mph in just five seconds.


524
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Making sure the car will
stop quickly and safely
is a big responsibility,


525
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,840
and today, it falls to
trainee Rachel,
who's about to fit the brakes.


526
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,720
I've taken the brakes apart before,


527
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,320
I've taken the callipers off
and a couple of the discs,


528
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,960
but I haven't done it to process.


529
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,840
One EPB. Cool.


530
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,040
As an apprentice, Rachel is under
the watchful eye


531
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,120
of a more-experienced
assembly engineer.


532
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,480
The torque values are set
for each bolt and for whatever
material it's going into.


533
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,600
It just ensures that it's not
going to come undone


534
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,120
and it's at the highest
tightness sort of thing that the
car can go for,


535
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,840
and now it's going to
be checked by the quality engineers.


536
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,920
Charlie!
Here's our quality man.
He is a quality man.


537
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,160
I have to make sure that their
bolts are done up to...


538
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,720
within minimum tolerance.


539
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,960
Because it's an EPB,
it's a safety critical part.


540
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,280
The parking brake has to be
doubly checked,


541
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,160
just to ensure that it is
at the right torque. 354, all good.
Cool. That's fine.


542
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,400
That's probably about the
size of the wheel of my car,
let alone the disc.


543
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,280
The disc has to sit completely
flush on the hub,


544
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,240
otherwise it can cause juddering
when the car's braking.


545
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,440
You want to stop pretty quickly
from 150,


546
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,960
so you don't want it juddering
when you're trying to stop.


547
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,040
It's all done hydraulically,
so the fluid comes in here,


548
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,600
and when you put your foot
on the brake pedal,


549
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,720
pushes the fluid round the system


550
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,880
and then that'll
push the piston closed,


551
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,840
which will clamp the two pads
onto the disc.


552
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,880
That's a quick explanation, really.


553
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,760
Just make the holes are lined up
with the disc before you
start putting the bolts in.


554
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,600
That's it, yeah.


555
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,520
I've found that having small hands
is quite an advantage


556
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,160
as a lot of the guys have ended up
coming round here


557
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,520
and going "Oh, can you
just get that for me,"


558
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,680
or, "Can you just plug that in,"
or, "Can't reach it,"
so it is quite good in that respect.


559
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,800
Yeah, I worked my way up
through apprenticeship,


560
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,000
and then it's nice to see young
people like Rachel


561
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,360
coming through
and doing good stuff,


562
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,120
and it'll be nice to see them


563
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,960
work their way up as well.


564
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,240
Doing the brakes on the car
is quite tricky.


565
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,000
You've got to make sure
everything's aligned
and sitting right on the car,


566
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,920
and she does it perfectly, really.


567
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,000
Hopefully, when I've worked out
how to do it today,


568
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,720
I'll be more confident in
changing any of the brakes,


569
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,200
and it'll be a lot easier
when a job comes in.


570
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,280
Hopefully, I'll get it
done a lot quicker.
That's job done for the brakes.


571
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,520
While McLaren have been
adapting their F1 technology
for many things,


572
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,640
it's different for the engine.


573
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,200
The car's 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8
is the first engine


574
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,120
the company has ever
designed themselves.


575
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,600
A V8 is basically
two four-stroke engines


576
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,440
bolted together with
a single crank.


577
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,920
A four stroke-engine works by
allowing air and fuel


578
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,040
to mix in the cylinder.


579
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,080
At the first stroke,
a vacuum is created.


580
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,920
At the second stroke,
all valves close,


581
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,920
allowing the pistons to compress
the air and fuel mixture


582
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,480
ready for detonation by
the spark plug.


583
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,040
The explosion forces the piston
down,


584
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,280
transferring its energy
to the crankshaft,


585
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,360
which, in turn, powers the flywheel,
the gears and the wheels.


586
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,760
The last upward movement
of the piston


587
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,480
forces open the exhaust valve,
releasing used gases.


588
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:20,960
The pistons are just one of the
1,100 hand-made parts in the engine.


589
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,160
And they're made at a specialist
factory in Basingstoke.


590
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,400
It's the job of Shaun Ward to turn
these blocks of aluminium,


591
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,000
called "billets", into pistons.


592
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,760
I've only been in engineering


593
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,640
ten-and-a-half years.


594
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,240
Before that, I spent nine years
as a lorry driver,


595
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,280
and before that,
I was 12 years serving King...


596
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,320
Queen and country, I should say!


597
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,360
Not King and country!
I'm not that old.


598
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,000
The lube we use
is a graphite-based lube,


599
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,320
sprayed on with a carrier,
which is GTX.


600
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,760
The billet is first heated
to 460 degrees C, or gas mark 21,


601
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,280
to make the alloy malleable enough
for Shaun to forge.


602
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,120
And the lube we use to paint on
the brush is also graphite based,


603
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,040
and it just stops everything
from sticking onto the tool.


604
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:21,480
The hydraulic forge press has
squeezed up with the equivalent
weight of 88 elephants


605
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,920
onto the pre-heated
aluminium billet,


606
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,880
creating the basic shape
of the underside of the piston.


607
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,760
Quick visual check - yep,
everything's OK.


608
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,840
It's like baking a cake, this job.


609
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,480
You've got to get
the temperatures right,
the ingredients right,


610
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,000
otherwise you don't get no cake!


611
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,720
In here, we have enough pistons
for 29 engines,


612
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,280
with a few left over.


613
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,080
So, this week, I've produced
enough pistons for 60 cars.


614
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,720
I don't normally look at it
in that perspective,
so I'm quite chuffed with that.


615
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,040
But when production ramps up
in the new building,


616
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,160
Shaun will need to build nearly
double the amount of pistons.


617
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Basically, this is what
we call the 600 oven.


618
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,920
It's the main
heat-treat quench oven.


619
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,680
When I can get it through the gate!


620
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,960
It's a bit of a tight squeeze,
and they're quite heavy.


621
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,480
To optimise the piston's basic
metallic structure,


622
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,520
the forgings are cooked again,
at 485 degrees C for ten hours.


623
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,720
The parts are then
dropped into a secret solution.


624
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,120
This type of alloy
increases in strength as it cools.


625
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,920
Then they're cleaned
through an acid line,


626
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,480
removing the graphite lubricant that
was used in the forging process.


627
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,800
It can burn you, so it's best to
wear your apron, long gloves
and the visor.


628
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,080
They're placed in acid for
four minutes and then washed off


629
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,480
before they go into another
special solution.


630
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,200
In here, we have tiger juice.
Put it this way -


631
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,000
if I was to put some on
the concrete,


632
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,600
we'd see bubbling,
and it would disappear down towards
the centre of the Earth.


633
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:18,040
It is like washing up,
but don't tell the wife,


634
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,600
otherwise she'll have me
doing it home as well.


635
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,400
As you can see - before acid,
after acid.


636
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:31,160
Now we come to the fun bit -
pushing this into the ageing oven.


637
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,520
Something you have to
put your back into.


638
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,760
Close the door,
check the temperature...


639
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,320
185 - job done.


640
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:54,320
At full speed, each piston travels
up and down 140 times a second,


641
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,840
so precision engineering
is essential.


642
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,800
The piston goes through
a process of further ageing,


643
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,800
milling and machining
before being put together.


644
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,240
So this is where we actually put
the piston together,
with the piston rings,


645
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,360
gudgeon pin,
and all the pins that go with it.


646
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,960
And this is ready just to be
packed up in the packaging


647
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,600
and sent to
the engine-builder.


648
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,960
So, we have a full set of engine
pistons and a set of engine liners.


649
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,800
The engine liner goes in the block,
the piston gets connected


650
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,760
and then assembled together,


651
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,080
and that, basically,
is what you've got
at the heart of a supercar.


652
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,680
Then you turn the key - 170mph,
and away you go.


653
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,160
Just up the road at a specialist
engine manufacturer,


654
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,320
the rest of the parts are assembled,
with the pistons taking their place
in the engine head.


655
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,080
But this company doesn't just
build the engine.


656
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,680
They also create what it will
actually sound like.


657
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,280
My name's Matt Maunder.


658
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,640
My job is to make cars go
"vroom-vroom" as nicely as possible.


659
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,200
That's my job.


660
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,000
You might think
the sound of the engine


661
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,680
is a by-product of the moving
mechanical parts, but it's
been designed by an engineer.


662
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,840
If you've paid extra money for
a sports car,


663
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,240
you really want something that's
going to make the hairs on
the back of your neck stand up.


664
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,520
A bit more vroom-vroom.


665
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,600
And when it comes to how a car
should sound, this man is obsessed!


666
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,000
This is the Ricardo car park.
We'll have a look round,
see what cars we can see.


667
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,360
That's a Japanese car.
That's probably pretty quiet.


668
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,160
The BMW - that will be tuned up for
the American market.
A bit more rumbly.


669
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,800
That's a Lotus Esprit, isn't it?
I think they have a turbo engine


670
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,320
and are pretty much a high-speed,
European-style screamer.


671
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,040
They're all four-cylinder cars,
and they're all a bit dull.


672
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,920
British people definitely like
a bit more exhaust sound


673
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,240
coming out of their car.


674
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,320
It's a throwback to the
motor-racing history
that we've got in this country.


675
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,280
Yeah, Americans tend to like more of
a burbly V8 sound.


676
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,120
Italian cars tend to be a bit
kind of shiny, pointy shoes,


677
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,600
and a bit girly sometimes,


678
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,280
but they kind of squeal
beautifully, Italian cars do.


679
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,840
Japanese don't seem to care
about the sound of their cars


680
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,960
so they're quite happy
to have something that's just quiet
and innocuous.


681
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,280
There's a Honda there.
Maybe they are too polite to have
a raunchy car sound.


682
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,760
CAR ROARS


683
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,440
We did a study that showed that
sound made up basically


684
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,960
half of the feeling of sportiness,
so part of it


685
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,720
is the feeling of acceleration,
being pushed back into the chair,


686
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,080
but the other part is the aural
onslaught you get from the engine.


687
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,320
McLaren's brief was concise.


688
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,720
They wanted it to sound really
extreme as a sports car, in fact,


689
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,880
so first part of the work we did was
to find out what that meant,


690
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,880
so we've got here
the most boring sounds...


691
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,400
CAR REVS SOFTLY


692
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,840
So, McLaren thought this was dull
normal and weak.


693
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,520
No character. Like a Kylie Minogue
pop tune, you know?


694
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,520
And then this one is
the kind of Kanye West -


695
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:41,680
very well produced, smooth, precise,
pleasant. I quite like that one.


696
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,080
Whereas this one is
a bit more extreme, you know?


697
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,240
A bit more rough round the edges.
A bit of a Dizzee Rascal, that one.


698
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,960
ENGINE ROARS


699
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,600
Welcome to the least echo-y room
in the world.


700
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,560
Basically, these wedges are made
out of absorbent foam,


701
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,600
and they actually the absorb sound.
Because of the shape of the wedges,


702
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,080
as the sound comes in, it bounces
further into the cracks,


703
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,800
so it also hits a foam multiple
times and never comes out again.
That's the idea.


704
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,200
Which is the same effect
as you would get if you were
in an open field,


705
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,600
where sound travels away and there's
nothing to reflect it back.
That's why it sounds a bit strange.


706
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,920
So this is our workhorse car,
which we've been using for the
development of the sound of the car.


707
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,680
The business end
is at the back, of course.


708
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,200
The 12C has a relatively small
3.8 litre engine.


709
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,000
To get the power associated
with a supercar,


710
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,640
engineers have bolted on
twin turbo-chargers,


711
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,840
which force more air
into the cylinders,


712
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,960
creating an even higher
combustion level.


713
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,680
The turbo-charger cuts down
a lot of the sound that comes
out of the exhaust pipes,


714
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,320
which isn't good for a sports car.
We want to have as much noise
as we can coming out of there,


715
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,240
and a tuned to a nice sound.
So, one of the key things we've had
to do on this car


716
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,800
is to tune the exhaust system
to match up with the turbo-chargers,


717
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,040
so we can get the right sound
out of the car.


718
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,320
The engine is like the breathing
and spitting heart of the car,


719
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,600
then it's got two saxophones
on the back of it,


720
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:12,560
and by tuning the exhaust system to
get the right kind of mixing
between the different cylinders,


721
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,000
that gives us the Metallica sound
that we were looking for earlier on.


722
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,160
ENGINE STARTS


723
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,600
ENGINE REVS POWERFULLY


724
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,440
So that has got a bit of oomph
to it, hasn't it?
I really like that.


725
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,440
ENGINE ROARS


726
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,920
I can really say I did that,
I made that car sound like this,


727
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,840
and that does make me
feel quite proud.


728
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,200
BEEPING


729
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,400
BOTH ENGINES REV


730
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,600
How do you feel the sound is?
I like it. Yeah? It's sports mode.
Really? I can't hear it.


731
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,400
If you put it in track, it's good.
Oh, he's going. See you.


732
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,120
Give it some, so I can hear what it
sounds like from here.


733
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,200
ENGINE ROARS


734
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:17,000
OK. We're on the runway.
Slippery as hell. 4,000rpm now.
Now I'm dumped.


735
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,080
Professional racing drivers
might have pushed the new car
to its limit,


736
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,720
but most customers won't be
driving it on a race track.


737
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:47,400
It's a road car, so how it handles
on different surfaces all
round the world is a top priority.


738
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,680
We use these secret proving grounds
for two reasons.


739
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,320
One is confidentiality,


740
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,480
so we can develop our product to a
level where we're happy to sell it,


741
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,120
so, if we're going to make
any mistakes,


742
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,000
we want to make them
in relative secrecy.


743
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,600
The second reason we come to
proving grounds


744
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,720
is that you can do
what you want with the car


745
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,640
in terms of speeds and how fast
you go round corners,


746
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,280
and, obviously,
you can't do that on a public road.


747
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,200
This kind of testing allows them
to find and fix faults
before customers do,


748
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,040
and they use specially-built roads
to do it.


749
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,360
So, this surface is a specifically
designed badly-maintained road.


750
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,480
It will expose any squeaks
and rattles.


751
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,440
We're now going onto
the Belgium pave surfaces,


752
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,760
so these generally give shorter
wavelength inputs into the car


753
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,840
and expose any secondary ride issues
that it might have,


754
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,000
or if anything is going to
drop off the car, it would be here.


755
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,360
It does rattle you around a little
bit, driving over these things.


756
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,120
These are the washboard surfaces,
which are...


757
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,160
JUDDERING


758
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:00,440
..quite harsh, and not dissimilar to
cat's eyes on a motorway,
but more severe.


759
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,720
It's quite difficult with
a sports car that needs to be


760
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,080
stiff in the corners to also be
compliant on the bumps.


761
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,280
The new car has some very clever
engineering, which should


762
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,480
allow it to cope with most
road conditions.


763
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,520
At each corner of it,
there are independent spring
and hydraulic dampers.


764
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,120
Fluid-filled chambers
are linked to each other.


765
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,800
As high pressure meets
high pressure under roll,
the chassis stiffens.


766
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,440
But to have a more comfortable ride
on a badly-maintained road,


767
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:36,560
hydraulic lines connect the front
and back, allowing each wheel
to operate independently.


768
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,280
The car has got a number of discrete
suspension settings,


769
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,240
which allow it to become
moderately firm on rough surfaces,


770
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,560
but at the flick of a switch,
you can turn it into something
that's also very responsive


771
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,040
on race-track environments,


772
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,120
so Jekyll and Hyde, I think,
is probably the best
description you can give.


773
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,320
The team work with
a fleet of over 50 prototypes,


774
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,080
and one of the oldest is maintained
by engineers like Richard Yeo.


775
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,960
It's a workhorse, basically,
so it's just kept running,


776
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,480
patched up


777
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,560
and does its job.


778
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,480
Temperatures coming out
of the exhausts are approximately
800 degrees,


779
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,640
so we've seen problems
with the bumpers melting before,


780
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,400
so it's just a way of bypassing that
and just carrying on.


781
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,840
When the team discover problems like
melting bumpers,


782
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,080
tweaks and adjustments can be fed
back to base to fix them.


783
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,720
This car does look proper Mad Max,


784
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,360
but I can assure you,
all of the equipment in the car
is top notch,


785
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,000
and it's the highest spec
you can get.


786
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,920
As you can see, it's quite different
to a production car
that you would see on the line.


787
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,040
We run quite a lot of
data-logging - two screens here -


788
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,040
so the driver can see everything
that's going on in the engine,


789
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,360
and also all these switches here


790
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,360
are bespoke to nearly all
the test cars.


791
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,320
So you have here fire extinguisher,
armed, engine kill,


792
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,440
battery kill,
and this will be for just


793
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,080
recording their laps
during the durability cycle,


794
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:21,520
and on the rear shelf is where the
data-logging computer normally sits.


795
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:27,200
Having worked on this project for
nearly five years, Richard has
become attached to this prototype.


796
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,920
Yes, my baby!


797
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,920
I've worked with it
for a long time now.
What will happen to it, eventually?


798
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:41,040
It's going to get crushed.
It will die eventually, this car,
although it keeps refusing to.


799
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,760
The first time
I went on this curve,
I thought was going to crash.


800
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,400
To expose any weakness from
high-mileage wear and tear,


801
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,880
the team put the car
through the kind of stresses


802
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,680
it would accumulate over
several years.


803
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,320
We're doing maintenance checks
before we hand it over


804
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,120
to the night-time driver.


805
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,040
We do sometimes work 24 hours
if the job needs to be done.


806
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,720
We can't hold up production,
so it's imperative we keep going.


807
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,080
Hopefully, I'll get home
before my girlfriend goes to sleep!


808
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,800
The testing programme is not
a nine-to-five job.


809
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,840
Continuously on the road,
24 hours a day, 7 days a week,


810
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,960
the car can accumulate
more than 50,000km a month.


811
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,480
Tonight, it's the job of Rob to do
the first three-hour night shift.


812
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,720
If we ran just during the day,
we'd get half the amount done.


813
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,480
And in such a short period of time,


814
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,760
we've managed to gain
a lot of information.


815
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,360
I suppose a lot of us are just a bit
frustrated Formula One drivers.


816
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:10,200
Didn't get that opportunity,
so, er...we'll keep on
pushing and pretending.


817
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:16,160
Tests like this are the only way
McLaren can know how the car
will last during its lifetime.


818
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,880
Back at the assembly line,


819
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,360
the new cars are about to have
their engines fitted.


820
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,160
To save on weight and space,
the engine and all its ancillaries


821
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,920
have been packed extremely tight.


822
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,400
The assembly engineers
must take utmost care
when bringing the car down -


823
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,440
guiding everything into place
and making sure nothing clashes.


824
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,040
Bolts are put in
underneath the frame


825
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,240
and the engine is fixed in place.


826
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,720
On other stations, the interiors,
final body panels


827
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,320
and wheels are also fitted.


828
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,720
Currently, around ten cars
are rolling off the production line
every week.


829
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,480
But Operations Director Alan Foster
will need to quadruple this output


830
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,720
to meet the initial demands
for delivery, and is looking forward


831
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,280
to moving into the new McLaren
Production Centre -


832
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,400
or MPC for short.


833
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,720
It's getting very busy.


834
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,600
We're only about two weeks away
from the planned move now to MPC


835
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,560
and, frankly, we need to
get into the new building
very, very quickly now.


836
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,640
My goodness! Everywhere you see,
there are car parts.


837
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,360
I think you could call that a pretty
congested end-of-paint facility.


838
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,280
Obviously, we're limited
for space here -
we've only got five spray booths,


839
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,960
therefore we can't get as much
output as we would like,


840
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,280
so the new facility should
speed things up a great deal.


841
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,480
It's like a car park at the moment.


842
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,240
McLaren need to start selling
these cars as soon as possible,


843
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,120
in order to recoup their
multi-million pound investment.


844
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,280
Bottom line is, we need to move cars


845
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,920
so I want the transition from
this pre-production facility


846
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,280
into the production facility
as smooth as possible.


847
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,920
Despite the mounting pressure,


848
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,440
the company remains
a stickler for detail


849
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,280
and continues with
its drive for perfection.


850
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,720
The castors have arrived
and the suppliers changed the colour
of the rubber


851
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,520
and that's not acceptable.
It's not the colour that I ordered.


852
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,520
So, it's going back
and they're going to change them.


853
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,440
That times 400 throughout the build
facility would just look too dark


854
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,960
against the background that
we've developed within MPC.


855
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,680
The colour it should be
matches the cabinet


856
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,440
and the walls in this room.


857
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,240
As you can see, a couple of shades
too dark.


858
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,880
With the new castors in the post,
it's now just weeks


859
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,960
before McLaren need to start
delivering cars to customers.


860
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,080
And today is the day
of the big move.


861
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,760
My plan is we will take them
over in groups of 20,


862
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,120
so that we can give them
an induction.


863
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,840
Kind of show them
station locations, et cetera.


864
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:04,120
Cars will be going after lunch
from here.


865
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,120
By the end of play today,
I expect all of my team


866
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,280
to be out of their lockers and go
to work in there tomorrow morning.


867
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,360
OK. Thank you very much, guys.


868
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,080
It's taken 14 months to build,


869
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,560
and Alan realises the hard part
still lies ahead.


870
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:25,600
It is quite a massive move. To think
you're going to move a whole factory
in less than eight hours is...


871
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,320
Is quite insane, really.


872
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,520
Body assembly and the paint teams
are the first to move in,


873
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,560
and Executive Chairman Ron Dennis
is on one his frequent inspections.


874
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,160
What we have here is our, er,


875
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:50,680
assembly hall for the 12C,
rapidly nearing completion.


876
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,680
This side of the factory is
dedicated to the assembly


877
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,240
of the mono-cell
and crash structures.
And then into the paint facilities.


878
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,280
In the old building,
five booths painting body parts


879
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,840
meant around three cars
a day could be finished.


880
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:08,160
But in the new facility,
this can be increased tenfold.


881
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:14,320
The whole objective of having the
level of detail that we strive for


882
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,920
is to get the perfection
in the finished product.


883
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,920
It's sort of like a second home
to me. I have a sense of order


884
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,400
and attention to detail -


885
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,520
a desire to do things really well.


886
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,680
And, er, time will tell
whether the approach we've taken


887
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,880
to producing this very unique car
has worked or not.


888
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,800
If all goes according to plan,
then this new facility will enable


889
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,720
the company to add 300 new jobs
to its workforce


890
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,600
and produce 80 cars a week


891
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:51,000
to help them meet the orders
they already have, and the targets
for future sales.


892
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,440
But now it's time to unveil
the new car


893
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,840
at the new dealership
in London's Knightsbridge.


894
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,600
In the end, I think it's all about
selling cars to real people


895
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,480
and this is where it starts.


896
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,120
I think it looks fantastic.
Looks absolutely amazing.


897
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,920
It's a big night.
We've been looking forward to this
for a long, long time.


898
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,680
Personally, it's like going to
the hospital


899
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,160
to see your baby finally being born
and brought out into the daylight.


900
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,520
I like the way how the doors open as
well. It's really cool.


901
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,280
Keep smiling.


902
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:34,080
When the doors open for business,
the first customer that comes
through the door will be told,


903
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,760
"We're very sorry, it's
a two-and-a-half-year waiting list,"


904
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,600
which in this world, in this market,
is a great thing to hear.


905
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,720
I've ordered three, obviously.


906
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,320
This is the point we've all been
working for for the past four or
five years.


907
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:51,400
So, very, very, very excited.
Difficult to put into words.


908
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,600
The phrase that comes to mind is,
"I'm clearly in on this one."


909
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,680
That's when you know you've
got it right -


910
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,560
when everyone looks at it and says,
"I wish I could have something
like that."


911
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,960
There may be glitz and glamour at
the launch but for the engineers,


912
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,640
there's an
important message to be understood.


913
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,760
People say manufacturing is dying
a death in this country,
but anything but.


914
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,240
Manufacturing's getting busier
and busier.


915
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,280
We're a nation of inventors.


916
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,480
We've had a long history of being
the best at what we do.


917
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,280
Basically, I'm just trying
to carry it on.


918
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,080
There comes a point where we need to
share it and take it.


919
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,480
Whatever comes -
be it critical or praise -


920
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,200
it will go to the market.


921
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,240
The first car was delivered.
That is the first car.


922
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,920
The dealers will receive all of
their cars by the end of the month.


923
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,240
We will ramp production
to 4,000 a year


924
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,560
over the course of
the next four years.


925
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,560
We are going to be criticised,
but I can tell you
we are going to succeed.


926
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,640
Thank you very much.


927
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,440
With the creation of their new car
and the facility it's built in,


928
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,400
McLaren know the stakes are high.


929
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,680
The place is so big, it's amazing.


930
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,120
I can't believe how clean and white
and sparkling, brand new,
everything is.


931
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,240
I said to one of the guys today,
"If you went down the hospital
with your arm cut off,


932
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,000
"you'd rather be here having it
tended to than there."


933
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
ENGINE PURRS
I made that car sound like this.


934
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,160
And that does make you feel
quite proud.


935
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,240
ENGINE REVS


936
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,680
They'll see it driving down the road
and everyone's going to be like,


937
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,840
"Yeah, my friend Terry
fitted that car."


938
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,120
We've made cars in Britain
for decades


939
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,840
and although some argue
we have passed our heyday,


940
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:35,080
taken as a whole, the automotive
industry still accounts for around
10% of all UK exports


941
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,880
in a highly-competitive
international market.


942
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,560
You can feel
the passion in this place.


943
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,360
There's people that have been here
a long time


944
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,160
and we're not just here
for the money.


945
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,600
McLaren's new car
may be the latest,


946
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,960
but it certainly won't be the last.


947
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,400
In the next programme,


948
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,040
we meet the engineers in one of
Britain's most hi-tech industries,


949
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,960
and discover how to build
a satellite.


950
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,840
From sketch to structure, see how
designs come to life by visiting...


951
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,200
..and follow the links
to the Open University.
