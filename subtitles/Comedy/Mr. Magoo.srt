0
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,790
Oh, Magoo, you've done it again.

1
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,956
Another day in the can.

2
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,349
Good night, Mrs Wonderbottom.

3
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,789
Ugliest hairdo l've ever seen.

4
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,717
Hold the elevator!
Aha!

5
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,637
Express elevator.

6
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,557
Elevator with a view!

7
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,152
Now that's what l call
an express.

8
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,877
Good Godfrey! Earthquake!

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,956
Don't panic, everyone.

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,311
We've got enough canned food here
to cover any emergency.

11
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,919
That's better.

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,396
Carry on, boys.

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,073
Parking lot. Mm-hmm.

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,959
Whoopsie.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,958
By George, somebody fix the lights...

16
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,230
before anyone trips.

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,109
The escalator to the parking lot.

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,117
Such sophistication!

19
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,350
- Good night, Henry.
- Good night.

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,470
Right turn only.

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,236
Road hog!

22
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,595
Blasted potholes!

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,476
The checkered flag?

24
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,990
Magoo, you, you speed demon, you!

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,793
You've still got it.

26
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,033
El Nino's back.

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,072
Oh, Magoo, you've done it again.

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,272
And tonight, Quincy Magoo,
the canned vegetable king...

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,949
will dedicate the new museum wing
he has donated to the city.

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,958
The Magoo Rotunda will house
a travelling exhibit...

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,877
of the treasures of Kuristan...

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,834
including the rarest of all rubies,
the Star of Kuristan.

33
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,078
Treat her gently, young fella.

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,760
Check underneath. l think
there's something rattling there.

35
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,235
Yes, you dropped the keys, my boy.

36
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,716
lt's the most precious ruby
in the world.

37
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,150
- Lovely.
- lt's just gorgeous.

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,077
- lt's exquisite.
- Exquisite.

39
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,517
No. Actually it's corundum.

40
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,154
That's an aluminum oxide.

41
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,158
Okay, don't take my word for it.

42
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,635
Exquisite is an adjective,
not an element.

43
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,637
All right. lf you're so smart,
how come Mr Cloquet told me...

44
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,354
to watch you like a hawk?

45
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,277
Cloquet said that?

46
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,996
Why is it that someone always seems
to burn the rumaki?

47
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,356
Maybe you should see
another eye doctor.

48
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,076
Waldo, Hiram has been my optometrist
since l was a small boy in knee pants.

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,873
He's like 2,000 years old.
All his other patients are dead.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,797
You can't hold that against him.

51
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,717
But he's still making appointments
with them.

52
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,637
Trust me, you need a second opinion.

53
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,879
Oh, my gosh!

54
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,431
- Would you, would you look at that!
- What?

55
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,357
Wait, don't look. Don't look.

56
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,438
- What?
- She's coming this way.

57
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,913
Mr Magoo?

58
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,311
l am Stacey Sampanahoditra
of the Kuristani foreign office.

59
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,954
Oh. This is my nephew Waldo.

60
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,594
Waldo Magoo. lt is an honour.

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,633
Oh.

62
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,194
Uh, you'll have to forgive him
sometimes.

63
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,880
He gets like that, lost in thought.
Quite a scholar, you know.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,797
Graduated with a large class.

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,673
lsn't that right, Waldo?
Waldo?

66
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,075
Waldo!

67
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,512
Yeah. l-l, l w-went there to college.

68
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,108
Oh.

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,189
Uh, Waldo, why don't you invite,
uh, Stacey to our opera tomorrow night?

70
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,311
l would be most honoured, sir.

71
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,237
Stacey...

72
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,715
will you join us
for the opera tomorrow night?

73
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,477
lt's a, uh, benefit performance.

74
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,797
Uh, we're doing excerpts
from the Norsemen saga.

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,480
l look forward to it.
Please excuse me.

76
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,955
l must greet diplomats.

77
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,799
That's a very attractive young lady.

78
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,718
But l'm, l'm such a fool.
l-l tried to offer her a snack.

79
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,992
Oh, Waldo, don't be so hard on yourself.
Cupid makes fools of us all.

80
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,277
And now, as curator of this museum...

81
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,597
it is my pleasure
to present our benefactor...

82
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,917
a man of great vision,
Quincy Magoo.

83
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,279
- Step right this way, sir.
- Ah, well, thank you, thank you.

84
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,757
Ah, well, may, uh, may all
of the exhibits in this hall...

85
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,474
chime with the light
of human knowledge.

86
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,197
My dear, thank you.
Thank you.

87
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,117
Hey!

88
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,674
Look out! Watch out!

89
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,432
Oh, yes.

90
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,113
Great Scott!

91
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,389
What is this, indoor fireworks?

92
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,114
What a wonderful touch.

93
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,519
Excuse me.

94
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,471
Or a blackout.

95
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,636
l should inform the power company here.

96
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,150
Get that fixed,
and get these lights back on.

97
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,913
Hello down here.
Public telephone.

98
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,669
Oh, what-- Excuse me, sir.
We have an emergency--

99
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,791
Great Scott!

100
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,515
We have an injured man here.
Bandaged from head to foot.

101
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,756
Help. Some assistance, please.

102
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,791
And whoever did it
has stolen the telepho--

103
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,512
God! They gave me a bad mask.

104
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,470
Okay. Go.

105
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,794
l gotta watch her like a hawk.

106
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,356
Morgan!

107
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,835
You just, uh, you just hang on.
l'll get you some medical attention.

108
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,713
You stay right here.
No, you're in no condition--

109
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,956
Oh, well.
How many times must l tell you?

110
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,877
Stay back in the booth, man.

111
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,276
l'll take care of him.

112
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,756
l'll be back. l'll get some help
or maybe find a telephone.

113
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,236
Freeze! Drop the gun.

114
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,519
Turn around.

115
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,995
Yes, sure.
Must be a phone out there somewhere.

116
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,753
Well, if you can't bring Mohammed
to the mountain--

117
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,479
Morning, Angus.

118
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,150
Avast, Angus.
Are you ready to cast off?

119
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,236
Waldo? What are you doing here?

120
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,157
Oh, just cleaning your windshield.

121
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,149
Aha, my boy, you are a prince,
but l have a date with a flounder.

122
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,715
- Anchors aweigh.
- Anchors aweigh.

123
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,955
Oh, the windshield did need cleaning,
huh? Right, Angus?

124
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,676
l don't think l've seen it
this clear since 1956.

125
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,111
Well, now that you're here,
we'd better inform the police.

126
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,037
Orders, U.S. State Department.

127
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,674
This incident is to remain
completely under wraps.

128
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,237
Which includes the crazy 9-1-1 call
about a bandaged man in the museum.

129
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,157
We substitute a replica
of the jewel and--

130
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,396
And we open the exhibit
as if nothing has happened.

131
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,308
Hold it. Who the hell are you?
And who told the State Department?

132
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,399
l did. They said they would send two
of their very best operatives.

133
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,273
Gustave Anders, ClA.

134
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,516
l'm in charge
of this investigation.

135
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,191
Chuck Stupak, FBl, and
l'm in charge of this investigation.

136
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,232
The ClA has no jurisdiction
on American soil.

137
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,669
This could very well become
an international incident.

138
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,837
Not if you don't get in my way,
fancy pants.

139
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,190
Hmm?

140
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,797
Oh.

141
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,711
l don't get it.
There's nothing in the papers.

142
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,717
lt's a trap.

143
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,274
They're trying to lull us
into a false sense of security...

144
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,198
and then bust us
when we make a careless move.

145
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,390
We'll never make it to Cloquet's.
They're onto us, Luanne.

146
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,149
- l can feel it in my--
- Morgan, that's yesterday's paper.

147
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,471
Oh.

148
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,075
Nothing like the old sea air
to clean out the pipes.

149
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,112
Huh? Right, Angus?

150
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,438
The sun is a little hot.
Time to apply the old Ban de Soleil.

151
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,192
There we go.

152
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,518
Oh. A very refreshing,
minty fragrance.

153
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,996
Ah, the French.
They think of everything.

154
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,799
What's that? The old fog
rolling in, thick as pea soup?

155
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,995
Not my pea soup, mind you,
but maybe one of those other brands.

156
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,830
Bob, why steal the Star for your boss,
Cloquet, and get peanuts for it...

157
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,235
when he can turn around
and auction it off for millions?

158
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,874
Why not auction it off ourselves?

159
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,231
That way we get millions
and each other.

160
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,273
Me and you?

161
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,119
l could take you to places
you've never been before.

162
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,879
l've never been to Toronto.

163
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,878
l know a little cosy
bed-and-breakfast place in Toronto...

164
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,389
but we could skip the breakfast part.

165
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,997
Come on, Angus. We won't let
a little fog stop us, huh?

166
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,028
You rotten seagulls!

167
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,720
You con-sarned buzzards, you!

168
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,549
Uncivilized behaviour.
l'd never do anything like that to you.

169
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,636
l'm gonna have to get this
dry-cleaned now.

170
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,718
Blast your--

171
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,153
Ho-ho-ho. l've got a strike.

172
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,431
Well, shiver my timbers!
lt's a lunker!

173
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,035
Just call me lshmael.

174
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,876
lt's Moby Dick!

175
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,357
Why, look at that-- Look at--

176
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,994
Look at that, Angus.
lt's huge.

177
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,156
He was a big one, Angus.

178
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,593
Just look at the size
of those, uh, uh, pants.

179
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,274
Well, l'd say we were in
the Bermuda Triangle...

180
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,391
but we're nowhere near Bermuda.

181
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,590
l'll just play it safe
and head for shore.

182
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,108
Well, Angus, here we are in safe harbour
once again.

183
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,390
Well, an escalator to the top.

184
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,192
How swank.

185
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,039
Must be a yacht club.

186
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,837
Angus?

187
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,189
Angus, where are you, boy?

188
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,876
Well, hello, Angus.
Come on there, fella.

189
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,869
We believe Magoo created a diversion
while his accomplices stole the jewel.

190
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,356
But why? Mr Magoo
is a very wealthy man.

191
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,677
Are you sure about that? People do eat
a lot more fresh food these days.

192
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,190
Okay, we don't collar Magoo.
We put him under surveillance.

193
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,233
But this is absurdity. l'm to be
his guest at the opera tonight.

194
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,955
Great! You can be our inside person.

195
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,958
That is, if it's all right
with the FBl.

196
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,634
So, Magoo has the Star of Kuristan.

197
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,955
But it was Luanne's fault!

198
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,833
She double-crossed us.

199
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,472
l shouldn't have hired her.

200
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,478
But she's the only one capable
of stealing the Star.

201
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,272
How could someone with such beauty...

202
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,709
be so treacherous?

203
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,119
l worship all that is beautiful,
Morgan.

204
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,073
The greatest sin is to destroy
a thing of beauty.

205
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,673
l fear now we must destroy
the beautiful Miss Le Seur.

206
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,237
Kill her.

207
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,828
But first, get the stone, all right?

208
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,396
Tomorrow buyers are arriving from
all over the world to bid on the ruby.

209
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,956
Schmidt. Gosher. Havzinski.

210
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,868
l hear there's a rumour
Ortega Peru might even show.

211
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,310
The Piranha?
The king of the underworld?

212
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,115
Oh, Morgan,
don't screw this up, hmm?

213
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,635
l'm coming. On my way!

214
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,436
- Hello, sir.
- Um, oh, Stacey!

215
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,279
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?

216
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,710
l thought that Waldo was going to pick
you up, uh, on the way to the opera.

217
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,116
Well, in my country, the invitee
always picks up the inviter.

218
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,913
l'm sure that Waldo
would not have it any other way.

219
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,679
Unc, l need to borrow a tie.

220
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,234
- Oh, hi, Stacey.
- Hello, Waldo.

221
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,115
Uh, why don't you, uh, show Stacey
the garden before you leave?

222
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,515
lt's quiet and, uh, and peaceful...

223
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,835
and, uh, intimate.

224
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,633
l, l, l don't think
she'd want to see the--

225
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,354
l'd love to see more
of your charming home.

226
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,278
All right. lt's, uh--
lt's right back here.

227
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,710
The smell of rice is in the air.

228
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,718
Love in bloom,
if ever l've seen it before.

229
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,595
Angus? Come on, now.
How many times...

230
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,188
have l told you
to stay out of that closet?

231
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,029
Come on in here, boy.
Help me with my scales.

232
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,515
lt's my uncle's work.

233
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,437
Oh.

234
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,518
Never have l seen
such a plant sculpture.

235
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,791
Topiary's kind of a hobby of his.

236
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,354
And he specializes in the abstract.

237
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,950
Oh, no.
That's a bunny rabbit.

238
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,359
Hey, well. What--
What is-- What is that?

239
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,393
Oh. So you want to play fetch again?
ls that it?

240
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,239
Ah, well, it's a dog's life.

241
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,193
Here we go.
There it goes.

242
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,037
Your uncle, do you think
he needs glasses?

243
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,118
Oh, and how!
Just don't try and tell him that.

244
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,358
He will not spend the money?
l notice he drives a very old car.

245
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,391
ls his business not healthy?

246
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,353
Oh, no. No.
He just loves that old car.

247
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,472
And if Unc loves something,
he won't let it go.

248
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,356
Angus! Stop terrorizing the squirrels.

249
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,232
- Stupak!
- Where are you?

250
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,999
Right behind you.
Don't turn around.

251
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,429
Just spotted a conspicuous white male.

252
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,869
Dirty clothes,
needs a haircut.

253
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,673
- Sticks out like a sore thumb.
- Where is he? Can't see him. Over.

254
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,109
Right behind you.
Turn around. Don't turn around.

255
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,470
- Walk backwards.
- What?

256
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,672
Walk backwards.

257
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,917
More! More.

258
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,679
More. Stop.

259
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,234
- Where?
- Look to your left.

260
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,272
l am Rolvaag

261
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,197
King of Norway

262
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,669
Aha. Uh, one minute, please.

263
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,070
Uh, uh, may l help you?

264
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,714
Oh, that voice.

265
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,149
The timbre! The tone!

266
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,114
lt belongs to the world,
but for the moment it's mine alone.

267
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,595
And l tremble.

268
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,631
Prunella.

269
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,436
- Mr Magoo, l presume?
- Uh, yes.

270
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,391
And, uh, you are, um--

271
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,717
Prunella. Prunella Pagliacci,
reporter for ''The Opera News.''

272
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,197
Prunella. l knew a young lady once
named Prunella.

273
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,709
Mr Magoo, w-will you consent
to an interview?

274
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,515
Well, why not? Uh, back here,
uh, tonight, after the show.

275
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,428
Oh. No, l, l wouldn't want to share you
with all of your well-wishers.

276
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,109
Oh, well, uh, uh, uh,
a private, uh, rendezvous.

277
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,471
Uh, a walk on the beach
at, uh, Sandy Cove...

278
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,239
uh, shall we say, noon tomorrow?

279
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,112
l'll be there early.

280
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,875
Be wonderful tonight.

281
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,956
Well, uh--

282
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,154
Great Scott!
Uh, did you hear that, Angus?

283
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,555
She doesn't want to share me
with anyone.

284
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,037
ls it possible after all these years,
another duet at last?

285
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,196
''O Solo Mio'' no more.

286
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,549
Stupak. Stupak!
Where are you?

287
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,114
l am Rolvaag
king of Norway

288
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,754
l am Rolvaag
king of Norway

289
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,189
- Break a leg, Mr Magoo.
- Ah, Rumford, yes.

290
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,117
Thank you, uh, Sam.

291
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,952
l am Rolvaag

292
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,072
King of Norway

293
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,756
Where am l?
Oh, backstage.

294
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,278
Let's go.

295
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,550
Stupak, where are you?

296
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,352
What's going on in there?

297
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,114
l am Rolvaag
king of Norway

298
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,356
Go out there a nobody,
come back a star.

299
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,277
Open the throat,
sing from the diaphragm.

300
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,392
And remember, always sit down
whenever you can.

301
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,317
That man's got a very big head.

302
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,437
Ah, stage, uh--
Stage, uh-- Stage left.

303
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,119
Time to warm up
for the old fight scene.

304
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,670
Get over there and shut off that fan!

305
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,711
Bravo!

306
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,710
l am a crusty
lusty Viking

307
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,637
That was the note that brought a lump
to the judges' throats.

308
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,877
After that, l knew
the Van Cliburn award was mine.

309
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,673
Well, the years have not dimmed
its beauty.

310
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,076
Oh, thank you.
Any, uh, more questions?

311
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,430
Uh, not that l want
this interview to end.

312
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,596
Oh, me, too. lt's just,
just been such a thrill...

313
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,314
to hear the story of your life in song,
Mr Magoo, l mean real--

314
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,318
Oh, please, please, please, dear.
Call me Quincy.

315
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,149
Quincy, l'm really happy
l got this chance to know you.

316
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,238
l'd like to get to know you better.

317
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,478
Ah, Prunella, could this be
a new beginning?

318
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,558
- Yes, of the end.
- Of the end?

319
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,638
Uh, the end of loneliness.

320
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,876
The beginning of discovery.

321
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,517
How nice.

322
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,914
- This is a very special day, Prunella.
- Oh, for me, too, Quincy.

323
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,476
Ah, then you know that this is
the opening of the carp fishing season?

324
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,113
- Of course!
- Oh, Great Scott!

325
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,710
And l'm so happy
we're experiencing it together.

326
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,152
As am l. Eh, together, yes.
l learned that the hard way.

327
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,273
When you have something precious,
you must keep it in sight all the time.

328
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,517
Something precious,
such as, say, a jewel?

329
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,154
Yes, indeed.
The most precious jewel of all.

330
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,475
What does this jewel look like?

331
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,388
My jewel is luminous, sparkling.
A flaming red--

332
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,512
- Ruby?
- Ruby, yes!

333
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,598
- Where do you keep this ruby?
- Close to my heart.

334
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,553
Oh, Quincy.

335
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,912
Oh, l'm sorry, Quincy,
but l, l want you to kiss me.

336
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,996
Oh, well, it's, uh--

337
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,829
No, b-but not here. Someplace.
Someplace private, like a, like a boat.

338
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,757
Do you happen to have a boat?

339
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,474
Well, in two words:
''Anchors aweigh.''

340
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,353
Prunella. Uh--

341
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,993
Well, my boat is just down here.

342
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,509
Oh.

343
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,360
Bingo!

344
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,315
Oh, no.
lt's Luanne Le Seur.

345
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,713
The Black Widow.

346
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,116
She kills all of her male accomplices.
No one has ever been able to finger her.

347
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,152
Wow. Whoever brings her in
will get a big promotion.

348
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,272
- Maybe a book deal.
- Hey, where're you going?

349
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,316
Nothing like the warm sea air.

350
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,317
Huh? Lo-- Look at that.

351
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,273
The, the fish are jumping and--

352
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,710
Look at that.
lsn't that wonderful?

353
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,794
- Dear me.
- Now, Quincy, there's an idea.

354
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,878
Why don't we do some fishing?
Where do you keep your tackle box?

355
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,197
Oh, my tackle box
is back at the house.

356
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,359
Ah, but this is wonderful.
The open sea, it's magnificent.

357
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,278
And so inspirational.
lsn't it wonderful?

358
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,597
Oh! Oh!

359
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,598
- What? What? What is it?
- l think l sprained my ankle.

360
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,711
Oh, l'll call the emergency sea rescue.

361
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,513
Oh, no, no, no, no. l-lt'll be okay.
l just need to rest it.

362
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,551
Oh, well, you, you come on up front now.
Be careful.

363
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,148
- Okay.
- We'll take care of you, and--

364
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,794
Just sit down, and l'll head
for the shore.

365
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,797
- Oh, could we go to your house?
- Ah!

366
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,232
Well, l'll put the wheel to the keel
and the gas to the mast!

367
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,399
l am a rusty
crusty Viking

368
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,750
l hope l'm to your liking

369
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,709
Well?

370
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,910
- How do l look?
- Wow!

371
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,270
Waldo, we mustn't.

372
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,269
Well, w-why not?
l-ls there someone else?

373
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,713
- lt's Mr Magoo.
- What?

374
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,995
Your government thinks Mr Magoo
stole the Star of Kuristan.

375
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,997
Well--

376
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,398
A-And you?
Do you think he did it?

377
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,597
Waldo, l need your help.

378
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,076
Hey, we don't have a warrant...

379
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,953
so be quick about it,
or we've both had it.

380
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,799
One, two, three.

381
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,276
- Testing. One, two, three.
- Got it, loud and clear.

382
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,833
Mayday! Mayday!
Magoo! He's back.

383
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,550
l'm a lusty
crusty Viking

384
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,989
l hope l'm to your liking

385
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,111
And l'm a Viking woman

386
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,356
A lusty, busty charmer

387
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,110
Please let me pierce your armour
And together we'll find love

388
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,471
- All right.
- Oh, no. Don't. Put me down.

389
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,397
- Here we go.
- My ankle's fine.

390
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,272
Here we go.

391
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,470
Ah. Well...

392
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,479
with a little more practise,
l, uh, could pop the question.

393
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,272
Quincy.

394
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,834
Oh, your house is beautiful.
Do you mind if l look around?

395
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,235
Look away. Look away.

396
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,433
l'll just put my hat
in the closet here, and--

397
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,271
May l make you a cocktail?

398
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,595
Ah, l'm famished. Do you think
you could cook us something?

399
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,517
Something hot?

400
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,437
Can l cook?

401
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,473
You may call me ''Cordon Bleu'' Magoo.

402
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,070
Uh, which way
to the little girls' room?

403
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,670
Ah, atop the stairs.
Let me light your way.

404
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,959
Ah, ah, your repast awaits you
down here, my dove.

405
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,193
Next l want you to put some water
on to boil.

406
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,788
And while we're waiting for that,
let's clean about, oh...

407
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,150
two or three sprigs of parsley.

408
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,314
Water on to boil.

409
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,316
Next, pat the chicken dry.

410
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,790
Now, take some lemon
and rub it on the chicken.

411
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,992
Now, make sure you get the whole
chicken. Lift the leg if you have to.

412
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,873
Now, l hope you're not cheating
and using bottled lemon juice.

413
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,639
lf you are,
it just won't taste as good.

414
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,399
Why? Well, no peel appeal.

415
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,511
Angus, there you are, old friend.

416
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,600
Well, l can't play right now.

417
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,711
l don't have any time.

418
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,719
And now, lift both legs
high into the air. Left and right.

419
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,516
All right, then. Just one last time,
then you take it upstairs.

420
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,676
All right.

421
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,951
Come on, don't be a slacker.
You can do it.

422
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,877
Lift those legs!

423
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,033
Left and right.
Back and forth.

424
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,754
One, and two, and three, and four.

425
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,634
Come on, you can do it.
Lift both legs high into the air.

426
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,117
Lift them left and right.
And left and right.

427
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,711
Come on, you can do it.
Lift those legs high into the air.

428
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,751
And dance!

429
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,190
Come on.
Get your rear into gear.

430
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,517
Now, don't stop
until you're ready to drop.

431
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,156
Now you're cookin'!

432
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,510
Go get some sandpaper,
and sand that sucker smooth.

433
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,915
You don't want any bumps
on the surface.

434
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,190
l recommend a medium grade paper
because...

435
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,357
if you use a sandpaper that's too fine,
you're gonna be at it all day.

436
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,040
Now, whatever you do,
do not use a metal file...

437
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,276
because that will shred the surface
to a pulp.

438
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,391
Must be a Chinese recipe
to make the chicken tender.

439
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,795
Either that, or it's German.

440
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,313
Use short, light strokes,
and watch out for surface abrasions.

441
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,954
Don't rush it.
These things take time.

442
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,317
Unc?

443
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,029
l want him.
Magoo is goin' down!

444
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,390
- You hear me?
- What?

445
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,829
Come on!

446
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,237
Now...

447
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,317
after you finish drilling,
you want to make sure that
you squirt some caulk into those holes.

448
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,795
Unc.

449
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,869
There's something very important
we need to talk about.

450
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,913
Waldo, Waldo. How did you know?
l thought this was my little secret.

451
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,553
Then it's true!

452
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,319
Yes, and a lot of people
are in for a big surprise.

453
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,113
- Have you gone insane?
- Yes! Yes, l--

454
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,677
- You have gone insane.
- lnsane. lnsane with passion.

455
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,792
Their names are even the same:
Prunella.

456
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,319
- Prunella?
- Prunella.

457
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,670
Oh, oh, oh, you're talk--
You're talking-- That's wonderful, Unc.

458
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,997
lt's time that you met
this glorious thief...

459
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,918
who has stolen my heart.

460
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,554
Uh, l'll be right back.
Prunella!

461
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,671
Prunella!

462
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,150
Oh, my gosh!
He did do it.

463
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,789
Aha! There you are,
my Viking princess.

464
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,990
Come. l want you to meet someone.

465
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,509
Not now.

466
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,394
l can't wait any longer, Quincy.
l'm gonna ask you once, and only once.

467
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,829
Ah, you're going to propose!

468
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,270
Oh, my precious bonbon.

469
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,960
You read my mind.

470
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,312
You know what l came here for.
You know what l want. Give it to me.

471
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,274
Ah, you modern women.
You're so direct.

472
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,198
Angus.

473
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,108
Now what is this? Oh, we've been
playing fetch all day with this.

474
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,310
All right, boy, go ahead.

475
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,076
Hold it!

476
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,879
Unc, who is this?

477
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,151
Uh, Waldo Magoo, this is, uh,
Prunella Pagliacci.

478
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,632
l'm FBl. That man just stole
the Star of Kuristan.

479
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,876
Stole? ln this house?

480
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,958
- He's heading for the driveway.
- Get up.

481
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,516
- He stole the Studebaker.
- What?

482
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,749
The eggplant mobile.

483
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,872
What? Watch your head.
This way.

484
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,270
Hold it! Stop or l'll shoot.

485
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,072
- Stop or l'll shoot!
- Don't worry. He's not gonna get away.

486
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,950
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

487
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,437
- Unc, there he is.
- Ah, yeah, all right.

488
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,994
- No, over there, over there.
- l see him. l see him.

489
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,157
- He's turning left.
- Left it is.

490
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,951
He's turning right.
Big truck! Big truck!

491
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,310
Hold on!

492
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,190
He's a crafty fella.
Taking evasive action. That won't work!

493
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,517
- You're not getting away.
- That's the wrong car.

494
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,313
He's back there.

495
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,635
Don't worry, my boy.
We'll catch him on the turnaround.

496
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,954
Hold on, Angus!

497
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,439
Hey, look out!

498
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,916
- Stop!
- Look out!
- Stop!

499
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,717
Don't panic, now.
We're only in some kind of tunnel.

500
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,551
Brakes! Brakes, Unc!

501
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,240
Unc, hit the brake!

502
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,150
Great Scott!
Those speed bumps. l tell ya.

503
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,077
l'll sue this city.

504
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,879
Uh, Prunella, uh, about the FBl.
You were saying?

505
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,549
Yeah, uh, uh, FBl.
l, l'm-- l'm an undercover agent...

506
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,875
for the government.

507
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,275
Does this mean no story
in ''The Opera News''?

508
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,356
l'm sorry l had to deceive you.

509
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,277
They think you stole
the Star of Kuristan.

510
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,549
That's what l've been trying
to tell you.

511
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,069
What? They, they what?

512
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,555
That burglar in your house was really
a notorious jewel thief...

513
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,955
who works for a man
named Austin Cloquet.

514
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,116
The bureau has learned that Cloquet
plans to sell the jewel...

515
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,310
tomorrow at a secret auction
up at a ski lodge.

516
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,000
Every billionaire gangster
in the world is coming...

517
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,795
except the most powerful of them all:
Ortega Peru, The Piranha.

518
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,673
No one's ever seen him.
He never goes anywhere.

519
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,597
So if we could get someone
to impersonate Peru...

520
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,711
we could get close to the gem
and recover it.

521
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,149
But who?

522
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,954
We lost him right here,
and Magoo didn't return home all night.

523
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,310
Why is he always
one step ahead of me?

524
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,079
Kenyawa Tambe just charged some tickets
to a ski resort.

525
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,031
Yeah, so what?

526
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,594
Kenyawa Tambe is one
of Luanne's aliases.

527
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,715
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- l just found out.

528
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,068
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

529
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,873
You know, we're supposed to be working
as a team here.

530
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,389
- You're going around behind my back.
- lf the pressure's too much for you--

531
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,398
- You'll take over! You'll take over!
- Sirs!

532
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,432
l shall go with you.

533
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,588
No. Young lady, this is strictly a job
for professionals.

534
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,676
Then why are the two of you going?

535
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,029
Welcome to the Rockies, gentlemen.

536
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,631
lf you'll follow me to the limo,
l'll take you to Austin Cloquet.

537
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,596
Who the hell are you?

538
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,158
Ortega Peru.
What's it to you?

539
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,748
Mr Peru never goes anywhere.

540
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,996
That's right.
l never go anywhere.

541
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,192
So when l go somewhere,
everyone thinks l am nowhere...

542
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,117
when l'm really there.

543
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,789
Now, let's put this show on the road.

544
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,798
Uh, sorry.
Mr Peru, uh, this way.

545
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,990
There are no signs.

546
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,514
So you've been staking out my uncle
all this time.

547
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,278
ls that right?

548
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,595
That's my job.

549
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,713
And the way you say you feel about him,
is, is that part of your job, too?

550
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,477
You all right, boy?

551
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,993
You saw this man?

552
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,795
Yeah. He just went up the mountain.
Said his name was Ortega Peru.

553
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,070
Magoo is Peru?

554
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,191
Magoo, The Piranha.

555
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,117
This is big.

556
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,037
We're gonna need some backup.

557
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,708
Don't you know how to open a door?

558
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,598
Gentlemen,
thank you all for coming.

559
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,599
We're especially honoured today
to have with us Mr Ortega Peru.

560
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,597
l was going to kill someone
this morning...

561
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,712
but l did it last night
so that l could be here.

562
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,677
Well, you're too kind.

563
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,870
Well, when you've changed
your clothes, these lovely ladies...

564
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,436
are waiting to serve you
with chilled champagne in the solarium.

565
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,357
Thank you.

566
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,957
Not bad. What do they mean?

567
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,640
Every time l kill a man...

568
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,911
l tattoo his portrait
on my body.

569
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,396
What do you do when you run out of room?
Stop killing people?

570
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,836
Hey, l bet Peru's got
some pretty nice tattoos.

571
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,271
You hombres, uh, go on ahead.

572
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,154
l have got to use
the, uh, powder room.

573
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,511
Come on!

574
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,591
Let's go!

575
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,230
- Champagne?
- Oh, yes.

576
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,555
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

577
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,317
Thank you.

578
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,637
Well, now that we're all here,
may l have your attention, please.

579
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,116
This is where
our little adventure began.

580
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,799
Gentlemen, may l present...

581
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,551
the Star of Kuristan.

582
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,034
The auction will commence
when you write down your opening bids.

583
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,080
Uh, l do not pass my cash...

584
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,998
until l get a close look
at the dingus.

585
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,237
Give it to me in my hand.

586
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,155
Mr Peru?

587
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,191
Your frog is leaking.

588
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,397
Oh. Well.

589
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,832
Gentlemen.

590
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,750
We have an impostor.
Mr Peru is Mr Magoo.

591
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,519
Why would Peru disguise himself
as Magoo?

592
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,631
Shut up, you idiot, and get him!

593
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,992
Keep your distance!
This hepcat has a black belt in mayhem.

594
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,116
Hold it!

595
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,277
Give me the Star of Kuristan.

596
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,952
The Star is mine!

597
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,479
Prunella!

598
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,670
The auction is off. Get out.

599
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,557
Come on, go!

600
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,833
My dear! By gum,
you almost had me fooled.

601
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,110
Unc, watch out.
She's got a gun.

602
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,596
Of course she has, Waldo!
She's a federal agent.

603
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,392
She's not what you think!

604
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,909
Now, Waldo, you're talking about
the woman who saved my life.

605
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,156
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

606
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,829
Oh, you can't tell me that yesterday
meant nothing to you.

607
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,350
l am a Viking
A lusty, trusty Viking

608
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,471
Yesterday sucked.

609
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,110
And you kissed a carp.

610
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,229
Prunella.

611
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,035
- Give me the jewel!
- This is all you ever wanted?

612
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,589
You're a true gentleman,
and there aren't many of those left.

613
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,551
Too bad you had to go
and get in my way.

614
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,675
All right, l got the gun now.
Halt or l'll fire!

615
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,399
Don't shoot!
lt's me! Waldo!

616
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:32,433
Great Scott!
Waldo, she's bamboozled me!

617
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,791
She, she, she, she, she's a, a sneak.
Uh, after her!

618
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,751
W-Wait. That'll be easier
with your clothes on.

619
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,872
Oh, yeah, clothes.
Oh, yes, yes, clothes.

620
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,797
This way.

621
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,115
- Police!
- Let's beat it!

622
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,356
Hold it!

623
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,118
Come on, let's go!

624
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,231
Look out! Freeze!

625
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,238
- Hold it!
- Keep your hands up!

626
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,392
- There!
- Come with me.

627
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,119
Get that man!

628
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,154
Hold it!

629
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,999
You'll just have to wait your turn.

630
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,870
- She's over there!
- Where?

631
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,394
There!

632
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,908
- lt's too late. lt's all over.
- Balderdash, Waldo!

633
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,430
lt ain't over
until we've cleared our good name.

634
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,357
Aha-ha! A snowboard.

635
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,552
After her, my boy!

636
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,717
- Wait, Unc, no!
- lt's as easy as pie!

637
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,956
That's the wrong kind of board!

638
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,109
Hold it!

639
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,196
- Hold on, Angus!
- Stupak, go after them!

640
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,189
The women's boarder cross final
is about to begin.

641
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,756
Ready, set, go!

642
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,952
Get back here, you Jezebel!

643
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,231
l'll catch you, Prunella!

644
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,557
And the winner of the women's
boarder cross final is a man!

645
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,877
A man? On an ironing board.

646
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,029
Hey!

647
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,032
- Excuse me.
- Up there.

648
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,077
Halt!
Hold it right there!

649
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,629
Ah, a detour.
l'll get you, Prunella!

650
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,029
Freeze!

651
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,919
Watch out!

652
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,789
What?

653
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,231
Unc?

654
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,954
Unc! Unc!

655
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,508
Are you all right?

656
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,519
Don't take that detour, Waldo!

657
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,870
Stay right there.
We'll be right down.

658
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,468
Come on, buddy.

659
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,474
Look! There's
some footprints down there!

660
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,592
They went that way!
Come on!

661
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,035
This is a good idea, Waldo.
You're the real McCoy.

662
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,071
A true Magoo.

663
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,631
l want Magoo.

664
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,070
Who can imagine?
Luanne Le Seur and Mr Magoo.

665
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,997
Yes, we're talking best-seller.

666
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:38,033
- l can't believe they did it.
- That's it! That's the title!

667
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,230
Now, we just have to check the airports
and search all the hotels...

668
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,078
and make sure
they don't get away.

669
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,877
Senor Peru.

670
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:08,111
One moment, my darling.
Yes?

671
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,789
The Star of Kuristan is ready
for delivery. You have 15 million?

672
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,037
Of course. lt will make
a fitting gift for my fiance.

673
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,232
- We are to be married this weekend.
- l'll be there tomorrow.

674
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,917
Good.

675
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,829
The Star of Kuristan.

676
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,436
Uh, excuse me.

677
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,074
Do you have a Luanne Le Seur
registered here?

678
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,794
l'll be with you in a moment.

679
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,677
lf you'd just sign here.

680
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,148
-Now, who did you want?
-Luanne Le Seur. ls she registered here?

681
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,033
See, we got an airline
late-luggage delivery...

682
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,755
but the party's not staying
at our hotel, so we're checking.

683
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,074
l see.

684
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,392
What hotel are you with?

685
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,592
The St. Paul.

686
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,790
l see.

687
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,912
lt says ''Fantasy World Costume Rental.''

688
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,234
Haven't they let you out
a little before Halloween?

689
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,633
- Madam.
- Oh, thank you, young man.

690
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,557
Have a good afternoon, madam.

691
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,396
Angus. Angus.
Now, stop that.

692
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,750
Unc, let's get out of here.
He's onto us.

693
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,868
- Let go.
- Angus, no!

694
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,797
- He's attacking that old lady!
- Great Scott!

695
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,910
Unhand that woman, Angus.

696
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,156
Let me see.

697
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,991
Wow!

698
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,950
Hey, lady,
you forgot your stuff.

699
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,638
What's that?

700
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,832
lt's an airline receipt
made out to ''Prunella Pagliacci.''

701
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,590
Prunella Pagliacci?
That woman is an impostor.

702
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,269
- Unc, that was Luanne Le Seur.
- Well, there, you see?

703
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,277
That's why Angus went after her.

704
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,197
Great Scott!

705
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,039
We had her within our grasp,
and she slipped through our fingers.

706
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,550
Balls of fire!
Oh, good dog, Angus. Good dog.

707
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,389
This receipt is for Brazil.
Why would she go to Brazil?

708
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,990
- She's going to Peru.
- She'd go to Brazil to go to Peru?

709
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,315
- Exactly.
- But why?

710
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,351
To get more for the ruby.

711
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,311
- Peru?
- Exactly.

712
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,035
- But then why go to Brazil?
- Peru is in Brazil.

713
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:59,312
- Peru is in Brazil?
- Ortega Peru is in Brazil.

714
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,271
Ortega Peru! Of course.

715
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,595
And that's why we're going to Brazil.

716
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,278
Come on, Waldo.

717
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,509
Unc, l, l think this is the place.

718
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,952
Attaboy, Waldo.
Ease up there, Angus.

719
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,310
l like your badge.

720
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,959
Angus.

721
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,275
l'm going on ahead.
You stay here.

722
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,470
l'm gonna eyeball the situation.

723
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,956
Unc, um, m-maybe l should do
the eyeballing.

724
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,994
Father.

725
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,351
Maybe we should leave out the bit
about ''till death do us part.''

726
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,711
- She's nervous enough already.
- Jefe.

727
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,711
Luanne Le Seur is here, Jefe.

728
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,118
Javier, after Rosita and l go
to EuroDisney...

729
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:24,038
have the Le Seur woman killed,
but quietly.

730
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,233
lf you disturb my guests,
l will be very disappointed.

731
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:01,753
Monkey bars. Must be
a children's playground.

732
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,236
Oh! Hello, little girl.

733
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,432
Did l interrupt you
in your afternoon nappy?

734
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:12,269
Now, now, we mustn't let
the grown-ups know that we're here.

735
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,551
Now here's something sweet,
a chocolate.

736
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,717
You go ahead. That's it.

737
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,071
Now, you go on back to sleep.

738
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,509
There you are, honey.

739
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,758
You're the ugliest child
l've ever seen.

740
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,633
And needs a change of diaper, too.

741
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,796
Oh, oh, Waldo.
Hold on.

742
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,390
The little angel is trying to sleep.
So, you know--

743
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,911
Well, where did she go?
Kids. Can't sit still for a second.

744
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,390
Ah, well, l think
she's run off there...

745
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,636
where she can have
her chocolate in private.

746
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,557
Now, Waldo, this is the plan.

747
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,910
l will gain entry to the house
through a window.

748
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:00,795
You keep an eye on the lawn party
and spot Luanne Le Seur if you can.

749
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,990
Waldo, you need to take some Tic-Tacs.

750
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,031
- Unc, it's not me.
- Please, please. l, l--

751
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,720
l am talking to someone here, Waldo.
Now, please.

752
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,070
Now, what you have to do is--

753
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,876
Great Scott!

754
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,479
Step on it, Unc!

755
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,551
Stop! Stop! Go back!

756
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,639
Come on, Angus! Come on!

757
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,514
Good boy.

758
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,791
Unc, there's Luanne.

759
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,354
All right.
Now, l'll nab him.

760
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,233
You keep your eye on Le Suer,
but don't forget:

761
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,319
She's smart, dangerous, ruthless,
soft, beautiful, a good kisser--

762
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,954
- Unc!
- Huh? Yeah, all right, all right.

763
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,595
Keep your eye open for pitfalls.

764
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,631
How are you?

765
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,674
Senorita Le Seur,
at last we meet.

766
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,112
- You have the Star?
- Do you have the 15 million?

767
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,110
lt may take them time to count.

768
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,188
Please stay for the wedding. Afterwards,
l will have Javier take care of you.

769
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,992
Thank you.

770
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,679
Do it quietly
and don't disturb the guests...

771
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,598
or l'll be very disappointed.

772
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,430
Kid, are you lost?

773
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,117
l was looking for the pool.

774
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,551
- Wow! Oh, it's beautiful.
- Ooh, pretty, yes?

775
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:51,432
- l'll go get the bridesmaids.
- Okay.

776
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,439
Hello?

777
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,279
Oh!

778
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,711
Time for a little Red Cross here,
Magoo.

779
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,354
Let me see.

780
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,596
Oh, my dear child!

781
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,395
You should have your dentist
file down those teeth.

782
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,910
Rosita? Darling?

783
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,718
Are you with no clothes on?

784
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,792
ls everything all right?

785
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,674
l'm crazy with the love, m amor.

786
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,155
l will see you soon,
my precious flower.

787
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,919
Before we take our sacred vows,
precious one, l have a surprise.

788
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,075
So do l!
Adios, amor. Nuevo nacho.

789
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,556
lt wouldn't last.
l've never loved you.

790
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,588
- Get him!
- Out of the way!

791
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,392
Waldo?

792
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,715
Unc, help! Over here!

793
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,517
- This is no time for a rope exercise.
- Unc, that thing's down here.

794
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,991
- Good Lord!
- The rope, Unc, get the rope.

795
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,473
- The rope?
- Magoo!

796
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,835
This is the rope
that can save the boy.

797
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,349
All right, let's have at it.

798
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,996
l will exchange the ruby
for the rope.

799
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,432
Of course, take it. Take it.
But help me with the boy.

800
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,111
You know, l should have you killed,
but l admire a family man.

801
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,435
- You'll be safe in a minute, Waldo.
- Ready?

802
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,232
- Ready.
- Good luck.

803
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,958
Hold on there, Waldo.

804
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,077
Helicopter!
Magoo has brought police!

805
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,432
lt's that way!

806
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,358
- Attaboy, Angus. Good boy.
- Whoa! Whoa!

807
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,677
- Higher! Pull!
- Good, Angus.

808
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,871
Here we are. Police! Don't move
Stay there!

809
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,037
Ortega Peru!
He's escaping that way!

810
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,949
No one escapes Magoo.

811
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,000
There goes the bride.

812
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:55,318
Oh, man! You'd think Peru
could've done better than that.

813
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,992
Magoo's dog!
Let's get him!

814
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,311
You weren't leaving without me,
were you?

815
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,952
There's the getaway limo.
Hold your horses!

816
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,395
- Unc!
- Arrest him!

817
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,551
Call the chopper!
We have to stop him!

818
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,270
Show me the ruby.

819
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,392
Big nasty woman!
Get back!

820
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,158
Thank you. Crime never pays, my boy.
Could you pull over?

821
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,157
l'd like to get off.

822
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:48,874
Ortega Peru, you are under arrest!
Land your helicopter now!

823
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:55,951
Don't panic.
We're dropping down a raft.

824
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,353
Swim toward the raft.

825
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,710
Hurry up.
Swim toward the raft.

826
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,512
We are dropping you a line.

827
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,359
You'll have to hook it up
to the raft.

828
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,552
- Then we will pull you to safety.
- Got you now, missy.

829
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,758
Stay calm.

830
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,110
Hook it to the raft.

831
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:28,439
Quincy, please, give me the jewel.
You and me together--

832
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,439
Luanne Le Seur, you have
the heart of an artichoke.

833
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,439
Stop wasting time!
You're headed for a waterfall.

834
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,479
Great Scott!

835
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,758
We're safe now.

836
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,792
lt's hooked to the raft.
Pull us up.

837
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:09,273
Well, look at that rainbow, Magoo.
You just might be a leprechaun.

838
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,311
La Cascada de Muerte,
the Falls of Death...

839
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,431
where many a bride
left stranded at the alter...

840
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,950
has jumped to her final--

841
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,310
Oh, my goodness!
Another one! Aye!

842
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,710
- Are you all right, dear?
- W-Well, l'm, l'm all right.

843
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,637
l'm, l'm fine.

844
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,514
Oh, that's the spirit, dear.
You'll find someone else.

845
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,074
lt's inner beauty that counts.

846
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,760
Words of wisdom, my dear.

847
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,996
Words of wisdom.

848
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,715
Magoo, you've done it again.
Have a good day.

849
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,229
Whoa!

850
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,031
Who are you?
What are you doing?

851
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,833
l am Simone Deculaat,
the wedding caterer.

852
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,236
Oh, you'll love prison, Simone.
They make great ''loaf de meat.''

853
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,510
Hey, hey, hey, come here.
Get a picture.

854
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,197
How's my hair look?

855
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,152
- Well done.
- Very nice.

856
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,077
Thank you.

857
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,600
Waldo, thank you.

858
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,517
Oh, you're welcome.

859
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,234
What will you do now?

860
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,397
Well, Uncle Quincy just created
a new position for me in his company.

861
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,636
You're looking at
the head of security.

862
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,440
And now that you have found
your path in life...

863
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,552
l suppose you would not be willing
to return to Kuristan with me.

864
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,272
ln a heartbeat.

865
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,475
Well, you don't have to.

866
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,875
l like it here much better.

867
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,956
- Wow!
- Oh, Waldo!

868
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:04,792
Mr Magoo. Um, sorry we, uh,
put you through all that.

869
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,911
Would you autograph this for us?

870
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:11,477
By Jove! A-And a very good likeness
of me, too, l must say.

871
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:15,159
You boys certainly move fast.

872
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,872
The TV movie airs Friday.

873
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,673
Quite right. Quite right.
Always keep moving.

874
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,756
Come on, Angus.

875
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,915
Have a good day.

876
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,832
Well, Angus, it looks like
it's just you and me now.

877
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:32,076
Don't take this wrong, but l feel
that there's someone out there...

878
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,997
the perfect somebody just for me...

879
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:38,875
and someday Cupid is gonna fire
into the heart of the bull's-eye.

880
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,515
And this is one steep staircase.

881
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:47,953
Good exercise
for an old dinosaur like me.

882
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,958
lndeed! Oh, by Jupiter!

883
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,470
Oh, Magoo, you've done it again!

884
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,560
Oh. Pardon me, madam.

885
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,278
Oh, Magoo, you dog!

886
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:29,915
B-mark.

887
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:33,316
Come on, now. One and two. One and two.

888
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,910
Higher! One and two. One and two.

889
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,156
Don't stop until you're ready to drop.

890
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,352
Come on, left leg. Keep going.
One and two. One and two.

891
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,872
Unc.

892
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,794
Yes?

893
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,479
Stick 'em up.

894
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,228
Gimme that!

895
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,635
No. You give it to me.

896
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:01,670
Cut!

897
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,349
Angus, it's a struggle
against the beast.

898
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,149
- Oh, l really got him. Oh, no.
- Cut!

899
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,273
Remember, l hire people to kill people.

900
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,352
- Cut.
- Let me help you.

901
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,354
Get up there, Billy.
Come on, Billy. Come on, boy.

902
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,119
Pee. Go ahead, pee.
Come on, pee, boy.

903
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:01,835
That's it. Pee. Pee.
Good boy! Good boy!

904
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,274
Cut.

905
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,517
Cut.

906
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,634
Quiet. Action!

907
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:39,909
Damn!
