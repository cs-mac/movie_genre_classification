1
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,719
- Happy birthday, Alice.
- Hi, Dad.

2
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,072
We got a new patient at the back.
Your kind of dog, you know?

3
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,951
You can see him after school.

4
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,469
He's so cute. Aw!

5
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,394
Hey, little boy. Thanks, Dad.

6
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,870
- Guess which hand.
- The right one.

7
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,312
Yes.

8
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,714
A locket. I love it.
Thanks, Mum. I love you.

9
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,552
I love you too.

10
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,153
Birthday girl.

11
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,993
Oh, you're so silly!

12
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,631
And straight to school. Happy birthday!

13
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,153
Hi, boy. How are you?

14
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,312
Did Dad fix you OK?

15
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,076
No!

16
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,156
Excuse me. Um...

17
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,951
Is this hypoallergenic?

18
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,234
- Hello there.
- Afternoon, Arthur.

19
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,949
- Afternoon, boss.
- You here to keep your hand in?

20
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,234
I would normally. The knee,
you see, not getting any better.

21
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,391
That's why I got a younger man in.

22
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,391
Steady hand, see.

23
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,951
Just steady her there, yeah?

24
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,231
Ah, there we are.

25
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,313
Hello. I'm sorry, I was hoping
to get something for a headache.

26
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,870
Sure. Come in.

27
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,309
Headache, was it, Miss Brogan?

28
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,871
- Mary. Are you all right?
- Yes, yeah.

29
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,234
I... I didn't see anyone else come in.

30
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,868
- Are you two togeth...?
- My niece. Deirdre.

31
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,071
- Hi.
- She's visiting.

32
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,471
- Looks like you need a refill.
- Right.

33
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,790
Yeah, thank you.

34
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,555
When did you do the place up?
It looks really different.

35
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,551
- Just recently.
- Must be nine months.

36
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,951
More, even, since they moved here.

37
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,469
Ventolin. I need to see a prescription.

38
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,234
I might have it here.
I do hold on to everything.

39
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,312
- How long are you visiting for?
- What a relief.

40
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,310
This expired last year.

41
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,719
Hey.

42
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,393
You all right?

43
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,234
- What are you doing?
- You know what I'm doing.

44
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,072
No!

45
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,313
It's like a black hole in here.

46
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,471
We're not just throwing
Alice's stuff away.

47
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,950
- No, we can't keep them.
- D'you not understand?

48
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,711
I'm not... I'm not ready.

49
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,311
You'd forget her if you could.

50
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,309
What can I do?

51
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,470
You can let me go.

52
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,639
It's not you, Patrick.
It's not because of you.

53
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,153
You know what?
All I want is for you to be OK.

54
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,151
Drive me to the station.

55
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,871
What is it?

56
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,790
We'll get some help at Arthur's place.
He'll know a mechanic.

57
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,998
Listen. It's there when the wind dies.

58
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,151
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

59
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,631
Brilliant.

60
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,155
These look like gravestones.

61
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,071
Car's there.

62
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,791
- I'll try and call him.
- I'll check round the back.

63
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,312
Let's go home.

64
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,471
What happened?

65
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,791
Louise.

66
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,153
-  Talk to me, will you?
- Look, I just wanna go to bed.

67
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,640
Louise, Patrick.

68
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,475
Arthur, what are you doing here?

69
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,555
I just wanted to make sure that
everything's all right with you both.

70
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,630
- What do you mean?
- Well, is it?

71
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,630
 Our car broke down
in the middle of nowhere.

72
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,475
We walked to your place,
couldn't raise you.

73
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,315
What is this, Arthur?
You just let yourself into our home?

74
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,313
Country habits, I suppose.

75
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,471
You say you came to my place.

76
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,711
Well, that would make sense.

77
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,077
- What the hell is this?
- All right, I'm going.

78
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,719
You're doing a great job here, Patrick.

79
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,318
We're so glad you chose Wakewood
and hope you've found solace here.

80
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,959
 Yeah, we're fine.

81
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,393
And how about you, Louise?

82
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,071
Is everything all right with you?

83
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,308
Deirdre?

84
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,151
- Are you...
- There you are, my pet.

85
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,473
- I'm going home today.
- Is she OK?

86
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,073
Fine, thanks.

87
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,312
- Now...
- I can't wait to go back.

88
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,994
I know, lovely. It's gone so fast.

89
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,871
Um, uh...

90
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,070
There. For the sunglasses.

91
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,791
Come on, darlir.

92
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,479
Alice has a lovely voice.

93
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,632
- Tell me my daughter's name.
- I don't know.

94
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,475
- Tell me. Tell me my daughter's name.
- I don't know, truly.

95
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,631
Her name was Alice.

96
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,790
Now, how did you niece know that?

97
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,315
What goes on in Wakewood
is not for everyone.

98
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,311
And what goes on?

99
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,552
Please, make another baby to love.

100
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,151
I can't.

101
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,719
I know how you feel.

102
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,232
No, I don't think you do.

103
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,312
Deirdre's not your niece.
So, then, tell me.

104
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,711
You want to get your daughter back,
don't you?

105
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,153
Is that possible?

106
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,074
I can't say, and that's the truth.

107
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,154
- Hello.
-  Hey.

108
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,231
I've gotta go over to O'Shea's.
Can you help?

109
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,870
- I can't.
- Pick you up at ten?

110
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,958
- Go on, go on. Get in there.

111
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,548
Go on, get in there.

112
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,233
Go on, get up there.

113
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,551
- That's a bitch of a fever he's got.
- Yeah, he has all right.

114
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,950
I'll give him a shot.
Can you prep 35 mil?

115
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,072
And maybe get
an anti-inflammatory as well.

116
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,869
 Go on, get up.
Get up here! Go on. Get up there!

117
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,470
-  Move up. Move him up.
-  Go up there.

118
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,154
- Go on, get up. Get up, get up!
- He won't move, Da.

119
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,470
 Come on!

120
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,388
Come on!

121
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,719
- What are you doing?
- Let me see.

122
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,156
- Shush, woman!
- I'll try and get him where he is.

123
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,308
Keep still.

124
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,316
We're gonna have to get him
up to the restraint. Go on! Go on!

125
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,471
- Bad idea, Mick.
- Don't be upsetting yourself.

126
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,995
-  Get out of there, Mick!
- Come on! Come on!

127
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,236
- Come on!
-  Da, please! Da, please.

128
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,394
 Get out of there! Pull him up!
Pull him up! Pull him up!

129
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,632
Open the front gate!

130
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,393
I can't! It's stuck! Push it!

131
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,994
Da! Da!

132
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,390
Da.

133
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,551
You did everything possible.

134
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,711
I think you'd better find someone else
to run the practice.

135
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,552
We're leaving Wakewood.

136
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,950
It's been a shock to you.
We'll talk tomorrow.

137
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,151
Arthur.

138
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,069
We're not staying.

139
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,393
Tell me about your daughter.

140
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,154
- This isn't the time.
- I think it is the time.

141
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,311
- Arthur...
- Listen to me.

142
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,631
Listen to me.

143
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,788
I can bring your daughter back to life
for a short time,

144
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,556
so you can see her, hold her again
and say goodbye properly.

145
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,235
- Would that ease your pain, hm?
- That's not funny.

146
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,075
If she's been dead for less than a year,
I can bring her back.

147
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,152
It's only for three days.
For most people it's enough.

148
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,312
That is ridiculous. It is nonsense.

149
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,074
All right. All right.

150
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,310
But do one thing for me, Patrick.

151
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,630
Before you deride my offer...

152
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,069
...ask your wife.

153
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,472
She knows.

154
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,710
- I told you already.
- You didn't tell me anything.

155
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,474
- Please, just stop this.
- Stop this? Stop what?

156
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,551
- What is it you think I'm doing?
- Come on, babe.

157
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,870
Please, come on, be straight with me.
What did you see?

158
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,071
What did you see?

159
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,631
I saw something like...

160
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,229
What?

161
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,312
A birth... maybe.

162
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,950
And?

163
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,391
I believe him.

164
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,995
Patrick, I believe what Arthur said.

165
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,314
If we do this, will you stay?

166
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,791
Louise?

167
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,631
I just want her back.

168
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,878
OK.

169
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,071
But it's not so simple, is it?

170
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,632
If we have to lie, isn't it won'th it?

171
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,072
- What was your daughter's name?
- Alice.

172
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,639
Alice Hannah Daley.

173
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,631
Alice Hannah Daley.

174
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,709
- Did she prefer mornings or evenings?
- Mornings.

175
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,959
- Was her skin moist or dry?
- Moist.

176
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,790
Would she have liked
cats, cows or horses?

177
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,155
Horses, ponies, definitely.

178
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,994
- Was her hair thick or lank?
- It was fine. Wasrt it?

179
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,393
Quite fine.

180
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,878
- What time of the year was she born?
- October. 22nd.

181
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,633
How long has your daughter
been in the ground?

182
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,879
Patrick, how long has your daughter
been dead and buried?

183
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,550
It's been eleven months,
two weeks, two days.

184
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,153
This is what we can do.

185
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,630
Your daughter will be brought back.
Make the most of the time.

186
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,553
And after she'll go back to the woods.

187
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,315
- She's just on loan.
- Will she be normal?

188
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,472
Yes, quite. Her heart will beat,
her breath will breathe

189
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,552
and she'll remember the time
she had with you, some of it.

190
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,712
It lasts for three days only,

191
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,793
during which you must keep Alice
within the townland of Wakewood.

192
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,636
The wind turbines lie beyond
our boundary. Let them be your guide.

193
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,633
This is a physical necessity.

194
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,791
Why only three days?

195
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,879
We tap the life force
of a fresh cadaver.

196
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,230
Three days' won'th is all we get.

197
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,952
Perhaps it mirrors the stages
of existence, birth, life, death.

198
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,151
I don't truly know.

199
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,236
Now, for this to work, we need a body,

200
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,152
and, as you are more than well aware,

201
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,869
we have recently had a tragedy
in the community.

202
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,877
Perhaps we should prevail on the family.

203
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,158
The ritual of the return
binds you to Wakewood.

204
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,314
You will settle here permanently
and you will tend animals without fail

205
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,869
whenever this town needs you.

206
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,072
Do we have an agreement?

207
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,153
We just wanna see her again.

208
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,632
Then you shall.

209
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,999
You were there. The vet's wife.

210
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,632
Yes.

211
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,472
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

212
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,708
Mrs O'Shea,
I'm very sorry for your loss.

213
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,470
In my mind, he's the young boy I met.

214
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,871
Our daughter was killed last year.

215
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,071
She was our only child.

216
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,951
When she was born, it didn't go well.

217
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,550
I can't have any more.

218
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,313
I know this is
a terrible time for you, but...

219
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,793
...I need to ask you
if we can use your husband's remains

220
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,313
to help bring her back.

221
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,709
- You don't know what you're asking.
- No, you're right. I don't.

222
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,155
But I need to see her again.

223
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,079
You live in Wakewood now, don't you?
But it's not part of you.

224
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,879
You're just visiting maybe.
I can't imagine what that's like.

225
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,956
We're all born here.

226
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,879
Mrs O'Shea,
we're very happy in Wakewood.

227
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,871
Stand up for me.

228
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,549
- No, it's not right.
- What?

229
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,551
I don't know what it is,
but it's not right. I won't do it.

230
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,075
Peggy, they have to ask.

231
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,877
You're upset.

232
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,956
There is something I don't like.

233
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,950
They have to ask you,
but you have to be amenable, Peggy.

234
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,720
That's the only way this can continue.

235
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,713
Do you not want
to see Mick yourself, hm?

236
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,074
You wouldn't deny me Mick's return.

237
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,991
They need your help.

238
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,076
You'll need to provide a relic of Alice
for the ritual.

239
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,229
 Like what?

240
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,311
In this case,
we're close to the time limit.

241
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,469
Her favourite teddy?

242
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,632
The relic needs to be
more closely connected. A lock of hair.

243
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,395

We don't have anything like that.

244
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,554
Whatever you provide,
it needs to be personal to Alice.

245
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,473
In a corporal, physical way.

246
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,631
Very much so.

247
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,791
D'you understand?

248
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,471
 You think Peggy knows?

249
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,391
You're ready?

250
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,309
You're very welcome.

251
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,951
Come.

252
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,633
We have to crush his thorax first.

253
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,998
In times past,
they did this with a lump hammer.

254
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,150
Right, that'll do!

255
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,709
Patrick, lend a hand.

256
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,633
Now we cut the spinal cord.

257
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,312
You do it for me, would you, Patrick?

258
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,869
We need the relic.

259
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,389
Very good.

260
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,995
On the wild wind thee fly,
'tween this world and the next,

261
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,232
from that twilight realm
you see o'er your perch

262
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,995
the trials of the living
and the wake of the dead.

263
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,555
Help us now call Alice,

264
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,551
and bring her here for three days

265
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,712
and afterwards return.

266
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,316
Go to the trees. Lie among the roots.

267
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,550
Go to the trees. Lie among the roots.

268
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,234
Take these hands.

269
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,231
Alice.

270
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,390
- Take these bones.
- Alice.

271
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,950
- Take this heart.
-  Alice.

272
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,390
And, Alice, take these eyes.

273
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,391
Bring him down.

274
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,996
Now we need living blood.
Female blood would be better.

275
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,231
Cut me.

276
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,150
Come, come.

277
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,314
Stand back, stand back.

278
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,472
Feel now the power of transformation

279
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,393
course through your true selves.

280
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,710
Look away, look away!

281
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,552
Avert your gaze!

282
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,155
Here she comes. Here she comes.

283
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,071
Here she comes.

284
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,392
Here she comes. Here she comes.

285
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,311
Here she comes.

286
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,475
Oh, my baby. Oh, my baby.

287
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,949
My baby. Alice.

288
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,869
 Your hair's grown so long.

289
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,788
I had such a strange dream.

290
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,951
It's over now.

291
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,790
- Her eyes are brown.
- Yeah, Mick had brown eyes.

292
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,234
- Where's Alice?
- Getting dressed.

293
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,634
- Hey, sweetie.
- Did you sleep well?

294
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,870
The house seems strange.

295
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,394
- It...
- Yeah, it is. Um...

296
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,155
- We came here for a break.
- I must have slept the whole way.

297
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,799
 Is this for real?

298
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,153
After you.

299
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,709
No, you're not gonna get me.

300
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,709
 Oh, Alice.

301
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,076
-  Come on, start counting.
- One, two, three, four,

302
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,708
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

303
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,236
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

304
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,154
I'm coming, ready or not!

305
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,640
- I got you!

306
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,995
I found your father!

307
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,394
He's my prisoner! You're next!

308
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,871
Alice!

309
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,868
Come on, baby! Where are you?

310
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,991
 Alice!

311
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,471
Alice?

312
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,799
Alice!

313
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,551
Al!

314
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,311
 Alice!

315
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,708
Come on!

316
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,073
Alice.

317
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,630
Oh, sweetie. Are you OK?

318
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,959
What's that doing there?

319
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,152
I don't know. Maybe somebody put it
there to ward off the other birds.

320
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,871
- Hey, I found something.
- What?

321
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,798
Pick a hand.

322
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,957
- Pick another hand.
- Wrong.

323
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,151
Do you remember when you got it?

324
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,311
You gave it to me sometime.

325
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,151
Come on, baby. Time to go.

326
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,719
Mum, did you hear music last night?

327
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,953
- What kind of music?
- Voices, singing my name.

328
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,155
We'll take him home
and I can stitch him.

329
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,072
He doesn't have a collar.

330
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,471
- Dad.
- Uh-huh?

331
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,551
Can I do it?

332
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,950
Yeah, go and put
some of those gloves on.

333
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,996
OK, hold it. Hold it really tight.

334
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,791
Now, OK.

335
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:41,312
Now, open that. Take that piece.

336
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,993
Hang on. You pull that through and up.

337
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,951
Like that.

338
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,153
People shouldn't hurt animals,
should they?

339
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,389
No, they shouldn't.

340
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,791
And animals
shouldn't hurt people either.

341
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,236
Well, that's kind of different,
you know?

342
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,878
I'd heard you'd had a bit of trouble.

343
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,719
- Could say that, yeah.
- Mm.

344
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,316
- Dad, can we keep him?
- Well, I don't see why not.

345
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,552
- Mum said we could.
- Oh, she did, did she?

346
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,236
- I'm gonna call him Howie.
- Howie? Ooh, I like it.

347
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,709
Don't make it hard to say goodbye.

348
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,711
- Good night.
- Night.

349
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,630
- Got some blankets for us.
- OK.

350
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,078
Once upon a time, there was
a little tearaway called Alice.

351
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,552
- No, called Louise.
- This about me, is it?

352
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,871
OK, called Louise, and she lived
with her brothers and sisters.

353
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,878
- And her sheepdog.
- And her sheepdog.

354
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,550
And they lived in a big house on a hill
overlooking the city.

355
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,872
And the house had a field
and an orchard.

356
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,991
And every year the trees...

357
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,869
Hello, Alice. How are you?

358
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,310
How would you like
to come and ride our pony?

359
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,710
Dad, I'm going pony riding.

360
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,954
- Mrs O'Shea, it's very kind of you...
- Alice wants to ride our pony.

361
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,548
And it needs the exercise.
I'll bring her back later.

362
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,950
I'm sorry,
but, um, we made plans for today.

363
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,390
- No, Dad, I want to go now.
- Calm down.

364
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,632
- Mum, I've been invited pony riding.
- Oh?

365
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,312
Why don't you all come?

366
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,710
Tell you what, why we don't have
some breakfast and then we'll see.

367
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,869
OK.

368
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,551
Keep her awake.

369
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,957
Now, would you like
to pop over a jump?

370
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,879
D'you think she's ready?
She's hardly ever ridden.

371
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,230
She'll be fine. She's a natural.

372
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,994
See that? No bother at all.

373
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,873
We have some tea and sandwiches
going inside. Would you like to come in?

374
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,554
- Alice, are you ready?
-  Let her finish up.

375
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,235
We'll come in when she's done.
She won't be long, I promise.

376
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,076
Alice, there's a game
you might enjoy playing.

377
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,313
- What's the game?
- It's a quiz.

378
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,632
I ask the questions, you answer,
I keep score.

379
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,548
Now, Alice Daley, what is your name?

380
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,550
Right, I see the way it is.

381
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,790
Tell me, when you close your eyes
when you're tired,

382
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,791
what do you see,
more yellow or brown?

383
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,235
I see a big red shape.

384
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,551
Go on, have another one there, Patrick.

385
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,711
I think maybe we should check on Alice.

386
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,553
- Yeah.
- They'll be back any minute.

387
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,791
Let me see your hand.

388
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,957
And what's your date of birth?

389
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,871
I think I know, a little bird told me,
but if you're not more cooperative,

390
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,230
I don't think
you'll be riding that pony again.

391
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,154
Alice, are you a normal little girl?

392
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,878
Why would you ask me that?

393
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,870
- Why don't you look at me?
- I've seen enough.

394
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,150
- What's up, sweetie?
- I don't like that woman.

395
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,631
She's not right.
You've got to take her back.

396
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,995
-  Alice.
- Al, wait a sec.

397
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,391
Alice!

398
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,471
Peggy knows. Let's take our chances
and get out of Wakewood.

399
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,473
Then we leave right now.
You go get the car.

400
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,631
Hey, Alice!

401
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,871
Mum's gonna come and pick us up, OK?

402
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,951
Did Mrs O'Shea frighten you?

403
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,309
Alice.

404
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,311
- Alice!

405
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,993
Open the door!

406
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,076
- What happened?
- Open it!

407
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,798
What happened to her?

408
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,789
- Go back. Go back!
- Is she OK?

409
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,997
- What happened?
-  We tried to leave.

410
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,151
What happened?

411
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,151
Howie, good boy!

412
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,071
We're trapped.

413
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,551
Did you hear something?

414
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,552
We must put Alice back in the ground
where she belongs.

415
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,474
- Do it now.
- Three days. We have one day left.

416
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,074
-  We cannot delay.
- You tried to leave.

417
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,312
Now, wait a minute.
She made Alice very frightened.

418
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,471
-  It was necessary.
- It was cruel.

419
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,631
I'm disappointed.

420
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,792
You have to obey the rules, Patrick.
I thought I made that absolutely clear.

421
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,871
- Give up your last day.
- Do it now.

422
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,152
- Put her back, to be safe.
- You're not taking her.

423
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,551
- Louise, you'd better bring her now.
- You're not taking my baby.

424
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,396
- We want you to do this.
- Mum. Why are they here?

425
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,155
- It's OK.
-  Three days, Arthur.

426
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,959
I'll fight you and every one of you
if I have to. Do you understand?

427
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,629
Patrick, we've come to talk,
and there are people here

428
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,316
who believe there's something amiss,
something not according to plan.

429
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,631
- Do you see any signs of that?
- No, I don't, none at all.

430
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,155
You must tell me
if you observe anything unexpected,

431
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,153
anything beyond what we discussed,
do you understand?

432
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,392
The smallest detail
could have disastrous consequences.

433
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,074
She's fine. She's our little girl.

434
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,309
For one more day.

435
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,312
Alice, wait here.

436
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,311
Patrick?

437
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,151
Oh, my God.

438
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,550
I don't understand.
Why would they do this to Howie?

439
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,951
- Are we so sure that it was them?
- What are you saying?

440
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,871
Alice.

441
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,075
Show me your hands.

442
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,153
- Is this a game?
- Yeah, it's a game.

443
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,869
Alice, show me your hands.

444
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,312
Alice, go to your room and play.

445
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,959
 Why?

446
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,151
- Louise.
-  Go upstairs.

447
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,878
This is Alice's last day.

448
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,628
Today you must be strong for her.

449
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,873
But she'll want to go herself.
You won't have to persuade her.

450
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,471
Here's something for her to wear
around her neck.

451
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,949
We call it a clutch.
You'll find it gives her comfort.

452
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,229
Sure.

453
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,712
If she becomes agitated,
you can fasten it about her wrists.

454
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,793
Mary, I need
to talk to my husband for a sec.

455
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,153
I can't do this. I'm not ready. I can't.

456
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,788
We could run.

457
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,075
-  This is all wrong.

458
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,151
Hello?

459
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,312
Yeah, look, I'll come tomorrow.

460
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,870
OK, 20 minutes.

461
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,712
- No.
- I've got to.

462
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,713
You want them all here again,
banging their sticks?

463
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,996
You just keep her away from Alice.

464
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,631
I'll come back before midnight
and we'll go to the woods.

465
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,791
Alice?

466
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,074
Hey.

467
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,471
Whers the baby coming?

468
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,949
What?

469
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,711
 Alice?

470
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,871
Where are you?

471
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,714
-  Anything you can do?
- We can put him out of his misery.

472
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,718
 Injection, is it?

473
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,630
No, he's too big.

474
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,150
Alice. Alice! Baby...

475
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,473
Alice! Alice!

476
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,072
It's time to go to the woods.

477
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,469
Interesting.

478
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,790
Arthur.

479
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,150
 Get out of this house.

480
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,069
Don't look at her.

481
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,870
Ben, don't look at her.

482
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,551
Look away.

483
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,632
Don't look at her. Look away. Ben!

484
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,234
Go back to the trees
and lie among the roots.

485
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,073
Go back to the trees
and lie among the roots.

486
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,231
Go back to the trees
and lie among the roots.

487
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,470
Back to the trees
and lie among the roots!

488
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,639
 I'll see you later.

489
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,149
Now...

490
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,631
That won't work on me.

491
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,549
Alice?

492
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,959
Patrick, is Alice here? Is she with you?

493
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,151
Listen, I think
Alice has done something...

494
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,470
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me, Louise.

495
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,631
Patrick, I'm pregnant.

496
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,708
No, you're not.

497
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,634
- No, you can't be. That's impossible.
- I know, but I am.

498
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,791
Alice found out.
I... I mean, she already knew.

499
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,554
I've looked everywhere for her.
I thought maybe she'd come here.

500
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,553
Yeah, yeah, I think she did come here.
Come and look.

501
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,870
Oh, my...

502
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,996
Where would she have gone?

503
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,151
Home, sooner or later.

504
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,871
What the hell have we done?

505
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,872
- What's wrong with it?
- I don't know.

506
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,471
There's some stuff on the road.

507
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,311
 Oh, my God.

508
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,959
Oh!

509
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,308
 Get in.

510
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,710
 Mum!

511
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,393
Alice?

512
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,550
- You were going to leave me.
- We didn't know where you were.

513
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,314
I'm right here.

514
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:10,950
Dad, am I dead?

515
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,311
I've got something for you, Alice.

516
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,552
Do you want me to fasten it on for you?

517
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,153
Thanks, Dad.

518
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:47,870
- Love you.
- Love you, Dad. And you too, Mum.

519
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,313
I love you too.

520
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,391
I wanna stay with you.

521
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,714
- What is it? What's happened?
- We found her in the woods.

522
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,713
- It's all gone wrong.
- What have you done?

523
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,156
- I think she's stopped breathing.
- She'll not stay that way.

524
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,153
- You have the clutch I gave you?
- No, it's not here.

525
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,313
May we all survive.

526
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,391
Please put me down.

527
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,948
I don't wanna go back.

528
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,151
I don't want to be on my own again.

529
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,151
Why are you making me do this?

530
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,709
We're almost there.

531
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,631
Patrick?

532
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,868
 Come now, Alice. It's time.

533
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,233
Alice!

534
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,312
Stop!

535
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,948
Mum.

536
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,392
11 months, two weeks and two days.

537
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,312
- Well, you fooled me, Patrick.
- We wanted to see her again.

538
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,789
- You wanted to keep us here.
- How long has she been dead?

539
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:44,949
A year...

540
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,072
A month, a couple of days.
Let me go. I can help.

541
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,152
The clutch will release you
when she's back in the ground.

542
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,551
-  Mum!
- Arthur, she'll kill my wife!

543
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,711
 Where are you?

544
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,154
I hope not.

545
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,479
 Mum!

546
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,879
Dad!

547
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,311
Alice!

548
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,234
Alice!

549
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,232
Alice!

550
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,559
Mum!

551
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,633
Alice, it's me!

552
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,392
Hey, sweetie.

553
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,391
Why did you run away?

554
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,995
I was scared.

555
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,071
Are you still scared?

556
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,151
- Not really.
- I bet you are.

557
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:40,158
- Maybe just a little bit.
- You could come to me now, though.

558
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,311
I know, but...

559
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,314
...l'm a little tired.

560
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,152
Mum.

561
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,151
Yes, sweetie.

562
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,390
Can I have a hug?

563
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,992
Course you can.

564
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,711
I'm sorry.

565
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,958
It's OK. Off to bed.

566
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,718
Off to blanket street.

567
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,072
Almost there.

568
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,151
I'll just make up the bed.

569
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,871
There we go.

570
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,311
Are you comfy?

571
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:10,393
Once upon a time there was a little girl

572
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,233
who went for a long walk in the woods.

573
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:17,630
She walked and walked

574
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,236
until she discovered
she had lost her way,

575
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:25,552
and although the darkness
was drawing near,

576
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,712
the little girl knew
she didn't have far to go.

577
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,951
The cottage and safety
were only a few steps away.

578
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:41,473
A few short steps and she would be happy
for ever and ever.

579
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,552
The door opened...

580
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,550
...and her mum and dad
took her into their arms...

581
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,959
...and into the warmth.

582
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,799
And the door closed

583
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:05,714
on the cold and the darkness...

584
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,389
...and the night.

585
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,471
Louise.

586
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,950
-  Help me!
-  Patrick!

587
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,551
 Help me!

588
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,719
No!

589
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,713
Louise! Louise!

590
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,958
Louise!

591
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,071
They've gone, Patrick.

592
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,871
You won't find them.

593
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,235
I tried to warn you
there'd be consequences.

594
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,471
So, how is it?

595
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,631
It's OK.

596
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,314
- And Alice?
- She's great.

597
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:06,234
We miss you.
She's hoping for a baby sister.

598
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,231
Really?

599
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,631
How much do you remember?

600
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,951
I don't really know.

601
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,471
I'll be there in a minute.
