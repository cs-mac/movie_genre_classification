{29}{57}Fuck me!
{62}{133}Well, I would,|but somebody beat me to it.
{258}{312}Cool.
{638}{777}Listen. Dad, I know|that was a little bit awkward, but I...
{779}{841}I just hope you used one.
{843}{921}- One what?|- Used something... That you used something.
{923}{949}Something.
{951}{1005}Used a... You know what I'm...
{1007}{1055}Used a rubber or something like that.
{1079}{1107}- But...|- Protection!
{1109}{1227}Oh, uh... But we didn't, uh...
{1229}{1294}'Cause I'm gonna tell you something.|Herpes isn't a picnic.
{1296}{1373}It's not a river-rafting trip either, like|they want you to think on that commercial.
{1375}{1423}- River rafting? - Everybody's|having fun with their herpes out there.
{1425}{1463}- What?|- You know what?
{1465}{1543}"Ix-nay" on the "oodle-day. " That's it.
{1545}{1616}- "Oodle-day"? - You know what I|mean. I don't want you near that...
{1617}{1697}Don't... Just stay away from the whole...
{1741}{1812}- pen... penile area.|- Dad.
{1813}{1869}Don't even see him anymore.|Don't even see him anymore.
{1871}{1931}- That's it. You can't see him anymore.|- Or what?
{1933}{1996}What are you gonna do, ground me?|I'm 22 years old.
{1997}{2060}Oh, really? Well, you're|forgetting you live in my house.
{2061}{2151}Well, trust me.|I'm doing everything I can to change that.
{2405}{2452}- Yeah?|- Yeah.
{2453}{2520}My name's Bill. And I'm a little upset...
{2522}{2579}to say the least, if you know what I mean.
{2613}{2659}Okay.
{2661}{2744}Someone stole two boxes|of my Buckle-O-Bill belt buckles.
{2746}{2798}World renowned, uniquely crafted.
{2800}{2847}Word on the street is|you're trying to sell 'em.
{2849}{2928}You talking about this? This here?
{2929}{3008}No, no, no. I bought this|legit from Gary the Buckle Man.
{3010}{3056}I don't know Gary the Buckle Man!
{3058}{3116}I know you're trying to take|food out of my kid's mouth.
{3117}{3188}I don't even have a kid.|But if I did, you're taking his food!
{3190}{3243}- Uh-uh.|- I want my buckle!
{3245}{3291}- Hey!|- Hey! Hey!
{3293}{3343}I need at least three feet|of personal space here.
{3345}{3404}- It's my buckle!|- I'm gonna paralyze you!
{3457}{3504}Crazy, man.
{3506}{3555}It's my Delaware!
{3557}{3625}Two fingers. Two. That's all it takes.
{3627}{3673}{Y:i}I will call the cops, man!
{3713}{3788}{Y:i}#I don't know #
{3790}{3877}{Y:i}#Where I belong #
{3879}{3957}{Y:i}#And I don't know #
{3959}{4020}{Y:i}#Where I should go #
{4022}{4130}Wait. So, you're gonna be a P.A. now?
{4132}{4196}It's just temporary. Our|neighbor hooked it up.
{4198}{4260}Wait. Rico Suave from across the street?
{4262}{4335}That... That old dude|who wears the low-rise jeans?
{4337}{4420}What? He's 34. He's not that old.
{4422}{4468}Very specific information you have there.
{4559}{4583}Hey.
{4658}{4735}So, uh, tomorrow night?
{4737}{4792}{Y:i}- Yeah? - I wrote|a little "something something" for you.
{4794}{4828}{Y:i}- For me?|- Oh, yeah.
{4830}{4876}{Y:i}- Shut up!|- Yeah, you want a little sneak preview?
{4878}{4968}{Y:i}- Okay.|- Okay.
{4969}{5085}# Ryden is beautiful|It's true #
{5087}{5192}{Y:i}#'Cause she's got eyes ofblue #
{5194}{5316}# But then one day I tried to kiss you #
{5318}{5435}#And you said|Oh, n-n-no #
{5537}{5597}{Y:i}- You're an idiot.|- You love me.
{5599}{5645}Anyway, so here's the deal.
{5647}{5746}{Y:i}Tomorrow night, me, you...
{5788}{5820}that dress.
{5925}{5960}Zip me.
{5962}{6021}Uh, yeah. Um...
{6023}{6116}So, first of all, I'm just gonna rock|the socks off everyone at that show.
{6118}{6207}Second, you're gonna throw your bra onstage,|just scream like a little girl.
{6209}{6272}Um... There.
{6366}{6465}And third,|we're gonna go out to a big, fancy dinner.
{6467}{6517}- Multiple forks... everything.|- We are?
{6519}{6552}- Yeah.|- Why?
{6579}{6680}To, uh, celebrate your new quasi job thing.
{6682}{6742}- Just to celebrate?|- Yeah.
{6744}{6797}- That sounds fun.|- Uh, it sounds...
{6799}{6864}"fan-crapping-tastic,"|is what it sounds like.
{6869}{6932}{Y:i}Making guacamole for your family...
{6934}{6988}{Y:i}orjust for yourself used to be a fight.
{6989}{7105}But now, with the Guacanator...|the Guacanator 3000...
{7107}{7213}{Y:i}making guacamole is as|easy as uno, dos, tres!
{7255}{7393}Senor Avocado... he no stand a chance|against the grips of the Guacanator.
{7486}{7540}The only assault will be|against your taste buds!
{7542}{7597}{Y:i}Got it. Got it. Okay, cut!
{7599}{7661}{Y:i}Okay, I got it. All right.
{7663}{7737}{Y:i}- And we're clear. - This mustache|is crap. The hairs are going in my mouth.
{7739}{7787}- I can swear I swallowed a couple.|- Oh, I'm sorry.
{7789}{7835}We'll take care of that in a sec, all right?
{7837}{7899}{Y:i}- Thanks.|- Okay, everyone, take five.
{7925}{7975}{Y:i}- Take a fiver.|- There she is.
{7977}{8073}- Hey. - How's the first day|going? As shitty as I promised?
{8075}{8153}- It's not so bad.|- Well, just wait.
{8155}{8229}Ah. Psst. Bro. Hey, bro! Yo, dude.
{8231}{8291}Can I talk to you for a second before|you shoot anything else?
{8293}{8339}Well, this should be fun.
{8391}{8448}{Y:i}The script is like a|road map, but the road map...
{8450}{8524}Can you talk to the catering people? The|meat on this sandwich smells like ass-crack.
{8526}{8565}- Oh, okay.|- First of all, you're really close.
{8567}{8654}So, congrats. Bones. Awesome. Sweet.
{8656}{8712}We're getting so close,|but I just wanna go from the top.
{8714}{8776}A couple things to make this double awesome.
{8778}{8860}Give me more Mexican. I gotta get|more Mexican. You know what I mean?
{8862}{8937}I gotta... Oh! I wanna be|on or across the border.
{8939}{9041}You know what I mean? "Mexi-can. " Not|"Mexi-can't" or "Mexi-could. " "Mexi-can. "
{9043}{9121}Like any of that flavor,|literally and figuratively, into it.
{9123}{9153}- Awesome.|- All right.
{9155}{9225}Second of all, your shots are boring, bro.
{9253}{9311}Seriously. Here's an idea.
{9313}{9373}{Y:i}Did you ever see The Matrix?|Movie about, like, alternative reality.
{9375}{9457}{Y:i}Okay, that shot... Keanu's, like, up in|the air... Bam! He's in the air. Freeze.
{9459}{9513}360-degree shot... Bam, bam, bam, bam.
{9515}{9592}Remember what I'm saying? Yeah, like that.|That's exciting. That's awesome.
{9594}{9652}But check this out. Instead of Keanu...
{9653}{9739}it's the Guacanator is up in the air,|and you shoot around it, like, 360, 720.
{9741}{9794}Like, change the axis.|Like, people are totally gonna blow minds.
{9796}{9837}{Y:i}Matrix. That's a great idea. Yeah.
{9839}{9897}- Thank you. I wasn't fishing for that.|I appreciate it. - Maybe while I'm at it...
{9899}{9947}- I could...|- Bring it. Bring it.
{9949}{10044}Maybe we could hoist it up on a cross...
{10046}{10123}{Y:i}and we have The Passion of the Guacamole.
{10125}{10200}Okay. I get it. Do you think that's funny?
{10201}{10264}I think you're an idiot.
{10265}{10312}And I quit.
{10337}{10400}{Y:i}- Told you... Hollywood.|- Can you hear me?
{10401}{10448}- Let's go.|- I think I have the wrong channel.
{10449}{10493}- What?|- Let's go.
{10495}{10548}Hey. Hey, catch.
{10549}{10624}Hey, whatever.|All right, I'm gonna shoot this.
{10625}{10704}{Y:i}Can you put him back in the ring?|I got an idea.
{10705}{10760}{Y:i}- You're fired!|- Thank you!
{10765}{10838}{Y:i}#She don't know who she is #
{10840}{10908}{Y:i}#Oh, I can take her anywhere #
{10909}{10981}For years I had to deal with|this kind of stupidity.
{10983}{11029}Come on. Can you believe it?
{11031}{11123}{Y:i}I mean, you can't imagine how many times|I just wanted to walk off set like that.
{11125}{11219}- My God, I just walked off set.|- Yeah.
{11221}{11282}And it looks like I just lost another job.
{11333}{11399}That feels good. That feels great!
{11401}{11456}{Y:i}#With you eventually #
{11908}{12043}{Y:i}#'Cause I am always where I need to be #
{12045}{12103}{Y:i}#A nd I always thought #
{12105}{12136}Come on.
{12137}{12217}{Y:i}- #I would end up with you eventually #|- Olé! Olé!
{12409}{12470}{Y:i}Can we go? You guys ready?
{12472}{12554}- Where's your guy? Who's your singer?|- Yeah, he's right behind you.
{12556}{12602}Hey, man, you're on.
{12849}{12932}You guys good?
{12934}{13000}So, my name is Adam Davies.
{13001}{13052}I hope this doesn't make|anyone too uncomfortable...
{13053}{13136}but I'm completely naked|under these clothes.
{13138}{13212}This song is for someone...
{13214}{13298}I, um, care about a lot.
{13393}{13424}Ready?
{13818}{13887}# I'm counting the streetlights #
{13913}{13977}# It's all I can do #
{14009}{14085}#While driving myself crazy #
{14087}{14155}#Trying to get to you #
{14193}{14272}# Feels wrong at the right times #
{14274}{14356}{Y:i}#To reveal my hand #
{14388}{14456}# I'm doing the worst I can #
{14458}{14540}#To make you understand #
{14586}{14696}{Y:i}#Maybe one day you will know #
{14761}{14847}# How hard it is for me to #
{14849}{14912}#Show my heart #
{14957}{15004}#With all the love #
{15033}{15104}# Running through my soul #
{15149}{15268}# Maybe one day you will know #
{15372}{15465}You know what I thought when I met you?
{15467}{15513}No.
{15563}{15688}{Y:i}- Aside from the incredible ears,|she's smart and stunning. -
{15690}{15748}- Absolutely stunning.|- Hmm.
{15750}{15796}But there was something else.
{15857}{15925}I just saw a girl that has the whole world|at her fingertips...
{15927}{15984}and she doesn't even know it.

{16178}{16202}www.frendz4m.com
{16995}{17027}Good night.
{17388}{17434}Oh, my God.
{17436}{17522}Oh, I'm such an idiot. I completely forgot.
{17524}{17571}- It's cool.|- Oh, I'm so sorry.
{17601}{17637}How was it?
{17661}{17747}Great. Fine, good... I...
{17749}{17837}And our dinner... I missed our fancy dinner.
{17839}{17935}You're getting overly worked up about this,|Ryden. It's...
{17937}{17984}It's cool.
{17985}{18051}Besides, you were clearly busy with...
{18053}{18100}Pelé from across the street.
{18102}{18162}Oh, no, he... We were at work...
{18164}{18235}- and then there was this big blowup,|so we left, but it was... - Uh-huh.
{18237}{18323}Awesome. I'll see you later.
{18324}{18414}- Wait. What are you doing?|- What does it look like?
{18416}{18469}Just let me explain.
{18522}{18568}What exactly needs explanation?
{18570}{18618}The fact that I've been|waiting around like a moron...
{18620}{18711}hoping that one day you'll actually|feel about me the way I feel about you?
{18712}{18774}Or the fact that you're so obsessed|with your future...
{18776}{18888}that y-you completely forget about everyone|that you're supposed to give a shit about?
{19002}{19111}I'm not waiting anymore. I'm done.
{19212}{19316}I may not know exactly what my future|looks like, but I do know one thing.
{19396}{19443}You're not in it.
{20042}{20090}Oh...
{20224}{20287}...say can and will be used against|you, okay? - I didn't know they were hot.
{20289}{20343}- You have the right to an attorney.|- Bought them on the Internet.
{20344}{20395}Can't afford one, one will|be provided to you by the state.
{20396}{20432}This is so stupid. I can't...
{20453}{20500}Didn't have to be this way.
{20501}{20560}{Y:i}Grab your brother. Get him in the car.
{20562}{20616}Come on, honey.|Come on. Let's go get in the car.
{20618}{20664}I had absolutely nothing to do with this.
{20666}{20743}You can ask anybody,|and they'll tell you. I hate crime.
{20745}{20806}It's okay. It's okay.
{21130}{21203}The good news is your husband|doesn't have any priors.
{21205}{21253}The bad news is we're|gonna have to hold him.
{21255}{21319}Trafficking stolen|property is no small crime.
{21321}{21388}- The bail won't be set till tomorrow.|- You're keeping him overnight?
{21390}{21457}- But he's not a criminal. He's|just a moron. - That's the breaks.
{21506}{21613}I told you. I told you in|1976. Do not marry Walter Malby.
{21615}{21656}{Y:i}He's your son.
{21658}{21720}- And I did the best I could with|what I had. -
{21722}{21833}Yeah, well, your best effort is in jail|till tomorrow morning.
{21835}{21935}Hey. Pick up. I've called you 80 times.|I'm really, really sorry.
{21937}{22019}I... Call me back.
{22020}{22115}Where's Dad? I wanna go home.
{22353}{22400}Try and have a good one, all right?
{22502}{22583}Mrs. Malby? Miss?
{22585}{22630}{Y:i}Yes? Yes?
{22632}{22678}{Y:i}- Hey, morning. How you doing?|- Hi. Morning.
{22680}{22771}{Y:i}Um, so, basically, in order to bail him out,|you're looking at 15,000 bucks.
{22772}{22843}- Oh, my God. What? - Or he stays|in the slammer until the trial.
{22844}{22892}Oh, God.
{22924}{22977}$15,000.
{23058}{23104}Well, let's go home.
{23141}{23187}- Maureen?|- What?
{23189}{23247}Wait.
{23248}{23303}Cough it up.
{23305}{23337}Cough what up?
{23339}{23413}Pay the man your son's bail money.
{23415}{23479}Are you crazy?
{23481}{23556}You think if I had that kind of dough|I'd be living with you?
{23558}{23633}Cut the baloney, Maureen. Please.
{23635}{23744}I know you have money.|I know you sew it into your panty hose.
{23746}{23816}And I know you've got|it under your mattress...
{23817}{23911}{Y:i}and shoved up inside|every shoe in your closet.
{23913}{23960}Pay the man.
{24018}{24121}Why can't my family just|love me for my soul...
{24123}{24216}instead of my meager possessions|and my bank account?
{24217}{24275}Well, I love your soul, Grandma.
{24607}{24707}Okay, um... Will you take a check,|or do you want the green stuff?
{24782}{24830}{Y:i}I'm free!
{24871}{24916}I'm free!
{24966}{25056}Look at the sky.|Can you see how blue the sky is?
{25081}{25156}This entire experience has transformed me.
{25158}{25221}I am a new man. The old Walter is dead.
{25223}{25304}But the new Walter|wants to say how much I love you guys.
{25305}{25357}I'm a new man, and we're a new family.
{25359}{25448}{Y:i}I mean, look,|we have our problems. What family doesn't?
{25450}{25484}I know I get to be bullheaded. And,
{25485}{25569}you know, Ryden here is|essentially unemployable.
{25570}{25600}Hmm?
{25601}{25684}Hunter licks people, and...
{25686}{25780}Grandma's very, very...
{25782}{25828}very... kind.
{25829}{25876}So kind.
{25877}{25987}{Y:i}But, no matter what, we're a family.|We're a real family.
{25988}{26049}We're the Malbys, damn it.
{26081}{26167}From now on, it's Malby time.
{26169}{26268}Malby! Malby! Malby!
{26270}{26339}Malby! Malby! Malby!
{26340}{26410}Malby! Malby! Malby!

{26798}{26855}{Y:i}- Malby!|- Grab my purse.
{26856}{26907}- My purse. - Did you leave it|at the police station, Maureen?
{26909}{26969}{Y:i}- No, I didn't leave... I thought|you had it. -
{26971}{27022}{Y:i}- I don't have your purse.|- Adam?
{27024}{27108}- I'm looking for Ryden Malby.|- That's me.
{27110}{27186}This is Barbara Snaff|from Happerman & Browning.
{27188}{27282}Listen, the position you interviewed for|just came available again.
{27284}{27347}You wanna fire me? Fine. I don't care.
{27348}{27428}I'm gonna own this town. And I'm gonna come|back, and I'm gonna take you down.
{27429}{27492}Wait... Wait, are you serious?|You're offering me the job?
{27494}{27588}Yes. Absolutely. When can you start?|The job is yours if you want it.
{27589}{27652}Immediately! Absolutely, yes.
{27654}{27728}Great. I'll have my assistant call you|with all the details.
{27730}{27782}- Thank you. Perfect.|- She's not there anymore.
{27784}{27851}- Guys, I got the job! I got the job!|- Yea!
{27852}{27936}{Y:i}- Does it pay? Does it pay?|- Yeah, it pays!

{28420}{28495}Okay. Silent treatment. I get it.
{28497}{28588}{Y:i}Very fifth grade of you. But very effective.
{28590}{28686}{Y:i}Please call me. Please?
{29026}{29094}Yo, it's Adam. You know what to do.
{29129}{29176}All right.
