...and bought a marriage license.

514

You didn't sign nothing, did you?

515
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:49,085
l had to. He was making such a fuss

He never even kissed a gal
before he met you.

-l never was good at lying.
-lt ain't that complicated.

629

''The show is gonna start pretty soon.

632
00:52:56,054 --> 00:53:00,052
Then you go to your dressing room
where your suitcase is.

the nicest place in the world!

1061
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:07,274
We're gonna have an angel on it.

1062
01:31:07,537 --> 01:31:10,324
-Here's your map.
-Here's your bag.

1063
01:31:10,582 --> 01:31:15,078
-This old thing!
-l'll show you the way to Montana.

1064
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:20,540
Captain! You got yourself
another passenger!

1065
01:31:20,801 --> 01:31:23,471
-Come on, Virgil.
-Wait a second.

1066
01:31:23,721 --> 01:31:27,090
Come on, we wasted
enough time already.

1067
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:33,471
-What you waiting for?
-You hush for a second! Hear me!

1068
01:31:33,732 --> 01:31:36,899
-Bo, l ain't going.
-You ain't what?

1069
01:31:37,152 --> 01:31:39,560
You don't need me to look after you.

1070
01:31:39,822 --> 01:31:44,151
Fact is, you got someone
you gotta look after.

1071
01:31:44,869 --> 01:31:47,277
Here's your wedding ring.

1072
01:31:49,707 --> 01:31:54,950
Virge, l wish you'd come. l liked you
long before l ever liked Bo.

1073
01:31:55,213 --> 01:31:59,792
-Folks, gotta get rolling.
-The bus can't wait all day.

1074
01:32:00,052 --> 01:32:04,513
Virge! You're my buddy.
l ain't gonna let you go.

1075
01:32:04,724 --> 01:32:08,057
You're coming with us.
We want you to!

1076
01:32:08,311 --> 01:32:11,016
-Bo!
-Let me be. Let me be.

1077
01:32:11,606 --> 01:32:14,691
You can't do it that way. You can't.

1078
01:32:14,901 --> 01:32:18,187
lf he don't wanna come,
you can't make him.

1079
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:28,239
Whatever l got left up there,
the boys can have it.

1080
01:32:39,845 --> 01:32:43,131
-Goodbye, Bo.
-Come on, Cherry, let's make it fast.

1081
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:52,644
Why, you're liable to freeze
to death in that skimpy little thing.

1082
01:33:29,983 --> 01:33:33,482
But what about you?
You need something.

1083
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:43,908
Yippie!

1084
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:47,244
BO:
Uh-oh.

1085
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:02,309
Bye, everybody. Bye!

1086
01:34:02,643 --> 01:34:04,137
Bye.
