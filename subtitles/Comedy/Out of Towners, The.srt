1
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,931
<i>Nancy Clark, report to gate 14.</i>

2
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,728
Alan, they/re boarding in a few minutes.
I'm going to find your mother.

3
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,925
- She doesn't want us to see her crying.
- She'd rather cry in front of strangers?

4
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,082
- Are you sad to see me leave home?
- You're going abroad for the first time.

5
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,083
You might even go to Amsterdam.
And European women are different.

6
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,363
- How do you know?
- James Bond films.

7
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,770
That was so cute!

8
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,128
- Dad was getting worried about you.
- He won't admit he's going to miss you.

9
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,848
I get it out and let it go.
He gets a headache.

10
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,922
- Only because you get it out.
- No, you don't express your feelings.

11
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,401
- Could we not have this moment?
- Sorry.

12
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,729
I've got an international beeper for you.

13
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,927
Press that little button and no matter
where you are, this will ring.

14
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,885
- And then I'll call you.
- if you don't answer, she'll fly over.

15
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,850
<i>Flight 178 to London is now boarding.
Ohio State students, please get ready.</i>

16
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,610
So I guess this is it.

17
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,690
Give your mother a big hug.
She's very fragile today.

18
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,169
Daddy/s a wreck,
so make sure you call him.

19
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,646
You guys take care of each other.

20
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,321
- I thought you were going to lose it.
- I guess I'm stronger than I think.

21
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,606
We have more time to ourselves now.
Just you and me.

22
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,610
Alone in the house.

23
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,166
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

24
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,683
If this interview goes well, we'll move
to New York. We'll have more money.

25
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,161
I don't want any more money.
You've been at Sellinsky for 23 years.

26
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,445
We've lived in Ohio all our lives
and you hate New York.

27
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,964
I did when it was hip to hate New York
but it's not anymore, so I don't hate it.

28
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,290
I'm in advertising. I follow the crowd.

29
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,087
- I guess we could see Susan more.
- She won't speak to me.

30
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,842
Well, you blew up at her because
she has doubts about med school.

31
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,444
I didn't blow up at her.
I merely said I was going to sue her.

32
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,361
- You can't sue her for lost tuition.
- You can now.

33
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,121
There's that precedent now,
Mr Brown versus Muffy, the daughter.

34
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,406
Hang on one second.

35
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,809
Tony, thanks for setting up that
meeting. I'm going. 10 o'clock.

36
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,164
I can't tell Nancy I was fired.

37
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,366
It's very caveman of me,
but that's what I've decided.

38
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,841
Well, you're not Nancy.
I appreciate it. Bye.

39
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,642
There's too much food.

40
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,448
No, I never got enough when Alan
was here. Pass me the potatoes, baby.

41
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,680
Now we can talk.
Before we only talked about the kids.

42
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,568
Now we get to talk about us.
This is a gabfest. Yak, yak, yak.

43
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,964
So

44
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,131
What's going on with you?

45
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,531
I have absolutely no idea what
I'm going to do with the rest of my life.

46
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,883
I won't go with you to New York.

47
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,483
I'd just be tagging along
out of pure panic and insecurity.

48
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,370
It's ironic that as soon as we have time
together, we immediately separate.

49
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,203
But if we force ourselves together
instead of letting it happen naturally, -

50
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,050
- what are we proving?

51
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,769
I don't know what to tell you, baby.

52
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,728
I've got to pack.

53
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,686
Good morning, sir.

54
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,447
<i>Welcome aboard
this flight to New York.</i>

55
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,167
<i>Please fasten your seatbeks</i>

56
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,849
Surprise!

57
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,921
HerlfY-

58
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,681
HerlfY-

59
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,690
Henry!

60
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,843
- Are you excited I came?
- What?

61
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,921
- Are you excited I came?
- I'm very excited.

62
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,529
You don't sound excited, Henry.

63
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,127
- I'm holding it in.
- We're all excited, okay?

64
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,887
- Henry, you forgot your foot chums.
- What?

65
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,002
Could you pass these
to that man, please?

66
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,082
He always forgets this and then he'll
never stop complaining about his rash.

67
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,683
For the next two days it's going to be
scratch, scratch, flake, flake.

68
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,649
- Let them sit together!
- Thanks.

69
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,687
- Here we go.
- Shouldn't we have a little something?

70
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,126
We're going to eat at a great hotel.
Don't ruin it with that mouldy sandwich.

71
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,483
- He's sorry.
- Besides, I'm too nervous.

72
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,684
Why? It's not like you don't have a job.

73
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,683
This is Senior Creative Director.
It's the big time.

74
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,406
You'll be all right, honey.

75
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,683
- Great city.
- All I see is fog.

76
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:08,206
<i>Bad news. New York is fogged in.
We've been diverted to Boston.</i>

77
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,325
I'll see about flights to New York.
I'll meet you at the carousel.

78
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,881
Henry”

79
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,921
Yes, I'm still excited you came.

80
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,846
Bags.

81
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,005
The buses are filled. The next train
to New York leaves in 20 minutes.

82
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,925
- There's a train Where are the bags?
- They didn't come out.

83
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,444
- What do you mean?
- Just that. They didn't come out.

84
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,881
- What?
- Calm down.

85
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,847
I've got to be in New York for the most
important Just give me the check.

86
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,329
- Excuse me! Are there any bags
- Are you crazy?

87
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,128
- I'm Henry Clark from flight 42.
- You're going to get hurt!

88
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,523
That's not our bag.

89
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,046
- Can you describe the bags?
- Two brown and three blue ones.

90
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,084
Many bags look alike.
In most cases, -

91
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,126
- specific descriptions lead
to apprehending the suspect.

92
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,847
- My bags aren't murderers, they/re lost.
- Look at this.

93
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,291
- It looks something like that.
- The 24 or the 26-inch model?

94
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,520
- Gee, I forgot to measure my bags.
- It looks a little like this.

95
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,045
- It's kind of rough, but close enough.
- Wow, are you an artist?

96
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,802
- I used to be in advertising with him.
- This is a fantastic drawing.

97
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,848
Unfortunately, we don't have it.
Where will you be staying in Boston?

98
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,724
In Boston we'll be staying in New York!

99
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,609
Calm down, there are plenty of cabs.

100
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,647
- I'm dizzy from not eating.
- There's plenty of food on the train.

101
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,926
- Just go with the flow.
- You're right, I'm going to calm down.

102
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,485
Thank you.

103
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,402
What's that taste?
Did you have peanut butter'?

104
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,606
- You usually don't taste like that.
- Right, I'm throwing away that lipstick.

105
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,451
You had peanut butter.
Yes, you did.

106
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,851
All right, I confess.
I went to the vending machine.

107
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,763
I put my 75 cents into the machine
and ate them all.

108
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,725
How many were there?
Two? And I'm dizzy!

109
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,211
- Sorry. It doesn't mean I don't love you.
- Look, are we going anywhere?

110
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,802
I thought we were moving.
We have 10 minutes to catch a train!

111
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,966
Did we miss it?

112
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,291
- The 3:38 to New York? We missed it.
- This can't be happening!

113
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,801
They/ll understand.

114
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,404
They won't employ a man who can't
get from Ohio to New York in 24 hours!

115
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,640
That would only matter if you wanted
to be a messenger, maybe.

116
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,526
- Do I have time to go to the bathroom?
- All the time in the world.

117
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,281
- We'll get the next train.
- No, we'll rent a car.

118
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,529
They don't leave without you
and they don't get diverted to Boston.

119
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,361
Whatever Five minutes.

120
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,530
Excuse me.

121
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,490
<i>The 3:38 Metrofiner to New York
is now leaving on track 12.</i>

122
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,206
<i>AH aboard.</i>

123
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,324
Nancy

124
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,729
EXCLISG me excuse me.

125
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,289
- Where is the ladies' room?
- You mean the men's room.

126
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,044
- Over there.
- Nancy, we can still make the train!

127
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,164
Go and get my wife, please.

128
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,968
Brown coat, blue dress,
blonde hair. Thanks!

129
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,131
- I got lost.
- We can still make the train.

130
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,041
We don't have time.
It leaves in two minutes!

131
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,368
She wouldn't come out.

132
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,964
This way!

133
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,328
- I'll run on ahead.
- I can't in these heels.

134
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,164
- Oh, my God.
- Hold it!

135
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,122
- On a full bladder. I made it.
- I forgive you the peanut butter.

136
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,129
Let's get a seat.

137
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,801
- Is this the 3:38 to New York?
- No, that is.

138
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,803
No rental cars. We've got to find a car.

139
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,007
But we have to be nice, Henry.
The guy at Avis didn't like you much.

140
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,921
- Can I help you?
- Yes, but first, how are you?

141
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,010
- We'd like to rent a car.
- Compact, midsize or luxury?

142
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,521
Compact.

143
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,883
- Actually, we're all out of compacts.
- Oh. Midsize would be fine.

144
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,483
Oops, all we have is
one luxury sedan.

145
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,088
- I'm not sure why you asked, then
- We'll take a luxury sedan.

146
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,647
Sounds good.

147
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,289
They should change their sign
to "we have car".

148
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,847
Your credit card, please.

149
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,171
The car is state-of-the-art,
it drives itself. Collision insurance?

150
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,490
If it drives itself and we have
an accident, it'll be the car's fault.

151
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:35,130
- Boy, it's hot in here.
- It doesn't say how to shut the heat off.

152
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:41,089
- I'm melting out of my dress.
- There's no disengage switch.

153
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,322
- It's 1000 degrees in here.
- It's freezing. Put that up!

154
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,088
- Henry, are we in a rut?
- I might be, but we're not.

155
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:14,162
- Why are you in a rut?
- Same thing every day. That's a rut.

156
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,685
I'm in more of a rut than you are.
Ever since Alan's been gone, -

157
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,726
- every morning I wake up
and I don't know what to do.

158
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:30,041
- It's been one morning.
- Well, I didn't say a long rut.

159
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,771
- So we're both in a rut.
- Separately. We aren't in a rut.

160
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,364
- If we were in a rut, that would be
- That would be a real rut, Henry.

161
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,371
There's a fork. Which way do I go?

162
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,087
Does it say
"Cross Bronx Expressway'?

163
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,009
Yes, Ma'am!

164
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,601
- Go past that
- What?

165
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:07,410
- Over the bridge and into Manhattan.
- I already made the turn.

166
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,241
- I didn't tell you to turn.
- You implied it.

167
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,049
- How can you imply a turn?
- You know how to imply a turn.

168
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:24,442
- Is that a map in front of you, or what?
- I'm not a cartographer, but I think so.

169
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,610
It's got lots of squiggly lines on it, see?

170
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,205
That's not funny!

171
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,929
- Just stay to the right.
- Why not use the navigation system?

172
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,923
Just go across the bridge, onto FDR,
and we're in the heart of Manhattan.

173
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,925
Is that New York City back there?

174
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,001
- Oh no, this is the wrong bridge!
- This map is

175
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,926
- <i>Proceed down Grand Street.</i>
- <i>"Proceed</i> down Grand <i>Street"!</i>

176
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,125
Don't feel bad. He's obviously
been here before and knows the city.

177
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,406
- The way in just confused me.
- He is not confused.

178
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,484
- What's that?
- French. Don't press it.

179
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,048
Why? I don't understand it.

180
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,090
- What?
- It's Chinese. Find Spanish.

181
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,923
I don't know how to work it.

182
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,964
- I'll press that.
- Do something!

183
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,686
<i>Nancy, Achtung!</i> Turn!

184
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,609
Nancy, it's fish!

185
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,204
Put on the brake!

186
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,884
- Hows your nose?
- Tender to the touch. Just like me.

187
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,846
- What's the bill?
- 2,200 dollars.

188
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,249
We could have bought a car for that!

189
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,570
- Look at New York.
- Where?

190
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,926
- How do we get to the hotel?
- The streets here are like a rigid grid.

191
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,682
- Like somebody else I know.
- Do you want to get there or not?

192
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,523
We follow the grid to Park Avenue
and 64th Street. Now we're at

193
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,044
Don't look at the signs. People
will know you're from out of town.

194
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,646
New Yorkers never stroll. They always
have somewhere important to go.

195
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,889
It's got to be like

196
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:10,050
Go ahead and make fun. But if you
walk like a tourist, you get in trouble.

197
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,040
- I'm having Eggs Benedict.
- I'm having chicken.

198
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,325
I'm terribly sorry to disturb you.

199
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,163
I just left all my money in a cab.
I'm late for my play at Broadway.

200
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,888
- Could I borrow $5 for a taxi ...?
- You expect us to believe this?

201
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,763
- No. I'm sorry to have bothered you.
- What play?

202
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,887
A revival of “Jesus Christ Superstar"
at the Broadhurst Theatre.

203
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,687
- “Jesus Christ Superstar"?
- Are you Andrew Lloyd VVebber'?

204
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,806
Yes. We go into previews next week

205
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,121
- We love “Jesus Christ Superstar".
- And "Evita". That was so great.

206
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,800
And "Cats".

207
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,723
- It hit so home for us.
- We lost a cat that year. It didn't sing.

208
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:12,290
- Henry Clark. This is my wife, Nancy.
- We'd be glad to lend you anything.

209
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,326
Don't take out an open wallet
in the city.

210
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,527
I entered "Yokelville"!
Come here. I'm so embarrassed.

211
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,090
When we tell the people in Ohio that
we lent Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber

212
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,284
- No, I think he's a Lord.
- Do you know Paul McCartney?

213
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,051
- Shut up.
- What's he like?

214
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,285
- Jesus!
- Give me that. And the bag.

215
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,607
Oh, my God!
Why are you doing this?

216
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,087
Every show you do is a hit!

217
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,521
- Andrew Lloyd Webber stole my purse!
- He's just a common criminal.

218
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,169
I have jelly legs.
What are we going to do?

219
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,681
Okay, watch.

220
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,607
I hid my credit card here on the plane.

221
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,647
You're a genius! Put it away!
We might run into Stephen Sondheim.

222
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,729
Hello.

223
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,041
- Thank God.
- Look at this place.

224
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,647
It's good to be inside.

225
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,368
Is that a new haircut? You'd
better stay in the back for a while.

226
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,200
Welcome to the Grand Mark Hotel.
How may I be of service to you?

227
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:55,362
- We have a reservation. Clark.
- I'm Mersault, the manager.

228
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,361
If there's anything I can do,
please let me know.

229
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,484
- That would be room service.
- We're starving.

230
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,004
I'll send a complimentary basket of fruit,
cheese and a fine Merlot to your room.

231
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:16,400
If I could just have your credit card,
we'll have you up to your

232
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,001
room in a jiffy.

233
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,727
- Our flight was rerouted.
- To Boston.

234
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,764
And we were mugged
by Andrew Lloyd Webber.

235
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:32,411
I'll mention it next time he stays here.
Perhaps he's stressed. Ah, a message.

236
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,122
'We have located your luggage
and will deliver it this evening."

237
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:49,442
- At last some good news.
- We have a problem with your card.

238
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,407
- What kind of problem?
- A financial one, I assume.

239
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,648
Yes, this is Henry

240
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,646
I've never had a problem
with my credit card? Have I?

241
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,083
No, I've never purchased anything
at Uncle's Stereo in Manhattan.

242
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,491
800 dollars at "Sofas U Love"?
Susan Clark is my daughter.

243
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,082
She's how much overdue?

244
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,561
I understand. Thank you.

245
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,806
Nancy, you won't believe this. Susan
has stolen one of our credit cards.

246
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,324
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to call and scream at her.

247
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,644
- May I borrow your phone?
- There's a payphone down the street.

248
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:47,167
Henry, promise me not to lose it.
She couldn't stay in the dorms -

249
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,648
- when she decided to become an
actress, so she needed an apartment.

250
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,051
- That's why I gave her the credit card.
- Now I'm mad at both of you.

251
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,009
- I was just trying to protect you.
- She dropped out and you didn't say?

252
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,486
I'm not a child

253
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,127
As you can't pay with your card,
I can't offer you a room.

254
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:15,487
- Do come back when you have money.
- Please. Can't you just trust us?

255
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,163
- Are you throwing us out?
- No, security will do that.

256
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,851
I don't believe this!

257
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,203
- What now'?
- We're going to Susan's.

258
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,201
- It took courage to drop out.
- That's easy with Daddy/s credit card!

259
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,325
- It took passion, don't you understand?
- I'm filled with passion.

260
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,287
When I wanted to be a writer,
my father went berserk.

261
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,646
- But I went and discussed it with him.
- So let's discuss it with Susan.

262
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,084
Somehow I'm not in the mood
to see her new furniture right now.

263
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:01,607
- You'll have to work it outwith her.
- She threw away 50,000 in tuition!

264
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,682
- You don't do it like that in Ohio.
- This is New York.

265
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,805
We're hungry and homeless, just like
my parents said I'd be with you!

266
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,367
I'm going!

267
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,842
What am I supposed to do?

268
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,691
All right, I'll follow you there,
but then I'm leaving.

269
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,483
Why are you so judgmental?
She might be a wonderful actress.

270
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,686
- You'll be proud to hear she's writing.
- I was worried there for a minute.

271
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,202
But if she's going to act <i>and</i> write

272
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,885
Here it is, 148.

273
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,482
- Clark-Guerrero.
- Who's Guerrero?

274
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,526
You don't know or you won't tell me?
We've established there's a difference.

275
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,369
- Where is she?
- Probably stuck in her new sofa.

276
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,328
- Come on.
- I'm going to stay here and be difficult.

277
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,010
Go for it!

278
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,243
Susan?

279
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,844
I'll write her a note.

280
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,206
- Don't touch our paper.
- I was just taking a little sliver off.

281
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,689
- To write a note to my daughter in 2B.
- We don't know the girl in 2B.

282
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,770
- Who are you?
- Ask her if she's got ID.

283
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,088
- I don't.
- A key?

284
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,760
- No.
- Ask her how she got in.

285
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,124
- Ask her to stop asking me questions.
- Don't let her go!

286
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,769
Hold the lunatics' convention
somewhere else. I'm working here.

287
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,726
- She stole our paper.
- I came to see my daughter.

288
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,927
- Susan? Sweet girl.
- You know Susan professionally?

289
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:56,162
- I hope not, because she is sick.
- You break that rack, you buy it!

290
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:02,447
- It was really nice meeting you.
- Don't move, or I'll set Corky on you.

291
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,851
I'm really tired of this repartee.
If you think I'm afraid of your dog

292
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,485
- You make an excellent point.
- She wasn't home!

293
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,971
Nancy?

294
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,403
Oh, my God!

295
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,170
Nancy!

296
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,365
Throw it.

297
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,121
Good hands, babe!

298
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,323
All they care about is food.

299
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,488
Make way! Make way!

300
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,723
- Incoming.
- Croissants.

301
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,844
- Bear claws.
- Sticky buns.

302
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,001
- There's no eating before the meeting.
- Nice to see some new faces.

303
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,488
It's a great group. Let's begin.

304
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:32,726
I'd like to welcome our new members.
Please introduce yourselves.

305
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:39,644
- My name is Nancy and this is Henry.
- Hi, Nancy and Henry. Welcome.

306
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,730
Last week we discussed
Edward's problem. Edward?

307
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,365
I'd like to start off by saying how
much your support has meant to me.

308
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,246
As you know
I've masturbated up to 17 times a day.

309
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,402
- We have to go.
- You're giving him a negative message.

310
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,763
- Yes?
- Sit down, please.

311
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,364
- Let's not send a negative message.
- Not too close.

312
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,771
- How was last week for you?
- Really wonderful.

313
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,364
I've tried to translate the sexual
impulse into other forms of expression.

314
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,849
Working out, going to movies,
calling friends.

315
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,602
Trying to integrate the urge
into a more well-rounded lifestyle.

316
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,566
That's about all.

317
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,643
Sheena, were you able to cut down
on your random sexual encounters?

318
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,767
- I've had the flu, so just my doctor.
- Single digits, that's great.

319
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,966
- Let's hear from the new people.
- We got in here by a mistake.

320
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,927
We came in to worship
and this is the wrong denomination.

321
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:07,765
- We don't even have sex that much.
- So your problem is lack of sex.

322
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:14,684
In Ohio we don't discuss sex in public.
It's sort of our state motto.

323
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,168
That's part of the problem.
We don't discuss it.

324
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,887
- We're from Ohio!
- We don't do it much anymore.

325
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,281
- And when you do, it's a routine.
- Yes! It's like we're two dead people.

326
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,327
- Nancy! Ohio!
- It's not so much the absence of it.

327
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,730
It's that you've accepted the lack
of physical and emotional intimacy.

328
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,811
If this keeps up,
I'm sleeping with someone.

329
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,360
- Try tying each other up with bamboo.
- Actually, we use The Club. Okay

330
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,363
- Discussing it may solve the problem.
- But I don't have a problem.

331
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,211
I enjoy sex as much as the next guy.

332
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,362
We haven't done it in over two months.

333
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:09,801
- Clearly you have a problem.
- Okay, I've been a little tense lately.

334
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,721
- What have you been tense about?
- What have I been tense about?

335
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,769
I've been tense. Why?
Don't I have the right to be tense?

336
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,329
Would you like to share with the group
why you feel tense?

337
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,763
Yes, I'd love to share this
with the group.

338
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,091
I was fired. I got fired!

339
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,411
I got fired. This was the only interview
I could get because I'm 106 years old!

340
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,084
- How could you not tell me?
- I went here to get a job and lied to you.

341
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,080
- This just creates more tension!
- I would love to sleep with you, Henry.

342
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,730
- I find failure just as erotic as success.
- Shut up, Sheena!

343
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,050
I'm sorry we ruined your meeting
and hope you'll all stop having sex.

344
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,250
You were fired?

345
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,162
And the first time I hear it
is in front of a bunch of perverts?

346
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,648
- How could you not tell me?
- You lied about Susan.

347
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:24,007
- It was an accumulation of half-truths.
- Okay, then mine was a spin.

348
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:30,651
I could've helped you.
I know a little bit about advertising!

349
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:38,122
- I was ashamed.
- You should be ashamed of lying to me.

350
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,449
What kind of marriage do we have?

351
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,043
The kind where I don't say I was fired
and you don't say Susan is embezzling.

352
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,202
- It's very common.
- Did they just fire you after 23 years?

353
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,766
They're dismissing all the older guys.
We're not "cutting edge" anymore.

354
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,531
But you were never cutting edge!

355
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,006
That's what I told them!

356
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,888
Let's forget about them.
This is a whole new start for you.

357
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,210
I won't get this job without a shave,
a clean suit and a good night's sleep.

358
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,644
- Tomorrow I'll look like Keith Richards.
- Don't give up.

359
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:23,803
Giving up is when you can still get the
job and give up. I don't have that option.

360
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,971
This is a test.

361
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,562
Here we are in the middle of our lives,
and we have to make a choice.

362
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,529
- Are we to slowly die or embrace life?
- Slowly die?

363
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,887
No, embrace life!
I want to live and feel useful.

364
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:49,803
I want to explore and experience.
I want to suck the marrow out of life.

365
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,801
- What do you want?
- I do want to do some marrow sucking.

366
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,202
But otherwise I just want to read
and fix those broken kitchen cabinets.

367
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,329
That's it? You just want to read
and fix things for the rest of your life?

368
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,889
How do I fit into that plan? All you need
is a good light and a hammer.

369
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:21,645
- Maybe we have different plans.
- Come on. Think!

370
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,366
There must be something.

371
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,642
I'd like to get some food.

372
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,969
We don't have our bags or money.

373
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,482
The bags!
Remember when we went to Freeport?

374
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,001
I know we can't eat the bags.

375
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,411
I put the travellers' cheques in the bag.
Let's go back to the hotel.

376
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,401
- You left them in the bag? How much?
- 600 dollars. I'm guessing.

377
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,570
It's not earning interest in the bag.

378
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,770
There he is.

379
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,526
- We're back.
- Mr and Mrs Clark, the sequel.

380
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,042
- Did our luggage arrive yet?
- No.

381
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,767
- But give me the name of your hostel.
- Very funny.

382
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,090
- But how very nice to see you.
- Thank you.

383
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,604
- How was Monte Carlo?
- It would not stop raining.

384
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,247
The doorman did not help
Mrs Wellstone out of the car.

385
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,684
He was helping some large woman
with a crated animal.

386
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,649
- I'll have all three of them removed.
- That's the kind of service I expect.

387
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,367
That's the kind you'll receive from me.

388
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,441
- Maybe you two should get a room.
- I'm here to serve.

389
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,488
- Is there anything I can get you?
- Just make sure it doesn't rain.

390
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,402
I'll speak to housekeeping.
I just love those shoes.

391
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,881
Don't break my heart and tell me
they/re not real leopard.

392
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,402
Off we go.

393
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:17,249
- Henry, look.
- I think they have trail mix.

394
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,570
- Buffet time, honey.
- Order me a peanut.

395
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,923
Thank you.

396
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,967
Special diet?

397
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,409
- Could I get you something to drink?
- I wouldn't want to impose.

398
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,001
- Are you sure?
- Champagne.

399
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,645
- Champagne for the lady.
- Thank you.

400
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,968
Could I have some of those cherries?
No, the whole thing.

401
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,409
I'm Greg from LA. I'm an agent.

402
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:16,403
I'm checking out an Irish playwright
for a sit-com that I packaged.

403
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:22,164
I've got an extra ticket and a limo
if you'd be interested.

404
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,682
- Are you staying in the hotel?
- Suite, 14th floor.

405
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,408
- Are you alone?
- Just me and my expense account.

406
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,601
- You're funny.
- Hey, baby.

407
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,122
Shut up! What are you? 106?

408
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,046
Let's move to a table.
It won't be so noisy.

409
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,929
- Do you come here often?
- Only when my husband works late.

410
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:09,321
- You're married? Oh, I never would
- I think my husband's having an affair.

411
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,569
- Really?
- I wish he'd stay out more often.

412
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:21,846
Don't think I'm one of those yuppies that
blows in for a meeting and a good time.

413
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,601
- But if you want to get together
- Give me the key to your room.

414
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,007
- What?
- You know what we're talking about.

415
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,690
- Might I speak to you for a moment?
- No! Creep!

416
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,683
I'm talking to this gentleman. Stop
harassing me or I'll call the manager.

417
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,202
Go away! Just go!

418
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,721
Sick. A guy that age hitting on you.

419
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,084
I have to leave.
My adult diapers are bunching up.

420
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,889
He chats me up every night.
It's pathetic.

421
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:08,450
So, Greg ls what I think is going
to happen going to happen?

422
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,522
- You're in for the wildest night.
- I'll be back around 10:30.

423
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,609
I'll be waiting in your room.

424
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,688
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

425
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,486
Too bad, Greg.

426
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,371
You don't know what you'll be missing.

427
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,085
My room number's 1402.
I'll see you there around 10:30?

428
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,604
- I don't even know your name.
- Mrs Robinson.

429
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,806
Mrs Robinson. That's sexy.
Nice to meet you, Mrs Robinson.

430
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,002
See you later.

431
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,410
We'll have the lobster, the
grilled salmon and the creme brulée.

432
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:13,290
Throw in a couple of steaks and salad.
We need this as soon as possible.

433
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,647
- You were really something at the bar.
- This will be the best meal of our life!

434
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:25,324
You were so animalistic,
so hedonistic, so naughty.

435
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,923
- Fries! We didn't order any.
- Like some cheap, tawdry sex machine.

436
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,766
Mrs Robinson, are you in there?

437
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,047
- It's your agent. I want to see you.
- I'll be right there Greg.

438
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,040
I'm timing you
on a very expensive watch.

439
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:53,691
- You have to hide. It's his room.
- I am your husband!

440
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,008
All right, here!

441
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,604
- Just scoot under the bed.
- It's too small. Get some camouflage.

442
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,523
- Mrs Robinson.
- Can you see me?

443
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,770
- Pull me out.
- 30 seconds.

444
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,006
Now don't you let him, you know.
And whatever you do, don't you

445
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,521
I won't. Just shut up!

446
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,561
- Hi.
- Hi.

447
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,923
- You're still here.
- Why wouldn't I be?

448
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,886
Some women might
find this intimidating.

449
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,041
I find it dangerous
in an erotic sense.

450
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:50,211
- I love the way you put words together.
- I've always been good with my mouth.

451
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,246
My lucky day-

452
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,121
- I didn't expect you back so soon.
- I forgot my cell phone.

453
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,405
- Can't be without it.
- You must be a very important person.

454
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:16,165
Maybe later I'll show you my phone list.
Like that? I didn't do anything.

455
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,570
- How about a little sample?
- Good things happen to those who wait.

456
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,810
- I have a surprise for you later.
- Give me a hint.

457
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,243
You'd better bring a fire extinguisher.

458
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,404
Don't start now.
If you do, I'll never stop.

459
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,210
- "Don't start. I won't be able to stop"?
- I had to think of something.

460
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,725
- Who's that fol'?
- 1402.

461
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,206
I'm 1402.

462
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,762
- I think you're enjoying this.
- Maybe I am.

463
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,124
- When I'm hungry I'll seduce anyone.
- That's comforting.

464
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,568
Did you order this?
What's he doing here?

465
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,369
- He's my husband. Mr Robinson.
- How dare you? She's twice your age!

466
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,851
- Is this for three or two?
- I'm not paying. I'm calling the police.

467
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,402
Go! Get security!

468
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,967
What are we going to do?

469
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,291
Lots of people seduce guests to get
a free meal and have sex in their suite.

470
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,611
Be careful.

471
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,922
- Shit!
- Henry!

472
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,805
Come here!

473
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,083
- I think we can make it to the balcony.
- I think we can make it to the street!

474
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,409
- Just climb down.
- Are you insane?

475
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,689
- Watch.
- Nancy!

476
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,201
You're going to kill yourself!

477
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,850
They were in that room.

478
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,329
This woman begs to be let inside.
I'm not a guy that turns someone away.

479
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,724
I'm having you checked for testicles!

480
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,086
If anything is gone, I am suing. No one
from LA will ever stay here again.

481
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,087
You can do it, honey.

482
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,965
Here we go, baby.

483
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,527
Step by Step-

484
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,970
I'd know if I was trying
to seduce someone.

485
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,643
- Sign this, please.
- What is it like to be so stupid?

486
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,209
- Don't be scared, sweetie.
- I do this all the time.

487
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,682
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

488
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,363
Mersault is dancing in ladies' clothes
to "Bad Girls".

489
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,246
I won't get into heaven if that's
the last thing I see before I die.

490
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,442
- Hurry, you have to see this.
- Here I come.

491
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,930
- Come here. Swing to me, honey.
- I'd love to.

492
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,168
- Give me your foot.
- I'm trying.

493
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,650
Give me your coat I've got it!

494
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,651
Come on.

495
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,211
What the bloody hell is going on?

496
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,291
<i>Where's the manager?</i>

497
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,280
Can't I have a moment's peace?
I'm coming!

498
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,369
Shut up!

499
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,530
All right,
don't get your knickers in a twist.

500
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,925
Can't a girl have some fun?

501
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,367
I could have danced all night.

502
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,804
Let's go.

503
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,402
You're the manager, right?
Hello, you checked me in!

504
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,207
Norman Bates could do a better job
of running this hotel than you could.

505
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,486
Scam artists waltz into people's rooms,
morons deliver room service.

506
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:43,130
And you can't even keep the lights on!
I am an unsatisfied customer.

507
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,086
- So you'd better deal with me.
- Shut up.

508
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,362
Silly bitch.

509
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:59,363
Walk normally, don't run. Taxi!

510
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,485
- We don't have any money.
- I took $20 from the Wellstones' room.

511
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,131
- Who are you?
- There's a taxi.

512
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,967
- Are we lucky we found you.
- 2nd Avenue and Saint Mark's Place.

513
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,482
- That's Susan's apartment.
- Get out.

514
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,650
- Get out of the cab now.
- We're not getting out.

515
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:42,244
He has to take us anywhere and
we're entitled to an incense-free ride.

516
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:47,651
- For the last time, get out!
- We may be out-of-towners from Ohio.

517
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,811
But I know my rights. I'm writing down
your name and license number.

518
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,049
- Hortense Wilson
- Hortense?

519
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,888
- What's that?
- Go, go, go!

520
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,448
- What's this?
- They wouldn't get out.

521
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,488
- Yes, just drop us off over there
- Shut up!

522
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,046
Let us out and we won't bear witness.
Tell them we will not bear witness.

523
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,642
- We don't know how to bear witness.
- Shut up!

524
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,610
<i>' L</i> QOt it!
_ .
<i>Y</i> QOt the gum

525
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,211
Out, Nancy!

526
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,971
Jump!

527
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:47,482
- Are you okay?
- Let me catch my breath.

528
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,446
- I'm shaking!
- Do you believe this?

529
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,443
My God, you're so brave.
You're a hero. You saved our lives.

530
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:03,283
- Maybe just a little bit.
- I saw my life flash before my eyes.

531
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,245
All I could think of was,
I'll never see my children again!

532
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,804
- Did you think about me at all?
- There was so little time.

533
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,800
Your whole life passed before
your eyes, and I wasn't even in it?

534
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,485
Don't be so sensitive. Of course
I think about my kids. They need me.

535
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,082
- I'm all they've got.
- Am I the anonymous sperm donor'?

536
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,488
- You might as well be.
- What do you mean?

537
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,287
Look at the way you're treating Susan.

538
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:43,647
We must think about each other more
because the kids are gone.

539
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,526
- We're all we have.
- You make that sound appealing.

540
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:53,409
Unless we find some common ground,
we are going to

541
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,570
What? We're going to get a divorce?

542
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:04,008
Let go. Get over this fear of not
being able to play mommy anymore.

543
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,405
- I want a divorce.
- That's ridiculous.

544
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:15,447
I am ridiculous.
That's what you used to like about me.

545
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,043
But you've become insensitive
and set in your ways -

546
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,210
- and after 27 years, I've had enough!

547
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,725
You have really been mistreated!

548
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,960
Other husbands get drunk
and have sex with 18-year-olds.

549
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:45,806
But your husband is a little boring
and insensitive. Big deal!

550
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,924
I don't know how you put up with it,
Madame Bovary!

551
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,604
There you are.

552
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,041
<i>Hen“;</i>

553
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,844
I'm sorry, honey.

554
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,527
- How did we get here?
- We just got older, that's all.

555
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,169
- I don't mind getting older.
- Neither do I.

556
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,931
I don't want to be 17 again.

557
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:42,685
No, that notion that when
you're younger everything is perfect

558
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:49,444
- I wouldn't mind feeling like I'm 17.
- I wouldn't either.

559
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,926
How do we do that?

560
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:09,250
When we were younger,
this would have been an adventure.

561
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:15,846
We used to have fun.
Remember your grandfather's house?

562
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:24,084
- We made love all night in that motel.
- And you killed my grandfather.

563
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,001
You can't wear that outfit around a man
without a single open artery.

564
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,967
The tight black pants
with the daffodil patch.

565
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:38,644
- You remember that? What else?
- The blouse with that big heart thing.

566
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,446
- You looked like a hospital patient.
- That's sexy.

567
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,569
Where are we?

568
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,728
There's nobody here.

569
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,603
You look so sexy right now.

570
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,202
It's that rolling-out-of-a-cab look
you like.

571
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,971
You smell sexy.

572
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,927
- Henry, I hear music.
- A kiss will do that.

573
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:35,528
Thank you. And now the Mayor
of New York, Rudy Giuliani.

574
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,047
This evening would not be possible -

575
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,881
- without the generosity
of Mrs Florence Needleman -

576
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:53,324
- who, as part of our Light Up The City
campaign, has dedicated the park -

577
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,683
- in loving memory
of her husband Manny.

578
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,406
Manny and I shared some of our
loveliest memories in Central Park.

579
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,126
He would be happy to know -

580
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:17,281
- we have returned the park to the good,
law-abiding citizens of New York.

581
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,884
He'd be pleased with the new
monument that has been erected.

582
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,686
So let's get to it.

583
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,847
Henry!

584
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,404
Come on, baby.

585
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,164
- This is so embarrassing.
- This way!

586
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,442
They're after us!

587
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,689
Public fornication
won't look good on my resumé.

588
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,566
I've got grass in my ass!

589
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,250
Faster!

590
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,082
<i>We're pursuing two white suspects,
male and female, partially clothed.</i>

591
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,609
- I think we lost them.
- Over here. Are we nuts?

592
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:28,170
- We just got lost in our essence.
- We'll have to lay low for a while.

593
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:34,049
- I never thought I'd say that.
- Get down, sweetie.

594
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,449
Let's just stay here for a few minutes.

595
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:45,331
- Want a mint? I stole that, too.
- From the Wellstones.

596
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,686
- From their pillows.
- You should've stolen the pillows, too.

597
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,764
I'm glad we finally got
more time for ourselves.

598
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,284
- When is your interview tomorrow?
- Ten.

599
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,963
- Hold it!
- This is not what it looks like.

600
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,164
Public exposure is what it looks like.
Come on.

601
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:54,691
- Nancy.
- Call it what you like, but zip up.

602
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,171
- Nancy!
- Henry?

603
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:09,331
Call Dun and Bradley Advertising.
I have an interview there this morning.

604
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:14,242
I'm not a degenerate and I don't
deserve to be locked up with

605
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,728
without medical attention.
My neck is sprained.

606
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,730
We'll straighten that out for you.

607
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:30,843
This is Sergeant Jordan at the Desk.
Where is your commanding officei'?

608
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:35,125
On lunch break? Great.
You sure do have long lunch breaks.

609
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:43,049
Anyway, the woman's name is
Florence Klein, 585 Beck Avenue.

610
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:48,201
Hello ...
I have a little problem.

611
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,770
My husband has a job interview soon
and I need to call and arrange bail.

612
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:59,763
- The public phones are down there.
- That will take too long.

613
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:05,046
- I promise to call collect
- Lady, give me a break.

614
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,400
Give you a break?

615
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,241
Give you a break?
Hey! Let me share something with you.

616
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,800
In the last 24 hours I've been rerouted,
mugged, evicted, chased by a dog, -

617
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,971
- kidnapped, and seen in
a compromising position by the Mayor.

618
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,449
My daughter is spending all our money
and my husband has no job.

619
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,328
I'm angry, tired, hungry,
and I'm running with the wolves!

620
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,048
I am one crazy bitch from Ohio,
so why don't you give me a break!

621
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,608
Do I dial 9 to get out?

622
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:55,126
- I've got an important meeting
- Why all the noise? Forget it.

623
01:03:55,320 --> 01:04:00,531
- Your screaming gives me a headache.
- I've got one.

624
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:05,931
Take an aspirin.
Anything to shut your mouth up.

625
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:15,726
- Nobody home?
- No. I don't know anybody else here.

626
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,925
Can't your hotel give you a loan?

627
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,442
The manager threw us out. He hates us.
He wouldn't even

628
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,768
You saw the "Do Not Disturb" sign -

629
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,806
- and knocked to see
if it was supposed to be there.

630
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,449
- I have a call for you.
- I'll explain the rest of your life later.

631
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,611
- Thank you. Good morning.
- Mr Mersault?

632
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:52,489
This is Nancy Clark from Ohio. You
threw us out last night. How are you?

633
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:59,131
Nice of you to stay in touch. I wish all
our freeloaders were as conscientious.

634
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:03,564
- I need you to do me a favour.
- Let me <i>explain.</i>

635
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:09,881
If you are a paying guest, I fawn,
I grovel, I am your very plaything.

636
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,607
If you are not a guest,
you do not exist.

637
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,566
- You'll speak to me.
- Why?

638
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:24,291
Last night you looked so fabulous
in that wonderful full-length sable coat.

639
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,442
<i>- And those stiletto heels were </i>
- <i>Go</i> away.

640
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:36,090
- Yes?
- I have never seen a man kick so high.

641
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:41,127
In jail you can do your little act
for all the prisoners. They/ll love it!

642
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:47,202
I had an intuition you'd be good
at blackmail. How may I be of service?

643
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,122
I need bail money at the 15th Precinct,
and bring some muffins.

644
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,209
But of course. Muffins

645
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:03,131
The Presidential Suite is free of charge
as is the limo, or “getaway car...

646
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:10,090
But first, please sign this document
agreeing never to reveal the incident, -

647
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:14,524
- where I was in fact rehearsing
for the hotel employees' Follies.

648
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:22,170
- Very good.
- You look great. Really.

649
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,921
- Doesn't she look great?
- Well, I wouldn't mind the blouse.

650
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:31,729
- Not the blouse. She's got a great ass.
- Henry!

651
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:37,131
It's always there for me.
It's a Wellspring of joy.

652
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,005
- What do you think?
- It's private.

653
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:45,684
- Everybody wants to talk about it.
- What is wrong with you?

654
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,488
Nothing.
I just feel frisky, that's all.

655
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:58,210
- You feel frisky? Say the word.
- Frisky.

656
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,689
Say "frisky" again.
Say the word "frisky".

657
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,645
- Frisky.
- Say "frisky".

658
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:10,845
- Say "frisky". It's fun.
- "Frisky". Yes, it is rather fun.

659
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,810
Is there a playground nearbfi
With swings or monkey bars?

660
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,562
You're welcome to use the hotel's
health club once you've signed

661
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:27,527
- Health club!
- Henry, look at me.

662
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:33,170
- Did you eat anything in jail?
- No. I just had an aspirin.

663
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,682
- Are you sure it was an aspirin?
- A prisoner gave it to me.

664
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,089
Well, if a prisoner gave it to him ...!

665
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:44,001
- Can you pull over'? Pull over.
- No, don't pull over.

666
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:49,570
Pull over. Like a pullover sweater.
It's the same as pull over.

667
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:54,448
To pull over and yet it's a sweater.

668
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,049
Could you pull over'? Like right now!

669
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,165
- Too confining, too confining!
- Henry!

670
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:45,568
Look at the beautiful oneness
of this tree. It becomes us.

671
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:50,004
Do you feel its ontological being?
What?

672
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:55,643
- Guess who I'm hearing.
- The earth's?

673
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,811
Baba Ram Dass. Remember him
and his inspirational tape?

674
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,766
We never listened to it
because it melted in the car.

675
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:12,448
- We got all our priorities screwed up.
- We do! We have to love more.

676
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,120
We have to give it to other people.
Wow!

677
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,201
Come on, let's do her!

678
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:37,641
Look at this, we have arrived!
This is the Presidential Suite.

679
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:43,051
- The interview is in 18 minutes.
- Who needs a job with all this?

680
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:49,009
We have nothing! I'll unpack
and I want you to think "advertising".

681
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,489
All right, I'm going
to focus on advertising.

682
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,524
I am an advertising

683
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:03,291
No, you have to get dressed.
Now. Think!

684
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:08,008
I have an idea, baby. What is the most
unused advertising space in the world?

685
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:15,322
The tongue. It's always hanging out.
People drooling over restaurants.

686
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,683
It would be easy to write on there.
Someone who sells breath mints.

687
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:24,762
Dogs' tongues are always hanging out.
Would you write this down!

688
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:32,367
Don't worry. I never forget a good idea.
Now it's time to take a shower.

689
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,645
Okay, baby. Your little genius
is going to take a shower.

690
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,321
I think I found some more
unused advertising space.

691
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:11,044
- Henry, no!
- I'll have those pants pressed for you.

692
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:15,962
Is there anything you need?
A basket of fruit, perhaps? Banana?

693
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:20,927
- Taxi.
- Put on your pants, for God's sake.

694
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:26,490
We'll get a cab over here.
Get your pants on. I have your coat.

695
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:31,811
Put your shoes on. We're going
to make it. Slow down, baby.

696
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,048
We've got plenty of time.

697
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:39,724
We're almost there.
We've got two minutes.

698
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,127
Here it is, 590.

699
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,324
- Go, go!
- Let's go, honey.

700
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,600
Come on, Henry. Henry!

701
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,088
- This way, come on!
- Sorry.

702
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,369
Come on. You look fabulous.
I think you're going to get the job.

703
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,404
- Get the job?
- Yes.

704
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:15,687
You look good, sweetheart.
Button up your coat.

705
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:31,243
Okay, we're here. Come on.

706
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,090
- Henry?
- This is not right.

707
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:45,411
- This is the floor.
- I can't do this.

708
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:51,369
You're stressed out. Everything's fine.
Just don't mention that tongue idea.

709
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,530
Take my hand, sweetie.

710
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:59,169
Visualise getting off the elevator.

711
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,443
I'm visualising coming off the elevator.
My hand's out.

712
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,531
- Feels good. Different temperature.
- You're going to make it.

713
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,361
- My hair is out.
- Good. Your foot's out.

714
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,963
I'm coming
No, I can't do this!

715
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:18,164
I'm burned out,
just going through the motions!

716
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,922
- I know what he means.
- We just can't do this anymore.

717
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:28,286
Don't be irresponsible. I know
you took a hallucinogenic in prison.

718
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:34,761
- But you still can make an effort.
- We can't!

719
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:40,364
Are you going to listen to your
loving wife of 27 years or this guy?

720
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:45,282
He understands me. You just can't
handle that. We're one now.

721
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,891
Let's go, honey.

722
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,045
Let's go.

723
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:58,521
I go "No way', and he goes "So way'.
And I go "You're totally stupid".

724
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:02,725
- Excuse me.
- Henry Clark to see Lisa Tobin.

725
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:09,007
Oh, you're Henry Clark. I tried
calling you at home and at the hotel.

726
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,409
- The meeting was moved to nine.
- Are you serious?

727
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,081
We didn't get that message.

728
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:22,162
We had trouble getting into the hotel,
the manager's a transvestite

729
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:26,524
Miss Tobin is preparing for a meeting
before she flies to London for a week.

730
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:33,171
- There must be something you can do.
- This is a sign. It's over.

731
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:38,207
The entire city is saying "Go home".
On the Statue of Liberty it says:

732
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,961
"Give me your tired, give me your poor,
everyone but Henry and Nancy Clark!"

733
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:48,202
- A cracker will fill you with hope again.
- No, it'll just fill me with cracker.

734
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:54,123
- What about marrow sucking?
- We're too old for that.

735
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:04,846
All right Henry. The plane leaves
at 2:30. I'm going to be on it.

736
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:12,206
I'm going back to the hotel. I've just
enough energy to steal some towels.

737
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:18,008
Well, Henry.
I guess New York won.

738
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,846
New York won?

739
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:33,202
New York won?

740
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:41,209
No, you never have to wax again.
Of course it hurts.

741
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:45,610
It's worth it. With global warming
you'll be in a bathing suit all year long.

742
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,202
- This is an emergency.
- Give me a break.

743
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,963
Give you a break? Give you a break?

744
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:01,322
Listen! In the past 24 hours
I have destroyed a car, been evicted, -

745
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,320
- forced to reveal my most intimate
secrets to a group of nymphomaniacs, -

746
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,205
- watched my wife seduce a man, -

747
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,610
- arrested for public urination and
drugged by Jaco, my new prison pal!

748
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,646
I have a house and a mortgage, a son
in college and a daughter in theatre.

749
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:22,290
I'm a quiet mid-western guy that no one
expects to snap. But when we do

750
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,482
Watch it, baby!

751
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:32,246
Meet the team. This is Henry Clark,
formerly of Sellinsky in Ohio.

752
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:36,490
- He was scheduled for 9 o'clock.
- Still on Central Standard time?

753
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:41,641
Ohio is on Eastern Standard Time
though people think it's Central.

754
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:49,122
But Central Standard time is great.
Not too early and not too late.

755
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:54,042
- It's just Central.
- I don't get the joke.

756
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,887
Your portfolio is terrific.

757
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:09,802
But we have an hour to sell a follow-up
to the "I love New York" campaign.

758
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,961
I wish our timing had been better,
but thanks for coming and good luck.

759
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,082
Thank you.

760
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,488
Let's start with "New York, New York"
and then pull back

761
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,289
- Do you know what your problem is?
- What did you say?

762
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:54,522
- Do you know what your problem is?
- No, what's my problem?

763
01:17:54,720 --> 01:18:00,762
You live here, you're jaded. You need
a fresh perspective from an outsider -

764
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:08,401
- from say Ohio. Because you've
forgotten just how amazing this city is.

765
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,969
I've had more experiences here than
people who've lived here all their lives.

766
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:18,769
I've met colourful characters, taken a
breathtaking cab ride through the Park.

767
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:27,004
I climbed to the top of a luxury hotel.
Not in the elevator, but on the hotel.

768
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:33,685
And then I fell
in love with my wife all over again.

769
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:38,886
At Tavern on the Green.
On the actual green itself.

770
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:46,202
And I had sex in front of the Mayor.
Where else could all that happen?

771
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,210
Only in New York!

772
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:01,649
- What did you just say?
- The tag line is "Only in New York".

773
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,081
Which I have copyrighted -

774
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:08,842
- along with the Statue of Liberty
giving the high five to a tourist family.

775
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,930
- He's very good.
- Can I have a doughnut?

776
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:19,331
Don't be alarmed by the Princess'
appearance. She's hideous.

777
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,729
- Is that all the Clarks' luggage?
- There's still a bag.

778
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:29,007
If it's not here in 60 seconds, the hotel
nurse will give you a lethal injection.

779
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:35,810
Mrs Clark, your yellow chariot awaits
and you have a glorious day for flying.

780
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,844
- Barf!
- My sentiments exactly.

781
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:44,046
- Please give my husband that ticket.
- Good, get a head start to the airport.

782
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:47,722
- Visit the shops, talk to a Hare Krishna.
- Close the door, please.

783
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:52,486
Baby, wait. Don't go!

784
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:57,004
<i>'</i> Go, go!
- Don't go!

785
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:03,207
- Come here, come here.
- What is it?

786
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:09,442
This is champagne, that is a limo
and this is what we're celebrating.

787
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:14,680
The key to my new office. I got the job.
We're New Yorkers now.

788
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,248
- We're never going to leave!
- Please, God, no.

789
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:25,483
- I got you something, too.
- You didn't have to.

790
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:30,322
- Oh, you got me a spare key.
- It's the key to your office.

791
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:37,130
- Are you still high?
- I can hire anyone I want. I want you.

792
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,722
I want my partner back.

793
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:46,006
All the best things in my life are
thanks to you. Marriage, kids, work.

794
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:52,287
- This is crazy.
- Know what I think marrow sucking is?

795
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:57,805
- It's being with you. That's how I suck.
- Oh, Henry.

796
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:08,251
- What does it pay?
- Are you going to the airport or not'?

797
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:11,489
Why? We live here.

798
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,406
Only in New York.

799
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:23,811
So, I take it you won't be
checking out today. Or perhaps ever.

800
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:30,804
- Mario, get the bags.
- Bags! They're in the cab.

801
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,369
My God.
I think I'm beginning to like them.

802
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,489
<i>- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
- Hi, sweetie.</i>

803
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:57,441
Congratulations. You should be proud.

804
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:02,043
- Isn't the theatre magical?
- Are those my earrings?

805
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,811
Bravo !

806
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,608
