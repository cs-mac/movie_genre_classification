1
00:00:02,239 --> 00:00:04,217
Are you pushing it?

2
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:07,699
- Push it!
- I have fingers! It just goes, "Bing."

3
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:10,673
Is it "bing"
or "bing?"

4
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:12,656
Bing. Bing.
It's a bad bing.

5
00:00:12,657 --> 00:00:13,716
Makes the sound of
terminal cancer,

6
00:00:13,717 --> 00:00:15,744
or my mother pressing me
for an intimate lunch.

7
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:18,656
Got it.

8
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:19,716
Is this video thingy gonna work
now? 'Cause it's important.

9
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:21,727
You like these shoes?
You bought 'em

10
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:23,723
for my birthday last week.

11
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,686
Great. Now you can eat the
leaves at the top of the tree.

12
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:30,648
Half giraffe,
half drag queen, honey.

13
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:33,698
Hi. It's me, Bryan Collins.

14
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:35,744
But you won't know me as that.

15
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:38,732
You will know me as... Dad.

16
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:41,732
Maybe even Daddy.

17
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:48,673
Oh, God, I think I would just
die if you called me Daddy.

18
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,698
Um...

19
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:55,648
this video is to show you...

20
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,741
how desperately
you were wanted.

21
00:00:59,716 --> 00:01:02,666
And how much we love you.

22
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:06,691
You're our baby.

23
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:11,677
We are just so excited
to meet you.

24
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:14,731
<i>But I'm getting ahead
of myself here.</i>

25
00:01:14,732 --> 00:01:16,716
<i>I should go back
to the beginning.</i>

26
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:19,648
<i>See, this fairytale began
in a faraway land called Ohio,</i>

27
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:20,720
<i>where four
very different people,</i>

28
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:23,677
<i>against all odds,
ended up becoming a family.</i>

29
00:01:23,678 --> 00:01:26,648
Would you look at that?

30
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:27,709
Just strutting down the middle

31
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,699
of Buck Eye Road
in broad daylight,

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,677
proud as gay peacocks.

33
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:33,716
- Why shouldn't they be, Nana?
- Don't call me that.

34
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,682
- I don't look old enough to be a grandmother.
- Great-grandmother.

35
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:39,660
I happen to love the gays.
I could never get my hair

36
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:41,703
- to look this good without 'em.
- Seems like they love each other, so...

37
00:01:41,706 --> 00:01:43,698
Oh, and now with the PDA?

38
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:45,702
Those ass campers
have some nerve.

39
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:47,736
Nana, those are lesbians.

40
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:49,715
Those are ugly men.

41
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:51,686
Oh.

42
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:53,695
- What did you forget this time?
- My name tag.

43
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:55,720
- I need it for work.
- I don't understand.

44
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:57,694
You were always so pretty.

45
00:01:57,695 --> 00:01:59,648
You're almost as
pretty as I was

46
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:00,689
at your age, and then you...

47
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,732
you got knocked up.

48
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:03,665
You pissed it all away.

49
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,691
You wasted your entire life.

50
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,648
Thanks for the pep talk, Nana.

51
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:08,728
You were a year older than me
when you had my mom.

52
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,698
I was married.
I thought

53
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:11,737
your mother was
a fibroid tumor.

54
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:13,677
By the time I figured it out,

55
00:02:13,678 --> 00:02:14,741
she had a face,
and I was screwed.

56
00:02:14,742 --> 00:02:17,727
So, if I actually plan
to have a baby someday,

57
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,711
that would be a family first?

58
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,745
I should have become a nun.

59
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:32,652
Say it.

60
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,673
The United States is the most
powerful country on Earth.

61
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:37,736
Yeah. Oh!

62
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:39,698
Oh! Goldie!

63
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,706
Baby, I... I can explain.

64
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:43,736
I was gone six minutes.

65
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:45,690
Six.

66
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:46,732
How is this even possible?

67
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,656
Was she hiding in the bushes
when I left?

68
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:50,703
Tool shed.

69
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,682
- Oh.
- Oh.

70
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:00,698
I buy it in bulk.

71
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,693
You'll need it for
his tighty whiteys.

72
00:03:02,694 --> 00:03:03,722
Let's just say, the man's not

73
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:05,687
real detail-oriented
back there, so...

74
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:09,695
Oh, and, um... one last thing?

75
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:13,660
I've kind of given up
on my life.

76
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:14,707
I forgot to dream.

77
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,698
I forgot I want it all.

78
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,698
Every last drop, and this...

79
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,649
this was the last push I needed
to remember that, so thank you.

80
00:03:24,657 --> 00:03:25,724
Congratulations.

81
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:28,732
He's all yours.

82
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,727
So, are you thinking
about joining

83
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:35,648
the Brownies this year?
Did I ever tell you

84
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,677
that I set my troop's record
for cookie sales?

85
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:41,660
In spite of that Mindy Goldfarb
trying to Jew down my customers.

86
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:42,707
Nana, you're a bigot.

87
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,656
I'm unfriending you right now.

88
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,648
I am extremely tolerant
to all peoples.

89
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:48,682
When they opened
that Chipotle here,

90
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:50,680
I was the first
of my friends to go.

91
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:51,732
And that is Spanish food.

92
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:54,653
Still unfriended.

93
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:57,698
Now why are you crying?

94
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,740
Did you just realize that
you were a grown woman

95
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,740
walking around in
public in an apron?

96
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,699
My whole life,
I've wanted to leave Clay,

97
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,719
and now I have the greatest
excuse in the world.

98
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,701
Oh, please. You caught him
singing Springsteen

99
00:04:07,702 --> 00:04:08,732
on the toilet before.

100
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,665
Mmm, the man was on a date.

101
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,745
In my own bed.

102
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:18,690
What kind of closet space

103
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,739
are we talking about here?

104
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,680
I'm gonna need lots of room
for my wigs.

105
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:23,732
You're not moving in unless
you're real good at making food.

106
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,731
You, Hello Kitty, out.

107
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,723
Whoa. Hey.

108
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:30,732
- That is a toy, right?
- You know something, Clay?

109
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:34,690
I have put up with you
for the past nine years.

110
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,720
I've put up with your

111
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:38,656
ridiculous Fozzie Bear
impersonations,

112
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:40,706
with your self-diagnosed
narcolepsy.

113
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:42,740
No. That's real.
It's not just naps.

114
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,723
I can't think of anything else
to do except to kill you.

115
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:48,669
Now, unfortunately,
I couldn't live in prison

116
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,716
without my Lean Cuisine.

117
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,678
So I am open to other options.

118
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:02,669
I've always found you
to be really sexy, Nana.

119
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,660
Oh, put that gherkin away.

120
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:05,716
What's a gherkin?

121
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:07,686
A tiny pickle.

122
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:09,682
That's messed up.

123
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:17,732
Hey, baby?

124
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,715
You ever think
about going someplace amazing?

125
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:23,699
Somewhere you've never,
ever been before?

126
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,695
- Every single day.
- Like where?

127
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:26,745
I want to drive to Hawaii.

128
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:32,732
I think we can make it
to Honolulu on half a tank.

129
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:42,860

130
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:47,745
Pretty good for Tex,
and now he'll run with it...

131
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:49,698
Hey, babe.

132
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:50,724
Hey, no people food for Smelly.

133
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,665
Oh, he loves it.

134
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,701
I have to tell you something.

135
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:54,732
Got to wait
till halftime, sweetie.

136
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,731
Is that when Madonna sings?

137
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:59,681
Okay, so, I was shopping...

138
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:02,878
A question for you.

139
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,933
Are you sure I don't look
like Mary Tyler Moore in these?

140
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:06,944
Do you want to look
like Mary Tyler Moore?

141
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,078
Well, not the hair, obviously,

142
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:10,110
but yes, yes, I do.

143
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:12,164
Mmm. Here we go.
Five-yard line. Here we go.

144
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:14,128
- Money! Here we go!
- Okay, fine, fine, fine, fine.

145
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:16,132
Fine, fine, I will hurry it up,
but I was just trying

146
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:18,161
- to paint you a picture.
- Okay, what? Yes.

147
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:24,139
Oh, my God, that is the cutest
thing I have ever seen.

148
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,194
I must have it.

149
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,193
He is going to be a star...

150
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:46,157
Bry, we have to talk
about your dieting.

151
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:49,143
Honey, when I saw
that miniature person,

152
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:51,117
whose skin was
flawless, by the way,

153
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:52,157
I really got it.

154
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:54,135
I want us

155
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:56,139
to have baby clothes...

156
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,110
and a baby to wear them.

157
00:06:58,111 --> 00:06:59,199
He's got the first down
and more!

158
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,185
Past the 45,
out of bounds at the 47...

159
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:06,139
Sweetie, you know you can't
return a baby to Barneys.

160
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,127
David... look,

161
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,190
you are the kindest man

162
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:13,194
I have ever had the pleasure
to love.

163
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:17,114
You would be an amazing father.

164
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:18,207
You would feed the child,

165
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,202
and bathe him and care for him
in the middle of the night

166
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:23,207
when he has rubella,
or anything else contagious.

167
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,115
- How do you know what rubella is?
- <i>Little House On the Prairie.</i>

168
00:07:26,118 --> 00:07:28,127
Oh. What would you do?

169
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:29,207
- Me?
- Mmm.

170
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,168
I'm the fun dad.

171
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:34,152
Oh.

172
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,118
- I don't know.
- My dad screwed me up

173
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,190
pretty good. What do you think
two dads would do to a kid?

174
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:42,122
You really think it's such
a good idea to bring a kid

175
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:43,184
into the world with such
a nontraditional family?

176
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:45,163
I know somebody else
from a nontraditional family.

177
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,207
A Halfrican-American
who was raised by a grandma.

178
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,148
And that person seems
to be doing just fine.

179
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:52,135
Oh, yeah. Barack Obama.

180
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:55,118
No. Mariah Carey,
but your example works, too.

181
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:57,127
Look around.
Your definition

182
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:58,194
of traditional
might need a refresh.

183
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:00,139
Check her out.
She's old enough

184
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,188
to be their grandmother,
but she wanted them

185
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,169
so badly, she dusted off
her dinosaur eggs.

186
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:06,186
I was a whore for a long time.

187
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:08,160
I mean, I slept with everyone.

188
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:10,143
I acted like a kid
for too long.

189
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:12,122
Just wasn't ready to have one.

190
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:15,127
By the time I was ready,
I couldn't find the right man.

191
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,189
When I gave up looking for him,
I found me.

192
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,127
And then, with the help
of a lot of drugs, them.

193
00:08:20,128 --> 00:08:22,128
Hey.

194
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:33,178
My husband's
regular-sized,

195
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,152
so there was a 50% chance

196
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:37,173
that my daughter would be a
part-time Christmas elf like me.

197
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:40,110
I told my husband,
we didn't have to have kids.

198
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:41,203
We didn't have to risk it.

199
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:43,193
My husband said
that he loves me,

200
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:46,202
so why wouldn't she be loved
in this world?

201
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:49,144
She's gonna be taller
than me this year.

202
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:53,169
Face it, honey.

203
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,110
Abnormal is the new normal.

204
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:59,163
So, thank you so much
for coming over to the house.

205
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,130
That's just one
of the many benefits

206
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:03,144
of being a Platinum Member
of Expanding Families.

207
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:04,194
- Oh.
- That,

208
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:07,135
And the stunning models
I put in your VIP egg file.

209
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:08,178
- Models.
- Real...?

210
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,147
One of our recent clients...
a very famous

211
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:11,194
designer who I'm wearing,

212
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:13,169
- but I can't reveal...
- Jessica Simpson.

213
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:15,193
Yeah, you're saying
I'm wearing mom jeans?

214
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:18,131
No, thank you.
No, this is a man.

215
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:20,128
- Oh.
- He wanted to make sure

216
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,178
That his egg donor
was not a fatty.

217
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,186
- Sure.
- We did a worldwide search, and I threw

218
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,126
Some of the sloppy seconds
your way.

219
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,167
All right, what-what...

220
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:28,128
what about the things
that matter,

221
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:31,152
like intelligence, or the
ability for cognitive thought?

222
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,151
Uh, something that would
give the kid a shot at being

223
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:35,111
head of the Mathletes,
like I was.

224
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:36,131
I would like

225
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:37,186
a skinny, blond child

226
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:39,127
who doesn't cry.

227
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,144
- Is this extra?
- It's impossible.

228
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,169
Not for our Platinum Members.

229
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,169
- I knew it.
- You can't be serious.

230
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:45,110
Here's how it works.

231
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:46,161
You click through
our egg donor files,

232
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:49,118
find your match,
create a perfect embryo,

233
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,178
and then implant it
in a surrogate.

234
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:52,185
She's just like
an Easy-Bake Oven,

235
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:55,135
except with no legal rights
to the cupcake.

236
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,165
Now, who's gonna be the bio dad?

237
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,203
- I am.
- I am.

238
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:00,119
Uh-oh.

239
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:02,929
I'm kind of nervous, babe.
This is a big deal.

240
00:10:02,932 --> 00:10:04,865
We're picking the biological
mother of our child.

241
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:05,896
Oh, my God, we have 80 choices.

242
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,882
First up is...

243
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:11,713
100 pounds gone.
Just 100 pounds to go.

244
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,768
Bless.

245
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:13,786
I'm really into sci-fi,

246
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,705
but not the Green Goblin.

247
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:16,743
Obviously.

248
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:18,722
Trust me,
I recognize the irony.

249
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:20,747
Nine abortions, and here I am.

250
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:22,722
I like her.

251
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,714
Hi. My name is Abby.

252
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:28,705
People say I look a lot
like Gwyneth Paltrow...

253
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:31,711
- Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
- I got it! I got it! I got it!

254
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:37,781
Well, this is as far west
as we could go without driving

255
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:39,772
into the water. Oh.

256
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,782
- Mom?
- What?

257
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:43,735
What were your dreams

258
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:45,711
before you and Daddy
accidentally had me?

259
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,693
Uh, best accident ever.

260
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:48,723
You don't have to say that

261
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:50,710
every time.
I get it.

262
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:52,760
No one plans to have a kid
when they're 15.

263
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:55,726
Unless they're in
an extremist Christian cult.

264
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:57,773
Uh... well...

265
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:02,726
I wanted to be a lawyer.

266
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,701
An independent woman
who didn't need a man,

267
00:11:05,702 --> 00:11:06,750
and wear these expensive suits,

268
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:07,784
like Julianna Margulies
in<i> The Good Wife,</i>

269
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:09,734
but without the
disgraced husband.

270
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,709
Based on the facts
of my compelling argument,

271
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,717
and use of big words, like ipso
facto, I respectfully request

272
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:14,786
you return a verdict
of not guilty as charged.

273
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:16,710
<i>Yes!</i>

274
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:17,761
Not guilty.
Whatever she says.

275
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:20,735
I agree. She's too good.
Case dismissed.

276
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:22,765
So, why can't
that still be your dream?

277
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:25,765
'Cause today my dream is...

278
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:29,706
is wishing
I didn't have to tell you

279
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:31,739
that the last three days
are all I can afford.

280
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,768
I can't do this by
myself, sweetheart.

281
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,726
I wish I could.

282
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,705
I'm sorry.

283
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:41,743
You don't ever have
to say that to me.

284
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,711
Say it to yourself.

285
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:52,751
Hi.

286
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:55,701
Oh, so you finally decided
to take my call.

287
00:11:55,702 --> 00:11:56,746
What happened?
Did the police pick you up?

288
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:57,786
You called the police?

289
00:11:57,787 --> 00:12:00,727
- You stole my car.
- I'm sorry, but does

290
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:02,715
- The washer-dryer unit come with the house?
- If it's not

291
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:04,715
On the flyer, no one knows.
Just make an offer.

292
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:06,701
You are a selfish,
spoiled child.

293
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,735
You're right.
I'm sorry. Thank you.

294
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:10,709
I had to ride the bus today...
the bus.

295
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,694
I was sitting
next to a man with no arms.

296
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:15,726
He was drinking a thermos
full of mushroom soup

297
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,736
with these little stublets
coming out of his shoulder.

298
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,693
It was like watching Flipper try
to drink a beer.

299
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:21,719
Why do I have to spend

300
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,693
my entire life making up

301
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:24,727
for everyone else's mistakes?

302
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:25,752
You don't.

303
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:27,768
Not anymore.

304
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:29,743
I keep staying with you,

305
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:32,785
thinking things will change
for me and Shania, but...

306
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:37,698
but the thing is, if-if I don't
change, nothing ever will.

307
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:40,710
We're not coming home, Nana.

308
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:42,715
Wait, what?

309
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,751
Isn't technology amazing?

310
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:53,734
We created fully formed embryos
with Gwyneth Paltrow's twin

311
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:55,696
and just popped 'em
into you to grow.

312
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:57,780
To you, Melissa,
our caring, nurturing surrogate.

313
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:59,727
Our little swimmers are
duking it out already.

314
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:01,772
May the best sperm win.

315
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:04,765
- Can't believe we could already be daddies.
- I know.

316
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:06,697
My God, my heart
is beating fast.

317
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:07,782
Feel that... that's not normal.

318
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:09,747
I just want to assure you guys

319
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,790
that I will do everything
in my power to take care

320
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,776
of myself and in turn be

321
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:16,751
a loving host
to your precious child.

322
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:17,771
Melissa, I just want
to let you know

323
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:18,788
that we will be here for you

324
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:20,734
during every step
of the pregnancy.

325
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:22,694
If there is anything
that you need,

326
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:24,693
please do not hesitate to ask.

327
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:25,723
Yeah, I can Skype at work.

328
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:26,723
Thank you.

329
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,719
You are so sweet.

330
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:30,747
I need a BMW.

331
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:31,752
- I'm sorry?
- I don't understand.

332
00:13:31,753 --> 00:13:32,769
Let me help you.
Excuse me.

333
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,739
I'd like a gin and tonic.

334
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,701
Uh-oh, that's alcohol.

335
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:37,750
You can't drink
when you're pregnant.

336
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:38,788
I'll also have
the yellowtail carpaccio.

337
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:40,734
That's raw.
Uh, there are parasites.

338
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,782
You have to think of the baby.

339
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:44,740
- Anything else?
- Just an ashtray. Thank you.

340
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:47,705
You guys should think
of the good of your baby.

341
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:49,710
So, a powerboat and the world's

342
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:51,776
largest truffle by close
of business tomorrow

343
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:54,714
or... I light up,
you got it?

344
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:57,698
- This is uterine blackmail.
- It's a great idea, isn't it?

345
00:13:57,699 --> 00:13:58,744
- Just give me the cigarettes.
- You're blackmailing us?

346
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:00,732
You guys are gross.

347
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:05,715
♪ Baby love, my baby love. ♪

348
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:08,776
Oh, babe, he has your nose.

349
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:11,743
We can have that fixed.

350
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:13,747
He's making that face
like he needs to go potty.

351
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:14,748
David, that's you.

352
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:16,727
- He just went.
- Well...

353
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:20,761
- Come here. Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

354
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:23,694
He looks like me
when I was a puppy.

355
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:26,726
It's Gary.

356
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:28,693
Yes.

357
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:30,693
Hi, Bryan, it's Gary Snyder,
Expanding Families.

358
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:31,776
How are you?

359
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:35,726
I just want to apologize again
for the incident that occurred

360
00:14:35,727 --> 00:14:36,742
with your previous
surrogate choice.

361
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:37,777
We had no idea.

362
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:40,714
Celine Dion gave her
a great reference.

363
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:41,775
Well, we dropped the litigation

364
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:43,730
when we found out the womb
terrorist wasn't pregnant.

365
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:44,740
Well, we have a new surrogate,

366
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:46,705
and I am absolutely confident

367
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:48,693
she'd be perfect for your needs.

368
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:50,715
- Why don't you just come in and meet her?
- Please?

369
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:51,746
I'm great at being pregnant.

370
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:53,738
I had tons of energy
and no morning sickness.

371
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:54,777
Having Shania is the
most successful thing

372
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:56,705
I've done in my life so far.

373
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,715
- Any family history of cancer?
- No.

374
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:00,789
He's a doctor for lady bits.

375
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,765
- A gay-necologist.
- Good for you.

376
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,785
Syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia?

377
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:06,754
Not even HPV, and
you can throw a cat

378
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:07,756
and hit a girl with that.

379
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:09,747
Checks out beautifully.

380
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:14,743
So why, then, does a beautiful,
smart, seemingly sane person

381
00:15:14,744 --> 00:15:17,705
want to gestate
someone else's child?

382
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:20,739
Well, $35,000 is a
huge chunk of money.

383
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,785
I need a way to change
my daughter's life.

384
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:24,767
I want to go to
law school someday.

385
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:26,761
And you have no problem
with doing this for two men?

386
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:28,693
No moral issue with that?

387
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,710
Oh, no, I requested
a gay couple.

388
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:33,785
<i>I was driving, and I overheard
a deranged homeless woman</i>

389
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:35,755
<i>saying not so nice things</i>

390
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:39,726
<i>about a lesbian couple,
but all I could think was,</i>

391
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:40,790
<i>a family is a family.</i>

392
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:43,777
And love is love.

393
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,693
Well, I just have one
more question for you.

394
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:50,761
- Uh-huh.
- Are you now or have you ever been

395
00:15:50,764 --> 00:15:52,789
A secret operative
for the Republican Party?

396
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,693
We screened for that.

397
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:56,776
Okay.

398
00:15:56,777 --> 00:15:58,756
- I love that Goldie.
- I don't know.

399
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,693
She reminds me of me

400
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:01,756
when I first came
to L.A. to make it.

401
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:03,735
I did like
that daughter of hers.

402
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:04,773
I'm less sold on her.

403
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:08,701
I want us to have a baby.

404
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:10,744
At some point, we just got
to move past the setbacks.

405
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:13,726
So, what's stopping you?

406
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:15,710
I don't know.

407
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:20,711
It's just sinking in
that babies have no teeth.

408
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:22,761
They're all gums.

409
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:30,743
I don't want our sperm
to be competitive.

410
00:16:30,744 --> 00:16:32,785
I don't want our sperm

411
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:35,760
to do some crazy genetic race.

412
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,718
What are you talking about?

413
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:41,701
When did you make
this decision?

414
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:45,711
I have four masculine brothers
and one masculine sister.

415
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:48,718
You're an only child.

416
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:50,781
It's more important for
you to create something

417
00:16:50,782 --> 00:16:53,760
that's yours biologically
to recognize.

418
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:55,764
Not being the baby's bio dad

419
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,764
doesn't make me
any less of a dad.

420
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:59,743
You'd do that for me?

421
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:02,743
No, for me.

422
00:17:02,744 --> 00:17:05,706
We need more people like you
walking around in the world.

423
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,736
Plus, then I'll get to
lord it over you forever.

424
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:09,748
Thank you.

425
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:11,747
I love you.

426
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:13,710
I love you.

427
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:14,775
Now, go make me
macaroni and cheese

428
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:16,715
so we can get started
on my foot rub.

429
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:18,776
Okay.

430
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:21,711
Thank you.

431
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:27,326
Your embryos are ready
for implantation.

432
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:29,431
Now, as a doctor, David
has indicated he'd like

433
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:31,453
to witness the procedure if
that's okay with you, Goldie.

434
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:33,493
Sure. He'll be more
involved than the dad was

435
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:35,498
last time I got pregnant.

436
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:37,434
I'd love you to be
there, too, Bryan.

437
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:38,507
Oh, no, no, I faint
at the sight of vagina.

438
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:40,452
They're like tarantula faces.

439
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:42,493
Oh.
Can my daughter stay with me?

440
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,438
Oh, no, honey, don't you
worry about anything.

441
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,471
I'll watch
your little cutie here.

442
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:46,486
You just go get yourself
knocked up.

443
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:48,503
Me and Lady Pants
will chill out.

444
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:52,453
Do everything I wouldn't do.

445
00:18:00,444 --> 00:18:03,410
These pants were
very expensive.

446
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:06,439
To me, they don't look
like that.

447
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,439
Any second thoughts?

448
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,493
I'm good.

449
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:11,414
How about you?

450
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:13,411
- Oh, me?
- Yeah.

451
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:14,499
I mean, having a baby
is a huge step.

452
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,443
Everything in your life
is gonna be covered

453
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:19,477
in poop, spit-up and drool.

454
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:22,469
It'll be a bit like living
with my soon-to-be-ex-husband.

455
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,410
Oh, my God, you're crying.

456
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:27,459
No, I'm not crying.

457
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,440
I haven't cried since
I got second place

458
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,469
in the sixth grade
science fair.

459
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:36,448
I'm always the guy that
everyone counts on.

460
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,444
I mean, when do I get
a chance to fall apart?

461
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:40,431
Well, now is a real good time.

462
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:42,460
At work I'm a rock,
and at home I'm a rock.

463
00:18:42,461 --> 00:18:43,490
I'm like what
Simon and Garfunkel

464
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:45,427
would refer to as an island.

465
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:46,457
Are those the doctors
you work with?

466
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,461
Oh, my God.

467
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:50,473
You know, I've delivered

468
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:52,422
a thousand babies in my life,

469
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,449
and I don't think
I've ever held one

470
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,453
that's over four minutes old.

471
00:18:57,465 --> 00:18:59,432
What if I'm not
ready to be a dad?

472
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:02,410
I became a mom
in a Rite Aid bathroom.

473
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:04,444
I had to borrow 25 cents
to get into the stall.

474
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,507
You're way ahead of the game.

475
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:08,460
David,

476
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:12,436
you are going to be
an amazing dad.

477
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:17,411
Excuse me. Someone's
here for you.

478
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:19,448
Claims not to be your nana.

479
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,464
How... how'd you find me?

480
00:19:21,465 --> 00:19:24,410
I have been hot
on your trail for days.

481
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:25,465
This one led me
straight to you.

482
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:28,439
They're in Venice Beach,
California.

483
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,422
Twitter stamped their location.

484
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:33,431
You people are so darn
good with computers.

485
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:35,506
And thanks for helping
build the railroads.

486
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,427
Who cares how?

487
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:38,447
There is a giant

488
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:39,494
homosexual elephant
in the room.

489
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:42,410
Listen, ma'am,
I know it's a lot

490
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:43,447
to digest, but my partner and I

491
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,459
cannot have a child

492
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,494
the traditional way,

493
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:48,456
and Goldie here wants
to carry ours for us.

494
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:50,410
Oh, Bryan, I hauled my ass

495
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:52,461
all the way across town
to bring you these damn eggs.

496
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:53,493
Oh, no.

497
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:57,431
You are not growing
one of her kind of eggs

498
00:19:57,432 --> 00:19:58,463
in my granddaughter.

499
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,411
Oh, no, sweetie,
these are poached.

500
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:02,439
What the hell you mean,
my kind of eggs?

501
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,478
The last time I checked,
this diamond-speckled watch

502
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,431
my gay boss bought me

503
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:09,443
without his consent,
it was 2012.

504
00:20:09,444 --> 00:20:11,461
Now, why don't you take your
Callista Gingrich hairdo

505
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:14,456
and your racist mind
back to the past

506
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:16,460
or the South where they belong?

507
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:17,482
Guys, you know this whole thing

508
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,482
just went live streaming
on Twitter?

509
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:21,481
Nana, I want to
help this family.

510
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:23,442
I feel like I just ate
a black and gay stew

511
00:20:23,443 --> 00:20:24,494
right before I fell asleep.

512
00:20:24,495 --> 00:20:26,507
- This is a nightmare.
- No,

513
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:28,444
This ain't a nightmare,
but I'm gonna

514
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:30,410
pinch you real
good to make sure.

515
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:32,448
Goldie, have you lost
your damn mind?

516
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:34,444
What are you doing, helping
these salami-smokers?

517
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:36,473
- Wow.
- That's a good one. That's new.

518
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:38,498
It is so wrong,
and have you even thought

519
00:20:38,499 --> 00:20:41,481
about what kind of message
you are sending your daughter?

520
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:43,463
That you can be
whatever you want to be

521
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:45,453
no matter how many people
tell you that you're nothing.

522
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,422
It is not normal.

523
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:49,444
The baby I want to carry for
David and Bryan will have

524
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:51,485
two loving parents who
desperately want a child.

525
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:53,478
Who are you to say
that's not normal?

526
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,423
Because I lived it.

527
00:20:57,469 --> 00:21:01,443
Okay, here goes.

528
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:03,456
Your grandfather had a friend
who worked for him

529
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:05,435
at the pet store for many years.

530
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:06,471
Uncle Leon, with
all the puffy hair?

531
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:07,471
I never could stand

532
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:08,473
going into that store.

533
00:21:08,474 --> 00:21:10,481
That Leon gave every hamster

534
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:12,507
in the store some queer name
from a Broadway musical.

535
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:14,493
He was always like,

536
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:18,439
"Rum Tum Tugger was chewing
on Auntie Mame's tail."

537
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,473
- What the hell is she talking about?
- One day,

538
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:22,485
My old Chrysler leaked oil
all over my driveway,

539
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:25,477
so I had to go down
to the pet store and get a bag

540
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:27,452
of kitty litter to soak it up.

541
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:31,422
I walked through the back door,
and I saw them together.

542
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,418
Oh, Nana.

543
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,477
Leon stood there
with his private parts dangling

544
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:37,457
for all the parakeets
to laugh at.

545
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,439
Am I being punked?

546
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,473
That man didn't love me.

547
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:45,444
- That man loved a man.
- So, what did you do?

548
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:46,505
I stayed with him
for ten more years,

549
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,478
and I helped him build
his Beanie Baby collection.

550
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:52,468
Now, Goldie,
I am begging you, please,

551
00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:53,486
let's just go get Goggles

552
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:56,410
and get back in the car
and go home.

553
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:57,453
I'm sorry, Nana.

554
00:21:57,454 --> 00:21:59,460
We're staying.

555
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:02,461
I need to help these
guys... and myself.

556
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:24,506
Goldie's mama ran away
and ditched her with me

557
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:27,410
when she was just
eight years old.

558
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:30,410
Three generations
of babies raising babies.

559
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:31,442
Earlier, when you referred

560
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:32,494
to the homosexual elephant
in the room,

561
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:34,507
you were talking
about David, right?

562
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:40,414
Okay, we are here waiting
to find out if we made you.

563
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:42,418
I'm so excited,
I haven't eaten in two days.

564
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,452
Thanks to you,
I'm wearing my skinny jeans.

565
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:46,427
Does it say anything yet?

566
00:22:46,428 --> 00:22:47,459
Remember,
one line... not pregnant,

567
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,499
two lines... pregnant.

568
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,427
I just peed. I'm waiting.

569
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:51,467
Say something
to the baby, Daddy David.

570
00:22:51,468 --> 00:22:52,494
- What, what, what...?
- Come on.

571
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,428
We don't know anything yet.

572
00:22:55,503 --> 00:22:58,418
And there's the lady
who made you possible.

573
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,501
Hi. This is the longest
three minutes of my life.

574
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:02,459
Oh, now's the perfect time
for the thing.

575
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,436
- Oh, the thing.
- Get the thing.

576
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:04,443
One second.

577
00:23:04,444 --> 00:23:06,410
What?

578
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:08,411
Yes, come here.

579
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:11,502
Guys.

580
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:13,480
It's your lawyer suit.
I helped pick it.

581
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:14,501
And then I re-picked it

582
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:16,499
with far fewer feathers
and bangles.

583
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,410
We want to help make
your dreams come true.

584
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:21,452
'Cause you're helping us
with ours.

585
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:25,414
But what if it doesn't work?

586
00:23:25,415 --> 00:23:26,480
What if that stick
says I'm not pregnant?

587
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:28,463
Honey, it doesn't matter
what it says.

588
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:30,503
This whole thing only started
feeling real after we met you.

589
00:23:30,504 --> 00:23:33,415
You gave us...

590
00:23:34,415 --> 00:23:36,457
You gave me hope.

591
00:23:37,473 --> 00:23:39,439
Now I know how to be a dad.

592
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,465
The only question is: when?

593
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:43,461
Now, what the hell
does that stick say?

594
00:24:15,274 --> 00:24:29,568
