1
00:01:57,303 --> 00:01:59,100
We've been waiting for you to come back...

2
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:20,285
Alice.

3
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,018
It's not this one, it's up here.

4
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:39,604
Come on.

5
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:51,742
It's too hot?

6
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:29,450
We left everything as it was

7
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:31,313
For you to take a look.

8
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:33,886
Wilson's funeral...

9
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:36,619
It was done properly.

10
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:40,197
Were his parents upset that I wasn't there?

11
00:04:43,235 --> 00:04:45,328
No one can predict accidents.

12
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,202
We thought it was because

13
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:50,534
you couldn't let Wilson go...

14
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,904
Or maybe that driver wanted to help me.

15
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:54,603
What are you saying?

16
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:56,770
Nothing.

17
00:04:59,284 --> 00:05:00,546
Are you better now?

18
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:04,850
My doctor said...

19
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,621
It's a miracle that I woke up

20
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:11,987
From a coma

21
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:17,028
After 6 months... I've earned these times.

22
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:33,774
Did he say anything?

23
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:37,675
It was too sudden

24
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:41,041
When we arrived at the hospital...

25
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:43,913
He was already...

26
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:48,417
Why did it happen?

27
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:52,056
A separated couple

28
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:59,094
Had an accident at the same time,
in different places.

29
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:01,199
One is dead...

30
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,267
The other one is still alive...

31
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:09,612
It's a shame we weren't in the same car

32
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:12,374
If we were together...

33
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,918
Would we have survived? Or...

34
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:22,183
We could have died together.

35
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:29,233
Wilson would be please to know
you are okay.

36
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:02,065
That is the store room, I'll get the key.

37
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:03,132
Never mind.

38
00:08:18,517 --> 00:08:19,916
Are you sure you don't want dinner with us?

39
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:26,350
I'm tired, I want an early night.

40
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:44,498
We'll talk about the memorial tomorrow.

41
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:46,303
Call me if you need anything.

42
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:31,379
Why have you come back?

43
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:34,154
Please don't kick me out.

44
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:37,088
Where can I go, I have no one?

45
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:39,522
I really like you.

46
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:41,798
Well, I don't like you.

47
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:44,936
I beg you, please go.

48
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:46,768
You really want me to go?

49
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,371
Go! Just get out!

50
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:51,274
Why should I go?

51
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,908
Do you have another girl?

52
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:57,505
You are so annoying! Leave me alone.

53
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,315
I'm annoying?

54
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:01,375
What about me?

55
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:03,214
I'm your girlfriend.

56
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:05,253
I've had enough!

57
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,720
I hate you, you know?

58
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,627
I dare you to say it to my face again!

59
00:10:13,465 --> 00:10:16,400
I'm really tired,
I don't want to talk anymore.

60
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:23,505
Grandma

61
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:26,576
Sweetie, how are you feeling in Hong Kong?

62
00:10:26,745 --> 00:10:27,575
I'm okay.

63
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:31,371
Are Wilson's friends treating you well?

64
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,379
Yes.

65
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:34,143
You shouldn't run off to Hong Kong alone,

66
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:36,752
we'd get worry!

67
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:39,113
- You never change. - Grandma...

68
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:41,082
What?

69
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:42,790
I...

70
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:43,950
What is it?

71
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,928
This place is weird.

72
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:49,292
Weird? What's weird?

73
00:10:49,468 --> 00:10:52,198
I told you not to go to Hong Kong.

74
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,769
Why don't you come back?

75
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:55,603
Give me more time,

76
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,903
I want to stay a bit longer.

77
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:01,743
Call me if anything comes up.

78
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:04,275
I'll call you tomorrow.

79
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:13,222
Alice, this is the address of our shop.

80
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:15,583
You can follow the map to find it.

81
00:11:15,994 --> 00:11:17,962
Winkie, Crystal, Regen,

82
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,859
Terence and I will all be there.

83
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:21,190
Do you remember them?

84
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,592
Of course I do.

85
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:26,003
If you can't find it, give us a call.

86
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:29,471
Hello?

87
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:31,040
Alice, where are you?

88
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:32,369
What's taking you so long?

89
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:34,806
I don't know.

90
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:37,739
Where am I?

91
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,077
Stay where you are, we'll look for you.

92
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:42,547
Okay

93
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:44,515
- Is she lost?
-Need to call the cops?

94
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:46,156
- Alice - Here she is.

95
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:05,007
She's waking up.

96
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:06,508
She's awake...

97
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:07,906
Alice, are you okay?

98
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,979
Give her some room.

99
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:11,706
Alice, do you need mouth to mouth?

100
00:12:14,953 --> 00:12:16,250
What are you doing?

101
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:17,183
Pervert.

102
00:12:17,355 --> 00:12:19,789
Mouth to mouth, you know...

103
00:12:20,058 --> 00:12:21,389
Who...

104
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:30,495
Alice, have some water.

105
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:34,062
How are you feeling?

106
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,137
Need to go to the hospital?

107
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:36,340
No, no hospitals.

108
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:38,874
You can tell
she hasn't taken her medicines.

109
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:40,435
How about I take you home?

110
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:41,772
Hey, I thought we are discussing

111
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:43,107
the memorial with her?

112
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:46,244
What's wrong with you?
she can't talk like this?

113
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:47,612
Do you want another memorial?

114
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:48,912
Shut up.

115
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:50,418
I'll shut you up first.

116
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:51,180
It's okay,

117
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:53,017
I'll go to the pharmacy then take you home.

118
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:57,222
It's such an important mission, I'll do it.

119
00:12:57,762 --> 00:12:58,820
You stay here.

120
00:12:58,997 --> 00:13:01,625
Do you see any customers here?

121
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,530
Plus I know mouth to mouth, look at it.

122
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:10,239
Come on.

123
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:12,635
I'll take the glass.

124
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:14,539
Thank you, Crystal.

125
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:16,270
I'm Regen.

126
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:18,143
I'm Crystal!

127
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:19,283
Sorry.

128
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:22,078
You two do look alike, maybe

129
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:23,721
Plastic surgery will help.

130
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:26,685
Get lost, loud mouth.

131
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:38,926
It's hot here.

132
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:41,466
You don't feel it, Alice?

133
00:13:42,474 --> 00:13:43,372
Aren't you hot?

134
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,002
Alice, how about...

135
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,612
I'll go and get some Ice Cream.

136
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,543
You know...

137
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:56,477
Ice Cream!

138
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:01,752
So impolite.

139
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:06,624
You too, no ice cream for you.

140
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:18,268
Wilson...

141
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,376
Why don't I remember?

142
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,596
How can you do this to Wilson?

143
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:43,699
What are you saying?

144
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:45,733
I just want her to be happy.

145
00:14:45,904 --> 00:14:46,893
Looks like you are happier.

146
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:48,300
Are you jealous of me?

147
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:49,095
How dare you!

148
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:50,798
Andy, let go!

149
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:52,902
You want to kill him?

150
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:56,142
How come you know...Cantonese?

151
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:02,079
I... - I...What about it?

152
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:05,183
It was hard to say Ice Cream in Mandarin.

153
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:06,882
We should have known,

154
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:08,047
you were with Wilson for some time.

155
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:11,525
Unlike you, still mutters, how old are you?

156
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:14,463
Pretends to be autistic?

157
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:17,629
Have we made up? Is it funny?

158
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:19,460
No...

159
00:15:19,637 --> 00:15:21,070
Why would I steal...?

160
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:23,434
Wilson's girlfriend?

161
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:28,271
Plus... I don't want Wilson
to visit me at night.

162
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,706
It doesn't feel right here, let's go.

163
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:35,980
I'm sorry, taking up your time today.

164
00:15:37,155 --> 00:15:38,679
The memorial...

165
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:40,484
We'll let you decide.

166
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,951
We've got time, just take care of yourself.

167
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:47,092
Call me for anything.

168
00:15:47,298 --> 00:15:50,631
You can call me too if you are lonely.

169
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:52,768
-Ignore him. -I've got one more.

170
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:56,371
- Let's go, bye. - Get lost.

171
00:15:57,342 --> 00:16:00,004
Remember to take these medicines.

172
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:02,044
Thank you.

173
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:45,571
Cheer up, still upset?

174
00:18:49,113 --> 00:18:50,444
-Morning. -Morning.

175
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:52,714
Stop talking, come on.

176
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:57,611
Where should we have breakfast?

177
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:10,498
Hello!

178
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:16,271
Alice, why are you here so early?

179
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:18,875
You feeling better? Do you need more rest?

180
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:19,941
I'm okay.

181
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:22,375
Your dress is so pretty,
where did you get it?

182
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,911
You like it? I'll give it to you.

183
00:19:24,882 --> 00:19:25,906
You're so lucky.

184
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:27,608
You went shopping, what did you get?

185
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:30,015
- Let's see. - What is it?

186
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:33,618
Why are you carrying his photo around?

187
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,156
It's jinxed.

188
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:37,760
I'm here to talk about the memorial.

189
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:40,194
I've found Wilson's photos,

190
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:42,059
that's good for the memorial.

191
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:44,401
I've also found some CDs.

192
00:19:44,702 --> 00:19:46,795
Why don't we listen and pick a few songs.

193
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:48,029
Let's sit down and talk.

194
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:49,230
Okay

195
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:52,333
Crystal, come on.

196
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:53,500
Look.

197
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:54,906
Andy, you are back?

198
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:55,807
What are you talking about?

199
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,844
The memorial.

200
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:59,310
Come with me.

201
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:04,453
Don't you feel
something's wrong with Alice?

202
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:06,551
What do you mean?

203
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:07,213
Look at her,

204
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:09,485
so bright today compare to yesterday!

205
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:10,992
That's good.

206
00:20:11,162 --> 00:20:12,186
She looks liked...

207
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:14,763
a person possessed by a ghost.

208
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:17,462
Watch your mouth.

209
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:19,262
I was just saying.

210
00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:20,127
Maybe she was jetlagged.

211
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:23,296
Jetlagged? Jetlagged from Taiwan!

212
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:24,566
Maybe I'll get sea sick...

213
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:26,573
from riding the underground!

214
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:27,733
Bullshit!

215
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:29,870
Jetlagged,

216
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:31,675
definitely jetlagged, excellent.

217
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:33,544
My customer needs me, see you.

218
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:38,716
He wrote me these letters.

219
00:20:39,457 --> 00:20:40,549
I didn't get them

220
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:42,488
They're for you, can we read them?

221
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,355
There's nothing unsuitable for kids.

222
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:37,168
Alice, the letter I've sent you

223
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:38,874
Has bounced again.

224
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:41,838
I'm upset.

225
00:22:43,147 --> 00:22:45,274
Why are you hiding from me?

226
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,043
Why did you move and not tell me?

227
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:50,319
Do you hate me?

228
00:22:57,228 --> 00:22:59,560
Alice, a couple of old friends...

229
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,288
came to the shop today.

230
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,258
They were here for wedding photos.

231
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:05,999
They asked about you.

232
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,730
And when will we get married.

233
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:13,704
I didn't tell them, we've broken up.

234
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:27,416
Alice, it's my birthday today.

235
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:30,393
I was out celebrating with friends.

236
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:32,358
We were all wildly drunk.

237
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,954
They asked...

238
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:35,564
what my birthday wish was.

239
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:38,031
If I said it then it wouldn't come true.

240
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,361
Do you know what I wished for?

241
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:45,836
I wished you are back with me.

242
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:50,137
I've just told you.

243
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:54,343
I really want you to know, I miss you.

244
00:23:59,156 --> 00:24:00,919
How come this was never sent?

245
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:08,259
Alice, I shouldn't have made that mistake.

246
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,797
It was just a fling with that woman.

247
00:24:12,904 --> 00:24:17,739
I want you to know,
you are the only one I love.

248
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:21,175
I've been regretting it
for the past 6 months.

249
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,104
I have thought it through.

250
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:26,607
I cannot lose you.

251
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:29,483
So I want to come and find you.

252
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:32,914
I will bring with me all the letters

253
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,857
I just want a chance,
for you to finish reading them

254
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:42,856
The letters represent my feelings for you.

255
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:46,063
Most importantly...

256
00:24:47,838 --> 00:24:50,671
Alice, I've made a mistake

257
00:24:52,877 --> 00:24:54,777
Can you forgive me?

258
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:19,731
Cheer up, still upset?

259
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,807
Morning.

260
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:26,075
Where should we have breakfast?

261
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:30,041
Hello?

262
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:31,010
Sweetie,

263
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:33,673
do you still feel weird today?

264
00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:34,882
Much better.

265
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,852
That's a relief.

266
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:38,045
Grandma

267
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:39,449
What is it?

268
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:42,118
I've found letters that Wilson sent me.

269
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:44,659
Really? What do they say?

270
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,477
How many people?

271
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:03,578
One.

272
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:04,948
Over there.

273
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:14,317
Doesn't she look like a ghost?

274
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:18,920
Am I welcome?

275
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:21,498
Of course.

276
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,391
I never thought you would come here.

277
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:26,396
I remember you, me and Wilson

278
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,798
always came here.

279
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:29,597
I remember your favourite food is...

280
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:31,997
What do you two want?

281
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:37,871
The sausage macaroni here is quite good,

282
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:38,980
want to try?

283
00:26:40,651 --> 00:26:41,515
Okay.

284
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,313
- Two set A. - Two set A?

285
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:47,684
Did you sleep well last night?

286
00:26:49,126 --> 00:26:50,093
I didn't sleep.

287
00:26:50,528 --> 00:26:51,358
Why?

288
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:53,729
I've found some letters from Wilson.

289
00:26:57,068 --> 00:26:58,399
All of them from him?

290
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:06,239
Never thought... they'd find me.

291
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:13,345
I hope you don't mind me asking.

292
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:15,744
Why did you leave Wilson?

293
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:18,487
He really loved you.

294
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:21,384
How do you know?

295
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,421
After you left him, he changed.

296
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:30,932
He used to be cheerful,
we tried to help him.

297
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:34,632
But in the end, he ignored all of us.

298
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,064
He just drank all day long.

299
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,641
Can you tell me more about Wilson?

300
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:42,712
Wilson was so silly.

301
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:47,608
He secluded himself after work,
he wanted to write to you.

302
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:50,113
I told him, you don't even know
where Alice moved to.

303
00:27:50,421 --> 00:27:53,549
He said, he wants to write down
his feelings for you.

304
00:27:53,891 --> 00:27:55,984
He believed you'll read
the letters one day.

305
00:27:56,694 --> 00:27:59,959
But one day, he was happy, and told us

306
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:04,798
He has quit his job,
bought a ticket to Taiwan.

307
00:28:07,972 --> 00:28:09,633
That was the last time I've seen him.

308
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:11,039
Which day was that?

309
00:28:11,575 --> 00:28:14,305
14th of January, I remember.

310
00:28:14,478 --> 00:28:16,275
He came to my birthday party.

311
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,840
This was his last letter to me.

312
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:34,059
I shouldn't have let Wilson drank so much.

313
00:28:34,331 --> 00:28:36,231
Shouldn't have let him onto that taxi.

314
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:44,139
I'm sorry. If Wilson got back to Taiwan

315
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,170
I'm sure you two would have made up.

316
00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:48,504
It's not your fault.

317
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:51,478
I want to thank you.

318
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,079
Waited for me to arrange Wilson's memorial.

319
00:28:56,086 --> 00:29:00,580
He's lucky to have friends like you.

320
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:02,492
Our pleasures.

321
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:07,027
That woman..

322
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:10,130
They've broken up a long time ago.

323
00:29:10,568 --> 00:29:12,331
I know Wilson didn't love her.

324
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:17,339
Set A.

325
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:18,303
Thanks.

326
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,599
Let's eat.

327
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:23,979
What will you be doing?

328
00:29:24,782 --> 00:29:27,216
I know what to do with the memorial.

329
00:29:31,322 --> 00:29:32,084
Did you like the food?

330
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:33,221
Yes.

331
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:36,053
We'll come again then.

332
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:41,531
Alice,

333
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:43,792
I need to pay some bills first.

334
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:46,434
It's okay, I remember the way.

335
00:29:47,671 --> 00:29:50,105
I'm happy seeing you happy again.

336
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:52,207
Thank you.

337
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,877
See you.

338
00:29:54,144 --> 00:29:55,008
See you.

339
00:30:08,692 --> 00:30:09,624
Hello!

340
00:30:37,321 --> 00:30:38,549
I've bought dinner.

341
00:30:39,657 --> 00:30:40,555
Come on in.

342
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:48,029
Do you like it?

343
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:51,227
Then eat some more.

344
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:59,270
Don't you think it's cold here?

345
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:03,812
Maybe it's just your head.

346
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:07,349
Maybe.

347
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:17,250
So what are you going to do
with these stuffs?

348
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:21,054
Haven't decided yet, any ideas?

349
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:26,460
They are Wilson's memories, you decide.

350
00:31:27,204 --> 00:31:30,401
Why didn't his parents take his belongings?

351
00:31:32,576 --> 00:31:35,044
Because his relationship
with them wasn't good.

352
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:39,880
Yes, that's what I thought.

353
00:31:42,219 --> 00:31:46,087
But...hasn't it changed at all?

354
00:31:46,957 --> 00:31:48,891
After all, they are a family.

355
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:55,928
Why aren't you saying anything?

356
00:31:59,203 --> 00:32:00,135
Alice

357
00:32:01,572 --> 00:32:03,938
You should know his father has passed away.

358
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:05,733
Of course.

359
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:09,675
You don't seem to know his mum
was his step mum either.

360
00:32:15,252 --> 00:32:17,186
Do you remember
what you said the other day?

361
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,585
Were his parents upset that I wasn't there?

362
00:32:24,962 --> 00:32:27,362
Alice, what are you not telling us?

363
00:32:31,802 --> 00:32:36,899
Since the accident,
I've forgotten a lot of things.

364
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:41,935
I don't remember Wilson,
I don't remember who I am.

365
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,678
You wouldn't know the pain of amnesia.

366
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:54,586
It's like the world have left you
behind with nothing.

367
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:58,551
Everything, every person...

368
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,098
Becomes alienated.

369
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:05,397
Until you guys found me.

370
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,804
And told me

371
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:14,067
My boyfriend is dead.

372
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,375
But...

373
00:33:22,886 --> 00:33:26,151
I don't even remember what he looks like.

374
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:30,089
I only knew I had to come back.

375
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:35,526
Only through this...

376
00:33:37,734 --> 00:33:40,100
I can find my memories

377
00:33:41,972 --> 00:33:44,406
I can find myself

378
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,937
I didn't lie to you guys on purpose.

379
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:54,809
I'm just not brave enough
to tell the truth.

380
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:58,386
I'm sorry.

381
00:33:58,555 --> 00:34:01,490
You're so silly, you didn't have to lie.

382
00:34:01,658 --> 00:34:03,888
We're friends, we would have helped you.

383
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:07,454
Can you promise me one thing?

384
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:08,029
What is it?

385
00:34:08,198 --> 00:34:10,166
Help me keep this secret, okay?

386
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:11,596
Why?

387
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:14,032
Because I don't want to scare the others.

388
00:34:16,173 --> 00:34:17,868
But more importantly...

389
00:34:19,243 --> 00:34:22,235
I have remembered
many of my memories with Wilson.

390
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,209
Look at it another way...

391
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:28,849
Isn't this better?

392
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:35,816
All I remember is the good times with him.

393
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:39,261
Nothing else matters

394
00:34:41,298 --> 00:34:42,560
Don't you think?

395
00:34:43,867 --> 00:34:44,856
Promise me.

396
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:33,358
Wilson, is it you?

397
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:34,761
Wilson!

398
00:40:27,444 --> 00:40:28,741
Are you sure you're not imagining things?

399
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:30,973
I don't know.

400
00:40:32,115 --> 00:40:34,208
If you're scared, you can move to a hotel.

401
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:37,676
I still miss Wilson.

402
00:40:39,623 --> 00:40:40,988
You really miss him this much?

403
00:40:41,424 --> 00:40:43,415
The longer I stay in the flat

404
00:40:44,628 --> 00:40:46,789
The more I feel he's with me.

405
00:40:46,963 --> 00:40:50,421
Sometimes I think,
if he does come back to see me...

406
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:53,999
I want to see him too.

407
00:40:54,638 --> 00:40:59,200
After all, he is my boyfriend.

408
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,903
I shouldn't be scare of him.

409
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,940
Are you kidding?

410
00:41:05,415 --> 00:41:07,508
I just want him to see me once more.

411
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:12,252
Now you scare me.

412
00:41:15,926 --> 00:41:16,654
Where?

413
00:41:16,826 --> 00:41:17,554
Over there.

414
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:21,894
What should we have?

415
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:22,793
Set B.

416
00:41:24,134 --> 00:41:25,465
-Morning. -Morning.

417
00:41:25,635 --> 00:41:26,897
Stop talking, come on.

418
00:41:30,273 --> 00:41:32,867
This? Why don't you eat me?

419
00:41:33,877 --> 00:41:35,469
You're so bad.

420
00:41:35,712 --> 00:41:36,474
Don't you like it?

421
00:41:36,646 --> 00:41:38,170
I like food more right now.

422
00:41:38,348 --> 00:41:39,212
You know them?

423
00:41:41,851 --> 00:41:43,079
No.

424
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,354
Tell me, who was that woman?

425
00:41:49,893 --> 00:41:52,794
Just leave, I need to rent the flat out.

426
00:41:52,963 --> 00:41:54,453
You can't stay here anymore.

427
00:41:55,365 --> 00:41:57,890
What have I done wrong,
for you to kick me out?

428
00:41:58,068 --> 00:42:00,059
Do you need me to die for you?

429
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:02,002
I'm sorry.

430
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:04,536
I know you will be upset by this.

431
00:42:04,808 --> 00:42:07,936
But holding on is no good to anyone.

432
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:10,443
I'll rather die than move out!

433
00:42:43,813 --> 00:42:46,043
Bastard! Kicked me out.

434
00:42:50,754 --> 00:42:52,187
Why don't you come in.

435
00:43:07,437 --> 00:43:10,497
Aren't you tired of crying?

436
00:43:10,707 --> 00:43:12,140
Just leave me alone.

437
00:43:16,379 --> 00:43:17,710
How about some TV.

438
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:33,251
What's wrong?

439
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:36,660
Don't bother.

440
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:39,397
The receptions in old buildings
are always like this.

441
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:40,934
You live here for long?

442
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:43,372
Just longer than you.

443
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:49,637
You've seen me?

444
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,010
You and your boyfriend moved in last year.

445
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:57,811
What's wrong?

446
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:02,818
You've broken up with your boyfriend?

447
00:44:05,995 --> 00:44:07,690
He has gone away...

448
00:44:08,531 --> 00:44:10,726
You have to keep an eye on your man

449
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,767
If not he might turn out like mine.

450
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:15,534
Yours?

451
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:18,563
He has another woman.

452
00:44:19,008 --> 00:44:19,770
You know?

453
00:44:19,943 --> 00:44:23,003
Men always think they are great liars

454
00:44:23,446 --> 00:44:25,744
The fact is, we like to listen to lies.

455
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:28,812
But we don't like to be con by them.

456
00:44:29,185 --> 00:44:31,016
If you know he has someone else,

457
00:44:31,187 --> 00:44:32,518
why are you still with him?

458
00:44:34,224 --> 00:44:36,249
Because I'm also his other woman.

459
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,790
You too?

460
00:44:37,961 --> 00:44:38,950
When you know your man

461
00:44:39,129 --> 00:44:40,687
has many other women.

462
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:45,026
You just hope to be the second one.

463
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:47,066
Not the third, the forth or the fifth.

464
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,467
Why all the commotions
if you are so cool about it?

465
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,369
He wants that woman to move in

466
00:44:52,775 --> 00:44:56,211
The flat is mine, no one can kick me out!

467
00:45:01,885 --> 00:45:03,750
Can you let me stay here tonight?

468
00:45:04,154 --> 00:45:05,348
Just one night.

469
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:07,847
I'll go back when he goes to work tomorrow.

470
00:45:08,758 --> 00:45:11,022
Don't you think he'll get worry?

471
00:45:11,661 --> 00:45:14,630
I'm sure he's sleeping
with the other woman now.

472
00:45:15,565 --> 00:45:17,089
Then stay.

473
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:20,092
Excellent, I'm not fussy.

474
00:45:20,503 --> 00:45:22,027
I can sleep here.

475
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,375
Do you think...

476
00:45:28,578 --> 00:45:31,911
It's getting colder in here?

477
00:45:32,515 --> 00:45:33,607
You feel it too?

478
00:45:35,285 --> 00:45:36,115
I think, there's...

479
00:45:36,286 --> 00:45:38,754
Don't...I'm a big chicken.

480
00:45:40,557 --> 00:45:41,956
Can you get me a duvet?

481
00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:59,569
Come on, hurry up!

482
00:46:04,113 --> 00:46:06,741
My Dear, thank you for letting me
stayed last night.

483
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:09,851
My name is Mandy,
I don't know your name yet.

484
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:11,778
But I'm sure the chance will come.

485
00:46:17,894 --> 00:46:20,954
Aren't you scare
your girlfriend might find out?

486
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:23,325
How about you,
aren't you scare of your boyfriend?

487
00:46:24,434 --> 00:46:26,425
Scare? He's not in Hong Kong.

488
00:46:26,603 --> 00:46:28,969
Excellent, then we can have some fun.

489
00:46:33,243 --> 00:46:34,471
You're so bad.

490
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:47,381
Let's skip dinner.

491
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,280
Where should we go then?

492
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:50,657
My place.

493
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,222
Your place again?

494
00:46:52,662 --> 00:46:53,686
You don't want to?

495
00:46:59,068 --> 00:46:59,864
Stop!

496
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:02,663
Don't run!

497
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,504
Who is it?

498
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:05,830
She lives above me.

499
00:47:07,443 --> 00:47:10,276
Wait for me! Stop!

500
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,467
I don't want to go home, can I come in?

501
00:47:41,744 --> 00:47:43,644
Do you think I'm stupid and useless?

502
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:46,407
Why?

503
00:47:47,483 --> 00:47:50,008
I shouldn't be the one who ran away today.

504
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:52,015
I didn't do anything wrong.

505
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:57,357
You wouldn't let go if you didn't see it.

506
00:47:58,528 --> 00:48:03,693
But learning the truth,
ended up hurting myself.

507
00:48:06,135 --> 00:48:08,968
You need to be brave to handle the truth.

508
00:48:11,207 --> 00:48:13,402
You sound like an expert.

509
00:48:14,744 --> 00:48:17,474
I'm in a similar situation.

510
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,110
I'm also investigating my boyfriend.

511
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:22,680
He has another woman too?

512
00:48:26,356 --> 00:48:27,448
He's dead.

513
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:33,986
I don't remember anything about Wilson.

514
00:48:35,164 --> 00:48:39,567
So I came back to search
for memories of us.

515
00:48:41,804 --> 00:48:43,203
It's good if you remember.

516
00:48:44,374 --> 00:48:46,399
But don't force yourself.

517
00:48:46,576 --> 00:48:48,601
You don't think I should?

518
00:48:49,078 --> 00:48:51,342
There used to be someone who loved me.

519
00:48:51,748 --> 00:48:53,443
When I met him,

520
00:48:53,616 --> 00:48:55,243
he was already in a relationship.

521
00:48:56,052 --> 00:48:59,351
So I told him, we can't be a couple.

522
00:49:00,456 --> 00:49:02,822
But we can be backup lovers.

523
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:06,287
At first, we were happy.

524
00:49:06,562 --> 00:49:09,588
But one day, he told me

525
00:49:09,899 --> 00:49:13,164
He doesn't want to be backup,
he wants the real deal.

526
00:49:13,336 --> 00:49:15,930
So I told him, a relationship needs timing

527
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:18,298
If the timing is wrong, then it's rubbish.

528
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:23,403
So after going away with him, we broke up.

529
00:49:24,847 --> 00:49:27,680
I lied to him about getting married.

530
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:29,009
And told him not to contact me.

531
00:49:29,185 --> 00:49:31,745
Why did you lie? He loved you.

532
00:49:31,954 --> 00:49:33,979
Because he was too good.

533
00:49:35,057 --> 00:49:38,857
Good things never last for long

534
00:49:39,796 --> 00:49:42,788
I'd rather it ended
before anything goes wrong.

535
00:49:44,133 --> 00:49:46,727
So everyone can go away with good memories.

536
00:49:46,903 --> 00:49:49,133
Since your boyfriend is so bad

537
00:49:49,372 --> 00:49:51,670
Why don't you go back to him?

538
00:49:52,442 --> 00:49:55,934
I'd rather he thinks
I'm having a good time...

539
00:49:56,779 --> 00:49:58,110
That'd be enough.

540
00:49:58,714 --> 00:50:00,113
No regrets?

541
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:03,182
I chose the path, no one's to blame.

542
00:50:03,553 --> 00:50:06,317
It's like going on a diet

543
00:50:06,756 --> 00:50:08,553
But ask how can I stop being hungry,

544
00:50:08,724 --> 00:50:09,554
right?

545
00:50:09,725 --> 00:50:11,659
That's a funny way to put it.

546
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:15,058
Remember, it doesn't hurt
if you don't know it.

547
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:17,296
It doesn't hurt if you don't know it?

548
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,591
Memories are not only from the past.

549
00:50:19,902 --> 00:50:21,733
You can collect them from now on.

550
00:50:22,104 --> 00:50:25,073
Gosh, I'm hungry,
can I have something to eat?

551
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:27,399
Noodles?

552
00:50:29,111 --> 00:50:30,408
Watch TV.

553
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:36,979
It's fuzzy again?

554
00:50:41,824 --> 00:50:42,620
It's done.

555
00:50:43,326 --> 00:50:44,588
My boyfriend's home, see you.

556
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,556
Hey!

557
00:50:48,264 --> 00:50:49,595
I thought she was hungry.

558
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:55,728
Why are you back?

559
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:58,132
I told you, I've got a girlfriend.

560
00:50:58,407 --> 00:50:59,601
I'm not going to leave.

561
00:50:59,775 --> 00:51:01,902
So don't bring another woman here!

562
00:51:02,078 --> 00:51:03,943
Please, let me go.

563
00:51:04,113 --> 00:51:05,705
What do I have to do?

564
00:51:05,882 --> 00:51:07,679
I can let go of everything...

565
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,044
Except for you!

566
00:51:09,285 --> 00:51:10,252
You're not letting me go?

567
00:51:10,419 --> 00:51:11,477
Then I'll never come back again!

568
00:51:16,726 --> 00:51:17,488
I have to go.

569
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:18,922
Ok, take care.

570
00:51:19,495 --> 00:51:20,120
Don't get upset, okay?

571
00:51:20,296 --> 00:51:21,160
Call us when you guys get back.

572
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:22,297
You too.

573
00:51:22,498 --> 00:51:24,864
-Bye-bye. -Bye-bye.

574
00:51:25,201 --> 00:51:26,600
Let's go to Karaoke this Saturday.

575
00:51:26,836 --> 00:51:28,531
Yeah, call that guy too.

576
00:51:28,704 --> 00:51:29,398
Of course.

577
00:51:29,572 --> 00:51:30,596
Let's go, it's boring.

578
00:51:30,773 --> 00:51:31,398
Your brother?

579
00:51:31,574 --> 00:51:33,041
My husband.

580
00:51:33,209 --> 00:51:34,767
Make it a date for the next funeral.

581
00:51:54,964 --> 00:51:55,862
You okay?

582
00:51:58,668 --> 00:51:59,930
Everyone's left.

583
00:52:02,538 --> 00:52:03,698
They were all touched.

584
00:52:04,674 --> 00:52:06,301
They said it was a nice memorial.

585
00:52:07,243 --> 00:52:09,108
We all did our parts.

586
00:52:12,782 --> 00:52:15,012
Regen said you'll go back to Taiwan
in a couple of days.

587
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:18,554
Why don't you stay longer?

588
00:52:19,522 --> 00:52:23,117
I've done what I came to do,
I want to go home.

589
00:52:23,426 --> 00:52:24,859
I miss my grandma.

590
00:52:27,863 --> 00:52:29,592
Will you come back to visit us?

591
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:32,099
I'll see how my school works go.

592
00:52:32,368 --> 00:52:34,893
I'm going to study again after the summer.

593
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:40,436
If it wasn't for the accident,
I'd have graduated already.

594
00:52:42,712 --> 00:52:44,771
The most important thing is
that you are safe.

595
00:52:49,151 --> 00:52:50,812
You can come visit me in Taiwan.

596
00:52:52,054 --> 00:52:52,850
Really?

597
00:52:54,657 --> 00:52:56,522
Alice, Wilson's photos are all here.

598
00:52:56,692 --> 00:52:58,057
Thank you, I'll take them.

599
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:03,088
What are you going to do with them?

600
00:53:04,533 --> 00:53:06,501
Can I keep them as a memory?

601
00:53:08,437 --> 00:53:10,632
Of course, you are his girlfriend.

602
00:53:11,407 --> 00:53:12,339
Thank you.

603
00:53:13,009 --> 00:53:14,874
I'll take them downstairs.

604
00:54:16,706 --> 00:54:17,468
Who is it?

605
00:55:56,205 --> 00:55:58,139
The memorial was so successful.

606
00:55:58,307 --> 00:56:00,639
Why don't we get some food.

607
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,175
Yeah

608
00:56:03,879 --> 00:56:05,210
How come all the photos are on the floor?

609
00:56:05,481 --> 00:56:05,879
I don't know...

610
00:56:06,048 --> 00:56:07,948
Wilson's back! He's back!

611
00:56:08,284 --> 00:56:10,514
Come on, Wilson... he's dead.

612
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,913
He's really back, go and see for yourself.

613
00:56:13,088 --> 00:56:14,783
I'm not scare, I'll go.

614
00:56:14,957 --> 00:56:16,117
Terence...

615
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:18,453
I've never seen a ghost before.

616
00:56:20,296 --> 00:56:22,526
Ghost!

617
00:56:22,698 --> 00:56:23,426
Come on...

618
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,931
No, I'm scare...

619
00:56:26,135 --> 00:56:27,227
Is it really Wilson?

620
00:56:27,403 --> 00:56:28,301
Wilson's back?

621
00:56:28,604 --> 00:56:31,198
Nothing's here, look for yourself.

622
00:56:31,874 --> 00:56:33,865
Maybe we can see him, come on.

623
00:56:35,778 --> 00:56:37,439
I saw him in here.

624
00:56:38,013 --> 00:56:40,413
I'm telling the truth, I'm not lying.

625
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:41,015
He really was here...

626
00:56:41,183 --> 00:56:41,945
Then where is he

627
00:56:42,117 --> 00:56:43,243
Anything would be nice

628
00:56:46,388 --> 00:56:48,322
-He was right there... -Alice

629
00:56:49,058 --> 00:56:50,685
You're tired, get some sleep

630
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,828
- We'll talk tomorrow.
#NAME?

631
00:56:53,662 --> 00:56:54,924
He really was here.

632
00:56:55,197 --> 00:56:56,391
He did come back!

633
00:56:56,565 --> 00:56:59,329
You guys go in and take a look, he's back.

634
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:01,332
Take a look, I'm not lying.

635
00:57:01,503 --> 00:57:02,970
Alice...Alice!

636
00:57:03,138 --> 00:57:03,627
It's real!

637
00:57:03,806 --> 00:57:05,933
Calm down, it's your imagination

638
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:07,706
Wilson is dead.

639
00:57:08,444 --> 00:57:09,342
He's not dead!

640
00:57:11,046 --> 00:57:14,277
He's not dead, I'm telling the truth.

641
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:17,312
He came back, he came back to see me.

642
00:57:18,587 --> 00:57:21,317
He is here, go in and have a look.

643
00:57:22,224 --> 00:57:24,351
Why don't you guys believe me?

644
00:57:25,561 --> 00:57:27,188
He's really here.

645
00:57:28,664 --> 00:57:30,655
- Come on, take a look.
#NAME?

646
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:35,760
Even you don't believe me?!

647
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,203
Wilson, they don't believe me.

648
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:42,775
Come out.

649
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,841
Wilson, come out.

650
00:57:47,316 --> 00:57:50,911
Please come out, I miss you...

651
00:57:51,987 --> 00:57:53,045
Alice!

652
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,830
Take some pills and go to sleep.

653
00:58:08,637 --> 00:58:09,001
Alice,

654
00:58:09,171 --> 00:58:11,935
we are all worry about you.

655
00:58:12,975 --> 00:58:13,907
I don't want to sleep.

656
00:58:15,678 --> 00:58:16,940
I want to see Wilson again.

657
00:58:17,112 --> 00:58:18,272
It's your imagination.

658
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,007
Wilson was back, he came back...

659
00:58:22,184 --> 00:58:24,812
Wilson's dead! Just accept it!

660
00:58:28,624 --> 00:58:32,025
Wilson's dead...

661
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:36,729
Wilson's dead...

662
00:58:37,933 --> 00:58:39,958
Wilson's dead...

663
00:58:42,071 --> 00:58:44,266
But I've only seen him once

664
00:58:46,842 --> 00:58:49,003
That was the first time I've seen him...

665
00:58:50,312 --> 00:58:52,246
And it was the last time.

666
00:58:52,881 --> 00:58:54,746
Even though it was just a glance.

667
00:58:56,218 --> 00:58:59,346
But my memories with him all came back.

668
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:04,056
I know I still love him.

669
00:59:05,594 --> 00:59:07,289
I still miss him.

670
00:59:09,932 --> 00:59:11,365
Do you know I still love him?

671
00:59:11,533 --> 00:59:12,557
Alice...

672
00:59:16,472 --> 00:59:18,372
Wilson is not a good person.

673
00:59:19,508 --> 00:59:21,100
What are you saying?

674
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:22,836
Where are you taking me?

675
00:59:23,345 --> 00:59:24,573
I'm taking you to see someone.

676
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,076
Who?

677
00:59:26,348 --> 00:59:27,076
Someone who'll tell the secrets...

678
00:59:27,249 --> 00:59:28,876
Wilson has hidden from you.

679
00:59:29,618 --> 00:59:31,176
No business.

680
00:59:32,554 --> 00:59:35,045
Bitch! What do you want coming here?

681
00:59:35,224 --> 00:59:36,213
- You killed Wilson... - Calm down...

682
00:59:36,392 --> 00:59:37,484
It's your fault!

683
00:59:38,027 --> 00:59:39,688
You stole him from me...

684
00:59:39,862 --> 00:59:40,726
Stop it!

685
00:59:40,896 --> 00:59:41,885
Give me back my husband!

686
00:59:42,064 --> 00:59:43,031
Stop it will you...

687
00:59:43,198 --> 00:59:45,632
Miss, I think you've made a mistake,
he was my boyfriend.

688
00:59:45,801 --> 00:59:48,565
Stop pretending!
If it wasn't for you, he would be alive.

689
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:52,263
You stole him, he died because of you...

690
00:59:52,975 --> 00:59:55,671
-I want my husband! -Let's go

691
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:57,903
Ask the man with you, see if I am lying.

692
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,206
Bitch!

693
00:59:59,848 --> 01:00:02,908
Tell me, if she was telling the truth?

694
01:00:03,118 --> 01:00:04,449
It's all in the past.

695
01:00:06,288 --> 01:00:07,915
Tell me! If it's true?

696
01:00:08,991 --> 01:00:10,151
Is it?

697
01:00:12,594 --> 01:00:14,391
Your boyfriend was never stolen from you.

698
01:00:15,397 --> 01:00:16,295
Because it was...

699
01:00:16,465 --> 01:00:18,057
you who stole her boyfriend.

700
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:20,567
Wilson and Maggie
has been together for 5 years

701
01:00:21,003 --> 01:00:22,300
Planning to get married.

702
01:00:22,771 --> 01:00:25,001
But 2 years ago,
Wilson changed after he met you.

703
01:00:25,174 --> 01:00:26,505
And split up with Maggie right away.

704
01:00:27,342 --> 01:00:29,207
Maggie tried suicide many times,

705
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:31,103
so Wilson went back to her.

706
01:00:31,647 --> 01:00:34,844
You found out

707
01:00:35,017 --> 01:00:36,348
and went back to Taiwan.

708
01:00:37,219 --> 01:00:41,212
Wilson didn't know what to do,
and was very upset.

709
01:00:42,424 --> 01:00:43,288
Then?

710
01:00:45,461 --> 01:00:48,328
Well... he soon met another girl.

711
01:00:49,531 --> 01:00:50,964
He needed a breather,

712
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,090
it wasn't anything serious.

713
01:00:53,902 --> 01:00:55,529
He said he wanted to find you,

714
01:00:55,804 --> 01:00:57,601
but only when he was drunk.

715
01:00:58,107 --> 01:01:01,634
The next day
he just carried on meeting girls.

716
01:01:02,544 --> 01:01:07,004
His last letter,
it says he'll come and find me.

717
01:01:07,416 --> 01:01:08,474
Is it true?

718
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:12,609
He's not here,
a lot of questions will go unanswered.

719
01:01:13,288 --> 01:01:17,725
Am I stupid, that I still miss him?

720
01:01:17,893 --> 01:01:20,157
I shouldn't have told you the truth.

721
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:24,799
I want you to have good memories of Wilson

722
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:27,865
But I don't want you to look like you did.

723
01:01:28,971 --> 01:01:31,132
Dwelling in a dead relationship.

724
01:01:32,474 --> 01:01:34,237
Alice, you still have a second chance

725
01:01:35,511 --> 01:01:39,379
To live and to love someone else.

726
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:42,883
Second chance?

727
01:01:44,419 --> 01:01:47,149
I don't even know who I am.

728
01:01:47,356 --> 01:01:48,084
You'll be whoever

729
01:01:48,257 --> 01:01:49,781
you think you should be.

730
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,325
Only you can decide that.

731
01:01:54,696 --> 01:01:56,857
I've already talked too much

732
01:01:59,067 --> 01:01:59,931
I should go.

733
01:02:05,274 --> 01:02:06,104
Andy

734
01:02:09,478 --> 01:02:10,410
Thank you

735
01:02:14,683 --> 01:02:16,947
Cheers

736
01:02:17,753 --> 01:02:18,583
Cheers

737
01:02:22,257 --> 01:02:23,554
Have you packed?

738
01:02:23,759 --> 01:02:24,487
Yes.

739
01:02:25,227 --> 01:02:26,626
I'll take you to the airport tomorrow.

740
01:02:26,862 --> 01:02:27,556
Okay.

741
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,030
Alice, when will you come back?

742
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,292
We'll miss you.

743
01:02:32,467 --> 01:02:33,456
Me too.

744
01:02:34,102 --> 01:02:35,933
Why don't you stay a bit longer?

745
01:02:36,104 --> 01:02:37,765
You guys can visit me in Taiwan.

746
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,737
We can eat hotpot and go to hot spring spa.

747
01:02:39,908 --> 01:02:41,136
Yeah!

748
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,641
Do man and woman bathe together?

749
01:02:42,811 --> 01:02:45,439
I'm very open minded, I wouldn't mind.

750
01:02:46,448 --> 01:02:48,541
Wake up, it's separated.

751
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:50,750
Hear that? You pervert.

752
01:02:50,919 --> 01:02:51,442
What? You're the pervert.

753
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:52,917
Can we take some photos together?

754
01:02:53,155 --> 01:02:54,383
Of course.

755
01:02:54,556 --> 01:02:57,150
It's not like
we never took photos together before.

756
01:02:57,392 --> 01:02:58,416
It's different this time.

757
01:02:59,194 --> 01:03:00,183
What's the difference?

758
01:03:02,231 --> 01:03:03,721
I've lost the old ones.

759
01:03:03,899 --> 01:03:06,299
Want some new ones to keep.

760
01:03:06,468 --> 01:03:07,799
Well...

761
01:03:10,806 --> 01:03:11,431
Let's take some photos.

762
01:03:11,607 --> 01:03:12,869
-No camera. -I haven't brought mine.

763
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:13,871
Oh yeah.

764
01:03:14,142 --> 01:03:15,006
I have one.

765
01:03:26,221 --> 01:03:27,017
Alice

766
01:03:28,757 --> 01:03:29,655
Wilson

767
01:03:30,525 --> 01:03:34,859
I'm sorry, I made a mistake,
will you forgive me?

768
01:03:37,132 --> 01:03:42,331
I didn't blame you,
I've forgotten what's happened.

769
01:03:44,706 --> 01:03:45,798
You have to promise me.

770
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:49,836
Live your life to the fullest.

771
01:03:50,345 --> 01:03:51,437
Forget about me.

772
01:03:56,518 --> 01:03:57,576
I can't...

773
01:03:57,753 --> 01:03:59,311
We live in two different worlds.

774
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,722
I'm glad you are safe.

775
01:04:03,592 --> 01:04:06,527
I think I can leave now.

776
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:11,597
Take care, bye.

777
01:04:39,161 --> 01:04:40,219
Mandy.

778
01:04:43,565 --> 01:04:44,657
Mandy

779
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:57,943
Dearest Mandy, I'm leaving

780
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:02,282
This is my Taiwan address,
come visit if you are free.

781
01:05:17,165 --> 01:05:18,962
Alice, I need to talk to you.

782
01:05:22,471 --> 01:05:23,460
What is it?

783
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,364
Aren't we going to the airport?

784
01:05:27,376 --> 01:05:29,207
You came back to search for memories

785
01:05:29,978 --> 01:05:31,775
But do you remember how we met?

786
01:05:33,715 --> 01:05:35,740
Hey, do you see her?

787
01:05:36,284 --> 01:05:38,718
Not bad eh? I want to meet her.

788
01:05:39,254 --> 01:05:40,243
You have a girlfriend.

789
01:05:40,422 --> 01:05:43,220
So? there's nothing wrong
meeting a new friend.

790
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:44,821
She will ignore you.

791
01:05:44,993 --> 01:05:46,722
Wait...

792
01:05:47,362 --> 01:05:49,262
Do you have a coin? Heads or tails.

793
01:05:49,464 --> 01:05:51,694
Whoever wins goes in to ask for her number.

794
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,499
Lost you phone trick again?

795
01:05:53,802 --> 01:05:54,928
Come on.

796
01:05:57,939 --> 01:05:58,633
Heads.

797
01:06:03,345 --> 01:06:04,812
Excuse me, miss.

798
01:06:05,313 --> 01:06:08,111
Can I borrow your phone,
there's no battery left in mine?

799
01:06:08,316 --> 01:06:10,045
I need to call my friend urgently.

800
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,378
Thank you.

801
01:06:21,396 --> 01:06:22,556
So?

802
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,789
Where are you?

803
01:06:26,268 --> 01:06:27,132
Outside.

804
01:06:27,302 --> 01:06:29,031
Come on, can you see me?

805
01:06:29,604 --> 01:06:30,798
There you are, come in.

806
01:06:33,241 --> 01:06:35,072
Andy, come on, sit down.

807
01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:38,169
She's my girlfriend, Alice.

808
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,438
#NAME?

809
01:06:39,781 --> 01:06:41,646
He's my best friend, Andy.

810
01:06:41,883 --> 01:06:43,373
That was the first time I met you.

811
01:06:44,152 --> 01:06:47,553
You wanted to meet me like he did?

812
01:06:50,525 --> 01:06:51,787
Only he made the move first.

813
01:06:54,062 --> 01:06:55,791
I'm not as lucky as Wilson.

814
01:06:56,698 --> 01:06:58,893
Every time we bet, I lose.

815
01:07:00,402 --> 01:07:04,304
Did you think about telling me
he has a girlfriend?

816
01:07:05,073 --> 01:07:08,600
I couldn't do it, he was my best friend.

817
01:07:08,777 --> 01:07:10,039
Wilson being so smart.

818
01:07:10,912 --> 01:07:12,812
There's no way he didn't know
what you thought.

819
01:07:13,482 --> 01:07:14,710
That's why he asked me out.

820
01:07:16,251 --> 01:07:18,151
To let me know you two are together.

821
01:07:22,691 --> 01:07:23,851
You're so silly.

822
01:07:24,993 --> 01:07:26,654
So when you decided to leave.

823
01:07:28,096 --> 01:07:29,529
I said to myself,

824
01:07:29,831 --> 01:07:31,765
I'm not going to miss the second chance.

825
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:34,335
There's something I have to ask you...

826
01:07:36,938 --> 01:07:38,872
Alice, can you stay?

827
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:41,030
Stay?

828
01:07:42,744 --> 01:07:43,642
I know I will never replace...

829
01:07:43,812 --> 01:07:45,712
Wilson in your heart.

830
01:07:47,883 --> 01:07:49,646
You two are perfect together.

831
01:07:50,919 --> 01:07:52,284
But maybe,

832
01:07:52,587 --> 01:07:54,555
there's no such thing as perfect.

833
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:58,215
There might be someone
who's exactly the same as you.

834
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,525
But fate can separate them.

835
01:08:01,296 --> 01:08:04,060
Even if you do meet,
there can be changes too.

836
01:08:04,232 --> 01:08:07,861
What's important is that
you are sure with your decision.

837
01:08:08,637 --> 01:08:10,332
Then he will be the one.

838
01:08:14,609 --> 01:08:16,406
So I wasn't going to miss this chance.

839
01:08:17,712 --> 01:08:21,148
Alice, I want you to stay.

840
01:08:22,884 --> 01:08:26,183
Because this is the chance for us
to know each other.

841
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:40,156
Let's go.

842
01:08:42,771 --> 01:08:44,671
I will not forget Wilson.

843
01:08:46,474 --> 01:08:48,738
Because he's my past.

844
01:08:50,712 --> 01:08:55,240
Forgetting him, will be forgetting my past.

845
01:08:57,819 --> 01:08:59,013
The thing is...

846
01:09:01,323 --> 01:09:04,053
We can't forget about the past

847
01:09:06,294 --> 01:09:09,195
We need to take the past forward.

848
01:09:12,567 --> 01:09:13,659
I think...

849
01:09:14,636 --> 01:09:18,231
You will be with me for that, right?

850
01:09:20,609 --> 01:09:22,907
Right, definitely.

851
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:25,673
Shall we drive on?

852
01:09:26,314 --> 01:09:29,511
There's a lot to buy if I'm staying.

853
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:42,958
Hey...

854
01:09:43,365 --> 01:09:44,229
Hi.

855
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:47,232
Where's your girlfriend today?

856
01:09:47,836 --> 01:09:48,700
She's busy.

857
01:09:49,304 --> 01:09:51,636
I thought you said the two of you
have broken up.

858
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,137
How come you two...

859
01:09:53,308 --> 01:09:55,003
were together again?

860
01:09:55,377 --> 01:09:57,641
No wonder you're so happy.

861
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,681
Talk next time, I'm in a rush, see you.

862
01:10:03,718 --> 01:10:05,549
Come again when you have time

863
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,709
Wilson!

864
01:10:09,524 --> 01:10:11,082
9 Months Ago

865
01:10:11,259 --> 01:10:13,022
Taiwan

866
01:10:21,403 --> 01:10:21,960
Stop there!

867
01:10:22,137 --> 01:10:22,694
What are you doing here?

868
01:10:22,871 --> 01:10:23,769
Alice doesn't want to see you.

869
01:10:24,005 --> 01:10:25,029
Can I see her?

870
01:10:25,473 --> 01:10:28,033
She wouldn't be like this
if you didn't lie to her!

871
01:10:28,376 --> 01:10:30,344
She hasn't been happy since she came back,

872
01:10:30,512 --> 01:10:31,570
what do you want?

873
01:10:31,946 --> 01:10:35,109
Grandma, I'm sorry, I really love Alice.

874
01:10:35,417 --> 01:10:36,975
I won't let you see her.

875
01:10:37,352 --> 01:10:39,479
Go, you're not welcome here.

876
01:10:40,055 --> 01:10:40,987
Did you not hear? Go!

877
01:10:41,156 --> 01:10:41,781
Now!

878
01:10:41,956 --> 01:10:43,514
Get lost! Go!

879
01:10:52,767 --> 01:10:55,258
Doctor...Why is Alice like this?

880
01:10:55,437 --> 01:10:57,234
She doesn't remember anything but me.

881
01:10:57,472 --> 01:10:59,838
After the car crash,

882
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:01,838
there's a blood clot in her brain

883
01:11:02,043 --> 01:11:03,908
Causing this memory lost.

884
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:05,876
Amnesia? Will she get better?

885
01:11:06,047 --> 01:11:08,447
It's hard to say from her
current condition.

886
01:11:08,683 --> 01:11:11,743
A lot of patients become better...

887
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,444
After a year or so.

888
01:11:13,722 --> 01:11:14,450
Grandma

889
01:11:19,127 --> 01:11:20,492
What are you doing here?

890
01:11:20,929 --> 01:11:21,827
I'm here to see Alice.

891
01:11:22,063 --> 01:11:24,657
It's you, it's your fault

892
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:26,460
That Alice doesn't remember anything.

893
01:11:26,801 --> 01:11:29,031
Get lost,
I don't want you hurting her again.

894
01:11:30,138 --> 01:11:31,400
Please let me stay with Alice,

895
01:11:31,806 --> 01:11:33,535
I can help her.

896
01:11:33,742 --> 01:11:34,731
Let her come back to Hong Kong

897
01:11:34,909 --> 01:11:36,399
She has a lot of friends there
that can help her.

898
01:11:36,578 --> 01:11:39,012
Wake up, I won't let her remember you.

899
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:40,340
Why are you so harsh on me?

900
01:11:40,982 --> 01:11:43,382
I beg you, what do I have to do for her
to come back?

901
01:11:43,551 --> 01:11:44,575
Only if you die.

902
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,813
If you are dead,
I'll let her come and see you.

903
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:50,851
That grandma is such a bitch.

904
01:11:51,025 --> 01:11:53,118
No big deal if Alice doesn't come back.

905
01:11:53,728 --> 01:11:55,491
Don't get upset,

906
01:11:55,663 --> 01:11:56,891
there's nothing great about her.

907
01:11:57,465 --> 01:11:59,797
Yeah, she's not your only girl.

908
01:12:00,068 --> 01:12:03,094
She's not exactly your favourite?

909
01:12:04,472 --> 01:12:05,939
But I really like her.

910
01:12:06,908 --> 01:12:09,672
I need her, you know?

911
01:12:09,978 --> 01:12:11,411
The grandma said
she won't let you see her.

912
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:13,206
What are you going to do, die?

913
01:12:15,316 --> 01:12:16,442
What if I do die?

914
01:12:16,985 --> 01:12:18,179
You're kidding right?

915
01:12:18,353 --> 01:12:19,877
You still won't see her if you're dead.

916
01:12:20,221 --> 01:12:22,917
No, I mean what if I pretend to be dead.

917
01:12:24,459 --> 01:12:28,190
Not a bad idea.

918
01:12:30,265 --> 01:12:31,232
I have a plan.

919
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,065
But I need your help.

920
01:12:34,903 --> 01:12:35,767
What is it?

921
01:12:35,937 --> 01:12:38,201
Tell us, count me in if it's fun.

922
01:12:38,807 --> 01:12:41,776
If it's toying with that Taiwanese girl,
count me in.

923
01:12:41,943 --> 01:12:44,104
You know how much I hate her, that bitch.

924
01:12:44,279 --> 01:12:45,143
Forget it.

925
01:12:45,313 --> 01:12:46,712
Is it something fun, can I join in?

926
01:12:47,715 --> 01:12:49,046
The cover's been blown,

927
01:12:49,417 --> 01:12:50,941
should we kill her?

928
01:12:51,252 --> 01:12:53,482
I got just the role for her.

929
01:12:53,688 --> 01:12:54,313
What? Do I have to act?

930
01:12:54,489 --> 01:12:56,252
I can act, count me in.

931
01:12:57,692 --> 01:13:01,128
- Bitch! It's your fault... - Stop!

932
01:13:01,296 --> 01:13:03,662
Wait a minute, who's going to play you?

933
01:13:03,832 --> 01:13:05,493
I mean the dead one.

934
01:13:07,368 --> 01:13:08,665
I know who.

935
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:12,763
Hello?

936
01:13:12,941 --> 01:13:13,930
My Dear, where are you?

937
01:13:14,108 --> 01:13:16,008
I'm meeting a friend for drinks.

938
01:13:16,244 --> 01:13:17,268
Don't be too late.

939
01:13:17,445 --> 01:13:18,912
I've bought dessert to eat together.

940
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:19,876
Okay.

941
01:13:25,587 --> 01:13:26,144
Miss.

942
01:13:26,354 --> 01:13:27,821
What do you want, sir?

943
01:13:28,923 --> 01:13:29,321
Coffee please.

944
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:30,320
Yes.

945
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:31,614
Miss...

946
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,190
Miss, sorry, my phone's battery is dead.

947
01:13:34,395 --> 01:13:35,726
Can I borrow yours?

948
01:13:36,364 --> 01:13:37,160
Okay.

949
01:13:37,432 --> 01:13:38,194
Thanks.

950
01:13:44,772 --> 01:13:46,137
Come on, pick up.

951
01:13:47,108 --> 01:13:49,338
Miss, can I leave your number...

952
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:50,636
in my friend's voicemail?

953
01:13:50,845 --> 01:13:51,709
And ask him to call you.

954
01:13:52,046 --> 01:13:53,013
Eh...

955
01:13:53,181 --> 01:13:53,840
I'm sorry

956
01:13:54,015 --> 01:13:56,415
But this is a very important phone call.

957
01:13:56,584 --> 01:13:58,484
Okay, my phone number is...

958
01:13:58,653 --> 01:14:01,588
How about, you leave the message.

959
01:14:03,658 --> 01:14:07,094
My phone number is 65766666

960
01:14:07,262 --> 01:14:08,456
Your friend is waiting for you.

961
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:10,530
Call him, Bye.

962
01:14:11,566 --> 01:14:12,396
Thank you.

963
01:14:13,034 --> 01:14:14,524
You are so nice, what's your name?

964
01:14:14,836 --> 01:14:15,825
My name is Venus.

965
01:14:16,037 --> 01:14:17,732
Hello, Venus, my name is Andy.

966
01:14:21,809 --> 01:14:22,537
Miss.

967
01:14:22,744 --> 01:14:24,234
How may I help you?

968
01:14:25,113 --> 01:14:26,580
I think you've been had.

969
01:14:27,415 --> 01:14:28,882
I don't understand.

970
01:14:29,317 --> 01:14:32,047
I overheard this man in the toilet...

971
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:33,710
Betting 500 dollars,

972
01:14:33,888 --> 01:14:34,980
that he can get your phone number.

973
01:14:35,156 --> 01:14:36,589
With you telling him.

974
01:14:37,592 --> 01:14:38,957
Watch you mouth, bastard?

975
01:14:39,227 --> 01:14:40,421
Cheque!

976
01:14:41,229 --> 01:14:44,096
Have you no manners at all?

977
01:14:45,266 --> 01:14:46,392
-Hey. - What?

978
01:14:46,701 --> 01:14:48,760
Watch out, bastard.

979
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:52,337
Just leave, Mussels, get a life!

980
01:14:53,641 --> 01:14:55,871
Thank you, lucky to have you here.

981
01:14:56,611 --> 01:14:58,272
What a weirdo.

982
01:14:58,579 --> 01:15:02,015
But... You are so pretty,
you should be careful.

983
01:15:02,517 --> 01:15:04,144
Mister, how may I call you?

984
01:15:05,753 --> 01:15:06,685
My name is Venus.

985
01:15:14,395 --> 01:15:15,862
Wilson

986
01:15:19,367 --> 01:15:19,958
How was it?

987
01:15:20,134 --> 01:15:21,294
I'm picking her up from work tomorrow.

988
01:15:21,736 --> 01:15:24,330
That's quick! You need to thank me.

989
01:15:24,572 --> 01:15:25,903
Thank you?

990
01:15:26,641 --> 01:15:29,235
I had to scare your ex for you.

991
01:15:29,477 --> 01:15:31,707
You need to get me at least
another handful of girls.

992
01:15:31,879 --> 01:15:33,005
Would that be enough?

993
01:15:33,181 --> 01:15:33,943
What do you think?

994
01:15:34,349 --> 01:15:37,750
Do you know
how hard has the last two weeks been?

995
01:15:42,924 --> 01:15:46,155
Wilson, is it you?

996
01:15:55,036 --> 01:15:55,798
Alice

997
01:15:57,538 --> 01:15:58,436
Wilson

998
01:16:05,113 --> 01:16:06,944
The memorial was so successful

999
01:16:07,115 --> 01:16:09,049
He's really back, go and see for yourself.

1000
01:16:09,217 --> 01:16:11,742
I've never seen a ghost before.

1001
01:16:12,653 --> 01:16:15,349
Wasn't it a bit over the top
for just one girl.

1002
01:16:15,556 --> 01:16:18,548
Had to play dead, and had a memorial.

1003
01:16:18,926 --> 01:16:21,087
And, when will you...

1004
01:16:21,262 --> 01:16:22,820
return my photos?

1005
01:16:23,297 --> 01:16:24,195
She has amnesia,

1006
01:16:24,699 --> 01:16:26,860
so I helped her to create new memories.

1007
01:16:41,449 --> 01:16:42,939
Memories that love me.

1008
01:16:44,185 --> 01:16:46,779
She said she wouldn't love me
if I am the last man alive.

1009
01:16:47,055 --> 01:16:49,990
Wilson, I wouldn't love you if you are...

1010
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:51,056
The last man alive!

1011
01:16:51,692 --> 01:16:52,590
Look now.

1012
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:56,724
But one day, she might remember

1013
01:16:57,732 --> 01:16:58,756
When that day comes,

1014
01:16:59,767 --> 01:17:01,632
I might not like her anymore.

1015
01:17:02,437 --> 01:17:03,836
Don't need a reason to split up.

1016
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:06,229
You don't like losing.

1017
01:17:06,407 --> 01:17:07,999
But you don't want the prize when you win.

1018
01:17:08,176 --> 01:17:10,337
I should have made the first move.

1019
01:17:11,379 --> 01:17:13,745
Hey, you always lose to me on two things.

1020
01:17:13,915 --> 01:17:14,813
What?

1021
01:17:14,982 --> 01:17:16,381
One, I make a move faster than you.

1022
01:17:17,318 --> 01:17:18,751
Two, I'm luckier than you.

1023
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:20,954
Talk again, I need to go.

1024
01:17:22,156 --> 01:17:22,850
I'm meeting someone.

1025
01:17:23,024 --> 01:17:23,956
Don't you need to check-in?

1026
01:17:24,325 --> 01:17:25,155
I'm not you.

1027
01:17:25,626 --> 01:17:27,150
She has nowhere to go but stay at home.

1028
01:17:27,562 --> 01:17:30,030
Well, see you, call me.

1029
01:17:31,966 --> 01:17:32,762
Take care.

1030
01:17:40,274 --> 01:17:41,002
Hey!

1031
01:17:43,277 --> 01:17:44,266
I thought you left?

1032
01:17:45,079 --> 01:17:47,070
No, I've decided to stay.

1033
01:17:47,415 --> 01:17:49,576
Why? You're dating?

1034
01:17:50,651 --> 01:17:52,414
Men... can't be trusted.

1035
01:17:53,221 --> 01:17:55,587
He won't lie to me, he treats me well.

1036
01:17:56,324 --> 01:17:59,088
Sometimes, guys lie to girls,
but they still see...

1037
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:01,660
If the girl they lie to is worth it.

1038
01:18:02,763 --> 01:18:03,661
That's true.

1039
01:18:03,865 --> 01:18:06,026
When you've heard enough, then split.

1040
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,628
You're a fast learner.

1041
01:18:08,503 --> 01:18:10,437
Talk later,
my boyfriend has brought me food.

1042
01:18:10,605 --> 01:18:11,503
I should go home.

1043
01:18:11,672 --> 01:18:12,696
- Okay. - Bye-bye.

1044
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:13,804
Bye-bye.

1045
01:18:15,476 --> 01:18:16,465
Oh yeah.

1046
01:18:17,345 --> 01:18:19,472
The note you slipped under my door.

1047
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,080
Since you are staying, here.

1048
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,615
-Bye-bye. -Bye-bye.

1049
01:18:39,433 --> 01:18:39,762
What's the matter?

1050
01:18:39,934 --> 01:18:40,832
Where's Mandy?

1051
01:18:41,636 --> 01:18:42,694
What do you want?

1052
01:18:42,904 --> 01:18:43,427
She was with me...

1053
01:18:43,604 --> 01:18:45,697
Miss, that's not funny.

1054
01:19:11,566 --> 01:19:12,658
What is this?

1055
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:17,060
When did it happen?

1056
01:19:17,238 --> 01:19:19,968
Mandy... She's been gone a year.

1057
01:19:21,075 --> 01:19:24,636
I argued with her and she kicked me out.

1058
01:19:26,013 --> 01:19:28,675
I received a call, she said...

1059
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:31,282
If I don't come back right away,
she'll kill herself.

1060
01:19:31,686 --> 01:19:35,247
I ignored her,
carried on drinking with some friends.

1061
01:19:35,723 --> 01:19:37,122
I never thought it was real.

1062
01:19:38,059 --> 01:19:39,822
She turned on the gas here...

1063
01:19:40,761 --> 01:19:42,388
I know Mandy loved this flat

1064
01:19:43,364 --> 01:19:45,195
So I let her stay here.

1065
01:19:46,234 --> 01:19:47,326
Maybe it's hard to believe

1066
01:19:48,336 --> 01:19:50,497
But I know Mandy is always with me.

1067
01:19:54,075 --> 01:19:55,303
Cheer up, still upset?

1068
01:20:00,982 --> 01:20:02,347
-Morning. -Morning.

1069
01:20:07,121 --> 01:20:08,986
She doesn't like me with other women.

1070
01:20:09,257 --> 01:20:10,622
Your place again?

1071
01:20:13,427 --> 01:20:14,121
Stop!

1072
01:20:14,395 --> 01:20:15,089
Who is it?

1073
01:20:15,663 --> 01:20:16,595
She lives above me.

1074
01:20:17,231 --> 01:20:18,357
Who's she shouting at?

1075
01:20:20,234 --> 01:20:21,724
I don't know, no one's there.

1076
01:20:21,936 --> 01:20:22,834
Wait for me!

1077
01:20:24,372 --> 01:20:25,134
Stop!

1078
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,068
I told her to let me go more than once.

1079
01:20:29,543 --> 01:20:33,309
You are so annoying! Leave me alone.

1080
01:20:33,614 --> 01:20:34,638
I've had enough

1081
01:20:37,018 --> 01:20:38,576
You're not leaving? Then I will!

1082
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:43,450
I don't like you, please go.

1083
01:20:44,859 --> 01:20:46,087
Why are you back?

1084
01:20:46,527 --> 01:20:48,392
I told you not to come back.

1085
01:20:48,996 --> 01:20:50,463
Please, leave me be.

1086
01:20:51,165 --> 01:20:53,759
I'm begging you. Let me go.

1087
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:59,573
Miss, you should know Mandy has gone.

1088
01:21:00,274 --> 01:21:01,206
The day it happened,

1089
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:03,206
the police said a girl upstairs called.

1090
01:21:03,544 --> 01:21:04,511
Weren't that you?

1091
01:21:08,149 --> 01:21:10,709
Wilson, I wouldn't love you if you are...

1092
01:21:10,885 --> 01:21:11,749
The last man alive!

1093
01:21:12,586 --> 01:21:13,518
You'll regret this!

1094
01:21:28,502 --> 01:21:29,434
Gas leak?

1095
01:21:33,574 --> 01:21:34,472
Anyone home?

1096
01:21:43,918 --> 01:21:46,386
Police? There's a gas leak,

1097
01:21:46,554 --> 01:21:47,282
I'm at Kowloon City...

1098
01:21:47,521 --> 01:21:48,749
I thought you were going?

1099
01:21:50,524 --> 01:21:51,752
Wilson's not a good guy.

1100
01:21:53,761 --> 01:21:55,626
Stop there, I've called the police.

1101
01:21:57,865 --> 01:21:58,456
Where're you going?

1102
01:21:58,733 --> 01:21:59,700
I never want to see you again!

1103
01:22:02,336 --> 01:22:03,894
Even though Mandy didn't live.

1104
01:22:05,139 --> 01:22:07,073
I still want to thank you.

1105
01:22:07,641 --> 01:22:10,838
Do you really see Mandy? What did she say?

1106
01:22:12,046 --> 01:22:13,172
Did she talk about me?

1107
01:22:13,681 --> 01:22:14,648
I think...

1108
01:22:17,852 --> 01:22:19,342
She wants me to give you this.

1109
01:22:22,356 --> 01:22:26,452
Dearest Keung, when you read this letter...

1110
01:22:27,194 --> 01:22:29,094
I won't be in this world anymore.

1111
01:22:29,964 --> 01:22:32,524
But I still love you very much.

1112
01:22:33,267 --> 01:22:34,894
Maybe this is the only way,

1113
01:22:35,536 --> 01:22:37,197
you'll remember me forever.

1114
01:22:37,772 --> 01:22:39,467
Love, Mandy.

1115
01:22:39,874 --> 01:22:41,239
Mandy did write this.

1116
01:24:00,554 --> 01:24:01,350
You're back?

1117
01:24:04,058 --> 01:24:04,786
I need a shower.

1118
01:24:06,126 --> 01:24:06,820
Wilson...

1119
01:24:13,534 --> 01:24:14,330
What did you say?

1120
01:24:27,047 --> 01:24:28,014
Wilson...

1121
01:24:30,217 --> 01:24:32,117
Hasn't visit for some time.

1122
01:24:35,022 --> 01:24:37,388
I don't want to see him anymore.

1123
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:45,694
Sometimes, guys lie to girls,
but they still see...

1124
01:24:45,866 --> 01:24:48,198
If the girl they lie to is worth it.

1125
01:24:48,369 --> 01:24:49,961
When you've heard enough, then split.

1126
01:24:50,437 --> 01:24:51,529
My Darling...

1127
01:24:52,873 --> 01:24:53,805
I love you.

1128
01:24:55,142 --> 01:24:56,473
She might remember

1129
01:24:56,944 --> 01:24:58,468
When that day comes,
I might not like her anymore.

1130
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,508
Don't need a reason to split up.

1131
01:25:02,483 --> 01:25:05,452
My Darling, I love you.
