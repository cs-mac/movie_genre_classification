1
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:43,385
WELCOME TO ZONNEDAEL

2
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,533
Sleep it off somewhere else.
Some people here have to work.

3
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:56,772
I don't wake you up when
I have to work.

4
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:37,763
Zonnedael 25 years, well, well.

5
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:39,611
Who would have thought?

6
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:41,600
Quite a performance.

7
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:45,398
I guess the organization's
going well.

8
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:47,599
What was your name?
-Van Brandwijk.

9
00:03:47,704 --> 00:03:49,844
Van Brandwijk.
-Ruud Van Brandwijk.

10
00:03:50,347 --> 00:03:55,515
I'm the chairman of the event
committee.

11
00:03:55,997 --> 00:03:59,108
Mrs Vonk coordinates the
activities.

12
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:00,152
Mrs Vonk.

13
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:02,573
I decide on the route for
the parade.

14
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:06,020
I establish the dress code for the
evenings before the final night.

15
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:08,382
And I take care of the music for
the gala.

16
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:10,548
No pop music, that's clear.

17
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:12,136
It's a celebration with style.

18
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:15,102
And I deal with publicity and I send
out the invitations.

19
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:18,879
Did you know 2 ministers and 3 members
of the House have lived in Zonnedael?

20
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:22,479
Is that true? And will they be
coming?

21
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,322
The invitations have been sent.

22
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:27,929
I wouldn't be surprised if they
showed up on the final night.

23
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:32,006
You prepared everything very well.

24
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:35,892
We have little to add.
Right, Sjakie?

25
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:40,308
We disagree.

26
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:44,861
We're very worried.
-Why?

27
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:48,436
The Flodder family. We can't keep
them in the neighborhood.

28
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:53,316
They're causing problems and they
have to be dealt with.

29
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,523
They could ruin our celebrations.

30
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:01,269
I have to protest against these
accusations!

31
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:04,931
Once again, the unprivileged are
being stigmatized.

32
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:09,180
The Flodder family are decent
people.

33
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:11,869
They have a heart of gold.

34
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:15,431
And a house full of silver. Stolen
silver.

35
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:19,950
Each year, a fortune disappears
into that den of thieves.

36
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:23,211
These accusations are unfounded,
Mr Brandhout.

37
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,530
Brandwijk!

38
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:28,970
If people would just give them
a chance.

39
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:32,644
A chance? Those scumbags grab every
chance they get.

40
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:37,103
They ruin the neighborhood with
that pink car of theirs.

41
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:39,618
This is slander!

42
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:49,411
We'll keep a close eye on the
Flodder family.

43
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:56,380
The celebrations will not be disturbed.
Right, Sjakie?

44
00:05:56,485 --> 00:05:58,466
Not by the Flodder family.

45
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,866
We don't need any problems when we
have important guests.

46
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:05,794
We have to forget about the past.

47
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:11,954
Maybe they were once antisocial, but
those days are over.

48
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:14,319
I have serious doubts about that.

49
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:16,713
They've undergone a remarkable
change.

50
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:20,446
They've become a lot more social,
also due to my guidance.

51
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:22,322
They have a sense of
responsibility.

52
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,998
They show initiative, they have
discipline.

53
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,758
Are we still talking about the Flodders?
-Certainly.

54
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:34,163
You'll be amazed when you see how
much they've adapted.

55
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,420
Good afternoon.
-Afternoon.

56
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,851
What can I do for you, officers?

57
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:11,726
We wanted to have a look around
if you don't mind.

58
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,280
Anything wrong?
-I hope not.

59
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:16,979
We've received a tip.

60
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,094
About contraband.

61
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:24,420
Contraband in my shed?

62
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,129
Yes, strange things happen in the
harbor.

63
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:32,078
Very strange things.

64
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:35,838
I assure you everything's alright.
I have the bills of lading here.

65
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:40,424
Forgeries are getting better
and better.

66
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:44,145
You couldn't tell they were real.

67
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:49,902
I'm afraid my colleague will have
to check these boxes.

68
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:51,441
I'm very afraid too.

69
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:55,952
Sergeant...

70
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,659
But you can't do that.
-Sorry, just following orders.

71
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:08,906
Found anything suspect, sergeant?

72
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,917
Very suspect.

73
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:15,636
What about this?
-Those are just CDs.

74
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:19,091
Pop, house, classical, normal
stuff.

75
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:23,263
They look pretty illegal to me.

76
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:27,146
Very illegal.
-We'll have to confiscate this box.

77
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,499
Confiscate? Are you crazy?

78
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:34,245
Insulting a public servant and
obstruction of the investigation.

79
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,851
Get the handcuffs. This gentleman
wants a ride to the station.

80
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:40,207
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

81
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,552
But these CDs have to go to
the customer.

82
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:46,383
The only thing that's going is
this box.

83
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:52,914
And to be safe, this one and
this one.

84
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:56,883
We'll release them if they turn
out genuine.

85
00:08:56,987 --> 00:09:01,338
Thanks for your help. It will lead to
a reduced sentence.

86
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,867
That went well, Kees.

87
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:09,866
These uniforms are paying off.
This is for more than 3000 worth of CDs.

88
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:16,906
That guy from the other shed called
the cops.

89
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,583
Act normal.

90
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,291
DRESS RENTAL

91
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:36,794
Officer!

92
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:43,145
Go after those two.
-Run, Kees!

93
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:51,963
They took three bags of coffee from me.
What about you?

94
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:55,043
Nothing, I knew they weren't
real police.

95
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,125
Forget about it.
-Look, Johnnie.

96
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:13,425
Andrй Alberti, all three parts.

97
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,837
They're from before his operation.
They sound like shit.

98
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:18,662
And Greatest Hits By Blind People.

99
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,284
That's a lot better, Johnnie.
-Yes, but they're still after us.

100
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:49,666
They're very stubborn.

101
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,767
When is their lunch break?

102
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,352
I'm getting hungry too.

103
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,184
Hold tight, Kees.

104
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,565
What are you doing?

105
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:05,609
A shortcut.

106
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:23,474
We lost them.

107
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:25,953
Yes, we did.

108
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:32,800
What a nice road. Plenty of
space.

109
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:35,769
Why is there no one here?
-It's strange.

110
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:37,351
So little traffic.

111
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:07,450
Unbelievable, landing on a public
road!

112
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:12,068
Did you get his number? We'll file a
complaint for reckless flying.

113
00:14:14,377 --> 00:14:17,338
That's the last time we've gone to
the harbor.

114
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:19,055
But we did get three bags
of coffee.

115
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:21,906
Great, Kees, but who of us drinks
coffee?

116
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,670
Sjakie?

117
00:14:23,774 --> 00:14:27,431
We have to try something else.
We've done all of the sheds.

118
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:29,680
I like the uniforms, though.

119
00:14:29,784 --> 00:14:32,340
Maybe you can give people parking
tickets.

120
00:14:32,444 --> 00:14:34,725
Tourists buy it sometimes.

121
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,968
He's lucky, no damage to the paint.

122
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:48,991
Cutting us off, what an idiot!

123
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:50,959
Those guys are a liability
on the road.

124
00:14:51,478 --> 00:14:55,877
First he's in a big hurry and now
he's asleep.

125
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:56,921
And his customers are waiting.

126
00:14:57,393 --> 00:15:01,669
What does 5 Zonnedael mean?

127
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:05,539
5 years Zonnedael? Sounds like
a sentence.

128
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:08,470
The pizza guy isn't in a hurry.

129
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,086
They're all slackers. Their customers
eat cold pizzas.

130
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,902
Yuck, I don't like fish.

131
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:22,477
I do, give it to me.

132
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:24,594
Have fun with it.

133
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:29,910
You should have asked what kind of
pizzas we wanted.

134
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:31,366
It was a surprise.

135
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,099
What's this?
-Salami, I guess.

136
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,149
That's a type of blood sausage.

137
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:40,518
Why do they call it salami then?

138
00:15:40,622 --> 00:15:43,070
Give it to Kees. You like salami
don't you?

139
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:46,520
Yuck, meat. Don't you have
anything vegetarian?

140
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:49,481
Vegetarian? Is that what your new
boyfriend eats?

141
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,374
It's healthy. Meat makes you
aggressive, he says.

142
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,706
True, when Kees sees a naked bitch,
he goes berserk.

143
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:57,215
Yuck, egg.

144
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:01,390
You can't handle eggs. They make
you fart.

145
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:03,228
Alright then.

146
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,452
Did we walk the old man today?

147
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:10,140
He stinks pretty badly.
-It's Toet's turn.

148
00:16:10,244 --> 00:16:13,051
I did it yesterday.
-You just put him out in the garden.

149
00:16:13,156 --> 00:16:16,342
You tied him to a garbage truck,
last week.

150
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:19,351
Do it together, couple of jerks.

151
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,096
Walk an extra block with him. When he's
had eggs, you don't want him inside.

152
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:30,121
Pineapple's always a feast.

153
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:34,361
Six on the Richter scale.

154
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,307
Hello.

155
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:29,414
Mrs Flodder?

156
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:31,760
Johnnie?

157
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:43,699
Hello Henkie, Toet.
-Sjakie, old fucker.

158
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,579
What are you doing?
-What does it look like?

159
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,701
You've added an engine.

160
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:51,605
Yes, now the old man can walk
himself.

161
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:55,660
What a bright idea.
-Except, the engine doesn't start.

162
00:17:55,825 --> 00:18:00,881
Can you pull?
-Of course. Let me.

163
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:06,242
What did you do, jerk?

164
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:08,168
Did you break it?

165
00:18:08,273 --> 00:18:10,182
What an asshole.
-Sorry, guys.

166
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:13,175
I didn't mean to do that.

167
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,869
Hey, Sjakie.

168
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:17,867
Had breakfast? I didn't know you
were a vegetarian.

169
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:24,085
I came to talk about the 25th
anniversary of Zonnedael.

170
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:29,466
Oh, that's what all the Christmas
decorations are about.

171
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:34,640
Next week, there will be a big party
with fireworks at the end.

172
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:38,205
Good, we like fireworks.

173
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:44,538
It's a very complicated thing
to organize.

174
00:18:44,642 --> 00:18:48,158
The entire neighborhood's
helping.

175
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:49,982
Every little bit helps.

176
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,783
But there are always people afraid
it will get out of hand.

177
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:58,520
I doubt it. This is a very quiet
neighborhood.

178
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:03,650
They were wondering if you would
help out too.

179
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,632
Of course, we love a party.

180
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:09,338
Maybe you can clean up the house
and the garden a bit.

181
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:14,287
Yesterday, I said to Kees that we
had to clean up the mess.

182
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:21,270
Sort things a bit. Exhaust pipes on one
side and tires on the other.

183
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:23,023
We're working on it, Sjakie.

184
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:26,079
We had to get used to this
neighborhood.

185
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:29,526
But we're doing better and better.
Kees is playing tennis for instance.

186
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,570
How come?

187
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:34,360
He has to learn first, so he started
by watching the girls play.

188
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:37,452
You can learn a lot by watching.

189
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:41,385
And Ma's visiting the neighbors.
She got an invitation.

190
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:43,416
That's nice to hear.

191
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,337
Here's the envelope. It was for a party
or a demonstration or something.

192
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,643
With free booze. Just her thing.

193
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,350
But this was for the people who lived
here before you.

194
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:55,444
That shows how quickly they accepted
us here.

195
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:56,487
See you, Sjakie.

196
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:09,912
Mascara makes your eyes shine.

197
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:13,862
Our mascara's waterproof.

198
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:20,813
I'll give you all a bag with our
products.

199
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:25,199
Where did you hide the booze?

200
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:30,076
How did that Flodder woman get in?

201
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,815
She had an invitation, somehow.

202
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:35,290
Mrs Flodder...
-Nice shelves.

203
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:36,333
Did you read all of it?

204
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:41,142
Will you join us again? I poured
you a coffee.

205
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:44,373
I need something to wash it
down with.

206
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,745
Gotcha.

207
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:54,591
Sorry, please continue.

208
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:59,845
Our products have been tested
on lab animals.

209
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,396
What kind of animals?

210
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:05,300
Rabbits, I think.
-Rabbits?

211
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:08,735
Why do they need eye shadow?
Ever seen a rabbit go out?

212
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,841
They're breeding enough as it is.

213
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:17,443
You have to remove your make-up
before you go to bed.

214
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:20,735
Remove it? I can tell you never
go out.

215
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,837
After I pick up a guy, I don't
want to scare him.

216
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:28,506
I'm fed up, Mrs Flodder.

217
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:32,366
You keep talking over her.

218
00:21:32,882 --> 00:21:35,457
I thought we were supposed
to have some fun.

219
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,211
Let's keep it nice, ladies.

220
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:40,297
See? I'm only kidding.

221
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:44,853
I think this whole demonstration
is wasted on you.

222
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:51,810
Do you think so? Why, bony bitch?

223
00:21:51,973 --> 00:21:54,554
I could come back another time.

224
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,642
I was only trying to say...
-I know what you're trying to say.

225
00:22:01,424 --> 00:22:03,501
They're 45 guilders per bottle.

226
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,382
Ladies, ladies!

227
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,156
Ladies, stop it!

228
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:32,919
Is that the demonstration lady,
darling?

229
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,885
Maybe I'm old fashioned, but do they
look good?

230
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:47,971
That terrible Flodder woman.

231
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:53,472
Will you join us for a drink?
-First a shower.

232
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:55,683
Let me know if you need help.

233
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,765
The men's toilet is full of bitches.

234
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:33,418
Pervert!

235
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:49,782
A shame I can't take you home. I'm
not allowed through Zonnedael.

236
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:53,508
I'll just walk the last bit.

237
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:55,217
Thanks for the lift.

238
00:25:16,771 --> 00:25:19,500
We'll get you, coward.

239
00:25:19,604 --> 00:25:23,781
What's he doing?
-Run, Kees, they're crazy.

240
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,573
Cowards!

241
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:31,202
We're teaching this pervert
a lesson.

242
00:25:31,307 --> 00:25:32,798
Forget about it.

243
00:25:34,215 --> 00:25:36,605
We don't want to hurt you.

244
00:25:48,784 --> 00:25:50,343
What was that?

245
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:53,859
I learnt this today at my karate
lesson.

246
00:25:53,964 --> 00:25:56,387
Next week we'll be kicking pieces
of wood in half.

247
00:25:57,229 --> 00:25:58,849
I guess they were lucky then.

248
00:26:10,116 --> 00:26:13,158
That looks expensive.
-Are you talking to me?

249
00:26:13,262 --> 00:26:15,259
You've got some expensive bags.

250
00:26:15,723 --> 00:26:18,340
You look more like the type for
a pushcart.

251
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,078
What are you on about, dude?

252
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,540
I like a big mouth.

253
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,974
Where are you going?
-None of your business. Home.

254
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:33,157
Stay here, girl. There's plenty
of room.

255
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:35,803
Do we know each other?
-Maybe.

256
00:26:36,518 --> 00:26:40,353
But I can't remember.
-Alright then.

257
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:45,907
Have you got a light?

258
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:54,119
Nice lighter.
-Yes, it is.

259
00:26:54,223 --> 00:26:57,199
It was a gift.
-Yeah right, it's pure gold.

260
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,540
Ok, it wasn't a gift then.

261
00:26:58,644 --> 00:27:02,263
Do you live around here?
-Behind there.

262
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:06,532
Want to have a bite?
-Are they feeding the ducks?

263
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:09,231
I like you.

264
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:12,706
What about the Boeuf Brouillй
restaurant?

265
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,228
Are you pulling my leg?

266
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:17,335
Their staff doesn't even make enough
to eat there.

267
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,527
Yes or no, girl.

268
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:22,071
I eat there almost every day.

269
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:02,532
Something wrong?

270
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:06,570
I'm afraid to get in.

271
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,134
I only started working here today.

272
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:14,239
My name's Jacques van Kooten.

273
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:16,346
Most people call me Sjakie.

274
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,531
My name's Mirjam.

275
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:26,216
Where do you work?
-At the Social Affairs department.

276
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,637
I'm the new office employee.
-I work there too.

277
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:32,138
At the end of the corridor.

278
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:37,066
Isn't that very far?
-Yes, but it's close to the fire escape.

279
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:42,741
You're funny.
-Can I get past?

280
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:45,997
Oh dear.

281
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:50,001
It'll come back.

282
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:54,044
This lift keeps going around.
A bit like life itself.

283
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:58,143
We slowly go up and then we
slowly go down again.

284
00:28:58,247 --> 00:29:02,060
Sometimes you go through a dip
but then you go up again.

285
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:05,655
You're philosophical.

286
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,282
Maybe I think about things
a bit more.

287
00:29:10,386 --> 00:29:12,674
I really have to catch my bus.
Do you mind?

288
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:16,146
Go ahead. I'll wait for my bag.

289
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,697
See you tomorrow, Sjakie.

290
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,531
Is this yours?
-Yes, thanks.

291
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:30,354
Hey, where's...
-It's all spread out downstairs.

292
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,422
Clean it up yourself.

293
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:51,645
That Flodder woman ruined the
demonstration.

294
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,590
She covered us in hairspray.

295
00:29:53,694 --> 00:29:56,145
And then she took all the bags
of samples.

296
00:29:56,664 --> 00:29:59,873
I brought the Flodders up
at city hall.

297
00:29:59,977 --> 00:30:01,964
But they didn't listen to me.

298
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:05,780
They're too busy with education for
the disadvantaged.

299
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:07,875
And subsidies for immigrants.

300
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:10,021
And shelter for homeless people.

301
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:13,779
They don't care about our anniversary
celebration.

302
00:30:13,883 --> 00:30:18,127
Bram's mother told me he and his friends
were beaten up by that family.

303
00:30:18,231 --> 00:30:22,574
Without any reason.
-Somebody should do something.

304
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:26,880
I talked to Reinout De Graaf.
He hates those Flodders too.

305
00:30:26,985 --> 00:30:28,191
Do you think he can do something?

306
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:33,593
He may know a legal way to deal
with them.

307
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,624
He also helped us with the building
permit for the garage.

308
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:40,196
He'll have a look at it.

309
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:44,836
Do we have a sharper knife?

310
00:30:48,085 --> 00:30:50,205
This is nice. What is it?

311
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:54,796
Calamari. Squid.

312
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,385
I didn't know you could eat that.

313
00:30:57,948 --> 00:31:00,207
It's one of the specialties here.

314
00:31:01,712 --> 00:31:03,616
You never know what you'll get.

315
00:31:04,044 --> 00:31:06,401
It's always a surprise.

316
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,418
At the bottom it's still warm.

317
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,839
Do you want more?
-Depends what you're offering.

318
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:17,873
This feels like tomato.

319
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,631
No, it's peach.

320
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:28,116
I love peach.

321
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,875
Why would people throw it out?

322
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:34,920
This all we need.

323
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,669
I'm not so sure about that.

324
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:41,088
Is there any wine?

325
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:43,901
One moment.

326
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:53,442
They serve heavy wines here.

327
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:56,617
Can you handle alcohol?

328
00:31:57,163 --> 00:31:59,663
I've always been able to keep
it in.

329
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:07,213
To our first date.

330
00:32:07,317 --> 00:32:10,342
You're not getting any ideas,
are you?

331
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:14,165
Tomorrow I'll have forgotten
all about it.

332
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,443
About me too?

333
00:32:16,947 --> 00:32:21,716
That depends if we'll have some
more fun.

334
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,460
You guys are all the same.

335
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:30,230
Do you like football?
-Yes, but where do you find 11 men?

336
00:32:30,334 --> 00:32:33,098
I mean tonight's match.

337
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:37,471
It's sold out.
-I always have a spot.

338
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:41,431
Are you coming or did you have
other plans?

339
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:44,142
No, no plans.

340
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:19,624
Wait a moment, guys.

341
00:33:29,832 --> 00:33:32,328
Tastes pretty good.
-That's what I thought.

342
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:37,446
Real Belgian chocolate. I got
20 boxes on the cheap.

343
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:40,112
I somehow understand they
don't sell.

344
00:33:40,216 --> 00:33:43,427
You don't want to eat your own
masculinity.

345
00:33:43,612 --> 00:33:45,882
Just think of someone else.

346
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,262
I'll explain one more time.

347
00:33:48,366 --> 00:33:53,531
I'll drink the two beers faster than
you'll drink the one jenever.

348
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:55,467
That's impossible.

349
00:33:55,571 --> 00:34:01,392
I'll drink my glass and then you
can drink yours.

350
00:34:01,532 --> 00:34:03,641
You'll never win. What do we bet?

351
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:06,249
If I win, I get those three bags
of coffee.

352
00:34:06,353 --> 00:34:07,809
And if I win?

353
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,811
You'll get fifteen minutes with
Jolanda.

354
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:13,047
Deal.
-We can't touch each other's glasses.

355
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,206
No, that would be cheating.

356
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,354
Do you know where Ma is?
I haven't seen her all day.

357
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:34,280
I don't know where she is.
-Strange. have you seen the opener?

358
00:34:39,095 --> 00:34:40,970
Handy boyfriend to have.

359
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:50,062
But now I can't get to it.
-Indeed!

360
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,857
That's the third time this week.

361
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,915
And always that loud music.
-Imagine being their neighbors.

362
00:35:05,664 --> 00:35:10,260
How can we sleep with this noise?
It's antisocial.

363
00:35:10,364 --> 00:35:15,492
It might stop soon.
-They've been going all week.

364
00:35:15,596 --> 00:35:19,061
Those lowlifes only think of
themselves.

365
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:24,929
Tomorrow, we're going on holiday.
-That's why I want to sleep well.

366
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:29,488
It's such a long drive. And Pepita's
getting all nervous.

367
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,970
It's quiet. They've stopped.

368
00:35:36,074 --> 00:35:38,834
Do you hear, Ed? They...

369
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:42,946
You shouldn't have said anything.

370
00:36:08,156 --> 00:36:12,919
Break his ankles!
-Are you having fun?

371
00:36:13,023 --> 00:36:15,821
Absolutely, normally I'm home with
five kids.

372
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,646
Tackle him!

373
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,715
Well done, that'll teach him.

374
00:36:23,421 --> 00:36:26,665
Five children? How old?

375
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:28,180
All different.

376
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:30,070
The player on the left's unmarked,
dog face!

377
00:36:30,277 --> 00:36:33,625
You wouldn't say you have
five kids.

378
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,563
What do you mean?
-You look good.

379
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,394
Wait until you see me in
the morning.

380
00:36:38,754 --> 00:36:41,123
Sure, if you insist.

381
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:45,600
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
-Get that man!

382
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:02,788
They shouldn't have put that loser
on the right wing.

383
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:09,571
See you next time, scumbags.
-Bye Johnnie, it was fun.

384
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:17,425
Come and see me when you're in
the area. The coffee will be ready.

385
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,983
Bunch of apes! Shame on you!

386
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:12,433
Get out!
-Mind your pacemaker.

387
00:38:12,938 --> 00:38:17,399
They're destroying the neighborhood.
Look at our arch.

388
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,349
Bunch of scum. All friends of those
Flodders!

389
00:38:21,453 --> 00:38:24,408
Come inside. They're gone.
You'll catch a cold again.

390
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,321
The police don't do anything.

391
00:38:27,426 --> 00:38:30,405
If I get my hands on you, I'll
chop your heads off.

392
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:32,195
One by one!

393
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,453
I feel like two weeks of holiday.
Have you got the maps?

394
00:38:50,971 --> 00:38:55,887
Can we leave the house unguarded?
-The neighbors will keep an eye on it.

395
00:38:56,476 --> 00:38:59,502
That's exactly what I'm worried
about.

396
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:02,738
I mean the other neighbors. Get in.

397
00:39:52,488 --> 00:39:56,258
Thanks, I'll take it from here.

398
00:39:56,318 --> 00:40:00,393
ZONNEDAEL'S FIRST INHABITANTS
COME TO PARTY

399
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:05,559
Look at those mugs. Did they
escape?

400
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:11,615
Nice of the kid to walk our dog.
Bring it back though!

401
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,042
Want a pancake, Kees?

402
00:40:28,146 --> 00:40:30,066
I never heard you come home.

403
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,312
I was out all night and now
I'm starving.

404
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:37,250
Out all night? With who?

405
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:40,047
A great guy.

406
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:44,520
Beady eyes, unshaven, a big
nose.

407
00:40:44,697 --> 00:40:47,024
Exactly my type.

408
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:52,463
He can burp the national anthem.

409
00:40:52,568 --> 00:40:54,361
Wow, a musician.

410
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:58,177
He started talking to me in
the park.

411
00:40:58,282 --> 00:41:00,376
I could see he had class
right away.

412
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,687
The way he was sitting there...

413
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:05,738
Where were you, Ma? You missed
a nice party.

414
00:41:05,855 --> 00:41:09,284
She's just telling me she met
a guy.

415
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:12,863
First we went to have a bite.

416
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:17,527
In the Boeuf Brouillй.
-Isn't that the expensive place?

417
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,008
He has good taste, of course.

418
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:27,049
And money. One tip there is more
than the cafeteria makes all night.

419
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:28,780
So he's rich.

420
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:35,531
What's rich? He's smart.
And then we went to the football.

421
00:41:35,636 --> 00:41:38,325
You don't mean last night's final?

422
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:42,811
No, the empty lot at the back here.

423
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:46,958
Of course I mean the stadium. It
was sold out.

424
00:41:47,063 --> 00:41:49,614
Where did he get tickets then?

425
00:41:50,195 --> 00:41:55,216
We didn't need them. We had our
own spots.

426
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,352
He made special arrangements.

427
00:42:00,149 --> 00:42:02,065
For me.

428
00:42:03,677 --> 00:42:06,406
I'll have a bath.

429
00:42:09,454 --> 00:42:14,227
A bath? Ma?
-His own seats in the stadium?

430
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:15,984
He has class.

431
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:18,669
Even better, he has money.
-Do you think?

432
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:24,670
You can't get into the Boeuf Brouillй
without a bank warranty.

433
00:42:25,152 --> 00:42:27,786
Ma and a rich guy? Who
would have thought.

434
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:31,904
We'll never know how she did it,
but a rich family member...

435
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,276
Mirjam, what a coincidence.
-Hello, Sjaak.

436
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,588
I was on the way to my office.
Do you want a coffee?

437
00:42:57,693 --> 00:43:00,802
I've already got one.

438
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:07,372
Are you busy?
-Yes, I have to copy all this.

439
00:43:07,477 --> 00:43:10,159
That's Mr Wijnands. I have to go
back to work.

440
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:12,863
I haven't even finished my coffee.
-Give it to me.

441
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,984
Is that alright?
-No problem, don't keep him waiting.

442
00:43:17,088 --> 00:43:19,301
Thanks, Sjakie, bye.

443
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:25,356
You still owe me the report about
hazardous goods in Zonnedael.

444
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,757
Yes, it won't be long.

445
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,397
It'll have to wait until after your
coffee break, if I'll still be around.

446
00:43:39,306 --> 00:43:44,454
The most beautiful suburb of the
country, named Zonnedael...

447
00:43:44,593 --> 00:43:47,832
attracted a crowd on the day of
the opening.

448
00:43:47,937 --> 00:43:56,732
Many dignitaries were present.

449
00:43:56,836 --> 00:44:03,104
Zonnedael was officially opened by
the Queen.

450
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:17,138
Many architects worked on this little
piece of paradise.

451
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:22,485
They even expressed their creativity
in the pavement.

452
00:44:22,856 --> 00:44:26,995
The architects have been listening well
to the housewives.

453
00:44:27,902 --> 00:44:30,935
The houses are clear and bright.

454
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:37,089
There are many fire-proof
facilities.

455
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:41,232
This family has decided to go out
for dinner.

456
00:44:41,336 --> 00:44:45,193
They're doing so in their own spacious
patio.

457
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:50,716
Zonnedael has a waiting list of
over five years.

458
00:44:51,228 --> 00:44:58,194
But these people are privileged.
They can call themselves Zonnedaelers.

459
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:11,072
That was 25 years ago, when only highly
educated people lived here.

460
00:45:11,152 --> 00:45:17,033
People of rank, like former
ministers.

461
00:45:17,137 --> 00:45:21,938
Let's discuss how the organization's
going.

462
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:23,645
Mr Van As.

463
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:26,225
All the drinks have been delivered.

464
00:45:26,756 --> 00:45:30,590
Only red wine's a problem.
-No, that man is a problem.

465
00:45:31,054 --> 00:45:33,519
I have given him the address of my
supplier in France four times now.

466
00:45:33,624 --> 00:45:35,369
Maybe he lost it?

467
00:45:35,473 --> 00:45:41,468
Write down: Dupont in
Santй-sur-Vallйe: 00-33-248772.

468
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,364
Tell him to ask for Jean-Luc
and to mention my name.

469
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:52,066
The only parking lot we have are the
fields of the hockey club.

470
00:45:52,571 --> 00:45:55,893
But it's the day of the junior
semi-final.

471
00:45:55,997 --> 00:45:58,228
They can play on another day.

472
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,086
This is more important.

473
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:13,302
There's Reinout.

474
00:46:15,987 --> 00:46:19,682
I don't need to introduce Reinout.

475
00:46:20,185 --> 00:46:24,771
He arranged the chopping permit for
the extension of our golf course.

476
00:46:24,941 --> 00:46:33,761
Are there any legal means to do
something about this family?

477
00:46:33,865 --> 00:46:37,966
I've looked into the matter.

478
00:46:40,351 --> 00:46:46,698
This could be the exit visa of the
Flodder family from Zonnedael.

479
00:46:46,802 --> 00:46:48,727
You're kidding. What is it?

480
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:57,160
Four years ago, the commissioner's old
house was assigned to the Flodders.

481
00:46:57,277 --> 00:47:00,443
Why didn't anyone protest?
-Unbelievable.

482
00:47:00,547 --> 00:47:06,485
This document proves that politicians
struck a deal back then.

483
00:47:06,522 --> 00:47:12,117
There were conditions that
the Flodders had to meet.

484
00:47:12,221 --> 00:47:13,718
Why didn't anyone know about this?

485
00:47:13,822 --> 00:47:17,103
This is very sensitive. The document
isn't public.

486
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:20,242
How did you find out about this?

487
00:47:20,346 --> 00:47:22,117
Fishing's one of my hobbies.

488
00:47:22,221 --> 00:47:25,067
This is fantastic. Listen.

489
00:47:25,813 --> 00:47:31,745
The agreement is terminated when any
family members are involved with crime.

490
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,205
Isn't that all they do?

491
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:38,448
They've been arrested before but
no one knew about these conditions.

492
00:47:38,552 --> 00:47:44,516
The next time they'll be arrested, the
whole family can leave.

493
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,724
There's no way out of it.

494
00:47:46,828 --> 00:47:49,264
Sounds very good.

495
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:51,804
Do we have to wait until they're
arrested?

496
00:47:51,908 --> 00:47:54,381
Maybe we can help them a bit.

497
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:59,433
A 1992 convertible.

498
00:47:59,959 --> 00:48:04,992
White. It was parked in front of my
garage.

499
00:48:05,096 --> 00:48:08,108
They must have stolen it when
I was gone.

500
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:12,559
No, I didn't see the thief.

501
00:48:13,045 --> 00:48:17,821
My address... 52 Acacialaan.

502
00:48:19,015 --> 00:48:24,213
Thanks, bye.

503
00:48:25,216 --> 00:48:27,783
Very well done.

504
00:48:27,914 --> 00:48:30,953
I'm a bad liar.
-It sounded very convincing.

505
00:48:31,057 --> 00:48:32,586
And now what happens?

506
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:36,679
Leave it to my cousin. He's an
experienced actor.

507
00:48:42,602 --> 00:48:45,457
I'd remove that.

508
00:48:45,953 --> 00:48:53,949
That's the fuel pipe. I might need it
in the future.

509
00:48:58,692 --> 00:49:00,478
Johnnie.

510
00:49:09,497 --> 00:49:12,228
Are you the Flodders?

511
00:49:12,332 --> 00:49:15,048
Who wants to know?
-I'm Boris.

512
00:49:15,547 --> 00:49:18,645
I got your name from that guy you
do things for...

513
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:22,043
Kareltje.
-Yes, he said you could help me.

514
00:49:22,147 --> 00:49:27,875
I found this car and I want to
sell it, if you know what I mean.

515
00:49:27,979 --> 00:49:32,324
Kareltje said you were good at using
a file, if you know what I mean.

516
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,004
We're also good at using knife
and fork.

517
00:49:35,086 --> 00:49:40,063
We understand. There are some chassis
numbers in the way.

518
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:44,245
I've never seen any chassis numbers.
-Because we always spray over them.

519
00:49:44,352 --> 00:49:46,341
Do you do that too?

520
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:00,978
They're not really removing the numbers
from my car, are they?

521
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,789
It won't get to that.

522
00:50:02,893 --> 00:50:05,521
They'll be in jail by that stage.

523
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:06,564
Call the police.

524
00:50:11,713 --> 00:50:14,429
So that's a deal?

525
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:19,014
I'll pick up the car tomorrow.
-Don't forget to bring the money.

526
00:50:22,029 --> 00:50:25,750
Are we starting on the car right away?
-No, I'll do it tonight.

527
00:50:25,909 --> 00:50:30,563
Let's put it in the garage. We don't
want anyone to see a stolen car here.

528
00:50:30,668 --> 00:50:34,884
Can't I drive it for a bit?

529
00:50:34,989 --> 00:50:38,354
No, we can't take any risks.

530
00:50:48,964 --> 00:50:52,716
Alright, one block. But then you'll
clean up the garage.

531
00:51:01,635 --> 00:51:05,668
That beanpole's getting in my car.

532
00:51:09,144 --> 00:51:13,456
They're driving in my car!

533
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:18,104
Maybe he's driving around the block.
-He's going straight to Poland.

534
00:51:30,178 --> 00:51:33,159
Police, help, Johnnie!

535
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:46,630
There's the police.
-And where did my car go?

536
00:51:49,029 --> 00:51:51,010
Kees, don't drive so...

537
00:51:59,418 --> 00:52:01,784
Where is it?
-Where's what?

538
00:52:01,941 --> 00:52:04,183
The stolen car, smartass.

539
00:52:05,045 --> 00:52:07,500
Where did you hide it? In that
garage.

540
00:52:07,604 --> 00:52:10,720
You can't just go in there.

541
00:52:10,824 --> 00:52:11,764
Step aside, you.

542
00:52:12,545 --> 00:52:15,076
We received a tip.

543
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:23,760
What a mess.
-But no car.

544
00:52:25,206 --> 00:52:27,717
Sorry to have bothered you.

545
00:52:27,821 --> 00:52:32,418
Always those false reports.
We've got better things to do.

546
00:52:32,522 --> 00:52:35,721
I put it a bit further. We can
go get it.

547
00:52:35,825 --> 00:52:39,460
Let's not do that. This car's a bit
too hot.

548
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:44,613
Where did that kid put my car?
-Don't worry.

549
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:46,863
He might have wrecked it.

550
00:52:46,968 --> 00:52:48,847
There it is.
-My car!

551
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:50,868
In front of my house!

552
00:52:59,631 --> 00:53:01,351
How can it be here?

553
00:53:13,711 --> 00:53:16,572
Isn't this 52 Acacialaan?

554
00:53:16,676 --> 00:53:18,403
Yes, why?

555
00:53:19,336 --> 00:53:22,799
Did you report the stolen car?

556
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:24,692
Yes.

557
00:53:24,796 --> 00:53:26,986
A white convertible. This one?

558
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,023
Yes, but the thing is...

559
00:53:29,127 --> 00:53:30,775
So you've got it back.

560
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,386
Was it ever stolen?

561
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:39,689
You have to understand...
-We don't like false reports.

562
00:53:40,478 --> 00:53:42,848
Did you think we have nothing
better to do?

563
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:47,803
And your insurance company won't
like this scam either.

564
00:53:47,908 --> 00:53:51,825
I'll be keeping an eye on you.
Goodbye.

565
00:53:59,813 --> 00:54:06,478
That almost ended badly.
-We'll have to be smarter next time.

566
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:32,030
Yes, speaking.
-My name's Rick, I'm a movie producer.

567
00:54:32,674 --> 00:54:36,194
You were very good at the last
audition.

568
00:54:36,298 --> 00:54:37,966
What are you on about?

569
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:41,034
Who are you anyway?
-Of course you don't remember me.

570
00:54:41,055 --> 00:54:46,182
I was in the middle of a production,
so we couldn't really talk.

571
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:49,485
But what I saw looked very good.

572
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:52,299
I don't know what you mean.
Is Johnnie behind this?

573
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:58,298
Now I remember. Johnnie once
showed me pictures of you.

574
00:54:58,427 --> 00:55:03,180
We were all very enthusiastic
on the set.

575
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:04,374
Right, that was all?

576
00:55:04,478 --> 00:55:06,749
Don't hang up, Kees.

577
00:55:07,461 --> 00:55:11,870
I called to ask if you want to make
some money.

578
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:13,669
That depends. How much?

579
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,046
Three thousand for an hour's work.

580
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:21,262
What do I have to do?
-We're making an art movie.

581
00:55:22,305 --> 00:55:26,850
It needs some nudity. The screen
test is this afternoon.

582
00:55:26,955 --> 00:55:30,956
Before you continue: I don't do
children or animals.

583
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,976
That's not what I meant.

584
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:39,026
I was thinking of some simple risquй
stuff.

585
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:41,933
That's alright then. What should
I bring?

586
00:55:42,037 --> 00:55:45,201
You'll be playing a cheeky hooker.

587
00:55:45,305 --> 00:55:50,651
So wear something hot.
Lots of make-up, the works.

588
00:55:50,756 --> 00:55:55,722
I can't walk the streets like
that and Johnnie can't drive me.

589
00:55:55,826 --> 00:55:59,794
If you start getting changed,
I'll send a car over.

590
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,920
You don't have to walk the streets
in those clothes.

591
00:56:03,024 --> 00:56:07,978
In fifteen minutes?
-Alright.

592
00:56:08,107 --> 00:56:14,179
Well done, very convincing.

593
00:56:14,283 --> 00:56:17,482
I'd like to know what we're doing.

594
00:56:17,587 --> 00:56:20,990
Organizing an anniversary or
making a porn movie?

595
00:56:21,094 --> 00:56:24,622
We're trying to provoke the
Flodders.

596
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:29,943
I want the council to see that they're
guilty of all kinds of filth.

597
00:56:30,047 --> 00:56:32,933
Nudism, scandalous behavior,
that kind of stuff.

598
00:56:33,037 --> 00:56:40,858
Offences against public decency. Ground
to expel them immediately.

599
00:56:41,015 --> 00:56:46,387
And we make sure we have
the proof.

600
00:56:46,492 --> 00:56:49,699
This can't go wrong.

601
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,750
Is it far?
-What?

602
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:16,380
The film set.
-No, it's there.

603
00:57:16,962 --> 00:57:18,778
Behind there.

604
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:30,998
I think my indicator isn't working.

605
00:57:31,755 --> 00:57:33,561
What are you looking at?

606
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:35,761
Your moustache's falling off.
-My moustache?

607
00:57:36,278 --> 00:57:37,950
Am I still wearing it?

608
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:41,570
I just came from the film set.
I forgot to remove it.

609
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:46,131
Right, guys always have car trouble
when I'm in the car with them.

610
00:57:46,236 --> 00:57:50,717
Would you mind checking if it's
flashing?

611
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:53,929
Alright then.
-It's the right one at the rear.

612
00:58:01,065 --> 00:58:04,621
What's this?

613
00:58:04,725 --> 00:58:06,106
Come back!

614
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:12,244
Unhappy customer? The biggest pigs
always drive the nicest cars.

615
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:16,154
But this is our spot. Keep walking!

616
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:22,869
I think it's horrible. You and I
in the car, with a camera.

617
00:58:23,405 --> 00:58:27,848
I feel dirty.
-No, the Flodders are dirty.

618
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,463
Look at that girl.

619
00:58:30,568 --> 00:58:34,295
Checking out the girls, naughty boy?

620
00:58:39,052 --> 00:58:41,506
Hello, sweetie. What have you
got to offer?

621
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:43,621
A slap in the face and a knee
up your crotch.

622
00:58:45,415 --> 00:58:48,678
Haven't you got enough?

623
00:58:49,173 --> 00:58:52,426
It's enough that's she's playing
the whore.

624
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,674
The real proof is when she goes with
a guy.

625
00:58:55,778 --> 00:58:59,672
She'll say she wanted a ride,
but no one will believe that.

626
00:58:59,757 --> 00:59:02,790
Unbelievable.

627
00:59:02,895 --> 00:59:06,910
I'd never walk around in my bare ass
like that.

628
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:11,316
Having to go with any strange man.

629
00:59:11,886 --> 00:59:15,498
Having to do everything those
men ask.

630
00:59:15,602 --> 00:59:18,898
Getting on your knees, bending
over and...

631
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:24,893
I'd hate to do whatever those
ladies do.

632
00:59:24,997 --> 00:59:30,277
There's another car.
-Come on, girls, work!

633
00:59:31,779 --> 00:59:34,865
Hello, lady.
-I only need a ride.

634
00:59:34,969 --> 00:59:38,005
I bet. Get in.

635
00:59:38,109 --> 00:59:40,491
Bitch, stealing our customers.

636
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:44,282
Bitch!

637
00:59:50,235 --> 00:59:52,232
Yes, got it.

638
00:59:54,066 --> 00:59:55,951
We can go home.

639
00:59:59,477 --> 01:00:06,141
Nice car, isn't it? I just
bought it.

640
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:09,259
I'm still breaking it in. What
about you?

641
01:00:09,361 --> 01:00:12,077
You look pretty broken in.

642
01:00:12,673 --> 01:00:17,922
What do you say?
-Let me out. I'll walk.

643
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:20,154
Let me out!

644
01:00:20,741 --> 01:00:22,376
Good brakes.

645
01:00:35,372 --> 01:00:38,421
This will impress the council.

646
01:00:38,698 --> 01:00:43,052
Good that she got into the car.
-That's the main thing.

647
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:47,395
Otherwise she could say she just
happened to be walking there.

648
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:50,208
Are we expecting anyone?

649
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:54,603
I've made an appointment to go
through the finances.

650
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:57,308
As long as it doesn't take
too long.

651
01:01:00,852 --> 01:01:04,258
Nice color, isn't it?
98,000.

652
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:08,574
But that's ready to go, including
hi-fi.

653
01:01:08,678 --> 01:01:11,211
It's not that much, is it?

654
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,850
It's working.
-Cool.

655
01:01:25,995 --> 01:01:30,494
I'm only telling you once, old man.

656
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:33,439
This is the gas and this is...

657
01:01:34,219 --> 01:01:36,278
And this is the brake.

658
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:42,669
Maybe we should have used gas,
instead of Ma's whiskey.

659
01:03:12,197 --> 01:03:16,071
I have some mail in my room.
-Sorry, I'm going down.

660
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:19,157
Is tomorrow alright too?
-It has to be sent as soon as possible.

661
01:03:19,194 --> 01:03:22,102
I'll bring it over in a sec.
-As you wish.

662
01:03:31,435 --> 01:03:34,710
Mirjam, what are you doing here?

663
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:39,033
I wanted to ask if I can take some
mail out for you.

664
01:03:39,138 --> 01:03:40,687
Mail?

665
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:44,849
I just finished work and I thought
maybe I can help you.

666
01:03:44,953 --> 01:03:47,895
But you weren't here so I checked
out your desk.

667
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,572
That's very friendly but
you don't need to do that.

668
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:55,484
I can do it myself.
-But I like to do it. For you.

669
01:03:55,588 --> 01:04:00,117
That's very sweet of you.

670
01:04:00,221 --> 01:04:04,666
Normally, I do it myself.
-Let me do it.

671
01:04:05,385 --> 01:04:09,311
This letter's very important. It has
to be sent today.

672
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,929
Don't worry, I'll do it.

673
01:04:13,033 --> 01:04:16,576
Mirjam, do you have a permanent
job here?

674
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,886
Or are you an intern?

675
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:20,640
Something like that.

676
01:04:28,842 --> 01:04:30,565
Van Kooten.

677
01:04:30,669 --> 01:04:34,007
What are you doing?
-I was just... uhm...

678
01:04:34,111 --> 01:04:37,698
People from Zonnedael keep calling
about those Flodders.

679
01:04:37,803 --> 01:04:40,823
They keep racing through the suburb and
throwing noisy parties.

680
01:04:40,928 --> 01:04:44,504
I thought we had a deal.
-They're enjoying life.

681
01:04:44,608 --> 01:04:47,978
I'm not. We'll have important guests at
the anniversary, next week.

682
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:52,654
There will even be a minister on the
closing night.

683
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:56,223
I want the place to be quiet.
Is that clear?

684
01:05:26,543 --> 01:05:28,171
Son.

685
01:05:28,734 --> 01:05:32,756
You've got 5 seconds to let go of me
or you'll be eating through a straw.

686
01:05:34,841 --> 01:05:36,879
Don't you recognize me, Johnnie?

687
01:05:36,984 --> 01:05:39,003
I'm your father.

688
01:05:41,243 --> 01:05:44,672
I bet you didn't expect to ever
see me again.

689
01:05:44,776 --> 01:05:49,257
No, that's a big surprise.
-That's what I thought.

690
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:52,797
You don't look like him, Johnnie.
-We all don't look alike.

691
01:05:53,813 --> 01:05:58,228
But whose father are you? We all
have a different one.

692
01:05:58,332 --> 01:06:00,952
When I moved in with your mother,
you were already there.

693
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:04,950
Right, so I'm not winning any
prizes today.

694
01:06:05,054 --> 01:06:07,210
You haven't changed, Johnnie.

695
01:06:07,314 --> 01:06:09,672
As a little boy, you also had
a big mouth.

696
01:06:09,776 --> 01:06:14,307
Remember how you offered the kids in the
street protection for ten marbles?

697
01:06:14,412 --> 01:06:17,036
I don't remember that.

698
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,030
All those kids you dumped in the ditch,
with a bike wheel around their ankles.

699
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:22,826
I had to free them before the
police arrived.

700
01:06:22,931 --> 01:06:25,111
You were quite something.

701
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:30,093
Did I do funny things too?
-You couldn't talk yet when I moved in.

702
01:06:30,197 --> 01:06:34,904
I guess I was still a baby.
-Kees, you started talking at 12.

703
01:06:35,008 --> 01:06:37,786
What do you remember about me?
-I don't know you.

704
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:42,398
I left your mom when she was
8 months pregnant.

705
01:06:42,575 --> 01:06:48,460
But then...
-To the reunion of father and daughter.

706
01:06:48,565 --> 01:06:51,875
Are you really my father?
-I'm afraid so, Kees.

707
01:06:51,979 --> 01:06:55,223
He just came back from getting some
cigarettes.

708
01:06:55,328 --> 01:06:58,153
That's not how it went.

709
01:06:58,783 --> 01:07:01,686
The underworld was after me.

710
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:04,806
I had debts and I didn't want to
put your mother in any danger.

711
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:07,660
That's why you left her with three
rugrats.

712
01:07:07,764 --> 01:07:09,480
Three? What about us?

713
01:07:09,585 --> 01:07:12,906
You came later. He's only responsible
for your sister.

714
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:14,834
Was the old man there too?

715
01:07:14,938 --> 01:07:15,877
I don't remember him.

716
01:07:16,645 --> 01:07:19,242
Who is that anyway?
-We still don't know.

717
01:07:19,346 --> 01:07:23,744
It's all very touching but what
do you want?

718
01:07:23,848 --> 01:07:26,959
I've traveled a lot lately.

719
01:07:27,064 --> 01:07:29,506
I've seen a lot.

720
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:35,007
But now I want to settle down.
-Ah, you want cheap lodgings.

721
01:07:35,111 --> 01:07:37,960
He'd better stay with us instead.

722
01:07:38,904 --> 01:07:41,206
Why did you never send a postcard?

723
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:43,459
I didn't have your address.

724
01:07:43,563 --> 01:07:46,242
So how did you find us?

725
01:07:46,759 --> 01:07:49,540
I just looked around well.

726
01:07:59,646 --> 01:08:03,410
I think it's working. He's been
inside for 15 minutes.

727
01:08:03,515 --> 01:08:07,465
So if he moves in with the Flodders,
they will be kicked out?

728
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:12,509
Exactly. Infringement of one of the main
clauses: no additions to the family.

729
01:08:12,613 --> 01:08:15,794
So he's really the father of one of
those kids.

730
01:08:15,898 --> 01:08:17,924
Yes, that's the big joke.

731
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:24,184
I hope this finally works so we can get
back to organizing the anniversary.

732
01:08:24,288 --> 01:08:26,953
If this works, we'll have successful
celebrations.

733
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:28,500
Without those Flodders.

734
01:08:28,517 --> 01:08:33,492
Why have they never met their father?
-He's been in jail for years.

735
01:08:33,597 --> 01:08:36,800
Reinout talked to his probation
officer.

736
01:08:36,836 --> 01:08:39,337
He was prepared to help us in exchange
for a reduced sentence.

737
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:43,152
I have my doubts.
-Don't be such a pessimist.

738
01:08:43,484 --> 01:08:45,884
I know this is going to work.

739
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:49,559
Let's go. Reinout will be there.

740
01:08:51,579 --> 01:08:55,591
One day we lost Kees.
He was around three years old.

741
01:08:55,695 --> 01:08:59,891
I found him amongst the laundry.
Johnnie put him in there.

742
01:09:00,827 --> 01:09:04,398
Lucky you found him in time.
-Well... in time...

743
01:09:04,503 --> 01:09:06,724
The laundry cycle was halfway.

744
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:14,267
This is all great fun, but I don't
know if Ma wants to see you.

745
01:09:14,371 --> 01:09:19,480
I understand you're a bit angry,
but you are family after all.

746
01:09:19,584 --> 01:09:22,439
And who else can I leave my
money too?

747
01:09:23,633 --> 01:09:25,038
What was that?

748
01:09:25,081 --> 01:09:26,516
What did you say?

749
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:30,077
That you're family?
-After that, about money.

750
01:09:30,181 --> 01:09:37,510
I've made a lot more money than
I can spend on my own.

751
01:09:37,614 --> 01:09:40,925
So I want to leave it to my
loved ones.

752
01:09:41,029 --> 01:09:44,041
To my family.
-We have room in the attic.

753
01:09:44,145 --> 01:09:50,265
We can't take a strange guy in.
-This is your very own father.

754
01:09:50,369 --> 01:09:54,298
Kick him out!
-Hi darling, long time no see.

755
01:09:55,418 --> 01:10:00,823
This is Kees' father. Listen to
what he has to say.

756
01:10:00,927 --> 01:10:03,626
I've listened more than enough to
this flounder. Get out!

757
01:10:03,731 --> 01:10:06,252
Wait a moment.

758
01:10:06,356 --> 01:10:09,306
He's still Kees' father.

759
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:12,213
There's only room for one father
in our house.

760
01:10:12,317 --> 01:10:15,913
I'm getting married again.
To Robbie.

761
01:10:16,929 --> 01:10:19,760
Robbie?
-Is that the rich guy?

762
01:10:19,873 --> 01:10:23,480
Who mentioned a rich guy?
-Hello, can I...

763
01:10:23,584 --> 01:10:26,356
Stay out of our family affairs.

764
01:10:28,668 --> 01:10:31,895
Don't you dare come back!

765
01:10:36,603 --> 01:10:39,388
Kicked out of the house?

766
01:10:39,492 --> 01:10:43,334
Are they insane? Their own father!

767
01:10:43,438 --> 01:10:47,834
He messed up.
-I knew it.

768
01:10:47,938 --> 01:10:51,032
Another man? She's getting
married?

769
01:10:51,136 --> 01:10:54,952
How can a creature like that find
a man?

770
01:10:55,056 --> 01:10:58,659
What was that? No, I don't
think so.

771
01:10:58,695 --> 01:11:01,253
We'll talk to each other later.

772
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:05,572
The nerve! Asking if I can put in a good
word with his probation officer.

773
01:11:05,676 --> 01:11:08,422
I don't think so, after this mess!

774
01:11:08,527 --> 01:11:13,362
Did you say marry?
-That Flodder woman has found a man.

775
01:11:13,466 --> 01:11:15,482
She's getting married?
-Yes, do you understand it?

776
01:11:15,629 --> 01:11:18,797
That's excellent.
-Why? Another troublemaker.

777
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,582
They're getting a new father.
-If that wedding will happen...

778
01:11:24,687 --> 01:11:27,009
Then we get rid of them for ever!

779
01:11:30,574 --> 01:11:33,517
SEIZE THE DAY!
SJAAK

780
01:11:52,275 --> 01:12:00,631
You're here for the wedding of 10:30?
-Yes, I'm the groom.

781
01:12:01,762 --> 01:12:04,841
Where's the bride?

782
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:08,273
She's just arriving.

783
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:36,327
As eldest son I have to warn you
of this wrong step.

784
01:12:36,431 --> 01:12:40,396
Yes, those steps look tricky when
you're wearing this dress.

785
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,268
That's not what I mean, Ma.

786
01:12:42,373 --> 01:12:45,922
Is it wise to marry that piece of
street furniture?

787
01:12:46,026 --> 01:12:49,224
Do you mean Robbie?
-Have you thought it through?

788
01:12:49,329 --> 01:12:51,248
Marriage is a big step.

789
01:12:51,353 --> 01:12:53,235
Mind your own business!

790
01:12:53,339 --> 01:12:57,584
You shouldn't exchange rings
at your age.

791
01:12:57,688 --> 01:13:02,342
Did I ever interfere with all the broads
you've dragged into your bedroom?

792
01:13:02,446 --> 01:13:07,395
No, but...
-This is my last chance at a great guy.

793
01:13:07,499 --> 01:13:11,265
If you cause trouble, you can hand
me the keys to the house.

794
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:17,609
Who are they?

795
01:13:17,713 --> 01:13:19,598
Congratulations.

796
01:13:20,712 --> 01:13:23,465
A congratulations telegram?

797
01:13:33,879 --> 01:13:36,379
Sjakie, are you going to the wedding of
Mrs Flodder?

798
01:13:36,483 --> 01:13:41,087
I took the afternoon off for it.
-Give them my regards.

799
01:13:41,123 --> 01:13:46,838
I will.
-I'm happy for her. She deserves it.

800
01:13:46,942 --> 01:13:50,075
Shouldn't that be straight?

801
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:57,081
Sorry, I didn't see you.

802
01:13:57,185 --> 01:14:00,240
Let me help you.
-No, let me.

803
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:03,914
What's this? This is part of the
Flodder file.

804
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:07,284
Where did you get it?
-I needed it for a moment.

805
01:14:07,388 --> 01:14:10,669
This is confidential information.
It can't even leave the department.

806
01:14:10,774 --> 01:14:13,386
My father made me do it.

807
01:14:13,487 --> 01:14:16,718
This can't be true. I forgot all
about it.

808
01:14:16,822 --> 01:14:18,601
Addition to the family...

809
01:14:20,106 --> 01:14:24,622
What, your father?
-It was all his idea.

810
01:14:25,784 --> 01:14:29,750
It's not true.
-I had no choice.

811
01:14:34,698 --> 01:14:39,452
Sjakie, it's really not my fault.

812
01:14:39,557 --> 01:14:47,424
Marriage is a union between
two people who love each other.

813
01:14:47,479 --> 01:14:52,949
You have to support each other, so it
can't be an empty promise.

814
01:14:55,857 --> 01:14:58,432
Will Sjakie be coming?

815
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:02,006
I thought so, but you know him.
He's rather selfish.

816
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:03,608
He only thinks of himself.

817
01:15:03,844 --> 01:15:07,300
They're a beautiful couple, aren't they?
-I wouldn't know.

818
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:10,436
Aren't you happy for Ma?
Can't you see how she looks at him?

819
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:13,895
He's homeless. He's never eaten
off a plate.

820
01:15:13,999 --> 01:15:17,403
We might have to serve his dinner in
a garbage bin.

821
01:15:17,507 --> 01:15:21,861
And we can't read the paper anymore,
because he doesn't use sheets.

822
01:15:21,966 --> 01:15:29,063
I'd now like to join Geertruida Flodder
and Robert Van Zuylenhof Tot Voorstal.

823
01:15:29,168 --> 01:15:30,432
He has a strange name.

824
01:15:30,537 --> 01:15:34,838
If anyone objects to this marriage,
speak now...

825
01:15:34,942 --> 01:15:36,287
Don't you dare.

826
01:15:36,956 --> 01:15:40,934
or forever hold your tongue.

827
01:15:41,389 --> 01:15:43,427
Stop, don't get married!

828
01:15:43,596 --> 01:15:45,269
Stop this wedding!

829
01:15:45,373 --> 01:15:47,647
What's Sjakie doing?

830
01:15:52,704 --> 01:15:55,707
Let me see if I understood.

831
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:59,869
If Ma marries...
-you lose the house in Zonnedael.

832
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:02,495
That sounds pretty bad.
Right, Ma?

833
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:06,137
I wasn't listening. Why did we have
to stop?

834
01:16:06,241 --> 01:16:08,227
I'll explain it to her.

835
01:16:08,331 --> 01:16:14,133
Only the 7 of us can live in our house.
We can't add anyone.

836
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:17,665
You can't marry.
-Watch me.

837
01:16:17,769 --> 01:16:20,923
If you get married, we lose our
house.

838
01:16:21,027 --> 01:16:23,013
Did you hear what I said?
We continue.

839
01:16:23,117 --> 01:16:27,645
You'll be spending your wedding night
in a cardboard box.

840
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:31,118
Love conquers everything.

841
01:16:31,222 --> 01:16:33,977
She's crazy.
-Yes, about him.

842
01:16:34,582 --> 01:16:38,152
That was close. Van Kooten almost
ruined everything.

843
01:16:38,257 --> 01:16:41,074
We've already done the first part.

844
01:16:41,123 --> 01:16:44,376
So if there are no further objections
against this marriage...

845
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,168
Now what?

846
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,102
What's all this about?

847
01:17:11,206 --> 01:17:14,976
We're about to perform a marriage.
-You'll have to do without this groom.

848
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,345
We first want to have a word
with him.

849
01:17:17,794 --> 01:17:19,328
How did you find me, Daniлl?

850
01:17:19,432 --> 01:17:21,262
Do you know those shop-window
dummies?

851
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:24,144
Yes, they're my children.
-What?

852
01:17:24,248 --> 01:17:27,260
I'm sorry, Geertruida.
-You're not a poor bum at all.

853
01:17:27,384 --> 01:17:30,343
I'm pretty comfortable, actually.

854
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:32,358
So you've been pulling my leg
all this time.

855
01:17:32,462 --> 01:17:34,107
I would have told you everything.

856
01:17:34,281 --> 01:17:36,868
Filthy liar.

857
01:17:37,889 --> 01:17:39,419
Relax, Ma.

858
01:17:39,523 --> 01:17:41,435
We were just in time to stop this.

859
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:43,032
Bunch of parasites.

860
01:17:43,136 --> 01:17:46,068
You can forget about the inheritance.
-Parachutes?

861
01:17:46,237 --> 01:17:47,186
Inheritance?

862
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:49,511
They don't care about the money,
Daniлl.

863
01:17:49,615 --> 01:17:52,055
They thought I was a poor bum.

864
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,378
So what are you, con man?

865
01:17:55,579 --> 01:18:00,806
Relax, he's rich. That's not
so bad.

866
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:05,558
What kind of inheritance are we
talking about? 100,000?

867
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,656
See, they're already after your
money, dad.

868
01:18:08,761 --> 01:18:13,112
That wouldn't have happened if you
had kept your mouth shut.

869
01:18:13,216 --> 01:18:15,053
And that applies to all of you.

870
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:17,658
Selfish bunch!

871
01:18:19,072 --> 01:18:21,195
It's because of you that I went
into hiding.

872
01:18:22,038 --> 01:18:26,379
And your money is safe. No one
can touch it.

873
01:18:26,895 --> 01:18:30,285
I only wanted some peace.

874
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:33,440
Away from all the billion
dollar deals.

875
01:18:33,545 --> 01:18:36,611
And from the mergers and
the transactions.

876
01:18:37,111 --> 01:18:40,949
Just get back to myself again.

877
01:18:41,475 --> 01:18:43,577
Enjoy daily life.

878
01:18:43,681 --> 01:18:45,858
Falling in love.
-And lying your ass off.

879
01:18:45,994 --> 01:18:48,777
Stick that money up your nose.
I'm going home.

880
01:18:48,881 --> 01:18:49,837
The wedding's over.

881
01:18:49,941 --> 01:18:53,038
I was supposed to catch
the flowers.

882
01:18:53,142 --> 01:18:55,739
You should have told us about
the billion dollar deals.

883
01:18:55,843 --> 01:18:59,237
Johnnie could have helped. He's
very good at dealing.

884
01:19:35,243 --> 01:19:38,464
Sjakie, I'm sorry.

885
01:19:38,568 --> 01:19:41,540
The damage has been done.

886
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:45,336
Did they lose their house?
-No, they didn't.

887
01:19:45,441 --> 01:19:47,715
It's about me. I've been hurt.

888
01:19:47,819 --> 01:19:49,749
You betrayed the trust of
a civil servant.

889
01:19:51,081 --> 01:19:53,992
I don't want to see you anymore.
Farewell.

890
01:19:55,143 --> 01:19:59,151
I have to tell you one thing.
-Don't say anything.

891
01:19:59,636 --> 01:20:04,820
I liked you very much but I'm
disappointed in you. Farewell.

892
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,287
Sjakie...

893
01:20:16,501 --> 01:20:18,932
I know I did something very bad.

894
01:20:19,037 --> 01:20:25,857
I want you to know I always enjoyed the
afternoons around the coffee machine.

895
01:20:25,961 --> 01:20:30,783
The better I got to know you,
the more I cared for you.

896
01:20:32,054 --> 01:20:38,127
It's too late. You abused
my trust.

897
01:20:58,384 --> 01:21:02,177
Don't be upset. You did your best.

898
01:21:02,281 --> 01:21:04,986
I'm no longer playing along, dad.

899
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:06,883
You probably don't need to anymore.

900
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:12,354
If we're lucky, our problems will
be solved after all.

901
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:15,865
We don't need that goofy civil
servant.

902
01:21:32,879 --> 01:21:37,769
The things people are capable of.
-Unbelievable.

903
01:21:37,873 --> 01:21:41,655
All that effort to get your house.

904
01:21:41,759 --> 01:21:43,692
I thought that screen test was
weird.

905
01:21:43,797 --> 01:21:46,683
And your father. What a jerk.

906
01:21:46,787 --> 01:21:48,123
Look at your own father!

907
01:21:48,227 --> 01:21:53,160
Amazing how important fine
print can be.

908
01:21:53,264 --> 01:21:56,625
Maybe we should talk to
Mr Van Brandwijk.

909
01:21:56,677 --> 01:22:00,581
That won't help. Be happy that
they failed.

910
01:22:01,461 --> 01:22:04,916
Ma almost ruined everything.
Have you recovered, Ma?

911
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:09,616
Yes, I'm glad I didn't do it. I'd have
had to change last names again.

912
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:13,580
I hope that's the end of the nasty
surprises.

913
01:22:13,685 --> 01:22:17,144
Absolutely. I checked your file
completely.

914
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:19,456
There's nothing strange in it
anymore.

915
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,422
So we can stay here?
-Absolutely.

916
01:22:21,526 --> 01:22:23,898
It's your house and it will be
your house.

917
01:22:23,935 --> 01:22:27,791
I mailed the request for the bi-annual
rent renewal.

918
01:22:27,895 --> 01:22:29,855
That was perfectly in time.

919
01:22:30,906 --> 01:22:32,613
Mirjam.

920
01:22:32,717 --> 01:22:35,354
Another coffee, Sjakie?

921
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:43,111
What's wrong with him?
It wasn't that bad, was it?

922
01:22:43,215 --> 01:22:46,147
I don't think your coffee has
anything to do with it.

923
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:54,499
Is this the Flodder residence?

924
01:22:54,603 --> 01:22:57,326
Are you Mrs Flodder?
-What can I win by answering?

925
01:22:57,525 --> 01:22:59,287
An eviction order.

926
01:23:02,198 --> 01:23:04,188
What are you doing?

927
01:23:04,293 --> 01:23:06,794
Who's that guy, Ma?
-Did you order a paperhanger?

928
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:09,471
What are you doing on our door?
-Can you read?

929
01:23:09,575 --> 01:23:12,690
You have to leave by Wednesday. The rent
hasn't been paid.

930
01:23:18,321 --> 01:23:23,072
You're kicked out of your house?
-By Wednesday. The auction's on Friday.

931
01:23:23,176 --> 01:23:26,581
All because Sjakie couldn't be bothered
to walk to the mailbox.

932
01:23:26,685 --> 01:23:28,764
Can't you do anything?

933
01:23:28,868 --> 01:23:34,549
At moments like this, you need
your friends.

934
01:23:34,653 --> 01:23:41,311
If you need a place to crash...
My shed's full of imitation antiques.

935
01:23:41,415 --> 01:23:44,672
But maybe next week.
-I was thinking of something else.

936
01:23:44,776 --> 01:23:47,733
They're going to auction our house.

937
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:51,851
So anybody with money can buy it.

938
01:23:52,475 --> 01:23:53,741
But you have to have the money.

939
01:23:53,845 --> 01:23:58,762
That's where you come in.
You can all contribute.

940
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:04,638
Kees will pass the glass around.
Let's be generous.

941
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:09,555
It's for a good cause.

942
01:24:18,616 --> 01:24:22,937
I just spent my last coin.

943
01:24:23,467 --> 01:24:25,512
Or else I'd have given it to you.

944
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:32,403
Just give me these then.
-What are you doing?

945
01:24:32,507 --> 01:24:33,446
Hey!
-Thanks.

946
01:24:35,761 --> 01:24:38,338
Thanks a lot, people.

947
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:43,435
This is at least... 150 guilders.

948
01:24:43,539 --> 01:24:46,991
That's not enough, is it?
-Maybe we can buy back the mailbox.

949
01:24:48,305 --> 01:24:50,352
Drinks for everyone.

950
01:24:51,024 --> 01:24:53,337
But I want your help for
something else.

951
01:24:53,441 --> 01:24:56,658
They're kicking us out at 10 am,
on Wednesday.

952
01:24:56,762 --> 01:24:58,429
And we like to sleep in.

953
01:24:58,533 --> 01:25:01,851
It could get wild. Who can we
count on?

954
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:08,166
I have nothing else to do.

955
01:25:08,294 --> 01:25:10,503
Thanks, Simon. Will you bring your
dogs again?

956
01:25:10,608 --> 01:25:14,835
They put them down yesterday. I have
a bone to pick with those cops.

957
01:25:14,939 --> 01:25:19,617
I'll be there too. I lost my job in
the harbor. I need some action.

958
01:25:19,721 --> 01:25:24,951
Me too. Those assholes gave me
a wheel clamp.

959
01:25:25,055 --> 01:25:28,811
They tore one of my best dresses
during the arrest last week.

960
01:25:29,715 --> 01:25:31,560
I'm in too.

961
01:25:31,596 --> 01:25:36,855
I'll bring my karate class
for some practice.

962
01:25:36,959 --> 01:25:39,574
Great, guys. Wednesday is the
big day.

963
01:25:39,678 --> 01:25:45,462
They'll see the Flodders can
put up a fight. Cheers!

964
01:26:10,306 --> 01:26:14,467
Is it finally happening?
-Whether they like it or not.

965
01:26:32,749 --> 01:26:37,682
What do you want?
-Hello, you're moving today.

966
01:26:37,741 --> 01:26:39,314
I don't think so. We have
visitors.

967
01:26:39,418 --> 01:26:43,983
Good, they can help you move.

968
01:26:45,055 --> 01:26:47,397
I don't think so.

969
01:26:50,913 --> 01:26:54,477
You're only making it harder for
yourself.

970
01:27:07,796 --> 01:27:11,563
Better get back in your pedal
cars fast.

971
01:27:11,667 --> 01:27:14,210
She's calling her mother.

972
01:27:15,789 --> 01:27:17,822
Can we get some reinforcements?

973
01:27:17,838 --> 01:27:21,883
If she's calling the same Chinese as we
do, she'll be waiting for a while.

974
01:27:29,941 --> 01:27:33,531
Yes, have a look at that. We know
you by now.

975
01:27:39,065 --> 01:27:41,308
Get in line!

976
01:27:45,115 --> 01:27:48,458
Do you still have a big mouth now?

977
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:55,741
Get all your things and leave
the premises.

978
01:27:55,846 --> 01:27:58,261
I don't think so.

979
01:28:08,107 --> 01:28:10,795
You didn't expect that, did you?

980
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:16,756
It's getting better and better.
-I suggest you get lost.

981
01:28:19,404 --> 01:28:21,546
Get in position now!

982
01:28:21,651 --> 01:28:23,997
Up yours now!

983
01:28:24,612 --> 01:28:27,543
Attack now!
-Get them!

984
01:28:49,389 --> 01:28:53,080
This could take a while.

985
01:29:30,504 --> 01:29:32,897
They can't handle it alone. We have
to help!

986
01:30:12,019 --> 01:30:14,212
Stop, all of you!

987
01:30:14,794 --> 01:30:16,330
Just when it's getting interesting.

988
01:30:16,434 --> 01:30:18,751
The eviction has been postponed.

989
01:30:18,855 --> 01:30:24,786
I made sure you won't have to leave
until after the auction.

990
01:30:24,891 --> 01:30:26,640
Why did no one tell me that?

991
01:30:26,745 --> 01:30:27,684
They only just told me.

992
01:30:32,429 --> 01:30:37,055
Postponed? So we get this again
on Friday?

993
01:30:37,159 --> 01:30:43,191
I found out I can make a bid on your
house too, on behalf of the council.

994
01:30:43,296 --> 01:30:44,724
What?
-During the auction.

995
01:30:44,828 --> 01:30:49,421
The house would become the property
of the city. You'd be safe.

996
01:30:49,523 --> 01:30:53,117
Except for the council.
-Yes, but as long as I'm there.

997
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:55,983
Well done, Sjakie.

998
01:30:56,088 --> 01:30:59,157
Listen, playtime's over.

999
01:31:01,296 --> 01:31:09,335
Thank you all for your help and you're
all invited to Friday's big party.

1000
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:14,933
Party, why?
-Sjakie's going to buy our house.

1001
01:31:46,783 --> 01:31:53,121
I'm glad you've all shown up.

1002
01:31:53,225 --> 01:31:56,308
We have to make an important
decision.

1003
01:31:56,986 --> 01:32:04,137
The impossible is happening on the eve
of our 25th anniversary.

1004
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:07,483
The house of the Flodder family
will be auctioned tomorrow.

1005
01:32:07,587 --> 01:32:11,786
I'm reluctant to ask you what I'm
about to ask you.

1006
01:32:12,484 --> 01:32:14,804
I do it because I love Zonnedael.

1007
01:32:14,908 --> 01:32:17,311
I love everything this suburb
stands for.

1008
01:32:18,129 --> 01:32:22,213
Beauty, style, willpower.

1009
01:32:22,317 --> 01:32:28,043
I'm asking you to buy the house
of the Flodders.

1010
01:32:28,701 --> 01:32:31,910
So we can decide what will happen
to it.

1011
01:32:33,393 --> 01:32:38,914
I propose an increase of the yearly
contribution...

1012
01:32:39,019 --> 01:32:42,292
to 10,000 guilders.

1013
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:47,626
If we don't act, the council will own
the house.

1014
01:32:48,167 --> 01:32:51,202
And I don't need to explain who they
will put in it.

1015
01:32:51,306 --> 01:32:55,345
My wife and I are depositing 20,000
guilders.

1016
01:32:57,067 --> 01:32:59,929
How much is a livable Zonnedael
worth to you?

1017
01:33:30,222 --> 01:33:32,162
You can't park here.

1018
01:33:32,267 --> 01:33:33,998
The parking lot's there.
-Here.

1019
01:33:34,539 --> 01:33:37,053
You park it.
-Do you trust him with your car?

1020
01:33:37,157 --> 01:33:39,976
Absolutely. Those are the
wrong keys.

1021
01:33:50,178 --> 01:33:53,586
You didn't forget your checkbook,
did you?

1022
01:34:00,415 --> 01:34:02,951
When will our house be up?

1023
01:34:03,056 --> 01:34:06,355
13 Netelweg is next.

1024
01:34:06,459 --> 01:34:11,551
And after that they'll do our house?
-13 Netelweg is our house.

1025
01:34:11,655 --> 01:34:15,381
You always give the police
another address.

1026
01:34:15,485 --> 01:34:17,497
What's going to happen, Sjakie?

1027
01:34:17,602 --> 01:34:21,295
Your house will be offered for sale
and everybody can make a bid.

1028
01:34:21,399 --> 01:34:23,500
The highest bidder will get
the house.

1029
01:34:24,266 --> 01:34:27,275
It's starting.
-How far can you go, Sjakie?

1030
01:34:27,379 --> 01:34:31,032
I can go up to 800,000.

1031
01:34:31,136 --> 01:34:35,085
We'll be processing lot 47.

1032
01:34:35,189 --> 01:34:37,826
It's the house at 13 Netelweg.

1033
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:41,177
A luxury villa, built in 1970.
Fairly well maintained.

1034
01:34:41,282 --> 01:34:44,377
But trashed by the last
inhabitants.

1035
01:34:44,482 --> 01:34:45,981
Nice house, isn't it?

1036
01:34:46,085 --> 01:34:48,854
The front yard will have to be dug
out down to 4 meters...

1037
01:34:48,958 --> 01:34:52,532
because of petrol and used oil.

1038
01:34:52,637 --> 01:34:55,169
We never had a problem with that.
-It's ours.

1039
01:34:55,274 --> 01:34:59,521
I'm starting at 250.
-2.50?

1040
01:34:59,625 --> 01:35:00,564
That's 2 and a half guilders.

1041
01:35:00,852 --> 01:35:02,691
We can bid too.

1042
01:35:02,796 --> 01:35:06,016
It means 250 thousand guilders.

1043
01:35:09,067 --> 01:35:11,635
A bid of 300.

1044
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:14,606
Where?
-It's the people from the wedding.

1045
01:35:14,711 --> 01:35:17,803
That's Mr Van Brandwijk. He's the man
who wants to get you out of Zonnedael.

1046
01:35:17,908 --> 01:35:20,101
So that's Ruud.

1047
01:35:20,205 --> 01:35:23,206
No one more than 300?
-Come on Sjakie.

1048
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:26,646
We have a bid of 350.

1049
01:35:27,857 --> 01:35:30,267
400. No one more?

1050
01:35:30,303 --> 01:35:32,894
Just our luck, a party pooper.

1051
01:35:32,998 --> 01:35:33,937
400 going... 500!

1052
01:35:35,906 --> 01:35:37,760
A bid of 500.

1053
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:41,063
550.

1054
01:35:41,167 --> 01:35:44,257
Doofus. He thinks you're bidding.

1055
01:35:44,361 --> 01:35:47,271
550. No one more?

1056
01:35:47,376 --> 01:35:50,612
600.

1057
01:35:50,717 --> 01:35:53,545
This could take a while.

1058
01:35:53,650 --> 01:35:56,328
Until someone runs out of money.

1059
01:35:56,433 --> 01:35:59,279
No one more than 600? 650.

1060
01:36:00,815 --> 01:36:03,561
Mr Van Brandwijk bids 700.

1061
01:36:04,542 --> 01:36:07,702
I can only go to 800.
-700.

1062
01:36:08,458 --> 01:36:11,777
A bid of 800.

1063
01:36:12,971 --> 01:36:16,151
What are you doing?
-I'm bidding for Sjakie. He's so slow.

1064
01:36:16,256 --> 01:36:17,976
Now I can't bid any higher.

1065
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,697
800. No one more than 800?

1066
01:36:21,728 --> 01:36:23,924
Careful, Ruud.

1067
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:26,759
We're already 80,000 over our
limit.

1068
01:36:26,863 --> 01:36:28,267
But we have to get it.

1069
01:36:28,371 --> 01:36:32,615
We have to have the house.
-You're going too far, Ruud.

1070
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:37,158
800 going...
-We've got it, Sjakie.

1071
01:36:37,262 --> 01:36:43,057
800, going, going... 900.

1072
01:36:43,094 --> 01:36:46,876
I'm fed up with your Flodder
obsession.

1073
01:36:48,245 --> 01:36:54,872
900, going...
-Well, that was it.

1074
01:36:54,977 --> 01:36:56,654
I'm sorry.

1075
01:36:56,759 --> 01:36:59,372
Going, going...

1076
01:37:00,735 --> 01:37:02,933
We have a bid of a million.

1077
01:37:03,793 --> 01:37:05,562
Who's that guy?

1078
01:37:05,667 --> 01:37:08,686
Who's that? He can't be with
the Flodders.

1079
01:37:08,867 --> 01:37:11,143
I don't think so. Look at
his clothes.

1080
01:37:11,247 --> 01:37:15,072
One million... going...

1081
01:37:15,176 --> 01:37:19,457
going... sold to that gentleman.

1082
01:37:19,562 --> 01:37:21,191
For one million guilders.

1083
01:37:22,009 --> 01:37:29,367
Thanks, Sjakie.
-We'll find something else, Sjakie.

1084
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,515
What will you do? You have no
house anymore.

1085
01:37:43,619 --> 01:37:45,898
No roof over your head.
-Yes, that sucks.

1086
01:37:46,003 --> 01:37:49,873
But what really sucks is that we have
invited everybody to the party.

1087
01:37:49,978 --> 01:37:52,560
These keys, sir...
-You already got it for me, thanks.

1088
01:37:53,304 --> 01:37:55,172
Geertruida.

1089
01:37:57,293 --> 01:38:00,078
I said I never wanted to see you
anymore.

1090
01:38:00,183 --> 01:38:02,026
I wanted to see you one more time.

1091
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:06,802
You picked quite a moment.
-I'm really sorry.

1092
01:38:08,303 --> 01:38:10,678
I never meant to hurt you.

1093
01:38:10,783 --> 01:38:13,303
How are you?
-None of your business. Not good.

1094
01:38:13,407 --> 01:38:15,603
We're on our way to the poorhouse.

1095
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,245
And how do you live?

1096
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:21,224
I think we can be content.

1097
01:38:21,329 --> 01:38:23,554
The buyer didn't exactly look poor.

1098
01:38:23,658 --> 01:38:26,558
We got rid of those Flodders and it
didn't cost us a cent.

1099
01:38:26,662 --> 01:38:29,400
What's happening there? Is that
the bum?

1100
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:38,503
Do you know each other?
-Yes, he's my secretary.

1101
01:38:39,627 --> 01:38:43,353
Geertruida, we had a great week
together.

1102
01:38:43,481 --> 01:38:51,144
I'd like to do something for you.
For all of you.

1103
01:38:51,248 --> 01:38:55,225
This is the deed to the house.

1104
01:38:55,344 --> 01:38:59,821
This makes you the owners.
See it as a farewell gift.

1105
01:39:03,265 --> 01:39:06,587
Did you see that? The Flodders got
their house back.

1106
01:39:06,692 --> 01:39:10,569
What kind of secret deal is that?
-I'm surprised too.

1107
01:39:10,673 --> 01:39:13,424
I don't think we can do anything
about it.

1108
01:39:13,528 --> 01:39:16,643
So they can stay in that house?

1109
01:39:16,748 --> 01:39:18,966
I'm afraid so.

1110
01:39:19,618 --> 01:39:21,267
That's unbelievable.

1111
01:39:21,371 --> 01:39:23,660
How can this happen in a democracy?

1112
01:39:23,764 --> 01:39:27,116
You're a strange person.
We're having a party tonight.

1113
01:39:27,221 --> 01:39:30,263
If you can escape your children,
you're welcome.

1114
01:39:30,368 --> 01:39:33,686
But don't get any ideas.

1115
01:39:33,791 --> 01:39:36,855
That you gave us the house doesn't
mean anything.

1116
01:39:37,457 --> 01:39:42,356
You were just a bit short. Don't you
have any gold teeth?

1117
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:44,565
Don't let him provoke you.

1118
01:39:44,669 --> 01:39:50,750
We're having a party tonight. Can we
park some cars in front of your house?

1119
01:39:57,205 --> 01:39:59,790
He's a sore loser.

1120
01:39:59,894 --> 01:40:02,665
What a hothead.
-Did you invite him to the party?

1121
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:06,613
No, he takes up too much room on the
dance floor.

1122
01:40:30,626 --> 01:40:34,878
Found a nice girl, Sjakie?
-This is Mirjam.

1123
01:40:36,066 --> 01:40:39,280
Everything ended well, so we
made up.

1124
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:44,499
She's sorry.
-I'm sorry that I caused you problems.

1125
01:40:44,603 --> 01:40:48,875
Forgive and forget. The beer's in
the kitchen.

1126
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:56,207
Going for the jackpot, Sjakie?
-Nice little legs.

1127
01:41:13,626 --> 01:41:16,060
Those kids of yours.
-What about them?

1128
01:41:16,164 --> 01:41:19,860
They're alright.
-You've got a bunch of creeps.

1129
01:41:19,965 --> 01:41:22,810
They've got that from their mother.
She was always after my money too.

1130
01:41:22,914 --> 01:41:26,936
Poor you.
-I'll get them, just wait.

1131
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,645
How will you do that?

1132
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:33,449
When I die, all my money goes to the
whales. My kids get nothing.

1133
01:41:33,553 --> 01:41:36,206
Do they know that?
-Of course not.

1134
01:41:36,310 --> 01:41:41,020
They can find out at the funeral.
-Bastard.

1135
01:41:41,124 --> 01:41:45,161
It's just a shame I can't be there.

1136
01:42:15,681 --> 01:42:19,509
Did we have a meeting?

1137
01:42:19,613 --> 01:42:23,898
We have an unpleasant announcement.

1138
01:42:28,915 --> 01:42:32,247
Ruud, what's wrong? What
happened?

1139
01:42:32,352 --> 01:42:35,510
They kicked me out of the committee.
-What?

1140
01:42:35,614 --> 01:42:38,791
I'm no longer chairman.
-Well I'll be.

1141
01:42:38,896 --> 01:42:42,960
I bet that's Liesbeth's idea.
She always wanted your position.

1142
01:42:43,172 --> 01:42:47,750
Call the mayor and tell him you
won't accept this.

1143
01:42:48,311 --> 01:42:52,217
This means we've also lost our seats
of honor.

1144
01:42:52,721 --> 01:42:55,886
I didn't have a dress made for nothing.
2500 guilders.

1145
01:42:55,990 --> 01:43:00,106
And Liesbeth will take the credit for
our work.

1146
01:43:01,339 --> 01:43:04,296
Hello, mayor.

1147
01:43:05,116 --> 01:43:09,179
Yes, I know what time it is. My husband
wanted to talk to you.

1148
01:43:10,009 --> 01:43:11,842
Ruud?

1149
01:44:17,388 --> 01:44:19,765
I chose those wall lights. Nice, no?

1150
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:23,981
And check out the tiles in the
bathroom.

1151
01:44:29,781 --> 01:44:31,497
You should see it in daylight.

1152
01:44:32,531 --> 01:44:34,736
What about this room?

1153
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:37,647
Did you decorate this too?
-I don't think so.

1154
01:44:37,751 --> 01:44:39,403
Although...

1155
01:46:01,392 --> 01:46:04,068
Kees, I can explain.

1156
01:46:13,892 --> 01:46:18,693
He taught me that yesterday. He said
it could come in handy.

1157
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:48,684
Hey, go away.

1158
01:48:56,334 --> 01:48:58,393
Bloody hell.

1159
01:49:08,667 --> 01:49:13,134
Our car.
-Yes, I'm very shocked.

1160
01:49:13,238 --> 01:49:14,842
You should screw over
the insurance.

1161
01:49:15,079 --> 01:49:17,791
I mean the old man. He's fooled us
for years.

1162
01:49:19,856 --> 01:49:21,972
What's with the terrible noise?

1163
01:49:22,076 --> 01:49:23,902
The neighbors have company.

1164
01:49:33,218 --> 01:49:37,889
Can't they warn us when they
throw a party?

1165
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:27,132
What was that loud bang?

1166
01:50:27,236 --> 01:50:30,107
It can't be the fireworks. That's
tomorrow.

1167
01:50:36,754 --> 01:50:41,796
I hope they won't overdo it.
Pepita doesn't like loud sounds.

1168
01:51:00,282 --> 01:51:05,711
Have you been smoking in secret again?
-What makes you think that?

1169
01:51:05,815 --> 01:51:09,372
You can't fool me. I smell smoke.

1170
01:51:13,874 --> 01:51:16,957
What a strange dog.

1171
01:51:17,061 --> 01:51:18,725
Yes, unusual.

1172
01:51:18,829 --> 01:51:21,024
Wouldn't he know?

1173
01:51:37,485 --> 01:51:39,494
602 here, go ahead.

1174
01:51:39,598 --> 01:51:46,103
We're getting reports about a car
driving through gardens. Go have a look.

1175
01:51:46,208 --> 01:51:48,737
Understood, we'll have a look.

1176
01:51:49,291 --> 01:51:51,877
I bet that's those Flodders again.

1177
01:51:58,516 --> 01:52:03,505
That's terrible, Johnnie.
-I wanted a new car anyway.

1178
01:52:04,111 --> 01:52:08,023
That fire! Has the fire department
been called?

1179
01:52:08,128 --> 01:52:11,277
Where's the police?
-Too many questions, Sjakie.

1180
01:52:11,381 --> 01:52:13,598
It's starting there too.

1181
01:52:13,702 --> 01:52:15,456
I don't think anyone's home there.

1182
01:52:17,429 --> 01:52:20,997
Unbelievable how it burns.

1183
01:52:21,101 --> 01:52:24,457
That's because of the cheap building
materials.

1184
01:52:27,571 --> 01:52:29,359
Look out!

1185
01:52:57,780 --> 01:53:00,938
This is 602 with an emergency.
-Go ahead.

1186
01:53:01,042 --> 01:53:05,073
Zonnedael is burning.
-Do you find that funny, 602?

1187
01:53:05,177 --> 01:53:08,668
It's no joke. The whole suburb's
on fire.

1188
01:53:39,716 --> 01:53:42,550
Everything alright?

1189
01:53:43,637 --> 01:53:46,033
Water, water!

1190
01:53:50,943 --> 01:53:54,938
I told you not to eat too many
peppers.

1191
01:54:20,232 --> 01:54:23,503
SALE
3 BOTTLES OF METHS FOR THE PRICE OF 1

1192
01:54:32,252 --> 01:54:35,182
Stop the car!

1193
01:54:58,010 --> 01:55:01,015
What's with those sounds?

1194
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:04,410
Maybe it's about the 25th
anniversary.

1195
01:55:04,514 --> 01:55:07,678
I can't reach the fire department.
They're busy.

1196
01:55:07,782 --> 01:55:09,557
Maybe they have the night off.

1197
01:55:30,074 --> 01:55:33,555
Careful, it's dangerous.

1198
01:55:40,116 --> 01:55:43,491
Pepita!

1199
01:55:51,721 --> 01:55:54,392
Careful, the fireworks!

1200
01:57:41,467 --> 01:57:46,220
Great party. I didn't expect that from
your neighbors.

1201
01:57:46,324 --> 01:57:51,491
If they keep this up, they won't last
until 26 years.

1202
01:57:51,595 --> 01:57:55,839
Yes, this could get out of hand.

1203
01:57:55,943 --> 01:57:59,714
I hope they don't go on for too long.
I want to have a good sleep.

1204
01:58:43,829 --> 01:58:47,224
My car, my car!

1205
01:59:49,529 --> 01:59:54,434
Finally we have our own house, and now
we don't have any neighbors.

1206
01:59:54,538 --> 01:59:59,796
Great we can play loud music.
-They emptied our entire swimming pool.

1207
01:59:59,901 --> 02:00:01,912
They didn't even say goodbye.

1208
02:00:02,016 --> 02:00:05,107
Who?
-Those losers from our suburb.

1209
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:09,371
They all just left.
-Why do you care, Ma?

1210
02:00:09,588 --> 02:00:14,460
Well... you know... they'll always
be your neighbors!
