1
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,084
Put those things away.
-Why?

2
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,762
No binoculars at Christmas breakfast.
Put them away!

3
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,841
Give them here!

4
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,004
Come along boys, no bickering.
-I'm not bickering.

5
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,202
No, I'm bickering!
-Set a good example for once.

6
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,448
Let your son set a good
example for once.

7
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,405
Is he only my son all of a sudden?
-Aren't I your son?

8
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,729
You don't take after me, at any rate.
Victor, how can you say that?

9
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,446
Your eyes, your hair-lines,
your walks...

10
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,608
That's not what I mean.

11
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,121
He means that I haven't got a
single good quality; and he has.

12
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,721
Is that what you mean?
-Yes, that's what I mean.

13
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,207
With those good qualities
he became an admysteryiator.

14
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,926
Administrator, and I'm not
an administrator.

15
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,485
Your father is sub-manager.

16
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,446
Oh, I thought he was an admysteryiator.
Administrator!

17
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,563
Are you sure about that?
I still think it's...

18
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,161
Administrator!

19
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,641
We haven't wished each other
Merry Christmas yet.

20
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,251
Merry Christmas.

21
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,771
Merry Christmas.

22
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,248
And let's for once try to have
Christmas breakfast...

23
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,444
...without any arguments.
-But there aren't any arguments.

24
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,247
No, I'm just wishing us a Merry
Christmas breakfast without arguments.

25
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,125
Then there will be an argument.

26
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,890
Why must you bloody-well
reverse everything?

27
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,122
I'm putting things straight.

28
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,005
Straight to you, imbicile!

29
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,691
Stop it.

30
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,650
Now there is an argument.
Because you accentuated it.

31
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,083
Is that so surprising? Every
Christmas breakfast I can remember...

32
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,806
...has been permeated with discord.

33
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,561
Because up till now you've said at the
beginning of every Christmas breakfast...

34
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,730
...with that Christmas-breakfast
look in your eyes:

35
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,571
"Let's for once try to have
a Christmas breakfast...

36
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,046
...without any arguments."

37
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,171
And every year you manage with those
nasty wolfish eyes of yours...

38
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,761
...to completely poison
the atmosphere.

39
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,930
Hey, did you hear that?
He's just asking for an argument.

40
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,521
You mustn't try and push things
to extremes, Victor.

41
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,371
I say, the salmon is delicious.

42
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,883
Isn't it? Shrimps the whole time.
I thought let's have salmon.

43
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,763
I've never been a one for shrimps.
He always wants shrimps.

44
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,610
What?

45
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,643
I don't even like shrimps, you're
the one who always wants shrimps.

46
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,840
Dove, who is it that always
wants shrimps?

47
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,766
Dove?

48
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,968
Your father is right.

49
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,806
So I'm lying?

50
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,447
So I'm lying?!

51
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,844
I'm not saying that.
But you did always want shrimps.

52
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,326
So I'm lying then!

53
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,765
Say I'm lying.

54
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,686
You're lying.

55
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,847
Now, that's heaﬂenings I must say.

56
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,568
Your own mother calling you a liar.

57
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,244
You're ganging up together,
I knew it, against me.

58
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,763
Why do I still live here?

59
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,284
Because you're an imbicile
who doesn't dare to go outside.

60
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,407
We want to have a serious talk
with you.

61
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,523
Your father's got a plan.

62
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,884
You'll soon be thirty one.
-Thirty two.

63
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,044
Tomorrow we're going to the dunes.
-A quiet, secluded spot.

64
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,931
You mustn't think anything more of it,
we're just going out.

65
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,721
Fresh air's good for you.

66
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,050
We're going in the car,
we won't see another soul.

67
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,291
And what about those gin-traps?

68
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,321
I'll walk on ahead and beat
the ground with a stick.

69
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,883
Yeah, and then of course we'll
get lost.

70
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,570
I know exactly what will happen.

71
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,084
We won't get lost, Abel.
Your father's taking a compass.

72
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,850
Your mother's making a bag
full of food.

73
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,963
Nothing can happen to us.

74
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,844
What about stray bullets?

75
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,610
There are hunters in the dunes,
you know.

76
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,088
How often hav you read that:
"Man hit by stray bullet"?

77
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,930
There's no hunting in the dunes,
is there?

78
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,487
Of course not, just a few
rabbit-snares, that's all.

79
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,081
Right, and who sets them?

80
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,329
Poachers, that's who.
They're all inbred.

81
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,251
They go stark raving mad if anyone
ventures onto their hunting-grounds.

82
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,010
D'you know what?
We'll take a guide with us.

83
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,168
And two bearers, and guns
and ammunition...

84
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,562
...and a first-aid kit,
and beads.

85
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,809
And a mosquito-net and a sextant.

86
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,241
We're not going into
the bloody jungle!

87
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,371
There's nothing wrong.

88
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,325
Just answer the psychiatrisfs
questions.

89
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,602
Psychiatrist?

90
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,883
I'm not retarded, am I?
-That's for the psychiatrist to decide.

91
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,082
Doctor van Boven, this is Abel.

92
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,365
Abel, act normally.

93
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,969
Doctor, don't be misled.
This is just play-acting.

94
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,883
What's your name, lad?

95
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,848
For God's sake Abel,
stop that nonsense!

96
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,322
Doctor, you understand that he's
just putting this on?

97
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,844
Yes, I understand. I'm not retarded.
-No, of course not.

98
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,283
The question is, what is the cause?

99
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,404
Oh, I can tell you right away.

100
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,923
Please sit down.

101
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,807
How long is it since Abel
has been outside?

102
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,731
Two years.
-Ten years.

103
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,641
And for ten years he's been
trying to cut flies in half.

104
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,891
When Abel was born,
where there any complications?

105
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,525
Yes.

106
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,327
Where do you get that idea from?
-Well, it was a long, painful delivery.

107
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,410
Abel was blue,
he had difficulty breathing.

108
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,364
What are you talking about?

109
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,689
You were there, at the birth?

110
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,840
Yes, of course, yes.

111
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,090
Well, I was in the corridor, but
I know exactly what happened.

112
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,683
The first few weeks he had signs
of slight paralysis.

113
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,291
And around the age of fourteen
eczema in his armpits.

114
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,529
According to our doctor,
the result of nervousness.

115
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,960
Now, this is going beyond
all reason!

116
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,721
Please, admit that none
of this is true!

117
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,807
I don't want to draw any
conclusions straight away.

118
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,483
But I can't help feeling that
the root of the problem...

119
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,171
...a major pan of it anyway,
lies with the father.

120
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,486
What?

121
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,210
Yes, look, you're ashamed of Abel.

122
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,050
Wouldn't you be ashamed of
a son like that?

123
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,971
That's got nothing to do with it.

124
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,764
The other pad...

125
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,849
...the root of the problem,
lies with the mother.

126
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,128
You see, you over-protect your son.

127
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,641
Both your attitudes as parents
are in conflict...

128
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,969
...and because of this, the lad
finds himself in a vacuum.

129
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,885
Before we get around to Abel...

130
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,402
...it would be advisable for you
to come to a mutual agreement...

131
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,570
...within your relationship.

132
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,042
I'll be hearing from you.

133
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,842
Well, that's that.

134
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,445
You're rushing things, sir.
I'm not used to...

135
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,327
Being made love to?
-Being made love to...

136
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,570
So brazenly.
-So brazenly.

137
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,000
Again!

138
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,489
You're rushing things, sir.
I'm not used to being...

139
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,011
This is such a rotten line.

140
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,727
That rotten line
encapulates how Maggie is feeling.

141
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,442
Because Maggie is feeling so
uncomfortable...

142
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,325
...she expresses herself
in a likewise way.

143
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,729
And that's why, in this situation,
it's a good line.

144
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,845
And something else, when Victor
tries to kiss you...

145
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,045
...you've got to show much more
bewilderment.

146
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,847
Imagine that you've never been
kissed by a man before.

147
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,449
And Victor, over-play it, eh?
Make it difficult for Christine.

148
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,166
We can always water it down later.

149
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,929
Bewilderment, Christine.
Disgust, disgust!

150
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,211
What is it now?!
-I just don't feel this, you know.

151
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,528
Do we have to watch this
for much longer?...

152
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,484
This is an impoﬂand moment.

153
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,251
We're going to carry on
until it's right.

154
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,090
And Christine, relax!

155
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,204
The mere thought of a kiss
repulses you.

156
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,761
I'm nearly thirty two, and I've still
never watched television.

157
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,561
We don't need Victor anyway
to buy a television.

158
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,003
Every month your father gives
a fixed sum of money...

159
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,486
...and at the end of the month
it's all gone.

160
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,685
I know that. Look at how we eat.

161
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,970
The whole time it's...
salmon, oysters, lobsters.

162
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,685
Four course meals.

163
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,405
And all those new clothes,
new shoes.

164
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,731
When summer's on the way
I get new clothes.

165
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,524
What use are they to me?

166
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,930
You stop buying new clothes.

167
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,284
We down the meals. Within a month,
we'll have a television.

168
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,403
THE NAKED GIRLS

169
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,127
No hors-dbeuvre?
-Didn't get round to it today.

170
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,284
De Beer has been sacked.
-De Beer?

171
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,090
How often have I mentioned that name?
It must be a thousand times.

172
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,523
I don't know de Beer.
-A colleague.

173
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,242
What's this?
-A fish finger.

174
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:45,810
A fish finger?

175
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,571
What kind of a hideous little
fish finger is this?

176
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,451
Tell us about de Beer.
-Yes.

177
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,085
He's been sacked.
-Because?

178
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,121
Because he was carrying on with
Merkelbach's wife.

179
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,607
Merkelbach?

180
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,202
Yes, Merkelbach. Who could be that?
-No idea.

181
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,131
Come now, Abel.
Your father's boss.

182
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,085
I say, what's going on?
Only one vegetable?

183
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,329
The people behind the Iron Curtain...

184
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,091
...would lick their lips at the
sight of a fish finger.

185
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,967
And those people work the
whole day long.

186
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,128
They go into the steelfactory
before it's light...

187
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,243
...and don't come out
until it's dark again.

188
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,209
If you ever see a photograph
of Russians...

189
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,920
...in a park, then they
all have little eyes.

190
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,690
Enough!

191
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,722
What do you think of that then?

192
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,611
Of what?
-A secret affair like that?

193
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,324
Well, as long as it's a secret affair,
I've nothing against it.

194
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,330
How old is she?
-Who?

195
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,367
Merkelbach's wife.
-Thirty eight or so.

196
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,609
Still fertile as well.

197
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,529
I don't understand de Beer.

198
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,609
If you wanted to have a
secret affair...

199
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,929
...then you'd choose someone
infertile wouldn't you?

200
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,610
What if she got pregnant?

201
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,848
It could just as well be
Merkelbach's child.

202
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,930
With a face like de Beer?

203
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,771
What kind of a face has he
got then?

204
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,804
A bit ruddy,
with eyes like a cod-fish.

205
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,411
Where do you get that idea?

206
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,447
De Beer is palid,
with piggy little eyes.

207
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,041
Who's got the ruddy face
and the cod-eyes then?

208
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,925
That's Prokovsky, isn't it?
-Oh, you know him then?

209
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,011
Yes, you've mentioned him before.
Prokovsky, didn't he have asthma?

210
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,680
Yes, he's been in a sanatorium
for three years.

211
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,723
It must be great in a sanatorium...

212
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,970
...lying in bed all day, television,
people looking after you...

213
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,245
What is it?

214
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,207
What's for afters?
What's going on?

215
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,883
No hors-d'oeuvre, one fish finger,
one vegetable, no afters.

216
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,811
I'm not a bloody proletarian!

217
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,847
So, this is Abel then.

218
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,560
You don't want to go outside?

219
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,323
Are you frightened of me?

220
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,649
Good. Then we've already
got somewhere.

221
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,161
What's this?
We shan't be needing those here.

222
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,086
So, come along.

223
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,965
Madame, didn't I ask you to remove all
the silver from the room?

224
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,729
I did do.

225
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,002
Yes but, there is silver present.

226
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,801
I just can't work like this.
-But, I did remove all the silver.

227
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,449
Honestly!

228
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,886
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm
not a metal detector.

229
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,880
Please get in touch when the room
is free of silver. Good afternoon.

230
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,329
Why haven't we got a television,
anyway?

231
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,051
It would be nice for Abel as well.

232
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,168
I mean, what does a boy like him see?

233
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,442
He sees enough, more than enough.

234
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,483
But always the same.

235
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,969
On the television you see completely
different things.

236
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,163
Programmes about termites
for instance.

237
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,601
Relevant to him, termites.

238
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,242
God, they broadcast other things
as well, don't they?

239
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,809
A television could change
Abel's way of thinking.

240
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,651
There's going to be no television
in this house.

241
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,721
It's nearly New Year.

242
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,048
Goodness, already?

243
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,163
Where are the fireworks?
-Strange.

244
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,162
I know a nice game.

245
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,365
We have to pretend that we
don't know each other.

246
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,686
Yes! Hello, sir.
I don't know you.

247
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,648
I don't know you either.
-My name's Abel.

248
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,763
What a coincidence, so's mine.

249
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,729
That's impossible, you're Victor.

250
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,490
Isn't it too confusing if you're
called Abel as well?

251
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,889
But I think it's silly
if you're called Abel as well.

252
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,525
Yes, it's silly.

253
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,529
Why not Fred, or Harry.

254
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,722
Right, Harry then.

255
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,847
I say Harry, are you married?
-Certainly. To a very stupid woman.

256
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,202
I'm not stupid.

257
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,125
Who is that lady?
-I don't know her.

258
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,691
I'd like to introduce myself.

259
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,689
I'd rather you didn't.

260
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,282
I'd rather she didn't either.
-I'm playing as well, you know.

261
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,962
Hey, Dove. It's only a game, isn't it?
-Yes, between the three of us!

262
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,969
You're playing too, aren't you?

263
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,491
Not if I can introduce myself.

264
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,445
But that's the game.
You've got to butt in.

265
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,484
I say, Abel, I've got two tickets
for the horse-races.

266
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,727
Do you feel like coming?

267
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,766
Yes, I'd like that.
-Can I ask you something?

268
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,047
Did you hear something?
-No, I didn't hear a thing.

269
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,330
What's this? How can I butt in then?

270
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,886
I just heard it again.

271
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,282
I heard something as well this time.

272
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,766
Why are you stopping?

273
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,844
Victor was walking on the other side
of the street. He crossed over.

274
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,563
And I saw him but he didn't strike.

275
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,202
And suddenly he was standing
in front of me.

276
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,771
And he said: "Would you like
to have a drink with me?"

277
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,601
I hesitated, after all
he was a stranger.

278
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,764
Then he did something which...

279
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,522
...it threw me right off guard.
-What did he do then?

280
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,006
He looked at me...

281
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,006
...a bit severely actually...

282
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,963
...and he raised his hand to my head.

283
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,647
It made me jump a bit.

284
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,443
He stroked a lock of hair
out of my eyes...

285
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,803
...like that... behind my ear.

286
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,441
That's the way to do it,
very gently.

287
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,331
Abel doesn't even know what
a negro is, just to name one thing.

288
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,649
Everyone knows what a negro is.

289
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,246
Even so, a television wouldn't
do him any harm.

290
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,886
Television is a load of nonsense.

291
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,802
Strange men and women
laughing at you.

292
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,890
They can't even see you.
"So nice to have you with us again."

293
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,801
Ridiculous!
I'm not there...

294
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,765
...you're not either,
and neither is Abel.

295
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,005
What about a nice film?

296
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,362
Now, that's an even bigger
load of rubbish.

297
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,770
Take a cowboy film. This cowboy,
hasn't he got any parents...

298
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,882
...whom he visits from
time to time?

299
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,323
Or have those parents died?
Is this cowboy a foundling?

300
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,931
Has he got brothers and sisters?

301
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,282
Has he had an education?

302
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,687
Not a word about that, no.

303
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,248
If you're on stage you don't
say to the audience:

304
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,603
"I'm so-and-so, I went
to grammar school...

305
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,801
...and I've got two brothers."

306
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,287
Of course not. But it comes up
in that piece.

307
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,881
I play an Earl,
who's fallen on hard times...

308
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,208
...and I say to the person
playing the opposite me...

309
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,007
Christine, yes, that I have studied.

310
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,921
The detective you played last year
never mentioned his education.

311
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,043
That was a rotten play.

312
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,806
First I want the kitchen painted.

313
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,084
You shake hands with her
and introduce yourself.

314
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,966
Don't squeeze! Normal.

315
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,166
Not like a damp sponge.
Normal, a normal handshake.

316
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,081
Hello, I'm Abel.

317
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,691
You see, there's nothing to it.

318
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,091
And then you say something.
-This evening, I will.

319
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,850
This evening, my foot! Now!

320
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,451
I could say anything.
It depends on her as well.

321
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,325
Nothing depends on her.
It depends on you.

322
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,807
She's unsure of herself,
you have to put her at ease.

323
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,331
She could be the first to say
something as well?

324
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,965
She won't be the first!

325
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,844
How do you know?
-That's how it goes.

326
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,921
The man speaks, and the woman
replies... now and then. And then...

327
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,042
I say: "What's that smell?"
-That's not what you say.

328
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,641
It is, because then she'll say:
"That's my perfume."

329
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,446
And then I'll say: "Mmm, nice..."

330
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,166
Or: "Pooh, horrible."
That depends on her perfume.

331
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,283
You say: "Mmm, nice"! Understood?

332
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,569
Even if she smells of sweat,
or chips?

333
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,410
She doesn't smell of chips.

334
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,922
But she's working-class,
and they smell of chips.

335
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,729
Did you impart this gem?

336
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,288
Lots of poor people smell of chips.
Haven't you ever noticed?

337
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,244
She doesn't come from
a working-class family...

338
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,330
...so she doesn't smell of chips.

339
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,603
She smells nice! You say: "Mmm, nice",
or "Mmm, lovely"...

340
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,485
...and not: "Pooh, horrible'.
"Mmm, lovely"!

341
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,685
And Dove will echo that
with a friendly look. Yes?

342
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,804
Then she says: "Thank you".

343
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,408
A brief silence is in order,
and then you continue.

344
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,126
I ask: "Would you care for a drink?"

345
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,323
And then she will of course ask me
"What have you got?"

346
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,043
Dove?

347
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:39,123
Beer, wine, coffee, tea,
sherry, whisky...

348
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,924
...various liqeurs and gin.

349
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,806
And mineral water?
Because she's a tee-totaller.

350
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,163
And mineral water.

351
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,049
While Dove's pouring the drinks,
you staﬂ breaking the ice.

352
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,446
Something about the Iron Curtain?

353
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,007
I don't want to hear the word
Iron Curtain!

354
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,246
Why not? It's something
Abel knows a lot about.

355
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,444
Tonight it's ordinary conversations!

356
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,289
Have you got any brothers
or sisters?

357
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,005
That's it, that's a good question.

358
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,521
Has she got any, then?
-I don't believe she has.

359
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,088
Then it isn't a good question at all.

360
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,565
I ask, why do you do acting,
anyway?

361
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,245
Yes, you ask that.

362
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,726
A conversation develops.

363
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,844
It had better. I want
a spontaneous evening.

364
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,050
One more thing. I want
this understood:

365
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,609
This evening, if I touch
my nose like this...

366
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,125
...then Dove puts a record on
and you ask her to dance.

367
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,689
And if I run my right hand through
my hair, like this...

368
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,084
...then Dove tells that story.

369
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,327
Which story?

370
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,921
The one about the llama in the zoo.

371
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,488
We already know that story.
-We don't already know that story!

372
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,611
Christine, this is Dove, my wife.

373
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,927
Pleased to meet you.

374
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,801
And that is Abel, my son.

375
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,961
Something to drink?
-A glass of gin, perhaps?

376
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,131
Victor must have told you.

377
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,082
Yes... Let's go and sit down.

378
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,082
What a nice plant.

379
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,882
It looks like a tomato plant.

380
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,404
I'm mad about tomatoes.

381
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,521
But I'm not allowed to eat them.

382
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,327
She's mad about tomatoes.

383
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,924
Would you like a tomato?

384
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,522
I'm not allowed to eat them.

385
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,007
Why not?

386
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,330
Aren't you allowed
to eat tomatoes?

387
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,131
Tomatoes belong to the
nightshade family.

388
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,687
Everything which belongs
to that family is bad for you.

389
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,209
Potatoes, for instance, as well.

390
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,562
Potatoes?
-Yes.

391
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,090
Why do you do acting?
-Me?

392
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,806
I like climbing into
someone else's skin.

393
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,043
Can you play things
as well as people?

394
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,523
Things?

395
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:53,924
Could you also climb
into the skin of... a potato?

396
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,211
No, no, I can't do that.

397
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,880
I think you'd make
a very good potato.

398
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,966
Why do you keep touching
your nose?

399
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,563
And now for some more talking.

400
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,562
Isn't it about time
for a nice salty herring?

401
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,686
Not for me, thanks.

402
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,325
Don't you like herring?

403
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,966
Rather! But I'm not allowed
to have it.

404
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,122
Is herring also a member
of the nightshade family?

405
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,402
No, that's impossible.
- Well then.

406
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,487
Herring is bad for your heart.

407
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,727
Dove!

408
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,890
Don't be absurd. Let me go.

409
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,681
Leave them for a while...

410
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,765
Ridiculous, it'll come to nothing.

411
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,407
...the children are too small
to work in the factory...

412
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,922
...so they can't afford
to clothe them.

413
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,490
But their mothers wear
long woollen skids.

414
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,284
And when the children go outside...

415
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,006
...they walk naked under their
mother's skids.

416
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,206
But the cold gives them
pneumonia.

417
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,483
They often die by the walkside.
-Time for a top-up, Dove.

418
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,084
No, thank you.

419
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,090
Fish has to swim, you know.
- But I haven't eaten any fish.

420
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,403
Come on, you don't think
I feel like telling...

421
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,887
...the story about the llama now?
-What are you talking about?

422
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,767
You're out of step, girlie.
You've got to follow Abel.

423
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,441
I can't dance like this, you know.

424
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,731
No.

425
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,688
You're having an affair.

426
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,763
Night-night.

427
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,801
You're having an affair.

428
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,481
You're having an affair with
a beautiful, young, fertile woman.

429
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,647
I can feel it!

430
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,444
Stop it!

431
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,371
Say that you're having an affair.

432
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,648
I'm not having an affair.

433
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,121
Why can't an evening
like this evening...

434
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,641
"because you know how
to fix things, eh...

435
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,081
...be conducted normally?

436
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,607
Why isn't life normal?

437
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,683
Vickie...

438
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,089
Vickie...

439
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,483
Come now, Christine, your lines.
"I'm not used to" etcetera.

440
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,641
Yes, why not?

441
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,088
Very good, carry on.

442
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,209
Are you my little amateur?

443
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,721
Is that surprising?
With this row going on?

444
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,526
Perhaps we should make it
more stimulating.

445
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,049
I did it with a general once,
that was exciting.

446
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,447
Have you had an affair
with a general?

447
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:02,487
He wasn't a general.
He just dressed up as a general.

448
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,160
Oh, you mean I should, er...

449
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,441
You could be something else.

450
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,005
What on earth are you wearing?
- A polo-neck.

451
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,844
I thought you couldn't stand
polo-necks?

452
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,122
Give it here, woman.

453
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,121
Oh, Victor!

454
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,202
What a lovely red mark!

455
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,644
I'm glad that we're all getting
with each other again.

456
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,250
The last time that happened
was, I believe, in 1962.

457
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,404
Give over, Victor.

458
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,687
To show you I'm not a bad sod,
I've decided...

459
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,643
...tomorrow, I'm going to buy
a television.

460
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,170
Where is that television?
Where's the bloody thing? Damn it!

461
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,809
Please, Vicky, let's talk this over.
- Talk, my foot!

462
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,443
We wanted to surprise you.
- I call it deceit.

463
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,041
Out of this house!

464
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,409
Bloody hell, open this door!

465
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,529
Shut your trap!

466
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,961
I'm going to do you
a mischief!

467
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:54,242
Where are you going?
- I'm leaving. It stinks here.

468
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,608
Move over a bit.
You're in the way.

469
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,810
Victor, Victor.

470
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,484
Please, Victor, please.
-Give him a coat.

471
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,050
Victor, please, please, I beg you!

472
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,481
Too late!
Give him his coat, I said!

473
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,923
You're not really going
to throw me out, are you?

474
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,521
Oh no? What kind of a mug
do you think I am?

475
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,404
Give your mother a kiss.

476
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,965
Stop there.

477
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,607
Where?
- There.

478
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,727
What would he be doing
in a lunchroom?

479
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,685
Stop!

480
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,608
Where are you going?

481
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,611
Let's make a date.

482
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,049
What are you doing?
- Can't I look for him?

483
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,402
Can I take your arm?
- Why?

484
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,648
Well, all the men around here.

485
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,761
I can't see any men.
-No, but they can see us.

486
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,043
Now they'll think I'm with you.

487
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,082
It was your first time?

488
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,682
It was your first time.

489
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,330
It doesn't matter.
You're just a late developer.

490
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,769
Next, please.
- A dozen oysters.

491
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,123
I was before you!
- You just came in.

492
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,483
Where do you get that idea?
- These people are witnesses.

493
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,205
Are you ladies sorting it out?

494
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,210
There's not much to sort out.
She was first, and that's that.

495
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,483
But I've been standing here for ages.
- It's her turn.

496
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,523
Twenty oysters.

497
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,645
Where is Abel?

498
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,610
Sis?

499
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,770
Sisie? It's me!

500
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,686
The postman.

501
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,530
Yoohoo! Sweet Sisie.

502
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,242
Let me in then.

503
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,160
I've got a parcel for you.

504
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,490
A long parcel.

505
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,890
What are you doing here?

506
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:18,642
I wanted to surprise you.
Who have you got indoors?

507
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,805
No-one.

508
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,488
Victor, we've got to cool it a bit.

509
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,089
Is there someone else?

510
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,201
Yes.

511
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,002
Don't you want to see me anymore?

512
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,770
Sis...

513
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,400
No.

514
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,680
I've got to go now.
-We must talk.

515
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,891
No!

516
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,769
And you're not to come
and watch me anymore.

517
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:07,170
Sis, please! Is it all over
just like that?

518
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,046
That's the way it goes.

519
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,804
Abel.

520
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:41,485
Hello!
I'm Nick, the walking flannel.

521
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,489
I'm searching for the bald mountain.

522
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,691
Oh look, there it is!
Goodness, isn't it bald.

523
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,848
What are you going to do
on that bald mountain?

524
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,249
There's a lot to see from the top
of the bald mountain.

525
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,408
Oh, it's so high.

526
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,644
And it's very cold as well.

527
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,891
Freezing cold.
-What can you see?

528
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,807
Nothing. It's all much
too far away.

529
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,650
Can't you see a girl?

530
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:20,045
A girl? Yes, I have to look
very carefully, though.

531
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,530
Yes, in the distance
I can see very vaguely a girl.

532
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,370
And what's that girl doing?

533
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:33,082
What a nuisance,
I can't see from here.

534
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,727
But you could walk over to that girl?
-I can't.

535
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,526
Why not?
-I've only got very tiny legs.

536
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,883
It would take me a whole year
to reach that girl.

537
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,245
What now?
-Yes, what now...

538
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,609
Let's just think.

539
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,370
Well, I know.
I need some binoculars.

540
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,369
Are you going to spy on that girl?

541
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,891
Abel?

542
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,011
Girls like to be spied on.

543
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,567
I know where Abel is.

544
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,364
With a woman.

545
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,564
I said so, didn't I?

546
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,648
Why don't you ask me anything?

547
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,161
What I do for a living,
for instance.

548
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,608
What do you do for a living?

549
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:23,723
I'm a teacher. I'm a model.

550
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,647
I work at Naked Girls.

551
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,848
Teacher?
- No.

552
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,088
Model?
- No.

553
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,601
Naked Girls.
- Yes.

554
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,848
Naked Girls.

555
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,842
Is that a home?

556
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,481
A home? For what?

557
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,887
A home for naked girls.

558
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:53,684
At Naked Girls men look
at naked girls.

559
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:59,211
Really? Only men?
- Yes, and boys.

560
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,121
Aren't you going to ask:
"How did you find him?"

561
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,209
How did you find him?

562
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:14,530
I saw a woman in the fishmongers
wearing Abel's pullover.

563
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:19,009
The one with the fish, you know.
I followed her.

564
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,521
There's more than one fish-pullover
in the world.

565
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:25,202
I sniffed it. The pullover.

566
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,206
And what did you smell?
- Abel.

567
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,962
Is he living with this woman?

568
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,129
I think so.

569
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,849
There was a postman at the door
this afternoon.

570
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,247
I had something with him.

571
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,764
Was that nice?

572
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,446
Sometimes.

573
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,969
Was he a married man?
- Yes.

574
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,649
Did he have any children?

575
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,562
Yes, a son I think. But he never
wanted to talk about him.

576
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:17,364
I know that son. That son is me.

577
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,330
Well, I can tell you a few nice
things about your father.

578
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,966
I don't want to hear about my father!

579
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,370
From now on, my father
doesn't exist any more!

580
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,850
And your mother?

581
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,090
Tomorrow I'm going to go
and fetch Abel.

582
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,090
You leave him alone.
That wretched boy!

583
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,965
I'm not going to take
any more notice of you.

584
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,730
Abel's coming back home.

585
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,969
Over my dead body!
- Over your dead body then.

586
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,682
It's him, or me!

587
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,922
What cold hands.

588
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:08,080
And so dry.
You are alright, aren't you?

589
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,966
Why shouldn't I be alright?
-I don't know. I'm worried about you.

590
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,242
You always used to have
such damp, warm hands.

591
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,125
And now they're suddenly
cold and dry.

592
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,687
I don't think you're looking well.

593
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,281
But Sis says I'm looking fine.

594
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,565
You look unhealthy. And you're
wearing an atrocious shirt.

595
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:40,487
Abel, shall we make it
a bit cosier here?

596
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:21,971
Sis, come on! Let's go
and have a drink somewhere.

597
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,244
Sis, please.

598
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,561
Get in, Sis.

599
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,047
Just a moment.

600
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,251
What d'you think you're doing,
rearranging my furniture?

601
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,442
It was her idea.

602
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,561
This is my mother.
-We've already met.

603
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,488
And you just let it happen?
You just kept about your mouth shut!?

604
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:19,921
Where are the flowers?

605
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,166
She threw them away.
- They were dried out.

606
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,002
That's because
they're <i>dried</i> flowers.

607
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,809
"Two housing complexes
in eight years."

608
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,401
Is that what you mean, de Beer?
-That's what I mean, yes.

609
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:16,480
Is that just a statement
or are you sliding mud?

610
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:20,401
I rather think I'm sliding mud.

611
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:24,645
And it all went too slowly for you, eh?

612
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:30,601
Haste! You'll be catching up
with your own backside!

613
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:28,209
Now get lost! Clear off!

614
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,484
Mind how you speak
to my wife, girlie.

615
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:35,446
I'm used to talking
these things through.

616
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:38,928
Yes, that's true. We always talk
everything through.

617
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,283
Victor's been having an affair
with Sis.

618
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,961
With a beautiful, young,
fertile woman.

619
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,202
Is that true?
- Yes, it's true.

620
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:12,007
Is that true?
- Yes, ask Sis.

621
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,203
I hate you!

622
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:18,444
I don't hate you, you know.
You're a good woman.

623
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,250
But you've got to keep
your mitts off Abel.

624
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:23,566
I'm warning you.

625
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,685
But Dove, you're getting wrinkles,
you're not fertile anymore...

626
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:32,886
You can talk! Disgusting,
disgusting old man!

627
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:36,243
No, that's not true. Women
grow ugly as they get older...

628
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:40,126
...but men... they get more interesting.

629
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,601
Anything to drink, Sisie?
A good glass of wine?

630
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:45,847
Shut up!

631
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,644
Haven't you got a bottle somewhere?

632
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:31,368
Out! Both of you!

633
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:48,490
Right, I'm going-

634
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:54,282
I'm going. I'm going!

635
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,323
Don't do it, Dove.

636
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,761
Come on, Dove.
-Don't come any closer!

637
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:10,607
I'll jump.

638
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,685
Where's Dove?

639
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,970
Dovie? Where are you?

640
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:26,451
Oh, Dove. Do you want
a drink as well?

641
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,008
Not one step closer.

642
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:34,687
Don't come one step closer,
d'you hear?

643
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,809
Oh my God!

644
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,651
Victor, please, let's go.

645
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,169
Victor, come on.

646
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,808
Just one more little drinkie.
-Shut up!

647
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:04,130
I thought it was a very pleasant
evening. Next time, our place?
