00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,138
<i>This is my favorite room.</i>

3
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,400
<i>Most days I love it,</i>

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,650
<i>because I can imagine the glass
falling away and I'm outside.</i>

5
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,789
<i>I don't leave my house.</i>

6
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,372
<i>I haven't left my house in 17 years.</i>

7
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,337
<i>If I went outside, I'd die.</i>

8
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,884
<i>Sorry to sound morose.</i>

9
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,432
<i>Irradiators sterilize my clothes.</i>

10
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,723
<i>I own 100 white T-shirts.</i>

11
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,225
<i>It's my standard uniform.</i>

12
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,438
<i>The airlock is a sealed room
surrounding the front door.</i>

13
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,895
<i>It's airtight.</i>

14
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,901
<i>Nothing can leak into
the house when the door's open.</i>

15
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,026
<i>It's not that I don't want to go outside.</i>

16
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,234
<i>I can't.</i>

17
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:35,493
<i>Simple viruses can kill me.
It's like I'm allergic to everything.</i>

18
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:39,418
<i>What I eat, what I touch,
they all have consequences.</i>

19
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,746
<i>I have severe combined immunodeficiency.</i>

20
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,172
<i>My immune system sucks.</i>

21
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,758
<i>Here's a drawing to explain.</i>

22
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,091
<i>In every drop of blood there are
special cells called lymphocytes.</i>

23
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,296
Hello.

24
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,850
<i>Some of these lymphocytes
are really good at fighting bad guys,</i>

25
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,269
<i>like viruses and bacteria.</i>

26
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,937
<i>But I have SCID,</i>

27
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,217
<i>which means I have way fewer
lymphocytes than normal.</i>

28
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,700
Uh-Oh.

29
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,146
<i>And the ones that I do have,</i>

30
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,400
<i>well, they're not so good at fighting.</i>

31
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,742
<i>My mom made me join a support group.</i>

32
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,946
<i>Some of them are really sick.</i>

33
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,781
<i>Others have a hard time
with social interactions.</i>

34
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,651
<i>At least I have the Internet.</i>

35
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,581
<i>I exercise.</i>

36
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,336
<i>I read a lot of books.</i>

37
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,793
<i>When I'm done, I write short reviews.</i>

38
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,015
<i>I take an architecture class online.</i>

39
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,520
<i>Whenever I make a new model,
I put an astronaut inside.</i>

40
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,610
<i>I can relate to him.</i>

41
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,368
<i>I feel like an astronaut,
stranded in space.</i>

42
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,164
<i>Every day feels exactly the same.</i>

43
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,430
<i>Maybe today's different.</i>

44
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,502
Get off the truck, Olly.

45
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,992
Hi.

46
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,899
<i>If you're going to have an illness</i>

47
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,394
<i>that requires someone to constantly
watch if you're still breathing,</i>

48
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,896
<i>it's convenient for
your mother to be a doctor.</i>

49
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,113
<i>I was diagnosed with SCID pretty early.</i>

50
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,535
<i>My mom figured out what was wrong
with me after eight ear infections</i>

51
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,902
<i>and two cases of pneumonia.</i>

52
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,549
<i>I couldn't gain any weight as a baby.</i>

53
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,832
<i>Most kids don't make it
past two years old.</i>

54
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,035
Doctor Whittier.

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,547
<i>Today's my birthday.</i>

56
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,296
<i>I'm 18.</i>

57
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,136
<i>Which means nothing inside here.</i>

58
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,110
<i>This is the face
her patients normally see,</i>

59
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,903
<i>slightly distant, concerned.</i>

60
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,736
<i>I wonder if they find it comforting.</i>

61
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,318
<i>I do.</i>

62
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,490
You didn't have to take the day off.

63
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,789
I always take the day off.

64
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,866
What do you want to do today?

65
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,452
Same thing we always do.

66
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,764
Spatlit...

67
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,682
What does that say?

68
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,102
- Spotlight.
- No, it doesn't.

69
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,863
<i>You're not good
at phonetic Scrabble.</i>

70
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,685
<i>Because it
doesn't make any sense.</i>

71
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,607
You're the one who always wants to play.

72
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,980
It was your dad's favorite game.

73
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,979
Did he beat you, too?

74
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,358
Yeah.

75
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,406
But he let me win sometimes.

76
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,655
<i>- I can't do that.
- Why not?</i>

77
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,486
<i>I'm in love with you.</i>

78
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,328
<i>Snap out of it!</i>

79
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,610
<i>I can't.</i>

80
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,952
I'll get it.

81
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,787
Stay here.

82
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,309
<i>And you
won't come to the wedding.</i>

83
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,518
<i>I'll come to the wedding.</i>

84
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,510
<i>I am telling you, you can't come.</i>

85
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,526
Hi.

86
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,826
Um, my mom sent a Bundt.
It's not very good.

87
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,705
It's kind of a thing our mom does
every time we move in somewhere.

88
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,750
She'll make us bring one
to the neighbor, so...

89
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,876
It's actually more of, uh, an apology
than an introduction.

90
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,549
What's she apologizing for?

91
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,596
For moving in.

92
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,808
Oh, that's nice.

93
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,806
Actually, I can't accept that.

94
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,057
Why not?

95
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,983
It's complicated.

96
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,653
But please thank your mother for me,

97
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,447
and welcome to the neighborhood.

98
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,616
Is your daughter around?

99
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,287
<i>So, that's why you came.</i>

100
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,466
- That's not why I came.
<i>- Yeah, it is. Yep.</i>

101
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,867
No, she isn't.

102
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,715
You take the Bundt next time.

103
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,592
<i>Oh, right. Wear it as a hat.</i>

104
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,638
Watch it.

105
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,944
<i>Madeline, do you want
to finish the movie?</i>

106
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,733
I'd rather know
what a Bundt cake tastes like.

107
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,158
<i>It's dry.</i>

108
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,782
<i>You're not missing out on anything.</i>

109
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,077
No, just everything.

110
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,916
<i>There's a short list of people
that know I'm alive.</i>

111
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:44,172
<i>My mom, my nurse, Carla,
and her daughter, Rosa.</i>

112
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,676
<i>I can't remember Carla not being with us.</i>

113
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,846
<i>She's been working here for 15 years.</i>

114
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,976
<i>Sometimes, I think she's trapped
inside here with me.</i>

115
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,902
- Morning, Carla.
- Mmm-hmm.

116
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,832
<i>Feliz cumpleaños.</i>

117
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,966
Thank you!

118
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,086
Thank you so much.

119
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,930
Ooh, <i>una nota.</i>

120
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,499
That's terrible.

121
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,279
Hi, Olly.

122
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,706
Hi, Maddy.

123
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,175
<i>I tell myself I won't text back
immediately when Olly texts me.</i>

124
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,392
<i>And then I text back. Immediately.</i>

125
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,237
Are you on house arrest?

126
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,581
Why do you think I'm on house arrest?

127
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,709
'Cause I haven't seen you outside once
since we got here.

128
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,734
Um...

129
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,119
I'm not on house arrest,
but I can't leave the house.

130
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,572
Very mysterious.

131
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,327
Are you a ghost?

132
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,385
'Cause, it would just my luck that
the girl next door is not actually alive.

133
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,037
I'm, like,
98% sure that I'm alive.

134
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,246
Hmm.

135
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,293
So, what is it? Is it a guy?
Are you knocked up?

136
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,259
Oh, my God. Well, what if I was?

137
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,204
I'd be conflicted.

138
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,429
About what?

139
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,423
Do you have a boyfriend?

140
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,726
No. I don't have a boyfriend,
and I'm not pregnant.

141
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,020
Have you spent all day
thinking that I was pregnant?

142
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,267
Yeah, kind of.

143
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,200
I mean, it would have been awkward
flirting with a pregnant girl, so...

144
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,443
Right.

145
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,781
Don't you wanna know
if I have a girlfriend?

146
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,069
No.

147
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,318
I'm hurt.

148
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,277
I mean, that stings.

149
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,976
So, where'd you move here from?

150
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,948
Boston, but I'm from New York.

151
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,624
<i>I wanna move back.</i>

152
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,171
I always imagined myself
working in a bakery in New York.

153
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,000
You know, like Nicolas Cage
in that movie, <i>Moonstruck?</i>

154
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,255
No.

155
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,543
"Snap out of it!"

156
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,424
It's from the movie.

157
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,596
Yeah, I figured.

158
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,188
All right, here's a game.
Fast Five Favorites.

159
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,435
- Okay?
- Okay.

160
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,189
So, book, word, color, vice, person.

161
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,149
Um... Okay. All right. Um...

162
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,438
<i>So, I guess...</i>

163
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,208
Come on. Type faster.
Don't think about it.

164
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,155
Okay. All right.
<i>The Little Prince.</i>

165
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,656
- Uxorious.
- Ooh.

166
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,612
- Aquamarine.
- Hmm.

167
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,078
I don't have any vices.

168
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,659
And my mom.

169
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,106
Oh, come on. Everyone has vices.

170
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,336
How many vices do you have?

171
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,667
Enough to choose a favorite.

172
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,503
- Your turn.
- All right.

173
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,501
<i>- Lord of the Flies.</i>
- Uh-huh.

174
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,460
- Macabre.
- Okay.

175
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,670
Black.

176
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,505
Uh, petty theft.

177
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,925
And my sister.

178
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,638
<i>Lord of the Flies?</i>

179
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,641
So, you're bleak.

180
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,057
I've been told that I have
a poor outlook on life.

181
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,474
<i>Right.</i>

182
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,194
Are your parents still together?

183
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,280
Um, my dad's dead,

184
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,857
so, no.

185
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,277
Oh.

186
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,534
Whoa, that was really awkward.
I don't know why I made that so...

187
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,866
- I shouldn't have asked.
- No, it's, um...

188
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,252
He died in a car accident
with my brother.

189
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,416
I'm sorry.

190
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,888
You don't go to SF Valley High?

191
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,673
No, I don't go to school.

192
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,725
I go online.

193
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,635
Why?

194
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,888
I'm sick.

195
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,685
Oh, are you dying?

196
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,683
Not right now.

197
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,693
Soon?

198
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,148
If I left the house, yeah, probably.

199
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,402
What is it?

200
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,114
It's called severe combined
immunodeficiency.

201
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,073
So, it means my body can't fight
bacteria or infections.

202
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,577
Is there a cure?

203
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,125
For common kinds of SCID, yeah.

204
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,079
But I am very uncommon.

205
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,915
You're feeling sorry for me.

206
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,799
You're totally feeling sorry for me.

207
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,297
No, no, no. I, um...

208
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,622
Yeah.

209
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,008
I'm not feeling sorry for you.

210
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,760
- Uh-huh.
- You're alive now.

211
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,283
- You have the Internet.
- Mmm-hmm.

212
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,306
So, I don't feel sorry for you.

213
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,186
Good.

214
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,110
<i>I wish I could meet you in person.</i>

215
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,362
Yeah. Me, too.

216
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,951
Wait, come to the window.

217
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,231
What's so interesting on that laptop?

218
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,778
Um, nothing.

219
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,900
<i>It's not nothing.</i>

220
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,441
Something's making you laugh.

221
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,576
It's just cat videos.

222
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,889
You don't wanna see this one, Carla.

223
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,253
The cat dies.

224
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,251
You're an idiot.

225
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,635
I'm not an idiot.

226
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,806
You are an idiot,
and you're not a good liar.

227
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,220
You mean to tell me that the only thing
you could think to say

228
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,896
was that it was a dead cat?

229
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,233
So, you know?

230
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,729
If I didn't know before, I do now.

231
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,900
You're not very good at hiding things.

232
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,627
I see you checking your email
and looking for him out the window.

233
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,698
Maybe he could visit?

234
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,534
<i>Huh.</i>

235
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,916
Teenagers are all the same.

236
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,706
Is that a no?

237
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,313
He'd get decontaminated,
and it would just be for a half hour.

238
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,502
Are you crazy?

239
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,963
Wouldn't you be if you'd been inside
for 18 years?

240
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,298
No.

241
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,768
He'd get decontaminated, and then
he'd sit across the room from me,

242
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,060
like, far, far away.

243
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,062
We can't always get what we want.

244
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,936
<i>Your mother would never let you.</i>

245
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,571
We don't have to tell her.

246
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,776
Is it that easy to lie?

247
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,535
You know, it's easier than I thought.

248
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,570
Huh.

249
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,752
You know what, I'm gonna go home
and look on Rosa's Internet history.

250
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,060
<i>Rosa's the only other person
allowed inside,</i>

251
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,382
<i>but she's leaving for Michigan
in the fall.</i>

252
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,305
<i>She'll meet new people,
and I'll still be here.</i>

253
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:16,974
What does he look like?

254
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,384
Rosa.

255
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,635
What?

256
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,350
Okay, I guess he's cute.

257
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,308
I don't believe you.

258
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,527
Yeah, maybe he is a figment
of my imagination.

259
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:32,903
Just like a really good-looking mirage.

260
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,778
Things are finally getting
interesting for you.

261
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:37,987
And I'm leaving.

262
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,326
What are you guys talking about?

263
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,579
Nothing.

264
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,168
Come on, Rosa,
it's time for us to go home.

265
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,991
<i>Connected
to Oliver Bright's iPhone.</i>

266
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,816
I'm right here.

267
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,360
That was way too easy.

268
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,090
Hey, what you looking at?

269
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,471
Nothing.

270
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,634
Is that a new sweater?

271
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:06,890
Yeah.

272
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,980
Carla irradiated it.

273
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,352
And where'd you get it?

274
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,809
From Rosa.

275
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,062
Mmm, it's nice. You look pretty.

276
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,407
<i>You listen to me.</i>

277
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,960
You stay on your side of the room,

278
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,161
he stay on his.

279
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,210
<i>I already told him the same thing.</i>

280
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,017
What are you talking about?

281
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,880
You stay on your side,

282
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,007
<i>he stays on his.</i>

283
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,513
He's here.

284
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,765
Who's here?

285
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,842
Olly.

286
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,687
Nod if you understand.

287
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,860
I'm worried you're losing
your motor skills.

288
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,816
Why?

289
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,160
Because I'm terrible at saying no.

290
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,998
<i>Because you deserve a little something.</i>

291
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,939
Is that what you're gonna wear?

292
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,838
You just gonna stay over there?

293
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,279
Carla said that I had to stay
as far away from you as possible.

294
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:42,815
Cool.

295
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,202
You're standing really still.

296
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,034
Maybe you should come in.

297
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,078
Yeah. Yeah.

298
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,912
I could do that.

299
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,773
You're really different
than I thought you were gonna be.

300
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,699
I know.

301
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,860
Sexier, right?

302
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,173
I understand, you're nervous.
It's all right, you can admit it.

303
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,289
I am nervous.

304
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,834
All right. Well, so am I.

305
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,001
I like this room.

306
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,748
Yeah.

307
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:47,305
Um, my mom built it
so that I could feel like I was outside.

308
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,090
Does it work?

309
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,845
Most days.

310
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,052
I have a really excellent imagination.

311
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,813
Princess Madeline in her glass castle.

312
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,689
I'm not a princess.

313
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,566
Good.

314
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,110
Because I'm not a prince.

315
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,492
<i>So, uh, how long have you been sick?</i>

316
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,651
My whole life.

317
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,705
I mean, what would happen
if you went outside?

318
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,954
Probably spontaneous combustion.

319
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,534
We'll stay inside.

320
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,183
Yeah, that's a good idea.

321
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,547
Have you ever left this house?

322
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,545
Uh, no.

323
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,511
Where would you go?

324
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,505
If you could.

325
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,340
The ocean.

326
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,180
The ocean? Why?

327
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:37,138
Well, it covers 72% of the planet.

328
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,520
And it's approximately 3 miles from here.

329
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,355
And I've never seen it.

330
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,361
It's a bad choice.

331
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,687
Why?

332
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,189
I'm assuming you can't swim.

333
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,075
Yeah, you're right.

334
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,619
But I'd like to try.

335
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,823
I respect the ocean.

336
00:26:56,031 --> 00:27:00,127
I mean, it's beautiful.
It's impersonal, it's murderous.

337
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,213
It's Mother Nature at her finest.

338
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,965
I mean, the point of waves

339
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,214
is to suck your feet out from under you
so that you drown faster.

340
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,753
Right.

341
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,383
Didn't see that dark turn coming.

342
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,968
Yeah, well...

343
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,950
I'm really good at handstands.

344
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:33,990
Yeah?

345
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,583
What else can you do?

346
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,084
Oh, man.

347
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,875
I'm afraid that's pretty much it.

348
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,696
You didn't touch, right?

349
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,114
No.

350
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,865
No touching.

351
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,578
<i>Your face!</i>

352
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,413
What? Is it red?

353
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,166
I can see it.

354
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,636
You're completely gone
and you barely know him.

355
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,465
I thought you were on our side!

356
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,801
I'm just facilitating.

357
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,392
Do you, um, think I could see him again?

358
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,481
Hmm.

359
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,448
In a week. I wanna make sure you're okay.

360
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,862
What am I supposed to do until then?

361
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,154
Hmm.

362
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,041
When was the last time
you posted a review?

363
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:05,786
Hmm?

364
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,029
Hey, where are you?

365
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,282
<i>Skating in Venice.</i>

366
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,034
<i>Oh, Shit.</i>

367
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,873
<i>I'm sorry, Maddy.</i>

368
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,163
No, no, no. You should enjoy that.

369
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,044
For us both.

370
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,716
<i>It's boring without you.</i>

371
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,969
What makes you think
that I'd make it any better?

372
00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:00,299
<i>Well, there are no girls here,
so who am I supposed to show off to?</i>

373
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,685
So, listen, um,

374
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,934
on Tuesday, Carla has the night off,

375
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,813
and my mom's working a double shift,

376
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:14,272
so I figured maybe you'd come over.

377
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,107
And we could watch the fireworks
from the sunroom.

378
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,160
<i>Wait, Tuesday?</i>

379
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,742
<i>That's July Fourth.</i>

380
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,291
Yeah. Do you have plans or something?

381
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,954
<i>No. I'm not very popular.</i>

382
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,709
Lucky for me then, I guess.

383
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,343
So, um, I guess I'll see you then.

384
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,420
<i>All right. I will see you then, Maddy.</i>

385
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,925
Okay, bye, Olly.

386
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,556
<i>Bye.</i>

387
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,437
<i>I don't know how Carla and I
got our wires crossed.</i>

388
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,607
I don't wanna leave you alone tonight.
It's the Fourth of July.

389
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,940
You know, I'll see if someone
can cover for me.

390
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,521
You know, I'll be fine.

391
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,860
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

392
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,107
What are you gonna do?

393
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,986
I guess just read a book or something.

394
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:13,255
So, calculus is the mathematics of change.

395
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:17,255
It doesn't necessarily predict the future,
but it does indicate it.

396
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:18,840
Indicate what?

397
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,347
Well, that people are unpredictable.

398
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,143
I didn't really see you as a math person.

399
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,438
Why not?

400
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,662
I guess 'cause you're in summer school.

401
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,583
Right. Well, that's...

402
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,742
That's just 'cause my dad
moves around a lot.

403
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,801
This is an ellipsis.

404
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,906
Does that mean
that we're having an awkward silence

405
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,147
or that you're thinking?

406
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,313
Both.

407
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,024
What are you thinking about?

408
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:22,700
I'm thinking that we should
probably agree to just be friends.

409
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,825
I don't think
you have that kind of restraint.

410
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,247
Well, my life is
an exercise in restraint, so...

411
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,120
Does this mean
I can't look at your lips anymore?

412
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:35,750
No.

413
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,748
<i>Your dimple?</i>

414
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,379
I don't have dimples!

415
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,668
Your hair.

416
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:42,878
Friends!

417
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,421
Ellipsis.

418
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,890
You make me wanna stay in Los Angeles.

419
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,105
Why would you go?

420
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,072
What are you doing?

421
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,161
I'm moving closer to you.

422
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,957
Is that okay?

423
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,081
Yes, it's okay.

424
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,756
Okay.

425
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:32,306
I should tell you we shouldn't
push our luck, but I can't.

426
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,764
I don't want to.

427
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,443
Are you sure?

428
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,320
Yes.

429
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,242
Hello, Little Prince.

430
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,647
Is it always like that?

431
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:18,811
It's never like that.

432
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,008
<i>Are you sure you're not sick?
You feel fine?</i>

433
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,507
Yeah, I feel fine.

434
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:52,387
Better than fine, actually.
I feel pretty perfect.

435
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,052
<i>Even though we touched?</i>

436
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,429
We did.

437
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,514
<i>Shared the same breath.</i>

438
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,104
Yeah, we did.

439
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,859
<i>Kissed.</i>

440
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,823
Like I said, perfect.

441
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,369
Hey. goodnight.

442
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,662
<i>Goodnight.</i>

443
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,725
<i>I read once that we change</i>

444
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,368
<i>the upper layers of our skin
every two weeks.</i>

445
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,712
<i>But some of our cells don't renew.</i>

446
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,249
<i>They age, and age us.</i>

447
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,086
<i>In two weeks, my lips
will have no memory of kissing Olly.</i>

448
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,805
<i>But my brain will remember.</i>

449
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,984
<i>Yeah, that's right, walk away, Dad.</i>

450
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,048
<i>Leave it alone, Olly.</i>

451
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,309
<i>Walk away!</i>

452
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,696
<i>It's not your problem, okay?</i>

453
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,197
<i>It's not my problem?
It's not my problem.</i>

454
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,861
<i>You really just say that to me right now?</i>

455
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,016
Stay out of it!

456
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,410
- Stay out of it, huh?
- Yeah.

457
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,454
Stay out of it. How's that?
How's that for staying out of it?

458
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,105
- Really?
- Enough!

459
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,747
Madeline?

460
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,127
<i>Olly!</i>

461
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,331
- Maddy? Maddy, what are you doing?
- Are you okay?

462
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,378
Madeline?

463
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:12,708
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

464
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,857
I'm okay. What are you doing?
Go back inside! Go!

465
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,508
Madeline! Madeline!

466
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,681
What are you doing?

467
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,573
I don't understand.
Why would you do that?

468
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,441
I'm sorry.
I had to make sure that he was okay.

469
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,747
- Did you touch anything?
- No.

470
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:30,772
Did you touch anything?

471
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,527
No, no. It was less than a minute.

472
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,780
A second is all it takes.

473
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,536
I'm sorry.

474
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,786
Why would you risk your life
for a total stranger?

475
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,869
I'm okay.

476
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,625
He's not a stranger, is he?

477
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,134
We're just friends online.

478
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,514
Online...

479
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,726
How could you?

480
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,398
<i>She's right.</i>

481
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:13,607
<i>Four hours soaking in an antiseptic bath,
and I could still wake up tomorrow sick.</i>

482
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:17,445
<i>Four hours trying to remember everything
about being in the world.</i>

483
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:23,166
<i>I can't remember any of it.
Just Olly yelling at me to go inside.</i>

484
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,796
I'm sorry Olly's in that situation.

485
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,166
No one deserves a father like that.

486
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,835
I'm sorry, too.

487
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,340
Does it look like he's okay?

488
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,933
I don't know.

489
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:45,644
I could have someone talk to him
and see if he's all right.

490
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,858
I don't think he wants anyone to know.

491
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,063
He was trying to protect his morn.

492
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,947
He doesn't like to talk about everything.

493
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,866
I knew something was different with you.

494
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,876
I should've known what it was
the moment he came offering Bundt cake.

495
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,165
You could've come to me, you know.

496
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,717
I wanted to.
I just didn't want to worry you.

497
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,213
What's he like?

498
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,888
Well, he wears black,

499
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,683
all of the time.

500
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,233
But he's not as cynical as he looks.

501
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,731
He needs a haircut.

502
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,066
Yeah, he does.

503
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,028
<i>He's kind.</i>

504
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,570
We're both really sleep deprived

505
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,201
from talking instead of sleeping.

506
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,749
But I'd rather talk to him than sleep.

507
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,262
When I talk to him,

508
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,262
I feel like I'm outside.

509
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,276
He thinks

510
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:18,532
that I'm funny, smart, and beautiful.

511
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,741
In that order.

512
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,278
As he should.

513
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,702
He sounds wonderful.

514
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,283
Yeah, he is.

515
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,211
I wish you could have more than this.

516
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,793
I know.

517
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,346
I'm sorry.

518
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,180
It's not your fault.

519
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,148
Maui was your dad's favorite place.

520
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,407
<i>You were just a few months old,
before we knew why you were always sick.</i>

521
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,493
I wish I could remember them.

522
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,082
Maybe it'd be easier if I couldn't.

523
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,423
I love you, you know.

524
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,344
More than you even know.

525
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,558
You can't see him again.

526
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,184
I haven't seen him.

527
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,412
Yes, you have.

528
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,354
<i>She was so alone, she needed...</i>

529
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,218
<i>How could you
let him into this house?</i>

530
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:07,431
<i>How could you do this?</i>

531
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,885
<i>How could you invite a stranger in here?</i>

532
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,052
<i>She needed it.</i>

533
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,660
It's not up to you to decide
what she needs. I am her mother!

534
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,064
You shouldn't be her doctor, too.

535
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,732
<i>Excuse me.</i>

536
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,856
<i>Is she sick?
Did something happen?</i>

537
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,610
She went outside because of him.
Because of you!

538
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,067
And she's been lying to me for weeks.

539
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,027
You have to go.

540
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,445
<i>Please, Mom.</i>

541
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:30,780
It won't happen again.

542
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,616
No, it won't.

543
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,578
I'm sorry, Carla.

544
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,218
No.

545
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,641
I'm sorry.

546
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,894
I know this is sad for you both.

547
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,437
It is sad for me, too,

548
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,607
but it is time for Carla to leave, now.

549
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,795
Your temperature is 103.

550
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,840
We have to wait and see if it goes down.

551
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,544
If the fluids and antibiotics work.

552
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,257
I'm not.

553
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,571
Good morning, Madeline.

554
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:56,654
You may address me as Nurse Janet
or Mrs. Pritchert.

555
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,364
<i>Whichever you prefer.</i>

556
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:09,165
Words spoken to the air
tend to go unheeded.

557
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,843
Words put to paper do not.

558
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,496
I miss Carla.

559
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,502
Well, Carla almost got you killed.

560
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,083
She's my friend.

561
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,214
No, Madeline. Carla was your nurse.

562
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,671
She was supposed to keep you safe,
not endanger your life

563
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,090
by inviting strangers into the house.

564
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,642
Olly isn't a stranger.

565
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,305
He's not yours.

566
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,852
What?

567
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,148
He's not yours.

568
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,906
And maybe he's interested in you now,
but he's out there.

569
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,320
And he's gonna meet some girl
and he's gonna be her Olly.

570
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,369
You understand me?

571
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,748
If Carla was your friend,
she would have told you that.

572
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,875
Love can't kill me, Morn.

573
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,882
That's not true.

574
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,472
You were lucky this time.

575
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,792
<i>After what my mom said,
I started imagining this moment</i>

576
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,781
<i>where Olly pulls up in the driveway.</i>

577
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,745
<i>And there's this girl in the truck.</i>

578
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:06,540
<i>And the girl laughs at something he says.</i>

579
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,835
<i>And puts her hand on his shoulder.</i>

580
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,087
<i>Smiles at him the way I've smiled at him.</i>

581
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,090
<i>I feel silly.</i>

582
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,635
<i>Why would anyone set themselves up
to have a broken heart?</i>

583
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,384
<i>He's going to meet someone who isn't sick.</i>

584
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,517
<i>Someone who can leave her house.</i>

585
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,350
<i>Call him.</i>

586
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:36,237
I can't. I think my mom's right.

587
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,110
<i>Then don't be a coward.</i>

588
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,166
Pick up.

589
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,998
No.

590
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:54,463
Pick up!

591
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,124
Hi, Olly.

592
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,467
It's not true.

593
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,437
It is. What kind of future
could you have with me?

594
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,501
I'm trying to protect you.

595
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,798
Protect me? I don't want protection.
I want you.

596
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,680
Well, we can't have
everything that we want.

597
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,803
You're not mine.

598
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,472
What does that mean?

599
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,357
There's gonna be another girl,
you'll be her Olly.

600
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,810
There is no other girl.

601
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:21,908
It's not safe.
I don't really think when I'm around you.

602
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,822
Thinking is overrated.

603
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,279
This isn't going anywhere.

604
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,536
I don't wanna lose you.

605
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,742
<i>I can't even go outside.</i>

606
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,833
What are you really losing?

607
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:56,952
<i>Dear Mom,</i>

608
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,424
<i>The first thing is that I love you.</i>

609
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,376
<i>You already know that,</i>

610
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,803
<i>but I may not get
the chance to tell you again.</i>

611
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:10,429
<i>You are smart and strong
and kind and selfless.</i>

612
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,514
<i>Because of you, I've survived this long</i>

613
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,316
<i>and gotten to know
my small part of the world.</i>

614
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,521
<i>But it's not enough.</i>

615
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,787
<i>I'm not doing this just because of Olly.</i>

616
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,834
<i>Or maybe I am.</i>

617
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,048
<i>I found this new part of myself
when I met him.</i>

618
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,381
<i>And the new part doesn't know how
to stay quiet and just observe.</i>

619
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,758
<i>Do you remember when we first read</i>
The Little Prince <i>together?</i>

620
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,594
<i>I was so upset that he died in the end.</i>

621
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,472
<i>I didn't understand
how he could choose death</i>

622
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,267
<i>so that he could get back to his rose.</i>

623
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:05,070
<i>I think I understand it now.</i>

624
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,989
<i>I'm not choosing death.</i>

625
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,821
<i>It's that if I don't go,</i>

626
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:12,658
<i>I won't really know
what it's like to be alive.</i>

627
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,660
<i>I love you.</i>

628
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,242
<i>Maddy.</i>

629
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,164
Maddy, what the hell's...

630
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,338
Hey. Are you trying to kill yourself?

631
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,702
I've been doing gene therapy.

632
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,957
What are you talking about?

633
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,273
I didn't want to tell you

634
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,733
because I didn't want
to get your hopes up.

635
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,759
I mean, I don't want to get my hopes up.

636
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,387
- Gene therapy?
- I've been on a trial.

637
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,406
Remember how I said that
my type of SCID was uncommon?

638
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,431
Yeah.

639
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,441
Well, I'm very common now.

640
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,944
I can go wherever I want.

641
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,485
What, you're not sick anymore?

642
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,441
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

643
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,109
No...

644
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,664
No, I don't believe you.
Come on, let's go.

645
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,949
Have I ever lied to you?

646
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,157
No.

647
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,913
So, why would I start now?

648
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,124
Look, if you're not sick,

649
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,169
then why does it look like
you're running away?

650
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,529
Well, my morn is still worried.

651
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,852
I knew it was too good to be true.
Just go back inside, come on.

652
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,423
No, Olly, I have to know.

653
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:35,629
Know what?

654
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,764
I need to know if I'm still sick.

655
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:41,553
And the only way that
I'll know is if I'm outside.

656
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,562
Will you come with me?

657
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:45,764
Come with you where?

658
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,225
- Hawaii.
- Hawaii?

659
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:49,060
I bought plane tickets.

660
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:50,978
How?

661
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,273
Credit cards are surprisingly easy to get.

662
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,533
You're serious?

663
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,245
What's wrong with Southern California?

664
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,470
- Look, stay here, all right?
- Okay.

665
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,666
Stay here.

666
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,353
Here.

667
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,992
Okay.

668
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,335
Wait.

669
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,380
Just try not to breathe.

670
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,049
Ready?

671
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,348
Just till Friday, okay?

672
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,640
And if anybody asks,

673
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,890
you don't know where I am.

674
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,437
No, I'm fine.

675
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,360
<i>Just be good.</i>

676
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,278
And take care of Mom.

677
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,585
We're going really fast.

678
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,380
I'm going 30.

679
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,706
Is that fast?

680
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,258
No.

681
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:39,720
Can we go faster?

682
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,642
Madeline? Are you up?

683
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:23,857
<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

684
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,841
<i>All luggage should fit
in the overhead compartment</i>

685
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,468
<i>or under the seat in front of you.</i>

686
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,198
How you feeling?

687
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,192
Terrified.

688
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:07,637
You okay?

689
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,978
This is crazy.

690
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,015
Hi.

691
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,224
<i>Aloha.</i>

692
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,560
<i>Aloha.</i>

693
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:19,770
Don't die.

694
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,776
I'll try not to.

695
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:41,939
Wow.

696
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,496
Big bed.

697
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,845
I found food.

698
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,598
<i>That's very resourceful.</i>

699
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,098
- Mmm.
- I wanna go in the water.

700
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,303
Okay.

701
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,564
I wanna see a <i>humuhumunukunukuāpua'a.</i>

702
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:19,890
A what?

703
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,313
It's the Hawaiian state fish.

704
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,689
Say it.

705
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,187
You're setting me up to fail.

706
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:31,448
<i>We have a 10-57.
Any units in the vicinity, please respond.</i>

707
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,371
Where is your brother?

708
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,337
Uh...

709
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,967
Summer school.

710
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:50,011
I don't think that's true.

711
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,385
I don't know where they are.

712
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:55,517
I'm asking you for your help.

713
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,018
Where's Madeline?

714
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:58,561
I'm sorry.

715
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:49,896
Maddy?

716
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,694
You're in a swimsuit.

717
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,863
Yeah, I am.

718
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,702
It's, um...

719
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,623
It's...

720
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:04,919
Small.

721
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,170
It's small.

722
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,664
It's small.

723
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:08,874
Yeah.

724
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,397
- I'll just be out here.
- Yeah. Okay.

725
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:21,891
WOMAN; Yes!

726
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,690
This umbrella's open over here.

727
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,228
Oh, my God!

728
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:04,309
Ready? Just lie back. Lay flat. Lay flat.

729
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:29,806
Uh...

730
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,071
Together?

731
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,327
You know what? Um...

732
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,204
I'll go first. Okay?

733
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:50,911
Yeah, you go first.

734
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,039
See you at the bottom.

735
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:08,808
Whoo!

736
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:01,732
<i>Far as I can tell, she's happy.</i>

737
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,954
<i>Livin' with her Macky.</i>

738
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,748
<i>So please don't take.</i>

739
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,081
<i>My love.</i>

740
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:17,975
It's strange,
'cause I don't even remember them.

741
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:23,901
I think it's weird to miss something
that you never had.

742
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:27,075
Or, you know, don't remember having.

743
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,494
Not so weird.

744
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,918
We came here before they died.

745
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,078
And before I got sick.

746
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,507
Well, you're not sick now.

747
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:48,926
Why would you move?

748
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,256
You asked me that already.

749
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,509
<i>Yeah, but you didn't answer.</i>

750
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:59,023
My dad is not very good
at staying employed.

751
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,945
And my mom feels trapped.

752
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,703
I just don't know why
she won't leave him.

753
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,574
Well, have you asked her?

754
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:09,867
Yeah.

755
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:12,241
She doesn't talk about it anymore,

756
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,447
but she used to say that,

757
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:19,077
"You'd understand when you get older

758
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:22,630
"and when you have
your own relationships."

759
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,838
She says love makes people crazy.

760
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:27,885
Do you believe that?

761
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:29,879
Do you?

762
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:35,807
Well, I mean,
I'm here in Hawaii with you, so...

763
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,680
I guess so.

764
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:43,476
Are you saying you're in love with me?

765
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:45,153
No. I...

766
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,280
I'm just saying...

767
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:54,579
I never would have left my house

768
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,997
if it weren't for you.

769
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,829
I love you.

770
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:19,099
I...

771
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,392
I loved you before I knew you.

772
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,964
So, this is my side. This is...

773
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:49,161
I like to sleep on the left.

774
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:03,802
<i>Hey, Maddy.</i>

775
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:08,772
Maddy, are you okay?

776
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,939
Maddy, what's wrong?

777
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:15,154
Maddy, are you okay?

778
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:18,278
Whoa! Okay. All right.

779
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,192
You're burning up.

780
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,487
Maddy? Maddy?

781
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,255
Maddy, can you hear me?

782
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:33,915
Got it.

783
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,257
Coming through.

784
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:43,901
We just gotta get her to triage.

785
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,525
Let's take her to Exam 2.

786
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:08,912
Could you give us a minute?

787
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:20,090
Madeline?

788
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:21,967
Madeline?

789
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,456
<i>My heart stopped.</i>

790
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,294
<i>Then it started again.</i>

791
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,967
<i>When I woke up,</i>

792
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,511
<i>he was gone.</i>

793
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:12,813
No, no, no. Lie down.

794
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:14,815
Lie down, honey.

795
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:17,940
Lie down.

796
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,402
Am I okay?

797
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:22,778
You're going to be.

798
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:07,318
Are you okay?

799
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:08,527
Yes.

800
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,372
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm okay, Olly.

801
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,954
It's nice to be able
to talk to you again.

802
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,795
I tried to visit,
but your mom wouldn't let me.

803
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:20,464
Yeah, I'm sorry
I put you through all of that.

804
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,375
I can't do this anymore.

805
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,509
Can't do what?

806
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:27,426
No more texts.

807
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:28,882
No more e-mails.

808
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:31,142
Olly, this is just too hard.

809
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:34,762
My morn was right, life was better before.

810
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,223
Better for who?

811
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,477
Ellipses.

812
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,355
Don't do this, Maddy.

813
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,277
Ellipses.

814
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:45,903
Look, my life is better with you in it.

815
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:47,692
But mine isn't.

816
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,487
You know, I lied before.

817
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:53,368
<i>About what?</i>

818
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:55,078
I do feel sorry for you.

819
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,102
<i>Tomorrow,</i>

820
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,147
I am back at the hospital.

821
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,445
Did you find me a good babysitter?

822
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,620
Actually, I've been thinking
maybe you don't need a nurse.

823
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:35,619
You learned a tough lesson,
and I can't imagine you repeating it.

824
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:37,499
No.

825
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:39,542
Good.

826
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:47,270
<i>I wish you'd talk to me.</i>

827
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:50,322
<i>I'll never meet anyone like you, Maddy.</i>

828
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:53,527
<i>You look at the ocean
like it was meant for you.</i>

829
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:57,322
<i>You jump off cliffs
even though you can't swim.</i>

830
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:02,043
<i>You think you can find
the meaning of life in a book.</i>

831
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:05,171
<i>You don't have any vices.</i>

832
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,373
<i>You should really get some.</i>

833
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,711
<i>I'm trying not to love you.</i>

834
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,047
<i>But I'm failing.</i>

835
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,967
<i>This is my last e-mail.</i>

836
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:19,927
<i>We're moving back to New York.</i>

837
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:25,521
<i>We're leaving tonight,
when my dad's out drinking.</i>

838
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:27,105
<i>My mom wants to do it at night,</i>

839
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:29,108
<i>because she's afraid
she won't be able to do it</i>

840
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,988
<i>if he's right in front of her.</i>

841
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,570
<i>I finally told her about you.</i>

842
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:37,824
<i>She thinks you're brave.</i>

843
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:43,333
<i>Being with you made me brave.</i>

844
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,170
Hello?

845
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,332
<i>- Madeline Whittier?</i>
- Yes.

846
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:35,428
<i>Hi, this is Dr. Melissa Francis
from Maui Memorial Hospital.</i>

847
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:38,598
<i>I was your attending physician
while you were here.</i>

848
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:41,175
<i>I'm just following up
on your lab results.</i>

849
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,683
<i>Your myocarditis was caused
by a viral infection.</i>

850
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:48,566
<i>You seem to have
a very weak immune system.</i>

851
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:49,813
Well, I have SCID.

852
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:52,854
<i>SCID? Really? Why would you think that?</i>

853
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,814
I've had it since I was a baby.

854
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,020
<i>I don't know...</i>

855
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:58,651
<i>If you had that kind
of severe immunodeficiency,</i>

856
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,203
<i>you probably would have suffered
more than myocarditis.</i>

857
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,195
What's going on?

858
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:43,571
Am I sick?

859
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,201
What?

860
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:47,996
Am I sick?

861
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,952
Do you feel sick?

862
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:51,999
That's not what I mean.

863
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,963
Do you remember meeting
a Dr. Francis in Maui?

864
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:04,266
I met lots of doctors in Maui, why?

865
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:08,345
She doesn't think I have SCID.

866
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:13,105
And she got your hopes up, didn't she?

867
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:19,149
It was irresponsible of her to do that.

868
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:21,825
S.C.I.D. is so rare

869
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:23,778
and so complicated.

870
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:28,036
Not everyone understands it.
There's just too many types.

871
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:31,585
And every person reacts differently.

872
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,916
You get that, don't you?

873
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:34,751
Yeah, that's what you've always told me.

874
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:36,355
Well, you just saw it for yourself.

875
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:38,334
You were fine for a little while,

876
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,422
and then you almost died
in that emergency room.

877
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:44,432
Immune systems are very complicated.

878
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:49,057
And Dr. Francis doesn't know
your full medical history.

879
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,980
She's just looking at a tiny fraction.

880
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:55,276
She hasn't been here
the whole time like I have.

881
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,239
Where are the papers, Mom?

882
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,618
What are you talking about?

883
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,448
You have records for everything.

884
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:10,657
But you have nothing about SCID!

885
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,083
Where are the papers?

886
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:16,288
Well, they must be here,

887
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:18,674
because I keep...

888
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,299
I keep everything and I...

889
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:24,972
Did you...

890
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,429
Did you take them?

891
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,430
<i>The papers?</i>

892
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,020
Madeline?

893
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:41,864
Madeline?

894
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:52,370
<i>Madeline?</i>

895
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:54,035
Madeline?

896
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,756
Madeline, what are you doing?
Are you okay?

897
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,295
Come inside, come inside.

898
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,093
Why?

899
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:06,631
Why do I have to go inside, Mom?

900
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:09,888
Because you're sick, baby. You're sick.

901
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:11,218
No.

902
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,350
Madeline, please. Please.

903
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:14,855
I'm not going back inside.

904
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:16,056
You have to.

905
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:20,060
You're all I have left. I can't lose you.

906
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:22,063
Please.

907
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:25,153
Have I ever been sick?

908
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:29,782
Come inside.

909
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:32,868
Come inside.

910
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,033
Come inside, Madeline.

911
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,873
Madeline, don't.

912
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:39,166
Madeline, don't.

913
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:40,623
Madeline.

914
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:42,170
Madeline!

915
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,460
Madeline!

916
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,484
<i>We're not sure about the state
of your immune system.</i>

917
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:37,139
<i>We think it's possible that
it's underdeveloped, like an infant's.</i>

918
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:41,776
<i>It hasn't been exposed to common viruses
or bacterial infections.</i>

919
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,228
<i>You don't have S.C.I.D.</i>

920
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:47,281
Why did I get sick in Hawaii?

921
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:50,234
<i>Well, normal, healthy people
get sick all the time.</i>

922
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:14,634
I brought you some of your things.

923
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:24,856
I'm only taking it because
I want you to leave.

924
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:36,033
Right after your dad
and your brother died,

925
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:40,830
you got so sick.

926
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:44,079
You wouldn't breathe right.

927
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:49,093
And I took you to the emergency room,
where we had to stay for three days,

928
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:53,259
and they couldn't figure out
what was wrong with you.

929
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:58,473
They said it was probably
some kind of allergy,

930
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:02,598
and they gave me a list of things
to stay away from and...

931
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:07,569
I was...

932
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:11,240
I was so sure it was something else.

933
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:23,661
I love you, Maddy.

934
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,668
And I hope you still love me.

935
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:36,256
I'm so sorry.

936
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:11,042
<i>The universe already took
my dad and brother away from my mom.</i>

937
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:15,095
<i>She was afraid to lose me, too.</i>

938
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:18,932
<i>So she made herself
believe that I was sick.</i>

939
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:25,647
<i>I can understand how she felt. Almost.</i>

940
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,108
<i>I'm trying to.</i>

941
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,688
<i>My mother loved my father.</i>

942
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:39,281
<i>He was the love of her life.</i>

943
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:42,740
<i>And she loved my brother.</i>

944
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:46,126
<i>He was the love of her life.</i>

945
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:49,371
<i>And she loves me.</i>

946
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:52,758
<i>I am the love of her life.</i>

947
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:57,004
<i>I want to forgive her.</i>

948
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:03,143
<i>But right now, all I can think about
is everything I've missed.</i>

949
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:13,437
<i>I've been trying to find
the single moment</i>

950
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,989
<i>that set my life on its path.</i>

951
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:19,401
<i>Maybe there's a version of my life
where I'm sick.</i>

952
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,487
<i>A version where I die in Hawaii.</i>

953
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:28,206
<i>Another where my father and brother are
still alive and my mother's not broken.</i>

954
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,793
<i>There's even a version
of my life without Olly in it.</i>

955
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:42,533
Hi.

956
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:44,907
Hey.

957
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:48,448
<i>Do you ever wonder</i>

958
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:51,260
what your life would be like
if you could just change one thing?

959
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:54,625
What if changing one thing
made things worse?

960
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:56,794
What if we hadn't met?

961
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:58,709
But we did.

962
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:00,676
We did.

963
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:08,643
I'm sorry that I didn't say goodbye.

964
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:12,264
Are you sure you should be here?

965
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,688
Probably not.

966
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:24,826
What if today was the first day
that we met?

967
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:27,954
Okay.

968
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:33,918
I'm so happy to meet you.

969
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:48,475
I'm so happy to meet you, too.
