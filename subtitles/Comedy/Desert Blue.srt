1
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,891
Come on, Blue, it's easy money.

2
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:16,562
Billy said ten bucks an hour.
That's some cash.

3
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:21,699
We could make at least
100 bucks a day fixing up the motel.

4
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:30,511
Cale, do what you want.
I don't care.

5
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,780
You're not mad, are you?

6
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:37,790
I'm not mad. If you want to fix up
the motel, fine. Don't ask me for help.

7
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:42,690
- It's a lot of money.
- What do you think? Green?

8
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:44,890
Yeah, sure. Green.

9
00:01:51,673 --> 00:01:53,436
Check it out.

10
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:58,877
Eight thousand VT. Turbo.
Fifty-five horses under this bad boy.

11
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,280
- What happened to your old one?
- Traded it in. Big race this weekend.

12
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:06,751
- Plus it was old.
- You just got that last year.

13
00:02:06,855 --> 00:02:09,415
Yeah. Let me explain something.

14
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:13,327
It's old. Just trust me.

15
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:15,658
It's an old bike.
You gotta keep moving.

16
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:17,732
Keep changing.
Getting a new thing.

17
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:22,269
I don't wanna end up like Blue,
making water toys in the desert.

18
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,930
- Yeah, blah, blah.
- The water's not coming.

19
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,634
It didn't come when your father
built this place. I'm sorry.

20
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:32,770
- It's not gonna just appear now.
- Noah was stupid for building an ark?

21
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:34,815
I'm outta here.

22
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,590
Did you just
compare yourself to Noah?

23
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:56,026
DESERT BLUE

24
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:13,147
Empire Cola

25
00:03:13,254 --> 00:03:15,779
Wouldn't you rather be full of it

26
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,586
Empire Cola

27
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:20,558
The taste of desert soda

28
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:26,362
When your bad ass is on high
just get it a cold shot

29
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:31,166
Of Empire Cola today

30
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,718
Here's Baxter.

31
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,153
- Do we have to do this?
- It's not that far.

32
00:03:49,257 --> 00:03:52,784
You take 395 into Baxter.

33
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:56,057
That way you see
the giant ice cream cone and the beach.

34
00:03:56,164 --> 00:04:00,157
- We'll be home by sunset.
- Great. I'll never get to a television.

35
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:02,998
Your agent could get you
your show on tape.

36
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:05,868
It's not the same on tape.
It's all about the broadcast.

37
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:08,875
Skye, come on!
We'll only be there a minute.

38
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:11,537
It'll be fun.
We'll have a look around.

39
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:14,706
Remember. One person's interminable
stretch of highway...

40
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:17,444
Is another's road to adventure.
I know.

41
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:22,421
But going out of our way to see
a giant ice cream cone? It's crazy.

42
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:25,981
Crazy? Crazy is not to see
the giant ice cream cone.

43
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:28,028
How'd you like to tell friends
we were in Baxter?

44
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:31,326
"Did you see the giant ice cream cone??"
"No, we missed it."

45
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:33,332
That would be crazy.

46
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:20,108
Empire Cola is the proud sponsor...

47
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:24,310
of the 1998 Peaksville
All-Terrain Vehicle Invitational...

48
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,217
happening this Sunday.

49
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:29,313
If you can't get down there yourself...

50
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:33,053
KDLU will be bringing you
all the action.

51
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:35,254
Our live broadcast kicks off...

52
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:38,355
at 10:00 a.m. Sunday morning.

53
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:41,435
A portion of all ticket proceeds
will be matched by Empire Cola...

54
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:44,403
and donated to
the Children's Cancer Society.

55
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:48,100
Empire Cola.
What would you rather be full of?

56
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,905
I don't get it.
We must've missed the sign.

57
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,474
Yep, we missed it.

58
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:59,676
I wonder how long it'll take them
to find our bodies.

59
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:01,584
Probably never.

60
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,124
That's assuming they'd even look.

61
00:06:05,226 --> 00:06:07,626
You know how many bodies are buried
out here they never found?

62
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:09,629
The sherif's office told me...

63
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:13,292
if all the dead bodies in the deserts
stood up at the same time...

64
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:15,301
this place would resemble Manhattan.

65
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:18,497
I mean, without Nathan's.

66
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:23,343
Do you have to put that up?

67
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:27,581
If I don't,
and an Empire Cola rep shows up...

68
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:30,207
we lose all the freebies.

69
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:33,344
If you drink enough of it,
you may have a body like this someday.

70
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:35,718
Very funny, Dad.

71
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:37,882
I'll be across the street.

72
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:55,366
Going to the aqueduct tonight.

73
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:57,376
I'll pick you up.

74
00:07:02,884 --> 00:07:04,715
Did it come?

75
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,846
Yeah. My dad's at the clinic, so hurry.
I don't wanna get busted.

76
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:10,890
- Thanks.
- See you.

77
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,874
No threat of rain
over the weekend.

78
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:37,348
Which is good news
for you race fans.

79
00:07:37,452 --> 00:07:41,149
The 10th Annual Peaksville All-Terrain
Vehicle Invitational...

80
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:43,519
is going to go down Sunday morning.

81
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:46,616
All odds are on
Baxter's Pete Kepler...

82
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:49,093
who will be returning
to defend his title.

83
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:52,758
Will Pete be able to fend off
Telly Clems again this year?

84
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:56,234
Look, I am the owner.

85
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:59,465
I wish somebody could've
notified me earlier.

86
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:00,973
Yeah.

87
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,472
Okay, bye.

88
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:08,381
What's the matter, Billy?

89
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:13,716
The insurance company is sending out
another adjuster. He'll be here soon.

90
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:16,517
I was supposed to have
that check by now.

91
00:08:16,624 --> 00:08:18,558
Why are they coming out again?

92
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:22,789
They need to take another look around.
Take more samples, run more tests.

93
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:26,993
This reimbursement process
is really pissing me off.

94
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:11,377
How can you drink that stuff?

95
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:17,416
- It's free.
- They delivered a new truckload.

96
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:18,985
Check it out.

97
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:22,088
And these hats.
Want one?

98
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,821
Want to party
at the aqueduct tonight?

99
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:32,263
Come on!

100
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:36,302
The only party I heard about
was the one in your panties.

101
00:09:36,404 --> 00:09:38,872
There's no way there could be
a party in my panties.

102
00:09:38,973 --> 00:09:40,770
Why not?

103
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,070
Because I'm not wearing any.

104
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:49,549
Have a good day, Haley.

105
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:54,153
Watch your head.

106
00:09:55,823 --> 00:09:58,314
We'll get a report to you ASAP.

107
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:02,822
She likes you.

108
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,329
Yeah, right!

109
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:07,060
I'm serious.
I think you're in there.

110
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:08,567
Whatever.

111
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,065
Bad news.

112
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:13,299
- What?
- We're in a holding pattern.

113
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:17,366
The insurance claim hasn't been
processed. They have to run more tests.

114
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:24,950
She's gonna stay like that for a while.
I'll give you a call when I have work.

115
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:29,216
Think I can catch a ride with you into
Peaksville? I need to pick up paint.

116
00:10:29,323 --> 00:10:30,915
Yeah, sure.

117
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:37,120
So much for that job.
I was counting on that motel money.

118
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:41,827
- You can help me fix up the ocean park.
- You gonna pay me ten bucks an hour?

119
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:44,736
Fucking Ely, man!

120
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:03,857
What are you doing?
What did you just blow up?

121
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,324
A canoe.

122
00:11:06,427 --> 00:11:09,328
- It's just an old canoe.
- You can't blow up my dad's canoes.

123
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,196
They're sitting here deteriorating.
I'm speeding up the process.

124
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:16,134
They're not just sitting here.
Can't you see I'm fixing up the place?

125
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:26,209
Shit! Keeler.

126
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:28,441
You're busted.

127
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:34,518
All right, Elizabeth, let's go.

128
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:36,886
- You can't arrest me.
- Watch me. You boys see it?

129
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:39,152
- Just heard it.
- You know the drill.

130
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:44,262
- I didn't do it.
- You don't say?

131
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:46,265
Goddamn malicious.

132
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:49,063
Just takes one to spoil the whole lot.
You know that?

133
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:52,698
Think he'll make a good sheriff?

134
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:56,504
He's all right.
You'd make a better one.

135
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,135
She could've blown
her fucking arms off.

136
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:09,580
Take that stupid hat off!

137
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:12,591
You all have a good day.

138
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:20,194
I'm gonna get these new fixtures.
You wouldn't believe them.

139
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,600
You put your hands under the faucet
and the water flows.

140
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:30,109
It's like they got little eyes.
It's like magic.

141
00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:32,805
The water is always
the perfect temperature.

142
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:35,905
What if I want cold water?

143
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:38,450
Why do you gotta be so negative?

144
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:40,520
It was great.

145
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:42,885
Hey, yes indeed!

146
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,959
The world's largest ice cream cone
right out here!

147
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,960
Dessert in the desert!

148
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:50,895
Looks so real!
Be great to have a ladder.

149
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:53,398
You could dive into it
and eat it.

150
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:55,469
That's incredible. Look at that.

151
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:56,797
It's gorgeous.

152
00:12:56,904 --> 00:13:01,102
It's great. Want an ice cream?
I'll get you one.

153
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,644
Hey, nice shot.

154
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:08,177
Can I get two cones, please?

155
00:13:10,184 --> 00:13:12,584
It really looks neat.
Neat thing.

156
00:13:12,686 --> 00:13:15,814
Looks bigger than it does
in photographs. Great.

157
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:20,121
Can either of you tell me
where I can find Mr. Baxter?

158
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:22,161
He passed away.

159
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,492
- When?
- Six months ago.

160
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:31,003
Fire at the motel.
It was an accident.

161
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:33,232
- I had no idea.
- Why should you have?

162
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,901
Because I'm a professor
of cultural studies.

163
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:40,742
I have a course in pop culture
and the roadside attraction.

164
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:45,410
We talk about Mr. Baxter in my class.
The giant ice cream cone and ocean park.

165
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,647
Was even putting together a photo book.
Sort of a coffee-table book.

166
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:50,815
It'll be $1.30.

167
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:54,827
It's a shame.
I'm sorry he's gone.

168
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:57,159
- Dad!
- Go more to your left.

169
00:13:57,264 --> 00:14:00,597
- Your other left.
- The sun's in my eyes.

170
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:03,329
Go back left.

171
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:05,837
That's too big.

172
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,000
Look up. Can you give us a smile?
Okay, good.

173
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:26,116
Keeler, what is going on?

174
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:30,120
She blew up a canoe, sir.

175
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:34,600
Elizabeth Marie Jackson, is this true?
Did you blow up another canoe?

176
00:14:34,702 --> 00:14:36,169
Maybe.

177
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:41,508
Let her out. She's a kid! You're locking
up my daughter like she's a criminal!

178
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:45,807
- She made and detonated a bomb.
- A bomb?

179
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:49,076
I'm breaking the law
by not reporting this!

180
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:51,845
Exhibit A. The lighter.

181
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:54,648
She's got a couple of M-80s
up her sleeves!

182
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:58,452
M-80s? Exhibit B.
The Polaroid picture.

183
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,653
The canoe was in a million pieces.

184
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:06,825
You know, I thought you really wanted
this sherif's job in Peaksville.

185
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:10,802
It's so close.
Be a shame to lose it all...

186
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:12,873
because of a few firecrackers!

187
00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:28,853
He has to replace Keeler with someone.
Why not you?

188
00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:32,551
- Remember when we slashed his tires?
- Yeah.

189
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,424
And he couldn't respond
to that ten-car pileup?

190
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:38,157
He knows I tagged up the aqueduct.
I'm a criminal. I can't be a deputy.

191
00:15:38,265 --> 00:15:42,725
Everyone did that. We were 12! The
sherifffucked around when he was a kid.

192
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:46,104
What the heck?

193
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:52,437
Ely's out of control!

194
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:57,016
What the hell was that?

195
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:03,989
I don't know.

196
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,488
Anybody hurt?

197
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:40,492
What's that smell?

198
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:42,459
It's coming from the truck.

199
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:44,360
Fucking A!

200
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,762
You're a lucky man.

201
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:54,000
There's nothing like a close brush with
death to knock the life back into you.

202
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:56,576
My arm is hurt.

203
00:16:56,677 --> 00:16:59,145
What's that smell? What is that?

204
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:02,409
- It's dog shit.
- The secret ingredient to Empire Cola.

205
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:05,451
It's in its concentrated form.
I got it all over me.

206
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:07,611
What the hell is in it?

207
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:10,952
That's classified information.
Only a few people know.

208
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:13,925
They're not even allowed
on the same airplane.

209
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:16,019
I'm not one of them.

210
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:19,358
- How'd it happen?
- Officer?

211
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:22,958
- I saw the whole thing.
- Don't leave. I need to ask questions.

212
00:17:25,506 --> 00:17:27,269
I'm going to the car.

213
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:29,638
Aren't you just the coolest?

214
00:17:32,112 --> 00:17:34,637
Can I help you with something?

215
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,736
- She has a cell phone?
- She must be from L.A.

216
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:00,936
Shit!

217
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,976
I'm in fucking Egypt!

218
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:10,884
Seems like her biscuit
could use a little buttering.

219
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:13,418
- Excuse me!
- Not by me.

220
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,215
It's just an observation.

221
00:18:17,424 --> 00:18:19,585
Shit.

222
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:21,092
Dorks.

223
00:18:23,464 --> 00:18:25,557
- Seems like a bitch.
- You don't know her.

224
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,861
That's why I said, "seems like."

225
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:33,366
Hello. I'm nearing menopause.

226
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:38,343
Mr. Jason,
your N.C.I.C. Came out clean.

227
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:40,538
That's National Crime
Information Center.

228
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:43,115
Just checking to see
if you got any outstanding warrants.

229
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:46,209
I don't get it. You're investigating me
because I witnessed an accident?

230
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,345
I guess you'll be heading back
to San Francisco.

231
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,889
- Nice town?
- Great.

232
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:53,721
Too many cars,
but that's true everywhere.

233
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:55,294
Been there long?

234
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:57,693
No. I moved there
after my divorce.

235
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,891
My daughter still lives
with her mother in L.A.

236
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,729
L.A.P.D!

237
00:19:01,835 --> 00:19:03,564
The greatest.

238
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,230
We'll contact you
if we need any more information.

239
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,864
Sign right here.

240
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:20,150
Are you trying to get me thrown in jail
for disturbing the peace?

241
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:23,382
Jesus Christ, Dad. I thought my clothes
were gonna go out of style.

242
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,084
No fear of that.
We're gonna get something to eat.

243
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:30,926
- Can we eat somewhere else?
- Sheriff said this place was fantastic.

244
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:34,330
- What's the fun of having a body if...
- You ain't got any fuel?

245
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:36,095
Right.

246
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:37,830
Let's split.

247
00:19:43,911 --> 00:19:46,903
Say, let's go investigate.

248
00:20:04,097 --> 00:20:06,088
Must be closed.
Let's go.

249
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,998
No, come on.

250
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:13,004
It's gross.

251
00:20:13,106 --> 00:20:17,304
Driving all day. Need a little chow.
This place is cute.

252
00:20:17,411 --> 00:20:20,312
You realize we're risking our lives
eating here, don't you?

253
00:20:22,182 --> 00:20:24,207
Didn't see you come in.

254
00:20:24,318 --> 00:20:27,014
Heard you had quite a scare
on the highway.

255
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,680
Yeah, it was a close one.
Luckily nobody got hurt.

256
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,224
Could I watch your television?

257
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:34,692
I'm so sorry,
but that only plays video.

258
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:37,127
- No cable.
- No cable?

259
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:41,964
I tried to get it, but they wanted me
to pay for 45 miles of cable.

260
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:45,903
- A satellite dish would be cheaper.
- Then aliens would know where we are.

261
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:51,172
- Hey!
- Hey, Mom.

262
00:20:57,985 --> 00:21:01,011
I'm gonna have the B.L.T.
I got a hunch the bacon is good here.

263
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:03,681
- What are you gonna get?
- I'm not hungry.

264
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,594
I'll check my messages.
Excuse me.

265
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:10,891
- Do you have a phone I could use?
- There, on the wall.

266
00:21:10,998 --> 00:21:12,556
Thanks.

267
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:26,337
Your turn.

268
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,234
Oh, my God!
I'm dying for that role!

269
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:53,734
Yeah! Of course
I can come in tomorrow.

270
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,107
Attention, please.

271
00:21:56,209 --> 00:22:00,805
At 3511 hours, Stan Chambers died.
K-5.

272
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:05,216
- Who?
- The truck driver, he's dead.

273
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:08,287
My God, I thought he was okay!

274
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:13,257
Looks like it wasn't from the accident.
They think it was what was in the truck.

275
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,294
Can I call you back?

276
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:18,762
Everything's under control. The FBI
has been alerted and are on their way.

277
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:20,264
The FBI?

278
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:37,981
I'll get your bag, sir.

279
00:22:38,085 --> 00:22:40,280
- Agent Summers.
- Agent Bellows.

280
00:22:40,387 --> 00:22:42,855
- How you doin'?
- Just peachy.

281
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:46,482
The HAZMAT team
has contained the spill...

282
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:49,153
but half the town has been exposed.

283
00:22:49,262 --> 00:22:51,696
- Any word on the contents?
- Nothing yet.

284
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:55,598
A quarantine's ordered until we find out
what's brewing in that cola plant.

285
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:58,603
- This the only access into town?
- Yep.

286
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:01,970
I want a roadblock between
the town and the accident.

287
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:04,873
I want another one at the access
from the highway.

288
00:23:04,978 --> 00:23:08,209
Nobody gets in or out until
we know exactly what we're dealing with.

289
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:12,342
Do not answer questions.
You know nothing. Now get on it.

290
00:23:12,452 --> 00:23:16,149
Howdy, I'm Sheriff Jackson.
Welcome to Baxter.

291
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:18,747
Anything you need,
just let us know.

292
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:21,953
Cooperation from you and your people
and the town. That'll do.

293
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:25,520
You got it. You can count on it.
This is Detective...

294
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:27,327
Where's my car?

295
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:29,868
Not the friendliest man.

296
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,370
Just doing his job.
I'm sure he's fine.

297
00:23:32,472 --> 00:23:34,963
- I'm Keeler.
- Agent Summers. How you doing?

298
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:37,236
I'm coordinating the investigation
with the EPA.

299
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:40,871
- I'd like to go over a few things.
- Lead the way.

300
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:48,914
How long till they know
what killed him?

301
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:51,490
At least 24 hours.
Maybe longer. 48 even.

302
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:54,685
Looks like you're
gonna be staying a while.

303
00:23:54,795 --> 00:23:56,695
- Welcome to Baxter.
- Thank you.

304
00:23:56,797 --> 00:23:59,197
Is there a place
we can stay in town?

305
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:05,064
- There was, but it closed down.
- Dad, we can't stay here.

306
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:08,573
I have a huge audition tomorrow.
I can't miss this.

307
00:24:10,277 --> 00:24:13,542
We don't have any choice.

308
00:24:13,647 --> 00:24:17,743
- There's plenty of room at my place.
- Houseguests!

309
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,015
Come on, Skye.

310
00:24:22,122 --> 00:24:25,922
Come on. Don't worry.
The house isn't haunted.

311
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:42,174
We have confirmation
that FBI agents...

312
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:44,971
have been sent into Baxter
to evaluate the situation.

313
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:46,978
The Environmental
Protection Agency...

314
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,105
was also called to the scene.

315
00:24:49,216 --> 00:24:52,777
We still have no word
on the exact contents of the tanker.

316
00:24:52,886 --> 00:24:55,582
Eye witnesses have said
the truck was on its way...

317
00:24:55,689 --> 00:25:00,058
to the Empire Cola plant
just outside of Baxter.

318
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,493
A quarantine is still in effect
for the area.

319
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,233
No! They're not letting us leave.

320
00:25:10,337 --> 00:25:13,465
Our hearts are with everybody in Baxter
and our fingers are crossed.

321
00:25:13,573 --> 00:25:16,064
We hope the worst has passed.

322
00:25:16,176 --> 00:25:18,736
Somebody has to do something.

323
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:22,073
You're my agent! Can't...

324
00:25:22,182 --> 00:25:24,116
Can't you call the FBI
and tell them who I am?

325
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:27,778
- She's talking to her agent.
- Big whoopie.

326
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:31,517
Maybe Bobby can patch in my publicist.
Maybe we can make this work for us.

327
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:34,958
Come on, guys, really,
do you think we're contaminated?

328
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:37,120
I don't know what
it's supposed to feel like.

329
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,597
It's not like we were covered
in that shit like the driver.

330
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,463
We inhaled it.

331
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:46,335
- What will they do to us?
- They won't do anything to us.

332
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:49,670
As long as they don't
give me a shot, I'm okay.

333
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:52,973
It's just a vitamin booster.
Strengthens the immune system.

334
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,376
It won't hurt.

335
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:01,349
Is that a fresh needle?

336
00:26:01,454 --> 00:26:04,890
They found that one in the trunk
of a drug addict's car.

337
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,094
Nice mask.

338
00:26:16,603 --> 00:26:18,867
My uncle used it in Desert Storm.

339
00:26:23,143 --> 00:26:24,804
We need everyone...

340
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:27,436
to boil their water
before consuming it.

341
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:30,482
Just a safety precaution.

342
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:37,654
Can't believe they gave us
Snoopy Band-Aids.

343
00:26:37,757 --> 00:26:41,249
Think that's supposed
to cheer us up?

344
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:44,819
- I can't even leave the town.
- At least they didn't evacuate us.

345
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:49,095
That'd mean we're okay.
They didn't evacuate us.

346
00:26:49,202 --> 00:26:51,898
They quarantined us.
Probably because they don't want us...

347
00:26:52,005 --> 00:26:54,166
to infect the rest of the county
with the biological agent.

348
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:58,233
- They never said it was biological.
- They didn't say it wasn't.

349
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:00,836
We're like guinea pigs.

350
00:27:00,947 --> 00:27:05,043
They want to sit back and watch us.
They'll study us for years.

351
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:08,678
Dissecting our insides and putting us
in those jars of formaldehyde.

352
00:27:08,788 --> 00:27:11,518
- When did you last want to leave town?
- Not the point.

353
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:15,959
- What is the point?
- That nobody ever said I couldn't.

354
00:27:16,062 --> 00:27:20,123
As soon as somebody tells you you can't,
you want to. It's as simple as that.

355
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:23,293
There's nothing anybody can do until
they find out what killed that man.

356
00:27:23,403 --> 00:27:25,735
So you might as well stop
your complaining...

357
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,898
and be grateful you're alive.

358
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:33,038
Want something to drink?

359
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:36,138
- Yes, please. Thanks.
- Tea, coffee, whiskey?

360
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:39,309
Tea. But boil the water first.

361
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,819
They're saying don't consume water
without boiling it.

362
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:44,389
It's tea.
I have to boil the water.

363
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:46,391
I know. I was just kidding.

364
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:50,259
It's not funny.
Come on, Billy. Let's go.

365
00:27:50,363 --> 00:27:51,830
She's upset.

366
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:53,592
Don't worry.

367
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,931
- So, where's your daughter?
- She stayed at your house.

368
00:27:57,037 --> 00:27:58,937
Planning her future.

369
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:26,756
Here. Hurry up. Take this.
I don't want to get busted.

370
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:31,701
See you at the aqueduct.

371
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:33,773
I'll meet you up there.

372
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:00,532
Holy shit!

373
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:02,624
You scared me.

374
00:29:04,237 --> 00:29:06,228
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

375
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:10,002
- Lulu?
- You know Lulu?

376
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,171
Yeah. That song is from that movie,
To Sir With Love.

377
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,510
You know To Sir With Love?

378
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:22,054
We have a bunch of videos.
50 karate movies. The Star Wars Trilogy.

379
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:25,420
And we have To Sir With Love.

380
00:29:25,525 --> 00:29:28,460
I love Lulu.

381
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:32,520
I would definitely play her
if they ever made a remake of that film.

382
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:35,294
- You act?
- Yeah.

383
00:29:35,402 --> 00:29:37,802
That's cool.
Would I know you from anything?

384
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:40,031
I play Maggie on Maggie's World.

385
00:29:41,808 --> 00:29:44,868
Oh, right. You don't have cable.

386
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:47,378
- If we had cable, would I know you?
- Probably.

387
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,778
- I was nominated for a Golden Globe.
- Golden Gloves?

388
00:29:49,883 --> 00:29:52,181
Wow! That's great.

389
00:29:52,285 --> 00:29:54,947
So you box, too?

390
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:57,284
It's globe.

391
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:02,089
It's an award given by
the foreign press.

392
00:30:02,195 --> 00:30:04,163
That's cool.

393
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:07,392
- I've never met anyone from TV before.
- So what do you think?

394
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:12,431
- We're all poisoned?
- I don't know. I feel okay.

395
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:15,007
I think it's just procedure.

396
00:30:15,108 --> 00:30:17,372
And their procedure's
screwing up my life.

397
00:30:17,477 --> 00:30:21,072
- Yeah?
- Yes, I have an audition of a lifetime.

398
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:23,411
With Sterling Brock.

399
00:30:23,516 --> 00:30:27,145
He did Going Nowhere Fast
and Oil Slick.

400
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:30,586
Anyway. I'm gonna miss
meeting with him tomorrow.

401
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:35,457
- Can't you reschedule?
- No. He wants to meet me tomorrow.

402
00:30:35,562 --> 00:30:37,996
But if he wants to meet you,
then he'll meet you when you get back.

403
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:40,759
You don't understand.

404
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:46,099
So, what are you doing?
You boy cotting your dad?

405
00:30:46,206 --> 00:30:48,606
He always takes us
on these little trips.

406
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:51,142
This year he takes me on this...

407
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:53,439
Americana road trip.

408
00:30:53,546 --> 00:30:55,480
Roadside attractions.

409
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:58,983
He insists on stopping at
every no-name little shit town along...

410
00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:05,115
- Fuck. I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

411
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:07,455
Nobody ever comes to Baxter
for anything.

412
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,425
It's your home.

413
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:10,894
It sure is.

414
00:31:10,997 --> 00:31:14,865
My dad wants to stop and see
the Jolly Green Giant statue next.

415
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:16,663
Oh, traitor!

416
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:30,647
You weren't joking.
You've got lots of albums.

417
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,277
Yeah. My dad was a big music lover.

418
00:31:34,387 --> 00:31:36,287
But he hated television.

419
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:41,554
He always said that music doesn't force
itself on you the way television does.

420
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:43,595
Your mind is free to grow
and wander through...

421
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:46,859
whereas TV just sort of
brainwashes you.

422
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:50,231
- It does, huh?
- I don't know.

423
00:31:50,336 --> 00:31:55,103
- Your show would be the exception.
- Where is this dad anyway?

424
00:31:57,043 --> 00:32:00,035
He passed not too long ago.

425
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:03,013
I'm sorry about that.

426
00:32:03,116 --> 00:32:04,674
No. Cookie?

427
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,555
- What's your name?
- Blue.

428
00:32:10,657 --> 00:32:12,887
Your name is Blue.
No, it's not.

429
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:14,516
Yeah, it is.

430
00:32:14,627 --> 00:32:17,357
Do you know what my name is?

431
00:32:17,463 --> 00:32:20,023
What? Green?

432
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:22,863
No. Skye.

433
00:32:25,471 --> 00:32:27,530
Kinda weird.

434
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,904
What do you do
around here for fun?

435
00:32:52,332 --> 00:32:56,393
What is this?
Oh, no, she's gonna...

436
00:32:57,303 --> 00:32:59,498
Hey! Chill out.

437
00:32:59,606 --> 00:33:01,597
That's disgusting.
What are you doing?

438
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:02,868
Yuck!

439
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,443
You're disgusting.

440
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:05,943
You're disgusting.

441
00:33:07,547 --> 00:33:10,209
Don't throw up.

442
00:33:12,118 --> 00:33:13,949
I'm taking a piss.

443
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,397
This is Skye.

444
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:33,870
This is Cale, Ely and Haley.

445
00:33:33,973 --> 00:33:36,134
Blue sky.

446
00:33:36,242 --> 00:33:38,574
The code blue.

447
00:33:38,678 --> 00:33:40,669
There you go.

448
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:44,579
- It's all right.
- She don't drink?

449
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,112
You can't be worried
about cooties now.

450
00:33:48,221 --> 00:33:51,122
If you got contaminated,
it's over.

451
00:33:51,224 --> 00:33:52,987
We got those shots.

452
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:56,926
That made them feel better. If we died,
they'd feel like they did something.

453
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,591
Is this like your guys' hangout?

454
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,225
You can call it that.

455
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:06,635
It's the movie star!
And action!

456
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:10,937
This is Pete. He's a pretty funny guy.
We're not sure how he got funny.

457
00:34:11,044 --> 00:34:13,444
That's just how it is.

458
00:34:13,546 --> 00:34:16,344
What's this thing?

459
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:19,418
- That's the aqueduct.
- It takes water to Los Angeles.

460
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,419
That's where you get your Evian!

461
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:25,617
- What makes you think I drink Evian?
- Bright lights, big city.

462
00:34:27,026 --> 00:34:29,017
That'd be New York.

463
00:34:31,264 --> 00:34:36,793
All right. Who's up, man?
Somebody drink a brew.

464
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:42,598
- I'm all right.
- That's right. I forgot.

465
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:47,373
You drink too much of this, then you
have to pee, and we all see you squat.

466
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,641
- Do you wipe also?
- Yes, I also wipe.

467
00:34:49,749 --> 00:34:51,683
Fuck! Every time?

468
00:34:51,784 --> 00:34:53,342
That sucks.

469
00:34:53,453 --> 00:34:55,148
I'll take one.

470
00:34:56,789 --> 00:35:00,589
The movie star has a nut sack.

471
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:02,183
Yeah.

472
00:35:02,295 --> 00:35:06,197
- You should see me pee.
- I'd like that.

473
00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:10,736
You can find yourself extra linens
in the cupboard by the bathroom.

474
00:35:10,837 --> 00:35:12,805
Got it, thank you.
Thanks very much.

475
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:14,304
Yes.

476
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:31,154
- Blue, you ready to die, man?
- I hear it's a really bad death.

477
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:34,590
- Shut up. From who?
- Keeler.

478
00:35:34,694 --> 00:35:37,891
He said first you get all hot,
start sweating profusely...

479
00:35:37,997 --> 00:35:40,022
and everything gets real clear...

480
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:43,569
and tense, and then
you get really paranoid...

481
00:35:45,304 --> 00:35:48,034
like all your worst fears
start coming true.

482
00:35:48,141 --> 00:35:53,511
It's like the devil's inside of you
screaming, "I told you so!"

483
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:57,105
Then a billion worms hatch inside
your lungs and burrow out until you die.

484
00:35:57,216 --> 00:36:00,049
- Where do you come up with this stuff?
- It's true.

485
00:36:00,153 --> 00:36:03,054
They don't even know what it is.

486
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:05,056
They know, and it's bad.

487
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:09,120
I didn't want to have to do this.

488
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:16,859
What are you doing
throwing gunpowder in the fire?

489
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:21,736
It's not gunpowder. I boiled down some
Empire Cola shit. That was the residue.

490
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:23,968
- Holy shit.
- We're fucked.

491
00:36:24,076 --> 00:36:26,442
Just because it's flammable
doesn't mean it's lethal.

492
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,580
We could go anytime.

493
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,548
That's not funny.

494
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,957
That's not funny!

495
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:45,826
- Relax.
- Fucking dork.

496
00:37:12,325 --> 00:37:14,520
Where did that giant ice cream cone
come from?

497
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:20,557
My dad built it
to attract people to the town.

498
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:23,794
It was a major mining town
when he was a kid.

499
00:37:23,903 --> 00:37:27,771
When the gold ran out,
all the people left.

500
00:37:27,874 --> 00:37:32,208
After he built the cone,
the other towns started copying him.

501
00:37:32,311 --> 00:37:34,643
Now we have
the biggest of everything.

502
00:37:34,747 --> 00:37:38,148
There's the world's
tallest thermometer...

503
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:41,880
the world's largest hubcap collection,
bottle cap collection...

504
00:37:41,988 --> 00:37:44,320
even the largest ball of twine.

505
00:37:44,423 --> 00:37:46,448
You name it,
they have it out here.

506
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:00,729
Hey, there.

507
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:04,668
Sorry. I was snooping.

508
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:07,644
It's okay.
I wouldn't put it out...

509
00:38:07,747 --> 00:38:09,647
ifl didn't want people
to look at it.

510
00:38:09,749 --> 00:38:11,273
Oh, thanks.

511
00:38:11,384 --> 00:38:13,352
Did you see that one?

512
00:38:13,452 --> 00:38:14,851
- That?
- Yeah.

513
00:38:14,954 --> 00:38:17,855
I saw it, but I can't make
heads or tails of it.

514
00:38:17,957 --> 00:38:19,481
It's a UFO.

515
00:38:19,592 --> 00:38:21,492
- Really?
- Yeah. Look.

516
00:38:21,594 --> 00:38:25,758
I took this three years ago
in the hills. You can't see the hills.

517
00:38:25,865 --> 00:38:29,596
But there it is. My husband says that's
the government testing a new aircraft.

518
00:38:29,702 --> 00:38:31,670
But he was not there
when I took it.

519
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:36,674
I have to admit something. I have read
everything your husband ever wrote.

520
00:38:37,843 --> 00:38:41,711
Really. How he jump-started this town
back into existence with the big cone.

521
00:38:41,814 --> 00:38:44,339
Then he started the ocean park.
He was a real trendsetter.

522
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,351
- You can't believe everything you read.
- How's that?

523
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,021
He was a very unhappy man.

524
00:38:52,892 --> 00:38:56,055
That's weird. He looks so happy
in these pictures.

525
00:38:56,162 --> 00:38:59,563
Anybody can look happy
in a photograph.

526
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:06,261
- What is that?
- It's the plant.

527
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:10,399
That's where they make Empire Cola.
We get shitloads of it for free.

528
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:12,977
That's where that truck
was going today.

529
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,445
Strange looking.

530
00:39:15,548 --> 00:39:17,709
Yeah.

531
00:39:17,817 --> 00:39:21,651
They built it there because
they gotta feed from the aqueduct.

532
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:23,722
It's a pretty evil company.

533
00:39:23,823 --> 00:39:28,283
I've heard they exploit thousands
of workers in Mexico and Taiwan.

534
00:39:28,394 --> 00:39:32,353
When they set up shop here,
they didn't hire anybody from our town.

535
00:39:32,465 --> 00:39:35,957
They imported cheaper labor,
and set them up in Peaksville.

536
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:37,592
It's awful.

537
00:39:37,703 --> 00:39:41,400
The water was supposed
to be my dad's.

538
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:43,338
What for?

539
00:39:44,677 --> 00:39:46,406
An ocean park.

540
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:48,503
Baxter Beach.

541
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:52,607
My dad always said,
"We have all of this sand...

542
00:39:52,718 --> 00:39:54,379
but no beach.

543
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:57,285
And there's that damn aqueduct
passing on by...

544
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,484
with more water than an ocean."

545
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,960
He wanted to build
that thing so bad.

546
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:06,122
The cone put the town on the map.

547
00:40:06,232 --> 00:40:08,462
The ocean park would
keep it there for good.

548
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:11,593
The state originally had a deal
with my dad for the feed.

549
00:40:11,704 --> 00:40:13,831
But when the
soda proposal came in...

550
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:17,204
they immediately authorized it
and rejected my father's.

551
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:18,367
Assholes.

552
00:40:25,084 --> 00:40:27,609
How did your dad die?

553
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:31,488
It happened at the motel.

554
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,260
He'd been sleeping there
most of the time anyway.

555
00:40:36,362 --> 00:40:38,489
He was consumed with the beach.

556
00:40:38,597 --> 00:40:41,657
And he wasn't able to function
in his own house anymore.

557
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:43,826
Why not?

558
00:40:43,936 --> 00:40:45,836
I don't know.

559
00:40:50,543 --> 00:40:54,172
He thought I was losing my mind.

560
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,807
And I thought
he was losing his mind.

561
00:40:57,883 --> 00:41:01,683
Because all he did
was work on the water park.

562
00:41:01,787 --> 00:41:05,154
Then it just happened.
All of a sudden, just like that.

563
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:08,158
The motel burst into flames,
and he died in his sleep.

564
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,127
They told me
he didn't feel a thing.

565
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,629
Geez, I'm sorry.

566
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,335
- Any idea how the fire got started?
- They think it's the old wiring.

567
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:22,271
That building's been around
since the gold rush.

568
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:26,777
Brittle as hell.
It just went up like that.

569
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:30,007
It has been hardest on Blue.

570
00:41:31,584 --> 00:41:35,350
He spent the whole last year
with his dad on that beach.

571
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,684
Every afternoon after school,
and then on the weekends.

572
00:41:39,325 --> 00:41:42,590
Now he's taken the whole thing
on his own shoulders.

573
00:41:42,695 --> 00:41:45,220
He has even filed
his own appeal for water.

574
00:41:46,198 --> 00:41:48,189
I hope it doesn't
consume him, too.

575
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,202
You can put all that in your book
if you wanted to.

576
00:42:18,697 --> 00:42:20,756
Take your time.
When you finish eating...

577
00:42:20,866 --> 00:42:26,031
what do you say we take a walk
and check out the ocean park?

578
00:42:26,138 --> 00:42:27,969
No milk.

579
00:42:28,073 --> 00:42:30,166
No milk?

580
00:42:30,276 --> 00:42:35,213
We ran out of milk last night, and your
guys wouldn't let the milkman through.

581
00:42:35,314 --> 00:42:38,112
No milk.

582
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:53,256
- There's no milk.
- Thanks.

583
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:55,731
Frank, how you doing?
You look edgy.

584
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:57,495
You sleeping?

585
00:42:57,603 --> 00:42:59,002
Fine.

586
00:43:03,676 --> 00:43:06,304
Hey, guys, any news?

587
00:43:06,412 --> 00:43:09,779
Nothing yet. It's been, what, 15 hours?
These things take time.

588
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:13,477
I know that. I'd like to know something.
We don't know anything.

589
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,079
What are you people
really doing here?

590
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:20,818
Wait here.

591
00:43:24,196 --> 00:43:26,664
Maybe that's some news.

592
00:43:26,765 --> 00:43:28,164
So what?

593
00:43:37,476 --> 00:43:39,376
Environmental Protection Agency...

594
00:43:39,478 --> 00:43:43,676
Rules and Guidelines
to Hazardous Material Cleanup.

595
00:43:43,782 --> 00:43:45,977
Maybe that'll help you out.

596
00:43:50,556 --> 00:43:53,320
Is that the hotel?

597
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:56,593
God!

598
00:43:57,763 --> 00:43:59,731
There really was a fire, huh?

599
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:03,097
This is where it happened.

600
00:44:05,137 --> 00:44:06,536
It's sad.

601
00:44:13,746 --> 00:44:16,340
- You got a second?
- Sure. What's up?

602
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:20,809
I got a call from
the insurance company today.

603
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,219
They ran some tests
on the new samples.

604
00:44:26,225 --> 00:44:27,624
And...

605
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:32,358
- And?
- Sheriff.

606
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:36,264
- They're saying some strange things.
- Like what?

607
00:44:38,103 --> 00:44:41,072
Like maybe somebody
set fire to the motel.

608
00:44:41,173 --> 00:44:45,166
- Arson? They can't be serious.
- I know.

609
00:44:45,277 --> 00:44:48,610
I mean, who'd want
to burn down the motel?

610
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:51,711
I don't know.

611
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:54,911
But we're dealing
with more than arson.

612
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,217
That would make it
a case of manslaughter.

613
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,525
Sure is pretty out here.

614
00:45:13,372 --> 00:45:15,272
Except for that. What's that?

615
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:19,276
Empire Cola plant. They stole the water
to feed off the aqueduct...

616
00:45:19,378 --> 00:45:21,471
from Blue's dad.

617
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,071
That's why the ocean park
never opened.

618
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:27,152
And they exploit workers in Mexico.

619
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,128
Here it is.

620
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:43,933
- Where are you going?
- Get a closer look.

621
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:46,903
- Let him work.
- Huh?

622
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:49,064
You can come back later.

623
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:19,635
What happened last night?

624
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:22,138
Did you close or what?
Give me the details.

625
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:25,802
- Don't smell my fingers!
- Give me the details!

626
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:27,378
No details.

627
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:30,380
- Did you get her frombi?
- Frombi?

628
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:32,109
From behind?

629
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:35,811
Nothing happened.

630
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,218
Nothing?

631
00:46:37,322 --> 00:46:41,190
Nothing, man. All we did was talk.
I don't even know where her head is.

632
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:43,488
Where her head is?

633
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,830
First prize is the pussy.

634
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:50,060
Second prize is a set of steak knives.
You want the steak knives?

635
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:54,404
Why the fuck do you care
where her head's at?

636
00:46:56,475 --> 00:46:57,669
Hello, Skye.

637
00:46:57,776 --> 00:46:59,141
Frombi!

638
00:46:59,244 --> 00:47:00,677
Shut up, dude!

639
00:47:02,714 --> 00:47:04,682
I'm outta here.

640
00:47:10,055 --> 00:47:11,818
702...

641
00:47:11,924 --> 00:47:14,654
555-4388.

642
00:47:15,994 --> 00:47:19,122
Yeah. Okay, talk to you later.

643
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:21,722
Bye.

644
00:47:21,834 --> 00:47:24,667
- Sterling Brock is gonna call me.
- Here?

645
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:26,260
Yeah!

646
00:47:27,673 --> 00:47:30,540
That must've been because he heard
you were hanging out with me.

647
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,374
I always forget to drink water
before I go to bed wasted.

648
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,986
If you drink enough water,
you can pee out your hangover.

649
00:47:42,087 --> 00:47:44,885
You don't pee out your hangover.
You replenish fluids.

650
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,423
Replenish fluids!

651
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:50,492
I called my friend in Barstow.
She said...

652
00:47:50,596 --> 00:47:54,054
she saw you on some TV show,
Maggie's World.

653
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,691
- She said you were pretty funny.
- Thanks.

654
00:47:58,403 --> 00:48:00,394
Is your dad going
to miss these much?

655
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:02,474
He's not gonna care.
Come on.

656
00:48:02,574 --> 00:48:04,064
You guys!

657
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,012
Let's go, baby,
right down the middle.

658
00:48:11,116 --> 00:48:12,981
Right down the middle.

659
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:34,062
Let's go, baby, right in here.

660
00:48:39,077 --> 00:48:41,375
It's like cracking
somebody's head open.

661
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,607
- You're sick.
- Yep.

662
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:48,512
What was that?

663
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,281
Who's up now?

664
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:51,583
It's Pete.

665
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,988
He's got the potato cannon.

666
00:48:54,092 --> 00:48:56,083
This is war!

667
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:57,525
Let's retaliate.

668
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,349
Fucking loser!

669
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:25,446
Loser!

670
00:49:25,557 --> 00:49:28,424
Stop it! You stay still.

671
00:49:31,463 --> 00:49:33,294
There.

672
00:49:33,398 --> 00:49:35,525
What is it?

673
00:49:35,634 --> 00:49:37,033
Pulp.

674
00:49:38,437 --> 00:49:41,736
All right, that's it
for orange baseball.

675
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,035
I want you to go read
a good book or something.

676
00:49:44,142 --> 00:49:48,442
What are you saying? I have a race
to go to tomorrow and practice today.

677
00:49:48,547 --> 00:49:51,015
Son, forget about that race.

678
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:54,347
The best thing for you
is to go home and park that buggy.

679
00:49:55,387 --> 00:49:56,786
Buggy?

680
00:49:57,723 --> 00:50:00,556
This is an all-terrain vehicle.
Fifty-five horsepower.

681
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:03,594
- And 8,000 VT. Turbo.
- I'm very impressed.

682
00:50:03,695 --> 00:50:05,822
High performance.

683
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:09,025
Now you and your
all-terrain vehicle...

684
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,034
you're staying in town.

685
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:14,833
Hazardous materials could be in
that truck. We can't take any chances.

686
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,067
This is fucking bullshit!
Let me through!

687
00:50:17,175 --> 00:50:19,439
Son, it's for your own good.

688
00:50:24,483 --> 00:50:26,383
I was trained as a navy SEAL.

689
00:50:46,638 --> 00:50:48,538
Those guys are pissing me off.

690
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,835
What's going on?

691
00:50:50,942 --> 00:50:53,206
They told me I can't go
to this race tomorrow.

692
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,370
What the fuck?

693
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,505
What are you gonna do about it?

694
00:50:58,617 --> 00:51:00,209
I don't know.

695
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:03,151
I'm gonna go bust some shit up.

696
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,321
I'll be back.

697
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:39,218
Wow, must have good people
working for you.

698
00:51:39,324 --> 00:51:42,555
No, they aren't here for me.

699
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:45,763
I was joking.

700
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:50,562
I bet you it is the TV people.

701
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:53,466
News broadcasters
love this kind of shit.

702
00:51:55,974 --> 00:51:57,635
Think we're on TV?

703
00:52:00,879 --> 00:52:03,006
Hey, over here!

704
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:07,341
I guess it'd be
nothing new to you.

705
00:52:11,123 --> 00:52:13,148
My dad hated the news!

706
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:18,389
He said the news is the only business
where people are happy when people die.

707
00:52:18,497 --> 00:52:21,227
- Happy?
- Yeah.

708
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:26,828
A big story means some reporter gets
their name on the front of a newspaper.

709
00:52:26,938 --> 00:52:30,339
They might even
throw an office party.

710
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:40,384
We gotta talk to you.

711
00:52:40,485 --> 00:52:44,683
It's been nearly 48 hours,
and we need some information.

712
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:48,819
People around here
are getting scared.

713
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:51,862
- I do not have to tell you anything.
- You do!

714
00:52:51,963 --> 00:52:56,263
Look. It says here,
"In 1986 the EPA passed...

715
00:52:56,368 --> 00:53:00,896
the Emergency Right To Know Act
under which any community at risk..."

716
00:53:01,006 --> 00:53:03,941
"Has a right to know the extent
of the danger."

717
00:53:04,042 --> 00:53:05,976
You have to tell us what you know.

718
00:53:06,077 --> 00:53:07,840
I already did.

719
00:53:07,946 --> 00:53:09,971
You've told us nothing.

720
00:53:10,081 --> 00:53:12,811
Which is exactly what we know.
Nothing.

721
00:53:13,685 --> 00:53:15,243
What do you mean?

722
00:53:15,353 --> 00:53:20,655
You talk on the phone all day,
and you don't know anything?

723
00:53:20,759 --> 00:53:22,488
Exactly.

724
00:53:25,096 --> 00:53:26,723
You bastard.

725
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:55,525
Anybody seen Keeler?

726
00:53:56,461 --> 00:53:58,691
The mayor needs to talk to him.

727
00:53:58,797 --> 00:54:04,258
Looks like that position in Peaksville
will work out if we live.

728
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:09,102
Sheriff, this government guy
won't say anything.

729
00:54:09,207 --> 00:54:12,233
What the hell is going on?
Can you do something?

730
00:54:12,344 --> 00:54:15,245
I don't know what to say, Sandy.
It's their show.

731
00:54:15,347 --> 00:54:17,781
My hands are tied.

732
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:22,186
Any news?

733
00:54:22,287 --> 00:54:24,016
Nothing yet.

734
00:54:30,662 --> 00:54:32,027
They found...

735
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:36,999
traces of gasoline
in parts of the samples.

736
00:54:40,872 --> 00:54:44,137
- I don't know how to ask you this.
- What?

737
00:54:47,178 --> 00:54:50,978
They're saying someone intentionally
set fire to the motel.

738
00:54:51,082 --> 00:54:53,346
They're saying it was arson.

739
00:54:53,451 --> 00:54:55,385
Arson?

740
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,320
Gotta be honest with me,
Elizabeth.

741
00:54:58,423 --> 00:55:02,325
You think I burned down the motel?
I didn't do it!

742
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:07,296
Tell the truth. The earlier I can get
involved with this, the better.

743
00:55:07,399 --> 00:55:09,731
But I need to know the truth.

744
00:55:12,404 --> 00:55:16,306
If you could do anything you wanted to
right now, what would it be?

745
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:21,743
- Go swimming in the ocean.
- You've never been to the ocean?

746
00:55:21,846 --> 00:55:24,314
Maybe it's because
these are everywhere.

747
00:55:26,418 --> 00:55:28,784
Seashells in the desert.

748
00:55:30,588 --> 00:55:32,783
I think this used to be an ocean.

749
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:35,792
And right now we're walking
on the ocean floor.

750
00:55:37,362 --> 00:55:39,023
You see those bushes?

751
00:55:39,998 --> 00:55:42,364
Those used to be kelp.

752
00:55:43,535 --> 00:55:46,333
Why didn't your dad
ever take you there?

753
00:55:48,006 --> 00:55:52,409
I don't know. I guess he was
so fixed on bringing the ocean here.

754
00:55:56,047 --> 00:55:58,538
It's beautiful.

755
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:01,118
We all thought that people
would travel miles...

756
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:03,915
just to spend the day
by the water...

757
00:56:04,022 --> 00:56:05,922
go canoeing...

758
00:56:06,024 --> 00:56:09,050
go down the water slide or...

759
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,458
just lay out in the sun.

760
00:56:14,399 --> 00:56:16,697
Even if the state
doesn't get us the water...

761
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:20,703
the "big one" will wipe out L.A. And
we'll be sitting on beachfront property.

762
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:33,816
You know,
if you close your eyes...

763
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,320
you can pretend there's water.

764
00:57:09,554 --> 00:57:12,955
Fuck them, man.
They can't just keep me out of the race.

765
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:14,787
I'm winning that
fucking thing tomorrow.

766
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:18,725
You guys wanna get
cremated or buried?

767
00:57:20,298 --> 00:57:21,856
I don't care. Whatever.

768
00:57:21,966 --> 00:57:24,491
- What does it matter?
- It matters.

769
00:57:24,602 --> 00:57:27,662
I don't wanna rot in a box
while some bugs...

770
00:57:27,772 --> 00:57:30,536
and worms and weird animals
eat out my eyeballs.

771
00:57:30,642 --> 00:57:34,203
- I wanna rot in a box.
- Me too. I don't wanna be burned.

772
00:57:34,312 --> 00:57:37,509
I wanna be cremated.
How about you?

773
00:57:37,615 --> 00:57:40,083
Cremated.

774
00:57:40,185 --> 00:57:42,585
And then have my ashes
thrown in the ocean.

775
00:57:42,687 --> 00:57:45,383
- I just thought of something.
- Congratulations.

776
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:48,015
- We have to make up our wills.
- Hello, Hershey squirt.

777
00:57:48,126 --> 00:57:50,458
If you go, we all go.

778
00:57:50,562 --> 00:57:53,622
So who are you gonna
leave all your stuff to?

779
00:57:53,731 --> 00:57:56,222
- Fuck the wills.
- We're not going anywhere.

780
00:57:56,334 --> 00:58:00,031
Let's say we do.
Let's say we all die, like tomorrow.

781
00:58:00,138 --> 00:58:03,266
This is our last night.
What's the one thing you'd wanna do?

782
00:58:04,642 --> 00:58:05,870
You go first.

783
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,105
I'd try to make it to tomorrow night
and win that fucking race.

784
00:58:11,216 --> 00:58:14,549
- That's it.
- They're watching the town pretty close.

785
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,784
They're gonna watch me
fucking burn rubber on their heads.

786
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:21,358
You got an all-terrain vehicle
for nothing.

787
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,093
What about you?

788
00:58:24,195 --> 00:58:27,289
I wanna blow myself up
in front of my family.

789
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:29,857
Don't laugh. She's serious.

790
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:32,129
That'd be so cool.

791
00:58:32,237 --> 00:58:35,729
"Mom, Dad." "Yes?"
Boom.

792
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,741
I got the shit to do it, too.
I could blow up this whole town.

793
00:58:38,843 --> 00:58:40,401
It's true.

794
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,444
- Your turn.
- I don't know.

795
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:50,049
I've never been able
to figure out what I wanna do.

796
00:58:50,155 --> 00:58:52,783
- I hate that question.
- Come on, Deputy.

797
00:58:52,891 --> 00:58:54,620
- What?
- Tell them.

798
00:58:54,726 --> 00:58:57,422
- Tell them what?
- Out with it, Cale.

799
00:58:57,529 --> 00:59:01,090
Cale wants to take Keeler's position
as deputy sheriff when he leaves.

800
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:04,592
What's so funny?
Cale will make a great deputy.

801
00:59:04,702 --> 00:59:07,000
The first thing I'd do
is lock your sorry ass up.

802
00:59:07,105 --> 00:59:10,006
- Fuck you.
- And then yours.

803
00:59:10,108 --> 00:59:13,271
But that's long-term.
I'm talking about now.

804
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:15,903
If there's one thing you could do
right now, what would it be?

805
00:59:17,148 --> 00:59:19,810
I don't know.

806
00:59:19,918 --> 00:59:21,909
Get fucked up, I guess.

807
00:59:22,954 --> 00:59:24,854
What about you, Blue?

808
00:59:25,957 --> 00:59:28,050
- I don't know.
- Oh, God.

809
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:30,218
You guys have no balls.

810
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,370
She stole my idea.

811
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:48,866
He's on the bike.
He's heading your way.

812
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:55,011
Do not cross the roadblock!

813
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:03,516
Hey, come back here!
Come back here right now!

814
01:01:12,263 --> 01:01:14,163
Did you hear that?

815
01:01:15,867 --> 01:01:17,994
What?

816
01:01:18,102 --> 01:01:20,627
I don't know.

817
01:01:20,738 --> 01:01:20,965
- Jesus Christ!
- What the hell happened here?

818
01:01:23,675 --> 01:01:27,475
- This guy shot him.
- I was aiming for the tire.

819
01:01:27,578 --> 01:01:29,739
- He's breathing.
- Is he okay?

820
01:01:29,847 --> 01:01:32,247
This is unbelievable.

821
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:35,911
- Are you out of your mind?
- You don't know what we're dealing with.

822
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,250
You don't know what you're
dealing with! He's a kid!

823
01:01:38,356 --> 01:01:41,587
- You can't just shoot him!
- He blatantly disobeyed federal agents.

824
01:01:41,693 --> 01:01:44,321
- He was on his way to a race!
- Let's get him to my office.

825
01:01:44,429 --> 01:01:47,023
- Is he gonna be all right?
- He hit the shoulder.

826
01:01:47,131 --> 01:01:49,099
But he was going fast
when he took the fall.

827
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,361
I'm gonna get the stretcher.
Don't move him!

828
01:01:51,469 --> 01:01:53,767
- What happened?
- This guy here shot him.

829
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:09,314
What were you thinking?
He was fleeing. He didn't pose a threat.

830
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,651
He was out of range
for you to shoot accurately.

831
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:17,523
- I don't know.
- You shot him in the back.

832
01:02:23,301 --> 01:02:25,895
I'm gonna have to
ask you for your gun, Frank.

833
01:02:54,832 --> 01:02:57,494
I can't believe they can just
shoot someone like that.

834
01:02:57,602 --> 01:03:00,537
You should see the cops where I live.
They're such assholes.

835
01:03:02,573 --> 01:03:05,565
They can do whatever they want
whenever they want.

836
01:03:05,676 --> 01:03:08,372
Run red lights, stop signs...

837
01:03:08,479 --> 01:03:10,640
make illegal u-turns
all the time...

838
01:03:10,748 --> 01:03:13,012
put their sirens on
just to go to the doughnut shop.

839
01:03:14,185 --> 01:03:16,585
A friend of mine
has this bumper sticker:

840
01:03:16,687 --> 01:03:19,087
"Save a doughnut. Shoot a cop."

841
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,328
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

842
01:03:33,304 --> 01:03:33,497
There's the green flag. We're in the
final lap of the 1998 ATV Invitational.

843
01:03:37,942 --> 01:03:40,137
What a race
this is turning out to be.

844
01:03:40,244 --> 01:03:42,405
Telly Clems is still
holding onto the lead by a lap.

845
01:03:42,513 --> 01:03:45,311
Clems rounds a hairpin.
Beautiful execution.

846
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:48,010
Look at him go,
over the short jump flawlessly!

847
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:50,553
But here comes Randy Flowers
coming up on the outside.

848
01:03:50,655 --> 01:03:53,283
Clems takes the south turn to the
final stretch for the checkered flag.

849
01:03:53,391 --> 01:03:57,054
Flowers is closing in on him.
This is a race, folks!

850
01:03:58,296 --> 01:04:00,287
Telly Clems takes first place...

851
01:04:06,204 --> 01:04:09,298
Holy shit! What was that?

852
01:04:09,407 --> 01:04:11,136
She's done it this time.

853
01:04:15,046 --> 01:04:17,742
That's my car.
Who in the hell did this?

854
01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:20,716
- Relax, Frank.
- Fuck off, you jerk-off!

855
01:04:20,818 --> 01:04:23,480
- I didn't do anything!
- Are you responsible for this?

856
01:04:23,588 --> 01:04:26,056
Are you responsible
for shooting my boyfriend?

857
01:04:26,157 --> 01:04:29,320
- We're not talking about that now.
- Did you blow up that car?

858
01:04:29,427 --> 01:04:33,659
- I had nothing to do with it, sir.
- I saw her put a device in the gas tank.

859
01:04:33,764 --> 01:04:37,256
- She lit it with this.
- What's this lighter for?

860
01:04:37,368 --> 01:04:39,598
To light the dynamite
I'm gonna shove up your ass!

861
01:04:40,571 --> 01:04:42,471
What do you want us
to do with her?

862
01:04:43,474 --> 01:04:46,466
Why don't you just
pop her in the back of the head?

863
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:53,146
Why don't you take a walk?

864
01:04:54,785 --> 01:04:57,117
Take a walk.

865
01:04:57,221 --> 01:04:58,654
This is a serious offense.

866
01:04:58,756 --> 01:05:01,316
- You blew up federal property.
- He shot him.

867
01:05:01,425 --> 01:05:05,794
I know he did, but someone could have
been seriously hurt or even killed.

868
01:05:10,368 --> 01:05:12,928
How about you promise me
you won't blow anything else up?

869
01:05:14,138 --> 01:05:15,605
Okay.

870
01:05:17,141 --> 01:05:19,041
Let her go.

871
01:05:31,088 --> 01:05:34,057
Totally flipped.
She totalled it.

872
01:05:34,158 --> 01:05:36,649
- Good job.
- Thanks.

873
01:05:36,761 --> 01:05:39,821
You should have seen it.
It was great.

874
01:05:39,931 --> 01:05:43,890
- Are those painkillers?
- Yeah, these are.

875
01:05:44,001 --> 01:05:46,299
Those are real good for pain.

876
01:05:48,439 --> 01:05:50,999
- What was it like getting shot?
- I got shot in the back.

877
01:05:51,108 --> 01:05:54,874
And then the bullet came out
where the blood is.

878
01:05:54,979 --> 01:05:57,573
- That's disgusting.
- It went all the way through?

879
01:05:57,682 --> 01:06:00,242
- With our new 1998 champion...
- Turn it up.

880
01:06:00,351 --> 01:06:04,583
Did the absence of champion Pete Kepler
take anything out of the race for you?

881
01:06:04,689 --> 01:06:07,214
- I would've smoked him.
- Last year was luck.

882
01:06:07,325 --> 01:06:10,021
If he'd been here today,
he'd only see my rear tires.

883
01:06:10,127 --> 01:06:13,824
Big words from the new winner
of the Peaksville Invitational.

884
01:06:15,466 --> 01:06:17,593
- Cocksucker.
- Next year, champ.

885
01:06:19,136 --> 01:06:21,331
Do you want another painkiller?

886
01:06:24,475 --> 01:06:26,602
It was just an M-80
in the gas tank.

887
01:06:26,711 --> 01:06:31,546
You dangle it in about an inch above
the gas, then run away from the car.

888
01:06:31,649 --> 01:06:35,210
That shit really blew up.
It must've been low on gas.

889
01:06:35,319 --> 01:06:38,117
The lower the gas,
the bigger the bang.

890
01:06:38,222 --> 01:06:40,122
You read all this in a magazine?

891
01:06:42,059 --> 01:06:44,892
- You can buy all this?
- Yeah.

892
01:06:44,996 --> 01:06:48,898
The explosives are more difficult.
They're controlled, like drugs.

893
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,560
But I've got a great contact in Nevada
if you ever want anything.

894
01:06:51,669 --> 01:06:54,069
Thanks.

895
01:06:55,072 --> 01:06:57,438
- What is this?
- A pipe.

896
01:06:57,541 --> 01:06:59,566
Yeah, I can see that.

897
01:06:59,677 --> 01:07:03,204
You fill that with gunpowder,
and then you can add metal pieces...

898
01:07:03,314 --> 01:07:06,078
like nuts and screws and stuff.

899
01:07:06,183 --> 01:07:08,083
And then you put in a charge.

900
01:07:08,185 --> 01:07:11,245
It's like the tip of a match,
except it's ignited by battery.

901
01:07:11,355 --> 01:07:14,882
So you connect both ends of this
to a battery, and boom.

902
01:07:14,992 --> 01:07:18,792
I don't have a remote kit yet, so I run
wire from the bomb to the detonator.

903
01:07:18,896 --> 01:07:22,559
- The remote kit's like 500 bucks.
- You're really into this stuff.

904
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:25,659
It's sort of like a sport, you know?
Like skeet shooting.

905
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:27,067
Skeet shooting?

906
01:07:27,171 --> 01:07:29,196
Imagine if bombing
was an Olympic sport.

907
01:07:29,306 --> 01:07:33,766
Two teams are given the same supplies
to destroy the same target.

908
01:07:35,046 --> 01:07:37,480
Whoever destroys it
the best, wins.

909
01:07:37,581 --> 01:07:39,674
I'd bring home the gold.

910
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:44,019
I'm scared, Billy.

911
01:07:45,122 --> 01:07:46,783
Don't be.

912
01:07:52,129 --> 01:07:54,529
That shit was really scary.

913
01:07:54,632 --> 01:07:57,795
I don't think I've ever seen
anything like that before.

914
01:07:57,902 --> 01:08:01,201
There's a lot of dynamite around here
from the old mining days.

915
01:08:01,305 --> 01:08:05,674
- They used pipe bombs to mine gold?
- No, they didn't use pipe bombs.

916
01:08:05,776 --> 01:08:08,802
Ely has done a little
modification of the materials.

917
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:42,342
All right, listen up.

918
01:08:42,446 --> 01:08:45,677
I just spoke with Dr. Gordon.

919
01:08:45,783 --> 01:08:48,809
Says we're all gonna be okay.
It was a blood clot.

920
01:08:48,919 --> 01:08:51,444
- A blood clot?
- Affirmative.

921
01:08:51,555 --> 01:08:55,651
A blood clot entered his heart.
No more driver.

922
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,354
- Baxter is safe once again.
- See? We're okay.

923
01:08:58,462 --> 01:09:00,896
- Hallelujah!
- I knew it.

924
01:09:00,998 --> 01:09:02,693
You did not!

925
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,768
Set me up with a cool one.

926
01:09:07,872 --> 01:09:10,636
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

927
01:09:10,741 --> 01:09:13,539
- We're okay.
- I know.

928
01:09:15,613 --> 01:09:19,413
I was just having
a fun time dying with you.

929
01:09:19,517 --> 01:09:22,782
If we get all our stuff together,
we can be on the road in ten minutes.

930
01:09:24,088 --> 01:09:26,283
Just kidding.
We're gonna leave in the morning.

931
01:09:31,028 --> 01:09:32,928
I gotta go tell Pete.

932
01:09:34,865 --> 01:09:37,425
We're okay.
You can go home now.

933
01:09:39,003 --> 01:09:42,200
- Haven't seen Agent Bellows, have you?
- No, I haven't.

934
01:09:42,306 --> 01:09:46,037
- I can't find him anywhere.
- Have you tried calling his cell phone?

935
01:09:46,143 --> 01:09:48,475
I tried,
but he's not picking up.

936
01:09:48,579 --> 01:09:50,979
I've been thinking
that he's been abducted.

937
01:09:51,081 --> 01:09:54,016
Of course,
he would be an odd choice.

938
01:09:54,118 --> 01:09:57,747
But if you wanna call him again,
phone's right there.

939
01:09:57,855 --> 01:09:59,413
Thanks.

940
01:10:04,829 --> 01:10:09,596
So we can go up to Peaksville tonight.
They have a bowling alley.

941
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,430
Or we can be original...

942
01:10:12,536 --> 01:10:15,937
and start a bonfire
and hang out at the aqueduct.

943
01:10:21,378 --> 01:10:23,471
Come on!

944
01:10:23,581 --> 01:10:25,173
Cheer up.

945
01:10:25,282 --> 01:10:27,182
Let's see those golden gloves.

946
01:10:30,054 --> 01:10:32,750
Back to all
the big auditions and shit.

947
01:10:32,857 --> 01:10:35,121
Sterling Brock.

948
01:10:35,226 --> 01:10:37,126
Oil Slick.

949
01:10:43,734 --> 01:10:46,601
- Did you hear that?
- What?

950
01:10:46,704 --> 01:10:48,365
That.

951
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:55,677
Are you coming?

952
01:10:55,779 --> 01:10:59,078
No. I'll hang out here.

953
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:09,816
Blue! Come here!

954
01:11:17,968 --> 01:11:19,401
Is he okay?

955
01:11:19,503 --> 01:11:22,063
Yeah. He's breathing.

956
01:11:22,172 --> 01:11:26,632
I guess he just passed out
or something. He's drunk.

957
01:11:26,744 --> 01:11:30,236
Detective Bellows?
He stinks.

958
01:11:30,347 --> 01:11:33,145
I'll get help.

959
01:11:53,537 --> 01:11:55,767
Is he dead?

960
01:11:55,873 --> 01:11:58,307
No. He just mixed
Xanax with alcohol.

961
01:11:58,409 --> 01:12:01,776
Are you kidding me?
Xanax with alcohol?

962
01:12:01,879 --> 01:12:04,507
- Pussy.
- Where's Blue?

963
01:12:04,615 --> 01:12:06,276
I don't know.

964
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:43,653
You all right?

965
01:12:43,754 --> 01:12:45,415
Yeah.

966
01:12:46,957 --> 01:12:49,050
Are you sure?

967
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:52,390
Yeah. I just got
sort off reaked out.

968
01:12:53,964 --> 01:12:55,932
Yeah, me too.

969
01:12:56,033 --> 01:12:58,866
I thought he was dead
there for a second.

970
01:12:58,969 --> 01:13:01,164
I've never seen
a dead body before.

971
01:13:02,506 --> 01:13:04,064
You?

972
01:13:08,545 --> 01:13:11,013
Are you sure you're all right?

973
01:13:14,585 --> 01:13:16,917
Yeah, it's just...

974
01:13:17,021 --> 01:13:20,821
that's the first time
I've been in there since...

975
01:13:20,924 --> 01:13:23,154
my dad hung himself.

976
01:13:25,662 --> 01:13:28,062
I thought he died in his sleep.

977
01:13:28,165 --> 01:13:30,565
Yeah, that's what everyone thinks.

978
01:13:33,437 --> 01:13:35,837
But it's not true.

979
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:37,998
He hung himself
and I found him.

980
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:43,373
He left a note saying
how sorry he was.

981
01:13:44,148 --> 01:13:47,083
But he didn't say why he did it.

982
01:13:49,453 --> 01:13:51,853
I'm sure it was
because of this place.

983
01:13:57,461 --> 01:14:00,453
Just wanted everyone
to remember him as...

984
01:14:00,564 --> 01:14:02,794
someone who was happy.

985
01:14:05,069 --> 01:14:07,299
He wasn't happy, though.
He wasn't happy at all.

986
01:14:11,308 --> 01:14:14,368
I couldn't let him
just go like that.

987
01:14:14,478 --> 01:14:17,208
Everyone would have
called him a failure.

988
01:14:23,187 --> 01:14:25,985
I took him down
and put him in bed.

989
01:14:35,432 --> 01:14:37,832
Then I set fire to the place.

990
01:16:14,131 --> 01:16:16,031
Look at what I'm doing.

991
01:16:16,133 --> 01:16:20,035
I dug up some old photographs,
so I thought I'd make a new album.

992
01:16:21,438 --> 01:16:23,929
I like this one.
This one's good.

993
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:34,881
What's wrong?

994
01:17:04,548 --> 01:17:07,483
I could blow up your dad's car
if you wanna stay longer.

995
01:17:07,584 --> 01:17:09,779
Thanks.

996
01:17:09,886 --> 01:17:11,251
- Where's Blue?
- Said he'd meet us here.

997
01:17:11,355 --> 01:17:14,415
Blue is probably out
squatting in the bushes.

998
01:17:14,524 --> 01:17:18,324
- Maybe he shouldn't have come out.
- It's the painkillers. He'll be fine.

999
01:17:18,428 --> 01:17:20,919
Didn't you see what happened
to the detective?

1000
01:17:21,031 --> 01:17:23,056
You're not supposed to
mix those things with alcohol.

1001
01:17:23,166 --> 01:17:26,260
You shut down your respiratory system,
and now everyone's a doctor.

1002
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:31,239
- I'm celebrating our newfound freedom.
- Is this gonna get boring again?

1003
01:17:31,341 --> 01:17:34,071
- I liked having those freaks around.
- What do you mean?

1004
01:17:34,177 --> 01:17:36,771
- They shot me.
- It'd be different if you were dead.

1005
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,713
You guys, it's been
really cool being here.

1006
01:17:39,816 --> 01:17:41,283
I'll drink to that.

1007
01:17:44,254 --> 01:17:47,746
What's the chance he'll get here?

1008
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:06,908
I thought I was
doing the right thing.

1009
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:08,910
For my dad.

1010
01:18:10,013 --> 01:18:11,913
I'm sorry.

1011
01:18:13,817 --> 01:18:16,047
I'll help you rebuild it.

1012
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:24,153
Billy, are you covered
against arson?

1013
01:18:26,763 --> 01:18:28,731
Yeah.

1014
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,600
It's just...

1015
01:19:00,297 --> 01:19:01,992
So...

1016
01:19:04,234 --> 01:19:06,828
now that we know everything...

1017
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:14,200
what do you say we just pretend
that we know nothing?

1018
01:19:26,056 --> 01:19:28,115
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

1019
01:19:29,826 --> 01:19:31,987
He's all yours.

1020
01:19:35,532 --> 01:19:39,059
So, how'd it go?

1021
01:19:39,169 --> 01:19:42,161
Got a new job
building the motel.

1022
01:19:42,272 --> 01:19:45,241
- Cool.
- When do you leave?

1023
01:19:45,342 --> 01:19:47,435
About 20 minutes.

1024
01:19:50,414 --> 01:19:52,473
Let's go for a ride then.

1025
01:20:05,862 --> 01:20:08,558
There's a Sterling Brock
on the phone for you.

1026
01:20:12,769 --> 01:20:15,897
- Can you take a message?
- Okay.

1027
01:20:16,006 --> 01:20:18,600
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1028
01:20:19,743 --> 01:20:21,301
All right.

1029
01:21:27,777 --> 01:21:30,109
What's up, poster girl?

1030
01:21:30,213 --> 01:21:34,172
Deputy, huh?
You won't ever arrest me, will you?

1031
01:21:35,619 --> 01:21:37,018
Probably not.

1032
01:21:38,788 --> 01:21:40,983
Telly, this is Pete.
I'm number one.

1033
01:21:41,091 --> 01:21:43,582
I'm number one,
you fucking scumbag!

1034
01:21:43,693 --> 01:21:46,821
And when my brother starts racing,
you'll be number three.

1035
01:22:11,354 --> 01:22:13,879
Kids went for a ride.
They're coming right back.

1036
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:17,391
I just came by
to say thanks for everything.

1037
01:22:17,494 --> 01:22:21,055
Well, you're welcome.
It was nice having you here.

1038
01:22:21,164 --> 01:22:23,359
I was thinking,
next time I come up north...

1039
01:22:23,466 --> 01:22:25,991
if I could maybe
stop by and see you.

1040
01:22:26,102 --> 01:22:28,900
- I'd like that.
- It'd be okay?

1041
01:22:29,005 --> 01:22:29,334
They turned into
these invisible ninjas...

1042
01:22:31,608 --> 01:22:34,168
and they had all these
throwing stars and...

1043
01:22:36,613 --> 01:22:38,513
Holy shit.

1044
01:22:40,584 --> 01:22:43,348
- What was that?
- That's Ely.

1045
01:22:43,453 --> 01:22:45,045
Oh, shit.

1046
01:22:45,155 --> 01:22:47,055
That was the big one.

1047
01:23:10,246 --> 01:23:12,146
I'll drive.

1048
01:23:39,609 --> 01:23:41,804
She's in for it now.

1049
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
