35
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:15,020
Are you gambling tonight?

36
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:20,418
Damn! Why you always come to me
only before you go gambling?

37
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,227
What, you think I am
some kind of tranquilizer?

38
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:25,225
Okay, I won't come next time.

39
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:27,461
Can't you be sweet to me?

40
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:32,371
Be sweet? Cheating is my job.

41
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:34,435
You have to pay me
to be sweet to you.

42
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:39,213
I've never seen you carrying a knife.

43
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:40,913
Is there going to be danger tonight?

44
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:44,046
Are you scared?

45
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:45,610
I have two knives.

46
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,847
But I think you will never
get to see the second one.

47
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:52,758
I'll call you, bye.

48
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,537
Do remember it.

49
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,300
Let me tell you,

50
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,001
don't ever use this color
of lipstick again, okay?

51
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,176
Why are you so picky
when it comes to color?

52
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:12,978
Think about it,

53
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,214
if I can't tell the difference
between a red heart and a black spade.

54
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,816
What good does it do to me?

55
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:21,849
Bye.

56
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:25,891
Why are you here?

57
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:26,927
You are really here!

58
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:28,962
Is that you wife?

59
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:30,964
Yes.

60
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:34,428
You are really good,
you can find your way here.

61
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:36,003
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:37,974 --> 00:03:38,872
I am in hurry.

63
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:40,841
If you want to fight,
wait until I get home.

64
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:44,939
I don't want to fight,
I just want an answer from you.

65
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:50,518
I just put on my pants
five minutes ago.

66
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:52,046
Do you get it now?

67
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:55,383
I was going to tell you something,

68
00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:58,726
but I guess that
is not necessary now.

69
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:00,418
Bye.

70
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,096
I think you should go talk to her.

71
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,694
If woman wants to fight,
she just needs a good kick.

72
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,870
But she is quiet,
you should go check on her!

73
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:11,568
Look at what you are wearing,
go back inside.

74
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,452
King.

75
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:33,325
Did you wife find out?

76
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,924
It's time, drive.

77
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:44,570
Chung, Fanny in these days...

78
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,399
There is nothing.

79
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:51,639
King, listen to me, this couple
of days when you were not home,

80
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:54,682
your wife vomited many times.
I think she is pregnant.

81
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:59,980
Anyway, is everything in place?

82
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:03,153
Jack's already worked in Bad Temper's
restaurant for three month.

83
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,451
He works hard
and gets everything done.

84
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:06,885
Everyone trust him.

85
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:08,958
Now he is able
to set up the VIP room.

86
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:10,691
Everything is in place.

87
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:13,262
How is Bad Temper's card skill?

88
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:15,302
So so.

89
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:18,265
Eighty points?

90
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:20,741
Yes. But his name
tells the whole story.

91
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,777
We are going to win no matter what.

92
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:29,450
King, be honest with you,

93
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,219
your wife is a good woman.

94
00:05:33,656 --> 00:05:34,748
If you like, you can have her.

95
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:38,259
Really? Stupid.

96
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:40,985
We, as a sharper,

97
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:42,859
we can't get distracted.

98
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,057
If we are going to cheat,
we have to do it right.

99
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:47,963
Just like Macau Mon.

100
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:49,527
Your idol?

101
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:50,761
My target.

102
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,467
I have to beat him.

103
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:58,272
I want to be like him,
get rich from gambling.

104
00:05:58,882 --> 00:05:59,780
But I heard others say...

105
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:04,085
anyone offends Mon
will regret at last.

106
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:08,547
There are always exceptions.
Maybe I will be the first one.

107
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:45,125
Spades 2, heart 2,
four of a kind, king.

108
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:47,993
Three tens, no club ten.

109
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:50,126
Three, four, five and six,
one of each.

110
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:51,959
You have been
coughing the whole night.

111
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:55,636
I am allergic to cigar.

112
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:59,000
Nowadays, if you don't like cigar,
then you are not a man.

113
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:02,967
A pair of jack.

114
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:14,187
Three aces.

115
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,251
Stop me now, this is my warning.

116
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:27,767
Straight flush.

117
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:30,204
Are you really this good?

118
00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:32,067
If you can't beat it then pass.

119
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:37,168
Pass.

120
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:40,647
Three threes.

121
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:42,783
Is this for reals?

122
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:49,047
Bad Temper, behave yourself

123
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:50,352
or no one will play with you again.

124
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:51,515
I just fell kind of weird.

125
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:53,990
It is like he can
see through my cards.

126
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:58,265
Want to cut?

127
00:07:58,735 --> 00:07:59,633
Sure!

128
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:10,304
Sorry!

129
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:17,451
Sorry, one second.

130
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:20,645
What is it?

131
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,280
King, it's over.

132
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,349
It's that all?

133
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:26,427
One more thing I want to tell you.

134
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:28,495
Because I think
you have the right to know.

135
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:30,626
I am having your baby.

136
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:33,692
But I will not let you see him.

137
00:08:35,705 --> 00:08:37,900
Do you still want to play? Hurry up.

138
00:08:38,374 --> 00:08:39,466
Don't get so mad.

139
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:40,667
Watch your stupid mouth?

140
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,233
Or I will make you give
all my brothers outside a blow job.

141
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:45,109
Sorry! Begin.

142
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:46,373
Wait.

143
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:48,173
I want to trade cards,
I want to have your cards.

144
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:50,313
Bad Temper, there are no such rules.

145
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:51,747
This is my place,
what are you going to do?

146
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:54,482
Trade!

147
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:16,967
A pair of six.

148
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:25,710
A pair of seven.

149
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:27,654
A pair of jacks.

150
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:31,124
A pair of twos.

151
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,124
Do you have to use
the biggest pair this early?

152
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,526
What do you think?

153
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:35,495
Three aces.

154
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:37,124
How come your cards
are so good tonight?

155
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,497
I don't know.

156
00:09:38,768 --> 00:09:40,668
I was letting you
hit me at a pair of sixes.

157
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,668
But I didn't know
you are this bad luck.

158
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:42,634
Cards please.

159
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:45,031
No more! This is like a magic show.

160
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:46,430
Calm down!

161
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:48,571
I think you should
go have some sex tonight.

162
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:51,712
What? Not you.

163
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:52,937
Look into the mirror!

164
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:54,105
You face looks like a pile of shit.

165
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,441
Hey, give me some respect,
I am a human being too.

166
00:09:56,586 --> 00:09:58,679
To hell with you!
Who do you think you are?

167
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:00,153
You crazy!

168
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:02,656
Take her to the bathroom

169
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:03,951
and tell Hindu guards to rape her.

170
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,558
Sorry, this is it for today.

171
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:15,703
I lost four hundred cards,
this is yours.

172
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:17,762
Yeah!

173
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:48,195
Cut of his hand.

174
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:53,464
Jack!

175
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:58,612
Leave...

176
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:03,950
Close the door!

177
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:10,582
Jack...

178
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:46,289
What did you give me?

179
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,929
What did you inject in me?

180
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:54,697
How come I can't see any color?

181
00:11:55,972 --> 00:11:59,066
Your have seriously
damaged your head.

182
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:03,676
No!

183
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:09,014
You do have rights to remain silent,

184
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:10,444
but anything you say

185
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:12,281
can be used against you in court.

186
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:14,519
We are charging you with murder.

187
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,280
Is Bad Temper dead?

188
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:25,559
What about my brother Jack?

189
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:28,101
Sorry! He lost too much blood,
we can't save him.

190
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:39,944
What about my wife? Where is she?

191
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:42,173
There were no injured female
presented at the scene.

192
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:48,586
No! My wife was there.

193
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,217
My wife was there!

194
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:54,326
My wife was there! Please,
I want to see her!

195
00:12:55,298 --> 00:12:57,391
Calm down... calm down.

196
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:58,964
I will call her for you.

197
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:05,765
I couldn't reach Fanny.

198
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:08,470
From that night on,

199
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:11,545
Fanny seems to have disappeared.

200
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:16,781
None of her relatives
knew where she went.

201
00:13:17,586 --> 00:13:21,886
I was found guilty of murder and
was sentenced to five years in jail.

202
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:27,227
During the time,
Chung came visit me twice.

203
00:13:28,397 --> 00:13:30,888
He also said that
he didn't know where Fanny was.

204
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:35,297
I became a color-blind person.

205
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,540
Everything I see is all in one color.

206
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,608
I understand that

207
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:45,510
if I don't learn something in jail,

208
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:48,644
I will not be able to catch up
to the society when I come out.

209
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:53,482
So I decided to learn something.

210
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:59,391
I learned how to use a computer
to store all horse racing records.

211
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:02,257
I also learned to use a formula
to predict some gambling results.

212
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:06,367
Granny, what's taking so long?

213
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:07,758
What horse should I bet on tonight?

214
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:11,031
Got it! The first race,
number 4,5 and 7.

215
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:12,997
And the second one,
horse number 2, 8, and 12.

216
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:17,335
At last! I realized
something very important,

217
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:19,611
that is, out of ten gambling places,
nine of them are cheaters.

218
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:22,077
In this world, if you don't cheat,

219
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:25,812
you are never guaranteed to win.

220
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:27,745
Open.

221
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:37,990
Five years later

222
00:14:41,237 --> 00:14:44,729
It's good! I lost everything!

223
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:51,536
I am no Dragon!
You got the wrong man.

224
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:55,609
Damn you! You are Dragon,
I know you well, let's go!

225
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,512
Eastwood... please don't get
any closer, you are about to kiss me.

226
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:02,212
Anything's going on?

227
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:04,390
Nope!

228
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,653
Recently I got the arthritis
so I wasn't about to get any news.

229
00:15:06,962 --> 00:15:08,361
Really? Nothing?

230
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:16,267
I heard that Uncle Liang's fellows
are always gathering.

231
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:17,702
Are they making a big deal?

232
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:20,040
Eastwood, I am only a gambler,

233
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:21,268
I am not gangster.

234
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,501
I can tell you tips
on Saturday's race.

235
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:31,785
The 9th race, brother Tat said
the number 8 will win for sure.

236
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:34,814
Who is Tat?

237
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:38,291
Ng Man Tat.

238
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:40,384
Dick head!

239
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:44,298
Nonsense!

240
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,092
Let me tell you,

241
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:47,166
when I call you,
you have to answer at once.

242
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:48,201
Or you will get it.

243
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:50,597
Yes... yes! If you have time
go to Peter's place for a massage,

244
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:51,933
just tell him you are my friend
and you don't have to pay.

245
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:55,509
You dickhead!
I can't stand you anymore.

246
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:57,568
- Get down.
- Why?

247
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:58,644
Get down!

248
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,241
Eastwood, I won't do that?

249
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:05,647
What are you thinking about?

250
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:06,810
Let me tell you,

251
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:08,947
I haven't dealed with you
for using fake money.

252
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:10,455
Do you want me to kill you?

253
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,158
Of course not!

254
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:14,418
Let's do this!

255
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,626
Rabbit jump all the way
to the end of the street.

256
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:21,125
Eastwood, this is a crowded place.

257
00:16:21,237 --> 00:16:23,034
Why don't we find a more quiet place
and I'll jump for you then?

258
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:24,170
Now!

259
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:51,927
Son of a bitch!
If I become rich someday,

260
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:53,193
you will really get it!

261
00:16:56,805 --> 00:16:57,794
Dragon.

262
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,639
Uncle Liang, what's up?

263
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:00,967
What are you doing here?

264
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:04,769
Nothing! My legs are hurting,
I think it's the weather.

265
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,972
I just want to do some exercise.

266
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:07,275
In a crowded place like this?

267
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:10,183
Boss, you know, I like to act.

268
00:17:10,553 --> 00:17:11,451
What's up, boss?

269
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,712
Your hero is getting
out of jail tomorrow!

270
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:14,085
My hero?

271
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:16,747
The big sharper King.
He is coming out of jail tomorrow.

272
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:19,326
He is a famous Sharper...

273
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:20,689
in our field!

274
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:22,596
The man you ever dream for so long!

275
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:24,288
Right...! So?

276
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,694
He is my brother.

277
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:28,361
Tomorrow I'll going to Shenzhen,

278
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:29,435
go pick him up for me.

279
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:30,799
Okay...

280
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:33,702
- Take him for a shower
- Of course...

281
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:35,571
- A good meal.
- Yes...

282
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:37,678
- Then take him to a night club.
- Okay...

283
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:40,008
- Get him a girl.
- Yeah...

284
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:41,376
Hold this.

285
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:45,485
Three hundred dollars?

286
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:46,746
Is not enough?

287
00:17:47,423 --> 00:17:49,914
I call on you
there must be some difficulty.

288
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:53,022
You are a smart man,
you can take care of it.

289
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:57,157
$300?

290
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,066
Do I have to take him
to Grant Hyatt hotel too?

291
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:36,932
Hello, King.

292
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:42,540
Did you call me?

293
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:43,576
You are brother King?

294
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,671
Call me Dragon!

295
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:48,079
Uncle Liang asked me to pick you up.

296
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:49,315
How long have you been here?

297
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:50,416
One hour or so.

298
00:18:52,354 --> 00:18:53,844
Did you see a woman with a kid?

299
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:55,081
It's windy,

300
00:18:55,257 --> 00:18:56,747
I don't think any kids'll come
even his dad is out of jail.

301
00:18:56,892 --> 00:18:58,189
How can there be
a woman carrying a kid?

302
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:00,417
Brother King...

303
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:09,696
Brother King, are you ready?

304
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:14,708
It's cold!
Brother King, are you done?

305
00:19:16,612 --> 00:19:17,806
So, did you find them?

306
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:21,579
It's been so long,
the numbers have been changed.

307
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:24,108
Who are you looking for?

308
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:27,077
My wife.

309
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:29,755
Now you are out of jail.

310
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,949
With your look,
you can get lots of woman.

311
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:33,386
Come, let me take you for a shower

312
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:35,121
and wash away all the bad luck!

313
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:39,466
Good luck to you! Bad luck's gone!

314
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:44,105
All the bad lucks leave at once,
and all the good lucks come now.

315
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,228
Done!

316
00:19:53,182 --> 00:19:55,980
Brother King,
how come you don't have any tattoo?

317
00:19:56,952 --> 00:19:59,750
I am not a gangster, I am a sharper.

318
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:02,580
All the gangster
want everyone to recognize them.

319
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:05,149
As a sharper,
you want no one to recognize you.

320
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:06,316
Right!

321
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:08,354
I thought all the gamblers
are dressed nicely

322
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:09,556
and with their hair jelled.

323
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:13,099
Don't you think acting like that
can win you millions?

324
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:14,400
That is only for movies.

325
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:15,525
Right... only for movies.

326
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:19,366
Brother King, I heard that you are
good at winning lots of money.

327
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:21,701
I am a good sharper.

328
00:20:22,444 --> 00:20:24,139
Can you take me as a trainee?

329
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:26,873
If I teach you,

330
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:28,176
then you will
become one more enemy for me.

331
00:20:28,884 --> 00:20:30,181
Then can I be your assistant?

332
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:34,379
If you can keep your month shut,
I might consider it.

333
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:35,755
Okay!

334
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:40,451
Brother King,
you are really something!

335
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:44,388
Brother King...

336
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:45,464
What?

337
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:46,430
Where are you going?

338
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:47,433
Massage!

339
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,670
Forget it! Those massage girls
will only massage for couple minutes,

340
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:52,033
then they will give you blow jobs.

341
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:54,432
And they will charge you for it too.

342
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:57,203
- Let's go eat, okay?
- Okay.

343
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:06,682
Uncle Liang asked me
to treat you to a great meal.

344
00:21:06,922 --> 00:21:09,322
We have fish and meat here,
I've tried my very best.

345
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:10,719
Come on, eat.

346
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,658
What is it? Do you think I'm cool?

347
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:32,439
Brother King, come on, smile.

348
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:36,143
Lots of my friends
have been into jails before.

349
00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:39,186
But the strongest always survive.

350
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:41,214
You are educated.

351
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:43,153
I always watch
those charity show on TV,

352
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:44,417
I copied their lines.

353
00:21:46,528 --> 00:21:47,517
You really want to help me?

354
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:53,533
Starting tomorrow,
we will make money together.

355
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,870
Yeah! Brother King, that's great.

356
00:21:57,005 --> 00:21:58,302
Are you done!

357
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,032
After this I will take you
to have fun in a karaoke.

358
00:22:00,242 --> 00:22:01,231
Be happy!

359
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:37,711
You sing... quite good.

360
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,871
It's okay, I can't catch up
to some of the beats.

361
00:22:40,582 --> 00:22:42,777
You know,
I always wish to be a good singer.

362
00:22:43,018 --> 00:22:44,815
Everyone in my family
has some singing potential.

363
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,816
Like my sister,

364
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:47,411
her voice can alone attract many men.

365
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,179
Your sister works here?

366
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:50,723
Yes! She is a PR girl here.

367
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:52,057
But she's a fool!

368
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:54,185
She gives her hard earned money
to a dump ass for tuition in America.

369
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:57,523
She is a good girl.

370
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:58,529
I think she is stupid.

371
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,759
Only women spend men's money,

372
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:00,733
how can there be an opposite?

373
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:02,395
I need to go to the bathroom.

374
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:14,907
I didn't ask for girl.

375
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,011
Where is Dragon?

376
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:19,242
He went to the bathroom.

377
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:22,186
You tell him,
I am not going to pay his bill.

378
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:24,347
Are you his sister?

379
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:25,825
Sit.

380
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:26,757
No, thanks.

381
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:28,985
I haven't seen you before.

382
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:31,431
Your brother just took me in.

383
00:23:33,335 --> 00:23:35,929
You seem like a nice man, but don't
mess around with my brother,

384
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:37,430
because he will bring you down.

385
00:23:39,074 --> 00:23:41,372
- Don't smoke too much.
- You are not young, man.

386
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:52,012
No... Rocky baby, be careful.

387
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,018
No... stop.
I don't want to do like this.

388
00:23:55,757 --> 00:23:56,746
Neck bridge.

389
00:23:57,492 --> 00:23:59,983
No... Rocky baby.

390
00:24:01,063 --> 00:24:03,054
No... please stop!

391
00:24:07,502 --> 00:24:09,402
Come on, Kimmy, come down.

392
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:15,503
Rocky baby,

393
00:24:15,644 --> 00:24:17,839
you don't have to treat
my sisters like this.

394
00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:23,676
I only care about you.

395
00:24:24,186 --> 00:24:25,483
I am not interested in sex.

396
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:27,249
You will only be disappointed.

397
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:30,490
I don't mind,
let me have the disappointment.

398
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,659
You are always like this.

399
00:24:33,528 --> 00:24:35,018
How dare you hit me? Bitch!

400
00:24:35,731 --> 00:24:37,221
Rocky baby, you want to have fun,

401
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:39,094
I will get you the right girl.

402
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:42,226
Ching Ching cries easily,
she can't handle it.

403
00:24:42,404 --> 00:24:45,100
Shut your hole and
get out of my face! Now!

404
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:46,699
Get her out of here.

405
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:48,305
Out!

406
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:50,536
Then... Ching Ching,
don't make Rocky baby mad again.

407
00:24:50,712 --> 00:24:52,304
Let's play the guessing game.

408
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,483
Okay, I will play with you.

409
00:24:56,918 --> 00:24:59,716
Fine! If you lose,
you have to go with me.

410
00:24:59,821 --> 00:25:01,721
But if you lose you have to leave.

411
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:03,022
Okay, fine.

412
00:25:04,393 --> 00:25:06,190
What is wrong with you,

413
00:25:06,294 --> 00:25:07,283
why the rush?

414
00:25:07,396 --> 00:25:09,694
Dragon, your sister is in trouble!

415
00:25:09,898 --> 00:25:10,990
Are you sure? Who?

416
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:12,396
It's Rocky!

417
00:25:13,568 --> 00:25:14,865
This guy is an animal.

418
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,569
He wants to screw
your sister tonight,

419
00:25:16,672 --> 00:25:17,764
what are we going to do?

420
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,830
Let's call the cops.
Is this a good idea?

421
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:20,839
Cops?

422
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:22,101
Who is calling the police?
Did someone get hit by a car?

423
00:25:22,277 --> 00:25:23,869
No! My sister is in deep trouble.

424
00:25:24,513 --> 00:25:25,411
Really?

425
00:25:25,547 --> 00:25:26,946
That jerk is a well-known gangster.

426
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:27,945
He has hundreds of fellows.

427
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:29,105
He fights like a hero.

428
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:30,843
Woman touches his pillow
will end up a sorrow...

429
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:32,247
Are you a poet now?

430
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:34,912
Stop messing around,
what are we going to do now?

431
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:37,517
Open the door!

432
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,655
Slut, you lost? Open the door.

433
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:41,785
Hey man,

434
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,023
the stick is for pool,
not for you to bang at the door.

435
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:45,422
Who the hell are you?

436
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:47,766
Who are you?

437
00:25:48,003 --> 00:25:49,994
Oh is Dragon,
what are you trying to do?

438
00:25:50,205 --> 00:25:52,503
She is a PR girl and she is supposed
to sleep with customers.

439
00:25:52,674 --> 00:25:54,073
In my eyes,

440
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:55,641
I can sleep with
all the girls in this world.

441
00:25:55,811 --> 00:25:58,109
You are night,

442
00:25:58,246 --> 00:25:59,338
all the girls in this world
can have sex with,

443
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:01,348
but is either with you or me!

444
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:04,315
White head, what is your problems?

445
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,320
Do you want to get your ass kicked?

446
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:09,522
Someone told me before that

447
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:11,421
you are good at pool,

448
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:12,925
why don't we play a game?

449
00:26:13,595 --> 00:26:15,392
Do you know that I always play...

450
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,622
with Hong Kong's Pool King before?

451
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:18,593
Me too! But how come
I've never seen you before?

452
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,362
Let's play a game,

453
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,165
if I win I will take Ching Ching.

454
00:26:23,305 --> 00:26:24,795
But if I lose you get to have here.

455
00:26:24,906 --> 00:26:25,895
And an extra
thirty thousand dollars bet.

456
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:26,939
Really?

457
00:26:27,075 --> 00:26:28,167
Okay! Don't move!

458
00:26:30,378 --> 00:26:31,675
We don't have
thirty thousand dollars!

459
00:26:31,813 --> 00:26:32,905
I really don't have
thirty thousand dollars!

460
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:35,343
Don't mess with him then.

461
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,847
I am a little scared too,
let's go then.

462
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:38,849
I don't care, you have to continue.

463
00:26:39,254 --> 00:26:40,243
I break!

464
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:41,377
You don't have to yell!

465
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:55,461
Be careful!

466
00:26:56,772 --> 00:26:58,364
It went in! You're a pain in my ass.

467
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:00,139
Damn I am lucky!

468
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,322
Yes!

469
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:30,369
Pay up.

470
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:35,741
Bastard! Act all stupid,
watch your back.

471
00:27:36,812 --> 00:27:37,710
Thanks.

472
00:27:38,513 --> 00:27:40,003
No more pool from now on, let's go!

473
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:43,843
Bye.

474
00:27:44,653 --> 00:27:47,952
Come on out, sister,
I am your brother!

475
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:49,948
You don't have to peep, it's me.

476
00:27:51,426 --> 00:27:52,324
Thanks.

477
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:53,893
Give it to me,
I will keep it for you.

478
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:58,963
I need to find somewhere to stay.

479
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:01,768
I have an extra room in my house.

480
00:28:02,904 --> 00:28:03,893
What, thirty thousand dollars
for a room?

481
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,536
It's a long rent payment.

482
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:15,005
I was going to put
this room up for rent,

483
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:16,515
but my boyfriend
doesn't like the idea,

484
00:28:16,685 --> 00:28:17,982
so it became a store room.

485
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:20,384
Sister, I am interested
in this room too.

486
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:22,780
Get out?

487
00:28:24,593 --> 00:28:26,185
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

488
00:28:26,561 --> 00:28:28,461
I want to get something straight.

489
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,528
Okay.

490
00:28:29,698 --> 00:28:31,188
I have a fiance, his name is Raymond.

491
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,733
He is studying in America.

492
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:35,761
I only have him in my heart.

493
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:38,402
I rather be a PR girl

494
00:28:38,506 --> 00:28:39,996
so I can help him finish his study.

495
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:44,375
I let you stay here
is because of your money.

496
00:28:44,946 --> 00:28:47,244
So please don't have
any idea that included me in it.

497
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:50,111
Besides, we have
a huge age difference.

498
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:53,881
Let me tell you something.

499
00:28:55,357 --> 00:28:58,451
I have a wife before I went to jail,

500
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:00,126
her name is Fanny, she's very nice.

501
00:29:00,962 --> 00:29:02,361
She gave birth to my kid.

502
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:05,929
I regret so much that I didn't took
care of her when I have the chance.

503
00:29:06,668 --> 00:29:09,068
After I got out of jail
I totally lost contact with her.

504
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:11,766
I haven't even looked at
my kid's face one time.

505
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:15,973
But my point is that
I only have them in my heart.

506
00:29:16,111 --> 00:29:17,305
So relax,

507
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:19,538
I will not have any fantasy
that includes you in it.

508
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:20,770
That settles it.

509
00:29:23,518 --> 00:29:25,918
Why don't you
let your brother stay here?

510
00:29:26,054 --> 00:29:26,952
I will take care of him.

511
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:36,827
In Hong Kong, people bet most of
money on football and horse races

512
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,494
- Let me teach you bet on horses.
- Alright.

513
00:29:43,438 --> 00:29:44,837
Master, the 9th race
is about to start now.

514
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:48,298
The last two horses
are about to enter the barrier.

515
00:29:49,611 --> 00:29:51,511
One left now, hurry.

516
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,242
Which one should we bet on?

517
00:29:59,988 --> 00:30:03,890
Hung's Restaurant? 2 Won Ton noodles
and a plate of vegetable.

518
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:07,518
4/F, number 34 and room A, thanks.

519
00:30:08,863 --> 00:30:09,852
I thought you were
going to bet, didn't you?

520
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:12,593
We wasted so much time

521
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:13,928
and you didn't bet a penny, why?

522
00:30:14,102 --> 00:30:15,592
I don't have the confidence
so why should I bet?

523
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:19,706
The trainer bet
less than ten races a season.

524
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:21,934
If you bet on every race, you'll be
broke even if you are Bill Gates.

525
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,407
This is boring.

526
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,377
You want to be a happy loser
or a boring winner?

527
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,850
You are the master,
I will listen to you.

528
00:30:33,088 --> 00:30:34,385
We will do it again next week.

529
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:36,486
Record all the race results

530
00:30:36,591 --> 00:30:37,489
and we will study that later.

531
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,262
Master, we are gambling,
not going to school.

532
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:44,892
Nothing comes easily!

533
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:47,691
I don't think
Won Ton noodle will do it,

534
00:30:47,936 --> 00:30:50,131
let's go out and eat, okay?

535
00:30:50,739 --> 00:30:52,730
Okay, I will take you
to a place which is free.

536
00:30:53,008 --> 00:30:53,906
Let's go!

537
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:55,765
I thought it will be a good meal!

538
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:57,808
This is not good enough?

539
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:01,614
We will have shark fins later,
now we will have crab meat noodle.

540
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:08,979
Waiter, bring me
another glass of orange juice.

541
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,457
Do you know that fellow?

542
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:16,128
No really. But I am
very good friend with his wife.

543
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:19,860
Did you give them a red pocket?

544
00:31:21,136 --> 00:31:23,036
Of course,

545
00:31:23,204 --> 00:31:24,398
I put a deck of newspaper
in the red envelope.

546
00:31:25,273 --> 00:31:26,467
What if they find out?

547
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:29,099
It's in the red envelope!
Who will know who did it?

548
00:31:33,481 --> 00:31:36,678
Sir, your check is
one hundred and forty dollars.

549
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,813
What? I am a guest.

550
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:42,181
The order is that...

551
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:45,384
juice and noodles
will be paid by the guests.

552
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:46,391
I will kick your ass.

553
00:31:46,628 --> 00:31:47,720
Stop!

554
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:49,261
- Let me kick his ass!
- Pay.

555
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:51,359
I won't teach you anything
if you won't pay the bill.

556
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:56,526
Pay... Hurry.

557
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,131
Sorry... Sorry.

558
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:03,168
- Kick you ass!
- Thanks... Thanks.

559
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:05,869
Let me tell you, you asked for it.

560
00:32:06,748 --> 00:32:07,646
Sit.

561
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:12,084
No, I want to make some money.

562
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:15,388
Don't do it here,

563
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,787
there are lots of
sharpers making money here.

564
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:20,054
Eat. Come on.

565
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:24,557
Brother King.

566
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:28,058
You are a sharper too,
why are you acting like a gentleman?

567
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:31,268
There are eight
different kinds of sharpers.

568
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:35,501
Master, provider, beauty, liar, informer,
warrior, negotiator and gossipmonger.

569
00:32:35,743 --> 00:32:37,438
Total 8 kinds of sharpers.

570
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:40,203
I am the master
and I do it for a living.

571
00:32:41,683 --> 00:32:42,775
What about the other seven kinds?

572
00:32:45,086 --> 00:32:47,384
Provider's job is to set up the trap.

573
00:32:47,989 --> 00:32:49,786
Beauty's job is to
use beauty to trick a man.

574
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:52,790
Liar's job is to disappear
after his job is done.

575
00:32:53,294 --> 00:32:54,886
Informer's job
is to gather information.

576
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,830
Warrior's job is to
take care of the dirty works.

577
00:32:58,366 --> 00:32:59,560
Negotiator's job is to negotiate.

578
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:01,896
Gossipmonger...

579
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,664
to produce rumors so
somebody will be easily cheated.

580
00:33:05,206 --> 00:33:06,503
You make it sounds...

581
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:07,868
like mission impossible.

582
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:08,838
Right.

583
00:33:09,978 --> 00:33:10,876
Eat.

584
00:33:15,383 --> 00:33:16,281
What are they playing?

585
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:18,207
Shoot the gap.

586
00:33:19,454 --> 00:33:21,752
You will get two cards at first.

587
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,790
Say you get an ace and a ten.

588
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:27,293
If the third card you get is between
ace and a ten then you win.

589
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:28,918
But if you get J, Q, K then you lose.

590
00:33:29,364 --> 00:33:31,662
But if the third card
is an ace or a ten,

591
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:32,822
that is called hitting the post.

592
00:33:33,268 --> 00:33:34,257
You will lost double.

593
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:36,601
Are you done?

594
00:33:38,273 --> 00:33:39,262
Let's go then!

595
00:33:39,507 --> 00:33:41,907
I don't want people to find out your
red envelope when we are still here.

596
00:33:42,243 --> 00:33:44,734
Bet big and you can will big...
there are lots of money on the table.

597
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:48,611
Dragon, come on,
play couple of hands.

598
00:33:50,185 --> 00:33:51,277
Come on.

599
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:55,154
Let's win back
the one hundred and forty dollars.

600
00:33:57,325 --> 00:33:58,314
I called you many times!

601
00:33:58,459 --> 00:33:59,551
There are over $20,000 on the table.

602
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:02,018
Deal it.

603
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,026
Okay.

604
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:09,130
You want to donate money to me?

605
00:34:12,574 --> 00:34:13,768
How come you have so much money?

606
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:14,967
My personal saving.

607
00:34:15,944 --> 00:34:16,740
I will bet five thousand dollars.

608
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:17,776
No more bets.

609
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:22,941
Here comes...

610
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:27,044
You hit the post!

611
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:28,883
You lose double, give me $5,000 more.

612
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,487
Have you learned
your lesson yet? Let's go.

613
00:34:30,758 --> 00:34:34,455
Brother, you look good today!
Play a hand.

614
00:34:34,662 --> 00:34:36,061
No... Sorry.

615
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:37,461
You can always win the money.

616
00:34:40,835 --> 00:34:42,325
There are something wrong
with all 52 cards,

617
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,764
you can't win!

618
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:44,836
What do you mean?

619
00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:47,397
He marked all the cards.

620
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:51,204
Look at him, his whole head
is loaded with hair jell.

621
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:53,443
He put some of that on the cards,

622
00:34:54,215 --> 00:34:57,309
and he will know what the cards
are by its reflections.

623
00:34:58,553 --> 00:34:59,542
How does he know?

624
00:35:00,488 --> 00:35:04,891
Normally, all sharpers
mark their cards with 40 squares.

625
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,354
4 rows across for the shapes
and 10 rows down for aces to 10.

626
00:35:09,364 --> 00:35:13,664
If two sides of rows have reflections
then it's a J, the short rows are Q.

627
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:15,760
No reflection means K.

628
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:20,139
Also, he is always
dealing from the second card.

629
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:22,539
He deals every hand
from the second card.

630
00:35:23,244 --> 00:35:26,236
He puts the ace on top for emergency.

631
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,816
That son of a bitch!
I stupidly lost ten thousand dollars.

632
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,917
So what? That was your choice.

633
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:38,450
You want to win it back?

634
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:40,025
Let's go.

635
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:42,790
But he is a cop!

636
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:44,864
So? Give me the money.

637
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,759
One thousand dollars!

638
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:57,138
That is all I have... I only have
two thousand dollars left.

639
00:35:57,278 --> 00:35:59,473
If we lost it
we will have no money for bus...

640
00:35:59,681 --> 00:36:00,773
Can you make it?

641
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:01,711
Go take the bus then.

642
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:04,941
Okay... Okay! Give it a chance...

643
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:09,385
- I want to play a hand.
- Okay.

644
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:11,947
Here!

645
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:14,693
Yeah!

646
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:15,694
The second card!

647
00:36:16,397 --> 00:36:17,489
Yeah!

648
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:23,331
4 and a 9? If I have a 5, 6, 7 and 8,
then I will win, right?

649
00:36:24,372 --> 00:36:26,067
Whatever, dump ass!

650
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,802
I want to bet
all the money on the table.

651
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:32,373
There are thirty thousand dollars!

652
00:36:34,082 --> 00:36:35,276
Okay... that's good.

653
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,044
I really want to bet
all the money on the table.

654
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:39,380
You sure?

655
00:36:40,288 --> 00:36:41,186
Deal it.

656
00:36:43,758 --> 00:36:47,250
I bet so big,
can I pick my own card?

657
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:48,927
Okay.

658
00:36:57,805 --> 00:36:59,397
Yeah!

659
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:00,839
Pay up!

660
00:37:02,543 --> 00:37:04,033
- Dick head, what are you doing?
- What's the matter?

661
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:09,079
Let me tell you, next time
when you cheat, do it better.

662
00:37:09,384 --> 00:37:10,578
Don't let others catch your mistakes.

663
00:37:11,652 --> 00:37:13,745
There are lots of people here.

664
00:37:16,824 --> 00:37:17,916
You win.

665
00:37:19,494 --> 00:37:20,586
Let him go.

666
00:37:22,663 --> 00:37:24,563
Read carefully the man's face.
The one who comes with Dragon.

667
00:37:24,966 --> 00:37:26,365
After the dinner is over,
go catch him.

668
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:27,831
Let me cut off
every fingers on his hands.

669
00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:28,900
I want to go to the bathroom.

670
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:35,501
I will go alone...

671
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,273
It's very fat.

672
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:41,676
Really? You like it fat?

673
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:45,375
Then I will let you taste it!
You like it fat, right?

674
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,217
Why do you think it's fat?

675
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:50,147
It should be called "Dynamic".

676
00:38:16,818 --> 00:38:18,012
Who uses newspaper as a handsel?

677
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:20,478
Damn it! Who did this?

678
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:23,120
You really received newspaper?

679
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:23,987
How did you know?

680
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,116
A cop in the toilet was saying that

681
00:38:26,294 --> 00:38:28,285
he used newspaper as a handsel.

682
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:30,186
What a bastard!

683
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:31,387
If I were you I would kick his ass.

684
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,997
- Kick his ass!
- Kick his ass!

685
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:36,164
- Who is a cop here?
- I am.

686
00:38:37,638 --> 00:38:40,436
Help... you are assaulting a cop!

687
00:38:45,713 --> 00:38:48,113
Let me tell you,
don't let me see them again.

688
00:38:48,216 --> 00:38:50,013
I will kill them, let's go!

689
00:38:55,923 --> 00:38:58,221
Are you crazy?
How can you afford these many girls?

690
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:00,559
We won lots of money
at the wedding feast.

691
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:01,889
So we decided
to come here for a little fun.

692
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:03,824
I am really going to pay today.

693
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:08,996
Right! Thanks.

694
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:12,631
No way! I called on you for so long
and you finally show up now.

695
00:39:13,074 --> 00:39:15,269
I was taking care of
some important customers.

696
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,304
A man from Macau was treating
a group of friends from Taiwan.

697
00:39:18,412 --> 00:39:19,504
They just left.

698
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:22,113
What man from Macau?

699
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,346
Mamasan said that he is
very powerful, his name is Macau Mon.

700
00:39:25,486 --> 00:39:26,976
Stop acting! Pay up.

701
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:33,777
http://dapatfilmgratis.blogspot.com

702
00:39:34,161 --> 00:39:36,459
Just give tonight's check to me.

703
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:47,165
Come back again.

704
00:40:03,157 --> 00:40:04,249
Is Macau Mon.

705
00:40:05,192 --> 00:40:06,090
You know him?

706
00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:08,422
Who doesn't know him?
He is the true sharper.

707
00:40:08,496 --> 00:40:10,293
He controls Hong Kong, Macau

708
00:40:10,398 --> 00:40:11,797
with all the horse racing
and soccer matches betting,

709
00:40:11,966 --> 00:40:13,160
and the underground Index market too!

710
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:16,099
He has a nickname, "Shenzhen Soros".

711
00:40:16,203 --> 00:40:17,295
He will beat you no matter what.

712
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,633
I wanted to challenge him
five years ago,

713
00:40:20,775 --> 00:40:22,675
but he was always in Macau.

714
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:24,037
Now he mainly lives in Hong Kong.

715
00:40:24,211 --> 00:40:25,610
And his fellows
work everything in Shenzhen.

716
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,279
After the World Cup,

717
00:40:27,415 --> 00:40:28,609
he'd win more than
one thousand millions.

718
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:30,511
- One thousand millions?
- Right.

719
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:32,077
If I have that much,

720
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:34,684
I will trade it
for my son and my wife.

721
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,579
You're still thinking of
your wife, aren't you?

722
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:40,383
This place is as big as a town,
how can we find him?

723
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:42,353
Are you sure is here?

724
00:40:42,663 --> 00:40:46,258
Who put your brother
Jack's remains here?

725
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:49,198
One of my brothers,
his name is Chung.

726
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:53,506
At the beginning of my jail time,
he did come visit me.

727
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:55,035
But now he disappeared also.

728
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:56,968
He told me it's around here.

729
00:40:57,578 --> 00:40:58,875
Is that it?

730
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,119
Looks like someone
has been here a while ago?

731
00:41:14,362 --> 00:41:15,659
- What?
- I will be back.

732
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,262
What is it, master?

733
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:26,400
Did you see your wife?

734
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:28,533
Maybe!

735
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:30,037
She was carrying a kid

736
00:41:30,144 --> 00:41:31,236
and I think that is my son.

737
00:41:31,746 --> 00:41:32,542
Calm down, master!

738
00:41:32,747 --> 00:41:34,339
I spend your money with you
and I will find your kid for you.

739
00:41:34,548 --> 00:41:35,537
What are you talking about?

740
00:41:36,384 --> 00:41:37,783
Maybe I am mistaken of someone else.

741
00:41:37,885 --> 00:41:40,183
A woman with a kid
can't walk this fast.

742
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:42,778
But someone has been here.

743
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:43,982
Maybe someone who is kind.

744
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:46,423
Forget it, I want to look around.

745
00:41:47,028 --> 00:41:48,825
Okay! Go look around.

746
00:41:57,838 --> 00:41:59,237
Master,

747
00:41:59,373 --> 00:42:00,271
I just saw a woman
with a kid up there.

748
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:01,602
- Really?
- Wait.

749
00:42:01,742 --> 00:42:03,437
Does your wife
have a breast this big?

750
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:05,108
No! I don't think
that is the one then.

751
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:07,237
But you have to go take a look! Her
breasts are too big to be true.

752
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,547
You are very nasty!

753
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,623
King, 2 minutes left, but
the spread's still changing big time.

754
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:26,358
Big bets on number five,

755
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:28,958
you can see it's raising rapidly.

756
00:42:30,204 --> 00:42:32,001
The dividend is from
ninety down to seventy.

757
00:42:32,106 --> 00:42:35,007
Right! We have been sitting here for
three days and we haven't bet a dime.

758
00:42:51,425 --> 00:42:56,021
Account 1123794, code 217377.

759
00:42:57,832 --> 00:43:00,426
Second race, two thousand dollars
on number five as winner.

760
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:03,702
$2,000 on quinella, number five
with number seven, eight and twelve.

761
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:25,789
At the finish, first place number 5,
second place number 8,

762
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,257
third place number 7...

763
00:43:29,063 --> 00:43:30,155
We won!

764
00:43:30,765 --> 00:43:32,562
The winner is horse number five.

765
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,190
Winner pays $935.5,

766
00:43:34,335 --> 00:43:35,529
place pays
one hundred forty six dollars.

767
00:43:35,669 --> 00:43:38,661
The second one is
horse number eight, the place pays...

768
00:43:39,406 --> 00:43:41,806
Master, we won
seven hundred thousand dollars!

769
00:43:45,312 --> 00:43:46,711
What's wrong, aren't you happy?

770
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:48,670
It's only
seven hundred thousand dollars.

771
00:43:49,283 --> 00:43:50,477
If you win seventy million dollars,
what are you going to do?

772
00:43:54,288 --> 00:43:55,482
We won so much money,
what should we do tonight?

773
00:43:55,689 --> 00:43:56,678
What do you think?

774
00:43:56,824 --> 00:43:57,620
Let's have a good meal?

775
00:43:57,758 --> 00:44:00,352
We will pay for this meal, okay?

776
00:44:03,898 --> 00:44:04,887
Hello.

777
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:07,163
Hello.

778
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:09,997
Brother King,
this is my brotherfriend Raymond.

779
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:11,360
Hello, brother King.

780
00:44:13,307 --> 00:44:14,604
This is my brother Dragon,
remember him?

781
00:44:14,842 --> 00:44:15,831
Yes.

782
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:18,136
You guys are betting on horse racing?
Sorry to bother you.

783
00:44:18,479 --> 00:44:19,468
Don't worry! You already did!

784
00:44:20,414 --> 00:44:21,813
- Sit.
- Thanks.

785
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:24,612
Raymond is on summer vacation.

786
00:44:24,885 --> 00:44:26,682
Which college are you studying?

787
00:44:27,254 --> 00:44:29,154
Princeton University.

788
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:33,258
I am also going to college too,
Fu Kin University!

789
00:44:33,427 --> 00:44:35,327
Fukin U! How do you do?

790
00:44:35,563 --> 00:44:37,155
Behave.

791
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:40,759
Excuse me, I am going to
exercise my stomach.

792
00:44:40,868 --> 00:44:44,565
To dump all the waste and
other unnecessary items in my body.

793
00:44:45,306 --> 00:44:46,295
What do you mean?

794
00:44:46,607 --> 00:44:49,303
To take a shit! College student!

795
00:44:55,649 --> 00:44:57,549
Don't mind him! He is weird.

796
00:44:58,419 --> 00:45:00,011
Don't worry!
He is just joking around.

797
00:45:06,393 --> 00:45:07,792
- Raymond, right?
- Yes.

798
00:45:08,796 --> 00:45:10,286
How much longer before you graduate?

799
00:45:10,397 --> 00:45:11,591
April next year.

800
00:45:12,066 --> 00:45:14,660
Then I will get to see
Ching everyday.

801
00:45:14,902 --> 00:45:15,994
We don't have to
write letters anymore.

802
00:45:17,271 --> 00:45:19,171
You can use e-mail.

803
00:45:19,506 --> 00:45:21,599
No! She hates computer.

804
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:23,776
Yes! I am not very good at computer.

805
00:45:24,311 --> 00:45:26,506
I taught your brother already,
he can help you.

806
00:45:26,847 --> 00:45:27,939
My brother?

807
00:45:30,784 --> 00:45:31,978
How about this, I will help you.

808
00:45:32,152 --> 00:45:34,950
Write your e-mail address
on this paper.

809
00:45:36,824 --> 00:45:37,813
Maybe later.

810
00:45:41,362 --> 00:45:44,354
I think there is
something wrong with that guy.

811
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:48,091
That slut face?
I am going to beat him up someday.

812
00:45:48,235 --> 00:45:49,725
I don't know why
my sister likes him so much.

813
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:52,995
I don't think
he is a college student.

814
00:45:54,008 --> 00:45:54,997
Are you sure?

815
00:45:55,175 --> 00:45:57,370
My sister sends him
money every month for tuition.

816
00:45:57,845 --> 00:45:58,834
Is there any proof?

817
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,769
No!

818
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:02,845
I think he is using your sister.

819
00:46:04,752 --> 00:46:05,741
Are you sure?

820
00:46:05,953 --> 00:46:07,443
Really! I tested him earlier,

821
00:46:07,755 --> 00:46:10,155
I asked him
does he have an e-mail account,

822
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:11,916
and I can tell by his expression
that he has no clue about e-mail.

823
00:46:12,493 --> 00:46:13,983
The students in America
is not like that.

824
00:46:14,461 --> 00:46:15,450
Really?

825
00:46:15,796 --> 00:46:16,888
What is his full name?

826
00:46:17,498 --> 00:46:19,090
Raymond Chou,

827
00:46:20,634 --> 00:46:22,124
I am going to call
Princeton University

828
00:46:22,336 --> 00:46:23,530
and check it out.

829
00:46:23,637 --> 00:46:25,628
Okay! I will pay for the phone bill.

830
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,132
If he lies to my sister,

831
00:46:27,308 --> 00:46:28,798
he will get it.

832
00:46:38,052 --> 00:46:38,950
Angela.

833
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:43,121
Hello! I miss you very much.

834
00:46:47,728 --> 00:46:50,026
Nice car! Let me drive it, okay?

835
00:46:50,297 --> 00:46:51,195
Where are we going?

836
00:46:51,398 --> 00:46:53,593
Up to you. Let's go.

837
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:58,661
You little son of a bitch!

838
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:02,434
My lord! How can he
go out with an old slut?

839
00:47:03,877 --> 00:47:05,071
I feel sorry for my sister...

840
00:47:05,813 --> 00:47:06,609
Shit.

841
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:14,286
Son of a bitch!
What an old sluts gigolo!

842
00:47:19,226 --> 00:47:20,318
Watch you back!

843
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:21,655
- Bye.
- Bye.

844
00:47:24,732 --> 00:47:25,721
Bye.

845
00:47:27,668 --> 00:47:28,464
Sorry!

846
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:30,230
Watch it buddy!

847
00:47:47,688 --> 00:47:49,679
Hey man! You want my ass to?

848
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:53,189
Go get yourself some drugs.
Get the hell out of my face!

849
00:47:54,428 --> 00:47:55,326
Leave!

850
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,294
Not a bad gigolo!

851
00:48:03,437 --> 00:48:04,631
Does he have time
to go to the bathroom?

852
00:48:05,472 --> 00:48:07,565
Look like it's not bad
to be a gigolo.

853
00:48:10,244 --> 00:48:13,236
What's wrong?
You don't seem happy today.

854
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:16,376
I can't see you for six months
after I go back to America,

855
00:48:16,517 --> 00:48:17,506
how can I be happy?

856
00:48:18,952 --> 00:48:21,045
You can call me.

857
00:48:21,288 --> 00:48:24,780
No! The telephone is too expensive.

858
00:48:25,893 --> 00:48:27,690
But I am planning to

859
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:29,351
open a comic book store in America.

860
00:48:29,997 --> 00:48:31,089
I just want to make some money.

861
00:48:31,665 --> 00:48:33,462
But everyone has to put in
twenty thousand US dollars.

862
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:35,700
Then it will be one hundred
fifty thousand HK dollars?

863
00:48:37,404 --> 00:48:39,804
Don't worry!
I will take care of that.

864
00:48:40,674 --> 00:48:44,075
Ching, I owe you too much.

865
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:45,708
I didn't say you have to pay me back.

866
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,075
Tell them you are in,
I will take care of the rest.

867
00:48:49,249 --> 00:48:51,740
Ching, you treat me too good.

868
00:48:53,821 --> 00:48:55,015
I feel that I owe you a lot!

869
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,850
Ching, you have a new boyfriend?

870
00:49:03,363 --> 00:49:04,261
What are you talking about?

871
00:49:04,465 --> 00:49:05,363
Where is the pool player boyfriend?

872
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:06,793
Rocky baby, stop fooling around.

873
00:49:07,201 --> 00:49:07,997
Why?

874
00:49:08,135 --> 00:49:10,035
Tell this slut face
to go kick his ass, go!

875
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:14,005
Ching, who is he?

876
00:49:16,343 --> 00:49:18,243
- Let's go.
- Okay.

877
00:49:22,716 --> 00:49:24,013
Are you leaving, Raymond?

878
00:49:24,852 --> 00:49:25,944
Hello.

879
00:49:26,019 --> 00:49:27,111
You told me to come.

880
00:49:27,254 --> 00:49:28,152
I told you to come?

881
00:49:30,157 --> 00:49:33,752
I am her fiance,
call me Ching, you are...

882
00:49:34,862 --> 00:49:37,660
I don't care you go out with little
girls, but why call me to come?

883
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:41,464
Who are you?

884
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:43,459
He is my little gigolo.

885
00:49:45,672 --> 00:49:46,661
Is this true?

886
00:49:47,841 --> 00:49:49,638
Oh, no! Volcano is erupting!

887
00:49:51,345 --> 00:49:53,336
Raymond,
you better explain this to me.

888
00:49:55,315 --> 00:49:56,509
The reason I asked you to come...

889
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,944
so you can see me
telling her the truth.

890
00:49:58,418 --> 00:50:00,613
Ching, I can't stay with you anymore.

891
00:50:01,188 --> 00:50:02,280
I love Angela.

892
00:50:09,129 --> 00:50:10,323
Raymond, what are you talking about?

893
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:12,931
He's just told you that
he's never been to America.

894
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:14,031
The letters he sent you...

895
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:15,531
were first sent to
America to his friends,

896
00:50:15,702 --> 00:50:16,896
and then his friends
posted them back to you.

897
00:50:17,004 --> 00:50:18,699
White head is here, get to work.

898
00:50:19,706 --> 00:50:20,695
Is this truth?

899
00:50:21,341 --> 00:50:22,330
So what?

900
00:50:23,577 --> 00:50:25,875
And earlier you told me to give you
twenty thousand US dollars.

901
00:50:27,414 --> 00:50:28,904
- Raymond, let's go.
- Okay.

902
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:39,957
Let me do this.

903
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:03,405
You bitch, go to hell!

904
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:07,142
How dare you trick my sister?

905
00:51:34,982 --> 00:51:38,474
Stop...

906
00:51:57,437 --> 00:51:58,927
Don't trust those people again.

907
00:51:59,273 --> 00:52:01,264
No more... I won't trust him anymore.

908
00:52:02,242 --> 00:52:03,231
Good.

909
00:52:04,945 --> 00:52:07,436
Brother King, don't die! I am sorry.

910
00:52:07,614 --> 00:52:10,014
That's enough! Stop vomiting.

911
00:52:10,117 --> 00:52:11,209
The blood is sweet, swallow it.

912
00:52:11,385 --> 00:52:12,977
Why didn't you tell me
a car is added?

913
00:52:13,153 --> 00:52:14,245
You almost scared me to death.

914
00:52:14,388 --> 00:52:15,184
Enough!

915
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:16,381
Can't you tell her the truth later?

916
00:52:16,556 --> 00:52:17,853
Why can't you let
an old people rest a little more?

917
00:52:30,137 --> 00:52:32,435
Don't go out with
that slut face anymore.

918
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,640
I won't!

919
00:52:36,176 --> 00:52:38,167
I don't think
you can see him anymore.

920
00:52:38,378 --> 00:52:40,676
With this situation,
he is on his way back to China.

921
00:52:41,615 --> 00:52:43,708
How come he is in it too?

922
00:52:43,884 --> 00:52:45,681
You didn't know brother King
took me in as a student?

923
00:52:45,819 --> 00:52:47,719
- He teaches me to play pool.
- That's nothing.

924
00:52:47,854 --> 00:52:49,549
I am about to become
third best in Hong Kong.

925
00:52:53,327 --> 00:52:54,726
Is he really scared?

926
00:52:55,862 --> 00:52:57,659
I don't think he's gone to far.

927
00:52:58,131 --> 00:52:59,723
Skinny Dragon...

928
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:03,163
The slut face hid in China
and had plastic surgery.

929
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:04,259
Now when the wind blows,

930
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:05,768
his face will come apart,

931
00:53:05,872 --> 00:53:06,668
I think this isn't enough.

932
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,230
I printed a fake paper
about King's death.

933
00:53:08,342 --> 00:53:10,333
It scared the shit
out of him and he fled to Cambodia.

934
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:12,103
Where is brother King?

935
00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:13,769
Master? He is in
deep thoughts right now.

936
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,780
- Brother King.
- Master.

937
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:18,407
- He is looking for you.
- What's up.

938
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,209
Sit, brother King.

939
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:23,612
I went to the gambling boat yesterday
and lost couple hundred thousands.

940
00:53:23,824 --> 00:53:25,314
You are ill-fated.

941
00:53:25,592 --> 00:53:27,082
I guess that ship is haunted,

942
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,352
I have lots 3 consecutive times.

943
00:53:28,495 --> 00:53:29,689
I lost almost
over two million dollars.

944
00:53:29,796 --> 00:53:30,888
Let me look at your palm.

945
00:53:32,366 --> 00:53:34,266
It's all messed up! Take a rest.

946
00:53:34,468 --> 00:53:39,064
No way? Brother King,
I want you to help me.

947
00:53:39,439 --> 00:53:40,235
No.

948
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,934
Master, go win some money.

949
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:46,404
Then we can hire ten private eyes
to look for your wife.

950
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,569
We can go gamble for you!

951
00:53:47,714 --> 00:53:48,908
But we'll get half the gains and
you'll handle all the loses.

952
00:53:48,982 --> 00:53:49,880
Agree?

953
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:51,949
Forget it then, master, let's go.

954
00:53:52,085 --> 00:53:53,177
Okay! No problem!

955
00:53:53,353 --> 00:53:54,251
Sure?

956
00:53:55,055 --> 00:53:57,649
I'll take control on the ship

957
00:53:57,758 --> 00:53:58,850
and keep your voice down, understand?

958
00:53:58,925 --> 00:53:59,914
Of course!

959
00:54:01,361 --> 00:54:03,955
There's over 10 gambling ships
between Hong Kong Singapore.

960
00:54:04,131 --> 00:54:05,325
That involve big money.

961
00:54:05,665 --> 00:54:08,657
I love gambling ships
because it's safe.

962
00:54:09,302 --> 00:54:10,200
How?

963
00:54:10,604 --> 00:54:13,198
The owner is Macau Mon.

964
00:54:13,407 --> 00:54:15,898
Everyone knows him
is a straight forward person.

965
00:54:16,376 --> 00:54:17,274
Thanks.

966
00:54:17,577 --> 00:54:18,475
Macau Mon?

967
00:54:18,678 --> 00:54:20,771
Yes! Also, his left hand Handsome...

968
00:54:20,981 --> 00:54:22,278
is always there.

969
00:54:22,783 --> 00:54:23,772
Brother Handsome.

970
00:54:23,917 --> 00:54:25,009
Welcome...

971
00:54:25,819 --> 00:54:27,912
We meet again. I will pay.

972
00:54:28,288 --> 00:54:30,779
- Brother Handsome.
- Hello, Good luck...

973
00:54:31,425 --> 00:54:32,323
Handsome.

974
00:54:32,492 --> 00:54:33,481
What's it, Rocky?

975
00:54:33,593 --> 00:54:35,288
Haven't you
lost enough money already?

976
00:54:35,395 --> 00:54:37,795
I want to win it back.

977
00:54:38,031 --> 00:54:39,020
Good!

978
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:40,963
Mon left me with couple millions
and told me to pass it out.

979
00:54:41,067 --> 00:54:42,261
I don't know how I should do that.

980
00:54:42,369 --> 00:54:43,563
Just take the money away,

981
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,967
if you can.

982
00:54:45,172 --> 00:54:47,265
Handsome, you're funny guy!

983
00:54:47,407 --> 00:54:48,601
Let me introduce to you my brothers.

984
00:54:48,675 --> 00:54:50,074
King, Skinny Dragon.

985
00:54:55,682 --> 00:54:57,274
- King?
- Yes.

986
00:54:57,684 --> 00:54:58,878
Your name is very familiar.

987
00:54:59,786 --> 00:55:03,483
I am Rocky's fellow.

988
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:06,457
Rocky,

989
00:55:06,626 --> 00:55:10,118
how come all your fellows
are taller than you? Why?

990
00:55:13,967 --> 00:55:15,161
Have you heard of
the name Bad Temper?

991
00:55:16,703 --> 00:55:17,601
No... no.

992
00:55:17,804 --> 00:55:20,705
I am Handsome,
I am Bad Temper's little brother.

993
00:55:22,909 --> 00:55:24,206
Isn't this like soap opera?

994
00:55:24,811 --> 00:55:25,709
Help yourselves.

995
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:32,345
He is so high.

996
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:34,410
Forget him! Let's go gamble.

997
00:55:40,494 --> 00:55:44,396
Bigger... bigger.

998
00:55:44,764 --> 00:55:46,356
Damn it!

999
00:55:49,302 --> 00:55:50,394
Eight, dealer wins.

1000
00:55:59,279 --> 00:56:00,177
What?

1001
00:56:00,413 --> 00:56:01,402
He bets on player,

1002
00:56:01,548 --> 00:56:02,640
I have to bet on dealer
so as to read the cards.

1003
00:56:03,283 --> 00:56:05,683
You'd win,

1004
00:56:05,785 --> 00:56:06,877
but no just to look at the cards.

1005
00:56:07,387 --> 00:56:08,581
If you want to look at cards,

1006
00:56:08,688 --> 00:56:12,180
I will go buy you
two deck of cards, okay?

1007
00:56:13,193 --> 00:56:14,285
Okay?

1008
00:56:15,362 --> 00:56:16,260
Fine!

1009
00:56:16,963 --> 00:56:17,952
Sorry.

1010
00:56:21,968 --> 00:56:23,367
Nine, player wins.

1011
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:26,068
Yeah... we win again.

1012
00:56:26,573 --> 00:56:28,063
You, let brother King play.

1013
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:29,698
Why do we need to look at the cards?

1014
00:56:29,943 --> 00:56:32,138
So what if we can't look at them.

1015
00:56:32,846 --> 00:56:35,041
I will let you peek at it okay?

1016
00:56:35,148 --> 00:56:35,944
Okay.

1017
00:56:36,149 --> 00:56:37,047
This is a little machine.

1018
00:56:37,517 --> 00:56:38,415
It can read...

1019
00:56:38,552 --> 00:56:41,453
your heart beat
if you put your finger in it.

1020
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:44,882
Really?

1021
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:47,458
Bet this much!

1022
00:56:58,038 --> 00:56:59,528
Picture!

1023
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:19,685
Bigger...

1024
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:20,848
Yes!

1025
00:57:22,462 --> 00:57:27,764
Come on...

1026
00:57:33,673 --> 00:57:34,867
Eight, player wins.

1027
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:38,910
You gamble at least twice a week,

1028
00:57:39,379 --> 00:57:41,279
everytime you play at least
one to two hundred games.

1029
00:57:41,448 --> 00:57:42,244
Even the machine can't stand it,

1030
00:57:42,382 --> 00:57:43,371
can your heart stand it?

1031
00:57:43,783 --> 00:57:45,774
Who cares, you will play
for me from now on!

1032
00:57:46,252 --> 00:57:47,344
You want me to die?

1033
00:57:51,524 --> 00:57:52,718
Thanks, smart ass.

1034
00:57:55,762 --> 00:57:57,662
Brother King, I got leads,

1035
00:57:57,797 --> 00:57:58,695
but why are we betting this much?

1036
00:57:58,898 --> 00:57:59,990
What leads?

1037
00:58:00,233 --> 00:58:02,531
Leads to bet on player, isn't it?

1038
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:06,628
You can't trust any leads!

1039
00:58:07,507 --> 00:58:10,305
All the leads are created by sharper

1040
00:58:10,443 --> 00:58:11,637
in order to trick you.

1041
00:58:12,846 --> 00:58:17,146
You can only trust your confidence.

1042
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:19,808
- We will wait.
- Okay.

1043
00:58:21,621 --> 00:58:22,713
Nine, player wins.

1044
00:58:23,723 --> 00:58:24,815
Eight, player wins.

1045
00:58:24,991 --> 00:58:28,188
Master, it's been a long time,
should we still bet on player?

1046
00:58:28,528 --> 00:58:29,426
Look at the chart,

1047
00:58:29,562 --> 00:58:31,462
the player wins less than five times.

1048
00:58:33,099 --> 00:58:34,498
- Eight, player wins.
- It's really player.

1049
00:58:34,668 --> 00:58:35,862
Do you believe it now?

1050
00:58:36,002 --> 00:58:36,798
I'll take the dividend this time.

1051
00:58:36,936 --> 00:58:38,836
It's a joke.

1052
00:58:40,607 --> 00:58:41,505
What should we bet on?

1053
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:42,730
You go ahead.

1054
00:58:43,977 --> 00:58:44,875
Thanks.

1055
00:58:45,445 --> 00:58:47,743
Four million dollars,
finally I win something.

1056
00:58:47,814 --> 00:58:49,008
Half goes to brother King.

1057
00:58:49,149 --> 00:58:51,743
Don't worry!
I only worry he won't take it.

1058
00:58:51,918 --> 00:58:54,216
Who said not to bet on player?
The player won 14 straight.

1059
00:58:54,554 --> 00:58:57,250
At those kind of situation,
you have to be equally.

1060
00:58:57,457 --> 00:58:58,856
Keep betting on player
until the dealer wins.

1061
00:58:58,992 --> 00:58:59,890
But don't gamble too long.

1062
00:59:00,827 --> 00:59:02,920
Where should we go now?

1063
00:59:03,063 --> 00:59:04,462
Let's go to karaoke,
I'll sing for you.

1064
00:59:04,564 --> 00:59:06,361
I just love going
to karaoke with chicks.

1065
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:07,591
Handsome.

1066
00:59:07,767 --> 00:59:09,758
OK, I'll sing on stage, you can play
with your dick under the table.

1067
00:59:11,204 --> 00:59:13,695
I am not going... you go first,
I have to use the bathroom.

1068
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:15,804
We will wait for you at the karaoke.

1069
00:59:31,124 --> 00:59:32,216
I'm sorry.

1070
01:00:06,793 --> 01:00:07,782
Stop running?

1071
01:00:10,196 --> 01:00:13,791
- Stop it...
- Why you have to run?

1072
01:00:14,534 --> 01:00:15,523
Tell me.

1073
01:00:15,668 --> 01:00:17,363
Sorry brother King.

1074
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:18,562
Why?

1075
01:00:18,671 --> 01:00:21,367
I can't take care of Fanny.

1076
01:00:22,842 --> 01:00:23,831
How is she?

1077
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:27,609
How is she...?

1078
01:00:29,215 --> 01:00:30,705
When she found out
that you went to jail,

1079
01:00:32,485 --> 01:00:33,782
she swallowed many pills on night,

1080
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:36,885
and jumped to death.

1081
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,749
Where is my kid?

1082
01:00:44,297 --> 01:00:45,594
Dead too!

1083
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:58,604
I am sorry, brother King.

1084
01:01:04,217 --> 01:01:07,709
Don't worry... it's not your fault.

1085
01:01:12,192 --> 01:01:13,284
Forgive me!

1086
01:01:18,498 --> 01:01:19,590
You work here?

1087
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:25,761
Give me your telephone number,
I will call you.

1088
01:01:29,108 --> 01:01:30,803
I am right! He sings well.

1089
01:01:33,346 --> 01:01:34,244
Brother King.

1090
01:01:34,447 --> 01:01:35,539
Where did you go?

1091
01:01:37,116 --> 01:01:38,208
I saw an old friend.

1092
01:01:38,418 --> 01:01:40,215
I think I know who that is.

1093
01:01:41,154 --> 01:01:42,143
So what?

1094
01:01:42,288 --> 01:01:43,084
Don't worry!

1095
01:01:43,289 --> 01:01:45,086
I didn't like my brother anyway.

1096
01:01:45,325 --> 01:01:46,724
But I want to talk business with you.

1097
01:01:48,494 --> 01:01:49,392
What business?

1098
01:01:49,529 --> 01:01:50,826
If I tell you, you can't back out.

1099
01:01:51,297 --> 01:01:52,286
Then save your breath.

1100
01:01:52,398 --> 01:01:55,094
Okay! We will
talk again someday, bye!

1101
01:01:56,369 --> 01:01:58,462
Have fun. He should be a singer.

1102
01:02:10,783 --> 01:02:11,772
I am back.

1103
01:02:19,726 --> 01:02:22,524
Drink some water,
it's almost lunch time.

1104
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:28,756
Wash your face first.

1105
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:32,965
I saw King yesterday.

1106
01:02:37,043 --> 01:02:39,238
I lied to him and said you died.

1107
01:02:44,984 --> 01:02:46,076
I don't know if he will believe me.

1108
01:02:46,886 --> 01:02:47,978
It doesn't matter to us anymore,

1109
01:02:48,554 --> 01:02:49,646
right?

1110
01:02:55,295 --> 01:02:56,284
Very cosy.

1111
01:03:01,968 --> 01:03:03,162
I thought you were dead.

1112
01:03:03,836 --> 01:03:04,825
You asshole stole his wife?

1113
01:03:04,971 --> 01:03:06,165
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

1114
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:16,000

By Jahust Jarzani

1115
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:21,743
This is your family business, I...

1116
01:03:30,863 --> 01:03:32,353
I don't know why I should trust you.

1117
01:03:35,802 --> 01:03:37,997
When I was in jail,
I wrote many letters to Fanny.

1118
01:03:39,973 --> 01:03:41,167
When you came visit me,

1119
01:03:42,976 --> 01:03:44,466
I told you to take care of her.

1120
01:03:46,946 --> 01:03:48,038
And you did a great job.

1121
01:03:51,517 --> 01:03:55,009
No matter what I say,
I am still wrong,

1122
01:03:58,057 --> 01:03:59,046
but sorry!

1123
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:00,451
Why say sorry to him?

1124
01:04:02,028 --> 01:04:03,222
Without his help,

1125
01:04:03,596 --> 01:04:05,496
me and my son would have
starved to death.

1126
01:04:05,798 --> 01:04:06,890
To wait for you?

1127
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:10,067
If we waited for you,
I would have been a hooker.

1128
01:04:18,378 --> 01:04:19,470
Sorry!

1129
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,277
Use the other leg.

1130
01:04:25,318 --> 01:04:26,307
Smoke?

1131
01:04:26,652 --> 01:04:28,347
Try it, it's good.

1132
01:04:29,155 --> 01:04:29,951
Let's go.

1133
01:04:30,123 --> 01:04:32,318
Brother King,
this kid is pretty cute.

1134
01:04:32,425 --> 01:04:34,518
Too bad he is cripple.

1135
01:04:35,962 --> 01:04:37,657
Tell him your name.

1136
01:04:38,364 --> 01:04:42,960
I am Little King, diamond King.

1137
01:04:45,605 --> 01:04:49,803
I am having your kid,
but I won't let you see him.

1138
01:04:49,976 --> 01:04:51,170
If I have 1 billion dollars,

1139
01:04:51,277 --> 01:04:53,472
I'd trade it for my wife and kid.

1140
01:05:06,025 --> 01:05:07,117
What happened to you?

1141
01:05:07,226 --> 01:05:10,320
I don't know!
Ask my mother and father.

1142
01:05:22,542 --> 01:05:23,531
Can I...

1143
01:05:23,676 --> 01:05:25,166
take him out to play sometimes?

1144
01:05:29,715 --> 01:05:30,704
Thanks.

1145
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:39,380
In the past five years,
I have never been so happy.

1146
01:05:40,927 --> 01:05:43,327
Today with Little King besides me,

1147
01:05:43,963 --> 01:05:46,557
my world's become a colorful one.

1148
01:05:48,034 --> 01:05:49,331
Everything in front of me

1149
01:05:50,069 --> 01:05:51,263
has become very pretty.

1150
01:05:53,739 --> 01:05:56,139
Look at them, they are so happy,
and you are so bad.

1151
01:05:56,309 --> 01:05:58,004
If you like it,
get yourself one baby.

1152
01:05:58,911 --> 01:06:00,105
Your are very annoying.

1153
01:06:00,947 --> 01:06:02,847
Stop thinking about that slut face.

1154
01:06:03,082 --> 01:06:04,071
Forget him.

1155
01:06:04,183 --> 01:06:05,775
Think about how good
your life is without him.

1156
01:06:05,885 --> 01:06:06,977
You are single and happy now.

1157
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,111
Let's see when master
will start to like you,

1158
01:06:09,322 --> 01:06:10,721
and when you
will give birth to his baby.

1159
01:06:11,057 --> 01:06:12,752
When you will have his last name

1160
01:06:12,859 --> 01:06:13,951
and live happily ever after.

1161
01:06:14,594 --> 01:06:15,492
Stupid.

1162
01:06:16,395 --> 01:06:17,589
He will be yours someday.

1163
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,738
Brother King.

1164
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,105
Come, sit a while.

1165
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,047
Why does she seem so sad?

1166
01:06:39,418 --> 01:06:41,010
You know what happened.

1167
01:06:42,555 --> 01:06:46,252
Play with him for a while, okay.

1168
01:06:46,392 --> 01:06:47,984
Take care of him,
I will go check on her.

1169
01:06:49,595 --> 01:06:51,495
Do you want to try
something very exciting?

1170
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,789
What's wrong?

1171
01:06:56,669 --> 01:06:58,762
Are you still thinking about Raymond?

1172
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:01,529
No...

1173
01:07:01,774 --> 01:07:05,073
There is still this feeling...
I don't know!

1174
01:07:05,511 --> 01:07:07,206
Let's do this, make yourself a goal.

1175
01:07:07,313 --> 01:07:09,008
Like where you want to go.

1176
01:07:10,516 --> 01:07:11,414
Europe.

1177
01:07:12,084 --> 01:07:13,483
Ask your brother to take you then.

1178
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,212
If he goes with me
I'd rather stay here alone.

1179
01:07:16,489 --> 01:07:17,581
If you don't mind...

1180
01:07:18,824 --> 01:07:20,815
an old man coming along,

1181
01:07:20,927 --> 01:07:21,916
I will go with your then?

1182
01:07:22,929 --> 01:07:23,827
I mean it!

1183
01:07:24,797 --> 01:07:26,492
Brother King, what a surprise!

1184
01:07:27,733 --> 01:07:28,631
Your girlfriend?

1185
01:07:30,937 --> 01:07:33,929
I am not as good as you.

1186
01:07:34,307 --> 01:07:35,501
I have something that need your help.

1187
01:07:37,276 --> 01:07:38,766
I know you killed my brother.

1188
01:07:39,512 --> 01:07:41,412
He is an asshole, serve him right.

1189
01:07:41,514 --> 01:07:43,914
If you didn't kill him,
someone would do it.

1190
01:07:44,217 --> 01:07:45,707
If you help me make some money,

1191
01:07:45,851 --> 01:07:47,648
I can call you my brother.

1192
01:07:48,221 --> 01:07:49,119
Go.

1193
01:07:50,122 --> 01:07:51,521
It's Macau Mon!

1194
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:55,957
I want to gamble with

1195
01:07:56,062 --> 01:07:57,552
Macau Mon on Big two.

1196
01:07:59,031 --> 01:08:01,625
In Hong Kong, people make a big bet
on Big Two and Baccarat.

1197
01:08:02,101 --> 01:08:03,398
Baccarat is too easy.

1198
01:08:04,337 --> 01:08:05,634
Macau Mon calls himself
the king of big two.

1199
01:08:06,405 --> 01:08:07,599
I want you to go challenge him.

1200
01:08:07,773 --> 01:08:10,674
You rich people play around
$3,000 dollars a card,

1201
01:08:11,444 --> 01:08:12,741
even you win,
you can only get millions,

1202
01:08:12,945 --> 01:08:13,934
you don't care about that.

1203
01:08:14,847 --> 01:08:17,839
You are really a wise guy.

1204
01:08:18,517 --> 01:08:19,916
But I have a bigger plan.

1205
01:08:20,653 --> 01:08:21,642
You want to kill him?

1206
01:08:22,788 --> 01:08:24,779
As you said.

1207
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,024
He didn't hurt me in any way,

1208
01:08:27,526 --> 01:08:28,823
I don't have to help you.

1209
01:08:29,228 --> 01:08:30,320
Really?

1210
01:08:30,963 --> 01:08:32,055
You know what,

1211
01:08:32,198 --> 01:08:35,099
I hate traitor like you.

1212
01:08:36,469 --> 01:08:38,767
He is your boss
and you want to kill him.

1213
01:08:39,205 --> 01:08:40,399
How can I trust you?

1214
01:08:41,907 --> 01:08:43,306
You have to.

1215
01:08:50,783 --> 01:08:52,375
Look at this!
What an interesting tape!

1216
01:08:56,589 --> 01:08:57,681
King.

1217
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:00,183
King.

1218
01:09:01,761 --> 01:09:02,659
So?

1219
01:09:02,762 --> 01:09:04,161
You are worse than your brother.

1220
01:09:04,263 --> 01:09:05,059
Will you work with me?

1221
01:09:05,131 --> 01:09:05,927
No way!

1222
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:07,087
Are you scared?

1223
01:09:08,234 --> 01:09:09,428
Little King, run!

1224
01:09:09,635 --> 01:09:12,126
Run... little King.

1225
01:09:12,271 --> 01:09:14,466
Run, little King.

1226
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:23,478
This kid is cute. He can run
so fast even he is crippled.

1227
01:09:38,898 --> 01:09:39,887
Go to hell.

1228
01:10:02,021 --> 01:10:03,818
Little King... Little King.

1229
01:10:07,293 --> 01:10:11,195
Tell your boss to work with me,
or else... he's shit!

1230
01:10:11,497 --> 01:10:12,794
Take this home and enjoy it.

1231
01:10:12,898 --> 01:10:13,887
Let's go.

1232
01:10:16,202 --> 01:10:17,100
King.

1233
01:11:03,149 --> 01:11:05,447
Do you think I am useless?

1234
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:09,312
No! You are brave

1235
01:11:09,889 --> 01:11:11,584
and you win everytime your gamble.

1236
01:11:12,558 --> 01:11:14,253
Even my dump brother,

1237
01:11:14,393 --> 01:11:16,190
you made him a better man.

1238
01:11:16,662 --> 01:11:17,959
I think that you are a great man.

1239
01:11:19,932 --> 01:11:21,229
I used to think this way.

1240
01:11:22,635 --> 01:11:26,537
Everytime after I gambled,
I always felt that I am a winner.

1241
01:11:28,841 --> 01:11:32,140
But this time,
I feel like I am the loser.

1242
01:11:34,313 --> 01:11:39,512
I lost my family, time and happiness.

1243
01:11:41,187 --> 01:11:42,677
I even lost my confidence.

1244
01:11:45,925 --> 01:11:47,324
So what if I am a good sharper?

1245
01:11:49,161 --> 01:11:50,560
At the end Handsome will use us

1246
01:11:51,664 --> 01:11:54,758
to cheat and lie for him.

1247
01:11:55,534 --> 01:11:56,728
You can beat him.

1248
01:12:00,105 --> 01:12:01,094
How?

1249
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:03,967
My son is in the hospital.

1250
01:12:05,678 --> 01:12:07,270
Chung and Fanny are being locked up.

1251
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:15,245
Even if I win
I might not be able to save them.

1252
01:12:16,622 --> 01:12:18,214
But they are not
the only ones you have left.

1253
01:12:19,525 --> 01:12:22,016
You still have my brother, yourself...

1254
01:12:22,461 --> 01:12:23,450
and me.

1255
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:32,867
Are you crazy or silly?

1256
01:12:33,572 --> 01:12:34,869
After Raymond left,

1257
01:12:35,207 --> 01:12:36,697
don't you know what I am thinking?

1258
01:12:39,311 --> 01:12:42,712
Let me tell you,
sometimes I really envy your wife.

1259
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:48,918
Are you crazy?

1260
01:12:50,389 --> 01:12:52,084
We have a huge age difference...

1261
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:47,728
I thought I told her to talk to him.

1262
01:14:47,873 --> 01:14:49,363
Did I tell her to sleep with him?

1263
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:52,099
Oh well, who cares?
I guess my sister needs lots of love.

1264
01:14:59,018 --> 01:14:59,916
Quiet.

1265
01:15:00,052 --> 01:15:01,451
- You are going to help Handsome?
- Quiet.

1266
01:15:01,553 --> 01:15:02,952
You are really
going to help Handsome?

1267
01:15:03,055 --> 01:15:04,147
I have no choice.

1268
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:07,284
Macau Mon is cold blooded and smart.

1269
01:15:07,493 --> 01:15:09,188
No matter you win or lose,

1270
01:15:09,294 --> 01:15:11,489
you might not able
to save your wife and Chung.

1271
01:15:11,664 --> 01:15:12,756
I am going
to take it one step at a time.

1272
01:15:12,865 --> 01:15:14,059
You are really
going to help Handsome?

1273
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:15,188
Quiet.

1274
01:15:16,235 --> 01:15:17,634
- You are really going.
- Quiet!

1275
01:15:20,572 --> 01:15:21,971
If I don't know your plan,

1276
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:23,967
I won't help you.

1277
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:27,611
Macau Mon is the biggest dealer...

1278
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,771
in Asia.

1279
01:15:29,982 --> 01:15:31,574
He won a lot of money
from betting on World Cup.

1280
01:15:31,717 --> 01:15:33,412
Two nights from now will be the World
Cup final between France and Brazil.

1281
01:15:33,619 --> 01:15:36,019
The whole world feels
that Brazil will win.

1282
01:15:37,089 --> 01:15:38,078
So what?

1283
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:40,387
I know that the European mobsters
are already doing something.

1284
01:15:40,526 --> 01:15:41,618
If Brazil loses,

1285
01:15:41,894 --> 01:15:43,486
the whole world's dealers
will win big.

1286
01:15:46,498 --> 01:15:47,988
Macau Mon should know about this.

1287
01:15:48,133 --> 01:15:50,931
Of course he knows! He is
a very good friend with the Mafis.

1288
01:15:51,336 --> 01:15:52,530
He knows Brazil is going to lose.

1289
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:54,137
So he calmly accept
the betting of Brazil's winning.

1290
01:15:54,339 --> 01:15:56,330
If Brazil wins, he will be broke.

1291
01:15:56,975 --> 01:15:59,170
That night, we'll play big two on
the ship, each card worth's $10,000.

1292
01:15:59,311 --> 01:16:01,108
I want you to make Brazil win.

1293
01:16:02,881 --> 01:16:05,281
Make Brazil win?
Do you think I am GOD?

1294
01:16:05,718 --> 01:16:06,810
You can do it.

1295
01:16:06,885 --> 01:16:08,079
It's on TV.

1296
01:16:08,187 --> 01:16:09,984
You'll bet
ten million dollars on Brazil.

1297
01:16:10,122 --> 01:16:11,111
I'll take half.

1298
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:13,588
It's not this simple.

1299
01:16:15,027 --> 01:16:17,518
By the way, recently I'm told that

1300
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:20,425
Macau Mon has
a serious heart problem.

1301
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:24,434
You want him to die of
a heart attack that night, right?

1302
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:27,470
Smart people's lives
are always short.

1303
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,431
I am not very smart.
Can you tell me one thing,

1304
01:16:31,276 --> 01:16:33,574
how can we make him
have a heart attack?

1305
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:35,672
You must have an idea.

1306
01:16:39,284 --> 01:16:42,879
TG7, a poison
that dissolves in water.

1307
01:16:44,022 --> 01:16:47,321
If he drinks it,
it will create heart failure.

1308
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:49,054
Even the coroner can't detect it.

1309
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:52,026
You want Chung
and fanny to take one too?

1310
01:16:52,464 --> 01:16:53,260
You try it.

1311
01:16:53,432 --> 01:16:54,330
Okay!

1312
01:16:54,867 --> 01:16:56,858
Don't act all cool.
Get out of the car.

1313
01:16:57,703 --> 01:16:58,692
Stop at the side.

1314
01:17:16,321 --> 01:17:17,720
I can't believe he knows our plan.

1315
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:19,787
So what?

1316
01:17:20,192 --> 01:17:21,591
Did you get your men ready yet?

1317
01:17:21,927 --> 01:17:23,724
Yes! After this incident,

1318
01:17:23,862 --> 01:17:25,762
even if he hides at the earth's
corner, I will have him killed.

1319
01:17:26,031 --> 01:17:27,020
I will pay you when I see the body.

1320
01:17:27,933 --> 01:17:29,833
That is director Squirrel
and he is good.

1321
01:17:29,968 --> 01:17:31,765
He is specially good
at conducting live show.

1322
01:17:32,371 --> 01:17:33,463
He is over there.

1323
01:17:33,972 --> 01:17:34,961
Curly!

1324
01:17:36,408 --> 01:17:37,306
Dragon.

1325
01:17:40,245 --> 01:17:41,542
This is my master, brother King.

1326
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:42,678
Brother King.

1327
01:17:42,815 --> 01:17:44,510
Is there any problem
with the things I told you to do?

1328
01:17:44,683 --> 01:17:45,877
No problem.

1329
01:17:46,084 --> 01:17:47,176
I want it seems like a live show.

1330
01:17:47,352 --> 01:17:48,341
No problem.

1331
01:17:48,687 --> 01:17:49,779
We want commercials too.

1332
01:17:49,888 --> 01:17:50,684
No problem.

1333
01:17:50,923 --> 01:17:52,515
I want the famous commentator
Lin Sheung-yee.

1334
01:17:52,624 --> 01:17:53,716
No problem.

1335
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:23,313
What?

1336
01:18:23,856 --> 01:18:24,948
You have to win tonight.

1337
01:18:25,557 --> 01:18:26,546
I won't lose.

1338
01:18:28,727 --> 01:18:30,126
You spend a night...

1339
01:18:30,762 --> 01:18:31,956
at your cousin's home.

1340
01:18:32,631 --> 01:18:34,826
Meet us at the train station
at nine tomorrow morning.

1341
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:36,862
We will go to Mainland China,
then we will go to Europe.

1342
01:18:38,136 --> 01:18:39,228
I will wait for you.

1343
01:18:41,106 --> 01:18:42,903
If you don't see us
after nine thirty,

1344
01:18:43,141 --> 01:18:44,039
then you have to go first.

1345
01:18:45,978 --> 01:18:47,468
I won't leave without you two.

1346
01:18:49,348 --> 01:18:53,341
Listen to me, leave after nine thirty.

1347
01:18:53,619 --> 01:18:54,608
And that is a must.

1348
01:18:57,256 --> 01:18:58,245
Go.

1349
01:19:09,701 --> 01:19:10,599
How long have you been standing here?

1350
01:19:10,769 --> 01:19:11,667
Yes!

1351
01:19:12,437 --> 01:19:13,734
- You heard it all?
- Yes.

1352
01:19:19,044 --> 01:19:23,140
Let me tell you, we are
going to face the pros tonight.

1353
01:19:23,949 --> 01:19:27,441
If we win tonight,
you can be God of Gamblers.

1354
01:19:28,053 --> 01:19:28,951
You don't have to be God of singer.

1355
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:30,419
Okay.

1356
01:19:31,056 --> 01:19:32,751
Brother King,
let me ask you a question.

1357
01:19:34,259 --> 01:19:35,954
- How is my voice?
- Very bad.

1358
01:19:36,128 --> 01:19:37,220
You don't have to tell the truth.

1359
01:19:40,065 --> 01:19:41,259
Let me ask you a question.

1360
01:19:42,567 --> 01:19:43,363
What.

1361
01:19:43,535 --> 01:19:44,433
Is your first name really Skinny?

1362
01:19:45,137 --> 01:19:47,037
No way! Have you ever known
someone named Skinny?

1363
01:19:48,307 --> 01:19:49,103
What is your real surname?

1364
01:19:49,274 --> 01:19:50,468
Don't worry,
just call me Skinny Dragon.

1365
01:19:50,642 --> 01:19:51,438
Tell me.

1366
01:19:51,643 --> 01:19:53,838
- No...
- Tell me...

1367
01:19:54,947 --> 01:19:55,743
What?

1368
01:19:55,847 --> 01:19:57,940
- Louder?
- I can't hear you.

1369
01:19:59,985 --> 01:20:01,077
Stupid Dragon!

1370
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:02,818
Stop laughing!

1371
01:20:06,959 --> 01:20:09,450
Look at you, I fed you so well.

1372
01:20:09,628 --> 01:20:10,925
And you won't say 'be careful' to me.

1373
01:20:12,397 --> 01:20:13,386
Be careful.

1374
01:20:14,466 --> 01:20:15,660
Okay. Bye.

1375
01:20:33,185 --> 01:20:34,584
Brother Mon is waiting for you
in the VIP room.

1376
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,117
Tonight's final
is between France and Brazil.

1377
01:20:37,522 --> 01:20:41,515
We can play big two and
gamble on the game, what a night!

1378
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:46,830
I want to see Chung and Fanny first.

1379
01:20:49,901 --> 01:20:53,393
Look, they are still alive! Relax!

1380
01:20:55,073 --> 01:20:55,971
Okay!

1381
01:21:07,886 --> 01:21:09,581
Brother King,
let me introduce to you.

1382
01:21:09,855 --> 01:21:10,947
This is my boss Mon,

1383
01:21:11,056 --> 01:21:12,353
everyone calls him Macau Mon.

1384
01:21:14,659 --> 01:21:17,457
My brother Dragon,
nicknamed Skinny Dragon.

1385
01:21:20,799 --> 01:21:23,097
It doesn't matter who he is,
who cares?

1386
01:21:23,869 --> 01:21:26,269
Right! Just save
your energy for the game.

1387
01:21:26,405 --> 01:21:27,702
You brought so much money
onto this ship,

1388
01:21:27,806 --> 01:21:29,296
I wouldn't let you walk away
with it so easily.

1389
01:21:34,746 --> 01:21:37,044
Here is a $50 million dollars
bank check.

1390
01:21:39,017 --> 01:21:41,918
We will be on the game first.

1391
01:21:42,554 --> 01:21:45,546
Okay! If you bet on Brazil,
we have a special offer for you,

1392
01:21:46,858 --> 01:21:49,349
here is our package,
if Brazil wins, you'll gain 10%% % less.

1393
01:21:50,228 --> 01:21:52,025
Which means if Brazil wins by a goal,

1394
01:21:52,531 --> 01:21:53,930
I win $25,000,000.

1395
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,998
If Brazil wins by two,
I win $45,000,000.

1396
01:21:58,370 --> 01:22:00,167
Brother, money doesn't
come this easily.

1397
01:22:04,209 --> 01:22:07,110
No pain, no gain.

1398
01:22:07,345 --> 01:22:10,837
Okay! We will play big two
and bet on the game then.

1399
01:22:11,283 --> 01:22:12,272
$10,000 a card.

1400
01:22:13,318 --> 01:22:17,118
Eight cards double, ten cards triple,
thirteen cards quadruple.

1401
01:22:17,489 --> 01:22:18,786
I came with cash and a check

1402
01:22:19,658 --> 01:22:21,353
and I expect
to walk home with it too.

1403
01:22:21,893 --> 01:22:26,091
Of course! I, Macau Mon,
always pay up when I lose.

1404
01:22:27,132 --> 01:22:29,930
If you want to bet on fingers
then I will pay you with my fingers.

1405
01:22:33,805 --> 01:22:34,897
Are you scared?

1406
01:22:38,443 --> 01:22:39,637
Who is the other player?

1407
01:22:39,778 --> 01:22:40,870
It's me!

1408
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:44,476
Winner Gary, why are you so late?

1409
01:22:44,883 --> 01:22:46,077
I've been on the ship long time ago,

1410
01:22:46,585 --> 01:22:48,576
but I took a nice sauna bath
that is why I am late.

1411
01:22:50,088 --> 01:22:52,989
Brother Mon, I've never seen
this white head before.

1412
01:22:53,425 --> 01:22:54,824
Where did you find this loser?

1413
01:22:55,026 --> 01:22:57,017
Hey, you look
more like a loser to me.

1414
01:22:58,563 --> 01:23:01,657
What's wrong with you?
Who let you speak here?

1415
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:03,526
Go out and take a walk.

1416
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,971
I follow the fat boy's direction,
why isn't it working?

1417
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,509
I've got something.

1418
01:23:25,157 --> 01:23:26,647
Damn! How come it's ATV?

1419
01:23:31,163 --> 01:23:32,061
Got it.

1420
01:23:45,277 --> 01:23:46,471
Diamond three first.

1421
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:01,848
Pass.

1422
01:24:06,965 --> 01:24:07,954
Pass.

1423
01:24:08,133 --> 01:24:09,828
What's wrong? Why the rush?

1424
01:24:17,242 --> 01:24:18,334
- Pass.
- Pass.

1425
01:24:19,744 --> 01:24:20,733
Good.

1426
01:24:31,323 --> 01:24:32,620
Diamond two.

1427
01:24:32,691 --> 01:24:33,589
Pass.

1428
01:24:44,536 --> 01:24:45,434
Pass.

1429
01:24:46,104 --> 01:24:47,196
Pass.

1430
01:24:47,672 --> 01:24:48,570
Pass.

1431
01:24:49,307 --> 01:24:50,296
Three threes.

1432
01:24:51,376 --> 01:24:54,971
You are good,
you can break up four threes.

1433
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,669
I just hoped it would work.

1434
01:24:57,449 --> 01:24:59,940
Luckily it worked and
now you lost four times more.

1435
01:25:01,019 --> 01:25:03,010
Very good!

1436
01:25:03,855 --> 01:25:05,846
I haven't faced
such a good player for a long time.

1437
01:25:06,858 --> 01:25:07,950
Thank you.

1438
01:25:11,763 --> 01:25:13,355
Master, did you win?

1439
01:25:13,498 --> 01:25:14,294
A little.

1440
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:16,094
He just got luck.

1441
01:25:16,268 --> 01:25:19,066
I am the king of big two.

1442
01:25:19,504 --> 01:25:21,904
You'd play at least 200 rounds with
me before knowing who the winner's.

1443
01:25:24,376 --> 01:25:26,173
How dare you look down on my master?

1444
01:25:26,378 --> 01:25:27,470
How dare you hit me?

1445
01:25:27,579 --> 01:25:28,477
Dragon.

1446
01:25:28,613 --> 01:25:30,205
Dickhead! Go to hell.

1447
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:34,441
Brother King,
what should I do with your man?

1448
01:25:34,819 --> 01:25:37,913
There are rules,

1449
01:25:39,324 --> 01:25:41,417
this is your place, you take charge.

1450
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:43,358
Take him away.

1451
01:25:43,995 --> 01:25:45,087
Get up!

1452
01:25:48,667 --> 01:25:50,157
Continue.

1453
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:53,168
Yet another one.

1454
01:25:56,574 --> 01:25:58,064
Dickhead! You are still alive?

1455
01:25:58,643 --> 01:25:59,439
Where is your boss?

1456
01:25:59,644 --> 01:26:00,941
He is in the VIP room.

1457
01:26:01,313 --> 01:26:03,804
So what? You are going
to leave him there?

1458
01:26:04,115 --> 01:26:05,412
Look after the three of them.

1459
01:26:11,656 --> 01:26:16,150
Dickhead! I told you
that you will get it someday.

1460
01:26:16,628 --> 01:26:22,032
So what if you are
with that white head?

1461
01:26:22,233 --> 01:26:24,030
You can't hide?

1462
01:26:24,703 --> 01:26:25,795
Act tough?

1463
01:26:26,638 --> 01:26:27,935
Why are you acting like a woman?

1464
01:26:28,106 --> 01:26:29,095
Use some strength!

1465
01:26:31,843 --> 01:26:34,334
You dickhead!
How dare you pretend to be tough!

1466
01:26:34,646 --> 01:26:36,841
Fight back...

1467
01:26:42,153 --> 01:26:43,245
Damn!

1468
01:26:45,223 --> 01:26:47,316
Damn! How dare you?

1469
01:26:51,563 --> 01:26:53,861
Damn! You want to pretend dying?

1470
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:57,361
Get in there.

1471
01:27:00,972 --> 01:27:05,068
What's wrong with you?

1472
01:27:06,878 --> 01:27:08,675
Do you want me to rape you again?

1473
01:27:10,014 --> 01:27:11,413
How dare you bang on me!

1474
01:27:11,816 --> 01:27:14,512
I just want your wife.

1475
01:27:16,921 --> 01:27:19,219
You want me to screw you?

1476
01:27:20,792 --> 01:27:22,987
We are so happy with now.
Let's have more fun.

1477
01:27:26,731 --> 01:27:27,925
Come on, let's play.

1478
01:27:38,042 --> 01:27:40,340
What a gathering!

1479
01:27:42,881 --> 01:27:44,075
Why don't we play
the game of banging?

1480
01:27:50,388 --> 01:27:51,480
Yes!

1481
01:27:51,589 --> 01:27:53,181
Luckily I have you guys to play with.

1482
01:28:00,865 --> 01:28:01,957
You bastard!

1483
01:28:03,701 --> 01:28:05,601
Dickhead! I can't stand you anymore.

1484
01:28:05,737 --> 01:28:07,432
You treated me like a piece of shit.

1485
01:28:07,539 --> 01:28:09,234
And you wanted me to rabbit jump
in front of so many people.

1486
01:28:09,374 --> 01:28:10,568
You nasty scum!

1487
01:28:10,942 --> 01:28:12,341
You cheated me money.

1488
01:28:12,877 --> 01:28:14,367
You want me to look at
a piece of shit in front of you.

1489
01:28:14,712 --> 01:28:15,610
I didn't!

1490
01:28:15,647 --> 01:28:16,511
You did.

1491
01:28:16,781 --> 01:28:18,271
I didn't ask you to look at
a piece of shit in front of me.

1492
01:28:18,416 --> 01:28:21,214
But I just want
to frame you, so what?

1493
01:28:21,453 --> 01:28:22,750
- Okay!
- That's good.

1494
01:28:22,954 --> 01:28:23,943
You jerk!

1495
01:28:24,155 --> 01:28:27,056
I will kick your ass today.

1496
01:28:37,168 --> 01:28:39,762
Damn, it couldn't
be more righteous of me!

1497
01:28:42,307 --> 01:28:43,501
Fanny!

1498
01:28:44,776 --> 01:28:45,868
Are your tits okay?

1499
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:46,999
How is King?

1500
01:28:47,145 --> 01:28:48,043
He is fine!
He planned everything already.

1501
01:28:48,246 --> 01:28:49,042
Let's go.

1502
01:28:49,981 --> 01:28:50,777
Is King really okay?

1503
01:28:50,882 --> 01:28:51,678
Can't you be quiet?

1504
01:28:51,783 --> 01:28:52,681
Hey man, where are you going?

1505
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:53,546
Philippines.

1506
01:28:53,618 --> 01:28:54,812
Damn you! Go to Saikung.

1507
01:29:02,227 --> 01:29:05,219
What's wrong with Ronaldo today?

1508
01:29:05,663 --> 01:29:09,360
It must be the French girls,
they distracted Ronaldo.

1509
01:29:09,501 --> 01:29:10,695
Or maybe he just had
too much sex last night.

1510
01:29:15,907 --> 01:29:21,004
27 minutes passed,
but there is still no score at all.

1511
01:29:21,112 --> 01:29:26,015
Zidane's got it by a header...

1512
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:28,050
France scored first.

1513
01:29:29,554 --> 01:29:30,748
There is another half to be played.

1514
01:29:32,423 --> 01:29:33,720
We got to go to work now!

1515
01:29:33,892 --> 01:29:36,292
Quickly, film extras get ready,
it's one to nothing.

1516
01:29:36,928 --> 01:29:38,122
France scored first?

1517
01:29:38,863 --> 01:29:40,160
Go change! Stupid!

1518
01:29:45,537 --> 01:29:46,936
Hey... aren't you the
famous commentator Lin Sheung-yee?

1519
01:29:47,772 --> 01:29:49,865
I am his older brother,
I am Lin Sheung-wai.

1520
01:29:50,275 --> 01:29:52,266
Stop eating and get to work.

1521
01:29:52,443 --> 01:29:53,637
Or I will take
$50 off your pay check.

1522
01:29:53,745 --> 01:29:54,541
Who do you think you are?

1523
01:29:54,579 --> 01:29:55,477
I'm your boss!

1524
01:29:55,647 --> 01:29:56,636
Hurry.

1525
01:30:00,885 --> 01:30:03,786
Get to work...

1526
01:30:10,662 --> 01:30:11,651
Skinny Dragon, hurry.

1527
01:30:13,164 --> 01:30:14,461
I am here.

1528
01:30:20,838 --> 01:30:24,035
Ready...

1529
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,701
Action.

1530
01:30:30,214 --> 01:30:33,206
Well, the other commentator Chan's
just gone to the bathroom,

1531
01:30:33,351 --> 01:30:36,445
I, Lin Sheung-wai... No,
Lin Sheung-yee'll commentate alone.

1532
01:30:36,621 --> 01:30:40,523
Everyone just saw France score first

1533
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:41,523
on a header by Zidane.

1534
01:30:41,693 --> 01:30:42,887
And they have taken
a one to nothing lead.

1535
01:30:43,061 --> 01:30:45,359
I think everyone is
surprised by this result.

1536
01:30:45,496 --> 01:30:47,691
Hope Brazil will play better...

1537
01:30:47,832 --> 01:30:50,130
in the second half.

1538
01:30:50,268 --> 01:30:51,860
Let us go to commercial break first.

1539
01:30:53,805 --> 01:30:55,500
Ericsson's brought you
the best game...

1540
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,733
It's your time. Go...

1541
01:30:58,009 --> 01:31:00,000
There are lots of people
like to drink soy sauce.

1542
01:31:00,111 --> 01:31:02,705
Some people like it sweet,
salty, not too salty, and...

1543
01:31:03,381 --> 01:31:05,076
fatter, whiter...

1544
01:31:05,683 --> 01:31:07,378
Are you for real?

1545
01:31:10,154 --> 01:31:11,246
I will pick Beer soy sauce.

1546
01:31:15,927 --> 01:31:17,417
There is only one reason.

1547
01:31:20,798 --> 01:31:21,992
That is...

1548
01:31:23,201 --> 01:31:24,293
So exciting!

1549
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:33,675
I mean Beer soy sauce!
Who do you think I am?

1550
01:31:36,981 --> 01:31:39,882
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, kick off.

1551
01:31:41,452 --> 01:31:44,649
Before the match,
everyone thinks Brazil should win.

1552
01:31:44,822 --> 01:31:47,313
But their performance in the
first half was very disappointing.

1553
01:31:47,759 --> 01:31:49,750
Brazil now change their plan...

1554
01:31:49,894 --> 01:31:53,990
Ronaldo and a French player crushed
into the French goal keeper.

1555
01:31:54,132 --> 01:31:56,430
Both men are down.

1556
01:31:56,534 --> 01:32:00,026
Oh no!
Brazil can get a penalty shoot.

1557
01:32:01,973 --> 01:32:04,567
Yes, the referee awards
Brazil a penalty shoot.

1558
01:32:04,742 --> 01:32:07,643
Let's see what really happened.

1559
01:32:07,779 --> 01:32:09,974
Ronaldo was pushed into the goalie.

1560
01:32:10,081 --> 01:32:11,378
Barthez held Ronaldo
down on the floor.

1561
01:32:11,549 --> 01:32:13,744
Will Ronaldo get up with this?

1562
01:32:14,185 --> 01:32:15,379
Brazil got a penalty,

1563
01:32:15,553 --> 01:32:17,453
and their fans are going wild.

1564
01:32:21,592 --> 01:32:23,184
Ronaldo is fine!

1565
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:27,423
He is carefully
putting the ball in place.

1566
01:32:28,766 --> 01:32:31,963
He is going to take the shoot.

1567
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:41,539
He shot, he scored!
We are tied at one goal piece.

1568
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,972
Ronaldo is celebrating
with his teammates after the score...

1569
01:32:46,084 --> 01:32:48,075
What happened to Ronaldo's face?

1570
01:32:48,386 --> 01:32:49,580
You dropped a card.

1571
01:32:53,324 --> 01:32:54,518
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1572
01:32:54,592 --> 01:32:56,184
Oh no! Skinny Dragon,
cover your head.

1573
01:32:58,229 --> 01:33:01,027
Ronaldo is happy, he is celebrating
with his jersey over his head.

1574
01:33:01,165 --> 01:33:02,257
Go back to live.

1575
01:33:10,975 --> 01:33:14,968
France got a corner kick
and Djorkaeff is going to take it.

1576
01:33:15,246 --> 01:33:18,147
What is wrong with
Brazil's goal keeper?

1577
01:33:18,282 --> 01:33:20,580
Zidane scored again with a header.

1578
01:33:20,718 --> 01:33:24,711
Zidane scored twice
and the France leads two nothing...

1579
01:33:24,889 --> 01:33:27,483
No, is two to one.

1580
01:33:27,658 --> 01:33:29,649
Looks like Brazil must try harder.

1581
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:30,925
Skinny Dragon passed out.

1582
01:33:31,095 --> 01:33:31,993
No way?

1583
01:33:32,163 --> 01:33:33,755
Go to commercial.

1584
01:33:34,565 --> 01:33:37,466
One day on a beautiful island,

1585
01:33:38,236 --> 01:33:40,033
a high tech specialist Leung Jing...

1586
01:33:40,304 --> 01:33:42,295
is on his way to have dinner
with his mother-in-law.

1587
01:33:42,607 --> 01:33:45,007
He suddenly detected a strange storm.

1588
01:33:45,376 --> 01:33:48,675
The storm destroyed many countries.
No one was able to stop it.

1589
01:33:48,846 --> 01:33:52,247
The storm was about to reach
the island within thirty minutes.

1590
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:54,147
But Jing seemed like he had
confidence to defeat this storm.

1591
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,215
He ordered a warning on one hand.

1592
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:02,088
On the other hand,
he is racing with the storm.

1593
01:34:08,733 --> 01:34:11,827
Jing was lucky to escape from death,
he decided to save the kids on the dam.

1594
01:34:12,503 --> 01:34:14,903
He risked his life
and rolled down the hill.

1595
01:34:15,873 --> 01:34:17,568
Jing finally had the whole
situation under controlled.

1596
01:34:19,443 --> 01:34:21,343
But someone was here
long before Jing's arrival.

1597
01:34:27,618 --> 01:34:30,212
Who is this secret Lemon?

1598
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:36,656
The girl is very pretty.

1599
01:34:37,295 --> 01:34:38,489
Do you still want to play?

1600
01:34:39,864 --> 01:34:40,853
Play!

1601
01:34:41,766 --> 01:34:42,858
You haven't even put down a card.

1602
01:34:43,634 --> 01:34:45,033
Oh! I forgot.

1603
01:34:46,304 --> 01:34:48,295
No need! Four aces.

1604
01:34:48,973 --> 01:34:49,871
Pass.

1605
01:34:50,007 --> 01:34:51,201
- Do you have it?
- Pass.

1606
01:34:52,009 --> 01:34:53,101
Straight!

1607
01:34:53,444 --> 01:34:54,342
Quaduple again?

1608
01:34:59,283 --> 01:35:00,272
What?

1609
01:35:00,384 --> 01:35:01,476
France scored again.

1610
01:35:01,619 --> 01:35:03,018
Why didn't you wake me up earlier?

1611
01:35:03,154 --> 01:35:04,644
Come on, let's back to work.

1612
01:35:04,822 --> 01:35:06,016
I am your boss!

1613
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:11,387
Brazil's Cafu is attacking
and is about to pass the ball...

1614
01:35:11,495 --> 01:35:15,295
Desailly was there in time
to kick the ball out of play.

1615
01:35:15,466 --> 01:35:17,263
Desailly seems to be hurt.

1616
01:35:17,435 --> 01:35:21,633
Bebeto is ready to take the corner.

1617
01:35:22,173 --> 01:35:26,269
Ready...

1618
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:30,278
Action.

1619
01:35:30,581 --> 01:35:32,481
Ronaldo takes the pass
and he shoots...

1620
01:35:32,650 --> 01:35:33,947
Even Barthez can't save this one.

1621
01:35:34,518 --> 01:35:36,611
Ronaldo is awesome.

1622
01:35:36,821 --> 01:35:38,516
We are tied again.

1623
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:41,183
The score is two to two.

1624
01:35:41,325 --> 01:35:43,225
The match is getting more exciting.

1625
01:35:43,361 --> 01:35:47,457
Without any doubt,
Ronaldo is this match's hero.

1626
01:35:48,566 --> 01:35:51,558
Look at him, he is celebrating
with his jersey over his head again.

1627
01:35:51,669 --> 01:35:54,069
You should be happy...

1628
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:58,037
Brother Mon, are you okay?

1629
01:35:59,043 --> 01:36:00,032
I am fine.

1630
01:36:05,483 --> 01:36:06,882
You, bring us a glass of water.

1631
01:36:11,188 --> 01:36:12,177
No thanks.

1632
01:36:28,673 --> 01:36:31,870
Brother King,
it's only me and you now.

1633
01:36:32,476 --> 01:36:33,465
This is the last game.

1634
01:36:34,078 --> 01:36:35,170
I am still twenty cards ahead of you.

1635
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,177
If you don't beat me
more than ten cards,

1636
01:36:37,348 --> 01:36:38,440
you can't beat me.

1637
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:44,112
It's not bad
if I win the bet on the match.

1638
01:36:45,256 --> 01:36:47,850
Now is two to two,
you are still losing.

1639
01:36:48,726 --> 01:36:49,715
Unless it's three to two.

1640
01:36:50,261 --> 01:36:51,353
Sometimes when you think...

1641
01:36:52,163 --> 01:36:54,461
you are going to win,
you are going to lose.

1642
01:36:55,766 --> 01:36:59,463
Sometimes when you think
you are going to lose, you might win.

1643
01:37:02,773 --> 01:37:05,970
I can't see myself winning the game.

1644
01:37:06,077 --> 01:37:07,874
Of course! You are losing
more than one thousand cards.

1645
01:37:08,179 --> 01:37:11,671
You better pay up
or we will charge you with interest.

1646
01:37:42,146 --> 01:37:43,340
I think I can put on card down.

1647
01:37:47,785 --> 01:37:51,277
Oh no!

1648
01:37:51,522 --> 01:37:53,012
You don't mind
losing another game, do you?

1649
01:37:53,424 --> 01:37:54,413
I can afford it, so what?

1650
01:37:54,592 --> 01:37:58,289
This match is awesome, fantastic!

1651
01:37:58,396 --> 01:38:00,091
France is on the attack again.

1652
01:38:00,398 --> 01:38:01,387
Plan A.

1653
01:38:04,268 --> 01:38:07,260
Piette is in the
penalty zone and he shoots...

1654
01:38:11,242 --> 01:38:13,642
Oh no! He hit the pose.

1655
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:20,173
It's useless holding your head Piette,
who told you to hit the pose.

1656
01:38:20,251 --> 01:38:22,947
If the shot went in then
your team is going to win.

1657
01:38:23,521 --> 01:38:26,422
If there is not more goals,
then we will have to go to overtime.

1658
01:38:27,291 --> 01:38:29,885
No overtime!
The real match is three to nothing.

1659
01:38:30,061 --> 01:38:32,154
We don't have any live scene,
you moron!

1660
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:33,624
Really?

1661
01:38:34,632 --> 01:38:35,621
Diamond A.

1662
01:38:41,839 --> 01:38:44,034
Aces of spade.

1663
01:38:45,743 --> 01:38:46,732
Diamond two.

1664
01:38:49,513 --> 01:38:50,502
Why the rush?

1665
01:38:59,123 --> 01:39:00,112
Pass.

1666
01:39:03,227 --> 01:39:04,125
Pass.

1667
01:39:10,634 --> 01:39:11,623
Pass.

1668
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:15,661
Who has the big two?
Better use it now.

1669
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:17,630
The white head is very lucky today.

1670
01:39:22,713 --> 01:39:23,805
You can really hold it.

1671
01:39:34,792 --> 01:39:35,781
Pass.

1672
01:39:38,963 --> 01:39:39,952
Pass.

1673
01:39:51,242 --> 01:39:53,142
What is going on? Four Js.

1674
01:39:53,577 --> 01:39:54,874
I am going to lose again.

1675
01:39:57,715 --> 01:39:58,807
Pass.

1676
01:39:59,683 --> 01:40:00,479
Pass.

1677
01:40:03,954 --> 01:40:04,943
Straight!

1678
01:40:05,122 --> 01:40:07,022
Sorry! You lose triple.

1679
01:40:07,124 --> 01:40:08,022
Triple?

1680
01:40:08,792 --> 01:40:10,589
How come no one used
the big two? Who has it?

1681
01:40:10,995 --> 01:40:14,897
Brazil's Edmundo passes
the ball to Carlos.

1682
01:40:15,032 --> 01:40:16,829
Carlos passes the ball
back to Edmundo...

1683
01:40:18,936 --> 01:40:20,927
and he puts the ball
in the penalty zone,

1684
01:40:21,605 --> 01:40:25,097
Denilson gets the pass
and he shoots...

1685
01:40:26,177 --> 01:40:27,667
but it hits the pose.

1686
01:40:27,811 --> 01:40:31,611
But Ronaldo is there
and he puts the ball into the net.

1687
01:40:32,683 --> 01:40:35,982
Three to two, Brazil is leading now.

1688
01:40:36,187 --> 01:40:39,281
Yeah! They have a winning heart!

1689
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:40,982
The score is three to two.

1690
01:40:42,826 --> 01:40:44,521
Not much time left,

1691
01:40:44,662 --> 01:40:46,755
looks like Brazil is going to win.

1692
01:40:46,897 --> 01:40:50,389
- The game is over!
- Bravo!

1693
01:40:50,501 --> 01:40:51,593
The game is over now.

1694
01:40:52,736 --> 01:40:54,533
Show the celebration tape
four years ago.

1695
01:41:03,914 --> 01:41:08,010
Brother Mon...

1696
01:41:10,154 --> 01:41:12,554
Brother Mon...

1697
01:41:12,756 --> 01:41:13,950
Brother Mon, are you okay?

1698
01:41:14,658 --> 01:41:15,852
Brother Mon.

1699
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:21,926
Let's go to some commercials first.

1700
01:41:25,836 --> 01:41:27,736
Don't drink it! There are germs.

1701
01:41:33,244 --> 01:41:35,144
Don't drink it! There are germs.

1702
01:41:36,247 --> 01:41:40,240
Of course! It's good for you!

1703
01:41:46,257 --> 01:41:48,054
The commercial nowadays
are very funny.

1704
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:50,957
But you can't see it, dead man!

1705
01:41:51,962 --> 01:41:55,159
I already bet on
hundred million dollars on France.

1706
01:41:56,166 --> 01:41:58,657
Now this ship and
the casino are all mine.

1707
01:42:06,243 --> 01:42:08,734
Leave the money here,
and the check...

1708
01:42:08,946 --> 01:42:10,140
and yourself too!

1709
01:42:11,115 --> 01:42:12,412
You put poison in the water.

1710
01:42:12,816 --> 01:42:13,805
I didn't!

1711
01:42:15,052 --> 01:42:17,350
Although he beats me, but...

1712
01:42:19,156 --> 01:42:20,145
Don't move!

1713
01:42:21,025 --> 01:42:23,619
You killed my boss, I will kill you.

1714
01:42:24,461 --> 01:42:27,259
Macau Mon is dead, I am the boss now.

1715
01:42:31,201 --> 01:42:34,102
Brother Mon...
it's not my fault, it's him.

1716
01:42:34,605 --> 01:42:35,697
It's not your fault?

1717
01:42:36,674 --> 01:42:39,370
King save me.

1718
01:42:39,710 --> 01:42:41,405
How? How he did that?

1719
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:44,169
Remember the last game?

1720
01:42:44,915 --> 01:42:46,507
How come no one used the big two?

1721
01:42:49,753 --> 01:42:51,846
Because I had it.

1722
01:42:54,692 --> 01:42:56,592
The water is poisoned.

1723
01:43:07,738 --> 01:43:08,932
Do you understand it now?

1724
01:43:09,006 --> 01:43:10,303
No... don't kill me!

1725
01:43:10,908 --> 01:43:12,000
Brother Mon, no.

1726
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:13,573
Damn you! You betray me?

1727
01:43:14,545 --> 01:43:15,637
- Brother Mon, no...
- Dickhead!

1728
01:43:15,713 --> 01:43:16,907
- No... don't kill me!
- Traitor.

1729
01:43:47,344 --> 01:43:48,641
Who is looking for King?

1730
01:43:49,446 --> 01:43:51,539
I am Ching,
tell him I am waiting for him.

1731
01:44:01,425 --> 01:44:02,517
Is this King?

1732
01:44:06,363 --> 01:44:07,762
What...

1733
01:44:11,034 --> 01:44:12,228
You got the wrong number!

1734
01:45:10,127 --> 01:45:11,025
King!

1735
01:45:12,830 --> 01:45:15,025
Stop it... King...

1736
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,194
King, get up.

1737
01:45:19,770 --> 01:45:27,973
King... get up! Are you okay?

1738
01:45:32,649 --> 01:45:34,048
Are you okay?

1739
01:45:38,121 --> 01:45:41,022
I am okay... lt's only an accident...

1740
01:45:41,124 --> 01:45:43,115
No, it's not!
They hit you on purpose.

1741
01:45:43,293 --> 01:45:44,783
Why can't they let you go?

1742
01:45:45,195 --> 01:45:47,493
- It's an accident...
- It's not!

1743
01:45:47,664 --> 01:45:49,063
- Believe me.
- No!

1744
01:45:49,233 --> 01:45:50,325
It's the truth!

1745
01:45:52,069 --> 01:45:54,367
Believe me... look who is the driver.

1746
01:45:58,876 --> 01:46:00,673
Skinny Dragon,
what is wrong with you?

1747
01:46:01,144 --> 01:46:04,443
Sorry, brother King, I thought
you were going to leave me here,

1748
01:46:04,548 --> 01:46:05,640
so I drove a little faster.

1749
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:07,639
How are you?

1750
01:46:07,918 --> 01:46:09,317
You want some medicine?

1751
01:46:11,755 --> 01:46:14,656
Put some of this into the nose
and it can stop the bleeding.

1752
01:46:14,758 --> 01:46:15,554
You stupid!

1753
01:46:15,726 --> 01:46:17,023
It will work! Trust me.

1754
01:46:17,194 --> 01:46:19,594
Stupid! Who told you to come here?

1755
01:46:19,763 --> 01:46:22,163
I should have left long ago.

1756
01:46:22,299 --> 01:46:23,596
It is going to work.

1757
01:46:23,867 --> 01:46:30,568
King...

1758
01:46:31,675 --> 01:46:32,869
You bastard!

1759
01:46:33,277 --> 01:46:34,574
Are you guys going to kiss?

1760
01:46:35,345 --> 01:46:36,437
None of your business...

1761
01:46:36,547 --> 01:46:37,946
Stop it! Stop the bleeding first...

1762
01:46:38,946 --> 01:46:48,946
