1
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,236
The ancient Greeks
considered it unseemly...

2
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:10,530
...to give public praise to
women for their good looks...

3
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:13,241
but apparently thought it
did no harm to young men.

4
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:17,515
Note that, unlike our own popular playwrights
in England and the United States...

5
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,415
the great Athenians scorned what we call " love
interest" and regarded sex appeal as indecent.

6
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:25,230
Strewth.

7
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:28,462
Listen to the words put into the
mouth of Aeschylus by Aristophanes.

8
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:33,571
He boasts of how he made the Greeks crave
like lions to dash at the face of the foe...

9
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:35,656
and leap to the call of the trumpet.

10
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,973
But no Stenoboea I have given you,
no. No Phaedra, no heroine strumpet.

11
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:48,167
It's no use. This
open-air experiment's no good.

12
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:50,669
Or else I haven't the knack
of attracting an audience.

13
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:55,778
- I'm afraid I must have bored you terribly.
- No, no, sir. No, no.

14
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:59,844
You sounded a bit heathenish at first, almost
as if you believed in them queer old gods.

15
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:01,825
I talked to my missus about it.

16
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:05,578
You see, sir, she's keen on the Salvation
Army and likes good, serious talk.

17
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:08,601
But when you said last Sunday
that God was there all along...

18
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:11,312
whatever they called him,
I knew it was all right.

19
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:15,587
I never thought much of myself as a speaker,
but I've never lost my whole audience before.

20
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:18,089
Oh, not at all, sir. I've heard worse.

21
00:03:18,193 --> 00:03:20,904
But there's two things that no
speaker can stand up against.

22
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:22,885
What are they, may I ask?

23
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:25,908
One's a band, the other's a fight.

24
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:29,766
Salvation Army knows that.
They always has a band.

25
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,059
Well, I'm off-duty now that
your meeting's over, sir.

26
00:03:32,164 --> 00:03:35,187
- I'll, uh, take you across, if you like.
- Thank you.

27
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:37,272
There's a special
attraction this Sunday.

28
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:40,400
- There's, uh, Major Barbara.
- Major Barbara.

29
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:43,632
- How can a woman be a major?
- Oh, she can in the Army, sir.

30
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:46,447
Or a sergeant, or a
colonel, or even a general.

31
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:48,532
- Really?
- Yes.

32
00:03:48,741 --> 00:03:52,077
If you want a tip or two on how
to gather a meeting and hold it...

33
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:56,039
you might do worse than hear
her take the Sunday service.

34
00:03:56,143 --> 00:03:59,792
Mmm. I will. I've a fancy for
collecting religious experiences.

35
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:02,920
Yeah.

36
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:09,592
Amid all the poverty and
ugliness of our lives here...

37
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:11,781
the sin and the suffering...

38
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:15,639
the grime and the smoke,
the toil and the struggle...

39
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:18,350
you know, and I know...

40
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:22,624
that God is with us
always and everywhere.

41
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:26,690
We don't need a cathedral
to worship him in.

42
00:04:26,794 --> 00:04:30,235
Here, beneath God's open sky,
we can draw nearer to him.

43
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,946
Some of you feel him
near you even now...

44
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,073
and feel, too, how much you need him.

45
00:04:36,178 --> 00:04:40,348
Won't you let him come
into your life now, today...

46
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:43,163
as so many have done before?

47
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:47,542
You want his strength,
his guidance, his comfort.

48
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:50,669
And you'll need his
forgiveness and friendship.

49
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:55,048
Some of you turn away from him in
bitterness at the hardship of your lives...

50
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:57,133
saying that you do not want God.

51
00:04:57,238 --> 00:05:00,053
You want happiness and beauty.

52
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:02,972
God will give you both.

53
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:07,976
There is no beauty like the
beauty of the newly saved...

54
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,355
who has found the
unspeakable happiness...

55
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:18,089
that only the consciousness of
God's presence and love can give.

56
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,302
We, in the Army, have our daily trials.
Most of us are as poor as you are.

57
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:28,202
But we all are happy, and the mark of
that happiness is on us all for you to see.

58
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:30,808
The rich are not happy.

59
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:35,083
The poor have only to reach out their
hands for God's happiness and take it.

60
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:40,713
Is there anyone here
who has courage enough...

61
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:44,987
to raise his hand as a sign that
he would like us to pray for him?

62
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:47,073
Make the decision now.

63
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:50,409
In your need and loneliness...

64
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:52,494
God can meet with you.

65
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:56,768
There must be someone here who feels
that he should raise his hand...

66
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:58,749
but it isn't easy.

67
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:01,669
It's the easiest thing
in the world to do.

68
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:03,754
You've done it often enough...

69
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:07,924
to beckon to your child
or to stop a trolley car.

70
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:10,739
You feel too shy perhaps.

71
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:13,867
Never mind. I will pray for him.

72
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:18,350
And God will give him
the courage of a lion.

73
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:23,250
Come. Do not keep God waiting.
Thousands have done it.

74
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:27,420
And if you can find me one who has
done it and been sorry afterwards...

75
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:30,965
I will put off this dear
uniform and never pray again.

76
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:35,135
Come. Come.

77
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:41,182
I know there is someone.

78
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:44,206
Ah. I found him.

79
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,916
Let the brave gentleman
come to the front.

80
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,001
Make room for him, please.

81
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,797
Give me your hand, dear brother.

82
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:56,925
Will you come with me to our
shelter where we'll pray together?

83
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:02,138
Friends, you will now sing...

84
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:06,204
"How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds."

85
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:14,023
# How sweet the name of Jesus sounds #

86
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:17,672
# In a believer's ear #

87
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:19,757
Close the door, please.

88
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:24,657
Won't you sit down?

89
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:32,685
Now, before we pray a little together...

90
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:35,709
may I tell you to forget
that we've never met before?

91
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:38,107
You mustn't be shy and distant with me.

92
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:41,547
I can see that all's well with you.

93
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:45,822
I can see in your face the new happiness
that has just come into your life.

94
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:50,200
You're a new man. You're
saved. You feel that, don't you?

95
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,560
Listen to me, Major Barbara.

96
00:07:56,664 --> 00:08:00,105
I'm, uh... I'm here on false pretenses.

97
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,233
It is true that a new happiness
has come into my life...

98
00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:05,735
a happiness which I
never quite believed in...

99
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,341
that, at any rate, I thought
would never come into my life.

100
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,635
- It has come.
- Thank God.

101
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:13,971
Take care. It hasn't
made me a better man.

102
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:16,056
It's made me an utterly
unscrupulous one.

103
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:19,184
- What do you mean?
- Look at me.

104
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:22,520
Look deep into my eyes.

105
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:29,401
Is the new happiness that you see there
the kind of happiness you're thinking of?

106
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:34,197
It must be. There's no
other happiness like it.

107
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:38,367
It gladdens my heart because,
under God, I have brought it there.

108
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,286
Good.

109
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:47,855
Now, let me warn you that I
am a scholar and a gentleman.

110
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,357
I'm as poor as a church
mouse, like all scholars.

111
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:52,755
I'm no good for anything in
the way of worldly success.

112
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:56,195
But what does that matter?
We're all poor here.

113
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,802
We never think of money or success.

114
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,200
When all our money's
spent, we pray for more.

115
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:03,181
And it comes. It always comes.

116
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:06,204
Take your mind off such things.

117
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:08,915
And now...

118
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:11,000
shall we pray together?

119
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:14,232
I never pray. At least, not in your way.

120
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,838
The new thing that's come
to me is not that I'm saved.

121
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:20,279
I was saved when I was five years old,
when I first swallowed your religion.

122
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,511
Since then I've swallowed 20
religions. It's my life's work.

123
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:26,326
I'm interested in the
essence of all religions...

124
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:28,307
not in their catchwords or in yours.

125
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:32,164
Let us find it for you here. We can.

126
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:37,168
Nonsense. I have more to teach you
about religion than you can yet imagine.

127
00:09:37,273 --> 00:09:39,358
You think so?

128
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:42,173
Then why have you come here with me?

129
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:44,258
Why did you hold up your hand?

130
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:47,698
Because I have impulses
that I cannot explain.

131
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:50,305
They come very seldom, but when
they come, nothing can stop me.

132
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:53,224
There's an end of my conscience,
of my prudence, of my reason.

133
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:58,020
Such an impulse seized
me the moment I saw you.

134
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:00,418
You may be poor. Our table
manners may be different.

135
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:02,399
Our relatives may not mix.

136
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:05,943
Probably everything is against our
associating with each other. No matter.

137
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:10,844
I'm going to join the Army. I will
put on a uniform and beat the drum.

138
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:15,952
In short, I am hopelessly and
forever in love with you...

139
00:10:16,056 --> 00:10:19,288
and will follow you to the end
of the world until you marry me.

140
00:10:19,393 --> 00:10:21,373
Is that plain?

141
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:26,482
Perfectly.

142
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:31,069
And now will you begin
by seeing me home?

143
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:34,718
I should like to put you through your
first trial by showing you where I live...

144
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:36,908
and introducing you to my family.

145
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:40,140
God has some little
surprises for you, my friend.

146
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:43,268
Have we far to go? What about a taxi?

147
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:45,457
We don't run to taxis in
this part of the world.

148
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,168
Most of us have never been in
one. We'll have to take a bus.

149
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,461
Oh, there's a 73. Jump in.

150
00:10:56,717 --> 00:10:59,323
Don't ring. I have a latchkey.

151
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:01,825
By the way, I'd better know
your name before I go in.

152
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,162
Well, you haven't mentioned yours,
and it's I that have to introduce you.

153
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,142
My name's Adolphus Cusins.

154
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:10,166
Adolphus? What a name.

155
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,251
I shall call you Dolly.

156
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:14,440
My relatives do. I wish they didn't.

157
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:16,421
Introduce me as Professor Cusins.

158
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,715
Allude to me as Miss Undershaft.

159
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:22,677
Undershaft. Not
Undershaft, the cannon king?

160
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:25,387
The rival of Krupp and
Skode? The multimillionaire?

161
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:29,036
Don't worry, Dolly. I haven't
seen him since I was that high.

162
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:32,060
You'll find my mother
much more terrifying.

163
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:58,854
Remember the first time we
caught a bus here, Major?

164
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,565
Yes. And you wanted to
take me home in a taxi.

165
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:04,275
I've cured you of those
extravagant ideas, haven't I?

166
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,569
Yes. Takes the daughter
of a millionaire...

167
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:09,801
to teach economy to a
penniless professor of Greek.

168
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:38,472
Good evening, Morrison. I
suppose we're too late for dinner.

169
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:40,557
I regret to say so, sir.

170
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:43,997
But, sir, your, uh...

171
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:46,083
Oh. Excuse me.

172
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:58,385
- Is anything the matter, Mother?
- Presently, Stephen.

173
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:14,024
Don't begin to read, Stephen.

174
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:16,317
I shall require all your attention.

175
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,507
Oh, it was only while I was waiting.

176
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:24,032
Now.

177
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:29,037
- I haven't kept you waiting very long,
I think? - Not at all, Mother.

178
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:31,122
Give me my cushion, please.

179
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:35,292
Sit down.

180
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:38,420
Don't fiddle with your tie, Stephen.
There's nothing the matter with it.

181
00:13:38,524 --> 00:13:40,401
Oh, I... I beg your pardon.

182
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:45,092
Stephen, I really cannot bear the whole
burden of our family affairs any longer.

183
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:47,177
You must advise me.

184
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:50,201
Really, Mother? I know so
little about your family affairs.

185
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:53,433
So impossible to mention
some things to you.

186
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:57,395
- I suppose you mean your father.
- Yes.

187
00:13:57,395 --> 00:14:00,522
My dear, we can't go on all
our lives not mentioning him.

188
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:03,442
You're old enough now to be
taken into my confidence...

189
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:05,839
and to help me deal
with him about the girls.

190
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:08,237
No, the girls are all
right. They are engaged.

191
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:10,740
Yes, I've made a very
good match for Sarah.

192
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:13,242
Charles Lomax will be
a millionaire at 35.

193
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,682
But in the meantime, his trustees
cannot allow him more than 800 a year.

194
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:20,018
- Uh, yes, but... - Sarah will
have to find at least another 800.

195
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:22,104
And what about Barbara?

196
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,753
I thought Barbara was going to make
the most brilliant career of all of you.

197
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:27,421
And what does she do?

198
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:31,174
Joins the Salvation Army and walks in
one evening with a professor of Greek...

199
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:33,780
whom she's picked up in the street.

200
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:36,283
Yes, I was rather taken aback
when I heard they were engaged.

201
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:38,263
Cusins is a very nice fellow, certainly.

202
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:40,974
No one would ever guess that
he was born in Australia.

203
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:43,372
Oh, Adolphus Cusins will
make a very good husband.

204
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:46,708
- After all, nobody can say a word
against Greek. - No, indeed.

205
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:49,106
Besides, my dear, you must marry soon.

206
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:52,234
I'm trying to arrange something for you.

207
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,528
Don't sulk, Stephen.

208
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,717
I'm not sulking, Mother.

209
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:59,115
I mean, what has all
this to do with my father?

210
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:01,930
My dear, Stephen. Where
is the money to come from?

211
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,432
You know how poor my father is.

212
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,247
Whereas your father must
be fabulously wealthy.

213
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:09,332
There's no need to
remind me of that, Mother.

214
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:12,877
I've hardly been able to open a newspaper
in my life without seeing our name in it.

215
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:16,109
The Undershaft quick firer, the Undershaft
torpedo, the Undershaft submarine.

216
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:18,090
And now, the Undershaft bomb.

217
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:20,592
At Harrow they called
me the Woolwich infant.

218
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:22,677
And at Cambridge some little
beast swiped my Bible...

219
00:15:22,677 --> 00:15:24,658
your first birthday present to me.

220
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:27,994
My writing underneath my name, "Son
and heir to Undershaft and Lazarus...

221
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:30,079
Death and Destruction Dealers.

222
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:32,060
Address: Christendom and Judaea."

223
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,188
But that wasn't so bad as the way people
kowtowed to me everywhere I went...

224
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:37,482
because my father was making
millions by selling cannons.

225
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,880
Exactly! That's why he's
able to behave as he does...

226
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:42,903
openly defying every
social and moral obligation.

227
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:46,239
- It's criminal.
- Well, he does not actually break the law.

228
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:50,097
He broke the law when he was
born. His parents were not married.

229
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:54,267
Mother, is that true?

230
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,769
Of course it's true.

231
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,167
That's why we separated.

232
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:03,129
But this is frightful for me, Mother, to...
to speak to you about such things.

233
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,674
Now, be a good boy,
Stephen, and listen to me.

234
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:10,635
You see, the Undershafts are
descended from a foundling...

235
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,450
who was adopted by an
armorer and gunmaker.

236
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,431
That was centuries ago.

237
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:18,663
Ever since then, the cannon business
has been left to an adopted foundling...

238
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:20,644
named Andrew Undershaft.

239
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:23,042
Your father was adopted in that way...

240
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:26,587
and he pretends to consider himself
bound to carry on the tradition...

241
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:28,776
and adopt someone to
leave the business to.

242
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:32,529
Then it was on my account, Mother,
that your homelife was broken up.

243
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:34,302
I am sorry.

244
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:37,430
Well, dear, there
were other differences.

245
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:39,723
I really cannot bear an immoral man.

246
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:43,268
Your father didn't exactly do wrong
things, but he said them and thought them.

247
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:48,377
That was what was so dreadful. He really
had a sort of religion of wrongness.

248
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:51,504
But I couldn't forgive him
for preaching immorality...

249
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:53,798
while he practiced morality.

250
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:59,115
All this simply bewilders me, Mother.
Right is right, and wrong is wrong.

251
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:04,849
If a man cannot distinguish them properly,
he's either a fool or a rascal, and that's all.

252
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,830
That's my own boy.

253
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:10,271
Now that you understand the
situation, what do you advise me to do?

254
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,711
We cannot take money from him.

255
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:17,673
After all, Stephen, our present
income comes from your father.

256
00:17:17,777 --> 00:17:20,279
- I never knew that.
- Why, dear boy.

257
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:22,364
The Stevenages couldn't
do everything for you.

258
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:27,056
We gave you social position.
Andrew had to contribute something.

259
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,975
So, you see, it isn't a question
of taking money from him or not.

260
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,165
It's simply a question of how much.

261
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,482
I would die sooner than
ask him for another penny.

262
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:40,401
You mean that I must ask him?

263
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:42,695
Very well, Stephen. It
shall be as you wish.

264
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,780
I've asked your father
to come here this evening.

265
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:48,220
Ring the bell, please.

266
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:54,893
He may be here at any moment.

267
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:59,272
Morrison, go and tell everyone to
come to the drawing room at once.

268
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,357
Yes, milady.

269
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:09,489
Mother, are Cholly and Dolly to come in?

270
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:11,782
Barbara, I will not have
Charles called Cholly.

271
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:14,076
The vulgarity of it
positively makes me ill.

272
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:16,370
It's all right, Mother.
Are they to come in?

273
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:18,663
Yes, if they will behave themselves.

274
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:20,749
Come in, Dolly, and behave yourself.

275
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:23,251
Come in, Chollyl

276
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:31,279
Well, sit down, all of you.

277
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,198
Listen to me, children.

278
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:36,596
Your father is coming here this evening.

279
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,681
- What?
- Oh, I say.

280
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:40,766
You're not called on to
say anything, Charles.

281
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,268
- Are you serious, Mother?
- Of course I'm serious.

282
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:46,917
It's on your account,
Sarah, and also on Charles's.

283
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:49,211
I hope you're not going
to object, Barbara.

284
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:51,192
I? Why should I?

285
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,590
My father has a soul to
be saved like anybody else.

286
00:18:53,694 --> 00:18:55,675
He's quite welcome, as
far as I'm concerned.

287
00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:58,907
Well, not that I mind him coming
here, you know, if fair Sarah doesn't.

288
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:00,888
Thank you.

289
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:05,788
Adolphus, have I your permission to
invite my own husband to my own house?

290
00:19:05,892 --> 00:19:09,332
You have my unhesitating support
in everything you do, Lady Brit.

291
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:13,086
- I wonder how the old boy will take it.
- Much as the old girl will, Charles.

292
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:16,526
- No, I... I didn't mean... At least I...
- You didn't think, Charles. You never do.

293
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,716
The result is, you never mean anything.

294
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,801
Now, please attend to me, children.

295
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:23,407
Your father will be
quite a stranger to us.

296
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:26,326
I suppose he hasn't seen Sarah
since she was a little kid, really.

297
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,307
Not since she was a
little kid, Charles...

298
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:31,435
as you express it with that elegance
of diction and refinement of thought...

299
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,416
that seem never to desert you.

300
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,501
Accordingly...

301
00:19:36,752 --> 00:19:39,254
Might I... Might I speak
a word to you, milady?

302
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:41,027
Nonsense. Show him in.

303
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:44,363
Yes, milady.

304
00:19:58,438 --> 00:20:00,523
Does Morrison know who it is?

305
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:02,816
Of course. Morrison's
always been with us.

306
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:05,631
It must be a regular corker
for him, don't you know.

307
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:07,925
Is this a moment to get
on my nerves, Charles?

308
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:10,949
This is something out
of the ordinary. Really.

309
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:15,119
I never expected to meet the...
the mystery man of Europe.

310
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:30,236
The, uh... Mr. Undershaft.

311
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,287
- Good evening, Andrew.
- How do you do, my dear?

312
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:45,249
- You look a good deal older.
- I am somewhat older.

313
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:47,647
Time has stood still with you.

314
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:49,628
Rubbish.

315
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,713
This is your family.

316
00:20:52,964 --> 00:20:54,945
Is it so large?

317
00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:01,201
I'm sorry to say, my memory is
failing very badly in some things.

318
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:04,224
- Ah, I can see that you're my eldest.
- How do you do?

319
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:07,143
- I'm very glad to meet you again, my boy.
- No, no, no.

320
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:10,688
Andrew, do you mean to say you don't
remember how many children you have?

321
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,920
Well, I must confess I
recollect only one son.

322
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,109
So many things have happened
since then, of course.

323
00:21:16,214 --> 00:21:19,341
Andrew, you're talking nonsense.
Of course you have only one son.

324
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:22,469
That is Charles Lomax,
who's engaged to Sarah.

325
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,597
- My dear sir, I beg your pardon.
- Not at all. Delighted, I'm sure.

326
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,786
This is Stephen.

327
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,976
Happy to make your
acquaintance, Mr. Stephen.

328
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,208
Uh... Ah. Then you must be my son.

329
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:37,586
How are you, my young friend?
He's very like you, my love.

330
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:39,880
Uh, no, you flatter me, Mr. Undershaft.

331
00:21:39,984 --> 00:21:42,591
My name is Cusins, engaged to Barbara.

332
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:45,718
This is Major Barbara
Undershaft of the Salvation Army.

333
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:48,221
This is Sarah, your second daughter.

334
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:51,974
And, uh, that is, uh,
Stephen Undershaft, your son.

335
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:56,770
- My dear Stephen, I beg your pardon.
- Not at all.

336
00:21:57,812 --> 00:22:02,504
Mr. Cusins, I'm much indebted to
you for explaining so precisely.

337
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:05,319
- Barbara, my dear.
- Sarah!

338
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,300
Oh, Sarah, of course.

339
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:11,991
Barbara. I am right this time, I hope.

340
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,910
- Quite right.
- Sit down, all of you.

341
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,787
Sit down, Andrew.

342
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:18,872
Thank you, my love.

343
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:21,479
- Here you are, sir.
- Oh.

344
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,711
Thank you.

345
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,094
Uh, takes you some time to find out
exactly where you are, doesn't it?

346
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:36,596
That's not what
embarrasses me, Mr. Lomax.

347
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,307
My difficulty is that if I
play the part of a father...

348
00:22:39,515 --> 00:22:42,226
I should produce the effect
of an intrusive stranger.

349
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:46,396
If I play the part of a discreet
stranger, I may appear a callous father.

350
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,107
There's no need for you to
play any part at all, Andrew.

351
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:51,400
You'd much better be
sincere and natural.

352
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,903
Yes, my dear. I daresay
that will be best.

353
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:59,950
Well, here I am. Now,
what can I do for you all?

354
00:23:00,054 --> 00:23:03,703
You need not do anything,
Andrew. You're one of the family.

355
00:23:03,703 --> 00:23:06,518
You will sit with us and enjoy yourself.

356
00:23:18,924 --> 00:23:22,365
- What on earth is this, Morrison?
- Your hot lemon and ginger, sir.

357
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:24,763
Always at a quarter past 9:00.

358
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:27,995
- Your memory seems to be a great deal
better than mine. -

359
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:32,165
Charles Lomax, if you can behave yourself,
behave yourself. If not, leave the room.

360
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:36,231
I'm awfully sorry, Lady Brit, but
really, you know, upon my soul.

361
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:39,046
Why don't you laugh if you want to,
Cholly? It's good for your inside.

362
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,235
Barbara, you've had
the education of a lady.

363
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:44,467
Please let your father see that,
and don't talk like a street girl.

364
00:23:44,572 --> 00:23:46,448
Never mind me, my dear.

365
00:23:46,553 --> 00:23:49,680
As you know, I'm not a gentleman,
and I was never educated.

366
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:53,017
Oh, but nobody would know it, I assure
you. You look all right, you know.

367
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:55,102
Well, thank you very much.

368
00:23:55,206 --> 00:23:57,395
Charlie, I think you'd
better play something for us.

369
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,002
Oh, perhaps that sort of
thing isn't in your line.

370
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:04,172
- I'm particularly fond of music. - Are you?
Well, you mustn't expect too much.

371
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,238
- Do you play, Barbara?
- Only the tambourine.

372
00:24:08,342 --> 00:24:12,096
But it's useful for taking the
collections in at the end of our meetings.

373
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,057
It's not my doing, Andrew. Barbara's
old enough to go her own way.

374
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:18,143
She has no father to advise her.

375
00:24:18,143 --> 00:24:22,313
Oh, yes, she has. There are no
orphans in the Salvation Army.

376
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:26,066
Your father, dear, has a great many
children and plenty of experience, hmm?

377
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,777
How did you come to understand that?

378
00:24:28,777 --> 00:24:31,592
Charles, play us something at once.

379
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:33,573
One moment, Mr. Lomax.

380
00:24:33,781 --> 00:24:36,179
I'm rather interested
in the Salvation Army.

381
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:39,620
Its motto might be my
own. "Blood and fire."

382
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,913
But-But not your sort of
blood and fire, you know.

383
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:45,041
Come down tomorrow to my shelter at
Limehouse and see what we're doing.

384
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:48,064
We're going to march to a great
meeting at the Albert Hall.

385
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:50,254
Come and see the shelter
and then march with us.

386
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:53,069
It'll do you a lot of
good. Can you play anything?

387
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:56,614
In my youth, I earned pennies
and even shillings occasionally...

388
00:24:56,718 --> 00:24:58,699
in the streets and
public house parlors...

389
00:24:58,803 --> 00:25:01,305
by my natural talent for step dancing.

390
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:04,850
Later on I became a member of our
factory's orchestral society...

391
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,352
and performed passably
on the tenor trombone.

392
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:08,395
Well, that's splendid.

393
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:12,461
Many a sinner has played himself into
heaven on the trombone, thanks to the Army.

394
00:25:12,565 --> 00:25:16,110
Really, Barbara. You go on as if
religion were a pleasant subject.

395
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,195
Do have some sense of propriety.

396
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,322
I don't find it an
unpleasant subject, my dear.

397
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:24,033
It's the only one
capable people really...

398
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:26,640
care for.

399
00:25:26,744 --> 00:25:28,829
Well, if you're determined to have it...

400
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:31,748
I insist on having it in a
proper and respectable way.

401
00:25:31,852 --> 00:25:34,250
This seems to be an admirable
occasion for family prayers.

402
00:25:34,355 --> 00:25:36,857
- Oh, I say.
- Charles, ring the bell.

403
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:38,838
I'm afraid I must be going.

404
00:25:38,942 --> 00:25:42,278
You can't go so soon, Andrew. It
would be most improper. Sit down.

405
00:25:42,382 --> 00:25:44,780
My dear, I have conscientious scruples.

406
00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:47,387
May I suggest a compromise?

407
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:51,349
If Barbara will conduct a little service
elsewhere, I'll attend it willingly.

408
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:54,476
I'd even take part if a
trombone can be procured.

409
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:55,832
Don't mock, Andrew.

410
00:25:55,936 --> 00:25:58,125
You don't think I'm
mocking, my love, I hope.

411
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,836
No, of course not. And it
wouldn't matter if you were.

412
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,859
Half the Army came to their
first meeting for a joke.

413
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:06,987
Come along to the nursery,
Papa. Come on, Dolly. Cholly.

414
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:09,698
I will not be disobeyed by everybody.

415
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:13,138
Adolphus, sit down. Charles, you may go.

416
00:26:13,243 --> 00:26:16,370
You're not fit for prayers. You
cannot keep your countenance.

417
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:19,081
But you, Adolphus, can behave
yourself if you choose to.

418
00:26:19,185 --> 00:26:21,166
I insist on your staying.

419
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:24,190
My dear Lady Brit, there are
things in the family prayer book...

420
00:26:24,294 --> 00:26:26,171
that I couldn't bear to hear you say.

421
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:27,526
What things, pray?

422
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,715
Well, you'd have to
say before everyone...

423
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,905
we've done those things
we ought not to have done.

424
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:35,241
Left undone those things we ought to
have done, there's no healthiness...

425
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:38,473
and I couldn't bear to hear you
doing yourself such an injustice.

426
00:26:38,577 --> 00:26:41,079
As to myself, I... I flatly
deny it, so I must go.

427
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:43,686
Well, go, and remember this, Adolphus.

428
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:47,543
I have a very strong suspicion that you went
to the Salvation Army to worship Barbara...

429
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,524
and nothing else.

430
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:53,903
And I quite appreciate the very clever way
in which you systematically humbugged me.

431
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:57,552
I found you out. Take
care Barbara doesn't.

432
00:26:57,656 --> 00:27:00,575
- That's all.
- Don't give me away.

433
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:10,376
Sarah, if you want to go, go.

434
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,920
Anything's better than to sit there as if
you wished you were a thousand miles away.

435
00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:16,006
Very well, Mama.

436
00:27:20,384 --> 00:27:24,138
- Mother, what's the matter?
- Nothing. Foolishness.

437
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,370
You can go with them, too, if
you like, and leave me alone.

438
00:27:27,474 --> 00:27:30,810
Oh, you mustn't think that,
Mother. I don't like him.

439
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:34,355
The others do. That's the
injustice of a woman's lot.

440
00:27:34,563 --> 00:27:36,440
A woman has to bring up her children.

441
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:39,776
That means to punish them, to
deny them things they want...

442
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:42,487
to do all the unpleasant things.

443
00:27:42,591 --> 00:27:46,553
And then the father, who has nothing
to do but to pet them and spoil them...

444
00:27:46,657 --> 00:27:49,159
comes in when all her work is done...

445
00:27:49,264 --> 00:27:52,079
and steals their affection from her.

446
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:54,789
Have you ever saved a maker of cannons?

447
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:58,542
- No. Would you let me try?
- I'll make a bargain with you.

448
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:01,879
If I go to see you tomorrow
in your Salvation shelter...

449
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:04,798
will you come the day after
to see me in my cannon works?

450
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:09,281
Take care. It may end in your giving up the
cannons for the sake of the Salvation Army.

451
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:12,096
Are you sure it won't end in your
giving up the Salvation Army...

452
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:14,285
for the sake of my cannons?

453
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,830
- I'll take my chance of that.
- And I'll take my chance of the other.

454
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:21,583
- Where is your shelter?
- In Limehouse, at the sign of the cross.

455
00:28:21,688 --> 00:28:24,920
Ask anybody in Chinatown.
Where are your works?

456
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:27,318
At Perivale St. Andrews,
at the sign of the sword.

457
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:29,298
Ask anybody in Europe.

458
00:28:32,113 --> 00:28:36,596
# Onward, Christian soldiers #

459
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:40,662
# Marching as to war #

460
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:45,250
# With the cross of Jesus #

461
00:28:45,354 --> 00:28:48,795
# Going on before ##

462
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,139
What ya, Major?

463
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:28,621
- Feeling better after your meal, sir?
- No. Call this a meal?

464
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,644
Good enough for you perhaps. What is
it to me, an intelligent working man?

465
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,208
- Working man?
- Yes.

466
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:35,398
What are you?

467
00:29:35,502 --> 00:29:37,378
- Painter.
- Yes, I daresay.

468
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:40,923
- Yes. 3-10 a week, when I can get it.
- Why don't you go and get it?

469
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:43,842
Shall I tell you why?
'Cause I'm intelligent.

470
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:48,847
Yes, intelligent beyond the station of life into
which it has pleased the capitalists to call me.

471
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:51,766
- And they don't like a man
that sees through them. - Yeah.

472
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,519
And second, an intelligent human being
needs his due share of happiness...

473
00:29:55,623 --> 00:29:58,543
so I drink something cruel
when I gets the chance.

474
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:02,087
Third, I stand up for me class
and do as little as I can...

475
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:04,694
so as to leave half the
job for me fellow workers.

476
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:09,281
And fourth, I'm fly enough to know what's
inside the law and what's outside it.

477
00:30:09,385 --> 00:30:12,930
And inside it, I do as the capitalists
do... pinch what I can lay me hands on.

478
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:15,432
- What's your name?
- Price.

479
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:18,456
Bronterre O'Brien Price. Snobby
Price for short. What's yours?

480
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,958
- Rummy Mitchens, sir.
- Your health, Miss Mitchens.

481
00:30:21,062 --> 00:30:24,711
Mrs. Mitchens. Mrs. Romola Mitchens.

482
00:30:24,815 --> 00:30:27,630
What? Oh, Rummy, Rummy, Rummy.

483
00:30:27,735 --> 00:30:31,696
Respectable married woman getting rescued by
the Salvation Army by pretending to be a bad 'un.

484
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:33,677
Oh, same old game.

485
00:30:33,782 --> 00:30:36,075
But what was I to do? I can't starve.

486
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,890
These Salvation lasses
is dear, good girls...

487
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:43,582
but the better you are, the worse they like
to think you was afore they rescued you.

488
00:30:43,686 --> 00:30:46,605
Why shouldn't they have their
bit of credit, the poor loves?

489
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,003
They're wore to rags by their work.

490
00:30:49,107 --> 00:30:52,027
And where would they get
the money to rescue us...

491
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:55,154
if we was to let on that we
was no worse than other people?

492
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:58,074
- That's right.
- You know what ladies and gentlemen are.

493
00:30:58,178 --> 00:31:00,784
Yeah. Thievin' swine.

494
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:03,391
I wouldn't say no to their job
though, Rummy, just the same.

495
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:06,935
Who saved you, Mr. Price?
Was it Major Barbara?

496
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,855
No. I come here on me own.

497
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:13,608
I'm going to be Bronterre O'Brien
Price, the converted painter.

498
00:31:13,712 --> 00:31:17,257
I know what they like. I'm gonna tell
'em how I blasphemed and gambled...

499
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:19,342
and whopped me poor old mother.

500
00:31:19,342 --> 00:31:22,991
- You used to beat your mother?
- Not likely. She used to beat me.

501
00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:27,057
You come and listen to the converted painter,
and you'll hear how she was a pious woman...

502
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:30,081
that taught me me prayers at her knee...

503
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:32,374
and how I used to come
home blind drunk...

504
00:31:32,478 --> 00:31:36,232
and drag her out of bed by her snow-white
hair and lay into her with a poker.

505
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,047
That's what's so unfair to us women.

506
00:31:39,151 --> 00:31:42,174
- Your confessions is just
as big lies as ours is. - Yeah.

507
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:46,345
But you men could stand up and tell
your lies right out at the meeting...

508
00:31:46,449 --> 00:31:48,430
and be made much of for it...

509
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,932
while the sort of
confessions we has to make...

510
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:54,477
has to be whispered
to one lady at a time.

511
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:59,481
- 'Tain't right, in spite of
all their piety. - Right?

512
00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:04,068
Do you suppose the Salvation Army'd
be allowed if it went and did right?

513
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:08,760
Not much. It combs our hair and turns us into
good little blokes to be robbed and put upon.

514
00:32:08,864 --> 00:32:11,262
But I can play the game
as good as any of'em.

515
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:15,120
I'll... I'll see somebody struck by
lightning or I'll hear a voice saying...

516
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,830
"Snobby Price, where
will you spend eternity?"

517
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,124
- Oh, I'll have a time of it,
I can tell you. - Mmm.

518
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:23,043
Come. Pluck up. You'll be all right.

519
00:32:23,148 --> 00:32:25,441
Oh, poor old man. Cheer up, brother.

520
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,943
You'll find rest and
peace and happiness here.

521
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:30,028
Hurry up with the food,
miss. He's fair done.

522
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:32,948
- I shan't be long.
- Buck up, daddy.

523
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:37,014
She's gonna fetch you a nice, thick slice
of bread and scrape and a mug of sky blue.

524
00:32:37,118 --> 00:32:40,663
Keep up your old heart. Never say die.

525
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:43,790
I ain't a old man. I'm only 49.

526
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:46,710
Why, that gray patch come
in my hair afore I was 30.

527
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,316
Am I to be turned out in the
street to starve for it...

528
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,652
and my job given to a younger man
what can't do it no better than I can?

529
00:32:52,757 --> 00:32:54,425
Well, no good jawin' about it.

530
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:57,135
You're only a jumped-up, checked-off
hospital-turnout incurable of an old working man.

531
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,221
Who cares about you, eh?

532
00:32:59,221 --> 00:33:01,306
You make the thieving swine
give you a square meal.

533
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,704
They've stolen plenty from you.
You get a bit of your own back.

534
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:07,144
Ah, there we are, brother.

535
00:33:07,248 --> 00:33:11,002
Now, you ask her blessing and
tuck that into you. Go on. There.

536
00:33:11,106 --> 00:33:13,504
Well, I... I never took nothing afore.

537
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:17,153
Oh, come, come. The Lord wasn't
above taking bread from his friends.

538
00:33:17,257 --> 00:33:19,134
So why should you be?

539
00:33:19,238 --> 00:33:23,408
Besides, when we find you a job,
you can pay us for it if you like.

540
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:27,683
Yes, miss. Yeah, that's
right. I... I can pay you back.

541
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:29,768
It's only a loan.

542
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,460
Well, Rummy, are you
more comfortable today?

543
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:39,255
Bless you, lovey. You fed my
body and saved my soul, didn't ya?

544
00:33:40,402 --> 00:33:42,696
You look ready to drop.

545
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,511
- Sit down and rest a bit.
- Oh, not yet, Rummy.

546
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:48,013
There's more work than
we can do. I mustn't stop.

547
00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:50,724
You'll try a prayer
for just two minutes.

548
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:53,017
You'll work all the better after.

549
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:57,396
Oh, isn't it wonderful how a
few minutes' prayer revives you?

550
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,045
I was quite light-headed
this morning, I was so tired.

551
00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:04,903
But Major Barbara just sent
me to pray for five minutes...

552
00:34:04,903 --> 00:34:08,656
and I was able to go on
as if I'd only just begun.

553
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,950
Did you have a piece
of bread, Mr. Price?

554
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:13,452
Yes, miss, but I got the
peace that I value more...

555
00:34:13,556 --> 00:34:15,745
and that's the peace that
passeth all understanding.

556
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,082
Glory, hallelujah!

557
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,460
Oh, that makes me so happy. When you say
that, I feel wicked for loitering here.

558
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:25,546
Oh, I must get to work again.

559
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:29,612
Ohl There you go. Hil Hil

560
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:44,833
- Hello, Bill. Found your girl?
- Garn!

561
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,572
I know you.

562
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,699
You're the one what took
my girl away, aren't you?

563
00:34:58,804 --> 00:35:01,306
You're the one what set her against me.

564
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,599
Well, I've come to get her out, see?

565
00:35:03,704 --> 00:35:07,249
Tell her Bill Walker wants to see
her. She'll know what that means.

566
00:35:07,457 --> 00:35:11,210
And you start to jaw back at me,
and I'll start on you, you hear?

567
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:14,964
There's your way. In you go!

568
00:35:15,172 --> 00:35:17,466
Easy there, mate! She
ain't done you no harm.

569
00:35:17,674 --> 00:35:20,281
Who are you callin' "mate"?
Standin' up for her, are you?

570
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,096
- Put up your hands!
- You great brute!

571
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,806
Oh, God forgive you. How could
you strike an old woman like that?

572
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:29,143
You go and forgive me again, and I'll
go and forgive you one on the jaw...

573
00:35:29,247 --> 00:35:31,228
that'll stop you praying for a week!

574
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:34,772
- Have you anything to say against that?
- No, matey. She ain't nothin' to do with me.

575
00:35:34,877 --> 00:35:37,170
Good job for you, you starved cur.

576
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:39,985
Now, are you gonna fetch
that Mog Habbijam...

577
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,696
or am I gonna knock your block
off and fetch her out myself, eh?

578
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,719
Oh, please, someone go
in and tell Major Barbara!

579
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,141
There, you want to tell
your major on me, do you?

580
00:35:51,245 --> 00:35:53,539
Please don't drag my hair! Let me go!

581
00:35:53,643 --> 00:35:56,458
Do you or don't you? Yes or no?

582
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:59,481
Oh, God, give me strength.

583
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:03,130
- Oh!
- Go and show her that and tell her...

584
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:07,301
if she wants one like it to
come and interfere with me!

585
00:36:09,177 --> 00:36:11,054
You!

586
00:36:11,262 --> 00:36:13,765
Here, finish your mess
and get out of my way.

587
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:18,248
You take a liberty with me, and I'll bash
your face with this mug and cut your eye out.

588
00:36:18,352 --> 00:36:20,541
Come in shoving and
bullying your way in here...

589
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,939
with the bread of charity
sittin' in our stomachs.

590
00:36:23,044 --> 00:36:25,546
What good are you, you old palsy maggot?

591
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,673
- What good are you?
- As good as you and better!

592
00:36:28,778 --> 00:36:32,114
I'll do a day's work again' you or any
other fit, young soaker of your age.

593
00:36:32,218 --> 00:36:35,971
Well, what do you know? Not
even how to behave yourself.

594
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:40,350
Coming in here and laying your dirty fist
across the mouth of a respectable woman.

595
00:36:40,455 --> 00:36:43,687
- - Don't provoke me
to lay it across yours. Do you hear?

596
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:47,544
Yeah, you'd like to hit
a old man, wouldn't you...

597
00:36:47,648 --> 00:36:49,942
after you've done with the women!

598
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:52,236
I ain't seen you with a young man yet.

599
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,676
You lie, you old soup-kitchener, you.

600
00:36:55,885 --> 00:37:00,159
There was a young man here just now.
Did I offer to hit him, or did I not?

601
00:37:00,263 --> 00:37:03,704
Was he starving, or was he not?

602
00:37:03,808 --> 00:37:05,789
Was he a man...

603
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:10,064
or just a cross-eyed
thief and a loafer?

604
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:17,570
Would you hit my
son-in-law's brother?

605
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,053
- Who is he?
- Todger Fairmile of Balls Pond.

606
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:25,494
Him what won that 20 off the Japanese
wrestler at the music hall...

607
00:37:25,598 --> 00:37:30,394
for standing up again' him
for 17 minutes, 14 seconds.

608
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,521
I ain't no music hall wrestler.

609
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,379
- Can he box?
- Yes! And you can't.

610
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:40,298
What? I can't, can I?
What's that you say?

611
00:37:40,402 --> 00:37:43,009
Will you box Todger Fairmile
if I puts him on to you?

612
00:37:43,113 --> 00:37:45,928
I'll stand up to any man alive
if he was 10 Todger Fairmiles...

613
00:37:45,928 --> 00:37:49,056
but I don't set up to be a professional.

614
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:52,184
Here, what am I doing talking
to an old mutter like you for?

615
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:54,269
I'm goin' in there to fetch her out!

616
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:57,292
You're gonna be carried to the police
station on a stretcher, more likely.

617
00:37:57,396 --> 00:37:59,273
You mind what you're about.

618
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:02,818
- Why, haven't you heard that the major here
is a granddaughter of a earl? - Garn!

619
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:05,946
- You'll see.
- Well, I done nothing to her.

620
00:38:05,946 --> 00:38:08,031
Suppose she says you did?

621
00:38:08,031 --> 00:38:10,533
Who's going to believe you?

622
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:13,244
God, there ain't no
justice in this country.

623
00:38:13,348 --> 00:38:15,850
- I'm as good as her!
- Tell her so.

624
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:19,603
It's what a fool like you would do.

625
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:23,356
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

626
00:38:27,735 --> 00:38:30,446
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

627
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:34,303
Now then, since you've made friends
with us, we want to know all about you.

628
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,389
Name and trades, please.

629
00:38:36,493 --> 00:38:39,516
Peter Shirley, fitter.

630
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:42,853
Chucked out of me job two
months ago 'cause I was too old.

631
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:45,355
You'd pass still. Why
didn't you dye your hair?

632
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:49,942
Oh, I did. But me age came out at
the coroner's inquest on me daughter.

633
00:38:50,046 --> 00:38:53,174
- Steady?
- Teetotaler.

634
00:38:53,278 --> 00:38:57,553
Never out of a job before. Good
worker, and sent to the scrap heap.

635
00:38:57,657 --> 00:39:00,472
No matter. If you did
your part, God will do his.

636
00:39:00,576 --> 00:39:02,974
My religion's no concern
to nobody but meself.

637
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,685
I know. Secularist.

638
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:08,291
- Did I offer to deny it?
- Why should you?

639
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:11,211
My own father's a secularist, I think.

640
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:14,130
Our father... yours and mine...

641
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:16,215
fulfills himself in many ways...

642
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:19,343
and I daresay he knew what he was about
when he made a free thinker of you.

643
00:39:19,343 --> 00:39:23,304
So buck up, Peter. We can always
find a job for a steady man like you.

644
00:39:26,015 --> 00:39:29,039
- What's your name?
- What's it to you?

645
00:39:29,143 --> 00:39:32,688
Afraid to give his name. Any trade?

646
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:34,668
Who's afraid to give his name?

647
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:37,275
If you've got a charge to
bring against me, bring it!

648
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:40,611
My name's... Bill Walker.

649
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:42,905
Bill Walker.

650
00:39:42,905 --> 00:39:46,345
Oh, you're the man that little Jenny
Hill was praying for inside just now.

651
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,952
Who's Jenny Hill, and what
call's she got to pray for me?

652
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:51,245
I don't know. Perhaps it
was you that cut her lip.

653
00:39:51,245 --> 00:39:55,311
Yes, it was me what cut her
lip. I ain't afraid of you.

654
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:57,918
How can you be, since
you're not afraid of God?

655
00:39:58,126 --> 00:40:00,003
You're a brave man, Mr. Walker.

656
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:02,609
It takes some pluck for us
to carry on our work here...

657
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:06,258
but none of us dare lift a hand against a girl
like that for fear of her father in heaven.

658
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:09,178
I don't want none of
your cantin' jaw, see?

659
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:13,348
I suppose you think I came here to beg
from you, like this damaged lot here.

660
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:16,476
Not me. I don't want none
of your bread and scrape.

661
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,750
And I don't believe in your God neither,
no more than what you do yourself.

662
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:25,338
Oh, I beg your pardon for putting
your name down, Mr. Walker.

663
00:40:25,442 --> 00:40:28,569
I didn't understand. I'll strike it out.

664
00:40:28,674 --> 00:40:31,384
Here, you let my name alone. Ain't my
name good enough to go in your book?

665
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:33,991
Well, you see, there's not much
point in me putting your name down...

666
00:40:34,095 --> 00:40:36,076
if I can't do anything for you.

667
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,099
- What's your trade?
- That's no concern of yours.

668
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:42,123
Quite so. I'll put you down as...

669
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:46,397
the man who struck poor
little Jenny Hill in the mouth.

670
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:48,483
Now see here. I've had enough of this!

671
00:40:48,587 --> 00:40:50,881
- What did you come here for?
- I came for my girl, see?

672
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:53,487
I came to take her out of this
and to break her jaw for her.

673
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:56,093
You see, I was right about
your trade. What's her name?

674
00:40:56,198 --> 00:40:59,325
Her name? Mog Habbijam.
That's what her name is! Mog.

675
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,974
Mog Habbijam. Oh, she's gone to
Tower Bridge to our shelter there.

676
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:05,477
Has she? Then I'm going to
the Tower Bridge after her.

677
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,523
Here.

678
00:41:11,628 --> 00:41:14,338
Are you lying to me so
as you can get shod of me?

679
00:41:14,443 --> 00:41:16,841
I don't want to get shod of you.

680
00:41:16,945 --> 00:41:19,760
I want to keep you
here and save your soul.

681
00:41:19,864 --> 00:41:22,575
You better stay. You're going
to have a bad time today, Bill.

682
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:26,224
Who's gonna give it to me? You perhaps?

683
00:41:26,328 --> 00:41:28,830
Someone you don't believe in.

684
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,811
But you'll be glad afterwards.

685
00:41:30,915 --> 00:41:35,086
Yes. Well, I'm going to the Tower Bridge
to get out of the reach of your tongue.

686
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:40,716
And if I don't find Mog there...

687
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,990
I'll come back and I'll
do two years for you.

688
00:41:45,094 --> 00:41:46,971
So help me if I don't.

689
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:49,056
It's no use, Bill.

690
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,767
- She's got another bloke.
- What's that?

691
00:41:51,975 --> 00:41:54,582
He fell in love with her when
he saw her with her soul saved...

692
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:56,563
and her face clean and her hair washed.

693
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:59,586
Well, what did she wash it
for, the carroty cat? It's red.

694
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:04,382
It's quite lovely now because she wears
a new look in her eyes to go with it.

695
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:06,467
It's a pity you're too late, Bill.

696
00:42:06,571 --> 00:42:09,282
The new bloke's put your
nose right out of joint.

697
00:42:09,491 --> 00:42:13,348
I'll put his nose out of joint for him!
Not that I care a curse for her, mind that.

698
00:42:13,452 --> 00:42:17,727
But I'll teach her to drop me as if I was
dead, and I'll teach him to meddle with my Judy.

699
00:42:17,831 --> 00:42:21,376
- What's his bleeding name?
- Sergeant Todger Fairmile.

700
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,087
I'll go with him, miss. I
want to see them two meet.

701
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:26,693
And I'll take him to the
infirmary when it's over.

702
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:32,323
Here. Is, uh... Is that him
what you were speaking of?

703
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,721
- That's him.
- Him what wrestled with the Jap?

704
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:39,204
That's him. He's given up fighting for religion,
so he's a bit fresh for want of exercise.

705
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:42,332
But he'll be very glad
to see you. Come along.

706
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:46,189
- Here. What's his
weight? - Fourteen-five.

707
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:48,796
Go and talk to him,
Bill. He'll convert you.

708
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,506
He'll convert your head
into a mashed potato.

709
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:55,155
I ain't afraid of him.
I ain't afraid of nobody.

710
00:42:57,345 --> 00:42:59,326
But he can lick me.

711
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,121
She's done me.

712
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:08,500
You ain't going?

713
00:43:08,604 --> 00:43:10,585
I thought not.

714
00:43:12,775 --> 00:43:15,694
- Jenny. Jenny!
- Yes, Major?

715
00:43:15,798 --> 00:43:17,779
Send Rummy Mitchens
out here to clear away.

716
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:20,803
- Oh, I think she's afraid.
- Nonsense. She'll do as she's told.

717
00:43:20,907 --> 00:43:23,722
Rummy! Rummy, the major
says you must come.

718
00:43:23,722 --> 00:43:26,849
Oh, all rightl I'm coming then.

719
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:29,977
Poor little Jenny. Are you tired?

720
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:32,584
- Does it hurt?
- No, it's all right now. It's nothing.

721
00:43:32,688 --> 00:43:34,877
But as hard as he could hit, I expect.

722
00:43:36,024 --> 00:43:39,048
Poor Bill. You don't feel
angry with him, do you?

723
00:43:39,152 --> 00:43:41,341
Oh, no, no. Indeed I don't, Major.

724
00:43:41,445 --> 00:43:43,739
Bless his poor heart.

725
00:43:43,843 --> 00:43:45,720
Now, come on, Rummy. Bustle.

726
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:49,161
Take in these mugs and plates to be washed
and throw those crumbs about for the birds.

727
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:51,767
There ain't got to be no crumbs.

728
00:43:51,871 --> 00:43:54,790
This ain't the time to
waste good bread on birds!

729
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,084
Major. Majorl

730
00:44:03,548 --> 00:44:06,050
- Major Barbara!
- Well, my dear.

731
00:44:06,154 --> 00:44:08,344
Hello, Papa. So you kept your promise.

732
00:44:08,448 --> 00:44:13,348
I'll get the law on you, you flat-eared,
pig-nosed potwallopper, you...

733
00:44:13,557 --> 00:44:15,433
if she'd let me!

734
00:44:15,538 --> 00:44:18,561
You're no gentleman, you ain't,
to hit a lady in the face!

735
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,731
Here. In with ya, before ya
get yourself into more trouble.

736
00:44:22,836 --> 00:44:27,006
Ha! I ain't never had the pleasure
of being introduced to you...

737
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,404
as I can remember.

738
00:44:29,612 --> 00:44:32,323
- Welcome to the shelter, sir.
- Look at the old beaver!

739
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:38,578
- What's the matter?
- Don't talk to me, you hear?

740
00:44:38,683 --> 00:44:40,976
You leave me alone, or
I'll do you a mischief.

741
00:44:41,081 --> 00:44:43,896
- I ain't dirt under your feet anyhow.
- Don't you be afeared.

742
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,606
You ain't such prime company as
you need expect to be sought after.

743
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:49,943
- Get out, will you!
- Oh, there you are, Mr. Shirley.

744
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:53,175
This is my father. I told you
he was a secularist, didn't I?

745
00:44:53,383 --> 00:44:55,260
Perhaps you'll be able
to comfort one another.

746
00:44:55,364 --> 00:44:59,221
A secularist? Not the least in the world.
On the contrary, I'm a confirmed mystic.

747
00:44:59,326 --> 00:45:01,515
I'm sorry. By the way, Papa...

748
00:45:01,724 --> 00:45:04,539
what is your religion in case
I have to introduce you again?

749
00:45:04,643 --> 00:45:07,666
My religion? My dear, I'm a
millionaire. That's my religion.

750
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:11,732
Then I'm afraid you and Mr. Shirley won't
be able to comfort one another after all.

751
00:45:11,837 --> 00:45:14,234
You're not a millionaire,
are you, Peter?

752
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:16,320
No. And proud of it.

753
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,030
Poverty, my friend, isn't
a thing to be proud of.

754
00:45:19,135 --> 00:45:21,324
Who made your millions for you?

755
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:23,930
Me and my like.

756
00:45:24,035 --> 00:45:27,684
What kept us poor? Keeping you rich!

757
00:45:27,788 --> 00:45:31,333
I wouldn't have your conscience,
not for all your income!

758
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:36,024
And I wouldn't have your income, not
for all your conscience, Mr. Shirley.

759
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:40,090
You wouldn't think he was
my father, would you, Peter?

760
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:45,095
Will you go into the kitchen
and lend the lasses a hand?

761
00:45:46,763 --> 00:45:49,682
Oh, yes, I... I'm in their
debt for a meal, ain't I?

762
00:45:49,786 --> 00:45:53,018
No, not because you're in their
debt, but for love of them, Peter.

763
00:45:53,122 --> 00:45:55,103
For love of them.

764
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:58,440
There now, don't stare
at me. In with you.

765
00:45:58,544 --> 00:46:01,359
And give that conscience
of yours a holiday.

766
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:05,842
Oh, never mind me, my dear.

767
00:46:05,946 --> 00:46:08,865
You just go about your work
and let me watch it for a while.

768
00:46:08,865 --> 00:46:10,846
Very well, Papa.

769
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,704
For instance, what's the matter
with this outpatient over here?

770
00:46:15,851 --> 00:46:18,978
Oh, we'll cure him
in no time. Just wait.

771
00:46:34,513 --> 00:46:38,787
It would be nice just to stamp on Mog
Habbijam's face, wouldn't it, Bill?

772
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:41,498
It's a lie. I never said so!

773
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,189
- Who told you what was in my mind?
- Only your new friend.

774
00:46:46,294 --> 00:46:49,109
- What new friend?
- The devil, Bill.

775
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:51,611
When he gets round people, they
get miserable, just like you.

776
00:46:51,715 --> 00:46:54,739
- I ain't miserable. - Well, if you're
happy, why don't you look happy, as we do?

777
00:46:54,843 --> 00:46:58,388
I'm happy enough, I tell ya.
Why can't you leave me alone?

778
00:46:58,492 --> 00:47:01,828
What have I done to you? I ain't
smashed your face in, have I?

779
00:47:01,932 --> 00:47:05,060
- It's not me that's getting at you, Bill.
- Who else is it?

780
00:47:05,164 --> 00:47:08,605
Somebody that doesn't intend you
to smash women's faces, I suppose.

781
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:11,524
Somebody, or something, that
wants to make a man of you.

782
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:16,007
Make a man of me? Ain't I a
man, eh? Who says I'm not a man?

783
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:18,926
Well, there's a man in
you somewhere, I suppose.

784
00:47:18,926 --> 00:47:21,637
But why did he let you go and
smash little Jenny Hill's face?

785
00:47:21,637 --> 00:47:23,931
Now, that wasn't very
manly of him, was it?

786
00:47:24,035 --> 00:47:27,788
Have done with it, I tell you! Chuck it! I'm
sick of your Jenny Hill and her silly face!

787
00:47:27,892 --> 00:47:29,769
Then why do you keep thinking about it?

788
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:32,584
Why does it keep coming up
against you in your mind?

789
00:47:32,688 --> 00:47:34,982
You're not getting
converted, are you, Bill?

790
00:47:34,982 --> 00:47:37,693
- Not me! Not likely!
- That's the spirit!

791
00:47:37,797 --> 00:47:40,925
Hold out against it. Put out your
strength. Don't let us get you cheap.

792
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:43,739
Todger Fairmile said he wrestled
against his salvation harder...

793
00:47:43,844 --> 00:47:46,137
than he ever wrestled with
the Jap at the music hall.

794
00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:48,431
He gave in to the Jap when
his arm was going to break...

795
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:51,559
but he didn't give in to his salvation
till his heart was going to break.

796
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:55,103
Oh, perhaps you'll escape that. You
haven't any heart, have you, Bill?

797
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:57,710
Why ain't I got a heart,
same as what anybody else has?

798
00:47:57,918 --> 00:48:02,297
Well, a man with a heart wouldn't have
smashed poor little Jenny Hill's face, would he?

799
00:48:02,402 --> 00:48:06,780
Leave me alone, will ya?
Have I ever meddled with you?

800
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:10,429
Naggin' and provokin' me like this!

801
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:14,495
It's your soul that's
hurting you, Bill, and not me.

802
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,789
We've been through it all ourselves.

803
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:21,168
Come with us, Bill, to brave manhood
on earth and eternal glory in heaven.

804
00:48:21,272 --> 00:48:23,149
Come.

805
00:48:25,651 --> 00:48:27,632
Oh, there you are, Dolly.

806
00:48:27,736 --> 00:48:31,489
I want to introduce a new
friend of mine, Mr. Bill Walker.

807
00:48:31,698 --> 00:48:37,328
Bill, this is my bloke, Mr. Cusins.

808
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:40,351
- What? Going to marry him?
- Yes.

809
00:48:40,455 --> 00:48:42,958
Heaven help him. Heaven help him.

810
00:48:43,062 --> 00:48:44,938
Why? Don't you think
he'll be happy with me?

811
00:48:45,043 --> 00:48:48,587
Well, I've only had to stand it for an
afternoon. He'll have to stand it for a lifetime.

812
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:52,028
That is a frightful reflection, Mr. Walker,
but I can't tear myself away from her.

813
00:48:52,132 --> 00:48:55,364
Well, I can. Here. Do you know where
I'm going to and what I'm gonna do?

814
00:48:55,468 --> 00:48:58,596
Yes. You're going to heaven, and you're coming
back here before the week's out to tell me so.

815
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,871
You lie. I'm going to Tower Bridge
to spit in Todger Fairmile's eye.

816
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,956
I bashed Jenny Hill's face in.

817
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,979
Well, now I'll get me own face bashed
and come back and show it to her.

818
00:49:08,084 --> 00:49:11,524
He'll hit me harder than what I
hit her. That will make us square.

819
00:49:11,524 --> 00:49:15,173
Is that fair, or is it not? You're
a gentleman. You ought to know.

820
00:49:15,277 --> 00:49:17,675
But two black eyes won't
make one white one, Bill.

821
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,220
Can't you never keep your mouth
shut? I asked the gentleman.

822
00:49:21,324 --> 00:49:24,035
Yes, I think you're right, Mr.
Walker. Yes, I should do it.

823
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:26,537
It's curious. It's exactly what
an ancient Greek would have done.

824
00:49:26,641 --> 00:49:28,414
But what good will it do?

825
00:49:28,518 --> 00:49:31,333
Well, it'll give Mr. Fairmile some exercise,
and it will satisfy Mr. Walker's soul.

826
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:33,210
There ain't no such thing as a soul.

827
00:49:33,418 --> 00:49:35,920
How can you tell whether I've got a
soul or not? You ain't never seen it.

828
00:49:36,025 --> 00:49:38,631
I've seen it hurting you
when you went against it.

829
00:49:38,735 --> 00:49:41,759
If you was my girl and took the
words out of my mouth like that...

830
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:45,720
I'd give you something
you'd feel hurting, I would.

831
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:48,014
You take my tip, mate.

832
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:51,872
Stop her jaw, or you'll
die afore your time.

833
00:49:51,976 --> 00:49:54,687
Wore out, that's what you'll be.

834
00:49:55,938 --> 00:49:57,814
Wore out.

835
00:49:59,482 --> 00:50:01,568
- I wonder.
- Dolly!

836
00:50:01,672 --> 00:50:04,070
Yes, my dear, it's very
wearing being in love with you.

837
00:50:04,278 --> 00:50:06,780
If it lasts, I quite
think I shall die young.

838
00:50:07,823 --> 00:50:09,700
Should you mind?

839
00:50:09,908 --> 00:50:11,785
Not in the least.

840
00:50:13,661 --> 00:50:17,206
- Well.
- Oh, Papa! We've not forgotten you.

841
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,187
- We're ready, miss.
- Yes, I'm coming, Snobby.

842
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,585
Now, Dolly, explain the place to Papa...

843
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:24,296
and don't get up to
any mischief, you two.

844
00:50:27,006 --> 00:50:28,779
Whoa.

845
00:50:28,883 --> 00:50:32,428
Once the rowdiest pub in the
district. Barbara has converted it.

846
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:35,764
- She's quite original in her methods.
- Barbara Undershaft would be.

847
00:50:35,868 --> 00:50:37,849
Her inspiration comes
from within herself.

848
00:50:38,892 --> 00:50:41,394
It's the Undershaft inheritance.

849
00:50:41,498 --> 00:50:43,688
I shall hand on my torch to my daughter.

850
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:46,294
She shall make my converts
and preach my gospel.

851
00:50:46,398 --> 00:50:48,692
- What, money and gunpowder?
- Yes, money and gunpowder.

852
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:52,132
Freedom and power, command
of life and command of death.

853
00:50:52,237 --> 00:50:55,364
This is extremely
interesting, Mr. Undershaft.

854
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,762
- Of course, you know you're mad.
- And you?

855
00:50:57,867 --> 00:51:00,160
Oh, mad as a hatter.

856
00:51:00,264 --> 00:51:03,079
You're welcome to my secret,
now I've discovered yours.

857
00:51:03,184 --> 00:51:05,999
I'm astonished. Can a
madman make a cannon?

858
00:51:06,103 --> 00:51:08,814
Would anyone else but
a madman make them?

859
00:51:08,918 --> 00:51:10,794
And now, question for question.

860
00:51:10,899 --> 00:51:14,339
Can a sane woman make a man of
a waster, or a woman of a worm?

861
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:17,258
Are there two mad people, or
three, in this shelter today?

862
00:51:17,467 --> 00:51:19,344
You mean Barbara is as mad as we are?

863
00:51:19,552 --> 00:51:22,054
My dear professor, let's call
things by their proper names.

864
00:51:22,158 --> 00:51:26,746
I am a millionaire. You're a Greek
scholar. Barbara is a savior of souls.

865
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,812
What have we three to do with the
common mob of slaves and idolaters?

866
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:34,357
Take care. Barbara's in love
with the common people. So am I.

867
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:37,380
Have you never felt the
romance of that love?

868
00:51:37,484 --> 00:51:41,967
Romance?

869
00:51:42,072 --> 00:51:45,512
Have you ever been in love
with poverty, like St. Francis?

870
00:51:45,616 --> 00:51:48,536
You ever been in love
with dirt, like St. Simeon?

871
00:51:48,536 --> 00:51:51,038
Have you ever been in love
with disease and suffering...

872
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:53,748
like our nurses and philanthropists?

873
00:51:53,853 --> 00:51:56,459
Such passions are unnatural.

874
00:51:56,668 --> 00:51:58,544
This love of the common people...

875
00:51:58,753 --> 00:52:03,027
may please an earl's granddaughter
and a university professor...

876
00:52:03,132 --> 00:52:07,198
but I've been a poor
man and a common man...

877
00:52:07,302 --> 00:52:10,221
and it has no romance for me.

878
00:52:10,325 --> 00:52:13,557
Leave it to the poor to pretend
that poverty is a blessing.

879
00:52:13,766 --> 00:52:15,642
We know better than that.

880
00:52:15,747 --> 00:52:18,874
We three must stand together
above the common people...

881
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:21,689
and help their children
to climb up beside us.

882
00:52:21,794 --> 00:52:25,443
Barbara must belong to us,
not to the Salvation Army.

883
00:52:25,547 --> 00:52:28,987
Well, I can only say that if you think you
can get her away from the Salvation Army...

884
00:52:29,092 --> 00:52:31,907
by talking to her as you've been talking
to me, then you don't know Barbara.

885
00:52:32,011 --> 00:52:34,513
My friend, I never
ask for what I can buy.

886
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:36,911
Do I understand you to imply
that you can buy Barbara?

887
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,517
No, but I can buy the Salvation Army.

888
00:52:39,622 --> 00:52:41,707
Tell that to Barbara, if you dare.

889
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:45,252
I've hardly ever seen them so much moved
as they were by your confession, Mr. Price.

890
00:52:45,356 --> 00:52:48,588
I could almost be glad of me past wickedness
if it'd help to keep others straight.

891
00:52:48,692 --> 00:52:51,194
Oh, it will, Snobby. It will.

892
00:52:53,696 --> 00:52:57,554
Oh, Father. We've just had
the most wonderful experience.

893
00:52:57,658 --> 00:53:00,786
Snobby Price drew our
biggest crowd for months.

894
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:02,975
Jenny. How much?

895
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,060
Four and 10 pence, Major.

896
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,084
Oh, Snobby. If you'd given your
poor mother just one more kick...

897
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:10,169
we should have got the
whole five shillings.

898
00:53:10,273 --> 00:53:12,671
If she heard you say that,
miss, she'd be sorry I didn't.

899
00:53:12,775 --> 00:53:16,007
Oh, what a joy it will be to
her when she hears I'm saved.

900
00:53:18,405 --> 00:53:20,699
Shall I contribute the
odd tuppence, Barbara?

901
00:53:20,908 --> 00:53:22,784
The millionaire's mite, hmm?

902
00:53:22,888 --> 00:53:24,661
How did you make that tuppence?

903
00:53:24,765 --> 00:53:28,414
As usual, my dear. By selling
cannons, torpedoes and submarines.

904
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,916
Put it back in your pocket.

905
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:35,712
You can't buy your salvation here
for tuppence. You must work it out.

906
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:39,674
Isn't tuppence enough? I could
afford a little more, if you press me.

907
00:53:39,778 --> 00:53:42,072
Two million millions
would not be enough.

908
00:53:42,176 --> 00:53:44,887
Your kind of money's
no use. Take it away.

909
00:53:45,929 --> 00:53:49,266
Dolly, you must write another
letter to the papers for me.

910
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,976
- Oh! - I know you don't like it,
but it must be done.

911
00:53:52,185 --> 00:53:54,895
I'll get it.

912
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,753
The general says we've got to close
this shelter if we can't get more money.

913
00:53:58,857 --> 00:54:02,402
I've forced the collections at the
meetings until I'm ashamed, don't I, Snobby?

914
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,321
Oh, it's a fair treat to see
the way you work it, Major.

915
00:54:05,425 --> 00:54:08,866
The way you got 'em up from three-and-six
to four-and-10 with that hymn...

916
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:10,847
penny by penny and verse by verse...

917
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:12,619
was a caution.

918
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:15,955
Not a cheap jack on Mile End
Waste could have touched her at it.

919
00:54:15,955 --> 00:54:20,334
- Excuse me, sir.
- I wish we could do without it.

920
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:23,670
What use are these hatfuls
of pennies and ha'pennies?

921
00:54:23,775 --> 00:54:27,736
We want thousands, tens of
thousands, hundreds of thousands.

922
00:54:28,883 --> 00:54:32,220
I want to convert people, not to
be always begging for the Army...

923
00:54:32,324 --> 00:54:35,764
in a way I'd sooner
die than beg for myself.

924
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:38,266
But how are we to feed them?

925
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:43,167
I can't talk religion to a man
with bodily hunger in his eyes.

926
00:54:43,271 --> 00:54:46,086
- Oh, it's frightful.
- Oh, Major, dear.

927
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,692
Now, don't comfort me,
Jenny. It's all right.

928
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:50,777
- We'll get the money.
- How?

929
00:54:50,882 --> 00:54:52,862
By praying for it, of course.

930
00:54:52,862 --> 00:54:55,573
It was the general. She's coming to
march with us to our big meeting...

931
00:54:55,677 --> 00:54:58,492
and she's very anxious to meet
you for some reason or other.

932
00:54:58,492 --> 00:55:01,829
- Perhaps she'll convert you.
- My dear, I shall be delighted.

933
00:55:28,727 --> 00:55:31,438
- Half a bitter, and put some gin
in it. - Dog's nose. Right-o, mate.

934
00:55:44,991 --> 00:55:46,868
Here you go.

935
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:57,919
- You all know who I am.
- No. Who are ya?

936
00:55:58,023 --> 00:56:01,255
Todger Fairmile, champion
boxer, wrestler and swimmer.

937
00:56:01,464 --> 00:56:03,757
Good old Todger.

938
00:56:03,757 --> 00:56:06,155
Some of you have put
money on me and won it.

939
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:09,075
- And some of us have lost it.
- Right.

940
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:11,264
You'll lose no more money that way.

941
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:15,017
I may ask you for a penny or two presently
to put in the young lass'tambourine.

942
00:56:15,017 --> 00:56:19,188
I've been promoted sergeant
in the Salvation Army!

943
00:56:19,396 --> 00:56:21,273
Yes. It's easier than
fighting, ain't it?

944
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:25,651
No, Corky, it's not easier,
but it's ever so much happier.

945
00:56:25,756 --> 00:56:28,571
And who told you I'd given up fighting?

946
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:32,637
I was born a fighter, and
please God, I'll die a fighter.

947
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:36,599
But the ring was too small
for a champion like me.

948
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:39,205
It was no satisfaction to me
to knock out some poor fellow...

949
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:41,499
who'd been set up against
me for a purse of money...

950
00:56:41,603 --> 00:56:43,584
or hold his shoulders down on the mat.

951
00:56:43,688 --> 00:56:47,128
It was too easy, and there was
no future in it for either of us.

952
00:56:47,233 --> 00:56:49,422
You don't say so.

953
00:56:49,526 --> 00:56:52,341
One day I gave an exhibition
spar for the benefit of charity.

954
00:56:52,446 --> 00:56:55,990
Our general was there, and
I was introduced to her.

955
00:56:56,095 --> 00:56:59,222
She said to me...
I was a wonderful young man.

956
00:57:01,412 --> 00:57:04,018
And she asked me, was I saved?

957
00:57:04,122 --> 00:57:08,918
"No," says I, "but I can go 15 rounds with
Tommy Farr if you'd like to put up the money."

958
00:57:11,212 --> 00:57:16,008
"Of course you can," she said,
"but can you go, not 15 rounds...

959
00:57:16,112 --> 00:57:21,012
but eternity with the
devil, for no money at all?"

960
00:57:21,116 --> 00:57:23,619
Well, I tried to make light of it...

961
00:57:24,661 --> 00:57:26,746
but it stuck...

962
00:57:26,955 --> 00:57:29,978
and a week later, I took the
count for the first time...

963
00:57:30,082 --> 00:57:31,959
and I joined up.

964
00:57:32,063 --> 00:57:35,295
And now I fight the devil all the time.

965
00:57:35,295 --> 00:57:38,110
And I'll say this for him, Corkey.

966
00:57:38,215 --> 00:57:41,759
He fights fairer and harder
than some champs we've tackled.

967
00:57:41,968 --> 00:57:44,261
But God is against him...

968
00:57:44,366 --> 00:57:48,432
and in that sign, we shall conquer!

969
00:57:49,474 --> 00:57:51,872
Now, shall we have another hymn?

970
00:57:56,564 --> 00:58:00,109
- You're Todger Fairmile, are ya?
- Sergeant Fairmile at your service.

971
00:58:00,317 --> 00:58:02,924
You're the one what took
my girl away, are you?

972
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:06,156
- Name of Mog Habbijam.
- Bill! Don't you know me?

973
00:58:06,364 --> 00:58:10,639
Blimey! It's her voice. Here. Here,
what have you done to yourself?

974
00:58:10,743 --> 00:58:13,871
- What's he done to you? - Sergeant,
it's Bill Walker that was my bloke.

975
00:58:13,975 --> 00:58:15,956
And I'm so changed, he doesn't know me.

976
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,458
We'll make the same change in you, Bill.

977
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,524
Is that what you've come for?

978
00:58:22,628 --> 00:58:26,277
I've come to get my face changed right enough,
and you're the one what's gonna change it.

979
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:28,675
Take that.

980
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:30,969
Now here's my jaw.

981
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:33,888
Go on. Hit it. Hit it
your best. Break it!

982
00:58:39,935 --> 00:58:44,001
Oh, that I should be found worthy to
be spit upon for the Gospel's sake.

983
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,982
Hit it!

984
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,318
- Glory, hallelujah!
- Glory, hallelujahl

985
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:52,759
Bill, you shouldn't have done thatl
You've spit in the face of your salvationl

986
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:56,825
Listen here, you. Do you know a slip of a girl
named Jenny Hill, one of your Limehouse lasses?

987
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,910
We do. Has she converted you?

988
00:58:59,014 --> 00:59:02,350
Keep your mind off this conversion
business and listen to what I'm sayin'.

989
00:59:02,454 --> 00:59:04,644
I broke Jenny Hill's jaw this morning.

990
00:59:04,748 --> 00:59:07,042
Oh, no, you didn't, Bill.

991
00:59:07,146 --> 00:59:11,004
'Tain't so easy to break her jaw as you
think. You haven't got the punch for it.

992
00:59:11,108 --> 00:59:14,236
You hit her in the face like
the fine, bold fellow you are...

993
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:17,050
and now you want to forgive
yourself and you find you can't...

994
00:59:17,155 --> 00:59:20,074
unless I give you a blow
back harder than you can hit.

995
00:59:20,178 --> 00:59:24,766
Friends, this man is on
the way to his salvation.

996
00:59:24,974 --> 00:59:27,476
Let us all pray for him.

997
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,561
- Kneel down, Bill.
- Get out with ya!

998
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:32,272
- You will kneel down, brother.
- Get him on his knees.

999
00:59:32,376 --> 00:59:35,400
Here, you leave me alone!

1000
00:59:35,504 --> 00:59:37,798
What do you think I'm
made of, cast iron?

1001
00:59:40,091 --> 00:59:42,281
Brother, pray with us.

1002
00:59:42,385 --> 00:59:45,096
Dear Lord, break his stubborn spirit...

1003
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,285
but don't hurt his dear heart.

1004
00:59:47,389 --> 00:59:51,038
Never mind my dear
heart! How 'bout my ribs?

1005
00:59:51,247 --> 00:59:55,521
# Tell me the old, old story #

1006
00:59:55,626 --> 01:00:00,004
# Of unseen things above ##

1007
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:03,966
Major!

1008
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:05,947
Major?

1009
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:08,137
Major, that man's back again!

1010
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:10,222
- Who?
- The one that hit me!

1011
01:00:10,222 --> 01:00:13,141
Oh, I hope he's come back to join us!

1012
01:00:13,245 --> 01:00:15,122
- Well?
- Get out.

1013
01:00:15,226 --> 01:00:17,415
Hello, Bill. Back already?

1014
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,960
- Been talking ever since, have ya?
- Pretty nearly.

1015
01:00:21,064 --> 01:00:23,462
Has Todger paid you
out for poor Jenny's jaw?

1016
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:27,007
No, he ain't. You want to know
where the dirt come from, don't ya?

1017
01:00:27,111 --> 01:00:30,656
- Yes. - It come off the ground at Tower
Bridge, see. It got rubbed off by my shoulders.

1018
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,201
It's a pity it wasn't rubbed off by your
knees. That would have done you a lot of good.

1019
01:00:34,305 --> 01:00:36,912
I was saving another
man's knees at the time.

1020
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,665
Mind, I did what I said
I'd do... spit in his eye.

1021
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:44,522
And Mog said, "Glory, hallelujah!"
and he called me brother...

1022
01:00:44,627 --> 01:00:48,901
and darned me as if I was a kid and he was
me mother washing me on a Saturday night.

1023
01:00:49,005 --> 01:00:50,882
Kneelin' on me head, he was!

1024
01:00:50,986 --> 01:00:53,906
Fourteen stone five, prayin'
comfortable with me as a carpet!

1025
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:57,346
Served you right,
Bill! Oh, I wish I'd been there!

1026
01:00:57,450 --> 01:01:00,369
Yes, you've had got an extra
bit of talk on me, wouldn't ya?

1027
01:01:00,474 --> 01:01:02,350
- Yes.
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Walker.

1028
01:01:02,455 --> 01:01:05,791
Don't you go bein' sorry for
me. What I done I'll pay for.

1029
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:08,397
I tried to get me own
jaw broke to satisfy you.

1030
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:10,482
- Oh, no!
- I tell you, I did!

1031
01:01:10,482 --> 01:01:14,548
And if I can't satisfy you
one way, then I can another.

1032
01:01:14,653 --> 01:01:17,155
Listen.

1033
01:01:17,155 --> 01:01:19,136
Here's my last quid.

1034
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:24,244
Now take it, and let's have no more of your
forgivin' and pryin' and your major jawing at me!

1035
01:01:24,349 --> 01:01:27,059
Oh, no, I couldn't take it, Mr. Walker.

1036
01:01:27,164 --> 01:01:30,604
But if you would give a shilling
or two of it to poor Rummy Mitchens.

1037
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:32,793
You really did hurt her, and she's old.

1038
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:36,547
Not me. Not likely. I'd give her
another as soon as look at her.

1039
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:40,091
She ain't forgiven me. Not much.

1040
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,783
It's this Christian game of yours
I won't have played up against me!

1041
01:01:44,887 --> 01:01:46,764
I won't have it, I tell you!

1042
01:01:46,868 --> 01:01:50,413
So take your money and stop throwing
your silly bashed face up against mine!

1043
01:01:50,517 --> 01:01:53,436
Major, may I take a
little of it for the Army?

1044
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:56,877
No. The Army's not to be bought.

1045
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:04,279
Bill, we want your soul,
and we'll take nothing less.

1046
01:02:04,383 --> 01:02:08,032
I know. Me and my few bob
ain't good enough for you.

1047
01:02:08,137 --> 01:02:10,535
You're an earl's granddaughter, you are.

1048
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:12,724
Nothing less than a hundred
pound would do for you.

1049
01:02:12,828 --> 01:02:16,373
Come, Barbara. You could do a great
deal of good with a hundred pounds.

1050
01:02:16,373 --> 01:02:19,709
If you'll set this gentleman's
mind at ease by taking his pound...

1051
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:21,690
I'll give you the other 99.

1052
01:02:21,794 --> 01:02:24,192
Oh, Papa, you're too extravagant.

1053
01:02:24,297 --> 01:02:28,571
Bill offers 20 pieces of silver.
All you need offer is the other 10.

1054
01:02:28,675 --> 01:02:32,741
That will make the standard price
to buy anybody who's for sale.

1055
01:02:32,846 --> 01:02:36,390
Well, I'm not and the Army is not.

1056
01:02:36,495 --> 01:02:42,229
Bill, you'll never have another quiet
moment until you come round to us.

1057
01:02:42,229 --> 01:02:44,940
You can't stand out
against your salvation.

1058
01:02:45,044 --> 01:02:49,631
I can't stand out against music hall
wrestlers and artful-tongued women.

1059
01:02:49,735 --> 01:02:52,550
I've offered to pay,
and I can't do no more.

1060
01:02:52,655 --> 01:02:56,095
There it is. Take it or leave it.

1061
01:02:56,199 --> 01:02:58,076
- The generall
- The generall

1062
01:02:58,284 --> 01:03:01,725
- - Mr. Walker,
apparently we're in the same boat.

1063
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:05,061
Perhaps we can help each other.
You'd better come and see me.

1064
01:03:05,165 --> 01:03:08,710
- I don't want none of your charity. - It's
not charity I'm offering you. It's work.

1065
01:03:11,004 --> 01:03:15,278
My dear, it was an inspiration to
have asked your father here today.

1066
01:03:15,383 --> 01:03:18,719
God needs him, Major. God needs him.

1067
01:03:25,913 --> 01:03:29,249
This is my father, General.
Try what you can do with him.

1068
01:03:29,353 --> 01:03:33,836
He won't listen to me because he remembers
what a fool I was when I was a baby.

1069
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:37,381
Have you been shown over the shelter, Mr.
Undershaft? You know the work we're doing, of course.

1070
01:03:37,485 --> 01:03:39,362
The whole nation knows it, madam.

1071
01:03:39,466 --> 01:03:41,343
No, sir, the whole
nation does not know it...

1072
01:03:41,447 --> 01:03:44,366
or we should not be crippled
as we are for want of money...

1073
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:47,390
to carry our work through the
length and breadth of the land.

1074
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:51,560
Let me tell you that there would have been
trouble this winter in London but for us.

1075
01:03:51,664 --> 01:03:53,854
- You really think so?
- I know it.

1076
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:58,754
I remember last year when all you rich gentlemen
hardened your hearts against the cry of the poor.

1077
01:03:58,754 --> 01:04:01,256
They demonstrated outside
your clubs in Piccadilly.

1078
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,279
And actually walked into
the Ritz and demanded a meal.

1079
01:04:04,384 --> 01:04:05,947
I remember very well.

1080
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:10,952
Well, won't you help us to get at the
people? They won't demonstrate then.

1081
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,141
Come here, my man.

1082
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:17,937
Let me show you to this gentleman.

1083
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:20,231
You remember the epidemic
of window smashing?

1084
01:04:20,335 --> 01:04:22,212
Remember it? I was
the ringleader, ma'am.

1085
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:24,922
- Would you break windows now?
- Oh, no, ma'am.

1086
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,424
The windows of heaven
have been opened to me.

1087
01:04:27,529 --> 01:04:30,448
I know now that the rich man
is a poor sinner like meself.

1088
01:04:30,448 --> 01:04:32,533
Begging your pardon, ma'am.

1089
01:04:32,637 --> 01:04:35,452
Mr. Price, your mother's asking for you.

1090
01:04:35,557 --> 01:04:37,537
She's heard about your confession.

1091
01:04:37,642 --> 01:04:40,561
Go, my friend. Go to your
mother and pray for her.

1092
01:04:40,665 --> 01:04:42,750
You could come through
the kitchen, Mr. Price.

1093
01:04:42,855 --> 01:04:45,774
I couldn't face her now, ma'am, not
with the weight of me sins fresh on me.

1094
01:04:45,878 --> 01:04:50,048
Tell her she'll find her son at
home waiting for her in prayer.

1095
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:55,782
You see how we take the anger and bitterness
out of their hearts, Mr. Undershaft?

1096
01:04:55,887 --> 01:04:57,659
I do indeed, madam.

1097
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,691
Who's been bashin' whose mother?

1098
01:05:16,634 --> 01:05:19,032
Barbara. Jenny.

1099
01:05:19,136 --> 01:05:22,055
I have good news. Most wonderful news.

1100
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,036
- Our prayers have been answered.
- Yes.

1101
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,538
Have we got enough money
to keep the shelter open?

1102
01:05:26,643 --> 01:05:30,083
I hope we shall have enough money
to keep all the shelters open.

1103
01:05:30,187 --> 01:05:32,794
Lord Saxmundham has promised us 50,000.

1104
01:05:32,898 --> 01:05:34,462
- Hooray!
- Glory!

1105
01:05:34,566 --> 01:05:36,026
- If...
- If what?

1106
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:39,466
If five other gentlemen
will give 10,000 each...

1107
01:05:39,571 --> 01:05:41,760
to make it up to the hundred thousand.

1108
01:05:41,864 --> 01:05:44,679
But who is Lord Saxmundham?
I never heard of him.

1109
01:05:44,783 --> 01:05:47,494
A new creation, my dear. Did you
ever hear of Sir Horace Bodger?

1110
01:05:47,598 --> 01:05:53,020
Bodger? Do you mean the
distiller? Bodger's Whiskey?

1111
01:05:53,124 --> 01:05:56,877
Yes, that's the man. He's one of the
greatest of our public benefactors.

1112
01:05:56,981 --> 01:06:00,943
He restored the cathedral at Hakington.
They made him a baronet for that.

1113
01:06:01,048 --> 01:06:05,531
He gave half a million to the funds of his
party. They made him a viscount for that!

1114
01:06:05,635 --> 01:06:09,180
- What'll they give him for the 50,000?
- There's nothing left to give him.

1115
01:06:09,284 --> 01:06:12,307
So the 50,000, I imagine,
is to save his soul.

1116
01:06:12,412 --> 01:06:14,497
Heaven grant it may.

1117
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:18,250
Oh, Mr. Undershaft, you
have some very rich friends.

1118
01:06:18,354 --> 01:06:21,273
Can't you help us
towards the other 50,000?

1119
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:24,922
We're going to hold a great meeting
this evening at the Albert Hall.

1120
01:06:24,922 --> 01:06:29,718
If I could only announce that one gentleman
had come forward to support Lord Saxmundham...

1121
01:06:29,718 --> 01:06:31,803
others would follow.

1122
01:06:31,908 --> 01:06:35,974
Don't you know somebody?
Couldn't you? Wouldn't you?

1123
01:06:36,078 --> 01:06:38,789
Oh, think of those poor
people, Mr. Undershaft.

1124
01:06:38,893 --> 01:06:44,002
Think of how much it means to them
and how little to a great man like you.

1125
01:06:44,106 --> 01:06:47,338
Madam, you are irresistible.
I can't disappoint you.

1126
01:06:47,442 --> 01:06:51,300
And I can't deny myself the
satisfaction of making Bodger pay up.

1127
01:06:51,404 --> 01:06:53,280
You shall have your 50,000.

1128
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:55,991
- Thank God.
- You don't thank me, madam?

1129
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:59,849
Oh, sir, don't try to be cynical.
Don't be ashamed of being a good man.

1130
01:06:59,953 --> 01:07:02,768
The Lord will bless you abundantly...

1131
01:07:02,872 --> 01:07:08,502
and our prayers will be like a strong
fortification around you all the days of your life.

1132
01:07:08,606 --> 01:07:11,942
You'll let me have the check to
show at the meeting, won't you?

1133
01:07:12,047 --> 01:07:15,174
- Uh, Mr. Duffin.
- Thank you. I prefer my own.

1134
01:07:49,058 --> 01:07:52,290
What price salvation now, eh?

1135
01:07:53,645 --> 01:07:56,148
Stop!

1136
01:07:56,252 --> 01:07:59,484
General, are you really
going to take this money?

1137
01:07:59,588 --> 01:08:02,612
- Why not, my dear?
- Why not?

1138
01:08:02,716 --> 01:08:05,218
Do you know what my father is?

1139
01:08:05,218 --> 01:08:09,701
Have you forgotten that Lord
Saxmundham is Bodger the whiskey man?

1140
01:08:09,805 --> 01:08:13,246
Don't you know that the worst thing I've
had to fight here is not the devil...

1141
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:15,748
but Bodger, Bodger, Bodger...

1142
01:08:15,852 --> 01:08:19,188
with his whiskey and his
distilleries and his tied houses!

1143
01:08:19,293 --> 01:08:21,065
Rotten drinkin' whiskey it is too.

1144
01:08:22,316 --> 01:08:26,382
Are you going to make this place
another tied house and ask me to keep it?

1145
01:08:26,486 --> 01:08:30,761
Dear Barbara, Lord Saxmundham has
a soul to be saved like any of us.

1146
01:08:32,325 --> 01:08:34,931
I know he has a soul to be saved.

1147
01:08:35,036 --> 01:08:39,519
Let him come down here, and I'll do
my best to help him to his salvation.

1148
01:08:39,623 --> 01:08:44,836
But he wants to send his check down here
to buy us and go on being as wicked as ever.

1149
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:47,859
My dear Barbara, alcohol
is a very necessary article.

1150
01:08:47,963 --> 01:08:50,361
- It heals the sick.
- It does nothing of the sort.

1151
01:08:50,466 --> 01:08:52,342
Well, it makes life bearable...

1152
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:56,408
for millions of people who couldn't enjoy
their existence if they were quite sober.

1153
01:08:56,513 --> 01:08:59,849
It enables parliament to do
things at 11:00 at night...

1154
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:03,602
which no sane person would
do at 11:00 in the morning.

1155
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:08,189
Is it Bodger's fault if this
inestimable gift is deplorably abused...

1156
01:09:08,189 --> 01:09:11,213
by less than one percent of the poor?

1157
01:09:22,056 --> 01:09:25,600
Barbara, will there be
less drinking or more...

1158
01:09:25,705 --> 01:09:27,790
if all those poor souls we are saving...

1159
01:09:27,894 --> 01:09:31,022
come tomorrow and find the doors
of the shelter shut in their faces?

1160
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:33,837
Lord Saxmundham gives us
this money to stop drinking...

1161
01:09:33,941 --> 01:09:35,922
to take his own business from him.

1162
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,215
Rure self-sacrifice
on Bodger's part, clearly.

1163
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,092
Bless dear Bodger.

1164
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:43,637
I also, General, may claim
a little disinterestedness.

1165
01:09:43,741 --> 01:09:45,722
Think of my business.

1166
01:09:45,722 --> 01:09:48,433
Think of the widows and
orphans, the oceans of blood...

1167
01:09:48,641 --> 01:09:51,977
not one drop of which is
shed in a really just cause.

1168
01:09:52,082 --> 01:09:53,958
All this makes money for me.

1169
01:09:54,063 --> 01:09:57,712
I'm never busier, never richer
than when the papers are full of it.

1170
01:09:57,816 --> 01:10:02,090
Well, it's your work to pitch peace
on earth and goodwill towards men.

1171
01:10:02,195 --> 01:10:05,844
Every convert you make
is a vote against war.

1172
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:08,763
Yet I give you this money...

1173
01:10:08,867 --> 01:10:13,142
to help hasten my own commercial ruin.

1174
01:10:13,246 --> 01:10:16,686
The millennium will be inaugurated by the
unselfishness of Undershaft and Bodger.

1175
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,980
Oh, be joyfull

1176
01:10:19,084 --> 01:10:23,359
Oh, what an infinite goodness
one finds in everything.

1177
01:10:23,463 --> 01:10:28,259
Who would have thought that any
good could come out of war and drink?

1178
01:10:28,363 --> 01:10:31,387
Oh, dearl How blessed,
how glorious it all isl

1179
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:33,263
A miraclel

1180
01:10:33,368 --> 01:10:38,893
Let us seize this unspeakable moment.
Let us march to the great meeting at once!

1181
01:10:41,812 --> 01:10:44,210
- Our shelter's saved!
- Hooray!

1182
01:10:44,315 --> 01:10:46,191
The Army's saved!

1183
01:10:46,295 --> 01:10:48,485
Bless the general!

1184
01:10:48,485 --> 01:10:50,570
Everybody's saved!

1185
01:10:50,674 --> 01:10:54,323
Glory, hallelujah! Glory, hallelujah!

1186
01:10:54,428 --> 01:10:56,930
On to the meeting! On!

1187
01:10:58,181 --> 01:11:02,038
Come on, let's go!

1188
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:07,460
Mr. Undershaft, have you ever seen 5,000 people
fall on their knees with one impulse and pray?

1189
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:09,545
Come with us to the meeting.

1190
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:13,507
Barbara shall tell them that the
Army is saved, and saved through you!

1191
01:11:13,611 --> 01:11:16,113
You shall carry the flag down
the first street, General.

1192
01:11:16,217 --> 01:11:20,179
Mr. Undershaft is a gifted trombonist. He
shall march with us, blasting us to high heaven!

1193
01:11:20,388 --> 01:11:22,681
Blow, Machiavelli, blow!

1194
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:25,600
I'll do my best. I could vamp
a bass if I knew the tune.

1195
01:11:25,705 --> 01:11:29,145
It's a wedding chorus from Donizetti's
operas, but we've converted it!

1196
01:11:29,249 --> 01:11:31,647
We convert everything here...

1197
01:11:31,752 --> 01:11:33,316
including Bodger!

1198
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,088
You remember the chorus?

1199
01:11:35,192 --> 01:11:39,050
"For thee, immense rejoicing!
Immenso giubilol Immenso giubilol"

1200
01:11:39,154 --> 01:11:41,031
# Rum-dum,
de-dum-dum #

1201
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:44,054
Dolly, you're breaking my heart.

1202
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:46,556
What's a broken heart more or less here?

1203
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:52,290
St. Undershaft and St. Bodger have descended,
the patron saints of peace and temperance!

1204
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:54,688
I am possessed!

1205
01:11:56,461 --> 01:12:00,944
Come, Barbara. I must have my dear
major to carry the flag with me.

1206
01:12:01,048 --> 01:12:02,925
Yes, yes, dear Major.

1207
01:12:03,029 --> 01:12:04,593
I can't come.

1208
01:12:04,697 --> 01:12:06,574
- Not come?
- Barbara.

1209
01:12:06,678 --> 01:12:09,597
Do you think I'm wrong
to take this money?

1210
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:12,203
No. God help you, you must.

1211
01:12:12,308 --> 01:12:14,601
You're saving the Army.

1212
01:12:14,601 --> 01:12:17,312
Go! Go, and may you
have a great meeting.

1213
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,397
But aren't you coming?

1214
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:25,340
No.

1215
01:12:25,444 --> 01:12:27,321
Barbara, what are you doing?

1216
01:12:27,425 --> 01:12:30,761
Major, you can't be going to leave us.

1217
01:12:33,576 --> 01:12:35,870
Father, come here.

1218
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:39,206
My dear...

1219
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:41,813
No, don't be frightened.

1220
01:12:41,917 --> 01:12:44,210
There.

1221
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:47,859
It's not much for 50,000, is it?

1222
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:51,404
Barbara, if you won't
come and pray with us...

1223
01:12:51,508 --> 01:12:53,385
promise me you'll pray for us.

1224
01:12:53,594 --> 01:12:55,470
I can't pray now.

1225
01:12:55,575 --> 01:12:57,451
Perhaps I shall never pray again.

1226
01:12:57,555 --> 01:12:59,432
- Barbara!
- Majorl

1227
01:12:59,536 --> 01:13:01,621
- I can't bear any more.
- Barbara!

1228
01:13:01,726 --> 01:13:03,602
Quick! March!

1229
01:13:03,707 --> 01:13:05,896
Come on, Machiavelli!

1230
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:11,422
I must go now, my dear.

1231
01:13:11,526 --> 01:13:14,341
You're overworked. You'll
be all right tomorrow.

1232
01:13:14,445 --> 01:13:16,530
We'll never lose you.

1233
01:13:16,635 --> 01:13:20,701
Now, Jenny, step out with
the old flag. Blood and fire!

1234
01:13:20,805 --> 01:13:22,681
Glory, hallelujahl

1235
01:13:22,786 --> 01:13:24,558
Glory, hallelujah!

1236
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:29,250
Hey, up there! "Immenso Giubilol"

1237
01:13:37,382 --> 01:13:39,363
Blood and fire!

1238
01:13:39,467 --> 01:13:41,343
My ducats and my daughter!

1239
01:13:41,448 --> 01:13:43,220
Money and gunpowder!

1240
01:13:45,305 --> 01:13:47,703
Drunkardness and murder.

1241
01:13:59,171 --> 01:14:01,882
My God...

1242
01:14:01,986 --> 01:14:04,906
why hast thou forsaken me?

1243
01:14:14,497 --> 01:14:16,687
What price salvation now?

1244
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:19,502
Don't you hit her when she's down.

1245
01:14:19,502 --> 01:14:24,819
She hit me when I was down. Why
shouldn't I get a bit of my own b...

1246
01:14:24,923 --> 01:14:28,468
Here, where's my money gone?

1247
01:14:28,676 --> 01:14:32,221
Blimey, if Jenny Hill
didn't take it after all.

1248
01:14:32,325 --> 01:14:34,723
You lie, you dirty blackguard!

1249
01:14:34,827 --> 01:14:38,059
Snobby Price pinched
it! I seen him do it!

1250
01:14:38,059 --> 01:14:39,623
What, stole my money?

1251
01:14:39,728 --> 01:14:42,647
Why didn't you call thief on
him, you silly old mucker you!

1252
01:14:42,751 --> 01:14:45,983
Served you right for
hitting me across the face.

1253
01:14:46,087 --> 01:14:48,381
That's cost you a pound, that has!

1254
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:52,030
I done ya! I got even with ya!

1255
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:55,158
I've had it out on ya!

1256
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:59,953
You can't afford to lose it, Bill.

1257
01:15:00,058 --> 01:15:02,039
I'll send it to you.

1258
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:05,062
Not if I was to starve for it.

1259
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:07,043
I ain't to be bought.

1260
01:15:07,251 --> 01:15:08,711
Ain't ya?

1261
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,777
You sell yourself to the
devil for a pint of beer.

1262
01:15:13,924 --> 01:15:18,303
So I would, and often have cheerful!

1263
01:15:18,407 --> 01:15:20,492
But she can't buy me.

1264
01:15:22,265 --> 01:15:25,184
You wanted my soul, did ya?

1265
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:27,165
Well, you ain't got it.

1266
01:15:27,269 --> 01:15:29,458
I nearly got it, Bill...

1267
01:15:29,563 --> 01:15:32,690
but we've sold it back
to you for 50,000.

1268
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:34,775
And dear at the moneyl

1269
01:15:34,775 --> 01:15:37,695
- No, it was worth more than money.
- It's no good.

1270
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:41,135
You can't get round me
now. I don't believe in it.

1271
01:15:42,803 --> 01:15:45,827
And I've seen today...

1272
01:15:46,035 --> 01:15:48,954
that I was right.

1273
01:15:48,954 --> 01:15:52,082
So long, old soup-kitchener!

1274
01:15:52,186 --> 01:15:55,523
Ta-da, Major Earl's granddaughter!

1275
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:04,906
What price salvation now?

1276
01:16:06,678 --> 01:16:09,180
Snobby Price.

1277
01:16:10,223 --> 01:16:12,412
- Good-bye,
Bill. - Get out!

1278
01:16:22,108 --> 01:16:24,506
But that's all right, you know.

1279
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:27,217
Nothing personal.

1280
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:30,136
No malice.

1281
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,325
So long...

1282
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:33,994
Judy.

1283
01:16:40,145 --> 01:16:41,917
No malice.

1284
01:16:44,941 --> 01:16:46,921
So long, Bill.

1285
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:50,675
All clear, Rummy.

1286
01:16:50,779 --> 01:16:52,656
He's gone.

1287
01:16:57,139 --> 01:17:01,309
You make too much of him,
miss, in your innocence.

1288
01:17:01,413 --> 01:17:04,645
Better too much than too little, Rummy.

1289
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:06,730
Yes, miss.

1290
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,630
God forgive me.

1291
01:17:23,829 --> 01:17:25,809
Let's go, Peter.

1292
01:17:51,874 --> 01:17:54,897
Peter, I'm like you now...

1293
01:17:55,001 --> 01:17:57,399
cleaned out, lost my job.

1294
01:17:57,504 --> 01:18:00,631
You've youth and hope.
That's two better than me.

1295
01:18:00,736 --> 01:18:04,280
I'll get you a job,
Peter. That's hope for you.

1296
01:18:05,323 --> 01:18:08,659
The youth will have to be enough for me.

1297
01:18:08,763 --> 01:18:13,559
I've just enough left for
two good teas and my bus home.

1298
01:18:14,706 --> 01:18:17,521
Don't be proud, Peter.

1299
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:21,379
It's sharing between friends.

1300
01:18:21,379 --> 01:18:26,696
And promise me you
will talk to me and...

1301
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,677
not let me cry.

1302
01:18:59,015 --> 01:19:00,788
# Steadily forward march #

1303
01:19:00,892 --> 01:19:02,977
# To Jesus we will bring #

1304
01:19:03,082 --> 01:19:04,750
# Sinners of every kind #

1305
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:07,043
# And he will take them in #

1306
01:19:07,148 --> 01:19:08,920
# Rich and poor as well #

1307
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,005
# It does not matter who #

1308
01:19:11,109 --> 01:19:12,882
# Bring them in with all their sin #

1309
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:15,488
# He'll wash them white as snow ##

1310
01:19:21,848 --> 01:19:23,829
Let us pray.

1311
01:19:31,022 --> 01:19:33,003
Amen.

1312
01:19:34,254 --> 01:19:37,278
The general!

1313
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:58,234
Friends, we have a duty tonight
which we must not forget.

1314
01:19:58,338 --> 01:20:01,153
God has answered our
prayers wonderfully...

1315
01:20:01,257 --> 01:20:03,551
by sending us a great gift...

1316
01:20:03,655 --> 01:20:06,783
one that will enable us to
get through many winters...

1317
01:20:06,887 --> 01:20:09,389
as bitter as this one has been...

1318
01:20:09,493 --> 01:20:14,602
without stinting one ofhis children of
their little ration ofbread and milk...

1319
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:17,313
and their warm blanket in the shelter.

1320
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:20,440
You all know the name of the
nobleman who, under God...

1321
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,777
was the instrument of the
first half of that gift.

1322
01:20:23,881 --> 01:20:28,155
You will pray for him and
rejoice in his salvation.

1323
01:20:28,364 --> 01:20:31,179
Glory! Hallelujah!

1324
01:20:31,283 --> 01:20:34,932
God bless Lord Saxmundham!

1325
01:20:35,036 --> 01:20:38,790
You do not know the name of that
other generous servant of God...

1326
01:20:38,998 --> 01:20:41,292
who has made up the whole sum for us...

1327
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:44,315
and I must not tell it to you...

1328
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:49,007
for he is one of those who does
not let his right hand know...

1329
01:20:49,111 --> 01:20:51,092
what his left hand doeth.

1330
01:20:56,305 --> 01:21:00,162
Friends, he is here among us tonight!

1331
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:12,048
This afternoon, when he announced
his magnificent offering to me...

1332
01:21:12,152 --> 01:21:16,010
I exclaimed, "Thank God!"

1333
01:21:16,114 --> 01:21:18,303
He smiled and said...

1334
01:21:18,407 --> 01:21:20,388
"You do not thank me?"

1335
01:21:22,474 --> 01:21:27,374
I told him to come to this meeting
and he would hear how we thanked him.

1336
01:21:27,374 --> 01:21:29,354
He has come...

1337
01:21:29,459 --> 01:21:33,212
and you have kept my word for me.

1338
01:21:38,008 --> 01:21:40,406
My friends...

1339
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:43,638
you may not know him on
this side of the grave...

1340
01:21:43,742 --> 01:21:47,078
but when we cross the river...

1341
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:49,059
over there...

1342
01:21:49,163 --> 01:21:52,083
he will be there with us still...

1343
01:21:52,187 --> 01:21:57,087
and you will know him by
the seal of God on his brow.

1344
01:21:57,191 --> 01:21:59,068
Gloryl

1345
01:21:59,172 --> 01:22:04,802
We will now sing our old
favorite, "Abide with Me."

1346
01:22:07,721 --> 01:22:12,621
# Abide with me #

1347
01:22:12,726 --> 01:22:19,607
# Fast falls the eventide #

1348
01:22:19,711 --> 01:22:26,175
# The darkness deepens #

1349
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:32,222
# Lord, with me abide #

1350
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:39,520
# When other helpers fail #

1351
01:22:39,624 --> 01:22:41,918
# And comforts flee ##

1352
01:22:42,022 --> 01:22:44,420
This is rather more than I bargained for.

1353
01:22:44,524 --> 01:22:47,756
Come and have supper with me at my
flat. I've got something to say to you.

1354
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:49,737
We'll pick up a cab outside.

1355
01:22:49,945 --> 01:22:52,760
Yes, but I must call at Wilton Crescent
to ask if Barbara has got home safely.

1356
01:22:52,865 --> 01:22:54,950
Never mind Barbara. She
can look after herself.

1357
01:22:55,054 --> 01:22:57,452
Her uniform will protect
her better than 10 policemen.

1358
01:22:57,556 --> 01:23:00,163
Come on. It's about Barbara
I want to talk to you.

1359
01:23:59,172 --> 01:24:01,153
Now then, what's your game?

1360
01:24:01,257 --> 01:24:03,134
I've been watching you.

1361
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:08,347
Don't try throwing yourself after that bonnet
and giving me the trouble of fishing you out.

1362
01:24:08,451 --> 01:24:13,038
- Because you won't be let do it, see.
- That's what you thought, is it?

1363
01:24:13,143 --> 01:24:17,626
Even if I wanted to throw away
my life, I wouldn't risk yours.

1364
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:22,839
You'll excuse me, miss, but are
you quite yourself this evening?

1365
01:24:22,943 --> 01:24:25,237
I'm not at all sure.

1366
01:24:28,573 --> 01:24:34,307
I've walked a very long way and
I've become quite tired suddenly.

1367
01:24:34,411 --> 01:24:37,852
Do you think you could find
me a taxi to take me home?

1368
01:24:37,956 --> 01:24:40,250
Taxi, miss?

1369
01:24:41,918 --> 01:24:45,567
What you want, by the look
of you, is an ambulance.

1370
01:24:46,818 --> 01:24:48,486
Ambulance?

1371
01:24:58,807 --> 01:25:01,518
When she said, "You
don't thank me, madam."

1372
01:25:03,603 --> 01:25:06,105
A remarkable woman.

1373
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:09,233
- It's nice and warm in here.
- Help yourself, my friend.

1374
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:12,048
- Have some brandy.
- No, thanks. I'll have some water.

1375
01:25:12,152 --> 01:25:14,029
My throat's still dry.

1376
01:25:14,237 --> 01:25:17,052
I don't know how to sing, and the
result of my attempts at the meetings...

1377
01:25:17,157 --> 01:25:19,138
is always incipient laryngitis.

1378
01:25:22,578 --> 01:25:24,455
Oh! Ohh!

1379
01:25:24,559 --> 01:25:26,436
Look out! You'll set
the chimney on fire!

1380
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:28,416
Burnt my throat! What on earth is it?

1381
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:31,440
It's all right. It's only
vodka. It won't hurt you.

1382
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:34,568
Try some of that temperance
burgundy. It will wash away the sting.

1383
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:43,012
He may call it a
temperance burgundy, sir...

1384
01:25:43,117 --> 01:25:46,662
but I should be sorry to venture
on more than one glass of it myself.

1385
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:49,998
Nonsense. After that
awful stuff it's like milk.

1386
01:25:50,102 --> 01:25:52,500
Steady. Steady.

1387
01:25:52,604 --> 01:25:56,149
My burgundy isn't as mild as it seems.

1388
01:25:56,253 --> 01:25:58,443
- Ohh!
- Are you all right?

1389
01:25:58,443 --> 01:26:00,528
- Perfectly.
- Good.

1390
01:26:02,092 --> 01:26:04,802
You don't mind if I get rid of this.

1391
01:26:06,262 --> 01:26:08,973
That means you're
getting rid of Barbara.

1392
01:26:09,077 --> 01:26:12,205
- Not at all. - Yes, she refused
to swallow Bodger's whiskey.

1393
01:26:12,309 --> 01:26:15,228
Do you think she's any more likely
to swallow your money and gunpowder?

1394
01:26:15,332 --> 01:26:18,043
She's swallowed a good deal
of it already, my friend.

1395
01:26:18,147 --> 01:26:20,649
What do you suppose she's
been living on all these years?

1396
01:26:20,754 --> 01:26:23,152
You think you'll end by making
me swallow them, don't you?

1397
01:26:23,256 --> 01:26:25,132
Both of you will have to swallow them.

1398
01:26:25,237 --> 01:26:28,156
They are mystical powers above
and behind the three of us...

1399
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:30,971
that will make short
work of your scruples.

1400
01:26:30,971 --> 01:26:34,411
Do you think I don't know all about
the mystical powers, Machiavelli?

1401
01:26:34,516 --> 01:26:37,956
Do you remember what Euripides
said about your money and gunpowder?

1402
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:40,145
No.

1403
01:26:40,354 --> 01:26:42,648
"One, then another, in money and guns...

1404
01:26:42,648 --> 01:26:44,629
"may outpass his brother...

1405
01:26:44,733 --> 01:26:47,131
"and then in their
millions float and flow...

1406
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:49,633
- "and seethe with a million hopes
as leaven. - ##

1407
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:52,448
"And they win their will
or they miss their will...

1408
01:26:52,448 --> 01:26:55,784
"and their hopes are dead
or are pined for still.

1409
01:26:55,784 --> 01:26:58,286
"But whoe'er can know,
as the long days go...

1410
01:26:58,286 --> 01:27:00,788
that to live is happy
has found his heaven."

1411
01:27:00,788 --> 01:27:03,186
That's my translation.
What do you think of it?

1412
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:06,418
I think, my friend, that if you
wish to know as the long days go...

1413
01:27:06,523 --> 01:27:08,503
that to live is happy...

1414
01:27:08,503 --> 01:27:11,527
you must first acquire money
enough for a decent life...

1415
01:27:11,631 --> 01:27:14,238
and power enough to be your own master.

1416
01:27:14,342 --> 01:27:17,261
Mmm. You're damnably discouraging.

1417
01:27:21,327 --> 01:27:23,308
"What else is wisdom?

1418
01:27:23,308 --> 01:27:25,497
"What of man's endeavor
or God's high grace...

1419
01:27:25,602 --> 01:27:27,583
"so lovely and so great...

1420
01:27:27,687 --> 01:27:29,876
"to stand from fear set free...

1421
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,753
"to breathe and wait...

1422
01:27:31,857 --> 01:27:34,568
"to hold a hand uplifted over fate?

1423
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:37,904
And shall not Barbara be loved forever?"

1424
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:41,657
Oh. Euripides mentions Barbara, does he?

1425
01:27:41,866 --> 01:27:46,245
It's a fair translation.
The word means "loveliness."

1426
01:27:47,913 --> 01:27:53,751
And may I ask, as Barbara's father, how
much a year she is to be loved forever on?

1427
01:27:53,855 --> 01:27:56,670
As Barbara's father, that's
more your affair than mine.

1428
01:27:56,879 --> 01:28:00,319
I can feed her by teaching
Greek. That's about all.

1429
01:28:00,424 --> 01:28:02,822
Do you consider it a good match for her?

1430
01:28:04,594 --> 01:28:08,973
Mr. Undershaft, I am in many ways
a weak, timid, ineffectual person...

1431
01:28:09,077 --> 01:28:12,100
and my health is far
from satisfactory...

1432
01:28:12,205 --> 01:28:15,437
but whenever I feel
I must have anything...

1433
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:17,730
I get it sooner or later.

1434
01:28:18,981 --> 01:28:21,484
I feel that way about Barbara.

1435
01:28:21,692 --> 01:28:24,611
I don't like marriage. I
feel intensely afraid of it.

1436
01:28:24,611 --> 01:28:27,739
I don't know what I shall do with
Barbara or what she'll do with me...

1437
01:28:27,843 --> 01:28:31,492
but I feel that I, and
nobody else, must marry her.

1438
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:33,577
Please regard that as settled.

1439
01:28:33,786 --> 01:28:38,582
Not that I wish to be arbitrary, but why should
I waste your time in discussing what's inevitable?

1440
01:28:38,686 --> 01:28:41,710
- You mean you'll stick at nothing?
- Precisely.

1441
01:28:47,652 --> 01:28:51,301
Professor Cusins, you're a young man...

1442
01:28:51,405 --> 01:28:53,491
after my own heart.

1443
01:28:53,595 --> 01:28:59,120
Mr. Undershaft, you are, as far as I'm able
to gather, a most infernal old rascal...

1444
01:28:59,225 --> 01:29:03,291
but you appeal very strongly
to my sense of ironic humor.

1445
01:29:03,395 --> 01:29:05,897
Good.

1446
01:29:06,106 --> 01:29:08,087
We shall get on well together.

1447
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:11,006
Have you ever thought
about going into business?

1448
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:12,674
My business?

1449
01:29:12,778 --> 01:29:14,759
Money and gunpowder?

1450
01:29:16,219 --> 01:29:17,783
Never.

1451
01:29:18,929 --> 01:29:21,327
Barbara's money will come from it.

1452
01:29:21,432 --> 01:29:25,185
Why not help to earn it? Have
you thought of that at all?

1453
01:29:25,289 --> 01:29:28,625
I, uh... I...

1454
01:29:29,668 --> 01:29:32,587
Look here, Machiavelli, I am
interested in thought reading...

1455
01:29:32,691 --> 01:29:34,672
and have, in fact, made
some experiments in it...

1456
01:29:34,672 --> 01:29:37,070
but I object to your trying it on me.

1457
01:29:37,174 --> 01:29:40,094
When my head is clear, I'll
tell you exactly what I think.

1458
01:29:40,094 --> 01:29:43,013
Just at present I'm in
a state of exaltation.

1459
01:29:43,117 --> 01:29:45,098
I don't know why.

1460
01:29:45,202 --> 01:29:47,600
Perhaps it's the
excitement of that meeting.

1461
01:29:53,751 --> 01:29:56,775
Phew! The room is very hot.

1462
01:29:56,983 --> 01:29:59,068
Might we have a window
open for a moment?

1463
01:29:59,173 --> 01:30:01,258
- Certainly. James.
- Mmm?

1464
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:04,281
- I should like a breath
of fresh air myself. - Sir?

1465
01:30:04,281 --> 01:30:06,992
Draw back those curtains and
open the window, will you?

1466
01:30:07,096 --> 01:30:10,015
- It's a very windy night, sir.
- So much the better.

1467
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,101
It's only for a moment.

1468
01:30:24,194 --> 01:30:27,426
Ah, what a relief!

1469
01:30:28,886 --> 01:30:32,744
- Steady, Machiavelli, steady!
- Lend a hand, will you!

1470
01:30:32,848 --> 01:30:35,246
- Quick!
- Right, sir!

1471
01:30:38,895 --> 01:30:41,397
I am afraid he's here
for the night, sir.

1472
01:30:50,259 --> 01:30:52,135
Nobody down yet?

1473
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:54,846
Mr. Stephen's down, milady,
and is having breakfast.

1474
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,827
Miss Barbara's gone up, I suppose.

1475
01:30:57,035 --> 01:31:00,163
- No, milady, Miss Barbara is not up yet.
- Not up yet?

1476
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:02,770
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure, milady.

1477
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:08,295
Miss Barbara came in late last night
and said she was not to be called.

1478
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,902
Not to be called? Was she quite well?

1479
01:31:11,006 --> 01:31:14,238
A little pale, milady,
and without her bonnet.

1480
01:31:14,342 --> 01:31:16,219
I hadn't much time to notice.

1481
01:31:16,323 --> 01:31:21,015
She went straight upstairs and left me to
settle with the policemen and the ambulance.

1482
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:24,872
Policemen? Ambulance? There
must have been some accident.

1483
01:31:24,976 --> 01:31:27,062
Are you certain she wasn't hurt?

1484
01:31:27,166 --> 01:31:29,772
I can assure you she was
quite all right, milady.

1485
01:31:29,877 --> 01:31:31,857
Well.

1486
01:31:31,962 --> 01:31:34,151
What have you laid all
those extra places for?

1487
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:37,070
You're expecting Mr. Cusins
and Mr. Lomax, milady.

1488
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:41,345
The car's ordered for half past 10:00
to take the party to, uh... to, uh...

1489
01:31:41,449 --> 01:31:43,743
Well? To where?

1490
01:31:43,951 --> 01:31:46,349
To Mr. Undershaft's
place, I think, milady.

1491
01:31:46,453 --> 01:31:48,747
- To the factory, you mean?
- Well, yes, milady.

1492
01:31:48,747 --> 01:31:50,832
The factory pays your wages, Morrison.

1493
01:31:50,936 --> 01:31:54,586
Yes, milady. That is what factories
are for. We must put up with them.

1494
01:31:54,794 --> 01:31:57,817
- Bacon and eggs, milady, as usual?
- No, I'll have a sausage this morning.

1495
01:31:57,922 --> 01:31:59,694
Yes, milady.

1496
01:31:59,798 --> 01:32:02,092
Ah, breakfast! Oh,
good morning, Lady Brit!

1497
01:32:02,301 --> 01:32:04,594
- You're late, Charles. Where's Adolphus?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

1498
01:32:04,803 --> 01:32:06,679
Good morning, darling!
Morrison, we're starving!

1499
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,660
- Ah, bacon and eggs.
- Sausages!

1500
01:32:08,764 --> 01:32:10,641
Sausages, good. No kidneys. Morrison?

1501
01:32:10,745 --> 01:32:15,437
- Kidneys, sir. - Ah, thank
heaven for the English breakfast.

1502
01:32:15,437 --> 01:32:18,460
You know, as I always say, the
one drawback about going abroad...

1503
01:32:18,565 --> 01:32:22,318
Charles Lomax, if you must drivel, drivel
like a grown-up man and not like a schoolboy.

1504
01:32:22,422 --> 01:32:24,612
Drivel is drivel, you
know, whatever a man's age.

1505
01:32:24,612 --> 01:32:26,488
Good morning, everybody.

1506
01:32:26,592 --> 01:32:28,469
- Good morning, Barbara.
- Morning!

1507
01:32:28,573 --> 01:32:30,450
Good heavens! Y-You've
chucked the uniform.

1508
01:32:30,554 --> 01:32:33,473
You mean that Barbara's changed
her dress, Charles. Why not say so?

1509
01:32:33,578 --> 01:32:37,852
Cholly means exactly what he says,
Mother. Please, let's drop the subject.

1510
01:32:39,833 --> 01:32:42,752
Oh, I... I'm awfully sorry, Barbara.

1511
01:32:42,857 --> 01:32:44,733
You'll get over it, you know.

1512
01:32:44,838 --> 01:32:46,818
Personally, I never shut
my eyes to the fact...

1513
01:32:46,923 --> 01:32:49,842
that there's a certain amount
of tosh about the Salvation Army.

1514
01:32:49,946 --> 01:32:51,823
- On the other hand...
- That's enough, Charles.

1515
01:32:51,927 --> 01:32:54,533
Speak of something suited
to your mental capacity.

1516
01:32:54,638 --> 01:32:57,244
Thank you for your sympathy, Cholly.

1517
01:32:57,348 --> 01:32:59,538
Now go and flirt with Sarah.

1518
01:33:00,685 --> 01:33:02,353
Darling.

1519
01:33:02,457 --> 01:33:05,376
Barbara, I wish you wouldn't
tell Cholly to do things.

1520
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,191
- He always comes straight away
and does them. - Darling.

1521
01:33:08,295 --> 01:33:10,276
Good morning, Lady Brit.

1522
01:33:19,764 --> 01:33:21,536
- Good morning, Charley.
- Good morning.

1523
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,517
- Morning!
- Good morning.

1524
01:33:26,645 --> 01:33:29,460
Just some water, please, Morrison...

1525
01:33:29,564 --> 01:33:31,232
with ice in it.

1526
01:33:32,275 --> 01:33:35,194
I say, old boy, did
you have a bad night?

1527
01:33:35,298 --> 01:33:37,175
No, I had a very good night.

1528
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:39,677
In fact, one of the most
remarkable nights I ever passed.

1529
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:42,700
- The meeting?
- No, after the meeting.

1530
01:33:42,805 --> 01:33:46,141
You ought to have gone to bed after
the meeting. What were you doing?

1531
01:33:46,349 --> 01:33:48,539
Drinking.

1532
01:33:48,643 --> 01:33:50,624
- Adolphus!
- Dolly!

1533
01:33:50,728 --> 01:33:53,543
- I say!
- What were you drinking, may I ask?

1534
01:33:53,647 --> 01:33:57,192
A most devilish Russian
spirit. I believe it was vodka.

1535
01:33:57,192 --> 01:33:59,173
Are you joking, Dolly?

1536
01:33:59,277 --> 01:34:03,552
No. I've been making a night of it with the
nominal head of this household, that's all.

1537
01:34:03,656 --> 01:34:05,533
Andrew made you drunk?

1538
01:34:05,637 --> 01:34:07,514
No, he just provided the drink.

1539
01:34:07,618 --> 01:34:11,580
Tell you the truth, I've
never been quite drunk before.

1540
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,978
I rather liked it last night.

1541
01:34:14,082 --> 01:34:15,958
I told you I was possessed.

1542
01:34:16,063 --> 01:34:20,337
Possessed? You're not sober
yet. Go home to bed at once.

1543
01:34:20,441 --> 01:34:23,361
I've never before ventured
to reproach you, Lady Brit...

1544
01:34:23,465 --> 01:34:26,384
but how could you marry
the prince of darkness?

1545
01:34:26,384 --> 01:34:29,929
It was much more excusable to marry
him than to get drunk with him.

1546
01:34:29,929 --> 01:34:34,203
That's a new accomplishment of
Andrew's, by the way. He usen't to drink.

1547
01:34:34,308 --> 01:34:37,331
He doesn't now, although he had an
admirable excuse for doing so last night.

1548
01:34:37,435 --> 01:34:39,729
You see, he'd just given away 50,000.

1549
01:34:39,938 --> 01:34:42,544
- Given away?
- Yes, to the Salvation Army.

1550
01:34:42,648 --> 01:34:44,629
And he insisted upon
remaining anonymous.

1551
01:34:44,733 --> 01:34:48,904
That was rather fine of the old boy, you know?
Most chaps would have wanted the advertisement.

1552
01:34:49,008 --> 01:34:50,780
He said all the
charitable institutions...

1553
01:34:50,885 --> 01:34:53,178
would be down on him like kites on
a battlefield if he gave his name.

1554
01:34:53,283 --> 01:34:57,557
That's Andrew all over. Never does a proper
thing without giving an improper reason for it.

1555
01:34:57,661 --> 01:35:01,206
He convinced me that I have all my life been
doing improper things for proper reasons.

1556
01:35:01,415 --> 01:35:03,708
Mr. Undershaft has just arrived.

1557
01:35:03,917 --> 01:35:06,523
He's in the drawing room, milady.

1558
01:35:08,608 --> 01:35:12,883
Children, go and get ready. Your
father doesn't like to be kept waiting.

1559
01:35:13,091 --> 01:35:14,655
Adolphus.

1560
01:35:18,409 --> 01:35:22,058
Now that Barbara's left the Salvation
Army, you had better leave it too.

1561
01:35:22,162 --> 01:35:25,081
I will not have you playing
that drum in the streets.

1562
01:35:25,185 --> 01:35:27,270
Your order is already obeyed, Lady Brit.

1563
01:35:31,753 --> 01:35:33,422
Blah!

1564
01:35:34,985 --> 01:35:37,071
How fortunate to see you alone.

1565
01:35:37,175 --> 01:35:39,156
Don't be sentimental, Andrew.

1566
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:40,928
Sit down.

1567
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:46,454
Sarah must have 800 a year until
Charles comes into his property.

1568
01:35:46,454 --> 01:35:49,269
Barbara will need more...
need it permanently...

1569
01:35:49,373 --> 01:35:51,667
because Adolphus hasn't any property.

1570
01:35:51,771 --> 01:35:55,837
Yes, my dear. I shall see to it.
Anything else? For yourself, for instance?

1571
01:35:55,941 --> 01:35:58,131
I want to talk to you about Stephen.

1572
01:35:58,235 --> 01:36:00,424
Don't, my dear. Stephen
doesn't interest me.

1573
01:36:00,633 --> 01:36:02,926
He does interest me!

1574
01:36:03,031 --> 01:36:05,950
- He's our son!
- Do you really think so?

1575
01:36:06,054 --> 01:36:09,703
Andrew, don't be aggravating and don't
be wicked! At present, you're both.

1576
01:36:09,807 --> 01:36:12,622
Do you pretend that Stephen
couldn't carry on the foundry...

1577
01:36:12,727 --> 01:36:15,542
just as well as all the other
sons of big business houses?

1578
01:36:15,646 --> 01:36:18,252
Yes, he could learn
the office routine...

1579
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:21,693
without understanding the
business like all the other sons.

1580
01:36:21,797 --> 01:36:25,342
Stephen is a most steady,
capable, high-minded young man.

1581
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:28,782
You're simply trying to find
an excuse for disinheriting him.

1582
01:36:28,886 --> 01:36:32,014
My dear, the Undershaft
tradition disinherits him.

1583
01:36:32,118 --> 01:36:35,142
But I must admit it's
landed me in a difficulty.

1584
01:36:35,246 --> 01:36:40,251
As you yourself remark, I'm getting on in
years and I haven't found a fit successor yet.

1585
01:36:40,355 --> 01:36:42,440
- There is Stephen.
- That's just it.

1586
01:36:42,544 --> 01:36:46,506
All the foundlings I can
find are exactly like Stephen.

1587
01:36:46,506 --> 01:36:50,363
I want a man with no
relations and no schooling.

1588
01:36:50,468 --> 01:36:54,847
That is, a man who would be out of the running
altogether if he weren't a strong man...

1589
01:36:54,847 --> 01:36:56,827
and I can't find him.

1590
01:36:56,932 --> 01:37:00,372
If you want to keep the business in the family,
you'd better find an eligible foundling...

1591
01:37:00,476 --> 01:37:02,457
and marry him to Barbara!

1592
01:37:03,813 --> 01:37:06,106
You would sacrifice Stephen to Barbara?

1593
01:37:06,211 --> 01:37:07,983
Cheerfully! Come, Biddy...

1594
01:37:08,087 --> 01:37:11,528
Don't call me Biddy!
I don't call you Andy!

1595
01:37:11,632 --> 01:37:15,072
And your tie's all on
one side. Put it straight.

1596
01:37:15,177 --> 01:37:18,304
- Oh, I... I beg your pardon.
- No, come in, Stephen.

1597
01:37:18,409 --> 01:37:20,494
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1598
01:37:20,494 --> 01:37:24,143
I understand you want to
come into the cannon business.

1599
01:37:24,247 --> 01:37:26,332
I, go into trade?

1600
01:37:26,436 --> 01:37:28,209
Certainly not.

1601
01:37:28,313 --> 01:37:31,545
Cannons are not trade, Stephen.
They're a national enterprise.

1602
01:37:31,754 --> 01:37:34,569
I have no intention of becoming
a man of business in any sense.

1603
01:37:34,673 --> 01:37:36,758
I intend to devote myself to politics.

1604
01:37:36,862 --> 01:37:40,094
My dear boy, this is an
immense relief to me...

1605
01:37:40,198 --> 01:37:43,743
and I trust it may prove an
equally good thing for the country.

1606
01:37:43,847 --> 01:37:48,122
Stephen, I cannot allow you to throw
away an enormous property like this.

1607
01:37:48,226 --> 01:37:51,667
Mother, there must be an end of
treating me as a child, if you please.

1608
01:37:51,771 --> 01:37:56,358
Any further discussions had better take place
with my father as between one man and another.

1609
01:37:56,463 --> 01:37:58,652
- Stephen!
- I am sorry, Mother, that you have false...

1610
01:37:58,756 --> 01:38:00,529
I quite understand, Stephen.

1611
01:38:00,529 --> 01:38:05,324
By all means, go your own
way, if you feel strong enough.

1612
01:38:06,576 --> 01:38:11,580
You see, my dear, it's only the big
men who can be treated like children.

1613
01:38:13,457 --> 01:38:17,627
All right, Stephen, your independence
is achieved. You've won your latchkey.

1614
01:38:17,731 --> 01:38:21,693
Now, what about your future,
just between one man and another?

1615
01:38:21,797 --> 01:38:24,821
It's settled that you don't ask for
succession to the cannon business.

1616
01:38:24,925 --> 01:38:27,948
I hope it is settled that I
repudiate the cannon business.

1617
01:38:28,053 --> 01:38:32,014
My dear boy, don't be so devilish
sulky. Freedom should be generous.

1618
01:38:32,119 --> 01:38:35,768
Besides, I owe you a fair start in
life in exchange for disinheriting you.

1619
01:38:35,872 --> 01:38:39,104
You can't become prime
minister all at once, you know.

1620
01:38:39,208 --> 01:38:44,629
Haven't you a turn for something? What
about literature, art and so forth?

1621
01:38:44,734 --> 01:38:49,530
I have nothing of the artist about me,
either in faculty or character, thank heaven.

1622
01:38:49,634 --> 01:38:52,240
A philosopher, perhaps.

1623
01:38:52,344 --> 01:38:54,638
I make no such ridiculous pretension.

1624
01:38:54,742 --> 01:39:00,060
Just so. Well, then, there's the
army, the navy, the church and the bar.

1625
01:39:00,164 --> 01:39:02,457
The bar requires some ability.

1626
01:39:02,562 --> 01:39:04,334
What about the bar?

1627
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:07,253
I'm afraid I haven't the necessary push.

1628
01:39:07,462 --> 01:39:12,675
I believe that is the name that barristers
give their vulgarity for success in pleading.

1629
01:39:12,675 --> 01:39:14,968
Rather a difficult case, Stephen.

1630
01:39:15,073 --> 01:39:17,888
Hardly anything left
but the stage, is there?

1631
01:39:17,992 --> 01:39:21,328
Well, is there anything
you know or care for?

1632
01:39:21,432 --> 01:39:24,351
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

1633
01:39:24,351 --> 01:39:26,645
You don't say so!

1634
01:39:26,645 --> 01:39:29,460
What? No capacity for business?

1635
01:39:29,564 --> 01:39:32,379
No knowledge of law?
No sympathy with art?

1636
01:39:32,484 --> 01:39:34,464
No pretension to philosophy.

1637
01:39:34,569 --> 01:39:39,156
Only a simple knowledge of the secret
that has baffled all the lawyers...

1638
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:43,014
muddled all the men of business
and ruined most of the artists...

1639
01:39:43,118 --> 01:39:45,203
the secret of right and wrong.

1640
01:39:45,307 --> 01:39:47,497
Why, man, you're a geniusl

1641
01:39:47,705 --> 01:39:49,269
A master of mastersl

1642
01:39:49,373 --> 01:39:50,937
A god.

1643
01:39:51,041 --> 01:39:52,814
And at 28 too.

1644
01:39:52,918 --> 01:39:54,795
You are pleased to be facetious.

1645
01:39:54,899 --> 01:39:58,131
I pretend to nothing more than any honorable
Englishman claims as his birthright.

1646
01:39:58,235 --> 01:40:00,112
Oh, very well. Have it your own way.

1647
01:40:00,216 --> 01:40:02,510
You know nothing, and you
think you know everything.

1648
01:40:02,614 --> 01:40:05,429
That points clearly
to a political career.

1649
01:40:05,533 --> 01:40:09,495
We'll get you a private secretaryship to
someone who can get you an under-secretaryship...

1650
01:40:09,599 --> 01:40:12,518
and you'll find your natural
and proper place in the end...

1651
01:40:12,623 --> 01:40:14,291
on the treasury bench.

1652
01:40:14,395 --> 01:40:18,148
I'm sorry, sir, that you force me to
forget the respect due to you as my father.

1653
01:40:18,253 --> 01:40:21,693
I am an Englishman, and I will not hear
the government of my country insulted.

1654
01:40:21,693 --> 01:40:23,674
The government of your country.

1655
01:40:23,778 --> 01:40:26,802
I am the government of
your country. I and Lazarus.

1656
01:40:26,906 --> 01:40:29,929
Do you suppose that you and
half a dozen amateurs like you...

1657
01:40:30,034 --> 01:40:32,327
sitting in a row in that
foolish gabble shop...

1658
01:40:32,432 --> 01:40:34,725
can govern a country like England?

1659
01:40:34,829 --> 01:40:38,270
Be off with you, my boy, and
play with your historic parties...

1660
01:40:38,374 --> 01:40:40,668
and leading articles
and burning questions...

1661
01:40:40,772 --> 01:40:42,649
and the rest of your toys.

1662
01:40:42,753 --> 01:40:46,819
And in return, you shall have the
support and applause of my newspapers...

1663
01:40:46,923 --> 01:40:50,677
and the delight of imagining
that you're a great statesman.

1664
01:40:50,781 --> 01:40:52,970
Really, my dear Father...

1665
01:40:54,534 --> 01:40:56,828
it's quite impossible
to be angry with you.

1666
01:40:56,932 --> 01:41:00,268
I suppose it is natural for you to
think that money governs England...

1667
01:41:00,372 --> 01:41:02,875
but you must allow me
to think I know better.

1668
01:41:02,979 --> 01:41:04,856
And what does govern England, pray?

1669
01:41:05,064 --> 01:41:06,941
Character, Father, character.

1670
01:41:07,045 --> 01:41:09,443
Whose character? Yours or mine?

1671
01:41:09,547 --> 01:41:11,424
Neither yours nor mine, Father...

1672
01:41:11,528 --> 01:41:15,281
but the best elements in the
English national character.

1673
01:41:15,386 --> 01:41:17,783
Stephen, I've found
your profession for you!

1674
01:41:17,888 --> 01:41:19,764
You're a born journalist!

1675
01:41:19,869 --> 01:41:22,684
We must get you a job on the Times.

1676
01:41:27,792 --> 01:41:29,773
- M-M-Mother... - Don't
be apologetic, Stephen.

1677
01:41:29,877 --> 01:41:32,796
- Yes, but... - And don't forget
you've outgrown your mother.

1678
01:41:34,152 --> 01:41:36,133
Good morning, Morrison.

1679
01:41:36,133 --> 01:41:39,156
Shall we see you again this evening,
sir? I'll have your room ready for you.

1680
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:40,929
No, by George!

1681
01:41:55,316 --> 01:41:57,714
You look a little pale, my dear.

1682
01:41:57,818 --> 01:42:00,425
I've made you unhappy, haven't I?

1683
01:42:02,718 --> 01:42:05,742
Do you understand
what you've done to me?

1684
01:42:05,742 --> 01:42:08,974
Yesterday I had a man's soul in my hand.

1685
01:42:09,078 --> 01:42:12,727
I set him in the way of life
with his face to salvation.

1686
01:42:12,831 --> 01:42:17,836
And when we took your money he turned
back again to drunkenness and derision.

1687
01:42:17,836 --> 01:42:20,442
I'll never forgive you that. Never.

1688
01:42:20,546 --> 01:42:23,257
Does my daughter despair so easily?

1689
01:42:23,361 --> 01:42:26,802
Can you strike a man to the
heart and leave no mark on him?

1690
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:31,076
You forget, my dear, Bill Walker spat
in Todger's eye to save his honor.

1691
01:42:31,181 --> 01:42:34,100
He gave up his hard-earned
pound to save his soul.

1692
01:42:34,204 --> 01:42:37,123
Do you know what a pound
means to such a man?

1693
01:42:37,227 --> 01:42:39,625
It's your faith that's failing, not his.

1694
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:43,379
Will he ever strike a woman
again as he struck Jenny Hill?

1695
01:42:43,483 --> 01:42:46,402
You've sent him on the
road to his salvation.

1696
01:42:46,506 --> 01:42:50,677
It may not be your road,
but he won't turn back.

1697
01:42:50,781 --> 01:42:53,387
Oh, yes, you're right.

1698
01:42:53,492 --> 01:42:56,724
He can never be lost now.

1699
01:42:56,828 --> 01:42:59,539
Where was my faith?

1700
01:42:59,643 --> 01:43:02,353
Oh, clever, clever devil.

1701
01:43:02,458 --> 01:43:06,315
You may be a devil, but God
speaks through you sometimes.

1702
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:10,381
You've given me back my happiness
and I can feel it deep down now...

1703
01:43:10,486 --> 01:43:12,466
though my spirit is troubled.

1704
01:43:12,571 --> 01:43:17,262
You've learnt something, my dear. That always
feels, at first, as if you'd lost something.

1705
01:43:22,892 --> 01:43:26,854
What have Barbara and I got to do with your
factory of death? That's what I ask myself.

1706
01:43:27,897 --> 01:43:30,294
I've always thought of
it as a sort of pit...

1707
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:33,318
where lost creatures with blackened
faces stirred up smoking fires...

1708
01:43:33,318 --> 01:43:36,133
and were driven and
tormented by my father.

1709
01:43:36,237 --> 01:43:39,573
- Is it like that, Papa?
- My dear, you'll see for yourself.

1710
01:44:37,228 --> 01:44:39,000
Raw materials of destruction.

1711
01:44:39,104 --> 01:44:42,336
Or construction. How
about railway lines, for instance?

1712
01:45:24,456 --> 01:45:26,437
Astonishing.

1713
01:45:26,541 --> 01:45:28,939
Remember the words of Plato?

1714
01:45:29,044 --> 01:45:32,275
Plato? You dare quote a
Greek philosopher to me?

1715
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:35,403
Plato says, my friend, that
society cannot be saved...

1716
01:45:35,507 --> 01:45:38,844
until either the professors of
Greek take to making gunpowder...

1717
01:45:38,948 --> 01:45:42,493
or else the makers of gunpowder
become professors of Greek.

1718
01:45:57,193 --> 01:46:01,989
My predecessors, the old swordsmiths,
used the same stuff... boiling steel.

1719
01:46:15,855 --> 01:46:17,732
Have you found anything discreditable?

1720
01:46:17,836 --> 01:46:19,400
Nope.

1721
01:46:19,504 --> 01:46:23,153
The men call him Dandy Andy and
are proud he's a cunning old rascal.

1722
01:46:38,583 --> 01:46:40,564
Well?

1723
01:46:42,232 --> 01:46:45,360
You're driving me against
my nature. I hate war.

1724
01:46:45,464 --> 01:46:49,426
Hatred is the coward's
revenge for being intimidated.

1725
01:46:49,530 --> 01:46:52,554
Dare you make war on war...

1726
01:46:52,658 --> 01:46:54,639
here are the means.

1727
01:47:06,941 --> 01:47:08,609
Well, Euripides?

1728
01:47:08,713 --> 01:47:10,590
You coming into my business?

1729
01:47:10,694 --> 01:47:13,926
Understand this, you old demon...
You have me in a horrible dilemma.

1730
01:47:14,031 --> 01:47:15,594
I want Barbara.

1731
01:47:15,699 --> 01:47:18,618
Like most young men, you greatly
exaggerate the difference...

1732
01:47:18,722 --> 01:47:21,016
between one young woman and another.

1733
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:22,997
Quite true, Dolly.

1734
01:47:23,101 --> 01:47:26,020
I refuse to walk another step through
all these sheds and pipes and boilers.

1735
01:47:26,124 --> 01:47:28,001
They mean nothing to me.

1736
01:47:28,105 --> 01:47:31,233
I've never asked you to come look at
the kitchen range and the scullery sink.

1737
01:47:34,361 --> 01:47:38,010
Why is that roof making a
noise like a whale with asthma?

1738
01:47:38,114 --> 01:47:41,242
It's breathing, my love. Come and see.

1739
01:47:49,478 --> 01:47:52,397
This is ridiculous. Is
it snow, or salt, or what?

1740
01:47:52,502 --> 01:47:54,378
Nitrates to make explosives.

1741
01:47:54,482 --> 01:47:56,776
Or sulfates to fertilize your fields.

1742
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,425
If you prefer the explosive way,
that's your affair, not mine.

1743
01:48:00,529 --> 01:48:04,908
Come, Euripides, you think that
nitrates are good for nothing but death.

1744
01:48:05,012 --> 01:48:07,932
Now I'll show you the
sort of life they produce.

1745
01:48:22,423 --> 01:48:26,385
This is where my workers live. Here
they own everything and I own nothing.

1746
01:48:26,489 --> 01:48:29,513
- Sort of a cooperative touch, huh?
- Exactly, Mr. Lomax.

1747
01:48:29,617 --> 01:48:32,328
It makes it very difficult for
them to leave my employment.

1748
01:48:32,432 --> 01:48:34,413
- But then they don't want to leave it.
- Why?

1749
01:48:34,413 --> 01:48:36,915
Because they can't better
themselves, my love.

1750
01:48:37,124 --> 01:48:39,834
- Slavery, I call it.
- Do you, my dear?

1751
01:49:06,941 --> 01:49:10,069
- Sort of ideal church exhibition, what?
- Exactly, Mr. Lomax.

1752
01:49:10,278 --> 01:49:12,675
It's the result of our
belief in religious freedom.

1753
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:15,282
Its official name is the meeting
place of all the religions.

1754
01:49:15,282 --> 01:49:17,263
The men call it Piety Square.

1755
01:49:17,367 --> 01:49:20,599
Are you sure that all this pampering
is really good for the men's characters?

1756
01:49:20,703 --> 01:49:23,205
My dear boy, when you're
organizing civilization...

1757
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:27,584
you have to make up your mind whether
trouble and anxiety are good things or not.

1758
01:49:27,688 --> 01:49:31,650
If you decide that they are, then I take
it you simply don't organize civilization.

1759
01:49:31,755 --> 01:49:33,318
Good morning.

1760
01:49:33,423 --> 01:49:35,299
However, our characters are safe here.

1761
01:49:35,404 --> 01:49:38,323
A sufficient dose of
anxiety is always provided...

1762
01:49:38,427 --> 01:49:42,076
by the fact that we may all be
blown to smithereens at any moment.

1763
01:49:51,042 --> 01:49:53,649
- Well?
- Not a ray of hope.

1764
01:49:53,857 --> 01:49:57,193
Everything perfect, wonderful, real.

1765
01:49:57,402 --> 01:50:01,364
It only needs a cathedral to be a
heavenly city instead of a hellish one.

1766
01:50:01,468 --> 01:50:05,325
And to think of all that being yours, and
you've kept it to yourself all these years.

1767
01:50:05,534 --> 01:50:08,870
It doesn't belong to me, I belong to
it. It's the Undershaft inheritance.

1768
01:50:08,974 --> 01:50:10,538
It is not.

1769
01:50:10,642 --> 01:50:14,396
Your ridiculous cannons and that noisy, banging
foundry may be the Undershaft inheritance...

1770
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:18,775
but all that plate and linen, all those houses
and orchards and gardens, they belong to us.

1771
01:50:18,879 --> 01:50:22,736
They belong to me. They're not a
man's business. I won't give them up!

1772
01:50:22,841 --> 01:50:25,760
- What lovely flowers.
- Never mind about the flowers, Andrew.

1773
01:50:25,864 --> 01:50:30,243
You're trying to put me off the subject
of the inheritance. Well, you shan't.

1774
01:50:30,347 --> 01:50:32,224
I don't ask it any longer for Stephen.

1775
01:50:32,328 --> 01:50:35,247
He's inherited far too much of
your perversity to be fit for it.

1776
01:50:35,351 --> 01:50:37,228
But Barbara has rights
as well as Stephen.

1777
01:50:37,437 --> 01:50:39,835
Why should not Adolphus
succeed to the inheritance?

1778
01:50:39,939 --> 01:50:42,858
I should ask nothing
better if Adolphus were a foundling.

1779
01:50:42,962 --> 01:50:45,881
He's exactly the sort of new blood
that's wanted in English business.

1780
01:50:45,986 --> 01:50:48,384
But he's not a foundling,
and there's an end of it.

1781
01:50:48,488 --> 01:50:50,260
Not quite.

1782
01:50:52,345 --> 01:50:56,203
I think... Mind, I'm not committing
myself in any way as to my future course...

1783
01:50:56,411 --> 01:51:00,165
but I think the foundling
difficulty can be got over.

1784
01:51:00,269 --> 01:51:04,231
- What do you mean? - Well, I have something
to say which is in the nature of a confession.

1785
01:51:04,335 --> 01:51:06,212
- A confession?
- A confession?

1786
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:08,505
Yes, a confession.

1787
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:10,799
Listen, all of you.

1788
01:51:10,903 --> 01:51:12,884
Won't you sit down?

1789
01:51:17,471 --> 01:51:21,225
Until I met Barbara, I thought myself
in the main an honorable, truthful man...

1790
01:51:21,225 --> 01:51:24,457
because I wanted the approval of my
conscience more than I wanted anything else.

1791
01:51:24,561 --> 01:51:28,835
But the moment I saw Barbara, I wanted her
far more than the approval of my conscience.

1792
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:31,442
- Adolphus!
- I thought she was a woman of the people...

1793
01:51:31,442 --> 01:51:33,736
and that a marriage with a professor
of Greek would be far beyond...

1794
01:51:33,944 --> 01:51:35,821
the wildest social
ambitions of her rank.

1795
01:51:35,925 --> 01:51:38,114
- Adolphusl
- No, really!

1796
01:51:38,219 --> 01:51:41,451
- When I learnt the horrible truth...
- What do you mean by the horrible truth, pray?

1797
01:51:41,555 --> 01:51:45,725
That she was enormously rich, that her grandfather was
an earl, that her father was the prince of darkness...

1798
01:51:45,829 --> 01:51:48,853
- Shh! - And that I was only an
adventurer trying to catch a rich wife...

1799
01:51:48,957 --> 01:51:51,459
then I stooped to deceive
her about my birth.

1800
01:51:51,564 --> 01:51:53,336
- Dolly!
- Your birth?

1801
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:57,923
Adolphus, don't dare make up a wicked story
for the sake of these wretched cannons.

1802
01:51:58,132 --> 01:52:00,634
Remember, I've seen
photographs of your parents.

1803
01:52:00,738 --> 01:52:03,657
The agent general for Southwestern
Australia knows them personally...

1804
01:52:03,762 --> 01:52:06,681
and has assured me they are the
most respectable married people.

1805
01:52:06,681 --> 01:52:09,287
Oh, so they are, in Australia.
But here they're outcasts.

1806
01:52:09,392 --> 01:52:12,102
Their marriage is legal in
Australia, but not in England.

1807
01:52:12,206 --> 01:52:14,917
My mother is my father's
deceased wife's sister...

1808
01:52:15,021 --> 01:52:17,628
and in this island I am,
consequently, a foundling.

1809
01:52:18,983 --> 01:52:22,007
I think not. You can marry your
wife's sister even in England.

1810
01:52:22,111 --> 01:52:25,551
Ah, you can now, but not
when my parents married.

1811
01:52:25,656 --> 01:52:27,532
Is the subterfuge good
enough, Machiavelli?

1812
01:52:27,637 --> 01:52:30,243
You're an educated man.
That's against the tradition.

1813
01:52:30,347 --> 01:52:32,849
Greek hasn't destroyed my
mind, it's nourished it.

1814
01:52:32,954 --> 01:52:35,873
Beside, I didn't learn it
in an English public school.

1815
01:52:35,977 --> 01:52:38,375
Biddy, this may be a way
out of the difficulties.

1816
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:42,754
Stuff! A man cannot make cannons any better for
being his own cousin instead of his proper self.

1817
01:52:42,858 --> 01:52:47,133
Well, I can't afford to be too particular.
He's cornered the foundling market.

1818
01:52:47,237 --> 01:52:48,592
Let it pass.

1819
01:52:48,697 --> 01:52:51,511
You're eligible,
Euripides, you're eligible!

1820
01:52:51,824 --> 01:52:55,265
You know that you'll have to change
your name. You object to that?

1821
01:52:55,369 --> 01:52:57,975
Would any man named Adolphus...
any man called Dolly...

1822
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:00,061
object to being called something else?

1823
01:53:00,061 --> 01:53:02,250
Hardly.

1824
01:53:02,354 --> 01:53:05,690
Now, as to money, I propose to treat
you handsomely from the beginning.

1825
01:53:05,795 --> 01:53:08,088
You shall start at a thousand a year.

1826
01:53:08,193 --> 01:53:10,069
A thousand?

1827
01:53:11,112 --> 01:53:15,491
You dare offer a miserable thousand
to the son-in-law of a millionaire?

1828
01:53:15,699 --> 01:53:18,514
No, by heavens, Machiavelli,
you shall not cheat me.

1829
01:53:18,618 --> 01:53:22,163
You can't do without me,
and I can do without you.

1830
01:53:22,267 --> 01:53:26,542
I must have, uh, 2,500
a year for two years.

1831
01:53:26,646 --> 01:53:28,940
At the end of that time,
if I'm a failure I go.

1832
01:53:29,044 --> 01:53:32,380
But if I'm a success and stay on,
you must give me the other 5,000.

1833
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:34,048
What other 5,000?

1834
01:53:34,153 --> 01:53:37,385
To make the two years
up to 5,000 a year.

1835
01:53:37,489 --> 01:53:41,555
The 2,500 is only half pay, in
case I should turn out a failure.

1836
01:53:42,598 --> 01:53:46,976
The third year I must have,
uh, 10% of the profits.

1837
01:53:47,081 --> 01:53:50,208
Ten per... Do you know
what my profits are?

1838
01:53:50,313 --> 01:53:51,772
Enormous, I hope!

1839
01:53:51,876 --> 01:53:54,483
Otherwise, I shall require 25%.

1840
01:53:54,691 --> 01:53:58,549
But, Mr. Cusins, this is a
serious matter of business.

1841
01:53:58,653 --> 01:54:01,051
You're not bringing any
capital into the concern.

1842
01:54:01,155 --> 01:54:02,823
What? No capital?

1843
01:54:02,928 --> 01:54:06,055
Is my mastery of Greek no capital?

1844
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:08,453
Is my access to the subtlest thought...

1845
01:54:08,558 --> 01:54:12,102
the loftiest poetry yet
attained by humanity no capital?

1846
01:54:12,207 --> 01:54:15,856
My character? My intellect?
My life? My career?

1847
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:18,566
And what Barbara calls my soul?

1848
01:54:18,671 --> 01:54:20,339
Are these no capital?

1849
01:54:20,443 --> 01:54:23,258
- Say another word, and I double my salary.
- Be reasonable.

1850
01:54:23,466 --> 01:54:27,220
Mr. Undershaft, you have my
terms. Take them or leave them.

1851
01:54:27,428 --> 01:54:30,347
Very well. I note your
terms, and I offer you half.

1852
01:54:30,556 --> 01:54:32,641
- Half?
- Half.

1853
01:54:36,082 --> 01:54:38,897
You call yourself a gentleman,
then you offer me half?

1854
01:54:39,105 --> 01:54:41,920
I don't call myself a
gentleman, but I offer you half.

1855
01:54:42,024 --> 01:54:45,986
This to your future partner,
your successor, your son-in-law?

1856
01:54:46,090 --> 01:54:49,635
Leave me out of the
bargain please, Dolly.

1857
01:54:49,739 --> 01:54:52,450
You're selling your own soul, not mine.

1858
01:54:52,554 --> 01:54:57,454
Come, I'll go a step further for Barbara's sake.
I'll give you three-fifths, but that's my last word.

1859
01:54:57,559 --> 01:54:59,435
- Done!
- Done in the eye.

1860
01:55:01,833 --> 01:55:06,420
By the way, Mac, I'm a classical
scholar, not an arithmetical one.

1861
01:55:06,525 --> 01:55:10,069
Is three-fifths more than half or less?

1862
01:55:10,174 --> 01:55:12,050
More, of course.

1863
01:55:12,155 --> 01:55:14,657
I'd have taken 250.

1864
01:55:14,761 --> 01:55:16,638
How you can succeed in business...

1865
01:55:16,742 --> 01:55:19,661
when you're willing to pay all that
money to a university professor...

1866
01:55:19,765 --> 01:55:23,936
who obviously isn't worth a
junior clerk's wages, well...

1867
01:55:24,144 --> 01:55:25,604
What'll Lazarus say?

1868
01:55:25,812 --> 01:55:28,731
He'll be blamed for your rapacity
in money matters, poor fellow...

1869
01:55:28,836 --> 01:55:30,921
as he's hitherto been blamed for mine.

1870
01:55:31,025 --> 01:55:33,632
You're a shark of the
first order, Euripides.

1871
01:55:33,736 --> 01:55:35,717
So much the better for the firm.

1872
01:55:37,072 --> 01:55:41,034
Dolly, old fellow, think.
Think before you decide.

1873
01:55:41,034 --> 01:55:43,953
Do you feel that you're a
sufficiently practical man?

1874
01:55:44,057 --> 01:55:45,621
It's a huge undertaking.

1875
01:55:45,725 --> 01:55:47,811
An enormous responsibility.

1876
01:55:47,915 --> 01:55:50,313
All this mess of business
will be Greek to you.

1877
01:55:50,417 --> 01:55:53,023
I think it'll be much
less difficult than Greek.

1878
01:56:01,990 --> 01:56:04,805
- Bill!
- Hello, Judy!

1879
01:56:05,013 --> 01:56:08,454
What you think of it? Got
meself a job... 3.10 a week!

1880
01:56:08,558 --> 01:56:10,539
How's that for salvation, eh?

1881
01:56:10,643 --> 01:56:12,311
Barbara.

1882
01:56:14,813 --> 01:56:18,254
You understand, don't you, that I
had to decide without consulting you.

1883
01:56:18,358 --> 01:56:22,737
If I had left this choice to you, you'd
sooner or later have despised me for it.

1884
01:56:22,841 --> 01:56:25,030
Your father's challenge has beaten me.

1885
01:56:25,135 --> 01:56:27,324
Dare I make war on war?

1886
01:56:27,428 --> 01:56:30,243
I dare. I must!

1887
01:56:30,348 --> 01:56:31,911
I will.

1888
01:56:33,371 --> 01:56:37,333
And now, is it all over between us?

1889
01:56:37,541 --> 01:56:39,418
Silly baby Dolly.

1890
01:56:39,522 --> 01:56:41,399
How could it be?

1891
01:56:41,503 --> 01:56:43,171
Then you... You...

1892
01:56:43,171 --> 01:56:45,465
Oh, for my drum!

1893
01:56:45,569 --> 01:56:47,863
Take care, Dolly, take care.

1894
01:56:47,967 --> 01:56:52,033
Oh, if only I could get away from
you, from Father, and from it all.

1895
01:56:52,137 --> 01:56:54,014
- And leave me?
- Yes.

1896
01:56:54,222 --> 01:56:55,682
But I can't.

1897
01:56:55,891 --> 01:56:58,810
I was happy for a moment
in the Salvation Army...

1898
01:56:59,018 --> 01:57:02,667
but as soon as our money ran
short it all came back to Bodger.

1899
01:57:02,772 --> 01:57:05,274
Undershaft and Bodger.

1900
01:57:05,378 --> 01:57:07,567
Their hands stretch everywhere...

1901
01:57:07,567 --> 01:57:11,529
and as long as that lasts
there's no getting away from them.

1902
01:57:11,633 --> 01:57:14,761
Turning our backs on them
is turning our backs on life.

1903
01:57:14,865 --> 01:57:18,202
Do you know what would have happened
if you'd refused Papa's offer?

1904
01:57:18,306 --> 01:57:22,580
- I wonder. - I should have given you up
and married the man who'd accepted it.

1905
01:57:22,685 --> 01:57:27,168
After all, my dear old mother's
got more sense than any of you.

1906
01:57:27,272 --> 01:57:31,234
I felt like her when I saw this
place, felt that I must have it...

1907
01:57:31,338 --> 01:57:33,736
that never, never,
never could I let it go.

1908
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:37,489
Only she thought it was all the houses
and kitchen ranges and linen and china.

1909
01:57:37,594 --> 01:57:40,617
But it was really all the
human souls to be saved.

1910
01:57:40,721 --> 01:57:43,640
Not weak souls in starved bodies...

1911
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:47,394
sobbing with gratitude for
a scrap of bread and scrape...

1912
01:57:47,498 --> 01:57:50,000
but souls that are hungry...

1913
01:57:50,104 --> 01:57:52,502
because their bodies are full.

1914
01:57:53,545 --> 01:57:59,175
My father shall never throw it in my teeth
again that my converts were bribed with bread.

1915
01:57:59,279 --> 01:58:01,781
I have got rid of the bribe of bread.

1916
01:58:01,990 --> 01:58:04,909
I have got rid of the bribe of heaven.

1917
01:58:04,909 --> 01:58:07,620
Let God's work be done
for its own sake...

1918
01:58:07,724 --> 01:58:10,018
the work that he had
to create us to do...

1919
01:58:10,122 --> 01:58:13,145
because it cannot be done
except by living men and women.

1920
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:15,960
Then the way of life lies
through the factory of death.

1921
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:20,860
Yes, through the raising of hell
to heaven and of man to God...

1922
01:58:20,965 --> 01:58:23,675
through the unveiling
of an eternal light...

1923
01:58:23,779 --> 01:58:25,760
in the valley of the shadow.

1924
01:58:27,011 --> 01:58:29,931
Oh, did you think that my
courage would never come back?

1925
01:58:29,931 --> 01:58:32,120
Did you believe that I was a deserter...

1926
01:58:32,224 --> 01:58:36,812
that I, who have stood in the streets
and taken my people to my heart...

1927
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:40,252
and talked of the greatest and
holiest of things with them...

1928
01:58:40,356 --> 01:58:42,650
could ever turn back
and chatter foolishly...

1929
01:58:42,754 --> 01:58:45,256
to fashionable people about
nothing in a drawing room?

1930
01:58:45,361 --> 01:58:47,237
Never, never, never, never!

1931
01:58:47,342 --> 01:58:50,261
Sooner than that I'd sweep
out the gun-cotton sheds...

1932
01:58:50,365 --> 01:58:52,242
or be one of Bodger's barmaids.

1933
01:58:52,346 --> 01:58:54,535
Major Barbara will die with the colors!

1934
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:57,142
Glory, hallelujah.

1935
01:58:57,246 --> 01:59:00,061
Mamal Mamal

1936
01:59:00,165 --> 01:59:03,189
- Well, what did she say?
- She's gone right up into the skies!

1937
01:59:03,293 --> 01:59:05,691
- Mama!
- Well, Barbara, what do you want?

1938
01:59:05,795 --> 01:59:08,610
A house in the village
to live in with Dolly!

1939
01:59:19,766 --> 01:59:22,893
6:00 tomorrow morning, Euripides!

1940
01:59:22,998 --> 01:59:27,168
I'll see the whole place blown up with
its own dynamite before I get up at 5:00!

1941
01:59:28,732 --> 01:59:31,860
Here! Remember my tip, mate.

1942
01:59:31,964 --> 01:59:35,196
Stop her jaw, or you'll
die afore your time!

1943
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:38,011
Wore out, that's what
you'll be! Wore out!
