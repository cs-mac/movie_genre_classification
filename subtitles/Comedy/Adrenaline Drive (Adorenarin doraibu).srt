6
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,215
You should've gone right.

7
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,951
What?
Oh, right.

8
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:24,681
Whoops.
I guess you were right.

9
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,414
You marked it on the map.

10
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:37,495
I thought so. Boss, remember last
time we delivered the car?

11
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:41,790
We went way out of our way.
So I marked it on the map.

12
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,300
Why... why didn't you tell me
that back there!

13
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:49,271
Well, I thought
I might be wrong.

14
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,442
Of course not! You marked it
on the damn map!

15
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,377
Guess you're right.

16
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:01,879
Can't you be more direct.
It's a pain in the ass.

17
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:03,780
Yeah...

18
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,993
Don't "yeah" me.
You don't trust me, do you?

19
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,524
I trust you.

20
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,788
No you don't.

21
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,465
Yes I do.

22
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,064
Then why'd you talk to
Hosoya about quitting?

23
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,466
Um, I...

24
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:27,403
That's not right.
Got a problem, come talk to me.

25
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,081
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,481
I really don't get you.

27
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,417
Am I that tough to talk to?

28
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,324
No, that's not true.

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,191
No, I know.
You hate me, don't you?

30
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,024
That's not true.

31
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:50,066
It's OK, you can tell me.
You hate me, right?

32
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,170
I don't hate you.

33
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,102
I told you, it's OK.
I won't blow up.

34
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:59,435
Listen, we're only human.
Nobody's perfect.

35
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:03,510
Don't you hate it when
I harass you like this?

36
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:08,553
Um, well, alright,
maybe a little...

37
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,450
Told you so.

38
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:16,360
You hate me. You want to quit.
But I'll never let you.

39
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:26,433
What's that look for?
That's it. You work late today.

40
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,904
Why?

41
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,870
We need to have a little talk.

42
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,605
Um... tonight's not really...

43
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,644
Just spit it out!
God, you're irritating!

44
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,049
Don't you ever lose it?

45
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:46,983
What?

46
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,887
Come on scream at me.
Just once.

47
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,893
- Stop it!
- Look out!

48
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,332
Please stop it!

49
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,663
You're gonna hit something
unless you scream!

50
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,838
I said, cut it out.

51
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,945
What did you just say?

52
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,480
What? Nothing.

53
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,653
What did you just say?
Say it again, dammit!

54
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,482
No, I...

55
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,057
Just joking.

56
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,423
Scared you, huh.

57
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,367
See? You can do it if you
really try. Hang in there.

58
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,449
Idiot! Look what you've done!

59
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,397
Hide the company name.

60
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,076
"RENT A CAR"

61
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,626
Can't drive on an empty road?

62
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,460
I'm sorry...

63
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,197
I'm sorry...

64
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:18,937
I'm in a rush. What's your number?
One of the gang will pay you a visit.

65
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,643
Um... Well...

66
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,583
No way out of this one, guys.

67
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,912
Um... um, a telephone number?

68
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:34,825
- Yeah.
- It's 0774436.

69
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,723
That your work number?

70
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,089
Yes.

71
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:44,067
0774436, huh?
The address? An address!

72
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:51,268
Oh my address. Yes.
2293 Kasumigaura Hatano City.

73
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,113
That was tricky.

74
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,148
You made it all up.

75
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,979
Made what up?

76
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,317
The number and address.

77
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,024
I'm not telling him the truth.
He might come to the agency.

78
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,666
These thugs are so dumb.

79
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,146
Hey.

80
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,840
What was that number again?

81
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:31,483
Yes.

82
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,486
0776655...

83
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,818
You said 4436.
You made it all up.

84
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,122
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,124
Your license.

86
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,631
Oh, sorry.
I don't have it with me.

87
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,972
Not you, the other one.

88
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,680
Come with me to the gang's office.

89
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,552
I'm not going.

90
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,659
What! Why not?

91
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,423
You're the one that hit his car.
You go. I'll go on back.

92
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,724
That's not...

93
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,833
You go ahead.

94
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:27,438
Besides, he's got your license.
You've got no choice.

95
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,241
Hey, get moving.

96
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,520
It's your problem now.

97
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,346
- Can you believe she got married?
- How'd she land him?

98
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,882
Bet she jumped a gut at a club.
She's always partying.

99
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,677
Way possible.

100
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,280
Where's she get all
that energy.

101
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,516
By the time I'm done,
I'm too beat to go anywhere.

102
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,889
I never guessed it'd be like this.

103
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,695
Can you believe how
early it still is.

104
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,566
My horoscope sucks this week.

105
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,034
What's it say?

106
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,442
"Your social habits
will delay matrimony."

107
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,238
- They're right.
- Why?

108
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:44,783
While you're making up your mind,
your guys get hitched to somebody else.

109
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,384
That's ancient history now.

110
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,923
Shizuko, have you got,
like a boyfriend.

111
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,794
Well, I'm too busy to...

112
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,899
Right? You too, huh?
No boyfriends here either.

113
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:07,269
I just wish something exciting
would turn up.

114
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,842
I want some money.
Life would be so much better.

115
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:19,245
Money's great, but... I want a
thrill to really shake things up...

116
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:23,186
Like an outrageously romantic...
good looking guy.

117
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,814
A guy, huh?
You always want a guy.

118
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,188
Exactly, of course.
Handsome is good, but...

119
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:35,299
- Money! Rich! He's got to be rich!
- Gotta have fun in life!

120
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,799
What are you going on about?

121
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,869
Sorry. We'll get to work.

122
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,539
Finished those reports?

123
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,730
Almost done.

124
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:47,438
You've got a mountain of work.
No dawdling.

125
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,812
Shizuko, shouldn't you go home?

126
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,278
Take off early
now and then and relax.

127
00:10:54,887 --> 00:11:01,053
If you're not efficient, your
personal life will go down the drain.

128
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,363
All work and no play,
you'll end up like me.

129
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,398
You two will be fine, I'm sure.
Work hard, now.

130
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:23,310
What's that supposed to mean,
we'll be fine!?

131
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,417
Scary. She's keeping tabs.
She's onto us.

132
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,982
Old eagle eyes on the look out!

133
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,225
Shizuko, what's your sign?

134
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,994
I'm a Leo.

135
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,537
- I'll read your horoscope.
- That's not it.

136
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,775
Here it is.

137
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:55,836
"Serious and shy by nature,
you seek an opportunity to change."

138
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,845
"Now's your chance to
meet your new self!"

139
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,519
"Step out and take a chance!!"

140
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,851
Go for it, Shizuko.
It's your week!!

141
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,855
There's all this great stuff
about stepping out,

142
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,896
How about going, right now!

143
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,898
Like to the convenience store!

144
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,365
Can I come along?

145
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,938
We're still finishing up here.
You go get us something.

146
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,286
Shizuko's such a wimp.

147
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,398
Wasn't there one in your class?
Always studying.

148
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,833
Her shift's over.
She should go home.

149
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:57,236
There's lots of people like her.
She'll always be like that.

150
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,845
I wonder what she sees in life.

151
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,912
Exactly.

152
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,186
- Hey!
- Yes.

153
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,858
Don't just stand there.
Make some tea.

154
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,389
Um... no... I'm...

155
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,498
- Shut up and do it!
- Yes.

156
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,982
What are you doing?

157
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,157
Making tea...

158
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,384
Get over here.

159
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:40,705
- You a student? You work?
- Yes.

160
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:46,583
- So what do they pay you?
- What?

161
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,090
What's your salary?

162
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,356
Oh, um, 190,000 yen.

163
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,960
Huh. Can't make much these days.
The recession and all.

164
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,697
Know what that money's from?

165
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:12,933
They're bookies - horse
bicycle and boat races.

166
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,879
Today alone, over a dozen guys
have brought in money.

167
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:24,415
That money is our lifeblood.

168
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:26,923
It's our business.

169
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,387
You make legit money.
We make it under the table.

170
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,998
Under the table's better.

171
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,615
What are you, idiots!?
I said make some tea!

172
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:01,021
Answer me, goddammit!
What the fuck is it with you!

173
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,524
It's your job to educate them dammit!

174
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:13,370
- So, what can you pay?
- What!?

175
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,807
What's so shocking?
It's our business. I told you.

176
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,949
At least this much.

177
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,617
What! Five?

178
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,787
Not 500,000.
We're talkin' Jaguar here.

179
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,548
5,000,000...

180
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:36,118
Obviously there are limits
to your personal finances.

181
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,426
We could talk to your boss...

182
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,435
No, I...

183
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,811
Show me your hand.

184
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:59,039
Your hand, spread your palm.

185
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,709
Want a discount?

186
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,926
Want another discount?

187
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,745
You OK!?

188
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,579
I'm fine.

189
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,484
- What happened?
- I don't...

190
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,968
What is this?
What happened?

191
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,969
No, I... just got here myself.

192
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,366
And you?

193
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,841
I work at the General Hospital.
I was nearby when...

194
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,846
Can you help us out?
Make sure he gets to the hospital.

195
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,685
Get it together!
You're a nurse!

196
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,845
OK, let's go.

197
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,643
Oh, I'm sorry.

198
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,085
Where does it hurt?

199
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,722
Stretcher coming in.

200
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,368
Take care.

201
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,680
What happened!?

202
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,046
Ayakuza den...

203
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,184
Yazuka!?

204
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,926
The police will have questions.

205
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,295
No, um, I...

206
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,232
What the hell...

207
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,310
Hey!

208
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,437
Are you OK?

209
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:17,632
No, I'm not a...
I hit a yakuza's car and I...

210
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,409
I was there by chance.
I swear.

211
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,461
Hey!

212
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,346
What are you doing?

213
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,592
Is that your money?

214
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:51,400
It's yakuza money.
He said it was under the table.

215
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,839
What are you doing!?

216
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:00,006
It's nobody's now.

217
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,576
Nobody's?

218
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,184
Ouch.

219
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:04,360
Are you OK? Lie down.
Put your legs here.

220
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:16,246
Broken left finger,
lacerated right leg. No burns.

221
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,974
You're OK?

222
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:22,046
Are you OK? We heard
there was a terrible accident.

223
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,374
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

224
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,050
Your glasses broke.

225
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:33,917
An organized crime ring?
How scary. Gang war?

226
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,227
- Just a gas leak that blew up.

227
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:41,724
- Just as well.
They'll leave us alone.

228
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:48,002
Hey, weren't you
going to the store?

229
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:51,733
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot...

230
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:56,640
That's OK. Emergency said
you were carrying something.

231
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:00,079
I'm sorry.
Nothing from the store.

232
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,654
Forget it. We're taking off,
aren't you?

233
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:05,914
Yes I am.

234
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,851
Is something wrong?

235
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,262
No, I'm fine.

236
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,992
Shizuko! Shall we get someone?

237
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,329
I said, I'm fine!

238
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,601
Excuse me!

239
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,974
I have to change too.

240
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,479
See you later.

241
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,051
Bye bye.

242
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,580
What's up?

243
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,015
Just checking on the patient.

244
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,250
He's fine. A simple fracture
and four stitches.

245
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,962
Say, you've skinned your knee.

246
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,695
Here, do it yourself.

247
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,202
There you are.

248
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:11,440
Both of you, actually. The police
want to ask you some questions.

249
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,752
"Suddenly, the ambulance
had an accident."

250
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:24,819
"We were thrown by the impact as
the ambulance hit a vehicle"

251
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,624
"parked in the left lane."

252
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:31,200
"Shortly thereafter, from the
riverbank 30 yards away,"

253
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:36,305
"we watched the ambulance
sink into the Maruko river."

254
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,634
"At 9:43..."

255
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,366
Can I get you something?

256
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:42,771
I'm sick of coffee...
an iced cocoa.

257
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,081
No such thing.

258
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,149
Yes there is.

259
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,383
No way.

260
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,712
Yes there is.

261
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,878
You're right.

262
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:56,159
"So... at 9:43
the police car arrived..."

263
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,287
"and took us to
the General Hospital."

264
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,656
Is that statement accurate?

265
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,335
Yes.

266
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:09,395
We may question you again
after we recover the ambulance.

267
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,510
The ambulance is still there?

268
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,180
It'll take some time.
The current's pretty strong.

269
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:23,747
But it's hard to fathom
an accident on that clear road.

270
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,423
Um...

271
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,583
You say the gangster was
unconscious throughout?

272
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,593
Yes.

273
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,857
Yes, he was.

274
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,296
Are you sure?

275
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:46,702
Well, everything happened so quickly...
I'm not really sure...

276
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,969
I understand. I'm sorry.

277
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:53,308
Sign this please.

278
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,136
Thanks for your help.

279
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,516
It's already lunch time.

280
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,181
Sorry we kept you so long.

281
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,092
- Excuse me...
- Yes?

282
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:44,065
Did any of the gang survive?

283
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,027
No one.

284
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,009
You think we're OK?

285
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:59,547
We're fine. As long as we
don't mess up.

286
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,516
Where is it?

287
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,344
In my locker.

288
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,791
I guess we should
move it somewhere...

289
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,394
You have a place?

290
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,891
I share a room in the dormitory.

291
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,533
So, my place OK?

292
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,559
It's tiny, but...

293
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:20,871
Um... sure.

294
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,467
Excuse us.

295
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:26,871
Yes!?

296
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,605
Any lunch recommendations?

297
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,879
What? Oh...

298
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,782
Try the daily special.

299
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,580
Oh, thanks.

300
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:44,057
Daily special huh?
I'll stick to noodles.

301
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,621
Can you lock it?

302
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,832
C'mon in.

303
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:50,450
215.

304
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,852
Million and...

305
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,686
320,000 yen.

306
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,963
Split it?

307
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:06,870
What?

308
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,874
Sure.

309
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,207
If we split it...

310
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:21,373
107 million, 660,000 yen.

311
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,922
Maybe we shouldn't
see each other again...

312
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:36,231
Try to act like nothing's changed.

313
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,829
Oh well.
I guess you're right.

314
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,643
Do you have a bag or something?

315
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,979
Yeah, wait a second.

316
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:02,750
Here.

317
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,923
I'll give it back later?

318
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,289
You can keep it.

319
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,425
Oh, OK.

320
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,880
Well, I...

321
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,266
Um, say...

322
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,558
What?

323
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:24,502
Aren't you hungry?
How about a bowl of noodles?

324
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,267
Sure.

325
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:31,679
Wait a minute, OK.

326
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:41,020
All this money and we eat noodles.

327
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,860
We should've gone out.

328
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,698
Nothing's open...

329
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,095
Sleep over somewhere?

330
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:01,891
Nothing like that.

331
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,829
What then? A guy, right?

332
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,027
No.

333
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,174
What is that?
A little unusual, no?

334
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,368
It's nothing...

335
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,339
Another emergency patient.

336
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,174
Shall we run?

337
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,375
Forget it. What a pain.

338
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:24,855
Oh!

339
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,454
You know him?

340
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:32,193
Boss... there was this huge
disaster at their office,

341
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,756
and I can't work for a while.

342
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,200
I'm quitting.

343
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:46,973
I mean, my hand's fractured,

344
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:51,812
I was the one driving, so I guess...

345
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:57,548
Um, I'm just not right for the job.

346
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:00,781
I'm just not right for it.

347
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:13,058
Hello... Suzuki speaking.
Oh! It's me.

348
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,585
Thanks for yesterday.

349
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:42,698
Sorry to call you back.
This won't take long.

350
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:50,366
Are you sure this is him?

351
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:52,500
Yes.

352
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,671
I'm positive.

353
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:59,774
He's in bad shape. We'll
question him when he recovers.

354
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,542
And that'll be that.

355
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:06,947
But if he hurt you, you
should sue him.

356
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,454
Say it wasn't the accident
that caused your injuries...

357
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,730
If he inflicted them intentionally.

358
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,033
No... nothing...

359
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,128
I see...

360
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,003
In that case, fine.

361
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:32,682
Should we turn in the
money to the police?

362
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,981
Let's run away!
Some place far!

363
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,817
Run away...
But what about that guy...

364
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:44,518
It'll take him awhile to recover.
We can get away.

365
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:07,842
Excuse me. Your car's in the way.
Move it please.

366
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,511
What happened?

367
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,587
And you are?

368
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:11,848
It's our office.

369
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:16,425
I see. There was a gas explosion.
It's off limits now.

370
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,616
Explosion?

371
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:18,884
Yes.

372
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,293
What exploded?

373
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:21,962
No idea.

374
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,292
Why'd it explode?

375
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:29,900
They took the wounded
to the nearby hospital.

376
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,400
All burnt up!

377
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,714
- All burnt up!
- All bummed out!

378
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,047
Wanna fight?

379
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,283
Wanna fight!

380
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,164
Excuse us.

381
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,977
How are you?

382
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,811
They only showed this room.
The others...

383
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,523
All dead?

384
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,883
The really croaked?

385
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,172
Sorry, it's only a light.

386
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,174
Something to write with!

387
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:44,939
Use this.

388
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,110
Paper, paper!

389
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,698
"GET THE MONEY BACK"

390
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,672
And Suzuki... who?
How do you pronounce it?

391
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:11,775
Satoru.

392
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,776
Who's that?

393
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,048
Get the money back?

394
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:21,682
What are you doing here?
You can't be here.

395
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,582
He's not allowed
visitors yet, get out.

396
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:31,088
Be quiet... I'm closing it.

397
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,193
I'll get away with it...

398
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:40,303
With what?

399
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,894
Tossing the leftovers...

400
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,198
Who gives a shit.

401
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,865
Awesome! I can quit the gang.

402
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,443
There's nothing left to quit.

403
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,677
That asshole beat me up.

404
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,975
Shut up, he'll hear you.

405
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,182
Stop that!

406
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,183
Just copping a feel. Bitch!

407
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,150
I'll call security!

408
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:08,127
Mind your own fucking business!

409
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,197
So sorry to bother you!

410
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,066
"Suzuki Satoru"

411
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:28,477
I'm not home right now.
Please call back.

412
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,888
I'm taking a break!

413
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,147
What? I see.

414
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:38,552
Gee, I'm really sorry.
But hey, it wasn't so bad.

415
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:43,760
Friend of mine hit a Mercedes.
Got soaked for 2 million.

416
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:50,971
Um...
I still want out.

417
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:54,575
How you gonna make it
with no job?

418
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:59,074
I received some damages.
I'll be fine.

419
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:03,444
I don't know how much
you got, but it won't last.

420
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:07,012
Life is tougher than you think.

421
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:09,781
But...

422
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:15,093
Hey, Suzuki. Sounds like
you had a hell of a time.

423
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,432
Yeah, well...

424
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,425
You OK?

425
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,697
Did he threaten to come here?

426
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,139
No...

427
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,872
Is that really broken?

428
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,545
Did he break it?

429
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,116
Um...

430
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,008
Something wrong?

431
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,881
No, he's fine, just fine, right?

432
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,717
He's just babbling
about wanting to quit.

433
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,953
I've made up my mind.

434
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:53,665
You just keep repeating yourself.
I paid for the car repairs.

435
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,736
Be a little grateful.

436
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,178
What's this?

437
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:09,318
The cost of the repairs.
If that's not enough I'll bring more.

438
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,158
Don't you sass me, Suzuki.

439
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:19,223
Try hitting me
if you really want to quit.

440
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,861
See, bet you can't.

441
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:30,534
Hit me back, hey. Hit me.

442
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:34,574
This kid's hopeless.

443
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:42,776
Huh?

444
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,551
Hey, you know...

445
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,156
the Harumi apartments?

446
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,482
Harumi...

447
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,787
This is the address.

448
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,430
Well, you see, um...

449
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:33,797
Turn right there, and...

450
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,336
Why don't you just take us...

451
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:38,740
I'm in a rush, sorry...

452
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,068
Oh, please!

453
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,410
- Sorry.
- Oh, please!

454
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:45,346
That's enough godammit!

455
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,583
Oh, c'mon, come with us.

456
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,978
Where is it?

457
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,086
Um, the right...

458
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:52,312
That right?

459
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:34,858
Oops? Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't know where I am.

460
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:36,732
I think I'm lost.

461
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:37,900
You're useless.

462
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,002
I'm sorry.

463
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,126
Forget it.

464
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:42,232
Oh, excuse us.

465
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:45,072
Where are we?

466
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:51,475
Harumi Apartments. Turn right up
there and you'll see them.

467
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:52,615
Wrong way.

468
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,842
We were right.

469
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,143
I'm sorry.

470
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:18,999
We're there.

471
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:20,908
Got it, got it!

472
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,888
- What!?
- Shhhh!

473
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,048
What?

474
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,788
Jump down from there.

475
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:40,963
Why?

476
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:42,122
Yakuza!

477
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:45,631
See, it was right here,
that dumb nurse.

478
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,103
Dumb nurse.

479
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,072
Hello... hey, it's open.

480
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,972
No way he's here.
Took off, huh.

481
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,909
Excuse us...

482
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,045
Layout's like mine.

483
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,450
Want a drink?

484
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,081
Any beer?

485
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:23,599
Guys, we should get that
money back and keep it.

486
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,637
We earned it, man.

487
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,106
We gotta give it back, man.

488
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,643
Back to who?
The asshole Kuroiwa?

489
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,474
Forget it, man.

490
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,240
But it's Kuroiwa.

491
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:39,178
I'm not scared of him anymore.
Look at the shape he's in.

492
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:43,086
You don't know him, man.
He's a monster.

493
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,193
Tell me what's so scary?

494
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:48,296
You won't be able to
take a piss at night.

495
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:49,863
I don't piss at night.

496
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:52,034
Just tell us.

497
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:55,261
Fine. You know that gut Nanba?

498
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,838
That pachinko parlor owner who...

499
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,011
Run!

500
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,417
Wow!

501
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,951
Hey man... the money!

502
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:12,682
Hold it down, man!

503
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,187
Chill, man.

504
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,004
Little bitch!

505
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:43,576
Where the fuck!

506
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,218
Goddammit!

507
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:56,090
I'm over here!
Run!

508
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:13,990
"He gave me a ride, and we
drove through the summer night"

509
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:25,440
"He gave me a ride and I came
to a town at the end of the line"

510
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:30,210
Where are we going?

511
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,780
No idea, man.

512
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,040
To the beach!

513
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:36,270
What beach?
We're surrounded by fields!

514
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:37,450
To the mountains!

515
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:38,620
Which is it?

516
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,690
Hot springs!

517
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,950
- Oh oh!
- What's the dif, man.

518
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,080
We're never gonna find them.

519
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:46,290
I know this one.

520
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,220
Excellent tune.

521
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,390
Golden Oldies. Not cool.

522
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,960
- No Rock?
- Cut it out. It's a great tune.

523
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:57,940
"The cool morning sea..."

524
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,070
"reflected like a mirror"

525
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:07,380
- You sing too!
- No way man.

526
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,010
- I said, sing!
- No way.

527
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,210
It's cool, man.

528
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,840
No it's not!

529
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:32,940
"To keep the sadness at bay..."

530
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,580
What happened!
What did he do?

531
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,050
He told me I have
three holes in my nose.

532
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:52,660
Hey, what's going on?

533
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,860
I'm sorry, but I can't handle
that patient anymore.

534
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:59,800
I'm sorry but
he's too much for us.

535
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,600
Fine, go back then.

536
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:03,930
I'm sorry.

537
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:13,080
How are you?

538
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,510
I get grandma, huh.

539
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,020
If you're well enough
to insult me, we don't need this.

540
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:26,450
Gimmie a cigarette!

541
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,390
There's no smoking.

542
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,860
You'll have smoke coming
out of all your stitches.

543
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:38,960
What are you up to now.

544
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:41,570
Get this fucking stuff off of me.

545
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:47,880
I will not. These machines are
what's keeping you alive.

546
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,210
Get me the fuck outta here!

547
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:52,880
Who cares about my life!

548
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:56,460
Out of the question!

549
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:02,130
We're working hard
to save that life.

550
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:08,170
Don't forget, you're not living,
we're keeping you alive!

551
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,240
Oh, all right.

552
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,740
Excuse me for screaming.

553
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,680
Are you passing?

554
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:25,940
What?

555
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,250
Shit, I mean.

556
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,750
Forget it.

557
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,190
Are you embarrassed?

558
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,590
Ridiculous!

559
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:35,560
Let's move you
over and check.

560
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,460
Who cares what
this grandma, sees, right?

561
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:50,070
I'll be your host 'til 6 o'clock, with
Brand New Day, Brand New Song,

562
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:54,440
An afternoon of music
and conversation...

563
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,100
It doesn't feel real.

564
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:54,040
We did it!
We really did it!

565
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:25,700
I just can't believe it.

566
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:30,770
I can't believe I really did it.

567
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,410
Hey, stop it...

568
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:06,880
Yes, hello.

569
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:09,450
Hi, it's me.

570
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,250
Where are you?

571
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,120
Head nurse is furious.

572
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:15,820
It's Shizuko.

573
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:20,420
I've decided to quit.

574
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:21,830
Are you serious!

575
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:22,920
You really quit?

576
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:24,000
Yeah.

577
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,970
So I'm not coming
back anymore.

578
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:28,570
Something happened?

579
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,670
What? No.

580
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,640
Are you with someone?

581
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:38,970
Yeah.

582
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:43,680
Who is it?
That car rental guy?

583
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:46,920
Yeah...

584
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:50,380
I got it!
You're getting married!

585
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:55,820
What!?
Um... yeah.

586
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:58,490
Go girl!

587
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,570
I'll tell the head nurse for you.

588
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:21,350
It's the first time in my
whole life I ever felt this way.

589
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:24,550
I know. I know how you feel.

590
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:26,890
You do? You really do?

591
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:32,030
Got any real food here?

592
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,360
Aren't we perky.

593
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:11,570
Yes.

594
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,670
May I help you?

595
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:22,250
Um... do you have a room?

596
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:27,820
Double or single?

597
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:32,590
Is there a suite?

598
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:35,260
A suite?

599
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:42,860
We do have a suite
but the cost may be...

600
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,630
We'll take it.

601
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:48,980
But...

602
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,380
What is it? Money, we've got.

603
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:54,450
You want cash up front?
How much.

604
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:56,710
I'm terribly sorry.

605
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:01,950
Can you sign here please?

606
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,180
Signature?

607
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:07,960
We're married...

608
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:24,810
"Mr. And Mrs. John Doe"

609
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:39,260
A marble bathroom!

610
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:52,200
Hey, look...

611
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:05,080
What is it?

612
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:17,930
And tell your father
you got married.

613
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,720
OK, I will.

614
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:20,920
Where are you?

615
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:26,700
A suite in the Art Land Hotel.

616
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:28,500
We'll call again, OK?

617
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:29,580
OK.

618
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,010
Are you listening?

619
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,480
I found a safe.

620
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:42,720
I'm fine.
I'll hold onto mine.

621
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:45,380
Why?

622
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:48,760
Why? Don't you
want to spend it?

623
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:51,330
Sure, but...

624
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:04,810
Are you sure?

625
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:13,790
You can't trust that safe.
The staff can open it.

626
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:15,350
It's a combination lock.

627
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:22,820
I just press those numbers?

628
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:24,990
Yeah.

629
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:27,600
Then I'll steal your money.

630
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,860
No you won't.

631
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,510
So you trust me?

632
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:15,050
You sure... about me?

633
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,890
Let's get room service.

634
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:29,660
Oh, let's go out on the town.

635
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:54,680
Come in.

636
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:10,120
Welcome. How can
I help you?

637
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:14,260
Um... Um...

638
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:17,870
An engagement ring?
What size?

639
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,860
Size?

640
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,210
One size fits all?

641
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:38,290
Say, where are you going?

642
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:53,230
So?

643
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,370
Um...

644
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:02,380
You were really pretty.

645
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,150
Is that a compliment?

646
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:07,750
No, no.

647
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,910
- No?
- No, I mean, um...

648
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,330
Step a little closer to the bride.

649
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:23,230
OK.

650
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,330
Look happy.

651
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:29,800
"We got Married - We're so Happy"

652
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:31,710
They'll look like this.

653
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:34,940
Great. When will they be ready?

654
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:36,020
Today.

655
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,610
Can you deliver them
to the Art Land Hotel?

656
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,550
- I will.
- Thank you.

657
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,490
Why the cards?

658
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:46,560
Don't worry.

659
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,630
Can you believe I've
never been on an airplane?

660
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:56,070
The head nurse and I were
the only ones who hadn't.

661
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,600
I've never either.

662
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:03,600
Yes sir!
Hawaii, here I come!

663
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:05,310
Hawaii...

664
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,270
I want to go.

665
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,580
Mail the cards from there.

666
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,050
Oh...

667
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,530
Oh! Say, are you OK?

668
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,460
Shall we go back to the hotel.

669
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,800
How crude...

670
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:35,300
So that's your motive.
Get me drunk and...

671
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:38,770
Motive... what motive?

672
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:41,140
That's what I'm asking.

673
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,420
There's no motive.

674
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,450
So, where shall we sleep?

675
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:48,820
I knew it. You wanted
to sleep together.

676
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,520
What do you mean "I knew it."
You started this.

677
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:54,750
I did no such thing.

678
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:58,090
You brought it up.

679
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:10,640
Bathroom break.

680
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:30,360
Excuse me! Another bottle!
Your most expensive wine!

681
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,570
Um... this is...

682
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,230
I want to...

683
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,160
May I sit down?

684
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,760
I'm Shimada.
I run a little hotel here.

685
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:09,940
I see.

686
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:13,170
You're not from
around here are you?

687
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,440
We're traveling.

688
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:21,270
You're so beautiful,
I couldn't help noticing.

689
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,090
I was working in
a hotel in the city...

690
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,150
I see.

691
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:30,950
But France seems to
suit me better.

692
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:32,860
So I'll soon quit.

693
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:38,430
Oh, this is Shimada san.
He used to be a sommelier.

694
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:41,230
He knows everything about wine.

695
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,230
Hello.

696
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:47,710
Are you her brother?

697
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:53,310
The Romanee Conti 1978
complements the food beautifully.

698
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:58,950
Oh, really?
I get it. Thanks.

699
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,050
Thank you kindly.

700
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:06,750
Well, excuse me then.

701
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:23,110
Why were you so rude?

702
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,140
He thought I was your brother!

703
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:30,910
So what! The married thing's
just a cover.

704
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,990
I'm not your property, so there!

705
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:22,470
For me?

706
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:38,980
What are you doing
you idiot!

707
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:42,850
You're unbelievable!

708
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:04,570
Excuse me, nurse.

709
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:05,750
Yes?

710
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:09,550
What is it?

711
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:15,850
That guy Suzuki from my ambulance.
Has he left?

712
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:21,180
Oh, he married one of our nurses.
They're away on a trip.

713
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:25,530
Married! To that nurse, Shizuko?

714
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:29,400
That's right. She was in
the ambulance, too.

715
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,630
Where'd they go?

716
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,400
That I don't know.

717
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,370
I see.

718
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,310
Is that all?

719
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:43,480
Hey! You got a cell phone?

720
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,710
Cell phones aren't allowed.

721
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:49,550
Bring me the pay phone.

722
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,730
That's a little...

723
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:55,390
These machines that sensitive?

724
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,230
No, actually the sensitive?
Stuff is in the other wing,

725
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:06,400
but they can't be bothered with
making certain areas on or off limits,

726
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:09,580
so they're not allowed anywhere.

727
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:11,110
Just ten minutes?

728
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:14,440
I'll pay you later. Please?

729
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:18,480
I'll go get mine
from my locker.

730
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:22,590
Please don't tell head nurse.
She'll scold me.

731
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:31,660
"SATO Shizuko"

732
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:37,370
Hello. Nurses' dormitory.

733
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,930
Oh, hi. This is the
delivery service.

734
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,800
Is Sato Shizuko in?

735
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:50,620
Oh, that's too bad.

736
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:58,590
She asked us to forward
a package to her parents' house.

737
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:01,660
But the address is illegible.

738
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:06,220
Do you have their address
and phone number?

739
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:12,460
Hello. Is this the Sato residence?
Your daughter took care of me.

740
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:16,300
Yes, congratulations.

741
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:21,680
I'd like to send her
a wedding present.

742
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:28,080
I thought you might know where she is.

743
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:30,420
That idiot!

744
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:43,730
What are you doing?

745
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,900
Shimada san!

746
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:52,510
Hey!

747
01:20:10,990 --> 01:20:12,480
Goddammit!

748
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,760
Goddammit!

749
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:50,630
Give it back.

750
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:54,460
Give it back.

751
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:57,330
I said, give it,

752
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:00,340
back.

753
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:09,810
What's going on back here?

754
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:15,690
Are you OK sir?

755
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:17,860
He tried to steal this.

756
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,830
No, that's wrong.

757
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:25,000
Sit down, you're drunk.

758
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,330
Wait a minute.

759
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,830
What the...

760
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:37,180
Excuse me.
I'm getting off here.

761
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,480
What's wrong?

762
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:22,710
- Are you OK?
- An ambulance...

763
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:25,620
I'll go call one.

764
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:36,770
Hey! Give me back my bag!

765
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:16,770
What are you doing?
You can't walk around.

766
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,710
I have something to take care of.

767
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,110
You can't just walk out of here!

768
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:26,880
Just one day?
I promise I'll come back.

769
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:31,050
I said no. You can't go
anywhere in such shape.

770
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:38,520
If you let me go, one day,
just one day, I'll pay you...

771
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,900
A million.

772
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:46,870
You're really trying
to bribe a nurse?

773
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:48,400
OK, two million.

774
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,870
For three I'd think about it...

775
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,510
OK. Three million.

776
01:23:55,950 --> 01:23:58,580
If the hospital
finds out, I'm fired.

777
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:01,220
I'll take care of you.

778
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:05,490
You can barely
take care of yourself.

779
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:07,250
That'll change.

780
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:12,660
Excuse me.

781
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:20,770
Really tasty.

782
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:22,170
Amazing.

783
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:23,370
Delicious.

784
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,940
You marinate the pork?

785
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:28,840
You must, it's so good.

786
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:33,350
And the eggs are
just the right touch.

787
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:34,590
Special eggs?

788
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:36,050
Regular eggs.

789
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:41,030
And the soup is divine.

790
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:42,720
I drank mine all up.

791
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:43,920
What's in the stock?

792
01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:45,460
Pig's feet.

793
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:48,500
Pig's feet.

794
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,570
How dare you!

795
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:51,530
Feed us pig's feet!

796
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:54,960
You expect to be paid for that!

797
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:57,140
That's ridiculous!

798
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:01,440
What the fuck!

799
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:12,380
What do we owe?

800
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:14,220
About 2,000 each?

801
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:17,890
I only have small change...

802
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:20,730
Hey!

803
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:22,670
A security camera recorded,

804
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:28,670
these images of a woman who
chased a bus three miles...

805
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,940
after her bag was snatched.
She caught the suspect,

806
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:37,470
when he collapsed
in cardiac arrest.

807
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:43,250
She saved his life by
performing CPR.

808
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:46,950
She turned out to be a nurse.

809
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:53,190
Sorry to keep you waiting.

810
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:55,530
Can I go now?

811
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:57,800
Oh, yes, thank you.

812
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:00,470
No?

813
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:01,540
What?

814
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:02,780
No reward?

815
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:05,540
Sorry we don't do that.

816
01:26:06,010 --> 01:26:09,970
Fine, I'll go then.

817
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:14,350
But tell him he shouldn't
be drunk on the bus.

818
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:19,360
Next time, don't take
matters into your own hands.

819
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:22,450
Call the police first, OK?

820
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:31,200
Good evening.

821
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:35,500
Do you have a reservation?

822
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,330
No.

823
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:40,010
I'm staying in the Suite.

824
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:42,370
Oh, excuse me!

825
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:47,480
Welcome back.

826
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:51,250
You have a message.

827
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:55,550
"Congratulations!
- Mom and Dad"

828
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:01,360
There's also a package
for you.

829
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:07,000
Front Desk speaking.

830
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:11,670
She just came in.
Shall I put you through?

831
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:15,680
There's a call for you.

832
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:17,910
Hello.

833
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:22,680
Idiot...

834
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,380
Never thought
I'd travel at this hour.

835
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:05,120
Once in a while,
this sort of place is nice.

836
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:12,240
Can you get me a coffee?

837
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,670
Oh, sure.

838
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,270
Sort of like the morning after.

839
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:34,290
Wait here a minute.

840
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,860
Bastard!

841
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:05,390
"We Got Married"

842
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:50,830
Where's the nurse
who was on the news?

843
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,000
What?

844
01:29:52,210 --> 01:29:56,610
We're friends of the
purse snatcher catcher.

845
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,170
Here for the ceremony?

846
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:00,510
Ceremony?

847
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:03,440
What ceremony?

848
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:07,850
Hey, you guys
Suzuki's friends?

849
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,210
"Good bye"

850
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:45,220
Surprise!

851
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,470
In here.

852
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:54,590
Hey man!

853
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:57,600
Been lookin' for you, man.

854
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:03,160
Didn't recognize you.

855
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:30,800
The money?

856
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:43,480
He... took all the
money and split.

857
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:44,610
Liar.

858
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,520
Open it.

859
01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:53,990
I don't know how.

860
01:31:54,190 --> 01:31:55,290
Don't fuck with me!

861
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:04,790
Fine. I'll just wait
for him to come back.

862
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:14,310
Answer it.

863
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:18,220
And no funny business.

864
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:37,060
Talk.

865
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:41,770
Yes, hello.

866
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:46,000
Police, ma'am.
We're in the lobby.

867
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:50,270
Oh. I'll be right down.

868
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,340
We'll wait here.

869
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:53,690
Oh, yes.

870
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:00,720
What's going on?

871
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:06,760
Last night I caught a thief.
I'm being commended.

872
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:10,560
What the hell... are you serious?

873
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:19,980
I'll be waiting here.

874
01:33:27,090 --> 01:33:30,060
So we finally meet, Suzuki.

875
01:33:30,690 --> 01:33:32,560
We'd almost given up.

876
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:34,330
So,

877
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:38,160
where's the money?

878
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:39,660
Don't know.

879
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:41,690
The girl's got it, right?

880
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:45,030
She nabbed a purse snatcher.
It was on TV.

881
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,210
What?

882
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,840
Cut it out!

883
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,770
What have we here?

884
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,610
- Give it back!
- An engagement ring.

885
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:56,910
Give it back!

886
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:27,240
Wait! She's here.

887
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:29,210
You keep watch.

888
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:46,420
Please have a seat.

889
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,750
We've got your guy...

890
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:07,180
We'll swap the guy for the money.

891
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:14,050
After your purse was
snatched, you chased and...

892
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:16,920
caught the suspect.

893
01:35:18,870 --> 01:35:22,960
We hereby commend you and
express our gratitude.

894
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:35,110
Sleepin' on the job, you jerk!

895
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:46,020
What's the combination?
I'll help you.

896
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:49,620
Untie me first.

897
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:52,360
You got that wrong.

898
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,970
I saw the girl at the hotel.
I know the score.

899
01:36:06,410 --> 01:36:08,850
0774436.

900
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:14,150
That better be right.

901
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:39,510
The pinhead can't
even keep watch.

902
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:49,850
Say, I'll give you
the money if you help me.

903
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:51,690
Help you?

904
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:53,690
That guy's here.

905
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:54,790
That guy...

906
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:57,860
who was hospitalized
after the explosion.

907
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,690
- Kuroiwa...
- Oh my God!

908
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:06,270
You can have all the money
if you help me.

909
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:08,840
Who needs a seat belt.

910
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:11,300
Shut up, man.

911
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:13,210
My foot hurts!

912
01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:18,610
Turn the AC up.

913
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,590
Hey, move over.

914
01:38:26,590 --> 01:38:27,550
Hey!

915
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:38,860
What the fuck!

916
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:41,220
You asshole!

917
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,530
I don't see Kuroiwa!

918
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:54,470
How do you open this?

919
01:38:55,210 --> 01:38:58,480
You punch in the numbers,
but it won't work.

920
01:38:58,750 --> 01:39:00,810
Just bring the damn thing.

921
01:39:01,090 --> 01:39:02,250
The whole safe?

922
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:06,050
No way, man.

923
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:07,660
There's enough of us.

924
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:10,850
We'll torch it open later.

925
01:39:17,170 --> 01:39:18,140
You come too.

926
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:20,930
Why? You have the money.

927
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,060
Let's move it,

928
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:24,330
Suzuki might come
back for the money.

929
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:26,340
Out the back.

930
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:43,190
Look, the minivan.

931
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,280
You promised. Open the safe.

932
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:15,120
What's going on!

933
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:19,120
I don't care about the money.

934
01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:21,860
The number, goddammit!

935
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,960
Go on. Open it.

936
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:31,400
You knew after all.

937
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:39,800
Go for it!

938
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:51,750
Those guys...

939
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,220
The money was the problem.

940
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:57,560
I wish it had burned
in the explosion.

941
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,820
No, no, you're wrong.

942
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:27,080
You OK?

943
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:29,780
I am not OK.

944
01:45:33,450 --> 01:45:36,280
Your visit's been
quite a disaster.

945
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:38,880
We'll be going now.

946
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:43,210
Let us know if we can
be of further assistance.

947
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:44,410
Excuse us.

948
01:45:57,670 --> 01:46:00,470
It was kind of... like a dream.

949
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:12,950
I don't know how
to tell you this.

950
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:15,510
What?

951
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:20,250
Come with me.

952
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:46,510
Sorry.

953
01:46:59,930 --> 01:47:02,700
"We Need Help"

954
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:02,890
Where to?

955
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:04,730
Anywhere at all.
