00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,400
Pure spring water
brought right to your door.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,900
The taste you remember from childhood.

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,900
§ Indian Spring water

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,100
Call yourlocal Indian Spring man.
He's in the Yellow Pages.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,300
It's only a few pennies a day.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,100
Enjoy the winter clearance sale at
Howlands. All prices drastically slashed.

00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:38,800
50 per cent off on ladies' coats,

00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,300
Come on and see at 53 Market Street
at the sign of the winking owl.

10

WBROL Charlestown.

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,000
Channel 8's 11 o'clock movie,
Richard Anthony in High Risk Devils.

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,300
Don't miss it.
And now back to Jim Carr's Sports Talk.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,965
Hi. Jim Carr again.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,400
Denis, I know that some in our audience
don't know the finer points of hockey.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,300
Could you tell them,
for example, what is icing?

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,500
Well, icing happen when
the puck come down, bang, you know,

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,500
before the other guys,
nobody there, you know.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,900
My arm go comes out,
then the game stop then start up.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,300
I see. What is high-sticking?

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,900
High-sticking happen when the guy take
the stick, you know, and he go like that.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,900
You don't do that. Oh, no. Never, never.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,300
- Why not?
- Against the rules.

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,400
You stupid when you do that,
some English pig with no brains...

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,000
Denis, what is slashing?

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,100
Slashing is like that, you know?

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Mm-hm. And there's a penalty for that?

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,100
- Yeah. And for trip also, you know.
- Oh?

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,500
Like that. And for hook like this.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,450
- And for spear, you know, like that.
- Mm-hm.

30
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:56,300
All bad. You do that,
you go to the box, you know.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,800
Two minutes by yourself,
and you feel shame, you know.

32
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,100
- Mm-hm.
- And then you get free.

33
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,300
The Chiefs are at home against
Hyannisport at the War Memorial at eight.

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Good seats are still available.

35
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,400
- A look at sports.
- I think that went very well.

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,600
At defence, for the Chiefs,
number five, Billy Charlebois.

37
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,100
At centre tonight for the Chiefs, number
seven, player-coach Reggie Dunlop.

38
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,300
Dunlop, you stink!

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,600
At left wing, number ten, Ned Braden.

40
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,065
I hate you, Braden!

41
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,300
Playing right wing,
number 14, Jean-Guy Drouin!

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,900
Frog pussy!

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,600
Gentlemen, ournational anthem.

44
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,200
Hey, Denis.

45
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,100
- How's it going, Nick?
- I'm drunk.

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,465
- Nah!
- I'm not bullshittin' ya.

47
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,465
Got stinkin' shitfaced on the bus.
Louise left me,

48
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,300
and that son of a bitch over there keeps
playin' me when he knows I'm shitfaced.

49
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,600
Jeez, I'm really sorry.

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,400
Anybody throws me against the boards,
I'm gonna piss all over myself.

51
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,000
Take it down the other end, Ned!

52
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,300
I thought I'd get Jerry one of those
"Great ldeas of the World" sets.

53
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,900
You can look up the ideas alphabetically,
like arts, mechanics, philosophy.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,700
Yeah. Johnny always says you can
just screw so much and drink so much.

55
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,500
We got Charlestown trailing here three to
nothing, with 10.48 left in the first period.

56
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,550
Whoops! Correction, folks.
That's two to nothing.

57
00:04:58,585 --> 00:05:01,500
We don't wanna make it
any tougher for the Chiefs.

58
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,100
That's what you're paid for, Braden.
Now try winning a game for a change!

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,400
Number ten, Ned Braden,
with his 18th goal ofthe year,

60
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,300
assisted by numberseven, Dunlop,
and number 14, Drouin.

61
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,700
Ned Braden is now the leading scorer
in the Federal League. Time ofthe goal...

62
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,865
Tie it up out there, guys!

63
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,800
Come on, defence!
Get the puck outta there!

64
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Hit him, Billy, hit him.

65
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,600
With us in the press box is
injured Chiefs defenceman, Dave Carlson.

66
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,000
Dave, is it tough sitting here
watching your team lose like this?

67
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,600
- Definitely, Jim.
- You injured your knee in a game.

68
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,400
- No.
- No? I thought you had.

69
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,600
No, I have a cold. You know,
the runny nose and the sore throat.

70
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,900
I went out in that storm
there last week to start my car.

71
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,300
I didn't have my jacket on.
I think it's settled in my kidneys.

72
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,500
We got action in the Presidents' goal.

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,200
Hit him with your purse, ya pussy.

74
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,665
Jesus, look at Brophy. He's plastered.

75
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,900
He told me so. If anybody boards him,
he's gonna piss all over himself.

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,900
- Piss all over himself? Good one.
- Faire pipi, eh?

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
No, no. I OK.

78
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,800
..these games, and I'll check my memory
against the statistics as soon as I can.

79
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,900
Joe McGrath.

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,400
Oh, yes, miss.

81
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,300
Get off the ice, Nick.
You're gonna kill yourself.

82
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,200
They're out on the ice right now,
giving their all.

83
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,100
- Get it together!
- They will be ready.

84
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,400
Ensemble number 32,
entitled "Omar Sharif',

85
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
modelled by Chiefs defenceman,
Billy Charlebois,

86
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,000
who hails from, if I can read the card here,
Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

87
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,200
- The padded shoulders give it a '40s look.
- You look nice, son. Real spiffy.

88
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,600
Keep in mind that the perfect accessory
for the man in your life

89
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,600
is a season ticket to the Chiefs' games.

90
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,400
- I look like some cocksuckin' faggot.
- Have you seen Reg or Braden?

91
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Joe, I don't care. Enough is enough.

92
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,900
Nowhere in my contract does it say I gotta
make a fool outta myself. Am I right?

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
- Have you seen Dunlop or Braden?
- I'm gonna flash 'em, Joe.

94
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,700
I'm gonna open this faggot robe
and wiggle my dick.

95
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,400
- You will not.
- Yes I am, Joe, and you know why?

96
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,100
I want you to have a heart attack and die
so we never have to do this again.

97
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,800
- Fuckin' fashion show.
- It's good publicity.

98
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,200
You fellas have not been drawin' 'em in
the way you have in the past.

99
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,700
I'm gonna wiggle it at 'em,
you cheap bastard.

100
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,900
Be prepared, because when I yank it out,

101
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,200
everybody in that audience except
my wife is gonna be runnin' for the exits.

102
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,100
Ensemble number eight,
as we watch Chiefs defenceman,

103
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,500
Johnny Upton, modelling number eight.

104
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,100
Joe McGrath. Just checking on Dunlop...

105
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,100
We have two generations
of pro hockey with us

106
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,400
for you folks to call in and question.

107
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,700
Player-coach Reg Dunlop,
and right wing Ned Braden.

108
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,000
Reggie, you represent the old guard, one
of the iron men of the Federal League.

109
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,200
You've been playing pro hockey
now for how many years?

110
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:12,700
- Quite a few, Jim.
- Is that right?

111
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,700
On the other side of the scale, Ned,

112
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,800
who's a college graduate
and an American citizen.

113
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,200
- At Princeton you were all-Eastern?
- That's what it said in the yearbook.

114
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,800
OK. Our lines are open.

115
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,400
Anything you wanna know about
the fascinating world of pro hockey...

116
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,200
Here we go. Hi there.
Jim Carr. What's your question?

117
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,000
Hey, Dunlop, you old fart. Why don't
you get outta the game and let some...

118
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,300
We're gonna spin some music
while we wait for our next caller.

119
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,000
Before you do that, I know a lot
of kids would enjoy coming to the games

120
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,200
to see a great veteran like Reggie skate.

121
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,100
While we wait for our next caller,
we'd like to remind you folks calling in

122
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,300
to keep your questions
within the boundaries of good taste.

123
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,600
What kind of broad is it that
calls up and says something like that?

124
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,900
- They're supposed to be our fans.
- Who cares? It's over.

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,200
Idiot McGrath and his shitty PR schemes.

126
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,500
I hate that cheap little bastard.

127
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,400
What are these poor fuckers gonna do
when they close the mill?

128
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,400
They ain't closing it,
just jacking the guys around

129
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,900
so they'll feel happy they got jobs.

130
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,900
- It's the old tactic, the mindfuck.
- Announced it today.

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,100
April 1, they shut it tight.

132
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

133
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,600
- That's a big surprise.
- 10,000 mill workers placed on waivers.

134
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,700
What the hell
are they gonna do with them?

135
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,500
I don't know.
Every sucker for himself, I guess.

136
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,100
- Hey, who's she?
- Um... it slipped my mind.

137
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,600
Oh, yeah? Maybe your wife'll remember.

138
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're the best girl in the whole world.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

139
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,800
Ruby. How's my Ruby?
How's my girl, huh?

140
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,200
You're a sweetheart.
I missed you. Yes, you're a sweetheart.

141
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,700
Are you my girl?

142
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,800
- Beginning to like it here, huh?
- No. I hate it here.

143
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,300
I'm cracking up, you know what I mean?

144
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,600
- You don't look bad.
- Can't figure it out. I'm slippin' fast.

145
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,500
- I think you look fine.
- Slow down. You're making her nervous.

146
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,000
Jerry, I'd like to cancel the order.

147
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,100
- And there's another little matter...
- Hello?

148
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,400
- Hey, Joe.
- Would you hold it a minute?

149
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
What happens to us
when the mill closes?

150
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,500
Don't worry about it. Here, the new
boys are coming in on the 4.15 bus.

151
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,100
I wanna know what happens... Who are
these guys? I never even heard of 'em.

152
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:45,600
- Son, just take 'em to the hotel.
- I've done enough shitwork for today.

153
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:48,300
- The fuckin' fans call in with dirty talk.
- Reg.

154
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,900
- Nothing in my contract says...
- Reg! Do you see this quarter?

155
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,900
It used to be a nickel.

156
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,300
Now, the golden years are behind you.

157
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,700
One season, you'll be hanging up
the blades and retiring the axe.

158
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,365
Fuck it.

159
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Then you'll remember it was Joe McGrath
who trained you for the front office.

160
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,100
I'm sorry, Jerry.
Like I say, I'd like to cancel the order.

161
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,200
In fact, I've got
some equipment I'd like to sell.

162
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,000
The skate sharpener,
the massage table, the Jacuzzi, our bus...

163
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,300
Transways Express Flyernumber 83,
forPittsburgh, Cleveland...

164
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,600
..ready forboarding at gate two.

165
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,000
Please have your tickets available.

166
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,300
Hey! Hey!

167
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,400
- You the Hansons?
- Fuckin' machine took my quarter.

168
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,700
Who are you?

169
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Reggie Dunlop, the coach.

170
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,500
- Grab your gear and let's get goin'.
- OK. Come on, Steve, let's go.

171
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,300
- It took my quarter.
- Think they show Speed Racer here?

172
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,200
Hey, guys! Wait up.

173
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Look what I got!

174
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,500
- You guys triplets?
- No, I'm in the middle.

175
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,100
Steve's 20 and Jeffs 18.

176
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,000
- Where are you from?
- Iron League.

177
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,600
- The lron League, huh? A lot of fights?
- Nah.

178
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
Hey, I want a soda!

179
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
We paid for a week,
then you gotta find a room of your own.

180
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,400
OK, Coach. Gimme a grape or an orange,
and none of that stinkin' root beer!

181
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,000
We go on the road tomorrow mor...

182
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,300
We're on the road in the morning.

183
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,400
- Bus leaves the War Memorial at 8am.
- I gave you a quarter at the bus station.

184
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,000
Give me another dime.
I'm savin' a dime to call Mom.

185
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Jesus Christ.

186
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,300
You cheap son of a bitch.
Are you crazy? Those guys are retards!

187
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,800
I got a good deal on those boys. The
scout said they showed a lot of promise.

188
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,665
They brought their fuckin' toys with 'em!

189
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,800
I'd rather have 'em play with
their toys than with themselves.

190
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,165
They're too dumb
to play with themselves.

191
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Every piece of garbage on the market,
you gotta buy it!

192
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,300
Reg. Reg, that reminds me.

193
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,100
I was coachin' in Omaha in 1948

194
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,100
and Eddie Shore sends me this guy
that's a terrible masturbator.

195
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,400
Couldn't control himself.
He would get deliberate penalties

196
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,200
so he could get into
the penalty box all by himself,

197
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,800
and damned if he wouldn't, you know...

198
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,000
- Oh, Joe. Jesus.
- What was his name?

199
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,100
"To see the three Chiefs
make a scoring rush,

200
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,600
the bright colours of their jerseys...
flashing against the milky ice,

201
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,800
was to see a work of art in motion."
That's good writin', Dickie.

202
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,300
- I tried to capture the spirit of it.
- You did.

203
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,200
- Want a beer to go along with that?
- It's ridiculous for us to be here.

204
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,700
We stick out like a couple of sore thumbs.

205
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,000
- I'm doin' what I like right here.
- It's making you crazy too.

206
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,400
- You're turning into a zombie.
- I don't wanna have a stinkin' fight again.

207
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:37,400
"Rookie goalie Denis Lemieux, continuing
his brilliant first season with the Chiefs..."

208
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Il parle de la game d'hier, ecoute ca.

209
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,700
OK. "Denis Lemieux
continue sa saison..."

210
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
My father'd give you a job. Yours would.

211
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,600
I'm all for that.
Always good to have choices.

212
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,900
I just wanna get out
of this goddamn dump.

213
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,900
You take the van. I'll keep the dog.

214
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,900
Hey, Lily. Come on...

215
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,100
- What's the matter with her?
- You're bullshit. You're really bullshit.

216
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,400
- You're drunk.
- Yeah, he's bullshit.

217
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah? He and I
are the only decent items in here.

218
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,000
That's great. Why should she give a shit
what people think? She's just scrappin'.

219
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,800
My heart goes out to her.

220
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,700
You guys gotta stop losin'.
Get the power play together.

221
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,300
Yeah, we're working on it.

222
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,700
- Is he nice to her?
- Yeah! He love her.

223
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
He tell me. "I love her."

224
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,300
Maybe Braden's a faggot.
Did you think of that?

225
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,900
You crazy?
He has a big cock! Like a horse!

226
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,065
§ Love is good, love can be strong

227
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,700
§ We gotta get right back
to where we started from

228
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,700
§ All right, it's comin' on,
we gotta get right back

229
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,300
Think that lady
in the red dress'll go home with me?

230
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,600
- No. She's not your type.
- How much?

231
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,600
Five dollars
she don't even look at your face.

232
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,800
§ You got a cute way oftalkin'

233

§ You got the better ofme

234
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,000
- God, Francine, you look terrific.
- You're right.

235
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,900
You've been had. That's his wife.

236
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,000
§ I'm in a spin, you know

237
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,100
So, how's your money holdin' out?

238
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,100
There's a beer
in the fridge if you want one.

239
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,700
- Is that a new dress?
- Sort of.

240
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:49,765
Looks good. Kinda tight.

241
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,300
I think I'm gaining a little weight.

242
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
- I don't know. Maybe it's better tight.
- Maybe.

243
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,600
Is that the first time you wore that dress?

244
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Been goin' out? Gettin' around?

245
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You been seein' somebody in that dress?

246
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,300
Makin' out?

247
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,900
- That's none of your business any more.
- Jesus, Francine.

248
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,800
I think about you all the time.
Nothing is ever over.

249
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,700
If I wasn't so goddamn busy,
I mean, I'd see more of you.

250
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,000
I was gonna come down the other night
and ask you to the Aces,

251
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,500
but, I don't know, something came up.

252
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,200
What? You need dough?

253
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,800
- Save your money. You're gonna need it.
- Who, me?

254
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:46,300
When they close the mill,
the Chiefs'll fold.

255
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,200
- That's bullshit.
- These people are gonna be broke.

256
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,100
They're not gonna be going to hockey
games. You're not getting any younger.

257
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:57,100
- I got nothing to worry about. I coach.
- You're no good at it.

258
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Every player on that team
thinks I'm the greatest.

259
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,100
- What?
- You're a losing coach.

260
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You can't make 'em win.

261
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,900
I was thinking about you the other day,
tryin' to imagine you

262
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,200
when you're through with hockey,
and I couldn't.

263
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,300
There was nobody there.

264
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,000
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna come back to you.

265
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,500
Too little, too late.

266
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,500
Hey! Charlie!

267
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,300
Ned! Ned!

268
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,600
I underlined the fuck scenes for ya.

269
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,600
Get back in the van.
You're gonna catch pneumonia.

270
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,500
Go back to the van, cos you're gorgeous
and you're gonna catch pneumonia.

271
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Go get her, Billy.

272
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,500
- Back in the ol' iron lung.
- She underlines the fuck scenes for ya?

273
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,400
Jeez, she must worship
the ground you walk on.

274
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,000
They teach you
how to underline in college.

275
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,700
Not the fuck scenes, they don't.

276
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,600
Braden, you gotta learn to put out more,
you know what I mean?

277
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,600
Holy Mother of God. Ned.
Ned, are you seein' what I'm seein'?

278
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,100
Hey, Billy.

279
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,400
Jesus!

280
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,800
It's finally happened.

281
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,100
- Hi, guys. How you doin'?
- Hello.

282
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,100
- Hey, fellas.
- They're fuckin' horrible-lookin'.

283
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,500
Don't look at me. It's McGrath's doing.

284
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,300
What did he trade for these assholes?
A used puck bag?

285
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,700
I think it's a fuckin' disgrace.

286
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,700
- Watch Braden. He's gonna do somethin'.
- Hi.

287
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,500
- Are you guys brothers?
- Are you guys brothers!

288
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,100
- What a life.
- OK, bets on the trip, men.

289
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,300
Walt has entrusted me with
our ETA in Lancaster, $5 limit.

290
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,300
OK. I'm ready to take estimates
from the membership.

291
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,800
Walt is the leading contender

292
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,900
for the outdoor record,
Charlestown-Lancaster.

293
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,100
All aboard, son. Let's go, Walt.

294
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,600
Where are the new boys?

295
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,800
Oh, son. There are your brothers.

296
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,200
- Why is the fuckin' old man on this trip?
- I don't know.

297
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm expecting great things from you.

298
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,000
Walt, you didn't tell me you were
holding out on your old bookmaker.

299
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,600
§ Ooh, and it's all right,
and it's comin' on

300
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,300
§ We gotta get right back
to where we started from

301
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,200
§ Love is good...

302
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,100
- Who opened?
- On the stick. Let's go, Denis.

303
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Two dollars.

304
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,800
Two bucks. I'll call.

305
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,900
- Fold.
- Let's see.

306
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Two and sixes.

307
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,600
- Hey, that's nice.
- I'm out.

308
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,400
- Kings over.
- Fuck.

309
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,700
- I lose my blouse.
- Shirt. Your shirt.

310
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,200
Shit.

311
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,300
Denis, mon ami, if you sign your contract
over to me, I'll prorate your losses.

312
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,600
Jesus, Braden. You would, wouldn't you?

313
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,300
My ambition is to win all your contracts,
own this club and run it my way.

314
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:48,300
- I'd make a fortune.
- Yeah.

315
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,800
Compulsory fashion shows
every afternoon.

316
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,400
- Radiothons twice a week.
- Recycled jockstraps.

317
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,000
- Who owns the club, anyway?
- I don't know.

318
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,100
You don't know?

319
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,100
What do you mean?
A corporation owns it.

320
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,900
- Who cares? You get your cheques.
- That's the spirit, Reg. That's it.

321
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,800
Hey, pot's light. Come on. Who's in?

322
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,900
What's the game?

323
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,400
Same game. Jacks or better, progressive.

324
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Nothing wild, right?

325
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,700
§ Though it's onlyjust begun

326
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,000
§ You give me yourlove...

327
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,465
-..for two to gorgeous Honolulu!
- Oh, my God!

328
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,900
You'll be staying at the all-new
Leisure lnn in downtown Waikiki...

329
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,800
Hey, Drouin. Change the channel!

330
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:40,500
Changez la canal.

331
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Jean-Guy, leave it. Touche pas.

332
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,900
- Shittiest rink in the fuckin' league.
- That ice is a goddamn disgrace.

333
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,900
You oughta put fuckin' Downy
in these jerseys, Charlie.

334
00:23:49,935 --> 00:23:52,300
Whoa! Hey, guys. Whoa, whoa.

335
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,400
- We're in trouble.
- What? Oh, shit, he's here.

336
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,900
- Who?
- Ogilthorpe.

337
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,200
- Ogie Ogilthorpe?
- You know Ogilthorpe?

338
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:02,100
- Ogil-terp?
- Ogilthorpe.

339
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,300
For the sake of the game,
they oughta throw him in San Quentin.

340
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,300
- He is a criminal element!
- The worst goon in hockey today.

341
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,300
- Oh, yeah. Real cement-head.
- Big Afro. 21, 22. Watch out for him.

342
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,900
He's not playing. He's suspended.

343
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,300
That's Ogie! 15 minutes. Let's go, now.

344
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,900
Big crowd out there tonight.
Let's really try to win this one, eh, boys?

345
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,100
Gotta hand it to the old bastard,
he's original.

346
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,000
That man travelled
15 hours by bus to say that?

347
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Hey.

348
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,100
- What are you guys doin'?
- Puttin' on the foil.

349
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,800
- Every game.
- Yeah, you want some?

350
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,000
No.

351
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,600
Jesus fuckin' Christ.
They don't leave the bench.

352
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,800
Charlie, ska...

353
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,400
Come on, now. The Chiefs are a terrific
organisation. But, well, the mill is closing,

354
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:18,500
and I think next year I'd be
interested in a good front-office job.

355
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,200
Al, that's why I made the trip.
I wanted to talk to you fellas face to face.

356
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,800
Excuse me just a minute, Al. Son.

357
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,000
Push thatpelvis way up there.

358
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,500
Way, way up there.
Raise your tummy up to...

359
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,100
Let's play it smart out there tonight.
I wanna see a lot of work from you guys.

360
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,200
Use your heads on the ice
out there, will ya?

361
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,200
We all know how to play hockey.
Just play it smart.

362
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,400
- Get out there and stick 'em!
- Fuck 'em!

363
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,200
- Let's go!
- Come on!

364
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,800
- Come on!
- Let's go, now.

365
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,900
- We need this win. We've a lot of losses...
- Yeah!

366
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,400
That's what we're here for, guys. To win.

367
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,200
Play heads-up out there. Let's be smart.
We're better than any club if we try.

368
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,600
Come on, Braden. Our line starts.

369
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,200
It's fucking embarrassing.

370
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,800
- Come on, guys. We can get it back!
- What for? We're history.

371
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,000
- What are you talkin' about?
- McGrath's tryin' to get himself a job.

372
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,000
- Fuckin' team's folding.
- I knew there was a reason he came.

373
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,950
- Nobody told me anything.
- He wasn't gonna tell you.

374
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:07,800
The fucker was holdin' on
till he could scrounge a job.

375
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,400
- Jesus Christ.
- Cover his wrinkled old ass.

376
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,450
Fuckin' Chrysler plant, here I come.

377
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:16,400
- The team, fini. Kaput.
- Fini?

378
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,300
This is the last season.
It'll be announced tomorrow.

379
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,265
I'm too old to be traded in.
A one-in-a-million chance.

380
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,500
I'm gonna be calling my brother
tomorrow at the fuckin' Chrysler plant.

381
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,100
Operator? Operator?

382
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,400
Ah! Bernard. Yeah. They close it.

383
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,000
Yeah. Yeah, I want to echanger.

384
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,600
Bernard, call Detroit, tell them bullshit.

385
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,665
Yeah. Yeah, something.

386
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,900
Wait. Ned, what's echanger in English?

387
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,100
Trade me right fucking now.

388
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Trade me right fucking now!

389
00:28:16,235 --> 00:28:18,300
Now hang up.

390
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,200
Hello?

391
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,200
- Wait a minute. Reg!
- Yeah.

392
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,265
Yeah. Hey!

393
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,100
If I had to do it again, I would've gotten
an education. You know what I mean?

394
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,700
Jesus Christ, look at Ned here.
He doesn't have to depend on hockey.

395
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,900
What are you doin' here?

396
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Oh. Where's Hanrahan?

397
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,700
I know a good bar here. The Palm lsle.

398
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Fucked the barmaid last trip.

399
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
I mean, I walked into the place,

400
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,700
she comes up to me without even sayin'
hello and just rubs up against me.

401
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,465
Ah, come on, Mo. Jesus. What?

402
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,400
I mean, she had her jugs
right up against my suit.

403
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:15,300
- Nipples as hard as little rocks.
- Right, Morris.

404
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,200
Yeah. What's the address?

405
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,100
Any of you guys know
the Palm lsle in this town?

406
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,200
Yeah. Don't move.

407
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,700
Before Larry has his one chance
at ourJackpot Bowl,

408
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,100
is there anyone you would
like to say hello to back home?

409
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,300
- Ten bucks he says the guys at work.
- Ten bucks, wife and kids.

410
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,000
- I'm with Braden.
-..the camera and say hello to anybody.

411
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,700
I'd like to say hi
to all the guys down at work.

412
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,500
- All right!
- Ha!

413
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,800
Put my fucking car
back on the track, will ya?

414
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,100
One more lap.

415
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,400
- Hi, Coach.
- Hi, Coach.

416
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,600
How are ya?

417
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,300
- Two-nothing. Two-nothing.
- Come on.

418
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,700
- Brought your cars, huh?
- We're on the road.

419
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,900
- We're all set to go.
- Tell us when.

420
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,200
Oh. I'm shufflin' lines around, guys. I'll let
you know when I get it straightened out.

421
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,200
- OK, Coach.
- See you later, Coach.

422
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,800
Five-nothing. Five-nothing.

423
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,000
- I'm beating you guys.
- The thing's not workin'. I quit.

424
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:26,600
I don't wanna play no more.
You broke the darn car.

425
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,800
- How am I supposed to play?
- You big baby.

426
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,000
You are the first man
I've slept with since I left Hanrahan.

427
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,900
Oh, Suzanne. A beautiful woman like you?

428
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,200
I've been sleeping with women.

429
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,400
Are you shocked?

430
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,000
No.

431
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Did you ever wanna sleep with a man?

432
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,500
- No.
- Never?

433
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,100
No.

434
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,400
I don't blame you, though, Suzanne.
You see, women's bodies are beautiful.

435
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,100
But men's bodies, I see 'em everywhere.
Locker rooms, cocks all over the place...

436
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,600
- Do you wanna know how it happened?
- No, that's OK.

437
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,100
No, that's all right.
Cos I have to tell it in court anyway.

438
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,000
See, every time
Hanrahan went out on the road,

439
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,365
I would go over to this wife's house,
and we would get drunk,

440
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,000
and we would talk about how depressed
and lonely we were without the guys.

441
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,700
Every week, blah, blah, blah.

442
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,000
Then, one night, we were talking
about how we hated the life,

443
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,600
and how we had never done
much of anything ourselves.

444
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,000
And I don't know why, really...

445
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,800
We were like kids.
We started playing with one another.

446
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
We were drunk, as usual.

447
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,900
The next week we did it sober,
and it was terrific.

448
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,600
At the end of the day, I think about
women. I think about women's bodies.

449
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,900
Maybe it'll change, and
I'll wind up sleeping with old goalies.

450
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Things being what they are, who knows?

451
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,650
When Hanrahan found out about it,
he went crazy.

452
00:32:26,685 --> 00:32:30,200
He said if I was a dyke,
that made him a queer.

453
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,400
He started slapping me around.
I ended up in the hospital.

454
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,000
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah. I'm on the lam. I'm hiding out.

455
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
We play him next week, you know.

456
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,600
Oh, God. I'm so sick of those games.
They seem so childish.

457
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,500
The Chiefs are folding.

458
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,800
The mill's closing,
and the economy and stuff.

459
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,000
I just found out about it tonight.

460
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

461
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,500
Christ.
A handsome man like you, Reggie?

462
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:10,500
It ain't easy. I don't see myself
in one of those bullshit nine-to-five jobs.

463
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,600
- Well, you could get traded.
- Suzanne, I ain't a rookie any more.

464
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,100
So far as the coaching goes,
you know, the Chiefs are...

465
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,200
Hey. Use your imagination.
It's what I've been doing.

466
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,200
Oh, look at me! Here I am,
a no-good runaway hockey wife.

467
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
A dyke.

468
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,700
Turn it off! I hate it! I hate it, I hate it!

469
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,000
- I don't wanna watch it!
- Don't touch that television!

470
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,465
Sorry about the Chiefs, Reg.

471
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,100
I'm doing a tribute to the team on Sunday.
"Chiefs Fold: A Sad Commentary."

472
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,600
- Something along those lines.
- Dickie.

473
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,300
Something's afloat. This is on the QT,
but I think they're gonna sell us.

474
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:10,900
I can't name names, but let's just say

475
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,900
that there's a senior citizen's community
in a southern state

476
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,300
that's in the market for a hockey team.

477
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,100
- The Chiefs?
- Actually, it's Florida.

478
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,600
See, they're gettin' a bunch of old geezers
down there from the northeast.

479
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,000
And what do you think
those old geezers really miss in Florida?

480
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,100
I think there are
a lot of shysters in Florida.

481
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,500
Hockey. Their own team.
A Saturday-night game.

482
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,700
Those poor old people down there,
they gotta have something to root for.

483
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,765
You're a pussy.

484
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,100
Daddy, he called me a pussy
and then he changed the station.

485
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,300
Don't bother your daddy now.
Work it out amongst yourselves.

486
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,565
Baby, baby, baby!

487
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:57,100
Now, let me get this straight. A retirement
community has bought the Chiefs?

488
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,000
- Oh, no. I said negotiating.
- Well, that's not much to go on, Reggie!

489
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,100
Dickie, Dickie,
they've already built the rink!

490
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,600
They've dumped a lot of capital into this.

491
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,300
What they're really lookin' for
is a cheap deal on a team.

492
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,900
And since we ain't exactly
the Boston Bruins...

493
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:20,200
How could anybody in his right mind
buy a fifth-place team?

494
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,700
That situation is gonna be changed,
I guarantee you.

495
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,200
Watch your wing!

496
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,600
Hey, Hanrahan!

497
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:30,700
Hanrahan!

498
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,900
Cover the point, goddamnit!

499
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Come on, Mo! Give it to him.

500
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,400
It's along the boards! Nail him, nail him!

501
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,200
Hanrahan! Suzanne sucks pussy!

502
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,000
Get him outta there!

503
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,400
Watch it behind the net!

504
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,300
Hey, Hanrahan! She's a dyke!
I know! I know!

505
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,600
Come on! Pick it up, take it out!

506
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,300
She's a lesbian! A lesbian!

507
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,900
- A lesbian!
- Son of a bitch!

508
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,065
You're nuts, Hanrahan!

509
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,300
He wouldn't dare
pull anything like that on Johnny.

510
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,800
That's it. That's all.

511
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,000
- Hold it. That's all.
- What the fuck you talkin' about?

512
00:37:20,035 --> 00:37:22,300
- You're out.
- Son of a bitch!

513
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,700
Jesus Christ!

514
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,500
Good job, guys. That's the way.
Two points, that's it.

515
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,400
My allergy to those fucking fans,
you know, has returned.

516
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,400
That ends the longest losing streak ever.

517
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,400
- What did he say to Hanrahan?
- Two points, eh?

518
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,500
Hey, Reg! Reg! What did you say to him?

519
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,900
- I told him his wife was a dyke.
- No!

520
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,300
- Yeah!
- Fuck!

521
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,900
Jesus Christ. No wonder he flipped his lid.

522
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,800
Anybody called my old lady a dyke,
I'd go fuckin' bananas.

523
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:17,300
His wife is a dyke.

524
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,900
- Jesus Christ. Poor fuckin' guy.
- Does that make him a fag?

525
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,000
Fuck him. Hanrahan's an ape. I knew
it would piss the shit out of him.

526
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,300
She's a fantastic gal. I mean, fantastic!

527
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,600
I knew it'd drive him berserk.

528
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,500
You nailed him, Coach,
in the fucking head.

529
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,700
- Right in his mind.
- He deserved it!

530
00:38:35,735 --> 00:38:37,600
Yeah! Yeah!

531
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,800
That was wrestling shit. They didn't have
a backup goalie. It was a garbage goal.

532
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,400
No, no. You gotta twist them
and fuck with them.

533
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
It was a garbage win.

534
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,000
Hey! Hey, Lily!

535
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,500
Lil! Where you goin'?

536
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
Hey, Lily!

537
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,200
Hey, Lily.

538
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Hey!

539
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,900
Lil!

540
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,700
Jesus, Lily, there've been three rapes
and two murders in this park in one year.

541
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,350
- I didn't do it.
- We're gonna freeze to death.

542
00:39:43,385 --> 00:39:46,900
If you leave,
you won't have that problem, will ya?

543
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,200
- What's the story on that dog?
- What?

544
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,100
What's the story on that dog?

545
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,800
That's the dog that saved
Charlestown from the 1938 flood.

546
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,900
Well, fuck him.

547
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,600
He's just gonna shock her
with his views on life.

548
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,900
You know, if you were
to come up to my apartment,

549
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,600
I'd fix you a hot drink, rub your back,
and we could find a good game on TV.

550
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,700
Great.

551
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,900
I'd even fix you something to eat,
tell you some stories, and...

552
00:40:40,935 --> 00:40:44,800
Well, by the time pneumonia set in,
you'd be sound asleep.

553
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,400
Well, see you around.

554
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:57,800
You know, he's... he's been so kind to me.
He comes in every day.

555
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,700
He really doesn't wanna rush
yourprogress right now.

556
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,500
I think I'll invite him
out to the summerhouse tonight,

557
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,500
so that we can talk about you more.

558
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,100
I wish I could
put my arms around you.

559
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,200
When you get out
ofthisjacket, you can.

560
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,500
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Coach.

561
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,200
Reg.

562
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,000
I sold your car.

563
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,600
- My 260Z?
- Yes.

564
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,400
But that was my car.

565
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,600
Alex, don't you remember?.

566
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,800
When you had the amnesia,
you gave me power ofattorney.

567
00:41:38,835 --> 00:41:40,500
I'd forgotten.

568
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,700
- That cunt is no good.
- Nice talk.

569
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,000
I've boxed up everything.

570
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,800
She do that to make him crazy
so he don't know what he doing.

571
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,300
Cynthia Pierce is having
an affair with Carl Barton.

572
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,100
- She's lyin' to him.
- Oh, Alex. Alex.

573
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,400
You mustn't be weak.

574
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,100
I don't believe this. I don't friggin'
believe this! Hey, you guys, listen.

575
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,800
"Chiefs Sought
By Florida Retirement Community."

576
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,800
- Oh, come on, Dave.
- No, Johnny, it's right here.

577
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,800
Hey, JG, Jimmy, come over here.
Listen to this.

578
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,600
"Unidentified but reliable sources
have informed the Times Herald

579
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,800
that a St Petersburg, Florida
retirement community is negotiating

580
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,500
with the Charlestown Hockey Corporation
for the purchase of the Chiefs."

581
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,800
It's right there, Reg. Look at that. Yeah!

582
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,200
Dickie Dunn wrote this.
It's gotta be true. Fantastic!

583
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,800
- Florida.
- What sucker would buy the Chiefs?

584
00:42:35,835 --> 00:42:37,300
Jealous there, big guy?

585
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,100
Your mother shoulda bought you skates!

586
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,800
§ Cut off my balls, I'll be skating in Florida

587
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,500
- We're gonna miss you.
- Here's to the sap that'd buy the Chiefs.

588
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,200
Hell, here's to the Sunshine State!

589
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,600
Here's to all that gorgeous snatch in FLA.

590
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,100
Yeah!

591
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,900
- What's wrong, Reg?
- Huh? Oh, nothing.

592
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,300
You got an expression
of sadness on your face.

593
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,800
- I guess this is my last season.
- No, it's not. We're being bought.

594
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,200
At my age, you gotta think about retiring.
I know all the other teams laugh at me.

595
00:43:34,235 --> 00:43:37,900
- That's not true.
- They do. I hear 'em, every game.

596
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,300
They're just saying that to get you upset.
It doesn't mean anything.

597
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,000
Thanks, kid. Maybe you're right.

598
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,100
Drouin, open your fucking eyes!

599
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,500
Tough news, Barclay. Sorry.

600
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,700
What fuckin' news?

601
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,900
Minnesota dropped you. Yeah,
it's in Hockey News. I'll save it for you.

602
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,465
I got a contract!

603
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,800
Come on, let's go, let's go!
Come on! Let's go!

604
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,200
Know what your problem is, Dunlop?
You're too fuckin' old to play this game.

605
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,800
Take that sentence back!

606
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,100
Too much, too soon.

607
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,700
Dave, hold it steady.
You're makin' me miss.

608
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,400
You got him, Dave!

609
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,500
Did you hear what he said?
He shouldn't have said what he said.

610
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,900
You don't say stuff like that on the ice.

611
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,100
- Let's just win the game.
- We are winnin' the friggin' game!

612
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,700
You goon!

613
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,800
You wanna say some more,
you ugly bastard?

614
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,000
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, get him!

615
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,600
We were all there.
We all saw it with our own eyes.

616
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,100
Dave.

617
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,700
Goddamn lardass, Barclay Donaldson.
I'm tellin' you, he jumped us.

618
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,000
Gloves off, stick down, no warning.
He challenged the Chiefs!

619
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,600
- He called us names.
- Called us names!

620
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,300
- But Dave was there.
- Dave's a killer!

621
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,200
- Dave's a killer.
- Dave's a mess.

622
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,100
OK, but Dave's out.

623
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,400
- Who's gonna take his place?
- Is the answer Jesus?

624
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,200
OK, guys. Show us what you got.

625
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,500
God save us.

626
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,400
Kill 'em! Kill the bastards!

627
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,100
I do not believe my friggin' eyes.

628
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,400
These guys are a fucking disgrace.

629
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:45,800
And I'm telling you, Broom County
is just visibly upset by this display.

630
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,500
Get places for the home games.
Bring the kids.

631
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,400
We got entertainment
for the whole family.

632
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,100
There goes Jeff Hanson
into the corner. No, it's Jack.

633
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,900
17. I'll have to check that later.
A crushing check on the boards!

634
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,400
Things are really going on out there now!

635
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,400
Now Steve is in front of the net. I think
that's Steve. Yes. No. Yeah, it is Steve.

636
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,300
And I think that was Jack.
It was Jeff or Jack.

637
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,300
These brothers are stomping all over...

638
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,500
- You! Out!
- What?

639
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,000
- You! Out!
- Huh? What for?

640
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,700
- You! Out!
- No! No!

641
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,200
- Get your eyes examined, you idiot!
- What are you doin'?

642
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,400
- They're all gone!
- It was self-defence, for Christ's sake!

643
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,400
- They're gone!
- How much do you expect a man to take?

644
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,500
- Don't come near me.
- Are you runnin' a goddamn dance?

645
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,500
Open it.

646
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,100
- Joe, who own the Chiefs?
- Owns. Owns.

647
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,600
Owns. Owns.

648
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,700
I don't know.

649
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,700
Thanks.

650
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,600
- OK. What?
- He don't know.

651
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,100
- How'd you ask?
- I say "Who own the Chiefs?"

652
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,000
- What did he say?
- Owns. Owns.

653
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,600
For Christ's sake.

654
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,400
I don't care who own the Chiefs.
I hate it here.

655
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,100
It make me sick. My allergy,
puke every time, bleugh! Like that, puke.

656
00:50:21,135 --> 00:50:24,100
You're a goalie.
You're supposed to be like that.

657
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,300
Somebody own the Chiefs.

658
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,600
We go to Florida and I get the money.

659
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,800
That's nice.

660
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,400
I don't like the way they cover their jugs
all up with the feathers, you know, Reg?

661
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,800
They are so beautiful.

662
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,400
They oughta cut the costumes up higher
on the thigh, so you can see more ass.

663
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,600
You make me sick
when you speak, Morris.

664
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,600
This isn't art. This is sex.

665
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,300
Ooh!

666
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,600
Ogilthorpe fucked her, you know.

667
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,800
It's true. I heard it from a couple of guys.

668
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,700
Ogilthorpe fucked the last girl
on the pinwheel of the lce Stravaganza.

669
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,000
That's her, right there.

670
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,400
Get your butt in gear, for the love of Mike.

671
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,900
- You gals like skatin', huh?
- Sure.

672
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:25,200
I mean, dressed as bluebirds with all them
feathers on, racin' around the ice like that.

673
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:29,300
- You should talk.
- No, well, I just asked out of curiosity.

674
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,800
- I like to see how the other half lives.
- Renee, I like to skate too.

675
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,200
- But the hair is rotten here.
- Hair?

676
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,300
Yeah. The hair.

677
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,900
- Air.
- It make me sick.

678
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
- Your face is a mess.
- I got in a fight. See?

679
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
I don't know. It looks sorta cute.

680
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,500
- Are you a fighter?
- Nah. I'm a lover.

681
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,100
Is your team any good?

682
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,700
No. In fact, we're so bad
that we're disbanding.

683
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,300
What about Florida, eh, Reg?

684
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,500
- Well, we got a win.
- We won three games in a row, Reg.

685
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,500
- Yeah. We're on a roll.
- We're on a roll. We're gonna win.

686
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,000
How's Ogie Ogilthorpe?

687
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,800
- Who?
- Ogie Ogilthorpe. You know old Ogie.

688
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,400
- Ogie.
- You think he's all he's cracked up to be?

689
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,600
Is he a nice guy?

690
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,900
I'll be right back.

691
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:36,200
- You're doing great. You've got 'em...
- Oh, yeah. You betcha.

692
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,700
Hey, Coach!

693
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,800

00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,600

did all this beer come from?

697
00:54:05,435 --> 00:54:07,600
- It's from the owner.
- The owner?

698
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,200
Yeah.

699
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,000
How's his family, Reg?

700
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,400
He told me to say he's glad we're winnin',

701
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,300
cos it'll make it easier
to close that Florida deal.

702
00:54:16,335 --> 00:54:18,500
- You find the guy name?
- Oh, yeah.

703
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,400
- He's neat. Looking to get us bonuses.
- Hey, that's good news, eh?

704
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,700
Yeah.

705
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,100

Listen, I got a favour to ask ya.

717
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,300
Yeah. Remember Francine?

718
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,400
All together in one room. Why not?

719

My ex-wife. Yeah, the pretty one.
Well, has she been in there?

- We're in the Chiefs!
- It's against our policy.

Couple of tickets in it for you. Which bar?

722
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:49,200
Wait a minute. Hold it. No, it's just
everybody's going bananas in here.

what did he look like?

726
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,900
It's their rink, it's their ice
and it's their fuckin' town.

727
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,400
- But tonight we got our fans with us!
- Yeah!

728
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,500
They spent their own dough to get here,
and they came here to see us.

Let's show 'em what we got. Get out
on the ice and let 'em know you're there.

730
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,200
Get that stick in their side,
let 'em know you're there.

Get that lumber in his teeth,

They're about to try
for their fifth consecutive win.

They're applauded by their booster club,

who have travelled all the way
from Charlestown to be here tonight.

742

There's no one to stop it because
there are no officials on the ice.

Yeah!

- Yeah?

768
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,600
- I think I'm gonna change my name.
- Oh, yeah?

769
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,700
Yeah.

770

Yeah.

Nope.

776

Great.

Their bus is coming up the street!
They're coming!

We don't need you here!

789
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,800
There's no room in sports
for people like you.

790

Charlestown Chiefs seem to be

You goons! You can't skate!

We like to see an old-fashioned
brand of hockey played here.

You're a bunch of animals,
you Hanson apes!

- Is this the guy?
- Yeah, that's him!

No, he's over there!

Ladies and gentlemen, look at that.
You can't see that. I'm on radio.

No, no, not him. That's the one!

Think we should get into this?

808
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,200
Just a thought.

809
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:13,200
- It wasn't me!
- No, Jeff, no. It's the other guy.

810
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,300
Think the old folks in Florida
are gonna like these guys?

811
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,300
I don't believe a word of that Florida shit.

812
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,500
The fans are standing up to them. The
security guards are standing up to them.

813
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,400
The peanut vendors
are standing up to them!

814
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,300
If I could get down there,
I'd be standing up to them!

815
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,900
- What hit you?
- An object, right in the face.

816
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,200
- I know. What was it?
- I don't know. Key chain, you know.

817
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,900
- Car keys, house keys.
- Keys to the camper.

818
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,000
- Hi, guys.
- The Hansons.

819
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,900
Guys? Put the fucking bus in gear.
The cops have come for the Hansons.

820
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,800
- The cops?
- How many are out there?

821
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,400
The Hansons.

822
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,900
I throw up my hands. I can't control
'em any more. They gotta be punished.

823
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,000
Will you do me a favour
and put 'em behind bars?

824
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:38,300
They're looking for you guys.
There's gotta be some misunderstanding.

825
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:47,500
Look at his lip. Somebody threw a fucking
tyre chain, hit him right in the mouth.

826
01:04:47,535 --> 01:04:49,900
Scratches, made by human fingernails.

827
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,200
This kid has taken a savage beating.

828
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,800
There's six of them out there for us.

829
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:01,600
They're gonna put you in the same jail
with Ogilthorpe. Come on, you guys.

830
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,900
They let you make one phone call.

831
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,500
They book you, then they give you a dime
and let you make one phone call.

832
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:13,400
- Call the pizza man!
- Why don't you call a massage parlour?

833
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,500
- Hey, guys, we'll see you later.
- Save me a piece of pizza.

834
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:22,300
- Don't eat my watermelon sticks.
- Don't admit to nothing, you guys.

835
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,700
It's me - Reg. They're puttin' the Hansons
away on a trumped-up charge.

836
01:05:28,735 --> 01:05:32,800
Someone threw a monkey wrench.
Yeah, it hit Jeff right in the face.

837
01:05:32,835 --> 01:05:36,900
No, they were defending the honour
of Charlestown at the time.

838
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,600
The boosters are behind us 100 per cent.

839
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,200
Dickie? Have you seen Francine?

840
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:48,700
Sergeant, you will never meet a greater
champion of pure hockey than me.

841
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,800
Sergeant, I knew Eddie Shore!

842
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,200
- You guys back there?
- Hey, Coach!

843
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,500
Peterborough lost tonight,
so as of now we're in the play-offs!

844
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:02,200
Sergeant, I would like to see the bail
just a little more reasonable...

845
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:06,200
- Joe, hurry it up. Let's get outta here.
- Sergeant, when is the trial?

846
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,600
You can't keep them here.
They're folk heroes.

847
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,700
- They're criminals.
- Most folk heroes start as criminals.

848
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,600
Sergeant, you're asking
an exorbitant sum.

849
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:18,300
Joe, I got it right here. How much
are these goons gonna cost us?

850
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,400
- Hey, guys! Braden's bailin' you out!
- $250 each.

851
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:26,200
This young fella is in a hurry because he's
got the prettiest wife you ever saw waitin'.

852
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,900
- But she ain't happy.
- Sam, let 'em out.

853
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,500
I want a receipt.

854
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,500
Hey, hey, hey!

855
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,600
Hey, Coach, look,
we got to keep our bracelets.

856
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,700
Thanks a lot, Sarge.

857
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,900
- Let's get on the bus.
- Look at that.

858
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,400
The boys and I want you
to have this as a little memento.

859
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,700
It's a Chiefs key ring.
You can't buy these in stores.

860
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:16,600
- Aren't those Hansons something?
- Aren't they, though?

861
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:20,300
- They're sorta funny-looking.
- Real funny-looking.

862
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,100
- They're probably real good guys.
- Underneath.

863
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,000
- They couldn't be as dumb as they look.
- Yes, they could.

864
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,200
They're just goons.

865
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,600
Johnny doesn't care for fighting.
He told me so.

866
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,000
That's bullshit.

867
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,800
If we weren't so far below sea level,
the radio reception here'd be much better.

868
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,500
Ooh, I'm getting tipsy!

869
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,100
I've been shitfaced for the past week.

870
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,200
I only drink in the afternoon.

871
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:01,000
Or before a game.
Or when Johnny's away.

872
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,800
Me too.

873
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,000
If I'm not tight, I can't stand it.

874
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,200

- Hey, Johnny.

885
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,700
Hey, Lil?

886
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,900
Lil!

887
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,000
Hiya. Let's go someplace.
You know the Aces?

888
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,600
- Bully!
- Let's start something.

889
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:55,600
- Get the fuck out. I'm going home.
- Oh, yeah?

890
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,700
Where's Braden going?

891
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,900
I got a better idea. Let's die in bed.

892
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,600
- You're nuts.
- Jeez.

893
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,500
You really married a weirdo.
He don't run with the traffic.

894
01:10:13,535 --> 01:10:16,400
- Speakin' of weirdos.
- Me? I'm normal.

895
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,800
Yeah? Well, then, normal is fucked.

896
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,000
How come you talk dirty?

897
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,900
Cos my family has money.

898
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,200
Leave him.

899
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,500
My wife left me. I was drivin' her crazy.

900
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,800
All she could do was
drink and cry, like you.

901
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:44,200
Every time she sees me, it drives me
nuts, cos I know she's askin' herself

902
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,900
"How did I get mixed up
with a bum like him?"

903
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
- Good question.
- Oh, yeah?

904
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,200
Next year you'll ask yourself
the same question about Braden.

905
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,600
He treats you like shit.

906
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,300
He told me you only paid attention to me
to make him crazy, so that he'd fight.

907
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,900
Yeah. That's part of it.

908
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,900
But mainly it's cos I think you're a champ.

909
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,400
Only you gotta stop killin' yourself.

910
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,200
My place. Hm. That's a coincidence.

911
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,500
- Get out!
- Hey.

912
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:34,200
You gotta roll with it, kid. Use your
imagination. That's what I've been doing.

913
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:36,700
I can get you straight.

914
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,800
Beat it.

915
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,400
Well, I'll see you later.

916
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,800
I'm proud of you.
They're talkin' about you in the streets.

917
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:07,700
- Want a White Avenger?.
- No. Gimme a cup of coffee.

918
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:12,600
- That was a nice tribute to the guys.
- I tried to capture the spirit of the thing.

919
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,365
This is Dickie Dunn.
He wrote the article on you.

920
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:19,100
Hi, guys. Nice to meet you. I was tryin'
to capture the spirit of the thing.

921
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,600
Hi, guys.

922
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,200
See the game tonight,
compliments of the Chiefs.

923
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,800
- Gee, thanks, Reggie.
- Hey! Free tickets!

924
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:38,600
- Sure! Spread 'em around, guys!
- Hey, thanks.

925
01:12:38,635 --> 01:12:41,265
Come to the game,
compliments of the Chiefs.

926
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:46,000
- Thanks, Reggie.
- You taught that guy a lesson last night.

927
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,800
- He was sensational.
- I guess that was a big fight?

928
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:52,300
- Are you in pain?
- No. It hurt like hell.

929
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,800
Oh, you poor thing.

930
01:12:54,900 --> 01:13:00,000
Look, I'll make you a double dose of this
stuff, and you won't feel anything.

931
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,400
Good.

932
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,600
What happened to you?

933
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:06,700
He got that in the fight last night.

934
01:13:06,735 --> 01:13:09,500
That is a very deep cut.

935
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:15,200
Will you be at the game? lf I see
you in the stands, it make me feel better.

936
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,100
Hey, Killer! Get 'em tonight!

937
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,900
Fuckin' wearin' me out.

938
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,300
- Reggie.
- Oh, hiya, honey! How are you?

939
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:58,800
- You look a thousand years old.
- It was a long bus ride.

940
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,300
- Did you listen to the game?
- Of course not.

941
01:14:01,335 --> 01:14:03,600
We got a new attitude!
It's bringin' success.

942
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,300
- Well, any fool can fight.
- No, I swear to you.

943
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,400
The Chiefs will be sittin' pretty in Florida
when this town is a stinkin' memory.

944
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,900
You see, I personally
have been talkin' to the owner,

945
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
which is why I've been
too busy to call you.

946
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,700
Every wakin' hour
I'm on the phone with this guy...

947
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,200
Reggie, Reggie. I'm moving.

948
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,500
- What?
- To Long lsland.

949
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,800
A gal who works
in a shop there has a space open.

950
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,300
Business here is just dead.

951
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,500
Are you really goin'?

952
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,800
You know, we have
to get divorced one of these days.

953
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,700
I mean, I could meet somebody,
you could meet somebody, you know?

954
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,200
Yeah?

955
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,600
Well, don't look so sad.

956
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,200
It's gonna be a big one!

957
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,800
- See those guys?
- Reggie, look. I'm late.

958
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,000
I'll write you when I get settled.

959
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,300
Hey. I'll try to call you before you go.

960
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,300
- It sucks!
- No, son. It looks nice and sells hockey.

961
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,200
It ain't mean enough.
Put some blood in there.

962
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,000
Show somebody gettin' hurt.
A groin injury.

963
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:30,300
Put a fuckin' map of Florida
in the background. Get some tits in!

964
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,100
Put a "For Sale" sign on the bottom.

965
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:36,500
I don't want any tits
and I don't want any "For Sale" sign.

966
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,400
Jesus.

967
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,300
Remember that great
Peterborough game in... '68?

968
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,100
Yeah. What about it?

969
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,165
Jacky St Pierre's wife left him.

970
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,900
My God, it was snowing like hell
before we even got to the motel.

971
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
- Yeah.
- Jacky had a whole keg sent in.

972
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:07,700
Poor Jacky. He had a future.
I told him to watch that drunk drivin'.

973
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,000
God, Joe, did we ever get shitfaced!

974
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:15,600
And Jacky told everybody he was gonna
get Jill back even if he had to beg her.

975
01:16:15,635 --> 01:16:19,200
- I told him not to do that.
- Oh, I think he shoulda.

976
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,400
She was a dynamite broad.

977
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,700
- God, did we get shitfaced.
- I liked Jacky.

978
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:29,400
- Yeah. He could've been great.
- Yeah.

979
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:34,400
And remember
I went up to your room afterwards

980
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,100
and you were dressed
in chick's clothes?

981
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:41,300
Yeah, you had on
this black bra with tassels.

982
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:47,100
You were dancing in front of a mirror
with this kinda zebra-skin jockstrap.

983
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,600
Remember how I screamed at you
when you started comin' on to me

984
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:53,700
and I just said "Jesus, stop it, Joe.
I'm ashamed of you."

985
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,700
Damn you.

986
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,400
I wanted to tell you
that I forgot the whole thing.

987
01:16:58,435 --> 01:17:01,400
Years have passed.
Now I'm sexually liberated.

988
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,300
I don't care who's a fag no more.
I mean, who cares?

989
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,300
It's natural. It's all around us.

990
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:11,200
Who's the owner, Joe?

991
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,000
He's probably calling Florida.
See how the sale is going.

992
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,200
I was in Florida once, on a Southern tour,

993
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:24,700
where I met this little redhead
who was an underwater specialist.

994
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:30,800
The first thing she says to me
was "Come on out by the pool."

995
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:36,200
So I went out, and she comes
leaping out with this banner,

996
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:39,500
wearing nothing
but this little see-through wet suit.

997
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:44,600
- Hey, Reg, I want a chair by the pool.
- I want some snatch by the pool.

998
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,700
- Reg, you want a Coke?
- No, I can't.

999
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:51,300
I'm tapin' an interview at the station.
They're playin' it at four. Don't miss it.

1000
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:55,800
That was some road trip. Six straight wins
and a whole new rash of penalty minutes.

1001
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,300
Well, we got a whole new attitude.

1002
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,500
What about the Hanson brothers?
They're not just bullies?

1003
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,700
Just bullies?
They scare the bejesus outta everybody!

1004
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,300
- Deliberately?
- Well...

1005
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,600
I'd like the folks to come down and watch
us cream them punks from Syracuse.

1006
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,000
Anything new on the sale of the Chiefs?

1007
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:21,000
I think the negotiations are...
you know, goin' pretty good.

1008
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:23,200
I have a personal announcement, though.

1009
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:26,800
I am placing a personal bounty
on the head of Tim McCracken.

1010
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:30,500
He's the coach
and chief punk on that Syracuse team.

1011
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,700
- A bounty?
- Yeah.

1012
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:37,700
A hundred bucks of my own money for
the first of my men that nails that creep.

1013
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,800
That's eight o'clock at the War Memorial,

1014
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:44,000
the Syracuse
and the all-new Charlestown Chiefs.

1015
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,800
- Thanks, Reg.
- Not to worry, kid.

1016
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:51,400
I'm placing a personal bounty
on the head ofTim McCracken.

1017
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,600
He's the coach
and chiefpunk on that Syracuse team.

1018
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,800
- A bounty?
- Yeah.

1019
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:00,700
A hundred bucks ofmy own money
for the first ofmy men that...

1020
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
- Yeah?
- Are you nuts?

1021
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,500
- Bullshit!
- A bounty!

1022
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,500
- We could all land in the clinker for this.
- Oh, big deal, Joe.

1023
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,100
You can't put a bounty on a man's head!

1024
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,600
I just did.

1025
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,900
- Yeah?
- Reg? It's Killer.

1026
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,300
- Oh. Hi, Killer.
- I want that $100.

1027
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,900
Well, you gotta earn it, Killer.

1028
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:21,000
- My attitude's right.
- Uh-huh. OK, kid.

1029
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:43,000
In-fucking-credible.

1030
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,200
Who is it?

1031
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,900
Yeah?

1032
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:57,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

1033
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,200
What's up?

1034
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,765
Jesus.

1035
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,900
Come on in.

1036
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,200
- Well, I did it.
- You bet you did. You did, you bet.

1037
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,100
The wedding presents my side gave.
50-50, right?

1038
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,700
Can you get my clothes?

1039
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,900
Sure.

1040
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,100
Jesus, did you write him a note?

1041
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,200
Do you think I should have?

1042
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,600
I don't know.

1043
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,700
He's sure gonna think the worst.

1044
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,100
- Hey, Lily, we're gonna have a ball.
- We are?

1045
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,900
Except right now I gotta take a nap.

1046
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I mean, I put a bounty on this guy's head.
If I don't get some shuteye...

1047
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:49,600
If I don't get some shuteye,
I'll get murdered out there on the ice.

1048
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:54,300
Otherwise I would've given you a night on
the town. We could've gone to the Aces.

1049
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,700
She won't mind. She's great to sleep with.

1050
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,800
Ned sleeps with her before every game.

1051
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,400
Her breathing makes him
feel more secure.

1052
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,700
Listen, Reg,
I'm gonna get a grip on myself.

1053
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,900
I'm gonna start using my imagination,
go with the traffic.

1054
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,600
I've been going about this all wrong.
I probably am terrific.

1055
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,700
You want some spaghetti?

1056
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,700
Reg?

1057
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:35,100
Run the siren.
Run the goddamn siren. I'm payin' for it.

1058
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,500
Let 'em know
there's gonna be blood in there.

1059
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,900
I can circle, but it's gonna cost you more.

1060
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Oh, for Christ's sake.

1061
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,300
There.

1062
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:20,100
Don't ever play "Lady of Spain" again!

1063
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,100
Jesus Christ.

1064
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:40,100
- Hey, McCracken.
- Dunlop, you suck cock.

1065
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,100
All I can get.

1066
01:23:56,100 --> 01:24:00,700
$100 bounty on the head of famed
Syracuse stick man Tim McCracken.

1067
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:05,100
McCracken, also known as Dr Hook for
his scalpel-like prowess with the stick,

1068
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:09,100
has been known to carve a man's eye out
with a flick of the wrist.

1069
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,700
There's a carnival-like atmosphere here.

1070
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:19,000
The crowd is gathered and, well, you can
feel it, there's an air of expectancy...

1071
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:25,300
Syracuse skating out now.
We're looking forward to a real contest.

1072
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,800
We're ready to face off in the
middle circle. The referee is ready.

1073
01:24:28,835 --> 01:24:31,200
The linesmen for tonight...

1074
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,100
Go, Chiefs, go! Go, Chiefs, go!

1075
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:53,000
$100 says you're gonna crack my skull.

1076
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:56,400
- I wouldn't crack your knuckles for $100.
- So he's bluffin'.

1077
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:01,300
Somebody's gonna kill you, you dumb
son of a bitch, but it's not gonna be me.

1078
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,400
Good pass!

1079
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,600
Go on, man! Hit him!

1080
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,900
What's the matter with you?
You're a Chief!

1081
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,600
- Come on.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1082
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,700
Fight back!

1083
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,765
You son of a bitch! Get over here!

1084
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:01,100
- Chickenshit yellow-belly.
- I scored, you fucking has-been.

1085
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:05,500
They don't want you to score goals.
They want blood. They're booin' you.

1086
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:08,100
Go get him, Killer!

1087
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,500
Come on, you son of a bitch. Come on!

1088
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,800
- Come on, Killer!
- We win cos I score goals.

1089
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,400
Oh, kiss my ass.
We win cos I make 'em crazy.

1090
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,500
- Nail him!
- You don't make me crazy.

1091
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,000
I will, cos you're benched.

1092
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:33,400
You want ice time, come and tell me
when you wanna play it my way.

1093
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:37,065
- You're the biggest pussy in the league.
- I like pussy.

1094
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:40,600
Oh, yeah? Well, that's not what
I hear from your wife. I hear...

1095
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,900
Go get him, Killer!

1096
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Real old-fashioned guts,
for Dave "Killer" Carlson

1097
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,000
to jump into that fight
with Tim "Dr Hook" McCracken.

1098
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,400
Ned Braden's come into the booth.
Sit down.

1099
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,900
I noticed
a slight discussion with Reg Dunlop.

1100
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,900
What are you doing? You been benched?

1101
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,800
Yes, a real first in my career.
I've been benched.

1102
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,900
- Why is that?
- I won't fight.

1103
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,000
- Well, you could play if you fought.
- Let's just say I'm chickenshit.

1104
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:39,600
Ned, why would someone with your
background still be playing hockey?

1105
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,100
- I hate my father.
- You do?

1106
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,365
- And I was having problems at home.
- You are?

1107
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:47,100
I just said I was. Primarily
sexual problems. I'm very perverse.

1108
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:50,000
- Holy shit!
- I skate to get away from my wife!

1109
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:53,600
- This is Jim Carr...
- We fight. She wants me to quit hockey.

1110
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:02,100
As you may have noticed, she's the only
good-looking piece of ass in Charlestown!

1111
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,700
She also has a drinking problem,
and I have no idea where she is.

1112
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,800
- Gimme that damn mike!
- Why do you wear that rug?

1113
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,365
It's just sensationally ugly.

1114
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,900
You're going bald.
Can't you face up to that?

1115
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,300
Well, at least I'm not chickenshit like you!

1116
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,400
What you're hearing is the truth!

1117
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,700
Jim Carr got angry...

1118
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,100
Joe McGrath here.
The boys like to horse around.

1119
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,500
- Chickenshit bastard!
- Sod off, old fart!

1120
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,300
- I may be bald, but I'm not chickenshit.
- I wanna talk about violence.

1121
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:35,000
- Chick, chick, chick!
- Gimme that!

1122
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,800
Son! Son!

1123
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,800
§ Take my guitar

1124
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:46,200
§ Forboard and room

1125
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:49,200
Hey, Billy!

1126
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:55,000
Well, you're gonna be set, Lily.
Taking your destiny by the throat.

1127
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:57,300
You're in the driver's seat.

1128
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:01,400
You're not having
second thoughts about this, are you?

1129
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,050
Sometimes I think I get it.
Sometimes I think it's horseshit.

1130
01:29:05,085 --> 01:29:08,600
Well, to doubt is human.
You stick with Reg. I'm on a roll.

1131
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:14,100
- Bye, Francine. Come back and see us.
- I will. Thank you, Mrs Vincent.

1132
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:19,700
You're gonna need
another 10 or 15 minutes.

1133
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,600
- Hiya.
- Hi.

1134
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:29,300
This is Lily Braden, Ned Braden's wife.

1135
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:32,700
Well, actually she's... she's on waivers.

1136
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,100
Listen, she's in the market
for a perm and I said to her

1137
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:39,000
"Hey, there's no one better
than old Francine."

1138
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:42,200
- Well, I don't think...
- For the works. I'm buyin'.

1139
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:45,200
- I'll pay you back tomorrow.
- No, that's not the problem.

1140
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,300
You see, the problem is...

1141
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,500
I never laid a hand on her.
It was just a kid.

1142
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,800
Listen, it's a pathetic story. It's pathetic.

1143
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,800
You look terrific.

1144
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,300
Be careful, girls.

1145
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:10,800
- There's TVRadio Mirror, Modern Screen.
- You were married to him?

1146
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:13,800
For about a hundred years. It's all over.

1147
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,400
He's completely off his rocker.

1148
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:20,100
- I left my husband, too.
- Really?

1149
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,700
I'm only halfway out the revolving door,
know what I mean?

1150
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:28,000
Oh, it's lousy at first. You think
you're dying. But then it's fabulous.

1151
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:30,900
- I mean, you become a new woman.
- Yeah.

1152
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:35,500
You know, Reggie told me
you've gotten terrific since you left him.

1153
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,500
He said that?

1154
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,200
Well, you know what
you have to do for yourself?

1155
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:46,700
You have to get out there and circulate.

1156
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,300
I mean, you just can't sink into it. You
have to get out there on the firing line.

1157
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,600
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1158
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:55,600
Really. It's not bad. Look.

1159
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:02,000
If you did your cheekbones better,
you could look like Cher.

1160
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,100
Huh?

1161
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,500
- Amy, take this in the house.
- Hello there.

1162
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:54,300
Hiya. I'm Reg Dunlop. The Chiefs?
I came to see your husband.

1163
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,500
Oh, yes? I'm Anita McCambridge.
How do you do?

1164
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,700
- Hi.
- You think you can help with these?

1165
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:02,165
- Uh, yeah.
- Mom, I'm late, I gotta go.

1166
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:08,400
Michael, stay in the yard, put your jacket
on and carry one of these in first.

1167
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,500
Where's your husband?

1168
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:13,000
He's in puppy heaven.

1169
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,900
I own the Chiefs.

1170
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:21,900
This way.

1171
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:35,600
- What can I get you to drink?
- Canadian Club and water.

1172
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:40,500
- Nice place you've got here.
- Thanks.

1173
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,200
To tell the truth,
Mrs McCambridge, the reason...

1174
01:32:45,235 --> 01:32:47,300
Anita.

1175
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:52,100
OK, Anita.

1176
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:57,600
Uh... you know, we all read
about the possibility of a sale in Florida,

1177
01:32:57,635 --> 01:33:01,100
and the guys are getting anxious
to find out what's going on.

1178
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:04,000
- Mm-hm.
- I guess I'm their representative.

1179
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:10,900
- We've been doin' real good.
- My accountant is certainly pleased.

1180
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,800
Oh. Uh...

1181
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,900
How is the sale goin'?

1182
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,100
Fine.

1183
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:22,200
- Oh. Good.
- You think you're gonna like Florida?

1184
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,600
Yeah.

1185
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,600
- Oh, you are very clever.
- What?

1186
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,800
It's been so much fun,
waiting to see what you're gonna do next.

1187
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:41,100
The articles in the paper
are very funny, that sports writer?

1188
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:44,200
- Dickie Dunn?
- You've certainly got his number.

1189
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:50,000
The radio interviews are fantastic,
and the Hanson brothers? Oh, my God!

1190
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:52,200
Well, attendance has quadrupled.

1191
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:55,200
Yes. I am in the black
for the first time in four years.

1192
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:00,000
- Hey, that's great.
- I guess I owe that to you. Thank you.

1193
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:02,800
You're welcome.
So, you can sell us real easy, then?

1194
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:06,900
- I could probably get some interest.
- Oh, boy. That's great!

1195
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:09,500
Oh, that's just great, Anita!

1196
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,000
You know, for five months now,
I've been tryin' to prove to you,

1197
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:16,800
without ever really knowing
who you were, that you were wrong,

1198
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:20,300
and that we could get somebody
interested in the Chiefs.

1199
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,500
We could sew that thing up tonight,
you know.

1200
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,900
- We oughta cream those guys!
- That's terrific.

1201
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:32,200
But I couldn't make enough of a profit
to have a sale be worthwhile.

1202
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,800
My accountant tells me I'm better off
folding the team, taking a tax loss.

1203
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
You mean,
you could sell us but you won't?

1204
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,100
I could probably sell you.

1205
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,900
But I can't.

1206
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,400
Oh.

1207
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:57,500
You know...

1208
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,600
We're human beings, you know.

1209
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:06,900
I have to confess that I've never let
the children watch a hockey game.

1210
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,200
I have a theory that children
imitate what they see on a TV screen.

1211
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:14,700
They see violence, they'll become violent.

1212
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:18,200
They see someone stick up a bank,
they'll stick up a bank.

1213
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:20,800
Heroin. You name it.

1214
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:23,800
- You're fucked.
- What?

1215
01:35:23,835 --> 01:35:25,900
You are totally fucked.

1216
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:30,300
You're garbage
for letting us all go down the drain.

1217
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:33,600
- Are you serious?
- You could sell us. We're hot.

1218
01:35:33,635 --> 01:35:36,700
People go nuts for us.
You could find a buyer.

1219
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,500
I don't think you understand finance.

1220
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,000
Your son looks like a fag to me.
You'd better get married again,

1221
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:55,200
cos he'll have somebody's cock
in his mouth before you know it.

1222
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:58,400
How dare you! How dare you!

1223
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:05,100
Our listeners'll be surprised to learn that
you're a soft-spoken young man, Killer.

1224
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,600
Yes, I am.

1225
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:09,300
I was watching some kids
play hockey the other day,

1226
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,800
five- and six-year-olds, little mites.

1227
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:14,000
One kid said "I'm Killer Carlson."

1228
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:17,300
He picked up his little stick,
and he creamed that other kid.

1229
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,200
How do you feel about that, Dave?

1230
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:23,400
Well, Jim, the way I see it is, the kid
probably would've done it anyway.

1231
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,400
Bad upbringing in the home.

1232
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:28,500
- That's very interesting.
- Can I be serious for a minute?

1233
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:30,100
By all means.

1234
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:33,500
I'djust like to say that,
no matterhow the game turns out tonight,

1235
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:37,300
I owe all that I am
to our coach, Reg Dunlop.

1236
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:41,800
He's had the greatest influence on me,
aside ofcourse from the Swami Baha,

1237
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:45,700
whose positive-thinking records
have been a tremendous help.

1238
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,700
- Positive-thinking records?
- Yeah.

1239
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:50,900
You can get 'em
in any religious record store.

1240
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,700
And I know that thousands of people
in Charlestown have lost their jobs,

1241
01:36:54,735 --> 01:36:57,000
you know, with the mill closing and all.

1242
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:00,400
I see 'em walking around the streets
depressed all the time.

1243
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:03,600
Well, I just wanna say to all you
unemployed folks out there,

1244
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:06,400
you can get a new lease on life
with these records.

1245
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,900
Nothing'll botheryou any more.

1246
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:11,900
You can go and clobber
the next guy in yourbusiness life.

1247
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,300
- That's very inspirational, Dave.
- Thanks.

1248
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:18,000
- Take care ofyourself.
- Yeah. We're gonna win tonight...

1249
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:20,600
Jesus Christ. What a fuckin' nightmare.

1250
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:57,300
Braden!

1251
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:03,300
Ned!

1252
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:06,200
Hey!

1253
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,400
Kid?

1254
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,500
Hey, come on back!

1255
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:30,200
You don't have to fight if you don't wanna.
You can do whatever you wanna do.

1256
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:37,300
You know, I've had it with
the show business crap, too.

1257
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:41,600
I don't know what hit me!
I'm drivin' up here, and I say to myself

1258
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:43,700
"Who cares about Florida?"

1259
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:47,100
Screw the sale.
It's probably a bunch of crap anyway.

1260
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:51,000
No, that's bullshit.

1261
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,100
Hey?

1262
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:57,500
The team's history, kid.
There ain't no next year.

1263
01:38:57,700 --> 01:39:01,200
I'm tits-up after this game
no matter what happens.

1264
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:05,500
But I'll tell you one thing.

1265
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:09,500
We're gonna win
that fuckin' championship tonight.

1266
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,900
But we're gonna win it fair and square.

1267
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,900
Old-time hockey,
none of this wrestling shit.

1268
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:19,200
You know? What the hell?
It's my last game.

1269
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:22,100
I'm gonna go out with style!
Play it straight!

1270
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:27,000
I'd like to have you there with me.

1271
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:41,200
Oh, uh... you know,
Lily's been staying at my place.

1272
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:43,300
She's a terrific gal.

1273
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,800
We've been havin' a hell of a time.

1274
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:05,100
Reg! Hey, Reg!

1275
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,600
- What?
- Want me to run in with stretchers?

1276
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:13,700
Get outta here, you goddamn parasite.

1277
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:22,400
This is Jim Carr. Jeff Hanson, I just can't
tell you the pleasure you've given us.

1278
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:25,150
I'd like to ask one question.
Win, lose or draw,

1279
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:27,800
this is the Chiefs'
last game before you leave.

1280
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:32,400
- Anything you want to say to Flood City?
- What do you mean, Flood City?

1281
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:35,100
Never mind, Jeff.
I guess that's before your time.

1282
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,600
Reg Dunlop! How about a statement?

1283
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,000
Good game, fella.
Good luck to you tonight.

1284
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,300
Reg Dunlop
has just asked us to come back...

1285
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:45,100
Girls! Outta here!

1286
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:07,200
No hittin'.

1287
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:21,100
The Chiefs are history, guys.
There ain't no Florida deal.

1288
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,000
Come on, Reg.
What are you talkin' about?

1289
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:29,400
I just made that shit up.
We're deader than this stinkin' town is.

1290
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:31,900
Dead history!

1291
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,400
I conned you guys. I just lied to you.

1292
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:43,900
We were never anything
but a rich broad's tax write-off.

1293
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,200
It made no difference
whether we won or lost.

1294
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,300
- Nail 'em!
- Kill 'em!

1295
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:53,100
You know, we ain't hockey players.
We've been clowns.

1296
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:57,400
We've been goons!
We're the freaks in a fuckin' sideshow.

1297
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:02,200
We're nothing but a bunch of criminals.
We oughta be in jail, that's all there is.

1298
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:06,100
- I'm ashamed.
- Not you, Coach?

1299
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,900
Yeah. Really ashamed of myself.

1300
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,400
See, Ned was right.

1301
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,400
Violence is killin' this sport.
It's draggin' it through the mud.

1302
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:24,500
If things keep up the way they are, hockey
players'll be nothing but actors, punks.

1303
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:28,500
Well, I'm not playin'
my last game that way.

1304
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,900
- Last game?
- Yeah.

1305
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,200
It's my last game,
and I wanna play it straight.

1306
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:37,400
No more "Nail 'em."
No more "Fuck with 'em." That's finished.

1307
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:41,300
I wanna win that championship tonight,
but I wanna win it clean.

1308
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:44,900
Old-time hockey,
like when I got started, you know?

1309
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:51,300
Jeez. Toe Blake, Dit Clapper,
Eddie Shore, those guys were the greats.

1310
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:55,100
I don't know what to say.
Christ, it's up to you.

1311
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:11,000
- Reg is our coach.
- Yeah, sure. Old-time hockey!

1312
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,100
- Like Eddie Shore.
- Yeah.

1313
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:16,100
Coach, our line starts?

1314
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:19,400
- Sure.
- Yeah!

1315
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:22,900
We got a game to win.
Everybody on the ice. Come on, guys.

1316
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,100
Evening, boys.

1317
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:33,500
Wimpy, how are ya?
Crash, how are you? Scotty.

1318
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,900
Better than Philadelphia this time!

1319
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:39,400
You're gonna eyeball
the new Charlestown Chiefs.

1320
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:43,700
Well, ladies and gentlemen, this has
all the earmarks of a hockey classic.

1321
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:48,800
The championship confrontation between
the Syracuse Bulldogs... Here they come!

1322
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:54,000
The rags-to-riches, Cinderella contenders
of the Federal League, the Chiefs!

1323
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:13,800
Let's go, Chiefs!
Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs!

1324
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,500
Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs!
Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs!

1325
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,100
Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs!

1326
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,800
I can't explain this delay.

1327
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:41,600
I don't know why Syracuse
elected to miss the warm-up.

1328
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:44,800
The Chiefs have already
skated over to their bench.

1329
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:49,000
Well, it just might be that Syracuse is
afraid to come out and face the Chiefs.

1330
01:44:49,035 --> 01:44:51,000
Oh, thanks, Bill.

1331
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,000
Good heavens.

1332
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:57,800
I've just been handed the Syracuse roster,

1333
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:02,100
and it appears the Syracuse Bulldog
management is just real thirsty

1334
01:45:02,135 --> 01:45:04,800
for a big, grudge-match type
victory here tonight.

1335
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:08,400
They've brought back,
just for this one contest, some colourful...

1336
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:12,500
Oh, and here they come now,
led by someone we all know very well,

1337
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,700
Tim "Dr Hook" McCracken!

1338
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:20,700
And here's a name from the past.
Ross "Mad Dog" Madison!

1339
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,000
Ross, as you know,
never travels anywhere

1340
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:27,700
without his longtime friend and attorney,
Sam "Small Print" Lyman!

1341
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:33,000
Here's one for nostalgia fans! Clarence
"Screaming Buffalo" Swamptown!

1342
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:36,100
I'll never forget an interview
I did with him years ago,

1343
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:40,100
when Buffalo revealed he liked to call
his hockey stick "The Big Tomahawk".

1344
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:43,600
He usually refers to opposing
players as "The Little Scalps".

1345
01:45:43,635 --> 01:45:46,800
I thought he'd been suspended for ever.

1346
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:49,700
Andre "Poodle" Lussier, defence.

1347
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:53,700
Andre, of course, has been living
in semi-seclusion in Northern Quebec

1348
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:56,900
ever since the unfortunate
Denny Pratt tragedy.

1349
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,500
Not Poodle!

1350
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:02,600
And from Mile Forty, Saskatchewan,
where he now runs a doughnut shop,

1351
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:06,900
number 15, former penalty-minute
record holder of the Federal League

1352
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,800
for the years 1960 to 1968 inclusive,
Gilmore Tuttle!

1353
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:17,200
Oh, gee. Hold the phone.

1354
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:19,600
This is an unscheduled surprise.

1355
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:23,600
It's him.

1356
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:27,400
This young man has had
a very trying rookie season,

1357
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:31,700
what with the litigation, the notoriety,
his subsequent deportation to Canada,

1358
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:34,300
and that country's refusal to accept him.

1359
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:37,100
That's more than
most 21-year-olds could handle.

1360
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:40,000
- Ogil-terp.
- Ogie Ogilthorpe!

1361
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:59,600
Hi, Ogie.

1362
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:03,300
Buy you a soda after the game?

1363
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:07,300
Hi. You know Toe Blake?

1364
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,500
No?

1365
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,900
We'll straighten you out, you little prick.

1366
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:22,000
How.

1367
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:25,800
- They don't call me Dr Hook for nothing.
- How you doin'?

1368
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:30,200
All right, now. No high-sticking.
No tripping. No slashing.

1369
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:32,900
Major surgery. Open-heart.

1370
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,200
- I'm waitin' for quiet.
- Yeah, you'll have quiet.

1371
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:44,800
Give 'em hell!

1372
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,800
Give 'em the old-time hockey!

1373
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:59,700
- Good crowd.
- Shirley!

1374
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,400
- Teamwork! Teamwork! Teamwork!
- Eddie Shore!

1375
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:05,000
Come on! Get up! Get up!

1376
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:09,700
One with the universe.
One with the universe. Nothing matters.

1377
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:14,800
This reporter is stunned! The Charlestown
Chiefs are not fighting back!

1378
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:27,300
Keep the guys off me!

1379
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:34,700
You fuckin' moron!

1380
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
The Chiefs' performance has
to be a bitter disappointment

1381
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:42,400
to these 4,000-odd Charlestown fans
who have packed this War Memorial,

1382
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:46,300
paying good money
to witness this... this fiasco.

1383
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:48,600
Get Ogie!

1384
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:50,900
Move away, Wanchuk!
You're screening me.

1385
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
You're screening me! Move away!

1386
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:56,300
Give him some of that back!

1387
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:59,000
Don't let him push you like that!

1388
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:12,600
Come on!

1389
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,100
- Get up!
- Get off your ass!

1390
01:49:18,135 --> 01:49:20,200
I don't know what's wrong.

1391
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,300
You bums! You're no damn good!

1392
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:36,000
Get up off your ass!

1393
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:56,600
- OK. Let's get some speed out there.
- Cement-heads.

1394
01:49:56,700 --> 01:49:59,500
Keep your eyes open. Better passing.

1395
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:02,665
Better passing.
We got a big period coming up out there.

1396
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:07,000
Try to come back with the wingers,
maybe. Tonight's the night.

1397
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:10,200
- Who wants ice packs here?
- Charlie, over here!

1398
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:16,500
We need
some more coordination out there.

1399
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:20,400
Keep your eyes open. Better passing.

1400
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:26,500
I'm comin'! I'm comin'!

1401
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:28,900
- All right. All right.
- Mother of God.

1402
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,600
I want a big rally this period. A big rally.

1403
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:35,700
- We're losin'!
- Teamwork, guys. More teamwork.

1404
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:38,000
They're buryin' us alive!

1405
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:40,300
- Eddie Shore?
- Oh, piss on Eddie Shore.

1406
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:43,100
- Old-time hockey?
- Piss on old-time hockey!

1407
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:46,300
You're blowin' it! Boys.

1408
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:51,700
Every scout in the NHL is out there tonight
with contracts in their pocket,

1409
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:55,000
and they're lookin' for talent, for winners!

1410
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:58,700
Oh! All my years of publicity!

1411
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:03,000
All the fashion shows,
the radiothons, for nothing?

1412
01:51:03,035 --> 01:51:06,000
They come here tonight...

1413
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:09,500
to scout the Chiefs!

1414
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,400
The toughest team in the Federal League!

1415
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:17,000
Not this bunch of...

1416
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:20,800
pussies!

1417
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:36,400
Scouts?

1418
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:56,200
This is more like it.
It just makes me feel real glad

1419
01:51:56,300 --> 01:52:00,200
to see the Chiefs back on the warpath
again... to coin a phrase.

1420
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:07,000
God, it's been a long time
since this place saw my shadow.

1421
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:16,500
- What am I doing here?
- You look fabulous. Now, come on.

1422
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:27,800
Oh, my God. I'd forgotten.

1423
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:37,500
Everybody is just on their feet screaming
"Kill! Kill! Kill!" This is hockey!

1424
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:41,600
Let's go, Chiefs!

1425
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:10,000
All right! Kill 'em!

1426
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:30,900
They're pummelling each other!
Wait a minute.

1427
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,700
Ned Braden is skating out
onto the centre of the ice. He...

1428
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:43,900
He's not fighting, no. He's...

1429
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:56,000
Ned Braden is starting
to take off articles of his uniform!

1430
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,300
Way to go, Ned. Way to go.

1431
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:44,900
I don't want any youngsters to get the
idea that this is the way to play hockey.

1432
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:51,900
Stop that! That's disgusting!

1433
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:59,100
- I protest!
- Protest? Protest what?

1434
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:04,300
I'm glad Mrs Carr isn't here tonight,
because this is a lascivious display!

1435
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:09,600
Take it off!

1436
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:13,100
- Make him stop or we go!
- Get your paws off me, Scarface!

1437
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:16,000
Stop him! This is a serious game,
not a freak show!

1438
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:20,800
What do you mean, a serious game? What
are you talking about? This is hockey!

1439
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:25,300
- You're afraid of these goons, aren't you?
- Watch out, punk!

1440
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:31,000
- Get that pervert off the ice!
- Hands off me, or you forfeit the game.

1441
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:33,100
Forfeit, my ass! Look at that!

1442
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:38,200
All right. That's it. That's the game.

1443
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:42,265
- You lose.
- What are you talking about, lose?

1444
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:46,900
All right, come on, dummy, you won
the game. Come on, pick up your trophy.

1445
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:53,700
Here ya go, ya bum.

1446
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:06,700
The Chiefs have won
the championship of the Federal League!

1447
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,100
He's gonna catch his death out there.

1448
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:33,200
I said some bad things about the boy,

1449
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:36,800
but we can explain that to
the exuberance and excitement of youth,

1450
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:39,800
because he's certainly
changed his ways now.

1451
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:45,400
My boy!

1452
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:17,800
- Hi, Francine!
- Francine!

1453
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:21,600
Come on, honey!
You got all the room in the world.

1454
01:58:21,700 --> 01:58:23,900
You ain't gonna hit anything. Come on!

1455
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:31,000
- I got good news!
- Honey, I'm paying by the hour for this.

1456
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:34,300
The Minnesota Night Hawks.
I'm coaching. The Big Apple!

1457
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:40,000
- Somebody's pulling a practical joke.
- No! I got a contract back there in the car.

1458
01:58:40,035 --> 01:58:43,500
Hey, the Chiefs are history,
but the minute I get up to Minnesota,

1459
01:58:43,700 --> 01:58:45,965
I'm gonna bring my guys up there.

1460
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:51,300
I mean, we're a solid act, honey.
We're starting out with something big.

1461
01:58:51,335 --> 01:58:53,300
- Oh, Jesus!
- What?

1462
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,900
You don't have my number.

1463
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,300
If you wanna get in touch with me,
just do it through the team.

1464
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,100
The Minnesota Night Hawks,
remember? OK?

1465
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:05,700
You could need
some money or something, or...

1466
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:09,600
Well, maybe things just
won't work out the way you expect.

1467
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:12,600
Jeez, we got a lot of years
between us, Francine.

1468
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:14,600
- Some hard miles, you know?
- I know.

1469
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:18,400
Oh, shut up, you goddamn meathead!

1470
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:21,000
- Honey, I gotta go.
- You gotta go.

1471
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:25,300
Listen, if things don't work out, you can
get in touch with me in Minneapolis.

1472
01:59:25,335 --> 01:59:28,600
- Bye, Reggie.
- I could make a goddamn fortune.

1473
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:54,400
- Is she comin' to Minnesota?
- For sure!

1474
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:40,300
§ Ooh, and it's all right, and it's comin' on

1475
