1
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,969
Ambrose.

2
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,909
Ambrose!
Yes, my dear?

3
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,571
What are you doing
in the bathroom?

4
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:56,808
Um...

5
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,619
Brushing my teeth, dear.

6
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,953
I don't know what's
come over you lately.

7
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:08,293
You're always in that bathroom
brushing your teeth.

8
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,726
Yes, dear.

9
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,465
Are you sure you're
brushing your teeth?

10
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,367
Yes, dear.

11
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,413
You want anything, dear?

12
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,685
Please come to bed
and put the light out.

13
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,919
Yes, dear.

14
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,825
Hurry up and come to bed.

15
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,531
Yes, I'm hurrying, dear.

16
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,160
What are you doing now?

17
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,706
I'm taking
my socks off, dear.

18
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,938
You're certainly making a lot
of noise taking your socks off.

19
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,342
Yes, dear.

20
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,493
Please come to bed
and put the light out.

21
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,057
Oh, yes, dear.

22
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,973
Legs.

23
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,179
Willie the Weasel.
What are you doing here?

24
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,148
Steve sent me over here
to lift some silverware.

25
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,414
He's off his nut. He sent
me over on the same job.

26
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,753
Everything's mixed up
since they sent Maxie to stir.

27
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,318
What's that in the pan?
Molasses?

28
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,456
Taste it. It's applejack.

29
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,826
Jersey lightning.

30
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,403
What does this applejack
remind you of?

31
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,136
It reminds me of
the old Oreland Social Club.

32
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:15,908
Remember how Saturday nights, we
used to get plastered on applejack,

33
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,940
and what we used to sing?

34
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,489
<i>On the Banks of the Wabash,
Far Away.</i>

35
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,285
Do you remember the tune?

36
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,857
<i>Oh, the moonlight's fair</i>

37
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:28,985
That's it.

38
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,758
<i>Tonight upon the Wabash</i>

39
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,696
Ambrose.

40
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,967
Ambrose!

41
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,468
Did you leave the radio on?

42
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,204
Did you leave the radio on?

43
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,402
Ambrose. Ambrose.

44
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,239
Wake up. Wake up, Ambrose.

45
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,436
Ambrose, there are burglars
singing in the cellar.

46
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,535
What?

47
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,103
Ambrose, there are burglars
singing in the cellar.

48
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,239
What are they singing?

49
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,216
What difference does it make
what they're singing?

50
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,717
Get up and see
what it's all about.

51
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,811
Yeah, that's right.

52
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,415
Don't sit there like a bump on a
stump, go down and throw them out.

53
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,053
Hurry, hurry,
hurry, Ambrose. Hurry.

54
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,960
What are they singing
down there for?

55
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,726
Oh, it doesn't matter what they're
singing. Go down quickly, Ambrose.

56
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,668
We're in danger I tell you.
We're in terrific danger, Ambrose.

57
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,501
The more haste, the less
speed. I'll be down there.

58
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:52,601
Oh, Ambrose, my poor mother.
My poor, helpless, old mother.

59
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,736
My darling...

60
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,804
She's upstairs.
They won't find her.

61
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,680
Oh, Ambrose, don't fumble.
Don't fumble, Ambrose.

62
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,809
Hurry, Ambrose, hurry.

63
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:00,978
I'm coming, dear.

64
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,611
Get these socks on, Ambrose.

65
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,350
What does it matter whether you've
got socks on or not, Ambrose?

66
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,551
I'll catch cold down there.

67
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,786
Ambrose, hurry, hurry.

68
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,194
They're great murderers, brutes,
Ambrose. They've got guns.

69
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,592
Now what are you looking for,
Ambrose?

70
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,567
I don't know,
they may not have guns.

71
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,103
Oh, Ambrose!

72
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,072
Maybe they mistook our cellar
window for a stage door.

73
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,971
Hurry, Ambrose, hurry.

74
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,600
It's getting louder
and louder and louder.

75
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:25,939
I can't find my socks.

76
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,207
You're getting me so nervous
I've lost my socks.

77
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,875
Oh, Ambrose, hurry.
What are you looking for now?

78
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,181
Why couldn't they wait
until later on in the morning?

79
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,778
Oh, hurry, Ambrose.
Hurry, hurry.

80
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,882
It's getting louder, Ambrose.
It's getting louder.

81
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,085
Hurry, Ambrose.

82
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,489
Oh, don't swat flies.

83
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,560
Hurry, Ambrose. Hurry.

84
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,432
Oh, such an earthly hour...

85
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,605
An unearthly hour.
Where are they?

86
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,837
In the cellar, Ambrose,
in the cellar.

87
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,012
I heard them there.
Listen, listen, listen.

88
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,578
Oh, what rotten voices.

89
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,311
Murderers. Brutes, Ambrose.

90
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,613
Yeah.

91
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,981
Get them, Ambrose. Get them.

92
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,714
Oh, gosh.

93
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,923
Couldn't I just sleep about another
hour, then I'll go down there?

94
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,828
Oh, Ambrose, hurry.
Hurry, Ambrose.

95
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,090
Okay.

96
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,594
Oh, this is awful.

97
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,242
Look at that. There's the gloves
that you lost two weeks ago.

98
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,173
Ambrose, get the gun!

99
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,983
Say, what are these things
doing in here, all these walnuts?

100
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:44,455
What's the difference what they're
doing? Get the gun, Ambrose! Get the gun!

101
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,984
Look, there's nothing... There's no...
Yes, here it is. Here it is. I've got it.

102
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,620
Here, I got it.

103
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,721
Be careful.

104
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,095
Oh, there's nothing
to be frightened of.

105
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,397
Be careful. It's unloaded,
there's nothing in it.

106
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,994
Careful.
It's okay.

107
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,561
There isn't a bullet in it.

108
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,641
Did I kill you?

109
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,270
Oh, leave me in peace!
Leave me in peace!

110
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:11,476
Oh, good, good, I didn't
kill you! That's fine.

111
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,176
What was that?

112
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,687
Sounded like
someone shot off a pistol.

113
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,451
That's what
it sounded like to me.

114
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,890
My baby! Did they kill you?

115
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,760
Oh, no, I'm all right, but quiet. There
are burglars singing in the cellar.

116
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,058
Burglars
singing in the cellar?

117
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,861
Yes, there are burglars
singing down in the cellar.

118
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,094
Why...

119
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,827
Give me that gun.

120
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,632
Let go, let go,
let go, will you?

121
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,104
There are burglars
singing in the cellar.

122
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,606
Look out, look out, look out.
Excuse me. Come here.

123
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,609
Come in... Come in here.
Give me... Out of the way!

124
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,804
Got a smoking revolver
in my hand, woman.

125
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,006
Dad, what's the matter? There are
burglars singing in the cellar.

126
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,207
There are burglars
singing in the cellar.

127
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,647
Burglars
singing in the cellar!

128
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,877
Yeah, there's burglars
singing in the cellar!

129
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,614
Great big fellows,
about eight feet tall...

130
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:53,148
They sound like... They sound as
though they're even more than that.

131
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,657
- What's that?
- Nuts.

132
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,626
Walnuts. I just dropped them.
I dropped them on the floor.

133
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,099
Will you go downstairs
and get them out?

134
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,898
Yes, I will. Come on, Claude.
We'll go down and root them out.

135
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,099
Claude, dear, I know you
have the heart of a lion,

136
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,002
but if you want to see your poor,
old mother die of heart failure,

137
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,644
you go down
into that cellar.

138
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,650
Oh, I won't do anything
to hurt you.

139
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,948
Indeed, Claude will not
accompany you into that cellar.

140
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,419
If anything should happen
to Claude,

141
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,651
you know very well
it would kill my poor mother.

142
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,751
How can you be so selfish?

143
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,586
Oh, wait a minute, Dad.
I'll go with you.

144
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,359
Oh, no, you won't, dear.

145
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,101
You stay here. I know
what I'll do. What?

146
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,967
I'll telephone
the Neighborhood Patrol.

147
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,870
What do I pay them
$5 a month for?

148
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,741
Oh! It's a different story when it
comes to your own flesh and blood.

149
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,800
Hmm.

150
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,538
Yeah. I think I'll go
and brush my teeth first.

151
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,881
No, you don't. You just brushed
your teeth. Sit down and telephone.

152
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,147
Oh, yes.

153
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,584
Let's see, it's...

154
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,366
Hello, hello.
Neighborhood Patrol?

155
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:13,030
Has... Oh. Oh, I beg your
pardon. Oh, I'm sorry.

156
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,273
I'm... I'm awfully...
I apologize.

157
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,477
I'm sorry, Mrs. Crudd.
I'm awfully sorry,

158
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,344
but we have burglars
singing in our cellar.

159
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,214
I thought this was the
Neighborhood Patrol, excuse me.

160
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,118
Who's that woman
you were talking to?

161
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,520
Huh? Oh, a Mrs. Crudd.

162
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,621
Why do you call her up
and tell her all your business

163
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,060
at this unearthly hour
of the morning?

164
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,566
I didn't call her up. I called
up the... The Neighborhood...

165
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,034
I tried to get the Neighborhood
Patrol and I got her on the phone.

166
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,003
Then why don't you
call the Neighborhood Patrol

167
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,404
and tell them there are
burglars singing in our cellar?

168
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,567
I'm looking for the number.

169
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,707
Here it is. Here.
There, it's simple enough.

170
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,307
Hello?

171
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,581
Hello. Is this
the Neighborhood Patrol?

172
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,351
Well, where were you?
I called the wrong...

173
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,621
Listen, come over. We have
burglars singing in our cellar.

174
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,662
Burglars singing
in the cellar?

175
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,721
Come over right away,
will you? Thanks.

176
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,323
All right, all right. That's
simple. That's all done.

177
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,804
Did you tell them who was
calling, and where to come to?

178
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,704
Who? What?

179
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,839
Gosh, I forgot that.

180
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,678
People make me sick.

181
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,772
Hey, listen, that was
Ambrose Wolfinger talking.

182
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:32,909
Yeah, come over right away.

183
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,112
There are burglars singing
in the cellar. Good. Okay.

184
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,510
Don't move!

185
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,704
A gildersleeve.

186
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,008
A cop.

187
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,861
What you drinking there?

188
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,092
Applejack.

189
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,595
There are three of them
singing now.

190
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,698
Yeah, they're singing
the same tune, too.

191
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,211
I... I feel as if
I'm getting chill!

192
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,274
Oh, would you like
a little drink of applejack?

193
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,342
Ambrose Wolfinger.

194
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,083
Well, I thought
I might join her.

195
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,988
You know perfectly well
my mother detests alcohol.

196
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,355
Oh, yes, that's right.

197
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,829
When I was a young and a pretty
girl, I always vowed to my parents

198
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:56,027
that lips that touch liquor,
would never touch mine.

199
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,331
Oh, yeah.
Pretty sentiment, very nice.

200
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,929
Yeah, that was fine of you
to say that. That's nice.

201
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:11,883
That's all right, dear. Don't worry.
I'm not even going into the cellar.

202
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,316
I'll talk to them
from the outside.

203
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,579
I'll wait up for you.

204
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:18,282
All right, dear. I don't crave an
encounter with dangerous criminals.

205
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,291
You go right in. Go right
in and go to bed, dear. Yeah.

206
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,850
All right, Dad.
All right. Goodbye, dear.

207
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,439
Oh, drat.

208
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,071
Drat.

209
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,780
Everything's okay, Mr.
Wolfinger. I got them handcuffed.

210
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,216
Oh. Oh, that's fine.

211
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,060
Merciful heavens.
What happened?

212
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,465
Oh. Oh.

213
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,745
Why couldn't I fall
on a small, dull one?

214
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,311
I caught them down here
drinking your applejack.

215
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,547
Oh, you did, eh? Oh. By the way,
would you like a drink yourself?

216
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,609
I don't mind if I do.

217
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,246
Oh, good. Oh.

218
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,918
You got the glass right here with
you, haven't you? Yeah. All right.

219
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,223
For two pins, I'd box your...

220
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,489
Are you sure those
handcuffs are on tightly?

221
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,929
Oh, they're safe.

222
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,593
For two pins,
I'd box both your ears.

223
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,637
Ah, you know how to turn
it on, you been here before.

224
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,799
Take your filthy hands
off there!

225
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,544
There you are, Officer.
Thanks.

226
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,603
Wait a minute,
I'll join you. Okay.

227
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,545
That's the old Jersey way of
getting it out of the barrel.

228
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,611
My best respects.
Fine.

229
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,265
Quiet. Cut it out, boys.

230
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,595
Tone it down a little.
Tone it down a little, huh?

231
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,697
Do you remember that tune?

232
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:21,141
We used to sing it up at the old
Tehachapi Glee Club many years ago.

233
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,374
Brings back fond memories.

234
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,184
Before I was married.

235
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,890
It's a quartet.

236
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,936
Merciful heavens,
he's singing with them now.

237
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,933
Ambrose! Ambrose?

238
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,971
Ambrose!

239
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:57,311
It's all right, dear. It's all
right, we got them hand-ironed...

240
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:01,786
They're handicapped...
Handiwork...

241
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,914
The... They got their hands
all tied up.

242
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,857
I got them,
but they can't do a thing.

243
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,656
Yeah, the police ambulance
is down in here. Yeah.

244
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,822
All right, don't worry, dear. Go
right back to sleep. All right.

245
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,059
Goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, goodbye.

246
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,401
She can hear every word
you say down here,

247
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,994
up through this pipe,
so keep quiet.

248
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,237
She's awfully nervous.
Awfully nervous.

249
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,714
Say, look here.

250
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,042
These boys seem all right.

251
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,352
Let's let them go if they
promise never to do it again.

252
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,417
Oh, no, no, nothing doing.
This is my bread and butter.

253
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:43,586
I got to take them in.

254
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:44,856
Oh?
Yeah.

255
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,127
Oh, you'll have to go along, too. Why?

256
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,895
To appear against them.

257
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:53,131
By the way, I'll have to take a jug
of this applejack along as evidence.

258
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,229
Go ahead.

259
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,866
Now, listen, Mr. Wolfinger,
I'll go through the window first,

260
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,876
and you see that they get out.

261
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,445
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

262
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,642
That leaves me down here with
them alone. Wait a minute, now.

263
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:10,086
Why can't I go out the window first,
and then I wait for... With them...

264
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,623
I'll be with them, too,
out there, won't I?

265
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,090
I'll tell you what to do,
we'll all go out together.

266
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,060
All right. Come on,
come on. Get out.

267
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,597
Go ahead, go ahead,
go ahead, now. Up!

268
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,758
Gosh.

269
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,229
Ambrose!

270
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,868
What are you doing
down in that cellar?

271
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,342
If you have apprehended the
criminals, come up here and go to bed.

272
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,379
Keep quiet, boys.

273
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,109
I don't want anybody to see me prowling
around in the middle of the night

274
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,844
dressed like this.

275
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,311
What time is it?

276
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,683
What time is it?

277
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,949
What time is it?
What...

278
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:58,901
Say, Wolfinger, what's the idea of making
all this noise at 5:00 in the morning?

279
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,637
It's 5:00.

280
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,667
Drat.

281
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,078
Say, this thing isn't
going to interfere

282
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,350
with me going to the wrestling
match this afternoon, is it?

283
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,290
Oh, I hope not.
I got a ticket myself.

284
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,227
I got a $15 seat
in the first row.

285
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,157
Had it for three weeks. Of course
my wife knows nothing about it.

286
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,201
Wrestling's in my blood.

287
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,360
No, if I hadn't
have been sidetracked,

288
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,099
I'd have been probably wrestling
in this match this afternoon myself.

289
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,698
Oh, you're a wrestler, eh?

290
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,606
You were born in Canada,
weren't you? Yeah.

291
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,974
Fine.

292
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:46,109
There isn't a man or boy born
in the United States or Canada

293
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,086
that could get out of
this hold. Come here.

294
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:54,115
Stick your head in there. Stick
it in there. Go ahead. Put it in.

295
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,222
Now, wait a minute.

296
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,597
Try to get out of that.

297
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,531
Go ahead,
try to get out of it.

298
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,336
I guess I took in
too much territory.

299
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,581
I shouldn't have
mentioned Canada.

300
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,508
Did I hurt you?

301
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,078
How could you hurt anybody
throwing them on their head?

302
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,053
Oh, dear.

303
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,146
Good morning.
Is the judge about?

304
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,049
He'll be here
in just a minute.

305
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,585
Old Honest Abe.

306
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,803
What's the charge?

307
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,714
Those two men, Your Honor, were
singing in Mr. Wolfinger's cellar.

308
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,342
These two boys here.
Yes?

309
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,387
And drinking applejack.
Where'd they get it?

310
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,081
In Mr. Wolfinger's cellar.
Down in my place.

311
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,180
Where's the evidence?

312
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,622
Right here, Your Honor.

313
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,887
Who's the owner of this applejack? I am.

314
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,452
Have you a permit
to manufacture applejack?

315
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,059
I beg your pardon?

316
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,003
Have you a permit
to manufacture applejack?

317
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,972
I guess I could
get one easy enough.

318
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,138
$30 or 30 days.
Take him away!

319
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,272
But, Judge... Oh, wait.
They came in to my...

320
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,782
Clear the court!
Clear the court!

321
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,750
Oh, this is terrible.

322
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,746
This is awful.

323
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,992
This is terrible.

324
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,955
Then... Then I... I took...

325
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,093
I took my scissors...
Yeah.

326
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:21,105
...and stuck straight into
my wife's throat, like that!

327
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,135
You tickled me.

328
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,234
Wouldn't you do the same thing
under the circumstances?

329
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,803
I would do the same thing,
I guess, or probably worse.

330
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:33,908
You know, I'm excitable.
Yeah.

331
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,953
I kill them all.
Uh-huh.

332
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,079
But that's nothing.

333
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,554
No, that didn't mean...

334
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,250
You know... You know,
my friend, Mmm-hmm.

335
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,425
I had three wives.

336
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,691
Oh, yes.

337
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,758
But this is the first one
I have killed in all my life!

338
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,929
Oh, that's in your favor,
yeah.

339
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:57,498
They have no more case against you
than the sheep has against a butcher.

340
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,009
Oh, do you think so?

341
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,942
Oh, I know it.
Excuse me a minute.

342
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:07,379
My friend here... He's... Can I get
out to send a telephone... Just for...

343
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,783
Oh, wait, I'll go with you.

344
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,446
No, no, that's all right,
that's all right.

345
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,580
I'll finish the story.

346
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,180
I can't go out
and telephone her?

347
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,557
Look here. You telephone...
Can you telephone my wife?

348
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:19,119
You can't telephone. I can
take a message out for you.

349
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,824
Will you
take a message out?

350
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,867
Search this guy. Search
him for a pair of scissors.

351
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,492
I think he's got
scissors with him.

352
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,059
My friend...

353
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,633
He's excited.

354
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:35,442
Say, look, you telephone my wife,
and tell her to get $30 over here,

355
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:39,416
and if she hasn't $30,
not to wait up for me tonight

356
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,884
because I won't be home
for a month. Will you do that?

357
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,147
My friend...
Okay.

358
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,449
...I want to tell you
something.

359
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:45,581
Yeah, okay.

360
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,022
Will you listen to me?
Yeah.

361
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,889
When I got the scissors...

362
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,461
Hello.
Who's it for?

363
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,623
It's from your father.

364
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,133
Where is he?

365
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,534
He's in jail.
They've got him locked up.

366
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,403
What's that?
What's the charge again?

367
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,270
For making liquor
without a permit?

368
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,438
Mmm-hmm.

369
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,383
How's that?

370
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:19,088
$30 or 30 days? And he didn't
have any money with him?

371
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,983
Oh, we must go immediately
to the jail and get him out.

372
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,154
And where do you suppose
we'll get the money from?

373
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,425
Oh, let him stay in jail,
it will teach him a lesson.

374
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,059
My father will not stay
in jail, not for a minute.

375
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,262
I have $30,
and I'll get him out.

376
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,966
This is a pretty kettle
of fish he's gotten us in for.

377
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,633
He's a disgrace.

378
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,906
The little snip.
It's your own fault, my dear.

379
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,280
I always advised you against
marrying a widower with a child.

380
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,588
It was awfully kind of you,
sweetheart, to come down...

381
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,386
Excuse. Pardon me.

382
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,793
It was awfully kind of you to come
down this early hour of the morning

383
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,765
and get me out.
Why didn't they send Claude?

384
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,232
You know how slow Claude is.
Yeah.

385
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,329
So I just grabbed my coat
and came on down.

386
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:12,570
Didn't your stepmother make any
fuss about giving you the $30?

387
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,774
No, Dad. She didn't make
any fuss. Didn't she?

388
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,341
Oh, she's pretty nice
about some things.

389
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,511
Yes.

390
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,112
And other things
she's not so nice about.

391
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,515
Good night, Dad.

392
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,616
Good night, dear. Good night.

393
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,384
Quite a snooze.

394
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,680
Oh, don't.
I got all I want.

395
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,186
There. Eat them up, lambikins.
They're good for you.

396
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,756
Would you mind
passing me the sugar, please?

397
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,024
Pardon me.

398
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:39,796
Wonder how the old jailbird
is this morning?

399
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,289
If you're referring
to my father,

400
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,336
I think it's very bad taste
and not a bit funny.

401
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,203
My father's only been
kind to you.

402
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,264
And during the eight years
that you've lived here,

403
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,277
he's never said
one unkind thing about you.

404
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,674
You're throwing that
up to us, are you?

405
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,911
And just because
poor Claude cannot find work.

406
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,751
You needn't throw
that in our face.

407
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:07,349
I'm not throwing it in your
face or trying to be unkind,

408
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:10,561
but I can't sit here and
listen to both you and your son

409
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,029
continually belittling
my father.

410
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,657
He's been too good to you.

411
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,028
He's the most trying man
ever put on this earth.

412
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,139
Morning, everybody.

413
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,200
Good morning, Dad.
Good morning, sweetheart.

414
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,736
Morning, dear.

415
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,742
Morning. Morning.

416
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,284
Well, I had quite an experience last
night apprehending those criminals.

417
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:40,017
Yeah, and it was funny the
way the whole thing turned out.

418
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,592
Yes. Yes, it was.

419
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,787
Yes, it was.
Indeed, it was.

420
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,560
It'll be harder than ever for
poor Claude to secure employment

421
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,658
when they know that his
brother-in-law is an ex-convict.

422
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:54,535
I don't think I should even look for
work until this whole thing blows over.

423
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:55,698
Yeah, I think that's right.

424
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,639
He isn't an ex-convict.

425
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,574
He wasn't in the jail
a half hour.

426
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:03,740
He was convicted of manufacturing
alcoholic beverages without a permit.

427
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:07,376
He never made illegal liquor.
He bought pure apple cider,

428
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,444
put it in the garden, let it freeze
and then drained the alcohol off.

429
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,980
That's just exactly what happened,
dear. Any more wheat cakes and sausage?

430
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,892
There would have been, if you'd got
to the table when the others got here.

431
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,724
I think it's a shame.

432
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,697
You little rebel, you.

433
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,259
Here, you just have some of
these ham and egg... Ham and...

434
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,896
Oh, enough of your quarrelling.
I'm sick and tired of it.

435
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:32,173
Oh, here's one of those delightful
fragments by Gertrude Smun.

436
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,103
Would you like to hear it?

437
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,538
Would you like to hear it?

438
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,106
Oh, yes, I would, dear.
Yes, surely I would, surely.

439
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,517
"We have what we have not."

440
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,111
Have we any cereal?

441
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,384
"What we have not, we have.

442
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,158
"Up is down."
Any butter?

443
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,626
"Down is..."

444
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,185
Are you listening?

445
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,924
Oh. Yes, dear.
I beg your pardon. Yes.

446
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,432
Are you going to eat
the rest of that sausage...

447
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,525
Yes, I am.

448
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,194
Oh. Well, that's all right.

449
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:04,298
"Down is out. Everyone
knew me and I was happy."

450
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,224
Are you listening?

451
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,816
Yes, dear.

452
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,231
"And we were all happy.
Is everybody happy?

453
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,769
"And I bought a big,
red apple.

454
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:36,273
"Yes, unhappiness is joy."

455
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,172
Isn't that beautiful?

456
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,074
Isn't that beautiful?

457
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,142
Very beautiful,
dear, very beautiful.

458
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,913
What's it all about?

459
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,750
What you were reading?
Yes.

460
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,312
About a apple?

461
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,283
And the wonderful part of it
is there's no punctuation.

462
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,794
Oh, that's marvelous.

463
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,729
And to think that under
that beautiful blank verse

464
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,666
they print portraits
of those horrible wrestlers.

465
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,794
Oh, Claude's going to see
that wrestling match.

466
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,601
He found a ticket,
a $15 ticket in the first row.

467
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,768
Is your toast warm, Dad?

468
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,472
No, dear, it's cold.
It's all right.

469
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,286
I've been eating cold toast
for eight years now, I like it.

470
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,685
All right, Dad. I'll meet you in
the hall. We'll drive down together.

471
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,223
All right, dear.

472
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,021
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me, dear.

473
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,186
Don't forget to pay the rent
on the way to the office.

474
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,854
Oh, no, I won't.

475
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,593
Please don't forget.

476
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:35,797
I won't. I won't. I won't.

477
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,331
Why did you give a start
at the table this morning

478
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:43,670
when Mrs. Neselrode said Claude had
found a ticket to the wrestling match?

479
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,371
I didn't know
I gave a start, honey.

480
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,344
Come on now, Dad. Fess up.

481
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,809
Didn't you have a ticket
to that wrestling match?

482
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,818
A $15 ticket in the first row?

483
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,112
I...

484
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,157
I did have a ticket,
but I lost it.

485
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,988
Exactly what I thought.

486
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:06,458
He stole that ticket out of
your pocket. I despise him, Dad.

487
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:10,063
The lazy, good-for-nothing,
fat, overfed monkey.

488
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,432
He... He isn't too fat.

489
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:19,108
Dad, I know that you would never
have married again after Mother died

490
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,674
if it wasn't for me.

491
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,608
What are you talking about?

492
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:30,416
Well, when I was a little girl, I
heard you talking to Mr. Metsinger,

493
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,285
and he was arguing with you.

494
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,656
And you said that you would
never have married again

495
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:39,088
if it wasn't that you didn't want
to see that Hope had a mother.

496
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:43,657
Now, listen, honey. I want
you to promise me one thing.

497
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:49,296
Never mention that again
as long as you live.

498
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,936
I... I must have been drinking.

499
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,571
No, Dad,
you weren't drinking.

500
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:59,814
All right.

501
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:05,688
Dad, I know your heart is set
on going to that wrestling match.

502
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,083
Now, you ask the boss for the
afternoon off and go to that match.

503
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:13,130
No one will ever know, and
you know I won't tell on you.

504
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,028
Satan, get behind me.

505
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,795
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Dad.

506
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,837
I'll see you tonight, honey.
All right.

507
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,872
Have a nice day, beauty.

508
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:26,807
Hello, Peabody.

509
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:30,245
What have you in your files
on J. Farnsworth Wallaby?

510
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,641
Send Wolfinger in here
immediately.

511
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,211
Then get the data
out of his files.

512
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,025
The only thing I can find out
is that Wallaby's credit's okay

513
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,122
and he comes from Australia.

514
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,099
Well, that isn't enough.
Now, you find something more.

515
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,328
Why...

516
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,164
Wolfinger keeps his
desk locked.

517
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:57,765
Well, Wolfinger should keep a complete
record of these people in his files.

518
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:00,333
I meet so many people,
how am I to remember them all?

519
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,675
I've explained that
to Wolfinger several times,

520
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:06,080
but he has stubbornly installed
his own jumbled system of filing.

521
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,685
Good morning, ladies.
Good morning. Good morning.

522
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,222
Good morning.

523
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,319
Morning.

524
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,225
Morning, Carlotta.

525
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,093
Good morning, Mr. Wolfinger.

526
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,163
Now, let's see...

527
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,300
Hello?

528
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,539
I want the complete record of
J. Farnsworth Wallaby right away.

529
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,877
All right. Thank you, Mr. Malloy.
I'll be right over. Thank you. Goodbye.

530
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:41,407
Mr. Wolfinger, would it be possible
for me to have the afternoon off?

531
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:44,182
I'd like to go to the wrestling
matches. I found a ticket.

532
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,813
Found a ticket?
What row was it in?

533
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,790
Just a general
admission ticket.

534
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,818
Well, I don't know. You'll have
to ask that sterling Mr. Peabody.

535
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,592
My mother's a great friend
of Hookalakah Meshobbab's.

536
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,725
She is, eh? Hookalakah.
I never knew his first name.

537
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,497
Well, that may help some.
Anyway, you ask Peabody.

538
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,561
I don't know
anything about it.

539
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,071
Good morning, Mr. Malloy.
Where have you been, Wolfinger?

540
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,010
I... Don't you remember?

541
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,948
You sent me to the bank to deposit
those checks and I had to wait there.

542
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,177
It didn't open till 9:00.

543
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,913
Oh, yes, of course, I forgot.

544
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,649
Now, what do you know
about J. Farnsworth Wallaby?

545
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,951
J. Farnsworth Wallaby...
Just a minute.

546
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,117
Miss Dickson, take this
down for reference, please?

547
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,387
Yes, sir.

548
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:28,023
J. Farnsworth Wallaby.
He's an Australian sheep man.

549
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:32,126
Came here about six years ago and
bought $8,000 of the woolen goods

550
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,898
to take back to Australia.

551
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,962
His credit is A-one.

552
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,167
He has two boys.

553
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,073
One is
a champion tennis player,

554
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:43,011
and the other one is
a manly little fellow.

555
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,881
You played golf with him. You quit
at the eighth hole, I think it was.

556
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:51,683
It rained.
You had a 94 up to then

557
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,987
and he had an 82.

558
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,351
He had a friend with him.

559
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,591
The Mithintith of Bobandale,
an Indian potentate.

560
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,995
And that night you all went
out to a cabaret, remember?

561
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,564
And you hurt your eye
some way or other.

562
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,767
It got all black around there,
and someone

563
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,571
surreptitiously placed a lady's
silk stocking in your pocket.

564
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,039
That will be all, Wolfinger.

565
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,708
Thank you.

566
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,775
Here you are, Mr. Malloy.

567
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:23,946
Thank you.

568
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:28,117
Mr. Malloy, if you want any further
information, I'll be in my office.

569
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,921
Very well, Peabody.

570
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:37,225
Well, well, well! Bless my heart.
If this isn't a sight for sore eyes.

571
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,326
Well, how are you,
Mr. Malloy?

572
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,234
J. Farnsworth Wallaby, eh?

573
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,602
That's right.

574
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,197
All the way
from the Antipodes.

575
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:45,299
Yes.

576
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:48,903
Sit down. Come, roll up a chair
and make yourself comfortable.

577
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:50,973
Here, have a cigar.

578
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,140
Thanks.

579
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:57,017
Well, well, well, this
certainly is a pleasant surprise.

580
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:06,162
By the way, how are those
wonderful sons of yours?

581
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,529
That... The tennis player,
and the other chap?

582
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,862
Oh, topping, topping!

583
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:12,194
Mr. Wolfinger.

584
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,263
Mr. Peabody wants a copy of that
letter we wrote to Mr. Knute...

585
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:23,304
S-C-H-V-E-N-D-E-N-B-O-R-G
of... K-J-O...

586
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:26,475
Why don't you kids learn
how to pronounce names?

587
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,484
Of...

588
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,696
He thinks it was about
four years ago.

589
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,664
Yeah. Yeah, that's...

590
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:45,532
Oh, I know who it is.
Surely. Four years ago.

591
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,597
It was three-and-a-half
years ago. Hold that.

592
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,010
Two years. Three years.

593
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,374
Three...

594
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,572
What is that doing in there?

595
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,349
Belongs over there. Everything's
all misplaced around here.

596
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,881
There it is. Four years ago.

597
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,221
Three-and-a-half years ago, to be
correct. Tell him that, will you?

598
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,536
Mr. Malloy.
Yes.

599
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:24,035
Would I be imposing on your good
nature if I asked for the afternoon off?

600
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,405
What for?

601
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:32,240
Why, my poor, dear mother-in-law,
Mrs. Neselrode, died several days ago.

602
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,209
Oh, I am sorry.

603
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,183
This is sad news indeed to me.

604
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,353
Thank you.
We're burying her today,

605
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:45,457
and I'd like to get the afternoon
off to go to her funeral.

606
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,121
Why, of course.

607
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,395
Why, you haven't had a day
off in 25 years. No, sir.

608
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:54,802
That's quite all right. Oh, what
did the dear old lady die of?

609
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,762
Who?

610
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,604
Why, your mother-in-law,
Mrs. Neselrode.

611
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,938
What was the complaint?

612
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,571
Oh, there wasn't
any complaint.

613
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:08,150
The other night
she got a chill, and she...

614
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,819
I said, "Why don't you take
a little drink of this..."

615
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,117
I understand. And she said,
no, she wouldn't have it.

616
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:17,126
Poison liquor, eh?
Poison liquor.

617
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,422
You know, it's a crying shame.

618
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:22,125
There have been 13 deaths from poison
liquor within the last fortnight.

619
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,828
However,
I suppose death is inevitable.

620
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,200
Yes, sir.

621
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,437
Well, you be brave, Mr.
Wolfinger, and make the best of it.

622
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,175
You're made of sterner stuff.

623
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,736
Thank you, Mr. Malloy.

624
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,647
Thank you.

625
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,985
You'll have very little difficulty
in getting off this afternoon.

626
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,496
I won't be here.

627
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:58,091
My poor mother-in-law died three days ago.
I'm attending her funeral this afternoon.

628
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,569
Isn't that terrible,
Mr. Wolfinger?

629
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:04,233
Yes, it's terrible.
It's awful. Horrible tragedy.

630
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,877
It must be hard to
lose your mother-in-law.

631
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,208
Yes, it is, very hard.

632
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,376
It's almost impossible... It's very
difficult. It's hard to lose them.

633
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,518
Don't forget to lock that
desk, will you, before you go?

634
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:17,611
Yes, Mr. Wolfinger.

635
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,383
All right. Goodbye.

636
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,651
Good night.

637
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,350
Yes, sir.

638
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,726
Peabody, inform the
departments of the sudden death

639
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,960
of Wolfinger's mother-in-law,
Mrs. Neselrode, several days ago.

640
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,661
Funeral's this afternoon.

641
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:35,194
I think we should let him know that
his fellow workers sympathize with him.

642
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:39,208
I suggest their sending
flowers or cards of sympathy.

643
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:44,744
And also contact the press
and notify them of the tragedy.

644
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,050
May I suggest that
we inform the press

645
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,086
that he is an employee
of the Malloy Company?

646
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,213
Excellent idea, Peabody. Yes.
You attend to it, will you?

647
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,813
Thank you, sir.

648
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,553
By the way,
what did she die of?

649
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,322
Bad liquor.

650
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,801
Attention, boys and girls.

651
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,810
I have a very sad message
to deliver to you.

652
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:18,545
Poor Ambrose Wolfinger's
mother-in-law, Mrs. Neselrode,

653
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:21,583
died several days ago.

654
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:26,286
Mr. Wolfinger,
whom we all honor and respect,

655
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,626
is going to the funeral
this afternoon.

656
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:33,925
If any of you wish to send a little
floral piece or message of condolence,

657
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:37,593
you may send it to
Mrs. Ambrose Wolfinger,

658
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:40,159
1627 Charter Street.

659
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,430
Pull over to the curb.

660
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,974
Have you a driver's license?

661
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,549
Nice work, nice work.

662
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,185
Didn't you see that
motorcycle there?

663
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,554
No, sir.

664
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,321
Well, didn't you see these
"No Parking" signs here?

665
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:39,623
No, sir.

666
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:43,555
In other words, you were driving without
looking where you were going, huh?

667
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,660
Well, in a way, yes.

668
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,863
Let me see your
operator's license.

669
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,205
Going to
the wrestling match?

670
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,112
Yes, I... I certainly
am if I can make it.

671
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,742
It's gonna be
the battle of the century.

672
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,718
What's your occupation?

673
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,278
Memory expert.

674
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:07,519
What's your occupation?

675
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,559
Memory expert.

676
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:14,161
This Meshobbab will kill that
Russian and toss him out of the state.

677
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:18,463
Oh, do you think so? I got a
couple of bucks to bet on Tosoff.

678
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:23,599
I got a secretary that thinks...
Her mother's a great friend...

679
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,005
Thank you.

680
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,305
A great friend of Meshobbab.

681
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,778
Boy, that's one detail I'd
sure like to be assigned to.

682
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:30,871
So would I.

683
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,472
Well, I'll be seeing you.

684
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,075
How do you do, sir?

685
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,272
Where are you going?

686
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,338
I'm going to
the wrestling matches.

687
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,407
Have you a driver's license?

688
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:11,978
I bought my ticket... Haven't bought...
Yes, a driver's license, yes, sir.

689
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,026
Do you know what
this red curbing means?

690
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,619
Yes, sir.

691
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:20,823
What does it mean?

692
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,160
No parking.

693
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:26,669
That's right. Now can you
read those letters down there?

694
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,431
Oh, yes, yes.

695
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,703
Would you...
"No parking. No parking."

696
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,075
Would you mind reading
the lettering off to me?

697
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,174
Again?

698
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,079
"No parking."

699
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,880
Read them once again,
will you?

700
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:49,550
"No parking."

701
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,687
Now just once more
to be sure you got it right.

702
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,430
"No parking."

703
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:02,028
Well, that's fine.

704
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:06,441
You knew the red paint on the
curb meant you couldn't park here.

705
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,568
Yes, sir.

706
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:12,446
You also read the sign "No parking"
painted in bold letters on the curb.

707
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:13,540
Yes, sir.

708
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:17,747
Yet you deliberately drove into
this zone knowing all those things.

709
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,153
No, sir.
What?

710
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:24,593
Yes, sir,
but if I can explain.

711
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:29,828
The officer on point duty
told me to drive in here

712
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:35,236
and run into the motorcycle...
Policeman's bicycle.

713
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,130
He did, eh?
Yes, sir.

714
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,538
Well, that's fine.

715
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:43,637
I suppose if he told you to pull out a gun
and shoot me, you'd have done that, too.

716
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,847
Yes, sir.
What?

717
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,144
No, sir.

718
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,578
Now, understand one thing.

719
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:54,488
No matter what anybody tells
you to do, I'm running this beat.

720
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,122
All right, now,
get out of here.

721
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,661
Thank you, sir.

722
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,129
Get out right now. I don't
mean a week from next Friday.

723
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,098
This very minute, right now.

724
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,828
Yes, sir.
Now, beat it.

725
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,301
I'll be out.

726
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,184
Sorry, Officer.

727
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:36,497
I'm not an officer.
I'm the chauffeur of that car.

728
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:43,000
And let me tell you one thing.
Don't back into that car again.

729
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,405
I'm very sorry.
You get me?

730
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,738
Yes, sir.

731
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,595
Well, any time
you're ready, Henry.

732
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:07,960
Sorry, madam.

733
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,351
Correct me if I'm wrong.

734
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:35,082
Did I tell you to get out of here, or
didn't I tell you to get out of here?

735
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,626
No, sir.
What?

736
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:37,990
I mean, yes, sir.

737
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:41,360
You see, but I'm wedged in
between these trunks in the front

738
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,632
and the other gentleman
in the...

739
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,768
Oh, excuse me. He isn't there.

740
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:16,291
What for you went back into the
ambulance and throw out my brother, huh?

741
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:17,628
I... I...

742
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,608
Does Mrs. Ambrose
Wolfinger live here? Yes.

743
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,941
Flowers for Mrs. Neselrode.

744
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,378
Thank you.

745
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:36,283
These flowers are for you,
dear.

746
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,087
"Abide with Him."

747
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:50,058
"Our deepest sympathy
in your great bereavement.

748
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:53,001
"The steno department."

749
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:56,261
What on earth?

750
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,510
What... What...

751
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,275
What's this?

752
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:09,910
What's this about?

753
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,980
"Rest in peace."

754
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,650
From Mr. Malloy.

755
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,925
Maybe something's
happened to Claude.

756
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,588
Or Ambrose, or Hope.

757
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:24,065
Well, something has
certainly happened to someone.

758
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,102
Oh, dear, that bell.

759
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,233
"Mr. Peabody."

760
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:39,612
Oh, I wish Claude were here!
He could tell us what to do.

761
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,173
I'll telephone Ambrose.

762
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,548
Do!

763
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:51,418
Hello?

764
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,689
I want to speak to
Mr. Ambrose Wolfinger, please.

765
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,130
Mr. Wolfinger isn't here
this afternoon.

766
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:59,362
He's taking the afternoon off to
attend his mother-in-law's funeral.

767
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,563
His mother-in-law's funeral?

768
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,973
Why, that's absurd!

769
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,174
Who is this speaking?

770
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,575
This is
Mrs. Ambrose Wolfinger.

771
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,307
My mother's not dead.
She's in perfect health!

772
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:12,814
There must be some mistake.

773
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,680
Oh, I see.

774
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,243
Good day, Mrs. Wolfinger.

775
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,686
What in heaven's name
is this all about?

776
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:27,327
The second bout of the
afternoon will be between...

777
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,729
And here we have...

778
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:17,041
Easy, easy. Easy.

779
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,109
Just another foot.

780
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:24,543
I thought you said
another foot!

781
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,953
I thought it was
another foot.

782
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,458
I beg your pardon. It
was my mistake. Pardon me.

783
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,926
When his car
backed into yours...

784
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,292
Yeah, well, it was my fault.

785
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,161
I told him to come back,
you see, another foot.

786
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:39,202
Probably so, but the backing
of the car released your wheel,

787
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,601
and your wheel is now
running down the street.

788
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,536
My wheel is running...

789
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,535
Godfrey Daniel! Excuse me.

790
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:51,803
I'll be right back. I'll pay
for any damage. Excuse me.

791
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,218
Listen to this!

792
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:16,123
"Poison liquor sends another
victim to the grave today."

793
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,564
Read that.

794
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:21,198
"When Mrs. Cordelia Neselrode,
the 15th fatality, succumbed

795
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:24,001
"complaining of a pain in her chest,
she imbibed a small quantity of liquor

796
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,632
"and within a few minutes,
died.

797
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,336
"It was reported
that the tragic details

798
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:31,073
"were related by
Mr. Ambrose Wolfinger,

799
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,013
"grieving son-in-law
of the deceased."

800
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,813
He's a fiend!
A wool in sheep's clothing!

801
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,548
A what?
A wolf in sheep's clothing.

802
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:43,616
Oh, when Claude comes home tonight,
he'll avenge his mother's honor!

803
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:47,053
And now we come to the
main bout of the afternoon.

804
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,155
In this corner we have...

805
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,169
And over here we have...

806
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,652
Come on!

807
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:51,919
Mr...

808
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:20,720
No more standing room.

809
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,325
Any more sitting room?

810
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,126
Any more...

811
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:44,839
Get the chauffeur's number.

812
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:53,688
Oh, Mr. Wolfinger.
What's happened?

813
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:55,748
What's happened?
I don't know. I'm tired.

814
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,190
Oh, my goodness.

815
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:02,195
Drunk again
and lying in the gutter.

816
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,200
Let go of his head, lady.

817
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:07,828
Why, he's dying.
Do something.

818
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,266
Oh, here's Claude.

819
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,206
Oh, Claude!

820
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,800
Look out, Ma. Have you
seen the evening paper?

821
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,402
Yes, and have you
seen the flowers?

822
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,777
No, but I saw Ambrose.

823
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,076
Has anything happened to Dad?

824
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,447
Yes.

825
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,986
He's lost his position
with the firm,

826
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,716
and this afternoon he took
a fiendish pleasure

827
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:30,157
in telling Mr. Malloy
and the newspapermen

828
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,889
that my dear, sweet mother had
died of alcoholic poisoning,

829
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:36,329
and had gone to
a drunkard's grave.

830
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:40,233
Yes, but you don't know
that he then got his secretary

831
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,897
and took her to
the wrestling matches

832
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:46,874
where they drank themselves into
imbecility and fell into the gutter.

833
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:50,106
I don't believe it.
I don't believe a word of it.

834
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:04,518
A little nose candy...
A little nosegay, dear.

835
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,259
What does this mean?

836
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,566
What does...

837
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:17,796
Godfrey Daniel!

838
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,741
Who's dead?
Your perfidious brain is dead.

839
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:25,042
Dad, did you tell Mr.
Malloy and the newspapers

840
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:27,640
that Mrs. Neselrode died
of alcoholic poisoning

841
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,241
and went to
a drunkard's grave?

842
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,753
I did not tell
the newspapers

843
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:35,188
that Mrs. Neselrode died and
went to a drunkard's grave.

844
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:39,024
Did you take your secretary to the
wrestling matches this afternoon?

845
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:44,431
Dear, I pledge you my word I did not take
my secretary to the wrestling matches.

846
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,366
I took no one
to the wrestling matches.

847
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:49,997
But I guess you did see the
wrestling matches this afternoon, Dad.

848
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,564
No, the funny thing about it,

849
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:56,203
I didn't even see the wrestling
matches this afternoon.

850
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,008
Is that the truth?

851
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:02,708
Sweetheart, I take an oath
on your poor mother's grave.

852
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,949
I never saw the wrestling
matches this afternoon.

853
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:07,718
Things happened.

854
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,053
I believe you, Dad.

855
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,453
Oh, don't say anything more.
I know everything.

856
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:13,621
Now, don't cry, dear.

857
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,857
You're exaggerating things
in your mind. Don't lie to me.

858
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,196
My poor brain can't stand it!

859
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:23,228
That black eye and your condition prove
you were drunk and lying in the gutter!

860
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:25,167
I was not drunk!

861
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:26,674
There, I knew it.

862
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,143
What are you talking about? I
saw you at the wrestling matches.

863
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:30,907
You were drunk,
lying in the gutter,

864
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,847
and you had your secretary with
you, and she was drunk, too!

865
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:37,409
Listen, Claude, I've had a lot
of trouble in the last 24 hours,

866
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:40,854
and I've just about
heard enough from you.

867
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:42,516
I admit that I was wrong

868
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:46,050
in asking for the afternoon off
to go to the wrestling matches

869
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:50,122
and giving, as an excuse,
Mrs. Neselrode dying,

870
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,761
but that is all.

871
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:55,066
You were drunk, and you
were lying in the gutter,

872
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,129
and you did take
your secretary!

873
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:00,142
You keep quiet and let my father
tell his story in his own way!

874
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,838
Don't you yell at me
or I'll slap you in the mouth!

875
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:06,413
Oh, you fiend! You fiend!

876
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,619
Dad! Dad!
Let me go! Let me go!

877
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,756
I'll knock them
for a row of lib-labs.

878
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,793
Leave this house and never
cross the threshold again,

879
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:21,228
and take your ungrateful minx
of a daughter with you!

880
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:24,025
Dad, come on.

881
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,829
I'll exterminate
the three of them.

882
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,427
Come on,
we'll go for a little ride.

883
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,764
"Rest in peace."

884
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,672
Come on.

885
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,881
Wait a minute, dear.
Well...

886
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,042
Okay.

887
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:48,954
Did you ring, sir?
Yes.

888
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,517
There's a Mr. Mockenbock who's
arriving from Hungary tomorrow morning.

889
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:55,894
I see by the files that his rating is
A-one and he's an important customer,

890
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,695
but I can't find anything
personal to talk to him about.

891
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:00,099
Where is Wolfinger?

892
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:01,659
I discharged him.

893
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:02,762
What for?

894
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,034
He lied to you,
and he took the afternoon off,

895
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,973
possibly to go to
that wrestling match.

896
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,102
He's been talking about
the wrestlers

897
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,806
and bragging about his prowess
as a wrestler for years.

898
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,849
Good gracious, you can't
discharge the poor devil

899
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:16,442
for taking one afternoon off
in 25 years.

900
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:19,511
Now, get him back, and get him
back as quickly as possible.

901
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,819
You've left us in a fine mess.

902
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:25,321
I want to get the data
on Mr. Mockenbock at once.

903
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,097
Where does Mr. Wolfinger
keep his files?

904
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,192
They're in here, sir.

905
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:38,034
But I'm afraid they'll
appear disordered to you.

906
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:42,567
I've tried to install a filing system
but Mr. Wolfinger prefers his own methods.

907
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:47,779
So this is
the famous filing system, eh?

908
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:51,111
Where can we find Wolfinger?
I don't know.

909
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:52,711
His wife has thrown him
out of the house.

910
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:56,020
She informed me that he attended
the wrestling matches yesterday,

911
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,424
that this girl, his secretary,
accompanied him,

912
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:02,521
that they were both drunk,
and that Wolfinger was found

913
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,191
lying in the gutter.

914
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,997
This is a gross exaggeration
and a fabrication!

915
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,766
True, I did attend
the wrestling matches,

916
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,798
only because my mother is a very
dear friend of Hookalakah Meshobbab,

917
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:16,868
but when Hookalakah
threw Tosoff from the ring,

918
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:20,438
he struck poor Mr. Wolfinger in
the chest, knocking him insensible.

919
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:21,813
What did you
expect me to do,

920
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:25,342
stand there like a dummy and watch
my poor boss die in the gutter?

921
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:28,322
I am sick and tired... You
think I'm gonna take your word...

922
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,619
Stop it!

923
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:33,150
You've overstepped your
authority. Come into my office.

924
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,168
You get on that phone
and locate Wolfinger,

925
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,329
and stick to it
if it takes all day!

926
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:43,667
Yes, sir.

927
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:49,809
I don't understand how you could
have used such bad judgment.

928
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:14,766
I'll get it, honey.
No, I'll get it, Dad.

929
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:15,997
Hello?

930
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,574
Is this Miss Wolfinger?

931
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:21,842
I've got it.

932
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:25,176
Mr. Malloy has spoken to me,

933
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,546
and inasmuch as
Mr. Wolfinger's been

934
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,915
with the firm for
more than two decades,

935
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:36,086
he thinks that if Mr. Wolfinger will
return to work and forget wrestling,

936
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:41,927
Mr. Malloy will accept my suggestion
that he return to his old position.

937
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:46,392
Well, thank you. I... I know he'd
appreciate that if he were here,

938
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,369
but he's in the shower.

939
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,396
He's going on an interview
this morning to...

940
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:52,771
Who's in the shower?
Anybody in the...

941
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,332
Dad, quiet.

942
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,242
What do you mean,
"in the shower"?

943
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:59,281
Dad, will you please
sit down and be quiet?

944
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,608
I say, he's going on an interview
this morning to see Mr. Mo Littvack,

945
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:07,315
the president of
the Irish Woolen Mills.

946
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,188
Mo Littvack, president
of the Irish Woolen Mills?

947
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,658
Dad, please.

948
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:15,656
She says he's negotiating with
the Irish Woolen Mills, Limited.

949
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,199
Offer him $75 a week

950
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:20,565
and tell his daughter to get
in touch with him immediately.

951
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,096
Mr. Malloy has
just informed me

952
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:28,234
that on account of his long
association with your father

953
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,279
he can offer $75 a week.

954
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:33,714
Well, I don't think
that would be adequate.

955
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:36,944
I know that he's
considering an offer

956
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,378
of $100 a week

957
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,191
with four weeks' vacation

958
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,525
at full pay.

959
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,087
The Irish Woolen Mills
have offered him $100 a week

960
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:50,155
and four weeks' holiday
on full salary.

961
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:54,033
All right, offer him the same, but
have him report here in the morning.

962
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,029
How can he report
in the morning

963
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,972
if you're gonna give him
a four weeks' holiday?

964
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,133
Dash.

965
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:02,669
Dash!

966
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,006
Dash!

967
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:08,147
All right.

968
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,377
We'll meet the offer, but
at the end of the four weeks,

969
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,546
I want him here on the job!

970
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:18,023
Mr. Malloy will
meet the offer.

971
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:23,361
You know what
I was thinking I'd do?

972
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:24,763
What, Dad?

973
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:28,402
I thought I'd get
down to the firm

974
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:32,407
and tell them that
I'd work for less money.

975
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:38,175
'Cause Claude and Mrs.
Neselrode aren't living with us

976
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:41,375
and our expenses
aren't so high, so...

977
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,849
Well, as a matter of fact...

978
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,147
...I thought that...

979
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,916
...I was so busy cooking
I forgot to tell you

980
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,958
that your firm wants you back
at your old job

981
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:56,728
at $100 a week with a four-week
vacation at full pay and in advance.

982
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:01,760
I'm sorry
I wasn't here, dear.

983
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:05,335
I'd have told them
I wanted $200 a week

984
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,102
a six months' vacation
and full pay.

985
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:15,748
I want that paper to wrap up
these belongings of Ambrose.

986
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:17,285
The weather's
turning cold now

987
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,913
and I want to take his
underwear and socks over to him.

988
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,820
I think you're a perfect fool.

989
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,485
Why don't you let him come
and get them himself?

990
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,394
Please let me do things in my
own way, and hand me that paper.

991
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:31,790
If you take that paper,
he's sure to wake up.

992
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:39,237
You'd better stir yourself and
go into town and look for a job.

993
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:42,903
This is just a lot of nonsense, taking
a nap every morning after breakfast.

994
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:44,446
There, there.

995
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,271
There, cover up,
you'll catch more cold.

996
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,079
Leave me alone, Ma.

997
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,784
I do believe you're still
in love with that old fool.

998
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:56,256
That's a fine thing
for you to call him

999
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:58,691
after he went out of his way
to invite you and Claude

1000
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:01,423
to go for a ride
in his new car tomorrow.

1001
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:03,260
I'll be back later.

1002
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:16,870
Why, it's beginning to rain!

1003
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,372
Oh...

1004
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,880
Take a drink of this
hot coffee, Dad.

1005
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,984
Try one of these sandwiches.
