1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:02,942
Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:04,513
Sooner or later
someone is gonna flip.

3
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:06,238
I've got nine guys.
They were part of the

4
00:00:06,347 --> 00:00:08,704
previous operation and
they know a lot.

5
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:11,000
My uncle's got his
hookups in prison,

6
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:12,736
I think could be
a real help to us if--

7
00:00:12,876 --> 00:00:14,740
I just wanna get my
money and get out.

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,019
If you leave, you get nothing!

9
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:18,469
The names of your nine men.

10
00:00:18,556 --> 00:00:21,200
- You owe me that much.
- I don't owe you a damn thing.

11
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:25,185
I just realized that Lydia has the names.
I can get them from her.

12
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:26,914
Let me die in peace.

13
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,066
Mr. White?

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,901
Hello?

15
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:48,741
Mr. White, the, uh,
car's been dealt with,

16
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,260
sir.

17
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,298
No one tailed you?

18
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,016
No. I stayed off
the main streets

19
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:59,218
and kept checking, so...

20
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:03,640
Joe ask any questions?

21
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,059
I told him RV job,
just like you said,

22
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,761
and he totally knew.

23
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,370
It's pretty cool
the way they do that--

24
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,740
Turn a car into a cube.

25
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:38,958
So, should we deal
with this other thing now?

26
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,769
Yeah.

27
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,606
Sure.

28
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,289
I don't want to talk
about this.

29
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,624
Okay.

30
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,793
It had to be done.

31
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,430
Okay.

32
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:20,550
All right.

33
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,570
I need to talk to you.

34
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,354
In private.

35
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:51,214
So what's the story?

36
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:53,216
You get to Mike?

37
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,384
Mm-hmm.

38
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:56,719
He get out safe?

39
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:58,721
He's gone.

40
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:00,556
All right.

41
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,094
Well, what about
those nine guys in jail?

42
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,181
They got no reason
not to talk now.

43
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,715
So what do we do?

44
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:12,935
"We"? Who's "we"?

45
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:16,572
There is no "we," Jesse.

46
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:19,525
I'm the only vote left,

47
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,078
and I'll handle it.

48
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:59,766
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

49
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,087
My client will supply
vital information

50
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,956
relating to the organization,
distribution, and production

51
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:34,292
of Fring's methamphetamine
enterprise.

52
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,627
In exchange, we expect
all charges to be dropped,

53
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:38,847
and Dennis not only
walks out of here a free man,

54
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:40,482
but also receives
blanket immunity.

55
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,187
For what he's gonna be furnishing,
this deal is plenty fair.

56
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:52,477
Best I'd be willing to do
is queen for a day

57
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:53,811
and reduced charges.

58
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:55,146
All charges dropped.

59
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:57,148
Queen for a day
and a five-K.

60
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,867
That's the best
you're gonna get.

61
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:01,286
No way.
Guys, come on.

62
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,455
You can be a fairy princess,
for all I care.

63
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:04,789
Where you going?

64
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,291
I'm going shopping for someone

65
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,992
who can tell me something
I don't already know.

66
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,261
Hey, hey.

67
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:12,597
I got plenty you don't know.

68
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,666
You seem a little confused.

69
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:17,352
This here is a buyer's market.

70
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,804
I got eight other assholes
just like you,

71
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,973
four of them within
100 feet from here.

72
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,975
I also got
Dan the douche bag lawyer

73
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,777
who's gonna give me the money
and Ehrmantraut.

74
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:28,396
So settle in, Dennis.
Enjoy your new home.

75
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:31,015
I'm gonna go rattle some cages.

76
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:14,725
So?

77
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:16,911
Maybe you should
order something.

78
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:18,913
Do you want a coffee
or something?

79
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:21,583
Not just now.

80
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:24,619
I think this would play better
if you ordered something.

81
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,089
I think this will play just
fine, and I'm not thirsty.

82
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:30,575
So let's take a look
at the list.

83
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,879
Lydia, you've come
all this way.

84
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,881
- You do have the list?
- Yes, I have it.

85
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,216
Good.

86
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,051
It's just not written down.

87
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,719
And why is that?

88
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,305
It's in my head.
Safer there.

89
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:45,807
I see.

90
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:47,925
Then I suggest
you pick up a pen.

91
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:49,611
Not just yet.

92
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,648
It was my understanding

93
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,733
that attending
to these nine names

94
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,819
was precisely what you wanted.

95
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,405
Ten names now.
Ten, counting the lawyer.

96
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,541
Yes. Ten,
counting the lawyer.

97
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:05,210
So, what,

98
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:06,995
am I not tying up loose ends

99
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:08,779
for our mutual benefit?

100
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:11,966
You're tying up loose ends, and
I don't wanna be one of them.

101
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:14,385
Once I give you that list,
I've served my purpose,

102
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,804
and then maybe I'm just one
more person who knows too much.

103
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:20,642
So, you put that list
in my hands,

104
00:08:20,676 --> 00:08:22,510
and in your mind,

105
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:25,980
I immediately just murder you,

106
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:27,965
- just right here in this restaurant?
- No.

107
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,852
- Right here in this public place,
immediately? - Not right here.

108
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:32,854
- That is not what I--
- Listen, Lydia.

109
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:35,523
You made me promise
on my children's lives

110
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:37,308
that I guaranteed your safety.

111
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:38,976
From Mike.

112
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:41,696
You guaranteed
I'd be safe from Mike.

113
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:44,365
There's no way
he'd ever go for this--

114
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,252
You getting rid of his guys.

115
00:08:47,286 --> 00:08:49,704
You wouldn't be doing this--
The names--

116
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:51,956
if Mike were still a factor.

117
00:08:56,595 --> 00:08:59,797
Yeah.
That's what I thought.

118
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,019
What do you want, exactly?

119
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:08,339
Because if you don't want
to give me that list,

120
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:11,359
then I've truly got
no use for you.

121
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,731
I can grow your business
exponentially.

122
00:09:16,782 --> 00:09:18,349
Just give me the list.

123
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,518
I can do that
by helping you expand

124
00:09:20,536 --> 00:09:22,453
into a larger, highly active,

125
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:25,022
highly profitable marketplace.

126
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,793
What do you know
about the Czech Republic?

127
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,712
The Czech Republic?

128
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:32,714
Did you know there's
a higher demand for meth there

129
00:09:32,748 --> 00:09:34,666
than anywhere else in Europe?

130
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,918
Five percent
of its ten million people,

131
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:39,504
which is roughly
the population of the Southwest

132
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,756
from Western Texas to Phoenix,

133
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:43,424
are using meth.

134
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:45,260
You keep your market here,

135
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:46,811
but by adding overseas sales,

136
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:48,879
you can more than double
your current profits.

137
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:50,381
And I checked.

138
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,017
The average purity
is only about 60 percent.

139
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,404
They've never seen
anything like your product.

140
00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:59,223
You'll blow their hair back.

141
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:03,161
Shipping internationally

142
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:05,496
seems like courting disaster.

143
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,665
- Not if you're Madrigal.
- Madrigal

144
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,084
is under investigation
by the DEA.

145
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,786
The restaurant division,
mostly.

146
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:13,871
We've got 46,000 employees

147
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,073
spread across 14 divisions.

148
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:19,177
And once Mike's people
are no longer a factor,

149
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:21,179
things should tidy up nicely.

150
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:22,847
This is what I do,
you understand?

151
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:25,850
I move things from point A to
point B all over the globe.

152
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:28,052
1.2 million metric tons
a month,

153
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,855
and all of it
right at my fingertips,

154
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:33,057
a laptop click away.

155
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,728
The Czech Republic...

156
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,730
Who's there on the other end?

157
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,231
People I ship to regularly.

158
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,733
People I've worked with
for years.

159
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,234
They're professional
and very amenable.

160
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,204
I'm very careful
who I work with.

161
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,912
And if this is
such a slam dunk,

162
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,998
then why didn't you
pitch it to Fring?

163
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:58,499
I did.
He said yes.

164
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,951
We were in the final stages
of working it out

165
00:11:00,969 --> 00:11:02,670
when somebody killed him.

166
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:09,477
You don't think Gus Fring

167
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:12,146
built his distribution network
all by himself?

168
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:15,266
There are
considerable advantages

169
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,968
to diversification
of distribution,

170
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:20,655
like putting 6,000 miles

171
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:23,574
between you and your product.

172
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:27,161
At 25 pounds a week,

173
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:29,280
I'm estimating you'll gross
about two million.

174
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,252
Give me ten pounds to start,
and we'll see how it goes.

175
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:38,656
All right.

176
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:40,591
Now, with Fring,

177
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:42,377
my end was gonna be 30 percent,

178
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:45,213
- which I believe is more than fair.
- Okay.

179
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:47,515
- Trust me, if you do this--
- Lydia,

180
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:50,385
learn to take yes
for an answer.

181
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,138
Now, first things first.

182
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:30,040
Shake on it?

183
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,514
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

184
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:08,820
Todd, I think it's time
I meet your uncle.

185
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:10,822
No iron pile.

186
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:13,491
There's too many muscle-heads
flexing their shit.

187
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:14,993
Too many eyes.

188
00:14:15,027 --> 00:14:18,296
Okay, so no chow line, no yard.

189
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:19,915
Gonna keep it simple.

190
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:21,699
Pass-byes.

191
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:25,420
Yeah. Hallways,
shower room, cells.

192
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:27,205
The easy stuff.

193
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:29,007
I say we go with a riot.

194
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,875
Our boys get it done in a riot.

195
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:32,894
No, no, no.
No chaos.

196
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:37,148
I don't want the goon squad
rolling in and stealing our shot,

197
00:14:37,183 --> 00:14:39,150
you know?

198
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:42,070
This has gotta be
fast and quiet.

199
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:44,222
Just boom, boom, boom.

200
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,358
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

201
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:48,693
Surgical.

202
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:52,447
Surgical.
That's what it's gotta be.

203
00:14:52,498 --> 00:14:56,368
So how many guys we got at MDC?

204
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:59,704
Three, counting Shaddock.

205
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:01,206
And he makes the schedule now,

206
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,242
so we can put who we need
where we need them.

207
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,429
All right. So MDC's covered.
What about the rest?

208
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:09,247
We need G block
in Valencia, right?

209
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:11,967
Our guy's on the night shift.

210
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:13,768
- Have him pull a double.
- Nah.

211
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:16,388
His supervisor's got
some hard-on about OT.

212
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:18,773
Have him switch with somebody.
I don't know. Just get it done.

213
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:22,060
Regardless, you know, we got
enough guys in Valencia right now?

214
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:23,561
Might have to hire out.

215
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:26,114
You high?
Mix blood with <i>chuntaros?</i>

216
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:28,233
- No way.
- Well...

217
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,989
There's no need.
We got enough.

218
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,490
Hitters ain't the problem.

219
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,609
- It's that short walking window
after lunch. - Mm-hmm.

220
00:15:38,627 --> 00:15:39,828
Yeah.

221
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:42,280
It's gonna be tight.

222
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:44,249
Real tight.

223
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:51,589
You know, I gotta be straight
with you, man.

224
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:54,125
Taking out all these guys
is doable.

225
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:57,846
But hitting them in three separate
jails all within two minutes?

226
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:00,648
Whacking Bin Laden
wasn't this complicated.

227
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:08,440
Where do you suppose
these come from?

228
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:10,942
I've seen this one before.

229
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,944
I wonder,

230
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:14,946
are they all...

231
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,165
in some giant warehouse
someplace?

232
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,507
Hey.

233
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:31,262
It can be done,
just not the way you want it.

234
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:51,983
It can be done
exactly how I want it.

235
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:56,037
The only question is,
are you the man to do it?

236
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:06,881
Figure it out.

237
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,700
That's what I'm paying you for.

238
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,609
Aah!

239
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:24,802
What's happening?

240
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:27,472
Oh! Oh!

241
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:33,010
No, man! Help me!

242
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:35,179
Help me! Help!

243
00:19:35,197 --> 00:19:36,981
Help me!

244
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:52,413
Excuse me a second.
Grab more photos, will you?

245
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:07,812
Yes?

246
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:09,681
<i>It's done.</i>

247
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:21,841
<i>New details have emerged in the spate of
jail deaths that rocked central New Mexico</i>

248
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,871
<i>three days ago.</i>

249
00:20:23,905 --> 00:20:27,215
<i>As of yet, no names of victims have been
released, but authorities continue</i>

250
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,443
<i>to investigate</i>
<i>what appears to be</i>

251
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,379
<i>a carefully coordinated</i>
<i>sequence of attacks</i>

252
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:34,548
<i>that occurred within minutes</i>
<i>of one another</i>

253
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,001
<i>in three different</i>
<i>correctional facilities...</i>

254
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:39,170
- Is it okay if I turn this off?
- Oh, sure.

255
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,971
I don't want
the news on right now.

256
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:44,425
Hank just pulled up,
and he's not in the best mood.

257
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:46,627
Oh, all right.
Well, I'll get out of your hair.

258
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,179
Okay.

259
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,064
Hi, honey.

260
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:51,565
Mwah!

261
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,151
Dinner will be
in about an hour.

262
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,489
And I thought we could have
that chicken that you like.

263
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,141
Or-- or we could
order Chinese?

264
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,276
- Sure.
- There you go.

265
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:06,280
There you are.

266
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:09,283
Wanna play with your toys?

267
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:11,485
I'll see you
in a little bit, okay?

268
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,153
See you in a little bit.

269
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,506
Hey, Hank.
I was just getting ready to leave.

270
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,007
Want a drink?

271
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,010
Um, yeah, sure. Thanks.

272
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,096
Perfect.

273
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:27,635
- Rocks, right?
- Rocks, yes.

274
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,588
Been thinking about
this summer job I used to have.

275
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:40,624
Oh, yeah?

276
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,262
Back in college,
I'd spend my days...

277
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,850
marking trees in the woods
with this--

278
00:22:49,884 --> 00:22:52,603
this orange spray can.

279
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:56,223
Marking trees?

280
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:59,092
Yeah. Crews would
come in later

281
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,146
and find the trees I tagged
and cut them down.

282
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,986
First, you go in,
and you mark locations

283
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:12,323
for skid trails and landings.

284
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:14,325
Then you choose specific trees

285
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:17,244
all within a selected grid.

286
00:23:20,548 --> 00:23:22,666
Every day,

287
00:23:22,717 --> 00:23:25,135
I'd go back,

288
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,454
hike in,

289
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:30,290
pick up where I left off.

290
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:37,097
Oh. Sounds nice,

291
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:39,767
being out in the woods all day.

292
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,769
Nah, it wasn't so great.

293
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:44,571
I got sunburned.
There were mosquitoes.

294
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:46,657
I just wanted
to make a few bucks.

295
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,642
Buy beer.

296
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:53,614
Been thinking about that job
more and more lately.

297
00:23:54,982 --> 00:23:58,168
Maybe I should've
enjoyed it more.

298
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:01,705
Tagging trees is a lot better
than chasing monsters.

299
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:19,106
I used to love to go camping.

300
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,372
This way. Here, baby girl.
Come see your brother.

301
00:28:12,406 --> 00:28:14,508
There you go, sweetie.
That's it.

302
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,760
Oh, my God!
Look at her go!

303
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:18,261
Good job!

304
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,097
- Peekaboo. This way.
- Good job!

305
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,748
Here. Let's go see your brother.
Let's get him.

306
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,750
- Get him!
- Where'd you go?

307
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,752
I can't see you.
Where'd you go?

308
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,889
There you are!

309
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:31,925
You're really good with her.

310
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,644
Come here, my baby girl.

311
00:28:33,695 --> 00:28:36,813
You're gonna be a handful,
aren't you? Yeah.

312
00:28:36,864 --> 00:28:39,900
Mama's gonna get her exercise.
Aw.

313
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:45,772
Hey, do you, uh-- You wanna watch a movie?

314
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,659
Hey, Louis.

315
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,276
Uh...

316
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:51,945
One moment.

317
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,714
Uh, nothing.

318
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:56,083
What's up?

319
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,673
Oh, well.

320
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:11,982
It's nice to see you
smile again.

321
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:15,152
I mean, you seem good.

322
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,605
Yeah.
I'm hanging in there.

323
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,976
To see you laugh
like that just now...

324
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,380
It's such an improvement,
don't you think?

325
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:31,918
I don't--
I don't really...

326
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:39,026
We've been thinking,

327
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,496
Hank and I, that...

328
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:46,349
it may be time
to take the kids home.

329
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:51,688
It's been almost
three months, right?

330
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,641
Almost three?

331
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:56,026
Um...

332
00:29:57,895 --> 00:30:00,230
D-does Hank not want--

333
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,200
Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, God. No. No.

334
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,319
Hank's crazy for these kids.
You know that.

335
00:30:06,353 --> 00:30:08,855
It goes without saying,
we love having them.

336
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,791
And we're always here for you

337
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:14,661
and wanna help you
any way that we can.

338
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:16,630
But...

339
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:21,752
We're starting to worry

340
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:24,671
that maybe...

341
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:29,375
Maybe we're enabling you.

342
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:36,382
Sweetie, you've had
a lot on your plate,

343
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,487
and you and Walt
have had a lot--

344
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:44,407
so much to contend with.

345
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:48,245
And I'm so proud of you for going to
therapy, by the way. You know that, right?

346
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,697
It can be so helpful,
such a good tool.

347
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:54,785
And I'm very,
very proud of you,

348
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:56,620
but I--

349
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:58,672
We...

350
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:03,760
Maybe at this point,

351
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,712
the best way

352
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:08,014
to help repair the family

353
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:11,685
would be to repair the family,

354
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:13,220
you know?

355
00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:24,007
Take a drive with me.

356
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,534
Walt.

357
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,558
This is it.

358
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:20,546
This is what
you've been working for.

359
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,235
I rented this place,
and I started bringing it here,

360
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,237
because...

361
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:30,941
I didn't know what else to do.

362
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:33,660
I gave up counting it.
I mean, I had to.

363
00:33:33,694 --> 00:33:35,912
It was just so much, so fast.

364
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,616
I-- I tried
weighing it.

365
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:42,068
I figured one bill

366
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:44,570
of any denomination
weighs a gram.

367
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:47,257
There are 454 grams to a pound,

368
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,243
but...

369
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:55,432
there's a variety
of denominations,

370
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,250
so...

371
00:33:58,886 --> 00:34:01,137
How much is this?

372
00:34:03,024 --> 00:34:05,442
I have no earthly idea.

373
00:34:07,061 --> 00:34:09,062
I truly don't.

374
00:34:10,064 --> 00:34:12,899
I just stack it up,
keep it dry,

375
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:15,285
spray it for silverfish.

376
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:20,323
There is more money here

377
00:34:20,374 --> 00:34:23,410
than we could spend
in ten lifetimes.

378
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:25,912
I certainly can't launder it,

379
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:28,614
not with 100 car washes.

380
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:34,471
Walt...

381
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:39,059
I want my kids back.

382
00:34:40,177 --> 00:34:44,681
I want my life back.

383
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:48,685
Please tell me...

384
00:34:48,736 --> 00:34:50,687
How much is enough?

385
00:34:50,738 --> 00:34:54,941
How big does this pile
have to be?

386
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,164
Ow!

387
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:14,166
Aw, shit!

388
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:48,166
Hi.

389
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:50,085
Hey.

390
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:52,370
Um, I--

391
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:55,290
I hope I'm not
disturbing you or anything.

392
00:36:55,341 --> 00:36:56,791
I tried calling,
but, uh--

393
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:59,461
Yeah. No, I, uh,
tossed all my burners.

394
00:36:59,512 --> 00:37:02,430
Oh. And you didn't answer
your home line, so--

395
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:04,382
It's disconnected.

396
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:07,886
Oh, um, unplugged, I mean.

397
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,889
Did you leave a message, or...

398
00:37:10,923 --> 00:37:13,225
Uh, no.

399
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:18,363
So, what's up?

400
00:37:18,397 --> 00:37:21,366
I was just in the neighborhood,

401
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,320
so I thought I'd drop by
and say hello.

402
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:33,111
You, uh, wanna come in, or...

403
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:35,113
Uh, sure.

404
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:36,631
Thanks.

405
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:53,014
You know, I'd offer you a--
a beer or something, but--

406
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:55,100
No, no. No, I'm--
I'm--

407
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:58,136
I'm-- I'm fine, thanks.

408
00:37:58,154 --> 00:38:01,523
You, uh, didn't
wind up moving, I see.

409
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:03,608
Didn't have to.

410
00:38:03,642 --> 00:38:06,328
Saul told me what you did.

411
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:13,702
Anyways, uh, I'm not in jail.

412
00:38:13,753 --> 00:38:17,289
You aren't either,
so there you go.

413
00:38:18,324 --> 00:38:20,592
There was
no other option, Jesse.

414
00:38:20,626 --> 00:38:23,044
It had to be done.

415
00:38:27,216 --> 00:38:29,217
I'm not coming back.

416
00:38:30,669 --> 00:38:32,887
I know.

417
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:35,506
So why are you here,

418
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:37,392
exactly?

419
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:47,518
It's funny. I...

420
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:50,488
I saw a Bounder the other day.

421
00:38:50,522 --> 00:38:52,791
- Bounder?
- Yeah.

422
00:38:52,825 --> 00:38:55,126
Our RV?
A Bounder?

423
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:57,829
Oh. Oh.

424
00:38:57,863 --> 00:39:00,832
Oh, you saw
the same one as ours?

425
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:04,169
Yeah. Well, within a
couple years, I guess.

426
00:39:04,203 --> 00:39:05,503
Early '80s.

427
00:39:05,537 --> 00:39:07,505
It was certainly in
a lot better shape

428
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:09,057
than our old hunk of junk.

429
00:39:09,091 --> 00:39:12,344
A much nicer paint job.

430
00:39:12,378 --> 00:39:15,480
No bullet holes in the door.

431
00:39:15,514 --> 00:39:18,600
Yeah. That thing
was a nightmare, huh?

432
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:21,936
Oh, it was primitive.

433
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:24,272
You know, whenever
I hit a red light,

434
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:26,908
I used to pray

435
00:39:26,942 --> 00:39:29,694
it wouldn't crap out on me.

436
00:39:29,728 --> 00:39:31,196
Yeah.

437
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,899
And then, suddenly,
it would sometimes have that--

438
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:37,252
that screeching sound that
just-- out of the blue,

439
00:39:37,286 --> 00:39:39,204
like we hit a pack of cats.

440
00:39:39,238 --> 00:39:42,507
Power steering belt.
That's what that was.

441
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:44,709
I always had this--

442
00:39:44,743 --> 00:39:46,795
this whole system--

443
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:49,631
strategy-- to not let
it idle too low.

444
00:39:49,682 --> 00:39:52,250
Remember that time we ran out
of gas coming back from a cook?

445
00:39:52,268 --> 00:39:55,253
Ah, the gauge.
The gauge always said half-full, so...

446
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:57,939
Yeah, you had to walk three
miles with a jerry can

447
00:39:57,973 --> 00:39:59,941
while I waited
on the side of the road,

448
00:39:59,975 --> 00:40:03,278
praying the whole time
that no cop would show up,

449
00:40:03,312 --> 00:40:04,946
no good samaritan.

450
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,815
God.

451
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:08,316
We had money.

452
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:10,735
Why'd we keep it?

453
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:13,705
Why did we have to have
the world's shittiest RV?

454
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:16,458
- Inertia?
- Yeah.

455
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,327
Yeah.

456
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:21,379
Inertia.

457
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:38,179
So, hey, um, you know,
I gotta get going.

458
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,598
- Yeah. No, me too. - I'm just
meeting up with some friends, and--

459
00:40:40,632 --> 00:40:42,984
I gotta get going as well.

460
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:50,658
I left something for you.

461
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:27,738
Hey.

462
00:42:40,135 --> 00:42:42,270
I'm out.

463
00:42:48,894 --> 00:42:50,895
I'm out.

464
00:43:39,445 --> 00:43:41,412
With some big earrings,
it could be really nice.

465
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:44,666
Perhaps some big hoops.
I feel like I just want

466
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,834
to mix it up
with my hair this summer.

467
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:49,170
- You know, like color...
- Yeah. I don't know.

468
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:51,673
Did you have a coin collection?
I had coins.

469
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:54,509
...have the time
to do hobbies.

470
00:43:54,543 --> 00:43:57,662
Coins and baseball cards.
Those were the ones.

471
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,131
You can play around with it
and take them in and out...

472
00:44:00,165 --> 00:44:02,050
Not enough hours
in the day, right?

473
00:44:02,101 --> 00:44:04,886
- Not enough hours...
- My hairstylist told me

474
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:07,055
to take prenatal vitamins.

475
00:44:07,106 --> 00:44:08,606
For your hair?

476
00:44:08,641 --> 00:44:11,225
He said they work,
so I figure why not?

477
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:13,177
Oh, uh, Flynn,

478
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:15,363
could you put some more
sunscreen on Holly?

479
00:44:15,397 --> 00:44:17,315
Yeah.
Is it over there?

480
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:18,900
- Yeah, it's right here.
- Okay.

481
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,785
...for a home brew,
though.

482
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:22,787
Papa-free.
That's good.

483
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:25,990
- Although I don't know why it would be bad.
- Yeah. I know. Me neither.

484
00:44:26,024 --> 00:44:28,743
Oh, do you-- I used to squeeze
lemon juice in my hair.

485
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:30,078
You remember that?

486
00:44:30,129 --> 00:44:33,414
You wanted to be
a beach bum so badly.

487
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:34,916
- I did.
- Ohh.

488
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:37,802
You and your stiff hair.

489
00:44:37,836 --> 00:44:41,472
- Stiff what?
- Hey, hey.

490
00:44:41,507 --> 00:44:43,874
I was interested
to see you get into that.

491
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:46,594
- Borage oil is supposed to be good.
- It's like chemistry.

492
00:44:46,645 --> 00:44:48,846
- Is it really? Better than flaxseed?
- I don't know.

493
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,765
That's cool.
I like your style.

494
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:53,184
There is no Christmas.
There is no Christmas...

495
00:44:53,218 --> 00:44:54,819
Maybe I should brew up a batch.

496
00:44:54,853 --> 00:44:56,387
- What do you think?
- Ooh, Schraderbrau?

497
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:57,739
- Yeah.
- I vote yes.

498
00:44:57,773 --> 00:44:59,023
I second that.

499
00:44:59,057 --> 00:45:00,575
Well, there you go.
It's unanimous.

500
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:02,076
Well, who am I to fly

501
00:45:02,111 --> 00:45:04,696
in the face of public demand, right?

502
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,753
All right. Hold on.

503
00:45:11,787 --> 00:45:14,422
Anybody, uh-- anybody want anything?
Want anything?

504
00:45:14,456 --> 00:45:16,207
No, I'm good.
I'm good, thank you.

505
00:45:16,241 --> 00:45:17,875
All right.

506
00:45:17,909 --> 00:45:20,077
Does it look glossier?

507
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:22,430
- Do I have a halo?
- I don't know.

508
00:45:22,464 --> 00:45:25,082
- How's she doing?
- She's good.

509
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,468
- I used to have that halo.
- Yeah.

510
00:45:46,605 --> 00:45:49,040
Ahhh.

511
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:34,335
<i>"To W.W., my star,</i>

512
00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:36,704
<i>my perfect silence."</i>

513
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:39,323
<i>W.W.</i>

514
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:41,759
I mean, who do you figure
that is, you know?

515
00:46:41,794 --> 00:46:43,511
Woodrow Wilson?

516
00:46:43,545 --> 00:46:46,047
Willy Wonka?

517
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:50,635
Walter White?

518
00:46:53,305 --> 00:46:55,223
You got me.

519
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,582
