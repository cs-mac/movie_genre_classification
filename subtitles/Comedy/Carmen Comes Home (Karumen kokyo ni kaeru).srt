2
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:49,430
Father! Father!

3
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,990
Okin's letter!

4
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,140
I don't want to see it!

5
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,150
It's a nice letter.

6
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,960
A waste to send candy!

7
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
It's not that! She's coming home!

8
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,620
I'll read it.

9
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:33,900
"It's growing cooler.
Me and everybody well?"

10
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,560
A bit funny...

11
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,280
"Please don't worry about me.

12
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,880
I am lost in my art."

13
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,900
"Next month... in October,

14
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,670
our theater's closing for repairs."

15
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:02,470
"We get 6 days off, and I'd like to
go home in all my glory."

16
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,350
"You tell Father for me."

17
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,630
See, Father?

18
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,140
"I'm bringing a friend along."

19
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,180
"Please tell him not to be mad..."

20
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,130
"Forgive me for running away."

21
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,610
"Goodbye, Sister. From Lily Carmen."

22
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,990
Please be nice to her.

23
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,910
She's famous... a lot of presents.

24
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,420
Fool! No Jiji Carmen's my daughter!

25
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,680
It's not Jiji Carmen! It's Lily Carmen!

26
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,340
Father, Mother's coming.

27
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,430
What shall we answer?

28
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:12,330
It's not for me to say.

29
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,480
Don't be that way!

30
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,750
She sent that necktie!

31
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,260
You ate most of the candy, too!

32
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,510
Let's ask the principal to help us.

33
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,020
Father won't refuse, then.

34
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,900
Yes, that's a good idea!

35
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,310
She's a great artist...

36
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,610
and was born here.

37
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,560
It's the principal's duty to talk to Father.

38
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,910
Let's go.

39
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,110
What did you come for?

40
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,900
Let's go home.

41
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,330
Mr. Tagushi!

42
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,160
Wait! Wait!

43
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,820
Please stay.

44
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,930
Thanks.

45
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,070
The athletic meeting's soon.

46
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,250
Were you practicing for it?

47
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,060
Will you play something for us?

48
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,110
I can't. I don't have a harmonium
any more.

49
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,910
Why?

50
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:58,260
It's sad to be poor. Maruju took it.

51
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,840
That's downright cruel of him!

52
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,720
It can't be helped.

53
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,870
Please use ours.

54
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,280
I like your songs very much.

55
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,510
Thank you.

56
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,500
I'm a friend to art.

57
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,900
Have to protect art.

58
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,240
Japan's culture.

59
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,680
Goodbye.

60
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,520
How do you do?

61
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,160
How do you do?

62
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,060
I'll play my newest one.

63
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,030
The name's "My Sweet Home".

64
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:11,530
At the foot of Mt Asama,
is a quite little village.

65
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:20,600
And it is home to me.

66
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:29,730
The flowers, trees and birds...

67
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:38,460
Everything is full of light.

68
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,810
I don't wonder you want to cry.

69
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:49,290
Your husband came home blind.

70
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,660
So you do all the work.

71
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,380
I don't mind that.

72
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,330
But we had to give up his harmonium.

73
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,310
I intended to sell this horse.

74
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,570
But I can't work without it.

75
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,660
He said so, too.

76
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,240
Yes, you've got to eat.
Can't with just a harmonium.

77
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:19,490
Maruju's a bad fellow.

78
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,930
We shouldn't have borrowed
money to buy the harmonium.

79
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:32,120
I meant to pay it back.

80
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,440
It was cheap, so I wanted to
make him happy.

81
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,950
Work hard and
get the harmonium back.

82
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,390
You've a good work horse.

83
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,340
I thought it was sick.

84
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,410
It's fine.

85
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,760
Thank you.

86
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,850
Sho!

87
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,070
Yuki went and told him!

88
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,970
How are you?

89
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,040
What's up?

90
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,190
I hear Okin's returning.

91
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,720
It's not my concern!

92
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,820
People say you're lucky
to have a good girl.

93
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,350
She even sends you pocket money.

94
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,660
I don't ask her to... a waste to
throw it away, though.

95
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,800
Let her come if she wants to.

96
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,220
And she's a famous dancer in Tokyo,
after all.

97
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:20,210
What does Jiji Carmen mean?

98
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,920
Carmen's a famous foreign name.

99
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,770
An interesting novel.

100
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:33,890
Anyways, it's art.

101
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,040
Japan is cultural.

102
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,650
Then Okin's a culture?

103
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,960
Well, she represents it.

104
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:54,100
Even Mt. Asama's proud to
have her become great.

105
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,770
Look at that splendid sight.

106
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:05,430
Everyone must return home
with honors.

107
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:11,390
Be generous and welcome her
with a smile.

108
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,310
Mt Asama's beautiful,
no matter when we see it.

109
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:32,460
Oh, youthful love,
nurtured by Mt Asama.

110
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:53,980
All too soon it seems,
the autumn flowers bloom.

111
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,970
MARUJU EXPRESS COMPANY

112
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,550
The scenery here's nice after Tokyo.

113
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,200
Yes, it's beautiful.

114
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,560
It moves like the wind.

115
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,150
If you built a hotel here,
you'd be the village pioneer.

116
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,320
Reads and posters after that.

117
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:35,930
You'll get rich by lending money, too.

118
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,150
I'm not doing it for that!

119
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,720
No, your soul is like that cloud!

120
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,570
It's a big, floating and up high!

121
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,920
Yes, I guess that's about it.

122
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,240
Coming!

123
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,720
The principal.

124
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,410
No village headman?

125
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,890
Mr. Aoyama.

126
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,200
Where...?

127
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,180
Oh, my, Okin!

128
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,040
Hello, Sister!

129
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,960
Oh, my I'm so glad to be back!

130
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,840
When was I here last?

131
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,860
She's Okin?

132
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,490
How do you do?

133
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,260
Welcome back.

134
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,000
My friend Maja Akemi.

135
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,080
Hello

136
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,680
I'm her sister.

137
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,160
I'm Ichiro.

138
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:13,310
Okin, you've become beautiful!

139
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,720
Why, Maruju, it's been quite some time.

140
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,120
I'm Lily Carmen.

141
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,320
In place of my card.

142
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,880
Want it signed?

143
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,900
Your things?

144
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,050
Bring it.

145
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,580
Truck?

146
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,790
A wagon's better.

147
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,160
Get Omitsu.

148
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,630
Right away.

149
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,830
Mr. Principle

150
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:06,900
The bus will now pass the most
beautiful scenic spot in Japan.

151
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,860
In the distance is the Japan Alps...

152
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,160
Enough!

153
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,140
I liked being a bus girl.

154
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,820
Ladies and gentlemen, please
remember this lovely scenery.

155
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:12,010
And put it away in the memory
book of your mind...

156
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,780
Thank you very much.

157
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,710
My regards to Haruo.

158
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,790
Tell him to come and see me.

159
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,470
Here.

160
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,240
It's...

161
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,350
But Maruju...

162
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,590
Don't tell him.

163
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,630
500 yen, please. I must pay Maruju
a percentage.

164
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,340
I thought it was free.

165
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,280
It's high. Here.

166
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,760
Thanks.

167
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,550
Grandfather!

168
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,560
How nice! It's beautiful here!

169
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,640
Yes, poetic and dreamy!

170
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,450
Hurry and call Grandfather.

171
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,930
I want to run!

172
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:00,100
How wonderful! The air's sweet!

173
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,510
So beautiful! It's sad!

174
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,040
It's Father!

175
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,280
Father!

176
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,440
I'm back, Father!

177
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,920
You've come back?

178
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,520
I brought a present and some money.

179
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,950
Thanks.

180
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,760
I'm glad you're well.

181
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,760
So am I.

182
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,250
Yes, mountain air's good for us.

183
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,460
Let's have some tea.

184
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,300
I brought whisky. Let's drink it.

185
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,770
It's wonderful!

186
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,530
Let me have it!

187
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,150
Lily Carmen's an eyeful!

188
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,080
A nice belly?

189
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,130
No scars like yours!

190
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,520
She's famous in Tokyo.

191
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,030
I'll run away, too.

192
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,110
You couldn't be even a streetwalker!

193
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,710
Here they come!

194
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,890
Hello.

195
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,670
A beautiful sky.

196
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,390
A nice backdrop. Let me take you.

197
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,770
Sit down.

198
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,660
Look to one side.

199
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,270
Okin!

200
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,350
Hello.

201
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,130
Ah, lovely! Very lovely!

202
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,540
You stingy man, you!

203
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,160
Charging 500 yen! I thought it was free!

204
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,680
What are you laughing for!

205
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,160
What cute flowers!

206
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,970
Who are they?

207
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,140
Listen, it's boring here.

208
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,650
We only got here yesterday.

209
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,350
It's no fun.

210
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,940
Your father's not very sociable.

211
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,480
Country people can't talk easily.

212
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,550
Maybe I'll go home.

213
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,860
Idiot!

214
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,900
You were heart-broken!

215
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,450
That's why I brought you!

216
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,190
I want to see him again.

217
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,840
Hmph! What's good about him?

218
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:13,890
A real artists tries to get away
from men like him!

219
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,370
I'm all confused lately.

220
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,060
What?

221
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,610
About art.

222
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:25,970
You're hopeless! I'm even willing
to die for art!

223
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,600
So am I.

224
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:34,120
I guess I'm in the dumps. It tortures me.

225
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:39,210
Cheer up!

226
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,030
If you could only see me!

227
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,680
I've changed completely.

228
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,820
My wife says you're beautiful.

229
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:51,570
She did? The people all stars,
so it's very trying.

230
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,150
I can't blame them...
it's so in Tokyo, too.

231
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,930
The price of fame.

232
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,010
Nice to be so popular.

233
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,060
It's a nuisance, signing and
giving out pictures.

234
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,570
Not easy to be a dancer.

235
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,280
I'm not in a genius!

236
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:23,950
Art's very difficult. I suffer.

237
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,320
You haven't changed.

238
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,830
You may be right.

239
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,990
I always want to feel nice inside.

240
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,690
I loved you.

241
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,140
But I was afraid to send
a love letter to a teacher.

242
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,720
You're lucky you didn't marry me.

243
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,590
I'm sorry. I sympathize with you.

244
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,270
It's hard for my wife.

245
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,390
Pulling a horse like that.

246
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,760
It made me cry.

247
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,000
She's nice. Too good for me.

248
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,120
You're a lucky man!

249
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,530
Yes, I take blindness and poverty
in my stride.

250
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,380
I'm unlucky compared to you.

251
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:24,740
I may be popular,
but my art won't let me marry.

252
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,920
No boy friend?

253
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:34,840
There are a lot of men,
but they don't understand art.

254
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,290
You're lucky.

255
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,740
I guess so.

256
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,950
I've carved out my career.

257
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,140
I'll sacrifice myself to it.

258
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,940
I'm going.

259
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,320
I'm disappointed.

260
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,210
Come and see me. I've no one
to talk to except you!

261
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,950
I'm honored.

262
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,660
Want help?

263
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,330
No thanks.

264
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:19,540
You don't look like you're single. Am I?

265
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,210
Go ahead. Be frank.

266
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,440
I guess you are.

267
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,020
Teachers are naive. You're blushing.

268
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,300
You embarrass me.

269
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,410
I don't care!

270
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:41,120
Worried because of the kids!

271
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,240
Like playing at night, don't you?

272
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,620
I'm single. I'm really a bachelor girl.

273
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,720
But no one believes it.

274
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,300
Liar!

275
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,580
You wanted to see him!

276
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,370
It's not so! She's lying!

277
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,990
Let's go!

278
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,860
I'll come tomorrow!

279
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,440
What'd you talk about?

280
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,290
She was bullying me.

281
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,830
What's the matter?

282
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,280
A big headache.

283
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,670
A fever?

284
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,090
It's not that.

285
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,500
Tell them not to wear dresses like that.

286
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,850
Why, Father?

287
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,790
When I think they're walking around
showing their legs...

288
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:28,910
I feel ashamed!

289
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,200
You don't know, Father.
They're fancy clothes in Tokyo.

290
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,850
Maybe so, but exposing themselves...

291
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:45,390
Livestock can go around naked.

292
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:49,440
But what about her picture?

293
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:54,520
It embarrasses me, but it's for her art.

294
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:02,120
If that's art, I'd rather look at
horses and pigs!

295
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,630
That tree makes me remember...

296
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,280
when Okin was kicked by a cow.

297
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,490
I remember.

298
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:26,760
She was knocked over
and frothing when I came.

299
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,440
Seems it made her head funny.

300
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,680
You may be right.

301
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,170
Father, we're back!

302
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,280
I'm going!

303
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,820
Back, are you?

304
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,640
ATHLETIC MEETING

305
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,170
Don't lose!

306
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,560
Behave today.

307
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,970
You behave. Before Mr. Ogawa, anyway.

308
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,910
You're vulgar.

309
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:39,060
My skirt keeps falling down.

310
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,910
Isn't it nice?

311
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,320
Excuse me. Excuse me.

312
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:19,400
He understands music, too.
Let's go over.

313
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,820
My sister's here!

314
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,930
She's lovely.

315
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,510
Okin came!

316
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,220
The artiste?

317
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,060
You're so right, she's Carmen!

318
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,840
See her dress.

319
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,590
Very good.

320
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,760
Please relax and listen.

321
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,440
Stop, stop! No. 2!

322
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,370
Staring at me.

323
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,260
Take a bow.

324
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,530
But...

325
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,730
You owe it to them.

326
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,540
That's enough.

327
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,840
That's enough!

328
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,550
I see.

329
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:19,710
Next on the program is
a special number by Mr. Taguchi.

330
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,220
The principal would like to
say a few words.

331
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:31,760
We would like you to listen to
Mr. Taguchi's new composition.

332
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:51,010
The song will move you.

333
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:57,030
It is a marvelous piece of art.

334
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:06,670
I am very happy that a man
from our village composed it.

335
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:16,260
I'm sure we'll all be proud of it.

336
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:23,760
On this beautiful autumn day...

337
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:33,950
I'd like to listen to this work of art
with you.

338
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,700
And I'd like to listen to it, too.

339
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:45,480
It's not only a great pleasure to me...

340
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:52,210
I am sure that Mt Asama's
very proud of him, too!

341
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:11,540
That's my harmonium.
It's a very fine one.

342
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:15,290
Please begin.

343
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,270
It's the harmonium we had.

344
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,390
What is it?

345
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,400
He grabbed my hand!

346
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,980
You're wrong!

347
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:42,320
Let's go!

348
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,070
But, we...

349
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,550
Please wait!

350
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,400
I'm going!

351
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,130
They didn't laugh at you!

352
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:04,630
Please be quiet, everyone!
Quiet, please!

353
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,660
I'm sorry about this! I apologize!

354
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:15,200
I apologize, so please play again!

355
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,840
I ask you to.

356
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:31,630
Don't be offended and play again.

357
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,530
I ask you to leave.

358
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,600
We're not to blame!

359
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:38,650
Anyway, go home!

360
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:45,280
All right, we'll go!

361
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,390
I'm awfully sorry!

362
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,370
Idiot! Idiot!

363
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,880
What's funny?

364
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,690
I'm sorry, but I can't play today.

365
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,150
I'm going.

366
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,230
No wonder. Art's a delicate feeling.

367
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,220
It's not that.

368
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:42,360
Come again when you feel better.

369
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:46,060
I'm sorry I bothered you.

370
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,620
You've no luck with that harmonium.

371
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:40,210
Let's go back to Tokyo.

372
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,450
Mr. Ogawa?

373
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:44,620
I'll give him up.

374
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:46,700
You don't care?

375
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,680
I'm not going yet.

376
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:53,490
But we can't even run around here.

377
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:59,080
And your father's got a fever.

378
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,540
That's why I can't go!

379
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,820
I don't run after an insult!

380
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,740
I came to be honored!

381
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,990
Can't even wear my borrowed dresses!

382
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:17,270
Maruju's bad.

383
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,480
He just held your hand!

384
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,960
I like Mr. Ogawa, so I don't want
others to touch me!

385
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,830
Acting so pure!

386
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:34,460
Wish I could see him.
No school today... what's he doing?

387
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:37,940
Go and see him!

388
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,940
Don't!

389
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,900
I've got a plan!

390
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,720
Let's do a show! That'll surprises them!

391
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,510
It sure will.

392
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:56,390
We'll show them our art and...

393
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:59,530
make up for yesterday!

394
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,750
It's popular in Tokyo,
so it'll wow them!

395
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,080
Costume...?

396
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,290
A handkerchief's enough.

397
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,660
What'll Mr. Ogawa say?

398
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,310
He'll be glad. All men like it.

399
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,920
Will he understand it?

400
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,220
What?

401
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,460
A country teacher's...

402
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:21,470
I'll guarantee it.

403
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,250
He's a bachelor! He'll love it!

404
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:27,090
Hook him then.

405
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,400
Let's, then!

406
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,830
All right! Settled!

407
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,910
Let's go!

408
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:07,550
You can draw below!

409
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,640
My son saw them!

410
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:40,790
Without a stitch on.
It was something to see!

411
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:41,920
Let's go.

412
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,830
It's too late!

413
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,540
Like to see it.

414
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:52,290
Art's terrific. You know,
those sculptures? It's like that.

415
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,490
I'm going to Tokyo.

416
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,640
I'll dance for you!

417
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,880
I'd like to see it!

418
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,160
See a good show at the farm?

419
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:05,670
I'm telling them.

420
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,970
A sensation.

421
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,160
I'd like to see it.

422
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,350
It may mean more money than a hotel.

423
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:25,430
We'll have them dance.
You go and ask!

424
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:29,810
You bet! A fortune in show business!

425
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,220
You'll get rich.

426
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,360
No, it's to introduce art. Go on!

427
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,340
Sure, by horse!

428
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,760
But the old man's got a fever even now.

429
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,780
Why can't we? I'll give him the money!
I'm a good girl!

430
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:01,240
Certainly.

431
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,590
He gets mad even if
we stretch our legs.

432
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,040
He's too old.

433
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,070
Certainly.

434
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,420
Art's misunderstood.

435
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,730
I'll fight.

436
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,910
Have to for art.

437
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,750
Yes, yes.

438
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,990
You're right.

439
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,030
You understand? It's hard to.

440
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,770
A little.

441
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,710
It has to be tomorrow.

442
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:36,730
Very well, we'll play it up.

443
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:39,000
We'll go later.

444
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,710
We'll be waiting.

445
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,840
Find some curtains for costumes.

446
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:31,110
Okin's dancing tonight.

447
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,350
You can go if you want to.

448
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,800
It's a nude show.

449
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,550
That's what they were excited about?

450
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,030
How'll her father feel
if he sees the posters?

451
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:51,940
She's not bright, she'll do anything.

452
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:55,560
I wonder. She likes you.

453
00:56:55,850 --> 00:57:00,830
She used to wait for me after school.

454
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,450
Wasn't it pleasant?

455
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:06,790
A pleasant memory now.

456
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:10,030
I've fewer memories than others.

457
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:18,200
And the fewest of me.

458
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:23,210
Married a year, then the war.

459
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,360
I haven't seen since.

460
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,870
But that one year has remained
in my mind.

461
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,700
Your songs show it.

462
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,780
The blind can see well.

463
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,490
If I were a composer,
I'd compose a lot.

464
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:42,480
You are.

465
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,090
No harmonium but you're an artist.

466
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,300
Okin's artist enough.

467
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,440
It's the principal.

468
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:03,570
How do you do?

469
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,410
Together?

470
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,500
We'd like to borrow your harmonium.

471
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,970
I see. I'm going to the farm.

472
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:14,310
See the poster?

473
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,480
Okin's dance poster?

474
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:21,690
It's the limit! It'll poison the villagers!

475
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:27,750
It's the limit!
A big rock in the middle of the road!

476
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,020
Poison for people who see.

477
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:40,700
They like it.

478
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,080
Father!

479
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,400
I'm afraid I made a big mistake.

480
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,430
I must apologize.

481
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:18,880
Why? I haven't done anything that great.

482
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,760
I'm ashamed of myself.

483
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,240
Okin shouldn't have come.

484
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,450
What'd she do now?

485
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:35,410
I'm an educator.
I can't keep quiet this time.

486
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,960
He just got up today.

487
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,740
Go on. She's my responsibility.

488
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,140
I'm responsible, too.

489
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:53,900
It was a mistake to be glad
without knowing.

490
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:56,550
Not here?

491
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,970
At the water trough.

492
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,420
I see. I'll go and see her.

493
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:07,810
Principal, did she steal or something?

494
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,580
Of course not.

495
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,820
Then tell me. I'm beyond surprise.

496
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:16,740
Okin's dancing tonight.

497
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,920
A nude show.

498
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,870
Father!

499
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:27,240
It's sensational.

500
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:32,990
The admission's 100 yen.
Probably Maruju's idea.

501
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:40,760
It's not only bad for the young men
but for the children, too!

502
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:44,600
I'm determined to stop it.

503
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,500
I'll see her.

504
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,350
I will, too!

505
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:13,860
They're practicing.

506
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:18,140
No wonder our bucket's gone!

507
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,780
It's crazy!

508
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:04,290
Please wait!

509
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:13,850
I don't want to see her shameful act!

510
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:16,690
Don't you, either!

511
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:31,350
I'll tell you the truth!

512
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,590
I love her the best!

513
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:40,780
She ran away to Tokyo,

514
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:43,960
but she's weak in the head.

515
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:48,260
So she can't get along decently.

516
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:51,070
I don't know what's she's doing...

517
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:54,380
but it's not respectable work.

518
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:03,880
It may be art or culture.

519
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,960
But how can I be happy
when she's not even married?

520
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,670
I love and hate her and,
at the same time, she worries me sick.

521
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:18,820
It's been a long time,
so I wanted to see her.

522
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:24,180
Still I was afraid of what she'd done.

523
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:27,930
But she's back now!

524
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:34,850
Let's let her dance if she wants to!

525
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:36,820
Let's her be laughed at!

526
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:39,470
I'm unlucky to be her father.

527
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:44,850
She was unlucky to be kicked by a cow.

528
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:47,860
Let them laughed at me, too!

529
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:51,510
Let them all laugh!

530
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:59,540
If her dances are bad,

531
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:04,140
let the government put a stop to them!

532
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:09,560
If it's all right in Tokyo, it's all right here!

533
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:16,180
It must be art!

534
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:22,770
You win today!

535
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:26,190
I don't know what to say!

536
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:31,810
She has the right to dance
if she wants to!

537
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:39,230
Even cycle races are authorized!

538
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:43,600
Maruju chose the lesser of the two evils.

539
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:47,450
No, I've got something to say to him!

540
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,720
I'll go and see him!

541
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,280
Don't tell Okin.

542
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:58,750
I'm going, too!

543
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,100
Don't waste money! It's only tonight!

544
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:18,320
The front row for reserved seats.

545
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:22,630
It'll be worth paying for them.

546
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:24,570
Sure.

547
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,390
Well, well!

548
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,660
A lot of time yet.

549
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,460
A fine way to make money.

550
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:47,020
I'm doing it for our villages.

551
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:51,220
For its culture, you might say.

552
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:56,580
No progress if we're insensible to art.

553
01:05:56,810 --> 01:06:00,490
"Keep up with the times" is my motto.

554
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,680
Stop your smooth talk!

555
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:06,680
I'm her father, so I know!

556
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:11,830
At the tail end of her class,
runny nose till 18!

557
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,160
How could she know art?

558
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:19,050
You just want fun at her expense!

559
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:22,720
You're wrong. She's Lily Carmen.

560
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:25,370
You really think so?

561
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:27,140
Sure I do.

562
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,750
I hate liars!

563
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:33,960
You talk of culture and the village...

564
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:35,940
but you're after money!

565
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:38,440
Acting like a Diet member!

566
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,350
Shut up!

567
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:40,860
There's more!

568
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:45,700
I've been wanting to say so, too!

569
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:50,080
But it seemed rather childish!

570
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:54,860
Still, if a good man like him is angry,

571
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:59,210
it's time I am, too!

572
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:04,990
You took away a blind man's
only pleasure!

573
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:11,790
So how can you now about culture
or helping others!

574
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,090
Poor boy, he takes his father to...

575
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:19,070
play the harmonium!

576
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:22,650
I thought you a devil to do that.

577
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:26,930
Only a devil could!

578
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:41,380
What happened?

579
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:46,540
I heard you were here. I was worried.

580
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:52,090
Look at him! And at me!

581
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:57,300
A principal using violence!

582
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:03,390
But I'm not sorry! Mt Asama knows!

583
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:35,730
I'm sorry, but I don't want to see Okin.

584
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:42,110
She's leaving tomorrow
but I won't see her.

585
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:45,090
May I stay the night?

586
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:51,210
Of course. I don't feel
any too good either.

587
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:55,620
Come along and drink with us.

588
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:59,670
Listen to my Asama song.

589
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,730
Father!

590
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:41,280
Look here, Naokichi, get off!

591
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:51,280
Say, hurry up and open the curtains!

592
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,320
Sorry to keep you waiting.

593
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:04,720
The show's about to begin.

594
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:10,500
You will be treated to a great art
of sublime beauty...

595
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:17,160
The dances of Lily Carmen
and Maja Akemi!

596
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,630
Hurry up!

597
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:32,970
Maruju has brought the band
all the way from Karuizawa.

598
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:41,700
The Cupid Band will delight you
with their playing.

599
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:54,070
The show will now begin.

600
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:14,920
We will first play a number from
the great Schubert!

601
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:54,650
Principal, when I think she's naked
there before the others...

602
01:15:55,420 --> 01:16:02,180
I'm more ashamed than
if I'd danced naked.

603
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:05,490
I know, I know.

604
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:09,770
Only human beings know shame.

605
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:14,320
It's a noble feeling.

606
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:30,770
Please pour me some more.

607
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:37,460
Drink a lot and pass out!

608
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,610
Keep bringing the sake!

609
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,910
She went to buy something.

610
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:46,210
I see.

611
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:56,530
Drink up, Sho.
The moon seems to be out.

612
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,340
Mt Asama must be beautiful.

613
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,180
I don't think Father will take that money.

614
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:09,520
He will. Everyone likes money.

615
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:12,230
I don't, of course.

616
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:15,250
You take it if he won't.

617
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:16,920
Really?

618
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:18,950
Yes, but send me half, then.

619
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:20,420
I will.

620
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:23,570
Should've brought half.

621
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,250
Father may take it.

622
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,510
He might.

623
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:29,660
I'm so glad!

624
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:35,050
He's giving Father the money by now.

625
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:39,130
I hope he refuses.

626
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:44,280
Father's funny.
He didn't even see me off.

627
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,620
I wanted to see Mr. Ogawa, too.

628
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,760
My regards to him.

629
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,340
Say I was sad.

630
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,240
Yes, tactfully.

631
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:12,290
Hello, there... thanks for last night.

632
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,060
Very popular.

633
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:15,800
Did they understand?

634
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,520
Yes, all of it.

635
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,160
I made a lot of money.

636
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:24,710
I got treated to a drink.

637
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:28,180
It'll help my cultural work.

638
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:39,080
You listen, too. Oyuki.

639
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,990
It had slipped my mind...

640
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:43,860
Take the harmonium.
My kids are tired of it.

641
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:45,130
That harmonium?

642
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:48,750
You'll need it for the new hotel!

643
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:50,430
That's so...

644
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:56,840
Never mind, though. I'm generous.
Take it with you.

645
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,280
You mean it?

646
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,400
I hate lies!

647
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,270
Tell your father so.

648
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:08,610
Say I returned it.

649
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:09,950
Made money, that's why.

650
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:13,030
I can't rob a blind man!

651
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:16,350
His debt can wait.

652
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,980
You tell the principal!

653
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:26,610
Say I returned it to make up
for the athletic meet!

654
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,100
For free!

655
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:35,400
How very generous.

656
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:41,110
Hurry before he changes his mind!

657
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:43,360
He's like that cloud!

658
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,630
Hurry!

659
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,290
It may be dirty money,
but my girl earned it.

660
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:41,350
If you use it, her dancing
will be of some use.

661
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,250
Please take it.

662
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:48,530
I see. I gladly accept it.

663
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:52,910
We'll make good use of it.

664
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:57,760
And try to give everyone
an artist education.

665
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,480
Thank you very much.

666
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:04,890
Mr. Taguchi of this village, too.

667
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:10,700
People like him would make Japan
very beautiful.

668
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:15,420
Let's use some of this to pay his debts.

669
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:17,330
That's fine.

670
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:20,880
He's coming to teach a song,
this morning.

671
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,280
I'm relieved.

672
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:31,550
She's a fool, but she did
some good here.

673
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:41,680
Come again, Okin!

674
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,960
The idiots!

675
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:06,950
There go the nudes!

676
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:11,870
You were nice last night! Come again!

677
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:33,510
I'm glad I came!

678
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:36,390
The people are cute.

679
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:39,460
I want to eat noodles!
