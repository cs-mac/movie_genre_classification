2
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,682
Morning Doctor - Morning

3
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,605
Daughter is better, Panicker?

4
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,523
No Sir

5
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,190
No?

6
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,316
No, not at all...

7
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,320
Now they are saying she
needs to wear a brace on her back

8
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,113
They are right, you know...

9
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,324
Better than having an operation...

10
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:47,079
Surgery carries a risk of
vertebral canal stenosis

11
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,497
All in God's hands, Sir

12
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,124
She will be alright... don't worry

13
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,753
Sir hasn't come yet...

14
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,463
Sorry Ma'am...

15
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:57,798
Yes Ma'am...

16
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,132
Coffee Ma'am!

17
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,300
So sweet of you, Sir

18
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,426
You work too hard...

19
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,678
Good Morning Sir - Sorry Ma'am

20
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,098
Good morning Ann.

21
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,391
Good morning.

22
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,101
Hovv are the Vitals?

23
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,520
BP is back to 120/80...

24
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,188
Temperature 98.2...

25
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:14,648
Can I have a look?

26
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,358
Thanks

27
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,486
That means the fever
last night

28
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,029
was an anomaly...

29
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,657
...we should do the
blood test anyway...

30
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,617
Yes, I have informed the lab...

31
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,203
I will have to check
on another patient...

32
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:28,996
will you take over?

33
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,038
Yes, yes sure...

34
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,165
Thank you, Uncle... I will see you.

35
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:44,636
So?

36
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,681
Hovv is my favourite wife?

37
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,197
There's a cramp in your gut

38
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,240
Yet you mouth off a lame excuse

39
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,366
You hide the sanitary napkin

40
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,285
From the male gaze

41
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,536
Oh, why should we hide?

42
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,038
Will you shed the old ways please!

43
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,122
Be free!

44
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,707
Be free!

45
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,126
Those four days of the month

46
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,586
When you feel that little stir

47
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,254
Drop the damn secret

48
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,131
All that blood is Mother Nature

49
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,716
Drop the black bag around your

50
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,051
Pack of Sanitary

51
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:24,718
Be Free!

52
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,512
Be Free!

53
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:30,682
So?

54
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,226
Nice

55
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,143
Yeah?

56
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:33,685
It's Good.

57
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:34,436
You like it?

58
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,064
Cool!

59
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:38,440
Really

60
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,033
Thank You!

61
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,284
Hadn't taken a shower anyway!

62
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,702
You pricks!

63
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,539
Can't you think beyond
your stupid spoofs...

64
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,376
You know,
I have achieved something in my life

65
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,128
At least I am using
the power of social media...

66
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,005
...to create something meaningful

67
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,298
The brand wins, we win.

68
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,425
We create a revolution...

69
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,219
We are the fucking new wave man!

70
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,471
The new wave of

71
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,265
sanitary napkins!

72
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,308
Hi, I am Lokesh

73
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,601
and I am a feminist!

74
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,106
Pricks!

75
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,692
And I thought you had
bunked work again today...

76
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,110
Mrs. Deshpande?

77
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,028
Yes?

78
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,614
Ma'am, I am Bharat Saxena...

79
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:28,615
I am from SciTech

80
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,242
Guys, will you shut up please...

81
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,578
From your husband's office...?

82
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,962
Ma'am, this is your
Ivlumbai to Cochin ticket...

83
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,298
We have kept the return
tickets open for now...

84
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,719
I'm sure he's going
to be okay Ma'am...

85
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,765
Listen, help me atleast a bit?!

86
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,517
I'm doing all the packing!

87
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,021
Fucking sucks, man.

88
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,356
They like just got married!

89
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,194
Do you think we should go with her?

90
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,363
I fucking hate hospitals!

91
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:14,328
I think we should inform
Tara's parents, no?

92
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,371
They don't talk to each other

93
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,499
Both their parents
were against their wedding

94
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,002
Seriously?

95
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,213
What a 70's show man!
They look so posh.

96
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,714
Just shut the fuck up!

97
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,300
Just saying...

98
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:36,141
I can't stop yapping
until I get some food into me...

99
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,353
You know in these flights...

100
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:43,273
...you have to choose your food
options at the time of booking itself...

101
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,692
Vegetarian or Non
Vegetarian etc etc...

102
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,611
Now what will you do?

103
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,071
Ask the Air Hostess...

104
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,365
...if she has any spare packets
of banana chips or something...

105
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:16,974
Excuse me...

106
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,977
My husband, Rajat Deshpande?

107
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,061
One minute...

108
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,314
Ma'am your husband is
in the ICU right now...

109
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,192
I don't have any
more details here...

110
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,070
Go straight.
Take the lift to the fourth floor

111
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,239
Take the right and
then go straight again

112
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,271
Oh sorry, sorry... sit down.

113
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,731
Let's go to another room...

114
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:31,507
Mrs. Deshpande?

115
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,717
Yes, yes Doctor?

116
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,427
No!

117
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,013
Myself Girish from SciTech.

118
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:38,805
From the local branch...

119
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,310
Company people told
me to see that you are okay...

120
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,355
I'm sorry I didn't see you
coming,

121
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,607
so I went to take dinner...

122
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,580
Doctor will be here
any minute Ma'am...

123
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,459
Don't worry... this
is a top class hospital...

124
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,295
All foreigners are
coming here for treatment...

125
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,090
...and we have also
booked your hotel,

126
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,633
just opposite the hospital...

127
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:19,680
Mrs. Sampath?

128
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,431
No! Mrs. Deshpande!

129
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,391
Oh Sorry...

130
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,017
No wait... are you the Doctor?

131
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:24,434
Yeah...

132
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,186
Yeah... I need to see my husband

133
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,187
The nurse will be here...

134
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,523
No, I need to see
my husband now!

135
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,691
Please!

136
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,359
Your husband... what's his name?

137
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,735
Rajat Deshpande...

138
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:34,486
Rajat...

139
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:35,362
Deshpande...

140
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,114
And which one is he? Bed number...?

141
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:37,698
I don't know...

142
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:38,782
Bed number 8!

143
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:39,783
Bed Number 8...

144
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,626
Ma'am... just have a seat...

145
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,591
I am Dr. Vishvvanath...

146
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,510
Your husband is not my patient...

147
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,429
I'm just on call here for tonight...

148
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,016
Hovv much do you know
about his situation?

149
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:04,725
Nothing!

150
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,144
I have been
sitting here like an idiot!

151
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,313
Actually Rajat sir
was in an accident...

152
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,606
Truck hit his car...

153
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,107
and his head was smashed...

154
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:13,400
Okay... okay...

155
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,695
Mrs. Deshpande...

156
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,238
according to the note here...

157
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,491
...he was in some kind of
RTA... the front seat passenger

158
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,119
I think they had to
cut him out of the car...

159
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,120
Oh God!

160
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,122
When he reached here...

161
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,458
he had a severe head injury

162
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,045
Frontal and temporal
skull fractures,

163
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,421
significant bleeding...

164
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,758
He's on a breathing machine...

165
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,136
We'll know more about
his prognosis

166
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,179
in 48 hours...

167
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,723
Will he be okay?

168
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,227
Ma'am your own doctor will
talk to you in the morning...

169
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,603
I want to see him

170
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,730
That I will have to check

171
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,023
Check?

172
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,108
Check with bloody whom ya?!

173
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,445
I have every right to see my
husband. He is my husband okay!

174
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,154
Ma'am calm down...

175
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,073
No, I won't calm down!

176
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:06,245
Who is the fucking boss of
this place and who can I speak to?

177
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,288
Hovv can I see my own husband?!

178
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,007
Hello

179
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,467
I'm Rajat Deshpande
and I offer deep apologies...

180
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,471
...for not answering your
phone just now because I am...

181
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,140
busy!

182
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:12,102
Please leave a message after the sound
of this ceremonial Buddhist gong...

183
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,588
Can I sit here?

184
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,009
Yes.

185
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,025
First 48 hours are hard

186
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,571
Very hard

187
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,156
Yeah

188
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:10,369
I saw you outside the ICU

189
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:15,082
Shouting at Dr. Vishvvanath...

190
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,419
Your husband? Car accident?

191
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,006
Brain injury?

192
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,299
YUP

193
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,263
Brain injury is tough...

194
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:36,270
But survival chances are
better with young, healthy patients

195
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,606
So, my husband is going to be okay,
right Doctor?

196
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,358
No... No!

197
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,278
I mean, I am not a Doctor

198
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:45,529
Oh...

199
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,115
My wife is here...

200
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,660
She has been in a coma
for last eight months

201
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,120
Shit!

202
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,715
So... have you met your doctor yet?

203
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,260
No... they said...

204
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,179
only after the
morning ward rounds...

205
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,638
Famous morning ward rounds!

206
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,266
First they will tell
you to see them at sharp 9 am

207
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,685
But you won't see
their faces till 11 am

208
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,647
And then of course,
comes their great dialogue...

209
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,483
'The ne><t 48 hours will be crucial'

210
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,361
Yeah... that Vishwanath
guy... he already said that...

211
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,489
They say it to each other I think...

212
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,742
They all just ape each other

213
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,166
So what am I supposed to do now?

214
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,505
You do what we all do

215
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,299
Wait!

216
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:50,302
Wait!

217
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,469
Your husband has had
a serious head injury...

218
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,595
He has a fractured shoulder...

219
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,264
and three broken ribs...

220
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,975
...but, it's the brain
injury that is most dangerous...

221
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,604
We shouldn't raise
our expectations too much

222
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,398
Because in most cases like this

223
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,441
chances of a complete revival are...

224
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,609
...slim at the best

225
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,071
We are getting a new scan today

226
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,656
to see hovv things are progressing...

227
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,076
But we need to wait
for the full result of that

228
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,245
In the meanwhile,

229
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,247
the first 48 hours
are going to be crucial

230
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,291
ls Rajat going to die?

231
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,710
We will do our best to
make sure that he doesn't

232
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:10,716
Mrs. Deshpande, I think you should
call your friends or family over...

233
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,011
You need all the support you can get

234
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,352
And if you want to talk to me,

235
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:23,979
you are most welcome at any time

236
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,288
Yeah Sonal...

237
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,664
"You are okay with
lentils tonight right?"

238
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,584
No man, not that lentil
curry again please.

239
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:55,552
Everything alright?

240
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,144
Come on. Eat something.

241
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,064
Eating,

242
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,190
sleepinQ

243
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,274
and bathing

244
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,484
These three things should never stop

245
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:12,402
If you stop these then...

246
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,154
everything will come to a stop...

247
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:15,989
Come on

248
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,243
This ldli is not as bad as it looks!

249
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:22,454
What's your name?

250
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,082
Shiv Natraj...

251
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,543
But after living in the South
for over three decades now...

252
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,670
...it has become 'Shiva Natraja'!

253
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,089
I don't mind though...

254
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:33,966
I'm Tara.

255
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,008
Huh?

256
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,469
Tara... Kapoor

257
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,348
Well, Deshapande, recently

258
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,642
Tara Deshpande.

259
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,310
Here, keep that!

260
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:47,187
Drugs?

261
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,398
Sleeping pills!

262
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,316
They are perfectly harmless.

263
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,526
Just take one in the night

264
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,070
So I should just pop a pill

265
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,031
and doze off happily
while Rajat is in the ICU?!

266
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,325
I can't

267
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:01,451
Look!

268
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,246
While Rajat is in the ICU

269
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,373
the nurses are looking
after him, not you

270
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:12,004
When he comes out of it, is when he
will be needing your ma><imum support...

271
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,715
You must look after yourself...

272
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:16,633
Looking after yourself

273
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:19,094
is looking after Rajat.

274
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,015
You make it sound like

275
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,683
it's an Alcoholics Anonymous Meeting

276
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,602
Not so different actually...

277
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,230
Here come...

278
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,317
Come on. You must eat.

279
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:30,457
Good Evening Ma'am

280
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,167
So sorry to disturb you...

281
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,046
Company people told me
to give your husband's luggage...

282
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:38,674
Police sent to the office

283
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,052
Anything you need Ma'am?

284
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,513
You do know you can
order room service here, right?

285
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,183
Ma'am, if you need anything...

286
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,268
please call me...

287
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:16,021
Mollakutty, Good morning. Coffee...

288
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,272
Thank You

289
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:25,572
Tara?

290
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:26,615
Shiv!

291
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:28,742
I need your help

292
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:49,638
Omon say something!

293
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,266
I don't know about all these things...

294
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:53,392
What do you mean, 'all these things'?

295
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,810
It's obvious. They are doing it!

296
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,602
Doing what?

297
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:56,520
Oh!

298
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,648
'Can't wait to see you!'

299
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:01,525
'We are so good together'

300
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:02,651
'Keep the champagne chilled baby'

301
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,278
Champagne... yeah I read that...

302
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,446
Hovv many messages in two days?!

303
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:08,657
32!

304
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,493
I know it.
He came to Cochin just to meet her

305
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:13,412
This pitch business
was just an e><cuse!

306
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,665
Look, maybe you are over-reacting.

307
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:19,376
Perhaps they are just good friends...

308
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:20,460
'Good friends'?

309
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,546
Yeah right! If she were
really such a good friend...

310
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:23,755
...then hovv come she did
not attend our wedding...

311
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:25,090
this bitch!

312
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,009
So why don't you call her?

313
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:27,759
Just call her!

314
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,344
Who, this Sheetal bitch?

315
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:30,387
And what would I say?

316
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:33,098
Hey hi, lam the wife of
the guy you are trying to screw!

317
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,142
But you know what,
he is in the coma at the moment...

318
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,685
...so now, forget about it!

319
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:42,316
Look, you just delete
these messages...

320
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:43,984
I know who to ask...

321
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,110
give me this!

322
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,325
Is that a yes or a no?

323
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,244
Oh yes, yes Ma'am, I know Sheetal...

324
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,246
And were Sheetal
and my husband close?

325
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:57,247
Oh yes!

326
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:58,290
Very close

327
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,585
They were working on
this pitch together right?

328
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,420
So talking,

329
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:04,171
chatting,

330
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:05,005
drinking...

331
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,340
Sleeping. ...?

332
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:09,510
Sorry?

333
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,595
Was Sheetal fucking my husband?

334
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:17,684
Yes or No?

335
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:21,188
I will just...

336
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,025
What are you doing...

337
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,110
...give me this!

338
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,989
Sheetal Sir!

339
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,368
He was Rajat sir's tech partner

340
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:36,995
Oh!

341
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:41,625
Mefam!

342
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:50,008
Ma'am we are all
praying in the office...

343
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,135
We are holding a prayer
meeting tomorrow...

344
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,220
I'm an atheist

345
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:55,430
No Problem...

346
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,099
we will pray for you Ma'am

347
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:21,498
Sheetal is a man!

348
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,752
Yeah, I heard...

349
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:28,589
And he has a big beard too.

350
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:38,265
I am such an asshole.

351
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:40,392
Iam a dick! I am a dick!

352
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:44,438
You know Pankaja... if
we ever had children...

353
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:49,443
...perhaps it would be as difficult
to understand them as this girl...

354
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:54,489
Today's generation...

355
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:57,534
they are just incredible...

356
00:26:57,993 --> 00:26:59,578
They just blurt out anything
that crosses their mind...

357
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,499
Yes, I did say once,

358
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,543
that they are more evolved than us...

359
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:11,131
They understand the world better than
us, they are better informed etc etc

360
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:16,136
But they lack any grace or dignity

361
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:19,681
You can't just vomit out

362
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:21,308
anything that comes into your head

363
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,644
It's quite embarrassing!

364
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:26,313
Yes, okay

365
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:29,399
I will stay away from her

366
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,237
Too much drama anyway.

367
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:56,593
You can't just walk
in here like this Ma'am!

368
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,345
I have to change his IV

369
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,098
Please go and wait
in the waiting room

370
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:16,405
Baboon!

371
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,531
Where the hell have you reached?

372
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:20,033
You are not answering your phone
and Rajafs is switched off too!

373
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,368
Everyone's here.

374
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,536
I have served the starters already...

375
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,162
Where are you Tara?

376
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:28,584
Ish. Rajat has been in an accident...

377
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,043
It's really nice. Just have a sip

378
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:31,295
Accident?

379
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:33,005
What are you saying?

380
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:33,630
Who?

381
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:34,631
He is okay right?

382
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:37,342
He is in a hospital here in Cochin

383
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:38,635
In Cochin?

384
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,345
Rajat?

385
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,723
He has had a severe head injury.

386
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:44,683
He is in a coma.

387
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:46,435
Coma?

388
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:50,564
Listen I'm coming there right away...

389
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:53,317
I'll take the first flight in the
morning and I'll be there okay...

390
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,568
I have to leave for San
Francisco in the morning...

391
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,988
Shit. Tara, Dileep has a flight to San
Francisco, in the morning tomorrow...

392
00:28:58,322 --> 00:28:59,489
Tell her, I'm calling
my Cochin office right now...

393
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,450
Dileep is calling
his Cochin office Tara...

394
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,493
Ish! - I will call
Pushkar and ask for...

395
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:04,453
I think

396
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,079
Rajat is going to die

397
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,415
No, my Tara. My love

398
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:11,418
Only positive thoughts, okay

399
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,712
Listen. You just...

400
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,380
you just start chanting okay?

401
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:17,925
You saw it right

402
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:20,511
you know hovv much it
helped me when I was pregnant

403
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:23,555
And I'm going to start chanting
for Rajat right away... okay...

404
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:24,598
Everything is...

405
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:11,747
Good evening Uncle

406
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,207
Oh... Good evening...

407
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,750
Madam has sent tiffin...

408
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:17,669
Thank you! Thank you!

409
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:18,712
Your Madam

410
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:20,631
is very kind

411
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,092
I'm getting fat

412
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:26,553
Uncle. Old tiffin boxes?

413
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:28,263
Oh yes! I will just get it...

414
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:30,015
And also, hovv is Aunty?

415
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:30,724
Aunty is fine.

416
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:33,185
She will be home soon.

417
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:34,394
Doctors are very happy...

418
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:01,547
Uncle!

419
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:04,258
Doctor Nirupam wants
to talk to you...

420
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,009
I can't deal with his negativity

421
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:08,136
What Uncle...

422
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,025
Good afternoon Sir

423
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:23,318
Tara Deshpande?

424
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,319
One second sir..

425
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:47,634
Is everything okay?

426
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,387
Just shut the door and come in.

427
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:04,610
You are feeling alright?

428
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,112
No!

429
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,322
What happened?

430
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:10,365
Nothing happened

431
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,079
Why are you still in bed?

432
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:20,209
Come on get up.

433
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:22,503
Your phone is ringing...

434
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,637
You are in a really bad mood today

435
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,681
Lokesh.

436
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:36,642
31 calls.

437
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:39,728
Seems really determined
to speak to you.

438
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,355
Fuck that Lokesh!

439
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:42,523
Fuck all of them!

440
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:45,734
You know when that CHOIVIU
was down with jaundice...

441
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:48,779
It was me who was up all night,
taking him to the hospital.

442
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:50,572
...cleaning his puke...

443
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:52,699
hovv he used to call me his soulmate,
that ass!

444
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:56,537
And Ish! My best bloody friend!

445
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:58,038
At the time of her wedding,

446
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,248
you know I was the
only one supporting her...

447
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:01,333
...helping her tide through...

448
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,461
her relationship problems, her OCD...

449
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:06,672
...and now she is fobbing me off

450
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:09,383
with some 'Stay Positive' shit!

451
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:12,553
The ne><t time someone
tells me to stay...

452
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:14,346
fucking positive, I will...

453
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:16,431
Do you know Shiv

454
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:18,433
hovv many friends
I have on my Facebook?

455
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:21,186
1457!

456
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:26,108
And I get 250 'Likes'
on some random jackass selfie!

457
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:28,652
And do you know hovv many
followers I have on Twitter!

458
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:30,279
5,800!

459
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:32,114
And hovv many of them
are here right now?

460
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:32,698
Zero!

461
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,533
What is Twitter?

462
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:37,578
Twitter. ...?

463
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:40,539
It's like this... thing...

464
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:42,124
It's like this... notice board...

465
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:43,250
E><cept that it is online

466
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,002
and open to the public...

467
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:49,089
So you can just write
any shit on it...

468
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:53,468
And then other people
write back some comments...

469
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:54,761
...and sometime shitty things too!

470
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:58,015
Well, the basic idea is to get
more and more people

471
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,141
to follow you

472
00:34:59,183 --> 00:34:59,641
Ya?

473
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,976
Ya.

474
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:02,561
What is the point?

475
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:07,024
I don't know what is the point...

476
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,488
Shiv...

477
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:17,492
I want to tell you something

478
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:21,121
I haven't told about
Rajat to my parents yet...

479
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:23,415
And neither to Rajafs mom...

480
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,709
The thing is that she is so much
into Astrology and all that shit...

481
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,711
I know she hates me already

482
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,630
She will blame me
only for his accident.

483
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:33,008
According to me, you are
better off not sharing it with them

484
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:34,218
Really?

485
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,094
Yeah... after all what
will she do really?

486
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:37,554
E><cept for crying and creating
some drama, poor thing...

487
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,473
She won't be able to help anyway

488
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:44,144
This is your grief Tara.

489
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:45,771
Yours alone.

490
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,606
Yeah.

491
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:48,690
I guess so

492
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,652
Nobody else gives a shit...

493
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,320
I\lo

494
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:56,114
I give a

495
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,241
'Shif!

496
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,996
Shiv, you said 'Shif!

497
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:05,207
It sounds funny
coming from your mouth.

498
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,209
- Does it sound funny?
- Yeah

499
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:08,502
So,

500
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:11,046
should I say stool?

501
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:12,422
Stoooooool?

502
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:17,678
Dude, hovv are you
so Zen about all this?

503
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:20,639
I'm at a different stage

504
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:23,100
of grief from you, that's all...

505
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,102
There are stages to this shit?

506
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,228
Yes.

507
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,022
First stage is Denial...

508
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:31,191
Denial...

509
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:34,403
It can't be happening to me.

510
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:37,614
These things happen to other people...

511
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:39,366
Second stage is Anger...

512
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,743
Why did this happen to me.

513
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:45,038
Why me? Why him?

514
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,542
You hate everyone because

515
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:51,128
they are not where you are...

516
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:55,299
Then comes bargaining.

517
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,050
Give and take...

518
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,054
If you happen to believe in God...

519
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,973
...then you will try everything
to please him...

520
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,558
you'll bribe him...

521
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:06,185
And if you are an atheist...

522
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:08,228
Then suddenly you will
become very spiritual...

523
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,689
All your life,

524
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,691
you were this completely
pragmatic person...

525
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:14,735
...who may not have
spared even a rupee...

526
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:16,695
...to the homeless guy
at the traffic signal...

527
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,114
But now suddenly you transform
into a philanthropist...

528
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,408
...and feed a whole file of beggars
thronging outside a religious place...

529
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:26,580
Then comes depression...

530
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,583
A dark abyss...

531
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,044
An endless night...

532
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:36,298
That is your stage.

533
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:39,092
It's a very dangerous place...

534
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:46,725
But then finally, comes acceptance!

535
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:50,020
You are finally able to
cope up with your situation...

536
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:53,357
And at this stage you
find yourself with two choices...

537
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,276
One choice is to persuade yourself...

538
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:59,154
That everything is
going to be alright...

539
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:02,032
Or give up hope, like a coward...

540
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,492
That choice is yours!

541
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:08,288
But you must be
purposeful while you wait

542
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:10,958
Then you become 'Zen',

543
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:12,125
like me!

544
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:16,672
So tell me please hovv
do I get to this...

545
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,257
ne><t stage?

546
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:22,177
First of all, call housekeeping!

547
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,251
This is Mrs. Deshpande...

548
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,629
A cup of Panickefis coffee everyday,

549
00:38:58,088 --> 00:38:59,548
keeps the doctor away...

550
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:26,200
Hi Baby!

551
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:29,453
Did you see Sudhakafis case?
- Yes sir.

552
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,330
And what do you think?

553
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:32,623
Subarachnoid?

554
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:34,333
Why do you think it's a subarachnoid?

555
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:38,003
It's blood, with surrounding oedema...

556
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:39,379
Very good,

557
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:41,423
but why so apologetic Doctor?

558
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:44,009
Because, it is very bad news sir...

559
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:45,594
It is very bad news.

560
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:47,137
But it's not your fault...

561
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:50,057
Okay let me teach
you hovv to give bad news...

562
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:52,059
Watch me and try and copy?

563
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:57,773
First, you must look
serious but hopeful...

564
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,150
...then raise your
eyebrows a little...

565
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:02,528
and chin down...

566
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:04,488
More down...

567
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,364
Not so much...

568
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:07,282
it looks like you are
set for a bo><ing match...

569
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:08,575
Look at me...

570
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:11,745
We are still waiting
for the final reports...

571
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:13,747
And we'll know more
in forty eight hours...

572
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:14,748
...but...

573
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,751
...the latest
research confirms that...

574
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:21,088
...the moon is made of
some kind of dairy product...

575
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:23,131
Possibly cheese!

576
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:24,424
Very nice sir...

577
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:25,467
And then you take them with you...

578
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:27,302
just hold their elbow like this...

579
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:29,555
Just for a count of two.
That's it.

580
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:30,472
And they are with you...

581
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:33,433
Dr. Ravi there's no
room for doubt here

582
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,143
Remember,
what are we trying to do here?

583
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:36,645
We are trying to save lives.

584
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:38,021
Right?

585
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:41,358
And if a little bit of faking
will make you do yourjob better...

586
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,277
Just do it!

587
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:51,660
The latest report confirms that...

588
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:54,162
...the moon is made of some kind
of diary product.

589
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:55,706
...possibly cheese...

590
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:57,833
Why are you dragging me here Dude?

591
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,126
I'm a proud Atheist...

592
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,295
Faith is a great coping
device Tara.

593
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:02,129
Try it!

594
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:03,005
Don't vvorry.

595
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:04,381
You are not swapping sides!

596
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:23,317
Happy? - Yes, very good...

597
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:34,536
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

598
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:38,165
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo...

599
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:44,505
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo...

600
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:46,191
Hovv could it just disappear?

601
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:48,026
That shop used to be right here...

602
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:50,571
some... ten - fifteen years back...

603
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:54,700
Can't we just go to a shopping mall?

604
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:56,702
No, I hate those bloody things...

605
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:59,329
They represent everything
that's wrong with us!

606
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:01,039
Everything? - Everything!

607
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:23,729
It's okay Shiv.

608
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:25,105
You are not swapping sides either!

609
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:28,275
Shopping is also
a great coping device...

610
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:29,067
Is it?

611
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,110
Yeah! Try it!

612
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:16,990
Prema, I'd like
to see Rajafs charts...

613
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:20,118
I'd like to see his vitals...

614
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:28,043
Shiv, hovv come you never had kids...

615
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:29,586
Just never happened.

616
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:32,172
First, there was a bit of a medical
complication.

617
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:33,674
But we were so content...

618
00:44:33,757 --> 00:44:36,343
Never really felt the need.

619
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,011
Forty years just passed...

620
00:44:38,053 --> 00:44:39,763
- For'ry years?
-For'ry years!

621
00:44:40,097 --> 00:44:40,722
Fuck!

622
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:44,017
You mean, hovv wonderful! - Yeah...

623
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:46,728
You know people keep telling me,

624
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,231
'It's okay, she had a good life'...

625
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:52,109
...as if it's okay to die
if one had a good life...

626
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:54,361
So if she had a rotten life,

627
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:56,029
she should have had
a longer life or what?

628
00:44:56,071 --> 00:44:57,573
People are shit!

629
00:44:57,656 --> 00:44:58,615
I hate peopleg

630
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:00,242
I hate people too...

631
00:45:22,598 --> 00:45:23,390
Good Morning Ann.

632
00:45:23,432 --> 00:45:24,349
Happy Birthday...

633
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,226
Thank You Uncle...

634
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:28,103
Good Morning Professor!

635
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:30,731
Good morning...

636
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:34,484
Even I'd like flowers sometime,
you know...

637
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:37,738
Professor we need to talk...

638
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,532
I... I can't talk right now.
I have to get back home.

639
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:41,700
There is a problem with

640
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:42,743
my bathroom...

641
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:44,203
the drain has...

642
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:46,246
It's high time...

643
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:52,586
No...

644
00:45:54,296 --> 00:45:55,047
I\lo

645
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:58,175
You are not being realistic
- I am being realistic

646
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:01,261
Everyday I hear of a new case

647
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:03,472
Where the patient has
suddenly recovered from coma...

648
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:05,182
...after the doctors
had given up all hope

649
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:06,433
It's fiction, Professor.
Stuff they write in magazines!

650
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:08,435
No. It's in medical journals!

651
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:11,563
I was just reading about
this woman in New Hampshire...

652
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:14,066
She was in coma for two years and
then one fine day she just woke up...

653
00:46:14,107 --> 00:46:15,567
...like she got up
after a night's sleep

654
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,195
In Australia,
there was this Scuba diver...

655
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,280
Your wife has been on a steady decline

656
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:23,617
for eight months now...

657
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:27,037
She has no quality of life...

658
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:30,374
You have to ask yourself
what would she want?

659
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,501
She would want to get better

660
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:34,670
But she is not - She will!

661
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,006
She will.

662
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:39,299
You know that's not true...

663
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:42,135
Every month you are
spending millions of rupees...

664
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:44,012
At this rate you will go bankrupt!

665
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:46,306
Is that what she would have wanted?

666
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:49,643
I don't know actually... we had never
discussed it you know... she and I...

667
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:54,648
Do you discuss this with
your wife every evening...

668
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:57,276
Darling, hovv long would
you like to be on life support

669
00:46:57,317 --> 00:46:59,152
in case you slip into a coma?

670
00:46:59,403 --> 00:47:00,320
Please give it to me in
writing,

671
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:01,488
so I would know what to do...

672
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:05,701
She is just another
patient for you Nirupam...

673
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:08,453
I know that,
she is just another hospital bed...

674
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:11,248
But I don't think you
realise what she is for me...

675
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,041
So I will decide what she wants!

676
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:17,421
She wants to get better
and if you don't want to help me...

677
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,007
I will go to the hospital board,
and I will find somebody who can!

678
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:21,008
Professor?

679
00:47:22,301 --> 00:47:24,178
You know you are not
doing this for her

680
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:26,346
You think you are, but you are not...

681
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,307
You are not afraid of her death...

682
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:31,226
Actually what you are afraid
of is that after her death...

683
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:32,728
Your life will have to change

684
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:36,106
You have to think of her Professor.

685
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,533
Shiv!

686
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,661
So, we have some good news...

687
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:50,662
What?

688
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:53,123
We repeated your husband's
scans this morning...

689
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:56,043
And, the swelling
has started to reduce

690
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:57,252
Oh wow!

691
00:47:57,336 --> 00:48:00,339
So does that mean,
he is going to like open his eyes...

692
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,090
...gain consciousness and stuff?

693
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:03,592
No, it's not that simple...

694
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:07,304
As you can see here,
the brain is less tight now

695
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:10,516
See... and the midline
shift is also reduced...

696
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:15,020
But still there is a sizeable
haematoma here in the temporal lobe...

697
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:16,480
It's a blood clot,

698
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:17,731
the size of a golf ball...

699
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:19,358
Meaning?

700
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:21,318
We need to evacuate this clot

701
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,654
so that the brain can continue to heal

702
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:27,199
We need to operate.

703
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:30,577
To remove this blood clot?

704
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:34,623
Yes, that and a little
part of the brain, in this area...

705
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:35,707
Of the brain?

706
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:37,417
Yeah, it's a small area...

707
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:41,004
What does this small
area of the brain do?

708
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:44,675
Well it takes care of the muscle
control on the right hand side...

709
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:47,261
And possibly higher language

710
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:48,428
and speech function...

711
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:50,305
if we need to resect here...

712
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:55,185
Doctor, Rajat won't
become a vegetable right?

713
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:58,313
I think it's pointless
to think like that, really...

714
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:01,358
Yeah, because he just wouldn't
want to depend on anyone!

715
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:04,278
He is like the most
self sufficient man ever...

716
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:05,696
I'm sure, I'm sure

717
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:08,282
Mrs. Deshpande, are
you happy to press on?

718
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,450
Press on? - To operate?

719
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:14,621
Yeah...

720
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:18,125
Good then, I will ask DrRavi
to book the OT for Friday?

721
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,626
Friday...

722
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,380
Shiv... hey Shiv!

723
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:25,591
Where have you been. I've
been looking for you since morning!

724
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:27,342
I was a bit... busy

725
00:49:27,426 --> 00:49:28,719
Rajafs having an
operation...

726
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:29,720
on Friday

727
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,436
This Nirupam... right,

728
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:39,605
he is a two faced FRAUD! That's all!

729
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:40,647
Shiv?

730
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:44,526
I'm sorry Tara... this
is very good news about Rajat

731
00:49:44,568 --> 00:49:46,987
But my wife also
needs an operation...

732
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:49,448
...but this bloody fellow
just refuses to do it!

733
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:52,701
It's a blockage of
cerebro-spinal fluid flow...

734
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:53,660
It's easily operable

735
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:55,537
But you did tell all this
to Nirupam right? - Of Course I did!

736
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:58,165
But do you think that bloody
know-it-all gives a damn?

737
00:49:58,373 --> 00:49:59,666
I have probably read
more medical journals...

738
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:02,002
...than he has in
his entire bloody life!

739
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:05,214
Just the other day I was
reading about it, in an old issue...

740
00:50:05,297 --> 00:50:07,424
There was a patient in
Birmingham who stayed in a coma...

741
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:09,051
...despite his scan being normal

742
00:50:09,635 --> 00:50:12,179
Then they discovered it
was mechanical arachnoiditis...

743
00:50:12,513 --> 00:50:14,598
Cured with a straightforward
spinal decompression

744
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:16,433
This was published twelve years ago!

745
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:19,228
But I don't think this
fellow has read anything...

746
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:20,687
...since he passed out of college!

747
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:23,565
Yeah... but I guess he
is just doing his job...

748
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:25,484
You know all these doctors...

749
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:29,446
...they are all puppets
of the Insurance companies...

750
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:31,365
Once they figure that the
patient is some si><ty year old hag...

751
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:32,783
...they would rather let her die

752
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:36,495
Anyway-

753
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:39,414
What did he say about Rajat?

754
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,335
They said they need to remove a
bloodclot... the size of a... football...

755
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:44,044
Oh come on...

756
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:45,212
- A golf ball
- A golf ball

757
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:46,255
Yeah...

758
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:47,381
Yeah they are right.

759
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:49,550
The surrounding
tissues need space to heal...

760
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,386
Correct. Your favourite
Nirupam had the same thing to say...

761
00:50:52,594 --> 00:50:55,347
Great then, at least one of
us is getting the right treatment

762
00:50:59,226 --> 00:51:00,519
That's the thing Shiv...

763
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:04,356
I can't be sure if this operation is
really the right decision for Rajat...

764
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:05,566
No, no! It is the correct decision

765
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:06,650
They have to remove the clot

766
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:08,652
in order to deal with the haematoma

767
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:11,238
I know! But there is
just no way to ascertain...

768
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,740
...what kind of life he
will come to after the surgery

769
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:15,742
And if there is no quality of life...

770
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:18,579
...l'm not sure if Rajat
would have wanted this...

771
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,663
Hovv do you know?

772
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,081
Did he ever tell you?

773
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:23,375
That in case I slip into coma, get
me operated only on the condition...

774
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:25,627
...that my quality
of life would be great!

775
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:27,254
What the hell you are talking about
Tara?

776
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:28,630
Quality of life? Life is life...

777
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:30,174
I know Rajat okay...

778
00:51:30,257 --> 00:51:31,383
I know that he would have preferred...

779
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:32,718
...a quick dignified death

780
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:34,178
rather than a long suffering life...

781
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:35,137
Hovv do you know?

782
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,764
Because you know what
he wanted for our honeymoon?

783
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:39,474
Trek to Ivlachu Pichu!

784
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,102
A Sunday afternoon meant
tennis for two hours straight!

785
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,188
And he would go running ten kilometres
not less than thrice a week!

786
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:47,649
These days Medical Science has
the power to cure everything Tara...

787
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:48,734
Oh is it now?

788
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:51,737
Coming straight from the fountain
of... profound medical knowledge!

789
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:55,532
By the way, which year did you
e><actly get your medical degree in?

790
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,160
Yeah I didn't attend any
Medical college and ain't I glad!

791
00:51:58,493 --> 00:52:01,580
I have never met a single doctor
in my life with any bloody morality!

792
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:02,539
Look at you.

793
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:05,250
Sounding like a completely...

794
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,627
delusional...

795
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:09,171
What. ..'?

796
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:12,007
Say it now!

797
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:14,092
Delusional old... fool.

798
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:15,344
Say it!

799
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,429
But I know what Pankaja wants...

800
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:19,473
...because I have lived
with her for forty years

801
00:52:19,556 --> 00:52:21,642
You and your bloody
'forty years' shit

802
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:24,269
You think your marriage
is so much more precious

803
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:26,063
...than mine because
it dragged on for so long?

804
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:27,356
It didn't drag on. Alright.

805
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:28,440
It did not drag on!

806
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:29,775
It lasted.

807
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:32,069
Because we cared for each
other. Not like you...

808
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:32,653
Young people...

809
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:34,488
'Not like you young people'

810
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:37,658
Okay you tell me what is there to
be afraid of a bloody operation...

811
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:39,201
What exactly is scaring you?

812
00:52:40,702 --> 00:52:42,412
That the Rajat you got married to,

813
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:44,164
that Rajat will not come back?

814
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:47,668
Right, he may not be the same Rajat,
so what, he will bloody live!

815
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:51,088
Courage, patience,
nothing you young people have...

816
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:52,589
All you want is the easy way out!

817
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:53,715
Become a bloody widow!

818
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:55,592
Mourn for si>< months and
get on with your bloody life...

819
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:57,094
Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up!

820
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:59,304
You know nothing about me
or my husband or our relationship...

821
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:00,389
Then why are you trying to kill him?

822
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:06,186
I'm so fucking done with you!

823
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:08,564
So am I!

824
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:16,446
No!

825
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,990
No!

826
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:44,725
We are behaving just like newly weds

827
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:48,145
I know! We should be bored
of each other by now, right?

828
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:51,023
It's been like si>< weeks...

829
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:54,776
And one day.

830
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:05,621
Doctor Ravi, will it be painful?

831
00:54:06,705 --> 00:54:07,623
What?

832
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:08,707
The operation?

833
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:11,752
We will give him Anaesthesia...

834
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:13,629
But will the operation work?

835
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:17,633
I mean will he still be able
to do the things that he loves...

836
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:19,259
like, play tennis

837
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:20,719
or run marathons

838
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,180
or even walk?

839
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:26,475
Mrs Deshpande it's
too early to say...

840
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:27,434
we need to...

841
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:28,602
...'We need to repeat the scans

842
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:31,230
and the ne><t 48 hours will be crucial'

843
00:54:32,523 --> 00:54:33,398
Yes

844
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,441
Yes

845
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:38,487
Will you tell me the truth?

846
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:40,447
Doctor please...

847
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:43,659
The truth is, Mrs. Deshpande...

848
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:45,285
I don't really know

849
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:49,456
if he'll be able to play
tennis or walk or... whatever...

850
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,333
But, I think...

851
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:54,670
...probably not.

852
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:56,463
It is not going to be easy.

853
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:00,717
Thank you.

854
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:04,012
Thank you for being honest.

855
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,018
I am sorry

856
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:19,695
She was alone at home
when she had the stroke...

857
00:55:19,736 --> 00:55:22,698
If we had gotten her to hospital, her
condition would have been better...

858
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:26,702
...but I had gone out to see
a bloody cricket match.

859
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:27,661
By the time...

860
00:55:27,703 --> 00:55:29,288
Yeah. I know Sir.

861
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:31,039
I am very sorry for Ma'am.

862
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:34,334
If you are sorry then
please help me - Sir...

863
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:36,211
She needs the operation.

864
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:39,298
And the hospital won't do it because
they think I don't have the money.

865
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:41,717
Sir, your house is already mortgaged.

866
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:44,136
And your overdraft is very high.

867
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:48,599
If you don't mind me saying sir, you
should ask your family member to help.

868
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:52,227
Vishnu Ivlurali Nair.

869
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:55,063
My wife is my only family.

870
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:58,066
Please help me.

871
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:28,347
Are you hungry? Okay we are
taking you to the canteen.

872
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:31,058
Calm Down.
We are going to the canteen.

873
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:32,267
Don't worry...

874
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:34,061
...the Doctor will come and give
you injection the pain will come down

875
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:38,273
Don't cry. It will be all okay soon...

876
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:40,734
Canteen...

877
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:45,030
Calm down...
It will be all okay soon...

878
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,368
I told you the Doctor will make okay

879
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:56,041
Canteen...

880
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:09,137
Listen, my hottie!

881
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:10,264
I love you!

882
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:38,417
Tara Ma'am.

883
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:40,169
You came?

884
00:57:40,502 --> 00:57:41,461
So good.

885
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:44,173
I have been praying here
everyday for Rajat Sir.

886
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:46,466
Take some offering.

887
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:47,551
No, Thank You.

888
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:56,393
Ish!

889
00:57:57,227 --> 00:57:59,605
Oh my God! Baboon!

890
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:03,984
What a rude girl you are!

891
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:05,277
You have not answered
a single call of mine.

892
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:06,612
I just couldn't take it anymore.

893
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:09,406
I just handed the kids
to Dileep and came here.

894
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:11,617
I'm so glad you are here.

895
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,619
Yeah, I'm here.

896
00:58:14,661 --> 00:58:16,955
I can't wait to meet Rajat.

897
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:20,417
I'm going to pass all
my positive energy to him.

898
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:24,087
By the way I have started
chanting like you said...

899
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:26,048
You did?... Good girl!

900
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:28,592
Yeah... so...
they will take Rajat for a...

901
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:30,511
Let me take you to a spa...
oh sorry...

902
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:34,306
There is a blood
clot in Rajafs brain...

903
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:36,183
...and they are going to remove it...

904
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:38,060
they want to operate on him.

905
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:40,479
Why can't they use
these clot busting drugs?

906
00:58:41,104 --> 00:58:42,105
I don't know...

907
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,317
I have read about it somewhere.
Let me just google it.

908
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,110
Clot busting drugs... you know...

909
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:49,696
it's like they give
you an injection...

910
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,324
...and it dissolves your
blood clots

911
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:54,034
like magic... in seconds.

912
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:57,454
It's for people with like
strokes and heart attacks...

913
00:58:57,746 --> 00:58:59,498
Probably they can't use it on Rajat

914
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,041
or they would have suggested it right?

915
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:04,002
I bet it's because
it's too expensive...

916
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:06,171
Have you spoken to your insurer?

917
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:07,339
No...

918
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:10,217
Tara. You don't know your insurer?

919
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:14,012
Look I'm sure the
doctors know their shit.

920
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:15,931
The doctors now a days
are only interested...

921
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,558
...in mooching ma><imum money off you,

922
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:19,017
not to cure you!

923
00:59:21,395 --> 00:59:23,230
Oh...
-V\/hat...?

924
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:27,442
In trauma cases they avoid using
clot busting drugs.

925
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:28,151
It's too risky.

926
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:30,612
Mrs. Deshpande, you can come now.

927
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:38,245
Full Cochin girl you have become.

928
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:44,585
Baby. lsh is here.

929
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:48,088
He can hear you?

930
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:50,382
I don't know

931
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:59,016
Hey Rajat.
We are all praying for you, okay...

932
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,144
Dileep and kids miss you a lot.

933
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:05,606
In fact, Dileep has stopped playing
tennis without you.

934
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:09,693
Enough now Rajat...

935
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:12,738
Just get the hell back and get up now!

936
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:17,659
And quickly tell us what
is the ne><t best TV show to watch!

937
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:22,497
Homeland Season 4
has also started now.

938
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:25,417
Come on!

939
01:00:44,603 --> 01:00:48,649
...and repeat this guy one
more time okay, and all of them...

940
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:50,692
Doctor can I just have
five minutes with you...

941
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:52,778
I'll just. -l'll call you.
Whatever time, I'll be there.

942
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:55,322
Doctor, I have come across
at least fifteen more cases...

943
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:55,822
Please come in.

944
01:00:56,073 --> 01:01:01,119
...where spinal decompression
was administered...

945
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:05,415
...and more than half the cases there
was at least a marginal improvement...

946
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:07,417
Professor... - This is..

947
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:11,004
You have to stop this. Please.

948
01:01:11,672 --> 01:01:14,258
Doctor my wife needs
a spinal decompression surgery

949
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,509
Why don't you understand?

950
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:18,345
Surely it's not the most
complicated procedure in the world...

951
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:20,556
Why don't you read about this case...

952
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:22,683
You don't think I know this case?

953
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:25,435
I have written for some
of these journals, Professor.

954
01:01:26,103 --> 01:01:28,021
I have been doing this for
twenty years. You have to trust me.

955
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:30,357
But you must
empathise with me too.

956
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:33,402
This procedure can't make
her any worse than she is.

957
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:36,196
But I know why you are not doing it.

958
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:38,240
It's the hospital board
which is possibly pressurising you...

959
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:40,242
...to shut my case since they think
it's a hopless case...

960
01:01:40,284 --> 01:01:41,368
Don't waste time on it.

961
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,662
Is there no end to greed?

962
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:45,414
Okay, can I just say something.

963
01:01:45,664 --> 01:01:48,750
Your wife is my responsibility.

964
01:01:49,293 --> 01:01:52,254
I decide what is best for
my patients not the board - Then...

965
01:01:52,296 --> 01:01:53,797
I decide... please!

966
01:01:54,715 --> 01:01:57,092
Hovv many times will I repeat myself.

967
01:01:57,134 --> 01:02:01,054
There is no surgery in the
world which will revive your wife.

968
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:02,639
It will only cause her more pain.

969
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:03,974
Is that what you want to do?

970
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:07,227
Alright then whatever you may say,
but one way or another...

971
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:09,354
I will save her.

972
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:10,689
I promise you that.

973
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:13,734
Professor, this is not the way.

974
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:21,074
I am not moving from here.

975
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:23,660
Poor gUY!

976
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,373
Yeah... his wife has been
in coma for over ten months now.

977
01:02:29,124 --> 01:02:30,417
He thinks she needs an operation...

978
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:33,378
...but the hospital wants
to disconnect her ventilator.

979
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:35,005
What nonsense!

980
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:36,381
Hovv can the hospital decide!

981
01:02:36,423 --> 01:02:37,549
He should decide!

982
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:39,218
His wife has every right to live.

983
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:41,178
Live and do what! I mean,

984
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:43,013
she probably will never wake up.

985
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:46,350
If he desires so,
then the hospital must operate.

986
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:47,434
He must have paid shit
loads of money already.

987
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:50,354
You can't do this! I'm not moving!

988
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:52,356
Let go!

989
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:54,566
Hey!

990
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:57,694
You want my wife to die and
give the room to somebody else.

991
01:02:57,736 --> 01:03:00,489
To some rich people!

992
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:03,325
See! I told you it is about the money.

993
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,619
My heart goes out to him.

994
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:06,328
Ish!

995
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:07,246
Ya?

996
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:08,413
I want to ask you something.

997
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:10,207
What happened baboon!

998
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:14,711
You be strong about this.

999
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:17,297
And the thing is I'm with
you on this.

1000
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:19,341
And I'm here, okay.

1001
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:24,137
Yes get the car keys, I will
be down in three and a half minutes.

1002
01:03:24,555 --> 01:03:25,430
9K8)'-

1003
01:03:26,723 --> 01:03:28,684
Sir, Mrs. Deshpande wants
to see you

1004
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:30,269
Saumya, not today... please
tell her tomorrow.

1005
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:31,311
Sir, she is insisting...

1006
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:33,689
Doctor I'm really
sorry to force my way...

1007
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,024
...in so late but I really
have to speak to you.

1008
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,610
It's okay. Come in please.

1009
01:03:39,069 --> 01:03:40,445
This is my friend lshita...

1010
01:03:41,154 --> 01:03:42,114
Have a seat.

1011
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:45,784
What can I do for you?

1012
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:48,203
Well, I have changed my mind.

1013
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:51,039
I don't want Rajat
to have this operation.

1014
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:52,666
Sorry? What?

1015
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:55,711
I just... I don't want to
subject my husband to any more pain.

1016
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:58,255
Your husband is a
young and healthy man...

1017
01:03:58,672 --> 01:04:01,133
It will be stupid to not
give him this chance, really.

1018
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:02,718
I discussed it at length with
my friend,

1019
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,219
and I have made up my mind.

1020
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:06,054
I don't want this operation.

1021
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:10,434
And who do you think
you are to decide that.

1022
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,644
And what do you think this is...

1023
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:14,188
...some 'Who wants to
be a Millionaire' quiz show?

1024
01:04:14,479 --> 01:04:16,398
Where phoning a friend
will get you the right answer?

1025
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:18,692
You know I am the doctor here,
not her!

1026
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:21,361
Your husband has a very
good chance to get better.

1027
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:23,655
And I will ensure
that he gets that chance.

1028
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:25,407
He is her husband.

1029
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,492
And you can't force her to, okay?

1030
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:30,245
You know that's the problem
with you rich people.

1031
01:04:30,704 --> 01:04:32,664
You take medical
treatment for granted.

1032
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:34,249
Go and see sometime,
the state of poor people...

1033
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:35,459
...outside a government hospital...

1034
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:37,252
...who sell their lands and homes
and everything they ovvn...

1035
01:04:37,336 --> 01:04:38,545
...and sleep on road side...

1036
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:41,131
...only to ensure that their
loved ones get a chance to live.

1037
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:43,717
You guys are sitting in
a state-of-the-art hospital...

1038
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:45,135
...vvith five star amenities,

1039
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:47,221
and you think you know about pain?

1040
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:49,723
You have no idea, I'm sorry!

1041
01:04:50,474 --> 01:04:53,435
Yeah maybe I have no idea
but I know my rights, doctor.

1042
01:04:54,686 --> 01:04:56,104
Mrs. Deshpande,
you can take your rights

1043
01:04:56,188 --> 01:04:57,481
and do what you want with them.

1044
01:04:58,065 --> 01:04:59,066
I know my job.

1045
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:01,360
And I will make sure
I do what I have to do.

1046
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:05,948
Wow.

1047
01:05:06,532 --> 01:05:07,950
What an asshole.

1048
01:05:08,492 --> 01:05:09,952
Oh my God.

1049
01:05:23,632 --> 01:05:24,550
What's this?

1050
01:05:24,591 --> 01:05:26,260
And hovv I thought
that after retirement...

1051
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:28,554
...we will always
spend time together...

1052
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,223
...and look at you, deserting
your pretty wife on a Saturday night

1053
01:05:31,265 --> 01:05:33,642
...for that silly cricket match...

1054
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,144
Hovv dare you!

1055
01:05:37,187 --> 01:05:40,023
Is it a girl? ls she pretty?

1056
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:43,026
Hey, come on... you know I
don't have any secrets from you...

1057
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,611
Ah... tell it to the Pope!

1058
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:56,290
Put that book down now. Get ready.

1059
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:00,961
Hey, remember this...

1060
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:05,549
Oh... the blue glitter
you wore at my wedding!

1061
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:11,096
Feels like another lifetime...

1062
01:06:12,472 --> 01:06:14,975
You remember hovv Rajat
made us down all those shots?

1063
01:06:16,143 --> 01:06:18,145
And then that... disaster... Lokesh!

1064
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:20,480
Dropped the entire
bag of mushies in the sea...

1065
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:23,275
Went into the sea looking
for it for five hours...

1066
01:06:23,317 --> 01:06:25,235
And missed your
wedding in the process.

1067
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:26,987
Fucker he didn't even come once...

1068
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:30,490
Actually,
Cochin is kind of out of the way...

1069
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:31,700
Oh please!

1070
01:06:31,992 --> 01:06:33,493
It's not Brazil exactly.

1071
01:06:34,328 --> 01:06:35,662
It's only a two hour flight

1072
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:41,543
Even if they don't come,
they still care.

1073
01:06:42,336 --> 01:06:43,295
9K8)'-

1074
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:45,297
They do!

1075
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:47,132
Yes Mummy!

1076
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,637
Your phone is always ringing,
you know that?

1077
01:06:55,432 --> 01:06:56,391
Oh shit!

1078
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:00,187
You didn't have to drop me.

1079
01:07:00,229 --> 01:07:02,064
I could have walked.

1080
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:05,651
Sorry!

1081
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:07,361
Don't be sorry.

1082
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:09,988
Dileep is so worried.

1083
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:12,533
Aryan has never had
such high fever ever before.

1084
01:07:12,616 --> 01:07:14,952
And I have also not
been away like this.

1085
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:16,495
Aryan should be your priority.

1086
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:18,580
In fact I am feeling a bit guilty.

1087
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:23,210
I will be back soon okay, I promise.

1088
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:25,504
Thank you for coming. Bye.

1089
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:26,505
Bye.

1090
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:29,258
Wait. - What?

1091
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:31,051
I have got to tell you something.

1092
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:32,469
What?

1093
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:35,430
Because I am a mother

1094
01:07:35,514 --> 01:07:37,057
I know hovv it feels..

1095
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:40,227
...l think you should inform
Rajafs mother now..

1096
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:42,604
Oh no, I can't believe
you of all people.

1097
01:07:42,604 --> 01:07:44,398
...you know what
Rajafs mother is like.

1098
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:46,108
But she is his mother.

1099
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:48,277
And she has every right to know.

1100
01:07:48,652 --> 01:07:51,029
In fact you should be sharing
this with your parents too.

1101
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:52,573
You need their support.

1102
01:07:52,656 --> 01:07:55,534
You know what, lsh,
I know you have Aryan and Ayesha.

1103
01:07:55,576 --> 01:07:56,994
...and you are this great mother

1104
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:58,453
with a super hectic life..

1105
01:07:59,454 --> 01:08:00,706
...and I have understood

1106
01:08:00,956 --> 01:08:02,124
that I'm not your priority.

1107
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:04,084
Okay don't exaggerate now.

1108
01:08:05,419 --> 01:08:07,337
And I'm sorry I
couldn't come earlier.

1109
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:11,049
But you should just forget
all this and just focus

1110
01:08:11,425 --> 01:08:13,177
on being positive..

1111
01:08:14,011 --> 01:08:15,512
...and having the faith.

1112
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:18,390
Stop this patronising shit.

1113
01:08:19,141 --> 01:08:20,267
I'd like to see your positivity.

1114
01:08:20,392 --> 01:08:22,394
...if Dileep or Aryan were
on ventilator instead.

1115
01:08:22,603 --> 01:08:25,731
All this positive energy will
disappear in a minute

1116
01:08:26,148 --> 01:08:27,733
Have faith! Have faith!

1117
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,485
To hell with your
'Have faith' bullshit!

1118
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:39,286
You always had so
much advice to offer.

1119
01:08:40,621 --> 01:08:42,998
Now would be a really good time.

1120
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:50,672
I don't know what I am supposed to do.

1121
01:08:55,385 --> 01:08:56,762
I really don't know.

1122
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:02,184
Pankaja, all of those times I told you

1123
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:05,437
that I have had no secrets from you..

1124
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:09,316
I was not telling the truth.

1125
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,279
Pankaja.

1126
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:18,116
'.-

1127
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:27,459
1984 December. We had this
major college reunion celebration.

1128
01:09:28,585 --> 01:09:30,671
...you had refused to come and..

1129
01:09:32,673 --> 01:09:34,424
...vvish I hadn't gone either.

1130
01:09:37,469 --> 01:09:39,513
Rohini was there.

1131
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:45,519
You remember her? History Honors.

1132
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:47,729
Long hair.

1133
01:09:48,188 --> 01:09:49,147
Nose ring.

1134
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:50,232
Big bindi.

1135
01:09:50,315 --> 01:09:53,527
Handloom sarees. Later she
married that rich idiot from Delhi.

1136
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:57,322
Well, Rich idiot
wasn't around either so

1137
01:09:58,532 --> 01:10:00,325
Rohini and I sort of

1138
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:03,537
gravitated towards each other and..

1139
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:06,707
We danced together

1140
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:11,378
and talked about
old times and all that.

1141
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:16,341
She knocked down three
or four drinks very quickly.

1142
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:19,469
Then we started getting
a little sentimental

1143
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:22,055
and she began to cry..

1144
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:27,102
...so I tried to comfort her..

1145
01:10:29,104 --> 01:10:31,190
...before I knew it
I was holding her..

1146
01:10:34,693 --> 01:10:37,487
...and one thing followed another.

1147
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:50,167
Pankaja

1148
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:53,629
if you can hear me

1149
01:10:56,173 --> 01:10:58,133
I'm asking for your forgiveness.

1150
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:03,096
I know you are going to recover.

1151
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,975
I know you are going to recover. And
when you do,

1152
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:08,685
I need you to forgive me.

1153
01:11:09,728 --> 01:11:13,065
And if you are not going to recover..

1154
01:11:17,444 --> 01:11:19,613
...l can't let you go
without telling you this.

1155
01:11:21,782 --> 01:11:23,158
It's been a weight on my heart

1156
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,493
for thirty years.

1157
01:11:27,204 --> 01:11:29,665
I fucked up.

1158
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:32,042
I'm sorry.

1159
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:36,380
Forgive me.

1160
01:11:48,141 --> 01:11:49,017
Come sit here.

1161
01:11:49,476 --> 01:11:50,519
I'll be back. give me two minutes.

1162
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:53,230
Oye stop with the drama. please.

1163
01:11:53,605 --> 01:11:55,148
Come and sit here..

1164
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:14,585
I'm sorry.

1165
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:16,628
Don't be stupid.

1166
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:18,297
I'm sorry actually.

1167
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:19,673
Forget it.

1168
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:25,762
It's all so bloody..

1169
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:28,056
...fucked up.

1170
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:32,060
Bravo! You said the 'F' word!

1171
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:39,610
I have missed you Shiv.

1172
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:43,447
Just a few minutes back I realised,

1173
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,407
that you are the only person..

1174
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:47,034
...who gets me..

1175
01:12:47,075 --> 01:12:48,785
In a country of one billion!

1176
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:51,496
And you don't even
know what Twitter is!

1177
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:52,748
I know.

1178
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:54,666
It's a..

1179
01:12:55,626 --> 01:12:56,793
...notice board.

1180
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:06,553
Listen.

1181
01:13:07,346 --> 01:13:09,473
Do you think we can get
some booze somewhere right now?

1182
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:17,397
You know when Pankaja
comes out of the coma.

1183
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:21,276
...first thing she is going to say is,

1184
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:24,363
'why is the bathroom so dirty?'

1185
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:30,285
Well Rajat would just
switch on the snooze button..

1186
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:31,787
...and go right back to sleep.

1187
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:33,622
Lucky fellow.

1188
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:41,421
You think people dream
when they are in a coma?

1189
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:45,300
Maybe.

1190
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,427
I don't knovv..

1191
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:51,765
Rajat you ass!
You better be dreaming about me.

1192
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:54,643
You will never know, will you?

1193
01:13:55,352 --> 01:13:57,813
I'm sure he is dreaming
about Deepika Padukone.

1194
01:13:58,021 --> 01:13:59,773
No.. he will be dreaming about you..

1195
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:01,650
He is always ogling at girls..

1196
01:14:01,692 --> 01:14:03,235
Yeah? - Yeah.

1197
01:14:03,485 --> 01:14:06,947
If we are in a restaurant.

1198
01:14:07,155 --> 01:14:09,449
...he will flirt with the waitress,
like every time.

1199
01:14:09,741 --> 01:14:11,743
It's not like she is
going to sleep with you..

1200
01:14:12,077 --> 01:14:14,288
...she gets paid to tolerate you.

1201
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:19,668
Men are just programmed differently.

1202
01:14:21,545 --> 01:14:23,130
Okay please enlighten me,

1203
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:26,216
if you men ever pick
up the wet towel after you..

1204
01:14:26,258 --> 01:14:28,468
...will you be considered
less manly or what?

1205
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:33,015
Well by the time you hit my age..

1206
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:37,644
...you wouldn't bend down for a thousand
rupee note forget about the towel!

1207
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:43,025
Once it occurred to
me that I should compare.

1208
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:47,237
...the number of cosmetics between
Pankaja and I in the bathroom.

1209
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,658
And I discovered that I only
possess one tooth brush and one razor.

1210
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:57,497
While she has si><ty
seven bottles and tubes.

1211
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:01,418
...and little round things
with mirrors and what not..

1212
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:04,671
I don't get even an inch
of space to place my razor..

1213
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:08,217
...between her numerous cream
bottles. night cream, day cream.

1214
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:10,552
...morning cream.
all over the place.

1215
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:12,554
...why doesn't anyone
make a 48 hour cream man.

1216
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:14,056
...it will be a great invention.

1217
01:15:17,017 --> 01:15:18,310
So bad they are right.

1218
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:19,603
Very bad.

1219
01:15:25,609 --> 01:15:28,111
Hey, this bar doesn't have any music?

1220
01:15:30,113 --> 01:15:30,989
You like..

1221
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:32,032
LPS?

1222
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:38,038
Oh my God, you really are old!

1223
01:16:42,102 --> 01:16:43,103
You?

1224
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:45,272
Uncle, ls everything okay?

1225
01:16:45,355 --> 01:16:46,356
We heard noise.

1226
01:16:46,398 --> 01:16:47,316
Madam is worried.

1227
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:48,192
Tell her

1228
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:50,611
old man is drinking and dancing.

1229
01:16:50,986 --> 01:16:53,405
Oye Shiv,
ask the neighbours to join us.

1230
01:17:01,163 --> 01:17:01,580
Okay Uncle.

1231
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:02,664
You want to join us?

1232
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:04,541
No Uncle. Okay Uncle.

1233
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,715
Finally understood.

1234
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:13,634
Shh. neighbours..

1235
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:15,969
So this is the secret

1236
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:17,596
of your forty year long marriage?

1237
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,349
Your se><y vvife!

1238
01:17:22,059 --> 01:17:23,143
Isn't she lovely?

1239
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:25,187
Hot is the word!

1240
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:27,147
'Hot'!

1241
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:36,114
You know I read in a science
fiction novel, that the future has.

1242
01:17:36,156 --> 01:17:38,742
...already happened in some
other dimension, or whatever.

1243
01:17:39,117 --> 01:17:41,537
So, whatever has to happen,
has already happened!

1244
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:43,413
In our ancient scriptures,

1245
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:45,123
they call it Karma.

1246
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:47,084
Which means the operation
is already. done.

1247
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:49,378
Ventilator is already disconnected.

1248
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:52,631
Shh.

1249
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:55,050
What?

1250
01:17:58,178 --> 01:17:59,388
Think I

1251
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:00,514
just heard

1252
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:02,349
Pankaja's voice..

1253
01:18:03,016 --> 01:18:07,229
Shut up! So stupid.

1254
01:18:07,354 --> 01:18:08,647
Don't say shit like that.

1255
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:19,366
True love?

1256
01:18:19,408 --> 01:18:21,201
What does that even mean?

1257
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:24,204
Like I would know.

1258
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:29,251
You know I used to
think that it's like.

1259
01:18:29,543 --> 01:18:32,087
...having the courage
to let your loved one go..

1260
01:18:32,546 --> 01:18:35,757
...or to be able to accept
your partner unconditionally?

1261
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:40,262
In running shoes or on a wheel
chain. it shouldn't matter, right.

1262
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:44,057
But maybe it's neither,

1263
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:45,726
you know.

1264
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:49,062
It's not our decision to make.

1265
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:52,316
Maybe.

1266
01:18:58,113 --> 01:18:59,281
I'm scared Shiv..

1267
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:08,332
I'm scared too..

1268
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:35,335
Don't worry Tara.

1269
01:20:36,336 --> 01:20:37,754
I will take care of you.

1270
01:20:39,256 --> 01:20:40,340
I'm here for you.

1271
01:20:40,674 --> 01:20:41,717
Always.

1272
01:20:43,427 --> 01:20:45,345
See I repaired the
light bulb too for you.

1273
01:22:19,356 --> 01:22:20,107
Hello.

1274
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:21,066
Hello..

1275
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:22,776
Hi Aunty..

1276
01:22:23,443 --> 01:22:24,319
Rajat.

1277
01:22:24,653 --> 01:22:28,282
...yeah this is Rajafs phone,
this is Tara.

1278
01:22:29,283 --> 01:22:30,325
Oh.. OK.

1279
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:32,494
...l wanted to talk
to you about Rajat.

1280
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:09,364
Hello Indira

1281
01:23:09,531 --> 01:23:10,616
Uncle..

1282
01:23:10,657 --> 01:23:13,160
Madam, look who is here..

1283
01:23:13,202 --> 01:23:14,328
Who is it, Indira?

1284
01:23:14,745 --> 01:23:16,622
Good morning, uncle.
- Good morning Nalini..

1285
01:23:16,663 --> 01:23:19,166
I'm sorry about the
noise last night.

1286
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:22,002
That's okay Uncle,
I can sleep through anything.

1287
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:25,339
Thank You so much
for sending the food.

1288
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:27,591
It was really very kind of you

1289
01:23:27,674 --> 01:23:30,469
but I wouldn't be
needing it any more.

1290
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:32,221
Is Aunty coming back?

1291
01:23:32,304 --> 01:23:34,723
No.. I mean,

1292
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:36,350
maybe, maybe not..

1293
01:23:36,517 --> 01:23:38,644
...but I am going to
learn hovv to cook myself..

1294
01:23:42,564 --> 01:23:43,607
You will be fine Uncle..

1295
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:04,044
Ma'am.. Good Morning..

1296
01:24:04,711 --> 01:24:06,338
Sorry to bother you..

1297
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:07,673
Just one minute, please.

1298
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:12,219
I have some paperwork for you,
just to transfer all the sickness

1299
01:24:12,261 --> 01:24:14,513
...payments to your name,
for the insurance and all..

1300
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:16,598
...can you please sign..

1301
01:24:17,558 --> 01:24:19,059
Can I use your pen?

1302
01:24:19,059 --> 01:24:20,227
Sure.

1303
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,146
Just initials right?

1304
01:24:24,648 --> 01:24:26,066
Rajat sir's mother is coming..

1305
01:24:26,358 --> 01:24:27,276
So nice!

1306
01:24:29,278 --> 01:24:32,406
I have told the company
people to leave you alone.

1307
01:24:32,698 --> 01:24:34,616
Girish, I just want to say

1308
01:24:34,658 --> 01:24:35,617
thank you.

1309
01:24:36,076 --> 01:24:38,704
You have been so helpful
to me and my husband.

1310
01:24:39,329 --> 01:24:41,999
...and I haven't exactly
acknowledged it.

1311
01:24:42,332 --> 01:24:44,334
You are the kindest person there is,

1312
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:46,545
So..Thank You.

1313
01:24:50,591 --> 01:24:53,677
Please Ma'am, it's my pleasure.

1314
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:58,765
Not pleasure. . like that.

1315
01:24:59,725 --> 01:25:01,977
I hope I have signed
everything okay.

1316
01:25:03,562 --> 01:25:05,606
Yes, it's okay

1317
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:06,356
I am sure.

1318
01:25:06,481 --> 01:25:08,358
Okay. . bye

1319
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:12,988
Hovv long have you been here?

1320
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:14,156
6 months.

1321
01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:15,282
6 months.

1322
01:25:15,324 --> 01:25:18,452
When you spend 3 years here,
you will learn, my young friend

1323
01:25:18,452 --> 01:25:22,414
that you are not here to
participate in your patients sorrow

1324
01:25:22,623 --> 01:25:24,458
You are here to put an end,

1325
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:26,001
to pain and misery..

1326
01:25:26,084 --> 01:25:27,336
One way or the other

1327
01:25:27,753 --> 01:25:29,338
To give life, yes.

1328
01:25:29,421 --> 01:25:30,714
But also to know,

1329
01:25:30,964 --> 01:25:32,049
when to let it go.

1330
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:33,217
Sister

1331
01:25:33,509 --> 01:25:37,095
Are you meaning to play God, sir?

1332
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:40,140
God is what our patients
need very often, Dr Ravi.

1333
01:25:40,557 --> 01:25:44,019
But you see, God doesn't
come on the 9 am ward rounds

1334
01:25:44,228 --> 01:25:46,522
So, you and I are the closest
they are ever going to get.

1335
01:25:46,563 --> 01:25:47,439
What, Understood?

1336
01:25:53,529 --> 01:25:55,531
Sir, do you want to
witness the procedure?

1337
01:25:58,659 --> 01:25:59,535
Yes.

1338
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:02,120
Sister, please shut
down the ventilator.

1339
01:26:10,003 --> 01:26:11,004
Now deflate.

1340
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,180
She is breathing.

1341
01:26:27,271 --> 01:26:29,356
Monitor the vitals please.

1342
01:26:29,356 --> 01:26:31,149
Sir I will be with you shortly.

1343
01:26:32,484 --> 01:26:34,403
Aunty is trying to
breathe on her own..

1344
01:26:34,528 --> 01:26:36,488
Can I be with her..

1345
01:26:44,454 --> 01:26:46,415
I'm here..

1346
01:26:49,585 --> 01:26:51,044
I will give you a minute.

1347
01:26:56,633 --> 01:26:58,719
I'm not letting you go..

1348
01:27:09,938 --> 01:27:11,565
Okay Mrs. Deshpande,

1349
01:27:12,065 --> 01:27:13,233

1350
01:27:13,567 --> 01:27:15,277
Thank you Doctor Vishwanath

1351
01:27:17,029 --> 01:27:18,447
Okay Mrs. Deshpande.

1352
01:27:18,614 --> 01:27:20,199
I'll be fine..

1353
01:27:34,505 --> 01:27:36,340
Will you please chill.
My shirt will get crumpled..

1354
01:27:36,423 --> 01:27:38,091
Hovv dare you complain, you ass!

1355
01:27:39,051 --> 01:27:40,260

Don't go.. please

1359
01:27:54,775 --> 01:27:56,652
Please.

1360
01:27:57,319 --> 01:27:58,445
Hovv many times did I
tell you

1361
01:27:58,445 --> 01:27:59,363
to replace this bulb?

1362
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:01,114
You rich spoilt brat,

1363
01:28:01,114 --> 01:28:02,115
why can't you do it yourself?

1364
01:28:02,115 --> 01:28:03,367
You cheap local riff raff..

1365
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:07,454
...l would have if it didn't
require an engineering degree.

1366
01:28:09,456 --> 01:28:11,375
I will come back tomorrow
and do it my darling.

1367
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:14,586
And I will be pining
for the ne><t 24 hours

1368
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:23,387
Sandeep's been waiting for
a while now,

1369
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:25,347
please let me go, please.

1370
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:27,099
Go then.

1371
01:28:28,225 --> 01:28:30,602
You just watch, I will come
back and get my revenge..

1372
01:28:34,189 --> 01:28:41,446
He left me alone, he left me
alone, he breaked my heart.

1373
01:28:42,072 --> 01:28:44,366
Teared it apart.

1374
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:47,411
He left me alone.

1375
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:53,166
I knew it,
you can't resist me, can you?

1376
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:54,459
Move now.. move..

1377
01:28:56,044 --> 01:28:57,045
You..

1378
01:29:00,632 --> 01:29:02,050
What did you forget now..

1379
01:29:04,511 --> 01:29:07,139
Oh God! Running shoes, really..

1380
01:29:07,181 --> 01:29:09,183
Aren't you going forjust one day..

1381
01:29:10,309 --> 01:29:12,686
God! It's like an addiction for you,
you know.

1382
01:29:16,106 --> 01:29:17,608
I want to look good
for you only baby..

1383
01:29:17,691 --> 01:29:18,567
Oh is it now?

1384
01:29:26,033 --> 01:29:30,078
Aren't we behaving
like full on 'newly weds'?

1385
01:29:31,038 --> 01:29:31,622
I know

1386
01:29:31,705 --> 01:29:33,957
By now we should be bored
of each other right.

1387
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:36,543
...it's been si>< weeks already.

1388
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:40,589
...and one day..

1389
01:29:46,553 --> 01:29:48,305
Please remember to
pay the electricity bill..

1390
01:29:48,347 --> 01:29:50,599
Forget it! Who are you
ordering like your wife..

1391
01:29:53,393 --> 01:29:55,979
Listen my hottie!

1392
01:29:56,063 --> 01:29:57,022
I love you!

1393
01:29:57,648 --> 01:29:58,732
I know.

1394
01:30:29,763 --> 01:30:31,139
Has it come on?

1395
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:32,599
Don't disturb me..

1396
01:30:36,645 --> 01:30:38,230
Hey, what are you doing?

1397
01:30:38,397 --> 01:30:41,733
Think we should sell off
this TV and buy a radio insteacl.

1398
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:43,318
Didn't we just buy it?

1399
01:30:43,402 --> 01:30:44,695
Just bought it?

1400
01:30:44,778 --> 01:30:46,363
Yeah. only nine years ago..

1401
01:30:46,488 --> 01:30:49,616
It should last for
minimum fifteen years.

1402
01:30:49,658 --> 01:30:52,578
Then hovv will they
come up with new models.

1403
01:30:52,744 --> 01:30:55,747
These things come with
inbuilt obsoletion dates

1404
01:30:57,124 --> 01:31:01,128
You are the one who's old and
obsolete. Told you to do yoga, didn't I?

1405
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:06,091
You are there right,

1406
01:31:06,133 --> 01:31:08,302

1407

...come on novv, enough yoga, we are
going to the club to watch the match.

1408

1409
01:31:11,722 --> 01:31:14,099
Yes you are, every time
you watch with me, India wins!

1410
01:31:14,141 --> 01:31:16,435
I'm busy,
I don't have eight hours to waste.

1411
01:31:16,476 --> 01:31:19,146
Okay, whatever you like,
but this is a match I can't miss.

1412
01:31:19,188 --> 01:31:20,022
What is this?

1413
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:21,773
And hovv I thought
that after retirement.

1414
01:31:22,024 --> 01:31:24,109
...we will always
spend time together.

1415
01:31:24,318 --> 01:31:26,528
...and look at you, deserting your
pretty wife on a Saturday night

1416
01:31:26,653 --> 01:31:29,198
...for that silly cricket match.

1417
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:31,742
Hovv dare you!

1418
01:31:32,576 --> 01:31:35,078

Hey, come on.. you know I
don't have any secrets from you..

1420

Ah.. tell it to the Pope!

1421
01:31:42,586 --> 01:31:43,795
What does that mean. yes or no?

1422
01:31:44,713 --> 01:31:46,632
I knew you were joking.

1423
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:49,092
Okay go.. have fun..

1424

1427
01:31:55,057 --> 01:31:56,308
We have been together
for forty years.

1428
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:58,101
...and I speak your Hindi so vvell,
but look at you..

1429
01:31:58,185 --> 01:32:00,437
...can't speak a word of Malayalam.

1430
01:32:00,604 --> 01:32:02,606
I married you for your brains.

1431
01:32:03,232 --> 01:32:04,733
You married me for my looks.

1432
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:06,360
Get lost!

My biryani should be piping hot

1435
01:32:16,119 --> 01:32:18,330
Otherwise I won't let
you into the house!
