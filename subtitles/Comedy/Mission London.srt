1
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:52,613
What would you say, Mr. President?

2
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:56,492
People really like you. You cannot
ask for anything more than that.

3
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:00,746
That's exactly why I'm concerned.
Our potential seems to be obscured.

4
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,000
From here I could only go down.

5
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:24,270
I need an explanation... Tell me why
every time I try to do something

6
00:01:24,353 --> 00:01:27,523
for this country, some crocks
have to screw things up?

7
00:01:27,607 --> 00:01:31,068
They are always holding you back
when you try to do something useful.

8
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:33,112
These people are
complete crocks.

9
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:34,780
What do you think you are doing?

10
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,032
Can't you see I'm busy?

11
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:39,660
- I'm going to leave.
- You're busy with yourself as usual.

12
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:41,704
I'm not one for hanging
around in your shadow.

13
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:44,457
Because I'm fighting for eternal dignity.

14
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,292
Please stop with this circus.

15
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:48,836
Think of how much
I spent on Vienna.

16
00:01:48,878 --> 00:01:51,630
Yes, but I had a dinner
with the Habsburg. Right?

17
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:54,458
You have no idea how
important these contacts are.

18
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:58,887
You can't buy prestige cheaply.
You just can't.

19
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:04,392
<I>"We are hungry.</I>
<I>We are hungry."</I>

20
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:09,397
Look what I have to bear with!

21
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:58,238
I want Varadin to go there.
He can do it.

22
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:01,491
Varadin has to go to London.

23
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,952
13.

24
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,518
<I>It was Thursday.</I>
<I>Like any other...</I>

25
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:33,398
<I>The duty-free shop in the embassy</I>
<I>was opened from 10 to 12am, as usual...</I>

26
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:36,026
<I>For trusted customers only.</I>

27
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:41,739
<I>Despite the negative stories,</I>
<I>it was just a form of mutual assistance</I>

28
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,575
<I>in the spirit of best</I>
<I>corporate traditions.</I>

29
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:50,581
<I>The turnover of the duty-free</I>
<I>shop came to £12,545</I>

30
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:53,876
<I>for the first six months of the year.</I>

31
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,421
<I>This would be mainly by selling</I>
<I>rakia, beer and cigarettes</I>

32
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:01,675
<I>from the diplomatic quota which</I>
<I>was rather hard to acquire.</I>

33
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:15,022
<I>In the meantime, Sir Dee Garber -</I>
<I>chairman of the National Defense Commission,</I>

34
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:17,733
<I>had found some disturbing</I>
<I>figures in the budget.</I>

35
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:22,947
<I>This led to a further four-year delay</I>
<I>of strategic European project</I>

36
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:25,449
<I>for a combat jet,</I>
<I>named "Eurofighter".</I>

37
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:34,792
<I>The deficit amount was... £12,545.</I>

38
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:38,212
<I>This money wasn't</I>
<I>so big of an issue,</I>

39
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:43,133
<I>but the bad tendency that could</I>
<I>lead to undesirable consequences.</I>

40
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,056
<I>Counsellor Mavrodiev have also found</I>

41
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:52,268
<I>some serious loopholes in the budget</I>
<I>of his business establishment.</I>

42
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:53,168
Piss off.

43
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:56,313
You have debts to pay off first.

44
00:04:56,438 --> 00:04:59,024
- Come on, I'll pay you tomorrow.
- I'm really tired of actors.

45
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:02,236
<I>But unlike the chairman of NDA,</I>
<I>the Counsellor had a very</I>

46
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:04,738
<I>clear idea of where that</I>
<I>deficit came from.</I>

47
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,075
<I>This led to a further four-month delay</I>

48
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:10,536
<I>in the purchase</I>
<I>of new vacuum cleaner.</I>

49
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:14,748
I'm begging you, just one pack? I'm
shooting an advertisement on Tuesday.

50
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,911
We are fellow Bulgarians.
We need to help each other.

51
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:19,670
Yes, we are.
But only after you pay.

52
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,088
How much?
- "How much?"

53
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:24,091
Wait a minute. I'm not a calculator.
Calm down.

54
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:26,927
<I>While the Counsellor was trying to</I>
<I>reduce the commercial deficit,</I>

55
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,097
<I>the small and committed team at</I>
<I>the embassy was enjoying</I>

56
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:34,309
<I>the last moments of the sheer anarchy</I>
<I>in the last few months.</I>

57
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:37,437
<I>The squabbles between the employees</I>
<I>were almost absent.</I>

58
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:42,233
<I>An untypical spirit of friendliness and</I>
<I>unity could be felt among people.</I>

59
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:45,195
<I>Everyone had their piece of happiness.</I>

60
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:48,031
<I>They also had one common trait -</I>

61
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,491
<I>There was no boss.</I>

62
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,920
Do you know what I heard about
the new Embassador?

63
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,090
Well... president's wife was
soliciting for his appointment here.

64
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:08,593
Next, please.

65
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:19,687
Five packs of cigarettes, a box of
rakia and four packs of beer.

66
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:22,941
Are you guys preparing
for a deluge to come?

67
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,903
Just in case if the new Embassador
decides to close the duty-free.

68
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:28,821
We've been waiting for him
for six months.

69
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,199
What's the problem
with the duty-free?

70
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,701
Five of everything!

71
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,038
Is this the so-called
"duty-free"?

72
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:44,886
I don't want to scare you, but
I think the new one is coming today.

73
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,049
We just received a telegram.

74
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:07,318
Hello?

75
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:12,532
OK, I'll wake her up now.

76
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:16,411
Katia?

77
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,540
Hey, Katia?
Wake up!

78
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,919
Katia?

79
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:33,218
The secretary is looking for you
urgently. The Embassador has

80
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:35,512
arrived so they need
you to clean the cabinet.

81
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:37,055
Can you take my shift?

82
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:40,934
You're hanging around all night and then
you want me to do your job?!

83
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:44,563
It's in your area.
Come on, get up.

84
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,787
77.

85
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:15,844
65.

86
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,117
90.

87
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:52,589
Oh, you scared me.

88
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:57,282
I'm here to clean up.

89
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,637
You don't look like cleaner.

90
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,722
I'm a student.
Just helping here.

91
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:04,560
I think that even a month wouldn't
be enough to clean up this...

92
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:05,727
warehouse.

93
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,480
I clean wherever they say.
There hasn't been anyone here

94
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,191
for six months and..., by the way,
while we use this banger,

95
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,817
it would never be clean.

96
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:13,860
Pardon?

97
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:17,822
The vacuum cleaner is rubbish.
It's like thousand years old.

98
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,075
Well,...

99
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:22,410
Katia.

100
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:24,412
Katia...

101
00:09:24,495 --> 00:09:26,998
Why don't you write a report?

102
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,543
Describe the problem and I'll
give my best to solve it.

103
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:34,589
You can go.

104
00:09:34,672 --> 00:09:38,801
I don't want you to clean during
working hours or while I'm absent.

105
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:43,264
Embassador Dimitrov.

106
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:45,266
You are already at work?

107
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:46,559
Well done.

108
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:49,645
You haven't forgotten
me, have you? - How could I.

109
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:53,733
I feel that someone in that embassy
is ruining my reputation on purpose.

110
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,359
What do I want so much?

111
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,612
It's not like I'm doing it
for myself.

112
00:09:57,653 --> 00:09:59,322
What kind of people are these...

113
00:09:59,322 --> 00:10:01,741
Look...
I have just arrived and...

114
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:05,536
You all say the same.
I hope you're different.

115
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,331
Listen to me, Varadin.

116
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:11,042
It's not so important
when you've arrived.

117
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,878
It's important when you leave.

118
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:14,729
Hey, Pasty!

119
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:19,484
Yeah, yeah...

120
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,628
Actor boy...
I brought the stock.

121
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:46,428
Stock has arrived.
Come on.

122
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:51,975
I have bad news.

123
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:54,769
I think they're going to
close down the Duty.

124
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:57,480
Leave it. Let them close it.
I don't care.

125
00:11:57,606 --> 00:12:00,525
So from where are we going
to buy stock? - Don't worry.

126
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:02,611
I have something in mind.

127
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:05,488
However,...
I need a warehouse.

128
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:07,115
It's going to be a big hit.

129
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:08,867
What kind of warehouse?

130
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:11,647
If you are thinking about the
embassy, leave it.

131
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,414
You saw the new one.
He's nuts.

132
00:12:14,497 --> 00:12:17,125
I don't think he's going to
rummage through the kitchen.

133
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:21,296
Who knows? He came without
warning. He's nuts, I'm telling you.

134
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:55,806
This is for my bill.

135
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:04,023
This is the Duck.
The big boss.

136
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:06,483
Everything goes through him.

137
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:10,321
R U S S I A

138
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:11,947
Who's this?

139
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:14,408
This is Kosta.
He's our man.

140
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:16,994
He lives in the embassy.

141
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:19,955
If you're thinking something about the
embassy, you better find some other place.

142
00:14:19,955 --> 00:14:24,084
Don't screw it, conhead.
I've guaranteed for you.

143
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:27,213
What's up?

144
00:14:27,254 --> 00:14:29,840
Everything is fine.

145
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:33,611
Good morning.

146
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,199
I'm glad you're on time.

147
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:45,248
Come on.

148
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,667
Good morning.
Am I late?

149
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:02,223
I'm sorry.
I'll clean it.

150
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,729
Leave it.

151
00:16:08,563 --> 00:16:10,899
I have to announce
something unpleasant.

152
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:14,194
Sofia thinks that it's an
anarchy situation out here.

153
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:16,571
Your local self-government had

154
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:19,741
led to some unusual initiatives.

155
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:23,453
Mr. Mavrodiev, I'll ask you to
hand me over the inventory

156
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:25,205
of the so-called "duty-free".

157
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:29,626
We were thinking
about buying presents...

158
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,170
For the kids...
For Christmas.

159
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:34,838
That's alright...
But Christmas is far away.

160
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:38,717
The funds will be
allocated by me.

161
00:16:38,752 --> 00:16:41,595
Moreover, the embassy is not
active enough in building

162
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:43,514
of the new image of Bulgaria.

163
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:46,308
We lack high-level contacts.

164
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:50,521
What's happening with
Mrs. Selianska's initiative?

165
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:53,318
We're working on the matter.

166
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:56,026
Then why it's been cancelled twice?

167
00:16:56,068 --> 00:17:00,072
We're still unable to arrange
a royal family presence for it.

168
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:01,698
Pardon?

169
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:04,482
I've sent ten emails to
Buckingham Palace, but...

170
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:05,619
And what?

171
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:08,631
Well, look, I'm corresponding
with one very polite lady

172
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:12,167
but she obviously doesn't deliver
everything to the Queen.

173
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:14,586
You know, a typical secretary.

174
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:15,671
So we've been rejected.

175
00:17:15,671 --> 00:17:19,049
Exactly. We have some
communication. We keep in touch...

176
00:17:19,132 --> 00:17:21,134
Bunchev!
You're not allowed

177
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:23,345
to send any emails anymore.

178
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:26,515
From now on,
I'm dealing with that.

179
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:29,434
Okay.

180
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:32,855
As you know,

181
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:36,942
the European Conference is
about to open soon.

182
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,362
The President and members of

183
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:44,032
the parliament are going to attend it.

184
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,659
I'm warning you...

185
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:48,370
I'm not going to
tolerate any blunders.

186
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:50,831
The windows are not clean.

187
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:39,462
Any progress with that matter?

188
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,130
With the Queen?

189
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:45,092
My wife has some pretty big
expectations for that reception.

190
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:47,220
Working on it.

191
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:50,890
We were a bit busy with
this conference.

192
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:54,852
But I have to warn you that
it's going to be pretty expensive.

193
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:59,690
You know my wife. When
she has something in mind...

194
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:03,402
Try to find whoever she wants.
Just to get her calm down.

195
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:07,114
Money is not a matter.

196
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:22,355
Is my speech ready?

197
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,316
The speech?
- What?

198
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,776
The speech?

199
00:20:28,486 --> 00:20:30,864
I'll check it out.

200
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:37,579
Where is it?
- I gave it.

201
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:39,831
Whom?
- One polite Romanian.

202
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,917
What Romanian?
Who is he?

203
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,628
- Well, from the Romanian...
- What is his name?

204
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:47,464
You don't know?!
Are you out of your mind?!

205
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:04,189
He gave it to someone from
the Romanian embassy.

206
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:06,900
- What's that?
- The speech.

207
00:21:06,942 --> 00:21:08,568
Some very polite man.

208
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,154
- Who did it?
- Punchev.

209
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:13,657
Twenty minutes ago.

210
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,033
Freaks.

211
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:16,618
They may bring it.

212
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:20,038
They may?! The President's
speech is in ten minutes.

213
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:22,791
Don't worry.
We'll find it.

214
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,710
We always do.

215
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:33,885
59.

216
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,797
100.

217
00:23:57,443 --> 00:24:00,113
Do you think my speech
was well received?

218
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:01,614
Mr. President.

219
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:04,284
Your wife.
It's urgent.

220
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:06,452
I can't speak now.

221
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:08,913
No, no, no.
It wouldn't be a problem.

222
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:12,125
He's with me now.
I have to go.

223
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:19,966
Mrs. Selianska relies very much
on you, you should know that.

224
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:09,212
Yes?

225
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:15,134
What kind of visa do you want
so late, you cunt!

226
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,512
Did it occur to you now?

227
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:33,527
You rule, Pasty.

228
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,987
The stock is over here.

229
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:38,657
Look, boys...

230
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,785
What if something bad happens?

231
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,038
I think I'm out of this.

232
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:46,915
It's too late, Pasty.

233
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:49,417
You're out of time.

234
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:53,296
It's working fine.

235
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:56,842
Take this, you fool.

236
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:02,639
I told you it'd be a big hit.

237
00:30:03,723 --> 00:30:06,101
The Chinese will get them
for £30 each.

238
00:30:06,518 --> 00:30:07,853
Are they alive?

239
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:11,314
Well... I overdosed them
with diaseptyl.

240
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:14,276
They are falling like flies.
Just like flies.

241
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:16,653
Who was the one who came
up with the idea of diaseptyl, huh?

242
00:30:16,653 --> 00:30:19,072
Are you insane?!

243
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,741
What? Come on.

244
00:33:09,782 --> 00:33:13,161
Fuck that. What do you want
me to do now? To butcher them?

245
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:15,622
- This is on your part.
- No, I'm on duty.

246
00:33:15,622 --> 00:33:18,291
Someone may come here
and we're fucked.

247
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,251
Okay, then... I'll do it.

248
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:23,046
Chavo, wait. It's not
so simple.

249
00:33:23,129 --> 00:33:24,589
You go to the duty room.

250
00:33:24,589 --> 00:33:27,509
If you see someone coming,
give us a yell.

251
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:35,183
- Stop looking them, man. Go on.
- Yeah, yeah.

252
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:19,686
I was just wondering is this that
pretty lady with the vacuum cleaner.

253
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:23,773
So I'm "the lady with
the vacuum cleaner"?

254
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:27,318
I'm sorry.
You disappeared, Katia?

255
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,655
You told me to go only
when you're not there.

256
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:33,491
Is that what I said?

257
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:37,036
Anyway... Where are you
heading to at this time?

258
00:34:37,245 --> 00:34:39,747
I'm waiting for the bus.

259
00:34:40,707 --> 00:34:44,002
Let's walk? It's not far,
I'll accompany you.

260
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:47,172
I thought you were
taking a taxi.

261
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,925
A little bit of fresh air
will be good for me.

262
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,367
Catch it!

263
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,287
Door!
Close the door!

264
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,638
It turns out it's not
that close.

265
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,682
Distances in London are
very tricky.

266
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,186
What a strange day for me...

267
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:47,147
Started so terribly and then...

268
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:49,233
Everything got to normal.

269
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:53,737
My day also started miserably,
I'm now dining with the Embassador.

270
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:55,656
I'm sorry I'm not able to offer you

271
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:57,574
something better at this time.

272
00:35:57,658 --> 00:36:01,787
I'm cool. There's nothing better
than a cheesecake at midnight.

273
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:06,625
By the way, it's great that
you closed down the duty-free.

274
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:10,712
Finally, a principal decision but
they are just not able to get over it.

275
00:36:10,747 --> 00:36:14,383
Actually, what do you study?

276
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:18,637
At Laban Dancing Centre.
Contemporary ballet.

277
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:22,474
Excuse me.

278
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:38,157
I wouldn't...

279
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,617
Don't...

280
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,829
That's right.

281
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:53,754
So... you clean the embassy in
exchange for not paying a rent?

282
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:55,965
I wouldn't say it's that bad offer.

283
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:58,176
Nevertheless, I live in Kensington.

284
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:02,889
If you find a job as a dancer, you
would be able to live in Kensington.

285
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,187
This one is not bad.

286
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:19,071
Yes?

287
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,324
<I>We've got a problem.</I>
<I>The Embassador is here.</I>

288
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:24,243
We're completely fucked now.

289
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:31,876
Fucking idiot!

290
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,506
Well...

291
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:41,260
We'll see each other
at the reception on Friday.

292
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:52,855
Thank you for accompanying me.

293
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,942
What about the new
vacuum cleaner?

294
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:58,736
Yes, for that as well.

295
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:15,336
Yes?

296
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:20,049
It's clean.

297
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,123
Come on.
Not much left.

298
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:29,784
Come on, Pasty.
Stop fooling around.

299
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:34,498
How long should I wait?
The day almost broke.

300
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,918
What happened here?

301
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:42,255
It's time to go.

302
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,864
Channel?

303
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:54,285
So this embassador
is very interesting.

304
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,329
Stop it.
I bought that.

305
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:02,293
I'm wondering... If you can
afford these things, why

306
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,961
are you still here?

307
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:07,548
You are taking the place of
someone who really needs it.

308
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:09,633
You're not even a student.

309
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:14,346
Don't worry. I will be
out of this hole soon.

310
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,148
Good evening.

311
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,868
The Macedonians in Bulgaria

312
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:39,497
should fight even more for
their rights -

313
00:41:39,532 --> 00:41:41,457
democratic and human rights.

314
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,458
Pasty?

315
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,335
Thank you.

316
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,546
It's not like a cheesecake,
but still tasty.

317
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,091
The pasty is not bad.

318
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,803
As a matter of fact, don't you
think that pasty is one of

319
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:58,891
these things which are evidence
for the common origin of our nations?

320
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,485
Excuse me.

321
00:47:39,145 --> 00:47:43,858
Mr. Embassador, as you requested,
I made a small research.

322
00:47:48,362 --> 00:47:52,115
I accidentally found a website
and examined some of the stuff.

323
00:47:52,574 --> 00:47:55,702
- Banicharov.
- Please?

324
00:47:55,827 --> 00:47:58,205
Well done.

325
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:16,884
What's up, Racho?

326
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:22,181
Open it.

327
00:50:22,264 --> 00:50:24,975
Why, Racho?
It's empty.

328
00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:27,478
Open it.

329
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:35,653
Why don't we have
some rakia, huh?

330
00:50:35,653 --> 00:50:39,907
Stop fooling me.
Open it.

331
00:50:52,086 --> 00:50:53,212
Empty, huh?

332
00:50:53,295 --> 00:50:55,673
Where did these come from?

333
00:50:56,382 --> 00:50:59,510
- From the market.
- The market, huh?

334
00:51:08,477 --> 00:51:09,645
Give me a knife.

335
00:51:09,645 --> 00:51:12,022
I will.

336
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:31,000
What's going on here?

337
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:35,336
Where did these come from?
Banicharov?

338
00:51:36,337 --> 00:51:39,632
- He's in a deep trouble.
- Where did you get them from?

339
00:51:39,716 --> 00:51:43,928
Some friends left them in the freezer
just for a couple of days.

340
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,930
Just a good deal.

341
00:51:46,014 --> 00:51:49,142
How could I know about the
microphones in their assholes?!

342
00:51:49,184 --> 00:51:51,394
I told you not to deal with
that scum Chavo.

343
00:51:51,394 --> 00:51:52,729
I know.

344
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:55,857
What are we doing now?
They'll send us back in Sofia.

345
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,067
Racho, please think of something.

346
00:51:58,109 --> 00:52:01,237
We have to get
rid of them right now.

347
00:52:02,572 --> 00:52:04,324
Let's break them, huh?

348
00:52:04,365 --> 00:52:07,785
Get out of here with this thing.

349
00:52:07,827 --> 00:52:10,079
Give me some bread.

350
00:52:10,205 --> 00:52:12,790
- What?
- Bread.

351
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:15,210
I will.

352
00:52:31,643 --> 00:52:34,270
Come on. Here.
Eat it.

353
00:52:36,689 --> 00:52:39,275
This is not a chicken, Banicharov.

354
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:43,738
Come on, let's go.

355
00:52:43,738 --> 00:52:45,281
Calm down.

356
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:48,034
Like the old times.
Just watch now.

357
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:22,419
Hello? Mr. Embassador.

358
00:54:22,503 --> 00:54:26,673
You've a meeting with Mr. Thomas
Murrow from Famous Connections.

359
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,165
You escaped to London,
but we've found you.

360
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:11,628
What's up?

361
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:17,050
- The Duck has been killed.
- What?

362
00:57:17,926 --> 00:57:20,595
They killed him.
Just round the corner.

363
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:21,930
Just few moments ago.

364
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,723
So what about the ducks?

365
00:57:23,765 --> 00:57:26,893
Leave the ducks. This is the
Russian mafia.

366
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:32,107
Do you know that we found
tracking transmitters in the ducks?

367
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:35,527
Fuck.

368
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:37,988
It must be KGB then.

369
00:57:38,864 --> 00:57:40,866
Pasty...
We must get rid of these ducks.

370
00:57:40,866 --> 00:57:43,660
Now way. I got through
so much. We can't do that.

371
00:57:43,695 --> 00:57:45,704
What happened with the Chinese?

372
00:57:45,745 --> 00:57:49,499
The Duck was dealing with it.

373
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:58,049
Anyway...
I know some Serbians.

374
00:57:58,467 --> 00:58:00,844
- Our men.
- Serbians?

375
00:58:00,886 --> 00:58:04,097
Are they going to make
pljeskavica of them?

376
00:59:28,764 --> 00:59:31,644
In my opinion, the media
is the most important thing.

377
00:59:31,684 --> 00:59:36,272
The icon exhibition in Madrid
went through all the newspapers.

378
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:38,440
Such a furor.

379
00:59:38,524 --> 00:59:41,235
Now we're about to
do the same in Japan.

380
00:59:42,486 --> 00:59:44,321
What happened with your idea?

381
00:59:44,405 --> 00:59:46,490
You were preparing something in
London, weren't you?

382
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:49,326
I heard that even the
Queen is going to attend it.

383
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:51,787
We're working on it.
Excuse me, please.

384
01:00:00,212 --> 01:00:03,841
Just between us, she's
been rejected.

385
01:00:03,883 --> 01:00:06,302
That's terrible.

386
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:12,649
Yes?

387
01:00:12,683 --> 01:00:14,018
Liar.

388
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:17,271
What do you think?
You're untouchable now?

389
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:20,065
When are you going to stop
playing games with me?

390
01:00:20,107 --> 01:00:22,985
You're worthless like the others.

391
01:00:23,068 --> 01:00:24,612
How dumb I was to believe you.

392
01:00:24,612 --> 01:00:28,324
Divorina, calm down.
We've got positive answer. - What?

393
01:00:28,365 --> 01:00:31,952
I have hired a PR agency
with highest level contacts.

394
01:00:32,036 --> 01:00:34,788
She will come?
When?

395
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:38,959
We're now arranging the date
but it's not going to be cheap.

396
01:00:39,084 --> 01:00:41,462
Screw that.

397
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:44,589
It can be as
expensive as it has to be.

398
01:00:50,512 --> 01:00:51,930
Excuse me.

399
01:00:52,013 --> 01:00:54,974
Can I have a strawberry sourve?

400
01:00:55,016 --> 01:00:56,851
Thank you.

401
01:00:56,976 --> 01:00:58,895
I think that...

402
01:00:58,978 --> 01:01:02,482
I'll have to go to London soon.

403
01:01:02,524 --> 01:01:05,318
Well done.
- Great.

404
01:02:13,052 --> 01:02:15,430
1, 2, 3, 4...

405
01:02:19,184 --> 01:02:21,019
Hey, Ivan!

406
01:02:21,144 --> 01:02:25,190
Why are you dangling that
pike, for fuck's sake?!

407
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:27,275
You're ancient Bulgarian warriors.

408
01:02:27,317 --> 01:02:30,737
You've just cut Nikifor's head off.

409
01:02:31,029 --> 01:02:33,448
Again.

410
01:02:34,157 --> 01:02:36,241
1, 2, 3, 4...

411
01:02:36,283 --> 01:02:38,702
Keep up the pike, Ivan!

412
01:02:51,423 --> 01:02:53,884
What the hell are you doing?

413
01:02:53,967 --> 01:02:56,345
Stop!

414
01:02:57,888 --> 01:03:00,974
Our Patron, Mrs. Selianska

415
01:03:01,058 --> 01:03:02,559
is here to see us.

416
01:03:02,601 --> 01:03:05,354
I'm here to inform you...

417
01:03:05,437 --> 01:03:08,607
We're going to London.
Everything is arranged.

418
01:03:08,649 --> 01:03:12,444
You're going to dance in front
of an audience you've only dreamed of.

419
01:03:12,528 --> 01:03:14,863
What? She'll come?

420
01:03:14,905 --> 01:03:16,573
Yes.

421
01:03:16,657 --> 01:03:19,451
- It's confirmed.
- Great.

422
01:03:19,535 --> 01:03:23,330
By the way, I'm holding talks with
a potential presenter. Know who?

423
01:03:23,372 --> 01:03:26,542
Who? - Chavdar Tulumanov.
The Bulgarian De Niro.

424
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:28,338
He's in London, as you know.

425
01:03:28,377 --> 01:03:31,255
He's a big celebrity.
Is he going to accept?

426
01:03:31,296 --> 01:03:34,424
Well, Chavo is a star, but
we used to live together.

427
01:03:34,459 --> 01:03:37,928
Not to mention that the
Queen will attend it.

428
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:40,848
It's absolutely sure.
But this isn't everything.

429
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:43,976
It is going to be
spectacular this time.

430
01:03:44,017 --> 01:03:46,145
I've introduced some
new elements.

431
01:03:46,228 --> 01:03:48,647
World-class scenography.

432
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:52,818
No lifestyle decoration at all.
Just fire. Real explosion!

433
01:03:52,901 --> 01:03:57,531
By the way... Let me
introduce you to our artist. Kalki.

434
01:03:57,614 --> 01:04:01,243
He's also known as
"dancing with the fire".

435
01:04:02,578 --> 01:04:04,955
Kalkin. Designer.

436
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,124
Designer.

437
01:04:07,207 --> 01:04:09,168
Fire designer.

438
01:04:09,251 --> 01:04:14,381
I'm more popular abroad.
This is my last installation.

439
01:04:14,465 --> 01:04:16,300
"Ibiza by night."

440
01:04:16,425 --> 01:04:23,765
Just imagine it. Ibiza island...
Prometey, blasting fire from his heart,

441
01:04:23,849 --> 01:04:26,642
to proclaim the beginning of a new era.

442
01:04:26,851 --> 01:04:29,604
The era of the flaming Aquarius.

443
01:04:29,687 --> 01:04:33,774
A true fairy-scene of
fire and water.

444
01:04:33,858 --> 01:04:37,487
Ragrade One.
Fire World magazine.

445
01:04:37,737 --> 01:04:40,823
- Really interesting.
- You'll see.

446
01:04:40,907 --> 01:04:44,368
We'll show damn
England how we do it.

447
01:04:44,452 --> 01:04:45,620
Well done.

448
01:04:45,703 --> 01:04:48,080
Again!

449
01:04:55,505 --> 01:04:57,048
You're not taking this?

450
01:04:57,089 --> 01:05:01,093
Take it, if it suits you.
Have you seen a folder here?

451
01:05:01,427 --> 01:05:04,972
- What are you doing
at work exactly? - PR.

452
01:05:05,014 --> 01:05:07,683
- So you got someone, huh?
- Maybe.

453
01:05:07,725 --> 01:05:09,602
English?

454
01:05:09,685 --> 01:05:12,688
Are you sure you haven't
seen any folder here?

455
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:17,193
What folder?
I'm not going through your stuff.

456
01:05:18,152 --> 01:05:20,530
I must have left it
in the agency.

457
01:05:22,156 --> 01:05:25,493
You want me to tell the
Embassador something, huh?

458
01:05:26,661 --> 01:05:29,038
Bye!

459
01:05:56,524 --> 01:05:59,235
I don't need your rubbish.

460
01:06:44,446 --> 01:06:47,657
I'm not really sure that
Serbians like ducks, but...

461
01:06:47,699 --> 01:06:51,828
We need to bag the money.
I don't care about the rest.

462
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:54,080
To be honest, Chinese
were the best option.

463
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,333
Well...

464
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:59,628
Even though I know one
Serbian who eats ducks.

465
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:03,089
It's Dragan, isn't he?
- You've been there too?

466
01:07:09,012 --> 01:07:11,217
If it was pork,
it'd have been better.

467
01:07:11,264 --> 01:07:14,684
What are we going to do with ducks?
They cannot be used for pljeskavica.

468
01:07:14,684 --> 01:07:17,103
It doesn't work.

469
01:07:25,153 --> 01:07:27,989
Ducks are not in our mentalitet.

470
01:07:31,618 --> 01:07:35,247
Fuck.
You always screw up. Monkey!

471
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:37,707
Stay cool.

472
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:41,128
Rest in peace, Duck.

473
01:08:03,191 --> 01:08:05,610
Good day.

474
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:24,879
I'm sorry, Mr. Embassador.
I'm almost finished.

475
01:08:26,505 --> 01:08:29,842
Sorry but it was a big mess here.

476
01:08:31,886 --> 01:08:34,346
Isn't this your colleague's area?

477
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:38,267
You want only her in charge
for your cabinet?

478
01:08:38,893 --> 01:08:41,145
Yes, I do...

479
01:08:41,187 --> 01:08:42,813
I do want to be clean.

480
01:08:42,855 --> 01:08:46,775
Because she's not living here
anymore. She moved out.

481
01:08:46,817 --> 01:08:47,985
How come she moved out?

482
01:08:47,985 --> 01:08:50,446
She wasn't supposed to be here.

483
01:08:50,488 --> 01:08:53,991
Why?
- Well, she quit university last year.

484
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:55,826
She shouldnt have been allowed
to work here, but

485
01:08:55,826 --> 01:08:57,369
the secretary decided to leave her.

486
01:08:57,369 --> 01:08:59,705
Look, I'm not interested in gossips.

487
01:08:59,789 --> 01:09:02,958
Well, I'm just warning you.

488
01:09:04,043 --> 01:09:06,428
Katia's doing something
very suspicious...

489
01:09:06,462 --> 01:09:09,340
I think it's porn movies.

490
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:11,801
Have a look.

491
01:09:14,804 --> 01:09:17,431
The boxes have arrived.
- What boxes?

492
01:09:17,515 --> 01:09:20,309
Major Ullaf's boxes,
from Humanitarian Affairs.

493
01:09:20,351 --> 01:09:23,437
Seventy seven boxes
have just arrived.

494
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:25,898
What is in them?

495
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:29,318
- I don't know.
- Then who knows?

496
01:09:30,444 --> 01:09:33,072
I don't know.
I'll check them now.

497
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:38,452
I'm done.

498
01:13:22,674 --> 01:13:25,093
What do you think you
are doing, Banicharov?

499
01:13:25,093 --> 01:13:26,178
What?

500
01:13:26,261 --> 01:13:28,222
We've again got duck
for dinner today.

501
01:13:28,222 --> 01:13:31,809
We'll eat it. We've got to use
them for something.

502
01:13:31,892 --> 01:13:34,311
That's nonsense.
It's an expensive food.

503
01:13:34,346 --> 01:13:37,855
We shouldn't waste it like that.
You must sell it.

504
01:13:37,939 --> 01:13:41,025
- Chavo is dealing with this.
- Get rid of this scum!

505
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:44,904
Hey, Nory...

506
01:13:44,946 --> 01:13:46,989
How about giving
me a Big Ben?

507
01:13:47,031 --> 01:13:49,450
I can't.
I have a headache.

508
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:54,914
How do you see this thing?

509
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:59,836
New costumes, special effects,
pyrotechnics...

510
01:13:59,877 --> 01:14:04,006
Your show has cost me
almost as half of my campaign!

511
01:14:04,048 --> 01:14:07,343
Excuse me? I want to remind
you that my reception

512
01:14:07,385 --> 01:14:10,972
is to be honored by her majesty
the Queen of Britain.

513
01:14:11,055 --> 01:14:14,642
It's a once in your life event.

514
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,731
Perhaps I'd better come
with you in London, huh?

515
01:14:20,815 --> 01:14:22,150
You've nothing to do there!

516
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:24,569
It is my initiative.

517
01:15:28,256 --> 01:15:33,470
You're doing quite good with
the vacuum cleaner, your Majesty.

518
01:15:37,224 --> 01:15:40,435
You must have been successful

519
01:15:40,477 --> 01:15:43,605
in dancing round a pylon
as well, I guess.

520
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:50,195
It seems that...

521
01:15:50,237 --> 01:15:53,782
Playing the student role...

522
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:59,079
Isn't your best performance.

523
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,039
Oh, so...

524
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:03,688
It looks like Mr. Embassador
hired a princess.

525
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:06,795
- I'm not a client.
- Really?

526
01:16:06,837 --> 01:16:10,257
It must be one of your
professional responsibilities.

527
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:12,634
Look, love...

528
01:16:12,676 --> 01:16:15,554
It's not about your pretty bum.

529
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:18,056
Then what is it about?

530
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:21,643
Don't pretend to be stupid.

531
01:16:24,938 --> 01:16:27,732
Someone is trying to scam me.

532
01:16:29,401 --> 01:16:31,403
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

533
01:16:31,403 --> 01:16:34,531
Let's stick to the script.

534
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:46,376
You're part of it.

535
01:16:46,418 --> 01:16:49,004
Is that what you think?

536
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,504
What's up with the press?
Why there's no one here?

537
01:20:19,587 --> 01:20:21,965
This was a special requirement
from the palace.

538
01:20:21,965 --> 01:20:25,009
We can't risk with that.
- Not even a column in an article?

539
01:20:25,009 --> 01:20:28,179
No. Otherwise, our
agreement will be terminated.

540
01:20:28,221 --> 01:20:31,307
Her Majesty is trying to
avoid cheap publicity.

541
01:20:31,349 --> 01:20:34,227
I hate cheap publicity too.
I hate it.

542
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:37,147
- I know.
- I'm very nervous.

543
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:40,191
- I want everything to be perfect.
- I know.

544
01:20:40,233 --> 01:20:42,485
- Even the slightest detail.
- I know.

545
01:20:42,527 --> 01:20:45,071
People always miss something.

546
01:20:45,155 --> 01:20:47,532
Oh, of course!

547
01:20:48,283 --> 01:20:50,702
- Menu?
- I don't know.

548
01:20:50,785 --> 01:20:53,163
You don't know...

549
01:21:01,253 --> 01:21:03,630
Fuck.

550
01:21:04,798 --> 01:21:06,675
Banicharov speaking.

551
01:21:06,758 --> 01:21:09,261
Who're you?
Oh, yes.

552
01:21:09,761 --> 01:21:11,346
Yes.

553
01:21:11,472 --> 01:21:13,098
I'm coming.

554
01:21:13,182 --> 01:21:14,892
Sandwiches?!

555
01:21:14,933 --> 01:21:17,811
You're going to serve
her Majesty sandwiches?!

556
01:21:17,853 --> 01:21:20,105
This is an absurd, Varadin!

557
01:21:20,147 --> 01:21:23,108
Why? This country
has some sacred

558
01:21:23,192 --> 01:21:25,944
standards regarding sandwiches.

559
01:21:25,986 --> 01:21:28,405
Come in.

560
01:21:30,532 --> 01:21:34,036
You wanted to discuss
the menu with me.

561
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:35,496
Fish, maybe.

562
01:21:35,579 --> 01:21:38,832
At the Dutch Queen's
reception they served

563
01:21:38,916 --> 01:21:40,876
sea-cat's tail with
orange sauce.

564
01:21:40,876 --> 01:21:43,754
And a starter of oysters.

565
01:21:44,546 --> 01:21:47,132
What does the Queen like?

566
01:21:47,549 --> 01:21:52,930
Did anyone bother to find out
what the Queen likes? Huh?

567
01:21:53,013 --> 01:21:55,557
Maybe just some traditional
Bulgarian dish.

568
01:21:55,599 --> 01:21:58,310
Like carp dish.
- Carp dish?

569
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:04,316
Don't make me laugh,...
What was your name?

570
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:05,692
Banicharov.

571
01:22:05,734 --> 01:22:06,735
Banicharov!

572
01:22:06,777 --> 01:22:09,446
These people are aristocrats.

573
01:22:13,909 --> 01:22:16,286
What about game?

574
01:22:16,411 --> 01:22:18,038
The Queen likes hunting.

575
01:22:18,122 --> 01:22:21,166
So it makes sense.
She must love game.

576
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,001
Ducks!

577
01:22:23,085 --> 01:22:25,170
Wild ducks.

578
01:22:25,295 --> 01:22:28,257
With blueberry sauce, fruits
and seed onions.

579
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:30,717
I'll make it incredible!

580
01:22:41,186 --> 01:22:44,606
But I have to admit that
they aren't really cheap.

581
01:22:44,648 --> 01:22:47,067
They're a bit expensive.

582
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:49,735
You see...

583
01:22:49,819 --> 01:22:51,821
Everything is possible.

584
01:22:51,904 --> 01:22:54,407
What you need is
enthusiasm and professionalism.

585
01:22:54,407 --> 01:22:56,659
... And some money.

586
01:22:56,742 --> 01:22:59,162
Yeah. And some money.

587
01:23:18,097 --> 01:23:20,516
1, 2, 3, 4...

588
01:23:24,854 --> 01:23:27,231
Stop!

589
01:23:29,066 --> 01:23:30,276
Hey, cous.

590
01:23:30,318 --> 01:23:33,738
You bastard. You're alive!
Long time no see, huh?

591
01:23:37,366 --> 01:23:39,118
I'm glad you made it.

592
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,995
I know that you're busy.

593
01:23:41,037 --> 01:23:43,414
But I knew you wouldn't miss it.

594
01:23:43,539 --> 01:23:46,125
What do you think
about the role?

595
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:50,171
Well, a "role" is too strong
word but... Take it as a favor.

596
01:23:50,254 --> 01:23:53,841
How are you doing? Working?
What are you up to at the moment?

597
01:23:53,883 --> 01:23:54,926
I'm just relaxing.

598
01:23:54,926 --> 01:23:58,513
I stay at home. My agent is
bringing some scripts to me to read.

599
01:23:58,596 --> 01:24:00,973
You're a boss, huh?

600
01:24:02,225 --> 01:24:03,768
You see? Huh?

601
01:24:03,851 --> 01:24:05,853
Who's the fool now? Huh?

602
01:24:05,937 --> 01:24:08,064
They'll get them for £50 each.

603
01:24:08,106 --> 01:24:10,566
You've finally made
something properly.

604
01:24:10,608 --> 01:24:14,195
But I'll tell Chavo I sold
them for £20... No, £15...

605
01:24:14,278 --> 01:24:16,280
You ain't telling him nothing.

606
01:24:16,364 --> 01:24:19,408
The freezer was out of order,
ducks are gone. That's it.

607
01:24:19,492 --> 01:24:21,869
That's good!

608
01:24:22,203 --> 01:24:23,788
How did you enter in here?

609
01:24:23,788 --> 01:24:26,666
Hello, Pasty.
- Hey, Chavo.

610
01:24:27,667 --> 01:24:30,044
I have some great news.

611
01:24:30,128 --> 01:24:32,672
Delicious gherkins.
Delicious!

612
01:24:32,713 --> 01:24:34,715
Come with me.
I'll make you an offer.

613
01:24:34,715 --> 01:24:37,093
We have work to do, Kostadin.

614
01:24:38,803 --> 01:24:41,304
I sold the ducks, man.

615
01:24:41,847 --> 01:24:43,890
Um, no.

616
01:24:43,974 --> 01:24:46,685
So... some Jews got them.

617
01:24:48,103 --> 01:24:50,522
£10 each.

618
01:24:50,939 --> 01:24:53,817
That's fine but...

619
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:56,236
Something bad happened.

620
01:24:56,278 --> 01:24:58,321
What happened?

621
01:24:58,363 --> 01:25:00,323
They're fucked.

622
01:25:00,449 --> 01:25:03,577
The freezer was
out of order and...

623
01:25:03,952 --> 01:25:06,967
- How come it was out of order?!
- Well... I don't know.

624
01:25:12,252 --> 01:25:15,464
I'll go. Nory is waiting for me.

625
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:27,100
What are these things?

626
01:25:27,142 --> 01:25:29,811
Calm down, man.
The situation is under control.

627
01:25:29,853 --> 01:25:32,272
These are the effects
for the show. And you are?

628
01:25:32,272 --> 01:25:34,232
Who gave you permission to
start a fire in the embassy?

629
01:25:34,232 --> 01:25:36,359
Did you say "fire", man?

630
01:25:36,443 --> 01:25:38,820
This is fire design.

631
01:25:38,904 --> 01:25:40,155
Fire blasters!

632
01:25:40,197 --> 01:25:42,032
Skydivers.

633
01:25:42,073 --> 01:25:44,743
Do you know what
Mrs. Selianska said?

634
01:25:44,785 --> 01:25:47,245
Everything multiplied by two.

635
01:25:47,287 --> 01:25:52,083
Because... You shouldn't be
frugal of arts, man.

636
01:25:53,668 --> 01:25:55,170
Punchev!

637
01:25:55,253 --> 01:25:57,923
Let's check the fire alarm.

638
01:28:49,843 --> 01:28:52,453
We weren't allowed to enter
even as spectators.

639
01:28:52,512 --> 01:28:54,305
They're ashamed of us.

640
01:28:54,389 --> 01:28:56,766
We're only useful for
hanging coats.

641
01:29:10,738 --> 01:29:13,158
Come on. Faster.
You're slow.

642
01:29:55,241 --> 01:29:57,619
Translate.

643
01:30:05,668 --> 01:30:08,463
This event is a valuable
contribution to

644
01:30:08,505 --> 01:30:11,090
the political balance
of our continent.

645
01:30:20,432 --> 01:30:25,229
The friends are our friends,
hence friends of our friends...

646
01:30:34,071 --> 01:30:36,115
Snobs.

647
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,492
Let's go to eat.

648
01:30:38,534 --> 01:30:40,953
Okay.

649
01:31:04,226 --> 01:31:06,270
Wait a minute!

650
01:31:06,311 --> 01:31:09,106
She's here, isn't she?

651
01:31:09,148 --> 01:31:11,692
Fuck. What's happening here?!

652
01:31:11,775 --> 01:31:13,902
They're using
look-alike models.

653
01:31:13,944 --> 01:31:16,238
Like Yeltsin, Brezhnev,
Saddam Hussein...

654
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:18,782
What did you think?
English are not fools.

655
01:31:18,866 --> 01:31:21,952
It's called national security.

656
01:32:00,657 --> 01:32:02,366
So they sent us a look-alike?

657
01:32:02,366 --> 01:32:03,993
Nah...

658
01:32:04,035 --> 01:32:06,871
They must be crazy to send
the real one to these monkeys.

659
01:32:06,871 --> 01:32:08,041
We're the same.

660
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:10,124
Come on, fellas.
Dinner time!

661
01:32:10,208 --> 01:32:12,585
Come on!

662
01:39:43,449 --> 01:39:45,159
The freezer was
out of order, huh?

663
01:39:45,159 --> 01:39:47,494
Disgraceful rat!

664
01:39:47,578 --> 01:39:49,079
You scruffy Bulgarian!

665
01:39:49,121 --> 01:39:51,999
Bulgarians are what
I hate most in the world.

666
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,460
Do you hear me?

667
01:39:54,543 --> 01:39:56,962
I hate them too.

668
01:40:14,938 --> 01:40:17,357
Fucking hell.

669
01:41:15,498 --> 01:41:17,959
So much hard work...

670
01:41:18,042 --> 01:41:20,837
Everything was for nothing.

671
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:23,089
You wanted to invite the media.

672
01:41:23,131 --> 01:41:25,383
I'll apologize to Her.

673
01:41:25,466 --> 01:41:29,053
I'll write a formal letter.

674
01:41:29,095 --> 01:41:32,515
So what are you going to write?

675
01:41:33,391 --> 01:41:35,935
Sorry...
Your Majesty about

676
01:41:36,018 --> 01:41:37,233
not burning you.

677
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:40,773
Don't talk like that, Varadin.

678
01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:44,735
I hope no information
gets leaked.

679
01:41:44,777 --> 01:41:48,281
Journalists always
smell scandals.

680
01:41:53,744 --> 01:41:55,455
Varadin?

681
01:41:55,538 --> 01:41:57,915
What does this mean?

682
01:42:15,349 --> 01:42:18,060
The Queen in Africa?
Absurd!

683
01:42:18,102 --> 01:42:20,229
They gave them some scarecrow.

684
01:42:20,313 --> 01:42:23,191
Tato used look-alike models too.

685
01:43:02,105 --> 01:43:04,357
Vikil is a complete crock.

686
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,609
He'll never be able to
find any sponsors again.

687
01:43:07,651 --> 01:43:09,152
Vikil...

688
01:43:09,236 --> 01:43:11,321
What about the pyroman?

689
01:43:11,446 --> 01:43:14,449
Who brought them here?

690
01:43:20,247 --> 01:43:22,624
Let's go.

691
01:43:35,971 --> 01:43:38,432
Varadin stopped
listening to Selianska.

692
01:43:38,515 --> 01:43:41,685
She was just an annoying
echo of her time.

693
01:43:41,726 --> 01:43:44,521
In few years she would be

694
01:43:44,563 --> 01:43:47,149
gone and forgotten.

695
01:44:22,184 --> 01:44:24,227
In big cities, the probability of

696
01:44:24,311 --> 01:44:26,438
meeting someone who you
want to see

697
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:30,650
usually equals to one
divided by the population.

698
01:44:32,903 --> 01:44:37,574
But even if you happen to be
at the same place at the same time,

699
01:44:37,657 --> 01:44:41,995
the probability of not seeing
each other is at least 99%.

700
01:44:42,329 --> 01:44:45,499
But even if you see each other,
there's no guarantee

701
01:44:45,582 --> 01:44:48,585
that something
will come out of it.
