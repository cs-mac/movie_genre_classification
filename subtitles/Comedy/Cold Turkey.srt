1
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,711
Excuse me.

2
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,067
Pa?

3
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,737
You all right, Pa?

4
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,159
- You're up early.
- I got a big day ahead.

5
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,161
I wish you didn't have to go.

6
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,872
I promised to help this friend.

7
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,916
Goddamn outhouse.

8
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,545
One of these days soon,
I'm changing all that.

9
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,338
Damn soon.

10
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,968
Now, you drive careful now.

11
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,374
Young man? Young man. I'm terribly sorry.

12
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,567
Ma'am, can I have a root beer?

13
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:21,988
- Anything else to go with that?
- Some aspirins, please.

14
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,536
<i>"Friend P. came out in August</i>

15
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,706

22
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,608
Fill her up, buddy.

23
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,403
You sure got a perfect day for it.

24
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,114
- What's that?
- Hunting pheasants.

25
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,117
Yes, indeedy.

26
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,202
Deadeye Dick Hickock?

27
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:14,165
Them birds don't know it,
but this is their last day on Earth.

28
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,307
Good morning, Daddy.

29
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:35,144
- Well, you're up early.
- And I've got a furious day ahead.

30
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,582
'Morning, Dad.

31
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:00,169
- Thought maybe I smelled smoke.
- Yeah.

32
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,506
Me, too. Could be a leaky valve.

33
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,341
Could be.

34
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,097
Peppermints before breakfast
might stunt your growth.

35
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,516
Daddy, phone.

36
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,018
It's the insurance man.

37
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,563
This afternoon, anytime before dark.

38
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,569
Hello?

39
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,781
I want to call the Kansas State Penitentiary.

40
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:35,246
Person-to-person. Rev. James Post.

41
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,208
Rev. James Post.

42
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,545
My name is...

43
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,299
Perry Smith.
He'll be checking in sometime tomorrow.

44
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:51,053
- Can I see the room, please?
- Ain't you working today?

45
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,430
Now, ain't you?

46
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,228
Hello.

47
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,272
Perry.

48
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,233
Of course, I remember you.

49
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,905
Kansas City?

50
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,490
Missouri.

51
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,910
I'm at the bus terminal.

52
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,582
I'm waiting for Willie Jay.

53
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,419
Did something hold up his parole?

54
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,508
- I was supposed to meet him right here.
- Perry, think.

55
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,469
You've already broken parole
by quitting your job.

56
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,139
You'll break it again if you step into Kansas.

57
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,434
Whatever you do,
don't cross that river into Kansas.

58
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,937
Can you tell me where he went?

59
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,275
Please, Jim.

60
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,529
It's very important.

61
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,453
Maybe the most important thing in my life.

62
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,332
Go back. Why not see your father?

63
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,346
'Morning, Ma.

64
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,683
Daddy, you remember Jolene?

65
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,229
Well, I promised to teach her
how to bake a cherry pie.

66
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,065
- Sounds serious.
- She insists on today.

67
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,817
That makes it practically a catastrophe.

68
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,947
Because I also promised
to help Roxy with her trumpet solo.

69
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,742
And errands for Mother in Garden City,
lunch with Susan...

70
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,995
Suppose I take care
of your mother's errands?

71
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,539
Thank you, Daddy.

72
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,810
<i>Also provided for your convenience,

73
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,187

74

76
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,407
<i>Boonville and intermediate flights.</i>

77
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,535
<i>Now boarding at door number six.</i>

78
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,267
Stick 'em up!

79
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,103
- Hey, buddy.
- How long have you been standing there?

80
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,397
Long enough to catch your late late show.

81
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,442
- Just between you and I.
- You and me.

82
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,820
How come you always go into a trance
every time you look in the mirror?

83
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,282
Just like you was looking
at some gorgeous piece of butt.

84
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,120
What in the hell is in here?

85
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,789
Concrete?

86
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:50,959
That's all my stuff. Books, letters, songs.

87
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,462
Souvenirs from Korea.

88
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,465
And our ticket to fame and fortune.

89
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,842
I got a secret map in here
that's going to lead us

90
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,887
straight to the sunken treasure
of Captain Cortés.

91
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:06,225
$60 million in Spanish gold,
off the coast of Mexico.

92
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,685
So, that's why that map's so frigging heavy.

93
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,065
Welcome back to Kansas, buddy.
The heart of America.

94
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,944
The land of wheat, corn, bibles, and

95
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,114
natural gas.

96
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,494
That map's not as heavy as yours,
but it's the real thing.

97
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,289
And it's gonna get us $10,000 by tonight.

98
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,794
Four hundred miles west of here,
Big Daddy Clutter's place.

99
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,257
That's the layout. The works.

100
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,218
Somewhere in that office,
in one little old safe.

101
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,680
And inside that safe, 10 grand, maybe more.

102
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,974
You've seen it?

103
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,268
The safe!

104
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,564
Right after you left the zoo,
a new guy moved into the cell.

105
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,692
Floyd Wells,
serving three to five for robbery.

106
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,028
He once worked for Clutter. He saw it.

107
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,823
And that's your perfect score?

108
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,825
Baby, it's a cinch.

109
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:10,289
I promise you, honey,
we'll blast hair all over them walls.

110
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,930
- 'Morning, Roxy.
- 'Morning, Mr Clutter.

111
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,224
I think Nancy's expecting you.

112
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,560
You want to watch it, boy.
You'll end up an aspirin junkie.

113
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:17,564
Been one for seven years.
Got the habit in the hospital.

114
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,441
Doctors.

115
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,736
They made a dwarf out of me.

116
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,240
Doctors and lawyers. What do they care?

117
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,744
Ever see a millionaire
fry in the electric chair?

118
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,120
Hell, no.

119
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,082
There's two kinds of laws, honey.

120
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,835
One for the rich and one for the poor.

121
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,256
Look at me.

122
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,883
I crack up my car, wake up in a charity ward

123
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,969
and don't even recognise myself.

124
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,347
I hate to count how much classy pussy
that's cost me.

125
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,185
They left you a wonderful smile, though.

126
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,939
Yeah, the all-American boy.

127
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,367
That was stupid.

128
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,912
Stealing a lousy pack of razor blades,
to prove what?

129
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,498
Everybody steals something sometime.

130
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,502
It's the national pastime, baby.
Stealing and cheating.

131
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,380
If they caught every cheating wife
and tax chiseller,

132
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,966
the whole country
would be behind prison walls.

133
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,844
- Where are the black stockings?
- They didn't have black.

134
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,472
- Stop someplace else.
- Where?

135
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,351
- A Catholic hospital.
- Sure.

136
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,437
We'll just barge in like it was
a goddamn five-and-dime.

137
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,066
Sister, sweetie, we gotta have
some black stockings to hide our face.

138
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,651
Okay, forget it.

139
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,945
Anyway, nuns are bad luck.

140
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,032
Kind of sexy, though.

141
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,285
You wouldn't think so if you'd lived
in one of those orphan homes

142
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,996
with those black widows always at you.

143
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,708
Always sneaking up in the dark,
spying while you sleep.

144
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,295
Hitting you with a flashlight
for wetting the bed.

145
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,549
That's the first time
I was saved by the yellow bird.

146
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,051
The what?

147
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,095
Sort of a parrot.

148
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,514
Taller than Jesus.

149
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,684
Brilliant yellow, like a sunflower.

150
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,979
It attacked those nuns
like an avenging angel.

151
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,400
The nuns begged for mercy.

152
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,070
But the yellow bird
slaughtered them anyway.

153
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,741
Then the bird folded me in its wings

154
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,744
and lifted me up to paradise.

155
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,082
That's one hell of a bird
to have on your side.

156
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,129
Anyway, that's why I have
an aversion to nuns

157
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,172
and God and religion.

158
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,301
Forget it.
Black stockings are a waste of time.

159
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,597
No one's gonna remember us
because we're leaving no witnesses.

160
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,719
How about staying at our place tonight?

161
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,346
Frozen stiff TV dinners on trays,

162
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,183
spaghetti, macaroni or pizza.

163
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,894
- Sounds irresistible.
- I'll tell Mom.

164
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,731
<i>- Golly, Sue. C'est impossible.
- Pourquoi, chérie?</i>

165
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,318
- Bobby's coming over.
- I'll pick you up for church tomorrow.

166
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,736
9:00 sharp.

167
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:50,253
A full day's work
deserves a full-course dinner.

168
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,589
The condemned ate a hearty meal.

169
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,301
I don't know what they ate,
but tonight, cheeseburgers.

170
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,928
Tomorrow?

171
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,596
Mexico.

172
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,433
- Fabulous Mexico.
- Land of the hot tamales.

173
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,603
Gold country.

174
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,942
<i>Remember Bogart
in Treasure of the Sierra Madre?</i>

175
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,530
We could get us a couple of burros.

176
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,031
Some tools.

177
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,867
Slow down, honey.
I don't know gold dust from diarrhoea.

178
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,285
Well, I do.

179
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,123
My old man prospected for gold in Alaska.

180
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,961
He taught me all the ins and outs.

181
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,005
Yeah. And we end up nuts.

182
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,051
No gold, nothing. Just like in the movie.

183
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,517
You never meant it

184
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:51,231
about going to Mexico, did you? Did you?

185
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,195
Sure, baby.

186
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,823
Sure we're going.

187
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,536
But first we gotta dig up some capital.
Like tonight.

188
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,832
5,000 bucks a piece, for one hour's work.

189
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,671
- May I take your orders?
- Two cheeseburgers, please.

190
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,351
Getting insured is like,

191
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,646
well, when you wash your car,
it always rains.

192
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,691
Know what we call this
in the insurance game?

193
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,318
The solemn moment.

194
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,947
I guess when a man makes out a policy
or takes out his last will,

195
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:44,034
it's only natural to think about mortality.

196
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:49,039
Herb, as of this minute,
your life is worth $40,000.

197
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,751
In case of accidental death,
double indemnity.

198
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,172
New York Life wishes you
a very long and very healthy life.

199
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,508
- And so do I.
- And so do I.

200
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:13,188
That waitress. Nice piece of blonde chicken.

201
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,857
Why'd you pick me for this job?

202
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,945
A perfect score needs perfect partners.

203
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,238
Together we're a perfect fit.

204
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,533
It's your score. Where do I fit in?

205
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:30,205
I got you figured for a natural-born killer.

206
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,292
Or did you lie about that punk in Vegas?

207
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,379
No.

208
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,589
Why did you kill him?

209
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,551
No special reason. Just for the hell of it.

210
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,262
That's the best reason of all.

211
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,059
Back there, you wanted to kill me.

212
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,311
Just for a second, right?

213
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,398
It passed.

214
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,733
Hair-trigger temper.

215
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,236
Somebody crosses you, voom!

216
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,073
Yes, sir. You've got the gift, boy.

217
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,618
Remember the chaplain's clerk, Willie Jay?

218
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:13,748
- The guy you painted to look like Jesus?
- He said the same thing.

219
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,459
"Unstable, explosive."

220
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,004
He is a flaming faggot.

221
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,256
He has a brilliant mind.

222
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,467
Then how come
he got caught stealing five times?

223
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,764
- He was the best friend I ever had.
- I'm the only friend you got now.

224
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,977
Friend to the end, for better or worse.

225
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,814
Till death do us part?

226
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,775
All we need is a ring, sugar.

227
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,965
- Hi.
- Is that Bobby?

228
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,143
Look at that land, will you?

229
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,979
Oil money, gas money, wheat money.

230
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,149
Share the wealth, baby.

231
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:32,160
<i>Perry.</i>

232
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,538
<i>Perry.</i>

233
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,890
- How does it feel?
- What?

234
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,560
Being a father.

235
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,229
Great.

236
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:45,233
- Your kids, you love them?
- I'm their father, ain't I?

237
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,195
I didn't ask were you their goddamn father.
I asked did you love them.

238
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,905
I'm crazy about 'em.

239
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,658
- But you left them.
- Left their mother.

240
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,079
Okay. She left me.

241
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,124
There was this piece of tail, nothing serious.

242
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,501
Just a quickie in the back seat.

243
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,172
She blew the whistle on me.
Said I knocked her up.

244
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,634
That's how I got to be a two-time loser.

245
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,095
You ditched the kids for her.

246
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:17,932
Jesus, baby.
I had to do the right thing by her, didn't I?

247
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,437
Well? Didn't I?

248
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,772
Yeah.

249
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,786
- 'Night!
- See you tomorrow, Bobby.

250
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,767
- How much longer?
- Seven miles.

251
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,575
Good evening.

252
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,912
Fill her up with regular.

253
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,079
Want some candy?

254
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,290
No.

255
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,086
You okay?

256
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,005
I'm fine.

257
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,510
Coming?

258
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,393
Let's go.

<i>News from the Associated Press,
NBC, and the Garden City Telegram.</i>

- Goodnight, Dad.
- Goodnight, Son.

Don't tell me this guy ain't loaded.

268

Let's pull out of here.

269
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,519
Now, before it's too late.

270
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,997
- Pa?
- Maybe they're still asleep.

271
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,545
Nancy?

272
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,469
Don't touch it.

273
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,973
Don't touch anything.

274
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,308
Been up there?

275
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,828
My God.

276
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,222
There's two more in the basement.

277
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,865
I just saw two ambulances
going up to Clutter's.

278
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,034
I just wondering what's happening.

279
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:57,642
<i>The Sheriff placed an urgent call
to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.</i>

<i>In Topeka, Logan Sanford, KBI chief,

<i>They are agents Dewey, Nye,
Duntz, and Church.</i>

282

- What happened to the basketball game?
- It got interrupted. Terrible thing, that.

283
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,328
I've never been so hungry in my whole life.

284

<i>Mr Dewey, resident of Garden City,

287
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,096
Were all four tied with the same cord?

288
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,765
All tied with the same square knot.

289
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,685
Used by anybody who works with livestock.

290
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,562
- Find any shell casings?
- Nope.

291
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,982
Which means that

292
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:50,069
you can bet
they didn't leave any fingerprints either.

293
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:55,408
Al.

294
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,286
- This is the housekeeper.
- Thank you for coming.

295
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,372
- Are they still...
- No, no, no, ma'am.

296

They've been taken to the funeral home.

297

to see if anything is missing...

299
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,550
They never hurt anybody. Why them?

300
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,064
Al, you knew Clutter.

301
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,402
Did he have a safe?

302
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,196
Keep a lot of cash on hand?

303
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,365
The old Kansas myth.

304
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,368
Every farmer with a good spread
is supposed to have

305
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:42,329
a hidden black box somewhere
filled with money.

306
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:46,751
No. Herb paid everything by cheque.
Even a $2 haircut.

307
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,670
Well, then why,

308
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,381
if they're going
to shoot them all anyway, why

309
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,635
did they first cut Clutter's throat?

310
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:02,057
Why did they first put him
on a soft mattress box?

311
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,809
To make him comfy?

312
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,354
And why the pillow under the boy's head?

313
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:12,318
We keep saying "they."
It could have been one man.

314
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,489
A madman.

315
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:24,038
This picture was taken with a time exposure.

316
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,707
It shows only what the eye saw.

317
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,419
This picture was taken with a flashbulb.

318
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:32,922
That's a different pair of shoes.

319
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,591
Yeah.

320
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,344
We know there were at least two of them.

321
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:44,183
You won't see it there.
The flash made them stand out in the dust.

322
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,019
- You develop those pictures yourself?
- Yes.

323
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,688
- Newspaper boy's seen this?
- Not yet.

324
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,691
Keep it that way.

325
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,448
Hey, Al, Al,
when can we see the Clutter home?

326
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,242
Why were the men killed in the basement?

327
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,577
I'll talk facts, not theories.

328
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,791
It happened around 2:00 a.m.

329
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,628
All four were apparently killed
by the same weapon.

330
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:16,549
Shotgun, 12-gauge.
Mr Clutter's throat was cut.

331
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,843
Before he was shot?

332
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,512
Probably.

333
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,641
All four were tied
with the same nylon sash-cord

334
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,227
sold in most hardware stores.

335
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,396
And their mouths were taped.

336
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,065
How were they tied? What kind of knots?

337
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,734
Can we see police pictures?

338
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,695
- Find the murder weapon?
- Not yet.

339
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:41,323
- Any clues or fingerprints?
- Lots. All belong to the family.

340
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:44,660
They say that Nancy's boyfriend
is a prime suspect.

341
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:48,163
- Is that what they say?
- He was the last one to see them alive.

342
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,292
- Except the killers.
- Then there were more than one?

343
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,211
- Were the women sexually molested?
- The coroner says not.

344
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,589
- How come the dog didn't bark?
- How do you know he didn't bark?

345
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,632
- Nobody heard him.
- Nobody heard the gunshots either.

346
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:02,052
- Was there more than one killer?
- What about the hired man?

347
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,430
Mr Dewey, in your opinion,

348
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:07,182
do you think it could have been
an inside job, sir?

349
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,644
- Why didn't Mr Clutter resist?
- Mr Dewey, just a moment, Mr Dewey.

350
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,355
- Was there more than one killer?
- What about the hired man?

351
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,942
His cheque was made out for $1,707.

352
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:20,112
Mr Clutter's first premium
on a straight life policy

353
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,323
worth $40,000.

354
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,576
Double indemnity makes it $80,000.

355
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,079
And that makes it a strange coincidence.

356
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,834
And that's all it is, a coincidence.

357
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,922
I didn't catch your name.

358
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,341
Bill Jensen, Weekly magazine.

359
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:44,345
If you're not here to write news,
what is your interest?

360
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,389
Fairly basic.

361
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,852
What's basic about a stupid,

362
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,188
senseless crime?

363
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,693
A violent, unknown force
destroys a decent, ordinary family.

364
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,030
No clues. No logic.

365
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,618
Makes us all feel frightened. Vulnerable.

366
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:12,081
Murder's no mystery. Only the motive.

367
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,917
Got one?

368
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,712
I smoke too much.

369
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:22,549
How'd they enter the house?
A key? Force a window?

370
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:25,386
Probably just walked in.

371
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:30,391
- Don't people around here lock doors?
- They will tonight.

372
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,270
I know something's wrong here.

373
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,564
I feel it.

374
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,693
I don't know what it is, but...

375
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,487
Mr Clutter never allowed smoking
in the house.

376
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,155
Sorry.

377
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,991
Something.

378
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,076
Something.

379
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,787
But of course.

380
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,581
The radio!

381
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,543
Kenyon always listened
to the news and weather

382
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,420
before he went to bed.

383
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,588
But where's his radio?

384
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,800
<i>Since the night of horror, two days ago,</i>

385
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:08,846
<i>few people are seen on the streets
of Garden City after dark.</i>

386
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,807
<i>To date, no clues have been uncovered.</i>

387
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,601
<i>No clues whatever.</i>

388
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:20,441
<i>It was generally known that Clutter
never had large sums of cash on hand.</i>

389
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,693
<i>No expensive jewels.</i>

390
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,612
<i>Nor even a steel safe in which to...</i>

391
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,783
Perry, baby, if you don't want that burger...

392
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,957
You and your hotshot
prison buddy Floyd Wells.

393
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,169
Big, fat safe in the wall.

394
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:44,631
$10,000. "A cinch."

395
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:49,136
Okay, Floyd's a jerk.
But we scored, didn't we?

396
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:50,679
<i>Perfecto.</i>

397
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,349
You call an 800-mile drive

398
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:58,020
and the rest of it, for 43 lousy dollars,

399
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,397
you call that perfect?

400
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:01,523
And that!

401
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,486
You don't believe that con
about no clues, do you?

402
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:07,946
You worry too much.

403
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:11,492
How are them cowboys
gonna connect us? Remember?

404
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,035
No witnesses.

405
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,205
I know one.

406
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:24,838
You. You're a witness.

407
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:32,179
Jesus, kid. For a minute,
I thought you blew your cork.

408
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,141
You're so right.

409
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,062
We're the only ones that saw it,

410
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,689
and that, honey, is our big ace.

411
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,319
Because if they can't split us apart,
they can't get a confession.

412
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,531
And if they can't get a confession,
they got nothing.

413
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:52,991
Next move,

414
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,745
Mexico.

415
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,165
- Once we beat it out of the country.
- On what?

416
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:03,210
$43 and a smile and bullshit?

417
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:08,423
You guessed it, chief.
It's the smile that does it.

418
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,593
Like it says in the commercials,

419
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,930
"The family that sticks together
lives forever."

420
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:29,069
<i>Officers investigating the tragic slaying
have appealed to the public</i>

421
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,988
<i>for help in solving the crime.</i>

422
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:35,492
<i>A Kansas paper, The Hutchinson News,
has offered a reward for any information</i>

423
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:38,662
<i>leading to the capture
and conviction of the person or persons,</i>

424
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,789
<i>guilty of the Clutter murders.</i>

425
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,458
<i>A reward of $1,000.</i>

426
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:50,048
What about the reward?
Yeah, that's right, $1,000.

427
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,596
Yes, sir. Where are you calling from?

428
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,557
Yeah. Go ahead.

429
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,394
Who?

430
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,941
How do you know he was a foreigner?

431
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,947
- I see. Thank you very much, sir.
- Another tip?

432
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,285
He says he saw a foreigner running.

433
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,787
How does a foreigner run, anyway?

434
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,707
Just how many people
have tried to claim this reward?

435
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,584
Just about everybody.

436
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,962
A mysterious stranger did it.

437
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:32,799
Hired killers did it.
A jealous neighbour did it.

438
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,929
Seems like the only one
who didn't do it is the butler.

439
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,640
Any luck?

440
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:43,143
None of the Clutters had shoes
with a cat's paw.

441
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:47,648
No diamond pattern, either.
Insurance money goes to the family.

442
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,318
And this, Nancy Clutter's.

443
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,989
Found it hidden in the toe of her slipper.

444
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,075
Something must've scared her.

445
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,411
All of which brings us back
to the motive of robbery.

446
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:06,583
I can believe one man might work up
enough rage to do it.

447
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,001
But two?

448
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,839
Who would kill four people in cold blood
for a radio,

449
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:17,511
a pair of binoculars and $40 in cash?

450
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:22,432
These days? Take your pick
on any crowded street.

451
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,186
You ever hang any paper?

452
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,147
I couldn't cash a cheque even if it was good.

453
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,874
Easy, baby. Casual.

454
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,135
Excuse me. My name's Hickock.
Richie. And you're?

455
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,845
Sharp. Luke Sharp.

456
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,681
I'll bet in school
they called you Look Sharp.

457
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,808
See that gentleman over there?

458
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,561
Would you believe a runt like that
is getting married?

459
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:12,858
Well, maybe he ain't any Fred Astaire
but he's my best friend,

460
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,736
and I'm his best man.

461
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,990
My wedding present to him
is going to be what you might call

462
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,491
his trousseau.

463
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:34,338
Ideal shade for an informal ceremony,
don't you think?

464
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:35,505
Perfectly ideal.

465
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,091
Of course,
we are a tiny bit oddly proportioned.

466
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,845
I mean, the upper torso is so large
compared to the legs.

467
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,016
I'm terribly sorry.

468
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,769
He's not ashamed of them scars.

469
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,897
They gave him the Bronze Star in Korea.

470
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:57,194
Luke, have you ever been to Eden Roc?
In Miami Beach.

471
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:00,447
That's where the happy couple
is shacking up for their honeymoon.

472
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,450
Two weeks all paid up.
Surprise gift from the folks.

473
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,618
He's a very lucky man.

474
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,744
He deserves it.

475
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:12,292
And with these, $192.70.

476
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,045
Would you like to have these wrapped
and taken to your car?

477
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,798
No hurry.
Deliver them when the suit is ready.

478
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,049
Oh, no!

479
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:22,969
Four silly dollars.

480
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,806
We're awfully sorry.

481
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:28,392
We'll have to come back some other time.

482
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,937
I'd gladly give you a cheque.

483
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:34,481
But then you hardly know me.

484
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,900
Anyway, we're really grateful
for your courtesy.

485
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,569
- If it's a personal cheque, perhaps.
- You're sure?

486
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,363
- Positive.
- I wouldn't want to inconvenience you.

487
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,823
Perfectly all right.

488
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,533
Which bank would you like?

489
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,368
It's immaterial, I'm sure.

490
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,911
Thank you.

491
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:52,666
My driver's license, identity card,
insurance card, country club... Oops!

492
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,668
She's a private number.

493
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,963
- Was that $192?
- And $0.70.

494
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,424
Would you care if I...

495
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,843
- No. Never mind.
- No, please.

496
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,429
Well, I could use a little loose change.

497
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:06,596
I see.

498
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:10,100
Suppose I just make this out for $280

499
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,352
and $0.70, of course.

500
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,688
Well, I suppose.

501
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:19,025
Mr Sharp, you're a brick.

502
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,366
You're good. You're really good.

503
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,495
Smooth. No sweat. No strain.

504
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,873
- You're an artist, boy.
- Right.

505
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,959
If you're getting married,
you need a wedding ring.

506
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,878
- Why not two of them?
- Why not?

507
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:42,007
Cameras, diamond rings, TV sets
are the easiest things to hock or sell.

508
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,604
You know, there's got to be
something wrong with us

509
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,231
to do what we did.

510
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:43,276
Nobody, but nobody,
ever gets away with a thing like that.

511
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,237
Will you shut up about it?

512
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:49,741
I can't shake this feeling
that we forgot something that night.

513
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:54,371
I don't know what,
something that belongs to us.

514
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,708
You want to go back to that house
and look for whatever the hell it is?

515
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:02,921
Because that would make us
not only crazy, but insane.

516
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,738
Any luck?

517
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,657
If they didn't leave any fingerprints,

518
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,159
you can be sure
they didn't leave any murder weapons.

519
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,524
People who used to work for Clutter,
going back 15 years.

520
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,485
Hired men,
people he used to do business with...

521
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,616
- All right. Just keep talking.
- Upstairs?

522
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:15,327
Don't look up.

523
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,496
- See something?
- I'm not sure.

524
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:24,002
Now you take the office side
and I'll go around the kitchen side.

525
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,747
It's true, really true.

526
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,875
We're on our way
and never coming back, never.

527
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,752
And no regrets.

528
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:08,421
For you. You are leaving nothing.

529
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,092
What about my old man? And my mother.

530
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:15,595
They'll still be there
when my cheques start bouncing.

531
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,264
It's nice the way you think about your folks.

532
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:21,184
Yeah. I'm a real thoughtful bastard.

533
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,284
'Morning, Bess. Coffee?

534
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,788
Hey, Alvin, that prowler at the Clutter house,

535
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,957
- get a confession out of him yet?
- Yep.

536
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:47,293
His confession proved he couldn't have
done it. Escaped mental patient.

537
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,964
If he's the wrong one,
why in hell don't you find the right one?

538
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:55,093
I've got a house full of women
who are afraid to go to the toilet alone.

539
00:50:56,637 --> 00:51:00,640
Bunch of gabby old women gassing away,
scaring each other.

540
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:05,228
Somebody with a grudge done it. Somebody
who hated the Clutters, if you ask me.

541
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,481
Nobody asked you.
Nobody hated the Clutters neither.

542
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,151
Leastways, nobody that knew them.

543
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,402
Phone.

544
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:19,492
If this can happen to a decent,
God-fearing family,

545
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,077
who's safe anymore?

546
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,747
Hello?

547
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,459
- From here?
- No, from Topeka. It's urgent!

548
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,256
Okay, Mr Sandrew.

549
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,843
Tell Alvin it's a prisoner. In Lansing.

550
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:41,806
Get me a rap sheet on this man, please.
He mentioned the Clutter case.

551
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:46,603
He wouldn't say any more
unless he was called out of the cellblock.

552
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:50,607
I have the warden on the other phone now.
Might be a break.

553
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:54,360
If it is, I'll be out to Garden City tonight
with the tape.

554
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:56,112
No, phone's too risky.

555
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,325
Hello? Yes.

556
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:06,456
"KSP 1 -4-3-2-3. Floyd Wells."

557
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,839
<i>- I first met him in the penitentiary.
- Hickock?</i>

558
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,383
<i>Yes, sir. We shared the same cell.</i>

559
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,135
<i>Go ahead, Floyd.</i>

560
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,887
<i>Well, anyways,</i>

561
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,556
<i>we swapped life stories and I told him</i>

562
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,476
<i>how I once worked
for a farmer named Clutter.</i>

563
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,144
<i>Did you work for him?</i>

564
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:30,563
<i>Yes, sir. Ten, eleven years ago.</i>

565
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:34,317
<i>Dick wanted to know if Mr Clutter
was rich and I said,</i>

566
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:38,822
<i>"Well, sometimes it cost him $10,000
a week to run his operation."</i>

567
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:42,742
<i>After that, Dick never let up.
Just kept asking questions.</i>

568
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:46,579
<i>How many was in the family?
Did Clutter keep a safe?</i>

569
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,499
<i>Dick said how he was going
to rob the Clutter place,</i>

570
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,834
<i>him and his buddy.</i>

571
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,753
<i>And how he was gonna kill
all the witnesses.</i>

572
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,422
<i>I just never believed him.
I thought it was just...</i>

573
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,883
What took him so long to speak up?

574
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:02,679
Afraid of other prisoners.
Issue a pickup warrant.

575
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,848
All-points bulletin.

576
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:08,268
We better make it for parole violation,
passing bad cheques.

577
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,603
If they know they're wanted for murder...

578
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,898
- Yeah.
- The question is why they did it.

579
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,694
Why did Cain kill Abel? And who cares?

580
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,114
They did it, and they'll swing for it.

581
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:26,744
If they did it and if we can prove it.

582
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,041
When we cross this bridge, we're in Mexico.

583
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,002
Free, clear and safe.

584
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,338
Fabulous Mexico.

585
00:53:57,902 --> 00:53:59,027
Mr Smith?

586
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,530
Mr Tex Smith?

587
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,491
- Cops?
- Kansas Bureau of Investigation.

588
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:13,458
Is this your son, Perry?

589
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:23,635
Yep, that's him all right.

590
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:27,013
Gets his looks from his mother.

591
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,265
Part Cherokee.

592
00:54:29,642 --> 00:54:32,852
- Will you have some coffee?
- When did you see him last?

593
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,022
- Couple of years ago.
- In prison?

594
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:40,401
I was just fixing to make some grub.
You want some eats?

595
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:44,781
He was in for three and a half years.
He's been out on parole for six months.

596
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,992
Well, then I guess I haven't seen him
for five or six years.

597
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:50,995
That's not surprising though.
He's a lone wolf just like me.

598
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,206
You guys can rest easy on one thing sure,

599
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,375
you won't be having
any more trouble with Perry.

600
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:57,418
He's learned his lesson for sure.

601
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:00,171
When he wrote me from prison,
I wrote him right back pronto.

602
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,298
"Boy, you take your punishment
with a smile.

603
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:05,176
"I didn't raise you to steal,
so don't expect me to cry

604
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,553
"just because you got it tough
behind the bars."

605
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:10,181
Perry's no fool. He knows when he's beat.

606
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,893
You fellows have got him whipped forever.
The law's the boss.

607
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:16,562
He knows the difference between
right and wrong, you can bet on that.

608
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,482
Because I taught my kids a golden rule.
Always tell the truth,

609
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,110
always wash in the morning,
always be sober and independent.

610
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:23,611
I showed him how.

611
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:27,240
How to prospect, how to trap fur,
how to carpenter, how to bake bread,

612
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,992
how to be his own boss.

613
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:33,037
Yes, he's a chip off the old block, all right.

614
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:38,126
I never had no trouble with my kids,
not as long as Flo and me was together.

615
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,295
But she wanted the wild life.

616
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:45,174
So she took the kids and ran off.
Turned them against me.

617
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,509
All but Perry.

618
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,303
I don't know what got into her.

619
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:52,098
She started drinking.
Turned into a hopeless drunk.

620
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:55,727
Started stepping out with young men.
I caught her once and I...

621
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,982
Anyway, she died drunk.

622
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,068
Choked to death on her own vomit.

623
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:08,239
So I took Perry and we started roaming
to forget it all.

624
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,620
I took him with me everywhere.

625
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,670
How that boy loved me.

626
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,635
At night, when it was cold,

627
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,307
we'd sleep cuddled up.

628
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:41,898
He'd hang onto me with his little arms,
so tight.

629
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:50,531
I'd tell him stories about
the great adventures we was gonna have.

630
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:58,081
How we was gonna strike it rich.

631
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:03,252
Buried treasures.

632
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:07,965
Gold.

633
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,719
In Alaska.

634
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:22,271
That's where this picture was took.
Him and me in Alaska.

635
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:26,526
Mr Smith...

636
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,737
You just ask Perry
if I wasn't a good father to him.

637
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:33,199
I always shared, always. When I eat, he eats.

638
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:38,538
You just tell Perry,
when I die all my insurance goes to him.

639
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:45,628
Yes, sir.

640
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:49,549
His life is all set.

641
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:54,887
Great news!

642
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:58,307
I met this kid. He's a shoeshine boy.

643
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,688
He's got a cousin in Yucatán, a fisherman.

644
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,649
- And he's got a powerboat.
- So?

645
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:11,654
So, we drive to Yucatán, we sell the car,

646
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,699
buy us a load of deep-sea diving gear

647
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:18,911
and "pow," we hit the Cortés jackpot.

648
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:23,249
$60 million in Spanish gold.

649
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:29,547
Of course, we'll have to cut the kid in,
and his cousin, too.

650
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:36,137
But even so, Yucatán!

651
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,183
Hot, dry, clean,

652
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,686
no crowd, no noise.

653
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,148
Doing what we came to do.

654
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:51,068
- How much can we get for the car?
- 120 bucks.

655
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,320
Is that all?

656
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:56,824
Enough to pay the bills.
Hotel, bar, groceries.

657
00:58:57,117 --> 00:59:00,953
And with what's left over,
I bought us two bus tickets

658
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:05,374
as far as Barstow, California.
After that, we walk.

659
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,753
So get rid of that ton and a half of garbage.

660
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:12,173
Ship it! Dump it! Burn it! I don't care.

661
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:16,469
Only get rid of it, by tonight.
'Cause come tomorrow, we're gone.

662
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:19,639
- Back to the States.
- Dick, wait. Now listen.

663
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,432
You listen! I've had it!

664
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,560
You, your maps, fishing boats,
buried treasure, all of it!

665
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:26,687
Everything! Stop jacking off.

666
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:30,024
There ain't any caskets of gold.
No buried treasure.

667
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:34,570
And even if there was, hell, boy,
you can't even swim.

668
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,367
You want to stick with me, okay.

669
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,371
You wanna split, that's okay, too.

670
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,624
Only make up your mind.

671
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:52,922
- I'll ship our stuff back to Vegas.
- Good.

672
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:57,343
I got a little señorita coming over tonight.

673
00:59:58,387 --> 01:00:01,555
I'll try to be finished packing
before you get back.

674
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,225
What for? Hell, I'm not bashful, baby.

675
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,396
...and that, if we find the motive,
we find the killer.

676
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:12,149
...and that, if we find the motive,
we find the killer.

677
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:13,776
If.

678
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:19,031
This report was written six months

679
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:21,784
before the Clutters were killed.

680
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:26,122
<i>It's called, Murder Without Apparent Motive.</i>

681
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,250
At the Menninger Clinic,
right here in Kansas,

682
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,877
a study was made of four killers.

683
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:35,047
They all had certain things in common.

684
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,925
They all committed senseless murders.

685
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:43,264
They all felt physically inferior
and sexually inadequate.

686
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:48,019
Their childhood was violent,
or one parent was missing.

687
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,980
Or someone else had raised them.

688
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:56,694
They couldn't distinguish
between fantasy and reality.

689
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:00,781
They didn't hate their victims,
they didn't even know them.

690
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:04,827
They felt no guilt about their crime,
and got nothing out of it.

691
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:10,041
And most important,
they told the police or a psychiatrist

692
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:16,255
that they felt the urge to kill,
before they committed murder.

693
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:19,467
Their warnings were disregarded.

694
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:29,101
So, who killed the Clutters?

695
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:38,444
Someday, somebody will explain
to me the motive of a newspaper.

696
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:41,530
First you scream, "Find the bastards."

697
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,658
Till we find them, you want to get us fired.

698
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:47,870
When we find them,
you accuse us of brutality.

699
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:52,583
Before we can go into court,
you give them a trial by newspaper.

700
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:56,462
When we finally get a conviction
you want to save them

701
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,340
by proving they were crazy in the first place.

702
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:03,636
All of which adds up to one thing.
You've got the killers.

703
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,848
Off the record, have you got them?

704
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,143
Suspects.

705
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:14,146
Even if we catch them, that's all we've got.

706
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:18,818
Because without a confession,
and the evidence we got so far,

707
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:21,195
we couldn't even go to trial.

708
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,949
Unless we can place the suspects
in this spot,

709
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:29,370
unless we can tie the killers
to that piece of rope,

710
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,288
they'll never hang.

711
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:02,796
<i>Perry!</i>

712
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:37,785
Was it good, baby?

713
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:40,371
Was it good?

714
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:43,874
Baby, was it really good?

715
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,452
All a truck gets us, is from here to there.

716
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:22,579
We want a score.

717
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:27,126
One guy with a fat wallet,
in a fast car, with a back seat.

718
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,294
I sit beside him.

719
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:32,297
You get in the back, I feed him a few jokes.

720
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:35,926
I say, "Hey, Perry, pass me a match."

721
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,636
That's your signal.

722
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:40,305
Fast. Hard. Snap. I grab the wheel.

723
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:44,143
You're so good at it,
you sit in the back seat.

724
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:45,769
You do it.

725
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,692
Look friendly, now.

726
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:09,793
You're a lucky bastard.

727
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,307
Don't forget, when I say, "Pass me a match."

728
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:26,477
- Hop in, boys. Where are you going?
- Come on. Get in.

729
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:28,395
Not with you.

730
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,150
Thanks just the same.

731
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,985
Did you see them guys?

732
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,404
Jesus! They could've robbed us.

733
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:39,364
What of?

734
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:54,087
I'm really not supposed to pick up anybody
in the company car, but...

735
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:57,841
- What the hell, you only live once.
- That's what they say.

736
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:00,594
Comfortable back there?

737
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:03,138
I can take you as far as Iowa.

738
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:06,558
Where have you boys been?

739
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,977
Mexico. No future there.

740
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,396
That depends, my boy.

741
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,899
I honeymooned in Mexico.

742
01:09:14,526 --> 01:09:18,737
You might say that's where I planted
the seed of our first child.

743
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:23,075
I ploughed and planted
a few señoritas there myself.

744
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,999
You know what they call a prostitute
who went to college?

745
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:32,167
What?

746
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:35,087
A whore-to-culture.

747
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,842
I got a riddle for you.

748
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,260
- Ready?
- Shoot.

749
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:46,890
Why is a trip to the bathroom
exactly like a trip to the cemetery?

750
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,103
Let me see. A trip to the bathroom

751
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:54,773
like a trip to the cemetery...

752
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,734
Give up?

753
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:01,446
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

754
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:04,074
Hey, Perry, pass me a match.

755
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,795
Sorry, I never turn down a soldier.

756
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,964
This might get the boy home for Christmas.

757
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,299
Lucky break.

758
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,926
Practically a goddamn miracle.

759
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:29,141
You didn't happen to see a portable radio,
Mr Hickock, about so big?

760
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:31,476
A Zenith?

761
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:34,813
Now what makes him do it?

762
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,649
Hit out against people?

763
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:42,237
Outstanding athlete in basketball,
baseball, football,

764
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,323
always made the first team.

765
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:49,119
He always played to win,
played hard, but clean.

766
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:56,168
When he left without a word
I knew he was in trouble again.

767
01:10:56,502 --> 01:11:00,756
Now, Mr Nye, I thought if I...
About breaking parole.

768
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:03,175
Will he have to go back to prison?

769
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:11,099
You do much hunting, Mr Hickock?

770
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:14,478
That's his gun. Dick's.

771
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,777
You know, when he come out of prison,

772
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:25,697
you know, folks was saying
how he'd turned mean.

773
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,494
Now how'd they know?
How'd anybody know

774
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:33,497
what's inside another person?

775
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:40,462
You see, I haven't got long to go, Mr Nye.
I'm with cancer.

776
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,548
Dick knowed that.

777
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,303
Well, before he left, he said to me...

778
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:53,475
He said, "Pa, I'm not ever gonna do anything
to hurt you."

779
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,727
And he meant it, too.

780
01:11:56,354 --> 01:12:00,357
Now, I mean, if you'd seen him,
you know, playing with his children.

781
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:06,238
Any boy that loves and respects his folks,
well, you know

782
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:09,366
there's good inside that boy.

783
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:14,871
I hope you find him, Mr Nye,
for his own sake. Before it's too late.

784
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:50,782
You know what we are?

785
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,620
We're the living proof that crime pays.

786
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,589
Gifts in a manger.

787
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,093
No more money troubles.

788
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:12,137
Merry Christmas.

789
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,432
Kansas City, here we come.

790
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,726
You're crazy.

791
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:20,645
I gotta get us some money.

792
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:24,232
How far do you think we could get
in a hot car? With hot cheques?

793
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,651
That's right. I'll go by myself.

794
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:30,405
- Like hell you will.
- I'll meet you later.

795
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,575
We stick together.

796
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,161
First we go to Vegas.
We pick up our clothes.

797
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:38,747
All the stuff I shipped from Mexico.
And then

798
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:43,001
we drive to the nearest port and we ship out
on the first tanker leaving this country.

799
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:45,253
And this time we stay out.

800
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:46,505
I won't go.

801
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,173
You'll go.

802
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:50,133
What if I don't?

803
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,180
Well, then, "honey, baby,"

804
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:59,643
I guess I'll just have to kill you.

805
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:03,355
Yeah. But right now,

806
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,025
we pass a lot of fast, hot cheques.

807
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:25,293
One more cheque.
We can be in and out of here in an hour.

808
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,504
A cinch.

809
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:30,340
Stop worrying, will you?

810
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,718
Al, our friends are here.

811
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:35,887
How do you know?

812
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,890
<i>They stole a car in lowa
and bought two tyres with a bad cheque.</i>

813
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,058
Where?

814
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:43,979
Right here. The salesman got worried,
he wrote down the license.

815
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:46,022
The Hickock farm, is it covered?

816
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,900
If they go there, we're covered.

817
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,944
I'll be at the Hickock farm.

818
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:51,046
Yes?

819
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:52,214
Yes.

820
01:15:58,137 --> 01:15:59,971
Did they slip through?

821
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:07,229
If it wasn't to see his folks,
why would they come back to Kansas?

822
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:11,483
Maybe they're trying to be caught.

823
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:15,320
I guess they'll just have to try harder.

824
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,011
You're not stopping for them?

825
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,685
Look at that old man, he looks awful.

826
01:16:46,978 --> 01:16:50,313
Suppose he dies on us?
That means cops, questions.

827
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:51,856
Think, will you?

828
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,609
I think you're a bastard.

829
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,950
We sure appreciate this, mister.

830
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,201
Get in.

831
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,120
Where you headed?

832
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:09,457
California. Gramps has got a sister
in Needles. He's going to stay with her.

833
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,376
Did you hear that, Johnny?

834
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,461
Hear me, Johnny?

835
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:15,213
You got any money?

836
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:17,882
- Hey, kid.
- No, sir.

837
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:21,011
Not even $1 for gas?

838
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,848
Only these.

839
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:36,568
- They're worth $0.03 a bottle.
- So?

840
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:42,907
Mister, if you was to drive real slow,
we could pick us up some real change.

841
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:47,370
That's what Johnny and me
have been eating off of. Refund money.

842
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:50,248
Kid, get in.

843
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,212
We finally found it.

844
01:17:56,714 --> 01:18:00,258
The sunken treasure of Captain Cortés.

845
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:05,722
$0.03 a bottle.

846
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,284
Pay dirt!

847
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,665
<i>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.</i>

848
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:36,604
Hey, mister, $12.60. Fifty-fifty okay?

849
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:38,690
Kid, you're a positive genius.

850
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:40,358
- Happy New Year!
- Likewise.

851
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,360
Keep digging, old-timer.

852
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,383
Never seen so much blonde chicken.

853
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,344
And all that sweet divorce money.

854
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:10,054
Yeah, sure.

855
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,483
Hey, chief,

856
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,568
you a lucky crap shooter?

857
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,321
Deuces, treys and twelves.

858
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:28,406
Mr Snake Eyes himself.

859
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:31,409
If we put this fiver on the line

860
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:33,369
and if we let it ride

861
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:35,747
and if we make only 10 passes,

862
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:39,209
we'd have over 5,000 bucks.

863
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:42,921
How about it, honey?
I feel real lucky tonight.

864
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:07,862
You've got visitors.

865
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:30,552
Hello.

866
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:34,806
Hey, buddy.
Put in a call for that big old yellow bird.

867
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:02,333
Good afternoon.

868
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:04,502
- Smith.
- Hickock.

869
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:28,526
- Comedian.
- Yeah.

870
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:32,822
Roy.

871
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:42,290
Are they still virgins?

872
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:46,210
- What'd you charge them with?
- Driving a hot car.

873
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:53,384
Officer.

874
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:04,520
- You know why we're here, Mr Hickock?
- Sir,

875
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:06,731
you can call me Dick.

876
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:08,691
All right, Dick.

877
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:11,569
We understand you've signed
the extradition papers.

878
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:13,404
Yeah, well, what the hell.

879
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:17,575
There's no denying we broke parole
and hung a mile and half of paper.

880
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,036
Oh, yeah, the car,

881
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,330
it's stolen.

882
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:24,582
That's it. All of it.

883
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,001
- Okay if I smoke?
- Sure, sure.

884
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:30,254
You know, in a way, I'm glad it's over.

885
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:34,425
I'll take what I've got coming.
Serve my time and never,

886
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:36,761
but never again.

887
01:23:44,228 --> 01:23:47,939
Your parole has a special provision
never to return to Kansas.

888
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:49,607
I cried my eyes out.

889
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:53,277
Must've been something important
to bring you back.

890
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:58,199
I had to see my sister in Fort Scott.

891
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:02,412
- To get money she was holding for me.
- Did you get it?

892
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:07,709
- She moved away.
- Where?

893
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:10,461
I don't know.

894
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:13,548
How far is it from Kansas City to Fort Scott?

895
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:17,885
I don't know.

896
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:21,139
How long did it take you to drive there,
one hour? Two?

897
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,307
Three? Four?

898
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:24,934
I can't remember.

899
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:27,812
Do you remember what day it was?

900
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:28,980
Saturday.

901
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,232
Yeah, I remember now.

902
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:33,651
We got to Fort Scott about 4:00 p.m.

903
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:36,487
- We went right to the post office.
- Why?

904
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:37,739
Why?

905
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:40,575
To find out where Perry's sister lived.

906
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:42,827
The guy at the post office said she moved.

907
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:44,996
Left no address and left no money, either.

908
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:47,832
- Must've been quite a blow.
- It was a haymaker.

909
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,250
- Okay?
- Sure, sure.

910
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,127
What did you do then?

911
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:54,464
Drove back to K.C., went prowling.

912
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,174
Any luck?

913
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:59,594
Not much.
We ended up with a couple of hustlers.

914
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:00,928
Named?

915
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,430
I never asked.

916
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:10,521
You spent the night with these women
and you didn't ask their names?

917
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:12,607
They were just prostitutes.

918
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:14,609
Where'd you take them?

919
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:19,864
I don't remember junk like that.
You'll have to ask Dick.

920
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:23,868
What did these girls look like?

921
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:25,828
Describe them.

922
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:28,372
Blonde? Dark? Big? Little?

923
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:29,957
Any scars?

924
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:33,044
Moles? Marks?

925
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:37,548
Would you like the sordid details?

926
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:38,966
Anything.

927
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:43,888
Is that how you get your kicks?

928
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,016
She had to be a contortionist.

929
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:50,645
I guess you know why we're really here?

930
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:52,814
You know we wouldn't have come this far

931
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:55,399
just to arrest
a couple of two-bit cheque chisellers.

932
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:56,984
Would we, Dick?

933
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,737
- I wasn't listening.
- Are you listening now?

934
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:02,532
Did you ever hear
of the Clutter murder case?

935
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,910
Can't nobody pin any murder on me. No, sir.

936
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:09,580
- The question was, did you hear about it?
- Read something about it, maybe.

937
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,916
- Yeah.
- You made three mistakes.

938
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,710
Number one, you left a witness.

939
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:17,922
A living witness, who'll testify in court.

940
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,258
There ain't any living witness. Can't be.

941
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:22,426
Nobody can pin any murder on me.

942
01:26:22,553 --> 01:26:24,929
Saturday, November 14,
you drove to Fort Scott.

943
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:26,514
- You went to the post office...
- Yes.

944
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:30,351
- ...to get the address of Perry's sister.
- That's right.

945
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,861
Perry Smith has no sister in Fort Scott.
Never has had.

946
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:45,616
On Saturday afternoon the post office
in Fort Scott is always closed.

947
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:49,245
That is your second mistake.

948
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:53,875
Perry seems confused about that night.

949
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,460
I think it's about time
we straightened him out.

950
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:58,796
Yes, sir. About time.

951
01:26:59,298 --> 01:27:00,923
Look at me, boy.

952
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:09,015
On Saturday night, November 14,
you were in Holcomb, Kansas.

953
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,185
You were killing the Clutter family.

954
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,813
Never.

955
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:18,649
- I never...
- Never what?

956
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:22,695
I never knew anybody by that name,

957
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,449
- Clutter.
- We've got a living witness.

958
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:39,879
Well, Perry?

959
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:44,216
Do you have any aspirin?

960
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:46,469
They took my aspirin away.

961
01:27:46,553 --> 01:27:48,012
Feeling bad?

962
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,349
My legs do.

963
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:59,649
By the way, you know what tomorrow is?

964
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:02,818
Nancy Clutter's birthday.

965
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:05,363
She would have been 17.

966
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,535
You guys have gotta be stalling.

967
01:28:11,912 --> 01:28:15,706
If you had any real proof...
Real proof, as in eyewitness.

968
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:17,583
Fingerprints.

969
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:25,091
As God is my witness,
may I burn in hell forever

970
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:26,717
if I ever killed anybody.

971
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:28,260
Careful, boy.

972
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:34,892
Got an aspirin?

973
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:40,606
How's it going?

974
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:42,900
Three hours and all we've got so far is,

975
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:45,569
"No. I don't remember. Ask Dick."

976
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:50,908
We've caught that hard-nosed little punk
in 50 lies and he still admits nothing.

977
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:01,585
I think our boy's about primed and ready.

978
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:04,422
I hope you're right.

979
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:14,557
Why do all you people get tattooed?

980
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:18,769
"All you people"?

981
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:23,274
- What people?
- Convicts. You're all tattooed.

982
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:27,653
That tiger head. What does it do?
Make you feel tough?

983
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:36,829
That cop's badge, what does it do?
Make you feel honest?

984
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,623
Everybody's got a tattoo.

985
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,834
Only you people call them clubs.

986
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:46,922
Elks, Masons, Boy Scouts. Salute.
High sign. Low sign.

987
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:50,843
Secret this and secret that.
"No trespassing. Keep off the grass."

988
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:53,512
Nice, respectable, tattoo clubs.

989
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:57,850
Poker clubs, golf clubs, tennis clubs.

990
01:29:57,934 --> 01:30:00,728
Clubs for gambling and clubs for drinking.

991
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:04,356
Even a real club like Daddy-O's got
in that little brown bag.

992
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:07,526
What you gonna do, pappy?
Club it out of me?

993
01:30:08,695 --> 01:30:10,279
Something like that.

994
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,698
I said you made three mistakes.

995
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:15,493
First, you left a living witness.

996
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,287
Second, your alibi won't hold water.

997
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:19,705
And third?

998
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:21,916
Coming up.

999
01:30:24,294 --> 01:30:25,669
Footprints.

1000
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:30,716
Made in the spot
where Mr Clutter was murdered.

1001
01:30:32,886 --> 01:30:35,387
These are the shoes that made them.

1002
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:39,100
Yours.

1003
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,562
This footprint

1004
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:47,483
was made in Mr Clutter's blood.

1005
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:50,236
Perry's shoe.

1006
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:54,406
Same cat's paw. Same size. Same blood.

1007
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:05,251
All right, Dick. This time the truth.

1008
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:13,300
I don't want to be charged with murder one

1009
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:16,428
because I never pulled the trigger.

1010
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:20,141
I don't even know
what the goddamn hell was happening.

1011
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:24,019
It was Perry. He did it.

1012
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,357
I couldn't stop him.

1013
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:32,361
He killed them all.

1014
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:56,927
Are you the officer that made the arrest?

1015
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:59,263
If you'd grabbed them five minutes earlier

1016
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:01,932
before they'd picked up that box...

1017
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,851
Just luck, I guess.

1018
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:05,186
Or something.

1019
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:22,703
Hickock swears that he tried to stop you.

1020
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:27,333
- He was scared that you'd shoot him, too.
- He said you did it. All of it.

1021
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:32,004
Sure. Now you'd like me to say he did it.

1022
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:35,216
He's no killer, and he knows it.

1023
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,802
That's why he picked you.
He needed a trigger.

1024
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:42,848
You had nothing to lose.
You'd already killed a man, in Vegas.

1025
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:46,769
Beat him to death with a bicycle chain.

1026
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:59,657
Tough boy. Real brass boy.

1027
01:33:02,035 --> 01:33:04,036
I knew if we got caught,

1028
01:33:04,663 --> 01:33:08,499
if he dropped his guts,
he'd tell about that guy in Vegas.

1029
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:12,461
I never killed anybody.

1030
01:33:14,673 --> 01:33:16,548
Not before that night.

1031
01:33:19,135 --> 01:33:20,886
'Cause that night,

1032
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,105
I think...

1033
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:37,736
<i>No, I want to remember it the way it was.</i>

1034
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:44,827
<i>We got there around midnight.</i>

1035
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:48,330
This is it.

1036
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,083
This is it.

1037
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:54,753
Let's pull out of here.

1038
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:57,756
Now, before it's too late.

1039
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:09,226
If you're gonna do it,
you'll have to do it alone.

1040
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:14,398
You don't think I got the guts to do it alone.

1041
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:18,235
Okay. I'll show you who's wearing the pants.

1042
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:24,283
How'd you kill that guy in Vegas, anyhow?
Love him to death?

1043
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:28,287
Korean War hero.

1044
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:30,581
Christ!

1045
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:45,095
<i>Why'd I go along with it?</i>

1046
01:34:45,972 --> 01:34:47,848
<i>When it first began...</i>

1047
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:52,770
<i>Who knows when anything really begins?</i>

1048
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:57,608
<i>When Dick first told me the plan
it didn't even seem real.</i>

1049
01:34:58,777 --> 01:35:02,279
<i>Then, the closer we got,
the more real it became.</i>

1050
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:08,577
<i>Like the whole crazy stunt had
a life of its own and nothing could stop it.</i>

1051
01:35:10,163 --> 01:35:12,247
<i>Like I was reading a story</i>

1052
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:14,833
<i>and I had to know what was gonna happen.</i>

1053
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:16,835
<i>How it would end.</i>

1054
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:57,876
Wait.

1055
01:36:06,553 --> 01:36:09,346
If we find the safe,
do you know how to open it?

1056
01:36:10,557 --> 01:36:12,683
I know somebody that knows.

1057
01:36:38,585 --> 01:36:40,711
Honey? Is that you, honey?

1058
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:42,588
Who is it?

1059
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:45,048
- Come with us. Now!
- What?

1060
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:46,341
Come with us.

1061
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,344
Come on. Come.

1062
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:57,811
In the office.

1063
01:37:08,948 --> 01:37:09,990
Now, sir.

1064
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:12,701
Where do you keep that safe?

1065
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:16,288
What safe? I don't have any safe.

1066
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:19,625
Don't lie to me, you son of a bitch.

1067
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:24,296
I know you got a safe.
Right here. In this office.

1068
01:37:25,131 --> 01:37:27,633
I'm sorry, but there isn't any safe.

1069
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,718
There never was a safe.

1070
01:37:32,222 --> 01:37:33,847
Any other phones?

1071
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:36,850
One. In the kitchen.

1072
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:40,062
Now, sir,

1073
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:44,358
unlock this cabinet.

1074
01:37:44,484 --> 01:37:46,109
It's not locked.

1075
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:54,743
Okay.

1076
01:37:56,246 --> 01:37:57,663
Where is it?

1077
01:38:14,681 --> 01:38:16,306
Come on, move it.

1078
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,230
All right, now. The money, dig it up.

1079
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:35,742
Thirty-one lousy dollars.

1080
01:38:37,704 --> 01:38:39,454
A rich man like you.

1081
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:42,916
You gotta have more money than this.

1082
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:45,627
Not in cash. I can write you a cheque.

1083
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:49,006
A cheque?

1084
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:51,717
- What kind of...
- Don't do that!

1085
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:54,052
- There's somebody awake upstairs.
- My family.

1086
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:56,096
The only people upstairs

1087
01:38:56,389 --> 01:38:59,516
are my wife, my son and daughter.

1088
01:38:59,726 --> 01:39:02,352
Your wife, she got any money?

1089
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:07,190
- Please, she's not well.
- Sure. Sure, pops.

1090
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:12,154
- Upstairs.
- My glasses. I can't see without my glasses.

1091
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:20,746
Upstairs, upstairs.

1092
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:31,256
Why do you boys want to do this?

1093
01:39:31,341 --> 01:39:32,799
I never harmed you.

1094
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,093
I never saw you before.

1095
01:39:35,178 --> 01:39:38,138
Shut up.
When we want you to talk, we'll tell you.

1096
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:48,148
It's all right, sweetheart, don't be afraid.

1097
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:51,652
- These men, they just want some money.
- Money?

1098
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:54,071
They believe we have money
hidden in a safe.

1099
01:39:54,197 --> 01:39:57,658
- I told them we didn't, but they don't...
- Didn't I tell you to shut up?

1100
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:00,661
He's telling you God's truth.
There isn't any safe.

1101
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:05,248
I know goddamn well you got a safe.
And you better tell him to find it fast!

1102
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:06,500
Dick.

1103
01:40:11,673 --> 01:40:15,384
Floyd Wells lied to you. There isn't any safe.

1104
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:19,930
Tie them up.

1105
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:24,393
Okay, lady. In the bathroom.

1106
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:35,529
Please, don't hurt anybody.

1107
01:40:36,072 --> 01:40:39,408
They don't mean to hurt anyone.
Isn't that right?

1108
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:48,625
All they want is some money.
And then they'll go away.

1109
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:54,798
Please, don't hurt the children.

1110
01:40:58,261 --> 01:41:01,138
Good grief! What is this?
Some kind of joke?

1111
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:08,562
Make one move, holler once,

1112
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:11,314
and we'll cut their throats.

1113
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:15,152
All right. You two, downstairs.

1114
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,096
Dick! In here.

1115
01:41:50,646 --> 01:41:52,272
You. Over there.

1116
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:24,679
What's this? A casket?

1117
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:26,723
Hope chest.

1118
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:29,392
It's a wedding present for my sister.

1119
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:33,313
- Yeah?
- Not her. She's too young.

1120
01:42:34,482 --> 01:42:36,691
They're never too young, kid.

1121
01:42:42,031 --> 01:42:43,698
Hey! Pops!

1122
01:42:47,078 --> 01:42:49,913
You better pray I find that safe.

1123
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:02,926
Kenyon?

1124
01:43:05,555 --> 01:43:06,596
Dad?

1125
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:29,119
You're cold?

1126
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:30,537
Yes.

1127
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:03,612
If all you want is money, then why?

1128
01:44:06,157 --> 01:44:09,451
If you do that to my wife, she'll panic.

1129
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:51,534
My mother, please be careful. Please.

1130
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:20,063
That other man,
I'm afraid he'll hurt someone.

1131
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:23,566
Please, he can have money, anything,

1132
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:27,946
but, please, don't let him hurt my little girl.

1133
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:32,367
Don't...

1134
01:45:32,618 --> 01:45:34,202
Please, don't.

1135
01:45:35,955 --> 01:45:37,330
You ever had a man?

1136
01:45:37,415 --> 01:45:39,082
Please, don't.

1137
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:48,758
What's eating at you?

1138
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:50,927
You find the safe?

1139
01:45:51,929 --> 01:45:53,471
Later.

1140
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:56,641
- First I'm gonna bust that little girl.
- No.

1141
01:45:57,393 --> 01:46:00,437
What do you care? You can bust her, too.

1142
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:02,772
No.

1143
01:46:04,442 --> 01:46:05,608
Okay, honey.

1144
01:46:09,947 --> 01:46:11,656
Get the kid's radio.

1145
01:46:13,284 --> 01:46:15,118
And then go downstairs.

1146
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:32,302
I despise people
who can't control themselves.

1147
01:46:43,481 --> 01:46:45,106
You go to school?

1148
01:46:46,192 --> 01:46:47,400
The university

1149
01:46:47,485 --> 01:46:50,487
next year. To study music and art.

1150
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:54,657
I play the guitar.

1151
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:57,160
Draw some, too.

1152
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,998
Only got as far as the third grade.

1153
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:07,504
You like horses?

1154
01:47:09,298 --> 01:47:10,381
Yes.

1155
01:47:12,635 --> 01:47:14,010
My mother

1156
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:19,557
was a champion rider. In the rodeo.

1157
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,145
And my father...

1158
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:32,695
My father...

1159
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:05,270
Okay. What's the matter?

1160
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:10,066
Us. We're the matter. We're ridiculous.

1161
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:14,195
You tapping the walls
for a safe that isn't there.

1162
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:17,240
Tap, tap, tapping
like some nutty woodpecker.

1163
01:48:19,076 --> 01:48:20,243
And me.

1164
01:48:21,412 --> 01:48:23,204
Crawling around on the floor

1165
01:48:23,414 --> 01:48:25,373
with my legs on fire.

1166
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:33,089
And all to steal a kid's silver dollar.

1167
01:48:37,553 --> 01:48:38,928
Ridiculous!

1168
01:48:39,471 --> 01:48:41,055
This is stupid!

1169
01:48:49,982 --> 01:48:52,942
What are you sore about? We got no beef.

1170
01:48:53,068 --> 01:48:54,819
It's us against them.

1171
01:48:56,322 --> 01:48:58,114
This is between us.

1172
01:48:59,116 --> 01:49:01,201
It's got nothing to do with them.

1173
01:49:05,206 --> 01:49:07,624
Look at me, boy! Take a good look!

1174
01:49:08,292 --> 01:49:11,336
I'm the last living thing
you're ever gonna see.

1175
01:50:36,422 --> 01:50:38,881
Don't. Please, don't.

1176
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:04,782
It doesn't make sense.

1177
01:51:05,909 --> 01:51:07,785
I mean what happened.

1178
01:51:08,412 --> 01:51:09,662
Or why.

1179
01:51:11,582 --> 01:51:14,417
It had nothing to do with the Clutters.

1180
01:51:14,626 --> 01:51:17,920
They never hurt me,
they just happened to be there.

1181
01:51:20,132 --> 01:51:23,426
I thought Mr Clutter
was a very nice gentleman.

1182
01:51:26,347 --> 01:51:29,932
I thought so right up until the time
I cut his throat.

1183
01:52:38,502 --> 01:52:40,837
Mercy for them.

1184
01:52:42,214 --> 01:52:43,673
The killers.

1185
01:52:44,967 --> 01:52:48,177
How fortunate that their admirable attorneys

1186
01:52:49,263 --> 01:52:53,099
were not present at the Clutter home
that fateful evening.

1187
01:52:53,308 --> 01:52:56,144
How very fortunate for them
that they were not there

1188
01:52:56,228 --> 01:52:59,814
to plead mercy for the doomed family,

1189
01:53:00,524 --> 01:53:02,567
because otherwise,

1190
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:05,653
we would have found their corpses, too.

1191
01:53:06,947 --> 01:53:09,490
If you allow them life imprisonment,

1192
01:53:10,868 --> 01:53:14,162
they will be eligible for parole
in seven years.

1193
01:53:14,913 --> 01:53:17,623
That is the law.

1194
01:53:20,085 --> 01:53:21,502
Gentlemen,

1195
01:53:22,087 --> 01:53:24,046
four of your neighbours

1196
01:53:24,465 --> 01:53:27,884
were slaughtered like hogs in a pen

1197
01:53:28,469 --> 01:53:29,844
by them.

1198
01:53:32,389 --> 01:53:35,475
They did not strike suddenly
in the heat of passion,

1199
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:37,518
but for money.

1200
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,730
They did not kill in vengeance.

1201
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:43,483
They planned it for money.

1202
01:53:44,568 --> 01:53:46,068
And how cheaply

1203
01:53:46,528 --> 01:53:48,571
those lives were bought.

1204
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:51,824
$40.

1205
01:53:53,327 --> 01:53:55,244
$10 a life.

1206
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:59,415
They drove 400 miles to come here,

1207
01:54:00,584 --> 01:54:03,044
they brought their weapons with them.

1208
01:54:03,128 --> 01:54:06,923
This shotgun, this dagger.

1209
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:10,551
This is the rope
that they hogtied their victims with.

1210
01:54:15,766 --> 01:54:18,100
This is the blood they spilled.

1211
01:54:22,773 --> 01:54:24,315
Herb Clutter's.

1212
01:54:26,568 --> 01:54:29,737
They who had no pity, now ask for yours.

1213
01:54:30,656 --> 01:54:34,116
They who had no mercy, now ask for yours.

1214
01:54:34,952 --> 01:54:38,329
They who had no tears, now ask for yours.

1215
01:54:38,997 --> 01:54:42,708
If you have tears to shed, weep not for them,

1216
01:54:43,961 --> 01:54:46,003
weep for their victims.

1217
01:54:46,797 --> 01:54:51,717
From the way the Holy Bible
was quoted here today,

1218
01:54:52,135 --> 01:54:56,722
you might think the word of God
was written only to protect the killers.

1219
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:59,684
But they didn't read you this.

1220
01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:02,770
Exodus 20,

1221
01:55:03,397 --> 01:55:05,731
verse 13.

1222
01:55:06,316 --> 01:55:08,901
"Thou shalt not kill."

1223
01:55:10,404 --> 01:55:11,445
Or this.

1224
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:15,408
Genesis 9, verse 12.

1225
01:55:16,410 --> 01:55:19,412
"Who so shedeth man's blood,

1226
01:55:20,038 --> 01:55:24,250
"By man shall his blood be shed."

1227
01:55:34,469 --> 01:55:37,263
<i>It took four hours to pick the jury.</i>

1228
01:55:38,682 --> 01:55:41,601
<i>It took the state three days
to present its case.</i>

1229
01:55:44,062 --> 01:55:46,689
<i>It took the defence one hour and a half.</i>

1230
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:51,027
<i>It took the jury</i>

1231
01:55:51,111 --> 01:55:53,571
<i>40 minutes to bring in the verdict.</i>

1232
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:01,704
<i>They had to be crazy.</i>

1233
01:56:02,706 --> 01:56:06,375
<i>No. Maybe stupid, but perfectly sane.</i>

1234
01:56:08,086 --> 01:56:10,087
<i>How can a perfectly sane man</i>

1235
01:56:11,506 --> 01:56:13,716
<i>commit an absolutely crazy act?</i>

1236
01:56:40,369 --> 01:56:42,995
<i>Calling all stations, Officer Linhard,</i>

1237
01:56:43,246 --> 01:56:44,830
<i>Officer Brackin.</i>

1238
01:56:45,082 --> 01:56:47,249
<i>Please come to the desk sergeant's office.</i>

1239
01:56:47,751 --> 01:56:51,420
<i>Calling all stations, Officer Wright.
Officer C. Wright.</i>

1240
01:56:51,838 --> 01:56:53,631
<i>Please call the desk sergeant.</i>

1241
01:56:57,761 --> 01:57:00,763
- What happens now?
- They wait to die.

1242
01:57:02,808 --> 01:57:05,976
I wonder how many others
are waiting in other prisons?

1243
01:57:06,186 --> 01:57:07,520
About 200.

1244
01:57:16,363 --> 01:57:19,657
<i>Perry and Dick began their waiting
in the "S and I" building.</i>

1245
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,618
<i>Security and Isolation.</i>

1246
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:28,124
<i>The second floor is death row.</i>

1247
01:57:37,884 --> 01:57:41,137
<i>Through the window
they can see the baseball field.</i>

1248
01:57:43,849 --> 01:57:46,475
<i>Beyond the outfield, over the wall</i>

1249
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:50,020
<i>is an old warehouse with a tin roof.</i>

1250
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:55,818
This warehouse got a name?

1251
01:57:57,237 --> 01:58:00,030
In this prison, it's called "The Corner."

1252
01:58:00,323 --> 01:58:04,285
On hanging day, the men say,
"He's gone to 'The Corner'."

1253
01:58:05,704 --> 01:58:08,372
Perry and Dick have a date at "The Corner."

1254
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:13,419
One minute after midnight. May, Friday 13.

1255
01:58:20,343 --> 01:58:23,345
<i>According to an expert in forensic medicine,</i>

1256
01:58:23,847 --> 01:58:26,557
<i>neither one of them
would have done it alone.</i>

1257
01:58:26,641 --> 01:58:29,518
<i>But together, they made a third personality.</i>

1258
01:58:30,353 --> 01:58:32,146
<i>That's the one that did it.</i>

1259
01:58:37,402 --> 01:58:38,736
Hey, Andy!

1260
01:58:40,071 --> 01:58:44,283
Does it tell anywhere in them books
what happens when you make the big drop?

1261
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:46,911
Well, your neck breaks

1262
01:58:48,830 --> 01:58:50,915
and you crap your pants.

1263
01:58:52,667 --> 01:58:56,295
The trouble with you, Andy,
you got no respect for human life,

1264
01:58:56,379 --> 01:58:58,172
not even your own.

1265
01:59:19,069 --> 01:59:23,489
<i>Doomsday, Friday 13, came and went,</i>

1266
01:59:24,491 --> 01:59:26,534
<i>but no one went to "The Corner."</i>

1267
01:59:28,370 --> 01:59:31,163
<i>Perry and Dick appealed. Routine.</i>

1268
01:59:32,833 --> 01:59:36,335
<i>They were granted a stay of execution.
Routine.</i>

1269
01:59:37,546 --> 01:59:42,758
<i>The legal machinery in capital cases
usually runs a year or more. Routine.</i>

1270
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:46,428
<i>Death row has its own routine.</i>

1271
01:59:48,515 --> 01:59:51,559
<i>Shower. One man at a time, once a week.</i>

1272
01:59:52,602 --> 01:59:54,353
<i>Shave, twice a week.</i>

1273
01:59:54,938 --> 01:59:57,439
<i>The guard locks the safety razor.</i>

1274
01:59:58,275 --> 01:59:59,775
<i>Safety first.</i>

1275
02:00:00,902 --> 02:00:04,864
<i>No radios, no movies, no TV.</i>

1276
02:00:06,116 --> 02:00:08,951
<i>No cards, no games, no exercise.</i>

1277
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:13,122
<i>No mirrors, no bottles, no glasses.</i>

1278
02:00:14,082 --> 02:00:15,791
<i>No knives, no forks.</i>

1279
02:00:16,793 --> 02:00:18,544
<i>No suicide allowed.</i>

1280
02:00:18,962 --> 02:00:20,963
<i>They could eat, sleep,</i>

1281
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:24,633
<i>write, read, think, dream.</i>

1282
02:00:25,135 --> 02:00:27,469
<i>They could pray, if so inclined.</i>

1283
02:00:27,721 --> 02:00:30,472
<i>But mostly, they just waited.</i>

1284
02:00:32,642 --> 02:00:36,604
The guy in the next cell, Andy.
He's been waiting two years.

1285
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:40,774
Newspapers call him
"The nicest boy in Kansas."

1286
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:44,153
One night he killed his sister.

1287
02:00:45,155 --> 02:00:49,825
Then he shot his mother six times
and his father seventeen times.

1288
02:00:51,411 --> 02:00:53,329
Andy's a nut, but I like him.

1289
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:56,665
Hey, Andy. Say hello to Mr Jensen.

1290
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:59,335
He's writing the story of my life.

1291
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:01,503
Why?

1292
02:01:03,757 --> 02:01:05,591
I told you he was a nut.

1293
02:01:05,675 --> 02:01:08,844
Ronnie, Jim, meet Mr Jensen.

1294
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:13,807
They knocked off seven. Strangers.

1295
02:01:14,684 --> 02:01:17,353
Ronnie said they was better off dead.

1296
02:01:20,357 --> 02:01:23,108
What about Perry? Don't you get along?

1297
02:01:25,153 --> 02:01:27,863
Nobody can get along with him.

1298
02:01:28,782 --> 02:01:31,617
There's five guys waiting here
for the big swing.

1299
02:01:32,202 --> 02:01:36,121
Little Perry's the only one yapping
against capital punishment.

1300
02:01:36,998 --> 02:01:39,124
Don't tell me you're for it?

1301
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:43,170
Hell, hanging's only getting revenge.

1302
02:01:44,297 --> 02:01:46,340
What's wrong with revenge?

1303
02:01:47,342 --> 02:01:49,885
I've been revenging myself all my life.

1304
02:01:51,554 --> 02:01:54,640
Sure. I'm for hanging.

1305
02:01:56,393 --> 02:01:59,311
Just so long as I'm not the one
being hanged.

1306
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:02,898
See you.

1307
02:02:03,358 --> 02:02:05,359
Thanks for the magazines.

1308
02:02:06,903 --> 02:02:09,738
Jim, you think that looks like Willie Jay?

1309
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:12,324
The way you see him, yes.

1310
02:02:14,744 --> 02:02:18,539
That day at the bus station,
when I phoned you.

1311
02:02:19,916 --> 02:02:23,752
If Willie Jay and I had connected,
none of this would have happened.

1312
02:02:23,878 --> 02:02:28,257
- Maybe, if you hadn't come back to Kansas.
- Maybe!

1313
02:02:28,675 --> 02:02:31,593
If they'd had a head-doctor here
during my first stretch,

1314
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:34,430
he would've known
I had a bomb ticking inside of me.

1315
02:02:34,514 --> 02:02:36,682
He would've known
I wasn't ready for parole.

1316
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:38,267
- You knew.
- Yeah.

1317
02:02:38,768 --> 02:02:40,436
Why didn't you tell me?

1318
02:02:42,272 --> 02:02:45,941
Then I wouldn't have gotten my parole,
would I, Reverend?

1319
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:53,657
<i>A few minutes after midnight, in November,</i>

1320
02:02:55,243 --> 02:02:57,494
<i>one of them went to "The Corner."</i>

1321
02:02:58,663 --> 02:03:03,459
<i>The others watched him cross the ball field
on his way to the gallows.</i>

1322
02:03:04,753 --> 02:03:06,128

1323
02:03:06,838 --> 02:03:08,964
<i>"The nicest boy in Kansas."</i>

1324

1327
02:03:27,692 --> 02:03:30,486
<i>For Andy, the waiting was over.</i>

1328
02:03:32,989 --> 02:03:35,324
<i>Perry and Dick waited five years.</i>

1329
02:03:36,117 --> 02:03:39,995
<i>Three times their case went
to the United States Supreme Court.</i>

1330
02:04:09,818 --> 02:04:12,694
My God! That harness!

1331
02:04:13,988 --> 02:04:18,367
Richard, this is a warrant from
the Supreme Court of the State of Kansas.

1332
02:04:18,993 --> 02:04:21,078
"Whereas, it was by this court ordered

1333

1338
02:04:37,512 --> 02:04:38,887
Where's Smith?

1339
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:43,350
"Yea, let none that wait for thee
be ashamed.

1340
02:04:43,434 --> 02:04:46,687
"Let them be ashamed

for thou art the God"

1343
02:04:54,821 --> 02:04:55,821
I...

1344
02:04:58,867 --> 02:05:00,617
I gotta go to the toilet.

1345
02:05:00,743 --> 02:05:04,079
We can't remove the harness.
There might not be time.

1346
02:05:05,623 --> 02:05:06,874
Please.

1347
02:05:06,958 --> 02:05:08,917
Try to control yourself.

1348
02:05:10,086 --> 02:05:11,587
But that's it.

1349
02:05:12,589 --> 02:05:16,425
When you hit the end of the rope
your muscles lose control.

1350
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:24,349
I'm afraid I'll mess myself.

1351
02:05:24,434 --> 02:05:27,603
It's nothing to be ashamed of. They all do it.

1352
02:05:28,271 --> 02:05:30,314
For God's sake, man!

1353

1356
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:53,503
Is he the...

1357
02:05:55,298 --> 02:05:57,674
How much does he get paid to hang them?

1358
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:59,927
$300 a man.

1359
02:06:01,638 --> 02:06:03,305
Has he got a name?

1360
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,682
"We, the people."

1361

"...for the State of Kansas."

1362
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:11,521
Anything you want to say?

1363
02:06:13,483 --> 02:06:17,653
Just that I hold no hard feelings.

1364
02:06:19,530 --> 02:06:23,659
You're sending me to a better world
than this ever was.

1365
02:06:28,831 --> 02:06:30,332
Nice to see you.

1366
02:06:48,935 --> 02:06:51,520
Jim, Thoreau,

1367
02:06:52,689 --> 02:06:54,523
on man and nature.

1368
02:06:54,732 --> 02:06:56,858
It's yours if you want it.

1369
02:07:00,196 --> 02:07:01,530
Dick gone?

1370
02:07:02,907 --> 02:07:05,033
Is his heart still beating?

1371
02:07:09,539 --> 02:07:12,082
- What time is it?
- Take it easy, kid.

1372
02:07:16,296 --> 02:07:19,047
Would you like me to write your father?

1373
02:07:21,551 --> 02:07:24,219
I could send him one of your paintings.

1374
02:07:24,304 --> 02:07:26,388
Or maybe your Bronze Star.

1375
02:07:31,227 --> 02:07:33,228
Send him my treasure maps.

1376
02:07:34,647 --> 02:07:36,732
Maybe now he'll get lucky.

1377
02:07:39,235 --> 02:07:40,944
The Lone Wolf.

1378
02:07:43,906 --> 02:07:48,744
You know, there was a time once
when we almost had it made.

1379
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:51,747
Just the two of us.

1380
02:07:53,458 --> 02:07:58,170
He was in a fever about some new project
up in Alaska.

1381
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:01,006
A hunting lodge for tourists.

1382
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:05,427
It was gonna make us a fortune
better than a gold mine.

1383
02:08:07,096 --> 02:08:11,099
But most of all, it was gonna be something
we never had before.

1384
02:08:12,602 --> 02:08:14,102
A real home.

1385
02:08:15,438 --> 02:08:17,022
We got it built, too.

1386
02:08:17,273 --> 02:08:19,858
Just him and me, side by side.

1387
02:08:20,443 --> 02:08:24,780
The day the roof was finished,
he danced all over it.

1388
02:08:26,282 --> 02:08:28,825
I never was so happy in all my life.

1389
02:08:30,203 --> 02:08:32,788
It was a beautiful home.

1390
02:08:38,461 --> 02:08:40,837
But no tourists ever came.

1391
02:08:41,964 --> 02:08:43,799
Nobody.

1392
02:08:45,802 --> 02:08:47,469
We just lived there

1393
02:08:47,678 --> 02:08:52,140
all alone in that big, empty failure,

1394
02:08:56,312 --> 02:08:59,022
till he couldn't stand the sight of me.

1395
02:09:02,652 --> 02:09:04,486
I think it happened...

1396
02:09:06,739 --> 02:09:08,824
I was eating a biscuit.

1397
02:09:10,159 --> 02:09:13,662
He started yelling what a greedy,
selfish bastard I was.

1398
02:09:14,705 --> 02:09:17,124
Yelling and yelling till I grabbed his throat.

1399
02:09:17,208 --> 02:09:19,084
I couldn't stop myself.

1400
02:09:19,502 --> 02:09:21,670
He tore loose and got a gun.

1401
02:09:23,339 --> 02:09:25,841
He said, "Look at me, boy!

1402
02:09:27,593 --> 02:09:32,097
"Take a good look 'cause I'm the
last living thing you're ever gonna see."

1403
02:09:35,977 --> 02:09:38,019
And he pulled the trigger.

1404
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:42,983
But the gun wasn't loaded.

1405
02:09:45,069 --> 02:09:46,653
He began to cry.

1406
02:09:49,532 --> 02:09:51,199
Bawled like a kid.

1407
02:09:53,494 --> 02:09:55,162
I went for a long walk.

1408
02:09:57,039 --> 02:09:59,249
When I got back, the place was dark.

1409
02:10:00,334 --> 02:10:02,127
The door was locked.

1410
02:10:03,546 --> 02:10:06,840
All my stuff was piled outside in the snow

1411
02:10:07,341 --> 02:10:09,050
where he threw it.

1412
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:12,512
I walked away and never looked back.

1413
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:19,019
I guess the only thing I'm gonna miss
in this world

1414
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,355
is that poor old man

1415
02:10:24,150 --> 02:10:26,193
and his hopeless dreams.

1416
02:10:31,282 --> 02:10:34,242
I'm glad you don't hate your father anymore.

1417
02:10:35,786 --> 02:10:37,078
But I do.

1418
02:10:39,832 --> 02:10:41,208
I hate him.

1419
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:45,420
And I love him.

1420
02:11:12,573 --> 02:11:14,658
- Coming?
- What for?

1421
02:11:14,909 --> 02:11:16,952
What does it add up to, anyway?

1422
02:11:17,453 --> 02:11:20,705
Well, four innocent
and two guilty people murdered.

1423
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:22,666
Three families broken.

1424
02:11:23,167 --> 02:11:25,126
Newspapers have sold more papers.

1425
02:11:25,211 --> 02:11:27,546
Politicians will make more speeches.

1426
02:11:27,922 --> 02:11:30,840
Police and parole boards
will get more blame.

1427
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:33,677
More laws will be passed.

1428
02:11:33,886 --> 02:11:36,263
Everybody will pass the buck.

1429
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:40,392
And then, next month, next year,

1430
02:11:41,477 --> 02:11:43,478
the same thing will happen again.

1431
02:11:44,063 --> 02:11:46,690
Well, maybe this will help to stop it.

1432
02:11:47,358 --> 02:11:48,692
Never has.

1433
02:12:04,667 --> 02:12:09,504
Perry, this is a warrant from the
Supreme Court of the State of Kansas.

1434
02:12:11,257 --> 02:12:15,343
"It was by the court ordered that execution
of the sentence of death by hanging

1435
02:12:15,428 --> 02:12:16,970
"of Perry Edward Smith

1436
02:12:17,054 --> 02:12:20,098
"imposed by the District Court
of Finney County, Kansas,

1437
02:12:20,182 --> 02:12:23,685
"be carried out on Wednesday,
April 14, 1965."

1438
02:12:27,148 --> 02:12:29,149
Anything you want to say?

1439
02:12:34,113 --> 02:12:35,322
Perry?

1440
02:12:36,741 --> 02:12:38,408
I think maybe

1441
02:12:41,370 --> 02:12:43,288
I'd like to apologise.

1442
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:47,375
But who to?

1443
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:53,465
Who?

1444
02:13:10,024 --> 02:13:13,068
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

1445
02:13:13,235 --> 02:13:16,071
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1446
02:13:16,238 --> 02:13:18,865
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.

1447
02:13:18,949 --> 02:13:20,742
"He restoreth my soul.

1448
02:13:21,327 --> 02:13:25,080
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

1449
02:13:25,623 --> 02:13:29,542
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

1450
02:13:29,752 --> 02:13:31,753
"I will fear no evil.

1451
02:13:31,962 --> 02:13:33,672
"For thou art with me.

1452
02:13:33,756 --> 02:13:36,508
"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

1453
02:13:37,259 --> 02:13:40,929
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

1454
02:13:41,097 --> 02:13:43,431
"Thou anointest my head with oil."

1455
02:13:44,183 --> 02:13:46,226
Is God in this place, too?

1456
02:13:49,397 --> 02:13:51,147
"My cup runneth over.

1457
02:13:52,441 --> 02:13:56,611
"Surely goodness and mercy
will follow me all the days of my life.

1458
02:13:57,488 --> 02:14:00,782
"And I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."
