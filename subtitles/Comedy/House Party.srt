{90091}{90144}He promised us a ride home.

{95596}{95662}Now l know|it's time for us to go.
{95663}{95704}Let's go out the back way.
{95705}{95828}l told Play l'd help clean up.|l don't want to run into him.
{95829}{95953}You'd run into a lot more|than Play out front.
{95967}{96053}What are you doing on Friday?
{96054}{96147}l don't know.|Why don't you call me tomorrow?
{96147}{96235}A lot of guys get nervous|in the projects.
{96236}{96288}Why would they be punks|like that?
{96289}{96382}After Mr. Williams' son started|sniping people from the roof...
{96383}{96464}guys drop me off on the corner|and tell me to call them.
{96561}{96627}l shouldn't make plans|for this weekend.
{96628}{96677}lt depends if my father|lets me off punishment...
{96678}{96726}for getting into|that fight at school.
{96727}{96780}Friday may not be|good for me, either.
{96781}{96865}We'll talk tomorrow in school.
{97092}{97166}-Come on, now.|-Don't beg.
{97198}{97226}Later.

{98042}{98090}Do l detect jealousy?
{98115}{98197}Why tease him?|"Let's get together Friday."
{98198}{98242}Didn't you say|the same shit to Play?
{98243}{98303}One's in trouble,|the other one's available.
{98304}{98330}l'm just playing averages.
{98331}{98371}They're friends!
{98372}{98434}Cute ones always travel|in packs.
{98435}{98506}But why is old ugly Bilal|with his breath...
{98507}{98551}hanging out with them?
{98551}{98607}l can't believe|you're acting like this.
{98608}{98663}What?
{98688}{98742}Let me tell you something.|Life is short.
{98743}{98804}lf you want something,|let the chips fall.
{98805}{98853}You're mad because|you didn't catch one.
{98854}{98904}That may not be by accident.
{98905}{98998}You didn't like him|till he was up on me.
{98999}{99058}That is bullshit.|He was up on me first.
{99059}{99149}Why you think|l didn't talk to him...
{99150}{99194}even though l knew|you were playing him?
{99195}{99251}Then you put him|all up in my face.
{99251}{99307}l'm out of here.|l don't want to hear it.
{99331}{99400}He's still got|to walk you home, right?
{99401}{99454}lf you think l'm dogging him,|try and take him.
{99455}{99528}-l ain't like you.|-That's why you're mad.
{99529}{99589}-Ho.|-l heard you.
{99728}{99764}What's wrong?
{99765}{99837}You don't have to walk me home.
{99838}{99907}-l don't mind.|-l kind of do mind.
{99908}{99996}You beefed at me all night.|What did l do to you?
{99997}{100062}You didn't do anything.
{100063}{100114}lt's just l want to be alone.
{100115}{100158}l don't think|that's a good idea...
{100159}{100239}so l'm going to bug you|all the way home.
{100239}{100298}You should be|heading home yourself.
{100299}{100352}Why? l'm already in trouble.
{100353}{100427}Might as well have fun now|and suffer later.
{100428}{100478}l can only die once.
{100479}{100534}Yeah, but punishments|are forever.
{100535}{100574}That's true.
{100575}{100647}One time my father put me|on punishment for a month...
{100647}{100697}because l came home late|from a party.
{100698}{100742}l still get depressed|thinking about that.
{100743}{100822}Think about it|when the time comes.
{100823}{100960}My pops is cool,|but he's too overprotective.
{100961}{101042}l heard about your mom's|passing. l'm sorry.
{101043}{101143}Yeah. That was a while ago.
{101144}{101208}What do your folks do?
{101209}{101263}My dad owns|a couple of grocery stores.
{101264}{101347}l know y'all|been snacking down.
{101348}{101420}Crazy chips and dips.
{101421}{101487}My mom works in a bank|in bookkeeping.
{101488}{101538}At least you got a job|when you graduate.
{101539}{101579}But l'm going to college.
{101580}{101609}So am l.
{101610}{101665}l already started checking out|the applications.
{101666}{101753}Really? Aren't those|applications confusing?
{101754}{101814}Especially|those lvy League schools.
{101815}{101880}l ain't getting|all that far yet...
{101881}{101946}lvy League|or nothing like that.
{101996}{102035}What's up, fellas?
{102036}{102096}You didn't take all the women|while we were gone?
{102097}{102170}-A few.|-Right.
{102171}{102255}-Someone is living foul.|-This nigger here.
{102256}{102290}Take care of that, please.
{102291}{102333}Did y'all two watch|the stuff like l asked?
{102334}{102363}Because if a brother|like Play get vict...
{102364}{102422}l'll have to do|some body and fender work.
{102423}{102478}There was some niggers|clocking your shit.
{102479}{102530}Was they clocking it as hard|as you should be clocking...
{102531}{102581}them bugs dropping|out of your hair?

{102637}{102701}-Bob who?|-Bob Wire, motherfucker.
{102725}{102748}Real funny, man.
{102749}{102819}You're crazy.
{102819}{102852}Who broke the toilet?
{102895}{102921}l don't know.
{102922}{103003}Don't play me like this.|Who broke the toilet?
{103004}{103078}lt was like that|when l came in here, wasn't it?
{103079}{103119}Bet it was that nigger|in the leather jacket.
{103120}{103180}-He could shit some bricks.|-Neck like Mike Tyson.
{103181}{103232}"Play, when's your next party?"
{103233}{103286}l put you in my house,|and you dog me.
{103287}{103339}Look at the log|in that motherfucker.
{103340}{103398}l got to do something|before my mother gets back.

{103696}{103731}What?
{103732}{103779}Don't say nothing to me, man.
{103780}{103851}When you see me in the streets,|don't say nothing.
{103852}{103880}l ain't no plumber.
{103881}{103917}Step!
{103918}{103946}l didn't even piss.
{103947}{104021}-That's cold.|-Just step.
{104022}{104059}-Peace, man.|-Damn.
{104156}{104183}Shit!
{104190}{104227}Hold up, OK?
{104293}{104360}Good. l beat them home.
{104361}{104457}You girls scheme on a level|guys don't have a clue about.
{104515}{104607}l'm glad you let me|walk you home.
{104608}{104646}You're all right.
{104647}{104719}You pretty chill your damn self.
{104755}{104779}Did you kiss her?
{104815}{104842}Did l kiss who?
{104886}{104941}Tonight. Did you kiss Sharane?
{104967}{104999}No, l didn't.
{105047}{105076}But you wanted to.
{105077}{105147}Well...
{105148}{105188}But l didn't.
{105189}{105241}And l didn't know her|the way l know you now.
{105352}{105448}OK, so l'll see you later,|all right?
{105499}{105526}Tomorrow.
{105571}{105672}l would let you in|and everything, but...
{105673}{105764}it's late,|and you got to get home...
{105765}{105838}and my parents|will be here any minute.
{105839}{105890}l understand completely.
{105891}{105939}lt's not a problem.
{106819}{106861}Kid, wait.
{106893}{106931}What?
{106932}{106967}What are we doing here?
{106968}{107022}We were doing fine|until you stopped me.
{107023}{107065}A few minutes ago...
{107066}{107121}you were trying to make|a date with my best friend.
{107122}{107149}This isn't right.
{107150}{107186}lt's not right?
{107187}{107219}l'll tell you what's not right--
{107219}{107279}the way you keep fronting on me.
{107280}{107367}So all you want is sex,|even from best friends?
{107368}{107414}l ain't forcing you|to do nothing.
{107415}{107486}lf you want me to leave, fine.
{107487}{107540}No problem.
{107541}{107611}Wait, wait, wait.|Sidney, wait up.
{107611}{107656}What is it you're asking me?
{107657}{107746}l'm not asking for anything.|lt's about what you want.
{107826}{107858}This is a trick question, right?
{107927}{107983}l ain't going to lie.
{107983}{108015}l'm attracted to both of you...
{108016}{108063}but if l have|to make a choice...
{108064}{108099}and that seems to be|what you're asking--
{108100}{108165}then you're|who l want as a friend.
{108297}{108346}lf you go with someone...
{108347}{108394}you should be friends|as well as lovers.
{108736}{108824}So now that we're friends...
{108848}{108885}let's get with the loving.
{109007}{109044}You think you slick, huh?
{109087}{109147}Now l have a question for you.
{109147}{109178}What?
{109179}{109223}Are you on the pill?
{109224}{109299}No. l don't do this regular.
{109300}{109366}What about|one of those diagrams?
{109367}{109454}That's diaphragm,|and l don't do sponges, either.
{109455}{109544}Don't you have a whatchamacallit|in your wallet?
{109663}{109718}l knew this would come in handy.
{109719}{109787}lt's been in here a while.
{109788}{109830}Still good.
{109919}{109977}All right.
{110131}{110218}l guess it's been in here|a little too long.
{110219}{110255}So, now what?
{110307}{110356}Have you ever...
{110357}{110399}No, l never, no.
{110424}{110475}l don't know why l asked that.
{110476}{110519}l don't even know why|l asked about birth control.
{110520}{110589}Most guys wouldn't care|if you had it or not.
{110590}{110684}That's why l like you.|There'll be other times.
{110685}{110746}lt'll probably be|a long time from now.
{110878}{110942}Sorry, Kid.
{110943}{111040}That's what they call me.|"Sorry Kid."
{111098}{111146}That's not what l call you.

{111665}{111759}l don't know how those hoodlums|got into the party.
{111760}{111798}You should've pressed charges.
{111799}{111857}Not with those|fascist cops there.
{111858}{111904}lf l'd met that hoodlum|in the street, man to boy...
{111905}{111966}l'd punch him|in his snot locker.
{111967}{112050}You know l don't like|to be sucker-punched.
{112051}{112107}You've tried it|a couple of times.
{112201}{112259}What are you doing?|Are you crazy?
{112260}{112334}-How am l supposed to get out?|-Back door!
{112843}{112873}Mama?
{112874}{112941}Sidney, you're awake.

{113086}{113146}That's my little baby.

{113535}{113581}-ls that Princess?|-l'll see.
{113627}{113678}lt's probably nothing.|See? lt stopped.

{114025}{114072}Those cops are always|fucking with--
