<i>My name's Clanton!
This is my boy Ike! My oldest boy!</i>

14
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:54,901
Any sweet water up beyond?

15
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:58,132
<i>Yeah, two, three miles,
straight up the trail!</i>

16
00:02:58,206 --> 00:03:00,140
<i>Cattle look pretty scrawny!</i>

00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,540
<i>Yeah!</i>

18
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,805
<i>Me and my brothers
were trailin' 'em on to California!</i>

19
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,838
<i>If you ain't got 'em committed to no shipper,
I'll take 'em off your hands!</i>

20
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:12,044
<i>Not interested!</i>

21

<i>Make you a good offer!
Pay you in silver, three dollars a head!</i>

22
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:16,587
<i>Nope!</i>

23
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:21,328
<i>Might raise it
to five dollars silver!</i>

24
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:23,330
<i>Made more than that in Mexico!</i>

25
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:27,334
<i>They'll be a sorry-lookin' lot
by the time they get to California, son!</i>

26
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:30,200
<i>They'll feed out
when we get to grass country!</i>

27
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:33,206
<i>Sure is rough-lookin'country.</i>

<i>Ain't no cow country!
Mighty different where I come from!</i>

<i>Big town called Tombstone!</i>

31
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:46,244
<i>- A fine town!

Glass of beer!</i>

<i>Well, I'm learnin', tryin'!</i>

<i>That sure is a mighty
pretty piece of brass!</i>

45
00:05:07,268 --> 00:05:09,964
<i>Brass? That's solid silver!</i>

46
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:14,940
<i>Twenty-five American dollars worth
of solid silver! Ain't it, brother Wyatt?</i>

47
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:17,409
<i>Yeah, it sure is, James!

<i>Good evening, gentlemen.
Welcome to the Bon Ton Tonsorial Parlor.</i>

60
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,605
<i>- Barbershop?
- Well, if you wanna call it that!</i>

61
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,206
What can I do for you?

62
00:07:42,256 --> 00:07:44,588
<i>- Shave!
- Haircut?</i>

63
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:47,992
<i>- Shave!
- We give baths too!</i>

64
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:50,030
<i>Shave!</i>

65
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:58,367
<i>I don't know how to work it so good!
Only had it a week!</i>

66
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,135
<i>Come all the way from Chicago!</i>

67
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:07,446
<i>- Say, you fellas miners?
- No!</i>

68
00:08:07,515 --> 00:08:09,449
Prospectors, huh?

69
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:13,886
<i>We're cattlemen.
Just passing through here.</i>

70
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:15,945
<i>Shave, please!</i>

71
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:23,129
Hey!

72
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:27,557
- Hey, barber!

73
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:34,304
What kind of a town is this?

74
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,246
- Barber!

75
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:57,163
<i>Well, Luke, you know your duty!</i>

76
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:59,290
<i>You and your marshals
go on in there and get him out!</i>

77
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:01,300
<i>That's Indian Charlie
in there, drunk!!!</i>

78
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:03,996
<i>And I ain't commitin'
suicide on myself!</i>

79
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:06,005
<i>- Me neither!
- No, sir! I ain't a-goin' in there!</i>

80
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:10,271
<i>What kind of town is this anyway?
Excuse me, ma'am!</i>

81
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:13,507
<i>A man can't get a shave
without getting his head blowed off!</i>

82
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:15,742
<i>You're the marshal?
Go get that drunk Indian outta there!</i>

83
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,750
Why don't you go in
and get him out yourself?

84
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:21,254
<i>- They ain't payin' me for it!
- And they ain't payin' me enough either!</i>

85
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,524
<i>- Ay!</i>

86
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:33,765
Young man, you be careful!

87
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:39,201
Yee-ha!

88
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:53,409
<i>- It's all right, ladies!</i>

89
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:00,720
<i>I don't blame ol' Luke!
I wouldn't go in there either!</i>

90
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:25,882
<i>What kind of a town is this anyway?
Selling liquor to Indians!</i>

91
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:34,224
<i>Put a knot on his head
bigger than a turkey's egg!</i>

92
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:37,196
Indian, get outta town
and stay out!

93
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:43,593
<i>How would you like to stay on here?
As marshal, I mean!</i>

94
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:45,832
<i>Nope! Barber!</i>

95
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:48,101
<i>- 200 a month goes with this badge!
- Not interested!</i>

96
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:51,804
<i>I'm just passin' through, tryin' to
get me a relaxin' little shave!</i>

97
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,279
<i>- We'll make it 250!
- Not interested!</i>

98
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:57,146
<i>Hey, Mr! Bon Ton!</i>

99
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:01,846
<i>- Shave, please!
- Well, we sure wanna thank you, Mr! ...</i>

100
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,288
<i>- Earp! Wyatt Earp!
- What?</i>

101
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:06,986
You're not, by any chance,
the marshal from Dodge City?

102
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:08,995
<i>Ex-marshal!</i>

103
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:22,268
The cattle's gone!

104
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:36,322
James?

105
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:41,017
<i>James!</i>

106
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:26,300
<i>- Mayor, is that marshalin'job still open?
- It sure is!</i>

107
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:28,898
<i>- I'll take it!
- It's yours!</i>

108
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:31,376
<i>Providing my brothers
are my deputies!</i>

109
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,743
<i>- When do you wanna start?
- Now!</i>

110
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:39,018
Who runs the gamblin'
around here?

111
00:12:39,086 --> 00:12:41,020
<i>Doc Holliday, mostly!</i>

112
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:43,022
<i>- Who runs the cattle?
- The Clantons!</i>

113
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,752
<i>Old man Clanton
and his four sons!</i>

114
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,238
<i>Good evening, Mr! Clanton!</i>

115
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:08,406
<i>Good evening!</i>

116
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:12,711
I'm the fella
with the trail herd, remember?

117
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:15,584
<i>Oh, sure, I remember you!</i>

118
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:20,515
<i>You was right!
I didn't get very far with them!</i>

119
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:22,528
<i>They was rustled this evening!</i>

120
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:26,527
That so?

121
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,966
<i>Well, that's too bad!</i>

122
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:38,111
Guess you'll be heading
for California, huh?

123
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:44,549
<i>No, I figured
on stickin' around a while!</i>

124
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:46,552
<i>Got myself a job!</i>

125
00:13:47,988 --> 00:13:51,116
<i>- Cow punchin'?
- Marshalin'!</i>

126
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:55,928
Marshalin'? In Tombstone?

127
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:02,168
<i>Well, good luck to you, Mr! ...</i>

128
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:05,467
<i>Earp. Wyatt Earp.</i>

129
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:40,229
<i>1864!</i>

130
00:14:40,307 --> 00:14:42,502
<i>1882!</i>

131
00:14:44,044 --> 00:14:46,274
<i>Eighteen years!</i>

132
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:51,945
Didn't get much of a chance,
did you, James?

133
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:02,391
<i>I wrote to Pa and Corie Sue!</i>

134
00:15:02,463 --> 00:15:04,988
<i>They're gonna be
all busted up over it!</i>

135
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:10,262
<i>Corie Sue's young, but Pa!!!</i>

136
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:12,362
<i>Guess he'll never get over it!</i>

137
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:18,637
<i>I'll be coming out
to see you regular, James!</i>

138
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:21,977
<i>So will Morg and Virg!</i>

139
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:24,609
<i>We're gonna be around here
for a while!</i>

140
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:30,123
<i>Can't tell, maybe when
we leave this country!!!</i>

141
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:36,060
<i>Young kids like you
will be able to grow up and live safe!</i>

142
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:09,305
<i>Hyah! Hyah!</i>

143
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:33,837
Well, what'd you find out?

144
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,930
<i>I followed their trail
from Clanton country to the river!</i>

145
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:37,941
<i>They're moving cattle all right!</i>

146
00:16:41,112 --> 00:16:45,048
<i>Well, get yourself some sleep!
There's coffee on the stove and some beans!</i>

147
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:48,677
<i>Morg's riding shotgun to Tucson!</i>

148
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:52,746
Say, maybe I'd better ask around
the banks while I'm down there, huh?

149
00:16:52,824 --> 00:16:55,190
<i>No, they're too smart for that!</i>

150
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,878
<i>Chihuahua, sing us
the one about the old blind mule.</i>

151
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:55,841
<i>Hey, Mac, l...
I hear Doc's coming back tonight!</i>

152
00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:57,882
<i>Maybe he is and maybe he ain't!
I ain't heard!</i>

153
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:03,883
Well, uh, do you know
where he's been?

154
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:07,220
<i>Tucson. Over the border.
Who knows where Doc goes?</i>

155
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:17,797
<i>I love poker!</i>

156
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:21,871
<i>Yes, sir, I really love poker!</i>

157
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:26,410
<i>Every hand a different problem!</i>

158
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:30,712
<i>I gotta do
a little figurin' here!</i>

159
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:36,215
<i>What would I do
if I was in your boots, Mr! Gambler?</i>

160
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:46,327
<i>You drew three cards
and I stood pat, and yet you raised me.</i>

161
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:54,567
Now the question is:
What should I do?

162
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:03,438
<i>Yeah, mighty
interesting game... poker!</i>

163
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:05,574
<i>Game of chance!</i>

164
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,819
<i>Listen, miss, I admire poker,
but you're increasing the odds!</i>

165
00:20:15,894 --> 00:20:18,658
<i>I catch you doing that again, I'll run you
back to the Apache reservation!!!</i>

166
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,721
<i>- Listen, Mr! Tin-star Marshal!!!
- Where you belong!</i>

167
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,393
This is Doc Holliday's town,
and when he comes back...

168
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,071
Oh!

169
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:37,239
<i>Sorry, gents, but I don't like
eight-handed poker games!</i>

170
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:39,249
<i>Oh, Mr! Marshal,
you don't think that l...</i>

171
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:42,684
<i>No, no!
Well, where were we?</i>

172
00:20:42,754 --> 00:20:44,688
<i>He just raised you, Marshal!</i>

173
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:49,921
<i>Oh, yeah! Well, seeing as you know
I got three of a kind!!!</i>

174
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:51,928
I guess I'll...

175
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:09,046
<i>Hiya, Doc!</i>

176
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,844
<i>Have a good trip?</i>

177
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,254
<i>Doc Holliday.</i>

178
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,494
<i>Nice-lookin' fella!</i>

179
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:33,460
<i>Doc, don't let us
have any trouble, huh?</i>

180
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:41,076
<i>I told you to get outta town
and stay out!</i>

181
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:43,080
<i>Oh, Doc, I'll cut you in
on the game!</i>

182
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:45,446
<i>I told you to get outta town!</i>

183
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,725
Check me in, will you?

184
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,188
<i>That door's for ladies
and gentlemen!</i>

185
00:22:10,441 --> 00:22:12,602
<i>Go on with your game, gentlemen!</i>

186
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:33,358
<i>Well, you can cash me in!
It's getting late! I'll see you all later!</i>

187
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:41,537
<i>It sure is a hard town
for a fella!!!</i>

188
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:45,372
<i>To!!! have a quiet game
of poker in!</i>

189
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,370
<i>- Howdy!
- Good evening!</i>

190
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:19,069
<i>- I'm...
- Wyatt Earp! I know! I know all about you!!!</i>

191
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:21,611
And your reason
for being here, but...

192
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,273
<i>Heard a lot about you too, Doc!</i>

193
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:29,252
<i>You left your mark around
in Deadwood, Denver and places!</i>

194
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:32,850
<i>In fact, a man could
almost follow your trail!!!</i>

195
00:23:32,924 --> 00:23:35,085
<i>Goin' from graveyard
to graveyard!</i>

196
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,093
<i>There's one here too!</i>

197
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:41,097
<i>The biggest graveyard
west of the Rockies!</i>

198
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:44,100
<i>Marshals and I usually
get along much better when, uh!!!</i>

199
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:46,102
<i>We understand that right away!</i>

200
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:49,272
<i>Get your meaning, Doc!</i>

201
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,900
<i>Good! Have a drink?</i>

202
00:23:53,311 --> 00:23:55,245
<i>Thanks, believe I will!</i>

203
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:59,079
<i>Mac, a glass of champagne
for the marshal!</i>

204
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,118
<i>Make it whiskey!</i>

205
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:03,119
<i>You're my guest, Marshal!</i>

206
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:10,327
<i>Champagne!</i>

207
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:13,563
<i>Champagne it is, Mac!</i>

208
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:31,073
Plan on staying here long?

209
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:33,447
<i>A while!</i>

210
00:24:33,518 --> 00:24:36,248
Till you catch the rustlers
that killed your brother?

211
00:24:37,255 --> 00:24:39,189
<i>It's the general idea!</i>

212
00:24:39,257 --> 00:24:43,023
What's the specific idea?

213
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:45,119
<i>I don't follow you quite!</i>

214
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:49,292
<i>You haven't taken into your head
to deliver us from all evil!</i>

215
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:54,031
<i>I hadn't thought of it quite like that,
but ain't a bad idea!</i>

216
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:56,539
<i>It's what I'm gettin' paid for!</i>

217
00:24:56,607 --> 00:24:59,474
<i>Let's get down to cases, Marshal!</i>

218
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:01,876
<i>I, for instance!</i>

219
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:05,939
How would you handle me
if I took a notion to break the law?

220
00:25:06,017 --> 00:25:08,144
<i>You already have!</i>

221
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:10,153
<i>For example!</i>

222
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:12,348
<i>Runnin' that tinhorn
outta town!!!</i>

223
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:14,357
<i>That's none of your business!</i>

224
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:26,295
<i>I see we're in
opposite camps, Marshal!</i>

225
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:28,339
<i>- Draw!</i>

226
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:33,476
<i>Can't!</i>

227
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:36,012
<i>We can take care of that
easily enough!</i>

228
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,014
<i>Mac!</i>

229
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:42,919
<i>My brother Morg's gun!</i>

230
00:25:59,637 --> 00:26:01,605
<i>The big one, that's Morg!</i>

231
00:26:01,672 --> 00:26:04,641
<i>The other one, that good-lookin' fella,
that's my brother Virg!</i>

232
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:06,643
<i>This is Doc Holliday, fellas!</i>

233
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:09,179
<i>- Hiya, Doc!
- Howdy!</i>

234
00:26:09,247 --> 00:26:11,181
<i>Howdy!</i>

235
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:16,886
<i>Have a drink!</i>

236
00:26:23,995 --> 00:26:25,929
<i>Don't mind if I do, Doc!</i>

237
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:32,402
<i>- Join us, Mac!
- Yes, sir! Thanks!</i>

238
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:39,476
<i>Gentlemen!</i>

239
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:44,574
<i>- Your health!
- Your health, Doc!</i>

240
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,136
<i>Thank you!</i>

241
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:19,581
<i>Come, come, my good man! Let me have service,
or I'll take my patronage elsewhere!</i>

242
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,754
<i>Your foot, sir!</i>

243
00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:31,828
<i>Champagne!</i>

244
00:27:37,168 --> 00:27:39,932
<i>That's the actor
in tonight's show!</i>

245
00:27:40,004 --> 00:27:41,938
<i>Shakespeare in Tombstone!</i>

246
00:27:42,006 --> 00:27:44,406
<i>Coming right up, Mr. Shakespeare.</i>

247
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:47,569
<i>It's been a long time
since I've heard Shakespeare!</i>

248
00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:51,711
How would you like to
join me tonight, Marshal?

249
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:54,250
<i>Yeah, fine!</i>

250
00:27:54,318 --> 00:27:57,151
<i>Better see he gets to the theater,
or there won't be any show!</i>

251
00:27:57,221 --> 00:28:00,247
Mac, cash in for me, will you?

252
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,485
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

253
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:06,663
<i>Dad, take Mr! Thorndyke
over to the Bird Cage!</i>

254
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:09,825
Bird cage? You're incarcerating me
in a bird cage, sir?

255
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,369
<i>- That's the name of the theater!
- The theater?</i>

256
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:14,495
<i>The show! Good heavens!</i>

257
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,563
<i>The show must go on!</i>

258
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,802
<i>Lead on!</i>

259
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:27,607
Drinks on the house!

260
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:54,708
<i>¡Tortillas! ¡Enchiladas!
¡Con cerveza! ¡Tortillas!</i>

261
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:58,215
<i>¡Enchiladas! ¡Con cerveza!</i>

262
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,345
<i>May I present
my friend Wyatt Earp!</i>

263
00:29:04,422 --> 00:29:07,414
<i>- Him? A friend?
- "He," not him!</i>

264
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:10,085
<i>Well, he or him,
he ain't no friend of mine!</i>

265
00:29:10,161 --> 00:29:14,063
<i>What she's trying to say, Doc,
is, uh, we've met before!</i>

266
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:17,965
<i>Sort of found ourselves together
in a eight-handed poker game!</i>

267
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:29,843
<i>Ladies!!!</i>

268
00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:37,682
<i>- And gentlemen!</i>

269
00:29:37,755 --> 00:29:42,055
<i>Owing to circumstances
that I had nothing to do with!!!</i>

270
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:46,256
<i>The show, The Convict's Oath,
will not appear tonight!</i>

271
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:52,091
<i>But, as if I didn't already
have enough trouble!!!</i>

272
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:57,106
<i>That eminent actor,
that sterling tragedian!!!</i>

273
00:29:57,174 --> 00:29:59,108
<i>Mr! Granville...</i>

274
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:02,009
Thorndyke!

275
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:04,172
<i>Has completely disappeared!</i>

276
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:24,832
<i>Wait a minute!
What are you acting so mad about?</i>

277
00:30:24,902 --> 00:30:27,735
<i>Why, this is the fourth time
this year this has happened, Marshal!</i>

278
00:30:27,805 --> 00:30:30,740
<i>Bird imitators!
Bird imitators, that's all we get!</i>

279
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:33,834
<i>- Gentlemen, I can explain!
- What are you fixin' to do about it?</i>

280
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:36,971
<i>Marshal, be reasonable! All we want
to do is to ride him around town!!!</i>

281
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:39,846
<i>- A couple of times on the rail!</i>

282
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:43,078
<i>Well, that sounds
reasonable enough to me!</i>

283
00:30:43,154 --> 00:30:45,679
<i>Oh, no, not that!
Oh, no!</i>

284
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:47,724
<i>Wait a minute, boys!
Wait a minute!</i>

285
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:50,784
<i>I got a better idea!
Just give me 15 minutes!!!</i>

286
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:53,352
<i>And I think I can find this Mr! ...</i>

287
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:55,763
<i>- Thorndyke!
- I'll bring him back here!</i>

288
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,427
<i>Now sit down! Take your seats again!
Have another beer!</i>

289
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:03,801
<i>Look, Yorick! Can't you give us
nothing but them poems?</i>

290
00:31:03,874 --> 00:31:06,308
<i>I have a very large
repertoire, sir!</i>

291
00:31:06,377 --> 00:31:10,279
<i>Great! All right, Yorick!
Go ahead! Shoot!</i>

292
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:28,122
<i>Minstrel, pray help me!</i>

293
00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:34,570
<i>Wait! I wanna hear this!</i>

294
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:37,865
<i>Thank you!</i>

295
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:46,678
To be, or not to be:

296
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:48,685
<i>That is the question!</i>

297
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:50,687
<i>Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind!!!</i>

298
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:54,714
<i>To suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune!!!</i>

299
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:57,818
<i>Or to take arms
against a sea of troubles!!!</i>

300
00:31:57,895 --> 00:32:00,826
And by opposing end them?

301
00:32:01,827 --> 00:32:07,094
<i>To die, to sleep, no more.</i>

302
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:11,398
<i>And by a sleep,
to say we end the heartaches...</i>

303
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,304
<i>and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to!!!</i>

304
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:19,572
<i>'Tis a consummation
devoutly to be wish'd!</i>

305
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:23,308
<i>To die, to sleep!</i>

306
00:32:23,382 --> 00:32:27,751
<i>To sleep, perchance to dream.</i>

307
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,687
<i>Ay, there's the rub!!!</i>

308
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:34,453
<i>For in that sleep of death,
what dreams may come!!!</i>

309
00:32:34,527 --> 00:32:37,257
When we have shuffled off
this mortal coil...

310
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:40,162
<i>That's enough!
That's enough!</i>

311
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:45,362
<i>You don't know nothin'
but them poems!</i>

312
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:49,168
<i>You can't sing!
Maybe you can dance!</i>

313
00:32:49,241 --> 00:32:51,766
<i>Leave him alone.</i>

314
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:55,079
<i>Please go on, Mr! Thorndyke!</i>

315
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:57,843
<i>- Thank you, gentleman!</i>

316
00:32:57,917 --> 00:33:00,112
<i>Must give us pause!</i>

317
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,916
<i>There's the respect!!!</i>

318
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:06,924
<i>That makes calamity
of so long life!</i>

319
00:33:06,992 --> 00:33:10,428
<i>For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time!!!</i>

320
00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:14,865
<i>The law's delay,
the insolence of office!!!</i>

321
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:19,462
<i>And the spurns that patient
merit of the unworthy take!!!</i>

322
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:23,998
<i>When he himself
might his quietus make!!!</i>

323
00:33:24,076 --> 00:33:27,273
With a bare bodkin?

324
00:33:27,346 --> 00:33:31,146
<i>Who would fardels bear,
to grunt and sweat!!!</i>

325
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,675
Under a weary life...

326
00:33:34,753 --> 00:33:36,687
<i>life!</i>

327
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,854
<i>Please, help me, sir!</i>

328
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:47,365
<i>But that the dread
of something after death!</i>

329
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:50,425
Would you carry on?

330
00:33:50,502 --> 00:33:55,405
<i>I'm afraid!!! it's been so long!</i>

331
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:02,542
<i>The undiscover'd country!!!</i>

332
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:07,018
<i>From whose bourn
no traveler returns!!!</i>

333
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:13,025
<i>Puzzles the will and makes us
rather bear those ills we have...</i>

334
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:17,923
<i>than fly to others
that we know not of!</i>

335
00:34:17,997 --> 00:34:21,296
<i>Thus, conscience does make
cowards of us all!</i>

336
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:54,559
<i>They're waiting for you
at the theater, Mr! Thorndyke!</i>

337
00:34:56,435 --> 00:34:58,369
<i>Thank you, sir!</i>

338
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:01,270
<i>Shakespeare was not
meant for taverns!!!</i>

339
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,332
<i>Nor for tavern louts!</i>

340
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,344
Yorick stays here!

341
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:13,979
<i>¿Qué pasa? ¿Qué pasa?
¡Parece que hay bandidos!</i>

342
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,559
<i>My apologies, Marshal!</i>

343
00:35:21,627 --> 00:35:24,027
<i>Ike and Phin have had
a little whiskey!</i>

344
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:26,496
<i>Sure! I figured they was just
having themselves some fun!</i>

345
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:29,056
<i>Come on, Mr! Thorndyke!
I'll take you to the theater!</i>

346
00:35:35,507 --> 00:35:38,772
- Stop!
- Stop, Pa! Stop!

347
00:35:38,844 --> 00:35:41,438
Stop!

348
00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:43,913
<i>When you pull a gun, kill a man!</i>

349
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:46,110
<i>Yes, Pa!</i>

350
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:12,607
Whoa! Whoa!

351
00:36:12,678 --> 00:36:15,875
<i>Tombstone, folks! All out for breakfast!
All out for breakfast!</i>

352
00:36:19,018 --> 00:36:24,320
<i>- Come on, giddap there! Come on, giddap!</i>

353
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,858
<i>- How's it going, Earp?
- Fine!</i>

354
00:36:28,427 --> 00:36:31,328
<i>How are things in Deadwood,
Mr! Gambler?</i>

355
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,594
<i>All right, I guess!</i>

356
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:36,930
<i>- Brother with you?
- No!</i>

357
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:44,741
<i>Get yourself some flapjacks!
Stage is leaving in 30 minutes!</i>

358
00:36:46,045 --> 00:36:47,979
<i>See you're on it!</i>

359
00:36:54,787 --> 00:36:56,721
<i>Thank you!</i>

360
00:36:58,724 --> 00:37:00,658
<i>I'll prepare a room for you.</i>

361
00:37:00,726 --> 00:37:02,819
<i>Thank you!</i>

362
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:27,018
Can I help you, ma'am?

363
00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:30,715
Oh, Dad's usually here
to take care of the...

364
00:37:34,493 --> 00:37:36,427
Is that your duffel up there?

365
00:37:36,495 --> 00:37:38,429
<i>Yes!</i>

366
00:37:45,104 --> 00:37:48,403
<i>How about just giving me a stack of
buckwheat cakes and plenty of molasses!!!</i>

367
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,739
<i>And a steak, blood rare,
couple hunks of bacon if you got some!!!</i>

368
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,906
<i>And a big pot of!!! coffee!</i>

369
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:02,785
<i>I'm looking for Dr!John Holliday!</i>

370
00:38:02,855 --> 00:38:04,880
You mean Doc Holliday?

371
00:38:06,191 --> 00:38:08,659
<i>- Well, I imagine so!
- Oh, Doc Holliday!</i>

372
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:12,458
<i>Why, he rode out of town about 3:00
this morning, heading south!</i>

373
00:38:12,531 --> 00:38:14,465
<i>I don't know
when he'll be back, ma'am!</i>

374
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:17,798
<i>He'll most likely
be back suppertime.</i>

375
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,362
<i>Maybe you'd like to have some breakfast,
freshen up a bit!</i>

376
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,738
<i>Oh, I would like some coffee!</i>

377
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:28,075
<i>- Have you got a room for Miss...
- Carter! Clementine Carter!</i>

378
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:37,021
<i>Thank you!</i>

379
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,860
<i>See ifJosephina can't get
a couple of buckets of hot water!!!</i>

380
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,694
<i>- So she can take a bath!
- Yes, Marshal!</i>

381
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,011
<i>It's Doc's room!
You're right across the hall from him!</i>

382
00:39:00,078 --> 00:39:02,012
John's room?

383
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:21,124
<i>Oh, that's John with a mustache!</i>

384
00:39:34,046 --> 00:39:35,980
He is a good surgeon, isn't he?

385
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,017
<i>I wouldn't know, ma'am!</i>

386
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:52,822
<i>That's a nice picture of you!</i>

387
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:11,714
<i>All right, folks, all together now!</i>

388
00:40:11,783 --> 00:40:15,947
Hip, hip, hooray!

389
00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:19,354
<i>The town ofTombstone is most grateful
to you for a wonderful performance!</i>

390
00:40:19,424 --> 00:40:21,483
<i>Mr! Mayor, I am most touched
by your tribute!</i>

391
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,687
<i>- Have one of my cards!
- Thank you very much, sir!</i>

392
00:40:23,762 --> 00:40:26,230
<i>Sorry you're leaving, Mr! Thorndyke!
Here's your bill!</i>

393
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,232
<i>The bill!</i>

394
00:40:32,037 --> 00:40:33,971
<i>Thank you!</i>

395
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,179
<i>Great souls by instinct
to each other turn!!!</i>

396
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,947
<i>Demand allegiance
and in friendship burn!</i>

397
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,423
<i>Good night, sweet prince!</i>

398
00:40:57,896 --> 00:41:01,354
<i>- Good-bye, Mr! Actor!
- Parting is such sweet sorrow!</i>

399
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:03,924
<i>- Hyah!</i>

400
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:54,852
Would you like
a glass of beer, ma'am?

401
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,946
<i>No, thank you!
I'm looking for Dr!John Holliday!</i>

402
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:01,321
<i>- Who?
- Dr!John Holliday!</i>

403
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:06,695
<i>Oh. Well, uh, I'll see if I can
find him for you, ma'am.</i>

404
00:42:06,765 --> 00:42:08,699
<i>Thank you!</i>

405
00:42:15,474 --> 00:42:18,136
<i>- Go right in, ma'am!
- Thank you!</i>

406
00:42:20,312 --> 00:42:23,008
<i>- Gentlemen!
- Buenas noches, señorita.</i>

407
00:42:26,651 --> 00:42:28,585
<i>Hello, John!</i>

408
00:42:28,653 --> 00:42:31,144
<i>Clem!</i>

409
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:37,660
<i>I'd, uh, like you to meet a friend of mine,
Wyatt Earp! Miss Clementine Carter!</i>

410
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:39,663
<i>We've met, John!
Good evening, Mr! Earp!</i>

411
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:42,666
<i>Howdy, ma'am!
I'll see you both later!</i>

412
00:42:46,104 --> 00:42:49,540
<i>- Let's eat!
- What are you up to?</i>

413
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:59,613
<i>It's wonderful
to see you again, John!</i>

414
00:42:59,684 --> 00:43:02,312
You are pleased that I came?

415
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:09,751
<i>- My coming has made you unhappy!
- It was ill-advised!</i>

416
00:43:09,828 --> 00:43:12,922
Any less ill-advised
than the way you left Boston?

417
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,097
How did you know I was here?

418
00:43:17,169 --> 00:43:21,299
<i>I didn't!
Finding you hasn't been easy!</i>

419
00:43:21,373 --> 00:43:25,935
<i>From cow camp to cow camp,
from one mining town to another!</i>

420
00:43:26,011 --> 00:43:28,536
<i>Well, I should think
that if nothing more!!!</i>

421
00:43:28,613 --> 00:43:30,945
<i>You'd be at least flattered
to have a girl chase you!</i>

422
00:43:31,016 --> 00:43:33,610
<i>Look, Clem!
You've got to get out of here!</i>

423
00:43:33,685 --> 00:43:37,644
<i>- But I'm not!
- This is no place for your kind of person!</i>

424
00:43:37,722 --> 00:43:40,122
What kind of a person am I, John?

425
00:43:40,192 --> 00:43:43,184
<i>Please, go back home, Clem!</i>

426
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:47,254
<i>Back where you belong!
Forget the...</i>

427
00:44:06,485 --> 00:44:08,851
Does this happen
to John frequently?

428
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,912
<i>Oui, mademoiselle.
Each time it's worse!</i>

429
00:44:18,029 --> 00:44:20,497
<i>You're ill, John!</i>

430
00:44:20,565 --> 00:44:22,533
<i>So that's the reason you left!</i>

431
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:24,535
<i>That has nothing to do with it!</i>

432
00:44:24,603 --> 00:44:28,004
<i>Foolish, foolish John,
as if that would have mattered!</i>

433
00:44:28,073 --> 00:44:31,565
<i>I tell you, Clem, the condition
of my health has nothing to do with it!</i>

434
00:44:31,643 --> 00:44:35,010
<i>I don't believe you, John!</i>

435
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,708
<i>Then I'll give you the truth!</i>

436
00:44:37,782 --> 00:44:40,649
<i>The man you once knew
is no more!</i>

437
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:43,347
<i>There's not a vestige
of him left! Nothing!</i>

438
00:44:43,421 --> 00:44:45,355
<i>Come! I'll take you
back to the hotel!</i>

439
00:44:45,423 --> 00:44:49,223
<i>Please, John, you can't
send me away like this!</i>

440
00:44:49,294 --> 00:44:53,094
<i>You can't run away from me any more
than you can run away from yourself!</i>

441
00:44:54,799 --> 00:44:57,734
<i>Now I know why you don't care
whether you live or die!!!</i>

442
00:44:57,802 --> 00:45:00,703
<i>Why you tried
to get yourself killed!</i>

443
00:45:00,772 --> 00:45:03,240
<i>I've heard all about you,
John, and you're wrong!</i>

444
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:05,640
<i>So wrong!</i>

445
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,611
<i>You have no right
to destroy yourself!</i>

446
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,410
<i>You have a world of friends
back home who love you, John!</i>

447
00:45:11,483 --> 00:45:13,417
<i>And I love you!</i>

448
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:20,384
<i>There's a stage leaving
in the morning for the East!</i>

449
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:22,756
<i>Take it!</i>

450
00:45:22,827 --> 00:45:24,988
<i>If you don't, I'm moving on!</i>

451
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:31,401
<i>Very well, John! I'll go!</i>

452
00:46:28,793 --> 00:46:31,728
<i>Dr! John Holliday!</i>

453
00:46:40,071 --> 00:46:42,699
<i>From where I'm standing, Earp,
that tin badge you're wearing!!!</i>

454
00:46:42,774 --> 00:46:46,574
<i>Doesn't give you the right
to stick your nose in my personal affairs!</i>

455
00:46:46,645 --> 00:46:50,775
- What's eating you, Doc?
- Why didn't you tell me Miss Carter's here?

456
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:54,451
<i>She told you why!
She wanted to surprise you!</i>

457
00:47:07,332 --> 00:47:09,300
<i>Gimme a clean glass, Mac!</i>

458
00:47:09,367 --> 00:47:11,528
You're not gonna start
drinking whiskey again, are you?

459
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:13,537
Gimme a glass, Mac!

460
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:16,773
<i>I'll pour it!</i>

461
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:21,979
<i>Doc!</i>

462
00:47:24,382 --> 00:47:26,475
<i>That stuff will kill ya!</i>

463
00:48:08,356 --> 00:48:10,881
Why don't you go away?

464
00:48:10,959 --> 00:48:15,362
<i>Squall your stupid little songs
and leave me alone!</i>

465
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,959
<i>I'm gonna see
if I can get Doc to bed!</i>

466
00:48:54,035 --> 00:48:55,969
Oh, why don't you
finish your supper?

467
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:03,404
<i>- Have a drink!
- No, thanks, Doc!</i>

468
00:49:03,478 --> 00:49:05,446
<i>I said have a drink!</i>

469
00:49:05,513 --> 00:49:08,346
<i>No, thanks!
I just finished supper!</i>

470
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:10,407
<i>Look, Doc!</i>

471
00:49:10,485 --> 00:49:14,785
<i>I ain't tried to poke my nose
into your personal affairs!</i>

472
00:49:14,856 --> 00:49:18,019
<i>But from where I stand!!!</i>

473
00:49:18,092 --> 00:49:22,085
<i>A man would have to go a long ways
before he finds a finer girl than Miss Carter!</i>

474
00:49:23,097 --> 00:49:26,533
<i>Or a prettier one,
for that matter!</i>

475
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:29,536
Ain't a man west of the Mississippi
who wouldn't give his shirt to...

476
00:49:29,604 --> 00:49:33,973
<i>Marshal, you've said enough!</i>

477
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:35,976
<i>Just as you say, Doc!</i>

478
00:49:42,116 --> 00:49:44,744
<i>And this isn't
any of your business either!</i>

479
00:49:53,094 --> 00:49:55,426
<i>Keep that up,
and you'll be outta business!</i>

480
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:03,597
<i>You've just given me
a brilliant idea, Marshal!</i>

481
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:06,105
<i>It's time I tempted fate!</i>

482
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:10,673
<i>- Let's see!</i>

483
00:50:10,745 --> 00:50:13,475
Who's in here
I don't particularly like?

484
00:50:15,116 --> 00:50:18,415
<i>That's a sucker game, Doc!</i>

485
00:50:18,486 --> 00:50:22,422
<i>There's probably 50 fellas around town
just waiting to see you get liquored up!!!</i>

486
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:25,152
<i>So they can fill you
full of holes!</i>

487
00:50:25,226 --> 00:50:28,059
<i>Build themselves up
a great reputation...</i>

488
00:50:28,129 --> 00:50:31,826
<i>the man that killed Doc Holliday!</i>

489
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,444
<i>Mac!</i>

490
00:50:44,512 --> 00:50:46,946
<i>Gimme a hand!
Let's get him to bed!</i>

491
00:51:19,213 --> 00:51:22,148
<i>- Don't think that's kinda...
- No, sir! No, sir!</i>

492
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:41,601
<i>New chair gets in next week
from Kansas City, Kansas!</i>

493
00:51:41,669 --> 00:51:44,399
<i>Fine! Fine!</i>

494
00:51:46,908 --> 00:51:49,638
<i>- Sweet-smelling stuff, Mr! Earp!</i>

495
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:52,305
<i>Sweet-smelling stuff!</i>

496
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,334
Have a good breakfast?

497
00:52:47,402 --> 00:52:50,803
<i>Yeah, stowed away
a whole skillet full of ham and eggs!</i>

498
00:52:50,872 --> 00:52:52,806
<i>Feel good!</i>

499
00:52:54,675 --> 00:52:58,133
<i>Uh, figured on getting
a buckboard!!!</i>

500
00:52:58,212 --> 00:53:01,375
<i>And maybe goin' up and seeJames!</i>

501
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:03,781
<i>Good idea!</i>

502
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:06,945
<i>Thinkin' I might ride out there
later this afternoon myself!</i>

503
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:24,697
<i>If I wasn't in the territory, I'd swear
we were back home on a Sunday morning!</i>

504
00:53:24,772 --> 00:53:30,369
<i>Yeah, with Ma scrubbing
our necks to go to camp meeting!</i>

505
00:53:30,445 --> 00:53:33,744
<i>By golly, I'll bet that's what it is,
a camp meeting!</i>

506
00:53:33,815 --> 00:53:35,749
<i>Could be!</i>

507
00:53:37,785 --> 00:53:42,279
<i>You know, I swear I can almost smell
the honeysuckle blossoms!</i>

508
00:53:42,356 --> 00:53:45,450
<i>That's me!</i>

509
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:47,687
<i>Barber!</i>

510
00:53:50,198 --> 00:53:51,222
Whoa!

511
00:53:51,299 --> 00:53:53,062
<i>- Good morning!

512
00:53:53,134 --> 00:53:56,035
<i>You gentlemen are coming
to church this morning I hope!</i>

513
00:53:56,103 --> 00:54:00,039
<i>We're having our first social gathering
to raise enough money to finish the church!</i>

514
00:54:00,107 --> 00:54:02,041
<i>See, what'd I tell you!
It's a camp meeting!</i>

<i>Camp meeting! No such
a dad-blasted thing! Regular church!</i>

Oh, is that what

517
00:54:07,715 --> 00:54:10,081
<i>I was wondering what that
fresh-cut lumber was for!</i>

518
00:54:10,151 --> 00:54:12,176
<i>Yes, sir!
Roof will be on next week!</i>

520
00:54:14,822 --> 00:54:17,290
<i>- Be awful nice for the dancin'!

<i>Well, thank you, ma'am, but my brothers

people round here! We just ain't met 'em!</i>

529

<i>Come on, Morg!

<i>- Stop slamming the doors!</i>

537

<i>People bellowing, dropping pitchers
on the floor! I get no rest!</i>

538
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,692
<i>I'm sorry, darling!
You're not mad, are you?</i>

539
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:12,899
<i>Sure not! What right have I got

Why not?

You are going to
the services, aren't you?

583
01:00:18,412 --> 01:00:21,404

<i>Now I don't pretend
to be no preacher!!!</i>

590
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:49,228
<i>But I've read the Good Book
from cover to cover and back again!!!</i>

<i>And I nary found

<i>So we'll commence by havin'
a dad-blasted good dance!</i>

for our new marshal and his lady fair!</i>

596
01:04:12,046 --> 01:04:14,913
<i>Yoo-hee-hoo.</i>

597
01:04:25,793 --> 01:04:27,727
<i>Ya-hoo!</i>

598
01:04:29,963 --> 01:04:32,864
<i>Well, by gollies!</i>

599
01:04:37,971 --> 01:04:41,600
<i>Marshal, I hope you're as good
a dad-blasted carver!!!</i>

600
01:04:41,675 --> 01:04:44,610
<i>As you are
a dad-blasted good dancer!</i>

601
01:04:45,879 --> 01:04:49,406
- Oh, you know...

602
01:04:49,483 --> 01:04:51,417
<i>What's your preference?</i>

603
01:04:51,485 --> 01:04:54,113
<i>It makes no difference,
Marshal. Anything. Anything.</i>

604
01:04:54,188 --> 01:04:56,349
<i>Now you know the church. You know...</i>

605
01:04:57,691 --> 01:05:01,058
<i>Pardon me for intruding
on your dinner party, Marshal!</i>

606
01:05:01,128 --> 01:05:03,323
<i>It's all right, Doc!
Sit down and join us!</i>

607
01:05:03,397 --> 01:05:07,197
<i>Look, Clem, I told you last night to leave
Tombstone and go back East!</i>

608
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:10,236
<i>I also told you if
you didn't leave, I would!</i>

609
01:05:10,304 --> 01:05:12,238
<i>Hey, Doc!</i>

610
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:20,075
<i>Just a minute, Doc!
That's the second time in three days!!!</i>

611
01:05:20,147 --> 01:05:22,707
<i>You've been tryin'
to run somebody out of town!</i>

612
01:05:22,783 --> 01:05:25,616
<i>That's my business!
That's what I'm gettin' paid for!</i>

613
01:05:25,686 --> 01:05:27,779
<i>Miss Carter or any other
decent citizen!!!</i>

614
01:05:27,855 --> 01:05:30,415
<i>Can stay here just
as long as they want to!</i>

615
01:05:30,491 --> 01:05:32,686
<i>We're through talking, Marshal!</i>

616
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,887
<i>My advice to you
is start carrying your gun!</i>

617
01:05:34,962 --> 01:05:37,021
<i>That's good advice!</i>

618
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:56,115
<i>Hyah!</i>

619
01:06:17,504 --> 01:06:19,529
<i>¿Mamacita?</i>

620
01:06:36,623 --> 01:06:39,114
<i>Doc's gone!</i>

621
01:06:40,594 --> 01:06:43,495
<i>He's left town!
He was goin' to Mexico and!!!</i>

622
01:06:43,564 --> 01:06:46,192
<i>Take me with him!</i>

623
01:06:46,266 --> 01:06:48,200
<i>He was gonna marry me!</i>

624
01:06:48,268 --> 01:06:50,702
<i>Well, you're leavin' too!</i>

625
01:07:00,047 --> 01:07:01,981
What's the matter, Miss Carter?

626
01:07:02,049 --> 01:07:04,108
<i>I think it's just a common
case of hysteria, Marshal!</i>

627
01:07:04,184 --> 01:07:06,584
- Oh, it is, is it?
- What are you doin' here?

628
01:07:06,653 --> 01:07:08,712
- None of your business!
- Why don't you behave yourself?

629
01:07:08,789 --> 01:07:12,816
<i>- Go on back where you belong!
- I'm not gettin' out till she leaves town!</i>

630
01:07:12,893 --> 01:07:15,293
Why, do you want me
to take you over my knee and spank you?

631
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:17,455
<i>You take your hands off me!
Leave me alone!</i>

632
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:20,728
What do you know about it anyway?
What do you know about Doc and me?

633
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:22,735
<i>We was going to Mexico
and get married!</i>

634
01:07:22,803 --> 01:07:25,931
<i>Yes, he was gonna marry me,
till this Miss Milkface!!!</i>

635
01:07:26,006 --> 01:07:29,100
Comes pussyfootin' along and...

636
01:07:29,176 --> 01:07:31,303
<i>- Where'd you get that?
- Doc gave it to me!</i>

637
01:07:31,378 --> 01:07:33,642
- Where do you think I got it?
- You ain't lyin'?

638
01:07:33,714 --> 01:07:36,012
Why should I lie about it?
He gives me everything I've got!

639
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:38,551
I got a whole roomful
of stuff down there!

640
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:40,553
<i>Keep your door locked,
Miss Carter.</i>

641
01:07:40,621 --> 01:07:43,886
<i>See that this wildcat stays in her room,
will ya? And tell Virg to stick around!</i>

642
01:07:43,957 --> 01:07:46,221
What's up?

643
01:07:46,293 --> 01:07:48,227
<i>Doc Holliday!</i>

644
01:07:52,332 --> 01:07:54,266
Where's Holliday?

645
01:07:54,334 --> 01:07:56,859
<i>He came in about a half an hour ago,
got his saddlebags!!!</i>

646
01:07:56,937 --> 01:08:00,566
<i>And a sack of gold out of the safe
and left in a hurry!</i>

647
01:08:13,487 --> 01:08:16,012
<i>- Were you lookin' for Doc?
- I am!</i>

648
01:08:16,089 --> 01:08:19,024
<i>Well, he left on the bullion stage
riding shotgun!</i>

649
01:08:19,092 --> 01:08:21,788
<i>- Left town?
- For Tucson!</i>

650
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:26,292
Get my bay mare and have her
up to the jail, will you, Jess?

651
01:08:26,366 --> 01:08:28,300
<i>Sure!</i>

652
01:08:31,672 --> 01:08:35,108
<i>You!
Whiskey for my boys!</i>

653
01:08:37,878 --> 01:08:39,812
Hyah!

654
01:08:41,949 --> 01:08:44,679
Hyah! Hyah!

655
01:08:45,686 --> 01:08:47,677
Hyah!

656
01:08:49,756 --> 01:08:53,317
<i>I think the Wachucha Pass
is your best bet, Wyatt!</i>

657
01:08:53,393 --> 01:08:55,327
<i>Good luck!</i>

658
01:08:57,197 --> 01:08:59,131
<i>Thank you, Jess!</i>

659
01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:19,518
Hyah!

660
01:09:20,587 --> 01:09:23,385
Hyah! Hah!

661
01:09:23,957 --> 01:09:26,357
Hyah!

662
01:09:26,426 --> 01:09:29,725
Hey! Hey! Hyah!

663
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,002
Dinnego, how long ago
did the stage come through here?

664
01:09:44,077 --> 01:09:46,637
<i>- About 15, 20 minutes ago!
- Doc Holliday on it?</i>

665
01:09:46,713 --> 01:09:49,477
<i>Yes, he was, and he was
sure going to town!</i>

666
01:09:49,549 --> 01:09:51,346
<i>I need a couple of fresh horses!
Cut me out two stout ones!</i>

667
01:09:51,418 --> 01:09:53,784
<i>- ¡Ándale, fuera!
- One that'll lead well!</i>

668
01:09:53,854 --> 01:09:55,321
<i>All right, Marshal!</i>

669
01:10:04,564 --> 01:10:06,930
<i>That bay looks good.</i>

670
01:10:09,703 --> 01:10:12,194
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

671
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:19,137
Get on!

672
01:10:19,212 --> 01:10:21,578
Get on!

673
01:10:21,648 --> 01:10:23,582
Get on!

674
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:26,278
Hey, hey! Hey!

675
01:10:31,692 --> 01:10:33,626
Hey!

676
01:10:33,694 --> 01:10:36,754
<i>Get on there! Get on!</i>

677
01:10:38,432 --> 01:10:40,764
<i>Get on!</i>

678
01:10:51,478 --> 01:10:54,606
Get on there! Get on!

679
01:10:55,782 --> 01:10:57,716
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

680
01:10:57,784 --> 01:11:00,947
Get on there! Get on!

681
01:11:01,955 --> 01:11:04,446
Get on!

682
01:11:04,524 --> 01:11:06,458
Get on!

683
01:11:07,694 --> 01:11:09,628
<i>Get on!</i>

684
01:11:15,135 --> 01:11:18,127
<i>Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!</i>

685
01:11:19,139 --> 01:11:23,974
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

686
01:11:24,044 --> 01:11:25,915
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

687
01:11:37,093 --> 01:11:39,391
<i>Hyah! Get on!</i>

688
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,396
Hyah!

689
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:48,165
Hyah! Hyah!

690
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:52,231
<i>- Pull up!
- Whoa!</i>

691
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:57,145
<i>Whoa! Whoa! Easy! Whoa!</i>

692
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:08,319
<i>Whoa!</i>

693
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,159
<i>I told you I'm through
talking, Marshal!</i>

694
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:15,663
<i>You're comin' back
to Tombstone with me, Doc!</i>

695
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:19,224
<i>Sorry, I'm not going back!</i>

696
01:12:19,302 --> 01:12:21,998
<i>Hell, in that case,
I'll be takin' you back!</i>

697
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:25,366
<i>Pull for your gun, Marshal!</i>

698
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:27,602
<i>You call it, Doc!</i>

699
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:47,827
<i>- Who is it?
- The marshal.</i>

700
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:50,195
Why don't you go
chase yourself up an alley!

701
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:52,200
Who do you think you are,
busting into people's rooms at night...

702
01:12:52,268 --> 01:12:54,293
<i>Chihuahua, open this door!</i>

703
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,930
Doc? Is that you, Doc?

704
01:12:57,006 --> 01:12:58,997
<i>I said open this door!</i>

705
01:12:59,075 --> 01:13:01,509
<i>Yeah, Doc!
Yeah!Just a minute!</i>

706
01:13:02,645 --> 01:13:04,909
<i>Chihuahua!</i>

707
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:07,211
<i>- Yes...
- Open this door before I kick it down!</i>

708
01:13:07,283 --> 01:13:09,649
<i>- Yeah, Doc! Let me get something on!</i>

709
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,983
Well, hurry up!

710
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:18,355
<i>Chihuahua!</i>

711
01:13:18,428 --> 01:13:21,625
<i>Come in, Doc!</i>

712
01:13:21,698 --> 01:13:24,997
Chihuahua, why did you
tell the marshal I gave you this jewelry?

713
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,868
<i>W-Well you did, Doc!
You give it to me!</i>

714
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:33,204
<i>I never saw this piece of junk
before in my life! Who gave it to you?</i>

715
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:35,801
<i>Well, you can't remember
everything you give me, Doc!</i>

716
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,812
<i>Sure you did!
Don't you remember?</i>

717
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,678
<i>- When?
- T-Two or three days ago!</i>

718
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,684
<i>I don't know!
What difference does it make?</i>

719
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:47,121
<i>That being the case, Doc, I charge you
with the murder of my brotherJames Earp!</i>

720
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,093
<i>- Doc, he's foolin', ain't he?
- I ain't foolin'!</i>

721
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:55,892
<i>It was stolen from him
the night he was shot in the back!</i>

722
01:14:00,837 --> 01:14:03,271
Now do you still insist
I gave it to you?

723
01:14:03,339 --> 01:14:07,537
<i>- Oh, no! No, of course not!
- Then who did?</i>

724
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,703
<i>I ain't gonna be a squealer, Doc!</i>

725
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,713
<i>Let's go, Doc!</i>

726
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:32,101
<i>When you told me
to go away and!!!</i>

727
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:35,433
<i>Squall my silly little song
somewhere else!</i>

728
01:14:36,739 --> 01:14:40,266
<i>So I came up here
and had a good cry!</i>

729
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:44,570
<i>There was a knock
at the door, and!!!</i>

730
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:49,115
<i>I thought it was you!</i>

731
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,387
I opened the door, and...

732
01:14:58,528 --> 01:15:00,928
<i>- It was Billy Clanton!</i>

733
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:14,942
Hyah, hyah!

734
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,177
Billy Clanton!
Go get him, Virg!

735
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:31,088
- Hah!

736
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:42,703
<i>- What's happened?
- There's been a shootin'! Stay outside, fellas!</i>

737
01:15:45,575 --> 01:15:49,011
<i>Wyatt, she's badly hurt.</i>

738
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,813
<i>Mayor, you'd better send
to Wachucha for an army doctor!</i>

739
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,816
<i>We have to operate immediately!</i>

740
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,876
<i>That'll take
five or six hours, Doc!</i>

741
01:15:57,954 --> 01:15:59,888
You're a doctor, ain't ya?

742
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,890
<i>Doctor!</i>

743
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,426
<i>Morg, go over to the Mansion House!
Get Miss Carter! She's a nurse!</i>

744
01:16:14,504 --> 01:16:16,438
<i>Tell her to stop by Doc's room
and get that doctor's bag!</i>

745
01:16:16,506 --> 01:16:19,737
<i>- All right!
- Mac, you and Buck go clean up the saloon!</i>

746
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:22,505
<i>Put a couple of poker tables together
