1
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:15,474
Juan. Juan.
Juan, two, three. Juan.

2
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:18,894
Yes? Everything OK? You can hear me?
And the picture?

3
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:25,609
No picture? Come on, people,
this is important. Don't screw this up.

4

5
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:58,726
Yeah, people, what can I say?
Things couldn't be better.

6
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:04,148
I got sunshine coming out my ass,
so to say.

7
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,569
Ah, Mr. Stromberg! Hello.
- Hello.

8
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:12,448
Imagine you're Rembrandt,
stuck in the orchestra and thinking:

9
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,075
"I can't play to save my life!"

10
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,452
And then someone says:
"Why don't you try painting?"

11
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:20,039
Bang! Then it's
a whole different ball game.

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,252
Yes, so this is kind of my studio.

13
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,466
God, if I'd known that at the time...

14
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,552
If, if, if. If Grandma were a bus,
she'd have blown her horn.

15
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:36,555
I just didn't know any better.

16
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,896
3 months earlier

17
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:34,905
The politicians meet our country's aim,
here we settle claims.

18
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:40,202
We love working here,
and customers hold us dear.

19
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,874
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to CAPITOL.

20
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,959
1, 2, 3...

21
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:52,047
<i>The office is our temple.</i>
<i>- It's in a word doc on the wall.</i>

22
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:57,386
<i>Our rubber stamps are transcendental.</i>
<i>- They belong to CAPITOL.</i>

23
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:02,725
<i>We're not superman!</i>
<i>- We're not wonderwoman!</i>

24
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:07,771
<i>We do our job, no fuss.</i>
<i>- You can always count on us.</i>

25
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,858
<i>But we're more than just a cubicle.</i>

26
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,235
<i>We're always there for you.</i>

27
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,240
<i>Whether there's a snag, a hitch or glitch.</i>
<i>- We've got the right form in a pinch.</i>

28
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:23,621
<i>Because we are the CAPITOL.</i>

29
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,416
<i>50 years security and coverage for all.</i>

30
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,792
<i>Coverage.</i>
<i>- Coverage.</i>

31
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,421
<i>Because we are the CAPITOL</i>
- The CAPITOL's turning 50.

32
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:36,425
And we're throwing a huge party.
Everyone's coming, from every branch.

33
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,093
And the board of directors.

34
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,762
Together, now! On the beat!

35
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:45,517
We can submit our ideas
for the cholera event. No, wait.

36
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,730
Here it is: "your ideas
for a colorful evening of entertainment".

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,442
See, like this.

38
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,237
I'm doing a musical number.
But hush.

39
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,864
You can really throw yourself into it.

40
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,512
Come up to my office.
- You go over to my office.

41
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:32,231
I said we're not getting involved in this
nonsense. We're not going to the party!

42
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,608
OK, but I'm still going!

43
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:42,408
That's just childish. And dangerous.

44
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:47,037
If I catch fire in here, you're liable for
property damage. Then you'll be sorry.

45
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,248
Oh, right.
- Yeah, right.

46
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:57,673
What the hell's going on?
- Look, the carpet's ruined, all burned!

47
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:05,139
I am the boss of this department!
You're just God's spokesman on Earth.

48
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:08,267
I'm the entire shithouse here,
you're just the little sign on the door!

49
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,895
But you can't just decide
that none of us are going to the party.

50
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,982
Er, erm, yes I can.
Er, erm, no you can't.

51
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:16,692
Yes I can.
- No

52
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,819
Yes I can.
- No

53
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,779
Yes I can.
- For now!

54
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,823
Hm?

55
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,618
I've applied for a job at Head Office.

56
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,874
What's that barf?

57
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,295
Yeah, go on then, laugh.
You'll see who has the last laugh.

58
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,349
Heister... Ow!

59
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,310
Heisterkamp.
- Oh come on, you're so dense...

60
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:56,231
Yes, I called earlier.
I wanted to know if you'd got my text.

61
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,276
The text asking if you'd got the e-mail.

62
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,614
I've been boning up on a lot of things
careerwise. Career coaching.

63
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:09,119
You learn some great tips. Like my watch,
I always have it set 20 minutes fast.

64
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:14,666
So I'm practically living in the future.
I'm basically tricking my own brain.

65
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,046
Because it's thinking "Oh it's late,
better get a move on." Me, I mean.

66
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,506
You know? See?

67
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,842
I've spent long enough being small fry.

68
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:27,596
Now it's time for slightly bigger fry,
a fry that's about this big.

69
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,225
And I want fries with that, and
no one's gonna take that from me.

70
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,684
Oh, I've got to go.

71
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:42,236
Actually, I don't.
It's actually only half past. Right.

72
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,449
Got a bit more time.

73
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,868
So, ready and shoot.

74
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:55,999
Ah, hello. My name is Bernd Stromberg.

75
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:59,002
Here...
- Good morning, Mr. Stromberg!

76
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,129
Good morning.

77
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,006
In my claims department,
I make sure that...

78
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,009
having fun in the workplace
doesn't get neglected.

79
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,388
The people factor has always been
very important for me personally.

80
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:15,727
My aim in my department is to ensure that
work and people go hand in hand with...

81
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,690
Hey... What did I say?

82
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,818
You are 'work' and he's 'people'.

83
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,572
But it doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does!

84
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:30,284
If he's 'work', everyone'll say it's
"xenophobic", blah blah...

85
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,536
Hey, wait...
- Don't start bitching, Gandhi.

86
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,789
And don't half-heartedly
prance through the take. Have fun.

87
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:42,212
Everyone here in the joint is having fun.
I mean, that's what it's all about!

88
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,007
That goes for you too.
- I've got confetti in my eye.

89
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,511
Oh God, it's worlds colliding here,
isn't it. Fun and Mr. Lehnhoff.

90
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,222
I don't get
why we're not going to the party.

91
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:56,018
Because you're as bright as a tunnel.
Right, let's do this crap again.

92
00:07:56,477 --> 00:08:02,941
Hey! That means you too.
Or should we pay you like back in Bombay?

93
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:09,656
Right!

94
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,660
Company parties are like the Last Supper.

95
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:16,663
Never enough broads, crappy food,
and they always end in trouble.

96
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,875
Yeah, ha ha. See, he's laughing.

97
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,794
"Colorful evening", come on, I mean!

98
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,130
When you've been with a firm...

99
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,298
Stand still over there!

100
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,466
...for as long as I have...

101
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,092
You're 'people'. This time.

102
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,262
...you've got more skeletons in the closet
than a crematorium.

103
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,473
And the higher up the ladder you go,

104
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:38,227
the more bodies you've trampled
on along the way.

105
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,603
You're having fun!

106
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,315
And at this kind of party, they're all
there again, lined up in front of you,

107
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,860
all the zombies
you wasted during your career.

108
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:54,743
So no, my department is sending
this little film and cut music, curtain.

109
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:02,543
But why not?
I just don't get it.

110
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,963
Don't know. It'd be great
to finally get everyone together...

111
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:10,217
Wow, another chick for me.
Look, it never stops.

112
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:13,637
On the Internet, I have to swat the girls
away like wasps on a plum cake.

113
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,139
They're attacking me from all directions.

114
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,685
Okay, I've got to be going.
- Yes, sure.

115
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,104
Although from all directions
isn't strictly true.

116
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,107
Most of them are from Eastern Europe.

117
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,111
Here, Svetlana is her name,
the little sweetheart.

118
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,490
Whoah, there's more.

119
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,035
She hasn't exactly got
the waistline of a wasp.

120
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:41,331
OK, Bernd, women absolutely love you,
we get the message.

121
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:45,669
Yeah, if you lost a bit of the bulk,
I'd drop the old Svetlanas immediately.

122
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,379
Boom. Oh!

123
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,967
Shit.
- Oh come on, it's not that bad.

124
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,844
That's really great.

125
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:58,432
Yes, he's still trying his darndest.

126
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:04,271
But I've had it with men for a while.

127
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:11,528
I mean, men are just kind of like
Facebook, aren't they?

128
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:16,617
Everyone says you should do it,
be on it, everyone's doing it.

129
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,330
But what do you really get out of it?

130
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:28,253
In the end,
you're just sitting there alone.

131
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,344
His Mom breastfed him
through a thick sweater.

132
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,055
Head Office have already
asked for his file.

133
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,890
It doesn't look so bad for him.

134
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,268
That's why he wants to go to the party.
He can impress the bosses in person.

135
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,647
What? He's going and we're not?
- Nobody is going to the party!

136
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,649
We can discuss that one to one.

137
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,652
That's shit if he goes and we don't.
- What did I just say?

138
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,489
Nobody is going to the party.
- Listen, I am coming to the party!

139
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,908
God, that weekend
my ex is getting married.

140
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,119
I'll dump a full load into his suitcase,
I'll tell you...

141
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:06,333
Don't bother, you've got the short end of
the stick with Andreas. - Who? What?

142
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,085
Hm?
- Hm?

143
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,632
Oh sorry, I was just thinking
about myself for a minute.

144
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:17,177
I'm going to go on a binge that weekend.
- Oh yeah, good idea!

145
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,845
I'd like to do that again.

146
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:24,101
Yeah, fun's over when you're a Dad, right?
- No, it's just a different kind of fun.

147
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,104
Ditch the kids and get
as much X-rated action as possible.

148
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,231
Aren't you a bit too old
to be going through puberty?

149
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,025
Better than acting like 50
in your mid 30s.

150
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:37,280
Yeah, but having a kid is a lot of fun,
you know, more than I thought it would be.

151
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,824
When they're playing pirates...

152
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:42,202
We've had Marvin for four months now.
- Aww, how sweet.

153
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,664
Officially it's only a trial period
to see if it works out.

154
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:50,961
But it does work out in most cases,
and we're practically a real family now.

155
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,756
We may still have to hand him back though.

156
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,343
Here. Marvin is a really special child.

157
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,472
He comes from, you know,
a socially disadvantaged family.

158
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,641
Losers.

159
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,853
Hello! The father's in jail.
- Pending trial.

160
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,649
For being just 10, Marvin's
been through a lot of crap,

161
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,194
and as foster parents all we can do is
try and show him...

162
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,239
that there are some nice things
in life as well.

163
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:23,118
Yeah, although it isn't really working
because Marvin is, well, a bit strange.

164
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,665
Mom? What's up?

165
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:32,878
Yeah, when we were playing pirates,
he sliced my face with his plastic sword.

166
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,130
Marvin, he's a real...

167
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,802
Yeah, but she didn't want to wait
a single second more to get a child,

168
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,931
so now she's got a little Marvin.

169
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,105
Listen, erm...

170
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,943
Compared to this dump
the Acropolis is a new building.

171
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,529
Why don't you just completely remodel it?

172
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,949
It's not worth it.
- Why not?

173
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,786
It's going to be made into a 'launch'.
- A what?

174
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,747
A 'launch'.
- Okay.

175
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:21,843
So what's that supposed to be, a 'launch'?
- Like it is now, but with sofas.

176
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,515
Oh, you mean a lounge.
- Yeah, a launch.

177
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:30,268
But why do we need a 'launch' here?

178
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,355
It's for the new tenant.

179
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,525
Wait, that's just gobbledy Greek to me.
A new tenant?

180
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:41,363
The one that's moving in here.
- Moving in? And what about CAPITOL?

181
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,615
Closing down.
- OK, you're full of it.

182
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,158
I'm not.
- You are.

183
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,160
I'm not.
- You are.

184
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,996
I'd know about that if it were true.

185
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,876
Hm? Oh?

186
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,840
Lounge for the first of next month.
Premises to be cleared by the 31st.

187
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,802
Yadda, yadda!

188
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,514
See ya.

189
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:17,440
Yeah, so CAPITOL is closing down. And
you find out from the facility manager.

190
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,447
But that's how it is.
A company is like your wife.

191
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:28,285
She fucks you right
when you least expect it.

192
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:34,249
Although, who really knows
if he's right, the facilty manager.

193
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:41,006
Maybe he doesn't really know.
No?

194
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,204
Hey, Mr. Pötsch.
- Morning, Mr. Stromberg.

195
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:18,543
I'm running a bit late.
- Yes. Not been home, huh?

196
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,546
You old leg spreader.

197
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,715
Yeah, yeah, well...

198
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,510
I say, have you heard anything lately?
- Heard something?

199
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,220
Yes, on the grapevine.

200
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,682
You, know she's banging so-and-so,
Hofmann's ill,

201
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,352
they're closing us down, stuff like that?

202
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,938
Where did you heard that?
- Have you heard about it?

203
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,482
I haven't heard a thing.
- No, me neither.

204
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,152
Been delivering packages?

205
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:49,115
Yeah, I do the early shift, instead of
jogging at dawn, and you get paid.

206
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,618
Yeah?
- Morning.

207
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:56,539
Oh! Shit!
- Come here.

208
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,917
Shit!

209
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,127
I mean, look at this.

210
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,756
I'm almost 50, and I'm out on the street
changing out of one fucking pants...

211
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,216
from one fucking company,

212
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,135
putting on the fucking pants
for another fucking company,

213
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,347
all because I'm scared shitless
that one of the companies is folding,

214
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,517
and I'll be out on the street.
- Where did you hear that?

215
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,646
I've heard a few things. - Yeah, that's
what I heard. From the facility manager?

216
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:24,192
Has he heard something?
Anyway, if I were you I'd make sure...

217
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,112
that I got moved up to
Head Office as fast as possible.

218
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:33,368
Because, I mean, I'd do so myself,
but Klinkhammer, he's got it in for me.

219
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,453
Klink?
- Hammer.

220
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,498
The new Head of HR, don't you know him?
- Nope.

221
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:42,919
Well, you're lucky then. I'd use that
to your advantage, if I were you.

222
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:47,757
After everything I've heard,
this place won't be around much longer.

223
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,427
Yeah, that's what I heard.

224
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:57,183
Well, anyway.
- Yes, bye.

225
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:03,356
Shoes, where are the fucking shoes?
Can't find them. Just go without shoes.

226
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:15,577
Yes, for me work is more like home
than my actual home.

227
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,913
I mean, you spend most of your life
at work, not at home.

228
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:22,542
And not with your wife,
not with friends. No. Here.

229
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,881
"25 years of service to CAPITOL".

230
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:34,596
See, they all signed it.
Well, both of them.

231
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,391
Look, and right at the top, they wrote:
"Strohmberg".

232
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:42,187
I got rid of the "h" myself, but...

233
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,566
Yeah, so, you know, if it all just
suddenly disappears, by jove...

234
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:54,657
I mean, whatever else goes on,
the office is...

235
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,243
the structural foundation
for a man's life.

236
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,167
Er...

237
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:21,976
Er, so kids, just quickly, please!

238
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:26,940
Erm, now there's no way round this.

239
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:34,364
I have to make, er, an announcement.

240
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:42,080
We are all going to the CAPITOL party
after all.

241
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,380
Yes! And you're all coming!

242
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,424
That's something, isn't it?

243
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:54,968
Yeah, but I thought...

244
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,345
Well, your coconut isn't
designed for thinking.

245
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:01,850
But you said nobody was going.
- Yes, that was Ernie.

246
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,977
No, that was you.

247
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:10,191
Well, is that your way
of showing you're pleased? - Nope.

248
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,988
So, what then?

249
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:23,163
Come on crazy party people,
make some noise! Whoop whoop.

250
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:29,002
When all seems lost,
that's when it really begins.

251
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,045
Yeah, why not?

252
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,464
Come on, all together.

253
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,967
That's always been my motto.
- Whoop whoop.

254
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,387
Whoop whoop. Whoop whoop.
- Yes. That'll do.

255
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,017
In the office you have to decide what type
of person you are. Are you more...

256
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,856
the nail getting hit on the head or
are you the hammer doing the hitting.

257
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:54,444
And I'm definitely a hammer.

258
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,612
I am!

259
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,947
Great, isn't it?
- Yeah, sure.

260
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,365
You excited?

261
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:05,538
Just register with Head Office,
and I'll take care of the bus.

262
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,750
But we can't just leave Marvin
on his own the whole weekend.

263
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,960
Bring little Erwin along then.
- Marvin!

264
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,922
I'll sort it out with Head Office.
- Can our daughters come too?

265
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:18,092
Nah!
- Come on, party people, make some noise!

266
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,511
Whoop whoop!

267
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:23,223
What's going on here?

268
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:26,726
We're all going to the party after all!
- What?

269
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,482
Na na na na.

270
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,860
Heisterkamp.
- Er, Stromberg.

271
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:41,241
Yes. Yes, I got it.
- OK... Whoop whoop.

272
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,700
Whoop whoop.

273
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,626
So, where's this fucking bus?

274
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:56,506
Does the driver know we're waiting here?
- Am I Ulf, Jesus?

275
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,341
Well, what did you arrange?

276
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:03,054
Ulf, I was organizing this kind of thing
back when you were still in diapers.

277
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:06,641
There's no number that you can call and
ask where the bus is? - Nah.

278
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:10,228
What's the bus company called?
- Asshole Tours!

279
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,939
We'll be right back, Marvin's gotta go.
- Not now!

280
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,942
The bus is arriving any minute.
- Go back there somewhere.

281
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:19,821
Standing up, like real men.
- Hey people, we can get going.

282
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,365
As they say, saved the best for last.

283
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,827
Whoah, I really thought
you'd already gone.

284
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,414
Shit, I've forgotten something.
Save me a good seat!

285
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:33,334
This is really my idea of getting away.
- Just hold on a bit longer.

286
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,503
My ex's wedding would be
more fun than this.

287
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:39,799
Just forget your ex for a minute.
Look here, holidays in a bottle.

288
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,720
Love, er, Schirmchen,

289
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,974
love, I mean, I know from experience,
isn't a boxing match,

290
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,728
where one dishes it out and the other
hits straight back. - What's up?

291
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:57,233
Well, I'm just saying, we can use the
journey to, you know, get a little...

292
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:01,946
You're not seriously trying, here in a
parking lot... - No, of course not.

293
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,116
I wouldn't dream of it.
- All right then.

294
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,497
Just a minute, everyone.
Hey, everybody!

295
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:18,087
The last few months I've been
in a completely new position.

296
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:21,966
A completely new position...
- Well done, Ernie!

297
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,219
What he lacks in brains,
he makes up for in stupidity.

298
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:30,767
I just wanted to thank you all for
helping me out the whole time.

299
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:38,941
Well, most of the time. And so I've
brought a little something for all of you.

300
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:45,073
I've got aniseed cookies fresh from
Hessbacher's, and some nice sausages.

301
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:50,328
And there's some other things here.
- Marvin! What are you doing over there?

302
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:55,792
Ulf, I told you to go with him.
- Hey, Marvin come on.

303
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,424
I've always thought
that everyone else is against me,

304
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:07,011
and they are,
but I've got to see that positively.

305
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,305
That's what they said at career coaching.

306
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:17,146
Positive thinking's the most important.
No matter how bad, always stay positive.

307
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:20,733
It comes from America,
that's how they do it.

308
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:24,153
If they get shot, they think: "Crap,
but things'll be better in the morning."

309
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,280
And that's the way I think now.

310
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:42,088
Hello, my name is Heisterkamp.

311
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:49,595
Er, I've picked out
a route for us, to Botzenburg.

312
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:55,268
It may not be the quickest route,
but it's the most scenic.

313
00:23:55,393 --> 00:24:00,189
It's got a lot of nice things to see
that we can catch on the way.

314
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:04,277
I just did a pensioners' trip, right.
Prague, Moldau, Schwarzbier.

315
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:10,700
I've been driving for 11 hours. I'm not
supposed to do that, but I am doing it.

316
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,288
Even a dog knows that you can't pee
smack in the middle of a parking lot.

317
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,832
We had problems with our eldest too.
- Shut up.

318
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:18,958
Ulf!

319
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:24,547
We can take the highway here.
- I used to work in an office too.

320
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,966
And now I'm a bus driver. Why?

321
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,429
Because no one tells me what to do.

322
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,974
Right, listen. Men...

323
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:40,021
pee in public places, but they always find
something to pee up against, OK?

324
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,068
My seat.

325
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,238
OK, we'll leave
the picturesque stuff out then.

326
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:52,867
But here there's, like,
an observation point, so if we just...

327
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,079
At least here...
Would that be doable?

328
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:05,379
OK, we'll wait and see.

329
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:19,185
Here we go, here we go,
here we go, here we go!

330
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,022
Here we go, here we go,
here we go, here we go!

331
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,320
Here we go!

332
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:36,035
Just a second everybody.
I just wanted to say a few words.

333
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,663
Oh, sit down,
I don't need an opening act.

334
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,499
I've prepared something.
- Yeah, so have I.

335
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:49,173
I've written it all down.
- Oh God, shut up, are you crazy?

336
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:53,177
Hey!
- Don't use that tone with me!

337
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:56,264
I'm paying for the whole shebang!
- And I'm driving the whole shebang.

338
00:25:56,347 --> 00:26:01,811
And have been for over 12 hours now.
So. He was first. End of announcement.

339
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,156
Yes, so...

340
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,999
I'd switched it off. So, on the left
in a minute you'll see Tüngerstedt.

341
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:28,129
Lots of people died here in the WW I.
- Can someone turn on the radio?

342
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:33,342
Tüngerstedt has also got the third-largest
meat packing plant in Germany. - Ernie!

343
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:40,016
Although there's no connection between
those two, don't think so anyway.

344
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,603
Ernie, shut up and put some music on!

345
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:51,986
<i>Oh, beautiful Westerwald,</i>
<i>eucalyptus bonbons,</i>

346
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:55,740
<i>The wind blows</i>
<i>oh so cold above your treetops.</i>

347
00:26:55,823 --> 00:27:00,703
It works if you put in "bucket of jam",
or "pink ladies' underwear" too.

348
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,289
Look what Daddy's brought with him!

349
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,544
Should we try it with
"pink ladies' underwear"?

350
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:12,632
All on my tab as long as supplies last!
- All together?

351
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:14,342
Yes, I'll go round again in a minute.

352
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,637
I'm almost unbeatable under pressure.

353
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:25,561
Like that dog Lassie. You know Lassie?

354
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:30,232
She's just a fluffy little puppy, but when
things get tough, bang! Attack dog!

355
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:35,196
And then I really surpass myself
and bite everyone in the ass.

356
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,834
Can you open the window?

357
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:54,590
He didn't expect my beer move, did he.
- Hm? Who?

358
00:27:54,674 --> 00:28:00,429
Ernie. Tries his sausage trick and thinks
he's got them round his little finger,

359
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:03,724
but he fucked up.
Ernie's a classic fuck-up.

360
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:04,850
Want one too?

361
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:09,438
He comes from a long line of fuck-ups.
- Oh, leave the poor guy alone.

362
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:14,068
We want to get to the meat of things,
but not his, his meat is fucked! - Jesus.

363
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,655
Excuse me, who do you think
I'm doing all this for?

364
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:24,120
Why, is your Russian roulette tactic
not working? - Oh, my God...

365
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:28,165
The Russian chicks, that was just...
I'm into you of course. - Uh huh.

366
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:32,169
Who's gonna save you and the little one
when CAPITOL sacks you?

367
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:35,339
Why would that happen?

368
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:39,844
Well, you know, you hear things
all the time. Look at Greece.

369
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,054
Yesterday as strong as an ox
and now Third World country.

370
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,265
I'm not going to get fired overnight.

371
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:48,310
But, I don't know, do you
know something I don't? - Mm?

372
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:01,866
I'm just saying I'm there for you.
- OK.

373
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:06,328
You know? Tarzan, Jane.

374
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:07,496
OK, got it.

375
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:27,975
Tanja, that won't come out!
Marvin, that's an expensive jacket!

376
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,895
That's no reason to yell at him.
- I'm not yelling at him.

377
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,522
What's going on?
Jesus, what did you do now?

378
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:36,358
Marvin was playing with his pens.
- What the fuck are you doing?

379
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,528
Ulf!
- That'll never come out! What?

380
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,996
It's not a problem to tell him
it's not OK to draw everywhere.

381
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,582
For starters, you tell him
that you love him.

382
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:55,878
He's already been yelled at enough
in his life. - What love?

383
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,631
I've only known him a few weeks.

384
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,383
It took us over two year
to say, "I love you."

385
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,636
Oh, Ulf!
- Oh, Ulf!

386
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:07,681
I think it's no use when we let him
get away with everything.

387
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:10,184
We'll never be a real family like that.

388
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:14,146
Could you just try it my way? For me?
- Is this your kid?

389
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,732
Yeah, that's our son.
- He drew all over the windows!

390
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:20,736
Yeah, sorry, he's going through a
difficult time. What are you doing, man?

391
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,698
I've been driving for 13 hours. I don't
need trouble when I take the bus back.

392
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:29,119
We'll take care of it.
- His parents are kind of losers.

393
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:33,207
His real parents, that is.
- All my papers are ruined!

394
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,292
He's drawn rockets all over everything!

395
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:38,963
These are my papers for Head Office.
My application and everything!

396
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:43,342
And he's drawn rockets on them!
- Ernie, those aren't rockets.

397
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:47,638
OK, buddy, we've gotta talk now, OK.
- Those are penises!

398
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:51,725
That's right, isn't it? Those are penises.
- He can't draw that! Not here!

399
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:54,937
Can't? If you'd told Picasso
back in the day...

400
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,274
Picasso scribbled a dove,
and everyone said, "Oh, Peace."

401
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,025
But he's no Picasso.

402
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:05,030
On day people might say about our driver:
"Oh, gay!" - What was that?

403
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:07,449
Can't you guys pull yourself together?

404
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,870
Come on.
- Driver? Excuse me?

405
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:14,498
I think the toilet in the bus is broken!
Could you take a look?

406
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:17,835
It's a bit of an emergency.
- Gay.

407
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,888
It's broken.
- Yep, you can smell it.

408
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:35,144
What now? - Happens all the time. It was
the old folks. Nothing to do about it.

409
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:38,522
Can't do anything.
- And now what?

410
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:43,819
Hm? - Yeah, now you can be there for me.
Tarzan, hm?

411
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:52,161
Hello, driver! It's your job
to fix the toilet! - This is bad.

412
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:57,458
First I'm gay, and now
I'm a plumber, or what?

413
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:03,505
But those are both noble professions.

414
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,094
Udo Jürgens, to name just one, worked as a
plumber for years. Goethe...

415
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,722
Thanks for the help!

416
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,977
Oh, Schirm... Don't walk away.
I'm taking care of it!

417
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:23,817
So, chief, my patience is waning.
What are we going to do?

418
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,611
I'm taking a break.
That's what I'm doing.

419
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:48,717
Go away.
I can't pee if someone's looking.

420
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,059
Oh, I looked at myself.

421
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:11,615
I have to go so bad.
- Yeah, but where? There's nothing here.

422
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:16,537
Gotta get to the next town, but do you
know how far that is? - Must be 3 miles.

423
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,040
How's it going?
- Can't do it.

424
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:23,085
Oh, man.
- I'll just crap in the gas tank then.

425
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:27,131
Thank God I don't have to pee.
- So, chief, what are we gonna do now?

426
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:30,759
My people are pissing up and down the
countryside, and you're hibernating?

427
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:36,640
I've been driving for 14 hours. - I know.
You're the pride of exhaustion.

428
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:40,060
I have to be in Botzenburg at 5:00 pm.
If Klinkhammer already hit the sack,

429
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:43,605
I might as well not bother coming.
- We should drive to a rest stop.

430
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:47,317
The driver is called the driver
because he drives. He does the driving.

431
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:50,070
The others sit tight and shut up.
- Yeah.

432
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:53,323
And the boss is called the boss
because he...

433
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:59,913
This is unacceptable! You snap to it
and get us out of here, or else...

434
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:04,418
Or else what?
- I'll show you... the door.

435
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,563
But you can't just drive the bus!

436
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,775
You're not insured to drive it!
- Oh, come on!

437
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:30,360
I'm your insurance. Alright already,
now just let Daddy do it.

438
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:32,446
Otherwise, we'll be
sitting here next week.

439
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:38,535
An employee's natural instinct
is to take flight. Like a deer.

440
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:44,374
If there's a problem, he runs away, hides
and freezes like a deer in headlights.

441
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,251
Not me!

442
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:52,299
For me problems are like, uh...
Yeah, a nice set of tits.

443
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,886
When you handle them,
that's when the fun begins.

444
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:00,432
This is crazy! Totally crazy.
You're all going to die!

445
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:05,771
Make sure to get this. They're all heading
towards certain death, but without me.

446
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:10,025
I'm sure that the head office
will understand why,

447
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:13,987
if I don't come to the party tonight.
- Hm?

448
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:19,368
They can't ask me to put my life in danger
for the company.

449
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,371
This is just crazy.
That's what it is!

450
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:42,307
This is just crazy, my God!

451
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:44,434
Door!

452
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:47,980
You're all gonna die.

453
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:53,902
Lurchi, Lurchi, Lurchi, Lurchi...

454
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:02,411
Lurchi, Lurchi, Lurchi, Lurchi...

455
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,062
Whoo whoo!

456
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,907
Whoo whoo!

457
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,369
Yes, ladies and gentelmen,

458
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:48,165
on your right you can see a sign:
"Botzenburg, 6 miles".

459
00:36:54,463 --> 00:37:00,260
Botzenburg! Botzenburg! Botzenburg!

460
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,094
Come with me.

461
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:45,305
Come here. Come on.

462
00:37:55,482 --> 00:38:01,780
So. Look. I've prepared this just for you.
Set up everything.

463
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,075
Hello.
- Hello.

464
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:08,954
Excuse me, could you snap a quick photo
of the two of us? - Oh, no.

465
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,372
Come on, just one.
- No.

466
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:14,501
Here in front of the heart. Come on.
Just one won't hurt anything. Come on.

467
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:18,297
Don't look down too much.
- This is live, this isn't a DJ.

468
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,009
3, 2, 1...
- Check, check.

469
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,719
One more, if you don't mind.

470
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:28,598
One two, one two, R2, D2.

471
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:31,059
Great. Thank you.

472
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:36,648
Hey, people, that's love,
the best feeling in the world.

473
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:43,030
Why we get out of bed in the morning.
Cause when we're on our death bed,

474
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,367
we won't say: "Man, I should have
spent more time in the office."

475
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:55,167
Look at that, your ex.
This one's also named Andreas.

476
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:00,380
I'm Günni, back at you.
Name the tune, and I'll play it.

477
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:07,220
Let's get this party started.
- I'll go see what's going on up front.

478
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:19,107
For me love was always
something like the chickenpox.

479
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:24,112
Something that you can
only catch one time.

480
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:32,371
It's so strange that my ex
is just getting married again.

481
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:39,878
It makes me feel like
I'm just some sort of mistake.

482
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:45,884
Like a beat up fax machine
that no one needs anymore.

483
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:54,142
You know, it always worked great,
but now we've got email.

484
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,564
Oh, someone's already here.
We didn't see you.

485
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:04,986
Hi. I'm Mina, Laura's maid of honor.
Are you from Andreas's side?

486
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,823
Here, take a Prosecco.

487
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:12,994
Andreas is Latin for asshole.
- Oh, OK.

488
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:18,375
And love is also an asshole.

489
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,919
Bye!

490
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:36,184
Sorry, all I have in the system
is a double room for you two.

491
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:40,939
But we've got our son with us.
Our son isn't a second class person!

492
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:44,651
Hey, I thought you wanted to fix this
with the Head Office,

493
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,404
but somehow Marvin
doesn't have a reservation.

494
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:51,616
Oh? But we can surely
find a solution here, right?

495
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,744
Unfortunately, he's not in the system.
- Then let's put him in now.

496
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:59,875
Sorry, that's no longer possible.
- You're as flexible as the Taliban.

497
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:03,712
We're completely booked out.
- This is so typical, man!

498
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,590
Why do I believe anything
you say anymore?

499
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:14,097
I want to speak with your manager
right away, pronto Toronto!

500
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:20,812
We could put an extra bed in your room.
- OK, then!

501
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,231
I'll let my colleague know.
- Yeah, go do that.

502
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,775
Handling problems.

503
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,986
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

504
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,201
And now that we've
already gotten friendly,

505
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:39,414
Stromberg, Bernd Stromberg.
would like to check into his suite.

506
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,920
I've had it up to here, really.

507
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:57,974
You're not exactly
living in the fast lane, huh?

508
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:02,521
I'm sorry, but you're also
not in the system.

509
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:12,739
Hear that? That was the thread
my patience was hanging by. It ripped!

510
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,158
I can only tell you what I see.
You could...

511
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:18,537
I'd suggest you get you hips moving
and get your boss, and quick.

512
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,539
Appi galoppi.

513
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:31,716
See how it's done?

514
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,846
It's already small for a double room,
but now...

515
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,225
This doesn't have anything
to do with you, Marvin.

516
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:48,483
Marvin, do you want
a piece of apple or a cookie?

517
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,783
That's not so bad. The people from
the hotel can fix that in a jiff.

518
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,163
That too.
- So, I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

519
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:05,083
And you too. Get out of here.

520
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:09,212
Hey! You finally made it?
- Yeah, we just got here.

521
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:11,006
I was just going to the sauna.
- OK.

522
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:14,509
You could pour water over the stones.
- It's a bit complicated at the moment.

523
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:19,472
Man, you've become as stuffy as
a garden gnome. Hold this.

524
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,559
Hey!
- Hey, relax.

525
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,270
We're on a trip!
You can still think about it.

526
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:29,649
They've got a mixed sauna! Mixed,
for women and squares! Wait a sec.

527
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:36,656
Love?
No idea. Love?

528
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,910
Love is like a scratch-off lotto ticket.

529
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,873
You only know afterwards
if you've won or lost.

530
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,959
Actually, it's even worse.
You're sure you hit the jackpot.

531
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:52,797
Only after a certain period of time do you
notice that you got stuck with a dud.

532
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:58,887
Although, a dud is also bullshit.
A consolation prize. No, also not.

533
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,806
I, oh, I have no idea. I don't know.

534
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,269
Maybe in the long run,
there aren't any winners.

535
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,866
Oh.

536
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:23,536
Hello, I understand there's a problem?

537
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,749
Excuse me?
- Oh, I just nodded off for a second.

538
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,751
Yeah, indeed, my good man,
there is a problem.

539
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,546
For starters when I got here,
I still had a full head of hair.

540
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,257
Aside form that,
I feel like Mary and Joseph.

541
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:39,803
In particular, I find no shelter
in your, uh, manger.

542
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:43,515
Oh, I'm sorry about that. I'll check that
right away. - Yep, Bernd Stromberg.

543
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,184
I'm one of the bigger fish at CAPITOL,
you know?

544
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:49,979
My name is Klinkhammer, Director of HR,
CAPITOL Head Office.

545
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:51,648
I'll get this checked out, Mr. Stromberg,

546
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,192
but you know that it's how you say
something, not what you say?

547
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:57,946
Sure, I'm a big fan of it.
I always tell my people:

548
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:01,074
"What you reap, you can't put back
in the bag with the cat."

549
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,034
That's not what I'm getting from you.
- But, no.

550
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:07,997
My conversational style is like a sheep
in sheep's clothing, so to say.

551
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:10,500
Could you check this out?
- What's he doing here?

552
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,420
You know each other?
- Well, know each other...

553
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:18,508
We were in the same department,
and he was my colleague, practically.

554
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:22,887
Yeah, back then it was more
"Burrito-Stupido" or "Chilli-Willi".

555
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:25,390
Or Rodrigo...
- No, Ricardo Montalban.

556
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:29,811
Yeah, Ricardo Montalban, just a joke.
Although I have to say...

557
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:33,815
Turks are a particular risk group,
from an actuarial point of view.

558
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:37,694
Because for the price of one Turk, you can
insure three Vietnamese. That's a fact!

559
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:41,406
Mr. Turculu is in charge
of organizing this event.

560
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,700
Mr. Stolberg is having trouble with
checking in. - Stromberg.

561
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,785
Stromberg is his name.
- Oh, Stromberg.

562
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:55,086
And you're at the Head Office now,
or what?

563
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,380
Yeah, that's great!

564
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:01,801
No, I can't find you.
You didn't register. - But, I did.

565
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:02,927
No.
- Yes.

566
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:04,471
No.
- Yes.

567
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:08,099
Mr. Turculu is very thorough.
- That he is, you have to give it to him.

568
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:11,436
Could it be that something slipped past?
- I'm affraid not.

569
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,897
No, I'm affraid not.

570
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,565
Well.
- Yeah, it's not a problem.

571
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:18,735
Problems are just a challenge for me,
like a nice set of tits.

572
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,362
You simply have to handle them.
Or rather...

573
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,618
Yeah, I'm a very popular boss.

574
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:29,704
I can room with one of my colleagues,
no problem.

575
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:34,667
You don't have to worry about me.
I'll be OK.

576
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:46,387
Hey, um, you've got a double room, right?

577
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,265
Oh, I don't know.
I haven't been upstairs yet.

578
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:51,309
I got stuck at that wedding.

579
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:54,562
These meat heads screwed up my
reservation. Now I'm out in the cold.

580
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:58,483
I'm so done with men. It's so clear now.
- Hm.

581
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,360
I was just asking if you might,

582
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,238
If you were by any chance game
that the two of us...

583
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,199
Huh?
- I just need to sleep with you.

584
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:08,785
You're unblievable.

585
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:12,497
No, I don't mean sleep in the sense of...

586
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,624
Schirmchen, wait a minute.

587
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:18,753
Oh God, I know I get on peoples nerves
sometimes, but doesn't everyone,

588
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:22,173
even the best of us. Just think what a
pain Yin was for Yang. - Huh?

589
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:25,510
I bet Yang was ready to hurl when
Yin stepped in the door.

590
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:29,764
I don't get a word you're saying.
What do you want? - To sleep in your room!

591
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:32,016
No way, forget it!

592
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:34,727
What?

593
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:50,827
Lehnhoff!
Man, how are you?

594
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:53,997
I just phoned home,
and our youngest has a fever. - Great.

595
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,291
You've got a double room, right?
- Mm.

596
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:02,297
Yeah, cause I need a place
to sleep tonight. - Oh, why's that?

597
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:04,841
Oh, why's that?

598
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:08,219
Why, why, why? Why can't a one legged man
kick himself in the ass?

599
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:10,638
I've got to sleep somewhere, man!

600
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:13,141
Mr. Stolberg.
- Oh, Mr. Klink... Is he bothering you?

601
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:16,060
I'll hose him down. That'll
help for a bit. - On the contrary.

602
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:20,189
We had a great conversation.
- Yes, I have to agree, Klaus.

603
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:24,652
And you? Did you find a place to sleep?
- Yes, well no, but that's going.

604
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,446
He said that you don't have a room.

605
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:29,908
Yeah, Ernie, I'm working out something.
You can stop mingling here.

606
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,160
You don't know anyone anyway!
- You can stay with me.

607
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:35,079
I've got a nice big room.
- Yeah, right.

608
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:39,959
Great. We were just talking about the
impotance of teamwork. - Yeah.

609
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:44,339
Fantastic, that's a a great idea.
And it also helps you out, right?

610
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:47,425
So, a win-win-win situation
for everyone involved.

611
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:52,889
Super, super, super. Yeah, then we'll see
each other later at the party.

612
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,850
Yeah.
- See you, Klaus.

613
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:57,393
Heisterkamp.

614
00:48:57,477 --> 00:49:00,980
Smother them with kindness,
a trick I learned from the Asians.

615
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:03,650
I've learned that.
The Asians have to do it that way,

616
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:05,902
otherwise, they lose face.

617
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:10,406
Saving face isn't so important with us,
but it's still good.

618
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,617
Hm.
- Yep.

619
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,594
What are you doing there?

620
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:36,099
Do you think I want to be
spooning and poking you later tonight?

621
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,351
This guy...

622
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,917
Yeah...

623
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,550
Occupied!

624
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:15,763
Oh, you're still here.
I thought you'd already left.

625
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:28,860
There are things you put up with for the
job that you would never do privately.

626
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:32,572
That's why a company
is stronger that a marriage.

627
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:35,575
You'd never let yourself
be treated this way by a woman.

628
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:41,914
But in this joint they shit on your head,
and you say thank you for the hat.

629
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:58,181
Hey, have you seen Ulf?
- No, not since the party started.

630
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:01,601
Shit!
- Oh, sorry.

631
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:06,939
Oh God, did it stain?
- It's just beer, could've been red wine.

632
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:09,525
Even then you're fully insured.

633
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:13,321
Tanja Steinke, claims adjustment.
- Hartmut Münchow, sales.

634
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,740
This is my colleague Kolbe.
- Hello.

635
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,408
You're dismissed, young man.

636
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:21,829
Say you're sorry, Marvin.
- Oh, he's really yours?

637
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:24,749
Yeah.
- And why did you bring him with you?

638
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,919
That's a long story.
- We were told no family.

639
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:32,256
I know. Marvin is my foster child.
- Oh well, that's something different.

640
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:36,052
You must have a heart of gold.
- I cleared it with my boss.

641
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:39,972
I can imagine what "clearing" looks like.
You know what I mean, Ingo?

642
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,310
What's that supposed to mean?
I thought we...

643
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:48,731
I'd have liked to bring my kids along too.
I've even got real kids,

644
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:51,984
but I obviously don't have the boobs
to get special treatment.

645
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:56,489
No, you women who always want
special treatment drive me crazy.

646
00:51:57,323 --> 00:52:00,910
For your information,
my husband asked for permission.

647
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:05,373
He's also here. You're welcome to voice
your complaint to him directly,

648
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,960
form man to man.
Come on, Marvin.

649
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:10,837
From man to man.

650
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,218
I think I need to get back upstairs.

651
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:20,179
Sauna, samba, jingle jingleling!

652
00:52:20,263 --> 00:52:23,474
Wait a sec, Auntie Sabine
is gonna christen you with love.

653
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:25,643
Ah!

654
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:30,106
Mr. Stromberg, have you seen Ulf?
- Nope.

655
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,151
Can you look after Marvin?
- Nope.

656
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,452
So, how's it hanging?

657
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:47,707
Yeah, it's a company party.
No one's having fun.

658
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:52,712
Of course it's even shittier for you,
you can't even drink.

659
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:58,426
Wow, you're yacking like a waterfall, man.

660
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:08,561
When I was your age, I was like that too,
always a bit alone.

661
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:13,566
But real heros are always alone, huh?

662
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:18,696
Tarzan didn't form a working group
before he reached for the vine.

663
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:22,700
Oh well.
And then I thought:

664
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:27,663
Damn, these people can kiss my ass,
left and right butt cheek.

665
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:31,000
Yeah, and to be honest...

666
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:36,172
it's stayed the same till today.

667
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:56,692
Hi, I was just going up to change.
- I've been looking for you all over.

668
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:58,402
Yeah, I was in the sauna.

669
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:00,947
You said you were stepping out for a
minute, and then you were gone!

670
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,740
Let's not get things mixed up here.

671
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,451
The one who has to ask for permission
is this tall and named Marvin.

672
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:08,871
I'm already this tall
and am allow to go out on my own.

673
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:11,916
Don't you think
I would've also liked to go to the spa?

674
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,252
You can skip it. It wasn't so great.

675
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:22,510
Next stop: Kill Joy Way, Boringtown.
Hi, Tanja.

676
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:28,391
Oops. Room on the third floor,
but the mood is in the basement.

677
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,602
Here, don't forget your hat.

678
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:37,733
Come on, we're going to our room.

679
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:02,550
Go ask the nice lady to get you a cola.
Go on over there, come on.

680
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:07,138
Oh no, who do we have here?
The proud father.

681
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:11,559
Oh, no, he's not mine.
- Yeah, we heard that already.

682
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:15,646
I'm the one you're supposed
to set straight,

683
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,858
"from man to man".
- What?

684
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:26,282
Yeah, get going. I'm waiting!
- Oh...

685
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:31,579
Um...
- What's your problem, buddy?

686
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:42,089
I was the opening act for Bernhard Brink,
and now weddings in Botzenburg.

687
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:47,595
Weddings are just paliative care for love.

688
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:53,893
Today it's the best day of your life,
but really it's the beginning of the end.

689
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:59,148
"Can you play some hip hop?"
"Do you have anything by Justin Bieber?"

690
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,776
Man, if Justin Bieber walked in here,

691
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:06,530
I'd rip his head off
and play Bernhard Brink on his skull.

692
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:10,242
That would definitely be an improvement.

693
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:13,662
Shit.
- You can say that again!

694
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:15,164
Heisterkamp.

695
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:19,543
Mr. Klinkhammer, good evening.
- Nice to meet you.

696
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,212
Heisterkamp, claims adjustment.

697
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:26,300
You just can't ever give up.
True quality rises to the top in the end.

698
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,302
But sometimes Ernie comes out on top.

699
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:32,348
Oh man, who gives a shit about Ernie now?
- Oh no, you can't dismiss him.

700
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:33,766
You still can't give up.

701
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:38,229
There are other things in life
besides this stupid office!

702
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:43,943
Man, outside there's the world.
Everything is full of the world.

703
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:46,737
You say it like it's a good thing.
- Yeah.

704
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:50,408
I have expectations for my life,
know what I mean?

705
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:54,078
Things I want in my life,
and it shouldn't be like it is now.

706
00:56:54,161 --> 00:57:01,210
It should be nicer. Oh fuck,
why can't it be nicer?

707
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:09,844
<i>Don't give up,</i>
<i>even when they've shown you the door.</i>

708
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:17,351
<i>Don't give up.</i>
<i>Life promises so much more.</i>

709
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,855
I wrote that for Bernhard,
- It's nice

710
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:25,526
but the assholes at the record label
didn't want it. - Bernhard Brink?

711
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:26,777
Yeah.

712
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:33,242
I wanted to get Roberto, no,
Roland Kaiser for a board meeting.

713
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:35,786
Yeah, really!
That was before your time.

714
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,373
Of course he was too expensive,
and who did it in the end?

715
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:42,668
Daddy! It was a hit, let me tell you.
- Daddy.

716
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:49,425
<i>Let Daddy do it,</i>
<i>Daddy does it good.</i>

717
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:52,052
Good.
- Bernhard Brink?

718
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:58,309
No, just so. - That's true,
because Daddy isn't just anyone.

719
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:03,564
Yeah, striking the iron
even when it's fucking cold...

720
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,773
was always my talent.

721
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:08,569
You're the Bruce Willis
of quarterly reports - Damn straight.

722
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,988
Hey, I was being ironic.
- No.

723
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:20,789
Mr. Klinkhammer, I just wanted to say...

724
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:24,210
you've gotten the wrong impression of me
from the start.

725
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:27,671
And now you want to fix it?
- Yes.

726
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:31,592
Actually, I think I'd be a perfect
addition to the Head Office - Why?

727
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:37,431
Because I'll bring in fresh wind
without creating a draft.

728
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:40,476
I'm ambitious, but not too much.

729
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,814
I'm a man with a flat zenith,
and I do people. - What?

730
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,735
Oh, hm?
- What do you do with people?

731
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,779
Whatever you want.

732
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,114
I'm sure that in most executive suites...

733
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:58,577
it's actually rarer to find
a real leader than a woman.

734
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:02,164
Should we get started?
- Ms. Berkel, what are you doing here?

735
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:04,875
Mr. Stromberg?
- Ms. Berkel is hosting the event.

736
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:07,002
It's like a class reunion.
- You know each other?

737
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:10,297
Yeah, we know each other.
she was my "boss".

738
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:13,259
Why "..."?
- Well, you're a "woman".

739
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:17,263
I don't mean "woman", in quotation marks,
because she's certainly got...

740
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:21,767
Please! We don't tolerate sexism
at CAPITOL. - Absolutely right.

741
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:23,894
I see you haven't changed.

742
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:25,938
She's not my type
for sexism, but...

743
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:30,776
Ms. Berkel is about to unveil the new
Capitol TV spot, isn't that right?

744
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:32,820
You've got dog shit on your shoe.

745
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,949
But anyway...
- I'll wait another 5 minutes.

746
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:39,243
5 minutes will be enough.

747
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,873
OK.
- Let me know when we can start.

748
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,709
I'll do that.
- We'll do that.

749
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,377
There was nothing there!

750
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:52,464
I can also do something on stage
with my department, right, Klaus?

751
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:54,049
Mm.

752
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:59,680
At first I thought I wouldn't find
a rhyme for claims adjustment.

753
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:04,143
Let me see. Government.
- Yeah.

754
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:20,117
No problem, I've got it memorized.

755
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,369
Hello.

756
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:27,583
I think that's him over there.
- Could you be any more obvious?

757
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,918
Should I deck him,
or what did you have in mind?

758
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:32,880
That's OK, I bet you're still
exhausted from the sauna.

759
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:36,050
What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing. Marvin?

760
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:40,095
Hey, everytime I watch
an action film, you say:

761
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:43,515
"Why are you watching that violent crap?"
And now I'm the sissy?

762
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,102
Marvin!
- I'm not, not at all.

763
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:51,190
I even did Tae Kwon Do.
Yeah, that's right.

764
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,442
I could take on anyone in the room.

765
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:57,029
You know, the most important thing
you learn is how to evade.

766
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:58,614
Then you don't even have to attack.

767
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:04,453
Sure, you learn how to punch
in Tae Kwon Do and also kicks...

768
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,580
Oh!

769
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:07,748
Marvin?

770
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:12,419
Dear colleagues, on behalf of the
management, I'm privileged to...

771
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:17,383
be able to welcome you to what promises
to be a fantastic evening in Botzenburg.

772
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:21,762
Over 50 years ago, the foundations for
the first CAPITOL branch...

773
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,472
in Germany were laid here.

774
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:27,226
But we don't want
to get nostalgic just yet.

775
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,603
We don't want to start by looking back.

776
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:34,108
Indeed, only a select few of us
were there in person 50 years ago.

777
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,489
The financial crisis has shown us...

778
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:43,283
that we can't just keep going like before.

779
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:46,870
We have to be more transparent
and above all more honest.

780
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:49,164
Trust is the way.

781
01:01:49,665 --> 01:01:54,211
To get this message across,
we're launching a major ad campaign,

782
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:59,675
and I'm glad to be able to share
the new CAPITOL spot with you now.

783
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:01,093
Enjoy!

784
01:02:07,516 --> 01:02:12,563
<i>Insurance companies?</i>
<i>I've got no idea what you're really like.</i>

785
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:14,690
<i>Supposedly, you're there for me,</i>

786
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:17,526
<i>but all I know about you</i>
<i>is filling out forms.</i>

787
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:21,864
<i>That's not really the best start</i>
<i>for a relationship, don't you think?</i>

788
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:26,118
<i>Here at CAPITOL, we've heard you.</i>
<i>We're more than a stack of forms.</i>

789
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:30,038
<i>We are people. People you can trust</i>
<i>completely without reservation.</i>

790
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:33,500
<i>People who understand</i>
<i>that life can have many facets.</i>

791
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:36,086
<i>We speak plain English not legalese.</i>

792
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,965
<i>Take us on our word, because nothing</i>
<i>is as convincing as the truth.</i>

793
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:45,846
<i>Trust is the way.</i>

794
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,106
Yes, we made a conscious decision...

795
01:02:56,190 --> 01:03:01,653
here at CAPITOL to not use
a professional actor, rather me.

796
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:08,076
We wanted to make it
as authentic as possible, and...

797
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:12,539
Evening, boss. This is the next one.

798
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,084
Um...
- Yeah, this is the next one. Just do it.

799
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:19,087
We've also shot
another clip for this campaign,

800
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:22,341
which I, of course,
wouldn't want to keep from you.

801
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:29,807
<i>Oh! My name is Bernd Stromberg.</i>

802
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:31,558
<i>Here...</i>

803
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,143
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>- Good morning.</i>

804
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:38,232
<i>...in my claims department, I make sure</i>
<i>that fun doesn't get neglected.</i>

805
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:45,739
<i>We don't delude ourselves. Our work at</i>
<i>CAPITOL isn't always a bowl of cherries.</i>

806
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:51,286
<i>When it comes to technology,</i>
<i>we've got the state of the art.</i>

807
01:03:53,539 --> 01:03:58,752
<i>Even though it's the state of the art</i>
<i>for East Germany in 1991.</i>

808
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:03,465
<i>At least, on good days,</i>
<i>we've even got power, some of the time.</i>

809
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:11,557
<i>To make up for that,</i>
<i>there's a wealth of other incentives...</i>

810
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,892
<i>to make a fresh start</i>
<i>and go to work every day.</i>

811
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:21,358
<i>Last but not least,</i>
<i>there are our valued colleagues,</i>

812
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:25,362
<i>who make working at CAPITOL such a joy.</i>

813
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,617
<i>All the stuff from my mom!</i>

814
01:04:30,701 --> 01:04:34,621
<i>Remember our colleagues are people</i>
<i>just like you and me.</i>

815
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:44,840
<i>Well actually, more like you.</i>

816
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:02,107
Yeah, that wasn't authentic but honest.

817
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:11,033
There's no question that
we need to have a bit of fun,

818
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:13,952
and our colleague Mr. Stromberg
has taken care of that.

819
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:17,581
Now I'd like to get on
with the rest of the scheduled program.

820
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:21,001
I just wanted to say that was edited
in a very unflattering way.

821
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:24,880
Yeah, cause that's not how I am,
and I hope that's clear to everyone!

822
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:28,342
Everyone knows that. This is our Ernie!

823
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:35,766
Yeah, and to everyone who laughs at that,
I say shame on you, double shame on you.

824
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:41,271
No wonder everyone says that
the Germans haven't got a sense of humor.

825
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:48,278
Yeah, the office is war.
I've always said that.

826
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:51,156
You don't win a war with the Salvation
Army, but with the Foreign Legion.

827
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:58,538
And they don't take prisoners.
Business is business and not benevolence.

828
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:02,292
And what's the point of business?
Me and me alone.

829
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:10,258
Er, and you. If you don't fight
for yourself, no one will.

830
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:12,719
That's how it is.

831
01:06:12,803 --> 01:06:16,640
There's no rekindling this flame!
That's official.

832
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:20,310
What were you thinking?
- He's always been like that.

833
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:24,314
Without fun the party's done,
old Russian saying.

834
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:27,985
If you ask me, you can go home now.
- Quicker than now, if you ask me!

835
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:30,237
But the people liked it.

836
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:33,907
The applause for your spot
wasn't exactly overwhelming, was it.

837
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:38,245
More underwhelming. - But he had them
laughing and howling, and how.

838
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,622
Yeah, but you can't compare the two!

839
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:44,001
We had two focus groups.
- And it tested really well.

840
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:50,424
The atom bomb
was also tested twice and really well.

841
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:54,761
If we can't convince our own people,

842
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:57,639
how can they convince other people?
- Yes.

843
01:06:57,723 --> 01:07:02,769
Of course, I still think that was a crappy
thing for you to do. - Yes, that's clear.

844
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:06,148
Ten stiffs to go.
- What?

845
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:10,402
That's the film about all the employees
who died last year.

846
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:13,739
I'm not going out there.
- What's that supposed to mean?

847
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:16,908
Understandable, if you get panned
in front of your own people....

848
01:07:16,992 --> 01:07:20,412
I never should've gone along with
this stupid ad. - Nonsense.

849
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:24,624
No, she's right, if you ask me.
- Seven stiffs left!

850
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:28,712
Well, someone's got to go out
in front of the audience!

851
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:32,883
So far you came over great, Ms. Berkel.
- If by great, you mean shit.

852
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,509
Pull yourself together!

853
01:07:34,593 --> 01:07:39,556
You know how much is riding
on this evening - Four stiffs left.

854
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:45,353
OK, kids, then I'll do it.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

855
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:47,064
Yeah.
- I can do it.

856
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:49,775
You can trust me, Klaus.

857
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:54,488
First the normal program, then we've got
a number with pom-poms and the works.

858
01:07:58,116 --> 01:08:01,912
Dear colleagues, I'm Berthold.

859
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:05,165
You've already seen me
in the little film a minute ago.

860
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:08,502
That was just a joke, the whole thing.

861
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,381
Yeah, even the part where
I got mad about it, that too.

862
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:18,970
OK. Now we'll take a trip back
into the history of Botzenburg.

863
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:22,974
This isn't only the birthplace of CAPITOL,

864
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:28,230
it's also the place where the famous
composer Robert Schumann...

865
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:35,529
tried to kill himself in 1844,
which of course didn't work.

866
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:41,326
Instead, he composed
the String Quartet in A Major.

867
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:50,252
Our colleague Mr. Turculu,
who organized this evening,

868
01:08:50,377 --> 01:08:55,090
was able to get the Botzenburg String
Orchestra, no, Ensemble,

869
01:08:55,173 --> 01:09:02,180
who will now give us a taste
of this String, er, Quartett.

870
01:09:02,264 --> 01:09:05,642
For your pissing leisure.
Listening pleasure!

871
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,507
Yeah, that was "Joy in Osnabrück".

872
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:41,636
Fabiana has put in a request for
Justin Bieber's "Baby".

873
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:46,141
I'll play that in a minute,
but first here's a song of my own,

874
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,810
for Jennifer, who's standing up front.

875
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:54,774
Here we go for her and you:
"Don't give up!"

876
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:07,329
<i>High expectations, only frustrations,</i>
<i>That was your life till now.</i>

877
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:14,836
<i>Stuck in desperation,</i>
<i>Can't go on, don't know how.</i>

878
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:22,969
<i>Let them talk, even when they say,</i>
<i>It's not smart.</i>

879
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:27,849
<i>Oh, listen to your heart,</i>
<i>Your beating heart...</i>

880
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:31,186
Wanna dance?
- What, with you?

881
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:35,857
I've got a room here. 209.

882
01:10:41,363 --> 01:10:46,076
It's got one of those things in the
bathroom. What are they called?

883
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,412
You know, an ass washer.
- Oh, God.

884
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:17,816
But the water was totally cold.
Damn, it sends a chill up your spine.

885
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:23,321
So what about that dance?

886
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:27,575
Sorry, people, small emergency.
Günni's got to go take care of it.

887
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:33,415
But don't worry, I'll be right back.

888
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:08,158
Shh! Shh!

889
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,202
Shh!
- Shh!

890
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:18,668
That's the music you'd play to drive away
the junkies at the train station.

891
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:27,218
Whenever I hear violins, I think
did something happen to Grandma?

892
01:12:27,302 --> 01:12:31,056
Yes, thank you very much.
It was just beautiful.

893
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:36,102
Who's ready to get this party started?

894
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:42,484
That's what I thought.
That's why we spared not costs,

895
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:48,281
and we've brought you the A-bomb of
the weapons of mass entertainment: moi!

896
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:52,911
So, let's get this party started.

897
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:57,624
Let's get this joint rocking!

898
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:02,003
<i>Does your customer put the ass in hole,</i>

899
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:07,342
<i>Chewing your ear off like Van Gogh?</i>

900
01:13:09,094 --> 01:13:18,228
<i>And does he talk complete shit?</i>
<i>Yeah, who can take care of it?</i>

901
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:25,568
<i>Let Daddy do it,</i>
<i>Daddy does it good.</i>

902
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:30,657
<i>Move on over, let Daddy come over,</i>
<i>Daddy does it really good.</i>

903
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:37,163
<i>Let Daddy do it,</i>
<i>Daddy does it good.</i>

904
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:42,419
<i>Let Daddy do it,</i>
<i>Daddy does it good.</i>

905
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:49,843
<i>Is your sex not up to specs,</i>

906
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:55,723
<i>Cause your woman's not getting</i>
<i>What she expects?</i>

907
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:01,563
<i>You got the world's softest dick.</i>

908
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:06,860
<i>Call Daddy, his is like a brick!</i>

909
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:26,754
Asshole.

910
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:32,594
<i>Let Daddy do it,</i>
<i>Daddy does it good.</i>

911
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:39,184
<i>Let Daddy do it,</i>
<i>Daddy does it good. Take it away!</i>

912
01:14:41,436 --> 01:14:44,481
Sorry, sorry, sorry,

913
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:47,025
but you know what?
It would really help out,

914
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:50,069
if you didn't draw peckers
all over everything.

915
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:59,370
What? Come on,
I'll defend your family name. No worries.

916
01:15:00,747 --> 01:15:04,083
<i>If you can't control your life at all,</i>

917
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:09,255
<i>And you're running at full speed</i>
<i>against the wall,</i>

918
01:15:11,758 --> 01:15:15,428
<i>Then you'll find you've lost your mind.</i>

919
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:23,144
<i>Yeah, then call Daddy,</i>
<i>Cause he can do it blind! Everyone:</i>

920
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:28,066
<i>Let Daddy do it,</i>
<i>Daddy does it good.</i>

921
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:34,322
<i>Good! Let Daddy do it,</i>
<i>Daddy does it good.</i>

922
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:40,328
<i>Even better! Let Daddy do it,</i>
<i>Daddy does it good.</i>

923
01:15:40,411 --> 01:15:47,335
<i>And once more! Let Daddy do it,</i>
<i>Daddy does it good.</i>

924
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:54,008
<i>Let Daddy do it,</i>
<i>Daddy does it good.</i>

925
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:02,684
Thank you, Botzenburg!
Thank you so much!

926
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:16,030
Encore! Encore! Encore!

927
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,991
Can you hear me, people?

928
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:24,163
<i>We are all, all, all, all,</i>
<i>We are all, all, all, all...</i>

929
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:35,300
That was fantastic, Stromberg.
Do you have more of that on tap?

930
01:16:35,383 --> 01:16:38,052
You bet!
- Yeah? That's great.

931
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:41,556
I thought my ear drum was going to bust
when they started sawing on the violins.

932
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:45,351
What was Turculu thinking?
He comes with this cultural stuff!

933
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:47,895
That's where you see
the cultural differences.

934
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:51,482
Someone's got to say it.
- And now Berkel's getting pissed.

935
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:55,820
Yeah, a woman isn't automatically clever,
just because she looks like shit.

936
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:59,866
<i>We are all over 40!</i>

937
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:02,994
Women want equal treatment,
but when the ship's sinking:

938
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:04,370
"Women and children first!"

939
01:17:04,454 --> 01:17:13,171
<i>All, all, all, all.</i>
<i>We are all over 40. We are all!</i>

940
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:17,467
Thanks, you've been great!
- Hello? What's up next?

941
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:21,846
The awards for years of service.
- I thought I could recite a poem before.

942
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:24,974
Yeah? No! I think we'll let
Mr. Stromberg handle this.

943
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:29,437
Yeah, Ernie, be a good boy
and go get me a beer. And bye!

944
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,816
Encore! Encore!
- Botzenburg, here I am again!

945
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:42,408
Heartfelt congratulations,
hard to believe, a quarter century.

946
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:44,952
And an umbrella,
not because you'll need a cane soon,

947
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:49,290
but so you won't get caught in the rain.
Line up over there. Lutz Kollinger.

948
01:17:49,374 --> 01:17:54,462
And now I'd like to...
Yeah, I just have to do this.

949
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:57,674
Finally, I'd like to call up
to the stage someone...

950
01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:00,802
who hasn't been with CAPITOL so long,

951
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:04,972
but who's already done more than so many
who've been here much longer.

952
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:08,017
That is with me at least.

953
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:11,187
Oh, I'm not so good at this.

954
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:15,817
They should just come on up here.
Uh, Jennifer!

955
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:20,863
Jennifer, Jennifer Schirmann!
Schirmchen, come on up here!

956
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:24,492
A round of applause to wake her up?

957
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,370
In my office there's so little sunlight...

958
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:30,832
that my solar calculator
doesn't even work,

959
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:37,547
but Jennifer makes up for that
with her smile.

960
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:45,847
Schirmchen, you're truly the best thing
that could've happened in my job.

961
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:52,019
But she knows all that. Let's see what I
can find in these weeds. This is for you!

962
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:55,356
Oh!

963
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:02,280
Romantic. Oh God!

964
01:19:03,156 --> 01:19:04,198
Thanks.

965
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:09,662
I think men don't even know
what romantic is in the first place.

966
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:13,458
Outside of a fire place,
a fire isn't necessarily romantic,

967
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:17,962
it could just be damages.

968
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:21,883
And that's how Bernd is, actually all men.

969
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:25,011
I don't know if any man ever did...

970
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,805
something truly romantic for me.

971
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:37,148
Say, baby, you game
for some dirty dancing? Hm?

972
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,025
Oh!

973
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,402
She wasn't that hot anyway.

974
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:46,032
He was standing behind his desk
grinning at me like a Cheshire cat,

975
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:48,743
And then I said to him watch out, buddy,

976
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:51,746
I pissed in your pool last night,

977
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:55,291
and I put the clay pellets
from the hydroculture in your cereal,

978
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:57,877
but I didn't get it on film!

979
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:03,841
Hello, I understand there was
a bit of problem earlier.

980
01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:07,053
And I think it's bullshit if...
- Hm?

981
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:12,892
With Marvin over there.
- Oh, yeah. The rug rat?

982
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:16,771
He spilled half the drinks menu on my fly!
- Really, did he?

983
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:20,858
Now I have to wait till the chicks aren't
paying attention to that sort of stain.

984
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:25,321
Fuck it, next round's on me.
It's on the house today.

985
01:20:26,614 --> 01:20:31,869
What did you want actually?
- Oh, doesn't matter. Well, I...

986
01:20:31,953 --> 01:20:34,997
Oh, already so late.
I have to call my little chicks.

987
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:38,334
Say good night, or else they'll keep the
whole house up blubbering. - Say hi!

988
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,711
Will do!
I'll be right back.

989
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:46,592
Do you know the redhead
from Claims Adjustment? You?

990
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:47,927
Hm?

991
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:52,849
Let me put it this way:

992
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:56,602
you saved CAPITOL's ass today.
I'd like to thank you for that!

993
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:59,397
No problem,
asses are my area of expertise.

994
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,942
I'm practically an assologist.

995
01:21:04,652 --> 01:21:08,030
We could use someone like you
at Head Office, you know?

996
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:10,324
A man people accept
cause he's one of them.

997
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:14,787
I am people, no question.
You can ask anyone: I am people!

998
01:21:16,873 --> 01:21:21,961
Ms. Berkel, everything OK?
- Trust is the way.

999
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:26,215
Gentlemen, could you
take care of the lady?

1000
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:31,220
Women in the executive suite!
What a bunch of modern bullshit!

1001
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:33,973
Crackpot idea.
The Church knows not to go along,

1002
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:36,225
and they've been around for 2,000 years.

1003
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:40,980
And after 50 years of CAPITOL
along comes a Berkel and bang.

1004
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:45,026
Bang.
- Bang. You're a character.

1005
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:52,366
The straight truth, straight talk.
You know, Mr. Stromberg,

1006
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:57,121
things here at CAPITOL
are going to be changing a lot soon.

1007
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:02,460
There's bad news for the people,
and we're looking for someone...

1008
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:10,009
who can package that well.
- That's exactly my thing!

1009
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:16,223
I'll sell snow to an Eskimo, need be.
- I bet you could.

1010
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:20,728
Yeah, you better believe it.
That's my speciality, if I say so myself.

1011
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:26,108
What would that be exactly?

1012
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:31,030
Well, we're looking for
a nice word for restructuring.

1013
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:33,699
Or a few nice words.

1014
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:39,956
What should I've done?
He was really nice to me.

1015
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:43,834
But not to me.
- Yeah, because he started it.

1016
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:46,045
You can't be serious!
- I'd also get mad...

1017
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:50,424
if someone kept spilling drinks
on my jacket. - You're unbelievable.

1018
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:53,135
What do you mean?
- That's our kid who...

1019
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:57,431
I prepared a lot for 50 years CAPITOL,
and Klaus said that I could do it.

1020
01:22:57,515 --> 01:22:59,517
Can I read it to you?
- No!

1021
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,228
Please don't.
- Wow!

1022
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:05,898
Could it be that we're in an even worse
mood at a party than at work?

1023
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:08,901
Ulf, do you have another?
- No, that's the last one.

1024
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,823
Do you have a cigarette?
- Yes, but they're not classic cigarettes.

1025
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,158
What do you mean?

1026
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,620
What's that supposed to be?

1027
01:23:23,874 --> 01:23:28,129
Well, hayseeds?
Ask me where I got the car.

1028
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:30,840
Where did you get the car?
- Very good question!

1029
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:35,970
This is the car Daddy's driving
to the executive party. - No!

1030
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:43,686
Where's that? Is Klaus there?
- Yeah, you wish. Schirmchen?

1031
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:48,274
Seriously? They're letting you drive that?
- Yeah, to the executive party!

1032
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:51,110
Do they have cigarettes? Ups, sorry!
- Get out!

1033
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:56,574
Of pure gold, from what I've heard. Ulf!
- Cool.

1034
01:23:57,450 --> 01:23:59,952
Uh!
- Careful.

1035
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,873
You want to come too?
Then pile in.

1036
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:09,420
The boy's got talent! I have to say.
- Marvin, what are you doing?

1037
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:14,341
Come on. Let's get out of here.
- This is the new Daddy-mobile. Bang!

1038
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:19,346
It's not really environmentally friendly.
- But sexy.

1039
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:41,452
Give it to me. I also have to go.
- Oh, no!

1040
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:44,163
What?
- No, now I'd...

1041
01:24:46,207 --> 01:24:48,375
Give me that.

1042
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:53,923
You still have to go?
Be quick.

1043
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,138
Ow!

1044
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,477
I think we did what we could.

1045
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:10,356
Sometimes you just can't do anything.
- Yeah.

1046
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:14,068
I once did a German class for foreigners,

1047
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:17,238
simply because I wanted
to be the best in something for once.

1048
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:21,659
But even then there was some stupid
Romanian who was better at grammar.

1049
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:23,202
No.
- Yeah.

1050
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:35,297
Hey, are you sure
we're in the right place?

1051
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:39,385
Yeah, sure, don't worry.

1052
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,804
Look what Klinkhammer gave me.

1053
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:45,182
With this, I can get in everywhere.
- And what about me?

1054
01:25:45,266 --> 01:25:48,394
You're with me.

1055
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:52,898
Wow, that's a pad!

1056
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:58,070
Oh no, I'm totally not dressed
for a place like this.

1057
01:25:58,154 --> 01:26:02,908
You don't have to be.
I couldn't care less what you have on.

1058
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:05,703
Damn!

1059
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:12,626
Watch out, it's all full of steps.

1060
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:18,340
Wow, I stick out like a sore thumb here.

1061
01:26:18,424 --> 01:26:22,178
My hair must look like
I dropped a hairdryer in the bath.

1062
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:30,019
Wait here, I'll be right back, OK?
- Yeah, I'll be here.

1063
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:33,939
I could barf confetti.
Check this out here!

1064
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:38,110
This is the bomb!
- Oh, what's going on here?

1065
01:26:38,194 --> 01:26:42,406
Oh! Stromberg, Bernd Stromberg.
Mr. Klinkhammer invited me.

1066
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:45,242
And you want to shoot
a little film now, or what?

1067
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:48,662
Oh, no, they're just, that's...
- I don't mind.

1068
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:51,248
No, they don't have to film, right?

1069
01:26:51,332 --> 01:26:56,045
I'm Helena, by the way. Come on in.
What do you want to drink?

1070
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:58,631
A warm welcome!

1071
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:05,179
This place is palatial! Yeah,
a housing project looks a bit different.

1072
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:09,767
I thought we'd wait for Jennifer.
- Oh, who's Jennifer?

1073
01:27:10,351 --> 01:27:13,812
The redhead?
- No, Jennifer, who I just came with.

1074
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:18,901
I'll bet.
- So where exactly is this party?

1075
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:22,988
Wherever you want it.
- Oh.

1076
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:37,670
Where is he? Is he in there?

1077
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,714
OK.
Man, what kind of place is this?

1078
01:27:40,798 --> 01:27:44,718
Some geezer just tried to grab my breast.

1079
01:27:46,637 --> 01:27:49,139
Er...
- Just a sec. Jennifer...

1080
01:27:49,223 --> 01:27:52,810
All of a sudden
she was sitting on my lap half naked!

1081
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:55,729
Yes, I saw that.
- Yeah, but I didn't want that at all.

1082
01:27:55,813 --> 01:28:00,109
Really, come on. Ask her yourself.
Helene! Helene?

1083
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:06,865
Hey, have you seen any more of the melons
with prosciutto? - No.

1084
01:28:06,949 --> 01:28:10,786
Yeah, Helena doesn't want to come out,
from what I can tell.

1085
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:13,831
Is this the one you were talking about?
- It's about the melons.

1086
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:17,584
What about my wife's melons? Hm?

1087
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:21,046
No, that wasn't him!

1088
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:25,009
What's going on here?
- He's going after her melons!

1089
01:28:25,092 --> 01:28:28,637
So?
- It used to be better here.

1090
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:32,182
You can't show up here with a girl!

1091
01:28:32,266 --> 01:28:34,393
Do you bring beer to a bar?

1092
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:36,603
I didn't know it was that kind of party.

1093
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:40,024
I was so glad to get rid of Berkel, and
then you come along with your typist.

1094
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:44,862
Jennifer, Ms. Schirrmann isn't just a
typist. She's a woman, a force.

1095
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:49,950
Yeah, I'm married too! What's with you?
That's got nothing to do with this here!

1096
01:28:50,326 --> 01:28:53,370
Man, I thought you were
one of us, Stromberg.

1097
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:57,791
You said it so well yourself earlier,
how did it go?

1098
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,626
No fun...?

1099
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:02,588
Without fun...
- Without fun the party's done! Yeah.

1100
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:04,340
It's the same with fucking.

1101
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:08,344
At home it's all nice Robert Schumann,
and here it's "Let Daddy do it".

1102
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:11,555
Sure, but I thought...
- So, get rid of the old lady.

1103
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,349
Fuck man, I just had...

1104
01:29:14,308 --> 01:29:19,355
Don't go and ruin the good impression
you made earlier. - Yeah, no.

1105
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:22,441
Fucking e-cigarette. Fuck.

1106
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:41,377
Yeah, for me love was always
like an angel with diarrhea.

1107
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:46,799
In theory a thing of beauty,
but in practice a load of shit.

1108
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:53,138
Except with Schirmchen.

1109
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:58,519
With Jennifer, everything is,
well, totally different.

1110
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:09,780
Sure you can't live on air and love alone,
but without it's bitter.

1111
01:30:10,781 --> 01:30:17,663
The Indians have got it good.
They believe in reincarnation.

1112
01:30:18,622 --> 01:30:22,292
There you can waste your life.
You'll just do better the next time.

1113
01:30:22,376 --> 01:30:25,546
But we've just got one chance,
we've just got one life.

1114
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:29,216
And more often than not
it's shorter than a midget.

1115
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:33,846
That was a bit of a misadventure.

1116
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:37,808
I was picturing something different.
- I thought it was nice.

1117
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:39,017
Hm?

1118
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:42,688
I've had a bit to drink,
but I thought...

1119
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:48,986
that was a very romantic gesture.
- Yeah, I should say so,

1120
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:52,573
because that Helene
had a killer pair of tits.

1121
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:54,741
Yeah, I would've liked to...

1122
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:16,972
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good.</i>

1123
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:20,058
You wouldn't have
any extra space in your bed?

1124
01:31:20,142 --> 01:31:26,356
Don't ruin everything now, OK? Sleep well.
- Sleep well.

1125
01:31:32,863 --> 01:31:37,743
Hey, Ernie, you old couch potato,
what's up?

1126
01:31:38,494 --> 01:31:42,164
Not a single one of the stars
ever set foot in an office.

1127
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:46,585
But it's clear for them, clear as a star.
- What?

1128
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:51,673
Yeah, we work our butts off so we can
afford to stay in a 4 star hotel once,

1129
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:57,804
and there are a hundred thousand millions
of stars completely free. That's crazy.

1130
01:31:57,888 --> 01:32:03,685
Although, Andromeda can't hold a candle
to this beautiful machine.

1131
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:08,023
I've lost face.
I can't even feel my face anymore.

1132
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:11,068
Otherwise, you're absolutely right.

1133
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:15,072
Evening.
- Evening. We need the keys back.

1134
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:18,033
What?
- The car keys.

1135
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:24,373
Oh, these ones, but how come? Klaus
Klinkhammer gave me these himself.

1136
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:28,085
And he told us you should give them back
as soon as you come back.

1137
01:32:28,335 --> 01:32:33,173
That's what he said.
- That's what he said. Why? OK.

1138
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:37,678
Because I wasn't
into the gang bang, or what?

1139
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:42,975
Mr. Stromberg!
- Yeah. Now wait a minute!

1140
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:47,896
I just saved CAPITOL's ass
and now I'm the ass?

1141
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,566
We want to come to an amicable solution.
- No.

1142
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:52,234
Yeah.

1143
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:56,697
We can do it the hard way.
- Uh-huh. OK then...

1144
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,829
That's upper management.

1145
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:05,080
Go fetch.

1146
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:08,875
They shake your hand, at the same time
they kick you in the shin,

1147
01:33:08,959 --> 01:33:13,463
and it all depends how big your shin
guards are. And I've got ones this big.

1148
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:16,842
Huh?

1149
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:22,889
I'll fly us home now on the bed.
Like little Peter Pan.

1150
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:24,433
Peter Pan.

1151
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:28,353
I'm not supposed to do that,
but I'm doing it now.

1152
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:33,233
Little by little floating on the bed.
- Little by little I'm turning you down.

1153
01:33:43,869 --> 01:33:47,581
<i>Mm, that's good.</i>

1154
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:54,296
<i>Mm, rice pudding from Müller!</i>
<i>And the cinnamon sauce!</i>

1155
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:59,301
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>- Mm, tastes better than my boss!</i>

1156
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:05,515
<i>Whenever you get a craving.</i>
<i>Tasty, as you can see for yourself.</i>

1157
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:09,269
<i>Stay here little guy. I'll devour you too!</i>
<i>- Try this instead!</i>

1158
01:34:09,353 --> 01:34:11,521
<i>Müller Rice Pudding! Only Müller?</i>
<i>- Or what?</i>

1159
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:30,916
Rice pudding?
- Man, get away with that stuff!

1160
01:34:35,379 --> 01:34:37,714
Berkel, is that you?

1161
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,345
I can't recommend the cheese.

1162
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:46,682
It won't just clog up your stomach,
it'll cripple your whole digestive tract.

1163
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:50,477
I don't know how you could survive
for as long as you did at CAPITOL,

1164
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,815
but with your performance yesterday,
you've shot yourself in the foot!

1165
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:56,733
Wait a minute, yeah?

1166
01:34:56,817 --> 01:34:59,736
Maybe I shot past my goal a bit,

1167
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:02,823
but there's no permanent damage done.

1168
01:35:04,658 --> 01:35:07,619
Come on, let's eat a nice
tongue sausage as a peace offering.

1169
01:35:07,703 --> 01:35:09,955
Take it away!

1170
01:35:11,373 --> 01:35:13,625
Oh, we're off to a good start again.

1171
01:35:15,085 --> 01:35:17,087
Now I've got egg on my face
before breakfast!

1172
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:20,590
Yeah, well, she threw the sausage.

1173
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:25,929
Hey, don't make such a scene, OK?
- Who are you?

1174
01:35:27,097 --> 01:35:31,268
That's Mr. Steinke,
a very good employee of mine.

1175
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:37,274
Me? I'm the one here
who's going to set you straight.

1176
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:41,903
Uh, Ulf?
- Are you a daredevil, or what?

1177
01:35:41,987 --> 01:35:43,113
Daredevil...

1178
01:35:44,448 --> 01:35:46,074
Hey! Uh...

1179
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:49,369
Ulf!

1180
01:35:49,453 --> 01:35:54,541
Man, I've got the imprint from
my wedding ring here! Do you see it?

1181
01:35:57,878 --> 01:35:59,129
Kids!

1182
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,972
Ulf, watch out!
- That's not true!

1183
01:36:14,144 --> 01:36:17,731
It's true. Sometimes you have to
push your limits.

1184
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:23,403
If your wife and your son are looking
at you like you're not a real man,

1185
01:36:23,487 --> 01:36:28,325
just some kind of pussy, that's the worst!

1186
01:36:39,336 --> 01:36:43,381
Normally you don't get into a fight.
You just write an insult on Facebook,

1187
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:48,845
but if you've also got a family,
then you can't afford to be a coward.

1188
01:36:53,099 --> 01:36:54,476
Ulf!

1189
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:00,941
Ernie, stop it!

1190
01:37:11,952 --> 01:37:13,954
Go, go, go, fast, go!

1191
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:32,681
What am I going to do with you?

1192
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:35,851
I had no idea what it was about,
but I wanted to get in there.

1193
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:39,312
Ernie hit him in the head with the salmon.

1194
01:37:39,396 --> 01:37:42,941
Sorry, Mr. Stromberg, but we were
asked to make sure...

1195
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:46,403
that you leave the hotel.
- Come again?

1196
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:50,365
Yes, I'm very sorry.
Mr. Klinkhammer sent this.

1197
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:56,746
Thank you.

1198
01:38:05,881 --> 01:38:07,883
What's that?

1199
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:16,933
Oh man.
- Let me see.

1200
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:20,186
That can't be true.
- Not with your fingers.

1201
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:21,313
What's that?

1202
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:24,149
Termination.
- Effective immediately?

1203
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:27,569
He who fires a man
creates an unemployed person,

1204
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:30,071
he who fires a woman
creates a housewife,

1205
01:38:30,155 --> 01:38:35,535
but he who fires a Bernd Stromberg
creates trouble.

1206
01:38:38,872 --> 01:38:40,582
And not a small measure of it!

1207
01:38:40,665 --> 01:38:44,544
Berthold? Bring the stool
over here, please.

1208
01:38:46,588 --> 01:38:50,216
So, most of you
have surely already heard...

1209
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,511
that CAPITOL turned me out in the cold.

1210
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:02,646
And the reason for it is simple.

1211
01:39:02,729 --> 01:39:07,317
Yesterday I was invited to join
the executives at a...

1212
01:39:07,692 --> 01:39:11,154
I'll just come out and say it,
at an orgy.

1213
01:39:14,366 --> 01:39:19,329
There was expensive wine and cheap women,
but I said no!

1214
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:21,706
I said no, not with me!

1215
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:24,626
I'm a normal employee,

1216
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:28,296
and either we all get wine and women,
or I'm not playing along.

1217
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:38,098
But the result was they threw me out.
And the worst is:

1218
01:39:38,264 --> 01:39:43,728
sooner or, uh, later you're all out.
- What?

1219
01:39:43,812 --> 01:39:49,651
Because the insurance company that we all
trust and love, our CAPITOL,

1220
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:56,783
will undergo a radical restructuring,
and we all know what that means.

1221
01:39:58,618 --> 01:40:02,455
The majority of you are going to get
sacked in the near future.

1222
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:09,671
Oh yeah, you, you and you and you
and you and you and you and you.

1223
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:17,887
The plans are all finished,
and when I heard that I said: no way!

1224
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:22,100
Yeah, that's what I said, no way.
I won't do that.

1225
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:26,229
One evening I'm handing out
certificates for years of service,

1226
01:40:26,312 --> 01:40:28,940
and the next I'm handing out
pink slips, or what?

1227
01:40:29,024 --> 01:40:30,817
Daddy doesn't do that kind of thing!

1228
01:40:39,075 --> 01:40:40,785
Yeah, that's all I had.

1229
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:44,831
So, I'm going to give these fine gentlemen
a piece of my mind,

1230
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:49,377
and if you share my opinion, come along.
- Yeah, right on.

1231
01:41:31,795 --> 01:41:35,006
The trust is gone!
The trust is gone!

1232
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:38,093
The trust is gone!
The trust is gone!

1233
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:41,638
The trust is gone!
The trust is gone!

1234
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:45,475
The trust is gone!
- Down with the management!

1235
01:41:45,558 --> 01:41:49,062
Down with the management!
Down with the management!

1236
01:41:49,145 --> 01:41:52,607
Down with the management!
Down with the management!

1237
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:56,069
Down with the management!
Down with the management!

1238
01:41:58,029 --> 01:42:03,535
Without us you'd be nowhere!
Without us you'd be nowhere!

1239
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:07,956
Without us you'd be nowhere!

1240
01:42:09,916 --> 01:42:13,211
Could you please refrain from doing that!
Are you insane?

1241
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:16,965
The colleagues would like to tell you
what they think of restructuring.

1242
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:22,095
Do think this is going to save your job?
- Just because you shoot the ram,

1243
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:26,683
it doesn't mean the sheep
will stop bleating. - What?

1244
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:28,351
Man, go home!

1245
01:42:28,434 --> 01:42:32,105
You and your sad little bunch
won't rectify anything here!

1246
01:42:32,188 --> 01:42:36,901
They said that to Jesus and his disciples.
- Here come the others!

1247
01:42:43,032 --> 01:42:46,327
Here we go!
Here we go!

1248
01:42:46,411 --> 01:42:47,996
Here we go!

1249
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:51,332
The fish stinks from the head!
The fish stinks from the head!

1250
01:42:51,666 --> 01:42:54,544
CAPITOL might reach 50,

1251
01:42:54,627 --> 01:42:58,464
but solidarity will reach 500,
or even older.

1252
01:42:58,548 --> 01:43:01,718
Solidarity is as old as humanity itself.

1253
01:43:03,469 --> 01:43:07,015
<i>Yes, we want to show</i>
<i>the fine gentlemen in there...</i>

1254
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:10,727
<i>that you can't treat people like this,</i>
<i>even during a crisis.</i>

1255
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:13,855
And...
- Is that the meaning of the symbol?

1256
01:43:14,397 --> 01:43:18,151
Oh, what?
Yes, that's right.

1257
01:43:19,194 --> 01:43:22,447
With that we want to say
"Fuck the CAPITOL!"

1258
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:26,910
<i>A company party for CAPITOL Insurance</i>
<i>in Botzenburg...</i>

1259
01:43:26,993 --> 01:43:28,828
<i>has apparently spiraled out of control...</i>

1260
01:43:28,912 --> 01:43:33,583
<i>after management's plans to cut jobs</i>
<i>in the wake of the crisis became public.</i>

1261
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:38,171
And if we're out on the street,
then on the street...

1262
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:41,424
where the people live
who threw us out on to the street!

1263
01:43:41,507 --> 01:43:46,471
Those are, as you can see,
not the worst streets!

1264
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:50,141
<i>The leader of the protest is a former</i>
<i>employee of the insurance company,</i>

1265
01:43:50,225 --> 01:43:54,229
<i>Bernd Stromberg. While CAPITOL's</i>
<i>management has yet to comment,</i>

1266
01:43:54,312 --> 01:43:56,481
<i>Stromberg has become even more vocal.</i>

1267
01:43:56,981 --> 01:43:59,108
We all are the CAPITOL!

1268
01:43:59,192 --> 01:44:05,990
Even if you don't work for CAPITOL,
and your company threw you out.

1269
01:44:06,074 --> 01:44:12,121
You too are the CAPITOL! Everyone who's
been rationalized away is the CAPITOL!

1270
01:44:12,205 --> 01:44:15,333
<i>That CAPITOL sounds like capital</i>
<i>could just be by chance,</i>

<i>Bernd Stromberg, the man</i>
<i>leading this protest movement,</i>

<i>a clear victim of unbridled capitalism.</i>

1274
01:44:24,425 --> 01:44:28,471
<i>He's the man who can give a face</i>
<i>to the protest against the corporations.</i>

We're staying here!
We're staying here!

1276
01:45:13,474 --> 01:45:20,481
<i>Our Bernd always wears a beard and tie.</i>
<i>He's got a bald patch, we can not lie.</i>

1277
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:27,780
<i>You only know what you've got here,</i>
<i>When it suddenly disapears!</i>

1278
01:45:28,281 --> 01:45:34,287
<i>Cause you, you were the CAPITOL!</i>

1279
01:45:35,788 --> 01:45:41,919
<i>More that 20 years in all.</i>

<i>And now, now you go just so.</i>

1282
01:46:12,742 --> 01:46:17,246
The reason why
the Neanderthals kept going...

1283
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:22,668
wasn't because of money and career.
No, it was for other Neanderthals.

1284
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:28,216
And that's still in all our genes
to this day.

1285
01:46:29,926 --> 01:46:32,553
And we have to get back to that.

1286
01:46:34,013 --> 01:46:39,936
We can't continue to let ourselves
get beat up by our jobs just to keep them.

1287
01:46:41,521 --> 01:46:46,067
We're running faster and faster
in the hamster wheel...

1288
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:50,196
that outfits like CAPITOL give us,
and we think we've made it...

1289
01:46:50,279 --> 01:46:53,825
if our hamster wheel is made of chrome
instead of wood.

1290
01:46:54,742 --> 01:46:58,037
I'm here to tell you no!

1291
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:04,085
Stop running!
Stop the rat race!

1292
01:47:05,753 --> 01:47:07,922
Fuck the CAPITOL!

1293
01:47:11,717 --> 01:47:15,471
<i>The anti-capitalism protests around</i>
<i>the laid-off CAPITOL employee,</i>

1294
01:47:15,555 --> 01:47:17,390
<i>Bernd Stromberg, are growing.</i>

1295
01:47:17,473 --> 01:47:21,644
<i>Bernd Stromberg has quickly established</i>
<i>himself as the new enfant terrible,</i>

1296

<i>a voice for the disadvantaged,</i>
<i>a figurehead for the losers in the crisis.</i>

We'll cut you down!

1299
01:47:33,656 --> 01:47:36,075
I think Stromberg is a good guy.

1300
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:40,079
It's high time that someone
in Germany says:

1301
01:47:40,163 --> 01:47:42,874
"Fuck the capital!"
Yeah. "Fuck the capital!"

1302
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:44,292
That brings it to a head.

1303
01:47:57,763 --> 01:48:00,725
Mr. Stromberg, was it you who said,
"The office is war"?

1304
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:05,229
"The office is war"? Yeah, I said that,
but now I'm for peace.

1305
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:09,775
Damn system, who needs them!

01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:18,075
Damn system, who needs them!
Damn system, who needs them!

1308
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:23,247
Yeah, when you reap, you have to lay the
golden egg! You can't just dawdle around.

1309
01:48:23,915 --> 01:48:26,834
And so the offer from the party
was the perfect thing.

1310
01:48:26,918 --> 01:48:30,129
Were glad to hear you want to support us.
- It's my pleasure.

1311
01:48:30,213 --> 01:48:33,674
Stromberg, you're here. How's it going?
- Good, good. Yeah.

1312
01:48:33,758 --> 01:48:35,927
Stay strong.
- Yeah.

1313
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:42,266
He's gone gray, Steinrück.
- Steinmeier!

1314
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:47,772
Here it's all about people. Not quarterly
numbers or forms or blah blah blah.

1315
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:50,441
And that's absolutely my thing.

1316
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:54,987
They need people like me here
the way an undertaker needs bodies.

1317
01:48:55,071 --> 01:48:59,659
And they're kissing my feet here!
Otherwise, they'd be fools.

1318
01:49:02,453 --> 01:49:04,038
No?

1319
01:49:05,081 --> 01:49:06,457
Hm?

1320
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:14,757
Oh, it keeps going on up. See you.

1321
01:49:16,551 --> 01:49:18,344
I'll be upstairs!

1322
01:49:26,269 --> 01:49:31,899
Yippieh! Made it.
It's just God above me now.

1323
01:49:32,984 --> 01:49:36,153
Yeah, what does that mean, peace?

1324
01:49:36,237 --> 01:49:40,366
I really don't have any time for this.
I've got to get going here.

1325
01:49:41,534 --> 01:49:43,119
Ah! Heisterkamp.

1326
01:49:44,453 --> 01:49:45,997
Hello?

1327
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:52,837
We had bad experiences with the Germans
back in Poland.

1328
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:57,508
Stromberg, he was even worse.
He was like the Russians.

1329
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,386
"What do you call a cross between
a spider and a Pole?"

1330
01:50:01,012 --> 01:50:04,890
"Eight armed maid!"
It was like that the whole time.

1331
01:50:06,851 --> 01:50:08,519
Heisterkamp.

1332
01:50:08,728 --> 01:50:12,481
Yeah, I've got nice legs.
Oh! Ulf!

1333
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:20,364
Yeah, one time I totally
didn't study for a big exam,

1334
01:50:20,448 --> 01:50:23,868
and he wrote me a cheat sheet
with all the answers on it.

1335
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:26,120
That was pretty cool.

1336
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:30,708
The answers were all wrong,
and I had to retake the exam,

1337
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:33,961
but Stromberg is really a cool dude.

1338
01:50:38,591 --> 01:50:39,675
Whoop whoop.

1339
01:50:41,218 --> 01:50:42,970
Ah...
Heisterkamp.

1340
01:50:43,804 --> 01:50:45,473
Hey! Ulf!

1341
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:50,853
Back in the day,
we could still smoke in the office.

1342
01:50:51,896 --> 01:50:53,898
Today people can hardly believe it.

1343
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:57,693
And Stromberg's the same.
Pretty soon people won't believe...

1344
01:50:57,777 --> 01:51:01,197
that something like that was possible
in a German office.

1345
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:04,700
And I'm sure there will be people
who'll be sad about that.

1346
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:11,666
No, I've got nothing to say
about my ex husband!

1347
01:51:13,209 --> 01:51:15,920
Unless he came crawling back and said:

1348
01:51:16,003 --> 01:51:20,299
"Biggi, I got so many things wrong
back then, and I'm really sorry.

1349
01:51:20,383 --> 01:51:23,219
Can you help me?"
That would be nice!

1350
01:51:23,511 --> 01:51:25,888
Then I could tell him...

1351
01:51:26,097 --> 01:51:30,184
I don't give a shit if that's on TV
or in the theaters!

1352
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:35,523
Someone like Stromberg?
Yeah, for me he's typically German.

1353
01:51:35,606 --> 01:51:40,277
That wouldn't work anywhere else.
In England, for example.

1354
01:51:43,239 --> 01:51:47,326
Before I wouldn't have dreamed
of doing that. It all comes from him.

1355
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:50,329
But maybe it's good that way, huh?

1356
01:51:56,919 --> 01:51:59,672
People like Stromberg
are like modern art for me.

1357
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:03,509
I don't get it at all.
They don't belong in the office, period.

1358
01:52:03,592 --> 01:52:06,595
You'll find them in every major company.

1359
01:52:06,679 --> 01:52:09,640
Yeah, and that's all
I have to say on the subject.

1360
01:52:13,686 --> 01:52:15,896
Actually I do more
nature documentaries and such.

1361
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:20,317
I once did a film about penguins,
and you think they look so harmless,

1362
01:52:20,401 --> 01:52:25,656
but penguins are real assholes.
They cover the whole Antarctic in shit.

1363
01:52:25,865 --> 01:52:30,119
Yeah, it's true. And Stromberg is the same
way too, in terms of his mentality.

1364
01:52:30,202 --> 01:52:34,415
Stromberg is a real office penguin.
But I'm gonna miss him.

1365
01:52:34,498 --> 01:52:38,919
In some ways he was a role model for me.
You know, the beard and stuff.

1366
01:52:39,003 --> 01:52:40,296
Bernd...

1367
01:52:45,843 --> 01:52:48,888
Here, look. Ernie, the old fruit.

1368
01:53:01,317 --> 01:53:04,278
Stromberg had bad breath, oh my God.

1369
01:53:04,987 --> 01:53:07,239
When he opened his mouth, it was...

1370
01:53:07,323 --> 01:53:12,328
like someone opened
the lid of a garbage can.

1371
01:53:12,578 --> 01:53:16,582
That he's trying to be the next
Che Guevara, forget it!

1372
01:53:16,665 --> 01:53:19,418
The guy is and always will be a hustler.

1373
01:53:19,502 --> 01:53:25,424
I wouldn't be surprised if he hustles
a pile of money with this number.

1374
01:53:34,141 --> 01:53:39,355
Hello, boss.
- Hey, what's that you got there?

1375
01:53:39,688 --> 01:53:42,441
Uh, rice pudding,
- Rice thingy?

1376
01:53:44,443 --> 01:53:47,446
Yeah, that's right, Bernd. Rice pudding.
- Mm.

1377
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:51,700
That's really something special,
I have to say, this Müller thingy...

1378
01:53:51,784 --> 01:53:55,621
Oh, rice....
- Rice pudding! Rice pudding!

1379
01:53:55,913 --> 01:54:00,835
I don't get it why everyone loves him
so much. - Hm? That's really tasty!

1380
01:54:01,293 --> 01:54:03,963
And perfect for the office.

1381
01:54:04,964 --> 01:54:08,509
Hm.
- Amazing that he's made it so far.

1382
01:54:08,592 --> 01:54:12,012
Try Müller Rice Pudding with Cinnamon!
Got to be Müller or...?

1383
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:15,307
Uh, thingy? No.

1384
01:54:17,935 --> 01:54:20,604
Yeah, I'm like a zero.

1385
01:54:22,273 --> 01:54:27,069
You always have to take me into account.
There's no way around it.

1386
01:54:27,528 --> 01:54:32,157
Depending where the zero is,
it can be very decisive.

1387
01:54:34,285 --> 01:54:37,162
If it's in front,
then it's practically worthless,

1388
01:54:37,246 --> 01:54:41,125
but if it's behind, watch out!

1389
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:46,547
And that's what it's about in the end.
Who's behind?

1390
01:54:48,757 --> 01:54:51,677
Or who gets the last laugh?

1391
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:10,154
Sometimes he did really sweet things.

1392
01:55:10,988 --> 01:55:14,199
Like the first time we got together,
he was totally drunk,

1393
01:55:14,283 --> 01:55:17,161
and he threw up all over my dog.

1394
01:55:17,369 --> 01:55:21,540
He was trying to undo his pants,
and I had an old pug...

1395
01:55:21,624 --> 01:55:24,418
who couldn't run away quick enough.

1396
01:55:24,793 --> 01:55:29,089
Well, that wasn't exactly sweet,
but it just came to me.

1397
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:52,154
Hello?

1398
01:55:53,906 --> 01:55:56,283
Jimmy Hoffa!

1399
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,565
Come on, let's go!

1400
01:56:28,649 --> 01:56:30,901
One, two, three, four...

1401
01:56:39,410 --> 01:56:42,037
So, pay attention. It's me again.

1402
01:56:42,413 --> 01:56:47,001
<i>You've fallen in the shit headfirst,</i>

1403
01:56:48,961 --> 01:56:53,590
<i>And you think everything you touch</i>
<i>is just cursed, cursed, cursed,</i>

1404
01:56:55,217 --> 01:56:58,929
<i>The colleagues are busting your balls,</i>

1405
01:57:01,015 --> 01:57:05,102
<i>Call Daddy, that's all!</i>

1406
01:57:07,813 --> 01:57:13,610
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1407
01:57:14,236 --> 01:57:19,992
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1408
01:57:20,909 --> 01:57:26,790
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1409
01:57:27,124 --> 01:57:32,880
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1410
01:57:34,006 --> 01:57:37,217
<i>Even Superman pales in comparison.</i>

1411
01:57:37,301 --> 01:57:40,471
<i>Superman, you know,</i>
<i>the fairy with the cape?</i>

1412
01:57:40,554 --> 01:57:44,141
<i>Daddy could teach him a lesson.</i>

1413
01:57:46,894 --> 01:57:50,731
<i>It doesn't matter if your life's too busy.</i>

1414
01:57:52,274 --> 01:57:56,612
<i>Call Daddy. He'll be there in a jiffy!</i>

1415
01:57:59,114 --> 01:58:04,787
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1416
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:11,502
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1417
01:58:11,877 --> 01:58:18,175
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1418
01:58:18,258 --> 01:58:24,723
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1419
01:58:31,605 --> 01:58:35,317
<i>Is your sex not up to specs,</i>

1420
01:58:38,112 --> 01:58:41,240
<i>cause your woman's not getting</i>
<i>what she expects?</i>

1421
01:58:44,535 --> 01:58:48,330
<i>You got the world's softest dick.</i>

1422
01:58:50,082 --> 01:58:54,461
<i>Call Daddy, his is like a brick!</i>

1423
01:58:56,713 --> 01:59:02,427
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1424
01:59:03,053 --> 01:59:09,393
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1425
01:59:09,476 --> 01:59:15,732
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1426
01:59:15,816 --> 01:59:22,322
<i>Let Daddy do it.</i>
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1427
01:59:22,447 --> 01:59:25,617
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1428
01:59:25,701 --> 01:59:31,832
<i>Daddy does it good!</i>

1429
01:59:32,708 --> 01:59:37,546
Daddy doesn't just do it good, but so much
better than a lot of other people think.

1430
01:59:42,759 --> 01:59:47,389
Whoa, they're totally flipping out.
That was really loud there at the end,

1431
01:59:47,472 --> 01:59:50,517
but great, now I've got tinnitus.
