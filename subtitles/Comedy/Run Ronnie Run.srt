1
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,649
We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring

2
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:42,449
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.

00:00:44,248 --> 00:00:47,960
After the game is before the game.

5
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:07,189
<i>Man...</i>

6
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:11,530
<i>... probably the most mysterlous
specles on our planet.</i>

7
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,702
<i>A mystery of unanswered questlons...</i>

8
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:19,001
<i>Who are we? Where do we come from?</i>

9
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:24,051
<i>Where are we golng? How do we
know. What we thlnk we know?</i>

10
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:28,477
<i>Why do we belleve anythlng at all?</i>

11
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:32,817
<i>Countless questlons
In search of an answer.</i>

12
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,202
<i>An answer that wlll glve
rlse to a new questlon...</i>

13
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:42,001
<i>... and the next answer wlll glve
rlse to the next questlon and so on...</i>

14
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:44,257
<i>... and so on.</i>

15
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:50,099
<i>But, In the end, Isn 't It
always the same questlon?</i>

16
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:54,858
<i>And always the same answer?</i>

17
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,493
The ball is round.
The game lasts 90 minutes.

18
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,250
That's a fact. Everything
else is pure theory.

19
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:06,840
Here we go!

20
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:15,688
RUN LOLA RUN

21
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,637
- Manni?
- Lola?

22
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,974
What's up? Where are you?

23
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:08,811
Where were you, damn it?

24
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:10,524
I got there too late.

25
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,696
But why today?
You're always on time! Always!

26
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:17,285
My moped got ripped off.
It doesn't matter.

27
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:18,455
Yes, it matters!

28
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,667
What's wrong?

29
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,674
<i>It wasn 't my fault, Mannl.
I went to get some clgarettes.</i>

30
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:27,847
<i>I can 't belleve how fast the guy was.</i>

31
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:32,521
<i>There was nothlng I could do.
He was gone before I got outslde.</i>

32
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:33,984
<i>I even took a taxl.</i>

33
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:37,489
<i>That dumb-ass drove east. They've
got a Grunewald St. There too.</i>

34
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:39,827
<i>When I notlced, It was too late.</i>

35
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:44,375
<i>I was so screwed up because
of our moped, I dldn 't reallze.</i>

36
00:05:44,462 --> 00:05:47,048
<i>- Doesn 't matter. - And when
I got there, you were gone.</i>

37
00:05:47,844 --> 00:05:50,596
<i>- It doesn 't matter now.
I'm done for. - But why?</i>

38
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:56,815
Help me, Lola! I don't know what to do.

39
00:05:57,361 --> 00:06:00,990
You weren't there, and I messed
it up. I blew it. I'm such a jerk!

40
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,456
<i>Just calm down. Now, what happened?</i>

41
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,171
<i>Just tell me what happened, okay?</i>

42
00:06:09,257 --> 00:06:11,717
Lola, he's gonna kill me. I'm gonna die.

43
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:15,392
Stop it! You're scaring me. What's up?

44
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:18,982
<i>- Dld you get caught? - No, but
that would have been somethlng.</i>

45
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:24,073
<i>Everythlng went really great. We drove
the cars there, and those guys came.</i>

46
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:27,122
<i>They pald and that was lt. Easy as ple.</i>

47
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,293
<i>I got waved across the border...</i>

48
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:33,049
<i>... and then theydropped me off out there.</i>

49
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,013
<i>I went to see that cyclops,
and he was flnlshed In no tlme.</i>

50
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,477
<i>And everythlng was on tlme,
ex cept for you.</i>

51
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,774
<i>You woeroe n't t hnoeroe</i>

52
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:47,659
- Then what?
- Nothing. Not even a phone booth.

53
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:52,624
<i>I couldn 't even call a taxl,
so I walked to the subway statlon</i>

54
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:54,923
<i>On the traln, there was thls bum...</i>

55
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:58,553
<i>... who somehow fell down. Suddenly,
these Inspectors showed up.</i>

56
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:02,268
<i>And I got out llke always.
An old reflex.</i>

57
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:14,709
The bag!

58
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:15,712
The bag!

59
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:50,441
The bag!

60
00:07:51,194 --> 00:07:54,864
I'm such a fucking amateur!
A dumb-ass!

61
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:59,538
<i>Thls could only happen to me! If you'd
plcked me up, It wouldn 't have happened.</i>

62
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:02,796
<i>I was so out of lt.
You're always on tlme!</i>

63
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:05,760
<i>- Dldn 't you call the next statlon? - Sure.</i>

64
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:09,474
<i>But It was too late. The
fucklng bag was already gone.</i>

65
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,771
<i>And that bum has lt.
That plastlc-bag freak!</i>

66
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,234
<i>He 's on a plane to Florlda or Hawall...</i>

67
00:08:15,613 --> 00:08:19,158
<i>... or Canada or Hong
Kongor Bermuda or whatever.</i>

68
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,878
<i>What about Ronnle?</i>

69
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,590
<i>- He 'll klll me. - You gotta tell hlm.</i>

70
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:27,592
<i>Forget lt!</i>

71
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:29,596
- Why? - He won't believe a single word!

72
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,893
<i>I kept a carton of clgarettes
once. He notlced rlght away.</i>

73
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:36,901
<i>He doesn 't belleve anybody.</i>

74
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,782
The job with those Mercedes
was a kind of test.

75
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:45,122
To see if he could trust me. Shit.

76
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,046
How much was there in the bag?

77
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:51,343
- 100.000
- What?

78
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,974
100.000. A test.

79
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:56,312
Shit.

80
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,525
<i>See! I knew you wouldn 't come up
wlth any Ideas. I always sald...</i>

81
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:03,616
...someday you wouldn't know what
to do. Not when you die. Sooner!

82
00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:09,332
<i>You said, ''Love can do everything.''
So find 100.000 marks in 20 minutes!</i>

83
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:15,761
At 12 by the water tower around
the corner, Ronnie said. In 20 minutes.

84
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,224
Run away, Manni!

85
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:18,603
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

86
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:21,899
Nobody escapes Ronnie.

87
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:23,110
I'll go with you.

88
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,782
When Ronnie gets here in 20 minutes
I'll be a goner.

89
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:28,119
- Stop it, Manni!
- What for?

90
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:31,249
You can't get me 100 grand either!

91
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:35,380
He'll rub me out, and all that's
left of me will be 100.000 ashes...

92
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:40,347
...floating down the Spree to the sea.
No more Manni! You can't do a thing!

93
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:42,186
Shut up!

94
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:53,040
Listen.

95
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:58,130
Wait for me. I'll help you. Stay put,
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

96
00:09:58,217 --> 00:10:00,511
<i>- Okay?
- You gonna pawn all your jewelry?</i>

97
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:01,431
Where are you?

98
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:06,395
In a phone booth downtown
in front of the Spiral Bar.

99
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,986
Okay, stay where you are.
I'll come up withsomething.

100
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:11,699
In 20 minutes, okay?

101
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:16,331
What the hell. I'll go over to
Bolleand get that 100 grand.

102
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,335
C ut it out!

103
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,756
Ronnie said they make 200 grand a day
so they must have 100 grand by noon.

104
00:10:22,177 --> 00:10:25,764
<i>You're nuts! Don 't do a thlng!
Just stay In that damned booth!</i>

105
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:28,812
- That's it. I'll rob the store.
- Have you lost it?

106
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:31,608
Don't do a thing! Stay put, I'm coming!

107
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:33,114
Then what?

108
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,700
I'll think of something!

109
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:37,953
In 20 minutes I'll be dead
unless I steal the money!

110
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:40,001
- No, wait!
- What for?

111
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:42,921
I'll get the money somehow.

112
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:48,098
I'm going there at 12
if you aren't here.

113
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,777
Okay. Who?

114
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:19,281
Who?

115
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:56,724
Dad!

116
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:07,785
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo!

117
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:14,046
Of course, I knew that
Sagittariuswas your ascendant.

118
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:19,095
Sure, the more I think about it.
I don't know.

119
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:23,229
Yes, but you're married too.

120
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,960
Watch where you're going!

121
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,302
Bitch!

122
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:32,842
It's worst at night.

123
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:36,389
I wake up and can't fall asleep again.

124
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,853
And then I'm afraid.

125
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:42,066
Me! Afraid of the dark!

126
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:47,032
I've never been afraid of the dark.
I've never even been afraid before.

127
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:50,708
But I think about us...

128
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,886
...and I just think
it'll keep going on like this.

129
00:14:58,348 --> 00:15:00,559
That you wouldn't dare...

130
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:13,373
And then I ask myself
what I'm doing here.

131
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:18,714
How long will this go on?
The secrecy, all this damned lying?

132
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:24,225
Should I grow old, waiting for a man
who won't stand by me?

133
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,175
Hey, you need a bike?

134
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:08,014
50 marks, as good as new.

135
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:10,144
No!

136
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:14,194
AND THEN

137
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:03,992
Hey man! I know that!

138
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:07,164
It's not my fault it's so much money!

139
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:15,345
500? What am I supposed to do
with 500 marks?

140
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:32,628
Thanks.

141
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:45,736
Your phone card!

142
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:09,778
I have to go. Meyer will be
here in a minute.

143
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:16,374
Ca n we nm eet ate r on?

144
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,048
- Do you love me?
- What?

145
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:22,344
Do you love me?

146
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:25,015
Why are you asking me now?

147
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:27,186
Do you love me?

148
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:29,899
Yes, damn it!

149
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:31,945
Then decide.

150
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:34,532
Not now.

151
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:37,205
You have to decide sometime.

152
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:40,250
But why now, here, at once?

153
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:48,433
Because I'm pregnant.

154
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:00,120
Look who's here!

155
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,377
Our little princess, Lola!
What a rare pleasure.

156
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:07,426
- Why the rush?
- Please, let me in.

157
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:11,724
Little Miss wants to see Big Daddy?
Sure thing.

158
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:24,542
Sorry.

159
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:28,466
AND THEN

160
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:40,484
Tell me, do you want to
have a baby with me?

161
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:46,122
Yes.

162
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:51,340
Lola?

163
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:52,759
Dad.

164
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:54,846
Your daughter?

165
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,319
I'm Jutta Hansen
from the board of directors.

166
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:08,995
- Sorry to interrupt. It's urgent.
- It's okay. I was just about to...

167
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,628
What are you doing here?

168
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:14,007
What are you doing here?

169
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:19,808
Nothing.

170
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:29,451
Listen...

171
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:33,081
...if I told you I needed your help...

172
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:37,755
...more than I ever have before and
you're the only one who can help me...

173
00:20:38,175 --> 00:20:39,927
...would you help me?
- You look terrible.

174
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:41,849
- Would you help me?
- What happened?

175
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,769
I can't explain now.
Would you help me?

176
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:45,940
With what, damn it?!

177
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:49,279
I need 100.000 marks immediately.

178
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:50,614
What?

179
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:54,494
I need it within
the next five minutes or else...

180
00:20:54,915 --> 00:20:57,167
- Or else what?
- Something terrible will happen!

181
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:00,549
I don't understand.
What's going on here today?

182
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,804
Please, Dad! You've got to help me! Please!

183
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:06,934
- I don't have 100.000 marks.
- What about my life insurance?

184
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:10,149
What about it?
It isn't worth 100.000

185
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,738
Please, Dad, I'm serious.
This isn't a joke!

186
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:16,536
Yes, it is, Lola!
You can't be serious!

187
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:19,332
- If you don't help me, he'll die!
- Who'll die?

188
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:21,838
- Manni!
- Manni? Who's Manni?

189
00:21:22,257 --> 00:21:24,008
My boyfriend, for over a year!

190
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:26,388
I don't even know him.
Why will he die?

191
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:27,891
It doesn't matter!

192
00:21:35,906 --> 00:21:38,617
Okay. Come with me.

193
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:49,806
- You're going to help me?
- Of course.

194
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,686
Go home and go to bed.

195
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:58,110
And tell your mother I won't be
home today or tomorrow or ever again.

196
00:21:58,197 --> 00:22:02,117
I'm leaving you guys
and I'm marrying another woman.

197
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:07,418
We're going to have kids. I'll try to be
happy because she only wants me.

198
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:10,842
<i>I'm so sick of hearing
''All you do is work.''</i>

199
00:22:11,304 --> 00:22:12,847
<i>''You always play the boss!''</i>

200
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:16,602
Maybe I do, but so what!
You guys have no idea!

201
00:22:17,023 --> 00:22:20,401
I'm so tired of being
blamed for everything!

202
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:24,200
Sure, Daddy's money is good enough
right? Well, not anymore!

203
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:25,413
Not anymore.

204
00:22:28,753 --> 00:22:32,256
Besides, I'd never have
fathered a freak like you.

205
00:22:32,676 --> 00:22:35,179
- But you did, you jerk!
- No, I didn't!

206
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:40,606
You're not mine.

207
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,123
Now you know.

208
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:55,633
The guy who sired you left
before you were even born.

209
00:22:58,224 --> 00:22:58,474
Throw her out, please.

210
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:03,774
Conm e on! Get h e r out of h e re!

211
00:23:37,211 --> 00:23:39,463
Well, we all have our bad days.

212
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,057
See you around.

213
00:23:57,457 --> 00:23:58,750
My dear.

214
00:23:59,377 --> 00:24:00,503
What's wrong?

215
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,175
Do you have the time?

216
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:47,255
This afternoon?

217
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:51,053
All right.

218
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:53,808
No, forget it. It's okay.

219
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:55,937
Yeah.

220
00:26:29,693 --> 00:26:30,777
<i>Walt!</i>

221
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:33,448
<i>Don 't do lt!</i>

222
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:35,744
<i>Mannl, please!</i>

223
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:36,579
<i>Walt!</i>

224
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,835
<i>Walt for me!</i>

225
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:42,506
<i>I'll be rlght there.</i>

226
00:26:43,175 --> 00:26:44,301
<i>Please.</i>

227
00:26:45,263 --> 00:26:46,681
<i>Mannl, please...</i>

228
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,102
<i>... walt!</i>

229
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:37,605
Lie down on the floor. On the floor!

230
00:27:38,235 --> 00:27:39,611
Lie down on the floor.

231
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,625
Hands behind your head, and keep quiet!

232
00:27:49,046 --> 00:27:49,630
Hands behind your head, and keep quiet!

233
00:27:50,965 --> 00:27:51,841
Open the registers!

234
00:27:52,552 --> 00:27:55,388
Open all the cash registers!
Open them!

235
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,396
Open them, and lie down!

236
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:02,861
I'll shoot anyone who bugs me!

237
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:06,200
I'll shoot anyone who bugs me!

238
00:28:12,297 --> 00:28:13,673
Lola, where were you?

239
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:15,843
I couldn't get here faster.

240
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:17,513
Will you help me?

241
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:19,642
Can't we just get out of here?

242
00:28:20,604 --> 00:28:22,481
Not anymore. You see the shit I'm in.

243
00:28:24,652 --> 00:28:26,613
Why didn't you wait for me?

244
00:28:27,032 --> 00:28:29,159
I did. You got here too late.

245
00:28:30,746 --> 00:28:32,164
So, are you with me?

246
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:35,085
Put your hands up! Hurry up!

247
00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:41,140
Conm e on!

248
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:46,608
Drop your gun!

249
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:48,320
Hurry up!

250
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:55,876
Don't move.

251
00:28:57,379 --> 00:28:58,547
The safety is on.

252
00:28:59,214 --> 00:29:01,383
- How does it work?
- The little lever on the side.

253
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:05,140
Kid, you don't know how to use...

254
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:09,984
Don't move.

255
00:29:13,743 --> 00:29:14,910
Conm e h e re

256
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:22,005
Cover me. I'll grab the cash.

257
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:37,616
Hurry, before the cops come.

258
00:30:31,258 --> 00:30:32,342
Don't move!

259
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:09,853
Do you love me?

260
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:14,278
Sure, I do.

261
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,621
How can you be sure?

262
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:24,295
I don't know. I just am.

263
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:27,343
I could be some other girl.

264
00:32:30,351 --> 00:32:31,644
Why not?

265
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:36,610
- Because you're the best.
- The best what?

266
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,573
The best girl.

267
00:32:40,243 --> 00:32:41,870
In the whole world?

268
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:44,334
Sure.

269
00:32:45,503 --> 00:32:46,045
How do you know?

270
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,177
I just know.

271
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,683
You think so.

272
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:57,649
Okay, I think so.

273
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:00,571
- You see?
- What?

274
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:02,367
You aren't sure.

275
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:05,913
Are you nuts, or what?

276
00:33:11,842 --> 00:33:14,136
What if you never met me?

277
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:17,226
What do you mean?

278
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:22,234
You'd be saying the same
thing to someone else.

279
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,365
- Okay, if you don't want to hear it...
- I don't want to hear anything.

280
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:27,954
I want to know how you feel.

281
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:30,042
Okay.

282
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,504
My feelings say...

283
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:36,094
...you're the best.

284
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,559
<i>Your feelings?
Who is ''your feelings'' anyway?</i>

285
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,314
It's me.

286
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:46,489
My heart.

287
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:49,284
<i>Your heart says
'' Hi, Manni. She's the one. ''</i>

288
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,956
Exactly.

289
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,670
<i>And you say, '' Thanks for the info.
Talk to you soon. ''</i>

290
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,091
Exactly.

291
00:33:58,511 --> 00:34:00,889
And you do whatever your heart says?

292
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:04,102
<i>Well, it doesn't really ''say'' anything.</i>

293
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:05,899
I don't know...

294
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,446
...it just feels.

295
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:12,201
So what does it feel now?

296
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:15,707
That someone's asking
rather stupid questions.

297
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:19,088
You aren't taking me seriously.

298
00:34:19,507 --> 00:34:21,176
Lola, what's wrong?

299
00:34:22,346 --> 00:34:24,056
Do you want to...

300
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:26,311
...leave me?

301
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,527
I don't know.

302
00:34:35,245 --> 00:34:37,622
I think I have to make a decision.

303
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:51,607
But I don't want to...

304
00:34:52,944 --> 00:34:54,529
I don't want to leave.

305
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:02,627
Stop!

306
00:35:09,391 --> 00:35:12,269
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

307
00:35:14,985 --> 00:35:18,113
Of course, I knew that
Sagittariuswas your ascendant.

308
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,536
Sure, the more I think about it.
I don't know.

309
00:35:24,543 --> 00:35:26,878
Yes, but you're married too.

310
00:36:34,964 --> 00:36:35,756
Excuse me!

311
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:38,051
Watch it, you stupid cow!

312
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,432
Fucking bitch!

313
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:42,811
AND THEN

314
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,478
Hey, you need a bike?

315
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:53,607
No.

316
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,276
- 50 marks, as good as new.
- But it's stolen!

317
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:13,349
500? What am I supposed to do
with 500 marks?

318
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:55,593
Tell me, do you want to
have a baby with me?

319
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,356
Yes.

320
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:15,421
Even if it isn't yours?

321
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:23,269
Look who's here! Lola, our...

322
00:39:23,688 --> 00:39:24,898
I'm in a hurry, please!

323
00:39:27,153 --> 00:39:28,237
Please let me in!

324
00:39:28,655 --> 00:39:31,700
Courtesy and composureare
the queen's jewels.

325
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,121
Let me in, please.

326
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:36,208
A little anger is good for the heart...

327
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:39,130
...the circulation, the skin.

328
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:04,052
What kind of love is that?!

329
00:40:04,554 --> 00:40:07,640
- If you hadn't neglected me...
- I have a family!

330
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:12,189
I can't leave a sick wife and three
kids just to please her highness.

331
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,404
Your wife is drunk
from morning to night!

332
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:16,199
So what!

333
00:40:16,284 --> 00:40:17,076
What do you know?

334
00:40:17,953 --> 00:40:20,163
Can't you see you're interrupting?

335
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,300
Hi, Dad.

336
00:40:27,263 --> 00:40:28,806
Why didn't you knock?

337
00:40:30,476 --> 00:40:31,769
What's going on?

338
00:40:32,187 --> 00:40:33,063
What do you want?

339
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:35,234
Is she your daughter?

340
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:36,863
Shut the door.

341
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:43,625
What do you want?

342
00:40:44,085 --> 00:40:45,003
I need your help.

343
00:40:46,256 --> 00:40:48,758
- You see that I'm busy.
- There's no other way.

344
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:52,304
Damn it! Why did you
have to show up here now?!

345
00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:54,686
I have a problem.
Do you understand?

346
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:00,029
Who's that slut?

347
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:01,573
That's none of your business!

348
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:13,010
Lola, leave.

349
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,514
Go home.

350
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:16,892
Leave me alone.

351
00:41:17,854 --> 00:41:18,981
I can't!

352
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:20,359
Why not?

353
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:22,655
I need money.

354
00:41:24,117 --> 00:41:25,493
Then get a job.

355
00:41:25,577 --> 00:41:28,580
I will, but I need the money now!

356
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:33,505
Okay, just so you get out of here.
How much?

357
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:36,010
No, I need lots more.

358
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:37,514
<i>What do you mean, ''lots more''?</i>

359
00:41:38,183 --> 00:41:40,060
A whole lot more!

360
00:41:40,729 --> 00:41:44,733
Aren't you ashamed barging in like
this? Can't you see we're busy?

361
00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:46,989
I don't give a shit, you stupid cow!
I have other problems.

362
00:41:49,872 --> 00:41:50,998
Don't you dare...

363
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:21,595
What?

364
00:42:39,128 --> 00:42:41,881
What's going on?

365
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:46,096
It just isn't your day today.
Doesn't matter.

366
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,518
You can't have everything.

367
00:43:26,422 --> 00:43:27,882
You're coming with me.

368
00:43:30,262 --> 00:43:31,889
Have you lost your mind?

369
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:35,770
- You think you can do anything you like?
- Shut up! You go first.

370
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:37,525
Kid...

371
00:43:38,527 --> 00:43:40,905
...you don't know how to
use that thing.

372
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:44,662
Let me make a suggestion.

373
00:44:07,247 --> 00:44:08,373
Stay back.

374
00:44:12,131 --> 00:44:14,216
- Listen, we can talk this over.
- Fuck off!

375
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:19,603
AND THEN

376
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:29,454
Shit!

377
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:31,080
The combination.

378
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:36,341
Quiet!

379
00:44:42,686 --> 00:44:44,896
What the heck are you doing?

380
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:11,862
Lola, there are cameras everywhere.
You'll never get out of here.

381
00:45:12,574 --> 00:45:14,325
The police will be here in a second.

382
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,248
You said they always come too late.

383
00:45:18,209 --> 00:45:20,670
Bag it. 100.000

384
00:45:31,275 --> 00:45:32,776
Come on, kid.

385
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:36,116
Leave your daddy alone.

386
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,870
You don't want to
hurt anyone, do you?

387
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:41,292
I don't know.

388
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:00,744
- I don't have it.
- Why not?

389
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:04,418
There's only 88.000

390
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,050
I'll have to get the
rest from downstairs.

391
00:46:10,973 --> 00:46:12,015
Okay, get going!

392
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,271
Go, go!

393
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,233
Hurry up, man!

394
00:47:14,923 --> 00:47:16,257
100.000

395
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:21,141
In there.

396
00:47:49,736 --> 00:47:50,862
Bye, Dad.

397
00:48:12,194 --> 00:48:13,070
I don't believe it.

398
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,489
You want to get killed, kid?

399
00:48:43,376 --> 00:48:46,880
Attention! This is the police!

400
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,761
The building is surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.

401
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:54,644
What a ruckus!

402
00:48:55,063 --> 00:48:55,981
Do you have the time?

403
00:49:29,294 --> 00:49:30,920
Get out of the way!

404
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:34,676
Give me a lift, will you?

405
00:49:35,095 --> 00:49:37,598
- Are you nuts?
- Wait!

406
00:50:44,638 --> 00:50:47,391
<i>Walt, Mannl! I'm comlng.</i>

407
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,104
<i>I'm almost there...</i>

408
00:50:49,606 --> 00:50:50,691
<i>Walt!</i>

409
00:50:52,945 --> 00:50:55,698
<i>I'm gonna make lt!</i>

410
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,634
What would you do if I died?

411
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,056
- I wouldn't let you die.
- Yeah, but...

412
00:53:04,477 --> 00:53:06,896
...what if I were fatally ill?

413
00:53:07,316 --> 00:53:09,443
- I'd find a way.
- What if I were in a coma...

414
00:53:09,862 --> 00:53:12,656
<i>...and the doctor said
''One more day''?</i>

415
00:53:13,077 --> 00:53:15,329
I'd throw you into the ocean.
Shock therapy.

416
00:53:15,748 --> 00:53:17,833
Okay, but what if I died anyway?

417
00:53:21,008 --> 00:53:23,135
- What do you want to hear?
- Come on, tell me.

418
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:27,266
I'd go to the isle of Rügen
and cast your ashes to the wind.

419
00:53:27,352 --> 00:53:27,852
And then?

420
00:53:30,316 --> 00:53:32,526
I don't know. It's a stupid question.

421
00:53:32,945 --> 00:53:34,489
I know what you'd do.

422
00:53:35,742 --> 00:53:37,952
- You'd forget me.
- No!

423
00:53:38,372 --> 00:53:41,167
Sure, you would.
What else could you do?

424
00:53:42,255 --> 00:53:44,549
Sure, you'd mourn for a few weeks.

425
00:53:44,968 --> 00:53:49,014
It wouldn't be so bad.
Everybody's real compassionate.

426
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:53,898
And everything's so incredibly sad,
and everyone feels sorry for you.

427
00:53:55,195 --> 00:53:57,488
You can show everyonehow strong you are.

428
00:53:57,908 --> 00:54:00,035
<i>''What a great woman, '' they'll say.</i>

429
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,457
<i>''She's pulling herself together
instead of crying all day. ''</i>

430
00:54:05,797 --> 00:54:09,050
And suddenly, this really nice
guy with green eyes shows up.

431
00:54:09,471 --> 00:54:12,223
And he's super sensitive
and listens to you all day.

432
00:54:12,643 --> 00:54:14,687
And you can talk his ear off.

433
00:54:15,524 --> 00:54:18,152
And you can tell him how tough
things are for you...

434
00:54:18,571 --> 00:54:23,325
...that you have to look after yourself
and you don't know what'll happen...

435
00:54:25,834 --> 00:54:29,713
Then you'd hop onto his lap and cross me
off your list. That's how it goes.

436
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:34,015
What?

437
00:54:34,433 --> 00:54:36,268
You're not dead yet.

438
00:54:46,747 --> 00:54:47,748
No?

439
00:55:03,361 --> 00:55:06,114
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

440
00:55:08,955 --> 00:55:11,165
Of course, I knew that
Sagittariuswas your ascendant.

441
00:55:12,419 --> 00:55:17,382
Sure, the more I think about it.
I don't know.

442
00:55:18,513 --> 00:55:21,015
Yes, but you're married too.

443
00:56:12,027 --> 00:56:12,903
AND THEN

444
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:15,557
- Watch out!
- Sorry.

445
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:17,646
I bet you're sorry!

446
00:57:37,642 --> 00:57:39,227
Fries and a sausage.

447
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:40,438
Give me another one.

448
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:47,618
I'll be damned.

449
00:57:48,621 --> 00:57:50,581
Life's really crazy
sometimes isn't it?

450
00:57:53,922 --> 00:57:56,007
Come on, kid.
I'll buy you a drink.

451
00:57:59,389 --> 00:58:00,265
You need a bike?

452
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,815
A special price. 70 marks.

453
00:58:23,809 --> 00:58:24,769
Mr. Meyer?

454
00:58:25,187 --> 00:58:26,980
Is everything okay?

455
00:58:56,786 --> 00:59:00,290
Tell me, do you want to
have a baby with me?

456
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:05,092
Yes.

457
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,603
<i>Mr. Meyer Is here.</i>

458
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,066
- There's something else.
- Not now.

459
00:59:14,485 --> 00:59:16,821
<i>Mr. Meyer asked If he should
parkor If you're comlng out?</i>

460
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,616
I'm coming.

461
00:59:19,286 --> 00:59:22,039
This is the nicest present
you could give me.

462
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:30,346
I'll see you later?

463
00:59:47,003 --> 00:59:48,129
Hi there.

464
00:59:55,561 --> 00:59:57,354
- Hi there, Ms. Jäger.
- Hello.

465
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,949
- Nice to see you.
- Hello, Mr. Meyer.

466
01:01:05,855 --> 01:01:07,732
Wait!

467
01:01:09,654 --> 01:01:13,908
You know what?
I just had a strange encounter.

468
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:15,372
Yes, with your daughter!

469
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:18,627
- With whom?
- Your daughter.

470
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:24,763
Shit! Shit!

471
01:01:40,627 --> 01:01:41,503
You've come at last, dear.

472
01:02:12,686 --> 01:02:13,687
Thanks.

473
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:15,314
Wait.

474
01:02:44,118 --> 01:02:46,579
So I decided, it'd be best
for me not to have kids.

475
01:02:46,998 --> 01:02:49,250
I work so muchthat
they'd never see me.

476
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:55,639
Watch out!

477

What happened to you?

521

01:15:32,937 --> 01:15:35,648
Don't worry. Everything's okay.
Come on.
