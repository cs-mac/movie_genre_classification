1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,840
My name is Bridget.

2
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,216
<i>I witnessed a murder.</i>

3
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:10,761
Just get up on the stand,
tell the judge what you saw.

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:11,845
And we'll protect you.

5
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,306
<i>I know Jimmy's got my back.</i>

6
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,172
<i>I thought I'd be safe.
Turns out I was wrong.</i>

7
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:18,310
<i>You testify against him
tomorrow, you're dead.</i>

8
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,426
You can't trust the feds.
I can trust you?

9
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:22,773
I'm not asking you to trust me,
I'm asking you to run.

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,150
Bridget: <i>I ran to
my sister Siobhan for help.</i>

11
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,335
<i>Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.</i>

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,115
It was so easy. I saw a way out
and I took it.

13
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,826
I'm in labor. I need to
get to the hospital.

14
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:36,954
You did great.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,498
Siobhan, the girls are so beautiful.

16
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,083
You asked to see me?
Yeah.

17
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,439
I want a paternity test.

00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:51,497

27
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,078
Thank you.

28
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,021
Your union has withstood
more than its fair share

29
00:01:22,146 --> 00:01:24,624
of trials and tribulations...

30
00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:29,151
And yet, here you stand today,
more in love than ever.

31
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,425
Hey.

32
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,801
Oh, thanks.

33
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:40,456
I, Andrew Martin,
pledge myself to you.

34
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:43,526
I promise to love,

35
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:46,231
honor, and cherish you.

36
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:50,944
I...

37
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,157
Siobhan Martin...

38
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:00,120
Pledge myself to you.

39
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,956
I promise to honor,

40
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:06,460
and love and cherish you.

41
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:11,465
(Applause)

42
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:26,813
(Mellow jazz playing)

43
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:29,441
- Break it up, you two. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

44
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,090
Thank you for all your help.

45
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:32,714
Thank you.

46
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:50,170
(Gasps)

47
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:07,259
I can't believe I
finally got my one-year chip.

48
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:09,167
Felt like it took 20.

49
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,918
I-I wouldn't have gotten this
without my sponsor Malcolm.

50
00:03:16,043 --> 00:03:18,260
And this is because of him.

51
00:03:20,263 --> 00:03:22,691
When I was using, I didn't

52
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:25,444
care about anything.

53
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,917
And I didn't mean anything to anyone.

54
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,736
In the last seven months,
I really learned to

55
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:36,405
let people in.

56
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,891
And they'd let me in.

57
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:41,276
Feels good to say that...

58
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,746
Life is good.
(Chuckles)

59
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:47,199
And I'm walking down
the aisle in less than a week.

60
00:03:47,324 --> 00:03:49,001
Technically, it's a vow renewal.

61
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:53,172
But it feels like the first time.

62
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:56,069
Just my husband and my stepdaughter

63
00:03:56,235 --> 00:04:01,113
in, uh, Turks and Caicos.
(Chuckles)

64
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:04,433
But before I do, I...

65
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:06,435
I have to tell them my secret.

66
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,136
Just remember...

67
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,773
When you come clean, you stay clean.

68
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:14,650
Which is why I am going
to tell them tonight.

69
00:04:16,263 --> 00:04:18,447
I'm finally going to tell my family

70
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:21,540
who I really am.

71
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:30,664
<font color="#3399FF">Sync and correction by Mlmlte</font>
<font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

72
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:35,149
Do you have any idea
what you stand to lose?

73
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:37,544
My family.

74
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:38,737
My sobriety.

75
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,947
Your life.

76
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:42,866
You're finally safe as Siobhan.

77
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,248
Don't get me wrong,
I think it's great

78
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:47,078
that you want to be honest but...

79
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:50,665
But outing yourself as Bridget
Kelly isn't the smartest move.

80
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:53,673
Bodaway wants her dead,
not Siobhan Martin.

81
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:54,878
I know what the risks are.

82
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,325
But they don't outweigh the damage

83
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,828
that I am doing to
the two people that I love.

84
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:00,847
I made up my mind.

85
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:03,261
I can't walk down that aisle
until I tell them.

86
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:04,467
Do you really think there's gonna be

87
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:07,176
an aisle to walk down,
once you tell Andrew?

88
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:11,102
I don't know.

89
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,318
(Sighs) I never knew it would be
this hard to sign my name.

90
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,018
I don't know how to thank you, Tim.

91
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:24,521
This buy out is
saving martin/ Charles.

92
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:26,826
I'm a businessman, Andrew.
Not a Saint.

93
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:29,579
My advisors are calling it
a tax write-off.

94
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:34,097
Well, regardless of
your intentions...

95
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:35,919
I'm indebted to you.

96
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,963
Damn right you are.

97
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,175
Tim, it's nice to see you.

98
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:44,511
Lovely to see you too.

99
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,596
Am I interrupting?
I can go.

100
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:49,641
Not at all. We were just,
uh, finishing up.

101
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,514
Is everything all right?

102
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,765
Yeah... yeah I, um,

103
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,521
I wanted to make sure you'd be
home for dinner tonight.

104
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,731
I'm going to cook.
Really? What's the occasion?

105
00:05:58,362 --> 00:05:59,322
No occasion.

106
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:00,318
Just 'cause.

107
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:01,903
Isn't that sweet?

108
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,531
Uh, did I mention
we're renewing our vows?

109
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:09,286
I know you were sleeping
with Siobhan Martin.

110
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,284
I'm going to destroy you.

111
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:14,541
I will make you and Siobhan
pay for what you did.

112
00:06:16,496 --> 00:06:18,920
Congratulations to you both.

113
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:20,714
I should get going.

114
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:25,971
Take care, Siobhan.
You too, Tim.

115
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,390
I think Mr. Arbogast
might be a little more apropos,

116
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,808
seeing that he's my boss.

117
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,642
Andrew, I know that
this is less than ideal, but...

118
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,026
It's better than
the alternative, I know.

119
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:38,695
This way, he's saving my investors

120
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,931
from financial ruin and me from jail.

121
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:45,447
No offense, but I don't think
you would fare too well in jail.

122
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,158
(Chuckles)
And besides,

123
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,456
I couldn't stand to be away
from you for that long.

124
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:52,375
Conjugal visits would not cut it.

125
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,460
(Chuckles)

126
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:57,000
You know, I'm so grateful to
be given an second chance.

127
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,383
Sometimes I feel I don't deserve it.

128
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:04,716
Everyone deserves
a second chance, right?

129
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,477
Hey.

130
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,016
What did the doctor say?

131
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:19,252
We're doing beautifully; They'll
be ready to leave next week.

132
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:21,149
I mean, we got to
sign this first, though.

133
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,444
Which means the girls are
finally ready for some names.

134
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,026
You settle on any?

135
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:28,531
Portia and Regan.

136
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:30,496
(Laughs) Come on, Siobhan.

137
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:32,031
I was thinking more
"Franny and Zooey,"

138
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:33,954
little less Shakespearean tragedy.

139
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,871
Uh...

140
00:07:38,996 --> 00:07:41,024
Look, I gotta go pick
the boys up from school.

141
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:43,963
But, before I go, I wanted to
talk to you about something.

142
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,715
I want to move to Chicago.

143
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:48,093
You said you were ready to leave.

144
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,166
You said that we could take
the money you stole

145
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,168
from martin/Charles
and go anywhere I want.

146
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:55,725
And I want to go to Chicago
to be close to my family.

147
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:57,811
Sounds like you've
already made up your mind.

148
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,942
Look, I'm just,

149
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,979
I'm just done with all of this.

150
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:07,233
The lies, the scheming,
I need to get away from it all.

151
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:10,870
Henry, I have two little girls
in intensive care.

152
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:13,289
The only thing that I've done
is lose sleep.

153
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:15,662
- There's no scheming on my end.
- But the fact is,

154
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,043
you still hate your sister.

155
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:19,528
And you said that you'd be
willing to give up on revenge

156
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:22,127
if it meant losing me. But I
have a hard time believing that.

157
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:26,419
You wanted Andrew to kill Bridget,

158
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:27,754
thinking that she was you.

159
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,339
But you were wrong about Andrew.

160
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:31,140
He didn't want you dead, so...

161
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:33,382
What if you were wrong about Bridget?

162
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:37,267
I mean, is she really
to blame for Sean?

163
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,353
You've got to start giving
people the benefit of the doubt.

164
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,151
I've got my boys back.

165
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:45,188
And the only thing that is
keeping me in New York is you.

166
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:47,890
And the only thing that's
keeping you here

167
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:51,260
is your vendetta
against Bridget, so...

168
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:54,030
Sweetheart, if we
are going to move on,

169
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:56,453
you gotta move on.

170
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:02,333
Machado: <i>Agent Wiegler,
you wanted to see me?</i>

171
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:05,378
Wiegler: Thanks to that hard
work you did in New York,

172
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,005
you're back on active duty.

173
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,424
But it comes with a condition.

174
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,132
Vic, you're too good an agent to
be suspended again.

175
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:14,934
So, effective immediately,

176
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:17,056
you're off the
Bodaway Macawi case, for good.

177
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,521
No offense, Royce.

178
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:20,473
I made a promise to
put Bodaway behind bars.

179
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:22,812
- If I just had a little more time...
- I'm sorry, but

180
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:25,315
did I give the impression that
this was up for discussion?

181
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,631
Look, we've tried doing it your way.

182
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:30,116
I made allowances because I know

183
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:31,651
your connection with the victim.

184
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:33,156
I reassigned you under Torrance,

185
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,204
hoping that he was gonna
reign you in.

186
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:37,243
We both know how that ended,
now, don't we?

187
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:39,492
You almost got arrested, Vic.

188
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:41,610
Now you have a choice:

189
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:44,964
Starting today, either you sever
all ties to Bodaway Macawi...

190
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:47,337
Or find yourself another job.

191
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:57,975
Jimmy:
Hi, Siobhan.

192
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:02,936
Bet you thought you'd
never see me again.

193
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,071
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

194
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:16,616
Oh, I'm not here to hurt you.

195
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,176
Really?

196
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,678
'Cause last I heard, you were serving

197
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,120
a life sentence for murder.

198
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:24,541
Yeah, well, Christmas came early.

199
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,127
What do you want from me?

200
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:29,804
Well, it's not what I want,

201
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,464
it's what Bodaway wants.

202
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:36,995
Well, I'm sorry, but I can't
help you with that.

203
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,580
I don't know where Bridget is.

204
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,582
The last I heard
from her was September.

205
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:44,152
To tell you the truth, I don't
give a rat's ass where she is.

206
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,620
The plan's changed.

207
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,564
I'm sick of being Bodaway's bitch.

208
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,316
So, why are you coming to me?

209
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:53,161
'Cause you're going to pay me,

210
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,988
just like last time.

211
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,124
... Eventually acquitted of the
murder of his younger brother...

212
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,677
Hey.

213
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:13,365
Can I get a whiskey
and a beer, please?

214
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,185
This Bodaway trial's all
this town's talking about, huh?

215
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,653
Name is John, by the way.

216
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,955
I'm not from here, obviously.

217
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,574
Thank you.

218
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:24,976
You know where a guy
can get a good steak?

219
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,911
This ain't <i>Brokeback Mountain,</i> pal.

220
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:29,063
You want some action,
go two towns over

221
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:30,715
to the circle bar.

222
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,134
I'm not hitting on you, buddy.

223
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,737
Actually, more like hitting you up.

224
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,196
I got a job for you.

225
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,366
You're guarding Bridget Kelly, right?

226
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:41,676
Word on the ranch is

227
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,703
her safety's
not exactly your priority.

228
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,122
And I've got
an inside source that says

229
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,016
you're working for Bodaway Macawi.

230
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,500
But I could pay you double.

231
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:53,796
I'm not working for anyone.

232
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:55,798
And even if I was,

233
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:57,242
you couldn't afford me.

234
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:58,910
But I can.

235
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:00,553
Bridget, what are you doing here?

236
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,363
It's Siobhan.

237
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,724
I'm the good twin.

238
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,884
And I'll cut right to the chase

239
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:07,310
so John here doesn't
talk your ear off.

240
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,370
You're going to scare
Bridget into running.

241
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,739
Actually, you're going to
scare her into running to me.

242
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,025
And for that, I will pay you double.

243
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,177
Fine... triple, if I have to.

244
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,570
But you're not leaving this bar

245
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,073
until you say yes.

246
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,369
You okay?

247
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,272
Yeah.

248
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:28,915
It's just a lot.

249
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,609
Well, looks like
you're doing all right.

250
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,078
50 k's a drop in the bucket for you.

251
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:36,047
But it's plenty to make me disappear.

252
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,283
Why should I pay you one cent?

253
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:40,585
You're an escaped convict.

254
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,321
All I have to do is call
the authorities and turn you in.

255
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:44,931
Last I checked, 911 was free.

256
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,542
Yeah...

257
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,019
But that would end up
costing you a lot more.

258
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,533
See, not only does Bodaway
not know I was working for you;

259
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:57,360
he doesn't know
that Bridget had a twin.

260
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,955
If you refuse to pay,

261
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,775
I got to keep working for Bodaway.

262
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,993
Which means
I got to find your sister.

263
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,979
And since nobody's got a damn clue

264
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,539
as to where she is,

265
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:14,585
I could always tell Bodaway
that you're Bridget.

266
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,150
(Footsteps)

267
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:26,447
Hey.

268
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,316
What's going on here?

269
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,002
Um, I'm packing for Chicago.

270
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,486
(Chuckles)

271
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,273
I figure, once the girls get
released from the hospital

272
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,825
and the doctors give them
the okay to get on a plane,

273
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,378
then we'll come and meet you.

274
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:42,071
If that's still okay.

275
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:44,132
If it's still okay?
It's better than okay.

276
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,266
It's great.

277
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,968
I mean, you know, it's not New York,

278
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,202
but you're going to love Chicago.

279
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:50,638
Mmm. Well, we can see about that one.

280
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,057
I just... I'm ready
for us to be together

281
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:54,584
and move on with our life.

282
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,314
You know, my sister
has been sending me listings,

283
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,366
and she found a place
that she really loves.

284
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:02,592
It's on the lake.

285
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,986
It's near good schools and museums.

286
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,764
And each kid can have their own room.

287
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,141
I mean, the only thing is,
it's out of my price range.

288
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:13,603
I thought we were buying
this house together.

289
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:20,526
You have no idea what that means
to hear you say that, but...

290
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:22,487
I mean, I...
I don't know

291
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,639
how long it's going to take
to sell this place,

292
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,007
and there's just a lot of stuff

293
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,533
to work out before we buy anything.

294
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,811
No.

295
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,705
Not if I give you the money
for the down payment.

296
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,291
(Laughing): You don't even know
what the asking price is.

297
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,485
Come on, I'm doing what you said.

298
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,488
I'm giving the benefit of the doubt.

299
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:45,218
I just want us all to be
together... as a family.

300
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:53,234
All right, so what do you want first?

301
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,869
The bad news or the worse news?

302
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,737
Those my only two options?

303
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,406
All right, give me the bad first.

304
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,541
An unidentified body
was discovered in Hoboken.

305
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,260
Uh, there's no DNA
or dental records yet,

306
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:04,178
but the face structure scan
and bone proportion

307
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,215
suggest it could be Malcolm ward.

308
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,133
Now, I know it's probably not a shock

309
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:11,286
after finding his wallet
on Daniel Eknath's body,

310
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,304
but still...
I'm really sorry.

311
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,139
Yeah, me, too.

312
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:18,432
Well, if that's
the bad news, what's worse?

313
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,282
Jimmy Kemper escaped
from prison yesterday.

314
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:25,900
I figured you'd want to know,

315
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,201
considering you were the one

316
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,893
who put the guy behind bars.

317
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,490
Andrew (Laughing):
Right.

318
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:33,625
"So long, suckers!"

319
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,043
"Sucker!" That's what he said.

320
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,210
"S-sucker""

321
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,945
your mouth goes to
the side like that.

322
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,797
"Sucker."
It's true.

323
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:41,899
Those were his words, not mine.

324
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:43,776
Rough day?

325
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,955
Oh, um... sorry.

326
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,282
It was a bit hectic.

327
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,292
Well, all you have to do now
is sit back

328
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,827
and enjoy this delicious meal
you prepared.

329
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,095
(Cell phone buzzing)

330
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,463
Actually, there's, uh, something

331
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,265
I wanted to talk to you both about.

332
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,541
Juliet:
Oh, my God.

333
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,959
Oh, my God, you guys.

334
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,103
Andrea's boyfriend just broke up
with her in a text.

335
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,713
I have... I have to go call her.

336
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,190
Juliet, sit.

337
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:08,960
That was rude.

338
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:12,471
Which I guess means
she's doing better.

339
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,148
Therapy was a good idea.

340
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,867
And vacation.

341
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:18,942
The most needed trip of the year.

342
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:21,647
- Andrew...
- Actually, I'm glad it's just

343
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:22,907
the two of us,
'cause there's something

344
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,275
I wanted to share with you, as well.

345
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,994
Do you mind if I go first?

346
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,763
No. Go ahead.

347
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,072
(Chuckles)

348
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,496
I've been working on my vows.

349
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:40,583
I know the first time
around, we just...

350
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,443
Repeated "I do,"
but this is different.

351
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,587
I wanted to say something special.

352
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,925
I found a poem,

353
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,852
"marriage song."

354
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,512
May I read you a bit?

355
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:55,863
Of course.

356
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,353
"There is my dove,

357
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,096
"my loved one.

358
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,382
"None with her can compare.

359
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:08,319
"Her beauty shames the day-star
and makes the darkness light.

360
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,621
"Day in her radiant presence

361
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:12,531
grows seven times more bright."

362
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:18,120
When I found it,
I knew I was reading about you.

363
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,848
For the rest of our lives,

364
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,126
I promise to find you in every poem,

365
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:27,822
to see you in every work of art,

366
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,841
to hear you in every love song.

367
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,939
I'm amazed by the power you have
over my heart, Siobhan.

368
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,708
I, uh, can't get over...

369
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,861
How you've stuck by me
through everything.

370
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:53,864
(Sighs)

371
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,083
You've made me a better man,

372
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,085
and I just hope that I can continue

373
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,246
to be the husband that you deserve.

374
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:05,001
It's beautiful.

375
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,695
Thank you.

376
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,047
Now it's your turn.

377
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:14,608
I...

378
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:20,266
After that, it can wait.

379
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:36,490
(Sighs)

380
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:39,010
Going somewhere?

381
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:40,995
What are you doing here?

382
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,963
Had you followed.

383
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,332
Didn't think you could be trusted.

384
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,655
Guess I was right.

385
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,657
I'm a fugitive, remember?

386
00:18:52,782 --> 00:18:53,974
Wanted for two murders
I didn't commit

387
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,092
because I was covering your ass.

388
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:56,927
I got no choice but to run.

389
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,831
But I thought we had a deal, Jimmy.

390
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:00,998
We do.

391
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:02,783
We do, and I'm...
I'm honoring it.

392
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,535
Look, I...
I found Bridget, all right?

393
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,254
She's... she's here.
She's in New York.

394
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,872
And she must have found a sugar daddy

395
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:09,790
'cause the bitch
is living the... the high life

396
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,459
over on park Avenue going by the name

397
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,634
of Siobhan... (Grunts)

398
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,514
Martin.

399
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:20,034
(Whispering):
Yeah... yeah...

400
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,263
I'm one step ahead of you.

401
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:47,436
When you told me
that Kemper made you run,

402
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:48,433
I never would have guessed

403
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:50,084
that your sister
and Delario were behind it.

404
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,437
It just doesn't make any sense.

405
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:56,357
Why would Siobhan pay someone
to make me run to her

406
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:58,393
only to kill herself
a few days later?

407
00:19:58,518 --> 00:19:59,782
I don't know.

408
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,095
But I did some digging.

409
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,147
Cop buddy of mine
slipped me John Delario's file.

410
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:04,949
Turns out there's a record of him

411
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:06,789
being in the Hamptons September 8.

412
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,415
He had lunch with your sister...

413
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:10,334
A long lunch... at Tipton's reef.

414
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,372
They talked for hours,

415
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:13,170
and they left together in his car.

416
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,462
So they were still in contact.

417
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:19,347
Yeah. I'm gonna head up
to the Hamptons later

418
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:21,178
and see what else I can dig up.

419
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:23,868
In the meantime,
I want you to take this.

420
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,141
No, I don't like guns.

421
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,559
You have to protect yourself.

422
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,072
I don't like the idea
of you and Kemper

423
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:29,173
running around in the same city.

424
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:30,375
Kemper's long gone by now.

425
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,709
Really, it's not...
What?

426
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,977
Necessary?

427
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:35,747
If memory serves, the last time
you turned down a gun,

428
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:37,736
it ended up saving your life.

429
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:40,156
Okay. Thank you.

430
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:43,993
It's pretty quiet around here.

431
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,806
Is that a good thing?

432
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:47,692
I haven't told them.

433
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:49,707
I was going to last night,

434
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:54,065
and then Andrew read me his vows.

435
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,418
That pedestal he puts me on, it...

436
00:20:57,543 --> 00:21:00,371
It's a long way to fall.

437
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:03,095
But I...
I know that you're right.

438
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:06,227
This isn't a fantasy; It's real life.

439
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:10,853
And when I do tell them,
it'll be over.

440
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,147
So what are you going to do?

441
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,483
I'm still going to tell them.

442
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:18,235
Tonight.

443
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:21,559
At your going-away party?

444
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:23,978
After.

445
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:27,244
I want one last night of the fantasy.

446
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:29,413
♪ Don't shut me out ♪

447
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,619
♪ forget who I was ♪

448
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:33,821
♪ what I was about ♪

449
00:21:33,946 --> 00:21:36,086
♪ oh ♪

450
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:38,881
♪ look hard enough... ♪

451
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,967
Hey. What's that?

452
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,470
You had a paternity test done?

453
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,555
You were sleeping with Tyler.

454
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,978
I needed to know
if the twins were mine.

455
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:55,193
Look, Siobhan,

456
00:21:55,318 --> 00:21:57,061
we're going to start
a new life together,

457
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:58,651
and I want to trust you.

458
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,905
I really do.

459
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,572
What's it say?

460
00:22:03,738 --> 00:22:08,106
What I knew it would always say:

461
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:10,287
The girls are yours.

462
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:12,399
(Chuckles)

463
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,835
Thank you.

464
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:20,214
You just made a hard
decision very easy for me.

465
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,519
I'll be reachable by cell and e-mail.

466
00:22:38,644 --> 00:22:40,855
And Claudine has all the
contact info for the resort,

467
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,440
just in case.

468
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:43,641
Have a safe trip.

469
00:22:43,766 --> 00:22:45,149
Thank you.

470
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:47,928
You know, I'm a lucky man, Tim.

471
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:51,899
I get to marry the woman
of my dreams twice.

472
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:54,068
Andrew, wait.

473
00:22:54,193 --> 00:22:55,893
There's one other thing.

474
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,492
I didn't really know
if it was my place,

475
00:23:01,617 --> 00:23:03,878
but I can't be a hypocrite.

476
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:08,499
I attacked you for your dishonesty,

477
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:11,292
but now I need to tell you the truth.

478
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,593
Greer:
I haven't seen Andrew around.

479
00:23:18,718 --> 00:23:20,011
Is he hiding someplace?

480
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:23,027
Oh, he's coming from work.
He said he might be a bit late.

481
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,945
Speak of the devil.

482
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:28,324
I just found out that everything
between us is a lie.

483
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:30,971
Excuse me?

484
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:33,329
I know about the affair with Henry.

485
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:37,875
Um, guys, what's going on?

486
00:23:40,572 --> 00:23:43,964
I am not having an affair with Henry.

487
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,586
But you were...
For over a year.

488
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:46,988
Don't even try to deny it.

489
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:49,053
Arbogast told me everything:

490
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,424
How he hired a private investigator.

491
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:52,264
Showed me phone records,
hotel receipts.

492
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,994
Do you guys need some privacy?

493
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,768
I can ask the guests to leave.

494
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,298
I think that's a great idea.

495
00:23:57,423 --> 00:23:58,633
Because there aren't gonna be

496
00:23:58,758 --> 00:24:00,105
any nuptials to celebrate.

497
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:01,690
(Guests murmuring)

498
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:05,402
This marriage is over.

499
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:09,448
Daddy, dad...
Dad, wait.

500
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:19,643
Henry?

501
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:23,157
How much was that down payment?

502
00:24:23,282 --> 00:24:24,880
Uh, I didn't put down the payment.

503
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,963
My balance is drained.

504
00:24:29,088 --> 00:24:31,387
Somebody must have
hacked into my account.

505
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,867
Bridget did it last time,

506
00:24:32,992 --> 00:24:34,807
but there's no way she would
know about this one.

507
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:39,061
Bridget didn't steal from you.

508
00:24:40,932 --> 00:24:42,815
I did.

509
00:24:44,686 --> 00:24:45,901
What?

510
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,181
I wanted to take away

511
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:49,066
the one thing that meant
something to you.

512
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:50,985
You know, kind of like
you took away everything

513
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,491
that meant anything to me.

514
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:55,990
I don't understand.

515
00:24:56,115 --> 00:24:57,496
I grew anxious,

516
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,779
and so I called the hospital
about the paternity test.

517
00:25:01,904 --> 00:25:05,087
I knew the results before
you opened the letter.

518
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:09,837
All that talk to me about honesty,

519
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:11,422
and <i>you</i> were lying?

520
00:25:11,547 --> 00:25:12,594
The test

521
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,041
was a test!

522
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:16,460
I wanted to see how you would
handle the truth.

523
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:19,143
Because the funny thing is
I could handle

524
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,103
not being the girls' dad,

525
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,384
but I cannot take another lie.

526
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:25,419
I mean, does <i>anything</i>
come out of your mouth

527
00:25:25,544 --> 00:25:27,109
that is actually the truth?

528
00:25:29,264 --> 00:25:33,878
Everything that I have done is
so that we can be together.

529
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:35,880
Henry, I love you.

530
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:37,453
That's the truth.

531
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,434
Well...

532
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,543
I don't love you anymore.

533
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:48,259
Now I'm gonna go out.

534
00:25:48,384 --> 00:25:50,966
And when I get back, I want you gone.

535
00:25:53,905 --> 00:25:58,056
Henry, I don't have anywhere to go.

536
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:00,354
I don't have any money...

537
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:04,926
Well, I'm sure you'll figure
something out.

538
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:06,800
You always do.

539
00:26:21,783 --> 00:26:23,361
The last of the guests are gone.

540
00:26:23,486 --> 00:26:25,329
Thanks.

541
00:26:25,454 --> 00:26:26,664
Where's Juliet?

542
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:28,032
I sent her to my place.

543
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:29,880
Give her a chance to clear her head.

544
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,070
I can't believe this is happening.

545
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,928
I had every intention
of telling him...

546
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,659
Just not like this.

547
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,265
Yeah, but you know,
maybe it's for the best.

548
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:42,434
Now that everything's
out in the open,

549
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,333
maybe you really can start fresh.

550
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,064
What's wrong?

551
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,122
Um, you know, I think I just
feel like being alone

552
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,940
if that's okay.

553
00:26:53,065 --> 00:26:54,196
Yeah, of course.

554
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,559
Just know I'm here for you.

555
00:26:55,684 --> 00:26:56,698
I do.

556
00:26:56,864 --> 00:26:58,825
Call if you need anything, okay?

557
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,028
(Phone rings)

558
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,214
Mrs. Martin.

559
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,715
Bodaway Macawi's in New York.

560
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:15,997
What?

561
00:27:16,122 --> 00:27:17,344
Jimmy Kemper found me.

562
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,388
Threatened to tell Bodaway
that I was Bridget.

563
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,585
Now Kemper's dead...
Which can only mean one thing.

564
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,891
Please, agent Machado,

565
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:24,705
you're the only person
that can help me.

566
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,424
Mrs. Martin, look, I'm sorry,

567
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,375
but my involvement in
the Macawi case is over.

568
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,232
Why?

569
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,679
Because my job depends on it.

570
00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:33,318
And considering I've already
lost everything else,

571
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:34,932
I just can't afford
to lose that, too.

572
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:36,851
But look, you have every right
to be concerned.

573
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:39,616
The second we hang up, I'm gonna
call the New York office.

574
00:27:39,782 --> 00:27:40,742
I gotta go.

575
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:43,245
No, Mrs. Martin, wait!

576
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:46,123
(Sighs)

577
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,501
I know you probably don't
want to talk to me right now,

578
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:55,173
but you deserve to know the truth.

579
00:27:57,162 --> 00:28:01,926
I love you more than I ever thought

580
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:03,849
it was possible to love someone.

581
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:08,766
My life... completely changed

582
00:28:08,891 --> 00:28:11,023
when I met you seven months ago.

583
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,151
Seven years.
(Chuckles ruefully)

584
00:28:15,346 --> 00:28:18,042
No.

585
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,698
Seven months.

586
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,953
I didn't cheat on you with Henry.

587
00:28:28,726 --> 00:28:30,277
Andrew, I...

588
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,016
I'm not Siobhan.

589
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:39,968
I'm Bridget.

590
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:50,496
Obviously, there were things
about my wife

591
00:28:50,621 --> 00:28:52,131
that I didn't know, but suicide?!

592
00:28:52,256 --> 00:28:53,857
There's just no way!

593
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,001
It happened.

594
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:57,876
I was there.

595
00:28:58,594 --> 00:28:59,988
I'm sorry that this...

596
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:01,340
Don't you dare apologize!

597
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:04,242
There are no words to make up
for what you've done!

598
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,966
You looked me in the eye and cried

599
00:29:11,091 --> 00:29:14,620
about your drug addict,
prostitute sister.

600
00:29:14,745 --> 00:29:18,907
And little did I know that I was
sleeping next to her

601
00:29:19,032 --> 00:29:20,258
for the past seven months.

602
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:24,202
I never intended for it
to go on this long.

603
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:27,557
I was only doing it
to protect myself.

604
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:29,685
I never thought...

605
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,187
I was gonna fall in love with you.

606
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,762
I so wanted to Siobhan
to have changed.

607
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:42,114
I guess you believe what
you want to believe, huh?

608
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,589
(Sighs)

609
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:48,870
Like I needed to believe that
you might forgive me.

610
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,777
That somehow you might...

611
00:29:54,902 --> 00:29:56,795
Love me for me.

612
00:30:00,806 --> 00:30:02,657
(Chuckles)

613
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,138
I <i>do</i> love you...

614
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:11,810
... But it's all a lie.

615
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:13,912
Don't say that.

616
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:15,355
You know that's not true!

617
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:18,233
Andrew, I only did this

618
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,195
because it was the only way
that I could protect myself.

619
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,208
I told you, take it easy.

620
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:28,410
Will you lay off...?
It's a party.

621
00:30:28,784 --> 00:30:30,179
(Glass breaks, body thuds,
woman sobs)

622
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:31,163
Shay?

623
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,766
(Shaylene gasping)

624
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:36,568
Bodaway:
I know who you're working for, Saylene.

625
00:30:36,693 --> 00:30:39,521
I work... for... you!

626
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:41,279
(Gasping)

627
00:30:45,952 --> 00:30:47,652
(Grunts)

628
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,622
I ran as far as I could.

629
00:30:56,747 --> 00:30:59,775
It's a miracle
that Bodaway didn't get me.

630
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,321
But the cops did.

631
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:08,306
I have so many
regrets about what I've done.

632
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:13,721
The basic tenet of NA is truth, and...

633
00:31:15,816 --> 00:31:18,084
And all I've been doing is lying.

634
00:31:20,186 --> 00:31:21,463
But the one thing

635
00:31:21,688 --> 00:31:25,267
that I have no regrets about...

636
00:31:25,392 --> 00:31:29,037
Is loving you...

637
00:31:29,162 --> 00:31:30,514
And Juliet.

638
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:34,851
I stayed sober because

639
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:39,832
I had two people whose expectations

640
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:43,608
I wanted to live up to.

641
00:31:47,463 --> 00:31:49,247
I'm so sorry.

642
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:57,232
And for what it's worth,

643
00:31:57,357 --> 00:32:00,569
(sighs)

644
00:32:00,694 --> 00:32:03,728
I'm a better person for loving you.

645
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:21,940
You need to leave.

646
00:32:34,143 --> 00:32:37,178
You know you can stay
as long as you like.

647
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:40,125
London, honey,

648
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,835
help me set up the guest room

649
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,087
so we can give Siobhan

650
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:52,178
How could you do this, Siobhan?

651
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,015
I mean, I thought you and daddy

652
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,792
were happy together.

653
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:59,194
And I thought that the three
of us were finally starting

654
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,520
to become a real family.

655
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:03,916
We are a real family.

656
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,358
And I didn't have an affair.

657
00:33:05,524 --> 00:33:08,612
Then why would Mr. Arbogast say that?

658
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,995
Because...

659
00:33:13,015 --> 00:33:15,452
I'm not who he thinks I am.

660
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:24,002
Oh. Hey, Andrew.
What are you doing here?

661
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:30,342
I've been wanting to do that
since the day I met you.

662
00:33:37,423 --> 00:33:39,309
Say something.

663
00:33:41,077 --> 00:33:44,329
I knew you were
too good to be true...

664

Bridget.

665
00:33:48,984 --> 00:33:52,405
Juliet, I...
Don't bother!

666
00:33:52,571 --> 00:33:55,784
You think my mom's an awful person?

667
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:59,110
You are exactly like her.

668
00:34:00,312 --> 00:34:02,514
Actually... worse.

669
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,234
She's sick.
