1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,597
- Here; option one is the cheapest.
- But paragraph 2.2...

2
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,718
- Hi, Sami! - Excuse me.
- Hi, Baba.

3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,230
Are you good? Look, I got the fish.
You can cook it tonight.

4
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,712
- Great, thanks.
- Don't forget spices and salt.

5
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,678
- How is Amanda?
- Fine. She's working.

6
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,356
What working? I told you,
she have baby, no work, must rest.

7
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,390
- It's fine, Dad. I can't talk now.
- Okay. There's potatoes in there too.

8
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,157
- Fish is good. You like fish?
- Yes, it's good stuff.

9
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,199
- You eat fish, live many years.
- To an old age.

10
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,469
No, not old, just live extra.
- OK, Sami, see you tonight.

11
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,078
- Bye, Baba! - Sorry. My dad.
- I understand.

12
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,596
- So, 2.2.
- Right, sorry. 2.2...

13
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,515
- Hi, Juan. Are you good?
- Hi, Aziz. Just fine.

14
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,711
What you doing?

15
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,668
- Fixing lamp, good. Coffee?
- Please.

16
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,188
Dill, got it. And low-fat milk? Okay.
Roast... Roast beef.

17
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,753
- Hi, boss!
- Hi, Aziz. - No, Aziz came in.

18
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,431
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

19
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,430
- Look.
- What is it?

20
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,594
Ah, the cord goes this way.
It's like this in old lamps.

21
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,636
Hi. I need a bit of help
with my bike.

22
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,554
- It is broken?
- I can't get the lock open.

23
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,838
- It is your bike?
- Yes, it's my bike.

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,632
- You have papers?
- No... it was my Mum's, she just died.

25
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,678
- Uh-huh.
- Yes, it was very sad.

26
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,037
- How much you want to pay?
- Uh, 20 kronor?

27
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,228
- 20 kronor? What you saying, 20 kronor?
- Juan, you hear him? 20 kronor.

28
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,756
- A hundred.
- That's good. - You pay 300.

29
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,474
- 300? The lock isn't worth 80!
- 300 or I call the police.

30
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,428
- 300 is great.
- Good! Juan, get the tool.

31
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,315
Wait, wait, don't open, Juan.
300 kronor first.

32
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,396
Now open. Okay.

33
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,795
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.
- Thanks, goodbye.

34
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,237
He a thief! Paid 300!

35
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:46,351
- Aziz? What's going on?
- We oil chain only. 100 kronor.

36
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,469
- Okay. Look, I need help inside.
- I be right there.

37
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,556
So, 100 to you, 100 to me.
Is good.

38
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,239
- Can you manage the shop a while?
- No problem, boss.

39
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,278
Mum will come and tally up sales.

40
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,991
- Your wife call?
- Yes, I have to help her at home.

41
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,316
- Jörgen, she always call, you run!
- Nothing strange about that.

42
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,874
Very strange! You must be man,
strong man. Or else she say goodbye.

43
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,396
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, have it your way.

44
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,190
- Hi, Mum! All right?
- Just fine. Jörgen, helmet!

45
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,356
- Hi! Are you good?
- Good, just fine. You?

46
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,832
- Good too. If you're good I'm good.
- Then we're both good.

47
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,556
Dino...

48
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,876
Dino!

49
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,712
Dino boy. Puppy...

50
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,993
- Juan, Dino sick?
- He's been droopy lately.

51
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,199
Are you in pain?
Does it hurt?

52
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,753
Your legs? Do your legs hurt?

53
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,755
- What colour do you want?
- I was thinking white.

54
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,072
- How much? The whole way?
- Yes, what can it be, 2-3 metres?

55
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,190
Something like that. I'll measure it
so I don't make extra work for myself.

56
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,434
- What was that about?
- I wanted to borrow a hedge shear.

57
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,876
- Hedge shear...
- Come in and eat!

58
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,555
- Had a good day?
- Yeah.

59
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,718
- Sami, can you get that?
- I'm about to get a high score!

60
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,112
You're so unbelievably lazy!
"High score"...

61
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,355
Hi, Aziz!
Fine, how are you?

62
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,356
Your son? He's playing video games.
I know, childish, isn't it?

63
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,192
Here he comes.

64
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,876
- Video games aren't childish.
- No, they're very mature.

65
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,992
- I'm very hungry. The fish ready?
- I'll check.

66
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,631
- Amanda, is the fish ready?
- What fish?

67
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,110
Yes, it's almost ready. Okay.
See you tonight. Bye.

68
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,800
- Sami, I want to finish this!
- I promise, I'll do it later.

69
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,078
You... I know, but... You think it's a
pain pretending all the time, too.

70
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,155
- All he wants is grandchildren.
- We're going to have kids!

71
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,677
We're going to adopt.
I mean... Kids of our own.

72
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,474
- What, you feel the same way?
- No, of course not.

73
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,633
I promise, everything will be perfect
when he meets a woman.

74
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,476
I swear! He'll drop the grandchildren
thing and focus on her.

75
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,553
- Of course... Brilliant idea...
- I think so!

76
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,193
- I'll put him on some dating site.
- Remind me, why did I marry you?

77
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,516
- Seriously, no dating sites.
- Why not?

78
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,673
You just... Have to try harder.

79
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,231
He... No. We could call Gunnel
and have her come over.

80
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,949
- Gunnel who?
- My colleague. She's really pretty.

81
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,635
She's always saying
she wants to meet someone.

82
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,670
- You think she'd like Dad?
- Yes. But what he'll think of her...

83
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,469
- Let's try it.
- Okay, go ahead.

84
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,598
I'll do it!

85
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,075
- Can you get my shirt?
- Of course.

86
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,116
- It feels so gigantic!
- The old one was too small.

87
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,355
- Wait... Should the navel be here?
- Shit, I put it on upside down.

88
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,475
- There.
- Does it feel okay?

89
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,236
- Are you sure it's not too big?
- No, this is the right month.

90
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,949
- Sure?
- There he is.

91
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,833
- Hi!
- Hi, Amanda, are you good?

92
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,552
Good. Ah, he getting big, the baby.
Good, good.

93
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,994
- What's Sami doing?
- Cooking. Let me take yourjacket.

94
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,232
- He's a decent cook. You're better.
- Thank you.

95
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,317
Hi, Sami! Are you good?

96
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,193
Amanda, have you thought
what to name baby?

97
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,956
We've thought a bit, but we'll wait
to see if it's a girl or a boy.

98
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,557
You don't know what it is?
Wait, I'll say...

99
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,034
I think a boy. I know when I see woman.
90% I'm sure it's boy.

100
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,035
- So we need boy's names.
- You find a good name.

101
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,117
Sami, come! Come see,
dad bring great present.

102
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,794
- What's that?
- Family tree, very nice.

103
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,114
Look, that's me, your mother,
you Sami, and Amanda.

104
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,831
It's you and me!
And then four empty ones.

105
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,994
Ah, four empty. There is soon baby
here, and maybe three come later.

106
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,630
- So we're having four kids?
- Four.

107
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,113
- If you want more I can put here...
- No, four is good.

108
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,748
- Four good?
- We'll start there.

109
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,754
- What you say, Sami?
- Four is good.

110
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,879
- Wine or beer with dinner?
- I'll have a beer... water.

111
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,429
- Baba?
- I drink arrack.

112
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,037
- Double or single?
- Big, your dad don't drink small.

113
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,910
- Who's that?
- A friend of Amanda's. She's nice.

114
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,711
Hi, Gunnel! Come in!
You look fabulous.

115
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,156
- I'm not late, am I?
- Of course not! Come in.

116
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,869
- You won't forget?
- Don't worry.

117
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,036
- Aziz, this is Gunnel, my colleague.
- This is Aziz.

118
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,790
- This is my son.
- Sami. Glad you could come.

119
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,790
- Nice.
- Thank you.

120
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,669
So, have a seat!

121
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,474
- Here, Baba.
- Thanks.

122
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,077
- Thank you for cooking.
- It was very good.

123
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,634
Baba, you know they work together at
the hospital, Amanda and Gunnel?

124
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,918
- Yes, Amanda said.
- We have fun together.

125
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,200
- Good.
- Good co-workers are important.

126
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,559
They're almost more important
than the job itself.

127
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,191
Of course, we prefer
the coffee breaks.

128
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,999
Good...

129
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,872
- So, what do you work with?
- Who, me?

130
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,556
You want know where I work?

131
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,670
I work with mafia.
You know mafia?

132
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,593
- No...
- You don't know mafia?

133
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,754
You know, sometimes also
we go around town. Drink little beer.

134
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:10,270
We get tired, what we do now, so we
take gun and shoot people on street.

135
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,597
We don't like their face,
we shoot them.

136
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,189
- You want see the gun?
- Baba!

137
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,638
Dad has a different sense of humour.
He's just kidding.

138
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,509
Amanda, your friend think,
she scared from me.

139
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,116
- Be nice now!
- I'm kidding.

140
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,108
- So... what are you doing tomorrow?
- Nothing.

141
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,231
No?

142
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,749
- I feel like dessert.
- I'll get the ice cream.

143
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,953
Don't drive right into the wall.
You have to pass the other cars.

144
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,112
- Thanks for coming.
- It was fun.

145
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,231
See you.

146
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:23,077
- You have to turn the car around.
- This is hard!

147
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,392
- That went well...
- What you say?

148
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,075
Nothing, I'm just tired.
Good night.

149
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,110
- Good night, Aziz.
- Good night, Amanda.

150
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,956
- You've already lost.
- I'm too tired to play.

151
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,597
Sami, I must ask: Why you bring
Gunilla here today?

152
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,117
She's a friend of Amanda's.
She came for dinner.

153
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,915
That's it? I see in your eyes
you have something else to say.

154
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,876
Tell.

155
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,271
To be honest, Dad, I do want
to talk to you about something.

156
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,554
What?

157
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,953
- Maybe you need to meet people.
- What you mean?

158
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,956
- Maybe meet a girl.
- A girl? No thanks, I am happy now.

159
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,910
Why you think this?
I have you, Amanda, soon babies.

160
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,595
- I am very happy.
- I know.

161
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,070
But maybe you'd like
someone besides us.

162
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,758
You know I can't do that.
I think of your mother all the time.

163
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,596
- I love her, that's why.
- I understand.

164
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,880
It's the same for me. I love her so
much. I think about her every day.

165
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,229
But it's ten years since she died.
Maybe it's time to move on.

166
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,518
It could be fun, Amanda and me
and you and your girlfriend...

167
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,549
Your grandchild will have a grandma,
we could be a big family.

168
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,793
- What do you think?
- Okay, I'll think about it.

169
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,798
- I can help you look.
- No, I don't need help.

170
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,316
Thanks. Okay.

171
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,836
- Okay Baba. I'm going to bed.
- Okay.

172
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,072
- Will you sleep here?
- Yes, I'll sleep here.

173
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,390
Good night.

174
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,194
Baba... I didn't upset you, did I?

175
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,992
Sami! You're my son, should
you make me upset? Never!

176
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,995
- Forget about it. Good night!
- Good night, Baba.

177
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,389
- I'm going to make some tea.
- Let me.

178
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,236
- I'll pause this.
- Nah, it'll only take a second.

179
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,110
- It's more fun to watch together.
- Okay, pause it.

180
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,512
- You don't have to get mad.
- I'm not mad.

181
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,800
Lotta, is something going on?
You can talk to me.

182
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,952
- I'm a good listener.
- Nothing is going on.

183
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,318
- I'm just going for more tea!
- I'll take care of it.

184
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,832
I just thought it felt wrong when
you didn't want to watch the film.

185
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,118
I wanted tea.
It has nothing to do with us.

186
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,716
"Us"? What do you mean?

187
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,990
- That's not what I meant!
- What did you mean?

188
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,709
- I'm going to bed.
- We have to talk!

189
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,238
I can't stand it when you act
this way. AII... wimpy!

190
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,356
Good night!

191
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,836
Mariam, how are you?

192
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,436
My darling, my life...

193
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,597
I want to ask you something,
but I don't know how to say it.

194
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,308
Our son wants me
to meet a new woman.

195
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:45,192
You know how much I love you.
What do you think I should do?

196
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,273
Well...

197
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,230
- Nothing wrong with him, eh?
- He has hip problems.

198
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,839
- What's wrong with him?
- Arthritis. It's common in old dogs.

199
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,475
Are there medicines,
or an operation?

200
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:31,039
I wouldn't operate on such an old dog.
I recommend putting him to sleep.

201
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,718
You're a doctor! You're supposed
to save lives! Not execute my dog!

202
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,557
I'm very sorry.

203
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,352
No! No! We're leaving!
Come, Dino!

204
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,069
- Juan, what's that you're building?
- For Dino. His hip hurts.

205
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,268
See, this will make him well.
You'll see.

206
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,239
- Hi, boys! All good?
- Hi.

207
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,631
- Boss good too? Little massage?
- Why not?

208
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,519
- Ow, ow! No massage.
- You not strong, boss!

209
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,835
- Hi, Aziz!
- Hi, Edith!

210
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,039
- Work going good?
- Just a little paperwork.

211
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,116
We get these new ones.
Good quality, good you ordered them.

212
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,075
- I take my clothes. Okay?
- Okay!

213
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,240
- Jörgen, must order ball bearings.
- Ah, okay.

214
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,234
- I use them now.
- They'll be here tomorrow.

215
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,996
Speaking of balls, Aziz,
I had fun with two chicks last night.

216
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,152
- Two chicks? What you mean?
- Big party!

217
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,917
You can handle two chicks?
No way. You got a thing like this.

218
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,311
Are you crazy?
Mine is like this.

219
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,759
- If yours like this, mine like this.
- Macho, macho!

220
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,314
Good!

221
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,110
- Jörgen, you have big or little one?
- A normal one.

222
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,831
- Large? Medium?
- More medium, maybe.

223
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,109
Size isn't important, it's how you use
it. There are different techniques.

224
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,319
- What techniques?
- There are books about it.

225
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,071
- Oils and spices and tantric sex.
- What trick sex?

226
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,109
No, tantric sex.
With... Pillows and candles and things.

227
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,549
You sit and look at each other and
fantasise about touching each other.

228
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,271
That's what's good about it,
according to the Chinese.

229
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,514
In your imagination,
your organ is... More sensitive.

230
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:20,313
- Juan, what is this trick sex?
- Tantric sex, it's like... Mental sex.

231
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,359
Metal sex? What that?
What is this?

232
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:30,231
- Boss... You have wife problems?
- No, why would I?

233
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,758
- You don't get home action.
- How many time?

234
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:42,758
It varies; I don't really know.
Maybe... Two, three times a month.

235
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,710
- Two time a month? Oh, big problem!
- Is it?

236
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,192
- Juan, what you say? Two time month.
- Problems.

237
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:58,071
Big problem. He don't work good.
No, no, no. He don't work good.

238
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,916
Jörgen, you my friend.
You listen, I help you.

239
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,554
This trick sex metal,
you need to throw it all away.

240
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,431
When we close here, you go home,
say, "Here I come!" and get hard.

241
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,309
Take her hand
and go right to bedroom.

242
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,679
Throw her on bed
and go in right away.

243
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,436
- Listen. Ask Juan.
- True, true.

244
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,639
Boss, I take Dino for a walk.

245
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,598
Dino, come now,
come now!

246
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,917
Jörgen, I must ask:
Your mama, how old is she?

247
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,517
- Mum? Why is that?
- She is very pretty. Nice lady.

248
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,834
- Aziz, she's my Mum!
- I'm just asking.

249
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:06,633
- That hardness thing... How hard?
- Women like a man is hard.

250
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,916
She say black, you say white.
She say yellow, you say blue.

251
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,189
See, you be in charge.
Do that, it will be good.

252
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,196
- Have you got any ideas for dinner?
- No, what do you think?

253
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,638
- You first.
- Hmm... Minute steak?

254
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,793
- No... No, I don't want that.
- No?

255
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,396
- Fish. I want fish sticks.
- Okay.

256
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:47,669
What? You want fish too?
But you just said you wanted meat.

257
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:54,075
- Yeah, but now we said fish.
- So you want fish now?

258
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:01,351
- Forget that. I mean, I want meat.
- Fine then, meat.

259
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,715
- Make up your mind!
- What's with you?

260
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,714
Have you decided on fish?
Well, forget it, I want meat.

261
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,238
- No! I want fish!
- I said meat.

262
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,073
Meat... I... Lotta!

263
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:31,112
- This is cool! Are you nervous?
- Why should I be? Maybe you are!

264
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,319
No, I think it's great!
Who are you going out with?

265
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,077
- I have many, can find many women.
- I don't doubt you. I'm just curious.

266
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,633
Don't need to be curious. Didn't you
say I should get woman? I did!

267
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,711
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

268
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,229
- Here you go.
- This very good, genuine fabric.

269
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,313
Try it on, let's see.

270
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,469
Check out, your dad
is model.

271
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,272
All the women come and say hi, hi,
your dad is a hot one.

272
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,796
This is very good.

273
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,235
- Amanda...
- What will you do with your hair?

274
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,474
- What do? Nothing to do.
- You sure? No gel or wax or anything?

275
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,269
I don't use those things,
just a little water here and here.

276
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,638
...like an old model, you know.
Women all like old models.

277
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,473
- Cool.
- Your dad, he know!

278
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,394
That was a friend.
Can we go home now?

279
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:50,073
- We need to go. Have fun tonight.
- Okay, goodbye.

280
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,636
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Amanda, okay.

281
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,190
Take care of baby, okay?

282
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,390
Amanda, who was it?
What is it?

283
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,232
- He might see!
- It doesn't matter anymore.

284
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,596
Honey... who was it?

285
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,915
- It was Ann from the adoption agency.
- What did she say?

286
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,358
She said... Something happened, so...

287
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,993
We're not getting our baby.

288
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,039
What happened?
There must be something we can do.

289
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,158
I don't know.

290
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,871
- Hi.
- Hi. Do you have Arrack?

291
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,428
Arrack. You don't understand?
Beer. Give me beer, please.

292
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

293
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,117
- Here you are.
- Thanks. Here.

294
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,231
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No. I'm waiting for my husband.

295
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,188
Oh, you have husband.
Okay. Good, good.

296
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,878
Good. Okay. Bye.
Tell your husband hi from me.

297
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,356
- Hello. May I sit here?
- Okay, sure.

298
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,355
- So then he says, "Hey, sweet thing. "
- No way!

299
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,672
- Let's have a toast instead.
- Cheers.

300
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,035
That hit the spot. So...

301
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,752
- Do you want to dance?
- No thanks.

302
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,040
- Maybe later?
- No, we don't like to dance.

303
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,914
There's that song.
We have to dance.

304
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,108
So, you do want to dance, good.
I come soon.

305
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,078
- This is a best seller, a classic.
- What does it sound like?

306
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,910
- How far does the sound carry?
- Maybe... 50-60 metres.

307
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,390
- In a tailwind?
- Um... I don't know...

308
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,712
- What about this one?
- These are typical on Chinese bikes.

309
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,476
- I can't hear it.
- Jörgen, you do what I say with wife?

310
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,030
Aziz, I'm with a customer.

311
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,352
You want buy bell? Buy this.

312
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,795
- It's very good!
- Thanks.

313
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,949
- Aziz!
- Wait, wait, I help.

314
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,271
- Good dog.
- Head goes in here? Oh, I see, good.

315
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,310
Then this goes under here
and through here.

316
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,471
- That's it, good.
- Ah, this good job!

317
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,679
- Let's see if it works.
- He can walk now.

318
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,675
Dino! Dino, time for a walk!
Come, Dino!

319
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,670
Oh, oh! Good! He walk by himself!
Very good!

320
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,228
- Good! Good job!
- Dino, good boy.

321
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,629
Juan, I must ask.

322
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,158
- Can you find for me a woman?
- A woman? For you?

323
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,350
- I thought you are the maestro?
- Yes, but I thought you had extra?

324
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,469
- A new flavour? What kind of women?
- Just one. One is enough.

325
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,077
- But what should she be like?
- Nice and pretty. Look good.

326
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,198
- Pretty, nice?
- And look good.

327
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,114
I have one. You two will be perfect!

328
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,716
- She is good?
- Great. I guarantee it.

329
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,557
Here's what we do: I cook, you come
to me, and hermano, we party!

330
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,998
Party, party!
That sound good.

331
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,516
- I'm really sorry about this.
- I don't understand...

332
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,276
We've received photos of him,
we've sent him presents.

333
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,355
I know. Sometimes complications arise
and lead to these situations.

334
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,755
- But I... Can't we do something?
- Not in this case, I'm afraid.

335
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,750
But of course we'll apply
for another child.

336
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,629
- How long will that take?
- As I said on the phone...

337
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,396
- It can take six months to a year.
- But we've waited so long!

338
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,509
We've been evaluated and approved,
we've taken courses...

339
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,357
- Then you can wait six months more.
- We need our baby now!

340
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,119
I'm sorry.
This is hard to digest.

341
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,114
There is one option, if you'd consider
a child from another country.

342
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,034
From China, for example. The
waiting times are much shorter there.

343
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,320
You mean...
we'd have a Chinese baby?

344
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,031
That's up to the two of you.

345
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,830
This Chinese baby...
It'll look very...

346
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,995
...Chinese?
- Yes, of course.

347
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,956
Amanda, what do you say?

348
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,318
I want to have a baby with you.
I don't care what it looks like.

349
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,233
Okay... Okay...
Should we... Go for it?

350
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,474
Yes.

351
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,276
Okay. We'll take it. I mean,
that's good. We'll do that.

352
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,556
Okay. Then I need you
to fill in these papers first.

353
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,273
- Hi Juan!
- Hi Aziz!

354
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,237
- Are you good? Pal!
- Welcome.

355
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,155
- Look at you, nice!
- This very good quality!

356
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,394
- Genuine fabric.
- Macho, macho!

357
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,874
- Wow, look at all this! Nice!
- All the best for Aziz. Come and see.

358
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,677
Look. The best gourmet food.
Cojones.

359
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,195
What that, cojones?

360
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,395
- Sheep testicles.
- Testicle?

361
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,153
Sheep testicle?
You serve women sheep testicle?

362
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,118
This is an aphrodisiac.

363
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,670
You eat this and your blood boil,
and I swear you get <i>noche loc</i>a.

364
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,193
- You think they eat sheep testicle?
- Women go wild, I promise!

365
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,478
I think they get scared
if you say sheep testicle.

366
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:55,237
- What do we say then?
- What can we say? It sheep testicle.

367
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,597
What can I say?

368
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,153
- Hello ladies!
- Hi!

369
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,110
- <i>Adel</i>a<i>nte p</i>a<i>s</i>a<i>r!</i>
- Juan! Chico!

370
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,156
- Hi, I'm Aziz.
- Hi. Deborah.

371
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,949
- Flowers for you.
- Oh, thank you!

372
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,349
- They smell so good!
- Nice flowers, smell good.

373
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,959
I hope you're hungry, ladies,
because I have such damn good food.

374
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,591
Yes!

375
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,830
- Are you good?
- Yes, fantastic!

376
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,596
Look at the weather,
the sun shining!

377
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,595
I love the sun
and heat!

378
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,719
I love heat too.
You love heat, too?

379
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,955
Yes, you get so warm and
soft in your muscles.

380
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,036
You know, I do yoga. I've done it
since I was a little girl in Nairobi.

381
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,557
At an ashram.
And heat is very important...

382
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,589
...that it goes into your muscles
and affects your breathing.

383
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,472
So you breathe deeply,
from your stomach...

384
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,194
...and blow out
through your mouth.

385
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,796
And in...

386
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,069
That's good.

387
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,152
Here we are! Juan Special.

388
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,232
It smells good!

389
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,599
- So, what is it?
- It's... Lamb.

390
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,276
Lamb... It looks like eggs.
It smells like eggs.

391
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,557
Eggs... Yes, it's lamb eggs.

392
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,193
Lamb eggs?

393
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:08,550
- Lambs don't lay eggs...
- In my country they do. All the time.

394
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:15,068
- I believe you. Anyway, I'm hungry!
- Me too. Thanks!

395
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,631
This is yours, Aziz,
and here's mine, the biggest one.

396
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,158
- It's good.
- Very good.

397
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,517
It's very good, Juan.

398
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,468
This reminds me
of when I was in Dar-es-Salaam...

399
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,269
We were walking along the main
road, and the sun was shining.

400
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,069
...and the wind blew through my hair.

401
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:51,509
...and I stood in the shade of
an oleander tree and breathed in...

402
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,070
- Aziz, come and dance with us!
- I be there soon.

403
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,631
- Aziz, come on!
- I don't feel like dancing.

404
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,789
- Juan, come and dance!
- I'm coming, chicas!

405
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:14,032
- Aziz? You don't like the women?
- No, they very good.

406
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:19,832
Very kind. But I don't have
strength to dance with them.

407
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,594
OK. Fine.

408
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,790
- But thank you, very kind to me.
- You don't have to say that.

409
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,910
Dino? What's wrong, boy?

410
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,879
- What he has?
- Dino...

411
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,037
Does it hurt again?

412
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,990
Does it hurt again?
- He aches all the time.

413
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,919
- Does it hurt, Dino?
- He sick, he hurt.

414
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,596
Listen to me. You need find
a woman for Dino.

415
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,596
You know, he must have children.
You can have many Dino.

416
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,788
My father, he die. Then I come,
then come my child...

417
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,999
...then my grandchild.
That is life.

418
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,632
S'okay, s'okay. Not to cry.

419
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,474
- It's so cute!
- Look at the little tail!

420
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:37,272
Honey... Do you think Dad
is going to realise...

421
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,879
...why it doesn't look like us?
- No, absolutely not.

422
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,439
- You don't think so?
- Do you <i>look</i> Chinese?

423
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,434
No, but <i>you</i> can look a little oriental
in certain lighting.

424
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,116
No, really, I mean, parents and
children don't always look alike.

425
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,798
Some genes can skip a generation.
I've read that.

426
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:08,035
They can be recessive and suddenly pop
up, like that albino kid in Africa.

427
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,715
We could say
it came out wrong.

428
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,754
- "It came out wrong"?
- It must happen sometimes...

429
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,674
Like it didn't get enough oxygen
and doesn't look right.

430
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,038
The only thing coming out wrong
right now is you.

431
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,278
This is nice. Maybe a little frilly.
What do you say?

432
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,876
Absolutely! Very nice.

433
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,315
What is it?

434
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,554
Honestly... I'm not sure if I can tell
Dad about adopting a baby.

435
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:49,590
- Are you serious?
- I know I should, it's just...

436
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,036
- Then do it.
- He'll think I'm useless!

437
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,988
He'll stand there with his family tree
and his puppy dog eyes...

438
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:02,632
For god's sake! "Dad this
and Dad that"... what about us?

439
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,396
You and I are starting a family.
You're going to be a dad.

440
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,951
I think it's there.
I'm so nervous!

441
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:36,274
Look, Juan, look!

442
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,118
Hi, dogs! Hi, dogs!

- Nice girls too!
- Thanks. I'm proud of my kennel.

448
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,033
You want to meet the pro?
He's in the car.

449
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,718
- Dino.
- Take look.

450
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,635
- What's that thing he's wearing?
- That?

451
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,794
That's special equipment
that enhances mating efficiency.

452
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,034
- The ad didn't say that. He's sick.

453
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,275
Juan, help me.

00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,195
- See? Very strong.
- But the wheels?

455
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:53,833
The wheels? Is nothing.
He like to play he like a car.

456
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,756
- Like that.
- I'm sorry.

457
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,357
Look here, what big testicle.

458
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,514
- He make babies first try. Feel!
- No. I'm sorry.

459
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:15,076
Don't say sorry me.
Say sorry your wife. You have wife?

460
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,312
- Dino, he want wife too.
- Not here.

461
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,395
- Just a quick one?
- I'm sorry.

462
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,472
You not nice. You bad.

463
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,472
There are others.

464
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,034
Good luck.

465
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,670
Don't say goodbye. Come.

466
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,956
- We're almost there!
- Is that the shop?

467
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,908
- That's it! Ow! Ow!
- You! Come here!

468
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,311
- You sold my bike?
- No.

469
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:09,476
- Tell me! How much he charge?
- Three hundred! He sold it to me!

470
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:15,272
I've never seen him before.
You must talk to my boss.

471
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,158
- I'm Jörgen, what's the prob?
- What kind of thief are you?

472
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,519
- Take it easy!
- Shut up! Sit down, damn it!

473
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:32,153
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.
If the bike is broken, let's talk.

474
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:37,075
So, it IS you sell my bike!

- How much they charge?
- 300!

476
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,390
- Did you sell him a bike?
- Never!

477
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,151
I don't understand...

478
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,949
There's no need
to resort to violence.

479
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,315
- There's no need for violence!
- Come on, fight me!

480

00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,191
- I dare you to do that again.
- Okay.

488
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,988
- One more time...
- Fine.

489
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,355
- Shit!
- What "shit"?

490
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,395
What, you play Kung Fu?
Think I be afraid?

491
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,313
Yes, I do!

492
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,155
Damn you! You want bike now?

493
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,232
You want bike? Get out!

496
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,394
Jörgen? Are you okay?

497
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:42,270
I thought I was going to die.
You just did that, and he...

498
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:48,037
- Weren't you scared?
- Aziz never scared, Aziz strong!

499
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,875
- Yeah, but...
- Notjust body, must be strong here.

500
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:56,875
Can you teach me?
Teach me to be strong in the head?

501
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,831
I can teach you. You be so strong,

504
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:20,839
- I want date with your mother.
- You have to drag her into this?

505
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,630
- I don't think she's your type.
- She my type, yes.

506
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,916
- No, no.
- Yes.

507
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:34,269
You help me, I help you.
I will make you strong man.

508
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,991

509
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,955

00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:03,111

514
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:15,429

515

Ow.

524
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,589
That one is wicked.

525
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,230
- Will it scare people?
- Well, it looks angry.

526
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:24,077
- Maybe I should have words under it.
- Plain text or a banner?

527
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:38,114
You can damn well go to h...
Go for it!

528
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,350

00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:28,469
- Hi, Edith, are you good?

541
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,435
- Need any help, Mum?
- No. Are the receipts ready?

542
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,990
They're on the desk.

543
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:51,677
- Jörgen, do it now.
- I've been thinking...

544
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:57,119
I don't think it's such a good idea.
I mean, you know...

545
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:03,157
Then I thought, she has a friend,
Louise. Very nice.

546
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:10,470
- Maybe you could date her instead?
- Jörgen, I don't want date Lewis.

547
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:15,270
I want date your mother.
You promised.

548
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,592
I helped you be man.
We must help each other.

Okay, I'll do it.

00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,153
Come.

551
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,357
Come, come. Yalla yalla.

552
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,632
Hi, Mum. Um... isn't it lunchtime?

553
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,349
Already? I just got here.

554
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:51,878
- Yeah, but... I feel like a kebab.
- Just let me finish this.

555
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:02,639
- Wait, I have to man the register.
- Jörgen, I can go with your mother.

556
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:09,070

01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,909
Very good. Smell.

562
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:39,631
- Actually, I have no sense of smell.
- Why not?

563
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:46,751
When I was little I fell and
a tiny bone here cut off a nerve.

564
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:52,278
- It's no big deal.
- When someone fart you can't smell!

565
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,352
You have very pretty face
when you smile.

566
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,115
- Go ahead, eat.
- Thank you.

01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,915
- I make warak arish, you know that?
- No.

570
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:23,997
Grapes leaves, we make with rice
and meat and wrap in leaves.

571
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,948
- That sounds good.
- Very good. I can make for you.

572
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,998
- Yes, I'd like that.

573
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:37,359
- Do you also cook?
- I'm a great cook. I make Italian.

574
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:54,279
You are so pretty when you laugh.
Your eyes, nose do like this. Pretty!

575
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:59,878
- Nah, I'm so old.
- Who tell you old? Maybe blind man?

576
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:05,876
- You very pretty. Really!
- You're kind of cute too.

577
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,954
- Is good.
- Very good.

578
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,271
Too slow!

579
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:30,634
- You're cheating. You psyched me.
- You can't accept that I'm better.

580
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,592
- Hi, Baba!
- Hi, Sami! Are you good?

581
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:43,834
Where is Amanda?
I want tell you, very good day today.

582
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,232
She's in the kitchen, cooking.
Let me get yourjacket.

583
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,954
- She'll be right here.

584
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:58,399
- Have a seat, I'll be right back.
- Okay, I'll wait.

585
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,751
- You'd better put on the belly.
- Aren't we going to tell him?

586
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,435
- Not now, he seems so happy.
- We can't keep pretending!

587
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:11,355
I promise, it's the last time.
Please, please, please.

588
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:22,758
So, Baba, what's your news?
Amanda is just changing clothes.

589
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:28,119
Then I can wait.
There is no hurry. Wait, wait.

590
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,358
- You're so secretive!
- I am happy. Wait a little.

591
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,277
Hi! Thanks for waiting,
I just had to change.

592
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:45,468
Don't work too much, you must rest.
Now I want tell you:

593
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,031
I have found a woman.

594
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:54,671
Notjust found,
I am going to marry her too.

595
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,118
What? You're getting married?

596
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,512
That's great, but... who is she?

597
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:10,518
Her name is Edith. She is very pretty.
And happy, she laugh all the time.

598
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,588
- How long have you been seeing her?
- Many times.

599
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,709
- That's fantastic! Congratulations!
- Thank you.

600
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:27,399
- Sami! You are not congratulating.
- Sorry, I'm just surprised! Congrats!

601
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,916
Thank you! Thanks!

602
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:38,437
- When can we meet her?
- Soon, I cook and you meet her.

603
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,672
I can't believe
you haven't said anything before!

604
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:46,789
No! Not be four - Be five!
You forget baby come soon.

605
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,632
Oh, that's right...

606
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:54,716
Sami, you must help me,
I need buy new suit.

607
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,078
- With a nice tie.
- We'll take care of it, Baba.

608
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,232
- Sami, check out Dad in this suit.
- Nice, Dad!

609
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,630
- Look good?
- Great!

610
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,758
- Like Charles Bronson.
- Mafioso!

611
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,512
- How about a little moustache trim?
- No thank you.

612
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:25,879
- Man without moustache, no good.
- You could trim the edges a bit.

613
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:31,160
Never! You must moustache too.
What you say?

614
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:35,950
- Moustache good for men?
- Yes, men should have moustaches.

615
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:40,591
Women like moustache on men.
Thank you.

616
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,156
Hello?

617
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,436
- What are you doing?
- Moving in with Jenny.

618
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:07,277
- Why?
- I can't take this anymore.

619
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,988
Neither can I. This isn't easy
for me either, you know.

620
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:22,994
- What?
- Being what you want me to be.

621
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:27,119
Tough and macho
and hollering all the time.

622
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,114
I've tried; itjust isn't me.

623
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:37,116
Having a moustache and wearing black
and barbecuing hotdogs...

624
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,796
What are you talking about?
Where did you get that idea?

625
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:46,033
I never said
I wanted you to be tough and macho.

626
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:53,149
- So what's the problem?
- I don't know; you're acting weird.

627
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,959
- So you don't want macho?
- I don't know why you thought that.

628
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,115
I'm sorry.

629
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,956
- It's my fault.
- You've been so bizarre.

630
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:18,478
I know. I was so worried
and got strange ideas.

631
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:23,475
- It really upset me.
- I know. I was a jerk.

632
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:30,318
- I'll be the wimp I really am.
- Why do you get such weird ideas?

633
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:35,554
- I thought you wanted a tough guy.
- I've missed you.

634
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:41,352
Really? I've missed you too.
And I got a tattoo for no reason.

635
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,831
- You're kidding. That was real?
- Yeah.

636
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,231
- Wanna see?
- Holy crap...

637
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:26,756
Okay, go ahead!

638
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,469
Go on!

639
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,796
Dino, up and at 'em!

640
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:41,757
Pretty girl! Look! She like you!
Pretty girl, smells good!

641
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,957
Go on, smell her! Dino!

642
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,877
Dino... Dino, boy...

643
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:07,115
- Excuse me, that's my dog!
- It ran away.

644
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:11,398
- I caught it for you.
- Oh, thanks!

645
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:16,634
Bad girl! Why do you always run away?
Come on now!

646
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,796
- Hello?
- Hi, Edith, it's Aziz!

647
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:44,351
- How are you?
- Hi, Aziz! Fine, I'm out shopping.

648
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:50,630
Very good. I must tell you:
Tonight I make warak arish.

649
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:56,239
- You know, I told you about it?
- Yes, I remember.

650
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:02,077
My son and his wife are coming
for a little party. You can come too.

651
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:07,270
I don't have any plans. I'd love to
come, if I wouldn't be a burden.

652
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:12,230
- No, I be happy if you come.
- Then I'll be there.

653
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:17,110
- Should I bring something?
- No, everything taken care of!

654
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:22,877
- Just you come.
- I'll be there!

655
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,918
- See you!
- Bye!

656
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,709
- There. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

657
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,796
What is it?

658
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:11,117
I apologise for being so...
weird and difficult and cowardly.

659
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:18,279
There is nothing I want more
than for us to have this baby.

660
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,156
I'm going to talk to Dad tonight.

661
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:36,593
So, tonight I meet
my stepmother.

662
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:41,393
I can't believe he's getting married!

663
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:47,757
- Put on some of this.
- Stop that. Cut it out!

664
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,630
- You'll ruin it.
- You have to look good for her!

665
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,914
- You look great!
- So do you!

666
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,914
Come and help me.
She will be here soon.

667
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,029
- Can you whip that?
- It smells so good, what is it?

668
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,476
- Warak arish, good stuff.
- Is it done now?

669
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:23,279
- We take this.
- I'll put a little of this on it.

670
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,835
- Is anything missing?
- It's great, relax Dad.

671
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,794
- I think we need more bread.
- Good idea.

672
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,231
I'm coming, I'm coming!
- She here.

673
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:49,351
Hi, Edith! Welcome!
Come in, come in.

674
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,476
- You look great!
- You look great, too. Good colour.

675
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,436
Come in.

676
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,914
- Hi!
- This is my son and Amanda.

677
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,799
- I'm Sami. Nice to meet you.
- Edith.

678
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:09,478
I'm Amanda.
It's so good to finally meet you!

679
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,758
- Have a seat. This is your place.
- Oh my goodness!

680
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,436
- It all looks so fabulous!
- It does, doesn't it?

681
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,472
This is a meal you won't soon forget!

682
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:27,713
- Is this what you were talking about?
- Yes, warak arish, very good.

683
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:32,476
- It looks so good!
- Very good. Help yourselves.

684
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,997
- I can help you.
- Do you drink white wine?

685
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,475
Thanks.

686
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:46,076
- You know what, you're so beautiful!
- Thanks.

687
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:52,593
- Aziz?
- Just a half glass, please. Thanks.

688
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,431
Please.

689
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:00,830
- You two look so much alike!
- You think so?

690
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,437
- A son should look alike.
- You've the same eyebrows and nose.

691
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,674
- But I only got the good looks.
- He say he more handsome?

692
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:14,230
- I show you.
- No, Baba!

693
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:21,155
- Look, Edith, tell who most handsome?
- Oh, no contest!

694
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,993
- What a hunk!
- Show Amanda.

695
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:29,598
I have to say that your dad wins.
I'm sorry!

696
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:34,754
Your dad is more handsome. But you're
not ugly. You do have similar noses.

697
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:38,799
- The noses and the eyebrows.
- They are similar.

698
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:45,593
But in looks only, not as individuals.
Sami tends to take his time.

699
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:52,074
His dad is faster. Like tonight.
How long did it take you to propose?

700
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,118
- 2½ years.
- Three years!

701
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,909
How long did it take you two?

702
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:03,153
- What do you mean?
- It's great how fast it went.

703
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:07,677
I think the two of you
make a great couple.

704
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,230
And I'm so happy to meet you.

705
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,557
Oh, I forgot something. Wait.

706
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:33,797
Edith, you will marry me?

707
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:41,916
I got rings and everything.
You will marry me?

708
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,278
What?

709
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,637
You will marry me?

710
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,078
- I don't know what to say.
- Say yes.

711
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,119
I will be your husband,
you will be my wife.

712
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:13,230
- You laugh, I laugh. We good match.
- Oh, Aziz...

713
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:20,158
Soon come grandchild.
Ask Sami, ask Amanda.

714
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:30,239
I will be granddad. You be grandma.
We be big family.

715
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,829
I think I have to leave now.

716
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,198
But it was nice meeting you.

717
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,393
Edith...

718
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,399
Edith!

719
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:06,072
I will be back.

720
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:22,471
Edith. Edith!

721
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,229
Why you won't marry me?

722
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:33,995
- We barely know each other.
- I am good man!

723
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:39,109
Are you good woman, too?
Together we be very good!

724
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:45,397
It doesn't work that way for me.

725
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,276
I'm sorry if I've hurt you.

726
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,513
Aziz...

727
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,997
- Did you talk to her? Is it okay?
- No, is not okay.

728
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:46,518
She seems to really like you;
I think she was just caught off guard.

729
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,678
No, I don't want any more.

730
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,799
Baba...

731
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:02,554
Be honest, how long
have you known her?

732
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:07,840
Can you tell me anything about her
personality? What makes her happy?

733
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,393
- What her interests are?
- She very kind. Very good.

734
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:18,031
I don't know why she say no.

735
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,390
- It doesn't work that way.
- What you mean?

736
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,438
Baba...

737
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:44,876

Friends don't marry each other,
