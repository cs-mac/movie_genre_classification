00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:59,651
<i>Tie a yellow ribbon
Around the old oak tree</i>

2
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:06,327
Rae, this is tight, baby.
This is a tight song.

3
00:03:06,328 --> 00:03:09,581
You ain't feeling it. I could
just flip the track, you know.

4
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:11,124
Put the '90s version, like:

5
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,628
<i>Tie it up</i>

6
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,923
<i>Tie it up
Yellow ribbon</i>

7
00:03:17,924 --> 00:03:22,224
<i>Tie it up</i>

8
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:24,680
You spent $5000 for this car...

9
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:27,391
...and you don't even check
to see if the radio works?

10
00:03:27,392 --> 00:03:29,852
You gotta realize this is not
a CD player, okay?

11
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:32,396
This is not a CD player,
you can't be banging it.

12
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:35,107
This is history. Original equipment,
an eight-track.

13
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:38,944
I'm gonna destroy some original
damn equipment in about two minutes.

14
00:03:38,945 --> 00:03:42,490
Every time something sets you off,
you go swinging at the ding-a-ling.

15
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:45,868
Don't know why women want to do that.
Always ding-a-ling swinging.

16
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:49,497
I'll tell you, you can swing my
ding-a-ling all the way back to Chicago.

17
00:03:49,498 --> 00:03:51,791
Oh, my God.

18
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:53,835
- You getting sick?
- Yeah.

19
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:58,297
- Look, aim it out this time.
- Michael, stop it.

20
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:01,092
You care more about this car
than you do about me.

21
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:02,552
- No. I do not.
- Yes, you do.

22
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:04,596
Come on, you know
I love you, nail girl.

23
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:07,766
It's just it costs a lot of money
to get these seats cleaned...

24
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:10,435
...and I haven't spent one night
with the car yet.

25
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:11,853
- You getting sick?
- Honey?

26
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:13,689
- You getting sick, huh?
- Honey...

27
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,692
Look, out, out, out. Aim out. Aim out.

28
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:19,027
- I don't have to throw up.
- What you gotta do?

29
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:21,530
- Oh, you gotta-
- I gotta go:

30
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:23,574
In, in. Hold it in.

31
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:25,868
- I've gotta go to the bathroom.
- I'm driving.

32
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:27,369
- Drive fast!
- I'm going.

33
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,872
I'm gonna turn the music up
so you don't feel it.

34
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:31,248
Okay.

35
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:34,043
- I gotta go.
- Tie a yellow ribbon around your ass.

36
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:38,344
- Okay, baby.
- Okay.

37
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:46,264
<i>- Ball three!
- He tak es ball three.</i>

38
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:49,934
<i>Phoenix is up by one in the first inning
of this state championship game.</i>

39
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:52,395
<i>The winner goes on to the nationals.</i>

40
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:56,696
All right, Pete. This is the pitch.
No pressure, babe, no pressure.

41
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:03,524
Good eye. Good eye. All right,
let's drop a quarter in this carousel.

42
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:16,508
Strike three. You're out!

43
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:23,256
<i>Everyone, please, stay in your seats
while the officials sort this out.</i>

44
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:29,726
Oh, you must be smoking.

45
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,027
Hey, hey. What's going on
with my ri-?

46
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,149
<i>Children of the Corn.</i>

47
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,361
You struck out my hitter
with three men on base.

48
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:41,488
Struck out your hitter?

49
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:45,283
Oh, you're talking about the little game.
All right, well, my bad.

50
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:47,786
- Michael!
- Yeah?

51
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:52,087
I hope she don't think that's a john.

52
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:56,837
That filled up last season.

53
00:05:56,838 --> 00:06:00,591
Honey?

54
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:02,009
Hi.

55
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,220
Look, I'm sorry for whatever he did.

56
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,471
- I did?
- He'll fix it.

57
00:06:05,472 --> 00:06:09,475
But could you please tell me
where I can find a bathroom?

58
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:12,478
Well, most of the businesses
around here are closed down...

59
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,232
...because of our little game.

60
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:21,144
But you might try the Zip
two miles out on Main.

61
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:24,491
- Okay. Honey, come on.
- Yeah, I'm coming. Just hold on.

62
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:26,826
- I got some man things to discuss.
- Play ball!

63
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:29,788
- Honey, I gotta go.
- I got to do man stuff.

64
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,249
Dadgum.

65
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,000
- Hold on a second.
- Come on, boys.

66
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:37,587
- My damages and everything.
- Let's go play some defence.

67
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,298
What you looking at, tiny?

68
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:43,759
Rae! Rae! Rae, what are you doing?

69
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:02,404
See, it works. There just wasn't
any radio stations in the desert.

70
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:08,077
Come on, come on, come on.

71
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:10,038
Go, go, go.

72
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,957
I see something peeking.
You dropped something.

73
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:16,628
- Shut up.
- Let the bag of tools go, girl.

74
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:18,380
<i>It's Michael G. from Las Vegas...</i>

75
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:21,508
<i>- Oh, man.
- ... where it's 108 degrees on the Strip.</i>

76
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,510
<i>Boy, that's pretty hot.</i>

77
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:27,306
<i>Coming up next is "Sweet Lik e Candy"
from Page Three.</i>

78
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:29,808
It's highway robbery.

79
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:32,603
I'm saying that the prices
is highway robbery.

80
00:07:32,604 --> 00:07:36,273
I wasn't referring to you, that y'all
was robbers or nothing like that.

81
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:40,652
I'm sure y'all are nice
Christian kind of folks.

82
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:47,456
<i>Is that the car McCann had for sale
down in Phoenix?</i>

83
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:53,416
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
You know, your pump is broke.

84
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:55,293
<i>What did you do to it?</i>

85
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:59,594
<i>- I didn't do nothing to it.
- Was working fine before you got here.</i>

86
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:04,015
Yeah, well, now that I'm here, it-

87
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:07,806
<i>Forgot to lift the handle, didn't you?</i>

88
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:10,559
You forgot to kiss my black ass.

89
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,889
<i>Yeah, well, looks lik e that Studebak er's
still got a wiring problem.</i>

90
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:19,406
Looks like you got
a nosy-as-hell problem.

91
00:08:20,153 --> 00:08:22,905
<i>Good job.</i>

92
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:25,282
<i>I'm amazed that old car runs at all...</i>

93
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:27,910
<i>...with all that electronic junk
McCann stuck on it.</i>

94
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:31,831
I'm amazed somebody ain't kicked
your ass, with that trash you talking.

95
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:35,876
<i>I hope you didn't pay the full 18 thou
he was asking for it.</i>

96
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:40,177
That's none of your damn business.

97
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:44,682
Eighteen thousand dollars?!

98
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:47,639
You told me we paid 5!

99
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,766
- Is that what I said?
- Yes.

100
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,476
I talked him down.

101
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:54,437
Michael, we all know you're good,
but you ain't that good.

102
00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:56,106
Now, let me see the chequebook.

103
00:08:56,107 --> 00:08:57,816
Yeah, well, the chequebook is-

104
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,360
Right in your hand.
You got it in your hand.

105
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,237
I wanted to make sure you could see.

106
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:05,198
It was kind of dark
when the transaction went down.

107
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:06,533
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

108
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:09,453
- Michael.
- Rae, I know what you're thinking.

109
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:11,497
Fifteen thousand dollars?

110
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:13,832
But it's a '57 Golden Hawk classic.

111
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,461
- Honey, that was our house money.
- Did I tell you it was supercharged?

112
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:19,630
Michael, you lied to me.

113
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:23,259
You're getting all emotional.
You act like you're in a soap opera.

114
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,177
- Is it your time of the month?
- What?

115
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,763
Is that what's going on?
I thought you was bloated.

116
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:32,427
- A kangaroo pouch was happening.
- You know, I should whup your ass.

117
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,606
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

118
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:39,317
- These people could be dangerous.
- I can be dangerous.

119
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:42,404
- Hi, I need to get to an airport.
- We aren't taking sides.

120
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:44,990
Airport? Come on, Rae.
An airport? That's crazy.

121
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:48,869
<i>- Oh, you ain't seen crazy yet, either.
- You're looking for an airport?</i>

122
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,580
Yeah. Yeah, actually. Hi. I am.

123
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:54,124
Yeah. I told you once
to stay out of my business.

124
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,877
<i>Las Vegas is just a short drive
around the canyon.</i>

125
00:09:56,878 --> 00:10:00,380
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- I can't believe this. After all I've done.

126
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:03,592
Trying to put together a nice vacation.
This is the way you act?

127
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,678
You call this a nice vacation?

128
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,181
And now we're spending the rest
of our time driving back to Chicago...

129
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:12,018
...to look for a house
that we suddenly can't afford.

130
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:15,563
<i>- That money was for a house?
- Yes. Can you believe him?</i>

131
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:20,356
And he bought this stupid
piece-of-shit Batmobile.

132
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,905
You know, I'm out of here. That's it.

133
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:26,866
Rae- It's not a Batmobile, bro.

134
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:28,910
Rae, where are you going?

135
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,120
Away from you.

136
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:33,623
- Don't make me call you out your name.
- Oh, I wish you would.

137
00:10:33,624 --> 00:10:35,208
I'll call you out your name.

138
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:39,129
I'm gonna call you out your name.
I'll cuss you!

139
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,298
- Give me this bag.
- Give me. You better-

140
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:43,634
Give me this. You know what,
you are getting-

141
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:45,886
You're getting strong.

142
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,555
You ain't gotta take it out on the car,
either. Damn.

143
00:10:48,556 --> 00:10:50,307
Don't disrespect me, woman.

144
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:52,977
Honour thine boyfriend,
like it says in the Bible.

145
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:57,307
There's a flight to Chicago leaving
Vegas airport tonight at 6.

146
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:00,151
I thought you said
you weren't taking sides.

147
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:02,111
I didn't know it would be so easy.

148
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:06,525
<i>Come on, Michael, spending
that money violated a trust, a bond.</i>

149
00:11:06,742 --> 00:11:08,826
I'm gonna snatch them wires
out your ass.

150
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:12,330
We're headed that way, ma'am.
You're sure welcome to ride with us...

151
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:15,542
...as long as you don't mind
riding in the back with the boys.

152
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:19,843
- The boys?
- The boys?

153
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:22,257
- pay that much again.

154
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:25,677
Oh, man. I can't even get with this.

155
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:27,179
- Howdy.
- Hi.

156
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,016
They don't want you, Rae.
They got spurs that jingle-jangle-jingle.

157
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:33,727
- They got ropes and no steers.
- That's what you think.

158
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:35,437
Look, look, look. Rae, listen.

159
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:37,773
Now, black people don't do
this kind of stuff.

160
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:40,234
Mountain climbing,
getting lost in the forest...

161
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:43,237
...taking rides with people
we don't know, we don't do that.

162
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:45,156
So let's just chill, okay?

163
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:47,199
Goodbye, Michael. I'm leaving.

164
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,409
What you mean-?

165
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,828
- I can't do this.
- You can't do what?

166
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:52,788
I can't be with you anymore, Michael.

167
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:54,749
You really tripping.

168
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,834
Oh, now you're gonna
give the ring back.

169
00:11:56,835 --> 00:12:00,880
Okay, come on.

170
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:04,843
Well, I spent a lot of money on the ring.
No, I didn't mean it like that, Rae.

171
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:09,221
I may not be an expert, Michael,
but women like to feel important.

172
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:14,390
The little things, like, well,
sending them flowers for no reason...

173
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:17,147
...or leaving little notes
in their sock drawers.

174
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:20,275
Uncle Fester, if you don't get
out of here- Okay, look, Rae.

175
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:23,403
You done had your fun,
you and the Beverly Hill-buddies.

176
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:27,734
I'm gonna count to three, and I want you
to get your narrow tail off of this truck.

177
00:12:27,992 --> 00:12:29,868
One.

178
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:31,245
Two.

179
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:35,546
I'm at two, Rae. This is two.

180
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:38,502
Okay, well, go on, then.
I don't need you.

181
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:41,881
I'm just playing, Rae.
Rae, I'm playing.

182
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:43,549
What about my ring?

183
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,219
I'll FedEx it to you!

184
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,973
- Damn.
- Don't try to call my mama's house!

185
00:12:49,974 --> 00:12:52,267
Girl, your mother loves me.

186
00:12:52,268 --> 00:12:54,144
What?

187
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:58,445
I'll call if I want to.

188
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:03,528
What the hell?

189
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:06,698
Tough break, man.

190
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:09,326
Pretty stupid to lock
your keys in like that.

191
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:11,495
Wasn't stupid, man.
I was just in a hurry.

192
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:13,747
You gotta be careful.
This is a classic car.

193
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:15,374
Gotta know what you're doing.

194
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,042
- Damn.
- I can open it, you know.

195
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:19,128
- You can?
- Fifty bucks.

196
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:21,672
Fifty bucks, partner?
Who you trying to fool, man?

197
00:13:21,673 --> 00:13:23,799
Fifty dollars,
I can get in there myself.

198
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,136
I heard some of them cowboys say
your girlfriend had a cute butt.

199
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:28,471
Is that what they said?

200
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:30,348
It was the tall one, wasn't it?

201
00:13:30,349 --> 00:13:34,268
I'm gonna kick his ass.
Look, all right, this is 50.

202
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,937
It's all I got.

203
00:13:35,938 --> 00:13:38,106
But you get it after you
get in here, okay?

204
00:13:38,107 --> 00:13:41,943
You open it, the money's yours.
Let's go.

205
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:44,779
- Well, I'm gonna need a hanger.
- Okay.

206
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,782
- I can't do it without a hanger.
- I'll grab you a hanger...

207
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:52,083
...and a Wet-Nap to get your
Slush Puppie mess off of my ride.

208
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,090
For 50 bucks, you should have
your own hanger.

209
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:08,183
Yes.

210
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:11,640
Excuse me, Bing, do you work here?

211
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:14,060
No, I just like wearing plaid.

212
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:18,361
- Look, I need to get a hanger from you.
- I need 14.75 for the gas.

213
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:23,358
Fourteen-seventy-five.
Okay, look here.

214
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:29,539
- Look, I'm in a hurry. This is all I got.
- Better get something else then.

215
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:34,372
All right.
Fourteen-seventy-five for the gas...

216
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,959
...35.25 for a hanger.

217
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,544
You don't need a hanger.

218
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,672
<i>I do need a hanger. If you was
in my business, like earlier...</i>

219
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,051
...you'd understand the man can't
get into my car without a hanger.

220
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,304
- Wanna bet that 50 bucks?
- I will double down on the 50 bucks...

221
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:53,605
...and the plaid shirt.

222
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,353
Hey, hey. Get out of my ride!

223
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:00,654
Oh, I'm gonna kick your ass.
Your little ass is kicked.

224
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,069
I'm gonna kick your ass!

225
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,370
Goddamn!

226
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:20,545
I need a phone.

227
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:24,846
- Sheriff's number is on the side.
- Okay.

228
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,350
I need a quarter from you, boss.

229
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:34,810
I ain't got no quarters.

230
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:38,605
What kind of store
ain't got no quarters?

231
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,065
Hey, look here, partner.

232
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,860
What I got to do
to get a quarter around here?

233
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:46,697
I know where you can make a quick
100 if you like wearing tights.

234
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:48,991
Come on, man.

235
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:52,078
<i>I am in The Twilight Zone.</i>

236
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,038
What you need, Opie?

237
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,290
Are you Puff Daddy?

238
00:15:56,291 --> 00:16:00,591
Do I look like Puff Daddy to you?

239
00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:04,424
You got a quarter?

240
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:07,886
Yeah, I am Puff Daddy. It's amazing
how you saw through my disguise.

241
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:11,848
I need to make a call. I gotta call my
record company and check on my-

242
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:14,809
You know they're going back
to eight-tracks? Do you rap?

243
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,519
Because you could be Too Short.

244
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,820
- Jose.
- You know, Vanilla Too Short.

245
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,579
Sheriff's office.

246
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,456
<i>I need to report a stolen car.</i>

247
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:38,417
Bummer. The sheriff's not here.
He's at the baseball game.

248
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:40,628
Damn, why don't that surprise me?

249
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:41,962
<i>I can have Rick drop by.</i>

250
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:45,299
Rick? Does Rick have anything
to do with law enforcement?

251
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,510
Does he carry a gun,
badge, shit like that?

252
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:49,303
He's the deputy.

253
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:51,597
Cool. Send Rick on over here, then.

254
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:52,807
<i>Where are you?</i>

255
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:55,310
I'm at the Pis & Piz.

256
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:58,229
No, I'm sorry, the Sip & Zip.

257
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,733
When you see him,
tell him Wilma says " hey. "

258
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:03,568
Okay. I'll tell him you said hey.

259
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:06,154
Want me to pick up
some his-and-her T-shirts too?

260
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:07,823
<i>- No, just hey. Bye.
- All right.</i>

261
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:10,909
Hey, hey. Don't you
need to know my name?

262
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,287
Figure you'll be the one
without the car.

263
00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:14,746
Also, I have on a striped-

264
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:19,047
Hello? A striped-

265
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:22,421
Yeah, well, they said they're gonna
send somebody named Rick over.

266
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:25,549
This is cool. All right.
I got 50 bucks.

267
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,844
Minus the 14.75 for gas.

268
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:32,139
And his quarter.

269
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,725
Okay, I got $35.

270
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:38,104
And I got six hours
to make it to the airport.

271
00:17:38,105 --> 00:17:41,190
Jose's daughter's taking a load
of grapefruit to the airport.

272
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:42,609
She could take you.

273
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,910
Can she get me there by 6?

274
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:49,991
Oh, man, tell him- I'll tell him.

275
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:53,119
Thank you, man.
You've saved my life-ay.

276
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,420
I don't know how to thank your ass.

277
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:02,921
He says the $35 would be nice.

278
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:08,925
The $35. All right. I'll tell you what.
I'll give her half when she gets here.

279
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:13,437
I'll give her the other half-ay
when we get to the airport-o.

280
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:24,485
<i>Taco bueno.</i>

281
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:28,786
He says okay, except you look
like the guy who stole his stereo.

282
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,368
But I've never met you.

283
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:34,871
Come on with the jokes.

284
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:38,166
He don't need to steal anything.
He's Puffy.

285
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,669
That's right. I don't need to steal.

286
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,962
I'm Puffy.

287
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:45,507
Give it to me. You got my back.

288
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:48,885
- We bad.
- Daddy's gonna be all right.

289
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:54,094
When life hands you lemons,
what do you do?

290
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:58,609
I like to make a light hollandaise sauce
with a salmon frappé.

291
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:03,405
- Sounds good.
- Yeah. Hell, I'm starving.

292
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:11,205
No. To the right.

293
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,620
Man, you suck.

294
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:18,921
Oh, it's a stupid game anyway.
Go to college.

295
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:20,919
- Mr. Daddy?
- Yeah?

296
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,798
Can you sign my hat?

297
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,099
- You want Puff Daddy's autograph?
- Yeah!

298
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:32,681
Oh, well, yeah. What's your name?

299
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:34,307
Rusty.

300
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:36,601
"To R-" Wait a minute.
That's too soft.

301
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:40,902
You got to be
"To Bustin' Rusty," huh?

302
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:45,782
" Recognize. "

303
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:58,241
" Hugs and kisses. Puffy. "

304
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:00,918
- There you go.
- Oh, this is dope!

305
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:03,588
Yeah, it's dope.
Wait, you gotta put the hat right.

306
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:06,340
See, you gotta put it right there.
Now you suave, see?

307
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:07,800
Get your shirt right.

308
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:10,553
What are these, gauchos?
Let your gauchos hang.

309
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:12,430
Now you can hang
with the homeboys.

310
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:13,640
In the 'hood?

311
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:15,850
- In the what?
- In the 'hood.

312
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:18,520
<i>Where else would you be, huh?
Of course in the 'hood.</i>

313
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:19,771
- You a warrior?
- Yeah.

314
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:21,064
- Are you down?
- Yeah!

315
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:24,401
That's what I'm saying. You gotta be
a warrior to hang with Puffy.

316
00:20:24,402 --> 00:20:27,321
Get down. They're shooting.
I didn't want this for you.

317
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:30,324
You're too young.
Oh, my God, are you bleeding?

318
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:32,284
Afternoon, Jack.

319
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:33,494
Hello, Mary.

320
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:37,039
You busting a move on me, Puffy?

321
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,250
Yeah.

322
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:43,551
That's a little reflex. You gotta be ready
when you're in the streets.

323
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:46,549
You ever kill anybody?

324
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:50,303
Yeah, I probably have,
but I didn't stick around to see.

325
00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:52,305
You know, I'm just tough like that.

326
00:20:52,306 --> 00:20:54,724
Are these doughnuts fresh, Jack?

327
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:57,894
Fresh as usual.

328
00:20:57,895 --> 00:20:59,604
- Are you her?
- What?

329
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:01,940
- The lady with the melons.
- What?

330
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:05,026
The lady with the grapefruits.
Are you her?

331
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:09,327
Hello? You ain't her.

332
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,229
That was quick.

333
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,809
Thanks, Jackie.
Maybe I can return the favour one day.

334
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:52,205
My bad.

335
00:21:53,494 --> 00:21:54,744
Yo.

336
00:21:54,745 --> 00:21:59,045
Hey, you looking for me? Where-?

337
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:08,425
How you doing?

338
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:11,762
Yeah, I saw the crate on the back,
so I figured you had to be her.

339
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,347
You know about the crate?

340
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,599
Yeah, well, he mentioned it.

341
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,389
Whipped cream, dog food, douche?

342
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:24,608
You sure you want
the Spring Scented douche?

343
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:28,404
They say Fresh and Natural
beats it all to hell.

344
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:32,783
This is where it's at, on the frigging
counter, so this is what I want.

345
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:34,243
You got it.

346
00:22:34,244 --> 00:22:37,997
Yes, I'll give you half of it now,
then I'll give you the rest of it later.

347
00:22:37,998 --> 00:22:39,874
Hey, Jack,
how about some hot dogs?

348
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,919
Hot dogs not done yet.

349
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,170
Rodrigo.

350
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:46,298
- Doughnuts?
- They're done.

351
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,258
Rodrigo.

352
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:49,926
Shut up.

353
00:22:49,927 --> 00:22:54,388
Well, Rodrigo, that'll be 9.57.

354
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:58,899
Quarters, if you don't mind.
I'd appreciate it.

355
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:06,193
Okay! Nobody move!

356
00:23:06,194 --> 00:23:10,494
What?

357
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:13,451
Cool.

358
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:16,621
- What the hell are you doing in here?
- I came to get a hot dog.

359
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:18,456
- I was hungry-
- Who the hell is he?

360
00:23:18,457 --> 00:23:21,125
- He's your guy.
- He ain't my guy.

361
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:22,543
I'm nobody's guy.

362
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:26,714
- He knows about the crate.
- Oh, Jesus. He knows about the crate.

363
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:29,884
- How do you know about the crate?
- Somebody told me the crate-

364
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:32,762
Y'all running grapefruit, huh?

365
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:34,889
He don't know shit, Rodrigo.

366
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,310
Would you stop using names?

367
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:41,730
Is that what I said to you?
I said not to use names, right?

368
00:23:41,731 --> 00:23:45,734
Is that what I said to you, or was there
some other frigging idiot in the car?

369
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:48,821
- I thought you were talking to Trina.
- Hey, Sal!

370
00:23:48,822 --> 00:23:52,908
Oh, great. Now, everybody got that?

371
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:58,248
I'm Rodrigo. That's Trina over there,
and the bigmouth is frigging Sal.

372
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:02,543
- Sorry, but he knows about the crate.
- Okay, shut up!

373
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:04,253
Okay.

374
00:24:04,254 --> 00:24:08,554
Everybody, hands up!

375
00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:13,684
Sal, see if he's got a weapon
under the counter. Come on.

376
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:16,474
Look, I see you got a lot
on your mind right now.

377
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:17,976
I got somewhere I gotta be.

378
00:24:17,977 --> 00:24:20,353
I'm gonna give you this,
because I could-

379
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:24,654
Go over here and mind
my damn business. You can keep it.

380
00:24:26,068 --> 00:24:30,529
What are you doing, huh?
Give her the shotgun!

381
00:24:32,575 --> 00:24:36,036
- Watch what you're doing.
- He told me to do it.

382
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:40,450
Ma'am, that shotgun
has a hair trigger.

383
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:43,586
What is that?

384
00:24:43,587 --> 00:24:46,005
- Hey!
- You know who you're fooling with?

385
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:47,798
This is Puff Daddy.

386
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,217
- He the man.
- Wha-? Chill, little man.

387
00:24:50,218 --> 00:24:53,387
This is not the time nor the place
to be a warrior, all right?

388
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:57,391
He's hot.
It's so hot in here he's losing it.

389
00:24:57,392 --> 00:25:02,897
Puffy is rough, he is tough,
and he will kick your ass, west side!

390
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:07,436
Hey, hey, hey, you raised in
a frigging sewer with a mouth like that?

391
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:09,446
Parents don't teach you nothing?

392
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:13,033
I got a gun, man. What the hell
are you thinking? Use your head.

393
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:17,334
Son, that gun can put a hollow-point
through a 2-inch steel plate at 50 yards.

394
00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:20,165
- I'd do what he says.
- Okay.

395
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:24,466
Give me what you got in that thing.
Come on.

396
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:31,510
Sixteen bucks.
I don't believe this shit.

397
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:34,555
All you got in here is 16 bucks.

398
00:25:34,556 --> 00:25:38,856
Check back after Labor Day.
That's our big weekend.

399
00:25:39,478 --> 00:25:43,778
Rodrigo, check it out.

400
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,405
<i>We're on Candid-frigging-Camera.</i>

401
00:25:50,406 --> 00:25:53,032
Sal, whipped cream.

402
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:57,333
Take care of it.

403
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:01,166
You told me to do it.

404
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:04,628
When I say take care of the camera...

405
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:08,929
...this is what I mean.

406
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:18,225
He's...

407
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:21,478
He lies. He's just...

408
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,523
- He's just an idiot, you know?
- Yes, ma'am.

409
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:28,736
And I try really hard.

410
00:26:28,737 --> 00:26:33,037
Chew?

411
00:26:37,913 --> 00:26:42,213
- Here you go.
- It's better if you don't swallow it.

412
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:46,171
It's good, ain't it?

413
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:50,472
Let me see the purse.
Let me see the purse.

414
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:00,894
Somebody got the jumbo pack.

415
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:05,023
- Hey, let's see the ring.
- Come on, man, leave her ring alone.

416
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:09,111
- Who are you now? Beverly Hills cop?
- No, I'm not a Hills cop.

417
00:27:09,112 --> 00:27:12,531
Look. Look at her. The ring
probably ain't even real anyway.

418
00:27:12,532 --> 00:27:15,034
- Yes, it is real.
- Would you work with me?

419
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:17,620
Give me the ring.

420
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:21,921
Okay, fine. It's insured.

421
00:27:23,252 --> 00:27:27,552
Check out leatherhead.

422
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:34,304
<i>- Come on, empty the pockets.
- They are empty.</i>

423
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:37,307
<i>- He says they're empty.
- Sal!</i>

424
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:39,267
I don't trust him, man.

425
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:44,014
Look, bro, why don't you just minimize
all the pain and quit with the antics.

426
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:47,859
Just ask him about the safe.

427
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,445
- They got a safe?
- I know they got a safe.

428
00:27:50,446 --> 00:27:53,157
Show me the safe.

429
00:27:53,158 --> 00:27:56,035
I swear to God,
I waste him if you don't.

430
00:27:56,036 --> 00:27:58,787
Oh, that'll teach me.

431
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:03,088
Okay, how about her?

432
00:28:06,088 --> 00:28:09,715
<i>Come on, man, be easy with the gun.
You see the girl is scared.</i>

433
00:28:09,716 --> 00:28:13,553
You never shut up?
Is that why your old lady dumped you?

434
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:17,599
Actually, she said he was an egotistical,
self-centred jackass.

435
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,900
- She did not say all that.
- I'm paraphrasing.

436
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:28,652
I told you, Trina. He had money.

437
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:32,953
I guess I can break that 50
for you now.

438
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:38,125
You got 50?

439
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:42,708
- Hey, you want a bag for all that?
- Yeah, please.

440
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:47,009
Get it, Trina.

441
00:28:49,132 --> 00:28:51,926
- Shit, the cops.
- What?

442
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:53,469
Who called the cops?

443
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,763
- Who called the frigging cops?
- He did.

444
00:28:55,764 --> 00:28:59,267
No- Well, yeah, I did call the cops
when my car got jacked.

445
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:01,310
Why the hell did you
come in here today?

446
00:29:01,311 --> 00:29:03,146
I didn't know it was stick-up day.

447
00:29:03,147 --> 00:29:06,357
- We're going to jail, Rodrigo.
- Shut up! Nobody's going to jail.

448
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:09,652
We'll get rid of the cop.
Just pretend we're in line, all right?

449
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:13,907
Just be cool. Don't try nothing,
or I put a bullet in his back.

450
00:29:13,908 --> 00:29:15,659
Okay, in everybody's back!

451
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,453
- I have to get out of here.
- You're not going anywhere.

452
00:29:18,454 --> 00:29:21,790
Check out those Doritos
over there. Go!

453
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,291
Just keep reading.

454
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:24,793
- Hey, kid.
- What?

455
00:29:24,794 --> 00:29:26,753
- Play that game some more.
- Fine.

456
00:29:26,754 --> 00:29:30,966
- Trina, fix up one of them hot dogs.
- Hot dogs ain't done yet.

457
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:33,761
Throw the frigging thing
in the microwave.

458
00:29:33,762 --> 00:29:36,430
- Do it, Trina.
- I can't do it. I can't do it!

459
00:29:36,431 --> 00:29:37,973
Just don't look at him.

460
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:42,274
You'll be all right
if you don't look at him.

461
00:29:46,817 --> 00:29:51,117
- Howdy, Jack.
- Hello, Beau.

462
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,098
Which one of you
has got the stolen car?

463
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:18,925
- Yeah. You must be Rick.
- Deputy Beaumont.

464
00:30:20,226 --> 00:30:23,729
Wilma told me to tell you " hey. "

465
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:28,030
Did she?

466
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,117
All right, I got some paperwork, if you
wanna follow me out to the cruiser.

467
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:40,246
Yeah, I would love to follow you-
You know what? I can't right now.

468
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:42,081
I can't even do it.

469
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:46,626
I gotta stay in here, back in line,
where the other people are...

470
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:48,671
...because they were witnesses.

471
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:52,972
Are you two together?

472
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,973
No. Matter of fact,
I don't even know him.

473
00:30:57,974 --> 00:31:00,892
How you doing, man?
Mike. Mike Dawson.

474
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:04,855
How you doing?

475
00:31:04,856 --> 00:31:07,941
All right. I'll tell you what.

476
00:31:07,942 --> 00:31:11,028
I'll go out to the car,
and I'll get some forms...

477
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:15,329
...and I'll come back in,
we can discuss it however you like.

478
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:20,287
I think he bought it.

479
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:24,041
<i>Yeah, sure. He sees a black man
buying douche every day.</i>

480
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:30,460
How in perdition can you call him out
when he dropped the dadgum ball?

481
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:33,760
Yeah?

482
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:35,762
No, it's the mayor.

483
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:37,555
Rick Beaumont.

484
00:31:37,556 --> 00:31:41,856
What is it, Beau?

485
00:31:43,813 --> 00:31:48,066
He ain't buying it, Rodrigo.
Rodrigo, he ain't buying it.

486
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:50,777
What's he doing in there?

487
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:54,156
He's probably wondering
why we looking so ridiculous.

488
00:31:54,157 --> 00:31:58,457
- What am I supposed to be doing?
- I don't know.

489
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,830
Buy something.

490
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:06,131
How am I supposed to pay for it?

491
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:12,930
I still can't break that 50.

492
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:17,685
Will there be anything else?

493
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:21,976
Horace!

494
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:24,979
I got an emergency. You're gonna
have to take over as coach.

495
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,280
Okay. What do I do?

496
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,946
Take it easy on him.

497
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:35,782
This is my home phone number.
If my girl answers, man...

498
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:37,868
...hang the phone up.
I don't wanna d-

499
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:40,037
All right, Mr. Dawson, that's plenty.

500
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:41,997
I'll go get this on the horn...

501
00:32:41,998 --> 00:32:46,298
...and we'll see
what we can't come up with.

502
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:52,805
- Mary.
- Richard.

503
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:07,069
He bought it.

504
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:13,743
Just kidding.

505
00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:24,249
Oh, shit!

506
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:28,550
The cop set us up.

507
00:33:30,715 --> 00:33:35,015
He brought the whole frigging town.

508
00:33:35,178 --> 00:33:39,478
The crate! The crate!

509
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:46,647
- Leave the damn crate.
- No, no, no! Help me!

510
00:33:46,648 --> 00:33:49,150
- Let's go.
- No, no. We can't leave him.

511
00:33:49,151 --> 00:33:52,069
We got the money. Go!

512
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,370
No, no! Trina!

513
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:03,169
Damn it, Beau,
watch where you're going.

514
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:19,394
Get him, boys.

515
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:32,491
- Those guys are crazy.
- No shit.

516
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,072
You fellas hold off.

517
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:39,243
Ain't no point in shooting up
public property if it ain't necessary.

518
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:43,414
Public property, my ass.
I own this place.

519
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:47,710
This is Sheriff Eli Pembry
of North Butte County.

520
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:51,005
We've got you surrounded,
so you might just well give up...

521
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,007
...before this thing gets out of hand.

522
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,010
No, no, forget it.

523
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,469
Forget it, man!

524
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,847
Nobody out here wants to hurt you.

525
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:00,390
Forget it, man!

526
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:02,434
- You gringos is crazy!
- I got you.

527
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:03,852
I got you dead, dirtbag.

528
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:08,153
We just want you to walk out nice
and slow, give yourself up.

529
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:12,152
- That's it. Keep coming.
- Yeah, I got you.

530
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:16,453
I'm a hostage!

531
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:22,872
Give me that.

532
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:26,626
All you other peckerwoods,
don't fire unless you're fired upon!

533
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:30,927
- Man, those rednecks are crazy.
- No shit.

534
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:36,386
Back off!

535
00:35:36,387 --> 00:35:40,014
<i>Back off, or I start
throwing out bodies!</i>

536
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,683
All right!

537
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:45,984
Somebody get me the book!

538
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:50,233
It's got all the answers.

539
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:54,534
- Careful, careful.
- Here.

540
00:36:00,703 --> 00:36:04,498
Let's see here.

541
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:08,544
Ted, I need food and coffee.

542
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:10,546
- ASAP.
- Right.

543
00:36:10,547 --> 00:36:14,675
I need the blueprints for this store,
and I need them yesterday.

544
00:36:14,676 --> 00:36:16,218
Yes, sir.

545
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:20,597
Dale, go down to the surplus store...

546
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:23,476
...and see what they've got
in the way of tear gas.

547
00:36:23,477 --> 00:36:25,019
- Gas?
- Come on.

548
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,688
- Beau.
- Yes, sir?

549
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:30,442
Call the chief of police in Vegas.
He's an old fishing buddy of mine.

550
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:33,278
- Tell him we need a SWAT team.
- You got it.

551
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:39,152
And will somebody kindly find out
who's winning the damn ball game?

552
00:36:56,344 --> 00:36:59,847
Beverly Hills cop,
you're coming with me.

553
00:36:59,848 --> 00:37:02,725
Hold on. You don't understand.
We're both minorities.

554
00:37:02,726 --> 00:37:05,645
- Why don't you shut up.
- This ain't the Rainbow Coalition.

555
00:37:05,646 --> 00:37:07,355
- They gonna shoot us-
- Shut up!

556
00:37:07,356 --> 00:37:11,656
He's got a gun.

557
00:37:12,444 --> 00:37:15,697
You're the sheriff? Oh, shit.

558
00:37:15,698 --> 00:37:20,407
You know, you're turning into
one major pain in the ass for me, son.

559
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:23,163
What the hell did you do to him?

560
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:24,873
I didn't do nothing to him.

561
00:37:24,874 --> 00:37:28,794
The hell he didn't.
He struck out my best hitter...

562
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:31,004
...with two outs
and the bases loaded.

563
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:33,006
Oh, now he's your best hitter.

564
00:37:33,007 --> 00:37:36,635
- You ain't worth nothing as a hostage.
- What did I tell you?

565
00:37:36,636 --> 00:37:39,722
- I gotta get in line to shoot you.
- Well, take a number.

566
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:41,765
Okay, listen up!

567
00:37:41,766 --> 00:37:44,518
You get those hicks over here
to move this crate!

568
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:48,819
Man, don't call them hicks.

569
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:57,782
While you're in there,
see how many hostages he's got...

570
00:37:57,783 --> 00:38:02,083
...and how many guns.

571
00:38:03,747 --> 00:38:05,498
- Ready?
- On three.

572
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:09,169
- One, two-
- No way, compadre.

573
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,423
You guys ain't coming in here
with no guns.

574
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:17,135
Make them take those belts off!

575
00:38:17,136 --> 00:38:21,436
- All right, take them off.
- ... call up a SWAT team.

576
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:25,686
Okay. Now, everybody...

577
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:28,230
- ... no pants.
- No pants?

578
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:31,775
- I don't want no surprises.
- That's a surprise.

579
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,945
Nobody comes in here with pants on.

580
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:39,246
Do it.

581
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:50,675
No shirts, neither.

582
00:38:55,718 --> 00:39:00,018
Do it.

583
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:04,643
Oh, no. Sheriff, I gotta
get out of here, man.

584
00:39:04,644 --> 00:39:09,555
Look, my name is Mike Dawson.
My girlfriend's name is Rae Swanson.

585
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:13,360
- She was on her way to the airport.
- Wait a minute. Mike Dawson?

586
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:15,571
Are you that boxer?

587
00:39:15,572 --> 00:39:18,032
No, no. That's Mike Tyson.

588
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:21,243
Are you sure?
You look something like him.

589
00:39:21,244 --> 00:39:25,544
Well, since then, I lost a lot of weight,
and I'm a vegetarian. Come on, man.

590
00:39:25,749 --> 00:39:27,792
That's Mike Tyson?

591
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:30,252
- I thought he was in jail.
- Excuse me.

592
00:39:30,253 --> 00:39:34,507
Can I say something, please?

593
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:36,968
Hello, sheriff.

594
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:38,761
Hello, Mary.

595
00:39:38,762 --> 00:39:43,424
Could you let Sonny know that I might
be a little late getting home tonight?

596
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:46,603
Yes, ma'am. We'll do it right away.

597
00:39:46,604 --> 00:39:49,022
Go tell Sonny what's going on.

598
00:39:49,023 --> 00:39:53,323
You know where to find him.

599
00:39:54,278 --> 00:39:58,578
Sorry to bother y'all.

600
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:03,078
Anybody else got some movies
to return or something real important?

601
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:05,914
All right, son, just calm down.

602
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:10,215
Come on, bring it in!

603
00:40:11,004 --> 00:40:15,304
Watch it. Watch the curb.

604
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,347
- You got someplace cold?
- In the freezer.

605
00:40:21,348 --> 00:40:25,101
- Take it in back.
- Oh, slow down, slow down.

606
00:40:25,102 --> 00:40:29,402
SWAT team's on its way, sheriff.

607
00:40:43,746 --> 00:40:47,416
Hey, grab me a Dove bar.

608
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:49,960
Can you get a two-shot
of the sheriff and me?

609
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:54,261
- I wanna use the cars as a backdrop.
- I think you're gonna want this.

610
00:40:58,762 --> 00:41:03,062
Oh, man. We got the frigging
TV news too?

611
00:41:06,395 --> 00:41:10,356
Hey, I thought that thing was only
hooked up to the security camera.

612
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:12,817
<i>Well, I gotta keep up
with General Hospital.</i>

613
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:14,944
Yeah. That's a good show.

614
00:41:14,945 --> 00:41:16,654
<i>- store in North Butte.</i>

615
00:41:16,655 --> 00:41:19,032
<i>The information we have
is still sk etchy, but-</i>

616
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:22,702
<i>Wait a minute. One of the suspects
is approaching the door...</i>

617
00:41:22,703 --> 00:41:25,288
<i>...possibly to surrender to police.</i>

618
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:29,589
Gunfire!

619
00:41:37,552 --> 00:41:41,852
Mary!

620
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,658
Hold your fire!

621
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:04,959
- I've been hit! Oh, damn!
- Oh, they frigging shot him, man.

622
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,711
Hold your fire!

623
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:16,012
Hold your fire!

624
00:42:23,725 --> 00:42:26,977
- Hold me.
- It's okay, Michael.

625
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:30,689
I haven't been with a white girl before.
It's okay. It's the last minutes.

626
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:34,985
- Nobody will know.
- It's okay. It doesn't look that bad.

627
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:36,862
- It looks bad.
- It does, my brother?

628
00:42:36,863 --> 00:42:39,490
- You gotta get that shit cleaned out.
- I know I do.

629
00:42:39,491 --> 00:42:42,952
Oh, okay. How about some alcohol
to clean it?

630
00:42:42,953 --> 00:42:47,282
Jack, what the hell's going on in there?
You got any casualties?

631
00:42:51,545 --> 00:42:54,339
You need a doctor in there?

632
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,007
Be strong.

633
00:42:56,008 --> 00:43:00,635
- It looks real bad now.
- I know it does.

634
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,730
You know, sometimes warriors
get nipped in the heat of battle.

635
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:09,312
- Carry on, my Caucasoidian brother.
- Some warrior.

636
00:43:09,313 --> 00:43:12,357
- Peace. Be still.
- Okay, maybe I should get some ice.

637
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:14,109
I can't feel my legs.

638
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,069
<i>Icing could damage the optic nerve...</i>

639
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:19,031
...if there's a fluid build-up
in the ocular cavity.

640
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:22,201
- My cavities are filled.
- Okay, then what should we do?

641
00:43:22,202 --> 00:43:25,079
<i>First, we've gotta determine
if the eye is dislocated...</i>

642
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,248
...or merely protruding
from the socket.

643
00:43:27,249 --> 00:43:30,334
That might be hard. He always
looked a little cockeyed to me.

644
00:43:30,335 --> 00:43:33,963
- You got a sterile cloth?
- How sterile?

645
00:43:33,964 --> 00:43:36,549
- Okay. Who's got steady hands?
- Let me.

646
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,385
Wait a minute, man. I've seen this.
I've been to jail.

647
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:41,429
I know what y'all trying to do.

648
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,766
- I think I feel some peewee action.
- Forceps.

649
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,067
Do good.

650
00:43:55,069 --> 00:43:59,369
- Oh, my God.
- A hunk of glass?

651
00:43:59,824 --> 00:44:03,910
- Dorito.
- Barbecue or Cool Ranch?

652
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:06,371
Cool Ranch.

653
00:44:06,372 --> 00:44:08,874
What kind of gun shoots...

654
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:12,753
...Doritos?

655
00:44:12,754 --> 00:44:14,964
<i>According to police sources,
Mik e Tyson-</i>

656
00:44:14,965 --> 00:44:17,299
<i>That's right, the former
heavyweight champion.</i>

657
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,009
<i>- is at this moment engaged...</i>

658
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,971
<i>...in the fight of his life
inside this convenience store.</i>

659
00:44:21,972 --> 00:44:24,015
<i>Tyson is believed to be a hostage...</i>

660
00:44:24,016 --> 00:44:27,518
What can I get you, honey?

661
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,521
Just a cup of coffee, please.

662
00:44:30,522 --> 00:44:34,817
You look like you could use something
stronger than a cup of coffee.

663
00:44:34,818 --> 00:44:37,028
Oh, no. I don't drink hard liquor.

664
00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:39,447
Oh, no, now, all right. Let me guess.

665
00:44:39,448 --> 00:44:43,991
He dumped you for some young thing
with a loose top and a tight bottom.

666
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:48,582
Well, no. Actually, it was a car.

667
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:50,917
Sounds like my second husband.

668
00:44:50,918 --> 00:44:54,379
Oh, he had a thing for cars?

669
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:00,051
No, he had a thing for prison movies
and young boys.

670
00:45:01,554 --> 00:45:05,854
Hurt just the same.

671
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:21,074
Sheriff! Sheriff, emergency call.

672
00:45:21,075 --> 00:45:22,617
Yeah?

673
00:45:22,618 --> 00:45:26,287
No, you're gonna have to speak up.

674
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:29,374
Tell Jeremy to keep his pitches low.

675
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:33,675
Johnson is a sucker for a low ball.

676
00:45:37,925 --> 00:45:41,595
Howard? Alice? What the hell
are you two doing here?

677
00:45:41,596 --> 00:45:45,390
I understand that you've got
Mike Tyson in there.

678
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:49,645
I'd like to tell him that I lost a bundle
on that Douglas fight.

679
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:53,946
Yeah.

680
00:45:55,444 --> 00:45:59,744
But when you're pulling
a potato chip out your ass...

681
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:03,951
...it just puts everything
in perspective.

682
00:46:03,952 --> 00:46:07,997
The Moki Indians of Peru
believe that a near-death experience...

683
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:11,584
...cleanses the spirit
and imparts worldly wisdom...

684
00:46:11,585 --> 00:46:15,915
...otherwise gained only through
vast years of intensive struggle.

685
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:23,059
Of course, they also eat bugs
and sacrifice virgins.

686
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,103
Ever eaten a bug?

687
00:46:30,104 --> 00:46:34,404
I had a bug-eyed virgin.

688
00:46:46,413 --> 00:46:50,713
Jack, Jack. Come on.

689
00:46:51,168 --> 00:46:55,468
Do you mind playing
something else, man?

690
00:47:01,345 --> 00:47:03,847
Think I got it, sheriff.

691
00:47:03,848 --> 00:47:08,148
Well, let's give it to them.

692
00:47:10,563 --> 00:47:14,863
Wait. I think this is it.

693
00:47:18,279 --> 00:47:22,579
Somebody shoot that harmonica.

694
00:47:26,746 --> 00:47:31,046
- Hey.
- Hey.

695
00:47:32,669 --> 00:47:36,969
We gonna do this today?

696
00:47:39,676 --> 00:47:42,053
There go the Dove bars.

697
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:46,354
Yeah!

698
00:47:48,894 --> 00:47:52,063
Well, what now, sheriff?

699
00:47:52,064 --> 00:47:54,023
We wait.

700
00:47:54,024 --> 00:47:59,399
<i>You'd think that cutting the power
would have a little more effect at night.</i>

701
00:48:00,114 --> 00:48:02,073
That's true.

702
00:48:02,074 --> 00:48:05,744
Where the hell is my SWAT team?!

703
00:48:05,745 --> 00:48:10,045
Where the hell is North Butte?

704
00:48:17,257 --> 00:48:19,842
Big J- J, money. You-

705
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:24,256
Do you mind? I mean,
do you know some other songs?

706
00:48:24,514 --> 00:48:26,891
- I know plenty.
- Thanks.

707
00:48:26,892 --> 00:48:31,192
I like one.

708
00:48:46,078 --> 00:48:50,378
Come on, Jack, go with me.

709
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:27,245
You want music? Go to church!

710
00:49:27,246 --> 00:49:31,546
I got a tape right here, sheriff.

711
00:49:33,252 --> 00:49:35,962
What's on the list, Beau?

712
00:49:35,963 --> 00:49:40,875
Well, it says here the next step
is to negotiate.

713
00:49:48,726 --> 00:49:53,353
We are ready to listen
to your demands.

714
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:58,324
What do you want?

715
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:00,988
What the hell did he say?

716
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:05,698
Maybe you could hear him
if you hadn't cut off the power.

717
00:50:07,246 --> 00:50:09,038
That was pretty stupid, sheriff.

718
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,339
I mean, how are we
supposed to talk to him now?

719
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:38,365
Y'all, Clute's coming.

720
00:50:42,866 --> 00:50:45,284
And he ain't wearing no pants.

721
00:50:45,285 --> 00:50:46,994
You in there.

722
00:50:46,995 --> 00:50:51,491
<i>I'm sending in one of our bullhorns
to re-establish communication.</i>

723
00:50:52,709 --> 00:50:54,835
Remember,
it's government property...

724
00:50:54,836 --> 00:50:59,136
...and you're responsible
for its safe return.

725
00:51:00,634 --> 00:51:03,678
- You press the button-
- I know how to use it, all right?

726
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:06,431
Hey!

727
00:51:06,432 --> 00:51:09,059
Damn.

728
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,360
Get your ass back there. Go!

729
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:25,284
That kid's lucky I didn't execute
his dumb ass.

730
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:28,328
Next time, I ain't gonna be
so generous, huh?

731
00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:30,414
You wanna shoot at somebody, huh?

732
00:51:30,415 --> 00:51:32,041
Michael, where are you going?

733
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:36,342
Michael, get back here.

734
00:51:36,713 --> 00:51:39,173
You're not gonna shoot me, man.

735
00:51:39,174 --> 00:51:41,384
I can see it in your eyes.

736
00:51:41,385 --> 00:51:44,011
Michael.

737
00:51:44,012 --> 00:51:48,312
Oh, my God.

738
00:51:50,561 --> 00:51:54,861
You got lying eyes.

739
00:51:55,566 --> 00:51:57,442
What are you shooting at in there?

740
00:51:57,443 --> 00:51:59,277
- You wanna be a terrorist?
- No, no.

741
00:51:59,278 --> 00:52:01,237
You got your chance.
Come on. Come on.

742
00:52:01,238 --> 00:52:03,573
- What are you doing?
- We about to negotiate.

743
00:52:03,574 --> 00:52:07,160
Okay, but- Okay. You talk to him.

744
00:52:07,161 --> 00:52:09,955
Sheriff. Look, I'm sick of this, man.

745
00:52:09,956 --> 00:52:13,250
I've been robbed, kidnapped, shot at.

746
00:52:13,251 --> 00:52:15,544
I could've stayed in Chicago
for this shit.

747
00:52:15,545 --> 00:52:19,590
All your trigger-happy Boss Hogg ass
can do is turn off the air conditioning.

748
00:52:19,591 --> 00:52:22,009
I'm running out of time.

749
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,303
What do you want, Tyson?

750
00:52:24,304 --> 00:52:27,223
Okay. He'll release
all of the hostages...

751
00:52:27,224 --> 00:52:31,102
...if you provide transportation
to the Las Vegas airport by 6.

752
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,770
What are you talking about?

753
00:52:32,771 --> 00:52:34,856
You need to get to Mexico, right?

754
00:52:34,857 --> 00:52:36,232
I need to get to Rae.

755
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:39,277
- All right?
- Okay, listen up!

756
00:52:39,278 --> 00:52:41,571
Somebody is going with me.

757
00:52:41,572 --> 00:52:44,365
Somebody besides him!

758
00:52:44,366 --> 00:52:46,701
That's humorous. Listen.

759
00:52:46,702 --> 00:52:48,662
He needs to get two plane tickets...

760
00:52:48,663 --> 00:52:51,998
...and we need to get transportation
to the Vegas airport by 6.

761
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:56,044
If he don't get all that, if he don't get
his demands met, then...

762
00:52:56,045 --> 00:52:58,463
- We all die?
- Then we all die.

763
00:52:58,464 --> 00:53:01,091
Yeah! Everybody dies!

764
00:53:01,092 --> 00:53:04,803
- Six o'clock, and I take this and:
- No, no.

765
00:53:04,804 --> 00:53:08,682
- Brains everywhere! I'm serious!
- They know you're serious.

766
00:53:08,683 --> 00:53:13,180
- Blood and guts. Serious shit!
- He's just hot. It's hot. It's real hot.

767
00:53:14,773 --> 00:53:17,983
Find out how much
all this is gonna cost.

768
00:53:17,984 --> 00:53:22,284
Right.

769
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,292
Look, look.

770
00:53:34,293 --> 00:53:36,378
This is our first trip together.

771
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:40,298
You know what I didn't realize?
She'd never been on a plane, right?

772
00:53:40,299 --> 00:53:43,468
So I sit there with her, and I say,
"Order whatever you want. "

773
00:53:43,469 --> 00:53:47,014
She sees the flight-attendant button
with the little speaker by it...

774
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,475
...so she goes:

775
00:53:50,476 --> 00:53:52,352
" Could I get a Diet Coke?"

776
00:53:52,353 --> 00:53:54,146
So everybody starts laughing...

777
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,732
...but I'm like,
I'm gonna let her off the hook.

778
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,319
She sits there, and the Diet Coke
ain't came, so she goes:

779
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,697
"These people. I said,
could I get a Diet Coke, please. "

780
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,411
And it was just hilarious, man.
You know, she was just so innocent.

781
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:11,789
Why were they laughing?

782
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,958
Yeah, I'm not even wasting my time.

783
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:17,253
That's my little Rae, man.
Little ray of sunshine.

784
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,006
That's really pretty. Where is that?

785
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,050
- It's Mexico.
- Yeah.

786
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:23,968
It's Topolobampo.

787
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,970
Damn, brother.

788
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,224
- You're a travelling man.
- No, I was born there.

789
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:30,767
How do you say it?

790
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:33,353
Topolobampo.

791
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:35,063
Never heard of it.

792
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:38,692
It's a small port city,
20 miles south of Las Mochis.

793
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:42,362
It's known for its temperate climate
and guava-bean exports.

794
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:46,158
Oh, really?

795
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:48,702
Yeah.

796
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:51,163
We'd only been seeing each other
a couple weeks.

797
00:54:51,164 --> 00:54:55,464
We hadn't even known each other
that long, you know?

798
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:00,339
I'm telling you, Gloria,
we were like-

799
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,508
We were, like, the perfect fit.

800
00:55:02,509 --> 00:55:05,428
The first night we were together,
man... Oh, man.

801
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:07,513
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

802
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:11,392
And we could just talk for hours
and hours about everything.

803
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:15,693
She would talk for hours
about nothing.

804
00:55:17,817 --> 00:55:21,486
<i>- But I didn't mind listening.
- Hello in there.</i>

805
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:25,699
We've got ourselves a little bit
of a problem out here.

806
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:30,000
Michael, come on.

807
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:36,043
What problem?

808
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:40,256
Well, what with the cost
of putting up the new scoreboard...

809
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:42,800
...and fiscal cutbacks...

810
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:47,593
...the mayor says that there's no way
that we can charter a plane.

811
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:50,516
We can send you on a bus, though.

812
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:53,519
It goes down through Nogales
and Yuma.

813
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,023
It's a lot of pretty scenery
down there.

814
00:55:57,024 --> 00:56:01,324
- How about first-class seats?
- It's a damn bus.

815
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:05,156
I guess we could put you closer
to the crapper or something.

816
00:56:05,157 --> 00:56:08,785
What about dinner?

817
00:56:08,786 --> 00:56:13,086
Is there a meal?

818
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:18,508
Got a brochure here, sheriff.

819
00:56:21,758 --> 00:56:27,298
"A delicious portion
of mesquite-roasted longhorn steaks...

820
00:56:27,556 --> 00:56:31,559
...smothered in a colourful
vegetable melody...

821
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:36,720
...baked potato or rice pilaf. "
Boy, that sounds good.

822
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,902
Okay. I'll go.

823
00:56:40,903 --> 00:56:44,405
- That's cool.
- Okay, Tyson, you got a deal.

824
00:56:44,406 --> 00:56:47,158
- We got a deal.
- Agreed.

825
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:48,660
Wait. Hey.

826
00:56:48,661 --> 00:56:52,122
Wait. One more thing.

827
00:56:52,123 --> 00:56:55,875
I need a dozen roses-
No, make that two dozen roses...

828
00:56:55,876 --> 00:57:00,176
...sent to the Vegas airport right now.

829
00:57:01,466 --> 00:57:05,766
Find out how much
that's gonna cost.

830
00:57:06,262 --> 00:57:09,932
So why come in here
and rob a convenience store?

831
00:57:09,933 --> 00:57:12,851
There ain't no money in that.
Why don't you go to a bank?

832
00:57:12,852 --> 00:57:15,938
Oh, yeah. Like I'm very good
at this shit.

833
00:57:15,939 --> 00:57:17,481
You could've fooled me.

834
00:57:17,482 --> 00:57:19,650
You come in here
waving your gun and shit.

835
00:57:19,651 --> 00:57:22,903
Billy Badass, "Okay, nobody move!"

836
00:57:22,904 --> 00:57:25,740
I thought you was doing it.

837
00:57:25,741 --> 00:57:28,618
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

838
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:32,288
- This is my first time.
- No. Get out. You used to...

839
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:34,874
Man, you on your way.

840
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:39,175
- How much did this tear gas cost?
- It was sort of free.

841
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,640
Good job, Dale.

842
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:58,148
- Sheriff, Dale's back.
- Get any tear gas?

843
00:57:58,149 --> 00:58:02,027
- Well, sort of.
- Sort of?

844
00:58:02,028 --> 00:58:05,114
Clute, buddy. I got an important job
for you. Come with me.

845
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:06,907
Me and you, baby. Dream team.

846
00:58:06,908 --> 00:58:11,208
The hell does that mean? "Sort of"?

847
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:14,540
That's a nice gun, Dale.

848
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:17,460
Looks mighty powerful.

849
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:20,254
- Clute.
- Sheriff's orders.

850
00:58:20,255 --> 00:58:23,174
<i>Clute, how's it coming?</i>

851
00:58:23,175 --> 00:58:26,010
<i>- What's that, sheriff?
- What is your status?</i>

852
00:58:26,011 --> 00:58:28,471
The fuse is lit.

853
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:32,802
I repeat, the fuse has been lit.

854
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,687
How long is this gonna take?

855
00:58:35,688 --> 00:58:38,565
Well, I really have no idea.

856
00:58:38,566 --> 00:58:42,277
Where the hell is my SWAT team?

857
00:58:42,278 --> 00:58:46,198
Who ordered the burrito
with extra cheese?

858
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:50,369
What's your day job?
I mean, what did you do before this?

859
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,371
- Migrant work.
- What?

860
00:58:52,372 --> 00:58:55,624
- Migrant work.
- Migrant work.

861
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:58,461
- Really?
- No, I'm president of Disneyland.

862
00:58:58,462 --> 00:59:01,297
What do you think?

863
00:59:01,298 --> 00:59:05,051
Things weren't going that great
in Mexico...

864
00:59:05,052 --> 00:59:08,304
...so me and my old man
came over here.

865
00:59:08,305 --> 00:59:12,100
Hooked up with a couple
of harvesting companies...

866
00:59:12,101 --> 00:59:16,401
...bent over 10 hours a day
for 2 bucks an hour.

867
00:59:17,815 --> 00:59:22,276
You just work and work and work.

868
00:59:24,614 --> 00:59:28,914
Then you die.

869
00:59:32,205 --> 00:59:36,505
You're right.

870
00:59:40,297 --> 00:59:43,632
What did you pick?

871
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:46,969
Squash.

872
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:48,929
Beets.

873
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,765
Beets?

874
00:59:50,766 --> 00:59:54,769
- Strawberries.
- Strawberries.

875
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:58,439
- Melons.
- Oh, yeah.

876
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,860
Melons.

877
01:00:01,861 --> 01:00:06,161
I'm way ahead of you.

878
01:00:13,664 --> 01:00:17,964
What?

879
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:36,520
Go! Go! Come on, let's move out.
Come on!

880
01:00:36,521 --> 01:00:40,149
Inside, civilian. Come on!

881
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:44,195
- It's about good goddamn time.
- Sheriff Pembry.

882
01:00:44,196 --> 01:00:46,698
Your order's my order, sir.

883
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:50,999
Give him what he needs, Beau.

884
01:00:51,579 --> 01:00:55,879
What do you need?

885
01:00:59,295 --> 01:01:01,129
- Sonny.
- Hey, Mary. Mary.

886
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:05,430
No, no, no.
Don't do anything stupid, please.

887
01:01:07,637 --> 01:01:11,937
Hi, Sonny.

888
01:01:12,976 --> 01:01:17,887
Got a little bit of a situation here,
Sonny, so make it short, okay?

889
01:01:18,148 --> 01:01:21,692
All right.

890
01:01:21,693 --> 01:01:25,321
How you doing, Mary?

891
01:01:25,322 --> 01:01:28,950
Is he treating you all right?

892
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:32,912
He's treating me fine.
Where were you, Sonny?

893
01:01:32,913 --> 01:01:37,166
I came right over
as soon as Clute told me.

894
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:41,876
- But Clute got back a long time ago.
- Now, Mary, I rushed right over.

895
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,882
Ain't that right, Clute?

896
01:01:43,883 --> 01:01:46,092
He sure did, Mary!

897
01:01:46,093 --> 01:01:48,762
Hey, Clute?

898
01:01:48,763 --> 01:01:50,972
Where was Sonny
when you found him?

899
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:54,851
- Wait just a second, darling, okay?
- I know where you were, Sonny.

900
01:01:54,852 --> 01:01:59,680
What, you think I'm the only person
in the whole town who don't know?

901
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:05,404
Turn that down.

902
01:02:05,405 --> 01:02:08,282
Sweetie, this is a little private,
don't you think?

903
01:02:08,283 --> 01:02:11,619
Don't you even wanna know
why I make you wear them rubbers...

904
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:13,329
...even though I'm on the pill?

905
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:17,208
I don't need to hear that.

906
01:02:17,209 --> 01:02:19,961
You said...

907
01:02:19,962 --> 01:02:23,548
...you wanted to keep the real feeling
special for our wedding.

908
01:02:23,549 --> 01:02:25,633
Oh, grow up, Sonny.

909
01:02:25,634 --> 01:02:29,934
I did it because- Because I know
you're screwing Pamela Ridgeway...

910
01:02:30,097 --> 01:02:32,474
...and I didn't wanna
catch something.

911
01:02:32,475 --> 01:02:35,936
- Now, Mary, you just shut up.
- Hey!

912
01:02:35,937 --> 01:02:38,313
- Hear me?
- Hey, don't talk to her like that!

913
01:02:38,314 --> 01:02:41,733
- Hey, this ain't your fight, boy.
- Hey, don't you yell at him.

914
01:02:41,734 --> 01:02:46,034
I'm sorry.

915
01:02:52,954 --> 01:02:56,457
What?

916
01:02:56,458 --> 01:03:00,758
Good for the goose,
good for the gander.

917
01:03:01,505 --> 01:03:05,424
You know what, Sonny?
I'm going to Mexico.

918
01:03:05,425 --> 01:03:09,725
Bye.

919
01:03:10,514 --> 01:03:14,814
I think you'd better leave, Sonny.

920
01:03:32,036 --> 01:03:36,336
Maybe you want this back.

921
01:03:36,499 --> 01:03:39,752
Man.

922
01:03:39,753 --> 01:03:44,545
You know that Sonny told me
he paid $700 for this thing?

923
01:03:46,009 --> 01:03:47,259
I found the receipt.

924
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:51,560
It was, like, 40 bucks on one of those
television shopping channels.

925
01:03:56,937 --> 01:04:00,398
Do you have any of those television
shopping channels in Mexico?

926
01:04:00,399 --> 01:04:03,776
Because I don't have
anything to wear.

927
01:04:03,777 --> 01:04:08,077
Where I live, we don't have no TV.

928
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:10,867
Oh, but my grandparents have.

929
01:04:10,868 --> 01:04:15,197
<i>Do you guys get General Hospital?
Because I love General Hospital.</i>

930
01:04:15,456 --> 01:04:19,167
We have an animal hospital.
Do you need one?

931
01:04:19,168 --> 01:04:21,378
Waiting on your orders, sir.

932
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:22,921
<i>We're in position.</i>

933
01:04:22,922 --> 01:04:26,758
Sheriff. Looks like the team's here.

934
01:04:26,759 --> 01:04:31,059
What the hell?

935
01:04:32,057 --> 01:04:34,975
What is going on?

936
01:04:34,976 --> 01:04:39,276
Just waiting for your order, sir.

937
01:04:40,273 --> 01:04:44,573
We won! We won!

938
01:04:46,071 --> 01:04:50,371
We're going to the nationals!

939
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:55,001
I'm not reading you too clearly, sir.

940
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,339
Sir, shall I take that shot?

941
01:05:07,135 --> 01:05:11,435
Everybody back in the bus!
Stay down.

942
01:05:17,812 --> 01:05:19,813
- Drop the guns!
- Open the door!

943
01:05:19,814 --> 01:05:23,192
You drop the guns,
or I blow his head off!

944
01:05:23,193 --> 01:05:26,445
What the hell's going on in there?
Sounds like Guadalcanal.

945
01:05:26,446 --> 01:05:30,574
- Sheriff, we got another problem.
- Oh, just one? Things are looking up.

946
01:05:30,575 --> 01:05:34,203
- You know Lola Glaspie?
- The town treasurer. What about her?

947
01:05:34,204 --> 01:05:36,080
You remember last year, she-?

948
01:05:36,081 --> 01:05:39,876
There was a big deal about her
winning the trip to France?

949
01:05:39,877 --> 01:05:42,253
Well, she didn't exactly win the trip.

950
01:05:42,254 --> 01:05:46,554
They got her down at the mayor's office
now confessing up a storm.

951
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:51,137
How much we got?

952
01:05:51,138 --> 01:05:54,140
<i>We don't have enough for the charter
and two dozen roses.</i>

953
01:05:54,141 --> 01:05:56,268
Give it to me straight, Beau.

954
01:05:56,269 --> 01:05:59,604
Well, we can rent a tour bus
for about an hour.

955
01:05:59,605 --> 01:06:01,440
What about the flowers?

956
01:06:01,441 --> 01:06:04,860
Well, there was a funeral
down in Vegas...

957
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:07,863
...and they got an FTD Pick Me Up
Bouquet left over...

958
01:06:07,864 --> 01:06:12,164
...and they said we could have it
for half-price.

959
01:06:12,494 --> 01:06:14,495
I guess that'll have to do.

960
01:06:14,496 --> 01:06:16,872
I told you kids to get down in there!

961
01:06:16,873 --> 01:06:19,000
- Get them kids down.
- Get down. Get down.

962
01:06:19,001 --> 01:06:20,376
Sheriff!

963
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:24,677
Get down, you piece of shit!

964
01:06:24,715 --> 01:06:27,717
I've been straight with you.

965
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:29,802
I didn't hurt nobody in there.

966
01:06:29,803 --> 01:06:32,388
And you send this asshole
to mess with me?

967
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:35,183
Just take it easy.
We made a mistake.

968
01:06:35,184 --> 01:06:38,311
- Damn right you made a mistake.
- You get back inside, Michael.

969
01:06:38,312 --> 01:06:40,438
What are you coming at him
like this for?

970
01:06:40,439 --> 01:06:42,941
You gonna mess around
and get everybody killed.

971
01:06:42,942 --> 01:06:47,242
The bus is on its way right now.

972
01:06:48,197 --> 01:06:52,497
Get the hell out of here.

973
01:06:52,535 --> 01:06:56,080
Just take it easy, son.

974
01:06:56,081 --> 01:07:00,381
I ain't your frigging son.

975
01:07:00,585 --> 01:07:03,754
There's a body in there, sir.

976
01:07:03,755 --> 01:07:06,799
This is getting good.

977
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:11,100
Let it go. Come on, let it go.

978
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:27,450
What the hell?

979
01:07:29,156 --> 01:07:32,617
Get away from him.

980
01:07:32,618 --> 01:07:36,580
Get the hell away from him!

981
01:07:36,581 --> 01:07:40,881
Mary...

982
01:07:57,227 --> 01:08:00,563
Hello.

983
01:08:00,564 --> 01:08:02,064
He's not coming.

984
01:08:02,065 --> 01:08:05,401
Now, trust me, honey,
they always come.

985
01:08:05,402 --> 01:08:09,981
Excuse me, I'm looking for someone
named Rachel who's flying to Chicago.

986
01:08:10,324 --> 01:08:12,867
That's me.

987
01:08:12,868 --> 01:08:15,745
Pretty. Who are they from?

988
01:08:15,746 --> 01:08:19,124
There's a card.

989
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:22,711
Let me see. What's it say?
Let me see. What's it say?

990
01:08:22,712 --> 01:08:28,216
"Our deepest sympathy on the loss
of your loved one. Mike Tyson. "

991
01:08:40,981 --> 01:08:45,281
Answer the phone.

992
01:08:48,322 --> 01:08:52,158
Hello.

993
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:54,452
Yes, he is.

994
01:08:54,453 --> 01:08:57,121
It's for you.

995
01:08:57,122 --> 01:09:01,167
- Is it Rae?
- It's your father.

996
01:09:01,168 --> 01:09:03,378
My father?

997
01:09:03,379 --> 01:09:06,298
Girl, my father is dead.

998
01:09:06,299 --> 01:09:08,842
<i>- Hello.
- Deputy Beaumont.</i>

999
01:09:08,843 --> 01:09:11,136
Oh, Dad. Hey, Daddy.

1000
01:09:11,137 --> 01:09:13,805
When you said "father,"
I thought you meant my priest.

1001
01:09:13,806 --> 01:09:18,106
Yeah, my priest is dead.
God bless him.

1002
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:23,857
- Yeah?
- I know you can't talk freely in there.

1003
01:09:23,858 --> 01:09:26,151
When I ask you a question...

1004
01:09:26,152 --> 01:09:30,452
...I want you to say,
"The weather is fine"...

1005
01:09:30,574 --> 01:09:32,241
<i>...if the answer is yes.</i>

1006
01:09:32,242 --> 01:09:35,286
<i>If the answer is no,
I want you to say:</i>

1007
01:09:35,287 --> 01:09:37,413
" It looks like rain. "

1008
01:09:37,414 --> 01:09:41,084
- You understand?
- Oh, yeah. You know what?

1009
01:09:41,085 --> 01:09:45,088
As a matter of fact,
the sun just popped out.

1010
01:09:45,089 --> 01:09:47,715
<i>Okay. Here's the deal.</i>

1011
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:51,428
We want you to help us
take him down.

1012
01:09:51,429 --> 01:09:54,472
<i>Are you willing to play ball?</i>

1013
01:09:54,473 --> 01:09:58,773
Actually, it's starting
to look like rain.

1014
01:10:00,313 --> 01:10:05,141
Now, you do your part, and we'll make
sure that plane stays on the ground.

1015
01:10:05,818 --> 01:10:08,445
We got a deal?

1016
01:10:08,446 --> 01:10:12,746
The weather is nice.

1017
01:10:14,286 --> 01:10:17,955
Okay. Here's what I want you to do.

1018
01:10:17,956 --> 01:10:20,624
<i>You get him to release
everybody else...</i>

1019
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:22,877
<i>...then I want you to walk out
with him.</i>

1020
01:10:22,878 --> 01:10:24,837
Now, keep your eyes
on the sheriff...

1021
01:10:24,838 --> 01:10:27,089
...because he's gonna ask you
to swing away.

1022
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:29,759
Hand across the hat,
then across the chest.

1023
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,428
When you see him do that,
I want you to hit the dirt.

1024
01:10:32,429 --> 01:10:36,266
And we'll take care of the rest.
You got that?

1025
01:10:36,267 --> 01:10:39,978
Okay. Well, okay.
I'll tell you what, Dad, I'll holler.

1026
01:10:39,979 --> 01:10:44,279
All right. Okay. Bye-bye.

1027
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:48,069
Yeah, that's my dad.

1028
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:52,370
He's an old retired weatherman.

1029
01:10:55,328 --> 01:10:59,206
I want you to take him out
the first shot, Beau.

1030
01:10:59,207 --> 01:11:03,507
- Let's get those kids out of here.
- Yes, sir.

1031
01:11:04,546 --> 01:11:08,846
Well, I'll be damned.

1032
01:11:13,013 --> 01:11:16,349
Hello in there.
We got the bus out here.

1033
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:20,650
It's time for you to live up
to your end of the deal.

1034
01:11:21,647 --> 01:11:25,275
Let's do it.

1035
01:11:25,276 --> 01:11:28,236
- Let's clear these civilians out of here.
- Yes, sir.

1036
01:11:28,237 --> 01:11:30,530
- Folks, I need you all to move back.
- Go.

1037
01:11:30,531 --> 01:11:32,449
Let's move back behind the cars.

1038
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:35,035
For your own safety.
Come on, move it. Let's go.

1039
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:39,497
- What's going on, Eli?
- Just a precautionary measure.

1040
01:11:40,166 --> 01:11:42,668
You want us to move?

1041
01:11:42,669 --> 01:11:46,969
Oh, no, no. You're fine right there.

1042
01:11:52,971 --> 01:11:56,849
Clarence, that's one
you're gonna pay for.

1043
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:59,810
This is yours.

1044
01:11:59,811 --> 01:12:04,111
Thanks.

1045
01:12:06,985 --> 01:12:11,813
For God's sake, Simms, get that-
It's 116 in the shade.

1046
01:12:14,994 --> 01:12:17,328
Wait, wait.

1047
01:12:17,329 --> 01:12:21,629
No guns!

1048
01:12:24,629 --> 01:12:28,929
You heard him. Put them down.

1049
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:33,850
Let's go.

1050
01:12:37,892 --> 01:12:42,192
It's all right, Mary.
It's gonna be all right.

1051
01:12:42,981 --> 01:12:45,107
- Are you okay?
- No, she's not okay.

1052
01:12:45,108 --> 01:12:48,611
- She don't like being around a killer.
- I didn't kill anybody.

1053
01:12:48,612 --> 01:12:51,155
- What about the dead body?
- What about the what?

1054
01:12:51,156 --> 01:12:55,456
The body. The body in the crate.

1055
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,663
It's my father.

1056
01:12:58,664 --> 01:13:02,964
I'm trying to take him back to Mexico.

1057
01:13:07,173 --> 01:13:11,473
Don't stop moving.
Don't stop moving.

1058
01:13:16,307 --> 01:13:18,684
Mary!

1059
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:20,269
- Drop your weapon!
- Drop it!

1060
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,354
- No, no!
- Drop that gun, or I'll fire!

1061
01:13:22,355 --> 01:13:26,655
- I just wanna go back to Mexico.
- Drop your gun now!

1062
01:13:26,818 --> 01:13:29,111
- Wait a minute!
- Move out of the way, Tyson.

1063
01:13:29,112 --> 01:13:30,321
He's not a killer.

1064
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:34,325
If you want us to hold that plane, you'll
move your ass out of the way now.

1065
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:36,577
What's going on, Michael?

1066
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,913
Man, they tried to get me
to set you up.

1067
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:42,834
They did a pretty good job.

1068
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:47,046
Okay, leave him alone!

1069
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:48,256
Oh, hell.

1070
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,466
Mary, you drop that weapon
and back away!

1071
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:52,093
He's got a dead body in there.

1072
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:57,599
I know. It's his father,
and he's trying to take him home.

1073
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:02,729
That don't seem to make a difference.
He's under arrest anyway.

1074
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,732
- Come on, for what charge?
- Well, for attempted murder.

1075
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:08,819
For that shot he took at you.

1076
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:10,988
If you charge him
with attempted murder...

1077
01:14:10,989 --> 01:14:15,289
...then you gotta charge him too
with his Barney Fife ass.

1078
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:20,544
All right, men,
put away your weapons.

1079
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:30,967
What is it you want, Tyson?

1080
01:14:30,968 --> 01:14:32,468
I want what you promised.

1081
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:36,097
I need to get this dude to Mexico
so he can take care of his father.

1082
01:14:36,098 --> 01:14:39,601
<i>We can't do that.
We don't have enough money.</i>

1083
01:14:39,602 --> 01:14:41,644
You don't have
enough money? What?

1084
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:43,897
Look at all these tax-paying citizens.

1085
01:14:43,898 --> 01:14:47,025
You got some money in here.
Come on, don't bullshit me.

1086
01:14:47,026 --> 01:14:51,326
- Town's broke.
- We are not!

1087
01:14:53,157 --> 01:14:55,534
Fifty.

1088
01:14:55,535 --> 01:14:58,453
- Oh, come on, Tyson. Don't do this!
- That's 50.

1089
01:14:58,454 --> 01:15:02,754
That's a start. Anybody else?

1090
01:15:11,218 --> 01:15:12,718
- You the man.
- Give me some.

1091
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,136
Good boy, Rusty.

1092
01:15:14,137 --> 01:15:16,973
There we go. Anybody else?

1093
01:15:16,974 --> 01:15:19,767
I got 50. Fifty and the 5 and the 50-

1094
01:15:19,768 --> 01:15:24,068
Well, this has been about as good
as going to a matinée.

1095
01:15:24,356 --> 01:15:27,108
There we go. Thank you, Mr. Bojangles.

1096
01:15:27,109 --> 01:15:29,819
This definitely qualifies
as my rainy day.

1097
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:31,738
Hey, Jack had the money in his shoe.

1098
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:34,491
Now, everybody, please, quickly.
Thank you, people.

1099
01:15:34,492 --> 01:15:37,911
Come, children.
Oh, look at these happy, giving faces.

1100
01:15:37,912 --> 01:15:40,288
Come on down, come hither,
feel the love.

1101
01:15:40,289 --> 01:15:43,375
Yes. I'm liking that.

1102
01:15:43,376 --> 01:15:46,003
Sheriff, all I need
is one more favour.

1103
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:50,304
I need to get a ride to that airport.

1104
01:15:56,014 --> 01:16:00,314
Won't do you any good.

1105
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:05,314
We didn't hold the plane.

1106
01:16:05,315 --> 01:16:08,484
So you just straight up lied.

1107
01:16:08,485 --> 01:16:12,785
It's in the book.

1108
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:16,117
<i>Flight 664 to Chicago is now boarding.</i>

1109
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:19,662
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

1110
01:16:19,663 --> 01:16:21,581
He's not coming.

1111
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:23,166
I'm sorry, honey.

1112
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:26,795
Oh, yeah, that's okay.
Thanks, Gloria.

1113
01:16:26,796 --> 01:16:29,840
Bye-bye, baby. Here.
Don't forget your flowers. Here you go.

1114
01:16:29,841 --> 01:16:32,968
Thanks. I'll see you.

1115
01:16:32,969 --> 01:16:37,269
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1116
01:16:40,393 --> 01:16:43,729
Good luck to you, son.

1117
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:46,232
- I think I owe you one.
- Don't worry about it.

1118
01:16:46,233 --> 01:16:48,943
Hey, I'm really sorry
about your girlfriend and all.

1119
01:16:48,944 --> 01:16:51,320
She probably wouldn't take me back
now anyway.

1120
01:16:51,321 --> 01:16:55,032
- Well, then, she'd be a fool.
- You'd think.

1121
01:16:55,033 --> 01:16:59,245
Oh, a little love. Watch this one.
Watch her.

1122
01:16:59,246 --> 01:17:01,289
<i>Okay. If you're ever in Mexico...</i>

1123
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:04,250
<i>If you're ever in Chicago
robbing a convenience store...</i>

1124
01:17:04,251 --> 01:17:07,629
...I hope they pop a cap in your ass.

1125
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:10,215
Michael.

1126
01:17:10,216 --> 01:17:12,050
What's going on?

1127
01:17:12,051 --> 01:17:16,351
I've just had one hell
of an unlucky day, man.

1128
01:17:18,349 --> 01:17:23,095
Once upon a time, there was a wise
warrior in a tribe who found a horse.

1129
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:27,941
And everybody said
what a lucky man he was.

1130
01:17:27,942 --> 01:17:30,486
One day the horse threw him,
and he broke his leg.

1131
01:17:30,487 --> 01:17:34,657
And everyone said
what an unlucky man he was.

1132
01:17:34,658 --> 01:17:37,409
Then there was a great battle.

1133
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:40,246
All the young men died
except the wise warrior...

1134
01:17:40,247 --> 01:17:44,825
...who couldn't go
because he had a broken leg.

1135
01:17:46,753 --> 01:17:48,921
Deep.

1136
01:17:48,922 --> 01:17:53,466
Deep as usual.
Strange as hell, but deep.

1137
01:17:54,511 --> 01:17:58,811
Get on out of here, man.

1138
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,187
- Hey, Michael!
- Yeah?

1139
01:18:04,188 --> 01:18:08,488
Did I mention I knew a girl
in Topolobampo once?

1140
01:18:37,431 --> 01:18:41,684
Sorry about your store, Jack.

1141
01:18:41,685 --> 01:18:45,985
Thanks, Michael.

1142
01:18:55,575 --> 01:18:59,119
Please come again.

1143
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:03,420
I...

1144
01:19:06,753 --> 01:19:11,053
Hey, wait up!

1145
01:19:35,282 --> 01:19:37,242
That's Jose's plane.

1146
01:19:37,243 --> 01:19:40,453
All right!

1147
01:19:40,454 --> 01:19:42,205
Hey, Michael!

1148
01:19:42,206 --> 01:19:45,292
This may be your lucky day after all.

1149
01:19:45,293 --> 01:19:49,593
Maybe I can make it still.

1150
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:02,393
Grapefruit lady, you're my ride.
We only got 10 minutes.

1151
01:20:02,394 --> 01:20:04,395
- Yeah, we can make it.
- Are you sure?

1152
01:20:04,396 --> 01:20:06,981
Yeah, it's just a short flight
over the canyon.

1153
01:20:06,982 --> 01:20:09,317
A condom with glasses. All right.

1154
01:20:09,318 --> 01:20:11,777
Wait. You got the 35 bucks?

1155
01:20:11,778 --> 01:20:14,197
- The 35-?
- At least half-ay.

1156
01:20:14,198 --> 01:20:18,498
Thirty-five- Come on, please.
This cannot be happening to me.

1157
01:20:23,499 --> 01:20:27,799
Consider that a loan, Tyson.

1158
01:20:29,297 --> 01:20:33,597
- Have a nice trip.
- Thanks, man.

1159
01:20:33,676 --> 01:20:37,976
I'm a little sensitive about my money.
Get me there.

1160
01:20:47,107 --> 01:20:50,150
How long have you had your licence?

1161
01:20:50,151 --> 01:20:54,280
What is this " licence"?

1162
01:20:54,281 --> 01:20:58,581
It's kind of shaky, huh?

1163
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:09,133
This is okay. Go! We need to go!

1164
01:21:15,511 --> 01:21:20,257
<i>This is the departure of Alta Air,
flight 664 to Chicago...</i>

1165
01:21:20,474 --> 01:21:22,601
<i>...is ready for final boarding.</i>

1166
01:21:22,602 --> 01:21:26,902
<i>All confirmed passengers
should be onboard the aircraft.</i>

1167
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:44,295
Hey! That's my car!

1168
01:21:46,585 --> 01:21:50,713
What did you do to my ride?

1169
01:21:50,714 --> 01:21:55,014
Keep it, you little asshole!

1170
01:21:57,012 --> 01:21:59,889
<i>Did you see the excitement
on the TV today?</i>

1171
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:01,850
<i>It was like Cops
without commercials.</i>

1172
01:22:01,851 --> 01:22:05,228
You're not kidding.
Erly and I were glued to the set.

1173
01:22:05,229 --> 01:22:08,732
When they came out of there
in their underwear, I had to take a pill.

1174
01:22:08,733 --> 01:22:13,478
But how they could mistake that skinny
guy for Mike Tyson, I'll never know.

1175
01:22:23,957 --> 01:22:27,585
You give me the other half
right now, okay?

1176
01:22:27,586 --> 01:22:30,337
Okay?

1177
01:22:30,338 --> 01:22:31,839
Rae!

1178
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,676
<i>- Rae! Has anyone seen a black lady?
- ... climax to the hostage drama...</i>

1179
01:22:35,677 --> 01:22:39,096
<i>North Butte Sheriff's Department,
shown here bombarding the store...</i>

1180
01:22:39,097 --> 01:22:43,397
<i>...issued an apology.</i>

1181
01:23:07,794 --> 01:23:11,213
Hey, Tyson!

1182
01:23:11,214 --> 01:23:13,173
Rae! Girl!

1183
01:23:13,174 --> 01:23:15,593
Oh, honey!

1184
01:23:15,594 --> 01:23:18,137
- You waited for me.
- Oh, I knew you'd be late.

1185
01:23:18,138 --> 01:23:22,391
Are you ever on time?

1186
01:23:22,392 --> 01:23:26,692
- Let's go home.
- Oh, honey.

1187
01:23:36,365 --> 01:23:39,701
Could I get a Diet Coke, please? Hello?

1188
01:23:39,702 --> 01:23:43,496
Could I get a Diet Coke, please?

1189
01:23:43,497 --> 01:23:46,333
Don't make me go for the ding-a-ling.

1190
01:23:46,334 --> 01:23:50,634
Don't make the ding-a-ling
go for you.

1191
01:23:54,467 --> 01:23:56,301
What in the hell?

1192
01:23:56,302 --> 01:24:00,602
Okay. Nobody move!

1193
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:04,940
- Michael! Hey!
- Michael?
