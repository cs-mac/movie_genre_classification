1
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,812
(dog barking)

2
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,293
Mom, it's 6:45.

3
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:36,830
Mom! It's 6:45.

4
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,867
Again?

5
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:45,005
No. Dummy.

6
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:48,709
Oh... Oh! Oh.

7
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,886
(meows)

8
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,488
What are you eating?

9
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,055
A doughnut.
For breakfast?

10
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,158
I put peanut butter on it.

11
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,660
What are these dishes
doing in the sink? It was
your turn to do them.

12
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,296
I'll do 'em tonight.

13
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,499
Is that when you're gonna
put everything else away?

14
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,534
What's wrong
with the refrigerator?

15
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,903
It's warm. It must've broke down
during the night.

16
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,272
Didn't I just have it fixed?

17
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,375
Didn't I just
pay those guys $47?

18
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,512
Thieves, all of them.
Goddamn thieves.

19
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,516
God damn it!
Why won't that door lock?

20
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,784
It's warped
because of the rain.

21
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,521
With any luck,
they'll steal the refrigerator.

22
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:41,094
(sputters and jerks)

23
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,596
What's wrong with it?

24
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,865
It's a year older
than you are.

25
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,376
(car backfires and sputters)

26
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,348
Hey, why don't you get
a new muffler, lady?

27
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:04,452
Why don't you try living
on a teacher's salary?

28
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,687
I'm in a terrific mood
today, aren't I?

29
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,122
Why do you stay up all night
marking exams?

30
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,225
I have 18 kids
flunking English.

31
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:15,396
18 out of 39 does not
exactly give a teacher
a sense of accomplishment.

32
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,998
It had a big engine.

33
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,132
How you doin', man?

34
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,569
Hey, Barry, how's it going?

35
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,504
(Nora) What do you want
for dinner tonight?

36
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,605
(Michael) Oh, I don't care.

37
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,574
You had I don't care
last night.

38
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,841
Anything.

39
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,746
What's up, Mike?

40
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:33,714
Hi, Steve.

41
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,783
I thought
they expelled that one.

42
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:39,052
Oh, he's all right.
Well, I gotta go.

43
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,054
Where's my kiss?
Oh, I owe you one.

44
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,956
Ah, ah, I don't give credit.
Come here.

45
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,896
Sorry to put you through
torture, but it gets me
through the day.

46
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,164
(boy) Sixth period.
(girl) OK, I'll come.

47
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,066
Hey, how you doin', Mike?

48
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,736
What's goin' on with you, man?

49
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,571
(bell rings)

50
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,958
Two heels and sole.

51
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:21,795
Excuse me, I'm late for work.
Would you mind terribly
if I went ahead of you?

52
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,931
Go ahead. I got
nothin' to do all day.

53
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:28,902
Aw... there you go.
Thanks a lot. Bye.
Thank you.

54
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:36,844
Wait a minute.
Wait, uh, uh...

55
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,815
Sir, sir, did you see
a '64 Volvo parked right there?

56
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,851
Sorry, lady.

57
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:47,421
Oh, no, this isn't happening.
This is impossible.

58
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,991
Oh, my God.
I can't find my car.
Something wrong?

59
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:54,328
I can't find my car.
You can't find your car?

60
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,096
No.
Did you park it here?

61
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,965
Certainly. I parked it
right here.

62
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,634
Oh, I don't believe this.
They stole my car.
Who did?

63
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,437
What do I know? Car thieves.

64
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:07,408
Oh, I don't believe this.
The dirty bastards.

65
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,810
I was just standing
behind her in line.

66
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,045
All my school papers
were in there,

67
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:15,949
even the final English
exam papers. I didn't even
finish correcting them yet.

68
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,385
What happened?

69
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,219
Somebody
stole her car.

70
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,054
Can I see your registration,
please?

71
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,656
It's in the car.

72
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,625
You should always
carry it on you.

73
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,894
If I ever get another car,
I'll remember that.

74
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,430
Were there any
distinguishing markings
on the vehicle?

75
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,131
There's the dent
in the fender.

76
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,766
Which one?

77
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,735
All of them.
And the parking lights
didn't work.

78
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,837
You know
that's a violation?

79
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,172
When you catch the new owners,
you can give them a ticket.

80
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,842
Hello, lieutenant.
Thank you.

81
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:46,046
Mrs. McPhee,
I'm Lieutenant Costello.

82
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:48,382
I'd like to ask you
a few questions if I may.

83
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,419
I am so angry.
I'm so goddamn angry
at people.

84
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52,920
I understand.

85
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,756
It's enough
they stole the radio
last month.

86
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,558
Did you leave
the vehicle unlocked?

87
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,428
I just told you
they broke into it
last month.

88
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,162
The locks didn't work.

89
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,264
On each side of the vehicle?

90
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,401
Why do you
keep calling it a vehicle?
It was hardly even a car.

91
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:10,337
Don't you watch TV?
We all talk like that.

92
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,506
You left the keys
in the ignition?

93
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,676
Yes, I must've.
They're not in my purse.

94
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:18,746
I had ten minutes' sleep
last night, OK?

95
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:22,249
And you were not
insured for theft?

96
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,752
I didn't think
it would come up.

97
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,521
Oh, this is terrific.
My first class just started.

98
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,923
What do you teach?
English literature.

99
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,425
Contemporary?

100
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,761
Not when I show up
with 39 exam papers missing.

101
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:38,499
I'm sorry. I think we have
all the information we need.
If you just sign there...

102
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,001
(siren wailing)

103
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,444
Who's your favorite writer?

104
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,845
I beg your pardon?

105
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,414
I took English lit
at Michigan.

106
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:56,617
I was curious
who your favorite writer was.

107
00:06:56,684 --> 00:07:00,988
2,000 detectives in L.A.,
and I have an English lit major
looking for my car.

108
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,024
I may not find your car,
but my reports will be
impeccable.

109
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,760
If my kids find out their
final-exam papers are missing,

110
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,296
you may have a more serious case
than auto theft to deal with.

111
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,164
Somebody should lose
my kid's papers.

112
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,801
If I hear anything
about your car,
I'll let you know.

113
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:14,768
Thank you.

114
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,238
Austen.

115
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,741
What?

116
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:24,578
Jane Austen. I like a writer
you can depend on.

117
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:29,316
Thackeray. I like somebody
who makes you work a little.

118
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,652
(all talking/
music on radio)

119
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:35,422
I'm sorry I'm late.

120
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,191
Wendall,
turn off the radio.

121
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,728
Patrick, get your feet
off Luis.

122
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,830
Celia, take the gum
out of your mouth.

123
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:43,964
It's not gum.

124
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:48,035
I would rather not hear
what it is. Just get rid of it.

125
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,338
All right, I'm going
to ask the class
to bear with me.

126
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,474
I have some rather bad news.
My car was stolen this morning.

127
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,009
(students murmur)

128
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,311
Where'd you lose it?
Maybe I know who did it.

129
00:07:58,378 --> 00:07:59,680
Third and Magnolia?

130
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:02,015
Nah, ain't none of my boys.

131
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,851
(class laughs)

132
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,019
If you're ready
for the really bad news,

133
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,488
your final test papers
were in the car.

134
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:10,323
They're gone.
I don't know where they are.

135
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,025
I don't remember
what your grades were.

136
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,426
What?

137
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,096
So now what happens?

138
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,999
What happens? We take
the test over tomorrow,
that's what happens.

139
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:22,002
(all protest)

140
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,672
I'm sorry. Look at it
this way...

141
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,474
for those that passed,
they're not gonna have
any trouble passing again,

142
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,477
and for those that failed,
you have an extra night
to study.

143
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,379
Shit.

144
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,249
This is English, Luis.
Save that discussion
for Biology.

145
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,186
I suggest we spend
the rest of the period
brushing up on Shakespeare.

146
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,955
Get out your Hamlet books.
Shakespeare.

147
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:46,560
We left off with, uh...
beginning of Act Two
last class.

148
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,697
Page 46. Luis.

149
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,733
Oh, man.

150
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,401
Do you wanna read Polonius?

151
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:59,306
Yeah. "Give him this money
and these notes, Reynaldo."

152
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,042
Uh, Reynaldo... Wendall?

153
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,010
"I will, my Lord."

154
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,645
"Man -"

155
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,514
No, no. No "man."
There's no "man" in the script.

156
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:10,117
"You should do
marvelous wisely.

157
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,352
Good, Reynaldo.
"Now, before - man...

158
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,655
There's no "before"
and no "man."

159
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,156
Yeah, there's "before"
right there.

160
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,925
"And before you visit him,

161
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,860
to make inquire
of his behavior."

162
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,029
"My Lord,
I did intendeth."

163
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,597
Very good.

164
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:28,001
"Marry. Well said."
Oh, yeah, "Marry, well said.
Very well said.

165
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,772
Look... Look you, sir."
Man, this don't make sense.

166
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,241
Sure. Look you, sir. Instead
of saying, "Hey, look, man,"

167
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,342
he's saying, "Look you, sir.

168
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,744
"Look you, sir."

169
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,612
Ha-ha. You're dumb.

170
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,747
(class laughs)

171
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,616
Man, shut up.
I'm on a roll now, bro.

172
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,517
(bell rings)

173
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,686
Miss McPhee.

174
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,588
Maybe it's about my car.

175
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,223
Any news?

176
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,026
They found it at the bottom
of Topanga Canyon.
It was totaled.

177
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,563
Well, that's
just wonderful.
I'm really sorry.

178
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,565
Come on,
I'll give you a lift home.

179
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,500
We'll try and figure
something out.

180
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,703
(whistling)

181
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,706
(car horn honks)

182
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,607
Mike, get in.

183
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,743
Where's the car?

184
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,746
Well, thanks for the rides.

185
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:16,650
A very nice day. I'm sorry,
that sounds insensitive.

186
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,886
No, not for a man
who reads Thackeray.

187
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,954
Listen,
if I was out of line,

188
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:24,825
you can file
a formal complaint
by dialing 555-3000.

189
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,094
Ask for Lieutenant Costello.

190
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,698
I'm in charge
of formal complaints.
Nice meeting ya, Mike.

191
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,401
Ohh.

192
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,537
I can't believe
that you left the keys
in the ignition.

193
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:41,108
Please. Be thankful
I saved your shoes.

194
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:47,881
Hey, here's one.

195
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:51,384
A '64 blue Chevy Corvair,
white walls and radials.

196
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,086
$250.

197
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,156
It comes in a box.
You assemble it yourself.

198
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:59,727
Yeah. Well, you can't find
anything decent for less
than $1,000.

199
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:03,530
How much money
you have in the bank?

200
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,966
Funny, I was just gonna
ask you that.

201
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,535
Isn't there anybody who
you can borrow from at school?

202
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,670
You mean teachers? Please.

203
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:13,206
What about relatives?
Didn't Pop have any?

204
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,042
Not with any money.

205
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,244
Hey, what about
your father?

206
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,946
You never talk about him.

207
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,514
What did he do for a living?
I don't know. Whoops.

208
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,952
You don't know
what your own father
did for a living?

209
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,387
Well, he worked in a bank
for a while,

210
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,523
he was an accountant,
he did a lot of things.

211
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,992
When did he die?

212
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,896
He didn't. Well, he might
be dead. I'm not sure.

213
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,965
You told me he was dead.

214
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,867
Yeah, well,
he probably is.

215
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,202
I haven't seen him
since before you were born.

216
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,336
How come?

217
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,739
I don't know. Look,
can we change the subject?

218
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,908
What we need right now
is a car, not a grandfather.

219
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:48,976
(doorbell rings)

220
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,011
Are you expecting someone?
No.

221
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:54,915
Hmm. Please, God,
let it be the United Way.

222
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,884
(doorbell rings)

223
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,685
Outside.
What?

224
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:01,521
I said outside.
Let's go.

225
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,924
What are you doing?

226
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,394
Know how to ride
one of those?
No.

227
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,897
Want to learn?
No.

228
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,698
Afraid?
Yeah.

229
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:15,602
OK, forget it.
I'll see ya.

230
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,604
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

231
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,541
Can we stop having
these Dragnet conversations
and just talk like human beings?

232
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,609
Yes, ma'am.

233
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,144
Well, uh, whose is this?

234
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,546
Formerly smashed-up
stolen property

235
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:29,349
reconstructed by the police
and sold at auction
to benefit needy kids

236
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,152
who probably stole it
in the first place.
It's mine.

237
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,754
I bought it.
I use it on weekends,
when I have 'em.

238
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,489
You want to rent it
Mondays to Fridays?

239
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,724
For how much?

240
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,559
Dinners
Saturdays and Sundays.

241
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:43,196
I'll pay ya $20 a week
plus parts and maintenance.
Does that sound fair?

242
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,167
What do I know?
I'm not Avis. Sure.
Is it a deal?

243
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,736
Well, you better show me
how to work this thing.

244
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,805
OK. Put your helmet on.

245
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,706
Is this dangerous?

246
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,976
Only if you start it.

247
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:58,078
Hey, where you going?

248
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:01,448
I don't know.
Keep your fingers crossed.

249
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,952
Your mother get a new friend?

250
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,554
Yeah, I guess so.

251
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,190
Just take a firm grip
on the handle bars
right here.

252
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,059
Put your hands right here
where mine are.
Uh-huh.

253
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,460
OK, got it?
Yeah.

254
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,694
Now just relax.
Uh-huh.

255
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:15,896
Ready?
Yeah.

256
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,965
OK, she's all yours.
Got it?
Uh-huh.

257
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,267
Take it easy, relax.
You're all right.

258
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,836
Don't take your hands off.
Wait a minute.

259
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,973
You're doing fine.
Now don't worry about it, OK?

260
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,008
You got control?
No, not really.

261
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,409
Aah!

262
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,544
You're all right.
Don't worry about it.
Just relax.

263
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,847
I am trying to relax.

264
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:36,616
Ease your grip
on the handle bars.
You're choking the handle bars.

265
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,318
I'm beginning to get it.

266
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,387
Just keep your balance.
Wait a second.

267
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:44,757
You are now proceeding
the wrong way
down a one-way street.

268
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,795
Aah! How do I make a U-turn?

269
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,331
You're not ready.
You can't go straight.

270
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:52,866
Well, I just made one.

271
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:56,136
That
doesn't mean you were ready.
That's a stop sign. Yes, ya did.

272
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,338
I'm in the traffic.
I'm riding straight.

273
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,640
That's good.
I'm riding straight.

274
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:01,942
Watch out for the Jeep.

275
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,310
(speaking Spanish)

276
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,715
(pleads in Spanish)

277
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,650
Aah!

278
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:14,187
(owner yelling)

279
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,926
What are you doing?
Hang on to me tight.

280
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,205
(sirens wailing)

281
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,880
Police officer.

282
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,083
Just take it easy.

283
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,152
Just take it easy.

284
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,627
Holy cow.

285
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,773
Would you like to come in
for a cup of coffee
or a medal?

286
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,178
I would, but I
gotta be back at work
in half an hour.

287
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,580
You mean that was
leisure-time activity?

288
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,482
Some of us make arrests,

289
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,850
and some of us
mark exam papers at night.

290
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:22,956
I'll see you Saturday night.
We'll eat in a low-crime area.

291
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,891
Would - oh, thanks.

292
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,027
Would I be asking
for trouble

293
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,029
if I told you
I'm very impressed?

294
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:33,133
Nope. You'd be asking
for this.

295
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,277
I think I bought
a little trouble.

296
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,948
See you Saturday night.

297
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:54,187
Lieutenant, I don't know
your first name.

298
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,790
I knew I'd pique
your interest.

299
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,459
Brian.

300
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:05,398
Hey, what happened?
Can you ride it?

301
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,000
Can I ride it?

302
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:10,737
I just made an arrest
on Venice Boulevard.

303
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,040
Watch it.

304
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,579
(phone ringing)

305
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,051
Hello?

306
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,418
(Brian) Did I wake ya?
No.

307
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,255
I thought I made
a good impression tonight.

308
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,025
I see. Is that observation
or overconfidence?

309
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:35,395
Just probing, hoping
I'd get a positive response.

310
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,797
You really do put in
a full day, don't you?

311
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,766
Only on the interesting cases.

312
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,702
Thank you. Listen, lieutenant,
I have to get up at 5:30
in the morning

313
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,237
to practice on my bike.

314
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,972
I'll see you on Saturday, OK?

315
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,007
Hey, first line, what book?

316
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:51,078
"Buck Mulligan appeared from
the stairhead bearing a bowl
of lather on which a mirror..."

317
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,812
James Joyce, Ulysses.

318
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,147
Terrific.

319
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,249
Straight A's.
Magna cum laude.

320
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,585
I've got my work cut out
with you.

321
00:16:58,651 --> 00:16:59,852
I gotta go.

322
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,888
OK. I'll see ya Saturday.
Bye.

323
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,090
Bye.

324
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,734
(phone rings)

325
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,671
You're not gonna quote
the whole book, are you?

326
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:19,706
(man) Nora?

327
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,508
Oh, you remembered my name.

328
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,010
Now look, may I speak to you
for a moment?

329
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:27,046
It won't take long for me
to tell you what I have to.

330
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:28,648
Who is this?

331
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:32,352
See, that would take long.
I'm just down the street.

332
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,588
I'd call in the morning,
but it's urgent.

333
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,357
What's this all about?

334
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:40,460
Look, I just need
five minutes of your time.

335
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,862
Nora, look, please don't
refuse me here.

336
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,764
For old times' sake.

337
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,267
(hangs up/dial tone)

338
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,671
(thunder rumbling)

339
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,488
Uh, yes. This is
Mrs. Nora McPhee.

340
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,258
Could I please speak to
a Lieutenant Brian Costello?

341
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,393
(man) I'm sorry, the lieutenant
is out on a call.

342
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,395
Oh, well, is there any way
to reach him?

343
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,797
No, I'm afraid not.
May I help you?

344
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,333
You see, I got this
rather strange phone call,

345
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,603
and it's probably a prank,
but it made me sort of nervous -

346
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,206
Ma'am, did they use
any obscene language?

347
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,707
No, it wasn't obscene.

348
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,410
Let me transfer you
to the officer in complaints.

349
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:34,347
Well, it's probably nothing,
but would you please have him
call me as soon as he could?

350
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,915
Does he have your number?

351
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,550
Yes, he has the number.

352
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,852
OK. I'll give him
your message.
Bye.

353
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,593
(dog barking)

354
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:24,964
(man coughs)

355
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,833
Who's there?

356
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,937
The one who just called.
May I speak to you, please?

357
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,474
I've just called the police.
They're gonna be here
in five minutes.

358
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:38,245
You better tell me who you are
and what you want.

359
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,381
Does 1125 Franklin Street,
North Chicago,

360
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:46,286
apartment 2B,
pink elephant wallpaper
in your room

361
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,788
mean anything to you?

362
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,464
Max Dugan?

363
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,335
Well, I was half-hoping
you'd still call me "Daddy,"

364
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,704
but Max'll be fine.
I've got a gun.

365
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,973
I can assure you,
I am your father.

366
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,742
After what you did to us,
that doesn't make you
any safer.

367
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,445
Can I come in, please?

368
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:17,684
OK.

369
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:29,228
Close that door, would ya?

370
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,699
Is the boy sleeping?

371
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:33,766
What boy?

372
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,935
Michael, my grandson.

373
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,305
Just about 15 now,
isn't he?

374
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,972
Who told ya that?
I get around.

375
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,444
Hey, listen, do you have
any brandy in the house?

376
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:48,915
My blood isn't as thick
as it used to be.

377
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:53,886
Try to picture me
with darker hair.
Mm-hmm.

378
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:58,190
Well, the teaching profession
doesn't afford many luxuries,
does it?

379
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,293
How did you find me?

380
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,363
Oh, I still have
a few friends
in Chicago.

381
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,332
Apparently my mother
wasn't one of them.

382
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,233
Did you know
she died last year?

383
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,370
I did and I'm deeply sorry.
I sent her flowers anonymously.

384
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,172
Say, do you mind
if I pull down these shades?

385
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:17,310
I wouldn't want
a young attractive widow
getting a bad reputation.

386
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,978
What is it you want?

387
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:20,847
Me? A brandy.

388
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:24,116
Wait a minute. Why are you
pulling down shades?

389
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,919
Why'd you call me
in the middle of the night,
afraid to say who you are?

390
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:29,422
This window
needs a new lock.
Are the police after you again?

391
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,625
I'm a popular man.
Many people seek my company.

392
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:35,762
Oh, shouldn't keep a gun
with a small boy in the house.

393
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,164
I'm not afraid of small boys,
just older men.

394
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,834
Look, if it's a handout
you're looking for, I'm sorry.

395
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,970
I have too little,
and you're too late.

396
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,606
I don't care where you've
been for the last 28 years
or what you've been doing.

397
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,442
There are no openings
in this family anymore.

398
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,978
Family reunions
aren't what they used to be.

399
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,346
Neither are fathers.

400
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,683
Quick, very quick. OK, Nora,
let's make a deal.

401
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:59,452
If you won't favor me
with your hospitality,

402
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,389
can I at least
buy a drink from you?

403
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,457
You mean you can
actually pay for it?

404
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:06,593
* Liquor by the mile

405
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,095
* Can take you to places... *

406
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,202
I think that should at least
buy me a good brand of scotch.

407
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,872
It's $10,000. In Las Vegas,
I can get 2 drinks for that.

408
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,475
I do have certain talents,
you know.

409
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,444
Yes. They bought you
six years in jail.

410
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:27,414
Ha-ha. Refined 'em
since then.

411
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,316
Well, I see I'm not gonna
get the drink, so, uh...

412
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:32,351
perhaps we could use
the precious time

413
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,286
to conduct
a little business.

414
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,722
What kind of business?

415
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,657
I think you might
wanna sit down.

416
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:40,292
I'll decide that for myself.

417
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,630
Hmm. There's little doubt
I've been a neglectful father,
to say the very least,

418
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,432
but we can go into that
some other time.

419
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:48,000
We could go into it now.

420
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:52,605
I am 63 years old, and according
to a very reputable doctor,

421
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,841
if I take
very good care of myself

422
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,076
and avoid all stress
and tension,

423
00:22:57,143 --> 00:23:00,212
it'd be a miracle
if I lived another six months.

424
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,948
(thunder)

425
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:05,117
I say this not to alarm you
or to elicit your sympathies,

426
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,687
which are vigorously
undisplayed at the moment,

427
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:10,423
but merely to present you
with the facts.

428
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,761
My heart
and the surrounding valves
have turned in their notice.

429
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:18,164
Now, I have enough money
in that suitcase

430
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,169
to spend the next
ten years of my life
living like Hugh Hefner,

431
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,840
but I have neither
the workable equipment to do so
nor the ten years.

432
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,777
To complicate matters,
there are certain parties

433
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,813
who think that six months
is much too long for me to live

434
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,749
and would like to get
their hands on me.

435
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:42,088
I'd like to buy something
from you, and I'm willing
to pay handsomely for it.

436
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:46,392
And even you must admit
that your ramshackle roof
could use some shackling.

437
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,495
What do I have
that you would wanna buy?

438
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:52,965
The last few months of my life
with my grandson.

439
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,301
Are you serious?

440
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,504
Deadly.

441
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,541
You show up here
in the middle of the night
afraid to say who you are,

442
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,643
I haven't seen you
since I'm nine years old,

443
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,745
and you greet me
with the same affection
you left with,

444
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:09,682
throw $10,000 in front of me,
which is probably counterfeit,

445
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:12,218
and then expect me
to burst into tears

446
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,588
because you tell me
you only have six months
left to live.

447
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,690
How do I know you only have
six months left to live?

448
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,959
We could sit here and wait.

449
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:23,129
Excuse me.

450
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,932
(thunder)

451
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:37,544
Nothing for dear old dad?

452
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,783
Ah, thank you.

453
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,018
Did you steal that money?

454
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:50,189
One of the subjects
I mastered in prison
was real estate.

455
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,859
When I got out, I bought
a small piece of property
in Las Vegas,

456
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,661
parlayed it
into a larger piece,

457
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:59,198
until I finally owned
ten lots that a large hotel
wanted to expand on.

458
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,300
I wouldn't sell it to them.

459
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,670
So they used
their political power

460
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,705
to legally separate me
from my land.

461
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:08,741
Took me for every cent I had.

462
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,544
Well, I took my loss
stoically

463
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:16,482
and even accepted another job
in another hotel

464
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,585
owned by the same
nefarious faction...

465
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,653
as a blackjack dealer.

466
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,655
I worked there
seven long and hard years,

467
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,891
and day by day,
dollar by dollar,

468
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,727
I ingeniously
skimmed off the top

469
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:29,996
what was rightfully mine.

470
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,066
H-How much is in this satchel?

471
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:40,740
Exactly what they took
from me - $687,000.

472
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:45,311
Perhaps a pot of coffee
would be safer?

473
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,345
Could I see it?

474
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:49,982
Yeah. I look all the time.

475
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,019
(whimpers)

476
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,520
Ah...

477
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:57,023
Ah...

478
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,758
Oh...

479
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:01,761
It's your money now.

480
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:05,497
Wha...? Wha...?
What do you mean, "my money"?

481
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,133
It's your legacy.

482
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,535
Yeah, yours and Michael's.
You're my only heirs.

483
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:12,438
That's my last will
and testament.

484
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,406
I need a decision
as soon as possible.

485
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:17,043
The sun is my enemy,
and it'll be up in a few hours.

486
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,145
Wait a minute. Do you think
I'd touch a cent of that money?

487
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,981
I don't care if there's
$5 million in there.
That money is stolen.

488
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,550
From me. I might've got it back
in litigation,

489
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:27,787
but it would've taken six years,
five and half of which
I'd be dead,

490
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:30,022
and the lawyers would've
got most of it, anyway.

491
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,826
This is family money, Nora.
Well, find another family.

492
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:36,663
Just take that money and go.
I don't want any part of this.

493
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:40,132
Nora, I can never make up
for the years we didn't
have together,

494
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:43,335
but I don't wanna lose
the few remaining days
I could share with my grandson.

495
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,905
If you don't want the money,
fine, I'll accept that,

496
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:49,876
but a trust fund set up
for Michael would more than
get him through college

497
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,278
and a start in life
I was never able to give you.

498
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,680
Think of him, not us.

499
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,682
(phone ringing)

500
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:58,084
Oh, that's probably Brian.
Who's Brian?

501
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,019
A lieutenant
on the police force.

502
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:02,454
Hello. Oh, Brian.
Sorry I'm late...

503
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:05,892
You wouldn't hold
a little thing like abandonment
against your father, would ya?

504
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,760
Do you mean
they're after you, too?

505
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,762
Nora, are you all right?

506
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,497
Yes, I'm fine.
What's going on?

507
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,533
I got a message said you got
a crank or mysterious call?

508
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,237
It was nothing, just a couple
kids in the neighborhood
playing a prank.

509
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,173
I just felt like calling you
and saying good night again.

510
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,141
Did you?

511
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,043
Once we get the hang
of "good night,"

512
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,946
maybe we could start...
working on "good morning."

513
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:29,081
Thanks for calling back.
I'll see you Saturday.

514
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,150
You take care
of yourself, OK?

515
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,791
Little Nora Dugan has grown
into a compassionate woman.

516
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:41,694
Well, you've seen
the last drop of it.

517
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,662
I want you to go.

518
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,933
I want you to take
your $687,000 and just go.

519
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,069
It doesn't go with my furniture,
and if you want to see Michael,

520
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:53,906
$1.50 at McDonald's
will buy a terrific afternoon.

521
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:08,020
I have to say I was sorry
to hear about your husband.

522
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:10,456
Understand he was
a first-rate man.

523
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,791
Thank you.

524
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:15,928
I suggest you don't mention this
to the policeman.

525
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:19,331
I've always found 'em
to be busybodies.

526
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,133
Where will you go?

527
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,438
Well, there are some motels
that still accept cash.

528
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,884
Good-bye, Nora.
I would've enjoyed
getting to know ya.

529
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,226
Wait a minute.

530
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,295
I don't trust you.

531
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:52,298
Caution is a valuable trait.
And I don't want anything
from you, either.

532
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,934
Independence is something
I've always admired.

533
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:57,169
I feel funny about
letting you go like this,

534
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,972
so you can spend the night,
but you leave in the morning,
OK?

535
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,708
I pick up things quickly.
I can tell by the satchel.

536
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:07,980
Do me a favor. If this
ever happens again,
send me a postcard.

537
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,349
Morning, Mom.

538
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,284
Morning.

539
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,955
Who are you?

540
00:29:16,022 --> 00:29:19,458
Me? I'm Mr. Parker.

541
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:22,161
Mr. Parker?
Mm-hmm.

542
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,396
Is my mother up?

543
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:25,965
I don't believe so.

544
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:27,766
You a friend of hers?

545
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:30,269
We became acquainted
last night.

546
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:32,771
Oh. You stayed over?
In the guest room.

547
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,440
You have a guest room?

548
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,542
The one next to yours.
I rented it from your mother.

549
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,845
Oh. When was that?

550
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:41,981
Now, that was about
12:30 last night.

551
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:44,650
She didn't tell me.
No. You were sleeping.

552
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:48,888
I heard there was a vacancy,
and I called rather late.

553
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,991
I see. You gonna
be here long?

554
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,226
That depends
on your mother.

555
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,563
Would you excuse me
a minute, Mister...

556
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,866
Parker. Certainly.

557
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,407
Mom...
(knocks on door)

558
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,342
...it's Mike. Are you up?

559
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,078
(knocks)

560
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:16,315
Mom, Mom, it's ten to seven.
Wake up.

561
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:17,716
(alarm sounds)

562
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,952
Oh, I didn't sleep.
I was up all night.

563
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,254
Did you have
your breakfast?

564
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,024
Yeah. Well, I was going to
until I met Mr. Parker.

565
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:26,225
Who?

566
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:27,994
Mr. Parker, the man
you rented the room to.

567
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,495
I rented a room?

568
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,363
Yeah, that's what he told me.

569
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,932
Mr. Parker?

570
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,101
Don't you remember?

571
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,503
Oh, my God, wait a minute.
Let me think.

572
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,105
Why didn't you tell me?

573
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,040
Why didn't I tell you?

574
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:42,975
Well, actually, I didn't know
I was gonna do it.

575
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:46,612
You see, it all
happened suddenly.

576
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,514
Just so quickly.

577
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,516
In the middle of the night?

578
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:54,286
Yes, well, you see,
he didn't have anyplace to go,
and it was only for one night.

579
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,256
You rented a room
for one night? You can't
make any money that way.

580
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:59,358
Uh, I know that.
So why did you do it?

581
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,393
Look, don't question me.
I don't know.

582
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,529
Actually, I was gonna
rent the room for a month,

583
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:07,266
but then I thought it was
a little weird having
a stranger in the house.

584
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,435
So why did you let him
spend the night?

585
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:12,704
Well, I didn't think
he was that strange.

586
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,573
What does he do for a living?

587
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,475
What?

588
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,310
What does he do?

589
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,678
I don't know.

590
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,513
Does he have any references?

591
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,916
Uh, I didn't ask him.
You didn't ask him?

592
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:27,219
No. It was late at night,
I was tired.

593
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:30,222
I never rented a room before.
Is he in there?
Yeah.

594
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,191
Good. I'll take care of it.
I'm much clearer now.

595
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,660
You go and make your bed.
I made my bed.

596
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,230
All right, then, make mine.
I don't wanna be late
for school. Go on.

597
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:45,037
Just what do you
think you're doing?

598
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:47,406
Making pancakes.
The boy needs a hot meal
before he goes to school.

599
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,375
Would you come outside
with me, please?

600
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,410
Outside? My batter
is all ready.

601
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,412
Where did you
get the name Parker from?

602
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,447
I saw it inside
on a box of dinner rolls.

603
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,416
It sounded more plausible
than Birds Eye.

604
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,451
Why did you give him
a phony name?

605
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,453
I was trying to take
the pressure off you.

606
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,422
If I told the boy
he was my grandson

607
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:05,424
and you decided
to throw me out,

608
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,759
he might've resented you
enormously.

609
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,761
Wait a minute.
You intend to stay.

610
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,764
Yes, but I leave that
up to you.

611
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:16,702
Why don't you try my pancakes?
I won three Bake-Offs
in my cell block.

612
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:21,140
How long do you think we could
keep up this subterfuge,
Mr. Parker?

613
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:23,509
According to my doctors,
five months at the most.

614
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:27,579
Will you stop saying that.
I find it in very bad taste.

615
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:30,482
But I'm the one who's dying.
I think I should reserve
the right -

616
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:35,121
All right, I won't
say it ever again.

617
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:40,159
A week. I'll give you a week.

618
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:42,961
I think that's enough time
to get to know your grandson.

619
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,131
Certainly more than
you ever spent with me.

620
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:48,000
And we'll stick to Mr. Parker,
and you stick to the house,

621
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:51,903
because I don't want any
of your Las Vegas friends
around here with shotguns,

622
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,673
or the police,
for that -

623
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,175
What do I tell Brian?

624
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:58,644
I'd stick to lying.
So far, you're doing great.

625
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,379
(phone ringing)

626
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:03,082
I want $100 for the week,
and you clean up
your own room.

627
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:06,985
Make it 250.
I said a hundred.

628
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:10,256
Make it 250.
No! I said a hundred...

629
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,457
Hello.

630
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:13,092
Good morning, Michael.
It's Brian Costello.

631
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,593
Is your mother there?
Yeah.

632
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,562
Could I talk to her, please?
Hold on a second.

633
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:19,465
(Max) And can we have
breakfast now?

634
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,235
After you, Mr. Parker.

635
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,671
After you, Mrs. McPhee.

636
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,074
Brian's on the phone.
What did you tell him?

637
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,042
I told him I'd get you.

638
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,211
Well, you must never, ever
mention Mr. Parker,

639
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:35,181
because I don't have a license
to take in boarders.

640
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,283
You like pancakes?
Hello, Brian?

641
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,119
We don't have 'em much.
From now on,
you're gonna have 'em.

642
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,088
No, no calls.
...the boarder, huh?

643
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:43,489
You OK?
Sit down.

644
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,857
I dreamt about you last night.
I owe you an apology...

645
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,394
Hand me that plate. Thanks.
Drink your orange juice...

646
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,429
Listen, I've got to
get ready for school.

647
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:52,531
I'll talk to you
sometime, OK?
You like baseball?

648
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:53,865
Yeah.
Can you hit?

649
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,801
Not too well.
If you learn to hit...

650
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,836
Tomorrow night? Shh!

651
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,972
Don't disappoint me. I don't
wanna have to repossess
your transportation.

652
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,974
No, no, tomorrow night
is fine.

653
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,610
I'll pick you up about 7:30?

654
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,545
Pick me up? You mean here?

655
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:09,548
I could pick you up here,
but you don't live here.

656
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:12,984
Stove's no good...
7:30. Drive the bike
carefully...

657
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,086
Bye.

658
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:15,521
Bye.

659
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,390
Nothing in this kitchen works.
Try these, will you?

660
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,159
Where'd you
learn how to cook?

661
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:22,428
Me? Books. Learned everything
from books.

662
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,530
Now, is there anything special
you want for dinner?

663
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,965
I'll take care of his dinner.
Michael, come on, we're late.

664
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:30,436
Go get your pants on,
for school, and don't
forget the helmet.

665
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,804
I'm gonna get dressed.
Finish your pancakes.

666
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:36,142
Thanks for the breakfast,
Mr. Parker.
You're welcome.

667
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:41,113
You didn't lose any time
hitting it off, did you?

668
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:46,185
Just doing what comes naturally.
We have a fine boy there, Nora,
don't we?

669
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:48,854
Yes, I do, thank you.

670
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,858
Listen, why don't you just
leave that stuff in the sink?
I'll do it when I get home.

671
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,561
Man in your condition
should probably
be laying down.

672
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58,764
Yeah, doctor said it could
just as easily happen
lying down.

673
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,833
Sorry, bad taste again.

674
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,603
Say, why don't you go
to school?

675
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,839
I have a few chores
to take care of.

676
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,209
(water runs)

677
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:14,480
Why didn't you ever
get in touch with me before?

678
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:18,116
I never had anything
worth giving you before.

679
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:22,388
I always thought affection
would've been enough.

680
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:31,663
(all talking at once)

681
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:37,569
Celia, I want you to stay.
You, too, Maria.

682
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:46,612
I saw the note, Celia. Were you
passing answers to Maria?

683
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:47,946
Were you?

684
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:50,015
Yes, ma'am.

685
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,218
You know the rules. I have to
give you both failing grades.

686
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,252
Yes, ma'am.

687
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,221
I'm surprised at you.

688
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:57,223
You're one of my best students.
Why did you do it?

689
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:59,758
She didn't know the answers.

690
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,828
Maria has to deal with that.
I don't understand
your behavior.

691
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,496
Maria's my cousin.

692
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,898
Does that make
any difference?

693
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:09,034
It does to me. In my family,
we help each other,
no matter what.

694
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,070
(bell rings)

695
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:13,372
That'll be all, girls.

696
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:15,707
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.

697
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:22,981
Party up in the balcony
or something like that.

698
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,383
Yeah, I'm into it.

699
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,585
It'd be good. We can do it
whenever you want.

700
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:29,521
I gotta go. Take care.
Nice to see you.

701
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:32,157
Bye-bye.

702
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:33,492
Hi, Mom.

703
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,827
What'd they expel him for?
Who, Steve?

704
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:38,864
I don't know.
He was selling some stuff.

705
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,466
What stuff? You mean drugs?

706
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,601
I suppose so.
I never bought any.

707
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:45,136
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

708
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,306
(siren wailing)

709
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:53,111
What's wrong? I was only
doing 40 miles an hour.

710
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:55,847
It's a 35-mile zone.

711
00:36:55,914 --> 00:37:00,552
That's the first speeding ticket
I ever got in my whole life.

712
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,454
Give the ticket to Brian,
he'll take care of it.

713
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:04,556
Don't you ever talk that way.

714
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:07,426
You break the law,
you pay the fine,
do you hear me?

715
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:09,561
I hear they stole your car.

716
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,763
Yes.

717
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,867
Did you hear about the woman
who got raped last week
around the corner?

718
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,336
No, I didn't.

719
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:20,372
I'm glad you've got somebody
staying with you now.

720
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:22,641
What is he, a relative?

721
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:25,577
Uh, he just rented the room
for a few days.

722
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:30,616
Get references.
I never trust anybody.

723
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:33,552
Mom, Mom, you better
come in here.

724
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:36,455
What is it?
Is it Mr. Parker?
Just come in here, please.

725
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:43,629
Where did this come from?

726
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,163
I don't know.

727
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,765
You didn't buy it?

728
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:49,768
I didn't pay for
the old stuff yet.

729
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:52,804
It's got a microwave oven.
You could cook pork chops
in three minutes.

730
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,873
It can cook dinner
while you're in school.

731
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,876
No, this isn't ours.
Don't touch it.
It's a mistake.

732
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:03,181
Holy Christmas.

733
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:06,985
Close it. Don't eat anything.
It's all going back.
It's not ours.

734
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:10,589
Look at that.
Turkey. Chicken.

735
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:14,960
Ham. Ice cream. We could
live for a year on this.

736
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,129
No, we can't. Put all these
things back. It's not ours.
Where's Mr. Baker?

737
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,499
Mr. Parker.
Mr. Parker! Mr. Parker.

738
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:22,000
Crushed-ice dispenser.

739
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:24,736
Don't crush ice.
Don't crush anything.
Leave it alone.

740
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,206
Mr. Parker. Mr. Parker,
are you in there?

741
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,008
I believe so.

742
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:34,480
That is stolen property
in there.

743
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,648
I will not cook
on a stolen stove,

744
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,551
and I will not eat
stolen turkeys
and stolen chickens.

745
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:41,853
I have receipts.
I paid cash.

746
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,855
Yes, which you stole
from a casino.

747
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,124
They took my money,
I took their money,

748
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,726
and Sears, Roebuck
has our money.

749
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:49,695
That is called
circulating cash flow.

750
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,464
That's how
our economy operates.

751
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:54,866
Well, you have been spotted
by Mrs. Litke next door,

752
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:58,570
so you and Sears, Roebuck
better go tonight, Max.

753
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:02,273
Nora, no one is looking
for Mr. Parker.

754
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,477
Max Dugan, on the other hand,
is a very sought-after person.

755
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:07,513
Just let me buy
a little more time.

756
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,749
Time I can afford.
A wonderama kitchen I can't.

757
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,884
A few small pleasures.
What harm can it do?

758
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:17,155
Would you refuse
a dying grandfather -
Don't say things like that.

759
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:21,359
Never again. I'm sorry.

760
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:27,733
Max...

761
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:30,869
it's not
that I'm not appreciative,

762
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:34,473
but when I think about
where that money came from
to buy those things...

763
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,042
It's not from the mouths
of innocent babes.

764
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:41,112
It comes from men
with names like
Boomie Bonozo

765
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,214
and Mario Bananas.

766
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:46,485
And you'll take
all those things with you
when you...

767
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:51,189
It's all right, you can say it.
I can't, you see. I'm the one
who's not allowed.

768
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:55,060
(sighs) What
am I gonna tell Michael
about all those things?

769
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:58,196
Don't worry about it.
Just leave it to Grandpa.

770
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:02,434
Mom, you're not gonna believe
what's in my room. You gotta
come see this.

771
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:06,037
Come on.
It's got everything.

772
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:09,207
It's got a TV,
it's got a stereo,
AM-FM radio,

773
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:11,209
shortwave, video recording.

774
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:12,978
It's like my own studio.

775
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:15,013
Is this the most
beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

776
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,683
Over there is a video camera.
You can tape your own shows.

777
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,818
Wow, I can film me
taking batting practice

778
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,987
like
the big-league teams do.

779
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,455
It's got a zoom lens, too.

780
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,423
No, Mike, not me.
Why not?

781
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:29,427
Well, certain primitive tribes
believe that pictures
steal your soul,

782
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:31,530
and I don't have
all that much soul.

783
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:32,631
Did you buy this?

784
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:35,066
Me, no.
Who did?

785
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:38,203
Mr. Parker was just going
to explain that.

786
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:42,307
You won it.
I what?

787
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,510
You won it on a TV show.

788
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:47,078
What TV show?
I don't know.

789
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:50,782
One of those TV shows
that people win prizes on.
I was never on a TV show.

790
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:53,451
It was one of those shows
that you don't have to be on.

791
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:56,254
I was in here cleaning up
the breakfast dishes

792
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:57,756
when the doorbell rings,

793
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:01,292
and in comes a lawyer
with a blue suit -
No, no.

794
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,494
No.

795
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,530
No, I don't think so.

796
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:07,198
I don't think I won this.
I never won anything in my life.
This is a mistake.

797
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:11,069
But it had your name
and address on the invoice.
I signed for you.

798
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,405
She'll probably have to go down
and do a few publicity pictures,
but that's it.

799
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,241
The stuff is yours.

800
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,545
Maybe it's on
the 6:00 news.
It's not on the 6:00 news.

801
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:23,815
Just turn that thing off
and put everything down.

802
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:25,817
A man with a blue suit, huh?

803
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:28,286
Mm-hmm. He said you
didn't have to worry
about the income tax

804
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:29,955
because it was
already paid for.

805
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:32,423
That was first prize,
tax-free.

806
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,794
Second prize, you had to pay
the income tax.

807
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:38,664
Now, an elderly couple
in Billings, Montana,
won that one.

808
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,666
Billings, Montana?

809
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:43,769
That's it. Just one
of those wonderful things
that happens now and then.

810
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,136
Shall we have dinner?

811
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,977
Ah, not crazy about
my chicken pizzaiola, huh?

812
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:54,445
There's just so much
a person can digest
in one day.

813
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:58,717
You won some cigars, too,
but I'm sure you'll probably
wanna pass on that one.

814
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:00,351
Can I be excused?

815
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:02,420
Yes, after we finish
the dishes.

816
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:06,124
No, no, you don't
have to do the dishes.
Just put 'em in the machine.

817
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,059
What machine?

818
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:11,697
You didn't see the machine?
It's right over there
under the cardboard boxes.

819
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,632
Cleans, scrapes, dries,

820
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:16,234
presses and packages
the leftovers.

821
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,103
Clever little thing,
isn't it?

822
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:20,939
I can't believe it.
No more dishes to do.

823
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:23,809
With the time you'll save,
you'll probably graduate
a year early.

824
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,744
All right, Mike,
go do your homework.

825
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:28,413
He doesn't have
something in his room that
does his homework, does he?

826
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,115
I'll check the catalog.

827
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:32,450
Good night, Mr. Parker.
Thanks for the dinner.

828
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,152
Mm, you're welcome.
That was terrific.

829
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,822
Oh, Mike, write down
what you want
for tomorrow night

830
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,890
and slip it under my door
in the morning.

831
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:41,593
Are you a basketball fan?

832
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,595
I sure am.

833
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:47,332
There's a Laker game on
at 10:00, if you'd like
to come in and watch.

834
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,735
I was hoping you'd ask me.

835
00:42:50,636 --> 00:42:52,103
See you later.

836
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,043
I think the boy likes me.

837
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:01,312
He just hit the jackpot.
You expect him to be hostile?

838
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,750
Life hasn't been
all that wonderful to you,
has it, Nora?

839
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:06,818
You take what comes along.

840
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:09,454
Why not take the good
as well as the bad?

841
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,090
When it comes
from the same place,
I get a little suspicious.

842
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:14,092
Watch your ashes.

843
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:16,094
Oh, does my smoking
bother you?

844
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:20,065
No. Doesn't it bother you?
What does the doctor say
about those things?

845
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:23,334
Oh, he said, "Send me
what you don't finish."
He's not sentimental.

846
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:28,473
Michael has a terrific
sense of values.

847
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:31,076
I don't want
somebody coming along
and corrupting them.

848
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:35,246
Whoever told you
that abject poverty
was a character builder

849
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:37,182
was misinforming you.

850
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:39,417
I can see he's a fine boy.

851
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:41,787
You built a solid
foundation there.

852
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:45,256
I just wanna
spruce things up a bit,
that's all.

853
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:53,598
(Max) Good night, Mike.

854
00:43:53,665 --> 00:43:55,500
I told ya
the Knicks would lose.

855
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,169
Yeah. Good night, Mr. Parker.

856
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,437
Good night, Nora.

857
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:00,839
Uh, Max...
Yeah?

858
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:02,808
I've got a problem.
OK.

859
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:05,110
Yeah, I'm in a jam.

860
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:09,447
Oh. Well, talk to me, honey.
That's what fathers are for.

861
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:12,984
I don't wanna be Cinderella.
Somewhere along the line,
you gotta pay for it.

862
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:16,254
I see. You've been
reading Freud,

863
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,790
the man who was responsible
for the invention of guilt.

864
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:20,826
Yeah, something apparently
you have none of.

865
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:25,997
I did six years
in the big house, kid.
I paid my debt.

866
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:28,399
I'll, uh, make a bargain
with you.

867
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:34,105
Stay here,
live with me and Mike.

868
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,074
I'm not a nurse
and not much of a daughter,

869
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:38,209
but I'll take care of you
the best way I know how.

870
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:39,745
In exchange?

871
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:41,679
Don't become a hero to Mike.

872
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:44,115
He's got a 15-year-old
drug dealer for a friend.

873
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:47,018
He doesn't need a 63-year-old
hardened criminal
for a role model.

874
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:51,156
When the time is right,
I want you to tell him
what you've done,

875
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:52,758
how you did it,

876
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:56,762
and most important,
that what you did
was wrong.

877
00:44:56,828 --> 00:45:00,165
I can live with that.

878
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:03,935
An ill-chosen phrase,
if I ever heard one.

879
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:13,411
Max, one - Oh, Max,
one more thing...

880
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:16,081
Brian Costello,
the lieutenant, I like him.

881
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:18,183
Don't worry.
I give my approval.

882
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:20,351
He's smart,
and he's dedicated.

883
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:23,388
I think if he had to choose
giving me up to bring you in,

884
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:24,856
we'd both lose.

885
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:27,092
I understand.

886
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:30,161
I'll, uh, move
to another place

887
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,397
and visit you and Mike
on the weekends.

888
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,066
No, I didn't say that.
I think you should be careful.
I don't trust Mrs. Litke.

889
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:37,735
I think you should stay
in the house.

890
00:45:37,803 --> 00:45:40,071
Back to prison, eh?

891
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:43,809
Nora...

892
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:51,349
I never had it so good.

893
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:58,289
(dog barking)

894
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:01,026
(Mrs. Litke) Shh! Shh!
Be quiet, I mean it.

895
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,494
You're gonna stay
in the house all day.

896
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:07,232
I'm not gonna take you
for a walk tomorrow.
Be quiet.

897
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:09,968
Now you be quiet.

898
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:13,204
(crowd cheering)

899
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,673
Come on, Mike, let's go,
babe. It's all yours.

900
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,977
All yours, kid.
Remember what I said.
Keep your eye on the ball.

901
00:46:19,044 --> 00:46:21,880
Swing nice and level.
(umpire) Play ball.

902
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:24,249
(boy) Over the fence, Mikey.
Over the fence.

903
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:28,419
Oh, why him? Why do they all
leave it up to him?

904
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:29,554
(coach) Come on, Mike.

905
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,289
Come on, Mike.

906
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:32,790
It's all yours, kid.

907
00:46:32,858 --> 00:46:35,126
Come on, Mike, hit it
out of the park!

908
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:38,063
(man) You can do it,
Mike, you can do it.

909
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:42,400
Strike!

910
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:46,504
No problem, Mike.
Just don't press.

911
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:51,977
Come on, Mike, you can
hit it out of the park!

912
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:55,246
Now come on. Take your time.
You can do it.

913
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,482
No problem, Mike. You're
just pressing too hard.

914
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:59,417
Just take it nice and easy.

915
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,187
(catcher) No problem.

916
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:03,788
Don't worry about it.
You got two more shots.

917
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:06,091
He can't hit,
Scotty.

918
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:09,961
Come on, he's a bum.
Scotty, get him.
Strike.

919
00:47:10,028 --> 00:47:12,663
Oh, I hate this game.
I wish they never invented it.

920
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,266
Come on, Mike.
That guy can't pitch!

921
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,835
(coach) Just take it
nice and easy.

922
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,541
Shh.

923
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:25,310
(opposing team razzes him)

924
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:30,848
Here we go, Scotty,
here we go.
Strike three. You're out.

925
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,663
Feel like getting a pizza?
No.

926
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,665
You don't feel like a pizza?

927
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:49,634
I feel like quitting
the team.

928
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,803
Aw, Mike, don't say that.
You're a terrific first baseman.

929
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,639
You never make an error.

930
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,208
I never get a hit, either.

931
00:47:57,275 --> 00:48:00,878
Maybe I need glasses.
I don't even see the bike.

932
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:02,813
It's right behind
this yellow truck.

933
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,917
Look, what if we came out
real early in the morning,
and I pitched to you?

934
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:07,953
I used to pitch softball
in high school.

935
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:10,221
It's not the same thing.

936
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:14,792
Where is it?

937
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:18,063
No. No, no.

938
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:21,032
Dear God, not again.
They took the bike?

939
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:23,868
Why, this isn't happening
to me.

940
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:26,704
This isn't happening!

941
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:28,239
Didn't you
put the chain on it?

942
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:30,308
Well, I couldn't find
the lock,

943
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:33,144
so I just tied the chains
in a knot.

944
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:34,579
You tied them in a knot?

945
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,315
Look, don't start with me.
I had a lousy day, too.

946
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:41,152
Oh, those bastards.
Those dirty bastards.

947
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:48,926
What am I gonna tell Brian?

948
00:48:48,994 --> 00:48:50,962
A car and a bike
in one week.

949
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:52,964
He's gonna think
it's some kind of disease.

950
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,932
I can't believe
you tied the chains in a knot.

951
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,903
Will you stop saying that?
I don't tell you how
to hit, do I?

952
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,939
Mike, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

953
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:06,277
Wha...?

954
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:08,479
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

955
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:09,580
(gasps)
Oh!

956
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:11,716
Oh, my God.

957
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,451
Don't touch it!

958
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:15,786
It's a mistake.
Somebody parked it
in the wrong place.

959
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:18,056
It's a 380 SL.

960
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:20,158
They delivered it
this afternoon.

961
00:49:20,225 --> 00:49:24,129
Who did?
Do I ask questions?

962
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:27,065
Mr. Parker.

963
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:29,534
Mr. Parker!

964
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,269
Schopenhauer.
Really?

965
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:34,072
Is that his car
parked in my yard?
No, it's yours.

966
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:37,208
Registered in your name.
The plates will probably
be here this week.

967
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:39,710
You promised me.
You gave me your word.

968
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,846
My word isn't worth diddly-poo.

969
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,483
It's my money, my five months,
and if you don't like it...

970
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,519
you can make it
into a flowerpot.
(Michael honking horn)

971
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:52,823
Hey, where's the motorbike?
It was stolen.

972
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,160
Stolen?
Didn't you chain it up?

973
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:58,129
I don't wanna talk about it.
(horn honking)

974
00:49:58,196 --> 00:50:00,931
Michael, get out of that car!
It's not ours!

975
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,000
I can't drive that to school.

976
00:50:03,068 --> 00:50:05,170
I don't make enough
to pay the insurance.

977
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:07,772
It's paid for.
It's yours, Nora.

978
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,674
Don't be stupid.

979
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,442
Take what's coming to ya.

980
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:14,245
Look, you've gotten enough
dirty deals in your life.

981
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:16,581
Don't turn your back
on a payoff.

982
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,716
He almost stole
a baseball glove last summer.

983
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:22,287
How do I explain to him
it's OK to keep that thing?

984
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:26,357
Let me explain it to him.

985
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:29,660
The whole story?
The works.

986
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:31,929
About jail,
where the money came from...

987
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:35,133
Just give me ten minutes
alone with him.

988
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:41,005
Michael,
come in here, please.

989
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:44,442
It was all for nothing.
I spent seven years
in a Vegas pit,

990
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:46,444
all for nothing.

991
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:49,013
I didn't think
getting to know
one another again

992
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,450
is exactly nothing.
Ma, look at this.
I can't believe it.

993
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:55,853
It even tells the time
in China.

994
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,722
Where did you get that?

995
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:00,925
Oh, it was
in the front seat
of the car.

996
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,795
It was in a little box
that said, "Happy Birthday,
Mike."

997
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:07,398
Do you know what time it is
in Shanghai?

998
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:10,835
(watch beeping tune)
Michael...

999
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,503
Michael?

1000
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,672
Mr. Parker has something
he wants to tell you.

1001
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:18,476
I've gotta take a bath.
Brian is picking me up
at 7:30.

1002
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:22,980
Brian Costello,
the lieutenant on the LAPD.

1003
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:25,583
Everything.

1004
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,585
Everything.

1005
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:32,890
Come on in, Mike.
Sit down.

1006
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:34,825
Make yourself comfortable.

1007
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:38,463
(Nora whispers)
Everything.

1008
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:40,598
What time is it
in Istanbul?

1009
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:43,568
(watch beeps tune)

1010
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:44,535
3:15 am.

1011
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:48,173
3:15 am, huh?

1012
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,310
You're probably the only boy
in Southern California
that knows that.

1013
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,212
Mmm.

1014
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:57,215
Well, first of all,

1015
00:51:57,282 --> 00:51:58,883
my name isn't Parker.

1016
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,118
It isn't?
No.

1017
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:03,020
It's Wittgenstein.

1018
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:05,990
Wittgenstein?
Gus Wittgenstein.

1019
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,592
I was a friend
of your grandfather's.

1020
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:11,896
I shared the same cell with him
for six years in Joliet Prison.

1021
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,964
You did?

1022
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:16,867
Max Dugan was a fine man.

1023
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:21,306
Made a few mistakes in his life
and always regretted it.

1024
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:25,943
One of them was
not getting in touch with you.

1025
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,779
Died, a year ago, in Nevada.

1026
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:31,015
Does Mom know about this?

1027
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,318
Yeah. Told her
the night I got here.

1028
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,386
She never said a word.

1029
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:38,256
Well, the Dugans
were all like that.

1030
00:52:38,323 --> 00:52:40,558
Now, when your grandfather died,

1031
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:43,160
he left a will
and made me the trustee.

1032
00:52:43,228 --> 00:52:45,430
The money was to go
to you and your mother.

1033
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:48,098
There was a catch to it,
though.
What's that?

1034
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,835
When Max was on his deathbed...

1035
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,837
You were there?

1036
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:56,674
Sitting at his feet.

1037
00:52:56,741 --> 00:53:01,579
He said,
"Gus, take care of them,

1038
00:53:01,646 --> 00:53:05,750
"but don't tell them
the money came from me.

1039
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:09,354
"Make up some cockeyed story,
but keep my secret.

1040
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,690
"See that Mike gets
a good education

1041
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:17,228
"and make sure he goes
to a good college back east

1042
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:19,364
and majors in philosophy."

1043
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,899
Philosophy?
I have to take philosophy?

1044
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:24,735
Well, it's just a suggestion.

1045
00:53:24,802 --> 00:53:27,171
Then his heart
just stopped beating,

1046
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:29,674
and his hand went cold
in mine.

1047
00:53:31,476 --> 00:53:34,445
So, that's the story.

1048
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:37,014
It's up to you now.
What's up to me?

1049
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:38,383
The reuniting -

1050
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:41,352
your beloved grandfather
and your mother and yourself -

1051
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:46,924
by accepting his gifts
of love and affection.

1052
00:53:46,991 --> 00:53:48,726
I accept.

1053
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:50,160
That's good.

1054
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,197
I know he'd appreciate it.

1055
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:56,801
It's your mother
that's the problem.

1056
00:53:56,867 --> 00:54:03,341
You see, a promise made
on a deathbed is sacred.

1057
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:06,711
Yeah. You've got to convince
your mother somehow

1058
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:11,115
to grant your grandfather's
dying wish.

1059
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:14,752
I don't think the man
will rest in peace
until she does.

1060
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:18,556
Wow. Sounds like a story
that I once saw
on Movie of the Week.

1061
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:22,026
How often art imitates life.

1062
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,828
Yeah.

1063
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:26,163
Will you help me, Mike?

1064
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,766
I'll try.
Good boy.

1065
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:36,006
Can I ask one question?

1066
00:54:36,073 --> 00:54:37,608
Anything.

1067
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:40,177
What business
was my grandfather in?

1068
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,212
Philosophy.

1069
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,181
That's why he wants you
to go into it, too.

1070
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:46,784
You can make money
from philosophy?

1071
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:50,621
Oh, yes, sir,
if you got the right one.

1072
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,230
You OK?

1073
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,267
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

1074
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:06,804
He told you everything?
Yeah, he told me.

1075
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:08,473
About jail?
Yeah.

1076
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:11,442
Where the money came from?
Yeah.

1077
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:13,978
Then you can understand
why I can't accept it.

1078
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,680
Oh, yeah, I can understand.

1079
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:18,816
Oh, thanks, Mike.
I knew you would.

1080
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:24,455
Are you gonna
give everything back?

1081
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:27,224
Well, don't you think
I should?

1082
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:30,094
Dying wish is sacred.

1083
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,899
He told you about that, too?

1084
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:37,468
Ohh...

1085
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:40,237
I'm sorry.
I know how you feel.

1086
00:55:40,304 --> 00:55:42,172
I feel the same way.

1087
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:44,108
What are you gonna do?

1088
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,411
(sighs) I don't know.

1089
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:48,913
I just have to
think about it.

1090
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:51,982
But not tonight.
I have to see Brian tonight.

1091
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:58,589
Aah!

1092
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:02,960
What's that?
Is it real?

1093
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:06,964
That's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1094
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:08,966
There's a card in the box.

1095
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:16,373
"For past days lost
but not forgotten.

1096
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:18,075
Your beloved father."

1097
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:21,011
Try it on.
See how it looks.

1098
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:24,549
You think I should?
It's yours, isn't it?

1099
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:28,185
Oh, you look great.

1100
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:31,822
The card.
He got me with the card.

1101
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:50,575
Did you know that your father

1102
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:52,710
wanted me to go to college
and major in philosophy?

1103
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:54,945
No. He didn't mention it.

1104
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:56,146
Who didn't mention it?

1105
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:58,282
My father.

1106
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:00,184
Your father?
You spoke to your father?

1107
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,489
Well, I may be angry with him,
but I still talk to him,
don't I?

1108
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:11,395
Joy.

1109
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:15,165
He put Joy in there.
That's $200 an ounce.

1110
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:17,968
How can you talk
to your father?
He's dead.

1111
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:19,403
Who's dead?

1112
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,438
Your father.
He died in prison in Nevada.

1113
00:57:21,506 --> 00:57:24,274
Who told you that?
Mr. Wittgenstein.

1114
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:26,176
Who's Mr. Wittgenstein?
Mr. Parker.

1115
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:28,312
Mr. Parker
is Mr. Wittgenstein?
(doorbell ringing)

1116
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:30,581
Should I get the door?
No, no,
don't get the door.

1117
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:32,583
I don't want Brian
to see my father.

1118
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:35,986
How can he see your father?
Because Mr. Wittgenstein
is my father.

1119
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:38,288
I mean, Mr. Parker is.
I thought Max Dugan was.

1120
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:40,324
He is. Uh, he was.

1121
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,660
Well, I mean...
What did he tell you?

1122
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:45,496
Look... wait.
We'll talk about this
when I get home.

1123
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:48,999
(ring)
And, listen, don't go
into what's-his-name's room.

1124
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:51,602
I think there's something
severely wrong with him.

1125
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:53,704
You want me to get that?
It's the policeman.

1126
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:54,972
Never mind.
(ringing)

1127
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:57,474
Michael, just go answer
the door, and...

1128
00:57:57,542 --> 00:57:59,710
but don't let Brian
in the house

1129
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:03,180
and just tell him
I'll be right there.

1130
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:06,951
Don't you like doctors
or dentists?

1131
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:08,919
Wittgenstein?
Yeah, the German
philosopher.

1132
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,921
It's the only name
I could think of.

1133
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,990
Well, what's wrong
with Max Dugan?

1134
00:58:13,057 --> 00:58:16,226
How do you know
I am Max Dugan?
You told me you were.

1135
00:58:16,293 --> 00:58:19,496
I told you a lot of things,
but so far, you haven't liked
any of them,

1136
00:58:19,564 --> 00:58:23,000
so I'll keep on telling you
new ones until you pick out
one you like.

1137
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:24,569
Hi.
Hi.

1138
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:26,236
Mom's getting dressed.

1139
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:29,073
Is that as far
as the door opens?

1140
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:32,009
Oh, she'll be right with you.
I have to do my homework.

1141
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:34,144
Excuse me.

1142
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:37,715
Are you telling me
that you're not my father?
Maybe I am and maybe I'm not.

1143
00:58:37,782 --> 00:58:40,450
Maybe I'm your father
but you're not my daughter.

1144
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,386
Do you know
what Kierkegaard once said?

1145
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:46,557
Yes, and I am not interested
in any more of your roommates.

1146
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:49,727
I have to go.
I have to live my life.

1147
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:52,262
I have to try and appear
calm and intelligent.

1148
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,431
I am dating a person.

1149
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:57,134
We will discuss this
when I get home.

1150
00:58:59,303 --> 00:59:00,971
Hi.

1151
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,640
Hi.

1152
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:05,142
It's been jammed all day.

1153
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:08,913
Oh.
They're for you.

1154
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:11,982
Thank you.
That's very nice of you.

1155
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:15,219
You don't want to go in
and put 'em in water?

1156
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,987
The pipes are rusty.

1157
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,356
We have brown water.
It would kill the flowers.

1158
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,191
I'll, uh, I'll carry them.

1159
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:23,628
You look nice.
That's a beautiful necklace.

1160
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:28,198
What? Oh... thanks.

1161
00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:30,300
If only they were real.

1162
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,903
Shall we go?

1163
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:35,640
Sure.

1164
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:38,342
Who does that car
belong to?

1165
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,678
What car?
Oh, the Mercedes.

1166
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:43,480
I don't know.
You don't know?

1167
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:45,983
Well, I don't know
who actually owns it.

1168
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:48,585
I only rented it
for a couple of days.

1169
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:53,891
You rented a 1982
Mercedes Benz convertible?

1170
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,926
It was the only one
that they had left,

1171
00:59:55,993 --> 00:59:58,395
but they're charging me
the same as they would a Chevy.

1172
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:00,597
That's their policy.

1173
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:04,735
You didn't like
the motorbike?
I loved it.

1174
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:08,072
You loved it?
You don't love it anymore?

1175
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:11,208
I don't have it anymore.
It was stolen in a parking lot.

1176
01:00:13,678 --> 01:00:15,880
But I told the police.

1177
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,082
I'm surprised
they didn't tell you.

1178
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:20,851
They tell me when
other vehicles are stolen.

1179
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:24,154
They don't tell me
when it's mine.

1180
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:27,658
You mean, the man tells you
he has no Chevys or Fords left,

1181
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:30,094
so he gives you a Mercedes
at the same price?

1182
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,562
I guess I'll have to pay
for the mileage.

1183
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,198
I really don't know.

1184
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:37,334
Is that all we're going
to talk about tonight - cars?

1185
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:39,837
Sorry. They just
fascinate me.

1186
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:42,339
Listen, is there
something wrong?

1187
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:45,275
I mean,
other than their stealing
your bike - our bike?

1188
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:48,078
I am gonna pay for that bike,
every cent.

1189
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,647
I just need a little time.
I don't care about the bike.

1190
01:00:50,715 --> 01:00:52,950
What I care about
is what's happening to you.

1191
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:57,154
I'm glad you do. It's just
that going out right now
comes at such a bad time.

1192
01:00:57,221 --> 01:00:58,555
Why is that?

1193
01:00:58,622 --> 01:01:02,192
I'm really going through
a very trying period
right now.

1194
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:05,162
I've got a lot on my mind,
and, I don't know, maybe
for the time being,

1195
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:08,232
it would be better if we didn't
see so much of each other.

1196
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:09,599
This is our first date.

1197
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,168
I realize that.

1198
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:13,904
It's just that Michael
is very insecure

1199
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:16,073
about me seeing people - men.

1200
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,542
It's not that he doesn't
like you. He does.

1201
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,711
I'm just not sure
that he is ready

1202
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:22,913
to accept someone new
in the house just now.

1203
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,415
I haven't been
in the house yet.

1204
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:27,184
I know. I know.

1205
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:31,055
He's 15.
It's a very difficult age.

1206
01:01:31,121 --> 01:01:32,522
I understand.

1207
01:01:32,589 --> 01:01:34,825
My kid's 14.
It's a tough time.

1208
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:37,427
Oh, no, 15 is worse.
They're very weird at 15.

1209
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,696
So maybe if you didn't
come around for a while...

1210
01:01:39,764 --> 01:01:41,198
This way, please.

1211
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:43,700
Thank you.

1212
01:01:43,768 --> 01:01:46,670
I don't know.
I can't think straight.

1213
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:49,907
I've lost 37 exam papers
and 2 vehicles,
all in one week.

1214
01:01:49,974 --> 01:01:51,942
It's the money, too,
isn't it?

1215
01:01:52,009 --> 01:01:53,911
I know what it's like
to be that broke.

1216
01:01:53,978 --> 01:01:56,246
It can make you half crazy.

1217
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:59,249
Would you give me
the honor and the privilege
of loaning you some money?

1218
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:01,118
I don't want any money.

1219
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:03,587
I haven't asked you
for any money, have I?

1220
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:06,223
No, you wouldn't.
That's why I thought -
Well, you're wrong.

1221
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:08,893
I appreciate it,
but please don't offer me
any money anymore.

1222
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:10,828
It makes me feel terrible.
I'll get it.

1223
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:12,362
(gasps) Shit.

1224
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:14,398
What's that?
Nothing.

1225
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:15,933
Could we please
just order?

1226
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,869
Was that $5,000 in cash?

1227
01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:21,005
I don't know.
I didn't count it.
Waiter?

1228
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:23,140
What are you doing
with $5,000 in cash?

1229
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:25,175
How's the halibut?
It's delicious, ma'am.

1230
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,078
It's not mine.
It's the school's.
The school's?

1231
01:02:28,145 --> 01:02:30,848
Yes. I'm on
the finance committee.
It's parents' donations.

1232
01:02:30,915 --> 01:02:32,883
We're building
a brand-new swimming pool.

1233
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,985
What are you doing
carrying it around in cash?

1234
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:37,554
Well, why not?
I'm having dinner
with a cop, aren't I?

1235
01:02:37,621 --> 01:02:39,556
It's safer
than being at home.

1236
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:41,926
Could we...
just order, please?

1237
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:43,928
I'm going to be frank
with you.

1238
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:46,663
I had a lousy time.
I know. I'm sorry.

1239
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:48,732
It's all my fault.

1240
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:52,136
Do you wanna see me
again?
Yes.

1241
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:56,206
Can I come in
for a minute?
No.

1242
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,175
Why not?
I told you,
it's Michael.

1243
01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:00,210
No, it isn't.
You're lying.

1244
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,880
You're dealing
with a professional now.

1245
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:04,915
I'll go to your place.
Now?

1246
01:03:04,982 --> 01:03:07,117
Well, if you want me to.

1247
01:03:07,184 --> 01:03:09,219
Is that what you want?
Yes.

1248
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:11,455
You're lying again.
What is it with you?

1249
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:16,226
Listen, I'm trying
to keep so many people happy
all at the same time,

1250
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:19,496
and I'm not one of them,
but don't give up on me.

1251
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:21,665
I'm worth it, I promise.

1252
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:25,169
I'll, uh,
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

1253
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:27,204
Good night.

1254
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:29,239
Good night.

1255
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:31,241
Take it easy with him.
Don't pitch too fast.

1256
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,378
I want him to hit.
All right, Mikey, you're up.

1257
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:37,281
Come on, let's go.
(boy) Come on!
Go, Mike!

1258
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:39,283
Come on, kid.
Get ready, Craig.

1259
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:41,085
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

1260
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,653
All right, nice and easy.
Just keep your eye
on the ball.

1261
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,489
Let's go.
(boy) Come on, dude...

1262
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:48,458
Level bat, level bat.
Remember what I taught you.

1263
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:50,327
All right, Craig.
Go!

1264
01:03:50,394 --> 01:03:52,029
Pitch to him, now.

1265
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:58,102
(boys groaning)
No pressure.
No pre--

1266
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,570
Hey, guys, come on.
Let's hear some chatter...

1267
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:02,372
(boy) Aw, man.

1268
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:04,608
Just concentrate.
Just concentrate.

1269
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,610
You can do it.
Come on.

1270
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:07,945
Look alive.

1271
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:09,846
(clapping)

1272
01:04:09,914 --> 01:04:11,949
All right, Craig,
let's go, let's go!

1273
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:13,317
(boy) Aw, man!

1274
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:15,185
Michael, you're pressing
too hard. That's it.

1275
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:16,921
Just take it nice and easy,
all right?

1276
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:18,923
Yeah.
Hey, you're not pitching
the All-Stars.

1277
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,225
Take it easy.
Pitch to him.

1278
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,260
Just don't press.
Level bat.

1279
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:25,262
Keep your eyes on the ball.
That's all you gotta do.

1280
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:29,633
It'll be all yours.
It'll be over the fence.
OK.

1281
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,435
(boys groan)

1282
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:34,304
Oh, man, if you can't hit,
let somebody else practice.

1283
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,606
(coach) Pipe down, Pop.
It's all right, Mikey.

1284
01:04:36,673 --> 01:04:39,343
Come on, you can do it.
Let's go. Wait, wait, wait.

1285
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:42,279
Are you sure you're OK?
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1286
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:44,814
All right, you can do it.
I believe in you.

1287
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,683
That's all you need.
(boys laughing)

1288
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,252
All right, Craig.

1289
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:51,956
(Pop) Next.
Damn.

1290
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:54,758
(coach)
Mikey, take it easy, now.
What's the matter with him?

1291
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:57,962
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's gonna be all right.
All right. OK.

1292
01:04:58,028 --> 01:05:00,730
Danny, why don't you
hit a few?

1293
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:03,533
Are you Michael McPhee?
Yeah.

1294
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,970
I'm Charley Lau.
You ever heard of me?
No.

1295
01:05:06,036 --> 01:05:08,072
I'm the batting coach
for the White Sox.

1296
01:05:08,138 --> 01:05:10,774
What White Sox?
Chicago White Sox.

1297
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,609
I've been watching you
swing the bat,

1298
01:05:12,676 --> 01:05:15,745
and you stink,
you know that?
Oh, yeah, no kidding.

1299
01:05:15,812 --> 01:05:17,814
It's not your fault.

1300
01:05:17,881 --> 01:05:20,250
No one taught you
the basics.

1301
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:22,786
If you wanna learn,
I'd like to teach 'em to ya.

1302
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:25,055
Are you serious?
Yep.

1303
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:27,757
Why would you waste your time
teaching me?

1304
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:30,227
I'm not wasting my time.
I'm well paid.

1305
01:05:30,294 --> 01:05:33,163
I got a nice check in the mail
along with a letter that said,

1306
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:35,699
"Teach this young man
a basic swing

1307
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,701
and the philosophy
of hitting."

1308
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,204
The philosophy of hitting?

1309
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,272
You don't have
the right philosophy,

1310
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:44,408
you're not gonna
hit your weight.

1311
01:05:44,474 --> 01:05:45,675
You understand?

1312
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:48,912
Yeah... I understand.

1313
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:51,215
Thanks a lot, Mr. Lau.

1314
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,217
Well, pal,
we got some talkin' to do.

1315
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,219
When they're done,
we're gonna work,

1316
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:57,754
but we're gonna talk
right now,

1317
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:00,724
and we're gonna talk about
what we're gonna do
out there.

1318
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,160
We're gonna work
on stance, a balanced,
workable stance

1319
01:06:03,227 --> 01:06:07,431
that allows you
to swing the bat
and not turn your head.

1320
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:10,600
Take your stance
and let's see what happens.

1321
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:14,904
Let's just see if you
are balanced to start with.

1322
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,075
That's not awful,
awful good.

1323
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:20,010
Where's the weight
on your feet?

1324
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:22,346
It's on this foot.

1325
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:25,515
I don't know
of anything you can do

1326
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:27,217
sittin' like that.

1327
01:06:27,284 --> 01:06:29,486
Now, if that guy's
not your friend -

1328
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:30,987
and believe me,
he's not your friend -

1329
01:06:31,055 --> 01:06:34,791
you have got to get positive
and aggressive,

1330
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:36,693
and you've got to go at him.

1331
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,063
Keep that distance,
relaxed and nice and...

1332
01:06:39,129 --> 01:06:41,398
There can't be any tension.

1333
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:43,300
If this is a tee

1334
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:45,769
and you're gonna
hit that ball off the tee,

1335
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,704
what would you do?

1336
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:49,706
Go ahead and hit it.
OK.

1337
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:51,641
Swing at it and hit it.

1338
01:06:53,077 --> 01:06:56,246
All of a sudden,
we're gonna do this, all right?

1339
01:06:56,313 --> 01:06:59,249
Nice little wiggle.
That works.

1340
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:02,852
I want you to be aware
of the discipline
of your head

1341
01:07:02,919 --> 01:07:04,821
and a good transfer
of the weight.

1342
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:08,425
I want you to get
to a firm front side
and explode your hips.

1343
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:12,096
Keep the head.
Try and hit
that handkerchief.

1344
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:18,168
Not bad.
Let's do it again.

1345
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:21,671
Hey, dummy, you can't hit
what you can't see.

1346
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,410
I like it.
You got a chance.

1347
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:30,080
(bat cracking)

1348
01:07:30,147 --> 01:07:31,715
Gettin' better.
I like it.

1349
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:34,484
Michael, I need
a little more wiggle now.

1350
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,052
Relax.

1351
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,122
Come on, dummy.

1352
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:41,091
(bat cracks)

1353
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:43,560
Oh! I did it!

1354
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:44,928
(laughs)

1355
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:46,963
Oh! Oh! Ha!

1356
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:49,099
(grunting)

1357
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:51,067
I did it.
Mike, what a shot.

1358
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:52,402
What a shot.

1359
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:54,671
(laughs)

1360
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:56,406
Whoa!

1361
01:08:00,344 --> 01:08:02,746
You're a genius.
You genius!

1362
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:04,181
Oh!

1363
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:09,553
...three of them
over the fence.

1364
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:12,088
Charley says
he has to leave in a week
to go back to spring training.

1365
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:14,858
He's gonna try
and come back on Saturday
when we play the Bears.

1366
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,360
That's terrific, Mike.

1367
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,662
I couldn't believe
that it was really
Charley Lau

1368
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:20,764
until he mentioned
the philosophy
of hitting.

1369
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,333
Then I knew who it was
who sent that check.

1370
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:52,529
Hi. Hello.

1371
01:08:52,596 --> 01:08:53,697
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1372
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:56,966
I like what you did
to your house,
honey.

1373
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:59,903
Oh, thank you,
Mrs. Litke.

1374
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,305
(giggles)

1375
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:04,941
I like what you did
to your car, too.

1376
01:09:05,008 --> 01:09:06,543
Yes, the car.
Of course.

1377
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:08,978
Here, I'll get the gate
for you.

1378
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:11,748
I think
it's just beautiful.

1379
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,356
I like the front
even better.

1380
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:22,992
Come on, Tiger.
Come on, Popeye.

1381
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:25,329
Well, how did he...?
Oh, that's...
(dogs barking)

1382
01:09:25,395 --> 01:09:27,697
Pigeons and doves.

1383
01:09:31,368 --> 01:09:33,937
They raise
the teachers' salary
this year?

1384
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:37,941
No, no, no. I've been doing
private tutoring in the evening.

1385
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,244
Who you tutoring - Arabs?

1386
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:45,215
Promise me
you won't get angry?
You got an airplane in there.

1387
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:47,584
He brought you a tiny,
little jet plane in there.

1388
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:50,186
Is that what it is?
If you let me keep
this one,

1389
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:52,522
I'll give back
everything else,
I promise.

1390
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,127
I'll pay for this one
myself.

1391
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:01,831
Open the door.

1392
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:05,101
(barking)

1393
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:06,970
His name's Plato.

1394
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,171
It was on his collar.

1395
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:09,506
Plato?

1396
01:10:09,573 --> 01:10:11,941
Yeah, you know, like the dog
from Mickey Mouse.

1397
01:10:12,008 --> 01:10:13,610
Pluto.

1398
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:16,346
Yeah, whatever.
Isn't he beautiful?
He's a purebred.

1399
01:10:16,413 --> 01:10:19,015
Yeah. He comes
from royal lineage.

1400
01:10:19,082 --> 01:10:21,918
You can still see
the little marks
on his head

1401
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:23,853
where he used to wear
a crown.

1402
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,322
Max.
Yeah?

1403
01:10:25,389 --> 01:10:26,890
We have to talk.
Oh, sure.

1404
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:30,193
Mike, you wanna take Plato
out for a walk?
Sure.

1405
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,361
Does he fetch?

1406
01:10:31,428 --> 01:10:34,331
He fetches, he builds,
he destroys.

1407
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:35,332
Anything you want.

1408
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:37,000
Come here, Plato.

1409
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,369
(laughing)

1410
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:42,439
Come on.
(Plato barks)

1411
01:10:42,506 --> 01:10:45,442
Well, you don't have to worry
about bathing him.

1412
01:10:45,509 --> 01:10:47,243
I can always take him
to a car wash.
(cat screeches)

1413
01:10:47,311 --> 01:10:49,446
I can't fight ya
anymore, Max.

1414
01:10:49,513 --> 01:10:51,848
Should have seen the look
on Mike's face

1415
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,351
when he powered that ball
over the fence today.

1416
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:56,052
Damn, it was terrific.

1417
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:59,489
You were there
in broad daylight?

1418
01:10:59,556 --> 01:11:03,427
Yeah. I'd have cashed
my tickets in today
to see that.

1419
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:06,496
(coughs)
What's wrong?
Are you in pain?

1420
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:09,265
Well, we may have to
cut our visit

1421
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:12,802
a little shorter
than planned.

1422
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:14,871
(murmurs) Water.

1423
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:18,775
Ahh.

1424
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:20,176
Nora, my love,

1425
01:11:20,243 --> 01:11:22,846
I'm havin' one hell
of a grand time.

1426
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:25,449
If I knew it was gonna be
this much fun,

1427
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:27,451
I'd have had
a dozen grandchildren.

1428
01:11:27,517 --> 01:11:29,686
Now you listen to me, Max.

1429
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:31,755
You're not gonna
give up on me now.

1430
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:34,290
I don't care
how much strength it takes.

1431
01:11:34,358 --> 01:11:36,460
You're gonna fight,
and I'm gonna help you.

1432
01:11:36,526 --> 01:11:38,495
I'll do whatever you want.

1433
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,434
You wanna buy Mike and me
a present?
Yeah.

1434
01:11:44,501 --> 01:11:47,571
Buy me six more months
with an option for another six,

1435
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,706
and then we'll negotiate
from there.

1436
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:52,041
Is it a deal?

1437
01:11:56,380 --> 01:12:00,484
And if you ever
run out on me again,
I'll never forgive you.

1438
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,269
(* rock on radio)

1439
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,238
Have a nice day!
(Nora) You, too!

1440
01:12:22,305 --> 01:12:25,041
I'll get the gate!

1441
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,091
(door opens/
Plato barking)

1442
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:49,098
Can I help you?

1443
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:53,503
I'm sorry. I was lookin'
for Miss McPhee.

1444
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:55,939
Oh, she's at school.
Oh.

1445
01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:57,741
How'd you get in?

1446
01:12:57,807 --> 01:13:00,644
Well, she must have
left the door unlocked.
I knocked, and...

1447
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,379
My name's Brian Costello.
I'm a friend of hers.

1448
01:13:03,447 --> 01:13:06,049
She left these flowers
in my car the other night.

1449
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:08,718
Oh, thank you.
I'll take care of them.
Thank you.

1450
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:10,920
I do odd jobs for her
now and then.

1451
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:12,456
Do ya?

1452
01:13:12,522 --> 01:13:13,723
She didn't tell me.

1453
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:15,725
Sort of a caretaker,
are ya?

1454
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:19,028
No, no. I pick up a meal
here and there.

1455
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:24,701
Anything you want me
to tell her?

1456
01:13:24,768 --> 01:13:28,237
No, no, no. No, I'll, uh,
I'll drop by the school later.

1457
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:30,373
Anything you want me
to tell her?

1458
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,542
Can't think of anything.
Good.

1459
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:34,944
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Mister, uh...
Parker.

1460
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:37,747
Parker.

1461
01:13:37,814 --> 01:13:38,882
Thank you.

1462
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:41,017
See ya.

1463
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:50,393
(Plato barking)

1464
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,629
Parker?

1465
01:13:52,696 --> 01:13:54,564
Do you do plumbing?

1466
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:56,365
I'm always having trouble
with my plumbing.

1467
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,967
Little out of my line.

1468
01:13:58,034 --> 01:14:00,303
I'm moving out of state
in a few days, anyway.

1469
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:02,706
Aw, Miss McPhee's
going to miss you.

1470
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,908
You've done
just terrific work here,

1471
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:07,176
especially when you consider
her income.

1472
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,724
(camera shutter clicking)

1473
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:31,568
I'll have the salad,
a small grapefruit juice,

1474
01:14:31,635 --> 01:14:33,603
coffee - black, no sugar.

1475
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:36,906
(man) You got it?
Thanks. OK.

1476
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:39,208
If they stole the Mercedes,
I don't wanna hear about it.

1477
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:42,145
I thought
you were gonna call.
I'm sorry. I've been busy.

1478
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:44,614
Collecting more money
for the swimming pool?

1479
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:46,616
I saw one downstairs
in the basement.

1480
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:48,585
What'd they do -
rent it for the weekend?

1481
01:14:48,652 --> 01:14:50,520
I've only got 15 minutes
for lunch.

1482
01:14:50,587 --> 01:14:53,089
Could we talk about this
some other time?
I went by your house.

1483
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:55,491
I'm really crazy
about the paint job.
It's a rented house.

1484
01:14:55,559 --> 01:14:57,393
The landlord owed it to me
for two years.

1485
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:00,029
Mrs. Litke
has the same landlord,
and she's been there ten years.

1486
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:02,065
She doesn't know how
to talk to him.

1487
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:05,735
He give you the dog
as a bonus?
What dog?

1488
01:15:05,802 --> 01:15:08,738
The big one.
The one in the backyard.

1489
01:15:08,805 --> 01:15:10,807
The one that looks
down into the house.

1490
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:13,643
Michael wanted a dog,
and we certainly
can't afford one.

1491
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,845
So we went down to the pound
and picked him out.

1492
01:15:15,912 --> 01:15:17,914
That dog
has championship class.

1493
01:15:17,981 --> 01:15:19,916
He probably cost
$2,000, $3,000.

1494
01:15:19,983 --> 01:15:21,751
You mean
nobody claimed him?

1495
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:23,720
Maybe he was badly treated.

1496
01:15:23,787 --> 01:15:26,122
There are a lot of rotten
rich people in the world.

1497
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:29,926
I think it's time you and I
had a little talk, Nora...

1498
01:15:29,993 --> 01:15:31,595
in private.

1499
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:36,132
Your neighbor, Mrs. Litke,
makes a routine call
to the police

1500
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:38,935
complaining
about a large dog barking
in the middle of the night,

1501
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:41,270
but we're a little busy
for dog-barking complaints.

1502
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:44,340
But the boys
put it in the computer,
just for future reference.

1503
01:15:44,407 --> 01:15:47,744
The computer punches out
that the dog owner just had
a car and a motorcycle stolen

1504
01:15:47,811 --> 01:15:49,679
and also recently called

1505
01:15:49,746 --> 01:15:51,648
to complain
about an obscene caller

1506
01:15:51,715 --> 01:15:54,050
and a possible prowl suspect.

1507
01:15:54,117 --> 01:15:57,787
When the name
of Mrs. Nora McPhee - widow,

1508
01:15:57,854 --> 01:15:59,756
mother, schoolteacher -
prints out,

1509
01:15:59,823 --> 01:16:02,091
the card, naturally,
is dropped on my desk

1510
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:04,928
by a burly sergeant
with raised eyebrows.

1511
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:06,596
Shall I go on?

1512
01:16:06,663 --> 01:16:08,297
Do I have a choice?

1513
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:10,934
Mrs. keen-eyed Litke

1514
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,304
volunteered that delivery vans
pull up to your house
twice a day,

1515
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:16,773
including Saturdays,

1516
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,575
unloading large boxes
bearing such distinguished names

1517
01:16:19,643 --> 01:16:21,110
as Westinghouse,

1518
01:16:21,177 --> 01:16:23,379
General Electric,
Honeywell, Mitsubishi.

1519
01:16:23,446 --> 01:16:25,214
This, compounded by the fact

1520
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:28,117
that one of the lowest-paid
Mercedes-driving employees
of the county

1521
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:31,721
carries around $5,000
in brand-new bills,

1522
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:35,391
compels me to ask
a very serious question -

1523
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,027
what the hell is going on here?

1524
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:40,129
There is a kid
not 50 yards from here

1525
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:42,165
who is selling drugs
to 14-year-olds.

1526
01:16:42,231 --> 01:16:44,300
Surely you have
more important things to do

1527
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:46,602
than drag a schoolteacher
away from her lunch.

1528
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:49,605
Who is the man
living in your house?

1529
01:16:49,673 --> 01:16:51,207
What man?

1530
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,144
This man.

1531
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:56,846
Mr. Parker.

1532
01:16:56,913 --> 01:16:58,948
Does odd jobs, he tells me.

1533
01:16:59,015 --> 01:17:02,418
Came ten days ago
wearing a black hat,
black coat,

1534
01:17:02,485 --> 01:17:05,054
carrying a black satchel.

1535
01:17:06,322 --> 01:17:10,193
Mrs. Litke is more dependable
than the CIA.

1536
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:11,494
Who is he, Nora?

1537
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,363
An uncle,
a relative from back east.

1538
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,232
A close relative?

1539
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:18,401
No. He's only staying
a couple of weeks.

1540
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:23,006
He deposited $400,000
in California First Federal
this morning, in cash.

1541
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:25,441
It's none of my business.
I'm late.

1542
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:28,244
The account was opened
in your name.

1543
01:17:30,747 --> 01:17:33,116
Talk to me, Nora.

1544
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:34,818
I can't.

1545
01:17:34,884 --> 01:17:37,353
Please, don't ask me
anything else, Brian.

1546
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:40,924
What are you mixed up in?
I'm just trying to help you.

1547
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,960
Asking me questions
is not going to help me.

1548
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:46,763
Why is he so generous to you?
What does he owe ya?

1549
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:49,632
Nothing! He's just very rich
and very eccentric.

1550
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:51,600
He does things like that.

1551
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,137
It's his Mercedes.
He's taking it with him.

1552
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:55,638
And the 400,000?

1553
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:59,075
Can't you stop being a cop
for five minutes
and be a friend?

1554
01:17:59,142 --> 01:18:01,377
No. That's why
I don't have too many friends.

1555
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:04,180
Well, if it's one less
you want, you're doing
a terrific job.

1556
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:06,415
Nora.

1557
01:18:08,317 --> 01:18:11,620
I don't buy any of it.
I been at this job too long.

1558
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,422
I don't think he's your uncle.

1559
01:18:13,489 --> 01:18:16,259
I think you're
involved with something
you don't know how to handle.

1560
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:19,195
I'm going to take this picture
and follow up on it.

1561
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:22,065
If you've got anything
you want to tell me,
you better tell me now.

1562
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:25,368
All right.
Good-bye, Brian.

1563
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:28,905
(bell rings)

1564
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:39,048
$3, please.

1565
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,052
Thank you.
Thank you.

1566
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:44,720
No prob.

1567
01:18:48,024 --> 01:18:50,426
* Na-na ja ba-da dunh *

1568
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,234
Wow.

1569
01:18:58,301 --> 01:19:01,237
Fantastic.

1570
01:19:01,304 --> 01:19:04,707
Gee, this must have cost
a fortune.

1571
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:07,977
You like it, Ma?
Where were you?

1572
01:19:08,044 --> 01:19:10,814
I went to pick you up
after school.
You weren't there.

1573
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,282
I stayed late
to practice hitting
with Charley,

1574
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:15,118
and I took a taxi home.

1575
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:17,821
A taxi?
It's OK. I had money.

1576
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:20,056
Give it to me.

1577
01:19:20,123 --> 01:19:22,859
You are not to accept
any more gifts,
you understand?

1578
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:25,128
No watches, no TV,
no taxi money, no dogs.

1579
01:19:25,194 --> 01:19:26,662
Nothing.
Is that understood?

1580
01:19:26,729 --> 01:19:30,099
Yeah, sure, but Mr. Wittgenstein
said that you wouldn't mind.

1581
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:34,103
He is not Mr. Wittgenstein
or Mr. Parker.

1582
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:36,739
He is Mr. Dugan.
Max Dugan.

1583
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:39,675
He is my father
and your grandfather.

1584
01:19:39,742 --> 01:19:41,277
My grandfather?

1585
01:19:41,344 --> 01:19:44,313
And he spent six years in jail
for embezzling and forging,

1586
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,749
and all of this money
doesn't belong to him

1587
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:48,818
and it doesn't belong to us,

1588
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:51,354
and everything is going back,
including Pluto.

1589
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,755
Plato.
Whoever he is.

1590
01:19:52,822 --> 01:19:54,523
Michael,
he is in trouble,

1591
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:58,828
and I have got to
figure out something
really fast.

1592
01:19:58,895 --> 01:20:01,564
(sighs) I didn't realize
how happy we were

1593
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,566
before all this came.

1594
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:06,535
I mean, I think we managed
pretty well, didn't we?

1595
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:09,405
I thought so.
(* violin)

1596
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:11,440
Me too.

1597
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:32,328
Max!
(Max) It's open.

1598
01:20:38,601 --> 01:20:40,603
(* violin continues)

1599
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:44,007
If I had six more months,
I could learn to play
this damn thing.

1600
01:20:44,073 --> 01:20:46,142
(music stops)

1601
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:49,578
Oh, you don't like
the living room.
I can tell.

1602
01:20:49,645 --> 01:20:51,214
Max.
Hmm?

1603
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,884
You gotta leave - today.
Tonight. The police
know you're here.

1604
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:56,452
I know. We met.

1605
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:59,088
He's smart, that one.
I can always tell
by the eyes.

1606
01:20:59,155 --> 01:21:03,259
He doesn't know who you are,
but he's got a picture of you
taken outside of a bank.

1607
01:21:03,326 --> 01:21:06,129
Well, I'm slipping, Nora.
Not as sharp as I used to be.

1608
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:09,665
Listen, I've got an idea,
a plan.
Yeah?

1609
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:11,700
I think you should
give yourself up.

1610
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:13,836
You interrupted Bach
to tell me that?

1611
01:21:13,903 --> 01:21:16,906
If you give back all the money,
maybe they won't press charges.

1612
01:21:16,973 --> 01:21:19,608
Considering your condition,
they wouldn't be anxious
to prosecute.

1613
01:21:19,675 --> 01:21:22,478
You could stay with Mike and me
for as long as you wanted.

1614
01:21:22,545 --> 01:21:24,547
All three of us living
on your salary?

1615
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:27,516
Heart failure
doesn't frighten me,
but malnutrition does.

1616
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:30,920
Aw, come on.
We could work something out.
At least we'd all be together.

1617
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:33,256
I am not going to my grave

1618
01:21:33,322 --> 01:21:35,891
without leaving some security
for you and Mike.

1619
01:21:35,959 --> 01:21:38,928
It's all I been living for,
for chrissake.

1620
01:21:38,995 --> 01:21:41,530
I'm not giving myself up.

1621
01:21:41,597 --> 01:21:44,600
You told me in this very room
to put up a fight,

1622
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:48,104
and I'll be damned
if I'll take the count
without doing it.

1623
01:21:50,339 --> 01:21:51,740
(sighs)

1624
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:54,510
Damn it. I blew it.

1625
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:58,347
I could be sitting
on a sandy white beach
in Brazil right now,

1626
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:02,986
drinking piÃ±a coladas
and fornicating my way
straight to heaven.

1627
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:06,122
What if we went away
together, all of us,

1628
01:22:06,189 --> 01:22:08,024
to New Mexico or Arizona?

1629
01:22:08,091 --> 01:22:11,827
I could teach, get a job,
just until -

1630
01:22:11,894 --> 01:22:13,796
And the detective?

1631
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:16,966
He's more interested
in getting his man
than his woman.

1632
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:19,335
You'd do that for me? Why?

1633
01:22:19,402 --> 01:22:21,704
I'd miss your pancakes
in the morning.

1634
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,907
You've grown into
an extraordinary
young woman, Nora,

1635
01:22:24,974 --> 01:22:27,010
and I deserve
all the credit.

1636
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:31,580
If I didn't abandon you,
God knows what would have
happened to you.

1637
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:34,050
(both laugh)

1638
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:36,085
Well, let's sleep on it,

1639
01:22:36,152 --> 01:22:38,387
and we'll discuss it
in the morning.

1640
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,990
No, we go in the morning.
You mean, we just -

1641
01:22:41,057 --> 01:22:43,392
Yep, just go
with the clothes
on our backs.

1642
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:45,694
There's a moral
to all this, you know.
What?

1643
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:48,731
It doesn't always pay
to get in touch with
your children.

1644
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:51,134
Oh, is that so?

1645
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:58,041
Mike?

1646
01:22:59,108 --> 01:23:01,044
Hey, Mike.

1647
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:05,314
What time is it?

1648
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:08,317
Huh?
I don't know. Uh...

1649
01:23:08,384 --> 01:23:11,220
(watch beeps tune)
In Singapore,
it's around lunchtime.

1650
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:13,622
Are you just coming in?

1651
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:16,225
No, I'm going out.

1652
01:23:17,593 --> 01:23:19,995
I'm leaving, Mike.
Leaving for where?

1653
01:23:20,063 --> 01:23:23,766
Oh, south. You know me -
easy come, easy go.

1654
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,801
You mean for good?

1655
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:29,004
No. You see, in the East,
they have a philosophy.

1656
01:23:29,072 --> 01:23:31,140
Once you meet
a man you like,

1657
01:23:31,207 --> 01:23:34,177
you're destined
to meet him again.

1658
01:23:34,243 --> 01:23:36,312
Are you going
because of the police?

1659
01:23:36,379 --> 01:23:39,415
Your mother told ya, huh?

1660
01:23:39,482 --> 01:23:41,784
Well, sort of.

1661
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,120
You see, if I hang around,

1662
01:23:44,187 --> 01:23:46,589
it makes your mother
kind of an accessory.

1663
01:23:46,655 --> 01:23:48,991
She could go to jail,

1664
01:23:49,058 --> 01:23:51,160
and I lied to you
before, Mike.

1665
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:55,164
The only thing
I ever learned in jail

1666
01:23:55,231 --> 01:23:58,267
was that it was
a terrific place
to stay out of.

1667
01:23:58,334 --> 01:24:01,237
So keep your nose clean.

1668
01:24:01,304 --> 01:24:04,107
Keep your eye on the ball.

1669
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,815
So long, kid.

1670
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:20,456
So I'll probably
be heading for

1671
01:24:20,523 --> 01:24:24,227
those white sandy beaches
and piÃ±a coladas.

1672
01:24:24,293 --> 01:24:27,130
I didn't deposit
all the money.

1673
01:24:27,196 --> 01:24:31,967
I may be sentimental,
but I'm not stupid.

1674
01:24:32,034 --> 01:24:33,636
Thank you both

1675
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:36,372
for the best two weeks
of my life.

1676
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:39,508
Sorry I won't be there
for the game today, Mike,

1677
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:43,179
but if you happen
to get ahold of a long one,

1678
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:45,248
as you're rounding the bases,

1679
01:24:45,314 --> 01:24:48,717
I'd be very proud and pleased
if you said,

1680
01:24:48,784 --> 01:24:51,320
"That one was for you,
Wittgenstein."

1681
01:24:53,289 --> 01:24:57,160
Be sure you destroy this tape
after you've heard it.

1682
01:24:57,226 --> 01:24:59,628
(click)

1683
01:25:09,972 --> 01:25:12,007
Why did he leave?

1684
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:14,009
I didn't tell you
everything, Mike.

1685
01:25:14,076 --> 01:25:16,279
I didn't tell you
that he was sick.

1686
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:18,847
I think he was grateful
for whatever time he did have.

1687
01:25:18,914 --> 01:25:22,218
If you knew that,
why did you let him
leave here?

1688
01:25:22,285 --> 01:25:24,653
I offered to move,
the three of us,

1689
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,355
but it was his decision.

1690
01:25:26,422 --> 01:25:28,391
I mean,
how could I stop him?

1691
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:30,393
I don't know.
You're a teacher.

1692
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:33,329
You could have thought
of something.

1693
01:25:35,764 --> 01:25:38,634
(siren wailing)

1694
01:25:48,911 --> 01:25:51,580
I'm a police officer,
that is a police car,

1695
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:54,317
and that is a siren
on a police car.

1696
01:25:54,383 --> 01:25:57,320
Now, when you hear
a police officer
yell, "Stop,"

1697
01:25:57,386 --> 01:26:00,389
you goddamn well
better stop...
Was I speeding?

1698
01:26:00,456 --> 01:26:02,458
Did I go
through a red light?

1699
01:26:02,525 --> 01:26:05,528
Did I make a right-hand turn
in the left-hand lane?

1700
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:08,764
If you stop me,
you better goddamn well
have a reason to stop me!

1701
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:11,800
I have.

1702
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:14,870
He's your father,
isn't he?
That's right.

1703
01:26:14,937 --> 01:26:17,606
There any more questions?
I have a ball game to go to.

1704
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:20,108
You know he's wanted
in Las Vegas, not only
by the police

1705
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,845
but by some
very irate gentlemen
who break your legs...

1706
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:26,382
If it's money you want,
pull up a van and take away
the house, including the car.

1707
01:26:26,449 --> 01:26:27,983
Now get out of my way.

1708
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:30,253
Where is he?
I believe he went
for a piÃ±a colada.

1709
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:33,289
They're gonna ask questions,
Nora, like "Did you know
where the money came from?"

1710
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:35,391
Of course I did.
He told me.

1711
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:38,193
You're not under oath.
You don't have to
stick to that.

1712
01:26:38,261 --> 01:26:39,562
Move along.

1713
01:26:39,628 --> 01:26:41,764
Why shouldn't I?
He's my father.

1714
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:44,533
He came to me in trouble.
What do you expect me to do?

1715
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,202
I'm a goddamned detective.
What do you expect me to do?

1716
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:49,204
The chief of police
is not your father.

1717
01:26:49,272 --> 01:26:51,274
Our problems have nothing
in common.

1718
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:54,843
You don't understand.
It's your neck I'm worried
about, not your father's.

1719
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:57,680
Now give me a break,
will ya? Where is he?

1720
01:26:57,746 --> 01:27:00,182
I don't know.
Yes, you do.
Of course you do.

1721
01:27:00,249 --> 01:27:02,184
I always know
when you're lying.

1722
01:27:02,251 --> 01:27:04,320
You wanna end up
in jail, Nora?

1723
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:06,289
I'll wait for ya
'cause I'm nuts about ya,

1724
01:27:06,355 --> 01:27:08,257
but I won't see you
on weekends.

1725
01:27:08,324 --> 01:27:10,593
I see my kid on weekends.

1726
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:13,629
I'm going to Michael's
baseball game.

1727
01:27:13,696 --> 01:27:17,199
If you wanna stop me, you're
going to have to shoot me.

1728
01:27:17,266 --> 01:27:20,303
Nora!

1729
01:27:20,369 --> 01:27:24,440
Here, take the Mercedes.
You'll never get a cab
in this neighborhood.

1730
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:27,242
Thank you.

1731
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:29,912
Tell me something.

1732
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:32,315
Do you think I'm corrupt?

1733
01:27:32,381 --> 01:27:34,450
Aren't we all,
just a little bit?

1734
01:27:34,517 --> 01:27:36,719
Just a little bit?

1735
01:27:44,827 --> 01:27:47,129
(spectators cheering)
Come on, Craig.

1736
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:50,399
Come on, Craig.
He's getting tired!

1737
01:27:50,466 --> 01:27:53,101
Come on.
Now whack it out!

1738
01:27:53,168 --> 01:27:55,203
(man) Right there
on the letters!
(cheer)

1739
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,872
Get a piece of it,
Craig!

1740
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:59,375
Hit the wild ball, kid!

1741
01:27:59,442 --> 01:28:01,844
Please, God,
don't leave it up to Michael.

1742
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:03,612
(team cheering)

1743
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:05,748
(Venice coach)
No problem, Craig.

1744
01:28:05,814 --> 01:28:08,784
You can do it, Craig.
Hit it outta here!

1745
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:11,286
Come on, Craig!
(cheerleaders chanting)
Santa Monica's number one!

1746
01:28:11,354 --> 01:28:13,556
Why didn't you tell me
how sick he was?

1747
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,958
Would it have made
any difference to you?

1748
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:18,060
Yeah. I don't know.

1749
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:19,895
How did you find out?

1750
01:28:19,962 --> 01:28:22,197
It's my job.

1751
01:28:22,264 --> 01:28:24,132
I'm sorry, Nora.

1752
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:25,934
Well, save your sympathy
for Michael.

1753
01:28:26,001 --> 01:28:28,437
We're losing 2 to nothing
in the ninth.

1754
01:28:28,504 --> 01:28:31,340
You're losing 2-nothing.

1755
01:28:31,407 --> 01:28:34,276
My boy plays for Santa Monica.

1756
01:28:34,343 --> 01:28:36,144
Let's go, Kevin, baby!

1757
01:28:36,211 --> 01:28:38,213
Your boy? Which one?
The one pitchin'.

1758
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,415
(Venice coach)
All right, Craig!

1759
01:28:39,482 --> 01:28:43,218
Don't swing!
Let him pitch to ya!

1760
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:45,020
Easy out, Kevin.

1761
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:46,655
Easy out.
That's your son?

1762
01:28:46,722 --> 01:28:49,658
He should be
in the major leagues.
I thought he was a midget.

1763
01:28:52,695 --> 01:28:54,029
(Venice coach) Yeah!

1764
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:56,632
All right, Craig! Great!

1765
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:58,734
(spectators cheering)

1766
01:28:58,801 --> 01:29:00,803
(spectators chanting)
Go, Mike, go!

1767
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:03,439
We're in a jam now, Mike.
You haven't hit your weight
all year.

1768
01:29:03,506 --> 01:29:05,474
We got a chance
to win this game,

1769
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:07,510
but I'm gonna leave it
up to you.

1770
01:29:07,576 --> 01:29:10,413
Want me to pinch-hit for you,
or you wanna swing?

1771
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:12,381
(spectators chanting)
Santa Monica's number one!

1772
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,517
I wanna swing.

1773
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:16,619
What plane
is he taking, Nora?

1774
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:19,588
You'll never catch him now.
I don't care
about catching him.

1775
01:29:19,655 --> 01:29:22,224
I care about you telling me.
Then you're off the hook.

1776
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:24,326
My kid's coming up to bat.

1777
01:29:24,393 --> 01:29:26,729
PiÃ±a colada, you said.
Tropical climate?

1778
01:29:26,795 --> 01:29:28,731
Come on, get ahold
of one, Michael!

1779
01:29:28,797 --> 01:29:31,133
You can do it now!
Riviera?

1780
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,035
Hawaii? Tahiti?

1781
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:34,937
South America?

1782
01:29:35,003 --> 01:29:37,072
You looked at me.
It's South America.

1783
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:39,274
Copacabana Beach. Brazil.

1784
01:29:39,341 --> 01:29:42,578
It's Brazil, isn't it?
...Michael, hit it
out of the park!

1785
01:29:42,645 --> 01:29:44,747
I'm calling the airlines,
Nora, right now.

1786
01:29:44,813 --> 01:29:47,049
You're gonna leave
while your son is pitching

1787
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:49,518
and my son
is gonna hit that ball
right out of the park.

1788
01:29:49,585 --> 01:29:50,786
Against Kevin?

1789
01:29:50,853 --> 01:29:52,488
For how much?

1790
01:29:52,555 --> 01:29:54,623
All the information
you want.

1791
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:58,126
(Venice coach)
Over the fence, Mikey.
Over the fence.

1792
01:29:58,193 --> 01:29:59,528
Come on, Michael!

1793
01:29:59,595 --> 01:30:01,864
Knock the hell
out of that goddamn ball!

1794
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:04,066
Just concentrate.
Put it all together, kid.

1795
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:05,701
(Craig's mother)
Wild man pitcher up there.

1796
01:30:05,768 --> 01:30:08,871
He can't pitch
to anything!

1797
01:30:08,937 --> 01:30:11,339
Strike!

1798
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,841
(Nora) Come on,
just concentrate!

1799
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:16,344
You can do it, Kevin!
Nobody up there!

1800
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:18,313
Swing, Michael!
Just one swing!

1801
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,382
Hit the shit
out of it!

1802
01:30:20,449 --> 01:30:22,818
Hey, Nora,
watch your language.

1803
01:30:22,885 --> 01:30:25,253
You're supposed to be
an English teacher.

1804
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,756
They stole my car, my bike,
my goddamned exam papers.

1805
01:30:27,823 --> 01:30:29,424
You gotta fight back
sometime.

1806
01:30:29,492 --> 01:30:30,793
Hit it, Michael!

1807
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:34,029
Hit it
for Gus Wittgenstein!

1808
01:30:35,498 --> 01:30:38,300
You're the best, Kevin!

1809
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:42,170
Come on! Remember
what Charley taught you,
Michael!

1810
01:30:42,237 --> 01:30:44,039
Now watch the ball!

1811
01:30:44,106 --> 01:30:45,741
Strike two!

1812
01:30:45,808 --> 01:30:48,611
It's OK, Mike.
Nothin' to worry about.

1813
01:30:48,677 --> 01:30:50,045
We're behind ya.

1814
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:53,048
For Schopenhauer, Michael,
and Spinoza

1815
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:55,884
and Sophocles and Aristotle!

1816
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:58,654
Come on, Kevin!
Doesn't even know the names
of her own team.

1817
01:30:58,721 --> 01:31:00,956
(Nora) Come on, Michael!

1818
01:31:01,023 --> 01:31:03,792
Do it for Pluto!
I mean, Plato...

1819
01:31:03,859 --> 01:31:05,794
(Venice coach)
Look alive there, kid.
Look alive!

1820
01:31:05,861 --> 01:31:08,363
...Michael!
You can do it!

1821
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:12,267
Please, God. Please?

1822
01:31:12,334 --> 01:31:13,736
(Brian) Come on, Kevin!

1823
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:17,673
(Venice coach)
Come on, Mikey.
Let's go!

1824
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:20,843
(Nora) Don't pay
any attention to Brian.

1825
01:31:22,344 --> 01:31:23,812
(bat cracks)

1826
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:56,178
Hey, son...
can I see that ball
for a minute?

1827
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:57,946
(cheering)

1828
01:31:58,013 --> 01:31:59,982
(screams)

1829
01:32:00,048 --> 01:32:02,585
Whoo!

1830
01:32:02,651 --> 01:32:04,286
He did it! He did it!

1831
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:07,590
I hate that kid of yours.
I'll get over it,
but I hate him.

1832
01:32:07,656 --> 01:32:10,125
That was for you,
Wittgenstein!

1833
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:12,595
(boy) Up yours, McPhee.

1834
01:32:12,661 --> 01:32:15,263
(cheering)

1835
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:19,868
That was some hit,
wasn't it?

1836
01:32:19,935 --> 01:32:22,337
Yeah, I just saw it.
Now give it back.
I tell you what.

1837
01:32:22,404 --> 01:32:24,072
You take $5 for it?

1838
01:32:24,139 --> 01:32:26,374
$5?
Yeah, and 5
for your friend here?

1839
01:32:26,441 --> 01:32:27,542
(both) Sure.

1840
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:29,544
Sold.

1841
01:32:31,714 --> 01:32:35,350
Thanks, boys.

1842
01:32:35,417 --> 01:32:38,887
That ball means a lot to me.

1843
01:32:38,954 --> 01:32:43,025
Oh, you were wonderful!
I can't even catch
my breath.

1844
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:46,729
I was so proud of you.
You know, I just wish
that he were here.

1845
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:51,566
I mean, I wish
that he were here to see it.
I know, sweetheart, I know.

1846
01:32:51,634 --> 01:32:53,401
No chance. You pitched
a terrific game.

1847
01:32:53,468 --> 01:32:56,538
Only somebody like Hank Aaron
could have hit that ball.

1848
01:32:56,605 --> 01:32:58,540
Yeah, well, he swung
like Hank Aaron.

1849
01:32:58,607 --> 01:33:00,843
You two guys oughta meet.
Michael!

1850
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,377
Nora!

1851
01:33:02,444 --> 01:33:05,614
Michael McPhee,
this is my son
Kevin Costello.

1852
01:33:05,681 --> 01:33:06,949
Hi.
Hi.

1853
01:33:07,015 --> 01:33:08,917
You're one
terrific pitcher.

1854
01:33:08,984 --> 01:33:10,452
Hi, Kevin.
Nora McPhee.

1855
01:33:10,518 --> 01:33:12,320
Yeah. My pop told me
where you teach.

1856
01:33:12,387 --> 01:33:14,923
Mom and I are moving
next year, and I'll be
going to your school.

1857
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:16,759
Really? What grade?
Tenth.

1858
01:33:16,825 --> 01:33:19,327
Tenth? I teach
tenth-grade English.

1859
01:33:19,394 --> 01:33:21,363
You may be in my class.

1860
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:23,899
You might be in trouble.

1861
01:33:23,966 --> 01:33:27,202
You may be teaching it
in a state institution.

1862
01:33:28,671 --> 01:33:31,807
Brazil.
He's going to Brazil.

1863
01:33:31,874 --> 01:33:34,076
Damn it.
What's wrong?

1864
01:33:34,142 --> 01:33:37,713
I no longer have any idea
whether you're lying
or telling the truth.

1865
01:33:40,515 --> 01:33:42,284
Anybody hungry
for a giant pizza?

1866
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:45,153
(Michael) For sure!
(Kevin) Totally!

1867
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:49,057
I gotta make a phone call.
No, you don't.

1868
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:52,995
It's the weekend,
and nobody works
24 hours a day.

1869
01:33:53,061 --> 01:33:55,097
You haven't had
your lunch yet.

1870
01:33:55,163 --> 01:33:58,033
And besides,
nobody important
is going to get away

1871
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,335
while you're having
a pizza.

1872
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:09,978
The Pizza Hut
on 8th Street?

1873
01:34:13,982 --> 01:34:17,720
Come on, Mike!
Let's ride in the Mercedes!

1874
01:34:19,121 --> 01:34:20,723
(laughs)

1875
01:34:24,326 --> 01:34:26,028
Where is it?

1876
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:30,733
It was here.

1877
01:34:30,799 --> 01:34:32,701
I locked that car...

1878
01:34:32,768 --> 01:34:34,870
How can you lock the car
and it's not here now?

1879
01:34:34,937 --> 01:34:37,172
(horn honking)

1880
01:34:39,742 --> 01:34:41,676
Was that...?

1881
01:34:41,744 --> 01:34:44,012
My God, he's gonna drive
to Brazil.

1882
01:34:55,891 --> 01:34:58,226
So long, Pop.
