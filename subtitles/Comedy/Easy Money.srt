1
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:42,992
Hey, take it easy!

2
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:45,495
Hey, who's the big birthday girl, huh?

3
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,498
Oh, boy. How old are youme! I'm this.

4
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:52,001
Call me when you're
this, okayhere we go.

5
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:54,387
You got it straight,
okay? Hold it there.

6
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:57,006
Beautiful, beautiful! Okay!

7
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:09,152
Hey, what happened here?
What's the matter, huh?

8
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:12,655
Johnny hit me. He don't like me anymore.

9
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,658
Oh, I know what you're goin' through.

10
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:18,161
You gave him the best three
months of your life, huh?

11
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:20,663
Then he left you for a pail and shovel.

12
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,666
What do you see in him, anyway?
What are you in love with?

13
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:29,172
He's not in your class. He's afraid
of the dark. He wets his pants.

14
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:33,176
When he eats, he gets food all
over his face. He's a mama's boy.

15
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:35,178
What are you, in nursery school now?

16
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:40,183
I guarantee you, by the time you get to
kindergarten, you'll forget all about him.

17
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:43,186
Hey, look who's here! Show
time! Bobby bunny, huh?

18
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:50,193
Here we go, let's go.
Bobby bunny's here-

19
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:53,196
what's that? Oh, nothing, nothing.

20
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:57,200
Bobby bunny just dropped
a few carrots, that's all.

21
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:11,214
You don't have to talk all night?

22
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:14,217
I'm a man who can't say no?

23
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:17,720
You don't have to twist my arm?

24
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:20,223
Just point me where you wanna go?

25
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:23,726
Take me to the action
take me to the track?

26
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:26,229
Take me to a party if
they're bettin' in the back?

27
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:30,233
I've been workin' all my
life can't afford to wait?

28
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:33,236
Let me call my wife so I
can tell her I'll be late?

29
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,239
I want the easy mmm?

30
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:39,242
Easy, easy money?

31
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:42,245
I could get lucky?

32
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,748
Oh, things could go right?

33
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,252
I want the easy?

34
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:52,255
Easy, easy money?

35
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,758
Maybe this one time?

36
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:58,761
Maybe tonight?

37
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:07,270
You don't have to try too hard?

38
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,773
I don't need a song and dance?

39
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:14,277
I don't need an invitation?

40
00:03:14,312 --> 00:03:16,279
If you've got a game of chance?

41
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:19,782
Take me to the tables
take me to the fights?

42
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:22,785
Run me like a numbers
roll me like a dice?

43
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,289
When you're countin' on a
killin' always count me in?

44
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:29,292
Talk me into losing just
as long as I can win?

45
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:32,295
I want the easy?

46
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,298
Easy, easy money?

47
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,301
I want the good times?

48
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:42,305
Oh, I never had?

49
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,807
I want the easy?

50
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:47,310
Mmm, easy money?

51
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:51,814
Oh, I want the good life?

52
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,817
Mmm, I want it bad?

53
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:57,320
Easy money?

54
00:03:57,355 --> 00:03:59,322
You say I fool myself?

55
00:03:59,357 --> 00:04:02,325
But better me than being
a fool for someone else?

56
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,830
I got a hot slot machine
of a system ready to go?

57
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:10,833
Easy money?

58
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:15,838
I got a one-track mind and a good
reputation layin' on the line?

59
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:18,341
I'll either come back a bum or a king?

60
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:21,961
Baby, I don't know?

61
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,900
Let's go over today's schedule.

62
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:21,404
It is exactly 6:33.

63
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,407
It is exactly 6:34.

64
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:29,412
At 7:00, we're meeting with the head of the
furniture department regarding inventory.

65
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:34,417
Postpone the meeting. Double-check the
inventory, and fire the cleaning staff.

66
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,919
7:20, you will crush the hopes
of the loading dock workers...

67
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,422
regarding better working conditions.

68
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:41,424
Cancel the meeting, and
send out a memorandum...

69
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,926
that the working conditions
at the loading dock...

70
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:47,930
will remain as they have for
the past 35 years. Mm-hmm.

71
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,433
At 7:30, we'll be meeting
with the accountants...

72
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:52,935
regarding donations and
charitable contributions.

73
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,440
Cancel that meeting, and
cancel my check to boy's town.

74
00:05:57,475 --> 00:05:59,442
What time is scrappleton coming?

75
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:03,946
Uh, 7:50, with the legal
papers you requested.

76
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:07,450
As soon as you finish with scrappleton,
we leave for staten island...

77
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:09,452
to attend your granddaughter
allison's wedding.

78
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:13,456
Well, I hope she's
made a better choice...

79
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,958
than her mother did!

80
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,579
Jesus! Rose!

81
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:22,582
How did you talk me into this?

82
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:26,085
You should use allison.
She's the one has to wear it.

83
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,589
It's unlucky for the bride to wear
her gown before the wedding day.

84
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:33,593
How unlucky can she getlook who she's
marrying. You shouldn't talk like that.

85
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:36,095
Julio's a good boy.
Come on, rose, will ya?

86
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,598
See the guy for what he
is. He belongs to a gang.

87
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:42,101
It's a good boy's
gang. They help people.

88
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:46,105
- Ooh, take it easy, will ya?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Where'd I get you?

89
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,609
If I show you, we'll never
get outta here. Hold still.

90
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:53,112
I've gotta finish this. You gotta pick
up the cake, and mother will be here soon.

91
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,616
Your mother.

92
00:06:56,651 --> 00:07:00,119
I gotta go to the john.
Monty! Oh, the dress!

93
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,123
No, you're wonderful.
Allison, I need the phone.

94
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,627
I'm in here. Get outta there!

95
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:10,129
Get off, will ya? I
am so hung up on you.

96
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:13,132
Good idea. I'll see you in church.

97
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:16,135
Daddy! Don't worry, you won't lose him.

98
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,638
Belinda, let's go.

99
00:07:18,673 --> 00:07:21,641
Someday I'll be out of your life.

100
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:24,143
Yeah, but right now
get outta the bathroom.

101
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,162
It's the best thing
about having daughters.

102
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:01,681
Nicky boy, it's monty.

103
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:03,683
Close the door.

104
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,185
Yeah?

105
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,688
Nicky, rose's mother,
she's on her way over.

106
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,691
So? What do you want from me?

107
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:16,195
I need the truck. I gotta pick up the
wedding cake. What am I, allied vans?

108
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,197
You really know how
to push a friendship.

109
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:22,201
When's the last time you did
something for meyou got a short memory.

110
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,204
Who drove to atlantic city to
bail you out when you owed $400?

111
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,707
At belmont, you had
four losers in a row.

112
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:31,210
Who gave you the winner in the
fifththe cake's for your godchild!

113
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,213
All right, all right. Give
me a chance. I'm comin'.

114
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:49,228
Where's my stuffby the
front door. What's the rush?

115
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:53,232
I gotta go to work. I got a wedding
to pay for. Don't forget the cake.

116
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:57,236
How many years you know me?
Did I ever forget anything?

117
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,239
Nicky, just in time. Beautiful!

118
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:04,243
I don't wanna see her fucking
- mother!

119
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:09,882
- Was it nicky?
- No, no. It's not nicky. No.

120
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:16,388
Oh, it's mother! Leave him,
dear. Simply walk out on him.

121
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:19,892
His entire body is
bloodshot. He'll never change.

122
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:22,394
Nice to see you too.

123
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:26,899
It's gonna be so much fun having
everyone here. Yeah, a lot of fun.

124
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:30,903
Well, if it isn't my favorite
relative. Don't start that bullshit.

125
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:34,907
Monty, please bring
mother's luggage upstairs.

126
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:39,411
What's clive, a footstool?
No, no, monty, let me get this.

127
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:45,417
How can you stand him?
You gotta get to know him.

128
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,419
The wedding is gonna be wonderful.

129
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:51,924
We never get to see you. The
store takes up all my time.

130
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,430
Mother, why do you push yourself
so hardthe money doesn't matter.

131
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:02,935
When your father was alive,
he ran monahan's like a tyrant.

132
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,937
He paid the help next to nothing.

133
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,940
- He drove them like sled dogs.
- Wonderful man.

134
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:11,944
Wonderful! Now that he's
gone, I carry on his work.

135
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:13,946
Rose,

136
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:18,951
I don't know how you can
live with that... man.

137
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,453
We're happy just the way we are.

138
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:25,457
Happyyeah, we were
until a few minutes ago.

139
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,460
And we don't want a dime
from you. You understand?

140
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,963
No offense.

141
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:33,966
No offense?

142
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:34,967
No offense?

143
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,970
You are an offense!

144
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,973
Why, you can barely walk erect.

145
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:44,977
You pollute the air with your smoking.

146
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,480
You reek of liquor and god knows what
else. You're an ecological menace!

147
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,984
You were the inspiration for twin
beds. I'll tell you something else.

148
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:55,988
Don't start with mother. I'm not
startin' nothin'. It never ended.

149
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:59,992
And to think of who you could
have married. Pat flannigan.

150
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:03,495
Don't start throwing up the
guys she could've married.

151
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,499
I'm outta here. He started as a
bricklayer. Now he owns his own company.

152
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:10,502
And tom o'rourke. He
started as a busboy.

153
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,504
Today he has his own restaurant.

154
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:17,009
I started out as a baby.
Today I'm a baby photographer.

155
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:21,881
I'll see you later. And I'm sure you're
gonna talk about me when I'm gone.

156
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:36,145
Where do you live, in
vermontwhat took you so long?

157
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,792
Why do you let her mother get to you?

158
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:52,795
Forget about her, will ya?

159
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,798
She never wanted rose
to marry me. Never.

160
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,804
She says I drink too much,
I smoke too much, I gamble.

161
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,307
She's right, but what am I
gonna doi can't control myself.

162
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:09,311
I got no- what's the
wordi got no- class.

163
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,314
Nah, we know I got class.

164
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:16,318
It's a certain word. What's the
word for someone who can't say "no"?

165
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:18,821
Sonya. Not sonya. No, not sonya.

166
00:12:18,856 --> 00:12:21,323
I got no-

167
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,828
willpower! That's the word I'm
lookin' for. I got no willpower.

168
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:28,330
Yeah, willpower.

169
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,332
Make a left on elm. I got a quick shoot.

170
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,334
You didn't say anything about a shoot.

171
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:34,837
Leave me alone. I got enough
problems. Just take a left on elm.

172
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:38,841
I got a quick shoot. I'll be quick.
You can help me. Well, thanks.

173
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,460
You really think I got no class?

174
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,462
No, I don't think you gotnoclass.

175
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,349
I'm gonna be sad. Mmmmm. Very good!

176
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,352
Now, I'm gonna be a
monster. Watch this. Grrrrr.

177
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:52,354
Now the big one.

178
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,357
Okay, the big one. Can you be happy?

179
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:58,360
That's a good one! Okay, be happy.

180
00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:00,863
Okay, here goes. Smile pretty.

181
00:13:00,898 --> 00:13:03,115
Beautiful! We got it.

182
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:14,743
The other door. The
other door! I got it.

183
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:26,755
Get outta here.

184
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,258
Oooh! Oh!

185
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:37,266
The cake, the cake!

186
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,775
Watch out for the top.
I'm watching, I'm watching.

187
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,780
It's not gonna slide around in there?
No, I got it wedged against a toilet.

188
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,422
Just great. My favorite system a lock.

189
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:02,925
And I got monty in the
truck with a wedding cake.

190
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,927
I gotta pick up my mother,
take her to the beauty parlor.

191
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,430
What's the tip? Big boy in the fifth.

192
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,934
Forget it! The fifth goes off at 3:00.

193
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:15,938
- We goin' to the track?
- I can't go. I got a bar to run.

194
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:17,439
This here's a sure thing.

195
00:14:17,474 --> 00:14:20,442
It's forty to one. Hey!

196
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:23,445
Wake up, we're closing up.
I didn't finish my drink.

197
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,316
You're finished now. Get
outta here. Here's your dollar.

198
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:34,823
Come on, we've got five minutes to post.

199
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,332
Hey! Get the hell out of there!

200
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:45,834
Slow down. They're kids.

201
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:50,339
Nicky, take care of it.

202
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:57,846
What're you doing?

203
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:04,353
Sixty seconds to post time.

204
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,106
You're next. What?

205
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,607
Are you gonna place a bet?

206
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:13,612
Oh, yes, yes. I'd like the
number... seven horse please.

207
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:16,115
Thirty seconds to post time.

208
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:21,620
I'd like to put two dollars
to win, two dollars to place...

209
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:25,624
and two dollars to show.
Okay, buddy, good luck.

210
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:30,129
The next time you bet,
remember, instead of saying...

211
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:32,084
fifteen seconds to post
time. Two dollars to

212
00:15:32,085 --> 00:15:34,133
win, two dollars to
place, two dollars to show,

213
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:36,135
just say, "two across the board."

214
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,639
Gee, instead
- what are you buyin', a house?

215
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,142
Let's go while we're young.

216
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:45,144
We're gonna get shut out!

217
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:47,588
I have a friend that wants to bet the

218
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,649
number seven horse. Two
seconds to post time.

219
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:53,652
Number six horse. Six horse.

220
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:57,289
No more bets.

221
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,292
And they're off!

222
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:07,166
Here they go! Nicky, come
on. We're goin' to the rail.

223
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,669
Big boy making up lots
of ground on the outside,

224
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,672
moving to the fourth spot.

225
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,175
Here comes big boy on
the extreme outside.

226
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,560
How's he doin'?

227
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:22,064
Gettin' farther ahead all
the time. Gimme those things.

228
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:25,067
Five lengths ahead!

229
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,569
Fifty bucks at forty to one!

230
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:30,072
That's two grand apiece! Two grand!

231
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,578
You dragged me out here!
I love ya, I love ya!

232
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,208
That's two grand apiece!

233
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,714
I'm goin' to hawaii! I'm goin'
to hawaii! He's fallin' back.

234
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,717
I'm not goin' to hawaii!

235
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,221
He's too far ahead to lose.

236
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,232
He thinks he's water skiing!

237
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,370
We were in. What happened?
Yeah, there's our winner.

238
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,873
I closed my bar! Get outta here!

239
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,876
I'll kill you.

240
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,379
I'll kill you, bosco!

241
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:30,382
I'll kill him. I'll kill you!

242
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:33,885
There was supposed to be
- crooks!

243
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,256
I was gonna buy a new neon sign.

244
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,762
Yeah, that's it. Step on his face!

245
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:46,765
That son of a bitch!

246
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,659
Go get him, nicky!

247
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,779
My bridesmaids' dresses are lime green.

248
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:04,283
And my maid of honor
is wearing lime green.

249
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:08,036
The maid of honor's dress should always
be in contrast to the bridesmaids.

250
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:13,542
This is, um, delicious!
What do you call itchicken.

251
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:17,546
I know it's chicken, dear, but
what kindthere's kiev, florentine-

252
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:20,048
shake & bake!

253
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,050
Mother, I'm glad you could come.

254
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:25,053
I've always been sorry
you missed my wedding.

255
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:28,056
You know I couldn't go to your
wedding. That's 'cause daddy was there.

256
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:31,560
Where is your father tonight,
deartaking baby pictures.

257
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:36,565
Ha! What kind of a baby is it
that's still up at 9:00 at night?

258
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:51,079
Sweetheart, watch out for this guy.

259
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,082
He'll buy you a bottle of beer, and
then squeeze the "schlitz" outta ya.

260
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:58,587
He's my friend. Don't worry about him.

261
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:02,591
Excuse me, miss. I don't mean to
interrupt while you're working.

262
00:19:02,626 --> 00:19:07,095
I was wondering if you could come
over to the house sunday for dinner...

263
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:09,598
and meet my mother?

264
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:12,100
You gettin' tiredwanna go
homehe's kiddin' around.

265
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:15,604
Excuse me, pal. You got a
problem herethis is my friend.

266
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:18,106
Who are you? Who am I?

267
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:20,609
I'm the guy that put the bathrooms
in this joint. That's who I am.

268
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:24,863
Now I know why the
place stinks, okay, pal?

269
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,367
Break it up, will ya? What's the matter?

270
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,871
Take it easy, will ya?

271
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:37,125
Ma? Hmm?

272
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,628
Am I pretty?

273
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:42,130
Oh, you're beautiful, sweetheart!

274
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:44,633
Julio's a very lucky boy.

275
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:48,136
I wanna make him happy.

276
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:50,138
But there's so much I don't know.

277
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:53,642
Like what? Like about, you know.

278
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:56,645
I know what? You know!

279
00:19:58,146 --> 00:20:00,148
Oh, that!

280
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:02,651
Didn't your father tell you
everything you need to know?

281
00:20:02,686 --> 00:20:06,154
He keeps starting,
but he never finishes.

282
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:08,156
What do you wanna know?

283
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:12,661
Foreplay. Have you
ever heard of foreplay?

284
00:20:12,696 --> 00:20:16,164
No, not with your father.

285
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:19,167
It's nice we can have
these little talks.

286
00:20:19,202 --> 00:20:21,670
Let's go help belinda
pour the coffee. Wait, mom.

287
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:23,672
How did you know you really loved daddy?

288
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:27,676
We were at coney island
on the ferris wheel.

289
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:30,178
We got caught at the top.

290
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:32,180
Later on, I found out...

291
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:36,184
he paid the man a
dollar to stop the ride.

292
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:38,687
Your father said things to me...

293
00:20:38,722 --> 00:20:42,691
that were so sweet, so romantic.

294
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:47,696
I said to myself,
"here's a sensitive man."

295
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,449
Once, a fuckin' four!

296
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:53,452
Four! Got a four!

297
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:55,454
Gimme the dice, I'm hot. Gimme the dice.

298
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:58,457
Hold it, hold it! You
won, rightright, yeah.

299
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:02,461
We're ahead. We can leave
winners right now. Okay, so we go.

300
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:05,464
Let's go. Double or nothin'. Here we go.

301
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:08,467
Oh, monty!

302
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,989
You did it again, huh?

303
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,994
We were winners. We
could've walked away.

304
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:39,498
That's how I am. Once I
get goin', I can't stop.

305
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:52,511
Come on. Forget about it.
It's history. Let's go.

306
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:01,520
Good stuff. It oughta
be. I got it off a cop.

307
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:06,525
I'm starvin'. Let's go to
lucky's. He's open late.

308
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:24,543
He's closed. Come on, pop's
inside. He'll let us in.

309
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,058
Pop's last dish.

310
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:43,562
We're drivin' a half hour. The closest
we came to food, we almost hit a deer.

311
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:45,564
Here's a place.

312
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:02,080
I'm so hungry, I could eat a waitress.

313
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:20,599
No, no! No! It's wrong.
Nicky, it's wrong. I wanna see-

314
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:22,601
it's wrong!

315
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:27,105
It's wedding cake flavor.
I love wedding cake.

316
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,608
Why don't you get married?

317
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,113
Let me just lick the bride.

318
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:37,115
That's my daughter!

319
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:42,120
It's a little plastic thing.
It's not your daughter.

320
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:47,125
Only one little flower each.

321
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,128
There's a lot of flowers.
Nobody will know the difference.

322
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:52,631
Forget about it. Let's get outta here.

323
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,133
And don't drive fast. You're drunk.

324
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,136
Don't worry about it. I
drive better when I'm drunk.

325
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,644
You got a weird sense
of humor. You know that?

326
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,648
You laugh at everything.
Weather reports, car chase.

327
00:24:09,683 --> 00:24:12,150
Keep it straight. You're
swerving all over the place.

328
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:14,653
I'm goin' straight. I'm on
the yellow line, I told ya.

329
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:19,658
Move over to one side. You're
on the other side! Get over here!

330
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:21,910
Keep to the right! Get
your hands off the wheel!

331
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:25,296
Look out!

332
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,303
My head! I hit my head!

333
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,306
What's so funnyeverything's
funny to you. You laugh and laugh.

334
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,809
Watch the road, will ya?
Will you watch the road?

335
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:42,814
I lost my joint. Where's my joint?

336
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:47,318
Just watch the road.

337
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:13,962
You got some aspirin?

338
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:33,481
Oh, no!

339
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:37,986
I'm sorry. It was an emergency.

340
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:09,150
Are you sure this is a good ideadaddy.

341
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:11,653
Isn't she beautiful?

342
00:26:11,688 --> 00:26:14,656
Yeah, but who's that with her?

343
00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:20,528
What do you see in this guy?

344
00:26:20,563 --> 00:26:25,033
He has everything I ever wanted.
You don't ask for much, do ya?

345
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:28,536
Did your mother tell you
everything you need to know?

346
00:26:28,571 --> 00:26:31,039
She taught me how to fry
bananas. Oh, beautiful.

347
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:34,542
You'll end up working
in a spanish restaurant.

348
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,303
You're not pregnant, are you?

349
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:48,306
Daddy! The way you brought me up?

350
00:26:48,341 --> 00:26:50,809
All right.

351
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,209

00:27:41,492 --> 00:27:45,496
Where's your father?
He's directing traffic.

Why didn't he fix the walk?
It's been this way for months!

369
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:11,699
Why can't you make everybody happy
and shake hands with this kid?

370
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:13,701
Not me. Shake hands with him.

371
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:16,704
Go ahead.

372
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:21,709
Look at him. If I look at
him, I won't shake hands!

373
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,963
Look at him. Go ahead.

374
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,967
Look, julio. We're
family now, all right?

375
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:31,970
Just do the right thing.
Make allison happy.

376
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:37,475
She's a great girl. I know,
I lived with her for 18 years.

377
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,979
Can I call you... dad?

378
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,985
Oh, it's wonderful to
see you two get along.

379
00:29:55,243 --> 00:29:57,378
Good-bye, honey!

00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:12,393

Wow.

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,917
This is it.

383
00:30:35,952 --> 00:30:40,421
Yeah, our first motel room.

384
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,455
Okay, let's get the guy up
here who paid for this shindig.

385
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,969
Hold it, hold it. Let him talk.

386
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,472
I got nothin' to say.
Then sing a song. I sang.

387
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:34,475
I can't sing. Are you
kiddin'sing "la consonetta."

388
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,980
I'm no sinatra, but here it goes. Okay?

389
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,991
Some think the world was
made for fun and frolic?

390
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,494
And so do I and so do I?

391
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,999
Some think it's right
to be so melancholic?

392
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,502
They'll pine and sigh
they'll pine and sigh?

393
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:06,124
But I I like to spend
my time a-singing?

394
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,627
Some joyous song some joyous song?

395
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:14,132
To set the air with music ever ringing?

396
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:18,136
Is far from wrong is far from wrong?

397
00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:21,639
Hark it, hark it music from afar?

398
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,642
Hark it, hark it with a happy heart?

399
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:29,647
Funiculi, funicula funiculi, funicula?

400
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:32,650
Joy is everywhere funiculi, funicula?

401
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:36,654
Hark it, hark it music from afar?

402
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,657
Hark it, hark it with a happy heart?

403
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:45,163
Funiculi, funicula funiculi, funicula?

404
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:48,166
Joy is everywhere funiculi, funicula?

405
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:52,170
Hark it, hark it music from afar?

406
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:55,173
Hark it, hark it with a happy heart?

407
00:32:55,673 --> 00:33:00,178
Funiculi, funicula funiculi, funicula?

408
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:07,185
Joy is everywhere funiculi, funicula?

409
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:07,745
How do I look?

410
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,750
You look beautiful.

411
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:39,277
I always dreamed about my wedding day.

412
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:41,779
I guess I never thought about the night.

413
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,306
Be gentle with me.

414
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,818
Julio!

415
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:23,321
This is foreplay.

416
00:35:23,356 --> 00:35:27,825
I have a headache. I don't
wanna touch your head.

417
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,828
Please, julio, I've never
been with a man before.

418
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:32,830
Neither have I!

419
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:35,333
Julio!

420
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:43,341
What's wrong with you?
I don't know what to do.

421
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:47,845
I brought a book. A book?

422
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,353
El joyo de sexo.

423
00:35:55,388 --> 00:35:58,356
It's in spanish. I'm
gonna translate it for you.

424
00:35:58,391 --> 00:36:01,859
It has a very happy ending.
You're gonna love it.

425
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,371
Allison?

426
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,874
What do you want from me, julio?

427
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:20,878
I never seen anything like that.

428
00:36:20,913 --> 00:36:23,381
Try to understand.

429
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:26,384
I keep hearing my father say, "don't."

430
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:29,887
He meant before you were married.

431
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,894
I'm not so sure. You
don't know my father.

432
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,400
Allison,

433
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,904
listen to me.

434
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:53,411
My cousin once knew a guy,

435
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:57,415
and the guy went out with a virgin...

436
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,918
for six months.

437
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:05,923
And on their wedding night,
when they got married,

438
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:10,428
and they wanted to
consummate the marriage,

439
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,931
the woman wouldn't let him.

440
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:18,936
And in the morning,

441
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:21,939
they found the guy dead...

442
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,943
in the bed next to her.

443
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:33,451
Oh. Allison?

444
00:37:33,486 --> 00:37:36,954
I don't wanna die.

445
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:43,461
You're my wife. Yeah.

446
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:46,964
I love you. Yeah.

447
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,968
We're all alone.

448
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:53,471
And your father,

449
00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:55,973
he is a million miles away.

450
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,982
Hello?

451
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:10,488
Julio, I just wanna say
good night to my little baby.

452
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:12,490
My father!

453
00:38:16,529 --> 00:38:20,498
You hung up on my fatheri
wouldn't hang up on your father.

454
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:22,500
You wouldn't understand my father.

455
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,504
Yeahwell, I'm not so sure
I understand you either.

456
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:30,508
Then why don't you go spend your
wedding night with your father?

457
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,013
Okay... I will!

458
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:50,160
Monty, don't forget
to fix the walk. Yeah.

459
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,045
Watch it, watch it!
Watch where you're goin'!

460
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:12,550
My air mail!

461
00:39:12,585 --> 00:39:14,552
Oh, my air mail!

462
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:28,315
Listen to me. I want my wife back.

463
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,068
Look who's here. Don juan.

464
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:34,572
It's your fault she left
me. What, am I responsible?

465
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:38,576
When eddie fisher broke up with debbie,
you blame meshe don't wanna see ya.

466
00:39:38,611 --> 00:39:43,581
You gotta help me, man. Give her time.
She'll come back when she's ready.

467
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,217
You oughta give her a few drinks.

468
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:49,837
That's how I got her mother ready.

469
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,596
I'm in.

470
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:02,099
It's up to you, paddy. Yeah.

471
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:06,604
What the hell is that you
got onthis used to be a shirt.

472
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,107
You know rose. She don't throw nothin'
out. She keeps lookin' at the cuffs.

473
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:12,610
Soon as they get frayed, it
becomes a short-sleeve shirt.

474
00:40:12,645 --> 00:40:15,112
When the collar goes, I
end up with a pajama top.

475
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:18,115
Right now I got 23
short-sleeve pajama tops.

476
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,619
You know what I found in the
closeta hundred 1978 calendars.

477
00:40:21,654 --> 00:40:23,621
That's rose!

478
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:28,626
If 1978 ever comes back, we're in great
shape. We gonna talk or play cards?

479
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:33,380
He'll talk.

480
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:40,137
Nicky, take it easy.

481
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:43,140
Take it easy. He didn't mean it.

482
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:49,647
Monty, the phone.

483
00:40:49,682 --> 00:40:51,649
Hellohello?

484
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,152
Monty, you have to pick it up.

485
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,664
You got the wrong number.
There's nobody home. We're asleep.

486
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:09,166
Mr. Capuletti?

487
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:14,171
Are you there? Monty, who is it?

488
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:26,433
Hellohello! Anyone there?

489
00:41:26,468 --> 00:41:28,936
Ah, ah.

490
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:34,441
Who know a scrappleton?

491
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:37,444
That's mother's lawyer.

492
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:45,452
Yeah. Yeah?

493
00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:48,455
That's awful!

494
00:41:48,956 --> 00:41:52,960
No, no. I'm sorry. I'll tell her.

495
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:54,962
I'll tell her. I'm sorry.

496
00:41:55,963 --> 00:41:58,966
Monty, what happened?

497
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:05,472
Rose, you better sit down for this.

498
00:42:09,476 --> 00:42:12,980
Is it... mother?

499
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,484
Rose, there was a plane crash.

500
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,488
Your mother... earned her wings.

501
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:26,994
It's all right. It's all right, baby.

502
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:30,130
"And to my nephew clive,

503
00:42:30,165 --> 00:42:32,633
"son of my beloved departed brother,

504
00:42:32,668 --> 00:42:36,136
"whom I've undertaken to
raise as a son of my own,

505
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:40,140
"inasmuch as he has always
led a simple, virtuous life,

506
00:42:40,175 --> 00:42:43,644
"and because it is my wish
that he continue to do so,

507
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,649
"I bequeath to him an additional
income of $5,000 a year...

508
00:42:48,684 --> 00:42:50,651
for the rest of his life."

509
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,154
Ah... there must be some mistake.

510
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,158
There must be some more zeroes. No.

511
00:42:58,193 --> 00:43:00,160
Um, a comma?

512
00:43:00,195 --> 00:43:02,162
No.

513
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,665
"To my beloved daughter, rose,

514
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,919
"burdened as she is with
cares and responsibilities,

515
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:11,922
"I bequeath the remainder of my estate,

516
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:14,424
"which includes monahan's
department store,

517
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,427
estimated worth, $10 million."

518
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:19,429
Oh!

519
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:22,432
"If, and only if, her husband monty...

520
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:24,434
can reform himself in one year."

521
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:26,436
What kind of reform?

522
00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:30,941
There is a codicil attached
to the will, mr. "capalooti."

523
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:33,443
That's capuletti. Mr. Capuletti.

524
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:37,948
Which lists the activities
which are to be proscribed:

525
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:42,953
That is, the things
you must refrain from.

526
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,963
No smoking. No philandering.

527
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:55,966
No gambling. No drugs. No alcohol.

528
00:43:56,466 --> 00:44:00,470
No alcoholdoes that go
for beer toocertainly.

529
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:05,475
And you must weigh not more
than 175 pounds. Question.

530
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,980
Assuming monty can't reform
- perish the thought.

531
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:12,983
Oh, then you get the money.

532
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:14,985
I do?

533
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:30,500
- Forget about it. I'm not doin' it.
- You're right, forget it.

534
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:35,505
Daddy, you can do it! It's $10 million!

535
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:39,009
Oh, and mr. "capalooti,"

536
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:42,012
should you decide to accept these terms,

537
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:45,515
remember... we'll be watching you.

538
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:52,022
I need a drink and a cigarette
so I can think this over.

539
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,393
Twelve months? Forget about it.

540
00:44:56,428 --> 00:45:00,397
You can do that standing on
your head. It's easy money.

541
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:02,649
Hey, that's a lot of money.

542
00:45:02,684 --> 00:45:05,152
That could parlay
into a fortune for you.

543
00:45:05,187 --> 00:45:09,656
I couldn't care less,
monty, but think of the kids.

544
00:45:10,157 --> 00:45:13,660
- Think about mommy.
- Think of your wife, and your kids.

545
00:45:17,164 --> 00:45:19,666
Think of me, ya bum!

546
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,850
Monty, breakfast is ready.

547
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,353
Oh, breakfast. Beautiful.

548
00:46:13,388 --> 00:46:15,856
I stopped smoking. I'm starvin'.

549
00:46:15,891 --> 00:46:17,858
Dad, pass the syrup. Here, here.

550
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,364
You gave me the wrong plate. Where's
the rest of my eggs and my home fries?

551
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:28,869
These are the rest of your
eggs, these are your home fries,

552
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:31,872
and this is applesauce.

553
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:40,380
Belinda, I can't eat all my
home fries. Want some home fries?

554
00:46:40,415 --> 00:46:42,382
No, thanks.

555
00:46:42,417 --> 00:46:45,385
Here, monty. Oohhh,
pass them to belinda.

556
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,889
If you wanna lose weight,
you should start now.

557
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,894
Ooh, food.

558
00:46:53,929 --> 00:46:56,897
It's a tough give-up. Allison, eat.

559
00:46:56,932 --> 00:46:59,900
Allison, you gotta eat.

560
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,902
I know marriage is rough.

561
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,405
It's not all moonlight and
canoes. That's in the movies.

562
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,408
I don't wanna talk about it.
What's the matter with you?

563
00:47:08,443 --> 00:47:11,912
You don't eat. You don't talk to no one.

564
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,915
You lock yourself in
your room all night.

565
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,917
The way you're carrying on,
you'll never meet another guy.

566
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,676
What'd I say?

567
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:28,678
"You'll never meet another guy."

568
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:31,181
Take out the garbage.

569
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,434
Take out the garbage.

570
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:38,438
I didn't even eat, I
gotta take out the garbage.

571
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,943
Hi.

572
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,457
She ain't worth $10 million.

573
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,580
$5 million, maybe.

574
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,772
Hey, not here! Not here!

575
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:06,276
I'm your new neighbor, bill
jones. Call me bill. Not here!

576
00:49:06,776 --> 00:49:10,780
- Take him on your property. - You interrupt
king's business, he gets very upset.

577
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,783
What makes you think I
wanna inherit his business?

578
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:15,785
If you feel so bad, I'll clean it up.

579
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,789
So you're monty capuletti!
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding.

580
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:23,793
Some party, I heard. What am I
telling you foryou were there.

581
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,797
Look, I'm your neighbor, so we
gotta get to be good buddies.

582
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:30,800
I wanna have a relationship. Most important
thing for us, we gotta have a good rapport.

583
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,303
Wait till you meet ginger.
She's my better half.

584
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:36,806
I already saw your better half.
In fact, I saw more than half.

585
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:39,809
She's a dynamite girl. I met her
in vegas a couple of years ago.

586
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:44,314
Oh, man, she's a loving, caring, sharing
person. Maybe you can become friendly.

587
00:49:44,814 --> 00:49:48,318
I need you two to move in. I'm nervous
enough this morning. Are you kiddin'?

588
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:52,322
Nervousmaybe you need a little... smoke.

589
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:55,325
Little ups, little downs, little
somethingi got anything you need.

590
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,828
What are you talkin' to me about drugs
fori got my daughter here. She's 12.

591
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:01,831
Look, you got a connection in
the family already, stick with it.

592
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:04,834
But just this once, I'll tell you
what, my friend. Let me be santa claus.

593
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,838
There's one, two, from me to
you. We'll take a hike. Come on.

594
00:50:28,463 --> 00:50:31,083
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

595
00:50:33,468 --> 00:50:37,339
Two, four, six, eight, ten.
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

596
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,985
This is ridiculous.

597
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,487
But jogging's good for you.

598
00:50:52,522 --> 00:50:56,992
Thanks to jogging, more people than
ever are dropping dead in perfect health.

599
00:51:07,502 --> 00:51:11,006
Five more.

600
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:18,013
Celebrity pizza. Send

602
00:51:22,052 --> 00:51:24,019

603
00:51:24,054 --> 00:51:27,022

Stay right there. I'll get some money.

605
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:41,036
What am I askingfor one slice.
You can stay up late, all right?

606
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,542
The top one had anchovies.

607
00:51:52,047 --> 00:51:54,549
All right, who's in?

608
00:51:56,051 --> 00:51:59,054
Come on, pick the date he blows it.

609

Great guy you are, you know that?

00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,568
Can't wait till he blows it,

611
00:52:13,603 --> 00:52:16,071
Listen to you. You

612
00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:20,826
Huhyou're some influence. You gamble in
front of him, you drink in front of him.

613
00:52:21,193 --> 00:52:23,445
Monty see, monty do, you know.

614

Hector, hector. Don't push me.

615
00:52:33,623 --> 00:52:36,591
Listen to me. It's gonna work.

616
00:52:36,626 --> 00:52:38,593
See these pennies?

617
00:52:38,628 --> 00:52:43,098
You take these pennies, you throw 'em
at the window. I'll be in the bush.

618
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:45,600
I saw it in a movie.
It's gonna work perfect.

619
00:52:45,635 --> 00:52:48,603
If you need help, listen to
what I'm gonna tell you to say.

620
00:52:49,104 --> 00:52:51,606
Go get 'em.

621
00:52:51,641 --> 00:52:55,110
Where you goingi'll be in the bush.

622
00:52:55,145 --> 00:52:57,112
Throw the pennies.

623
00:52:57,147 --> 00:53:00,115
You're gonna be behind
the bushi'll be right here.

624
00:53:12,627 --> 00:53:15,130
Who's there?

625
00:53:19,134 --> 00:53:22,137
Hey. How are you?

626
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:27,142
I was just, uh-

627
00:53:27,177 --> 00:53:29,144
I was in the neighborhood,

628
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:33,148
and thought I'd stop
by, see what's cooking.

629
00:53:33,183 --> 00:53:36,651
That julio? Yeah.

630
00:53:38,653 --> 00:53:42,157
What do I say? Tell her to come down.

631
00:53:42,192 --> 00:53:46,161
Prove to her you're the man.

632
00:53:46,661 --> 00:53:48,780
Come down. I'm the man.

633
00:53:48,815 --> 00:53:52,167
Get tough. Tell her you're bad.

634
00:53:52,202 --> 00:53:54,035
I'm bad. Like you mean it.

635
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:58,173
Allison! I'm bad.

636
00:53:58,673 --> 00:54:01,176
No, no, no!

637
00:54:01,211 --> 00:54:03,678
Jump up and down.

638
00:54:03,713 --> 00:54:07,299
I am so bad! I am so bad! Be angry.

639
00:54:07,334 --> 00:54:11,186
Who are you talking to?
Julio... and a hedge.

640
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:14,189
I'm so bad, I should be in detention.

641
00:54:14,224 --> 00:54:16,691
No. Be mean.

642
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:19,194
Wave your arms. Make
believe you're angry.

643
00:54:19,229 --> 00:54:21,696
Listen to me.

644
00:54:21,731 --> 00:54:24,199
I'm not that kind of guy...

645
00:54:24,234 --> 00:54:27,202
that's gonna start playing around
in the driveway of a tract house!

646
00:54:27,237 --> 00:54:31,206
I'm not gonna lose my temper
in front of the woman I love!

647
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:36,711
Get on your knees. Beg her.

648
00:54:36,746 --> 00:54:39,714
Tell her you're thinking
of killing yourself.

649
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:46,221
No. I don't talk like that.

650
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:51,226
Do you hear me? I don't talk like that.

651
00:54:51,261 --> 00:54:56,231
If you know so much about
women, you talk to her.

652
00:54:56,266 --> 00:54:58,733
The hedge, allison capuletti.

653
00:54:58,768 --> 00:55:02,737
Allison, the hedge has a
few words to say to you.

654
00:55:02,772 --> 00:55:06,741
I don't know what to say. Oh,
now you don't know what to say!

655
00:55:06,776 --> 00:55:10,745
Allison, julio's very unhappy.

656
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,748
You made a fool out of me! Get
off of my ear! Let go of my leg!

657
00:55:20,622 --> 00:55:23,758
Saturday lunch. I can have
a piece of fruit, citrus,

658
00:55:23,793 --> 00:55:25,760
or four ounces of fish.

659
00:55:25,795 --> 00:55:27,762
I think I'll have the fruit.

660
00:55:27,797 --> 00:55:31,266
Sometimes with the fish, these
guys go over. What'll you have?

661
00:55:31,301 --> 00:55:34,769
Two with sauerkraut
and a yoo-hoo. Got it.

662
00:55:34,804 --> 00:55:39,274
Two with sauerkraut. Yoo-hoo.

663
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:42,777
What do you want, buddy?
Nothin'. I'll just smell his.

664
00:55:50,285 --> 00:55:54,289
You know why I'm going through this
whole thingfor my kids, that's why.

665
00:55:54,324 --> 00:55:57,292
That's the greatest love in the
world, your kids. You can't beat it.

666
00:55:57,327 --> 00:56:00,795
That's why you do things.
That's love, for your kids.

667
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:03,298
See that man over there with his kid?

668
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:07,302
That's love. Look at the way he loves
the kid, bouncing him on his knee.

669
00:56:07,337 --> 00:56:11,806
That's love, baby. There he is!
Thank goodness he's all right!

670
00:56:11,841 --> 00:56:15,310
I'm sitting here minding my
business, he jumped on my lap.

671
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,312
Get away from my kid!
Everybody calm down.

672
00:56:17,812 --> 00:56:19,814
Do you have some identification?
It's in my other raincoat.

673
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:25,337
Never wander away from mommy
again. Spit that out right now!

674
00:56:31,326 --> 00:56:33,578
Come on.

675
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:40,835
It's all ready. Come on, give it a shot.

676
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,343
You gotta go 30 miles an hour...

677
00:56:48,593 --> 00:56:51,212
for 15 minutes for it to do anything.

678
00:56:51,247 --> 00:56:55,216
Faster, faster. Come on.

679
00:56:55,251 --> 00:56:57,352
Faster. You gotta get it up to speed.

680
00:56:57,852 --> 00:57:00,355
Faster, faster, faster!

681
00:57:02,223 --> 00:57:04,859
Faster. 30 miles. Faster. Faster.

682
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:11,232
Oh, my
- oh, no! Oh.

683
00:57:16,788 --> 00:57:19,374
Come on. Keep quiet.
Keep your head down.

684
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:21,876
Is my hair too flat? No.

685
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:24,879
You look great. Come on.

686
00:57:24,914 --> 00:57:28,883
Come on. Okay. Gimme that.

687
00:57:28,918 --> 00:57:32,754
It's locked. Let's go
play space invaders.

688
00:57:33,004 --> 00:57:35,390
No. We'll go up the drain pipe.

689
00:57:35,425 --> 00:57:38,393
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be all right.

690
00:57:38,428 --> 00:57:41,896
All you gotta do is climb up.

691
00:57:42,397 --> 00:57:44,399
Come on. Come on.

692
00:57:44,434 --> 00:57:46,401
You can do it! You bad!

693
00:57:48,903 --> 00:57:53,408
I had to hook up with the only virgin
in new york. Didn't they teach this...

694
00:57:53,443 --> 00:57:57,912
at schoolthey taught math at
your school, but you can't divide.

695
00:57:57,947 --> 00:58:00,915
At least I can multiply.

696
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:03,918
You sure this is allison's bedroom?

697
00:58:03,953 --> 00:58:07,422
I know this place like
the back of my hand.

698
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:21,936
What happenedi got the back
of my hand stuck in the toilet.

699
00:58:30,061 --> 00:58:33,565
Listen to me. You gotta be quiet.

700
00:58:34,065 --> 00:58:36,568
We gotta be quiet.

701
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:41,573
Where's the light? Shh!

702
00:58:42,574 --> 00:58:45,076
That isn't a light.

703
00:58:45,111 --> 00:58:48,580
That's not the light.
And this is not the light.

704
00:58:48,615 --> 00:58:53,084
That's the water pik.

705
00:58:59,474 --> 00:59:01,976
Here's the plan.

706
00:59:02,011 --> 00:59:04,479
I'm gonna go talk to allison.

707
00:59:04,514 --> 00:59:07,982
When I leave the room, you-

708
00:59:10,985 --> 00:59:12,987
we're in here.

709
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,002
Just be calm.

710
00:59:28,503 --> 00:59:31,506
Just be calm, and get out the window.

711
00:59:38,513 --> 00:59:40,515
Ow!

712
00:59:42,016 --> 00:59:44,018
I'll meet you down by the car. Yeah.

713
00:59:44,053 --> 00:59:47,522
I'll be all right. Don't worry about it.

714
00:59:50,892 --> 00:59:52,527
Julio!

715
00:59:52,562 --> 00:59:55,029
Julio!

716
01:00:16,301 --> 01:00:19,304
I'll have a number three
with flour tortillas.

717
01:00:19,339 --> 01:00:21,806
Mmm. Two of them.

718
01:00:24,809 --> 01:00:28,813
Um, I'll have the special. Number one.

719
01:00:31,816 --> 01:00:36,321
I'll have a junior salad. No dressing.

720
01:00:39,824 --> 01:00:41,826
Why don't you stop carryin' on?

721
01:00:41,861 --> 01:00:45,830
Rate you're goin', I'll bet you a
hundred bucks you're not gonna make it.

722
01:00:45,865 --> 01:00:50,335
If I bet you, then I won't make it.

723
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:54,339
When the going gets
tough, the tough get going.

724
01:00:54,374 --> 01:00:56,841
What if you're not tough?

725
01:00:56,876 --> 01:00:58,843
You gotta be strong like me.

726
01:00:58,878 --> 01:01:00,845
Look. What is this? Nothin'.

727
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,849
Put it right out. It's
not gonna be my master.

728
01:01:07,352 --> 01:01:09,354
Gimme a light, lou.

729
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:17,362
Mm, monty, gotta have "discilton."

730
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:19,864
Discipline.

731
01:01:21,866 --> 01:01:25,870
Can I have your olive?
You got extra olives?

732
01:01:25,905 --> 01:01:28,373
You want the black one or the green one?

733
01:01:28,408 --> 01:01:31,876
Which one you wantit's up
to you. Take the green one.

734
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:40,385
Just a minute. Okayyou
gotta stay still. Okay, kid?

735
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:43,388
You gotta stay still.
Kid, you gotta stay still.

736
01:01:43,423 --> 01:01:45,390
Have you ever seen a
face like that before?

737
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:47,892
No. If I did, I'd remember it.

738
01:01:47,927 --> 01:01:51,646
Okay, I'm gonna get a real
good picture now. Okay?

739
01:01:51,681 --> 01:01:56,017
- Look at him! He's got my eyes.
- He's got my nose.

740
01:01:56,052 --> 01:01:59,020
And my sympathy. All right.

741
01:01:59,055 --> 01:02:01,022
We want some wallet-size pictures too.

742
01:02:01,272 --> 01:02:04,275
This kid won't fit in a wallet-size.

743
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:06,778
Make good pictures. My
wife's very particular.

744
01:02:06,813 --> 01:02:10,782
What about you, john?
He's very particular too.

745
01:02:10,817 --> 01:02:13,284
I'm surprised you married each other.

746
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:15,787
All right. Look, kid.

747
01:02:15,822 --> 01:02:19,791
I'm tired of telling you the same thing.
You gotta stay still. I'll tell you what.

748
01:02:20,174 --> 01:02:24,178
Anthony, I'm gonna make a deal
with you. Anthony, pay attention.

749
01:02:24,213 --> 01:02:26,180
You gotta stay still.

750
01:02:26,297 --> 01:02:30,802
If we wanna get a good picture, we gotta
stay still. We wanna get a good picture.

751
01:02:31,302 --> 01:02:35,306
Stay still. Help that kid out.

752
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:38,309
Talk to him, grandma.
Here we go, anthony.

753
01:02:38,344 --> 01:02:41,696
Be quiet.

754
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:45,199
Stay still. Quiet, will ya!

755
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:49,203
Quiet! John, talk to him. Stay quiet!

756
01:02:49,238 --> 01:02:52,707
Hey, kid, be quiet, will ya?

757
01:02:52,742 --> 01:02:56,210
Somebody! Will you shut
the fat little bastard up?

758
01:02:56,327 --> 01:02:58,329
What is the law?

759
01:02:58,364 --> 01:03:02,333
Not to go on all fours.

760
01:03:02,368 --> 01:03:05,336
That is the law. What is the law?

761
01:03:05,371 --> 01:03:08,840
Not to shed blood.

762
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:11,843
...his prices are insane!

763
01:03:11,878 --> 01:03:14,345
[Star spangled banner

764
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:17,348
all we need is one pin, rodney.

765
01:03:17,383 --> 01:03:20,351
Now, back tolost weekend.

766
01:03:20,386 --> 01:03:24,355
He who breaks the law must
go to the house of pain.

767
01:03:24,856 --> 01:03:26,357
Back to the pain!

768
01:03:30,862 --> 01:03:34,365
Monty. Tsk, tsk.

769
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:42,373
Monty, it's 3:00 in the morning.

770
01:03:42,408 --> 01:03:47,378
Come to bed. You haven't had a
decent night's sleep in weeks.

771
01:03:47,413 --> 01:03:51,883
I don't know how to sleep.
I know how to pass out.

772
01:03:56,422 --> 01:03:59,891
Maybe you should see a doctor.

773
01:03:59,926 --> 01:04:03,895
If I see a doctor, I'll blow the whole
thing. They give you sleeping pills.

774
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:06,898
You know what I do when I can't sleep?

775
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:10,902
What? I knit.

776
01:04:10,937 --> 01:04:13,905
Maybe I'll knit myself a beer.

777
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:17,909
How about some hot
milk? It'll do you good.

778
01:04:17,944 --> 01:04:20,411
I'll try anything.

779
01:04:22,413 --> 01:04:25,917
Hot milk. Come on.

780
01:04:36,928 --> 01:04:39,931
Monty, I know what you're going through.

781
01:04:39,966 --> 01:04:42,433
Do you wanna talk about it?

782
01:04:51,442 --> 01:04:53,945
You know your friend
blanche genarouh-huh.

783
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:57,949
Her kid anthonyi called
him a fat little bastard.

784
01:05:01,988 --> 01:05:05,456
Very funny. We're laughin'
and I'm out of a job.

785
01:05:05,491 --> 01:05:07,959
Monty, you're a great photographer.

786
01:05:12,964 --> 01:05:16,968
You'll get another job. Yeahwhen?

787
01:05:17,003 --> 01:05:18,970
Meanwhile, I got nothing to do.

788
01:05:19,005 --> 01:05:22,473
What do people do when
they're not getting loaded?

789
01:05:22,508 --> 01:05:24,976
What you have to do
is change your habits.

790
01:05:25,476 --> 01:05:27,478
Yeah? Who you been talking to?

791
01:05:27,513 --> 01:05:29,981
Mrs. Dugan. She's an expert.

792
01:05:30,016 --> 01:05:32,984
She had three husbands.
They all died of alcohol.

793
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:35,486
She's no expert, she's a carrier.

794
01:05:42,493 --> 01:05:45,496
You know what I was
thinking about today?

795
01:05:45,531 --> 01:05:49,000
Coney island. When the kids were small?

796
01:05:49,035 --> 01:05:52,503
Remember the time you
put allison on the pony...

797
01:05:53,004 --> 01:05:56,007
and you tried to make the pony
smile to make allison smile?

798
01:05:56,042 --> 01:06:00,511
I never laughed so hard.
That was the good old days.

799
01:06:00,546 --> 01:06:03,014
If I make it through this,
I'll buy you coney island.

800
01:06:03,049 --> 01:06:08,019
I don't need coney island. I need you.

801
01:06:24,035 --> 01:06:26,037

hi, nicky. Hi, rose.

805
01:07:02,608 --> 01:07:06,077
Hey, kid. Oh, yo, nick.

806
01:07:06,112 --> 01:07:09,580
- What are you playing, mozart?
- Scales.

807
01:07:09,615 --> 01:07:11,582
Scales? Never heard of him.

808
01:07:11,617 --> 01:07:16,087
[Violin continues

809
01:07:16,122 --> 01:07:18,589
rose! Rose! Rose!

810
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:21,592
Hey, whoa! What are you doin'?

811
01:07:21,627 --> 01:07:23,594
Are you crackin' up?

812
01:07:23,629 --> 01:07:26,597
I tell you, nicky,
it's rough. It's rough.

813
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,602
What's the matter
with you? What is this?

814
01:07:32,103 --> 01:07:33,604
Rose told me I need hobbies.

815
01:07:34,105 --> 01:07:36,107
I'm making a plane.
It's a messerschmitt.

816
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:41,612
It's a nice job.

817
01:07:42,113 --> 01:07:43,614
I'm fed up with everything.

818
01:07:44,115 --> 01:07:46,117
I wanna go to sleep and wake up four
months from now when it's all over.

819
01:07:46,152 --> 01:07:50,121
You know what your problem is?
This whole thing ain't real to you.

820
01:07:50,621 --> 01:07:51,999
You don't know what you're coming into.

821
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,624
Did you ever see
monahan's department store?

822
01:07:53,659 --> 01:07:56,127
Once from the outside
when I dropped rose off.

823
01:07:56,162 --> 01:07:59,630
Why don't we go see it from the
insidewe'll have a few laughs.

824
01:07:59,665 --> 01:08:02,133
Huhcome on. I need a new shirt anyway.

825
01:08:06,137 --> 01:08:09,140
Rose, there's a messerschmitt in
the kitchen. Clean it up, will ya?

826
01:08:20,785 --> 01:08:22,787
Some joint, huh?

827
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:28,292
When you take over, let
me fix the bathrooms here.

828
01:08:30,795 --> 01:08:34,298
They don't go to the bathroom here.

829
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:36,300
See this?

830
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:50,815
Could somebody help us here?

831
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:54,318
I don't think so.

832
01:08:54,353 --> 01:08:57,321
My friend here, he's look-

833
01:08:57,356 --> 01:08:59,824
my friend here, he's
lookin' for a shirt.

834
01:09:00,324 --> 01:09:03,828
Yeah. You have something
in a dark black?

835
01:09:03,863 --> 01:09:07,331
He wants something he can
wear four, five days in a row.

836
01:09:09,834 --> 01:09:12,336
You have any men's shirts for men?

837
01:09:12,371 --> 01:09:14,839
Have you tried the army/navy store?

838
01:09:15,339 --> 01:09:19,343
Very funny. One more word
out of you, and he gets it.

839
01:09:19,378 --> 01:09:21,846
Come on.

840
01:09:22,346 --> 01:09:25,850
Why don't you two put your heads
together, make an ass out of yourselves?

841
01:09:31,355 --> 01:09:34,358
Where're you goin'it
says, "come in and browse."

842
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:42,366
May I help youno, thank
you. Just browsing.

843
01:09:42,401 --> 01:09:45,369
What have they got in
this place, antiques?

844
01:09:45,404 --> 01:09:47,371
No, those are the customers.

845
01:09:47,406 --> 01:09:51,375
May I help youno, thanks. Just browsing.

846
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:54,879
How long do you intend to browse?

847
01:09:54,914 --> 01:09:58,382
That lady, you didn't ask her
how long she intends to browse.

848
01:09:58,883 --> 01:10:00,647
How come you're asking us how long we

849
01:10:00,648 --> 01:10:02,887
intend to browseyou
don't look like browsers.

850
01:10:02,922 --> 01:10:05,890
What do browsers look like?
Maybe I'm half browser.

851
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:10,895
On his father's side. Nevertheless, I
prefer that you do not browse any longer.

852
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:14,398
It's a free country. If these
people can browse, we can browse.

853
01:10:14,899 --> 01:10:17,401
Nicky, let's show the
lady we're browsers, huh?

854
01:10:17,436 --> 01:10:19,904
Hey, look at us. We're browsing.

855
01:10:19,939 --> 01:10:24,909
Hey, ducks in heat.
Please! That's 18th century.

856
01:10:24,944 --> 01:10:27,411
Folks, better keep browsing
or she'll kick you out of here.

857
01:10:27,446 --> 01:10:31,415
- Look at us. We're browsing.
- Is this an odd or an end?

858
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:34,919
Lady, if I buy two odds,
will you show us your end?

859
01:10:35,035 --> 01:10:38,038
Ohh!

860
01:10:38,073 --> 01:10:41,542
Security. Security! Security!

861
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:49,550
Yesyesmr. Barlow please.

862
01:10:49,585 --> 01:10:53,053
What is itdo you know a monty capuletti?

863
01:10:53,088 --> 01:10:55,556
Yes. Well, he's on his way upstairs.

864
01:10:55,591 --> 01:10:57,558
Is he?

865
01:11:04,064 --> 01:11:08,569
Gentlemen, let's shelve these
petty matters for the moment.

866
01:11:08,604 --> 01:11:12,072
The son-in-law of our late, beloved
president is on his way to join us,

867
01:11:12,107 --> 01:11:15,576
so let's just sit around
and smoke and drink.

868
01:11:15,611 --> 01:11:17,578
Brent, brice!

869
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:23,083
Make up your mind. Which
one of us do you like?

870
01:11:23,584 --> 01:11:25,586
Down the hatch.

871
01:11:28,589 --> 01:11:32,593
Mr. Barlow, this joker
says he knows you.

872
01:11:33,093 --> 01:11:36,096
This joker is part of
the monahan family, gus.

873
01:11:36,131 --> 01:11:39,600
Oh, sorry, sir.

874
01:11:41,101 --> 01:11:44,605
People, this is monty capuletti
and his friend, nick "marino."

875
01:11:45,105 --> 01:11:49,109
No need to stand. Monty,
what brings you here?

876
01:11:49,144 --> 01:11:52,112
Nicky was lookin' to get a
shirt, but we couldn't find any.

877
01:11:52,147 --> 01:11:54,114
You got nothin' in this
store nobody wants to buy.

878
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:56,617
Monahan's has an upscale clientele.

879
01:11:57,117 --> 01:12:00,120
All our gentlemen customers
are very conscious of style.

880
01:12:00,621 --> 01:12:02,623
Men don't have style.

881
01:12:02,658 --> 01:12:05,125
Men wear clothes. Women have style.

882
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,629
What sort of shirt were you looking for?

883
01:12:08,664 --> 01:12:10,631
A regular shirt.

884
01:12:10,666 --> 01:12:13,133
See this shirtevery guy on
our block's got one of these.

885
01:12:13,168 --> 01:12:15,636
You guys don't dress regular.

886
01:12:15,671 --> 01:12:17,638
You got on vests. It's hot as hell here.

887
01:12:17,673 --> 01:12:21,141
These gentlemen and ladies were
handpicked to work for me...

888
01:12:21,176 --> 01:12:23,143
and dress accordingly.

889
01:12:23,178 --> 01:12:25,646
Where'd you find these guys, noah's ark?

890
01:12:28,148 --> 01:12:31,652
And you. There's a lot of
trouble finding your fly.

891
01:12:32,152 --> 01:12:35,155
I really must apologize.

892
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:40,160
I've made a mistake. I didn't
realize what your true talents were.

893
01:12:40,661 --> 01:12:45,666
Oh, no. You have such fashion sense.

894
01:12:45,701 --> 01:12:49,670
Everything we've been buying...
wrong. All wrong. Tell us more.

895
01:12:49,705 --> 01:12:51,672
Your pants. Our pants.

896
01:12:52,172 --> 01:12:53,674
You gotta have pants
with lots of room...

897
01:12:54,174 --> 01:12:56,176
so when you sit down, they don't split.

898
01:12:56,211 --> 01:12:59,179
And zippers that work easy so you
can fix your shorts. Know what I mean?

899
01:13:01,181 --> 01:13:04,685
Les slacks blousants avec
le zip. Whatever you say.

900
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,688
What about shoesyou need
shoes that go on and off easy.

901
01:13:07,723 --> 01:13:11,191
You know, no shoe horn. And
no laces. They slow you up.

902
01:13:11,226 --> 01:13:13,694
Yes, I see that.

903
01:13:13,729 --> 01:13:19,700
Chunky, black mailman oxfords,
with adorable white cotton socks.

904
01:13:19,735 --> 01:13:22,703
Big blousy bowling shirts.

905
01:13:22,738 --> 01:13:26,707
"Mel. The regular guy look."

906
01:13:26,742 --> 01:13:30,711
Whatyou can't be this crazy.
He looks like a rummage sale.

907
01:13:30,746 --> 01:13:34,715
I know what I'm doing. This is the
opportunity I've been waiting for.

908
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:37,718
The boredom of unemployment
could really drive a man to drink.

909
01:13:38,218 --> 01:13:41,221
So could you too. Take it
easy, nicky. Take it easy.

910
01:13:41,256 --> 01:13:43,223
We need a mind like yours.

911
01:13:43,724 --> 01:13:48,228
I'd like to offer you a position
as fashion consultant to monahan's.

912
01:13:48,729 --> 01:13:52,232
Who mei'm no fashion consultant.
What's the matter with you?

913
01:13:52,267 --> 01:13:54,234
Take the job.

914
01:13:54,735 --> 01:13:56,737
The first thing we do is
fire that broad downstairs...

915
01:13:56,772 --> 01:13:59,239
that stopped us from browsing.

916
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:03,243
Get me sergio. Track down alfonso.
Draw up a budget for mr. Capuletti.

917
01:14:03,278 --> 01:14:05,746
Let's leak the story to the press.

918
01:14:13,288 --> 01:14:16,256
Hello.

919
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:19,760
Mr. Capuletti, please. It's
for you. It's your wife.

920
01:14:21,762 --> 01:14:23,764
Rose, they took all my clothes!

921
01:14:24,264 --> 01:14:26,266
When are you coming home?

922
01:14:26,301 --> 01:14:29,019
How can I come home?
I got nothing to wear.

923
01:14:29,054 --> 01:14:31,021
I'll call you later. Take this.

924
01:14:31,056 --> 01:14:33,524
Turn away, please. Next shirt.

925
01:14:33,559 --> 01:14:35,526
Take it easy, honey. I got no good side.

926
01:14:35,561 --> 01:14:38,028
Could you please turn away?

927
01:14:38,529 --> 01:14:41,532
Scrape the gum off the
soles and analyze the shoes.

928
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:45,035
Should these shorts be duplicated?
Duplicated and fumigated.

929
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:47,538
Next. I have the blacks for the shirts.

930
01:14:47,573 --> 01:14:50,040
That's mr. Capuletti's department now.

931
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:55,546
I have midnight black,
raven black, licorice black-

932
01:14:55,581 --> 01:14:57,548
if nicky was here, you'd
have black-and-blue black.

933
01:14:57,931 --> 01:14:59,933
Twelve inches.

934
01:14:59,968 --> 01:15:02,686
Boy, you're way off.

935
01:15:10,194 --> 01:15:13,697
Ladies and gentlemen.
Compliments of monty capuletti,

936
01:15:13,732 --> 01:15:17,201
invitations to the premiere of
monahan's "the regular guy look."

937
01:15:17,236 --> 01:15:19,203
Barkeeper, I'll have
a perrier with a twist.

938
01:15:19,238 --> 01:15:22,206
I'm sorry. I only have perrier on draft.

939
01:15:22,241 --> 01:15:24,208
Nicholas, patrick, how
good to see you again.

940
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:27,711
I know what you're
thinking. Why am I slumming?

941
01:15:27,746 --> 01:15:31,715
I'm here to hand-deliver
these invitations to you.

942
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:35,219
But I'm not sure if you should attend.

943
01:15:35,254 --> 01:15:37,221
We're his friends.
We'll be there. Gimme.

944
01:15:37,721 --> 01:15:39,603
It's your decision. I'm sure your

945
01:15:39,604 --> 01:15:42,226
intentions are the
best, but think about it.

946
01:15:42,726 --> 01:15:47,731
It's not good for monty to associate
with people who do what heusedto do.

947
01:15:47,766 --> 01:15:51,235
We would protect him from
that. He's talking about us.

948
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:54,238
If you really are monty's friends,
you'll stop making it hard for him.

949
01:15:54,273 --> 01:15:56,740
Look at you. You're smoking, drinking.

950
01:15:56,775 --> 01:15:59,243
We're in a bar. What
do you expect us to do?

951
01:15:59,278 --> 01:16:01,245
You must think I'm stupid or something.

952
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,747
I look like I just got off a boat?

953
01:16:03,782 --> 01:16:07,251
I know what you're trying to do. Get
out of here before I give you a slap.

954
01:16:07,286 --> 01:16:09,753
Nicky, take it easy.

955
01:16:09,788 --> 01:16:14,758
Nick, you do want monty to
have the money, don't you?

956
01:16:19,263 --> 01:16:23,767
What do you let it get to you
forhe just wants the money.

957
01:16:23,802 --> 01:16:28,272
But what bothers me is
he's right. So he's right.

958
01:16:28,307 --> 01:16:30,774
Think he's right? I
mean, nicky's his coach.

959
01:16:30,809 --> 01:16:34,278
He tells him eat fruit,
tells him to exercise.

960
01:16:34,313 --> 01:16:39,283
It's not what he says, it's
what we do. It's peer pressure.

961
01:16:39,318 --> 01:16:42,286
Oh, yeah. Our lives are attractive.

962
01:16:55,165 --> 01:16:58,669
I guess nicky and paddy won't show.

963
01:16:58,704 --> 01:17:01,672
They didn't call, either, huh?

964
01:17:01,707 --> 01:17:03,674
No. Tonight, we present...

965
01:17:04,174 --> 01:17:06,677
our tribute to the american silhouette.

966
01:17:06,712 --> 01:17:09,680
Ladies and gentlemen,
"the regular guy look."

967
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,689
Jonathan and billy are wearing the
regular guy leisure look for fall.

968
01:17:18,724 --> 01:17:21,692
Bold print, double-knit
polyester pants...

969
01:17:21,727 --> 01:17:25,195
with totally
non-coordinated print shirts.

970
01:17:27,698 --> 01:17:30,200
Pie is wearing the
italian restaurant look.

971
01:17:32,738 --> 01:17:35,205
Perfect for picnics where you
can be your own tablecloth.

972
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:39,209
Tie has the bowling alley sportif look.

973
01:17:39,244 --> 01:17:42,212
Next up, peter, wearing...

974
01:17:42,247 --> 01:17:45,716
the regular guy lounge look in black...

975
01:17:45,751 --> 01:17:48,719
on black, on black.

976
01:17:49,219 --> 01:17:53,223
I think they like it.
Everyone's smiling.

977
01:17:56,261 --> 01:18:01,231
You like to gambletake a
chance on the regular guy robe.

978
01:18:07,237 --> 01:18:10,240
American classic...

979
01:18:10,275 --> 01:18:12,743
iridescent blue sharkskin.

980
01:18:18,248 --> 01:18:20,751
That suit. Look at that suit.

981
01:18:20,786 --> 01:18:22,753
Have you seen the suit-

982
01:18:24,755 --> 01:18:26,757
and now...

983
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:30,761
I'd like to introduce the man
responsible for this evening.

984
01:18:31,261 --> 01:18:34,264
Mr. Monty capuletti!

985
01:18:34,299 --> 01:18:36,266
Take a bow, monty.

986
01:18:58,288 --> 01:19:00,791
Fatty. Eating again, fatty, fatty?

987
01:19:00,826 --> 01:19:03,794
Fatty, fatty. Eating
again, fatty, fatty?

988
01:19:03,829 --> 01:19:07,297
Fatty, fatty, fatty-

989
01:19:07,332 --> 01:19:09,800
who put this in here?
I was trying to help.

990
01:19:09,835 --> 01:19:12,803
Don't help. I'm tired of
people trying to help me.

991
01:19:15,305 --> 01:19:18,809
Monty, calm down. What
are you lookin' at?

992
01:19:18,844 --> 01:19:20,811
Go clean your room. It's a pigsty.

993
01:19:20,846 --> 01:19:23,313
Leave me alone!

994
01:19:23,348 --> 01:19:27,317
I know what you're
thinkin' too. Oh, god.

995
01:19:27,352 --> 01:19:29,319
All I ever wanted was a happy family.

996
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:32,322
That's all I ever asked
for, a happy family.

997
01:19:32,357 --> 01:19:36,326
A family that loved each other.
I never cared about anything else.

998
01:19:37,828 --> 01:19:41,331
Stop it. I can't take it no more.

999
01:19:41,832 --> 01:19:45,335
Money caused all this.

1000
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:49,339
I don't wanna be rich. We're
not supposed to be rich.

1001
01:19:49,374 --> 01:19:52,342
We don't look rich, we don't
talk rich, we don't smell rich!

1002
01:19:52,843 --> 01:19:56,346
No more rich! I want our
house to be the way it was.

1003
01:20:02,352 --> 01:20:05,355
Hey, fatty, fatty.

1004
01:20:05,856 --> 01:20:10,360
Monty, where are you goingi'll
be at louie's... gettin' drunk.

1005
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:12,612
Take this, julio. Go and get her.

1006
01:20:12,647 --> 01:20:16,116
She's your wife. Go get
her. Right, she's my wife.

1007
01:20:16,151 --> 01:20:18,118
A gun. I don't want a gun.

1008
01:20:18,153 --> 01:20:20,620
Go back and get her, julio.

1009
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:23,623
I must've been nuts to do this for-

1010
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:25,625
ah, look who's here.

1011
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:28,128
I want her back, man. She's mine.

1012
01:20:28,512 --> 01:20:30,514
Put that thing away.
You'll hurt yourself.

1013
01:20:30,549 --> 01:20:34,518
I'm in no mood for you.
There is no mood for you.

1014
01:20:43,061 --> 01:20:46,029
Nurse! Where is she?

1015
01:20:46,064 --> 01:20:48,532
They're never here when you need 'em.

1016
01:20:52,035 --> 01:20:54,538
Boy, oh, boy.

1017
01:20:54,573 --> 01:20:58,542
Oh, nurse, you're here.
Where were you, huh?

1018
01:20:58,577 --> 01:21:01,044
Three hundred and fifty
bucks a day, where are ya?

1019
01:21:01,545 --> 01:21:03,046
Where are ya?

1020
01:21:03,547 --> 01:21:07,050
Look at this. I'm dying of thirst here.

1021
01:21:07,085 --> 01:21:10,053
Hey, how ya doin'I heard about
your unfortunate incident.

1022
01:21:10,088 --> 01:21:12,556
Where were you when I needed you?

1023
01:21:12,591 --> 01:21:14,558
I came to make up. I'm sorry.

1024
01:21:14,593 --> 01:21:18,562
All right, nicky, we're
friends. All right?

1025
01:21:19,062 --> 01:21:21,064
It must be tough eatin', huh?

1026
01:21:21,565 --> 01:21:25,068
Eatyou should see me go to the bathroom.

1027
01:21:25,103 --> 01:21:29,573
Monty! Hi, nicky. We're
back. Rose, you're here.

1028
01:21:29,608 --> 01:21:34,578
How's our patient today?
Oh, he looks much better.

1029
01:21:34,613 --> 01:21:38,081
How did you sleepare you
kiddin'I was up all night.

1030
01:21:38,116 --> 01:21:41,084
Let's look at the chart.

1031
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:44,588
He was hit in the fleshy
area of the gluteus maximus.

1032
01:21:44,623 --> 01:21:47,090
Ah, you're wrong. He got me in the ass.

1033
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:50,093
No vital areas were damaged.

1034
01:21:50,128 --> 01:21:53,096
No doubt he'll recover. How
long do I have to be here?

1035
01:21:53,131 --> 01:21:57,100
Let me see now. Perhaps we
might have to keep you here...

1036
01:21:57,601 --> 01:22:00,604
for four, maybe five weeks.

1037
01:22:01,104 --> 01:22:03,106
I'm not hangin' here for five weeks.

1038
01:22:03,141 --> 01:22:05,108
At least I know you're
gonna be all right.

1039
01:22:05,143 --> 01:22:08,111
I gotta pick up my mother at the
beauty parlor. So long, nicky.

1040
01:22:13,151 --> 01:22:16,620
How are you feeling
today? You're looking good.

1041
01:22:18,622 --> 01:22:22,626
Oh, daddy!

1042
01:22:23,126 --> 01:22:27,130
I never realized how
much julio loved me.

1043
01:22:27,165 --> 01:22:31,134
It was the most romantic
moment of my life...

1044
01:22:31,169 --> 01:22:34,754
when he almost killed you.

1045
01:22:34,789 --> 01:22:36,756
Can I call you "dad" now?

1046
01:22:37,224 --> 01:22:39,326
Take it easy!

1047
01:22:39,361 --> 01:22:41,828
These are new stitches, you know.

1048
01:22:42,329 --> 01:22:44,331
Why can't you forgive and forget?

1049
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:47,467
How could I forgetevery time
I sit down, I'll think of him.

1050
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:49,970
Monty, how are you?

1051
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:53,473
What an insensitive
question. You've been shot.

1052
01:22:53,508 --> 01:22:56,343
This'll cheer you up. We're a hit.

1053
01:22:56,378 --> 01:22:58,845
What are you talking about?
They all laughed at me.

1054
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,848
But we're laughing now,
all the way to my bank.

1055
01:23:01,883 --> 01:23:03,850
Look at this. What?

1056
01:23:05,852 --> 01:23:08,855
We put the clothes in the window,
and the kids went crazy for it.

1057
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:12,359
I don't understand it, but who cares?

1058
01:23:12,394 --> 01:23:14,861
The regular guy look is a big success.

1059
01:23:14,896 --> 01:23:19,366
You did the regular guy looki just bought
two of your short-sleeve pajama tops.

1060
01:23:19,401 --> 01:23:23,370
Rose, I gotta get out of
here. Daddy, this is great!

1061
01:23:23,405 --> 01:23:26,873
By the time you get out of the
hospital, we'll have the money.

1062
01:23:26,908 --> 01:23:28,875
And you'll lose weight too.

1063
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:32,879
I saw the food. Monty, she's
right. Your ship's come in.

1064
01:23:32,914 --> 01:23:35,882
But my pier collapsed.

1065
01:23:35,917 --> 01:23:38,885
Everyone out. Visiting
hours are over. Please!

1066
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,389
We have sick men in here.
You too, doctor. Please.

1067
01:23:42,889 --> 01:23:45,892
Excuse me, the two of you.

1068
01:23:45,927 --> 01:23:48,895
This is a hospital.
Hey, come on, let's go.

1069
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:51,398
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. My good-

1070
01:23:51,898 --> 01:23:53,900
excuse me. Will you get outlet's go!

1071
01:23:53,935 --> 01:23:55,402
Daddy!

1072
01:23:55,437 --> 01:23:57,904
How are you, mr. "manuccl"bye, monty.

1073
01:23:58,405 --> 01:24:01,908
Martha's gonna take good care
of you today. How was your lunch?

1074
01:24:01,943 --> 01:24:05,412
I see you haven't eaten much
of it. I don't blame you, honey.

1075
01:24:05,447 --> 01:24:09,299
While I'm up here, check my oil.

1076
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:34,324
Jesus. We trust you had
a pleasant swim, sir.

1077
01:24:34,824 --> 01:24:37,327
Your shirt. I don't want
that shirt. Are you kiddin'?

1078
01:24:37,362 --> 01:24:40,830
But you should be dressed to your
station. I don't want to wear that!

1079
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:47,087
Yesthis is mr. Capuletti's
business advisor.

1080
01:24:47,587 --> 01:24:52,592
What can I do for youbetter
yet, what can you do for me?

1081
01:24:52,627 --> 01:24:56,096
Silver is downcall the lone
ranger. He'll cheer him up.

1082
01:24:56,131 --> 01:25:00,100
Hello.

1083
01:25:00,135 --> 01:25:02,602
Oil wells? Very interesting.

1084
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:08,108
Meatballs, sir? No.

1085
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:13,613
Madam? No.

1086
01:25:18,153 --> 01:25:21,121
Meatball, sir?

1087
01:25:21,156 --> 01:25:24,624
Where's the pistachio nutsthere's
too much trouble with the shells.

1088
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:27,627
Oh, yeah? I like the shells.

1089
01:25:27,662 --> 01:25:29,629
Hmm.

1090
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:36,136
You got any salami or provolone?

1091
01:25:36,171 --> 01:25:38,638
Salami, salami. Provolone.

1092
01:25:39,139 --> 01:25:40,640
Give it to him.

1093
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:44,144
Why don't you get some sun
and come back next week?

1094
01:25:44,179 --> 01:25:46,646
Julio?

1095
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:49,149
Julio?

1096
01:25:51,651 --> 01:25:54,154
Julio.

1097
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:57,657
Julio.

1098
01:25:57,692 --> 01:26:02,662
Oh, you bad boy. You
were hiding from me.

1099
01:26:02,697 --> 01:26:05,165
No. I found you now.

1100
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:09,169
You gonna play with me? Not... again.

1101
01:26:09,204 --> 01:26:13,173
Look what I wore just for
you. Allison, I'm exhausted.

1102
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:15,175
Chapter six, "el joyo."

1103
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:18,178
You hired a captainyep.
Everything's taken care of.

1104
01:26:18,213 --> 01:26:21,681
He know how to get to coney
islandyeah, I told him. It's easy.

1105
01:26:21,716 --> 01:26:24,184
Here, I'll show you.

1106
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:33,193
You go north up the atlantic,
west into the hudson.

1107
01:26:33,228 --> 01:26:35,695
Come to the statue of that
broad, you hang a right.

1108
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:39,199
Takes 20 minutes, a
half hour with traffic.

1109
01:26:39,234 --> 01:26:42,202
Tell him to shove off as soon as I
sign those papers with scrappleton.

1110
01:26:43,703 --> 01:26:46,706
What's that, a fire drill?

1111
01:26:46,741 --> 01:26:52,212
It's lunch. Come on.
I'm starving. Let's go.

1112
01:26:55,116 --> 01:26:58,585
Congratulations. Daddy, I
just saw the cutest dingy.

1113
01:26:59,085 --> 01:27:02,088
Allison, you're married to julio.

1114
01:27:02,123 --> 01:27:06,593
This is the life, huhand they
say money can't buy happiness.

1115
01:27:06,628 --> 01:27:09,095
At least you can pick
your own kind of misery.

1116
01:27:11,097 --> 01:27:15,602
Clive, you're the only one who hasn't
seen my stitches. Want to take a look?

1117
01:27:24,611 --> 01:27:28,114
Ooh. Ooh. Ahh!

1118
01:27:28,149 --> 01:27:30,116
Oh, no! Ahh!

1119
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:35,004
Excuse me.

1120
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:37,874
Mr. Daniel scrappleton, sir.

1121
01:27:37,909 --> 01:27:40,877
Hey, scrappy, show me
that dotted line, huh?

1122
01:27:40,912 --> 01:27:43,379
And mrs. Kathleen monahan.

1123
01:27:43,414 --> 01:27:46,382
Oh, no!

1124
01:27:48,419 --> 01:27:52,889
My god! It's mother. She's back from
the dead. She's better than houdini.

1125
01:27:53,389 --> 01:27:55,892
I've never felt better in my life!

1126
01:27:55,927 --> 01:27:59,395
Grandma, did you bring me
anythinga hat just like mine.

1127
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:02,398
You never felt better?
You were in a plane crash.

1128
01:28:02,899 --> 01:28:05,902
There was no crash. I
made up the whole thing.

1129
01:28:05,937 --> 01:28:09,906
Whyrose, I did it for
you and the grandchildren.

1130
01:28:09,941 --> 01:28:12,909
Someone had to stop monty's debauchery.

1131
01:28:13,409 --> 01:28:16,412
He was going to hell in a
hand basket. Yes, quite true.

1132
01:28:16,447 --> 01:28:18,414
And to test you as well. You failed!

1133
01:28:18,449 --> 01:28:21,417
I'll kill her. I'll
kill her! Take it easy.

1134
01:28:21,452 --> 01:28:23,419
I'll kill her! I'll kill her!

1135
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,421
I'll kill her! Let me go!

1136
01:28:25,805 --> 01:28:29,309
Boy, you got some
nerve still being alive.

1137
01:28:29,344 --> 01:28:31,811
I went through this
whole thing for nothin'?

1138
01:28:31,846 --> 01:28:36,816
No, not for nothing, monty.
You proved yourself to me.

1139
01:28:38,818 --> 01:28:42,322
And to make sure that you stay
on the straight and narrow,

1140
01:28:42,357 --> 01:28:45,825
I'm moving in with you.

1141
01:29:03,343 --> 01:29:06,346
What's for dessert? Spumoni, miss.

1142
01:29:06,381 --> 01:29:08,848
Your favorite, monty.

1143
01:29:08,883 --> 01:29:12,352
Shrimpton, none for mr. Capuletti.

1144
01:29:12,387 --> 01:29:14,854
Right, mom. And shrimpton.

1145
01:29:14,889 --> 01:29:17,357
Mr. Capuletti is
skipping the coffee too.

1146
01:29:17,392 --> 01:29:20,860
It'll keep me awake,
right, momright, dear.

1147
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:25,865
And shrimpton, I noticed a bottle
of beer in the refrigerator.

1148
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:30,870
Get rid of it. Tsk, tsk,
tsk. Right again, mom.

1149
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:35,375
Well, I guess that's it for me.

1150
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:39,379
I think I'll go out and walk
off all these vegetables.

1151
01:29:39,879 --> 01:29:44,384
And after that... it's bedtime.

1152
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:48,388
Good night, honey.
Good night, sweetheart.

1153
01:29:49,389 --> 01:29:51,891
And shrimpton? Yes, sir.

1154
01:29:51,926 --> 01:29:54,894
You better get rid of that
glazed fruit too. It's fattening.

1155
01:29:54,929 --> 01:29:57,397
Certainly, sir.

1156
01:29:57,432 --> 01:30:01,401
Good night, belinda. Good night, daddy.

1157
01:30:01,436 --> 01:30:03,820
Ooh. Good night, mom.

1158
01:30:06,422 --> 01:30:10,927
Hey, mom. That perfume
is driving me crazy.

1159
01:30:12,929 --> 01:30:15,932
I think I married rose
to get to you, huh?

1160
01:30:22,438 --> 01:30:24,440
Good night, all.

1161
01:30:26,442 --> 01:30:30,446
Rose, he's a changed man.

1162
01:30:30,481 --> 01:30:34,951
- Finally, you've got a good marriage.
- We had a good marriage before.

1163
01:30:35,451 --> 01:30:39,956
Yes, but now you're
married to a human being.

1164
01:30:39,991 --> 01:30:44,460
I don't mind telling you,
I'm proud of what I did.

1165
01:30:44,495 --> 01:30:46,462
It wasn't easy,

1166
01:30:46,497 --> 01:30:50,466
but now I've got him under control!

1167
01:30:50,967 --> 01:30:52,468
Where's the pizza? I'm starving!

1168
01:30:52,969 --> 01:30:55,471
Monty, where you beenwe're
keeping it warm for you.

1169
01:30:56,973 --> 01:31:00,476
Wait a minute. Don't
get grease on the cards.

1170
01:31:01,978 --> 01:31:04,480
Gimme the red pepper, will you?

1171
01:31:04,515 --> 01:31:06,983
Gimme a napkin.

1172
01:31:07,018 --> 01:31:09,986
What'd you tell her tonighttonight?

1173
01:31:10,486 --> 01:31:14,490
I told her her perfume
is driving me crazy.

1174
01:31:14,991 --> 01:31:18,995
Then I told her I married
rose to get to her.

1175
01:31:21,032 --> 01:31:22,999
Gimme a beer.

1176
01:31:23,034 --> 01:31:28,004
My mother-in-law. For years I wouldn't
kiss her face, I ended up kissin' her ass.

1177
01:31:35,011 --> 01:31:37,013
All right?

1178
01:31:46,057 --> 01:31:49,525
You don't have to talk all night?

1179
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:52,528
I'm a man who can't say no?

1180
01:31:52,563 --> 01:31:56,032
You don't have to twist my arm?

1181
01:31:56,067 --> 01:31:58,534
Just point me where you wanna go?

1182
01:31:58,569 --> 01:32:01,537
Take me to the action
take me to the track?

1183
01:32:02,038 --> 01:32:04,540
Take me to a party if
they're bettin' in the back?

1184
01:32:04,575 --> 01:32:08,544
I've been workin' all my
life can't afford to wait?

1185
01:32:08,579 --> 01:32:11,547
Let me call my wife so I
can tell her I'll be late?

1186
01:32:11,582 --> 01:32:14,550
I want the easy mmm?

1187
01:32:14,585 --> 01:32:17,553
Easy, easy money?

1188
01:32:17,588 --> 01:32:20,556
I could get lucky?

1189
01:32:20,591 --> 01:32:24,060
Oh, things could go right?

1190
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,563
I want the easy?

1191
01:32:27,598 --> 01:32:30,566
Easy, easy money?

1192
01:32:30,601 --> 01:32:34,070
Maybe this one time?

1193
01:32:34,105 --> 01:32:37,073
Maybe tonight?

1194
01:32:42,113 --> 01:32:45,581
You don't have to try too hard?

1195
01:32:45,616 --> 01:32:49,085
I don't need a song and dance?

1196
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:52,088
I don't need an invitation?

1197
01:32:52,588 --> 01:32:54,590
If you've got a game of chance?

1198
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:58,094
Take me to the tables
take me to the fights?

1199
01:32:58,129 --> 01:33:01,097
Run me like the numbers
roll me like the dice?

1200
01:33:01,132 --> 01:33:04,600
When you're countin' on a
killin' always count me in?

1201
01:33:04,635 --> 01:33:07,603
Talk me into losin' just
as long as I can win?

1202
01:33:07,638 --> 01:33:10,606
I want the easy?

1203
01:33:10,641 --> 01:33:13,609
Easy, easy money?

1204
01:33:13,644 --> 01:33:16,612
I want the good times?

1205
01:33:16,647 --> 01:33:20,116
Oh, I never had?

1206
01:33:20,616 --> 01:33:23,119
I want the easy?

1207
01:33:23,154 --> 01:33:26,122
Mmm, easy money ooh?

1208
01:33:26,622 --> 01:33:29,625
Oh, I want the good life?

1209
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:32,628
Mmm, I want it bad?

1210
01:33:32,663 --> 01:33:37,633
Easy money you say I fool myself?

1211
01:33:37,668 --> 01:33:40,636
But better me than being
a fool for someone else?

1212
01:33:40,671 --> 01:33:46,142
I got a hot slot machine
of a system ready to go?

1213
01:33:46,177 --> 01:33:49,145
Easy money?

1214
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:53,649
I got a one-track mind and a good
reputation layin' on the line?

1215
01:33:53,684 --> 01:33:56,152
I'll either come back a bum or a king?

1216
01:33:56,652 --> 01:34:00,156
Baby, I don't know?

1217
01:34:00,191 --> 01:34:02,658
Ahh-hah?

1218
01:34:08,199 --> 01:34:11,667
You sure don't have to start a fight?

1219
01:34:11,702 --> 01:34:14,670
I'm a man who can't say no?

1220
01:34:14,705 --> 01:34:18,174
If you got a little risky business?

1221
01:34:18,674 --> 01:34:20,676
Just point me where you wanna go?

1222
01:34:20,711 --> 01:34:24,180
Take me to the power
take me to the heat?

1223
01:34:24,215 --> 01:34:27,183
Take me to the cleaners if
it's open to the streets?

1224
01:34:27,218 --> 01:34:30,686
Something's got to pay
off someone's got to break?

1225
01:34:30,721 --> 01:34:33,689
Someone's got a fortune that
they're begging me to take?

1226
01:34:33,724 --> 01:34:36,692
I want the easy?

1227
01:34:36,727 --> 01:34:39,695
Easy, easy money?

1228
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:43,199
I could get lucky?

1229
01:34:43,234 --> 01:34:46,202
Things could go right?

1230
01:34:46,237 --> 01:34:49,705
Oh, I want the easy?

1231
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:52,708
Easy, easy money?

1232
01:34:52,743 --> 01:34:55,711
Maybe just this time?

1233
01:34:55,746 --> 01:34:58,714
Oh, maybe tonight?

1234
01:34:58,749 --> 01:35:01,217
Easy money?

1235
01:35:01,717 --> 01:35:04,720
I don't want no hard cash?

1236
01:35:04,755 --> 01:35:08,724
I just want the easy money?

1237
01:35:08,759 --> 01:35:12,228
Oh, oh I could get lucky?

1238
01:35:12,263 --> 01:35:14,230
Easy money?

1239
01:35:14,265 --> 01:35:19,235
Oh, I got to, got to
