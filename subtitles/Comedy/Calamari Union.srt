1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,834
<i>Dedicated to those</i>
<i>ghosts of Baudelaire</i> -

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>Michaux and Prevert who</i>
<i>still hover on this Earth....</i>

3
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,532
Gentlemen.

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,740
I don't want to tire
you or myself-

5
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,037
by going through
the many reasons -

6
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:51,411
why life is impossible
in this part of the city.

7
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:56,749
We all know the circumstances
forced on us in our early years:

8
00:00:57,024 --> 00:01:00,824
Crowded homes,
ignorance and hunger.

9
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,758
Not to mention stuffy buses -

10
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:08,331
with irregular timetables.

11
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,700
There are more hills here -

12
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,772
than anywhere else
in the world!

13
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,377
Loose-running kids and dogs -

14
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,206
make it impossible
to move in the streets.

15
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,574
Like lepers we hide
in the back alleys.

16
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:28,681
We are humiliated
and spat on -

17
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:34,293
as if we weren't free members
of a proud nation.

18
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:40,531
Besides, an evil old woman
kicked me in shin once -

19
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:44,268
only because I opened my
mouth in the wrong place.

20
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,139
I'm not a dog.

21
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,706
I know that you can also -

22
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,210
respect yourselves slightly,
if necessary.

23
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,713
That is why we are here today:
No more crying -

24
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:02,287
it's time to leave.
The decision is not easy.

25
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:08,317
Many of us have strong
emotional ties here.

26
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,996
Many must sacrifice
their childhood -

27
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,098
their memories
and their families.

28
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:20,001
"The branch of a rotten tree must
seek a healthier trunk."

29
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:25,177
We have all heard our
grandparents and our parents -

30
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:29,576
talk of Eira, a place on
the other side of the city.

31
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:34,686
The streets are wide and the air
is smooth and fresh there.

32
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,591
That is our destination tonight.

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,285
Before we move on to
practical matters -

34
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,761
I want to be certain that
everyone realises -

35
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:49,834
the dangers and
responsibilities of our journey.

36
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,165
The floor is yours, Frank.
- Thank you, Frank.

37
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:57,434
I have organised us transport
to the extreme centre of the city.

38
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,841
After that it's every
man for himself.

39
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,614
Some will take the southern,
others the northern route -

40
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,447
some will attempt a break
straight through the lines.

41
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,317
As we are all poor
we shall now share -

42
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,621
the funds our society
has inherited.

43
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:30,405
The body and blood of Christ...

44
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,883
The body and blood of Christ...

45
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:44,246
That's it. We'll leave at six.

46
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,191
Frank here.

47
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,858
Hi. Listen, we...

48
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,536
Yes, I did the shopping.

49
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,404
Alright, I'll come right away.

50
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,009
Oh fuck!

51
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,998
This sure is different
than back home.

52
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,998
Isn't it, Frank?

53
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,239
Good day.
- Good evening.

54
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,033
A single room. - Welcome.
Your name, please?

55
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,335
Frank Merciless.

56
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,952
Haven't you seen enough already?

57
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,560
I'll check out a couple more.

58
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:38,135
Let's go or we'll get nowhere.

59
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,832
You can go anywhere
you want.

60
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,110
I don't even count.

61
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,081
I called Sirpa this morning.
We'll eat at five.

62
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,079
I'm not hungry.

63
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,083
I've got a full stomach.

64
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:37,024
Dammit!
I think I'll split. I'm free!

65
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,358
Freedom...

66
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,598
Good morning, Frank!

67
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,697
Morning.

68
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:03,045
How about a cup of coffee
before we go on? - All right.

69
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:44,120
You got any money,
Frank? - No.

70
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,993
Why?
- I need some breakfast.

71
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,761
Morning!

72
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:02,632
Four years ago, miss...

73
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,316
Hello, Frank. - Hi!

74
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:16,113
Still here?
The others will have the best bits.

75
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,987
The night is dangerous.

76
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,026
You can stumble into people
and things laying in the street -

77
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,257
and break your leg.
All cats are grey.

78
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,766
The streets lead wherever,
many have lost their way.

79
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,963
Dangers abound,
there is hunger and thirst.

80
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,507
Frank and I decided to
wait for daybreak.

81
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:42,475
If you don't do something
at once you'll never do it.

82
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,842
Turn yourways now or
you'll be eternally damned.

83
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:49,146
If you want to reach your goal,
you must heal yourself-

84
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,823
of sickness, poverty,
misery and gloom.

85
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,824
Taste for work is
all that's needed.

86
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:00,197
Fulfil the daily demands of
wisdom and responsibilities.

87
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,396
What's the time?

88
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,628
Good morning, Frank!
Sleep well?

89
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,704
Why, thanks, Frank.

90
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:13,402
Daily work would make
life more tolerable.

91
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,340
Work for six days
in a row!

92
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:22,215
You start, you use your talents
for deducting and analysing.

93
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:26,414
You must find the fury
for daily action!

94
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,250
What do you say, Frank?

95
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:34,364
Without love Frank is
but a tinkling bell.

96
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,934
On the other hand,
when you're very young -

97
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:42,037
you may feel that you
can afford to wait.

98
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,706
That you have years
ahead of you.

99
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,081
All lies!
- Let's take...

100
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,417
Frank, for instance.

101
00:20:55,621 --> 00:21:00,354
He's stupid, ignorant,
can't keep his mouth shut.

102
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:05,690
His conception of morals
has the finesse -

103
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,731
of a hamburger.

104
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,027
What does he say
about his mother?

105
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,034
Or the Sanitation Service?

106
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,538
That a woman can fall in love
with a toilet seat like him -

107
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,041
is proof of the state of abasement
of the woman of our century!

108
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:24,376
Who are you talking about?
- Sit down, Frank.

109
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,877
Who are they talking about?

110
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:30,214
You, Frank.
- Shut up, Frank!

111
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,497
You swine!

112
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,031
OK, Pekka, -

113
00:22:57,243 --> 00:23:00,303
we've heard that
many times before.

114
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,343
Last days -

115
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:13,848
have been... a bit rough.

116
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,495
I've been a bit mixed up.

117
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,356
I haven't known
which side I'm on.

118
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,830
What? Where?

119
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,022
Fucking asshole!

120
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,358
I thought he'd take me
straight to Eira.

121
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,126
But he just keeps
driving round the block.

122
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,429
I've got an idea,
if you don't mind.

123
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,269
We'll go to a bank.

124
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,912
I'll get a loan with you
as my security.

125
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:12,914
We'll buy a bus and drive
through the damn city!

126
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,779
What do you think?

127
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:18,388
Not bad.
- Fucking bad.

128
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:22,318
I don't sit in a bus. I'm me!

129
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,398
Who's going to drive?
- I'll drive.

130
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:32,598
We'll let Frank drive.

131
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:18,014
This old shit won't start.

132
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,906
Hey, Frank!
Let's go to the bank!

133
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,198
A decent bus costs 28,000.

134
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:15,539
Then we need gas, food and
refreshments - that's 36,500.

135
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,403
But we must have
it right away.

136
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:23,673
For a new customer without
any securities I really can't...

137
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,044
Just take a look outside.

138
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,395
I see.

139
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,800
I don't know why a man
in my position -

140
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,531
has to come here to beg.

141
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,973
I should get what
I need delivered -

142
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:57,148
to my home every morning.
If I had a home.

143
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,646
But that doesn't change anything.

144
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,881
I think we'd better go, Frank.

145
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,253
Go tell Frank, Frank.

146
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,961
Let's go, Frank.

147
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,128
Keep out of this, Frank.
We're ready in a minute.

148
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,268
OK, Frank.

149
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,693
I can't walk any longer.

150
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,371
OK, Frank.

151
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,070
I'm thirsty, Frank.

152
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,995
Two ice waters.

153
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:58,422
Sit down, please.

154
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,334
What do you want?

155
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,946
Leave everything
and come with me.

156
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,843
I've got a good job
and a flat here.

157
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,512
What can you offer?

158
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,847
I'll build a house
by the sea -

159
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,081
on the other side
of the city.

160
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,453
Then I'll go into business -

161
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,422
and build a career.

162
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,360
I can even think
about having kids.

163
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,760
They don't mean a thing.

164
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,427
When will all this happen?

165
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:42,869
As soon as you tell me
the way to Eira.

166
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,437
That kind of trip costs money.

167
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:49,842
Money's not a problem
- so far.

168
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,120
I'll let you know after
a couple of days.

169
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,960
I can't wait that long.

170
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,236
Sweet dreams, Frank.

171
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,398
Let's take a taxi.
- You got any money?

172
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,569
No. You?
- No.

173
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,364
Let's take a taxi.
- Right!

174
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,373
Take us to Eira.

175
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:34,477
This time of night?
That's too far...

176
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:37,381
Somewhere where we
can get a drink, then.

177
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,149
All the bars are closed already.

178
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,952
Try to think of something.

179
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,145
What are you doing, Frank?

180
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,496
I wanted to die.

181
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,335
I was lost...
you'd left me here.

182
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:34,437
I didn't know where to go.

183
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,979
You'd left me.
Why did you come back?

184
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,380
Go away, I want to die.
- No. Come with us.

185
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,387
OK.

186
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:31,658
Pity you didn't get
run over, Frank.

187
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,677
Why?

188
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,908
Don't you like me?

189
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:57,779
'Cause you're so
fucking stupid, Frank.

190
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,291
That was a bit too much.

191
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:09,323
I've been... thinking.

192
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:20,273
Thinking? You?

193
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,850
I'm sorry.

194
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:41,963
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Honestly!

195
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:46,228
You're OK.

196
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,317
We'd better go.

197
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:05,985
I could take you to
a guy I know.

198
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,348
Miss!

199
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,788
Yes? What'll it be?

200
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,518
Hi, Frank! - Hi.
A glass of ice water.

201
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,198
Ice water? - Ice water.

202
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,642
What are you doing here?

203
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:03,146
Just a moment.

204
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,980
Frank's here.

205
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,753
Hi Frank. We can sit here.

206
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:23,900
Hi, Frank!
- Back to work!

207
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:27,269
Lazybones. - Hi.

208
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,008
We got this joint now.

209
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,844
We're trying to get us
money for the trip.

210
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:45,351
I realised I'm much more clever
than these other Franks -

211
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,115
so I made them work.

212
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,697
We'll end up somewhere.
I'm not sure, though.

213
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,303
This is a sure thing.

214
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,670
How's business? - Bad.

215
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:10,780
Our only customer was so
drunk we couldn't serve him.

216
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,847
I understand.

217
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,780
Heard anything about Frank?

218
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:22,015
Not since yesterday. Why?
- Just a thought.

219
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,323
Frank!

220
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,663
Bring us water.

221
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:41,578
How are you, Frank?
- Sit down.

222
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:44,304
Thanks!

223
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,680
Nice to see you again, Frank.

224
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,356
How come?

225
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,914
Hi. - Hi.

226
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:30,024
These guys are going to Eira.

227
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:34,789
They've got no place to sleep.
- Did you say Eira?

228
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:39,093
Could they spend the night here?
- Sure, we got room.

229
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:41,033
It's OK.

230
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,525
Where are you going?

231
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,294
I told you.

232
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:22,169
Don't go.
We need a doorman.

233
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,633
Woman, can't you ever
understand?

234
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:19,350
Shit. He wasn't home.

235
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:24,157
I know you and your cars.
You can't fix anything.

236
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:29,800
Just wait. I'll fix you a ride
that'll make your navel quiver.

237
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,664
To Parliament.

238
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,778
Idiot.

239
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,317
We need some
street theatre now.

240
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:43,564
My mate's got cramps.
Would you bring me -

241
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,998
the first-aid kit from that car?
- Sure.

242
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,284
My mate died.
I need this car.

243
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,848
OK.

244
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,702
Some matches and
a plastic bag.

245
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,213
You pay these, I paid the hotel.
- OK, Frank.

246
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,538
That was terrible.

247
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,214
You're right,
we shouldn't do that.

248
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:16,409
They take it all back in
the product prices.

249
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:20,417
Where shall we eat?
- I'm not hungry any more.

250
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,151
I'll take it back.
- For fuck's sake!

251
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,947
It's a terrible sound.

252
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,680
The small crack of
a hard-boiled egg -

253
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:57,189
against the bar counter.

254
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:01,361
When it echoes in the mind
of a hungry man.

255
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,330
His head is a terrible sight, too.

256
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,266
In the shop window
early in the morning.

257
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:14,001
A dust-coloured reflection.

258
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:20,773
But he's not looking
at his own head.

259
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:24,182
Why should he?

260
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:27,848
No, he's dreaming.

261
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,718
Dreaming of some
other head -

262
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:36,228
a calf's head in aspic.

263
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:41,069
Or any other head
good for food.

264
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:45,498
He grinds his teeth -

265
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:50,470
knowing that the world -

266
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:54,348
doesn't give a damn
about him.

267
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,817
Nothing he can do
to the world!

268
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:02,487
He counts his fingers -
one, two, three!

269
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:05,526
One, two, three!

270
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,859
Three days without food!

271
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,837
For three days he's
been telling himself:

272
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:16,438
"This can't go on!"

273
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:19,837
But on and on it goes.

274
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:24,070
Three days, three nights
without food!

275
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:27,842
And behind those windows -

276
00:51:28,052 --> 00:51:31,510
the pastries, bottles, tins.

277
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:36,020
Dead fishes protected by tins, -

278
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:38,854
tins protected by windows, -

279
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:42,089
windows protected by police, -

280
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,632
police protected by fear.

281
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:50,363
Such a barricade for
six wretched sardines!

282
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:14,558
I've reached the end -

283
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,833
of one of
the thousands of paths -

284
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:25,841
that fill my world

285
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:30,072
The evening air is cool

286
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:34,247
Daylight disappears -

287
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:40,584
behind the woods

288
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:45,520
Nothing can die away

289
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:50,366
Not flowers, not the wind

290
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:56,667
Love can't die tonight

291
00:52:58,042 --> 00:53:01,705
My path winds by

292
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,876
And the flowers stay behind

293
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:10,010
Somewhere the wind -

294
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:13,820
plays his song

295
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,024
<i>The moment of love</i> -

296
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:20,624
<i>fades from our eyes</i>

297
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:25,799
<i>I guess it, too,</i>
<i>goes its way</i>

298
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:31,540
<i>The touch of a hand</i>

299
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:35,242
<i>Still true today</i>

300
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:40,809
<i>Goes by like a song...</i>

301
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,543
I want a suit
to match this tie.

302
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:20,610
From my childhood I can only
remember my mother.

303
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,446
She used to slap me gently
with her big hands -

304
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:27,146
before putting me in bath.
- Did you like it?

305
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,348
I don't know.

306
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,629
You feel lonely in water,
especially if it's cold.

307
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,995
It's different if it's warm.

308
00:55:38,202 --> 00:55:41,831
Or what do you say?
- Nothing.

309
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,098
You're doing the talking.

310
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:47,106
Couldn't life go on
without the wind?

311
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:49,711
It makes everything shiver.

312
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,939
All you see are
unimportant things.

313
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:57,484
Still we shiver.
I wonder why?

314
00:55:58,222 --> 00:56:01,123
I am feeling sad, too.

315
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:04,294
We all feel it in our throat.

316
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:09,689
You know, although I'm still
young I used to be younger.

317
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,336
So did my friends.
I call them my friends -

318
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,869
even though they've
rejected me.

319
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,839
Already then, we were
tormented by fear.

320
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,304
They could've used our fear.

321
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:27,415
Telling us:
"This is it, we'll bury you!"

322
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:32,018
And so we were afraid
to run too fast.

323
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:37,421
What if we'd found ourselves
by an open grave, breathless.

324
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:42,354
Breathless, we would've
realised that we wouldn't -

325
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:46,696
have been able to say
anything, no breath.

326
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,665
They don't know how to teach
one to feel the vibes here.

327
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:54,207
We don't know the rules.

328
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,507
It must be the Time.

329
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:05,085
We should get ahead
of the Time.

330
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,357
Nobody likes me.

331
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:11,220
Everybody scorns me
and despises me.

332
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,521
They only tolerate me -

333
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,528
because my parents
are fairly rich.

334
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,930
I've got myself friends
by bribing them -

335
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:23,197
with candy and later,
alcohol.

336
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:25,871
But they still make fun of me.

337
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:30,775
"Go home Frank,
eat your porridge."

338
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:35,881
What should I do?

339
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,582
Kill yourself!

340
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,797
Hi, Frank!

341
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:32,130
Who's he?

342
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:37,507
Never seen him.
Let's do business.

343
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:45,378
There you are.
- Thank you. The bill, please.

344
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:23,318
Hey, fella...

345
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,899
What are you doing here?

346
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:44,301
Begging money for
a new <i>Mercedes-Benz.</i>

347
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:51,637
Yeah, they stole
the other one. - Yeah.

348
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:57,580
We'll help.
Anybody got money?

349
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:02,080
No, don't.
- Really, we want to help.

350
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,317
Please, don't.

351
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:09,659
But give me a cigarette.
- I haven't any! Honestly!

352
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:12,858
Give me that, then.

353
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:21,043
Thanks.

354
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:30,686
Take care.
- You, too.

355
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:45,195
Fuck...

356
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:24,765
Here you are.

357
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,996
That's him.

358
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,334
Son of a bitch!
Let's go.

359
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:52,091
<i>Bad boys are coming</i>
<i>to break all your toys</i>

360
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:58,529
<i>Bad boys are coming</i>
<i>to smash your plastic nose</i>

361
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:05,432
<i>Little girls cry when</i>
<i>boys tease them too much</i>

362
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:12,445
<i>If you go and tell your mother</i>
<i>I'll take you anytime</i>

363
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:16,811
<i>'Cause I'm a bad, bad,</i>
<i>very bad boy</i>

364
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:19,485
<i>And I won't be your toy</i>

365
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:24,885
<i>I'm a bad, bad, very bad boy</i>
<i>and I won't be your toy</i>

366
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:31,898
<i>It's gettin' too hot</i>
<i>so you take off your clothes</i>

367
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:38,574
<i>You come with me</i>
<i>I don't tease you no more</i>

368
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:45,147
<i>If you go and tell your mother</i>
<i>I'll take you anytime</i>

369
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:52,379
<i>Get In bed, hide under covers</i>
<i>with your teddy bear</i>

370
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:55,884
<i>'Cause I'm a bad, bad,</i>
<i>very bad boy</i>

371
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,922
<i>And I won't be your toy</i>

372
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:06,001
<i>I'm a bad, bad, very bad boy</i>
<i>and I won't be your toy</i>

373
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,565
<i>'Cause I'm a bad, bad,</i>
<i>very bad boy</i>

374
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:12,237
<i>And I won't be your toy</i>

375
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:18,210
<i>I'm a bad, bad, very bad boy</i>
<i>and I won't be your toy</i>

376
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,886
<i>Bad boys!</i>

377
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:31,220
<i>B- b-b-bad boys!</i>

378
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,859
<i>B- b-b-bad boys!</i>

379
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:44,536
<i>B- b-b-bad boys!</i>

380
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:47,702
<i>Bad boys</i>

381
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:50,974
<i>Make love</i>

382
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,312
<i>Any time</i>

383
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:57,417
<i>They like</i>

384
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,223
<i>Bad boys</i>

385
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:04,484
<i>Hate</i>

386
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:07,823
<i>Any time</i>

387
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,792
<i>They get the chance</i>

388
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:15,760
<i>'Cause I'm a bad, bad,</i>
<i>very bad boy</i>

389
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:18,472
<i>And I won't be your toy</i>

390
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:24,738
<i>I'm a bad, bad, very bad boy</i>
<i>and I won't be your toy</i>

391
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:31,410
<i>I'm a bad, bad, very bad boy</i>
<i>and I won't be your toy</i>

392
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:37,016
<i>I'm a bad, bad, very bad boy</i>
<i>and I won't be your toy</i>

393
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,607
Hey! You there!

394
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:05,286
Me?
- Yes, you. Come here.

395
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:17,958
What do you want?
- Where are you going?

396
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:20,135
We're all going to Eira.

397
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:23,499
I'll take you there.
I've got a house in Eira.

398
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:27,999
There are no houses in Eira
- yet!

399
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:31,408
Are you coming or not?

400
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:37,509
Can I take my friends with me?
- No.

401
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,592
Wrong direction.

402
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:36,411
I know that woman.
I'll go in.

403
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,612
Don't go, Frank.
- I must.

404
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,083
Don't go, Frank!

405
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:48,914
Hi, Liisa.

406
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:53,392
Liisa, hi!

407
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,666
Liisa?

408
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:01,461
What do you want?

409
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:07,805
Aren't you Liisa from Alabama?
- Don't remind me of that time.

410
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:12,079
How's the little one?
I've had a bad conscience...

411
01:09:13,116 --> 01:09:14,674
You swine!

412
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:17,583
Get out!

413
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,124
I never did tell you that...

414
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:24,856
Girls, come and help!

415
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,856
Damn you!

416
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,197
Let's kill him!

417
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:33,261
Shit! Fuck you...

418
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:39,001
They killed him!
- Dammit!

419
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,144
We're late, Frank.

420
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,619
May I sit here?

421
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:12,628
Who are you?

422
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:15,700
I'm a secretary.

423
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,031
A secretary?

424
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:22,371
What for?

425
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:25,376
Are these guys
your bosses?

426
01:11:26,549 --> 01:11:28,540
You think powdering your nose -

427
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,879
and being a secretary makes
your life better?

428
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:36,882
Can't you understand
I feel pity for you?

429
01:11:37,894 --> 01:11:40,488
You're ruining your life!

430
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:44,559
Every guy from the boss
to the messenger boy-

431
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:47,327
will use you.

432
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:50,738
You're just an object
for them, a door mat.

433
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:54,008
When you get older
and you looks go -

434
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:56,142
you'll get thrown out fast.

435
01:11:56,345 --> 01:12:00,611
Then nothing worthwhile
will happen in your life.

436
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:05,249
You won't be worth foranything,
not even being a mother!

437
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:07,319
Slowly your life will slide...

438
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:59,140
Frank was right.

439
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:03,067
It's better to find a rich woman
than to attempt the impossible.

440
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:06,144
What're you going to do?
- Sell out the gang.

441
01:13:06,349 --> 01:13:08,249
How is it done?

442
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:12,011
A rich academic widow needs
civilised company -

443
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,689
for a trip to Rome.

444
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:24,689
I saw the ad in the paper.
- But you aren't civilised.

445
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:27,529
She doesn't know that.

446
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:30,700
She can see it.

447
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,705
Follow me.

448
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,570
My name is Frank.

449
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,202
Is that so?

450
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:09,537
Well, what do you think?

451
01:17:10,226 --> 01:17:14,390
Winter is coming
and we'll get nowhere.

452
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:18,598
We'll die -

453
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:22,664
of hunger and cold.

454
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:33,637
Back home one didn't quit.

455
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:38,818
Let's try once more, Frank.

456
01:17:42,525 --> 01:17:45,961
Mother will forgive us.

457
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:20,120
Something's wrong, Frank.

458
01:18:20,496 --> 01:18:22,521
Shut up, Frank!

459
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:04,236
Shit!
We've been tricked!

460
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:11,044
No, we only came too late.

461
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:14,011
Years too late.

462
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:22,022
I'm not staying here.

463
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:26,022
Where are you going?
- To Estonia!

464
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:29,857
Take me with you!
- There isn't room for two.

465
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:33,432
Then I'm taking it.
- Is that what you think?

466
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:51,043
Don't do it, Frank!

467
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,318
Just don't whine.

468
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:02,553
<i>When the warm</i>
<i>springtime sun</i>

469
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:06,834
<i>Breaks the bonds</i>
<i>of ice and snow</i>

470
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:11,330
<i>Then small white anemones</i>

471
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:15,176
<i>Raise their tiny</i>
<i>little heads</i>

472
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:18,910
<i>And on their mossy bed</i>

473
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:23,411
<i>They sit listening to the tale</i>

474
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:30,789
<i>The forest wind hums</i>
<i>In the trees</i>

475
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:36,492
<i>It tells them</i>
<i>a story of little -

476
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:40,762
<i>fairies dancing</i>
<i>by the spring...</i>

477
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:51,672
The End
