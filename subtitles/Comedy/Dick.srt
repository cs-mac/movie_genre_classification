{1293}{1377}In 1974, President Richard Nixon|resigned in disgrace...
{1383}{1419}...amid the Watergate scandal.
{1425}{1478}One of the mysteries|of the 20th century...
{1483}{1533}...pertains to the identity|of Deep Throat...
{1539}{1633}... the inside source who leaked the|information to The Washington Post.
{1639}{1695}Who is Deep Throat?
{1700}{1752}Tonight, my guests will|answer that question.
{1758}{1788}Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein...
{1794}{1869}...Post reporters who broke|the story so many years ago.
{1877}{1950}-Nice to have you here.|-Thank you for having us.
{1960}{1999}Let's just get right to it.
{2005}{2035}Who is...
{2040}{2068}...Deep Throat?
{2105}{2167}Well, first of all,|we're not telling you.
{2232}{2333}Second, I was under the impression|that I would be the only guest tonight.
{2339}{2380}Well, I guess you're not, Bob.
{2420}{2479}You know, you guys|are getting pretty old now.
{2485}{2517}So what's your point?
{2523}{2599}I'm wondering, are you ever|going to tell anybody...
{2605}{2636}... who Deep Throat is...
{2642}{2673}...before you die?
{2679}{2736}Well, a lot bigger names than you...
{2742}{2785}...have asked us|who Deep Throat is, so....
{2791}{2863}I don't think we'd reveal it|on a little show like this.
{2869}{2906}You know what I think?
{2912}{2982}I mean, I'm just gonna|come right out and say it.
{2990}{3088}I don't think there is a Deep Throat.|I think you made it up.
{3094}{3198}-Yes, there is. Deep Throat is--|-Don't say it! He's trying to trick us!
{3254}{3288}I'm sorry, Bob.
{3295}{3326}Don't ever touch me.
{3332}{3385}-Bob, I said I'm sorry.|-Don't ever--
{3394}{3444}You smell like cabbage.
{4384}{4419}Oh, fudge!
{5055}{5091}Dear Bobby:
{5133}{5189}I'm having so much fun already.
{5203}{5245}I need you to concentrate.
{5251}{5287}-Dear Bobby:|-Hold on, hold on.
{5293}{5341}-Here's the number one reason--|-Wait.
{5347}{5434}Arlene, I need to have time|to review my letters.
{5464}{5509}-We have a deadline, Betsy.|-I know.
{5515}{5596}But I need to concentrate.|Let me just look at them.
{5604}{5639}Okay. Dear Bobby:
{5645}{5717}Here's the number one reason|that I think--
{5723}{5770}Okay, I'm ready.
{5795}{5822}"A."
{5862}{5893}Dear Bobby:
{5899}{5999}Here's the number one reason that|I think that you should choose me...
{6005}{6038}...Arlene Lorenzo...
{6044}{6112}...for the "Win A Date|With Bobby Sherman" contest...
{6118}{6177}-...in Tiger Beat magazine.|-Hold on. Wait.
{6183}{6216}Number one: I love you.
{6224}{6284}And number two:|I just think you're cute.
{6293}{6355}B, B. Oh, my God,|they're both together.
{6361}{6473}But the main reason that I think|you should pick me, Arlene Lorenzo...
{6486}{6549}...is because we're soul mates, Bobby.
{6585}{6636}You are so brilliant, Arlene.
{6678}{6722}So what do we have so far?
{6750}{6785}" Dear Bobb...
{6807}{6828}...y:"
{6883}{6944}I think maybe I could type|faster than you.
{6950}{7028}Four more years!|Four more years!
{7109}{7166}-What are you looking at?|-Nothing.
{7210}{7262}You seem pretty interested in nothing.
{7272}{7299}Give me those.
{7500}{7556}I'll take the one doing cartwheels.
{7615}{7646}What time is it?
{7664}{7684}Shit!
{7807}{7854}The gemstone is glistening.
{7860}{7917}The gemstone is glistening.
{8350}{8394}She's finally asleep!
{8402}{8486}The deadline to enter the contest|is midnight. We have to hurry.
{8507}{8558}We have to mail this letter. Go...
{8564}{8620}...so I can win,|or I swear I'll die.
{8773}{8818}-Evening, Mr. Whipple.|-Evening.
{8824}{8874}Don't squeeze the Charmin.
{8900}{8929}-Hi, Dad.|-Hi, Georgie.
{8935}{9006}-Can I carry the Charmin?|-Yep, but no squeezing.
{9012}{9054}What did you do in the store today?
{9064}{9103}You should've seen it.
{9109}{9186}There I was, and these two ladies|were squeezing the Charmin.
{9309}{9399}This way, we can get back in|without having to go to the lobby.
{9407}{9462}So nobody'll ever see us|and tell my mom.
{9537}{9575}You're a genius!
{10144}{10172}Down, down!
{10179}{10211}It's Fat Freddy.
{10379}{10427}That is so disgusting.
{10448}{10483}Go, go, go!
{11010}{11038}What the--?
{11087}{11114}Oh, shit!
{11155}{11231}Max, call the cops.|Looks like we got a break-in here.
{11263}{11306}You know why I love Bobby?
{11312}{11393}Because he cares about people,|but also about nature and ecology.
{11405}{11491}I need a status report.|Give me a 20 for gemstone. Over.
{11514}{11536}Jewel thieves!
{11543}{11566}Really?
{11590}{11622}Hold it!
{11707}{11742}Get away from us!
{11794}{11862}Young people running wild|in the middle of the night.
{11918}{12014}By the time you're grown, you'll be|living in the Soviet Union of America!
{12269}{12306}She's still out like a light.
{12527}{12582}We have the suspects in custody!
{12590}{12644}It was a jewel heist.
{12650}{12707}See if you can get|any statements from them.
{12798}{12824}Arlene?
{12831}{12858}Betsy?
{12866}{12918}What are you two doing up at this hour?
{12979}{13015}Nothing.
{13032}{13122}Last night, five men were arrested|in the Democratic Committee office...
{13128}{13192}... during an attempted burglary|at the Watergate complex.
{13198}{13227}It has been confirmed...
{13233}{13322}... that one of the arrested was|formerly an employee of the CIA.
{13340}{13390}Aren't you students excited...
{13396}{13505}...about visiting the home of|the President and the first family?
{13511}{13556}Well, not really.
{13562}{13671}And after our tour,|we're having lunch at McDonald's.
{13744}{13786}I love McDonald's so much!
{13792}{13846}French fries! French fries!
{13974}{14031}He looks like he's wearing blush.
{14209}{14259}That guy has T.P. stuck to his shoe.
{14273}{14300}Hey, mister!
{14327}{14374}-Hey, you!|-Shorty, turn around.
{14403}{14449}Young lady, I am a very busy man.
{14455}{14485}Wait a minute, I know you.
{14491}{14541}Me too. But from where?
{14547}{14576}I don't know.
{14582}{14628}Do you sell corn dogs at the mall?
{14634}{14730}As far as you're concerned,|I have no identity at all.
{14738}{14774}As a matter of fact...
{14787}{14827}...l'm not even here.
{14854}{14908}He's way weirder than the corn-dog guy.
{14959}{14997}And this isn't T.P.
{15003}{15084}It's a piece of paper with names|and amounts of money on it.
{15103}{15139}" CREEP list"?
{15150}{15231}I guess all the people|on that list must be creeps.
{15254}{15283}Souvenir.
{15306}{15338}Let's go.
{15472}{15528}Jesus, Gordon, they're just|little girls.
{15544}{15641}They were in the Watergate last night.|They know too much, Bob.
{15673}{15732}I want to interrogate them.
{15765}{15866}I think you've done enough,|what with bumbling the burglary and all.
{15875}{15934}Just pay off all your guys|on that CREEP list.
{15940}{16008}Don't worry about that.|I've got that right here.
{16015}{16124}G. Gordon Liddy isn't going to let down|the President of the United States.
{16182}{16266}Would you ladies like to see|the west wing of the White House?
{16486}{16513}Sorry.
{16577}{16611}This is fun.
{16648}{16691}Look at that b--
{16774}{16800}Ladies...
{16824}{16879}...when you think of your President...
{16889}{16919}...do you think...
{16927}{16971}...friendly thoughts?
{17063}{17110}I don't think about him that much.
{17116}{17158}But when you do...
{17181}{17216}...you don't think...
{17223}{17261}...unfriendly thoughts, do you?
{17343}{17422}So you would never want|to do anything that might...
{17427}{17456}...hurt...
{17462}{17482}...the President?
{17488}{17528}Never. No.
{17540}{17566}Because you see--
{17622}{17671}Excuse me, Mr. Haldeman.
{17677}{17750}It's your wife.|She says it's rather urgent.
{17842}{17883}Excuse me, ladies.
{18018}{18046}Hello, dear.
{18090}{18144}Just putting out a little fire here.
{18159}{18212}I can stop by the store|on the way home.
{18227}{18269}A dozen? The poppy kind.
{18275}{18359}I'll tell you the problem.|The dog doesn't like me.
{18370}{18474}Kennedy and Johnson had dogs|that liked them. That's the problem.
{18480}{18578}Mr. President, maybe you should|show the dog more affection.
{18583}{18633}Maybe I ought to fire you!
{18665}{18699}Come on, boy.
{18733}{18778}Looks away. Doesn't look at me.
{18783}{18819}What'd I do to him? Nothing.
{18825}{18880}You're supposed to love me, Checkers.
{18885}{18955}Shouldn't you call him|King Timahoe, sir?
{19026}{19046}Come here.
{19060}{19091}Where's he going?
{19140}{19187}No, I am not uptight.
{19195}{19254}When did you start|talking like that, anyway?
{19279}{19322}What's going on in here?
{19393}{19424}Mr. President, if I may.
{19430}{19471}Look how cute you are.|Come here.
{19524}{19549}It's the President.
{19555}{19662}I mean, all I asked for|was a simple bugging, all right?
{19668}{19715}I don't know how many times|we've done that.
{19721}{19772}And here they go and screw it up.
{19796}{19853}Hi, puppy. Nice puppy!
{19859}{19889}Nice puppy!
{19919}{19956}Have you paid them off yet?
{19961}{20012}CREEP has made up|a list of who to pay off...
{20018}{20063}...and Liddy's taking care of it now.
{20140}{20190}Are you the President's dog trainer?
{20197}{20277}I'm John Dean,|Chief White House Counsel.
{20322}{20357}That's too bad.
{20412}{20433}Oh, thank you!
{20439}{20475}That one lives in the Watergate.
{20481}{20533}They were there|the night of the break-in.
{20538}{20562}Do they know anything?
{20568}{20624}I love your ears.|Look at the ears!
{20632}{20721}Sir, I've met yams with more going|on upstairs than those two.
{20727}{20755}Now, Bob.
{20775}{20820}I remember when...
{20827}{20883}...when Julie...
{20898}{20942}...and what's her name, Tricia...
{20950}{20989}...were that age.
{20995}{21110}If it wasn't about makeup or|Frankie Avalon, they didn't give a hoot.
{21144}{21218}-You're the softest dog.|-What should I do with them?
{21239}{21278}I'll take care of it.
{21350}{21399}How're you doing, young ladies?
{21405}{21441}What are your names?
{21450}{21509}I'm Betsy and this is Arlene,|Mr. President.
{21515}{21550}Call me Dick.
{21563}{21588}Hi, Dick.
{21594}{21618}How old are you?
{21625}{21654}Fifteen.
{21672}{21756}We have an urgent communiqué|from Anderson Air Force Base.
{21761}{21785}What?
{21791}{21820}So cute.
{21832}{21925}Excuse me, I wasn't informed|that you are in the middle of....
{21935}{21977}What are you in the middle of?
{21983}{22022}One minute, Henry.
{22032}{22062}Young ladies...
{22084}{22140}...l've got a proposition for you.
{22163}{22223}How would you two|be interested in being...
{22228}{22318}...official White House dog walkers?|What do you think?
{22370}{22395}Really?
{22433}{22465}Jesus!
{22475}{22515}Who are these little girls?
{22521}{22581}I don't know, but it doesn't|look constitutional to me.
{22587}{22608}Thank you!
{22614}{22678}-Thank you so much.|-We're gonna walk you!
{22684}{22749}-I'm so happy.|-Thank you. I'm really excited!
{22755}{22793}Sure. Very good.
{22804}{22871}Mr. President, really,|we have to make a decision...
{22877}{22961}...regarding offensive action|north of the 22nd parallel.
{22967}{23009}Bottom line, Henry...
{23015}{23079}...is we bomb them|or we don't, isn't it?
{23085}{23127}I wouldn't put it exactly in that--
{23142}{23173}I have something to say.
{23179}{23203}Go on, Arlene.
{23242}{23334}War is not healthy for children|and other living things.
{23370}{23446}Henry, that's the voice|of the youth of America.
{23465}{23507}Yeah, well, first of all...
{23512}{23579}...it wasn't a war|that this administration started.
{23592}{23653}Henry, Jesus, let's not start that.
{23658}{23710}Isn't there somebody|waiting out there for me?
{23716}{23761}The Joint Chiefs of Staff.|Let's go!
{23767}{23827}Welcome on board.|Hey, good to have you.
{23846}{23890}Mr. Haldeman, it's your wife.
{23896}{23949}Have a great day. Congratulations!
{23955}{24001}I don't have time to talk to her.
{24007}{24089}-You're starting another war!|-I don't have time to talk to her.
{24095}{24166}If you have a problem with Vietnam,|talk to Johnson.
{24172}{24224}-He's dead!|-Yeah, thank God.
{24230}{24314}Do we bomb or not bomb?|Let's get this done with today.
{24495}{24535}There they are.
{24642}{24669}I'm sorry!
{24675}{24717}We're coming!
{24750}{24809}Because of your thoughtlessness...
{24815}{24882}...we have missed the field trip lunch|at McDonald's...
{24888}{24979}...which the students on|the other buses are now enjoying.
{24985}{25025}We will return to school...
{25031}{25083}...for a cold lunch...
{25094}{25125}...in the cafeteria.
{25147}{25218}But we really did meet the President.|I swear to God.
{25223}{25307}And he did ask us to be|the official White House dog walkers.
{25377}{25432}Every lie is another brick...
{25440}{25511}...in the pathway to hell.
{25840}{25879}You're so stupid.
{25903}{25940}I hate you.
{26963}{27016}Guess what happened to us today!
{27119}{27144}What's the matter?
{27154}{27210}Your brother got his letter.
{27237}{27282}I got drafted.
{27295}{27368}Now you can get my room,|like you always wanted.
{27645}{27683}Betsy, are you okay?
{27765}{27794}I'm fine.
{27818}{27917}I was wondering what we'll do with|his crappy bed, dresser and nightstand.
{27983}{28054}You think the President meant it|when he said we could walk Checkers?
{28054}{28064}You think the President meant it|when he said we could walk Checkers?
{28069}{28139}He's the President, Betsy.|He always means what he says.
{28145}{28184}We should bake him cookies.
{28193}{28269}Let's make Hello Dollies.|It's my mom's special recipe.
{28429}{28523}All's my mom says is that my dad died|in a car crash before I was born.
{28528}{28589}You've never seen|a single picture or anything?
{28594}{28674}She said it upset her too much,|so she threw everything away.
{28717}{28792}No offense, but it's obvious|you're being lied to.
{28797}{28846}The whole story is way too convenient.
{28914}{28953}Is the butter melting?
{29004}{29039}Are you making those cookies?
{29049}{29084}Yes, but you can't have any.
{29090}{29130}They're for the President.
{29212}{29270}Don't forget the walnuts, man.
{29409}{29474}So you really think|that my father could be alive?
{29481}{29552}Alive and famous.|It makes perfect sense.
{29557}{29589}He was probably married...
{29594}{29677}...and your mom had to keep it|a secret to protect his reputation.
{29765}{29825}How come there's little|green leaves in the walnuts?
{29833}{29886}Larry says they're just|from the walnut tree.
{29892}{29924}Anyway...
{29930}{30003}...your dad could be watching you now,|his heart breaking...
{30009}{30112}...because he can't reach out|to the only person that matters to him:
{30117}{30167}His beautiful, darling daughter.
{30172}{30224}My life is so tragic.
{30240}{30291}Or it could be even worse.
{30297}{30361}What if you fall in love|and are about to marry...
{30367}{30428}...and you find out your|fiancé's dad is your dad too...
{30434}{30473}...and that you're brother and sister!
{30480}{30510}Oh, my God!
{30534}{30580}It's called incest, Arlene...
{30591}{30636}...and it's against the law.
{30927}{31003}We're here to play with Checkers.|The President knows about it.
{31009}{31073}You're not on the appointment list.|Please step back.
{31103}{31178}The President wants us|to walk his dog, Checkers.
{31192}{31277}Please step back.|If you don't comply, you'll be removed.
{31353}{31392}You are a meanie!
{31497}{31525}Stupid kids.
{31563}{31609}I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!
{31624}{31693}I can't believe|I ate that whole thing.
{31698}{31731}You ate it, Ralph.
{31818}{31922}Doesn't anybody realize|that Kung Fu isn't Chinese?
{31955}{32036}He doesn't even look Chinese.|He looks like the mailman.
{32064}{32129}Why don't you go to Canada|like Mom says?
{32135}{32233}Too much information's coming in.|I have to maintain.
{32243}{32282}But the old drugs aren't working.
{32295}{32350}We need to create new drugs.
{32423}{32478}Have you guys|been eating those cookies?
{32484}{32534}We gave them to Mom and Dad to taste.
{32540}{32619}They ate all of them|and started giggling and went upstairs.
{32625}{32659}I think they're having sex now.
{32857}{32877}I have an idea.
{32892}{32912}What?
{32928}{32977}Let's ask the President|to stop the war.
{33052}{33091}How will we get|into the White House?
{33097}{33181}Unless you wanna keep the war going,|so you can have Larry's room.
{33267}{33315}Larry's a freak and all...
{33324}{33390}...but I'd be sad if he, you know....
{33431}{33452}Died?
{33536}{33580}I really hope that this works.
{33586}{33606}Of course it will.
{33612}{33664}You're the smartest person I know.
{33708}{33749}But you don't know anybody.
{34067}{34097}If you flirt with him...
{34103}{34192}...then I can stand off to the side|and do my special whistle.
{34746}{34816}I like your hair.|It's really dry look.
{34918}{34954}Okay, stop that.
{34960}{35009}We have to talk to the President.
{35020}{35048}Code yellow, central corridor.
{35054}{35105}Code yellow, central corridor.
{35129}{35150}Oh, my God!
{35175}{35213}Ladies, this way.
{35240}{35264}Let's go.
{35298}{35364}Make sure photographers are|outside the restaurant...
{35370}{35405}...when I come out after lunch.
{35462}{35509}Hey, German guy!|Remember us?
{35519}{35584}We're here to walk Checkers|and talk to Dick about the war!
{35633}{35662}I know them.
{35672}{35724}Yes, that's all right.|That's okay.
{35729}{35784}I'm familiar with these young ladies.
{35789}{35863}Well, I'm not "familiar" familiar.|I know them.
{35869}{35951}We've had discussions|about foreign policy and....
{35957}{36008}What, what?|Don't you give me that look.
{36027}{36059}I'll take responsibility.
{36065}{36116}I'll be the only person|who's willing...
{36122}{36159}...to take responsibility|for anything.
{36165}{36228}-I think I got bruised.|-Did somebody hurt you?
{36260}{36331}You have to remember|it took Charles de Gaulle...
{36337}{36409}...four years to extricate|himself from Algeria.
{36415}{36474}Not that I'm comparing|myself to de Gaulle.
{36480}{36542}-Wars are extremely hard to stop.|-You're right.
{36547}{36612}Rose, these young--|You're very becoming this morning.
{36617}{36663}These ladies want|to see the President.
{36668}{36762}Our President has the weight|of the free world on his shoulders...
{36767}{36827}...and he doesn't have time|to see any old person.
{36860}{36880}Hello, girls.
{36886}{36917}How are you?
{36923}{36943}Come on in.
{36948}{36998}The President will see you now.
{37036}{37085}Not you, Henry.
{37091}{37154}That's all right.|I'm late for an interview anyway...
{37170}{37238}-...with the Nobel Committee.|-Right.
{37263}{37304}I'll be a monkey's uncle...
{37309}{37388}...if these aren't|the yummiest cookies I've ever had.
{37416}{37481}Thanks. It's a secret recipe.
{37492}{37515}Secret, eh?
{37525}{37548}Anyway...
{37575}{37629}...there doesn't seem|to be any point to it.
{37637}{37668}Point to what?
{37694}{37717}The war.
{37814}{37848}See, girls...
{37866}{37972}...we're fighting the Communists|because Communism is immoral.
{37978}{38016}That's the whole point.
{38034}{38099}Don't you think it's more important|what's going on here?
{38105}{38130}What do you mean?
{38148}{38197}Well, I mean...
{38202}{38257}...nobody at our school's|worried about Communism...
{38263}{38354}...but everybody talks about Mac|Washington because he got killed there.
{38360}{38433}-And Betsy's brother just got drafted.|-He's maintaining.
{38439}{38469}He's maintaining?
{38500}{38525}Good for him.
{38555}{38634}I think people would like you|better if you stopped the war.
{38640}{38728}Well, don't worry your|pretty little heads. Okay?
{38734}{38786}I think we know what we're doing.
{38835}{38864}I guess so.
{38985}{39011}Can we walk Checkers now?
{39018}{39066}Yeah, go ahead. Have a ball.
{39087}{39122}Secret recipe, eh?
{39147}{39187}I'm feeling lightheaded.
{39212}{39258}These are scrumptious.
{39274}{39343}I've gotta tell you,|I haven't felt this way in--
{39662}{39723}Again? They must never let him out.
{39732}{39793}I know. Would you look|at all that shit?
{39805}{39849}Oh, I mean, poo-poo.
{39910}{39960}I think it was left.
{40006}{40064}That's because you couldn't go right.
{40183}{40221}Well, let's ask someone.
{40296}{40324}Or not.
{40340}{40360}Come on.
{40366}{40412}Let's go, Checkers. Come on.
{40531}{40573}Who the hell are you?
{40602}{40694}We're walking the dog, Checkers,|and we sort of got lost.
{40699}{40748}We went left because|you couldn't go right.
{40754}{40815}And we're looking|for the President's office...
{40821}{40887}...because that's who|we walk the dog for.
{40892}{40918}We're really sorry.
{40924}{40944}Shit!
{41079}{41105}Oh, I'm so sorry.
{41111}{41188}-We brought your dog back.|-We didn't know!
{41194}{41235}What in bejesus is going on?
{41387}{41419}All right, settle down.
{41427}{41468}What's going on, Bob?
{41473}{41514}They walked in on the shredding.
{41537}{41608}They actually saw|documents being shredded?
{41633}{41689}And the cash for the payoffs.
{41727}{41771}Checkers pooped.
{41794}{41887}The President's dog doesn't poop.|He "does his business."
{41934}{41966}I'll take care of it.
{41974}{42053}I've got a way with young people.|They trust me.
{42078}{42132}Why were they shredding all that paper?
{42154}{42229}Papier-mâché is a hobby of mine.
{42259}{42306}Nice painting of a boat.
{42319}{42358}Step right here, actually.
{42389}{42466}I want to have a little|private chat with you.
{42475}{42497}You know, today...
{42502}{42619}...you ladies gave me some very, very|good counsel in foreign affairs.
{42625}{42739}So in addition to being|official dog walkers...
{42745}{42839}...l'd like you to be|my Secret Youth Advisers.
{42844}{42904}Which means you mustn't|say a thing...
{42910}{42984}...about anything that happens|in the White House.
{42990}{43033}Do I have your word on that?
{43073}{43109}Swear to God?
{43119}{43146}-Promise.|-Hope to die?
{43155}{43205}Stick a needle in my eye!
{43242}{43282}Congratulations.
{43415}{43469}Are you sure, man?|Are we sure it's over?
{43475}{43501}Honey...
{43507}{43602}...it's the President.|He's on national TV.
{43607}{43707}If he says the war is over,|I think you can believe him.
{43740}{43768}Sweetie.
{43775}{43844}At 12.:30 Paris-time today...
{43850}{43932}...January 23, 1973....
{43957}{43995}What's going on?
{44039}{44080}I'm gonna live.
{44091}{44162}They're pulling everybody out|of Vietnam. The war's over.
{44185}{44222}I don't believe it.
{44243}{44272}She's bumming...
{44277}{44357}...because her dreams|of being an only child are dashed.
{44367}{44407}Larry, stop it.
{44447}{44485}I'm not supposed to tell you this.
{44505}{44594}But Arlene and I are the ones who asked|the President to stop the war.
{44612}{44665}We did it because|we felt sorry for you.
{44689}{44728}You should be thanking me.
{44785}{44828}I just want you to know...
{44834}{44894}...whatever she's on,|I didn't give it to her.
{44959}{45023}Well, all right.|Grooving right along.
{45033}{45122}Betsy Jobs, your turn|to come on up and express yourself.
{45318}{45354}Current events.
{45414}{45511}I probably shouldn't be telling you|this because of national security...
{45540}{45572}...but what the heck.
{45582}{45636}Arlene Lorenzo and l...
{45651}{45716}...are Secret Youth Advisers|for President Nixon.
{45730}{45806}"--in addition to being|the official White House dog walkers.
{45812}{45874}It's fun being|a Secret Youth Adviser.
{45881}{45944}The President trusts us|with national issues."
{45950}{46007}We bake him cookies|called Hello Dollies...
{46013}{46065}...that he loves|and are easy to make.
{46072}{46161}You get graham cracker crumbs,|sweetened condensed milk...
{46167}{46228}...and all this other stuff,|and you bake them.
{46234}{46286}But they're really good.
{46292}{46357}" I like being a Secret Youth Adviser|to the President...
{46363}{46446}...because it means I am helping|to run the country. The end."
{46509}{46564}How dare you...
{46572}{46628}...come up in front of the class...
{46639}{46721}...and make up lies|about our President?
{46732}{46795}Absolutely wild.
{46810}{46920}And I really dug the way|you used fantasy...
{46925}{46949}...current events...
{46955}{47061}...and cooking in a kind|of tapestry of storytelling.
{47072}{47103}Thank you, Betsy.
{47109}{47179}That was real special.|Thank you. Give her a hand.
{47186}{47221}Thank you. Thanks.
{47367}{47403}Got the cookies?
{47711}{47763}I've been dreaming about these.
{47889}{47913}What's that mean?
{47939}{47963}Peace.
{47983}{48006}Good.
{48019}{48054}I mean...
{48066}{48094}...groovy.
{48162}{48189}Come on, Checkers.
{49941}{50002}There's something different about you.
{50019}{50065}Why aren't you wearing your glasses?
{50071}{50118}Because I got contact lenses.
{50263}{50311}-Looks cool!|-Thanks!
{50335}{50356}Hi, Rose.
{50362}{50426}It is imperative|that we put a freeze...
{50432}{50503}...on nuclear weapons|of mass destruction.
{50557}{50629}Yeah, I know what nyet, nyet means.
{50645}{50694}Excuse me a moment, Leonid.
{50765}{50813}Settle down, Checkers.
{50831}{50875}Hello, girls. How are you?
{50881}{50928}Are these what I think they are?
{50975}{50997}Nice to see you.
{51047}{51115}You gotta try one of these cookies.
{51125}{51231}I assure you, there's nothing|like them in all the Soviet Union.
{51252}{51281}Go ahead.
{51354}{51403}They're called Hello Dollies.
{51555}{51583}What are they?
{51622}{51664}What do you think, Leonid?
{51738}{51774}Hello Dollies, eh?
{51889}{51946}Hello, Dolly
{51953}{52026}Well, hello, Dolly
{52032}{52141}It's so nice to have you back|Where you belong
{52194}{52222}Sing something.
{52228}{52322}You're looking swell, Dolly|I can tell, Dolly
{52344}{52442}You're still glowing|You're still growing
{52448}{52522}You're still going strong
{52620}{52643}You know, girls...
{52649}{52716}...l think your cookies|have just saved the world...
{52722}{52779}...from nuclear catastrophe.
{52859}{52917}There you go, Leonid.|Hello, Dolly.
{52930}{53007}Golly gee, fellas
{53013}{53098}I'll have another of those
{54204}{54255}Come away with me.
{54275}{54316}But what about Pat?
{54324}{54370}She understands.
{56572}{56604}Arlene, watch out!
{56708}{56759}Oh, my God!|Are you all right?
{56768}{56825}Quick, tell me what your name is!
{56845}{56888}Rhoda Morgenstern.
{56949}{56999}I am so embarrassed.
{57015}{57084}-I don't think anyone saw.|-Freak!
{57341}{57396}Has something been|on your mind lately?
{57465}{57512}There isn't some deep feeling...
{57518}{57585}...you need to confess|to your best and only friend?
{57591}{57620}What are you talking about?
{57626}{57667}-Just say it!|-Say what?
{57673}{57717}Just say it, because I already know!
{57723}{57773}All right, I love Dick!
{57987}{58072}This is everything about him and us|since we first met.
{58127}{58172}Here's me as his wife.
{58182}{58240}-It looks so real.|-Thank you.
{58298}{58369}-This is cartoon Dick.|-It's cute. I like that one.
{58395}{58446}This is our White House souvenir.
{58470}{58528}Look, I found these|old magazine clippings...
{58534}{58587}...with stuff about him|when he was young.
{58596}{58622}Look.
{58643}{58707}He's way more distinguished now.
{58750}{58844}A jury today convicted|G. Gordon Liddy and James McCord...
{58850}{58939}... of eight counts, including burglary,|in the Watergate break-in.
{58945}{59018}Enough already.|I am sick of Watergate.
{59024}{59075}And I am sick|of Woodward and Bernstein.
{59102}{59122}Who are they?
{59127}{59174}Snot-nosed|Washington Post reporters...
{59180}{59234}...who are trying|to disgrace the President.
{59240}{59279}Anybody want some more Jell-O?
{59286}{59316}Yes, please. Here.
{59332}{59354}Betsy, look.
{59360}{59396}One more question, Mr. Liddy.
{59411}{59507}-The White House denied involvement.|-He's so familiar.
{59532}{59570}It's that weird guy!
{59585}{59650}-What was he doing at the White House?|-I don't know.
{59691}{59729}Done! We're going upstairs.
{59742}{59805}A spokesman for|the administration once again...
{59811}{59890}... denied any participation|in the Watergate burglary.
{59896}{59982}President Nixon is said to be|in seclusion with advisers.
{60039}{60079}It's starting.
{60224}{60262}Goddamn it!
{60374}{60418}Mr. President, this is Arlene.
{60478}{60544}-Hello, Arlene.|-I'm not waking you, am l?
{60552}{60595}I'm a night owl.
{60612}{60659}What's the deal with|that Watergate thing?
{60665}{60709}Do you know anything about it?
{60779}{60860}No, no, absolutely nothing.|I don't know a thing.
{60866}{60911}No way, José!
{60917}{60960}Because I live in the Watergate...
{60968}{61048}...and one time we saw|that Liddy guy there...
{61055}{61153}...then we saw him at the White House,|and now he's gonna go to jail.
{61241}{61299}Is there something|I can do for you...
{61305}{61343}... or your family?
{61379}{61448}There must be something you desire.
{61505}{61549}I have to go now. Good night.
{61615}{61654}My sweet prince.
{61660}{61698}I think he's a vampire.
{61713}{61770}But he doesn't even have a tuxedo.
{61784}{61848}Oh, Myrna, you are something.
{61854}{61897}You are really something.
{62044}{62110}Pat, will you stop snoring,|goddamn it!
{62116}{62173}My head is about to explode!
{62227}{62274}So you're the President's lawyer?
{62388}{62438}Why does the President need a lawyer?
{62528}{62589}Good question. I just....
{62641}{62661}I don't know.
{62768}{62817}-It's you two.|-Mr. President.
{62823}{62902}The Attorney General is|waiting upstairs, sir.
{62908}{62933}Didn't I fire him?
{62939}{62972}It's the new one, sir.
{63242}{63302}-We're here to walk Checkers.|-Oh, my goodness!
{63308}{63418}I'm so busy that I sometimes forget|about the rest of God's creatures.
{63460}{63527}Here. I'll be back after lunch.
{63855}{63884}Look.
{63890}{63941}We should leave a message for Dick.
{63948}{63980}Like what?
{64116}{64181}I think it's time|you told him how you feel.
{64235}{64261}I can't.
{64267}{64345}Maybe he loves you too, but he|doesn't think you're interested.
{64436}{64487}If you care for him at all...
{64503}{64537}...you'll tell him.
{64620}{64674}Okay, you just have to go first.
{64902}{64933}Hi, Mr. President!
{64941}{64986}This is Betsy and Arlene.
{64991}{65092}We wanted to thank you for letting us|be your Secret Youth Advisers...
{65100}{65178}...and for letting us walk Checkers...
{65183}{65214}...and for....
{65280}{65301}Well....
{65308}{65366}I don't know what else for,|so here's Arlene.
{65372}{65447}She has something|very personal to tell you.
{65508}{65540}I love you.
{65653}{65730}I know that you have a lot|of things on your mind...
{65736}{65789}...because you're|the President and all.
{65853}{65920}But I can't keep my feelings|inside any longer.
{65928}{65978}I've never felt this way|about anyone...
{65984}{66037}...not even about Bobby Sherman,|who I adore...
{66043}{66115}...but now I realize that|that was just puppy love...
{66127}{66159}...and this is the real thing.
{66165}{66208}Hey, Checkers. Hi, sweetie.
{66214}{66302}I realize you're married and that|we can never really be together...
{66311}{66342}...but I'll love you forever.
{66348}{66384}Good boy.
{66423}{66450}Poo-poo.
{66470}{66534}There's this song|by Olivia Newton-John...
{66545}{66618}...that I think best describes|the way I feel about you.
{66650}{66692}It goes like this:
{66735}{66783}I love you
{66803}{66861}I honestly love you
{66897}{66966}You don't have to answer
{66977}{67049}I could see it in your eyes
{67060}{67117}But it's coming from my heart
{67123}{67212}And not my head
{67247}{67322}And then there was that time...
{67332}{67385}...when you put your hand|on my shoulder...
{67403}{67499}...and I got this warm,|tingly feeling inside.
{67510}{67587}And I knew, right then,|at that moment--
{67593}{67634}They'll be back soon.
{67640}{67698}You've been on|for 1 8 1 l2 minutes.
{67736}{67782}I have to go now. Goodbye.
{67793}{67838}I can't believe you were|talking that whole time.
{67844}{67882}What did you say?
{67907}{67932}Stuff.
{67944}{67976}It's personal.
{67982}{68024}I want to make sure it recorded.
{68104}{68169}Hunt's link to Colson is a problem.
{68175}{68216}I must've pushed fast-forward.
{68315}{68386}We can arrange for Hunt|to disappear in Latin America.
{68392}{68477}And we could always|un-disappear him if we want to.
{68582}{68625}Get down off of me, Checkers.
{68630}{68686}Get down off of me,|you piece of shit!
{68755}{68861}So let me tell you something.|We are going to use any means.
{68977}{69057}I just don't want this whole|fucking Watergate business...
{69063}{69090}...biting me in the ass!
{69096}{69165}You know the goddamn Jews|are out to get me!
{69302}{69351}I don't think|the President of the U.S....
{69357}{69423}...should be recording|conversations like that.
{69560}{69583}Make it 8:30.
{69589}{69619}Okay, will do.
{69652}{69679}Girls...
{69685}{69730}...did Checkers do his business?
{69779}{69816}-Excellent.|-Good, good.
{69822}{69898}I hope you left me|some of those yummy cookies.
{69912}{69941}Take care.
{69988}{70028}We have to go.
{70086}{70119}Oh, my stars!
{70476}{70517}Sounds very important.
{70556}{70586}It is.
{70627}{70662}Mr. President?
{70682}{70706}What is it, Bob?
{70712}{70775}I was wondering if you had|that package ready for me...
{70781}{70827}...to take home over the weekend?
{70854}{70910}Yeah, the musical tapes.
{70960}{71047}Bob and I are very big fans|of Guy Lombardo.
{71075}{71118}I taped them myself.
{71129}{71156}Let me know what you think.
{71162}{71189}I will, sir.
{71303}{71343}You were saying, Arlene?
{71386}{71452}We don't think you've been|completely honest with us.
{71459}{71557}If this is about|that Watergate nonsense...
{71568}{71605}...let me say once again...
{71611}{71669}...l had nothing to do with it, okay?
{71678}{71761}It's a plot created|by my enemies to disgrace me!
{71767}{71873}Those radical, muckraking bastards,|Woodward and Bernstein...
{71879}{71909}...at The Washington Post!
{71915}{71961}They're the liars here, you know!
{71969}{72042}Always hiding behind|the goddamn First Amendment!
{72050}{72086}Let me tell you something!
{72093}{72167}It won't protect them from me!
{72227}{72292}Actually, it was just about the dog.
{72298}{72355}You act like you like him...
{72360}{72398}...but we don't think you do.
{72433}{72464}What dog?
{72533}{72621}Now that you mention it,|people are talking about Watergate...
{72626}{72659}...and they say you lied.
{72665}{72713}And I'm Jewish.
{72722}{72754}I know.
{72779}{72818}I had you checked out.
{72886}{72971}There's probably more in there|than you know about yourselves.
{73027}{73062}Even grades?
{73070}{73105}Grades...
{73115}{73183}...your parents' income tax returns...
{73203}{73267}...overdue library books.
{73273}{73331}The whole kit and caboodle.
{73401}{73460}Is there stuff|about my father in there?
{73497}{73517}Who was he?
{73523}{73619}A lady's shoe salesman|at Garfinkle's or some such place.
{73625}{73698}Got hit by a garbage truck|at the age of 24.
{73719}{73774}Your mom never said|it was a garbage truck.
{73780}{73852}Strictly small time.|Never amounted to much.
{73955}{74004}Well, at least he wasn't a liar.
{74040}{74081}We heard that tape!
{74088}{74142}-What'd you hear?|-You kick Checkers!
{74147}{74222}And you're prejudiced,|and you have a potty-mouth!
{74227}{74281}You're a bad man!
{74287}{74348}You stinking little idiots,|get out of here!
{74354}{74406}And don't ever come back here again!
{74458}{74512}You don't mess with the big boys!
{74621}{74645}Wait!
{74691}{74749}I would like to apologize|for his actions.
{74755}{74801}He's been under|a lot of stress lately.
{74807}{74888}It's too late. We're not friends|with him anymore, period!
{74894}{74972}And if you stay,|you're just as bad as he is.
{75397}{75426}Wait!
{75448}{75496}It's gonna be okay.
{75501}{75535}I hate Dick!
{75595}{75651}It was stupid of me|to fall in love with Dick.
{75657}{75694}What was I thinking?
{75710}{75770}Dick just disgusts me now.
{75798}{75834}You know, Arlene...
{75864}{75907}...Dick meant a lot to me too.
{75913}{75944}But I've been thinking...
{75952}{76006}...you can't let Dick run your life!
{76117}{76155}Do you mind?
{76170}{76234}We're having a personal conversation.
{77318}{77344}What happened?
{77350}{77427}Larry wasn't at Jake's house.|Larry was at a porno movie.
{77470}{77505}Hi, Daddy!
{77552}{77583}Hi, girls.
{77589}{77609}Would you mind going upstairs|for just a minute?
{77609}{77650}Would you mind going upstairs|for just a minute?
{77727}{77794}I don't understand|the title of that porno movie.
{77928}{77962}" Deep throat" means...
{77968}{78055}...when the woman puts|the man's penis in her mouth.
{78733}{78770}Okay, what now?
{78827}{78863}Prank phone calls?
{78891}{78922}Okay, who?
{78973}{79005}Miss Spinnler?
{79103}{79136}Sean Freshman?
{79163}{79216}No, we always do him.
{79316}{79377}I know, I know! These guys!
{79412}{79462}The " radical, muckraking bastards."
{79468}{79500}Excusez-moi?
{79506}{79590}These are the guys that are writing|all that stuff about Watergate.
{79654}{79703}And this one's kind of hunky.
{79709}{79730}Gross.
{79753}{79805}Well, you liked Dick.
{79949}{79983}Washington Post.
{80002}{80057}I'm the daughter|of the British ambassador...
{80063}{80159}...and I have some very important|information concerning Watergate...
{80165}{80196}...for your newspaper.
{80214}{80246}One moment.
{80263}{80298}I'm on hold!
{80420}{80440}Woodward.
{80459}{80486}I can't. I can't.
{80604}{80633}Who's this?
{80643}{80709}I just told you. Bob Woodward.
{80748}{80769}Good.
{80785}{80821}We know things.
{80827}{80869}What kind of things?
{80905}{80935}About Dick.
{80957}{80989}I mean, the President.
{81029}{81052}On the record?
{81110}{81141}Can I use your name?
{81167}{81214}They don't get that it's a joke!
{81222}{81269}That just makes it funnier.
{81275}{81345}Unless you go on the record|or have documentation....
{81414}{81478}I have deadlines.|This is The Washington Post.
{81485}{81539}A documentation.|Like a piece of paper.
{81580}{81620}We have a piece of paper.
{81626}{81725}Hold on. We have a list of creeps.|We got it at the White House.
{81762}{81799}A list of creeps?
{81819}{81860}C-R-E-E-P.
{81921}{81965}The Committee to Re-elect|the President.
{81971}{82083}It's to Haldeman. It has a list|of names, amounts of money and dates.
{82121}{82166}Go ahead. What do you have?
{82212}{82283}It's Magruder, Barker, Brown....
{82625}{82659}Can I help you?
{82674}{82721}-I'm cool.|-I'm sorry, go ahead.
{82930}{82965}Go away!
{82983}{83007}Right.
{83013}{83076}You actually have this document|in your possession?
{83082}{83127}Yeah, it's sitting right here.
{83145}{83192}But the only problem is that...
{83198}{83312}...we drew all over it, and I dropped|my grilled cheese sandwich on it...
{83318}{83357}...so it's kind of rank.
{83363}{83421}Benji, stop it. Get off!
{83453}{83522}Are you insane?|Or are your pants too tight?
{83534}{83564}Who are you talking to?
{83570}{83656}A source with proof that the Committee|to Re-elect the President...
{83662}{83700}...paid off the Water--
{83714}{83766}Paid off the Watergate burglars.
{83772}{83834}And the White House knows about it.
{83937}{83990}You can't have that conversation|on the phone!
{83996}{84037}It's too dangerous!
{84043}{84083}Arrange a meeting.
{84106}{84140}Ow! That really hurt me.
{84146}{84185}That really hurt me.
{84227}{84253}Could I meet you?
{84261}{84314}We've been too permissive|with you, young man.
{84326}{84391}From now on,|we're watching you like a hawk.
{84409}{84444}Not around here.
{84450}{84503}Right, you're being watched.|I understand.
{84547}{84599}There is an underground|parking garage...
{84599}{84621}There is an underground|parking garage...
{84657}{84734}...on A Street and York Avenue.
{84744}{84772}Across from Garfinkle's.
{84778}{84830}We can go shopping after we meet them.
{84856}{84942}I can meet you there tomorrow at 9 p.m.
{85010}{85034}How will I know you?
{85060}{85115}That's for me to know|and you to find out.
{85219}{85252}What are you staring at?
{85258}{85303}There's yelling.|Are you in trouble?
{85372}{85449}Give me a name, so when you call next,|I'll know it's you.
{85536}{85564}Deep Throat!
{85582}{85608}Deep Throat!
{85639}{85696}Carl Bernstein.|Tell me your story.
{85702}{85732}Up yours, man!
{85777}{85844}Deep Throat! Come here,|Deep Throat boy!
{85923}{85953}They hung up.
{85959}{86002}-What're you doing?|-It's cool.
{86008}{86049}-What are you doing?|-Helping you out.
{86065}{86106}I swear to God...!
{86206}{86241}You're horny!
{86508}{86560}All right, he's not here. Let's go.
{86718}{86761}You're Deep Throat?
{86801}{86836}We both are.
{86842}{86874}How old are you?
{86900}{86926}23.
{86932}{86969}Is that your combined ages?
{87001}{87046}There's no need to be snotty.
{87052}{87128}I'm just trying to imagine here,|what exactly...
{87134}{87193}...is your connection|with the White House?
{87199}{87254}We were the Secret Youth Advisers.
{87260}{87342}And we walked the dog.|And Arlene was in love with Dick.
{87348}{87421}Okay, I don't need to hear|any more of that, really.
{87474}{87498}Were you followed?
{87663}{87718}What are you doing here?
{87724}{87765}I came to make sure|you were all right.
{87771}{87808}You did not!
{87814}{87857}You're trying to horn in on my source.
{87863}{87949}How come you get to meet Deep Throat?|I'm the one who saw that movie.
{87982}{88015}Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein.
{88021}{88094}-You're supposed to check phone records.|-It gave me a headache.
{88100}{88140}-Stop whining.|-I'm not whining.
{88146}{88191}Yes, you are. You're whining.
{88197}{88241}We've talked about this.
{88253}{88295}Are you interested in the story or not?
{88482}{88543}At first, we thought he was really nice.
{88549}{88658}Then we heard him saying mean things|about Jews and using foul language.
{88664}{88700}We realized he was a jerk.
{88706}{88737}A jerk.
{88743}{88800}We could hear him kicking the dog|on the tape.
{88806}{88829}There's a tape?
{88835}{88900}He records everything. It's in|Rose Mary's desk. He's paranoid.
{88906}{88946}What else did he say on this tape?
{88952}{88989}They talked about hiding...
{88998}{89087}...some guy in South America|because he knew about Watergate.
{89093}{89182}Let me get this straight. You're saying|the President of the United States--
{89188}{89236}-Of America.|-Of America...
{89242}{89330}...the most powerful country|in the world...
{89351}{89408}...is involved|in this Watergate cover-up?
{89414}{89441}-Yeah.|-I guess.
{89449}{89498}Who is he talking to on this tape?
{89528}{89558}Erlichman?
{89577}{89607}Hurlichman.
{89621}{89684}-No, there isn't a Hurlichman.|-Yes, there is.
{89690}{89722}There's not a Hurlichman.
{89730}{89798}There's a Haldeman.|And there's an Erlichman.
{89810}{89832}Wait, wait, wait.
{89838}{89890}The guy who's, like, kind of fleshy...
{89896}{89975}...who wears horn-rimmed glasses|and a cheesy dark suit.
{89982}{90006}It sounded like him.
{90049}{90086}Show me which one.
{90167}{90228}I never realized how much|they all look alike.
{90290}{90382}The document you mentioned on the phone,|it was written to Haldeman?
{90388}{90452}If we publish that, we could nail him.
{90458}{90507}Give me skin, Daddy.
{90582}{90635}We don't really have it right now.
{90640}{90660}What?
{90688}{90726}The dog ate it.
{90735}{90765}The dog ate it.
{90838}{90926}Great. You know, I don't need this.|I went to Yale.
{90960}{90980}Sorry.
{91012}{91068}We could've gotten grounded|for sneaking out.
{91074}{91119}If we could get that tape....
{91125}{91165}But it's in the White House.
{91171}{91269}You know who else I think is sexy|is Robert Plant, from Led Zeppelin.
{91282}{91334}He reminds me of my brother.
{91473}{91545}Your brother's not that bad.|Not that I like him.
{91553}{91616}I can't run this. You don't have it.
{91622}{91649}What?
{91673}{91764}I might be willing to take the risk|on these other names...
{91770}{91810}...but not on Haldeman. My God!
{91816}{91915}He's the man who controls access|to the leader of the free world.
{91927}{91963}There is another source.
{91969}{92054}You mean, your what-do-you-call-it?
{92060}{92080}Hand Job.
{92093}{92121}Deep Throat.
{92127}{92215}Yeah, Deep Throat.|Well, tell me about Deep Throat.
{92223}{92309}Well, " he" Iinks the President...
{92315}{92337}...to the burglary...
{92343}{92384}...and to a cover-up.
{92390}{92417}Jesus!
{92438}{92474}What branch is he in?
{92509}{92541}Executive.
{92547}{92577}How high?
{92583}{92610}About yea high.
{92637}{92675}Don't do this to me.
{92682}{92746}Get some more sources on those names.
{92753}{92841}Bring me in some hard evidence|and nail it down.
{92858}{92932}Some people think|that Mick Jagger's lips are gross.
{92938}{92981}But I think that they're sexy.
{92987}{93057}They're like this big couch|made out of skin.
{93063}{93117}You're so hard rock now.
{93207}{93229}What?
{93235}{93325}That van's been right behind us|since we left school. Don't look.
{93331}{93362}I have to.
{93540}{93580}-We're being followed.|-By who?
{93586}{93629}I don't know.|Do you think it's Dick?
{93635}{93720}Maybe he knows we talked to|the " radical, muckraking bastards."
{93726}{93762}He couldn't know.
{93768}{93801}He could.
{93860}{93905}Dick frightens me.
{93933}{93967}Hello, this is Bob Woodward.
{93974}{94018}And Carl Bernstein, Washington Post.
{94024}{94120}Carl's on the other line. We have|a few questions we'd like to ask you.
{94126}{94166}Girls! Arlene, Betsy!
{94172}{94201}We can't talk now.
{94207}{94312}We need to know some names from|that list you had. Do you remember any?
{94318}{94372}We're under a lot of pressure too.
{94378}{94440}It's okay.|You don't have to name any names.
{94446}{94481}-Don't answer.|-We'll say names.
{94487}{94571}We'll count to 1 0. If you don't|hang up, that's a confirmation.
{94585}{94612}What?
{94662}{94708}I'm so sorry to interrupt you.
{94714}{94759}-Go!|-Just go with it!
{94812}{94872}I asked you to come to dinner|1 5 minutes ago.
{94878}{94918}Now your TV dinners are ice-cold.
{94924}{94970}In fact, they're frozen again.
{94977}{95012}McCord.
{95080}{95100}Lang.
{95106}{95195}So come to the table now, or I'll never|fix you dinner again, ever!
{95201}{95221}Seven...
{95226}{95250}...eight...
{95260}{95280}...nine...
{95289}{95321}We'll be right there, Mom.
{95373}{95393}...ten.
{95406}{95446}Thank you very much.
{95607}{95641}They hung up.
{95698}{95736}I'm sorry, Janet.
{95742}{95767}You all right?
{96377}{96429}You scared us to death!|What's the matter?
{96435}{96501}You little lying sacks of shit|are the matter!
{96515}{96535}Listen!
{96646}{96735}You guys gave us bad information|on the phone.
{96753}{96797}The names on the list?
{96812}{96887}We printed it, they denied it,|and our other source backed out!
{96893}{96960}Now everybody thinks|that I'm a schmuck!
{96987}{97014}What names?
{97020}{97064}The names! The information!
{97070}{97119}Listen, people are counting on you!
{97127}{97225}You're big-shot reporters. Can't you|figure anything out for yourselves?
{97231}{97292}How could you let your dog|eat that list?
{97298}{97335}You're ruining my life!
{97401}{97496}We have a very important report|on turquoise jewelry due in two days...
{97502}{97575}...and we can't find books on it,|and the President is having us followed.
{97581}{97664}-It's too much pressure.|-Just leave us alone!
{98079}{98113}I'm in here, dear.
{98119}{98167}How come you're home so early?
{98173}{98202}Honey...
{98227}{98266}...l've met someone.
{98279}{98320}I've met someone.
{98326}{98353}Here he is.
{98390}{98426}Hello, Arlene.
{98494}{98525}How did you know my name?
{98589}{98628}It's embroidered on your blouse.
{98989}{99039}It's really so funny how we met.
{99045}{99160}I was in the market at lunch and we|literally just crashed into each other.
{99166}{99280}I said, " Excuse me, your peanut butter|is in my chocolate."
{99342}{99433}And I said, "Your chocolate|is in my peanut butter."
{99496}{99543}We haven't been separated|since then.
{99549}{99617}Well, until I used the bathroom|just now.
{99697}{99763}Roderick, you're such a treasure.
{99932}{99986}Honey, did you leave the door open?
{100236}{100271}We've been robbed.
{100356}{100407}My grandmother's pearls!
{100430}{100465}My stash!
{100585}{100662}Are you absolutely positive|nothing is missing?
{100695}{100741}I don't understand it at all.
{100747}{100855}My jewelry case wasn't touched,|but they ripped apart the sofa cushions.
{100861}{100893}I need a drink.
{100899}{100974}Maybe they just didn't like|my wife's taste in decorating.
{101041}{101116}If I didn't know better, I'd say|someone was looking for something.
{101122}{101206}-I can't imagine what.|-We're just a normal family.
{101212}{101261}Okay, I wouldn't go that far.
{101431}{101486}They only stole|the Hello Dollies recipe.
{101492}{101566}Not jewelry or the TV|or Larry's pot or anything.
{101572}{101609}It's too much of a coincidence.
{101615}{101697}Your house gets robbed, and my mom|gets a boyfriend the same night?
{101710}{101740}Why don't you like him?
{101746}{101843}Because I think he's a spy for Dick.|No guy like that would go for my mom.
{103006}{103069}I'll buzz you up|so that my mom doesn't hear.
{103219}{103229}Betsy, what're you doing?
{103229}{103265}Betsy, what're you doing?
{103292}{103339}-We're being bugged!|-What?
{103351}{103427}The President of the United States|is bugging our houses...
{103433}{103476}...and spying on us!
{103512}{103553}What did you just say?
{103642}{103687}It's a line from a song.
{103693}{103741}We're being bugged
{103755}{103776}The White House
{103837}{103925}There's a man from The Washington Post|on the phone for you.
{104073}{104124}It's Carl Bernstein from The Post.
{104130}{104162}The information you gave--
{104184}{104241}We're not interested|in a subscription.
{104247}{104268}Thanks, no.
{104283}{104350}No, we prefer the news on TV.|Thank you.
{104381}{104436}I thought we already got The Post.
{104469}{104543}You know, there is something|very strange going on here.
{104549}{104574}I know there is.
{104592}{104652}And I don't want to know|what it is. Okay?
{104730}{104801}And in all my years of public life,|I can say...
{104807}{104899}... that I have|never, ever obstructedjustice.
{104912}{104953}This is all his fault.
{104972}{105046}The people have got to know...
{105055}{105121}... whether or not|their President is a crook.
{105149}{105181}Well...
{105187}{105212}...l'm not a crook.
{105218}{105271}He's trying to drive me insane.
{105547}{105568}Oh, my God!
{105574}{105615}We have to get out of here!
{105712}{105759}-Oh, my God!|-It's okay.
{106032}{106055}Go!
{106310}{106345}Oh, my God!
{106725}{106809}So these girls are a threat|to national security?
{106830}{106878}According to the President.
{106918}{107002}How dare those people keep treating us|like stupid teenage girls!
{107010}{107068}We are stupid teenage girls.
{107074}{107136}No, Betsy, we're human beings.
{107142}{107194}And we're American citizens.
{107205}{107290}And fourscore and seven years ago,|our forefathers...
{107306}{107349}...did something.|I don't know what.
{107358}{107434}But I do know one thing:|Dick's ass is grass.
{107440}{107503}Where are we going?|What are we doing?
{107509}{107576}If Haldeman has the tapes|that Woodward and Bernstein want...
{107582}{107623}...we're gonna find them.
{107653}{107703}This is it.|This is Haldeman's house.
{107709}{107738}21 70.
{107876}{107917}Look, there's somebody there.
{107991}{108034}Haldeman must have a son.
{108040}{108082}Wait, let me see.
{108120}{108140}We have a mission.
{108146}{108231}We have to figure out a way|to get inside and find those tapes.
{108274}{108318}Don't worry, Arlene.
{108330}{108363}I'll do it.
{108630}{108655}Do you remember me?
{108725}{108758}Betsy, right.
{108768}{108802}From the Homecoming dance.
{108817}{108838}Right.
{109141}{109164}Want to make out?
{109170}{109192}Sure.
{109864}{109900}Are you all right?
{109914}{109938}Fine.
{109973}{110045}I need to go to the bathroom.|Will you excuse me?
{111710}{111757}What's going on here?
{111775}{111807}Beer bong?
{111842}{111898}I'm tripping heavily already.
{112321}{112350}You know....
{112421}{112461}I really like you.
{112486}{112521}Don't talk to me.
{112545}{112570}Kiss me.
{113472}{113506}Anybody home?
{113723}{113774}Oh, my God, it's so terrible.
{113781}{113832}-Dean's leaving.|-Jesus!
{113872}{113904}He's leaving, all right.
{113910}{113993}Dean's a team player.|He's not gonna cave in like that.
{114001}{114052}No, I just don't believe it.
{114058}{114117}You better! It'll be|in the paper tomorrow.
{114123}{114184}I talked to Dean,|and he said it was true.
{114190}{114283}It's happening. It's happening.|It's real, man.
{114295}{114357}Well, I guess...
{114368}{114410}...the shit's hitting the fan now?
{114416}{114472}Damn right it's hitting the fan.
{114607}{114627}What's the matter?
{114632}{114683}Something's in my ass.
{114757}{114786}Am I bleeding?
{114798}{114830}You're fine.
{114848}{114937}Figures that the pain in my ass|is Nixon, the fascist.
{114959}{115000}He's your dad's boss.
{115017}{115065}My dad's an arms manufacturer.
{115081}{115120}Aren't you Haldeman's son?
{115134}{115170}No. That's Brad.
{115176}{115216}I'm his roommate at school.
{115222}{115268}He's at the dermatologist.
{115274}{115310}But this is his house, right?
{115341}{115380}Yeah. What the hell's going on?
{115386}{115425}Did we meet before or not?
{115462}{115491}So you don't remember?
{115502}{115555}I remember like it was yesterday.
{115591}{115621}That's funny...
{115638}{115678}...because we never met.
{115706}{115733}What?
{115753}{115832}I just saw you on the street|and thought you were cute.
{115843}{115865}Really?
{116024}{116055}You're hot.
{116061}{116089}Thanks.
{116131}{116166}Liddy says...
{116173}{116210}...that these prisons are....
{116221}{116265}They're like Club Med...
{116271}{116307}...just like Club Med.
{116313}{116338}Well, I have...
{116349}{116426}...a particularly incriminating tape|I brought home.
{116432}{116477}I should give that a listen.
{116493}{116557}Sure. Yeah, I'll say hi to the wife.
{116563}{116637}-Take care.|-Okay. You take care too.
{117138}{117180}Sorry, Mr. Haldeman.
{117195}{117231}That's okay, Chip.
{117245}{117268}Who is this?
{117274}{117311}This is Betsy, sir.
{117666}{117693}Wait a minute.
{117721}{117749}I know you.
{117770}{117793}You're one of those dog--
{117899}{117935}Shit!
{118041}{118082}Come back here, you little bitches!
{118582}{118608}It's not right.
{118614}{118660}Sources are sources.|Just because--
{118666}{118710}How goes it, paperboys?
{118731}{118758}Not too good.
{118764}{118806}Well, your luck's about to change.
{118812}{118915}The President knew about it for sure,|for absolute sure.
{118939}{118962}That's the tape.
{118968}{118991}It's the tape.
{118997}{119046}We finally have goods on Dick.
{119106}{119145}Tricky Dick's going down.
{119174}{119284}It's unethical to take possession|of the tape if it's stolen, but--
{119290}{119360}You can't have it anyway.|It's our only souvenir.
{119389}{119468}But we copied it down.|Thirty words a minute.
{119474}{119507}I passed typing.
{119535}{119601}A lot of people want to know|who our source is.
{119607}{119631}Really?
{119641}{119668}We'll be famous.
{119674}{119739}But we've decided|never to reveal your identity.
{119753}{119785}For our own protection?
{119858}{119911}It's just too embarrassing.
{119918}{119961}Dick's going down.
{119994}{120043}Dick is going down!
{120445}{120496}In a series of events|that rocked the nation...
{120502}{120551}... the White House accepted|the resignations...
{120558}{120627}... of Presidential Counsel John Dean....
{120649}{120767}I can't believe this Watergate business|runs so high up.
{120806}{120865}You have no idea.
{120889}{120937}I realized one day...
{120966}{121011}... that if I stayed...
{121030}{121108}...l'd be just as bad as he was.
{121846}{121947}I'd say these people are gonna|cost a million dollars...
{121953}{121990}... over the next two years.
{122025}{122067}We can get that.
{122074}{122166}You can get a million dollars|and you can get it in cash.
{122172}{122235}I know where it could be gotten.
{122282}{122304}I love you
{122304}{122317}I love you
{122345}{122399}I honestly love you
{122434}{122487}What in the bejesus is that?
{122677}{122745}I can't keep my feelings inside|any longer.
{122756}{122803}I've never felt this way|about anybody...
{122809}{122901}-...not even Bobby Sherman....|-A 1 5-year-old.
{122910}{122940}Oh, Jesus!
{122946}{122999}And that this is the real thing.
{123031}{123090}Watergate, my ass!
{123099}{123158}They'll crucify me if they hear this.
{123169}{123207}Checkers, shut up!
{123218}{123282}Or I'll feed you to the Chinese!
{123297}{123339}Erase this shit.
{123432}{123475}What's that smell?
{123530}{123572}Hello Dollies!
{123578}{123623}Where'd you get the recipe?|It was stolen.
{123633}{123708}It's on the label|of every can, lamebrain.
{123725}{123756}Except...
{123767}{123835}...for one special Larry Jobs addition.
{123910}{123973}I keep them mixed up with the walnuts.
{124034}{124101}You said these were|just walnut leaves.
{124112}{124141}I lied.
{124152}{124206}But the President ate those.
{124214}{124264}Right, your pal, Tricky Dick.
{124270}{124310}No, really.
{124377}{124442}Maybe that's why he's so paranoid.
{124610}{124632}It's happening.
{124638}{124684}-What?|-Come on.
{124753}{124839}Throughout the long and difficult|period of Watergate...
{124853}{124937}...l have felt it was my duty|to persevere...
{124962}{125043}... to make every possible effort|to complete the term of office...
{125049}{125095}... to which you elected me.
{125102}{125142}But as President...
{125161}{125241}...l must put the interest|of America first.
{125280}{125310}Therefore...
{125334}{125399}...l shall resign the Presidency...
{125406}{125468}... effective at noon tomorrow.
{125487}{125556}Vice President Ford will be|sworn in at that hour...
{125562}{125631}-It's gonna be different now.|-... in this office.
{125655}{125694}They'll never lie to us again.
{125694}{125707}They'll never lie to us again.
{126022}{126087}Isn't it against the law|to cut up the flag?
{126110}{126160}Not if you sew it back together.
{128745}{128823}We look so fantastic.
{129135}{129158}We gotta hurry!
{129821}{129843}Look!
{129849}{129906}You suck, Dick!
{130110}{130164}Bye, Tricky Dick!
