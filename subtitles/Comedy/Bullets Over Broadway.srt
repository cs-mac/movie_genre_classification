1
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,896
Toot-Toot-Tootsie good-bye

2
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:45,309
Toot-Toot-Tootsie don't cry

3
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,993
The little choo-choo train
that takes me

4
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:52,414
Away from you, You don't know
just how sad it makes me

5
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:56,165
Kiss me Tootsie and then

6
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:59,297
Do it over again

7
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:02,945
Watch for the mail I'll never fail

8
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:06,843
If you don't get a letter then
you know I'm in jail Hey, hey

9
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:09,884
Don't cry, Tootsie Don't cry

10
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:13,339
Kiss me, Tootsie Good-bye

11
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:50,903
Get hot Don't cry, Tootsie Don't cry

12
00:01:52,126 --> 00:01:56,982
Good-bye, Tootsie Oh, good-bye#

13
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:59,639
I'm an artist, and I won't change
a word of my play...

14
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:01,684
to pander to some commercial
Broadway audience !

15
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:04,723
I'm not arguing with you !
Do you see me arguing ?

16
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:08,276
Your play is great as is. It's real.
It makes a point. It's confrontational.

17
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:11,663
- Then why won't you produce it ?
- Because I cannot afford another failure.

18
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,864
- David, the play's too heavy.
- But not everybody writes to distract.

19
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:17,655
- It's the theater's duty
not just to entertain...

20
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:20,110
- But to transform men's souls.
- Oh, come on.

21
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:23,447
You're not at one of your sidewalk cafes
in Greenwich Village. This is Broadway.

22
00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:26,097
- You said you believed in my play !
- What do you want me to say ?

23
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:29,460
I'm tapped out. Maybe if we got some
big-time director interested...

24
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:32,594
- I could scare up backers...
- No, no, no. I'm directing this play.

25
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:35,598
Ohh, will you listen to this guy ?
Where's your track record ?

26
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:38,256
I won't see my work mangled again.
I've been through this twice before.

27
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:41,141
Two powerful scripts,
could have been tremendous successes

28
00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:45,548
and I had to watch actors change
my dialogue and directors
misinterpret everything !

29
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:47,477
I know. I know.
You're an artist.

30
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:52,275
Let me tell you, kid, that's the real world out
there, and it's a lot rougher than you think.

31
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:57,265
Ma
He's makin' eyes at me

32
00:02:57,332 --> 00:03:01,073
Ma
He's awful nice to me

33
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:05,677
Ma, he's almost
breakin' my heart

34
00:03:05,714 --> 00:03:08,878
What are you waitin' for ?
Kill them !

35
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:12,840
Come on. Let's go
get somethin' to eat.

36
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:15,726
- I feel like eatin' ribs.
- That's a good idea.

37
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:20,134
I gotta go shoot crap at Tommy's. He's
got a game at the Ansonia. I gotta go.

38
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,655
Somebody's got to let Mr. Valenti know
what's going on. He's at the Three Deuces.

39
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:27,269
- Why don't you go tell him ?
- I promised Bobby Doyle.
I can't do nothin'.

40
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:32,099
- I gotta shoot a game.
- What's a matter, Cheech ? Don't
you wanna baby-sit his girl ?

41
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:34,148
His girlfriend's
a pain in my ass.

42
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:37,964
You gotta see Mama
every night

43
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:41,324
Or you can't see Mama
at all

44
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:45,034
You gotta kiss Mama
Treat her right

45
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,547
Or she won't be home
when you call

46
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,002
Now if you want
my company

47
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:54,857
- Here, doll, take care of this hat.
- You can't fifty-fifty me

48
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:57,987
- Mr. V. here ?
- Yeah, right this way.

49
00:03:58,057 --> 00:04:01,854
- Nice crowd.
- Yeah, we're packin' 'em in every night.

50
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:05,922
- Right here.
- Monday night I sat alone

51
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:09,697
Tuesday night
you didn't phone

52
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:13,793
Wednesday night
you didn't call

53
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:17,791
- Done.
- Now that's a load off my mind.
How many ?

54
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:21,157
- Four.
- This means we ain't heard the last.

55
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:24,701
You know Kustabeck's gonna have a fit,
but he'll run scared.

56
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:27,424
- Maybe.
- Listen, a deal's a deal.

57
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:32,576
- We got midtown. I mean, eh...
Mr. Valenti does.

58
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:35,327
I don't want that kind
of a sheik

59
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,884
Who does his sheiking
once a week

60
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:42,842
You gotta see Mama
every night

61
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:45,728
Or you can't see

62
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:53,310
You can't see Mama
at all

63
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:56,348
Not at all.

64
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:02,005
I'm fed up !
I'm fed up, do you hear me ?

65
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:06,103
You can push your torpedoes around all
you want, but I've had it up to here !

66
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,856
- What is it now ?
- I am not sharing a dressing room.

67
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:13,531
I am tired of getting bumped into and stepped on.
None of these bimbos knows how to dance.

68
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:16,215
- Bimbos !
- They're the best line in New York.

69
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,324
- Bullshit ! Bullshit !
- Oh, knock it off.

70
00:05:18,396 --> 00:05:20,762
- Hey, clam up over there.
Olive, come on.
- What ?

71
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,856
- Olive, it's our anniversary.
- It's not our anniversary.

72
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:26,266
- You're getting senile.
- It's September 28. Six months to today.

73
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:28,184
- So ?
- I remember it like it was yesterday...

74
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:30,835
'cause that's the morning
we broke Joey Benjamin's legs.

75
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:33,492
- Six months ? Six months !
- Yeah. Six months.

76
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:37,459
- And I'm still stuck
in this crummy rat trap !
- Olive. I brought you somethin'.

77
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,252
- What is it ?
- Open it.

78
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,314
- No, you open it.
Can't you see I'm dressing ?
- I'll open it. Here. Hey.

79
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,198
- What is it ?
- Pearls ! What the hell
do you think they are ?

80
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:48,271
- Pearls are white.
- These are black pearls.

81
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:51,987
Don't give me that !
I never heard of black pearls.

82
00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:54,574
Just 'cause you never heard of somethin'
don't mean it don't exist.

83
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,420
What do you think I am ? Some kind
of chump ? They're black, for God's sake.

84
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:02,794
- They probably came from defective oysters.
- The pearls ain't sick.

85
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:06,413
Black pearls, they're supposed...
What ? They're supposed to be black !

86
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:10,030
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Don't be that way.
You know I'm nuts about you.

87
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,289
If you're nuts about me, Nickie,
why don't you get me out
of this lousy chorus line ?

88
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:17,802
I came to New York to be an actress.
That's where my gifts are.

89
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:21,551
You will, baby. You'll be a great
actress. A promise is a promise.

90
00:06:21,618 --> 00:06:25,643
- Yeah, I...
- Come on. Get yourself dressed.
I'm takin' you to Harlem.

91
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:29,161
- The Cotton Club ?
- Yeah, baby

92
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:32,298
I'm telling you, they read my play,
they love it but they're afraid of it.

93
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:34,540
- [Man] It's irrelevant.
- It's not irrelevant !

94
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:37,422
The point
I'm making is that...

95
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:41,830
no truly great artist has ever
been appreciated in his lifetime.

96
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,789
- Not one ?
- No, no.

97
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:48,872
- Flender.
- Take, uh, uh... Van Gogh
or Edgar Allen Poe.

98
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,683
Poe died poor and freezing
with his cat curled on his feet.

99
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:56,164
David, don't give up on it.
Maybe it'll be produced posthumously.

100
00:06:56,236 --> 00:07:00,032
You know, I-I-I have never
had a play produced... That's right.

101
00:07:00,107 --> 00:07:04,035
- And I've written one play every
year for the past 20 years.
- That's because you're a genius.

102
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:07,719
The proof is that both common
people and intellectuals find
your work completely incoherent.

103
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:10,949
- It means you're a genius.
- We all have our moments of doubt.

104
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:16,679
I paint a canvas every week, take one
look at it and slash it with a razor.

105
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:20,387
- Well, in your case that's a good idea.
- I have faith in your plays.

106
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:24,068
- She has faith in my plays
because she loves me.
- Also because you're a genius.

107
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:26,950
Ten years ago, I-I-I kidnapped
this woman from a very beautiful...

108
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:30,146
middle-class life in Pittsburgh, and
I made her life miserable ever since.

109
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:33,083
Hey, Ellen, as long
as he's a good man, keep him.

110
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:36,867
You know, I think the mistake
we women make is we fall
in love with the artist...

111
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:38,789
- Hey, you guys, are you listening ?
- Yes, yes.

112
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:41,374
- We fall in love with
the artist, not the man.
- I don't think that's a mistake.

113
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,778
- How is that a mistake ?
- The artist makes the man.

114
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:47,865
She's right. You can't
separate 'em. No, look. Say
there was a burning building...

115
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,102
and you could rush in, and
you could save only one thing:

116
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:56,026
either the last known copy
of Shakespeare's plays or
some anonymous human being.

117
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:58,039
- You cannot...
- What would you do ?

118
00:07:58,113 --> 00:08:00,502
- You cannot deprive the world
of those plays.
- Correct.

119
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:02,879
- Phone call, David.
- It's an inanimate object.

120
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:07,516
It's not an inanimate object !
It's art ! Art is life ! It lives !

121
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:10,398
We got the money.
We can do the play.

122
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:13,017
What ? When ? How ?

123
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:15,934
A single backer
goin' for the whole show.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,064
An old acquaintance. I'm up
at the Cotton Club. I ran into him.

125
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:22,430
- And no hitches ?
- Well, uh...

126
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:26,521
We'll meet tomorrow and discuss it,
all right ? Luxor Baths. Noon.

127
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:32,474
Are you nuts ? You think I'm gonna let
some amateur play the lead in my play ?

128
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,060
Did I say "lead" ?
Did I say "lead, " Mr. Genius ?

129
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:38,100
- Some guy's girlfriend 'cause
he's puttin' up the money ?
- Did I say "lead" ?

130
00:08:38,172 --> 00:08:40,985
I said a part, a role.
I thought maybe Dr. Philips.

131
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,018
- The psychiatrist ? It's a key role.
- What key role ?

132
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:47,090
- It's a small part. Key role !
- Who is this woman anyway ?

133
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:50,642
Olive Neal ? I don't even know what
she looks like, much less can she act.

134
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:53,560
He says she's the stuff
that stars are made of.

135
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:56,406
That's 'cause he's in love with her.
And who is he anyway ?

136
00:08:56,472 --> 00:09:00,782
- His name is Nick Valenti.
- How-How... How do I know
that name ? What's he do ?

137
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:04,084
- Ah, he's got his finger
in a number of pies.
- I don't like the sound of this.

138
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:07,085
- Look, you wanna
get your play on or not ?
- I gotta meet her first.

139
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:09,166
- So you'll meet her.
- I'm conflicted.

140
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:12,816
- You'll meet her. That's all I'm saying.
- The psychiatrist is not small.

141
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:17,609
It's not the lead. It's... It's a
small part. Who do you see in the lead ?

142
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:20,370
- I don't know.
- What about Helen Sinclair ?

143
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:24,179
Oh, sure. I mean, she'd be great.
But can we get her ?

144
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:26,894
Why can't we get her ? She's been in
nothin' but flops the past three years.

145
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:28,817
Yeah, but she's
a major actress.

146
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,924
Was.

147
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:33,743
She'd be great.
I mean, really, she's brilliant.

148
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:36,940
- She possess the necessary fire.
For the part, she'd be great.
- You really think so ?

149
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:39,594
- I'm glad you think so.
- Think we can get her ?

150
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:43,407
- I sent the script
to her agent, Sidney Loomis.
- You did ?

151
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:46,952
- Did I do wrong ? Did I do wrong ?
- No, no.

152
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:49,543
- Did I do wrong not checking
with you first ?
- Not at all.

153
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:52,360
- If so, I stand corrected. I mean that.
- No, really.

154
00:09:52,398 --> 00:09:55,945
- Helen Sinclair... really.
- Get it out.

155
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:59,428
- She's great.
- Well, all we can do
is hope for the best.

156
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:02,469
You must be joking !

157
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:07,330
You want me to play some frumpy
housewife who gets dumped for a flapper ?

158
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:11,364
Don't you remember who I am ?
Don't you know who you represent ?

159
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:15,233
- I'm Helen Sinclair !
- Definitely ! You are
definitely Helen Sinclair.

160
00:10:15,307 --> 00:10:19,780
I look at you and I say Helen Sinclair !
But who better to play that role ?

161
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:22,500
- Under whose direction ? Some novice !
- He's the author.

162
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:26,017
- Of two flops.
- Julian says it was the directors
that messed up those projects.

163
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,552
Julian Marx ! I do plays put on
by Belasco or Sam Harris.

164
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,919
Not some Yiddish pants salesman
turned producer.

165
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:39,075
My ex-husband used to say,
"lf you're gonna go down,
go down with the best of them."

166
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:42,688
- Which ex-husband ?
- Oh, I don't know which ex-husband.
The one with the moustache.

167
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:45,921
Listen to me. Authors are very often
the best directors of their own works.

168
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:48,989
She's dowdy ! Sid, the ingenue
has all the hot lines.

169
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,549
Even the female psychiatrist
is a better role.

170
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:54,469
But the role of Sylvia Poston
is the lead.

171
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:59,201
Sylvia Poston.
Even the name reeks of Orbach's !

172
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:02,782
I do Electra !
I do Lady Macbeth !

173
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:07,901
I do plays by Noel and Phil Barry
or at least Max Anderson.

174
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,411
Helen, listen to me. This is
a major part in a serious play.

175
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:15,830
And let's face it, Helen. You have
not been in a hit in a long time.

176
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:19,734
- In a long, long, long time.
- I'm still a star !

177
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,934
I never play
frumps or virgins.

178
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,268
You're a star because you're great,
and you are a great star.

179
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:28,191
- But let me tell you somethin'.
- [Bell Rings]

180
00:11:28,224 --> 00:11:30,110
In the last couple of years...

181
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:32,728
you're better known as an adulteress and
a drunk... I say this in all due respect.

182
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:35,067
I haven't had a drink
since New Year's Eve.

183
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:36,989
- We're talkin' Chinese New Year's.
- Naturally.

184
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,510
Still, that's two days, Sid.
You know how long that is for me ?

185
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:42,035
- What is it, Josette ?
- Some flowers.

186
00:11:42,108 --> 00:11:43,996
Well, bring them here,
will you ?

187
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:47,094
The offers are not pourin' in
like they used to.

188
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,498
They're from David Shayne.

189
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:53,203
"As a small artist to a greater one.
That you merely consider my play...

190
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:56,623
is all the fulfillment
I require.

191
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,554
Hmm.

192
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:05,111
- What's he like ?
- I hear he's terrific.
A genius ready to emerge.

193
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:08,308
- I have to be billed over the title.
- Where else ?

194
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:12,752
- Approval of the leading man.
The star's dressing room.
- This is not even a question.

195
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:15,125
Approval of
all photos of me.

196
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:17,613
Oh, it's still not
a very glamorous role.

197
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:21,397
But maybe I could meet with David.
Maybe we could go over the script.

198
00:12:21,463 --> 00:12:25,259
Maybe there's a few ways
we could find to brighten her up. Hmm ?

199
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:27,308
Why am I nervous ?

200
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:32,307
- That was sad. Clara Bow had it rough.
- She's a doll.

201
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:36,137
- I'd do anything to be in a movie.
- You're pretty enough.

202
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:39,440
Do you think you could
ever speak to Mr. Valenti ?

203
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,122
- Mr. Valenti knows everybody.
He'll do the right thing.
- That's right.

204
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:45,642
I hear he's gonna make Olive Neal
a Broadway star

205
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:55,178
Go, go, go !

206
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:57,517
Where'd it happen ?

207
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:00,932
Who'd they get ?
Oh, Jesus !

208
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:04,042
All right, I'm gonna be
at Olive's for about an hour.

209
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:07,211
You get some more guys downstairs
and call me back on the Masucci thing.

210
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,345
- This is for Leo Kustabeck, you hear me ?
- Hey !

211
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:14,189
- You said this was the lead.
It's a smaller part.
- All right.

212
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:16,774
- I got no time now.
- It's a smaller part.
I don't believe it.

213
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:19,660
- They just got Vinny and Sal
outside a movie house.
- I counted the lines.

214
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:23,401
- Sylvia Poston is the lead.
I'm just backing her up.
- You hear what I said ?

215
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:27,809
- I'm tired of backing people up.
I wanna be the lead.
- Julian says you're a doctor.

216
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:31,495
- A doctor. I don't wanna be
a doctor. I wanna be the lead.
- A head doctor. It's a big part.

217
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:34,082
A head doctor,
but it ain't the lead.

218
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:36,675
- So don't try and snow me.
- You'd squawk if they
hung you with a new rope.

219
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:39,614
- I know a lead when I see a lead,
and this ain't the lead.

220
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:43,169
- A lead is on every single page.
A lead has lots of scenes.
- Hello ? Oh, Vito.

221
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:47,844
- Ya heard ? Get everybody
together at the garage.
- I don't get to kiss nobody.

222
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:50,727
- No, I want it done today !
What is it with you ?
- Hey !

223
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:54,785
- You wanna take your business
outta here ? We got guests !
- Call me back.

224
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:57,887
- I got trouble here.
- I don't care about your trouble.

225
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,446
- What am I supposed to do ?
Just foot the bills around here ?
- I don't care.

226
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:05,438
- And I want my say with
this Broadway big shot too.
- Okay, just don't embarrass me.

227
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:08,956
- I'm lookin' out
for your interests, okay ?
- Miss Olive ?

228
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:13,119
- There's a Mr. Marx and...
- I know, I know. Send 'em in, Venus.

229
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:15,327
- Listen. When they get here...
- What ?

230
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:18,560
- Charm 'em a little, baby.
- You're the one that
needs charm lessons.

231
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:21,693
- I told them you're a great actress.
- I am a great actress.

232
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:24,729
Nick Valenti !
Say hello to David Shayne.

233
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,224
- David, how are you ?
- Hello. I'm Olive.

234
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:29,239
- This is Olive Neal.
- Charmed, charmed, charmed.

235
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:32,182
- Come on in. Come on.
- Come on in.

236
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:35,103
- Hey, Dave, she read your play.
She thinks it's great.
- Yes, I read your play.

237
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,851
It's thrilling, turbulent,
a page turner.

238
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,375
Charmed, charmed,
charmed, charmed.

239
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:42,778
She's a great little actress.
Just needs a break.

240
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:45,661
- What have you been in, Miss, uh...
- Olive. Olive. Olive.

241
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:47,668
- Call me Olive, honey.
- You smoke ?
- No.

242
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:50,359
- Olive, ah, your...
well, your experience ?
- I love the play.

243
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,732
- Well, I, uh...
- Oh, she ain't got no experience.

244
00:14:52,798 --> 00:14:55,098
- I do too. I have too.
- She's a natural.

245
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:57,106
- I have experience.
- They ain't talkin' dancin', Olive.

246
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,442
- He doesn't know
what he's talkin' about.
- You don't mean dancin', do you ?

247
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:05,014
She used to wiggle at this joint
in Hoboken. Pick up quarters
off the tabletops with her...

248
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,182
- Hey ! Butt out, why don't ya !
They're talkin' to me !
- I'm tryin' to break the ice.

249
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,313
- Who wants a drink ?
- I'll have a double anything. Be great.

250
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:13,524
- No, I have an ulcer.
- Venus, a double whiskey.

251
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:17,073
- Make it two, Venus.
- Do you want the blue
stuff or the green ?

252
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:20,559
- The imported, dummy.
- Oh, you mean from the clean bathtub.

253
00:15:20,632 --> 00:15:22,323
Mm-hmm.

254
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:27,692
- So you never acted before ?
- Honey, honey. Yes, I have acted.

255
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:32,174
I have acted. I've acted a lot.
I was in a musical revue.
Can you light this for me ?

256
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:35,821
Geez. No manners.
No gentleman.

257
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:39,758
Yeah, I did a musical revue
in Wichita.

258
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:43,473
Maybe you heard of it. It was called
Leave A Specimen. I had two songs.

259
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,540
- Two numbers. Two thrilling,
show-stopping numbers.

260
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,263
I'm actually feeling
a little sick, really.

261
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:51,698
I'm actually feeling a little faint.
Can we sit down ?

262
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:57,426
So, one thing I was wonderin'
is who's gonna be playing
the part of Sylvia Poston ?

263
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,695
Only Helen Sinclair.

264
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:03,788
Helen Sinclair ?
I never heard of her.

265
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:08,265
- Uh, you follow the theater ?
- What are you trying to insinuate ?

266
00:16:08,337 --> 00:16:10,191
Hey, don't
gimme that shit !

267
00:16:10,257 --> 00:16:14,762
You tell Masucci he don't play
ball, I'll come down there,
I'll chop his fuckin' legs off !

268
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:18,246
Don't you pay any attention to Nick.
He's in one of his depressed moods.

269
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:22,504
I'll cut his throat. I'll come
down there, I'll pull his guts
out through his windpipe !

270
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:24,613
- Ya hear me ?
- What'd ya do ? Walk up ?

271
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,540
- No !
- You're sweating like a pig.

272
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:30,499
- I have a bit of a blood sugar
situation now and again.
- Blood sugar ?

273
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,119
- What is that ?
- Olive, you... you like the play ?

274
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:37,733
- Mmm. It's sad.
- Well, it's a tragedy.

275
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:41,633
I'll say, but I got some ideas
how we can goose it up.

276
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:44,194
- Ideas ?
- Mm-hmm. I go to
the movies all the time.

277
00:16:44,427 --> 00:16:49,215
- I got a million clever ideas.
- You burn it down, Cheech !
Burn it down, I said.

278
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:52,552
- I want it to look like arson !
- I got a crick.

279
00:16:52,618 --> 00:16:54,406
- When ?
- A crick ?

280
00:16:54,474 --> 00:16:58,815
Everything's tight.
I think maybe we should go.

281
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:01,377
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go.

282
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:04,066
Hey, Venus, let's go
with that hooch !

283
00:17:04,135 --> 00:17:07,451
Uh, uh, Olive, when did you
get interested in acting ?

284
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,868
Hey, listen, you think
I came to this town to swing
it around in a chorus line ?

285
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:15,804
Tits and ass. Tits and ass.
That's all they care about. Thank you.

286
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:18,747
Hey, didn't I tell you
to make "horse durves" ?

287
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:22,242
I don't make nothin' out of horses,
especially "horse durves..."

288
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,828
'cause I don't know what
they are, and neither do you !

289
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:28,794
Oh, ain't you the big mouth
since you hit your number.

290
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:33,885
- And I said the imported stuff.
- The imported stuff ate through
the bottle. It's gone !

291
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:36,888
A likely story. It's very hard
to get good help these days.

292
00:17:36,962 --> 00:17:39,711
- Sorry you guys had to hear that.
- I'm feeling fairly dizzy.

293
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:44,380
- Some problems with the firm.
- Really ? What type of firm is it, Nick ?

294
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:48,093
- It's a "don't stick your nose in
other people's business...

295
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:50,812
- And it won't get broken type of firm.
- Yeah.

296
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:53,980
- I see, I see. Thank you.
- That's what kind of firm.

297
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:57,080
I'm feeling a bit unstable.
I think maybe I'll go...

298
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:00,499
and check into a sanitarium
and get the help that I need.

299
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:04,218
- And we'll talk later because
it's been good. Hasn't it, Julian ?
- Yeah.

300
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:06,139
- Oh, yeah.
- It's been good.

301
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:09,336
- This is gonna be
a big event on Broadway.
- Thank you.

302
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:12,186
Absolutely not !
No !

303
00:18:12,252 --> 00:18:15,154
- You'll work with her, mold her.
It'll be a challenge.
- Out of the question !

304
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:18,161
She'll win an award. It'll be a great
show business anecdote.

305
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:22,358
- It will not happen !
- A tribute to you as a director.
You use your actors like clay.

306
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:24,980
Julian, have you lost
all reason ?

307
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:29,235
Do you believe that that woman
could play a psychiatrist ?
That woman ? That thing ?

308
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:31,159
- Her voice, her grasp.
- All right.

309
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:35,926
- She's the woman who picks
quarters off tabletops with...
- Let me level with you.

310
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,775
This is a dog-eat-dog world,
not an ideal world.

311
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:41,686
If you wanna get your play on, you're
gonna have to make a few concessions.

312
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:44,686
Life is not perfect.
Plus, it is short.

313
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,949
If you can't figure that out,
you might as well pack up right
now and go back to Pittsburgh.

314
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,940
I sold out ! I sold out.

315
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:00,109
- I sold out.
- David.

316
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:05,867
- What's wrong ?

317
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:07,913
- I'm a whore !
- Oh, my God !

318
00:19:07,987 --> 00:19:10,954
- I'm a prostitute ! I'm a whore !
- David, pull yourself together.

319
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:12,620
They'll call the police.

320
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:15,144
David. Oh, my God !
You look horrible.

321
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:16,810
Oh, I feel sick.

322
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:21,231
Please, you'll wake the Finkelsteins.
You want an aspirin ?

323
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:25,256
- David. David.
- Oh, my God ! My art ! My work !

324
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:28,110
- What's wrong with you ?
- Do I want success that badly ?

325
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:32,037
- David. Come back to bed.
- The answer's yes. The answer's yes.

326
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:36,005
- Please come back to bed.
- When offered to have my play
backed by a hoodlum, I said yes.

327
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,751
- Please come back to bed.
- It's a deal with the devil,
and the penalty is...

328
00:19:39,822 --> 00:19:43,565
- His girlfriend plays a part.
- Who are you calling at 3:00 a.m. ?

329
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,306
Hello, Julian ? It's David.
Who do you see in the male lead ?

330
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:49,925
Oh, kid.

331
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:52,068
It's 3:00 a.m.

332
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,174
- I see Warner Purcell.
- Nah, too fat.

333
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:59,592
You seen him lately ?
Nah, the man's a compulsive eater.

334
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:01,513
Doesn't matter.
I talked to his agent...

335
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:03,433
and he's been on a new diet
for four months. He looks fine.

336
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:06,084
I want him for Lieutenant Masters.
Then maybe I can live with all this.

337
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:08,127
I can live with
these compromises.

338
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:12,161
I'll have Warner Purcell
and Helen Sinclair, and then
I can live with that gun moll !

339
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:14,980
No, not Warner, kid. No.

340
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:17,252
I had him in Nuns Aplenty.

341
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:21,538
He'll turn over a new leaf. Then he'll
get insecure; he'll start eating.

342
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:25,631
By the time we get to Boston, he'll be
as big as my sister-in-law's ass.

343
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:29,662
No ! No more compromises !
It is my play, and I want him !

344
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:33,212
I want him, and I want him,
and that's it. I'm not a whore !

345
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:36,317
- David, David, David !
- I'm all right.

346
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:39,869
Olive starts rehearsal
for a show next week.

347
00:20:39,941 --> 00:20:41,980
- I want you to stay with her.
- Yeah.

348
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,888
I want you to make sure
they treat her right up there.

349
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:47,712
Those theater characters
I don't trust 'em.

350
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,608
The show's costing me a bundle,
and I'm gonna get my money's worth.

351
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:54,529
- She wants to be a star.
- Yeah. Yeah.

352
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:57,461
- And I promised her.
- Mr. V., look, it's not
that I don't wanna do it...

353
00:20:57,505 --> 00:21:01,727
Cheech, I'm giving you
an order. What do you do ?

354
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,733
I know.

355
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:05,847
Monday, September 10.

356
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,300
Today rehearsals began,
and I've decided to keep a journal.

357
00:21:09,374 --> 00:21:11,894
Perhaps my experience
will be of value to others...

358
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:16,091
just as I pore over with relish
the notes of my idols:
Chekov and Strindberg.

359
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,288
Rehearsals began promptly
at 10:00 a.m.

360
00:21:19,356 --> 00:21:23,066
Warner Purcell was first to arrive
full of bonhomie and good humor.

361
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:26,777
- Good morning !
- Warner Purcell.
Hello, I'm David Shayne.

362
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:29,592
- Oh, David, how marvelous
to meet you. Well done.
- Thank you.

363
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:32,593
- It's a wonderful play.
Some lovely speeches.
- I'm honored you're doing it.

364
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,609
- It's my pleasure.
- Our stage manager, Mitch.

365
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:37,301
- Mitchell Sabine.
I'm here if you need anything.
- Mitchell, nice to meet you.

366
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:39,476
- That's fine.
- And you're gonna be
in dressing room two.

367
00:21:39,547 --> 00:21:41,618
- Lovely.
- And this is my assistant, Lorna.

368
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:44,210
- Pleased to meet you.
- Lorna, nice to meet you.

369
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:47,248
We have coffee and Danish,
some smoked salmon.

370
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:51,347
Um, Mitchell, would it be
frightfully tiresome if I just
had hot water and lemon ?

371
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,485
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

372
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,948
- And of course you know Julian Marx.
- Oh, Julian, yes.

373
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:58,444
- Our swords have crossed.
- Warner, you look wonderful.

374
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:00,526
- And yourself.

375
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:03,446
Eden Brent, who plays
the other woman, arrived second.

376
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,452
She has
a wonderful vivacity.

377
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,168
Good morning ! Good morning !
Don't get up. Don't get up.

378
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:12,239
- I have first-day-rehearsal
presents for everybody.
- How thoughtful.

379
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:16,913
It's nothing. Just some soap and some
potpourri and incense for you, I think.

380
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,013
- Now, have you met Mr. Woofles ?
- No. No.

381
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:23,311
- Oh, don't pull such a sour face.
- Hello, Mr. Woofles.

382
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:25,234
Oh, be careful.
She's a Chihuahua...

383
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:29,192
but there's a pinch of Doberman in her
so sometimes she goes for your throat.

384
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,305
- Just kidding.

385
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:34,825
- I think you've met
everyone here. Lorna.
- We talked on the telephone.

386
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:37,613
I don't know if you've met
our Lieutenant Masters, Warner Purcell.

387
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,982
- Oh, pleased to meet you.
- How was your crossing ?

388
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:43,593
- Well, I came over
five years ago, but it was lovely.

389
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:46,597
Now, my darling, do you want
some milk or something to eat ?

390
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:50,631
- I'll get her a saucer.
- You don't have to bother with
that because I breast-feed her.

391
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:54,247
- Just kidding, everybody.

392
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:56,422
- Please.
- Julian, nice to see you.

393
00:22:56,492 --> 00:22:58,827
- How are you ?
- Mr. Marx.
- Yes, of course.

394
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:01,412
I'm in the middle, yes ?

395
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:04,196
- Should we take the dog...
- No, no, no, no, no.

396
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:06,951
It's my baby.

397
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,794
Olive Neal entered, naturally,
with the force of a hurricane.

398
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:15,049
- Hey, you gonna hover
over me like dead meat ?
- Mr. V. says I stay close.

399
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:16,969
We've been drivin'
around for 15 minutes.

400
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:20,612
I told ya he said the Belasco,
not the Morosco, you cementhead !

401
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:22,151
- Hello, Olive.
- Hello.

402
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:25,282
- Everyone, this is Dr. Philips.
Olive Neal.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

403
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:26,781
- You know Julian.
- Yes.

404
00:23:26,856 --> 00:23:28,766
- My assistant, Lorna.
- Hi.

405
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,880
- Eden Brent, Kristen.
- Ah, cute dog.

406
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,440
- Warner Purcell. Lieutenant Masters.
- Charmed, charmed, charmed.

407
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,845
- Stage manager Mitch.
- Mitch, hi, hi, hi, hi.

408
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,561
- And you are ?
- I'm with her.

409
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,500
- He's with me. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

410
00:23:41,574 --> 00:23:44,836
Well, um, we're just gonna
rehearse for a while, so...

411
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,756
Yeah.
Where she goes, I go.

412
00:23:46,788 --> 00:23:49,657
All right, buster,
why don't you park yourself in
the back row of the theater...

413
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:51,587
and try not to snore.

414
00:23:51,652 --> 00:23:54,019
Um, I...

415
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,951
- What ?
- I don't like other people
watching rehearsals...

416
00:23:57,026 --> 00:24:00,669
- Generally as a rule because
the actors are very sensitive.
- What'd you say ?

417
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:04,033
- I-I don't like...
- Hey, hey, who are you ? Who are you ?

418
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:05,976
- Whoa, whoa. Easy.
- I'm the director.

419
00:24:06,018 --> 00:24:07,392
- Who is this ?
- Wait a minute.

420
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:10,239
- I'm the director of the play.
- Wait a minute, Mr., uh...

421
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:13,054
- Cheech. The name's Cheech.
- Mr. Cheech, first of all...

422
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:15,706
- No, not Mr. Cheech. Ya hear me ?
- Yeah.

423
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:18,591
- Cheech. Simple. Cheech.
- Cheech.

424
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:22,779
Now, why don't you just take a seat
in the back and we'll... Yeah, go ahead.

425
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:25,303
- That's it.
- I find this very problematic.

426
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,447
- I'll be over there.
- He'll be unobtrusive, believe me.

427
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,030
He's not gonna bother anybody.
He just wants to watch.

428
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:33,949
He's my bodyguard.

429
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:36,314
- Hi.
- Hello.

430
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:40,723
- Sorry I'm late.
I'm usually highly professional.
- Oh, I'm sure.

431
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:44,821
- This is for you.
- Oh, talcum powder. My favorite.

432
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,470
- Thank you. You're a doll.
- Oh, no, you're a doll.

433
00:24:48,506 --> 00:24:52,118
Helen Sinclair came a half
hour late, but she had a good excuse.

434
00:24:52,186 --> 00:24:55,600
Please forgive me.
My pedicurist had a stroke.

435
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:59,148
She fell forward onto the orange stick
and plunged it into my toe.

436
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:01,974
- It required bandaging.
- Oh, my poor darling.

437
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,496
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

438
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:07,089
- We all know and admire Helen Sinclair.
- We're old friends.

439
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,810
- Thank you so much.
- Miss Sinclair, this is Mitch.

440
00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:14,734
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, my goodness' sake.
I can't believe I'm here.

441
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:18,580
Oh-ho, look at this.
Look at this. Would you look ?

442
00:25:18,613 --> 00:25:21,199
Oh, this old theater.

443
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,811
This church.

444
00:25:25,877 --> 00:25:28,177
So replete
with memories.

445
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:31,473
So full of ghosts.

446
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:33,776
Mrs. Alving.

447
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:35,730
Uncle Vanya.

448
00:25:36,723 --> 00:25:39,056
There's Cordelia.

449
00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:42,119
Here's Ophelia.

450
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:45,838
Clytemenstra !

451
00:25:47,344 --> 00:25:49,711
Each performance
a birth.

452
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:52,972
Each curtain...

453
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,014
a death.

454
00:25:57,744 --> 00:25:59,849
Was that a mutt ?

455
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,439
Yes, Miss Sinclair.

456
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:06,470
- I hate mutts !

457
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:09,410
I didn't want to overwhelm
any of the actors on the first day...

458
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,006
so all we did
was read through the play.

459
00:26:12,077 --> 00:26:14,181
I can't live
like this.

460
00:26:14,252 --> 00:26:17,569
The same routine
over and over and over.

461
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:19,914
The days blend together
like melted celluloid.

462
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,395
Like a film whose images
become distorted and meaningless.

463
00:26:23,468 --> 00:26:26,565
I want a divorce, Sylvia. I've said it
in a thousand subtle ways...

464
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:29,569
hoping you would realize,
but you refuse to see it.

465
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:32,489
As a little girl,
I swore one day...

466
00:26:32,554 --> 00:26:35,749
I would have a necklace
made from the Milky Way.

467
00:26:35,816 --> 00:26:40,933
Oh, Kristen, Kristen, if only humans
weren't cursed with the power of memory.

468
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:44,512
Dreams are only disguised feelings.

469
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:48,705
The more we bring these
painful experiences to the fore...

470
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,522
the easier they become
to deal with.

471
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,045
- What's the "fore" ?
- The fore. The foreground.

472
00:26:54,118 --> 00:26:56,126
- Is it... Could I ?
- Please.

473
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,972
It's a golf term, when you yell, "fore"
when you're coming forward.

474
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:03,648
- I didn't realize that.
- So you're telling me
she's talking about golf ?

475
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:04,927
- Continue !
- What ?

476
00:27:04,996 --> 00:27:07,516
Oh, yes, okay. Doctor...

477
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:10,653
am I unattractive,
worn out ?

478
00:27:10,722 --> 00:27:14,684
Spent ? Broken ?
Desiccated ? Old ?

479
00:27:14,755 --> 00:27:18,846
Come, come, Mrs. Poston.
You're being mas...

480
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,919
- Mas...
- Masochistic.

481
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:26,687
- Masochistic ?
- Yes, masochism is someone
who enjoys pain.

482
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:29,535
- As opposed to sadism.
- Enjoys pain ?

483
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,640
What is she,
retarded ?

484
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,646
- I don't fuckin' believe this !
- Continue.

485
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,817
After the rehearsal I felt exhilarated.

486
00:27:38,046 --> 00:27:40,435
Helen Sinclair suggested
we go for a drink to unwind.

487
00:27:40,478 --> 00:27:44,568
She said she knew
of a little out-of-the-way
speakeasy where we could talk.

488
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:47,163
- It was wonderful to see old, uh...
- Wasn't it ?

489
00:27:47,228 --> 00:27:50,544
- Warner. Yes.
- Warner, yeah. He looks so slim.

490
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:53,589
- He's on a new diet.
- Who is she ? Oh, I need a drink.

491
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:55,699
Olive
Yes. I'm sorry about Olive.

492
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:58,388
I do apologize.
We needed her to raise the money.

493
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:00,695
It must be difficult
getting a work like this on.

494
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,129
It's a sad reality
of the marketplace, I'll tell ya.

495
00:28:03,194 --> 00:28:05,529
- We've never really
had a chance to talk.
- No.

496
00:28:05,595 --> 00:28:09,041
- Hi, folks. What can I get you ?
- Two martinis, please, very dry.

497
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:12,310
- How'd you know what I drank ?
- Oh, you want one too ?

498
00:28:12,346 --> 00:28:14,254
- Three.
- Three martinis.

499
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:17,677
Uh, I can't judge my own writing,
but I must say...

500
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:21,744
that just from today's reading,
I can tell how brilliant
you're going to be in this role.

501
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:23,604
- It's a wonderful play.
- Thank you.

502
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:27,566
No, no, I mean it. It's so rare
that anything is really about something.

503
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,452
You know... Well, there's Max Anderson
and Gene O'Neill.

504
00:28:30,517 --> 00:28:32,938
- That's about it.
- You just named my two living gods.

505
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:35,829
I was a little reluctant at first
to play the part.

506
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:39,983
The character is so...
She's so, um... uh, colorless.

507
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,644
Colorless, yes.
Well, that's the idea...

508
00:28:41,715 --> 00:28:43,625
- Then I realized what
you were going for.
- You did ?

509
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:45,772
How profound, how complex,
her inner life really is.

510
00:28:45,843 --> 00:28:48,210
I tried to give her
some contradictions.

511
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:50,163
I was worried.

512
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:54,055
I'm used to playing
more overtly heroic women.

513
00:28:54,098 --> 00:28:56,781
Less tentative.
More alluring.

514
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:59,150
Certainly not
frigid.

515
00:28:59,216 --> 00:29:04,234
No, yes, yes. Well, Sylvia Poston
is a mass of neuroses.

516
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:08,359
In spite of the fact that I
could really find nothing at all
in the play to brighten her up...

517
00:29:08,432 --> 00:29:11,432
- No real passion, no seductiveness...
- Nothing ?

518
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:13,708
I still think that
she's worth playing.

519
00:29:13,776 --> 00:29:17,668
We could work it over, and
a touch here or there could be
changed to make sure you're...

520
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:20,870
- No, no, no, no.
I wouldn't dream of you...
- Comfortable.

521
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:23,363
Changing a word
of your work for me.

522
00:29:23,438 --> 00:29:28,422
God, who am l, some
vain Broadway legend ?

523
00:29:28,492 --> 00:29:32,070
You... you're
a budding Chekhov.

524
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:40,032
I'm not saying I'll distort the play.
I'm just saying I'll reread it
with that in mind.

525
00:29:40,106 --> 00:29:43,040
I mean, after all, Miss Sinclair...
Helen. May I call you Helen ?

526
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:45,153
- Yes.
- Helen...

527
00:29:45,226 --> 00:29:48,225
your instincts as an actress
are impeccable.

528
00:29:48,296 --> 00:29:52,835
And I want the character
to have dimension. I don't mean
for her to be a drone.

529
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:56,929
- You see through me, don't you ?
- Me ?

530
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:59,202
You're clever.

531
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,409
You're brilliant.

532
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:03,968
What insight
into women.

533
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:06,013
Don't deny it.

534
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,788
I don't see why
she has to be frigid.

535
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:21,249
Hey, how ya doin', doll ?
How'd it go ?

536
00:30:21,284 --> 00:30:23,487
Ah, they're all
so stuck up.

537
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,304
- Yeah ? Anybody botherin' her ?
- No.

538
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,087
They expect me to memorize
all these lines.

539
00:30:29,123 --> 00:30:32,767
- Well, that's what you wanted,
isn't it ? To be an actress ?
- I know, I know, I know.

540
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:36,216
- I got a headache.
- Cheech'll help you
practice after we eat.

541
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:39,736
- Me ?
- The girl's got stuff
to memorize, all right ?

542
00:30:39,808 --> 00:30:42,940
- Yeah, but, Nick...
- Go sit in the tub, honey. Go ahead.

543
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:46,586
I'm takin' you out to Delmonico's.
You want sirloin or a lobster ?

544
00:30:46,656 --> 00:30:50,168
- One of each.
- Listen, Nick, I'm not too good
at this memorizing, and I got a date...

545
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:53,948
All right, all right, knock it off.
I got a little errand for you to run.

546
00:30:54,014 --> 00:30:58,650
- What kind of errand ?
- A message for Charlie Masucci,
and we ain't got a lot of time.

547
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:21,360
Up a lazy river
where the old mill run

548
00:31:21,402 --> 00:31:26,037
Meets lazy, lazy river
in the noonday sun

549
00:31:26,072 --> 00:31:30,610
Linger in the shade
of a kind old tree

550
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:33,363
Throw away your troubles
Dream a dream...

551
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:39,567
- Up a lazy river
where the robin's song

552
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:41,645
Awakes a bright
new morning...

553
00:31:41,878 --> 00:31:44,148
Can't you see...

554
00:31:44,182 --> 00:31:47,248
you're living out
the exact same pattern...

555
00:31:47,318 --> 00:31:49,903
your mother lived out
with your father ?

556
00:31:49,973 --> 00:31:52,938
I am ?
Pray tell.

557
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:56,241
In some way,
you're trying to relive it,

558
00:31:56,308 --> 00:32:00,202
and in the process
of reliving it, correct it.

559
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:03,625
As if that were possible.
Ha !

560
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,798
- It don't say "Ha."
-I know it don't say "Ha." I added that.

561
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:09,932
- What do ya mean you added that ?
Are you allowed to do that ?
- We're allowed to add things.

562
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:12,303
- How could you add something ?
You can't do that.
- You're allowed !

563
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:14,704
- It's called ad-libbing.
- You can't do that !

564
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:17,997
I can do that. What do you know ? You
don't know nothin'. Shut up and read.

565
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:21,511
- I think the whole thing stinks.
- I think you're a degenerate
zombie. Shut up and read !

566
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:24,169
- You better shut up ! Just shut up !
- You shut up and read.

567
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:27,052
- You shut up !
- You're lucky you're Nick's girl.

568
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:28,973
You're lucky
you're an idiot.

569
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:33,707
What endeavors you...
to concoct a theory so tenuous ?

570
00:32:33,742 --> 00:32:35,400
Mmm-mmm-mm.

571
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:39,458
I sure pities the poor folks who gonna
have to pay to see this play.

572
00:32:41,547 --> 00:32:45,322
- What ya thinking ?
- Oh, just about Eugene O'Neill
and Max Anderson, you know.

573
00:32:45,387 --> 00:32:48,649
Yeah. You've been rewriting all night
and it's only just the first day.

574
00:32:48,715 --> 00:32:50,983
- Is that a bad sign ?
- No. I just think that
I might have made...

575
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,319
the character of Sylvia Poston
a bit too antiseptic.

576
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:55,361
- She's gotta have a sexual side to her.
- No.

577
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:59,657
- I think she's the best female
character you've written in a long time.
- Says who ?

578
00:32:59,723 --> 00:33:02,950
David, you know you always have
problems getting into the female mind.

579
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:06,813
- I know that you think that.
- You've said so yourself before.
We've had this discussion.

580
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:11,296
All your friends are men. You... You've
always had problems writing for women.

581
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:14,050
Witness your relationship
with your mother, your grandmother...

582
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:17,086
- Your two aunts, your sister...
- I think I try to factor that
into my work.

583
00:33:17,158 --> 00:33:19,013
But to be honest with you...

584
00:33:19,078 --> 00:33:20,932
at this moment, I don't think
you really understand my work at all.

585
00:33:20,997 --> 00:33:22,972
- Oh ! Don't be so defensive.
- I'm not being defensive.

586
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:26,819
Perhaps my opinions just aren't
intellectual enough for you.
Maybe they're just not...

587
00:33:26,884 --> 00:33:30,878
That's a horrible thing to say.
When you have a good idea,
I listen to it. I'm responsive.

588
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:34,265
- In this case, I think you're
wrong. That's about it.
- When am I right ?

589
00:33:34,338 --> 00:33:37,634
You're right about other things, but not
about Sylvia Poston and her sexuality.

590
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:41,114
September 17.
The first week is behind me now...

591
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:44,864
and apart from a few minor incidents,
things seemed to go okay.

592
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,263
There was that moment
between Helen and Eden.

593
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:51,071
I can't do that speech if she's
going to be fidgeting around upstage !

594
00:33:51,137 --> 00:33:53,625
- Well, that's why I think
I should sit. I'll sit.
- Oh, God !

595
00:33:53,697 --> 00:33:57,175
Sylvia would never ask her to sit
in her own house. She despises her !

596
00:33:57,247 --> 00:34:00,760
She doesn't want me to sit. She doesn't
want me to stand. I guess I could squat.

597
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,898
David, do you realize you're asking an
audience to believe that my husband...

598
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:05,845
would leave me
for this woman ?

599
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,659
- Come along.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, but
I think it's made very clear...

600
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:12,343
in the speech about erotic attraction,
why he does that.

601
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:14,940
You fool ! He's thinking of me
when he does that speech.
Don't you know anything ?

602
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:17,339
- Only the part about the liver spots.
- Listen.

603
00:34:17,404 --> 00:34:21,200
How long has it been since
you've had a real hemorrhage ?

604
00:34:21,243 --> 00:34:25,105
David, I wonder if now would be a moment
to do my soliloquy from Act II ?

605
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:30,001
- Did you hear what she...
- Please. Aspirin !

606
00:34:30,044 --> 00:34:33,654
All right, yes, why don't we ?
And, Eden, just take five.

607
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,275
- I need an aspirin !

608
00:34:36,345 --> 00:34:39,160
Mitch.

609
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:42,639
Then there was the time when
I tried to cut one of Olive's speeches.

610
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:46,607
- I like that speech,
and I already got it memorized.
- But it's superfluous.

611
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,298
- It's... What is it ?
- Well, I've overwritten it.

612
00:34:49,368 --> 00:34:53,524
We know how you feel
about Sylvia's breakdown when
you talk with the good doctor.

613
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,274
So it's my fault.
Um, the performance is fine.

614
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:59,309
But, um...
I like to say it.

615
00:34:59,382 --> 00:35:01,770
- We... We don't need it.
- Hey !

616
00:35:01,845 --> 00:35:04,747
Are you tryin' to make
my part smaller ?

617
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:07,275
- No, no, every...
- My part's small enough as it is !

618
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:10,795
Every play needs some cuts, and the size
of the role is not the important thing.

619
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:14,315
Did you hear what she said ? She doesn't
want her speech taken away from her !

620
00:35:14,387 --> 00:35:18,761
- Look, look, Mr. Cheech, I've about...
- I'd rather be shootin' crap myself...

621
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:23,241
but Mr. V. told me that she's gotta
be up there a lot !

622
00:35:23,313 --> 00:35:25,834
- I wrote this play,
and I'm directing this play !
- I don't care.

623
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:29,701
You wanna get slapped here or do
you want me to take you outside
and we'll straighten this out ?

624
00:35:29,776 --> 00:35:32,361
It's up to you.

625
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:39,082
Warner Purcell remains
good-spirited and a joy to work with.

626
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:44,268
And what discipline. Although,
I notice he no longer has just
a cup of hot water and lemon.

627
00:35:46,415 --> 00:35:50,189
Lf you start it off
at that level...

628
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:54,791
Well, what are we going to do
about that canine-loving ingenue ?

629
00:35:54,828 --> 00:35:57,643
- Did you cast her because
you thought she was attractive ?
- She's pretty...

630
00:35:57,708 --> 00:36:01,188
but more importantly, she has a certain
perkiness that the character requires.

631
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,001
She's perky. She makes you
wanna sneak up behind her with
a pillow and suffocate her.

632
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:07,335
- It's a beautiful apartment.
- Josette.

633
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:10,118
- My beaker of martinis.
- Your taste is exquisite.

634
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:14,430
My taste is superb.
My eyes are exquisite.

635
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:16,545
What justifiable confidence.

636
00:36:16,585 --> 00:36:19,999
- I think at some point you're
going to have to fire Olive.
- I'm afraid that's not possible.

637
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:24,606
Oh, how can you take her butchering
your poetry ? I know I couldn't stand it.

638
00:36:24,678 --> 00:36:28,606
No one in his right mind is
going to believe she's a doctor,
not even a veterinarian.

639
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:31,772
- I understand, but it's a compromise
I have to live with...

640
00:36:31,846 --> 00:36:34,148
and if I want the play to open,
I have to find a way to live with it.

641
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:36,634
I plan on reducing the scope of her role
if her bodyguard will let me.

642
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,563
Can you believe
that character ?

643
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,596
Imagine, traveling with
your own private Neanderthal.

644
00:36:41,669 --> 00:36:44,483
- I wasn't aware that you opened
The Master Builder.
- Oh, well.

645
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:47,646
I had forgotten that
you won that drama award.

646
00:36:47,715 --> 00:36:50,465
- Here's to your play.
- Oh, thank you. Our play.

647
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:54,176
To an ideal world
with no compromise.

648
00:36:58,305 --> 00:37:01,153
Oh, my gosh,
look at this view !

649
00:37:01,217 --> 00:37:05,755
A million blinking lights.
A million broken hearts.

650
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:08,246
- You know what's down there ?
- What ?

651
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:11,254
- Broadway.
- Ah. That's your street.

652
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:16,182
Mm-hmm. Yes, that's my street,
but I'd like to give it to you.

653
00:37:16,255 --> 00:37:20,052
- That is, if you want it.
- Who wouldn't want it ?

654
00:37:20,127 --> 00:37:23,738
I want you to write a play for me.
Oh, I mean when all this is over.

655
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:27,418
- Really ?
- Your next play, I want you to create
a vehicle for Helen Sinclair.

656
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:30,551
- I'm honored.
- But it must have size...

657
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:32,659
an important woman.

658
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:36,244
- A Borgia. A Curie. You name it.
- Yes !

659
00:37:36,315 --> 00:37:39,130
- I'll dedicate myself to it.
- Oh, and while you're at it...

660
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:42,326
if you could just have
a look at that scene in Act ll.

661
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:46,389
If she succeeds in seducing
the Lieutenant instead of
being rejected a second time...

662
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:51,571
- It could add some variation
to the character.
- Yes, that's a wonderful idea.

663
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:53,999
The heart is "labyrinthinine..."

664
00:37:54,073 --> 00:37:58,229
a maze beset with brutal pitfalls
and mean obstacles.

665
00:37:58,296 --> 00:38:02,517
David, I can't say that line. It doesn't
make sense. It's stupid. I don't get it.

666
00:38:02,582 --> 00:38:06,096
- It's just a stylish way
of expressing a particular idea.
- Idea ? What idea ?

667
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,206
The agony of love.
The difficulty of relating.

668
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,830
- Why do you have to make it
so hard to say ?
- Just say the line.

669
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:13,771
- No, I can't say it.
It's a mouthful of "ghibberish."
- Gibberish !

670
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:16,497
- I can't say it, and I will not say it.
- Just do the line.

671
00:38:16,566 --> 00:38:18,419
No ! I'm not making
a fool of myself.

672
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:20,339
She's right, it stinks.

673
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:22,738
Oh-ho, Jesus,
another party heard from.

674
00:38:22,772 --> 00:38:25,324
It's a stupid way of talkin',
and nobody talks like that.

675
00:38:25,395 --> 00:38:27,665
- I don't believe this is happening.
- Frankenstein is right.

676
00:38:27,892 --> 00:38:29,800
When I want your opinion,
I will ask for it.

677
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:32,461
I can't stand to listen to this
garbage. Every day I sit back there...

678
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:34,382
and I hear the same bullshit
over and over again.

679
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:36,302
Then leave.
No one asked you here.

680
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,124
Oh, David, take it easy.

681
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:40,462
Where did you study play writing ?
Was it Sing Sing ?

682
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:42,765
"A maze beset
by brutal pitfalls..."

683
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,288
Hey, Olive, I memorized it,
and I'm tellin' ya...

684
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,655
it comes to me all the time,
and it stinks on fuckin' hot ice !

685
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,565
- That's it. I quit. This is crazy.
- David.

686
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:55,177
- Oh, please, I have a little hangover !
- I am famished.

687
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:58,181
Everyone, everyone,
why don't we take lunch ? An hour ?

688
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:01,003
- You don't wanna
say the goddamned line...

689
00:39:01,037 --> 00:39:04,134
- Don't say the goddamned line !
- Oh, look at you, Mr. Temperamental.

690
00:39:04,365 --> 00:39:07,812
Lf that rat on a leash
barks one more time...

691
00:39:07,884 --> 00:39:10,666
- He sounds melancholy. Is he melancholy ?
- You can trim the line.

692
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:14,048
- Because she can't handle it ?
- Because you said yourself
you were having trouble with it.

693
00:39:14,122 --> 00:39:16,261
- So you agree with the gorilla ?
- David, for Christ sake ! It's one line !

694
00:39:16,331 --> 00:39:18,436
- It's not going to wreck the scene.
- That's not the point !

695
00:39:18,474 --> 00:39:21,790
Suddenly I'm taking suggestions from a
strong-arm man with an I.Q. Of minus 50.

696
00:39:21,866 --> 00:39:23,753
I've had it !

697
00:39:23,786 --> 00:39:26,948
- David, for goodness' sake. Come on.
- Look who's here.

698
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:29,734
Oh, God !
Get my rifle !

699
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:33,183
I guess I'm just hypersensitive because
maybe deep down, I agree with the goon.

700
00:39:33,257 --> 00:39:37,478
- Maybe it is a turgid line.
I don't know. My nerves are shot.
- No. Just calm yourself.

701
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:42,017
Helen, the play is not working.
It's not working, and it's in my
writing. It's not just Olive.

702
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:46,113
That's the reason we have rehearsal.
That's the reason we go out of town.

703
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:51,355
You have such a wonderful attitude.
I'm so lucky.

704
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:53,949
The best part of this project every day
is that I get to come to work...

705
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:56,803
and see you and be with you
and work with you.

706
00:39:56,868 --> 00:40:01,176
- I don't mean to spoil the day.
- Then let's not.

707
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:04,414
Sit down here.
I'm going to show you something.

708
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:06,304
Okay.

709
00:40:07,331 --> 00:40:10,081
This is my favorite spot
in the park.

710
00:40:12,002 --> 00:40:15,100
And in winter,
when it's covered with snow...

711
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:19,675
at about 4:30 in the afternoon,
when it's just getting dark
and the lights come on...

712
00:40:19,713 --> 00:40:21,600
it's all misty.

713
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:26,365
And you can just see the silhouettes of
the Manhattan skyline through the trees.

714
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:28,821
And it's magical.

715
00:40:28,896 --> 00:40:31,132
It's magical.

716
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,286
Helen, I think I'm falling
in love with you.

717
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:37,241
Don't.

718
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:41,299
- I don't know if I can help it.
- David, please, we must be strong.

719
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:44,786
I've kept a check on my feelings
for so long, but there's
so much that I want to say.

720
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,347
- What are words ?
- Oh, gosh.

721
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,551
David, everything meaningful
is in some unexplainable form.

722
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:54,710
It's... It's more primordial
than mere language.

723
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:57,046
- I'm not sure I follow that one.
- Oh, be silent.

724
00:40:57,114 --> 00:40:59,001
- Be silent.
- Helen...

725
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:02,032
No, let's just sit here
holding our thoughts.

726
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:04,823
Not revealing them.
Be still.

727
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:09,460
Let the birds have their song.
Let ours for now remain unsung.

728
00:41:09,528 --> 00:41:11,567
You're amazing.

729
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,381
Ain't Misbehavin

730
00:41:18,424 --> 00:41:20,047
Stop it.
Stop it.

731
00:41:20,118 --> 00:41:22,736
- I'm not in the mood !
- What do you mean
you're not in the mood ?

732
00:41:22,806 --> 00:41:24,912
Honey, you better get in the mood,
'cause he's payin' the rent.

733
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:28,659
Shut up, Venus !
Just what I said: I'm not in the mood.

734
00:41:28,726 --> 00:41:33,133
- Do I have to be in the mood
every time you are ?
- Stop puttin' on the airs.

735
00:41:33,173 --> 00:41:36,336
- I'm not puttin' on airs.
- I never knew you when you wasn't
ready for a little action.

736
00:41:36,373 --> 00:41:40,169
Well, today, I'm not ready for action.
I'm tired. Rehearsal is hard.

737
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:43,177
- Get your motor goin'.
- No !

738
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,249
- Hey, I brought you somethin'.
- What ?

739
00:41:46,322 --> 00:41:49,420
- Huh ?
- Hmm.

740
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:51,377
What do ya say ?
Come on.

741
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,343
- Nickie.
- Oh, I got a great bottle
of French wine.

742
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:56,303
Joey Foster made it himself.

743
00:41:56,369 --> 00:41:58,735
Pasadena. I'm pooped.

744
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:01,037
Let's misbehave

745
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:04,136
There's something wild
about you, child...

746
00:42:04,174 --> 00:42:06,444
Today, Ellen came to watch rehearsal.

747
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:10,023
She was very excited to meet the cast,
especially Warner Purcell.

748
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:14,633
- Warner, Warner, Warner.
This is Ellen. My girlfriend.
- Oh ! Pleased to meet you.

749
00:42:14,702 --> 00:42:18,345
- You should be very proud.
He has a rare talent.
- Yes, he does.

750
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:21,162
The morning proceeded
very smoothly for the first half hour.

751
00:42:21,197 --> 00:42:23,084
And then
another incident occurred.

752
00:42:23,149 --> 00:42:27,009
The heart obeys
its own rules. Ha !

753
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:31,360
As a doctor, your respect for
rationalities is not very profound.

754
00:42:31,435 --> 00:42:33,290
- David, I... David, can I...
- Yes ?

755
00:42:33,355 --> 00:42:36,967
I don't understand the character here.
Suddenly, she's too wise.

756
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:41,027
And, David, I don't know why she's
telling her to dump her fiance.

757
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:43,525
- She's caught up with the Lieutenant.
- The Lieutenant ?

758
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,179
But it's as if she's just mouthing
the playwright's philosophy.

759
00:42:46,248 --> 00:42:49,312
- Why would she just up and leave Tom ?
- Because she's impulsive.

760
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,766
- It doesn't feel right.
- Well, yeah, and I don't
understand, you know...

761
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:56,002
if I'm a doctor, how come
I'm giving her such bad advice ?

762
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:58,079
- It's not bad advice.
- It is bad advice.

763
00:42:58,151 --> 00:43:01,946
But, David, you see, in Act I,
she says that Tom changed her life.

764
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:05,436
- Yes, but she's recklessly
driven to the Lieutenant.
- It doesn't make sense.

765
00:43:05,509 --> 00:43:07,713
- Just give it a chance.
- There's something
contradictory about it.

766
00:43:07,781 --> 00:43:10,050
- Just give it a chance.
- It's just bad writing.

767
00:43:10,117 --> 00:43:12,635
I'll tell ya what's wrong.

768
00:43:12,707 --> 00:43:15,261
- Oh, Christ ! Julian ?
- Now let's wait a minute.

769
00:43:15,332 --> 00:43:19,009
- Let's not get into a situation here.
- She shouldn't leave the guy.

770
00:43:19,076 --> 00:43:21,116
She should stick with him.

771
00:43:21,187 --> 00:43:25,147
Then when the Lieutenant has
that fight with his wife and
walks out, he should notice her.

772
00:43:25,218 --> 00:43:27,770
That way,
it won't be boring.

773
00:43:35,711 --> 00:43:39,006
Somebody say something !

774
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,387
- I think it's a good idea.
- It's not a bad one.

775
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,602
- You're kidding.
- Oh, no.

776
00:43:44,671 --> 00:43:46,742
It's, uh...
It really isn't.

777
00:43:46,813 --> 00:43:49,660
Personally, I like it.
I think it's very dramatic.

778
00:43:49,725 --> 00:43:52,595
Ellen, do you see what I'm up against ?
Do you see what I have to put up with ?

779
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:55,452
- I think he has an interesting concept.
- What ?

780
00:43:55,517 --> 00:43:57,621
Not to say that...

781
00:43:57,692 --> 00:44:00,081
- She doesn't leave the Lieutenant.
- Right.

782
00:44:00,156 --> 00:44:02,097
- She doesn't leave her fiance.
- Right.

783
00:44:02,171 --> 00:44:05,334
We lose that scene, and suddenly
a lot of good possibilities open up.

784
00:44:05,403 --> 00:44:08,153
- It's a helluva lot
better than what you got.
- I actually like it.

785
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,607
- You're taking his side ?
- It's not a question of sides.

786
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:13,911
- David, she's right.
The play always bogged down there.
- Try it.

787
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:17,742
- That's why the actors
always looked so uncomfortable.
- I can't make those changes.

788
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:22,039
- Why not ? H-H-How do they meet again ?
- Because the...

789
00:44:22,105 --> 00:44:26,261
The Lieutenant notices her, right ?
And then, he goes after her.

790
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:30,093
I mean, that's the way
it would happen in real life.
He goes after her. Come on.

791
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:34,192
You can't force it, kid. I mean, if it's
meant to go in a whole other direction...

792
00:44:34,262 --> 00:44:37,578
- I quit !
- Oh, don't be so egotistical.

793
00:44:37,654 --> 00:44:39,726
- I'm outta here.
- Egotistical ? Why ?
Because I protect my play ?

794
00:44:39,798 --> 00:44:43,179
- Protect it against what ? A good idea ?
- Oh, thank you for the support.

795
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,285
- No, no, I quit ! That's it. Good-bye.
- I'm gonna go shoot crap.

796
00:44:46,355 --> 00:44:48,461
- That's it. I quit.
- Wait a minute.

797
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:51,347
David. David !

798
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,485
- I'm gonna go shoot crap.
- David.

799
00:44:53,716 --> 00:44:56,781
- Mommy's coming.

800
00:44:56,851 --> 00:45:01,606
If an artist can, it gives us all a
much better chance, and he is an artist.

801
00:45:01,649 --> 00:45:04,912
- Is that why he's getting all hot
and bothered all the time ?
- Artists are very emotional.

802
00:45:04,978 --> 00:45:07,627
- Artists are emotional, are they ?
- Yes, they are.

803
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:10,348
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask ya...

804
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:14,989
is it my imagination
or are you always... Iookin' my way ?

805
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:17,903
- You're a very observant girl.
Yes, I have been looking at you.
- Thank you.

806
00:45:17,935 --> 00:45:20,804
Yeah, well, I notice somethin'.
I notice you have...

807
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:23,978
a really
big appetite.

808
00:45:24,046 --> 00:45:27,342
- Yes, I do have a big appetite.
- Yeah, I noticed that, but...

809
00:45:27,406 --> 00:45:29,379
- Where's your baby-sitter ?
- What, Cheech ?

810
00:45:29,453 --> 00:45:32,300
- Yes.
- Ah, you don't have to worry
about Cheech. He took off.

811
00:45:32,364 --> 00:45:36,226
- Did he ?
- A minute there's a chance,
he runs off to play craps.

812
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,560
- Takes about two hours.
- Well, listen, now that
you've been let off the leash...

813
00:45:39,786 --> 00:45:42,154
- Yeah ?
- Why don't we go in...

814
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:45,349
- And get to know each other
a bit better ?
- Okay.

815
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:48,001
That might be pleasant.

816
00:45:52,809 --> 00:45:54,401
- Well.

817
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:56,327
- Hi.
- Hi.

818
00:45:56,392 --> 00:45:58,497
Hi.

819
00:46:01,096 --> 00:46:03,550
- You're a very attr...
Wait just a minute.
- What ? What ? What ?

820
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,267
- Before we start...
- Yeah ?

821
00:46:07,336 --> 00:46:09,539
- What ? Oh.
- Just a...

822
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:12,510
A little poultry.
Okay.

823
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,436
- All right. Let's go.
- All right.

824
00:46:14,502 --> 00:46:16,890
You do have a big appetite.

825
00:46:16,965 --> 00:46:20,282
- Pull yourself together.
So he came up with a good idea.

826
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:22,659
- Helen, not you too ?
- If you did follow his suggestion...

827
00:46:22,725 --> 00:46:25,854
you'd be able to put in that new scene
in Act Ill that you've always wanted to.

828
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:29,698
- Yes, but it'd...
- And that, that casts
a whole new light...

829
00:46:29,763 --> 00:46:32,064
on my relationship
with my husband. Yes !

830
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:34,651
So you're saying
you want me to change it ?

831
00:46:34,723 --> 00:46:37,983
At the risk of seeing you
upset on your birthday.

832
00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:40,602
- How did you know it was my birthday ?
- Happy birthday.

833
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:43,739
- Helen ! Ohh.
- Open it.

834
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:46,297
Gosh !

835
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:49,532
Oh, gosh.
Really. It's...

836
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,217
Don't get too excited.
I didn't buy it.

837
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:55,134
Cole Porter gave it to me.
It's one of many.

838
00:46:55,198 --> 00:46:57,687
- Now I'm gonna have to take up smoking.
- Hmm.

839
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,693
Have a good time tonight
with your girlfriend.
I'm sure she's taking you out.

840
00:47:00,766 --> 00:47:04,694
- Yes, with the Marxes.
- Yes, well... make a birthday wish.

841
00:47:04,766 --> 00:47:09,370
- I have.
- I hope you get everything
in life that you want.

842
00:47:09,438 --> 00:47:11,292
Helen, have you thought
about what I said before...

843
00:47:11,324 --> 00:47:13,462
- About the way I feel ?
- Don't speak.

844
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,816
- But I want to express...
- Don't speak. Don't.

845
00:47:19,324 --> 00:47:21,177
- Just a few things I want to tell you.
- Don't speak.

846
00:47:21,242 --> 00:47:24,057
- When we first met
- No, no. Don't speak.

847
00:47:24,122 --> 00:47:27,057
Please don't speak.
Please don't speak.

848
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,907
No ! No !
No ! Go !

849
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:33,653
Go, gentle Scorpio, go !

850
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,910
Your Pisces wishes you
every happy return.

851
00:47:38,584 --> 00:47:40,788
- Just one...
- Don't speak !

852
00:47:43,064 --> 00:47:46,860
- Wow, a wallet !

853
00:47:46,903 --> 00:47:49,772
- That's appropriate.
- It was the nicest one I saw by far.

854
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:52,977
- The piping. That's real leather.
- Places to put stuff in there.

855
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:54,929
- You like it ?
- It's amazing. Beautiful.

856
00:47:55,156 --> 00:47:57,066
- You like it ?
- Yes, really.

857
00:47:57,108 --> 00:48:00,906
- Now all I need is some money,
and it'll hold its shape.
- You will prosper, my friend.

858
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:04,015
- I promise
Am I right, Hilda ?
- No, I love it.

859
00:48:04,085 --> 00:48:07,312
- Can I pick 'em or can I pick 'em ?
- Oh, you sure can, Julian.

860
00:48:07,379 --> 00:48:10,248
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks for spending it with me.

861
00:48:10,482 --> 00:48:12,719
- Oh, it's wonderful.
- Hilda, touch glasses there.

862
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:19,432
Hey, look who's here
with his girlfriend.

863
00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:22,636
- Oh, no.
- I owe that big Gorgonzola an apology.

864
00:48:22,704 --> 00:48:27,111
What are you talking about ?
Now that he's drunk, he's gonna
apologize to everyone. Strangers.

865
00:48:27,152 --> 00:48:31,242
Today at rehearsal,
he came up with that little
suggestion, and I overreacted.

866
00:48:31,311 --> 00:48:34,955
I let my ego get in the way of the work,
and I feel I owe him an apology.

867
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:38,405
- Ah, you're all right.
You handled it very well.
- I'll be right back.

868
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:49,191
I take it all back. It was a good
suggestion, and I apologize.

869
00:48:49,261 --> 00:48:51,170
- Say hello to Violet.
- Hi, Violet.

870
00:48:51,244 --> 00:48:53,796
- Hi, nice to meet you.
Who's this, Cheech ?
- He's a writer.

871
00:48:53,867 --> 00:48:57,577
- I'm a struggling writer.
- You wanna know what the problem
with your story is ?

872
00:48:57,644 --> 00:49:01,538
- What's the problem ?
Are you gonna do some more rewrites ?
- Sit down. Take a load off your feet.

873
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:05,190
- Moe, go on. Come here. Get him a beer.
- Why not ?

874
00:49:05,226 --> 00:49:07,135
- He's a writer ?
- Yeah.

875
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:10,341
- I didn't know you knew writers.
- Do me a favor. Shut up.

876
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:12,264
Don't tell me
to shut up.

877
00:49:12,297 --> 00:49:14,565
All right,
number one.

878
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:17,791
See, I don't believe she loves
the guy right from the start.

879
00:49:17,863 --> 00:49:21,179
She's too on, uh, top of him
all the time. That's not love.

880
00:49:21,255 --> 00:49:24,899
That's like keeping somebody in prison.
But if you changed it, right ?

881
00:49:24,967 --> 00:49:27,649
And she left him,
then she would feel so bad about it...

882
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:31,426
- That she would have the
nervous breakdown and go nuts.

883
00:49:31,493 --> 00:49:34,144
- How ya doin', Cheech ?
- Tulio, listen, I gotta see you later.

884
00:49:34,213 --> 00:49:37,528
- I wanna get down on the Cardinals
for the doubleheader, all right ?
- You got it.

885
00:49:37,604 --> 00:49:41,695
- Them birds look good.
- Teach your friend some manners
and get him outta here.

886
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:44,121
- All right, so...
- You were... You were talking about...

887
00:49:44,196 --> 00:49:46,683
Right, all right.
So, now...

888
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:50,648
if the doctor feels what Sylvia's
feelin'... That's her name, Sylvia.

889
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:52,959
- There's a Sylvia in my neighborhood.
- Oh, yeah ?

890
00:49:53,186 --> 00:49:56,317
- Yeah. What was her name ? Sylvia Pincus.
- Sylvia Pincus.

891
00:49:56,386 --> 00:49:59,037
Sylvia Pincus. Big, fat Jewish broad,
had a little tiny husband.

892
00:49:59,106 --> 00:50:01,821
She chopped him up with an ax and mailed
his pieces all over the country.

893
00:50:01,888 --> 00:50:04,124
I don't know what
she was tryin' to prove.

894
00:50:04,191 --> 00:50:06,046
That's disgusting. You gotta
tell that story in front of me ?

895
00:50:06,112 --> 00:50:07,671
- Relax.
- You know I got a weak stomach.

896
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,111
- You were tellin' me
about the play a minute ago.
- Don't interrupt me.

897
00:50:10,176 --> 00:50:12,989
- You were sayin' about Sylvia ?
- Right. So if the doctor feels
what Sylvia's feelin'...

898
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:14,963
- Uh-huh.
- Know what I mean ?

899
00:50:15,038 --> 00:50:17,886
Yeah. She identifies
with her patient, a bit.

900
00:50:17,918 --> 00:50:21,562
Right. This way when she gets jealous,
it makes sense.

901
00:50:21,598 --> 00:50:23,451
- Right.
- Uh-huh.

902
00:50:23,516 --> 00:50:26,199
There's gotta be a time when the
Lieutenant has it out with the doctor.

903
00:50:26,267 --> 00:50:28,122
Why isn't that in there ?

904
00:50:28,187 --> 00:50:30,227
You're talking about a whole
different direction for the play.

905
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:32,154
Definitely.

906
00:50:33,818 --> 00:50:35,673
Think about it.

907
00:50:35,739 --> 00:50:39,350
How would the audience know
Sylvia was feeling guilty ? Lf...

908
00:50:39,418 --> 00:50:41,490
Oh. I don't know.

909
00:50:41,562 --> 00:50:43,449
Wait a minute.
Yeah. Wait.

910
00:50:43,482 --> 00:50:47,278
You could work it out with maybe you...
you hear what she's thinkin'.

911
00:50:47,321 --> 00:50:50,136
- You mean she speaks her thoughts aloud ?
- Sure, why not ? It's a play anyhow.

912
00:50:50,201 --> 00:50:53,168
It don't have to be real,
but it'll be stronger.

913
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:56,851
You think about that.
And you, don't interrupt me no more.

914
00:50:56,919 --> 00:50:58,774
I'm sorry.

915
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:04,877
So how come you had so much
to say to that Valenti goon ?

916
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,318
No, nothing. I was just
thanking him for his ideas.

917
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:11,243
- What ideas ? He only had
the one suggestion, didn't he ?
- Yeah.

918
00:51:11,316 --> 00:51:14,164
- That was just it.
- So do you like your wallet ?

919
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:16,083
- What ?
- The wallet.

920
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:18,320
- Oh, yes, yes, it's terrific.
- Are you sure ?

921
00:51:18,356 --> 00:51:21,737
Oh, it's very exciting. I love
leatherette. Always have loved it.

922
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:24,047
Boy, are you loaded.

923
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,023
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday.

924
00:51:26,098 --> 00:51:27,953
Thanks.

925
00:51:30,193 --> 00:51:34,927
September 24. I gave the cast
the rewrites. Everyone seemed pleased.

926
00:51:34,993 --> 00:51:37,579
- These are brilliant ! Oh !
- They are.

927
00:51:37,808 --> 00:51:39,718
Now Sylvia's
not so passive.

928
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:43,588
She uses her wiles to trap
the Lieutenant, and that's
what causes her guilt !

929
00:51:43,663 --> 00:51:45,997
The whole thing is motivated.
It drives on. Wonderful.

930
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:49,445
- You mean I gotta
memorize all new lines ?
- They're wonderful !

931
00:51:49,518 --> 00:51:53,576
- How did you come up
with such divine changes ?
- They're not really mine...

932
00:51:53,646 --> 00:51:57,420
- Oh, no ? Whose are they, God's ?

933
00:51:57,485 --> 00:52:01,063
- Well, they are mine
in the sense that they're mine...
- Your modesty becomes you.

934
00:52:01,132 --> 00:52:03,205
But let's face it;
you are a major talent.

935
00:52:03,277 --> 00:52:05,250
A major new voice
in the theater.

936
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:08,705
The word genius gets thrown around
so frequently in this business...

937
00:52:08,747 --> 00:52:11,082
- But, darling, if the shoe fits...
- Congratulations.

938
00:52:11,147 --> 00:52:14,921
- It finally has balls.
- Now, if we can do something
about Act Ill...

939
00:52:14,986 --> 00:52:17,286
we got a big, fat hit
on our hands.

940
00:52:17,353 --> 00:52:21,029
- Three cheers for the writer ! Hip-hip
- Hooray !

941
00:52:21,065 --> 00:52:24,131
I stayed up all night
working on the third act.

942
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:26,056
I admit it came rather hard...

943
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:29,219
and before I handed in the pages,
I sent them over to Cheech to read.

944
00:52:29,288 --> 00:52:31,905
He suggested I come down
to his office.

945
00:52:35,879 --> 00:52:38,365
- You missed the idea.
- I did ?

946
00:52:38,437 --> 00:52:40,893
Yeah, you did.
Plus, nobody talks like that.

947
00:52:40,966 --> 00:52:44,261
- You got that problem.
You don't write like people talk.
- I take poetic license.

948
00:52:44,326 --> 00:52:48,832
Poetic license, bullshit.
People believe what they see
when the actors sound real.

949
00:52:48,902 --> 00:52:51,748
- Come here. Let me show you.
- What are you doing ?

950
00:52:51,812 --> 00:52:53,721
- What does it look like I'm doin' ?
- You're gonna write it ?

951
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:57,821
What am l ? A fuckin' idiot ?
They taught me how to write in
school before I burned it down.

952
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:01,819
- You burned down your school ?
- Yeah, it was Lincoln's birthday.
There was nobody there.

953
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:04,792
- If you actually write...
- Look, I know how people talk,
all right ?

954
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:06,753
Go shoot a rack,
and let me do this.

955
00:53:06,786 --> 00:53:09,468
But if you actually write it,
then I'm not...

956
00:53:09,537 --> 00:53:11,926
- Don't worry about it.
I ain't gonna tell anybody.
- No ?

957
00:53:12,002 --> 00:53:14,815
No. I saw you playin' the big shot.
I know what it's all about.

958
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,181
Where I come from,
nobody squeals.

959
00:53:22,656 --> 00:53:24,727
Go shoot a rack.

960
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:27,035
Stop starin' at me.

961
00:53:27,262 --> 00:53:31,059
What dialogue !
This is better than O'Neill !

962
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:32,563
Max Anderson
will never touch you !

963
00:53:32,637 --> 00:53:34,492
So you liked it.

964
00:53:34,558 --> 00:53:38,201
It's so full of passion !
It's so full of life !

965
00:53:38,269 --> 00:53:42,099
- I hoped it would lift the story.
- What a difference between this
and your first draft.

966
00:53:42,173 --> 00:53:46,927
You hadn't found yourself yet. The idea
was there, but it hadn't crystallized.

967
00:53:47,003 --> 00:53:49,687
You needed to hear it
on its feet, and now this.

968
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:52,656
It's no longer tepid
and cerebral.

969
00:53:52,698 --> 00:53:56,375
It's full of life !
It's full of passion !

970
00:53:56,442 --> 00:54:00,303
It reeks with humid sexuality !
It's carnivorous at last !

971
00:54:00,377 --> 00:54:04,719
- You thought my first draft
was cerebral and tepid ?
- Only the plot and dialogue.

972
00:54:04,793 --> 00:54:08,654
- But this...
- Was-Was-Was there nothing
in the original draft...

973
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:10,614
that you feel
is worth saving ?

974
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:13,777
The stage directions were lucid.
Best I've ever seen.

975
00:54:13,814 --> 00:54:16,400
- And the color of the binder.
Good choice.
- Thank you.

976
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:18,445
I always had a flare
for stage directions.

977
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:22,576
I went back and reread your
earlier plays. They suffered
from the same problem.

978
00:54:22,613 --> 00:54:26,158
- Good ideas, but
too contrived, no real guts.

979
00:54:26,228 --> 00:54:28,137
It's like you
finally happened.

980
00:54:28,212 --> 00:54:30,384
- Helen, I have a confession to make.
- Yes ?

981
00:54:32,915 --> 00:54:35,119
- I...
- Don't speak !

982
00:54:35,187 --> 00:54:37,806
No, no, don't speak.
I know you wanna deprecate yourself.

983
00:54:37,876 --> 00:54:42,098
I know you do, but you're
going to take this town by storm.

984
00:54:46,162 --> 00:54:48,201
I didn't...

985
00:54:49,425 --> 00:54:52,010
realize what
an inspiration...

986
00:54:52,048 --> 00:54:54,251
you've been
to my writing.

987
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,708
Oh, David.

988
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,954
Dear, dear David.

989
00:54:59,023 --> 00:55:01,924
Pungent,
seething artist.

990
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,684
The cocoon
has opened.

991
00:55:09,388 --> 00:55:13,033
I would give my body freely to
the man who wrote those words.

992
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,961
Those glorious,
powerful words.

993
00:55:17,036 --> 00:55:18,891
- Helen...
- No, don't speak.

994
00:55:18,956 --> 00:55:22,119
- Don't speak. Don't speak.
No. Silence. Silence.

995
00:55:22,188 --> 00:55:24,937
- Don't speak.
- Please.

996
00:55:28,169 --> 00:55:31,486
September 28.
The play is working much better now.

997
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:35,337
Helen has been getting on more
pleasantly with Eden, and I
believe she likes Mr. Woofles.

998
00:55:35,402 --> 00:55:38,882
- Back ! Back ! Back ! Back !

999
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:42,597
Warner Purcell and Olive seem
to always be exchanging coy glances.

1000
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:45,948
I don't know if it's my imagination, but
he seems to have put on a little weight.

1001
00:55:46,024 --> 00:55:51,586
Perhaps the tension of our
upcoming Boston opening has
caused him to cheat on his diet.

1002
00:55:51,653 --> 00:55:53,759
Can we go from "God of our fathers" ?

1003
00:55:57,157 --> 00:55:59,393
Take it from
"God of our fathers."

1004
00:56:05,124 --> 00:56:10,209
Oh ! God of our fathers,
help me ! Help me !

1005
00:56:10,436 --> 00:56:14,363
I was thinkin' about
when Sylvia's in the crazy house...

1006
00:56:14,434 --> 00:56:16,289
- Sanitarium.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1007
00:56:16,354 --> 00:56:19,070
- She gets the D.T.S,
and she sees things.
- She hallucinates.

1008
00:56:19,106 --> 00:56:22,618
- No, she sees things.
You know, like visions.
- Like what kind of visions ?

1009
00:56:22,689 --> 00:56:26,845
- Like her dead husband,
and then they have that talk.
- The one in the third act ?

1010
00:56:26,912 --> 00:56:30,141
That's right. She couldn't
face up to him when he was alive.

1011
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:33,590
That's great. That's great.
That's great.

1012
00:56:33,664 --> 00:56:35,901
- It is great.
- Why didn't I think of that ?

1013
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:38,814
Joe,
gimme a beer.

1014
00:56:46,366 --> 00:56:49,266
That's great.
It's all great.

1015
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,227
What's the matter ?

1016
00:56:51,259 --> 00:56:53,332
Nothin'. I just gotta
take a break for a minute.

1017
00:56:53,404 --> 00:56:55,640
- You wanna take a break ?
- Yeah.

1018
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:59,480
- All right.
- Got a cramp.

1019
00:57:02,521 --> 00:57:04,626
Man.

1020
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:07,732
It's a nice... nice spot.

1021
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:09,657
- Come here a long time.
- Yeah ?

1022
00:57:09,723 --> 00:57:12,274
- Yeah.
- You from around here ?
You live around here ?

1023
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:15,443
- New York, born and raised.
West 45th Street.
- Mmm.

1024
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:20,819
- Got a big family ?
- No.

1025
00:57:20,888 --> 00:57:23,472
Got a sister who
lives in Jersey.

1026
00:57:23,542 --> 00:57:26,325
I had a brother,
but he got killed.

1027
00:57:26,391 --> 00:57:29,325
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1028
00:57:29,398 --> 00:57:33,903
He welshed on some Shylocks.
They took him out to Canarsie,
shot him through the head.

1029
00:57:33,973 --> 00:57:35,861
Your brother ?

1030
00:57:39,093 --> 00:57:41,962
How'd you get into
your line of work ?

1031
00:57:42,036 --> 00:57:43,889
- My line of work ?
- Yeah.

1032
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:46,093
My father.
Was he tough.

1033
00:57:47,827 --> 00:57:50,445
You ever think about
doin' anything else ?

1034
00:57:50,514 --> 00:57:52,368
- Like what ?
- Like writing.

1035
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:54,289
- Writing.
- Yeah.

1036
00:57:54,354 --> 00:57:56,719
- Come on, I've been collecting
for the Mob since I was 16.
- You have a huge gift.

1037
00:57:56,945 --> 00:58:01,167
- Yeah.
- No, I'm serious.
Really, it's... it's uncanny.

1038
00:58:01,232 --> 00:58:04,680
- I mean, your instincts.
Dramatic instincts.
- Listen to me.

1039
00:58:04,753 --> 00:58:07,599
- Your play was very good.
Your play was very good.
- Really enviable.

1040
00:58:07,663 --> 00:58:10,696
You just didn't use your head.
Sometimes people don't think.

1041
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:14,503
Well, sure, for you
it's simple, you know ?

1042
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:19,308
To someone who can draw, it all seems
logical, but for someone who can't...

1043
00:58:19,373 --> 00:58:22,243
I studied playwriting
with every teacher. I read every book.

1044
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:24,173
Let me tell you about teachers.
I hate teachers.

1045
00:58:24,238 --> 00:58:27,369
Those blue-haired bitches used to
whack us with rulers. Forget teachers.

1046
00:58:27,405 --> 00:58:30,917
- There was a boy I knew when I was
growing up, and he played accordion.
- Yeah ?

1047
00:58:30,988 --> 00:58:34,632
I loved accordion. And I practiced
and practiced, and I got fluent.

1048
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:38,561
Yet he would squeeze one single note,
and the sound of it would make you cry.

1049
00:58:38,635 --> 00:58:41,252
- I used to want to dance. You know that ?
- Make you cry.

1050
00:58:41,322 --> 00:58:45,413
- I mean it.
You ever see George Raft dance ?
- Oh, yeah.

1051
00:58:52,135 --> 00:58:53,991
- So...
- What ?

1052
00:58:54,056 --> 00:58:58,463
Mr. Marx says that you, uh, actually
rubbed a few people out. Is that true ?

1053
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,924
- What is this, the third degree ?
- Not at all.

1054
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:03,681
- Then why you sayin' that for ?
- I'm just really...

1055
00:59:03,718 --> 00:59:06,107
The truth is
I'm fascinated.

1056
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:09,149
- I took care of a few guys.
- Why ?

1057
00:59:09,221 --> 00:59:11,075
Why, why ?
I don't know why.

1058
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:13,956
They cheated Mr. V. They went back
on a debt. I'll tell you one thing.

1059
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:16,834
I never rubbed out a guy
who didn't deserve it.

1060
00:59:19,492 --> 00:59:24,675
Uh, so what does it actually
feel like when you actually...

1061
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,745
- What ?
- K-kill a man ?

1062
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:28,859
- It feels okay.
- It feels okay ?

1063
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:32,025
- Yeah.
- Even the first time ?

1064
00:59:32,099 --> 00:59:35,033
First time ?
First time was a punk in prison.

1065
00:59:35,106 --> 00:59:38,333
He squealed on me, and I stuck
an ice pick in his back.

1066
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,310
- An ice pick ?
- An ice pick, yeah.

1067
00:59:40,385 --> 00:59:44,508
Had to do it over and over, 40 times.
It was a mess. Forget about it.

1068
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:50,196
October 1.
Helen Sinclair gave a party.

1069
00:59:50,238 --> 00:59:52,791
It was like being in a dream.
Maxwell Anderson was there...

1070
00:59:52,862 --> 00:59:55,546
and George S. Kaufman
and Gertrude Lawrence.

1071
00:59:55,614 --> 00:59:59,062
Darling, I want you to meet
my playwright, David Shayne.

1072
00:59:59,134 --> 01:00:02,678
Oh, you have
quite a find here, darling.
Word's all over the streets.

1073
01:00:02,749 --> 01:00:05,596
Oh, well, Helen's made me out to be
quite a hero. You're too kind.

1074
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,732
No, I'm not kind.
Helen will vouch for that.

1075
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:10,422
But I read your play,
and it's nothing short of marvelous.

1076
01:00:10,492 --> 01:00:12,662
I let him read the rewrite,
not the eunuch version.

1077
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:17,171
- My tongue is hanging out to
present it on the London stage.
- London ?

1078
01:00:17,243 --> 01:00:20,952
Look at his face, Helen. You're
going to be the toast of Broadway.

1079
01:00:21,018 --> 01:00:22,926
Why not the West End, hmm ?

1080
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:26,262
- Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed the show.
- It was extraordinary.

1081
01:00:26,328 --> 01:00:28,817
What's this I hear
about Helen's latest ? Ls that true ?

1082
01:00:28,888 --> 01:00:32,150
- Oh, yes. He's creating
a vehicle for Helen for next season.
- Really ?

1083
01:00:32,217 --> 01:00:35,860
It's a little idea she's wanted to
do for years. She plays Jesus' mother.

1084
01:00:35,927 --> 01:00:37,781
- Oh !
- It's a whole Oedipal thing:

1085
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:41,108
He loves her, wants to do in the father.
Well, you can see the complications.

1086
01:00:41,175 --> 01:00:44,021
- Of course.
- Of course, we're talking
to Ira Gershwin...

1087
01:00:44,054 --> 01:00:47,369
about a modern musical version
of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

1088
01:00:47,445 --> 01:00:52,016
- Quasimodo Jones.
- Helen has such a-a-a... a new vitality.

1089
01:00:52,084 --> 01:00:55,947
- Even her face looks so smooth.
- I know. The monkey glands are working.

1090
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:03,507
Can you leave
your purse here, or is it...

1091
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:06,441
- Why did you close the door ?
- I've wanted to be alone with you...

1092
01:01:06,515 --> 01:01:08,521
since this
boring party began.

1093
01:01:08,592 --> 01:01:12,368
This party, boring ?
This party's magnificent ! It's glorious !

1094
01:01:12,433 --> 01:01:15,052
Make love to me.

1095
01:01:15,122 --> 01:01:17,260
Here ? Now ?

1096
01:01:17,297 --> 01:01:21,671
- I see no reason to wait.
- Jerome Kern is on
the other side of the door.

1097
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,980
Yes, he's a wonderful composer.
You'll have to meet him.

1098
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:27,342
Now hang up your pants.

1099
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:30,472
I feel good today. You know, I went
to 34th Street. I got this new dress.

1100
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:32,396
- You like it ?
- It's very nice.

1101
01:01:32,462 --> 01:01:35,178
- Isn't it ? I think we
should go dancin' tonight.
- We're gonna go dancin'.

1102
01:01:35,213 --> 01:01:37,101
- I gotta take care of some business.
- Business now ?

1103
01:01:37,134 --> 01:01:40,003
- Oh, come on.
- I'll take you dancin' in
a minute. Just stay there.

1104
01:01:40,045 --> 01:01:41,931
All right.

1105
01:01:48,811 --> 01:01:52,521
- Hey, I wanna talk to you.
- Hi, Cheech ! What are you doing here ?

1106
01:01:52,588 --> 01:01:56,198
Listen, usually I wouldn't give you
no warning, but you're a good actor.

1107
01:01:56,266 --> 01:01:59,266
You're doin' a good job, and it'll
be a big problem if you're not around.

1108
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:03,079
But I'm tellin' you right now:
lf you go near Nick Valenti's
girl one more time...

1109
01:02:03,146 --> 01:02:06,756
I'm gonna stick my gun in your mouth
and blow a hole in the top of your head.

1110
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:10,338
- All right ?
- Cheech, it's so funny how you've
misconstrued the situation.

1111
01:02:10,408 --> 01:02:13,572
Listen to me. I said don't give me
no shit now, you hear ?

1112
01:02:13,608 --> 01:02:15,778
- All right, all right.
- I know what's goin' on.

1113
01:02:15,846 --> 01:02:17,701
- I understand, Mr. Cheech.
- You understand ?

1114
01:02:17,766 --> 01:02:20,995
- I do understand, yes.
- Next time I come back angry.
You hear what I said ?

1115
01:02:21,062 --> 01:02:23,876
- Yes, I understand.
- And next time you go near
her, you're a dead man.

1116
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:26,757
- Point taken. Thank you, thank you.
- Now get out of here.

1117
01:02:37,219 --> 01:02:40,349
Mmm ! Waiter !
Waiter.

1118
01:02:40,418 --> 01:02:44,608
Could you bring me
some more potatoes, please ?
And I'll have the pork loin now. Lovely.

1119
01:02:44,674 --> 01:02:47,991
Thank you.
Oh, and one more thing.

1120
01:02:48,066 --> 01:02:52,799
I'll have the cheese platter
now as well. Yes, and could you
save me the Nesselrode pie ?

1121
01:02:52,864 --> 01:02:54,686
Lovely.
Thank you.

1122
01:02:56,737 --> 01:02:59,671
October 12.
We opened in Boston.

1123
01:02:59,744 --> 01:03:02,295
Ellen came up for it.
Mr. Valenti was there.

1124
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:05,432
It went well, although my heart's
in my mouth every time Olive speaks.

1125
01:03:05,502 --> 01:03:10,041
Don't tell me you still think
the world revolves around...

1126
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:12,345
- "You" !
- You.

1127
01:03:12,412 --> 01:03:15,228
I saw Max Gordon in the lobby.
He loved it !

1128
01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:19,187
- David, did you know
that I have a train to catch ?

1129
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:23,384
- Hey, Dave, how was l ?
- Wonderful. You finished
that whole speech this time.

1130
01:03:23,453 --> 01:03:25,425
- Yeah, I did, didn't l ?
- And much improved.

1131
01:03:25,498 --> 01:03:29,295
You know, Olive was good.
She still needs work, but...
Hey, Charlie, how are ya ?

1132
01:03:29,371 --> 01:03:31,225
The first act seems
to be working well.

1133
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:35,893
- I got some flowers for ya.
- Oh, a hundred orchids !
They could only be from Billy Rose.

1134
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:40,018
Yes. They are ! They're from Billy.
Oh, they're beautiful.

1135
01:03:40,088 --> 01:03:42,674
And you !
Oh ! Fabulous.

1136
01:03:42,744 --> 01:03:46,127
Oh, thank you so much.
So sweet of you. [Kissing]

1137
01:03:46,359 --> 01:03:49,775
Listen, let me go and get changed, and
then I'll meet you at the Lobster Grill.

1138
01:03:49,847 --> 01:03:52,497
Could you order me
the shore dinner as an appetizer ?

1139
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:54,421
And I'll have roast beef
as the main course.

1140
01:03:54,487 --> 01:03:58,162
- How come you didn't
call me over the weekend ?
- Oh, you were great.

1141
01:03:58,197 --> 01:04:00,815
- I was busy, my dear. I'm busy now.
- Oh, really ?

1142
01:04:00,885 --> 01:04:03,755
- Excuse me. Could I just
have a word with you ?
- No, my friends are up from town.

1143
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:07,659
- We're just going to eat,
and I've got to get changed.
- You don't mind if we talk.

1144
01:04:07,733 --> 01:04:09,706
- We'll wait for you.
- We'll just be a second.

1145
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:14,220
- Oh, well, I'll be with you
in two seconds.
- Bye.

1146
01:04:14,292 --> 01:04:19,627
- I can't be here. I mustn't...
- When I saw you on stage,
doing that big speech...

1147
01:04:19,667 --> 01:04:23,528
- Olive, I'm very tempted.
You're a gorgeous girl.
- You were so, so sexy.

1148
01:04:23,762 --> 01:04:26,663
- I mustn't be seen with you.
- What the hell is this ?
A corset ? Get it off.

1149
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:29,071
- Don't !
- What, what, what ?
What are you so nervous about ?

1150
01:04:29,137 --> 01:04:33,030
- I can't be seen with you.
He threatened to kill me.
- Who threatened to kill you ?

1151
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:36,747
- Cheech.
- Cheech threatened to kill you ?

1152
01:04:36,782 --> 01:04:39,652
Well, how do ya like that ?
He finally got wise.

1153
01:04:39,727 --> 01:04:42,662
You know what ? I wouldn't let it
worry you if I were you.

1154
01:04:42,703 --> 01:04:46,215
You're not the type to let some
strong-arm gorilla push you around.

1155
01:04:46,286 --> 01:04:50,082
Olive, essentially, I'm an actor. I take
on certain roles that require of me...

1156
01:04:50,158 --> 01:04:53,900
You weren't just an actor
when you were taking my underwear off.
You were a big shot.

1157
01:04:53,965 --> 01:04:57,826
You were sayin' to me,
"Olive, I have big plans for you.
I want you to star with me.

1158
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,551
- Stop it. Listen, Olive...
- I make my own rules.

1159
01:05:00,621 --> 01:05:02,660
All this is true,
but we must be realistic.

1160
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:07,204
- Realistic ?
- God, I'm starving !
Do you have a sticky bun or...

1161
01:05:07,275 --> 01:05:09,892
Open up. It's me, Nick.

1162
01:05:09,962 --> 01:05:12,134
Nick ?
Nick Valenti ?

1163
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:17,024
- I'm dressing.
- Ah, c'mon. I ain't gonna see
noplace I ain't been before.

1164
01:05:17,095 --> 01:05:20,576
- I'm coming, I'm coming.
Hold your water.

1165
01:05:21,895 --> 01:05:24,262
- Hi, baby.
- Ah, there you are.

1166
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:26,914
- You were swell in
the show tonight, Olive.
- Well, thank you.

1167
01:05:27,144 --> 01:05:28,833
- I thought so. Wasn't she, boys ?
- Oh, yeah.

1168
01:05:29,062 --> 01:05:31,266
- What a thrill.
- Come on. Get yourself dressed.

1169
01:05:31,334 --> 01:05:35,076
- We got time to grab a drink
before I drive back to New York.
- Well, I don't know.

1170
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:37,924
- Not tonight, Nickie.
I'm a little bit tired.
- Come on, come on.

1171
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:40,028
You been puttin' me off
for weeks now.

1172
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:43,580
- I'm a little bit tired.
- Since when you too tired
to shovel in a little booze ?

1173
01:05:43,652 --> 01:05:46,522
What a marvelous audience. I thought
the show went quite well, don't you ?

1174
01:05:46,596 --> 01:05:51,296
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Valenti.
Darling, could you give me that
cue a little quicker in Act ll ?

1175
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:54,298
You know the one where your character
is quoting Hamlet ?

1176
01:05:54,338 --> 01:05:57,372
Oh, well, you know, it's hard,
'cause I always forget the second part.

1177
01:05:57,411 --> 01:06:00,793
Yes, I know.
It's "or not to be." Okay ?

1178
01:06:00,867 --> 01:06:03,964
Because I can't come in until you
finish your line, and I go "ooh."

1179
01:06:04,033 --> 01:06:07,131
- To be...
- Or not to be.

1180
01:06:07,168 --> 01:06:10,299
That's the way it goes. You're tired.
You're not taking it in.

1181
01:06:10,368 --> 01:06:13,596
And did you notice the
way the audience applauded your exit ?

1182
01:06:13,663 --> 01:06:17,241
It'll go better next time if you
make it through the doorway
and not the upstage wall.

1183
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,165
- Oh !

1184
01:06:20,446 --> 01:06:22,780
Get the pooch outta here.

1185
01:06:22,814 --> 01:06:25,813
Mr. Woofles.
Oh, he smells something.

1186
01:06:25,885 --> 01:06:29,714
- You got somebody in there ?
- Yeah, right, I got somebody in there.

1187
01:06:29,787 --> 01:06:32,570
- Here, pooch, take a hike.
- Come on, darling. Protecting Mommy.

1188
01:06:32,605 --> 01:06:35,060
- Bye-bye, bye-bye.
- What's he barkin' at ?

1189
01:06:35,293 --> 01:06:38,226
- I think you were talkin'
about the broad.
- All right, party's over.

1190
01:06:38,299 --> 01:06:40,568
Come on, guys. Get outta here.
I gotta change.

1191
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:43,286
Nickie, you too.
One drink, all right ? Let me change.

1192
01:06:43,355 --> 01:06:46,104
- So who's this Hamlet guy ?
- Come on. Outta here.

1193
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,241
- Go on, go on.
- Does he live around here ?

1194
01:06:48,313 --> 01:06:51,575
Hamlet. That's really
funny, honey. Bye.

1195
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:53,585
Go on ! Get outta here. They're gone.

1196
01:06:53,658 --> 01:06:56,145
Go on ! Get outta here. They're gone.
Get outta here. Go on, go on.

1197
01:06:56,377 --> 01:06:59,507
No, no, no ! Not that way.
The window, the window.

1198
01:06:59,576 --> 01:07:01,648
Go on. The window.

1199
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:04,371
I'll be out
in a minute, Nick.

1200
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:13,746
- Oh, my goodness. Warner ! Hello, Warner.
- It was a lovely performance.

1201
01:07:13,814 --> 01:07:17,196
- Oh, thank you very much.
That's sweet of you.
- We enjoyed it so much.

1202
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:19,887
- Oh, yes, well, did you like the play ?
- I loved the play.

1203
01:07:19,956 --> 01:07:22,672
- It's a smashing part.
- The second act was wonderful.

1204
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:25,356
- Beautiful scene.
- It's lovely working
with Helen, of course.

1205
01:07:25,395 --> 01:07:28,362
- She's so good. She's just lovely.
- She just carries one through.

1206
01:07:28,403 --> 01:07:30,378
Could you possibly
give me an autograph ?

1207
01:07:30,451 --> 01:07:33,963
- I-l'd love to.
I don't have a pen on me.
- Oh, you don't ?

1208
01:07:34,034 --> 01:07:37,994
It's her. That's what it is. I can't
keep turnin' a blind eye. It's Olive.

1209
01:07:38,065 --> 01:07:39,953
She's better than
when we started.

1210
01:07:40,017 --> 01:07:43,497
- Sure, she's better.
That don't mean she's good enough.
- Well, I mean, you know...

1211
01:07:43,569 --> 01:07:45,739
- This is something
that just bothers you.
- Yeah.

1212
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:49,703
- The critics... Her notices were decent.
- Decent ain't good enough.

1213
01:07:49,776 --> 01:07:55,308
- She's killin' my words.
- Your words ? Okay, she's
weaker, but it doesn't matter.

1214
01:07:55,374 --> 01:07:58,757
- Weak ? I think she's doin'
more damage than you think.
- What am I gonna do, fire her ?

1215
01:07:58,831 --> 01:08:00,805
- I can't have her ruinin' my show.
- Your show ?

1216
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:04,073
- What are you talkin' about ?
- All right, our show.

1217
01:08:04,109 --> 01:08:06,890
- I put a lot into this.
It could be perfect.
- Yeah, so did I...

1218
01:08:06,956 --> 01:08:08,811
but there's concessions
we have to make.

1219
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:11,723
- The show's a hit.
- She's not the best we could do
for the part.

1220
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:15,300
- There's plenty other girls around.
- What are we gonna do, Cheech ?

1221
01:08:15,371 --> 01:08:17,989
She throws the whole thing
out of whack. Can't you see it ?

1222
01:08:18,057 --> 01:08:20,229
- The audience doesn't
know the difference.
- Oh, they know.

1223
01:08:20,298 --> 01:08:23,047
- They do not know.
- They don't know how to say it,
but they know.

1224
01:08:23,113 --> 01:08:26,659
Every time I hear that voice,
it's like a knife in my fuckin' heart.
She can't act !

1225
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:28,585
- You listening to me ?
- Cheech, take a shower.

1226
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:31,878
She makes stuff not work. Stuff
she ain't even in comes out twisted.

1227
01:08:31,944 --> 01:08:35,555
- I can't fire her ! You know this !
- Don't yell at me.

1228
01:08:35,592 --> 01:08:38,112
I am not yelling at you,
but you are too close to this.

1229
01:08:38,184 --> 01:08:39,842
Leave me alone.
I got a fuckin' headache.

1230
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:42,143
- Leave me alone. I got a headache.
- You're being temperamental.

1231
01:08:42,214 --> 01:08:44,156
Very temperamental !

1232
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:46,205
Fate acts in strange ways.

1233
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:49,759
Everyone seems to be
feeling the pressure of
our upcoming New York opening.

1234
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:54,106
Yesterday, Warner got into a
fight with Eden, and the results
proved Cheech right yet again.

1235
01:08:54,181 --> 01:08:57,792
There you are. Mr. Purcell,
you have been stealing our
dog yummies and eating them.

1236
01:08:57,828 --> 01:08:59,966
Absolutely not.
That's an outrageous suggestion.

1237
01:09:00,196 --> 01:09:02,684
- Then let me see in your pockets.
- Would I eat dog food ?

1238
01:09:02,756 --> 01:09:06,137
You'd eat anything that didn't eat
you first, you big fat pot of helium.

1239
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:08,829
- This is the sort of food I eat:
prime loin chop.
- Let me see.

1240
01:09:08,898 --> 01:09:12,313
I do not steal from animals. Get out
of my trousers, you horrid woman.

1241
01:09:12,386 --> 01:09:14,773
Look !
Oh, thief, thief, thief !

1242
01:09:14,848 --> 01:09:16,987
It was you that drank
her saucer of milk yesterday.

1243
01:09:17,024 --> 01:09:20,602
Ow ! Ow !
You fat hunk of blubber !

1244
01:09:20,672 --> 01:09:24,382
- She pushed me !
- Ow, my hand ! That's 'cause
you were stealin' her dog food.

1245
01:09:24,448 --> 01:09:28,091
Somebody ought to stick
a harpoon in you, you big whale.

1246
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:30,614
- Ow.
- I can get you a doctor.
I can get you a doctor.

1247
01:09:30,654 --> 01:09:32,542
I guess this means
you'll miss the matinee.

1248
01:09:32,575 --> 01:09:35,291
It's okay with me.
One show a day is plenty.

1249
01:09:35,358 --> 01:09:37,745
To think I didn't
believe you at first, you dear...

1250
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:42,425
I think I can say this in the company
of... in the company of all of you.

1251
01:09:42,462 --> 01:09:47,382
That a woman of your age
should have leapt past the realm
of such acute narcissism.

1252
01:09:55,611 --> 01:09:58,066
- What a difference with
a real actress saying those lines !
- All right.

1253
01:09:58,138 --> 01:10:01,236
- The whole play came to life !
- Listen to me.

1254
01:10:01,305 --> 01:10:05,745
Don't get carried away.
Don't get any ideas. Olive is going on.

1255
01:10:05,817 --> 01:10:09,678
We can get all the backing
we need without Nick Valenti.
Our notices are wonderful.

1256
01:10:09,752 --> 01:10:12,401
- People are standing...
- It's not the money. I told ya that.

1257
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:16,267
We dump Olive, you, me,
even the dog will wind up
at the bottom of the Hudson.

1258
01:10:16,343 --> 01:10:20,500
It won't take that long.
He'll kill us here in Boston.
We'll be at the bottom of the Charles.

1259
01:10:20,535 --> 01:10:23,698
He was right. She wrecks the whole play.
He noticed that.

1260
01:10:23,766 --> 01:10:27,857
- What are you talking about ?
- Nothing. It's just that
she affects the whole play.

1261
01:10:29,205 --> 01:10:32,074
- You were wonderful.
- Yes, yes. Wonderful.

1262
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:34,700
- Have you seen
Deliah with my robe ?
- Yes, she's coming.

1263
01:10:34,771 --> 01:10:37,422
- Listen.

1264
01:10:37,491 --> 01:10:40,721
- One thing you don't do
is welsh on Nick Valenti.
- On Nick Valenti.

1265
01:10:40,788 --> 01:10:43,886
- In future productions,
we can hire somebody else.
- Shh-shh !

1266
01:10:43,955 --> 01:10:47,216
We can hire somebody else, but if she's
okay to open in New York, she opens.

1267
01:10:47,282 --> 01:10:50,281
- I mean, the play must go on.
I'll do anything...
- She affected the whole thing.

1268
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:01,322
I can't tell you
how many times I've seen it.

1269
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:03,279
A show comes into Boston...

1270
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:08,076
crippled, limping, struggling, gasping
for air, trying to find its own life...

1271
01:11:08,141 --> 01:11:12,875
and then, somewhere along the line,
a miracle occurs.

1272
01:11:12,941 --> 01:11:14,883
A work of art is born.

1273
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:18,570
- It's amazing how much better the show
is working with Olive's understudy.
- Mmm, Olive.

1274
01:11:18,606 --> 01:11:20,491
- The thing's breathing and living.
- Yes, it's true.

1275
01:11:20,524 --> 01:11:23,971
She's drab, but it's still
going to be a fine, fat hit.

1276
01:11:24,204 --> 01:11:26,474
- Mmm.
- Here's to your future...

1277
01:11:26,508 --> 01:11:29,442
as the new white knight
of the Great White Way.

1278
01:11:30,922 --> 01:11:34,916
- Cheers.

1279
01:11:34,955 --> 01:11:38,915
- What is this stuff ?
- Paint remover. You can cut
it with a little club soda.

1280
01:11:38,986 --> 01:11:40,841
- Oh, it's very smooth.
- Yes.

1281
01:11:42,408 --> 01:11:44,132
See the little towns go by ?

1282
01:11:46,472 --> 01:11:49,788
Helen, when I get back to New York,
I'm gonna tell Ellen about us.

1283
01:11:49,864 --> 01:11:52,199
- Oh, David !
- No, I've decided.

1284
01:11:52,232 --> 01:11:55,078
- Oh, are you sure ?
- You know how I feel about you.

1285
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:59,486
Oh, David, you must be gentle.
I-I-I've been hurt so many times before.

1286
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:02,238
I know.
I know.

1287
01:12:02,309 --> 01:12:05,155
You stand on the brink
of greatness.

1288
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:10,436
The world will open to you like an
oyster. No. No, not like an oyster.

1289
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,632
The world will open to you
like a magnificent vagina.

1290
01:12:17,283 --> 01:12:19,291
You okay ?
You look a little flushed.

1291
01:12:19,364 --> 01:12:21,784
- I've just had a little too much...
- Is it something I said ?

1292
01:12:21,827 --> 01:12:24,314
- No, just the paint remover.
- Oh.

1293
01:12:27,712 --> 01:12:30,430
Have you ever thought about
whether, when you fall in love...

1294
01:12:30,465 --> 01:12:33,465
do you fall in love with
the artist or the man ?

1295
01:12:35,361 --> 01:12:37,532
What a strange question.

1296
01:12:37,601 --> 01:12:39,454
Yes, it is strange, but...

1297
01:12:41,184 --> 01:12:45,886
I'm in love with you, Helen. I am, and
the time has come for me to act on it.

1298
01:12:45,951 --> 01:12:48,852
Oh, the train
is moving so fast.

1299
01:12:48,926 --> 01:12:52,241
Oh, David, it's so fast.
Oh, hold me !

1300
01:12:52,477 --> 01:12:55,127
- Oh, hold me. No, no, don't speak.
- Helen, I love you.

1301
01:12:55,357 --> 01:12:57,745
Don't speak.
B... Uh, please, don't speak.

1302
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:00,503
- Don't speak. No. Don't speak.

1303
01:13:00,573 --> 01:13:02,458
No, please.

1304
01:13:02,523 --> 01:13:06,865
- Are you having an affair
with Helen Sinclair ?
- What ? No !

1305
01:13:06,907 --> 01:13:08,795
- Don't lie to me.
- What are you talking about ?

1306
01:13:08,859 --> 01:13:12,056
You two are in every gossip column in
town. You were all over Boston together.

1307
01:13:12,123 --> 01:13:13,976
- You know those columns.
- All those late nights.

1308
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:15,984
- I was working !
- What about this ?

1309
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:19,635
- That's a cigarette case I found.
I don't know where I found it.
- "To Helen from Cole.

1310
01:13:19,705 --> 01:13:22,771
- Let's do it.
- I remember now. I admired it,
and she gave it to me.

1311
01:13:22,841 --> 01:13:25,709
- Why didn't you tell me ?
- Because there's nothing to tell, Ellen.

1312
01:13:25,783 --> 01:13:30,007
Now that you're on the eve
of success, you want to dump me
and go off with Helen Sinclair.

1313
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,941
- That is ri... That is ridiculous.
- Are you sure ?

1314
01:13:33,016 --> 01:13:35,153
You know how crazy
you sound right now ?

1315
01:13:35,222 --> 01:13:38,571
- You never encouraged me
to stay in Boston.
- I was submerged in my work.

1316
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:41,581
The play's in trouble.
I'm working.

1317
01:13:41,654 --> 01:13:43,661
Hey, it's me.
It's David.

1318
01:13:43,733 --> 01:13:45,938
You know ?
David ? Okay ?

1319
01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:50,153
What an imagination
on this girl.

1320
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:55,115
Listen, Flender,
I'm completely mixed up.

1321
01:13:55,187 --> 01:13:58,349
Ellen, Ellen. I love Ellen.
She's been with me the whole time.

1322
01:13:58,417 --> 01:14:00,839
Stuck by me. I knew she'd
be happier back in Pittsburgh.

1323
01:14:00,913 --> 01:14:02,855
- We've had a great relationship.
- Right.

1324
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:05,931
- I love her dearly. And yet...
- Yeah. Yes. Get to the point.

1325
01:14:05,969 --> 01:14:09,036
What is the problem here ? It's always
been clear that you've loved Ellen.

1326
01:14:09,264 --> 01:14:12,679
I've become involved with
Helen Sinclair, and I feel terrible.

1327
01:14:12,752 --> 01:14:17,453
But I can't help myself.
She's so charismatic, and
she's brilliant and beautiful.

1328
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:20,453
I mean, a real artist, and...
and we speak the same language.

1329
01:14:20,525 --> 01:14:22,413
- You're wracked with guilt.
- I'm wracked with guilt.

1330
01:14:22,446 --> 01:14:25,294
- You're wracked with guilt.
You are wracked with guilt.
- I don't know whether...

1331
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:29,636
- I can't sleep.
- Guilt is petit bourgeois crap.

1332
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:33,385
- An artist creates
his own moral universe.
- I know that. I know...

1333
01:14:33,452 --> 01:14:37,227
Well ? What is the problem then ?
I'm gonna give you some advice.

1334
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:41,448
The same advice that was
given to me many years ago when
I had a very similar dilemma.

1335
01:14:41,516 --> 01:14:43,522
- Similar to mine. To...
- Yes. Yes.

1336
01:14:43,595 --> 01:14:45,482
What did you do ?
What ?

1337
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:48,165
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

1338
01:14:55,752 --> 01:14:57,956
Hot ginger and dynamite

1339
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,847
There's nothing
but that at night

1340
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:01,854
Back in Nagasaki where
the fellas chew tobaccy

1341
01:15:02,088 --> 01:15:04,227
And the women
wicky wacky woo

1342
01:15:04,297 --> 01:15:06,946
- The way they can entertain
- She's great in the show, huh ?

1343
01:15:07,015 --> 01:15:08,870
- Would hurry a hurricane
- Oh, the best.

1344
01:15:08,935 --> 01:15:10,909
- Back in Nagasaki
- She'll take Broadway by storm.

1345
01:15:10,982 --> 01:15:14,876
- And the women wicky wacky woo#
- The part is modest. Still...

1346
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:18,723
Listen, when she gets here, tell her
you're gonna give her some new lines.

1347
01:15:18,789 --> 01:15:21,375
- You know, like we discussed.
- Yeah.

1348
01:15:21,445 --> 01:15:24,673
Let me level with you, Mr. V.
Do you mind if I call you Nick ?

1349
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:27,610
You see, Nick, you don't
fiddle with a winning show.

1350
01:15:27,685 --> 01:15:30,433
Every script reaches a point where,
in the professional judgment...

1351
01:15:30,499 --> 01:15:32,800
of the producer, the director,
you're finished.

1352
01:15:32,835 --> 01:15:35,104
You can't distort the plot.

1353
01:15:35,171 --> 01:15:38,749
Now, we're about ready to open.
Changes could be harmful.

1354
01:15:38,818 --> 01:15:40,791
No, the show is
basically frozen.

1355
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:45,435
- Let's avoid confusion.
- Sure.

1356
01:15:45,473 --> 01:15:47,360
She'll get some new
fuckin' lines...

1357
01:15:47,392 --> 01:15:50,262
or I'll nail your kneecaps
to the dance floor.

1358
01:15:52,575 --> 01:15:55,890
Imagine that director telling me
I'm overacting in the first scene...

1359
01:15:55,966 --> 01:15:58,006
and I don't know
what I'm saying.

1360
01:15:58,078 --> 01:16:01,723
You know what I'm doing, Cheech, is,
I'm working on a superior laugh. Like:

1361
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:04,921
Ha-ha-ha. Hee-hee-hee.

1362
01:16:04,989 --> 01:16:09,528
I wanna throw that in when
Sylvia threatens to leave,
and then I burst into tears.

1363
01:16:09,597 --> 01:16:14,199
Well, you know, he says no,
but what the hell kind of dull
show is he putting on anyway ?

1364
01:16:14,267 --> 01:16:17,563
- I don't know.
- Where we goin' ? I thought
we were gonna go meet Nick.

1365
01:16:17,627 --> 01:16:20,115
We have to go pick up Nick.

1366
01:16:20,188 --> 01:16:23,733
We're gonna pick up Nick ? You never
said nothin' about picking him up.

1367
01:16:23,803 --> 01:16:27,031
- We just gotta meet him...
- I thought we were gonna
meet him at the club.

1368
01:16:34,553 --> 01:16:39,091
How come I have to wear those
dowdy, brown, ugly dresses ?
I don't understand...

1369
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,258
What are we doin' here ?
I thought we were goin' to see Nick.

1370
01:16:42,327 --> 01:16:44,214
Yeah, we are.
Nick's got a surprise for ya.

1371
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:46,734
- Nick's got a surprise for me ?
- Yeah, come on.

1372
01:16:46,807 --> 01:16:50,635
Come with me. You're gonna really like
it. This cost Nick a lot of dough to...

1373
01:16:50,709 --> 01:16:54,418
- To do this for you. Come on.
- I don't... I don't like this.

1374
01:16:54,486 --> 01:16:58,512
I don't like this, Cheech.
I can't understand why Nick has
a surprise for me in a warehouse.

1375
01:16:58,582 --> 01:17:00,555
He's not treatin' me
like a lady.

1376
01:17:00,628 --> 01:17:04,370
- He's got a moonlight cruise.
- A moonlight cruise ? I don't understand.

1377
01:17:04,436 --> 01:17:06,857
- Just walk right over there.
Go ahead. He's over there.
- I don't...

1378
01:17:06,899 --> 01:17:09,288
- Just walk over there. Olive !
- Nickie ?

1379
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:12,842
- What ?
- I think you should know this.
You're a horrible actress.

1380
01:17:15,251 --> 01:17:17,073
- Everyone's in love

1381
01:17:17,138 --> 01:17:21,609
- Up a lazy river
- Thank God I don't have to hear
that voice anymore.

1382
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,622
Up a lazy river

1383
01:17:23,696 --> 01:17:27,012
October 25. We open tomorrow.

1384
01:17:27,056 --> 01:17:29,129
Olive did not show up
for the run-through today.

1385
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,054
We tried calling her,
but there was no answer.

1386
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:34,184
It's possible her understudy might
have to do tomorrow's show.

1387
01:17:34,222 --> 01:17:37,069
- Listen to this.
The whole thing's comin' to life.
- Yeah.

1388
01:17:37,133 --> 01:17:41,443
- Maybe Olive's got stage fright.
Maybe she won't show.
- Not Olive.

1389
01:17:41,518 --> 01:17:43,885
That dame doesn't have
a nerve in her body.

1390
01:17:43,949 --> 01:17:46,915
I don't think her spinal cord
touches her brain.

1391
01:17:47,148 --> 01:17:49,668
- Oh, God. Listen to this.
- Yeah.

1392
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,642
It's wonderful. Where's Cheech ?
He'd know where she is.

1393
01:17:52,716 --> 01:17:56,260
- He didn't come around.
- Look, I'm in love with the understudy.

1394
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:58,720
- It's so natural. It's...

1395
01:17:58,763 --> 01:18:00,649
- Julian ?
- Yeah ?

1396
01:18:00,682 --> 01:18:03,049
- Did you hear about Olive ?
- Oh, what now ?

1397
01:18:03,113 --> 01:18:04,969
She got bumped off.

1398
01:18:06,698 --> 01:18:09,031
- What ?
- Out at the docks.

1399
01:18:09,257 --> 01:18:11,396
A gangland hit.

1400
01:18:11,465 --> 01:18:14,400
I wanna talk to you.

1401
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:16,480
- Me ?
- Yeah, you.

1402
01:18:16,553 --> 01:18:18,853
Hey, Joe.
Get lost for a while.

1403
01:18:18,919 --> 01:18:21,341
How could you ?
How could you !

1404
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:23,270
- Nobody's gonna ruin my play.
- Oh... Your play ?

1405
01:18:23,335 --> 01:18:26,051
- That's the second time
you called it your play.
- All right, our play.

1406
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:29,565
- Didn't it cut you up inside
to hear her say it ? Huh ?
- We would've survived it !

1407
01:18:29,637 --> 01:18:32,932
Survived it ? Ls that what you want ? When
we had a great thing, a thing of beauty ?

1408
01:18:32,998 --> 01:18:35,331
But, Cheech ! To... kill her !

1409
01:18:35,396 --> 01:18:37,817
- She was a tramp.
- It's a free country.

1410
01:18:38,052 --> 01:18:40,289
- Then leave me alone.
- No, I will not leave you alone.

1411
01:18:40,356 --> 01:18:44,479
Didn't anybody ever teach you that
it's morally wrong, that it's a sin to...

1412
01:18:44,547 --> 01:18:46,401
Who am I talking to ?
Jesus Christ !

1413
01:18:46,466 --> 01:18:49,281
- The part works better
with the understudy.
- That's not the point.

1414
01:18:49,347 --> 01:18:52,411
Let me see if I can explain this
to you in a way you'll understand.

1415
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:55,297
Let's say she was ruining
the play... which she was not.
She was diminishing it.

1416
01:18:55,362 --> 01:18:57,979
- She was ruining it.
- Let's say she was ruining the play.

1417
01:18:58,209 --> 01:19:00,762
- Does that mean
that she deserves to die ?
- There was no way to fire her.

1418
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:04,279
- What kind of inhuman monster are you ?
- I think you'd better leave.

1419
01:19:04,351 --> 01:19:06,523
I don't think I will.
I think I'd better stay.

1420
01:19:06,559 --> 01:19:09,855
- You should be thanking me.
We're both in this together.
- No, we're not.

1421
01:19:09,887 --> 01:19:13,880
I didn't want her dead. See ?
You understand what I'm saying ?
I'm not in anything.

1422
01:19:13,951 --> 01:19:17,660
- You choose her over the show ?
- Of course I do ! Yes !

1423
01:19:17,726 --> 01:19:21,206
You think it's right some
tootsie walks in and messes up
a beautiful thing like this ?

1424
01:19:21,246 --> 01:19:23,831
- I wanted a great play
as much as you did.
- No, not as much.

1425
01:19:23,901 --> 01:19:26,234
- But you don't kill for it !
- Yeah ? Who says ?

1426
01:19:26,299 --> 01:19:29,528
My father used to listen to the opera.
He loved the opera. But if a guy stunk...

1427
01:19:29,596 --> 01:19:32,246
- What, he killed him ?
- One time, in Palermo.

1428
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:39,861
I'm an artist too, not great
like you, but you know what ?
First I'm a human being.

1429
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:43,312
- I'm a decent, moral human being.
- What are you doin' with
Helen Sinclair then ?

1430
01:19:43,353 --> 01:19:46,420
- What has that got to do
with it ? How did you know ?
- Everybody in town knows.

1431
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,855
Except maybe your girlfriend.
Who you think you're foolin' ?

1432
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:52,376
I might not be perfect, but you're
a killer ! You're a degenerate animal !

1433
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:55,473
You're a murderer ! You b...
You belong in the electric chair !

1434
01:19:55,512 --> 01:19:58,064
Listen to me, you.
You listen to me.

1435
01:19:58,135 --> 01:20:01,297
Nobody, nobody is gonna
ruin my work, you hear me ?

1436
01:20:01,526 --> 01:20:03,217
Nobody, huh ?

1437
01:20:13,269 --> 01:20:16,116
I've fallen in love
with Helen Sinclair...

1438
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:19,954
and I lied to you about it
the other day, which I'm sure
that you probably knew.

1439
01:20:20,019 --> 01:20:23,182
I want to let you know I didn't mean
for this to happen. It just happened.

1440
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:25,128
I'm not surprised.
She is extraordinary.

1441
01:20:25,202 --> 01:20:28,169
- So are you. It's me
that's all screwed up.
- I have a confession to make.

1442
01:20:28,402 --> 01:20:31,914
You knew the whole time,
but you were too damn decent
to confront me while I was...

1443
01:20:31,985 --> 01:20:34,853
No, I've been seeing
Sheldon Flender.

1444
01:20:34,928 --> 01:20:37,710
- Pa-Pa-Pardon me ?
- We've been having an affair.

1445
01:20:37,744 --> 01:20:41,420
- Did you say Sheldon Flender ?
- Yes, he's been in love
with me for a long time.

1446
01:20:41,488 --> 01:20:44,358
Do you know his theory that art
is relational, that it requires two...

1447
01:20:44,432 --> 01:20:46,318
the artist
and the audience ?

1448
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:48,293
- He feels that way about sex too.
- About... About sex ?

1449
01:20:48,367 --> 01:20:51,465
Yes, between the two right people,
it can become an art form.

1450
01:20:51,534 --> 01:20:55,527
Are you saying that you and
Flender have raised intercourse
to the level of an art form ?

1451
01:20:55,598 --> 01:20:57,451
Not just intercourse.
Foreplay too.

1452
01:20:57,516 --> 01:21:00,102
- My friend, the unproduced playwright ?
- He's been after me a long time.

1453
01:21:00,141 --> 01:21:04,233
You never seem to want to get married,
and so, one night we went out,
had a few drinks...

1454
01:21:04,301 --> 01:21:07,465
and started discussing art
and literature and Freud and Nietzsche.

1455
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,216
And in order to illustrate
a point on Greek etymology...

1456
01:21:10,283 --> 01:21:12,137
I noticed he'd
unbuttoned his fly...

1457
01:21:12,202 --> 01:21:15,432
No, no, no, no ! Please, please !
I don't need to hear any more.

1458
01:21:15,467 --> 01:21:18,729
But he's a major talent. You've
said so yourself a million times.

1459
01:21:18,795 --> 01:21:22,590
With an intellect that big, you tend
to create your own moral universe.

1460
01:21:43,909 --> 01:21:46,461
- I just wanted to wish you good luck.
- Oh, darling.

1461
01:21:46,533 --> 01:21:49,533
You look pale.
No, no, not to worry.

1462
01:21:49,573 --> 01:21:54,043
Soon this town will belong to you.
We're having dinner Sunday night
with Gene O'Neill.

1463
01:21:54,114 --> 01:21:57,944
He's heard that your writing
is morbid and depressing.
He's dying to meet you.

1464
01:21:58,019 --> 01:21:59,874
- Oh, here's that brush.
- I know you'll be terrific tonight.

1465
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:03,070
Oh ! They're your words.

1466
01:22:03,139 --> 01:22:05,145
I'm just a vessel.

1467
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:07,931
You fill me.

1468
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:11,352
And this ? This is
just the beginning.

1469
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:16,158
I've been discussing all kinds of new
ideas for vehicles for me with my agent.

1470
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:19,071
There's a variety of women
I can play. As you get to know me...

1471
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:21,720
you'll see there's no limit
to my range.

1472
01:22:21,791 --> 01:22:24,890
They say that I can
still play late twenties...

1473
01:22:24,927 --> 01:22:28,089
but I say no, no,
thirty tops.

1474
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:30,776
We'll go to my house
in the Vineyard. It's quiet there.

1475
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:33,332
You can write.
I'll bring you coffee.

1476
01:22:33,372 --> 01:22:35,762
Listen, you better go.
I-I-It's 15 minutes to curtain.

1477
01:22:35,838 --> 01:22:38,227
I still haven't done
my breathing exercises yet.

1478
01:22:38,302 --> 01:22:41,334
Y-Y-You... Fate.
Fate has thrown us together.

1479
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,115
Merde.

1480
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:03,056
Take him.
Take him !

1481
01:23:03,128 --> 01:23:06,357
Let him leave me bereft,
without a penny. Go ahead. Take him.

1482
01:23:06,392 --> 01:23:09,774
But don't think it'll last forever.
The same thing'll happen to you.

1483
01:23:09,847 --> 01:23:13,642
Sylvia, I don't know
why you're so unhappy.

1484
01:23:13,718 --> 01:23:15,857
- Why you're such
a deeply unhappy person...
- Oh, God !

1485
01:23:15,926 --> 01:23:18,708
- But I want you to know that...
- Because you're taking my husband...

1486
01:23:18,774 --> 01:23:21,937
my life, the very core
of my being, you stupid idiot !

1487
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:24,531
I didn't ever mean to hurt you. I...

1488
01:23:24,595 --> 01:23:27,443
Oh, Edgar.

1489
01:23:27,476 --> 01:23:30,126
- I've just been speaking
with Dr. Philips.
- Yes.

1490
01:23:30,196 --> 01:23:34,931
Her explicit instructions are
that we, none of us,
leave the premises as of today.

1491
01:23:34,997 --> 01:23:37,297
How's she workin' ?

1492
01:23:37,523 --> 01:23:39,213
Good. Good, boss.

1493
01:23:41,074 --> 01:23:42,961
Out this morning.

1494
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:47,303
- Cheech.
- What's up, Mr. V. ?

1495
01:23:47,376 --> 01:23:51,599
Uh, nothin'.
I just wanted to talk.

1496
01:23:51,665 --> 01:23:53,553
- Yeah ?
- I'm a little sad these days.

1497
01:23:53,585 --> 01:23:56,302
- Sure. Yeah.
- You know how it is.

1498
01:24:01,712 --> 01:24:04,711
Curtain's gone up already.
Poor kid.

1499
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:07,757
Would've been a star,
don't you think ?

1500
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:11,563
Yeah. It's all right.
We'll take care of those Kustabeck guys.

1501
01:24:11,628 --> 01:24:15,272
- I wonder if it really was
the Kustabecks.
- Well, who else ?

1502
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:19,715
I don't know.
But we got some tips...

1503
01:24:19,788 --> 01:24:22,405
- That Charlie K. Had
nothin' to do with this.
- Really.

1504
01:24:22,635 --> 01:24:25,285
Yeah. Don't make
no sense anyhow.

1505
01:24:25,514 --> 01:24:29,410
I mean, the way things
were coolin' off and all.

1506
01:24:29,483 --> 01:24:31,969
I'll see what I can find out
on the street, ya know ?

1507
01:24:32,201 --> 01:24:35,550
- Where you rushin' off to ?
- Hey, you know, I told
the guys in the show...

1508
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:38,177
that I, uh, I'd stop by
and wish 'em good luck.

1509
01:24:38,248 --> 01:24:40,965
- I got friendly with
some of the stage hands.
- Did you ?

1510
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:43,007
- Yeah.
- That's unlike you.

1511
01:24:43,081 --> 01:24:44,934
- Why's that ?
- Unless they shoot crap.

1512
01:24:44,999 --> 01:24:48,131
No, you know, you see
the same faces every day. You know.

1513
01:24:50,056 --> 01:24:53,984
Marty Bannister said he saw you pick
up Olive the night she got it, Cheech.

1514
01:24:54,056 --> 01:24:56,869
- Me ?
- Didn't you tell me you didn't see her ?

1515
01:24:56,901 --> 01:24:58,788
Me ? Yeah,
I said I did.

1516
01:24:58,821 --> 01:25:03,392
I picked her up, and I dropped her off
a few blocks from the theater. Why ?

1517
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:06,306
- You had nothin' against Olive, did ya ?
- Olive ? Naw.

1518
01:25:06,371 --> 01:25:09,274
- I like Olive. Why ?
- I mean, you got along well ?

1519
01:25:09,348 --> 01:25:11,551
Olive and l, we got along good.
You know, Olive.

1520
01:25:11,619 --> 01:25:13,473
Olive was good for
a lot of laughs, right ?

1521
01:25:13,507 --> 01:25:15,612
- Except for a few tiffs here and there ?
- Right.

1522
01:25:15,682 --> 01:25:17,590
Olive's... You know.
We got along.

1523
01:25:19,329 --> 01:25:22,143
How come you didn't bring her
to me at the club, Cheech ?

1524
01:25:22,177 --> 01:25:25,974
She said you changed your mind, that
I should drop her off at the theater.

1525
01:25:26,017 --> 01:25:29,496
- The theater. At night ?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1526
01:25:29,535 --> 01:25:32,699
There was no preview
that night, Cheech. No rehearsal.

1527
01:25:32,767 --> 01:25:34,938
Really ?

1528
01:25:35,008 --> 01:25:38,040
How come you
left her alone, Cheech ?

1529
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:40,694
And you didn't come
to the club and tell me ?

1530
01:25:40,765 --> 01:25:44,443
I'm gonna level with you, all right ?
I had a crap game.
I didn't want to miss it.

1531
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:46,714
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

1532
01:25:46,782 --> 01:25:50,044
- Why you don't tell me ?
- You wanna lay off ?
I'm up to here in debts.

1533
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:51,963
- I'm tryin' to get even.
- Yeah ?

1534
01:25:52,028 --> 01:25:55,061
Yeah. Dice ain't been too lucky for me.
You know. You know how it is.

1535
01:25:55,099 --> 01:25:58,100
You keep tellin' me I gotta quit.
Ya know, I should.

1536
01:25:58,172 --> 01:26:00,026
- Cheech...
- Listen, listen.

1537
01:26:00,059 --> 01:26:03,156
I told the guys I'd wish them good luck
in the show. They're very superstitious.

1538
01:26:03,386 --> 01:26:06,287
I'm gonna find out who hit her,
all right ? I'll find out.

1539
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:08,369
All right.
I'll see ya later.

1540
01:26:13,273 --> 01:26:16,141
He did it, Nick.
I don't know what his grudge was.

1541
01:26:16,216 --> 01:26:18,768
Maybe they were
two-timin' ya.

1542
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:21,229
- What are you sayin' to me ?
- Take it easy, Nick.

1543
01:26:21,303 --> 01:26:24,303
It's only a guess.
But Marty Bannister saw them together...

1544
01:26:24,536 --> 01:26:26,869
and that pier is
Cheech's favorite spot.

1545
01:26:26,934 --> 01:26:29,651
Can't you see he was lyin', Nickie ?
Did you see the look on his face ?

1546
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:33,744
- He was scared.
- Look, Nick, I know you
don't like to think it...

1547
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:37,325
- But the gossip is, she
was runnin' around on ya.
- Don't say that !

1548
01:26:37,364 --> 01:26:40,048
- I'm only tryin' to help, Mr. V.
- Nickie.

1549
01:26:40,116 --> 01:26:41,971
He's only tryin'
to help.

1550
01:26:43,509 --> 01:26:45,363
Cheech and Olive.

1551
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:48,713
Fix him.

1552
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:52,331
Oh, it's goin' great.

1553
01:26:52,371 --> 01:26:56,396
Yeah, they're eating it up. Before,
I could smell money. Now I can taste it.

1554
01:26:56,465 --> 01:26:58,768
- Mmm, yeah.
- Hey, what's the matter ?

1555
01:26:58,835 --> 01:27:02,095
You look as though you're watchin'
a turkey. It's just the opposite.

1556
01:27:02,128 --> 01:27:05,423
- Where's Ellen ?
- Oh, she was too nervous to come.

1557
01:27:05,488 --> 01:27:08,171
This is Dr. Emilene Philips,
a family friend.

1558
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:10,248
- Hey. How's it goin' ?
- Cheech, how are ya ?

1559
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,766
Goin' great. Wonderful.
You need to cheer him up. I don't know.

1560
01:27:13,839 --> 01:27:15,726
- What's the matter ?
- What do you want ?

1561
01:27:15,758 --> 01:27:18,726
- It's goin' great, huh ?
- You killed Olive, Cheech.

1562
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:20,774
For that I can never
forgive you.

1563
01:27:20,847 --> 01:27:23,496
I don't care what kind of
genius you are.

1564
01:27:23,565 --> 01:27:27,176
Listen to that audience. Huh ? They got
'em right in the palm of their hand.

1565
01:27:27,244 --> 01:27:29,993
Hey, Cheech. It's over for you.
You're finished.

1566
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,915
I had such a wonderful time.

1567
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:36,102
I can't live like this,
the same routine over and over.

1568
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:39,881
You think the same thing's not gonna
happen to you as happened to me ?

1569
01:27:39,915 --> 01:27:42,784
You think you're not gonna be here
sitting with a hole in your sweater...

1570
01:27:42,859 --> 01:27:44,712
and a drink in your hand
someday ?

1571
01:27:44,777 --> 01:27:48,127
- Just wait !
- Cheech ! You should be out front.

1572
01:27:48,201 --> 01:27:51,168
You're about to miss my great scene.
Did you see the first part ?

1573
01:27:51,241 --> 01:27:55,974
- How did it go ?
Do you think they like it ?
- Great, great.

1574
01:27:56,039 --> 01:28:00,162
- Where's Cheech ?
- Get the fuck outta here.
Get outta here.

1575
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:03,645
Sucker.

1576
01:28:05,959 --> 01:28:08,892
- You crapped out for
the last time, Cheech.
- I think he's...

1577
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:12,124
I'm in the garden, Sylvia,
tending roses.

1578
01:28:12,196 --> 01:28:15,196
Oh, darling, if we just had a baby.

1579
01:28:15,269 --> 01:28:18,748
- That's all I think about.
- We've been through all this before.

1580
01:28:18,819 --> 01:28:21,853
Cheech ! Cheech.

1581
01:28:21,924 --> 01:28:23,996
David.

1582
01:28:24,035 --> 01:28:27,035
- The last line...
- Yes ?

1583
01:28:27,107 --> 01:28:28,994
In the play.

1584
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:33,437
Tell Sylvia Poston...

1585
01:28:35,362 --> 01:28:37,915
to say she's pregnant.

1586
01:28:39,489 --> 01:28:42,936
It'll be a great finish.

1587
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:46,041
- Oh, God, that's so great.
- No. Don't speak.

1588
01:28:47,648 --> 01:28:49,502
Don't speak.

1589
01:28:58,398 --> 01:29:02,107
"A masterpiece."
"A theatrical stunner."

1590
01:29:04,316 --> 01:29:07,131
"A work of art
of the highest quality.

1591
01:29:07,196 --> 01:29:10,360
One of the greatest moments of this
reviewer's experience was in Act III...

1592
01:29:10,588 --> 01:29:13,076
when the Lieutenant returns
and confronts his mistress.

1593
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:15,699
We hear distant gunshots,
which get louder and louder...

1594
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:20,309
bringing the Lieutenant's twisted
military past and violent tendencies...

1595
01:29:20,378 --> 01:29:22,353
into bold bas-relief.

1596
01:29:22,426 --> 01:29:27,061
Writer-director David Shayne
is the find of the decade.

1597
01:29:27,096 --> 01:29:30,413
- Where is David ?
- I don't know. I assumed he'd be here.

1598
01:29:45,494 --> 01:29:47,436
Flender !

1599
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:50,062
Flender, wake up.
It's David Shayne.

1600
01:29:50,133 --> 01:29:52,337
I need
to talk to you.

1601
01:29:52,372 --> 01:29:55,754
Please, Flender.
Flender !

1602
01:29:55,828 --> 01:29:59,057
Ha-ha ! Look who's here.
The big Broadway success.

1603
01:29:59,091 --> 01:30:01,130
I don't write hits.
My plays are art.

1604
01:30:01,202 --> 01:30:03,821
- They're written specifically
to go unproduced.
- Is Ellen there ?

1605
01:30:03,858 --> 01:30:05,832
- No, she's not here.
- I think she is.

1606
01:30:05,905 --> 01:30:08,327
Congratulations
on your hit, David.

1607
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:11,338
- I always knew ya had it in you.
- Yeah, well, you were wrong.

1608
01:30:11,378 --> 01:30:14,377
- I have to...
I have to ask you a question.
- What ?

1609
01:30:14,417 --> 01:30:16,969
Did you love me as the artist
or as the man ?

1610
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:20,869
- Both.
- Well, what if it turned out
that I wasn't really an artist ?

1611
01:30:20,944 --> 01:30:23,692
I could love a man if
he's not a real artist...

1612
01:30:23,758 --> 01:30:26,476
but I couldn't love an artist
if he's not a real man.

1613
01:30:26,543 --> 01:30:29,577
Th-This is all academic.
She's with me now. You're with me now.

1614
01:30:29,648 --> 01:30:32,233
- Do you really want to be with Flender ?
- Yes.

1615
01:30:32,303 --> 01:30:35,149
- Hey ! Flender is a great lover.
- Ohh.

1616
01:30:35,213 --> 01:30:39,403
- Hey, I slept with Flender.
He was just okay.
- Really ?

1617
01:30:39,469 --> 01:30:42,021
Rita, please !
What are you talking about ?

1618
01:30:42,092 --> 01:30:43,947
That was years ago, during
your free-love period.

1619
01:30:44,012 --> 01:30:46,880
I feel it's relational.
For me, he's great.

1620
01:30:46,955 --> 01:30:50,053
Huh, interesting. Are you talking
pure mechanics or what ?

1621
01:30:50,122 --> 01:30:52,490
- His technique is prodigious.
- Prodigious ?

1622
01:30:52,523 --> 01:30:56,614
- You're confusing sex and love.
- No, for me, love is very deep.

1623
01:30:56,682 --> 01:30:58,535
Sex only has to go
a few inches.

1624
01:30:58,569 --> 01:31:03,325
Y-You're all missing the point.
The point is, I can give
pleasure many times a day.

1625
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:06,335
Oh, now really, Flender.
What has quantity got to do with it ?

1626
01:31:06,409 --> 01:31:09,091
- Quantity affects quality.
- Says who ?

1627
01:31:09,127 --> 01:31:11,877
- Karl Marx.
- Oh, so now we're talking economics.

1628
01:31:11,944 --> 01:31:15,423
- Sex is economics.
- Bullshit. Ellen, come down here.
I wanna talk to you.

1629
01:31:15,495 --> 01:31:18,495
I love you. I wanna see you.
Come down here.

1630
01:31:18,567 --> 01:31:21,412
- All right.
- What do you mean "All right" ?
What about me ?

1631
01:31:21,478 --> 01:31:24,326
You're great, Flender, but it's no use.
I'll never get over David.

1632
01:31:24,358 --> 01:31:27,969
Couldn't you tell ? Each time
I climaxed, I'd scream, "David ! David !"

1633
01:31:28,005 --> 01:31:30,013
I thought you were saying,
"Do it ! Do it !"

1634
01:31:30,085 --> 01:31:32,866
Flender, stop it.
Leave 'em alone.

1635
01:31:32,932 --> 01:31:35,168
Can't you see
they love each other ?

1636
01:31:39,683 --> 01:31:42,649
I'm finished with it:
living in the garrets...

1637
01:31:42,722 --> 01:31:46,496
eating cheese and drinking wine
and analyzing art in coffee houses.

1638
01:31:46,561 --> 01:31:48,983
It's over.
I love you.

1639
01:31:49,058 --> 01:31:51,959
- I want us to get married.
We'll go back to Pittsburgh.
- But you're a success.

1640
01:31:52,033 --> 01:31:54,715
- You have a hit. Why the sudden change ?
- We'll have kids.

1641
01:31:54,783 --> 01:31:58,012
- Because I've wasted too much
time already. I love you.
- But you're an artist.

1642
01:31:58,079 --> 01:31:59,967
No, I'm not.
I'm not.

1643
01:32:00,031 --> 01:32:02,901
I'll explain it all to you on
the train back to Pittsburgh.

1644
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:06,259
There's two things of which I'm certain.
One is that I love you.

1645
01:32:07,551 --> 01:32:09,590
Two is that
I'm not an artist.

1646
01:32:10,589 --> 01:32:12,923
There, I said it,
and I feel free.

1647
01:32:12,989 --> 01:32:14,844
I'm not an artist.

1648
01:32:20,956 --> 01:32:22,844
- Will you marry me ?
- Yes.

1649
01:33:37,967 --> 01:33:42,310
We're all alone, no chaperone
can get our number

1650
01:33:42,382 --> 01:33:44,356
The world's in slumber

1651
01:33:44,430 --> 01:33:46,798
Let's misbehave

1652
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:48,963
There's something wild
about you, child

1653
01:33:49,037 --> 01:33:51,142
That's so contagious

1654
01:33:51,213 --> 01:33:53,318
Let's be outrageous

1655
01:33:53,388 --> 01:33:55,690
Let's misbehave

1656
01:33:55,757 --> 01:33:59,880
When Adam won Eve's hand
he wouldn't stand for teasin'

01:33:59,948 --> 01:34:04,617
He didn't care about

Let's misbehave
