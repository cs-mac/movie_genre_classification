00:00:57,304 --> 00:00:59,238
Sweetheart, remember that
you're doing pickup today

2
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:01,069
and you need to
call the face painter
for the party.

3
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:02,438
Oh, and Henry
needs more Lactaid.

4
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:03,635
All right. Got it.

5
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,235
Pick up the kids,
call the face painter,
get Lactaid. I got it.

6
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,506
Also, I'm gonna drop
by the new house

7
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:08,605
and see how
the work's coming.

8
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:09,740
Oh, okay, awesome.

9
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:10,908
Can you make sure
that you measure

10
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:12,144
the backyard for
the bouncy castle?

11
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:14,187
We're gonna have
a bouncy castle
at our birthday party?

12
00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:15,551
Do you want a bouncy castle?
Yeah.

13
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:17,919
Then, yes, we'll have
the best bouncy castle
in the whole world!

14
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:19,822
Bouncy castle!
Bouncy castle!
Bouncy castle...

15
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:21,622
And an Ultimate
Fighting Octagon?

16
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:23,090
Uh... I don't know
about that.

17
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:24,460
But, hey, you talked to me!

18
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:26,589
I was talking to Mommy.

19
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,662
Okay, but just now,
you talked to me
by saying that.

20
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:29,861
Why does she have
such a problem?

21
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:30,994
It's just a phase.
Don't push it.

22

PAM: Hey, sweetheart,
it hurts Daddy's feelings

23
00:01:32,706 --> 00:01:34,173
when you give him
the silent treatment.

24

I'm ready for school,
I'm ready for school!
Pick me up, pick me up!

25
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,808
All right. Hey, Henry,

26
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,278
you know
you can't bring
Arthur to school.

27
00:01:40,347 --> 00:01:41,780
But he's my best friend.

28
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:43,008
Honey, he's your
best lizard friend.

29
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,880
You've got lots of
non-lizard friends.

30
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:46,007
Not really.

31
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,809
Really?

32
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:48,877
Nope.

33
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:50,415
Oh. All right,
have a good day.
I love you.

You're kidding me!

35
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:53,649
You can't take that
to school, monkey.
Go put that in your room.

36
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:55,256
Sam, I will see you.
I love you.

Hey.

See you.

How's it going?

Wonderful to see you.
Great to see you.

47
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,119
Listen, I just
came by to check out
the backyard and measure

48
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,587
'cause we want to do
a bouncy castle for
the kids' birthday party.

That's terrific, Gregory.

00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:41,569
Okay, you're about
five minutes late.

52
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:42,835
Yeah, I know.

She wants to get a list
of the budget cuts.

You have a meeting
in 20 minutes
with John Raider

56
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,251
and some drug rep
from Pfosten Pharmaceuticals

is waiting in your office.
Andi something.

58
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:56,246
There's a drug rep in there?

59
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:57,347
Mmm-hmm.

60

pop your head in
and tell me I have to
go to my next meeting.

62
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:01,883
Okay.
All right?

63
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:05,787
Sorry, I got to
make this really quick.
I got a very busy morning.

64
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:10,067
I understand,
Nurse Focker.
I'm Andi Garcia.

65
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:11,125
Oh, hi.

66
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:13,596
You have a lot less
stubble in person.

67
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:18,269
I'm... There's an actor
named Andy Garcia.

68
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:19,601
Who?

69
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,545
Widow's peak.
Sort of tough guy.

70
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,579
I was just kidding.
Of course, I know
who Andy Garcia is.

71
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:27,677
I get that all the time.

72
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:29,278
Yeah. You must
get it all the time

73
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:30,823
'cause you're named
Andi Garcia.

74
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:33,951
I loved the article
you wrote in the
AMA Journal,

75
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:35,517
"Putting Patients First."

76
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:37,229
You read that?
I loved it.

77
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:41,023
It was so cool getting
a nurse's perspective
on the health care crisis.

78
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:42,567
Yeah, that was the idea.

79
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:44,968
I actually started out
as a nurse, myself.

80
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:47,435
Really? Oh, well, nowadays,
I do less nursing and more...

81
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,973
Annoying meetings
with drug reps you'd rather
not deal with?

82
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,777
Hey, Greg, it's time
for your next meeting.

83
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:54,479
That's okay,
I'm fine, Kristen.
Thank you.

84
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:55,742
Yeah, but he doesn't
like to wait.

85
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:57,077
You know
how he is, you know.

86
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,445
Well, it's John Raider?

87
00:03:58,518 --> 00:03:59,746
Yeah, he's really picky...

88
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,980
He always runs late.
Always runs late. Thanks.

89
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,621
ANDI: You're swamped.
No, I'm good.
You want to have a seat?

90
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:05,949
Yeah.
Okay.

91
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:07,357
I'll make this quick.

92
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:10,692
So we are launching
a killer new product
at Pfosten

93
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:15,701
and, while we usually
hire doctors to lead
our presentations,

94
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,066
I have a feeling about you.

95
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,531
I think you have the potential
to be a medical superstar.

96
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:27,646
And you'd be perfect
to represent
our new drug, Sustengo.

97
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:33,551
Ah. Sustengo. All right.
It's an erectile
dysfunction medicine.

98
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,180
It's not just any erectile
dysfunction medicine.

99
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:39,885
It's the first ED pill
on the market
safe for heart patients.

100
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,624
Because, in addition
to increasing the penile
blood flow...

101
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:46,131
See that penis?

102
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,962
It acts as
a beta blocker

103
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:51,401
to keep the heart rate down
during intercourse.

104
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:52,836
I mean, how dope is that?

105
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:53,963
(CHUCKLES)

106
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,234
That's pretty dope.

WOMAN ON PA:
Nurse Focker needed
in room 220 B, stat.

108
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:59,140
I'm sorry,
hang on one second.

109
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:01,305

ANDROVSKY:
Will you get out of my ass?

111
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:04,177
If you would stop
squirming around...

112
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,581
But you don't know
what you're doing.

113
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:07,347
It could have
been over, sir.
Hey, hey, hey,

114
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,285
how you doing there,
Mr. Androvsky?
Everything okay?

115
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:10,687
Well, this nurse
is a barbarian.

116
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:11,883
Okay, I'm not a barbarian.

117
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,357
He keeps clenching
and I can't make an insertion.

118
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:14,586
Louis, it's...

119
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:15,787
It's a natural response
to protect that cavity.

120
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,261
You're right,
it is a natural response.

121
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,298
I would protect
my cavity, too.

122
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:20,765
And we just got to do it
a little bit gentler.

123
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,425
May I suggest something?

124
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:25,267
Sir, why don't you
extend your left leg

125
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:27,602
and put your right knee
right up to your chest.

126
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:30,302
It'll help relax
things down there.

127
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:31,639
She's right.

128
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:34,236
You just do that
and you just grab the side
of the bed there, like that,

129
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:35,474
and exhale...
There you go.

130
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:37,607
Nurse, did you sufficiently
lubricate the nozzle?

131
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,114
I did do that.
Great.

132
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:40,777
Good, good, okay.
You got this?

133
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:42,116
Yep.

134
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:43,951
GREG: All right.
Take a nice deep breath.

135

(INHALES DEEPLY)

136
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:50,526
And focus
on relaxing your anus.

137
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:53,657
Right. That's right.
You just want
to let it dilate,

138
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:56,759
sort of like
a flower opening up.

139

Blossoming lotus.

140

Sort of like
a desert cactus.

Maturing.

Just a little,
friendly visitor
just saying hello.

144

All right, I'm just gonna
stick it in a little further.

145
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:11,909
Oh!

146
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:14,442
Good smooth insertion.

00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:15,852
Thank you.

148
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:19,756
I'm gonna release the clamp.
And let it flow.

149
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:21,492
(SIGHS) Better.

150
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,189
How's that?

151
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:24,287
That was great.

152
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:29,992
Nice technique.

153
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,560
That was so fun.

154
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:33,772
Yeah, yeah.

155
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,400
I was thinking about it
and, honestly,

156
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:39,240
I just don't have time
to moonlight pitching
a drug right now.

312
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:03,819
GREG: Yeah.

313
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:05,921
Greg, honey,
it's your buddy, Kevin.

314
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:07,226
Hold on.
Thank you.

315
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:08,898
Hey.
Hey.

316
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:10,025
How you doing, man?

317
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:12,134
I was just doing
a little sailing

318
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:14,298
and living the dream,
G-Diggity-Dog.

319
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,529
Cheers!
Kevin.

320
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:17,303
Hey.
You need a refill on that

321
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:18,741
goji berry smoothie?

322
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:21,275
You read my mind.
Fill her up, Pak-Man.

323
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:23,242
Greg, you know
Deepak Chopra, right?

324
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,839
I know of him.

325
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:26,951
Hi, Greg.
Hi, Mr. Chopra.

326
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,644
Dr. Chopra.

327
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:31,086
KEVIN: Get out of here,
you rascal.

328
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:36,321
So, listen, the reason
why I'm calling is
because next week...

329
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:38,329
Kevin, who do
you Skype with?

330
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:41,093
I am just talking
to my friend, Greg Focker.

331
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:42,929
Hey.
KEVIN: Come here.

332
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,970
Hey, honey,
what'd you do with
Henry's Lactaid?

333
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,064
(BOTH LAUGHING)

334
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:50,905
Oh, crap, I forgot. Sorry.

335
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:52,508
Well, okay.
But did you call
the face-paint lady?

336
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:54,738
No, I'm sorry.

337
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,577
I had, like,
97 things to do, so...

338
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:59,482
Honey, I asked you
to do two things,
that's all I asked.

339
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:00,985
I know. Sorry, babe.

340
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:03,816
(CLEARS THROAT)

341
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:07,618
Okay, so here's the dealio.

342
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:10,025
I'm going to propose
to Svetlana.

343
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,190
You're gonna propose?
That's incredible.

344
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:16,599
I'm gonna have three Russian
MiG fighter jets fly by

345
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:19,034
and skywrite
"Marry me, Svetlana."

346
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:24,099
And then I'm gonna hide
a 50-carat super-tasteful
diamond ring

347
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:26,441
in this tin of
extremely rare beluga.

348
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:29,003
Then we will
finish the night

349
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:31,948
with a special performance
that I choreographed

350
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:35,543
with members of
the Bolshoi Ballet,
dedicated to our love.

351
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:36,679
Thoughts?

352
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,415
Honestly, I'm thinking
maybe it's a little
too involved.

353
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,614
Yeah?

354
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:42,752
I mean, with Pam,
my whole thing was just

355
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:45,058
keep it simple,
speak from the heart.

356
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:50,969
Keep it simple
and speak from the heart.
I like it, hombre.

357
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:54,404
You know what?
I'd better call off some
Russian MiG fighter jets.

358
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:57,408
And, hey, by the time
I get to Chi-town,

359
00:14:57,476 --> 00:15:00,343
this old dog here
could be an engaged man.

360
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:01,402
(WHOOPS)

361
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:02,809
Hey, Kevin?
Yeah.

362
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:03,871
The jet skis are ready!

363
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,939
The jet skis are ready?

364
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:06,678
Well, fire 'em up for me.
Okay.

365
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:08,515
I'll be right there.

366
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:10,286
Jet-skiing monks.

367
00:15:11,357 --> 00:15:15,020
Wow, I cannot believe
that Kevin is
finally settling down.

368
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:16,459
Well, I think
he's found a soul mate.

369
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:17,553
Yeah?

370
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,962
Hey, you're gonna
eat some of this.
She seemed nice.

371
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:22,900
Yeah. I am very happy
for Kevin.

372
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:25,096
I love him,
especially when he's
not obsessed with you.

373
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:27,099
Oh, come on.
You're being ridiculous.

374
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,098
(PHONE RINGING)
PAM: Oh, you got it?

375
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:30,469
Hey, sweetheart,
will you please

376
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:31,703
take a bite of
the lasagna, honey?

377
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:33,836
HENRY: No. Uh-uh.
Do you not like it?

378
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:36,147
Hey, what's the good word,
Grandpa Jack?

379
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:37,571
Yay!

380
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:38,706
JACK: Greg.

381
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,010
This is Jack Byrnes.

382
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,144
Yeah, I know.
I could tell
from the caller ID.

383
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:44,378
How are you doing?

384
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:47,654
Greg, excuse yourself
from the table by saying
these exact words,

385
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,061
"I don't know
if I still have it,
but let me check my files."

386
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,423
What?
If Pam asks you what I want,

387
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,100
tell her that I
asked you to locate
your birth certificate

388
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:57,499
for my genealogical work.

389
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,101
Just do it.

390
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,432
I don't know
if I have that, Jack,
but let me check my files.

391
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:06,601
Files? You have files?

392
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,046
Yes, yeah, I do.
I keep files.

393
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,414
He wants me to get
my birth certificate

394
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:14,350
for that family tree thing
he's doing.

395
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:17,881
Jack? Everything okay?

396
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,455
Everything is fine, Greg,
I suffered a minor
heart attack,

397
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,324
but I was able to
defibrillate myself

398
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:25,159
before going into
fatal cardiac arrest.

399
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:27,557
Jesus!
You defibrillated yourself?

400
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,030
The doctor said
I was a lucky man

401
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:30,363
and I've just
got to watch my diet

402
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:31,630
and keep my stress level down.

403
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:34,532
Wow, okay, so I guess

404
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:36,598
you guys aren't gonna be
able to come to
the twins' birthday party.

405
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:39,042
No, Dina and I
will be there
as planned, Greg.

406
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:42,774
And I was able to keep this
on a need-to-know basis.

407
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:45,544
And right now,
you're the only person
who needs to know.

408
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:48,743
Well, come on, Jack.
I mean, I think
Dina needs to know.

409
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:50,283
Greg, stop talking and listen.

410
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:51,482
Okay.

411
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:54,751
Now, my genealogical
research has allowed me
to track the Byrnes family

412
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:56,727
as far back as 1643.

413
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:58,358
1643?

414
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:01,164
Now, I wouldn't be
able to do that, say,
to your family,

415
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,565
what with all
the wandering peddlers
and nameless peasants.

416
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:04,660
Mmm-hmm.

417
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:05,726
But, as long as there
have been Byrneses,

418
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:07,136
there's always
been a patriarch

419
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:09,197
to lead our family through
good times and bad.

420
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,140
And I've finally
come to the realization

421
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,441
that the next in line
to the throne, Greg,

422
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:15,571
is you.

423
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:17,204
Me.

424
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:20,641
Yes, you, Greg.

425
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,115
Well...
So my question is this,

426
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:26,523
in the event of my demise,
are you prepared
to lead this family?

427
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,053
You know, Jack,
we're right
in the middle of dinner.

428
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:32,461
Maybe we could talk
about this, you know,
when you come into town.

429
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:35,628
If I go down, Greg,
I need to know someone
will be responsible

430
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,464
for the whole Byrnes clan.

431
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:41,097
So I ask you, Greg,
are you prepared to be

432
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,198
the Godfocker?

433
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:48,106
The Godfocker?

434
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:49,979
The Godfocker.

435
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:55,314
Well, that is a very powerful
turn of phrase, Jack.

436
00:17:55,388 --> 00:18:00,018
And when you say Godfocker,
I mean... (CHUCKLES)

437
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:03,084
I mean, I think
I know what you mean,
but I'm just...

438
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:05,790
What exactly does that mean?

439
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:09,598
It's an attitude, Greg.
It's a confidence.

440
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:10,828
It's the way
you carry yourself

441
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:13,428
that lets the world
know that the buck
stops with you.

442
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:17,206
Yeah, I hear you. Mmm-hmm.

443
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:20,410
None of this can be achieved
without the basics.

444
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:21,741
A secure home for your family,

445
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:24,742
a top-notch education
for your children...

446
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:25,873
Okay.

447
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:28,783
...and last but not least,
having your financial
house in order, Greg.

448
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:29,912
Is that it? (LAUGHS)

449
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:31,453
Are you laughing?

450
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,185
Yeah, no, I'm just...
I was making... No.

451
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,849
Because this is no
laughing matter, Greg.

452
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:37,489
Good, 'cause
I'm not laughing. Okay?

453
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,965
Are you saying
you have what it takes
to be the Godfocker?

454
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:44,028
Greg?

455
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:48,768
Yes, Jack.
I have what it takes

456
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:52,310
to be the Godfocker.

457
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:56,882
I feel like a great weight
has been lifted
off my shoulders.

458
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,414
And an equally
great weight put onto yours.

459
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,378
I like it.
I like the weight.
I want it.

460
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:07,416
All right. Need-to-know.

461
00:19:07,526 --> 00:19:08,857
Need-to-know.
Just you and me.

462
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:09,952
See you in two weeks.

463
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:11,860
Okay. Bye.

464
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,301
Hey, did you find it?

465
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:23,034
Find what?

Your birth certificate?

467

Yes. It was in my files.

468
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:28,836
Mmm.

469
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:30,704
You know, I was thinking,
maybe we should

470
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:33,013
take a look at that
Early Human School.

471
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:36,210
Great. I'll make
some phone calls
and set up a tour.

You gonna have your lasagna?

476
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:50,465
No, thank you.

477
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:57,840
You know,
your mother worked very hard
making that lasagna for you.

478
00:19:58,377 --> 00:19:59,935
No. It tastes funny.

479
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:03,046
He said he was feeling
kind of queasy, so...

480

It's okay.

481

Henry,

482
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:12,315
I'm your father
and I'm requesting of you
to eat the lasagna.

483
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:15,890
Fine.

00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:18,791

I know, Greg. I called you.

have to make a whole

Why not?

DINA: Greg.

531
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,453
Well, I remember
at last year's Thanksgiving,

532
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,220
Jack said he liked
roast turkey so much

533
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:30,386
and he couldn't
understand why people
only had it once a year.

534
00:22:30,562 --> 00:22:32,154
Excellent memory, Greg.

535
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:35,495
Plus, it's a wonderfully
lean meat. Healthy.
Good for your heart.

(CHUCKLES) Such a sweetheart.

537
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:40,470
Grandpa Jack,
can I ask you a question?

538
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:41,870
You surely can.

539
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,601
How come you're afraid
of lizards?

540
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:47,304
Henry, that's
a very good question.
And I'll tell you why.

541
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:50,405
When I was stationed
in the Mekong Delta
during the Vietnam War,

542
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:54,077
a tiny gecko crawled
into my ear one night
and laid its eggs.

543
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:58,783
And I had to endure
the torturous probing
of our unit's medic

544
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:00,950
to remove the lizard larvae
from my ear canal

545
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:03,085
before they hatched
into my brain.

546
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:04,322
Jack.

547
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:05,385
Cool.

548
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:06,922
Yuck.

549
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:08,489
Yes, thanks for
sharing that, Dad.

550
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:13,298
All right,
gobble, gobble, everybody!
It's turkey time!

Looks great, Greg.

555

Thank you, Jack.
And to carve it,

556
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:26,173
I thought we might use
the beautiful
Irish hunting knife

557

emblazoned with
the Byrnes family crest

558

brought back for us

Wow.
Look at that.

562
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:40,231
See that crest?
That was used
by your ancestors

563
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,530
long time ago,
back in the olden days,
to identify their family.

564
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:45,469
Daddy, can I ask
you a question?

00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:48,470
Absolutely.
He loves history.
Just soaks it up.

566

it's a lot of responsibility
on my plate.

But that's kind of
what I love about it.

to manage an entire unit,

I'm still trying to
make sense of it myself.

to get married?"

a little piece of string

around her finger,

00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,609
She caught the next
plane out of there.
Adios, Kevin.

626
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,807
Your proposal seems
way out of character.

627
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:08,608
Why did you put
so little effort into it?

628
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:09,970
Greg told me to.

629
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,983
What are you...
Kevin, no, no.

630
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:15,186
What are you talking about?
I didn't...
HENRY: Daddy?

631
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,514
I can't sleep.

632
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:18,417
Still in diapers.

633
00:26:18,757 --> 00:26:21,225
No, Jack, they're pull-ups.
We're weaning him off diapers.

634
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,649
What's up, man?

635
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:25,390
I can't stop thinking
about all that blood.

636
00:26:25,464 --> 00:26:27,523
Really? All right, well,
how about I read you a story?

637
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,998
Uncle Kevin!

638
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:30,398
How you doing, tiger?

639
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:32,130
Good.
Oh!

640
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:33,226
Wow.

641
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:35,366
Are you having
a hard time sleeping?

642
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,874
Yeah.
Oh.

643
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:40,100
(CRACKS)

644
00:26:41,647 --> 00:26:43,171
There we go.

645
00:26:43,248 --> 00:26:44,237
Jesus. Henry?

646
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:46,712
Are you...
Shh. He's sleeping.

647
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,247
He's sleeping.
I put him in a still-point.

648
00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:52,055
It's a massage technique

649
00:26:52,124 --> 00:26:54,115
that relaxes
the body by gently

650
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:56,422
easing the flow of
cerebrospinal fluid.

651
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:58,129
Yeah. Look at him.

652
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:00,323
He's gonna wake up
feeling so refreshed.

653
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:03,326
I've been studying
a lot of Eastern medicine
in my down time.

654
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:06,364
Well, listen,
I just came by
to say my hellos,

655
00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:07,928
so I will head on out.

656
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,029
Good.
Okay.

657
00:27:09,107 --> 00:27:11,166
Hey, Kev, listen,
do you need a place to stay?

658
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:13,473
No, he doesn't.
You got a place
to stay, right?

659
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:15,103
And we're pretty full up.
Not a problem.

660
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,011
I volunteer at a South Side
homeless shelter.

661
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:18,481
So, I'll probably
stay there

662
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,983
and just work
the soup kitchen line
in the morning.

663
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:22,145
That is so
wonderful, Kevin.

664
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,347
Yeah, it's funny,
I feed them food,

665
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:26,653
but those vagrants
and drifters feed my soul,

666
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:28,820
so it works out
pretty good for all of us.

667
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:31,190
Perfect.
We always need extra hands,

668
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:32,958
if you guys wanna
come on down tomorrow...

669
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:35,531
Actually, Greg and I
are taking a tour
of this place called

670
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,295
the Early Human
School tomorrow.

671
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:38,495
But maybe after...
You're kidding me,

672
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:39,695
the Early Human School?

673
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:41,094
Right.

674
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:42,902
My investment group
handles their endowment fund.

675
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:44,806
In fact,
the director, Prudence,

676
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:46,639
is a dear friend
and ex-lover of mine.

677
00:27:47,713 --> 00:27:49,180
I'm gonna put in
a good word for you.

678
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:51,339
That would be great,
wouldn't it?

679
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:52,572
Oh, of course.

680
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:55,313
Or not. I mean,
you know, she's an ex-lover,
I think that'd be awkward.

681
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:58,184
No, nonsense.
I'm on great terms
with all my ex-lovers.

682
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:01,021
Thanks.
Sure.

683
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:05,420
Okay. All right,
well, you know,
whatever feels right.

684
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:08,295
After the tour, Greg,
I was hoping you'd
show us your new house.

685
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:09,664
And, Kevin,
when you're done
feeding the bums,

686
00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:10,997
why don't you meet us there?

687
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:12,661
Okay. I'll be there.

688
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:14,672
You know what, Jack?
I still have some items
on the punch list

689
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,764
to go through
with the contractors,

690
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:17,604
so I'm thinking
maybe we should
put it off for a few days.

691
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,540
Ah, no,
let's do it tomorrow.
Well, I think...

692
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:20,942
We'll meet you
there at noon, Kevin.
I don't know.

693
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:22,571
At noon?
Yeah, all right.
Okay.

694
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:24,239
And we're gonna
get you through this.

695
00:28:24,316 --> 00:28:26,511
Anything you need,
you come to me.

696
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:27,745
Okay. Thanks, J.B.

697
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:29,218
Yeah. Or me.

698
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:32,815
Okay.

699
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:34,722
Well, you can come
to either of us.

700
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:35,987
Yeah, we're here for you.

701
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:37,221
Thanks.

702
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:39,320
Careful, yeah.

703
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:45,067
PAM: I feel like crap.
GREG: Yeah.

704
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,359
You're burning up.

705
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:49,373
Yeah, I must have
gotten the flu
the kids had last week.

706
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:50,499
Oh, my God,
the school tour is today.

707
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:51,564
Yeah, I know.

708
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:52,905
Honey, what am I gonna do?

709
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:54,206
I'll do it. Okay?
I'll handle it.

710
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,268
Yeah?
Yeah, and your mom

711
00:28:55,347 --> 00:28:56,439
can take the kids
to school.

712
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:57,982
But what about my dad?

713
00:28:58,183 --> 00:28:59,673
I got it, all right?

714
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:06,255
I really appreciate
your including me
on the school tour, Greg.

715
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:09,316
Oh, Jack, you are
a trusted advisor.

716
00:29:09,694 --> 00:29:13,221
I mean, your words
hit home about
a top-notch education,

717
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:14,595
getting your
financial house in order.

718
00:29:14,699 --> 00:29:15,996
That's it. That's it.

719
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:17,296
It's all about
the kids, right?

720
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:18,597
The next generation.

721
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,864
I'm glad to
hear you say that.

722
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:21,696
Makes me feel that
I've chosen wisely.

723
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:24,708
Of course,
children change
everything in a marriage,

724
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:26,334
and that was the issue
with Debbie and Bob.

725
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:29,073
They stopped finding
time for each other
once LJ came into their lives,

726
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:31,445
so Bob sought
sexual fulfillment
outside the marriage.

727
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:32,505
Mmm.

728
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:34,584
Dr. Bob.
Dr. Bob.

729
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:36,119
He really disappointed me.

730
00:29:36,688 --> 00:29:40,351
I'll tell you something.
I'd like to really teach
that bastard a lesson.

731
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,649
I happen to have
his new address.

732
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:44,352
Perhaps you and I should
sneak in there one night

733
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:46,727
and plant a tiny
explosive device
in the stove.

734
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:48,663
Make it look like a gas leak.

735
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:52,967
Yeah. Yeah.

736
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:55,105
Or we could,
you know, maybe

737
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:58,472
find some less criminal way
of teaching him a lesson.

738
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:00,636
You know, still get him.

739
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:02,440
I'm only joking, Greg.

740
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:03,776
(CHUCKLING) Okay.

741
00:30:04,683 --> 00:30:05,672
But it would be fun.

742
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,739
Yeah, oh,
it would be great.

743
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:10,277
I'm hoping that you and Pam
are still finding time
for each other.

744
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:12,247
Oh, yeah.

745
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:14,155
Yeah, are you kidding?
Yeah, no, no,
we're great, we're...

746
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:15,248
Good.

747
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:16,589
I mean, you know,
it's not easy.

748
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:17,821
You got to work
at it, but...

749
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:20,161
Are you still
physically attracted
to my daughter, Greg?

750
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:25,367
To Pam? Are you kidding? Yes.
Jack, there's never been
a problem with that.

751
00:30:25,837 --> 00:30:29,273
Even after her body's
endured the hellish ordeal
of birthing twins?

752
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:34,841
Yes. Even after that.
It's still... It's all good.
It's all good under the hood.

753
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:38,515
That's disgusting.

And at E.H.S., we know.

759
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:04,534
We know that no two
early humans are alike.

760
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:09,170
So why should their
educational experiences
be identical? Right?

761
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:11,177
Makes sense.

762
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:15,212
It's not about
the 99.8 % of graduates

that go on to the best

Yeah.

that become civic leaders,

00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:04,263
And, you know,

781
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:06,236
if it's not covered
right now,
it will be covered.

782
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:09,063
It's one of those things
that you cover it.

783
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,334
Do you have the money
or not, Greg?

784
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:11,739
New friends, hello!

785
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,902
Hi.

786
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:14,002
Hi, I'm Prudence. Greg?

787
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,068
Greg. How are you?

788
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:16,340
Jack?
Jack Byrnes.

789
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:19,781
So, Jack and Greg,
tell me what path
you've chosen.

790
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:23,714
How do you make a "living"?

791
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:26,152
Oh, okay, well,
I'm a nurse.

792
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:27,548
Oh.

793
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:29,048
He's being modest.

794
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:31,823
He's actually
the department manager
of the medical-surgical unit

795
00:32:31,896 --> 00:32:35,627
at Chicago Memorial
and I am a retired florist.

796
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:38,299
What a combination,
a nurse and a florist?

797
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:40,068
How great.

798
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:42,106
May I ask how long
you've been
in each other's lives?

799
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:44,472
Oh, I'd say... Well,
it's about eight years,
hasn't it been?

800
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:45,770
Yeah, eight years.

801
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:47,239
I'd say eight years.
Really?

802
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:48,438
Yeah, yeah.
Eight great years. Yeah.

803
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:49,775
Eight great years.

804
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:51,509
Well, it started out
a little rocky.

805
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:53,048
We've had our moments.

806
00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:54,676
Yes, but then
we figured it out.

807
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:56,914
You seem like
a wonderful couple.

808
00:32:58,623 --> 00:33:00,352
No, no, no.
We're not homosexuals.
Yeah, no.

809
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:02,188
No, no. No, no, no, no,
this is my son-in-law.

810
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:04,489
Yeah, yeah,
no, no, no, no.

811
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:09,057
However, if you're
looking to fill a quota,
we can be flexible.

812
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:12,562
Okay, that's an
interesting joke,

813
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:15,572
but I appreciate
levity in a moment
of misunderstanding,

814
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,039
so thank you, Greg.

815
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:18,736
I will say, Jack,
I hope I didn't offend you.

816
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,004
Oh. No, no.

817
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:21,067
Really?

818
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:24,240
No. I mean,
I'm not gay myself,
but if I were gay,

819
00:33:24,316 --> 00:33:28,150
I would certainly be proud
to choose a life partner
like Gay Focker.

820
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,249
And that's
his actual name.

821
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:31,911
Oh.

822
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,117
It is. Well,
it's my, Gaylord was my name
when I was a kid and, yeah.

823
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:38,919
Well, I'll complete
the conversation with that.

824

Change that nametag.

828
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,665
You can call...
It's Greg. Greg is fine.

829
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:49,400
Why don't we just
stick with the truth?

830

Greg, very nice.

KEVIN: Yeah.

or something.

837

Supposedly eco-friendly,

838
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:26,202
Yeah, you got it.

839
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:27,835
Wow. It looks great.

really good bones.

what is this?

848
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,628
Gregory Focker!

849
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:46,326
Great to see you.
How you doing, Dad?

850
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:47,422
GREG: Hey.

851
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:49,797
Randy, what is this?
We're having the party
here in two days.

852
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,330
RANDY: Um...

853
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:52,836
Refresh my memory, Gregory.

854
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:55,863
Are you kidding me?
Randy, the twins'
birthday party, remember?

855
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:57,165
Yes, of course!

856
00:34:57,842 --> 00:34:58,831
The issue
we're dealing with is

857
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,279
that we had to excavate
60 feet of root-infested
pipe back here!

858
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:05,145
So, of course,
we ran into some
unexpected costs

859
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:06,843
along with an obvious delay.

860
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:09,409
Randy, is this yard
gonna be done or is it
not gonna be done?

861
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:10,920
Jack, I got this.
All right?

862
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:14,388
KEVIN: All Mr. Byrnes
is suggesting is that
maybe inadvertently

863
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:17,526
you're taking advantage
of a gentle, trusting soul

864
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:20,530
who clearly is an amateur
when it comes to
home construction.

865
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,498
No, Kevin.
Thank you, Swami Salami.

866
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:23,898
That's not true at all.

867
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:25,299
It is true, Greg.
They're ripping you off.

868
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,167
No, Jack...
Your plumbing excavators

869

have been on coffee break
for the past eight minutes,

halfway through
a Sudoku puzzle.

All right.

873
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:38,847
who is this joker
questioning my honor?

874
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:40,680
Nobody's questioning
your honor, Randy.

875
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:42,549
I'm 34 years in the trade!

876
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,814
Thirty-four years, huh?

I got to pump, dump
and hump to get that
backyard whole again!

878

Well, I got news for you.
You can pump, dump
and hump all you want!

879

You're sandbagging
this damn job
and you know it.

880
00:35:52,464 --> 00:35:53,488
All right. You know what?

I have a timeshare in town.

887
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,338
Why don't we have
the party there?

888
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:09,107
Beautiful meadow.
It'll be perfect.

889
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,977
No, no, Kevin,
I promised the kids

890
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:12,778
they're gonna have
the party in the yard.

891
00:36:12,851 --> 00:36:16,287
So, guess what?
We're gonna have the party
in the yard. Okay?

892
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:18,413
Soon as our
dump truck driver's
back from lunch,

893
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,185
we'll get that out,
bring the backhoe in,

894
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:21,885
lay down your
base layer of sand.

895
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:24,625
Wait a minute.
You're telling us that
you can't move that rig?

896
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:26,387
That's a union job, pops.

897
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:28,261
Screw it. I'm gonna
move that truck myself.

No, you know what, Jack?

You just help me

900

back it out
into the street.
I got it.

901

Here we go.

902
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:36,965
All right,
start backing her up.
You're all clear.

903
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:44,141
Coming at you, Jack!

904
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:46,078
You're doing great,
you're doing great.

905
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:49,547
Hey, look,
I'm not in the union, Randy!
I'm backing up the truck!

906
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:53,313
Come on. Back, back, back.
Doing great. Doing great!
Doing great!

907
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:55,158
Whoa! Whoa!

00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:00,487
You got it!

911
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:02,731
We're good.

912
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:04,023
Got it!

all right, Jack!

918

Hang on, Jack!

919
00:37:20,218 --> 00:37:21,207

MAN: Sex!
Sex. Sex.

934
00:37:58,556 --> 00:37:59,921
Well, what else is she
gonna talk about?

935
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:02,186
Sex after children.

936
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:04,319
How do you find
time to make love

937
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:05,919
with young children
in the house?

938
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:08,656
What do you do
if it's not working?

939
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:09,922
Do you have an affair?

940
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,463
ALL: No!

941
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:15,169
No, you say?
But Roz Focker says yes!

942
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:17,768
Yes, you do have an affair!

943
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:21,410
You have an affair
with your wife!

944
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,174
Oh, Roz!

945
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:24,646
ROZ: Think about it, right?

946
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:28,152
You dress up a little nicer.
You meet at a hotel.

947
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:29,681
You role play.

948
00:38:30,088 --> 00:38:35,890
There is absolutely no shame
in playing out a fantasy,
but with each other!

949
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,359
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

950
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:38,554
All right?

951
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,294
Now, he's gonna kill me,
(GIGGLES)

952
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:48,195
but my own son,
who is the father
of two adorable twins,

953
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,671
he has issues
in this department.

954
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:54,573
He's busy at work.
She's busy at home.

955
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:57,477
Their intimacy
numbers are down.
They're not connecting.

956
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,147
And what do you do?

957
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:02,942
It's called Sustengo.
Sustengo?

958
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:05,012
I got to say, that sounds
pretty cheesy, Greg.

959
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:08,320
Yeah, well,
I'm looking at these
Randy Weir bills, okay.

960
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:09,553
And we could definitely
use the money.

961
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:11,490
And do me a favor.
Don't tell your dad
about this, okay?

962
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:12,859
My dad? Why?

963
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,625
Just 'cause
he's been all into

964
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:17,563
me having
my financial house
in order or whatever,

965
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:19,296
and I just don't
want to worry him.
All right, fine.

966
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:21,366
I won't say anything
because he's already
pretty upset

967
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:23,464
about you trying to bury
him alive. (LAUGHS)

968
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:24,834
Honey, it was an accident.

Hey. Hey, can you
hang on a second?

971
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,668
Okay.

972
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:30,846
I am so stoked
you changed your mind.

973
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:34,051
You are going to rock
those urologists tonight.

974
00:39:34,118 --> 00:39:35,676
Awesome.
That's always been
a goal of mine.

975
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:38,046
So, I'll see you
at 8:00 at the Hilton?

976
00:39:38,122 --> 00:39:39,111
Yes.

977
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,158
And wear a suit.
Wear a suit, got it.

978
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:42,749
Knuckles?
Knuckles.

979
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:43,916
Okay, bye.

980
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:45,854
Hey.
Hello.

981
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,420
Knuckles? Who was that?

982
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:49,159
That certainly
didn't sound like Kristen.

983
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,426
No, no.
That was the drug rep.

984
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:53,636
Andi?
Yeah, Andi.

985
00:39:54,138 --> 00:39:55,127
What does she look like?

986
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,667
She's like a...
No, she's, like,
an ex-nurse.

987
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:58,936
You wouldn't pick her
out of a lineup.

988
00:39:59,143 --> 00:40:00,371
Yeah, I know that
you're doing this for us,

989
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:03,175
but the idea of you
and some woman
named Andi

990
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:06,341
selling boner medicine
at a hotel, it really
kind of icks me out.

991
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:08,683
Honey, there's nothing
to be icked out about.

992
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:10,380
Okay, fine.

993
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:12,589
I love you.
I love you, too, honey. Bye.

994
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:13,851
Okay, bye.

(MIMICKING GUNSHOTS)

996
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:21,958
So, how come
you're not talking
to Daddy?

997
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,599
'Cause he said
you were cuckoo.

998
00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:25,460
He said I was cuckoo?

999
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:26,792
Mmm-hmm.

1000
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:28,866
Well, we'll have
to discuss that.

1001
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,329
Yeah.

1002
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,035
But what about
Mommy and Daddy?

1003
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,338
Is everything okay
with them?

1004
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:36,242
I guess
they fight sometimes.

1005
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:38,475
Mmm-hmm. And what do
they fight about?

1006
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,874
Um...

1007

Like Mommy got mad at Daddy
because he was going
to the hotel with Andi.

Who's Andi?

I can't say because
I'm not supposed
to be spying.

1012
00:40:51,963 --> 00:40:54,955
Like I always tell you,
there's nothing
wrong with spying

1013
00:40:55,032 --> 00:40:57,466
as long as you
suspect foul play.

1014
00:40:58,536 --> 00:40:59,935
So, who's Andi?

1015
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:02,705
Andi gives Daddy
his boners.

1016
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,603
His what?

1017

Andi gives Daddy his boners.

Hey, Greg?
Yeah.

I'm not so sure

1030
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:34,268
using chicanery
and subterfuge
on your daughter

1031
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:36,431
is the best way
to get her to
communicate with you.

No, no, no. That's not
chicanery and subterfuge.

Yeah.

It's the price of being
in charge of the unit, so...

I see.
That last minute, huh?

Yeah.

right across from the house.

Oh, is there?
I didn't know that.

1054

Just take a left
on Lincoln. Right there.

Following you?
Why would I be
following you?

1063
00:43:56,714 --> 00:43:58,341
No, I'm just
looking for milk.

1064
00:43:59,684 --> 00:44:03,279
Okay. 'Cause, remember,
I mentioned
out on the street there,

1065
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:04,878
there's a store
right in the neighborhood.

1066
00:44:05,122 --> 00:44:06,919
True, but Dina likes
the organic stuff

1067
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:09,459
and I heard there was
a natural food market
downtown.

1068
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,318
Amazing, you going
all this way just for
a carton of milk.

You know what?
You should get off here.

south of the station.

No, I'm good.
It's just my in-laws
are in town, so...

1080
00:45:05,649 --> 00:45:06,946
Anyway, I went over
the drug info

1081
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:08,576
and I think I got
the science down
pretty well.

Oh, no, Greg.
These doctors don't care
about that stuff.

If you want to sell
a drug like Sustengo,
you have to make it personal.

I didn't hear you come in.

1087
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,885
What kept you so long?

1088
00:45:46,123 --> 00:45:48,853
I just got
a little bit lost.
Everyone asleep?

1089
00:45:48,926 --> 00:45:49,915
Yeah.

1090
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:52,219
We've got
the house to ourselves.

1091
00:45:53,164 --> 00:45:58,966
I'm so happy that you
got away from your wife.

1092
00:46:00,137 --> 00:46:01,604
Excuse me?

1093
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:03,435
She's been
very suspicious lately.

1094
00:46:03,941 --> 00:46:06,739
Quick, quick, quick.
We only have an hour.

1095
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,843
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1096
00:46:10,915 --> 00:46:13,247
Jack, come on.
You've gotta play along.

1097
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:16,252
Roz Focker said
we have to have an affair
with each other.

1098
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,981
I'm role playing.

1099
00:46:18,055 --> 00:46:19,249
Right, right, right.
I understand.

1100
00:46:19,323 --> 00:46:23,089
I just have
a bit of a headache,
sweetheart, tonight.

1101
00:46:23,227 --> 00:46:26,663
I know. You've had
that worried look
on your face all day.

1102
00:46:26,864 --> 00:46:30,527
I promise you,
the Focker family
is going to be fine.

1103
00:46:30,968 --> 00:46:32,299
Now, come on.

1104
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,561
Before my husband
comes home.

1105
00:46:35,473 --> 00:46:38,738
Then, we'd better hurry,
my illicit lover.
Let me just brush my teeth.

1106
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:40,106
Ooh.

1107
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,782
Your father-in-law
did not really put you
in a lie detector machine.

1108
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:53,449
No, that's true.

1109
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:54,548
That's incredible!

1110
00:46:55,326 --> 00:46:58,193
Jesus Christ, I thought
my wife's father was bad.

1111
00:46:58,262 --> 00:46:59,320
That was
a great speech, nurse.

1112
00:46:59,864 --> 00:47:00,922
Thank you.

1113
00:47:00,998 --> 00:47:02,022
And hey,
"I'm staring at you."

1114
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:03,560
(LAUGHING)

1115
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:06,968
It was "I'm watching you,"
but that's what he did, yes.
Thank you.

1116
00:47:07,404 --> 00:47:09,235
You killed it tonight.

1117
00:47:09,673 --> 00:47:12,233
Those stories
about your family
were hilarious.

1118
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:14,174
Thank you.
So, I should be
getting going.

1119
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:16,939
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're my fiancé.

1120
00:47:17,047 --> 00:47:18,537
Hey, gorgeous.

1121
00:47:18,616 --> 00:47:21,141
Hello, Dr. Ballard.
So nice to see you.

1122
00:47:21,218 --> 00:47:24,745
Hey, can I get you 200 cc's
of anything you want, stat?

1123
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:28,889
Only if you can buy a drink
for my fiancé as well.

1124
00:47:29,827 --> 00:47:31,454
Didn't know
you were engaged.

1125
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:33,688
Can you
take a picture for us
for my scrapbook?

1126
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:35,527
You know what?
You don't...
He doesn't have to do that.

1127
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:36,623
ANDI: Yeah, it's for
our scrapbook.

1128
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,691
No, you know what, bro?
I'm cool like that.
I'll do that.

1129
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:40,293
You are such a doll.

1130
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:41,663
Here we go.

1131
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:43,670
One, two, three.
Whoa!

1132
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:45,864
Best picture ever.

1133
00:47:46,777 --> 00:47:49,007
You look great
and you have, like,
a red-eye problem.

1134
00:47:49,246 --> 00:47:50,406
I'll see you later, babe.

1135
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:52,711
I cannot believe
I ever slept with that guy.

1136
00:47:52,917 --> 00:47:53,941
Yeah, right.

1137
00:47:54,018 --> 00:47:55,246
No, seriously, I did.

1138
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:57,749
At a convention
in Milwaukee last summer.

1139
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:01,154
We were, like,
drinking tequila,
doing rum chasers.

1140
00:48:01,892 --> 00:48:03,450
Always a bad idea, right?

1141
00:48:03,527 --> 00:48:04,551
Yeah.

1142
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:06,729
Can you get me a margarita
on the rocks, no salt?

1143
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:09,732
You know what...
I'm gonna run
to the restroom.

1144
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,824
Gosh. You know what...

1145
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:11,890
All right, cool.
You're the best.

1146
00:48:12,503 --> 00:48:14,130
All right? All right.
All right, okay.

1147
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:19,107
Hi. Can I get a club soda
and a margarita
on the rocks with no salt?

1148
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:20,634
Thanks.

1149
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:22,342
Night out
on the town, Focker?

1150
00:48:23,747 --> 00:48:25,271
Dr. Bob.
Hey, man!

1151
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:26,338
What are you doing here?

1152
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:28,476
I'm here for the convention.
What about you?

1153
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,911
Doing some work for Pfosten
as a medical expert.

1154
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,079
But you're a nurse.

1155
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:37,624
You know what?
I don't really have
anything to say to you.

1156
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:41,929
Okay, I get it, Greg.
I screwed up.

1157
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:44,933
But the pressure
of being in that family
finally got to me.

1158
00:48:45,069 --> 00:48:47,060
What are you talking about?
You were his golden boy.

1159
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:48,796
More like his golden bitch.

1160
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:51,837
He wanted Deb and me
to get married
in Oyster Bay. Done.

1161
00:48:52,142 --> 00:48:54,201
Can we name
our baby after him?
"You got it, Jack."

1162
00:48:54,578 --> 00:48:56,910
And he gives me this
whole spiel, right,

1163
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:59,245
about how I'm next in line
to his throne.

1164
00:49:00,117 --> 00:49:02,779
He came up with
this name for me,
the Bobfather.

1165
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:08,189
Really? He said that to you?

1166
00:49:10,527 --> 00:49:12,085
He pulled the same shit
on you, didn't he?

1167
00:49:12,496 --> 00:49:16,330
In that family,
we're all just hamsters
on Jack Byrnes' little wheel.

1168
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,301
His Circus of Trust,
or whatever he calls it.

1169
00:49:20,004 --> 00:49:21,164
Circle of Trust.

1170
00:49:21,238 --> 00:49:23,502
I had no idea
how deep I was in
until I stepped away.

1171
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:24,563
And I'll
tell you something,

1172
00:49:24,642 --> 00:49:27,577
once I got off the treadmill,
I've never been happier.

1173
00:49:28,646 --> 00:49:30,273
Yeah, well, I think
I got it under control.

1174
00:49:44,194 --> 00:49:45,183
Hello, Greg.

1175
00:49:46,964 --> 00:49:47,953
Hey.

1176
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:49,997
Hey, Jack.

1177
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:52,692
You mind explaining this?

1178
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:55,961
What is that? Oh.

1179
00:49:56,907 --> 00:49:58,568
Sustengo. Yeah, that's...
You know.

1180
00:49:59,176 --> 00:50:01,474
These drug companies,
they give me
all these free samples.

1181
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:03,135
Is that it?

1182
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,746
Or do you need
to use this

1183
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:07,943
because you're no longer
sexually attracted to Pam?

1184
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:12,447
You know what, Jack?
That's ridiculous.

1185
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:13,683
Really. You know what?

1186
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:15,987
I'm not even gonna
go there with you.
This is...

1187
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,322
Have a good night,
all right?
I'm gonna go sleep.

1188
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,421
Don't walk away
from me, Focker.

1189
00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:27,359
Jack, is everything okay
down there?

1190
00:50:27,938 --> 00:50:29,030
Everything's fine.

1191
00:50:29,106 --> 00:50:32,041
Okay. All right.
'Cause you seem
to have a little, I mean...

1192
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:34,475
I know what I have, Greg,
and I'm not concerned
about that right now.

1193
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:36,536
Right now, what I want
from you is the truth.

1194
00:50:38,248 --> 00:50:42,275
Jack, did you take
one of those pills?

1195
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:44,314
Well, I was
highly preoccupied

1196
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:45,446
and Dina wanted
to make love,

1197
00:50:45,522 --> 00:50:47,956
and the label clearly
states that it's safe
for heart patients.

1198
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:49,515
Yes, but you need
a prescription

1199
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:51,618
after you've had
a thorough examination.

1200
00:50:51,695 --> 00:50:54,186
How long have you had that...
The situation for?

1201
00:50:55,032 --> 00:50:56,124
Stop avoiding the question.

1202
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,292
I'm not avoiding
the question.

1203
00:50:57,368 --> 00:50:58,926
If you've had that
for more than four hours,

1204
00:50:59,002 --> 00:51:02,062
you could bust a capillary
and have serious
permanent damage.

1205
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:03,367
How long
have you had it?

1206
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,907
Been a little longer
than four hours.

1207
00:51:04,975 --> 00:51:06,101
How long?

1208
00:51:06,176 --> 00:51:07,507
Maybe about five and a half.

1209
00:51:08,212 --> 00:51:09,873
Jack, you got to get
to an ER right now

1210
00:51:09,947 --> 00:51:11,710
and get a shot of adrenaline
to counteract that drug.

1211
00:51:11,782 --> 00:51:13,716
You're a nurse.
Don't you have that kind of
stuff in the house?

1212
00:51:13,784 --> 00:51:14,944
Yeah, I have an Epi kit,

1213
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:16,679
but I'm not gonna give you
a shot there, okay?

1214
00:51:16,754 --> 00:51:19,222
Focker, there is no way
I'm going to an ER room
with this thing.

1215
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:21,314
Now you need to stick me
and you need to stick me now!

1216
00:51:21,392 --> 00:51:22,484
I'm having a dick attack!
Stick me!

1217
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,756
(WHISPERING)
Shh. Just relax. Okay.

1218
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:26,853
I'll get the needle.

1219
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:36,099
All right. I need you
to drop your pants.

1220
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,770
What kind of sick drug
are you dealing
to your patients?

1221
00:51:39,843 --> 00:51:41,811
Jack, I told you,
I took home some samples.

1222
00:51:42,246 --> 00:51:43,577
All right?
Maybe read the label

1223
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:45,410
before you just pick up
a drug and eat it.

1224
00:51:45,482 --> 00:51:46,506
Let's just do it.

1225
00:51:48,018 --> 00:51:49,713
I'm gonna
administer the shot
on the count of three.

1226
00:51:50,854 --> 00:51:52,446
Just... All right?

1227
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:56,626
Okay. Just...

1228
00:51:56,693 --> 00:51:57,785
It's...

1229
00:51:57,861 --> 00:51:58,919
Your hands are cold.

1230
00:51:58,996 --> 00:52:00,725
I'm sorry.
It's a bit...

1231
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:01,992
Okay.

1232
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,894
One,

1233
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,496
two,

1234
00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:09,230
three.

1235
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:11,740
Focker!

1236
00:52:11,809 --> 00:52:12,798
(SCREAMING)

1237
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:15,473
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

1238
00:52:19,817 --> 00:52:21,512
Wait, what's going on?
What happened?

1239
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:23,780
Everything's fine.
Henry had
a little nightmare,

1240
00:52:23,854 --> 00:52:25,412
but Greg's got him
settled down, okay.

1241
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:27,389
No, no, Jack,
I thought I heard you
screaming, too.

1242
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:29,323
No, you didn't.
It was all Henry.

1243
00:52:29,393 --> 00:52:30,655
Well, let me go
check on him...
Oh, no, no, no.

1244
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:32,354
...and make sure he's okay.
You guys go to sleep.

1245
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:34,124
Everything's under control.

1246
00:52:38,735 --> 00:52:40,828
Could you and Dad
keep it down, please?

1247
00:52:41,905 --> 00:52:45,204
Here's Sirius Black.
Here's Orange Ninja, okay?

1248
00:52:45,943 --> 00:52:47,410
You all right?
Yeah.

1249
00:52:47,478 --> 00:52:48,877
JACK: (WHISPERS) Greg?
Yeah.

1250
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:51,405
How's he doing?
He's all right.

1251
00:52:51,482 --> 00:52:53,882
You know, he's
a little shaken up, but...

1252
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:56,818
Greg, I was involved
in some covert
CIA-sponsored

1253
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:59,082
mind-altering techniques
back in the '70s.

1254
00:52:59,156 --> 00:53:00,817
I'd like a few minutes
alone with him

1255
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:03,052
just to erase what
he saw from his memory.

1256
00:53:03,393 --> 00:53:05,418
You're not gonna erase
my son's memory.

1257
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:09,159
Greg, he saw his father
inject a needle into his
grandfather's penis.

1258
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:13,033
He already has issues.
That's something he might
never recover from.

1259
00:53:13,103 --> 00:53:15,230
I'll handle it, okay?
All right?

1260
00:53:15,305 --> 00:53:16,294
Okay, thank you.

1261
00:53:18,842 --> 00:53:21,072
Hey, buddy.

1262
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:24,978
So, you know how sometimes
you need help when you...

1263
00:53:26,216 --> 00:53:27,808
When you make a wee-wee?
Yeah.

1264
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:30,353
Well, when you get to be
Grandpa Jack's age,

1265
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,048
sometimes you need help
making a wee-wee, too.

1266
00:53:33,123 --> 00:53:34,283
So that's what you
saw me doing.

1267
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:37,225
I was helping Grandpa Jack
because he's old.

1268
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:40,797
Well, why did
he scream so loud?

1269
00:53:41,565 --> 00:53:44,830
He wasn't screaming.
He was celebrating,
he was just so happy.

1270
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:50,204
He was, like, "Oh, Focker.
Thanks for helping me
make a wee-wee."

1271
00:53:50,807 --> 00:53:52,968
He just...
He was so happy.
Right, right?

1272
00:53:53,043 --> 00:53:54,203
Right, Greg.

1273
00:53:54,278 --> 00:53:55,939
Yeah.
JACK: Understand?

1274
00:53:56,246 --> 00:53:57,713
I think so.
GREG: Good.

1275
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:04,847
Don't think this incident
is distracting me, Focker.

1276
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:07,720
I know
you're up to something
and I'm watching you.

1277
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:11,586
Well, guess what?
I have eyes, too.

1278
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:16,258
So, I'll be watching you,
watching me.

1279
00:54:16,967 --> 00:54:18,264
Okay.
All right?

1280
00:54:18,335 --> 00:54:19,563
Fair enough.
Good.

1281
00:54:19,636 --> 00:54:21,069
So we just watch
each other, all right?

1282
00:54:21,138 --> 00:54:22,503
Okay, okay.

1283
00:54:29,813 --> 00:54:31,007
I'm watching you right now.

How can I help you?

Hello, yes, do you still
have the pineapple
upside-down cake?

1287
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:54,134
Yes, we do.
Would you like chocolate
or vanilla frosting?

Neither. I'm only
interested in merengue.

1294
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:14,215
Santa, your clearances
haven't been active
for 12 years.

1295
00:55:14,891 --> 00:55:16,552
Now, you listen to me,
Young Turk.

1296
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:18,288
I was bugging
Ho Chi Minh's sock drawer

1297
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:19,657
while you were
still in diapers,

1298
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,391
so don't tell me
about clearances.

1299
00:55:21,465 --> 00:55:23,126
Sir, my hands are tied.

1300
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,794
But, I mean,
you could probably
just google the subject

1301
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:28,235
and find out everything
you need to know.

1302
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:29,628
Oh.

1303
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,174
Then I'll do that.
Santa out.

1304
00:55:41,752 --> 00:55:42,741
Hmm.

1305
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:04,869
Oh, honey, I can't wait
to see Kevin's timeshare
later today, huh?

1306
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:07,672
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1307
00:56:07,744 --> 00:56:08,870
What you doing?

1308
00:56:09,546 --> 00:56:11,013
Oh, just checking
the weather.

1309
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:12,446
There's a cold front
coming in.

1310
00:56:12,516 --> 00:56:13,608
Oh, no.

1311

00:56:21,692 --> 00:56:22,886
Thanks.

00:56:24,861 --> 00:56:25,885
DINA: Greg.

1314
00:56:26,563 --> 00:56:28,030
Hey, how you doing?
Sorry, I'm late.

1315
00:56:28,098 --> 00:56:29,224
Hi, honey.

1316
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:32,061
A little emergency
at the hospital.

1317
00:56:32,135 --> 00:56:34,467
Kevin was showing us
his magnificent estate.

1318
00:56:34,538 --> 00:56:35,596
GREG: It's really nice.

1319
00:56:35,672 --> 00:56:36,696
So this is where
you rough it

1320
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:38,035
when you're not at
the homeless shelter?

1321
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:40,770
Kind of split time
between the two.
Maybe 60l40 here.

1322
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:42,812
Really?
Now that Greg's
finally arrived,

1323
00:56:42,879 --> 00:56:44,744
why don't I take you over
to see the meadow?

1324
00:56:54,524 --> 00:56:55,548
JACK: Yeah, this is perfect.

1325
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:57,217
Oh, this is impressive.
GREG: Wow, nice backyard.

1326
00:56:57,327 --> 00:56:58,692
JACK: Yeah, love it.
PAM: Wow, it is.

1327
00:56:58,762 --> 00:56:59,820
Thank you.

1328
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:01,522
JACK: Let's reserve that
quadrant over there, Kevin.

1329
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:03,122
It's perfect for
the three-legged race,

1330
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,531
egg toss,
capture-the-flag game.

1331
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:08,537
Why don't we put up
a ring of bouncy castles
right out there

1332
00:57:08,605 --> 00:57:10,505
and we have, like,
a relay race for the kids

1333
00:57:10,574 --> 00:57:12,906
kind of intertwined
in between them.

1334
00:57:12,976 --> 00:57:14,068
Loving it, Kev-O.

1335
00:57:14,144 --> 00:57:16,169
Kevin, is that
a tattoo on your back?

1336
00:57:16,246 --> 00:57:17,406
Oh, yes, it is, Dina.

1337
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:19,676
It looks really elaborate.
Could we take a look at it?

1338
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,047
Oh, sure.

Is that Pam?

00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:33,794
Yeah, it is.

1346
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:35,593
You know,
after the whole
Svetlana episode,

1347
00:57:35,665 --> 00:57:37,860
I went on a little bit of
a drunken bender

1348
00:57:37,934 --> 00:57:40,926
and wound up in
a tattoo shop in Moscow.

1349
00:57:41,004 --> 00:57:42,801
And I asked
the artist to ink me

1350
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:44,272
with the image
of the one woman

1351
00:57:44,341 --> 00:57:47,037
who's always loved me
unconditionally.

1352
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,873
Pam.
My grandmother.

1353
00:57:49,412 --> 00:57:51,471
The point being,
in my drunken stupor,

1354
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:53,948
I must have handed him
a photo of Pam instead.

1355
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:56,185
You carry a picture
of Pam in your wallet.

1356
00:57:56,253 --> 00:57:58,380
I do. I carry pictures
of many treasured friends

1357
00:57:58,455 --> 00:57:59,683
and loved ones
on my travels.

1358
00:58:00,624 --> 00:58:01,852
Got a picture of me?

1359
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:03,950
Of course I got
a picture of you.

1360
00:58:04,027 --> 00:58:06,154
You recognize this
mensch right here?

1361
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:08,455
Ah. There I am. Kind of.
There you are, yeah.

That's...
Interesting.

of you, Pam-cake.

So great you two
could join us.

1374
00:58:33,023 --> 00:58:35,958
Really wonderful
when grandparents
play an integral role

1375
00:58:36,026 --> 00:58:37,926
in early humans' lives.
We love them.

1376

Early humans
do need guidance.

1377
00:58:40,263 --> 00:58:42,959
Is that your role, Jack?
To guide them?

1378
00:58:43,033 --> 00:58:45,160
Yes, I see myself
as something of a shepherd,

1379
00:58:45,235 --> 00:58:47,965
guiding our family
through life's pastures.

1380
00:58:48,038 --> 00:58:51,371
Yes, I would say
Jack is sort of
an honorary shepherd.

1381
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:54,569
Kind of a shepherd
emeritus, if you will.

1382
00:58:54,945 --> 00:58:59,109
Well, when my sheep wander,
I use my prod to keep
my flock in line.

1383
00:59:00,617 --> 00:59:04,417
Oh, there are a lot
of family dynamics
at play here.

1384

Why don't we begin
the interview process?

1385
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:11,992
Okay, Henry,
I just want you
to clear your mind

1386
00:59:12,395 --> 00:59:16,593
and draw a picture for me
of the first thing
that comes to mind

1387
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:19,567
when you hear
the word "family."

1388

at the eye doctor.

00:59:23,807 --> 00:59:25,741
Start at the top
and work your way down.

1391
00:59:25,909 --> 00:59:27,638
Why would she
give her an eye test?

1392
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:29,872
It's called
a Heisenreich Experiment.

1393
00:59:29,946 --> 00:59:31,538
We used it
at the agency to test

1394
00:59:31,615 --> 00:59:33,310
the aptitude of
potential recruits.

1395
00:59:34,818 --> 00:59:37,719
All the letters are the same,
so it's not really
an eye test.

1396
00:59:39,222 --> 00:59:41,452
Very impressive
cognition, Samantha.

1397
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:44,124
E... E...

1398
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:48,526
E? I need to start over.

1399
00:59:48,899 --> 00:59:49,888
(SIGHS)

1400
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,431
Okay, Henry,
let's see what
you've chosen to draw.

1401
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:54,492
(GASPS)

1402
00:59:54,905 --> 00:59:56,065
What is it?
What did he draw?

1403
00:59:58,608 --> 01:00:02,772
Dad stuck Grandpa Jack
in the wee-wee last night.
Because he's old.

1404
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:04,670
I'm sorry?
What did he say?

1405
01:00:04,748 --> 01:00:06,045
I didn't hear him.

1406
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,350
Something about
Grandpa Jack having a cold.

1407
01:00:08,718 --> 01:00:10,686
So tell me about
your parents, Samantha.

1408
01:00:11,254 --> 01:00:13,518
Tell me about
your parents, Prudence.

1409
01:00:17,294 --> 01:00:18,352
That's my girl.

1410
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:20,389
Wanna tell me
about your family?

1411
01:00:20,463 --> 01:00:21,760
My dad is a great guy.

1412
01:00:22,032 --> 01:00:23,056
Thank you, buddy.

1413
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,094
But Grandpa Jack makes him
really, really scared.

1414
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,104
So he acts all crazy
when he's with him.

1415
01:00:29,172 --> 01:00:32,266
Like he tried
to cut the turkey
with Grandpa's big knife

1416
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:37,245
and he slipped
and he cut his finger.
And he was like, "Oh, shit!"

1417
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:41,010
Oh, he's blowing
the interview.

1418
01:00:41,084 --> 01:00:43,382
She's setting him up to fail
with these questions.

1419
01:00:43,453 --> 01:00:45,717
I mean,
Sam's a better tester,
anyway, so...

1420
01:00:45,789 --> 01:00:47,450
Well, that's because
she takes after...

1421
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:48,889
Takes after who, Jack?

1422
01:00:48,959 --> 01:00:51,291
Let's just say
I've done some
research on twins.

1423
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:52,851
There's a theory that
in certain cases,

1424
01:00:52,929 --> 01:00:55,489
one twin gets
an extra chromosome
from the father,

1425
01:00:55,565 --> 01:00:57,533
while the other sibling
gets an extra chromosome

1426
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,726
from the mother's side.

1427
01:00:58,802 --> 01:00:59,826
Hmm.

1428
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,038
Sam might be
three quarters Byrnes,

1429
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:03,572
whereas Henry
could very well have

1430
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,471
a double dose
of Focker in him.

1431
01:01:06,843 --> 01:01:08,276
And what if he does?

1432
01:01:08,778 --> 01:01:10,939
My Grandpa Bernie
taught me this.
Pull my finger.

1433
01:01:11,348 --> 01:01:12,337
Oh.

1434
01:01:12,716 --> 01:01:13,705
(MIMICS FARTING)

1435
01:01:15,819 --> 01:01:16,843
Double dose.

1436
01:01:17,253 --> 01:01:18,311
(LAUGHING)

1437
01:01:19,422 --> 01:01:22,152
Let's go out to the courtyard
for some free play.

1438
01:01:23,426 --> 01:01:25,860
I mean, what is
"free-play test"?

1439
01:01:25,929 --> 01:01:27,260
How well they hang
on the monkey bars?

1440
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:28,422
I don't think
you get it, Greg.

1441
01:01:28,965 --> 01:01:30,330
You know when
prison guards
learn the most

1442
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,766
about their inmate
population?

1443
01:01:32,836 --> 01:01:34,098
During rec time
in the yard.

1444
01:01:34,537 --> 01:01:36,232
I'm sure Prudence is
in her office right now

1445
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:37,933
watching every move
these kids make.

1446
01:01:39,609 --> 01:01:40,667
Dad?
Yeah.

1447
01:01:40,744 --> 01:01:42,803
Can I please go climb
that big rock wall?

1448
01:01:42,879 --> 01:01:44,346
Yeah, okay.
Just be careful,
buddy, all right?

1449
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:45,813
All right.

1450
01:01:45,882 --> 01:01:47,349
Do you think
he can handle that?

1451
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:48,714
What's the big deal?

1452
01:01:48,785 --> 01:01:51,253
I'm just not sure
you've instilled
the physical confidence

1453
01:01:51,321 --> 01:01:52,845
for him to shear
a face like that.

1454
01:01:53,289 --> 01:01:56,816
Jack, do me a favor.
Just let go of the reins
a little, okay?

1455
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,888
I'll let go, Greg,
when you show me,
once and for all,

1456
01:01:59,963 --> 01:02:01,430
that you have
what it takes to lead.

1457
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:04,159
I am in control
of my family, all right?

1458
01:02:04,234 --> 01:02:06,998
If I give Henry permission
to climb a wall,
he can climb a wall.

1459
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,265
If he says
he wants to climb
the Empire State Building

1460
01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:10,499
and I say it's okay,

1461
01:02:10,573 --> 01:02:12,131
it's okay,
because I'm in charge.

1462
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:14,267
All right?
I'm calling the plays now.

1463
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:17,643
So you just got to step back
and accept the fact
that I have got this.

1464
01:02:17,714 --> 01:02:18,703
HENRY: Whoa!

1465
01:02:18,782 --> 01:02:19,771
(THUDDING)

1466
01:02:20,884 --> 01:02:23,614
Oh, he is such
a brave boy, isn't he?

1467
01:02:23,686 --> 01:02:26,177
See, it's not so bad.
It's just a slight fracture.

1468
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:27,620
Okay, thanks.

1469
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,679
Hey, Henry,
are you doing all right?

1470
01:02:30,894 --> 01:02:32,862
Hey, I came
as soon as I heard.

1471
01:02:32,929 --> 01:02:36,057
Prudence told me
there was a little bit of
a kerfuffle over at E.H.S.

1472
01:02:36,132 --> 01:02:38,100
Oh, that's an understatement.
Thanks to Greg,

1473
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:40,466
we can wave goodbye
to their educational future.

1474
01:02:40,537 --> 01:02:41,595
DINA: Jack.

1475
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:42,933
KEVIN: Oh, no, no.
Pru's a forgiving soul.

1476
01:02:43,006 --> 01:02:45,270
I think I can
patch things up.
In the meantime,

1477
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:47,775
I got a little something
for Hank the Tank here.

1478
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:51,180
Someone to
keep you company until
you're reunited with Arthur.

1479
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:53,812
What is that?
Thanks, Papa Kev.

1480
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,478
Papa Kev?

1481
01:02:55,552 --> 01:02:56,712
Yeah, old fraternity nickname.

1482
01:02:56,786 --> 01:03:00,222
I told Hank the Tank here
he could call me
by that handle.

1483
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:02,952
You're not Hank the Tank.
Nobody calls him
Hank the Tank.

1484
01:03:03,326 --> 01:03:04,350
You wanna be Papa Greg?

1485
01:03:04,427 --> 01:03:07,487
No, I am Papa... I'm Greg.
I'm Greg, his papa.

1486
01:03:07,564 --> 01:03:08,656
So I don't need
to be Papa Greg.

1487
01:03:08,731 --> 01:03:10,392
I don't need to
put a little thing
in front of it.

1488
01:03:10,467 --> 01:03:11,559
WOMAN ON PA:
Paging Nurse Focker.

1489
01:03:11,634 --> 01:03:13,261
Pam, we need to talk
for a minute.

1490
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:14,728
Oh, okay. Mom?

1491
01:03:17,674 --> 01:03:19,141
Hey, Louis, what's up?

1492
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:21,370
What up, dawg?
Hey, hottie at 2:00.

1493
01:03:21,444 --> 01:03:22,570
There's the superstar!

1494
01:03:22,645 --> 01:03:23,703
Hey, hi, hi.

1495
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,145
Hey!
Oh. Hello.

1496
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:27,749
I have the raddest
news ever!

1497
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:29,216
Really? Okay.

1498
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:32,110
So our VP of marketing
heard how well you did

1499
01:03:32,188 --> 01:03:34,156
on your speech last night
and guess what?

1500
01:03:34,257 --> 01:03:35,281
What?

1501
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:39,294
He wants us to lead
the Pfosten convention
in Maui next month.

1502
01:03:39,496 --> 01:03:41,589
Yeah, that sounds great.
Honestly, I'm sorry.

1503
01:03:41,664 --> 01:03:42,858
I'm just a little
distracted right now

1504
01:03:42,932 --> 01:03:44,092
'cause my son just
broke his arm and...

1505
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:45,259
Oh, poor baby.

1506
01:03:45,335 --> 01:03:46,461
Yeah, so...

1507
01:03:46,536 --> 01:03:47,628
You're a super dad.

1508
01:03:47,704 --> 01:03:50,673
No, I'm not a super dad.
It is so cute

1509
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,038
how involved you are
with your kids.

1510
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:56,374
No, no, no,
that's just what dads do.
It's not like a super...

1511
01:03:56,446 --> 01:03:58,380
Louis! What are you doing?
Is this the book?

1512
01:03:58,448 --> 01:03:59,915
What is...
No, go. Come on.

1513
01:03:59,983 --> 01:04:01,951
In the back, right?
I got them.

1514
01:04:02,852 --> 01:04:04,183
Sorry, it's just...

1515
01:04:04,254 --> 01:04:05,516
Somebody's grumpy.

1516
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:07,684
I'm gonna make this
brief, Pam-cake.

1517
01:04:07,757 --> 01:04:08,951
I'm not getting
any younger.

1518
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:10,515
Dad.
No, I want to make sure

1519
01:04:10,593 --> 01:04:13,528
there's someone around
besides me who you can
fully count on.

1520
01:04:13,596 --> 01:04:15,393
I couldn't help but notice
how you and Kevin

1521
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:17,558
have reconnected
these past few days.

1522
01:04:17,634 --> 01:04:20,068
He's financially secure.
He's great with the twins.

1523
01:04:20,136 --> 01:04:21,160
Got a heart of gold.

1524
01:04:21,571 --> 01:04:23,129
He's a little goofy,
maybe, in his dressing,

1525
01:04:23,206 --> 01:04:24,696
but if that body art
is any indication,

1526
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:26,537
I'd say he's certainly
open to the idea.

1527
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:28,668
What idea?

1528
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:32,512
The idea of a simple
course correction.

1529
01:04:33,516 --> 01:04:35,074
A course correction.

1530
01:04:35,185 --> 01:04:37,210
Greg, Kevin.

1531
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:41,789
Come on, grumpy daddy!
Come to Hawaii.

1532
01:04:41,858 --> 01:04:43,052
(LAUGHING) Okay.

1533
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:44,753
Okay, grumpy daddy
will think about it.

1534
01:04:44,827 --> 01:04:46,021
Yes!
Okay, okay.

1535
01:04:46,095 --> 01:04:48,120
Oh! Hey, honey, hi!

1536
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:52,592
Perfect. Pam, this is Andi.
Andi, this is Pam, my wife.

1537
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:54,093
Hey.

1538
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,263
Hi, it's a...
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

1539
01:04:56,339 --> 01:04:57,966
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

1540
01:04:58,041 --> 01:04:59,872
Your husband
is a freaking rock star,

1541
01:04:59,943 --> 01:05:02,343
but I'm sure you know
how lucky you are.

1542
01:05:02,412 --> 01:05:04,312
Yeah.
I'm not.
She's the rock star.

1543
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,941
She's a rock star mom
and just full-on,
rocking person.

1544
01:05:08,184 --> 01:05:09,208
Oh.

1545
01:05:09,285 --> 01:05:10,684
And I'm just a groupie

1546
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:14,453
trying to, you know,
carry her amps.

1547
01:05:14,691 --> 01:05:17,023
No, you're... You're...
You're the man.

1548
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,194
Everything
all right here?

1549
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:21,189
Yeah, Jack,
everything's all right.

1550
01:05:21,264 --> 01:05:23,459
Pam, do you wanna...
Oh, my God.

1551
01:05:23,533 --> 01:05:26,764
You must be
the famous Jack Byrnes.

1552
01:05:26,836 --> 01:05:29,634
Wow. I have heard
so much about you.

1553
01:05:30,473 --> 01:05:32,737
I've heard very little
about you, Miss Garcia.

1554
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:35,073
But I do admire
your cheerleading
photographs.

1555
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:36,911
Henry's doing much better.

1556
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:39,107
We were just singing
an ancient Yanomamo song

1557
01:05:39,182 --> 01:05:41,173
about a brave warrior
who falls from a tree

1558
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:43,549
while hunting
for chimpanzee meat.

1559
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,611
He's good. Yeah.

1560
01:05:46,089 --> 01:05:47,579
Hi.
Hi.

1561
01:05:47,657 --> 01:05:50,125
Andi Garcia.
Pfosten Pharmaceuticals.

1562
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:52,294
And you're Doctor...

1563
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:53,727
No. He's not a doctor.

1564
01:05:53,796 --> 01:05:55,627
Not in the Western
sense of the word.

1565
01:05:55,898 --> 01:05:58,162
Not in any sense of the word.
You're an investment banker.

1566
01:05:58,968 --> 01:06:00,299
Many hats. Kevin.

1567
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:01,359
Hi.

1568
01:06:02,872 --> 01:06:03,998
Okay, cool.

1569
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:05,700
Well, I'm gonna
mosey on out of here.

1570
01:06:06,976 --> 01:06:08,000
All right.

1571
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:09,066
(SPEAKS HAWAIIAN)

1572
01:06:11,214 --> 01:06:13,011
Wow, you told me she sold
boner medicine, Greg.

1573
01:06:13,082 --> 01:06:14,174
You didn't tell me
she is boner medicine.

1574
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,342
Pam, that's ridiculous.

1575
01:06:15,418 --> 01:06:17,648
You also said
you wouldn't pick her out
of a lineup, too.

1576
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,187
Wouldn't pick her
out of a lineup?

1577
01:06:19,255 --> 01:06:20,586
Greg, that woman
is stunning!

1578
01:06:20,657 --> 01:06:22,056
Oh, he's covering, Kevin,

1579
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:24,093
'cause he didn't want
Pam to get suspicious.

1580
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,821
Dad.
Did you see the way
his carotid artery

1581
01:06:25,895 --> 01:06:27,192
throbbed when
he looked at her?

1582
01:06:27,263 --> 01:06:28,890
Dad.
Give me a break, Jack.
Come on.

1583
01:06:28,965 --> 01:06:30,330
Now this is what
I'm talking about, Pam.

1584
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,368
I'm sorry,
but this man
cannot be trusted.

1585
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:34,801
Could you
for once in your life
stay out of my marriage?

1586
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:36,498
Greg, come on,
don't get hysterical.

1587
01:06:36,572 --> 01:06:38,472
I'm not getting hysterical.
He's getting hysterical.

1588
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:40,475
Look, it's natural
to get a little tempted.

1589
01:06:40,543 --> 01:06:41,567
Nobody's tempted, nobody's...

1590
01:06:41,644 --> 01:06:42,906
Look, even our dear friend,
the Buddha,

1591
01:06:42,979 --> 01:06:44,173
had to pass through
some sorrow

1592
01:06:44,247 --> 01:06:45,578
on his way to enlightenment.

1593
01:06:45,648 --> 01:06:47,275
Our dear friend,
the Buddha?

1594
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:48,977
How's he doing?
It's been so long.

1595
01:06:49,452 --> 01:06:50,612
Do you ever
listen to yourself?

1596
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:51,813
I try not to.

1597
01:06:51,888 --> 01:06:54,118
I speak from the heart,
off the cuff,
like my man, JC,

1598
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,418
at the Sermon on the Mount.

1599
01:06:55,491 --> 01:06:57,482
I think that's what
you've always
admired about me.

1600
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,653
Well, I got news for you.
You're not Jesus.

1601
01:06:59,729 --> 01:07:01,390
Well, he may not be Jesus,

1602
01:07:01,464 --> 01:07:02,988
but he's a far better
choice for Pam
than you are, Greg.

1603
01:07:03,066 --> 01:07:04,226
Dad!

1604
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,358
I'm sorry.
Would you stop

1605
01:07:05,435 --> 01:07:07,027
with the
course-correction stuff?
No, that's right...

1606
01:07:07,103 --> 01:07:08,468
What's the
course-correction stuff?
It's nothing.

1607
01:07:08,538 --> 01:07:09,800
I want to hear
all about it, Jack.

1608
01:07:09,872 --> 01:07:13,273
You're leading this family
onto rocky shoals, Focker,

1609
01:07:13,343 --> 01:07:14,605
and as captain
of the ship,

1610
01:07:14,677 --> 01:07:15,974
I'm steering us away
to safety.

1611
01:07:16,045 --> 01:07:18,138
Well, you know what?
You're not a ship's
captain, Jack.

1612
01:07:18,214 --> 01:07:20,774
We're people.
We're not on a boat,
we're in a hospital. Okay?

1613
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:23,717
We're human beings
in a hospital
and you're not the captain.

1614
01:07:23,786 --> 01:07:26,346
Well, I may not be
the captain,
Gregory Focker,

1615
01:07:26,422 --> 01:07:28,151
but you're not
the Godfocker!

1616
01:07:29,592 --> 01:07:32,425
Good. 'Cause
I don't want to be
the stupid Godfocker.

1617
01:07:33,229 --> 01:07:36,790
I'm the Greg Focker, Jack!
All right? I am Greg Focker!

1618
01:07:36,866 --> 01:07:39,357
And by the way,
Dr. Bob told me you offered
him the job first.

1619
01:07:39,435 --> 01:07:40,868
Nice to know I was
your sloppy seconds.

1620
01:07:40,937 --> 01:07:42,336
You spoke to Dr. Bob?

1621
01:07:42,405 --> 01:07:44,032
Yeah, I did, Jack.

1622
01:07:44,107 --> 01:07:45,267
Had beers with him
last night.

1623
01:07:45,341 --> 01:07:46,330
He's in town
for a convention.

1624
01:07:46,409 --> 01:07:47,967
That's it. You're done.

1625
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:49,375
You're done,
it's over, that's it.
You know what?

1626
01:07:49,445 --> 01:07:51,003
You can't tell me I'm done
because I already quit.

1627
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,377
You're done.
I'm getting off the wheel.

1628
01:07:52,448 --> 01:07:53,472
What wheel?
The wheel!

1629
01:07:53,549 --> 01:07:55,380
The little hamster wheel
that we're all running up

1630
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:57,783
to get a little taste
of your little water thingy!

1631
01:07:57,854 --> 01:07:58,912
Just, please,
approval! Approval!

1632
01:07:58,988 --> 01:08:00,012
What the hell
are you doing?

1633
01:08:00,089 --> 01:08:01,647
Please! Give me some
of the Jack... Yeah.

1634
01:08:01,724 --> 01:08:03,248
It's like a metaphor
for your approval...

1635
01:08:03,326 --> 01:08:04,725
Thank you for
clearing that up!

1636
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:06,352
What are you even
doing here, Kevin?

1637
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:07,862
I'm trying to help.
Why don't you get on

1638
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:09,090
your stupid monster yacht

1639
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:10,689
with your bubble-butt
Russian girlfriend

1640
01:08:10,767 --> 01:08:13,759
and do Jell-O shots
off of Deepak Chopra's butt?

1641
01:08:13,836 --> 01:08:16,202
Greg, don't drag Deepak
into this. Please, Greg.

1642
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:21,174
Hey, Dina. Jack had
a heart attack two weeks ago.
Adios, folks!

1643
01:08:28,785 --> 01:08:29,809
AUTOMATED VOICE: Going down.

1644
01:08:29,886 --> 01:08:30,875
Hey.

1645
01:08:31,654 --> 01:08:32,951
Hey.
You okay?

1646
01:08:34,624 --> 01:08:36,319
Yeah.

1647
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:37,416
Need a ride?

1648
01:08:39,595 --> 01:08:41,859
(ON ANSWERING MACHINE)
Hey, it's Pam.
Leave me a message.

1649
01:08:41,931 --> 01:08:43,262
GREG: Hey, I'm gonna
sleep over

1650
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:44,856
at the new house tonight,
all right?

1651
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:47,129
I just can't deal
with your dad right now.

1652
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,907
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

1653
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:55,341
Yeah, I think I just
need to clear my head.
Thanks for the ride.

1654
01:08:55,411 --> 01:08:56,435
No problem.

1655
01:09:00,383 --> 01:09:03,011
Why am I the bad guy here?
Greg was the one
who was being dishonest.

1656
01:09:03,085 --> 01:09:06,521
Oh, please. All Greg
did was downplay
that woman's looks,

1657
01:09:06,589 --> 01:09:08,955
so Pam wouldn't be jealous,
and you know it.

1658
01:09:09,025 --> 01:09:10,253
You know you did
the same thing

1659
01:09:10,326 --> 01:09:12,590
with that gorgeous
double agent in Helsinki

1660
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:13,754
during the Cold War.

1661
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:16,094
Oh, you're still bringing up
Aatukka Kokkonen.

1662
01:09:16,165 --> 01:09:18,599
I told you her beauty
was privileged information.

1663
01:09:18,668 --> 01:09:20,329
It was a matter of
national security.

1664
01:09:20,403 --> 01:09:22,769
Oh, yes.
Like your heart condition?

1665
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:23,931
Listen, Jack.

1666
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:26,868
Greg cares about his family

1667
01:09:26,943 --> 01:09:30,037
just as much as you care
about yours. All right?

1668
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:40,010
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1669
01:09:40,289 --> 01:09:41,347
Pam?

1670
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:51,723
Don't be mad. I totally
don't want to harass you.

1671
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:54,964
You just seemed so sad,
I had to bring you
some treats.

1672
01:09:55,705 --> 01:09:57,696
Oh. Wow, thanks.

1673
01:09:58,307 --> 01:10:01,333
Some Chinese food.
Little wine.

1674
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:04,902
No offense,

1675
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:06,949
but does Pam
even realize
how dope you are?

1676
01:10:07,016 --> 01:10:10,213
Oh, yeah, no.
I think she thinks I'm dope.

1677
01:10:10,286 --> 01:10:11,344
It's just, you know,

1678
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:13,885
it just changes
when you have kids,

1679
01:10:13,956 --> 01:10:15,856
you know, because
everything becomes
focused around them.

1680
01:10:15,925 --> 01:10:17,517
Totally. And I'm sure
you're like,

1681
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:19,754
"Hello! Can I have
some fun, too?"

1682
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:23,565
Yeah, no. I mean,
it's fun, but it's just
a different kind of fun.

1683
01:10:23,633 --> 01:10:24,691
More wine.

1684
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,201
It's not like
old single fun,
where you go out.

1685
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:31,070
It's more like wake up
in the morning at 6:00,
make the kids breakfast.

1686
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:32,835
You know, that kind of fun.

1687
01:10:32,909 --> 01:10:34,570
I love it. I mean,
they're so cute.

1688
01:10:34,644 --> 01:10:36,236
Like, the other day,
Henry came in

1689
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:38,780
and he had his little

he wanted to be the mayor.

1693
01:10:44,353 --> 01:10:45,980
And then he came in
and he said,

"And here is a proclamation.
You cannot use
the 'frigerator."

a picture of it.

My two cents.
The way to deal with Jack,

1851
01:18:34,456 --> 01:18:37,152
no matter what he does,
just smother
that guy with kisses.

in your hands.

Okay.

this leg down slowly?

about what happened.

I'm sorry, too.
