DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR

3
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,186
Heheheh! Hey!

4
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:39,823
Monseigneur, Grandee.

5
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,349
Buenas tardes, amigos!

6
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:45,427
The taxes are there, Minister.

7
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:04,013
The salt, land and spice taxes...
how much, this year?

8
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:06,060
200,000 ducats.

9
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:10,810
-Last year it was more!
-The harvest was very good.

10
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:14,918
This year's was very bad.
So you must pay double!

11
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:23,865
All these taxes are for the king!

12
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,191
Don Salluste, our people
are terribly poor.

13
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:29,146
That's normal.

14
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,767
The poor were meant to be poor
and the rich to be rich.

15
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,355
Come on, come on...☻

16
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:41,261
Hurry up!

17
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:43,786
I have 3 more villages to visit.

18
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:47,934
Gather that up... hurry!

19
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:57,896
Where's the cheering?☻

20
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,636
The enthusiasm?

21
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:02,924
Viva Don Salluste.

22
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:05,660
Viva Don Salluste.

23
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:08,095
Viva our benefactor!

24
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:10,928
Viva our benefactor!

25
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:15,760
- Our friend!
- Viva our friend.

26
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:17,459
- Olé!
- Olé.

27
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:19,373
- Olé!
- Olé.

28
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,607
Not quite. It'll have to do!

29
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:37,607
The coach looks solid,
but it isn't.

30
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:38,808
Hey?

31
00:05:39,531 --> 00:05:43,977
The coach looks solid, but it's not.
Leaks like a sieve!

32
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,445
Stuff just falls out.
<i>Blaze!</i>

33
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:48,453
So, if I were you, I'd...

34
00:05:51,065 --> 00:05:54,357
Follow the coach!

35
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,466
All this, for the King.

36
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,157
That's for me.

37
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:24,580
That... is for me.

38
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:28,106
That's for me.

39
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:31,210
That's for me.

40
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:40,052
Hey, careful!

41
00:06:43,323 --> 00:06:45,779
Hey! Ho! Easy!

42
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:18,997
The spice tax is for...?

43
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:21,763
Salluste? -yes!
(No for the King!)

44
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,513
Oh, leave me alone!

45
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:28,357
Is the land tax for the King?

46
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:29,872
No, it's for Salluste!

47
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,122
(Thief!) - No, not at all!
It's for Salluste, that's that!

48
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,092
Look out!

49
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,673
Hold on, sir.

50
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,338
I'll help you.

51
00:07:57,947 --> 00:08:01,361
Ay-ay-ay! My ruff!

52
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,232
I'll help you, Monseigneur.

53
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,052
No!

54
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:07,226
That's my gold!
And my gold is MY gold!

55
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:10,013
And I don't need you!

56
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:13,216
- You sure?
- Ah!

57
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,534
What's happening?

58
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,002
The villagers,
are cheering for you.

59
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,399
-Cheering for me?
- Yes.

61
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:34,755
I should've tripled the take.

62
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:51,802
Ahh!

63
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:54,888
Death to him!

64
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:14,361
Blaze!

65
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:16,138
Blaze!

66
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,700
Blaze!

67
00:09:20,164 --> 00:09:21,491
Help!

68
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:24,404
Aah! Blaze!

69
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,539
Help.

70
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:31,968
Help.

71
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:33,718
Help.

72
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,118
Stop.

73
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:37,179
Stop.

74
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:38,689
Stop, will you!

75
00:09:43,571 --> 00:09:46,106
Wait! Help!

76
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:49,561
Why'd you get off?

77
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,069
My good Blaze! Here!

78
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,501
My hand! Help, my good Blaze!

79
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,356
Hold tight, my dear Blaze.

80
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,426
Ah! Ah!

81
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:06,091
Don't let me go!
Such a good Blaze!

82
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:08,091
Thank you, my dear Blaze.

83
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:12,029
They weren't cheering me.
Not cheering at all!

84
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,195
Take that! And that!

85
00:10:14,524 --> 00:10:15,637
And that!

86
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:19,308
They weren't cheering!
They weren't cheering me!

87
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:26,170
Those crooks!

88
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:28,341
See that?
They almost had me!

89
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,326
Oh, yes Sir!

90
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:32,365
That's "The People" for you!

91
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:34,654
Not there!

92
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,896
Not there!

93
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:40,068
There!

94
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:42,521
Not enough lather.

95
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:44,560
Not enough hair either.

96
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:06,767
Ay! Ayay, ay!

97
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,837
Don't move.

98
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:14,228
Ay!

99
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,182
Ay! Ay! Ay!

100
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:39,122
Ay! Ay! Ay!

101
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:51,091
Voilà!

102
00:11:57,068 --> 00:12:00,942
Now, Blaze... flatter me.

103
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:06,169
Monseigneur is the grandest
of all the Spanish Grandees.

104
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:09,318
That's no flattery,
it's just true... Well?

105
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:10,410
Imbecile.

106
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,216
What?

107
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:14,208
"Imbecile" I said to the Duke's valet.

108
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:18,260
"My master is not the issue
of an inbred marriage"

109
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,583
"Take a good look", he said.

110
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:22,794
"Don't go by appearences", I said.

111
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:26,102
"Just because his mother
married his aunt's half brother

112
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:29,462
"who was his father's first cousin"

113
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:33,556
Are you sure that's flattery?

114
00:12:34,743 --> 00:12:37,107
I thought of something else
but I don't dare.

115
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:39,786
Go on, dare!

116
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,458
Go on!

117
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:46,098
Monseigneur is... handsome.

118
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,638
Do you actually believe
what you said?

119
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:02,615
Well, I'm flattering you.

120
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:06,615
Good night, Your Majesty.

121
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,990
<i>Was ist das?</i>

122
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,236
The Queen!

123
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:01,880

126
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,638
The Queen has a knave!

127
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:22,860
That could be worth a fortune!

128
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:27,404
It's Blaze!

129
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:03,771
There's the old bat.

130
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:05,904
Things are heating up!

131
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:08,794
A Queen of Spain receives
flowers from no one.

132
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:10,520
Not even from the King!

133
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:31,049
Whew!

134
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,330

You, up there, Blaze!

You'll wake the whole palace!

That's the Queen, she's Bavarian.

What a lovey song!

00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:06,644
My young German heart in exile,
trembles at this melody.

145
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:07,762
Majesty.

146
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,562
A Queen of Spain does not
listen to songs...

147
00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:15,320
when the King is out hunting.

148
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:21,343
Hunters, weepers.
Lovers, keepers.

149

Olé!

150
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:30,224
Because I love the Queen.

Me, a valet, "I dare"!

Just you wait, I'll show you!

Blaze, my valet, lover of the Queen!

155
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,615
The fool will get himself
drawn and quartered!

C'mere, you!

157

He sings, he taps!

00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:21,377
He stomps! Hey!

160
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:28,991
Knock off the noise "Romeo"
it's 2 in the morning!

161
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:33,402
Hey!

00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,079
Golden sunrays.

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,255
Wake up and smell the gold.

00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:15,029
Kitchi, kitchi, kootchi!

173
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:26,203
One's missing!

174
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:27,638
You sure?

175
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:28,810
'Gold' damn sure!

176
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:29,631
I say!

177
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:31,048
Look under the bed.

178
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:34,045
There!

179
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:37,205
There it is!

180
00:20:43,753 --> 00:20:46,349
Look! Look at this!

181
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,107
- What?
-You're too tall!

182
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,849
You're my valet, c'mon!

183
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,444
I sould be able to see that!
That's better.

184
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:18,852
Give me my breadsticks.

185
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,443
Monseigneur is in a good mood!

186
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,038
No, I'm not! And you know why!

187
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:33,263
Why?

188
00:21:33,318 --> 00:21:36,130
'Cause last night, bom bom bom
tagada tagada!

189
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:38,091
Gling gling gling,
tarata taratata!

190
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,060
Digading digadigadigading

191
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:42,430
Monseisei... Monseisei...

192
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:43,520
Monseigneur!

193
00:21:43,646 --> 00:21:45,052
It's th-the... the...

194
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:46,118
The what?

195
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,388
The Queen!

196
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:50,171
The Queen here, at this hour?

197
00:21:50,195 --> 00:21:52,638
My doublet, my fleece, hurry!

198
00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:56,122
Take that off!

199
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:00,726
Dress me! Dress me!

200
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:06,257
Yes! The Infanta's hand is mine, now.

201
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:08,200
And I'm not letting her go.

202
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:11,083
I didn't know that you
and the Infanta...

203
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,490
My ruff!

204
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:15,633
- There...
- You don't understand...

205
00:22:15,865 --> 00:22:18,833
The Queen's coming to tell me
that I'm to be...

206
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:21,313
the King's SON-IN-LAW!

207
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:24,407
How extraordinary,
since they have no children!

208
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,130
King's NEPHEW, then! Same thing.

209
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:31,529
All I need is for the King to
have a hunting accident... Pow!

210
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:34,072
Then, fat cousin Léopold... Pow!

211
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:36,325
Then, little Duke d'Anjou... Ngh!

212
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:39,904
Lots of hunting accidents.
Pow! Pow! Pow!

213
00:22:40,036 --> 00:22:41,591
And voilà, I'm King!

214
00:22:41,696 --> 00:22:44,216
And we'll avoid the War of
the Spanish Succession.

215
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:45,833
<i>Her Majesty, the Queen!

216
00:22:45,904 --> 00:22:47,365
Quick, tidy up!

217
00:22:51,613 --> 00:22:53,769
Make way for the Queen.

218
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,039
Seid still! (Be still)

219
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:15,294
Ruhe!

220
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:18,203
Ruhe, die Hunde! Ruhe!
(Quiet, dogs)

221
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:27,279
Sie haben meine Ehrendame entehrt.
(You dishonored my Lady in Waiting)

222
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:29,950
Euh... what? Was?

223
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,862
Und die Unschuld eines jungen
deutschen Mädchen missbraucht!

224
00:23:31,862 --> 00:23:34,663
(And abused the innocence
of a young German girl)

225
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:38,178
Ah! Danke schön! (Thank you)

226
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:41,303
Schmall Infanta! Schön! (lovely)

227
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,946
Ich bin happy meine aunt.

228
00:23:43,948 --> 00:23:46,997
Meine auntie! Ach!

229
00:23:52,345 --> 00:23:55,800
Raus, die Zwerge! Los!Raus, schnell!
(Out dwarfs, away! Out quickly)

231
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:57,279
"Raus... Schnell..."

232
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,864
What a lovely tongue!

233
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,950
Sie sind abgesetzt, verbannt
und ausgewiesen.

234
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:08,528
Ihr Vermögen ist beschlagnahmt
zu Gunsten der Krone.

235
00:24:10,113 --> 00:24:11,037
What's she saying?

236
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:15,473
Don Salluste, you are
dismissed, demoted, exiled.

237
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,318
You lose your your title
"Knight of the Golden Fleece",

238
00:24:19,396 --> 00:24:22,333
and your functions as Minister
of Police and of Finance.

239
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:26,763
All your holdings are
confiscated by the crown.

240
00:24:27,654 --> 00:24:29,068
But what did I do?

241
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,966
Ein Kind, Don Salluste!
An infant!

242
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:36,107
Your Majesty.

243
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:43,102
What's this? Who is this?

244
00:24:43,235 --> 00:24:47,313
You revuze to regoknize zis
paby off my Lady in Vaitink?

245
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:49,485
How can I recognize it,
I don't even know it!

246
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:50,610
Ja! Ja! Ja!

247
00:24:50,704 --> 00:24:52,677
Ja ja ja?... Nein!

248
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:56,196
Zeduzed und abandoned, he has!
Verfürt und verlassen.

249
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:57,343
Liar!

250
00:24:57,421 --> 00:25:00,368
She's a liar.
She's lying in German.

251
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:04,446
This child is a false witness.
Warum mich? Ich habe nicht!

252
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:06,828
She and I, nada! Nada! Never!
Nothing!

253
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:10,853
Your Majesty, Das ist eine
kolossal Konspirazion!

254
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,573
Don Salluste,

256
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:24,190
Madame! Wait!

257
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:27,505
Majesty don't be
influenced by a newborn baby.

258
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:31,180
Alright, I recognise this child,
and all my faults, and

259
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:33,579
mine and other people's children.

260
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,344
Your children, if it please you.

261
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,907
- Villain!
- Scoundrel!

262
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,677
Look, he's as green as his gloves. (furious?)

263
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,411
His disgrace serves our purpose.

264
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:44,677
Tomorrow, he'll return
his Golden Fleece to the King.

265
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:47,232
It's an unexpected stroke of luck.

266
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,857
We must act fast.

267
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:52,685
Oh, amigos!

268
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,490
Amigos!

269
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,930
Oh!

270
00:26:10,457 --> 00:26:11,535
Hey!

271
00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:21,676
Not that! That's mine.

272
00:26:26,411 --> 00:26:28,638
No! That's mine too.

273
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,607
No, you can't have my table.

274
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:35,825
Hey you, give us a hand!

275
00:26:35,897 --> 00:26:36,816
Sure.

276
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:39,284
Allez...hop!.

277
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:43,574
My forks!

278
00:27:00,934 --> 00:27:03,136
The Queen said to take away everything.

279
00:27:04,046 --> 00:27:04,872
Everything!

280
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,294
I didn't take anything.

281
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:07,615
Yes, you did.

282
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:18,570
Who put that in my pants?

283
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:20,279
What'll become of me?

284
00:27:20,358 --> 00:27:23,115
I'm a Minister, I don't
know how to do anything!

285
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,693
We can look for a job together, Monseigneur.

286
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:27,188
You, piss off!

287
00:27:27,586 --> 00:27:30,073
Disappear! I never want to see you again.

288
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:33,716
- Who'll pay my wages?
- Your wages? Take that!

289
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:37,388
I dismiss you.

290
00:27:37,476 --> 00:27:39,927
You no longer exist for me.

291
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,058
Let me hav...

292
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,497
If you don't mind!...

293
00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:47,036
- It's my broom.
- Bandit! Con man! Punk!

294
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:54,545
You bitch of a Queen!

295
00:27:54,642 --> 00:27:56,335
Slutten!

296
00:27:56,522 --> 00:27:58,615
I'll get my revenge. Take that!

297
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,232
Hey, One-eye!

298
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,568
- Monseigneur...
- Alright, enough.

299
00:28:13,685 --> 00:28:15,753
- Do you know César?
- The bandit?

300
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:18,916
César the bandit. - Yes.
- You must get ahold of him.

301
00:28:19,218 --> 00:28:22,187
No one's seen him for 10 years,
and me with one eye...

302
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:24,677
You see very well with one eye!

303
00:28:25,814 --> 00:28:28,000
Alright, you don't see that well.
Anyway...

304
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:31,836
once you find the first half
the other half can't be far.

305
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,132
César! Nephew!

306
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,810
Crook! Lout!

307
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:53,425
I'm here!

308
00:28:53,672 --> 00:28:54,868
Scoundrel.

309
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:57,997
It's me. Where are you?

310
00:28:58,297 --> 00:28:59,529
Up here.

311
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,115
Up where?

312
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:02,930
Over here.

313
00:29:03,185 --> 00:29:04,180
Ah! There he is.

314
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,066
I'm coming.

315
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:24,908
So, you old creep...

316
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,308
you crawled out of your hole,
and you need me?

317
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:33,957
I have a proposition for you.

318
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,684
Does it pay well?

319
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,676
A fortune -- mine!

320
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:41,312
Do you take me for an ass?

321
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:45,099
No, not that way.

322
00:29:48,598 --> 00:29:50,779
Not this way. Move along.

327
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:52,632
Ah!

323
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:56,222
Listen to me.

324
00:29:56,633 --> 00:30:00,005
César, the bandit, the crook,
disappears.

325
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:04,568
Forgotten! Paf!
Forget about him. He's gone!

326
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:07,831
And becomes 'Don' César.

327
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,441
I'll tell the court you just
got back from the Americas.

328
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:12,816
And...

329
00:30:14,152 --> 00:30:16,230
...you seduce the Queen.

330
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:19,897
Is it true what they say?
You fell fom Her grace?

331
00:30:20,304 --> 00:30:22,093
You seduce the Queen.

332
00:30:22,345 --> 00:30:24,677
I send an anonymous letter
to the King.

333
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,440
He catches you in the act,
repudiates her...

334
00:30:27,457 --> 00:30:29,950
and puts me back in power.

335
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,774
Can you imagine finding,
anywhere in Spain,...

336
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,817
such an idiot to fall for
such a ploy?

337
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:43,881
An idiot! I had one, but I was
stupid enough to fire him.

338
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,916
So, you're saying no, right?

339
00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:48,521
No, no, no!

340
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,858
Come on!

341
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:29,294
Very good. Very good.

342
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:32,207
Here he is.
What'll we do with him?

343
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,761
To Africa! To the Berbers!

344
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,864
You're a more treacherous
coward than I thought.

345
00:32:44,024 --> 00:32:46,918
Sell him. I never want to
hear of him, again.

346
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,095
Go!

347
00:32:55,921 --> 00:32:58,457
<i>Death to Salluste!

348
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:00,704
<i>Kill Salluste!

349
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:05,717
Thief!

350
00:33:06,882 --> 00:33:07,889
<i>Punish him!

351
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,193
<i>Long live the King!

352
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:15,161
<i>The stake for Salluste!

353
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:16,865
<i>Death to Salluste!

354
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,665
[Death to Salluste]

355
00:33:43,552 --> 00:33:44,928
<i>Be right there.

356
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,165
Hey!

357
00:34:27,987 --> 00:34:31,049
What's this... hmm?

361
00:34:32,468 --> 00:34:33,498
Ah!

358
00:34:33,545 --> 00:34:34,754
A lady like you...

359
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,018
walking the streets of Madrid
at this hour?

363
00:34:37,022 --> 00:34:38,318
That's not prudent.

360
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:41,326
Think it's more prudent
like this, imbecil?

365
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:43,060
-Oh! Monseigneur!
- Shh!

362
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:06,749
-Know wham here?
- What?

363
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,328
Do you know why I'm here?
- No.

364
00:35:09,804 --> 00:35:13,398
Since you left I've sunk into
a frightful depression.

365
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:22,318
Sir doesn't realise
what 'she's' saying.

366
00:35:22,396 --> 00:35:25,998
I do. I thought of you a lot
since this morning.

367
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:29,747
Give me your hand. - No!
- Give it, here.

368
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:31,122
Gimme your hand.

378
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,704
Oh!

369
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,217
What a destiny!

370
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:41,450
You're homely - she's a beauty!

371
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:44,090
You're broke - she's very rich.

372
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:45,865
You're an idiot - she is too.

373
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:48,318
You're a valet - she's The Queen.

374
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:50,982
It's written there!

375
00:35:54,357 --> 00:35:56,740
She doesn't even know I exist.

376
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,342
What if, I, with my magic wand,

377
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:02,302
made this difference
vanish in one night?

378
00:36:02,444 --> 00:36:04,177
What if I turned you into...

379
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,482
Prince Charming?

380
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,161
Give me back your hand.
- No.

381
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:10,692
- Yes.
- No!

382
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:16,068
What luck you have!

383
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,391
And that luck is me!

384
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,138
This way, Monseigneur.

385
00:36:23,255 --> 00:36:24,802
On your knees before the King.

386
00:36:24,897 --> 00:36:28,295
He likes people on the ground.
When he arrives, you crawl.

387
00:36:28,427 --> 00:36:30,982
But, the Queen? Even on the
ground, she'll recognise me.

388
00:36:31,263 --> 00:36:34,705
Do you know how many lackeys,
like you, are in this palace?

389
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,435
- No.
- 800! So...

390
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,138
Let's review.

391
00:36:42,231 --> 00:36:45,231
Alright, I don't say
"chez" the barber's but "to" the barber.

392
00:36:45,308 --> 00:36:48,981
No, the other way.
Not "to", but, "chez" the barber's.

393
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:51,833
And you don't just say "hello"...

394
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:55,115
...but "meeting you here
makes this a happy place".

395
00:36:56,062 --> 00:36:57,223
That's very good.

396
00:36:57,685 --> 00:36:59,044
Very good!

397
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,830
Your place is squalid!

398
00:37:11,658 --> 00:37:14,478
How can one live in such a mess?

399
00:37:14,636 --> 00:37:17,431
This is where Monseigneur
lodges his staff.

400
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:19,619
Ahh! It's lovely.

401
00:37:20,047 --> 00:37:21,160
Very nice.

402
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:22,872
Are you happy, here?

403
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:25,072
- Huh?
- Yes.

404
00:37:25,991 --> 00:37:27,202
Get undressed.

405
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:37,888
What is your name?

406
00:37:38,478 --> 00:37:40,325
Don César,
Count of Gafaro.

407
00:37:40,443 --> 00:37:43,231
No, Ga-RO-fa, Count of Garofa!

408
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:46,284
Returned from the Americas.
Ga-RO-fa!

409
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:54,661
1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, hup!

410
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,130
- Hup!
- No!

411
00:37:57,102 --> 00:37:59,528
You really have no class!

412
00:38:05,268 --> 00:38:08,168
How about lying...
Can you lie?

413
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,325
It's very useful at court. Hm?

414
00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:16,458
Tell me a big lie.

415
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:19,675
Let's see if I believe you
or not.

416
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,185
A really big one. Go!

417
00:38:23,153 --> 00:38:26,896
Yesterday, in the coat-tails
of Sir's green suit,

418
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,396
I found 300,000 ducats.

419
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:31,138
Huh?! Where are they?

420
00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:33,013
Under my straw mattress.

421
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,271
Thief! Thief!
You robbed me.

422
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:50,708
No, Monseigneur, I lied to you.

423
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,448
Long live the King!

424
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:27,703
The King.

425
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:33,777
Dismount.

426
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,016
Put your hat back on.
You're a Spanish Grandee.

427
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,349
Grandees cover themselves
before the King.

428
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:48,685
Fine, let's go.

429
00:39:50,527 --> 00:39:51,552
Excuse me.

430
00:39:53,008 --> 00:39:55,582
Don't excuse yourself.
The poor excuse themselves.

431
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:57,840
When you're rich,
you're obnoxious.

432
00:39:58,152 --> 00:39:59,574
Fine, let's go.

433
00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:09,510
Una 'merveillosa'!

434
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:11,987
In Florence they call this

435
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:14,357
"una macchina infernale".
(infernal machine)

436
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:16,513
Are you mocking us, Giuseppe?

437
00:40:16,638 --> 00:40:19,935
This ridiculous firecracker
wouldn't hurt a fly.

438
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:22,435
Later on, I multiply the explosion by a thousand...

439
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:25,144
and the King of Spain... poof!

440
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:29,700
Messieurs.

441
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:32,950
In a moment, the King will be dead.

442
00:40:35,562 --> 00:40:37,075
One for all,...

443
00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:39,271
...each for himself.

444
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:47,991
What's gotten into you?

445
00:40:47,998 --> 00:40:50,240
I can't, Sir. I feel awful.

446
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:52,107
Can't we come back tomorrow?

447
00:40:52,193 --> 00:40:55,012
My Golden Fleece gets revoked
today, not tomorrow.

449
00:40:55,093 --> 00:40:56,615
Don't you wanna get to know
the Queen?

450
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,122
- Yes, but...
- Move, then!

451
00:41:01,362 --> 00:41:02,419
No!

452
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:05,482
I said no.

453
00:41:06,895 --> 00:41:09,158
What if they ask what I saw
in the Americas?

463
00:41:09,195 --> 00:41:10,458
Americans!

454
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,310
And with this,

455
00:41:14,924 --> 00:41:16,443
'you know who'...

456
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,755
will know who you are.

457
00:41:19,232 --> 00:41:20,381
Achh!

458
00:41:21,462 --> 00:41:22,560
Voila.

459
00:41:27,413 --> 00:41:28,610
The Infanta.

460
00:41:33,914 --> 00:41:37,188
Your fiancée, Monseigneur?
My compliments.

471
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,406
Prrpt!

472
00:41:48,626 --> 00:41:49,739
Prrpt!

461
00:41:53,747 --> 00:41:55,204
Ugly brat.

462
00:41:55,384 --> 00:41:57,374
Ill-bred, to boot.

463
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,029
I should've got a better man
to present me to the Queen.

464
00:42:04,114 --> 00:42:06,229
-Not a man with a revoked Fleece.
- Ingrate!

465
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:10,035
I spent all night transforming
a worm into a hidalgo.

478
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:16,202
Pfff!

466
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:18,528
Ill-bred!
Did you see that?

467
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:20,584
Where is he? Where'd he go?

468
00:42:24,552 --> 00:42:25,502
Where are you going?

469
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,450
-Last night, I lost my head.
- I don't care. Stay!

470
00:42:28,497 --> 00:42:31,044
And I wonder why
you'd do all this for me... hm?

471
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:32,568
No, I'd better go.

472
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,693
I order you to stay.

473
00:42:35,037 --> 00:42:36,419
No, Monseigneur, that's enough.

474
00:42:36,527 --> 00:42:39,950
Bow, scrape, stand, sit, lie,
salute like this, talk like that...

475
00:42:40,051 --> 00:42:41,802
I've had enough.
- Shut up!

476
00:42:41,914 --> 00:42:43,537
So, Mr. Marquis, good day to you!

477
00:42:44,052 --> 00:42:46,450
Oh you... You're...

478
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,185
Oh, yes, Monseigneur!
I'm ill-bred too.

479
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,560
Crrrk!

480
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:01,210
<i>The King! The Queen!

481
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:22,943
Is the exit this way or that?

482
00:43:26,685 --> 00:43:29,075
My Lords, the Grandees!

483
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,591
Aiy!

484
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:03,005
Aiy!

485
00:44:05,177 --> 00:44:07,473
My Lords, cover yourselves.

486
00:44:26,773 --> 00:44:30,140
<i>- My money! Did you forget?
- You'll be paid after.

487
00:44:30,275 --> 00:44:32,100
-No money, no bomb!
- Shh!

488
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:34,034
Listen, Giuseppe,...

489
00:44:34,122 --> 00:44:36,986
here's a promissory note. No!

490
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:40,247
The other half after the explosion.

491
00:44:42,132 --> 00:44:43,716
<i>Start the mechanism.

492
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,846
Careful, it'll blow in exactly
4 minutes, 30 seconds.

493
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:54,661
When it explodes, be at least
20 metres from the throne.

494
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:57,005
My God, the Queen!

495
00:44:57,439 --> 00:44:59,180
Hurry, hurry, Monsignor.

496
00:45:07,865 --> 00:45:10,396
-Where's the throne?
- That way.

497
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:12,211
Don Salluste,...

498
00:45:12,873 --> 00:45:14,560
Marquis of Montalégré,

499
00:45:16,712 --> 00:45:18,388
Baron Del Pisco,

500
00:45:20,482 --> 00:45:22,702
by order of his Majesty,

501
00:45:22,873 --> 00:45:24,818
our beloved King,

502
00:45:29,049 --> 00:45:32,302
you will retire to the
monastery of Saint Ignacio...

503
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:36,013
where you'll take
a vow of chastity...

504
00:45:37,657 --> 00:45:39,031
and of poverty.

505
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:41,786
Oh no, not poverty! Sire?

506
00:45:52,974 --> 00:45:56,919
<i>Sire, Don Salluste awaits
Your Majesty's pleasure.

507
00:46:00,611 --> 00:46:01,698
Don Salluste!

508
00:46:02,745 --> 00:46:05,714
You're no longer worthy
to be our companion.

509
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,456
As the Queen informed you...

510
00:46:09,443 --> 00:46:13,474
we retract your title of
'Knight of the Golden Fleece'.

511
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,318
It's heavy.

512
00:47:10,158 --> 00:47:11,365
Enough, Salluste!

513
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:16,294
Look out!

514
00:47:16,408 --> 00:47:17,427
Huh?

515
00:47:17,943 --> 00:47:20,130
Watch out, it's going to blow!

516
00:47:23,568 --> 00:47:24,939
Watch out, Sire!

517
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:28,092
The cushion! The cushion!

537
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:31,235
Ah! Ah! Ah!

538
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:46,654
Aaah!

518
00:47:47,633 --> 00:47:48,787
No!

519
00:48:08,787 --> 00:48:09,967
It's Salluste!

520
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:14,827
It's Salluste!
He tried to kill the King.

521
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:16,506
Arrest him!

522
00:48:17,138 --> 00:48:18,237
There he is.

523
00:48:18,344 --> 00:48:19,718
It's not me. I was here.

524
00:48:20,032 --> 00:48:22,646
I didn't move from here. Liar!

525
00:48:22,878 --> 00:48:23,904
Salluste!

526
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:26,755
Salluste!

527
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:31,021
No, Sire. For once, it wasn't me.
I was here, praying.

528
00:48:32,568 --> 00:48:35,543
Excuse me, your Majesty.
It's not him, it's him. Look.

529
00:48:35,636 --> 00:48:37,461
Give me back that paper.

530
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:45,011
Look, Sire, here's the proof.

531
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,433
Quickly!

532
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,813
Who are you, sir...

533
00:48:59,071 --> 00:49:00,993
who just saved our life?

534
00:49:01,335 --> 00:49:03,931
Well, your Majesty, I'm...

535
00:49:05,506 --> 00:49:06,907
I, I, I, I...

536
00:49:07,702 --> 00:49:08,946
I'm...

537
00:49:09,694 --> 00:49:13,521
My nephew, Sire. Don César...

538
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:17,357
Count of Gafaro.
- Ga-ro-fa!

539
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,482
Count of Garofa.

540
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,200
Returned from the Americas...

541
00:49:22,521 --> 00:49:24,429
Where I saw many Americans.

542
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:26,677
Don Salluste.

543
00:49:27,187 --> 00:49:28,208
Yes, Sire?

544
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:31,841
You have 5 minutes to leave
forever, through the Puerta del Sol.

545
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,067
He really has it in for me.

546
00:49:37,072 --> 00:49:38,750
- What?
- Has it in for me.

547
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,775
César!

548
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:40,950
That's you.

549
00:49:41,029 --> 00:49:42,247
César, come here.

550
00:49:45,975 --> 00:49:49,209
César, Von Garofa!

551
00:49:58,618 --> 00:50:00,013
On your knees.

552
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:17,416
I hope you'll be more
worthy of it than your uncle.

553
00:50:19,963 --> 00:50:20,977
Yes, Sire.

554
00:50:21,487 --> 00:50:24,935
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations...

555
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,294
To the Puerta del Sol!

556
00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:45,583
You're little bomb
wasn't very well rigged.

557
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,404
It exploded way too early... pft!

558
00:50:48,732 --> 00:50:50,286
But my bomb...

559
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:53,968
my big bomb, there
will explode much later.

560
00:50:54,336 --> 00:50:57,792
But when it blows, it'll make
a frightful scandal.

561
00:50:57,872 --> 00:50:58,996
I don't understand.

562
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:01,240
Never mind. Off to Barbary!

563
00:51:03,823 --> 00:51:05,019
Paf!

587
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:14,774
Ah!

564
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:18,452
You son of a bitch, Salluste!
I'll have your hide.

565
00:51:18,631 --> 00:51:22,312
Enough, César.
You've told this story 50 times.

566
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:13,170
Yalla, yalla!

567
00:52:16,105 --> 00:52:17,230
Yalla!

568
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,128
Yalla!

569
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:38,781
Where are you from?

570
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,062
Madrid.

571
00:52:41,778 --> 00:52:43,483
The King sold me for 500 dinars.

572
00:52:43,632 --> 00:52:45,421
The treasury's still empty.

573
00:52:45,885 --> 00:52:47,543
Asshole, Salluste!

574
00:52:47,972 --> 00:52:49,546
There have been big changes.

575
00:52:49,991 --> 00:52:51,874
Salluste is no longer in power.

576
00:52:52,241 --> 00:52:54,027
It's César now, his nephew.

577
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,518
César?!
Goddamit, I'M César!

578
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,575
Ashadu an la ilaha illa'llah.
(There is no God but Allah)

579
00:53:22,427 --> 00:53:27,443
Ashadu an la ilahaa...

580
00:53:39,943 --> 00:53:44,615
Ashadu anna Muhammadan Rasulu'llah
(Prophet Muhammed was his Messenger)

581
00:53:45,716 --> 00:53:49,693
Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar.
(God is great)

582
00:53:58,025 --> 00:54:00,853
Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar.

583
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:05,873
Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem
(In the name of God, most Gracious and Most Merciful)

601
00:55:00,151 --> 00:55:03,019
Mmmmm!

584
00:56:13,227 --> 00:56:14,703
- César.
- Sire?

585
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,563
What do you figure it'll be?

586
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:19,833
Oh, 3 to 4 million ducats, Sire.

587
00:56:19,952 --> 00:56:24,638
The "volontary" contribution
of His Excellency, the Marquis Del Basto.

588
00:56:25,107 --> 00:56:26,466
But, Sire, I don't understand.

589
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:29,341
The Del Bastos haven't
paid taxes for 300 years.

590
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,137
There's a first time for everything.

591
00:56:31,256 --> 00:56:33,591
- By what right?
- Divine right.

593
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,333
What do you make of that,
my dear Del Basto?

611
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:44,136
Oh!

594
00:56:44,147 --> 00:56:45,245
Your Majesty!

595
00:56:48,453 --> 00:56:50,073
Next, gentlemen!

596
00:56:51,143 --> 00:56:52,545
The brigand!

597
00:56:52,649 --> 00:56:54,059
That brigand took 5 million.

598
00:56:54,183 --> 00:56:55,427
I won't pay.

599
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:59,091
I will pay, gentlemen.
But I'll have the last laugh.

600
00:57:07,078 --> 00:57:08,890
- César?
- Yes, Sire?

601
00:57:08,991 --> 00:57:11,585
Why are your boots
always shinier than mine?

602
00:57:12,398 --> 00:57:14,232
I polish them myself, Sire.

603
00:57:14,341 --> 00:57:15,396
Yourself?

604
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:19,255
Hold on, I'll show you.
It's very simple.

605
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:21,622
Give me your leg.

606
00:57:22,348 --> 00:57:23,981
Their Excellencies:
the Marquis of Priégo...

607
00:57:24,282 --> 00:57:27,015
the Duke of Los Montès
and the Duke of Sandoval.

608
00:57:27,242 --> 00:57:28,303
Allow me.

609
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:32,482
Excuse me, Sire, but
it's the only way.

610
00:57:40,762 --> 00:57:42,200
Voila. Every morning.

611
00:57:42,314 --> 00:57:44,434
- Every morning?
- Yes, every morning.

612
00:57:44,739 --> 00:57:46,576
-Come on, give me your leg.
- No.

613
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:49,025
Oh, come on.
- Sire!

614
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:53,677
Sire, I protest.

615
00:57:53,794 --> 00:57:56,325
The poor pay taxes, not the rich.

616
00:57:56,501 --> 00:57:58,958
Exactly.
Not very fair, was it, Sire?

617
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:01,763
That's why we changed all that.

618
00:58:07,036 --> 00:58:10,263
There's a lot less gold on the scales
than before. Don't you think, César?

619
00:58:10,357 --> 00:58:13,029
Yes, I think so too, Sire.
Pardon me!

620
00:58:16,813 --> 00:58:18,755
Oh-lala, practically nothing!

621
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,255
Alley-oop!

622
00:58:34,022 --> 00:58:36,309
Let me down.

623
00:58:37,235 --> 00:58:39,107
Come on, don't pull that face!

624
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,372
Go, Brutus.

625
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,231
Your Majesty, I think...

626
00:58:42,344 --> 00:58:44,299
Enough! My horse!

627
00:58:45,018 --> 00:58:46,852
Come, I'll take you hunting.

628
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:48,137
Sire, the Queen!

629
00:58:48,941 --> 00:58:52,057
- She's waiting for you.
- Oh the Queen, the Queen!

630
00:58:52,683 --> 00:58:54,631
Tell her I'll see her tomorrow.

631
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,700
I'll first kill 6 wolves,
then I'll be back.

632
00:58:57,005 --> 00:58:58,068
Allez!

633
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,722
Por aqui, por alla!
(Over here, over there)

634
00:59:11,962 --> 00:59:13,139
Doña Isabella?

635
00:59:13,224 --> 00:59:14,764
No!

636
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:18,861
<i>Por aqui!

637
00:59:20,549 --> 00:59:21,588
<i>Por aqui!

638
00:59:26,844 --> 00:59:27,857
Por aqui.

639
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:29,074
Por alla!

640
00:59:29,657 --> 00:59:32,240
Your Majesty. Don César.

641
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:49,995
Was wollen sie?
(What do you want)

642
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:52,478
Madam, the King won't be back
until tomorrow.

643
00:59:52,637 --> 00:59:54,635
He was called away on
urgent affairs of state.

644
00:59:54,663 --> 00:59:58,315
You lie so badly.
Das ist sehr delikat.

645
00:59:59,251 --> 01:00:02,566
Plind-man's pluff,
mit us, play, Don Zésar?

646
01:00:02,571 --> 01:00:03,575
Your Majesty.

647
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:08,880
A Queen of Spain does not play
blind-man's buff with a gentleman.

648
01:00:08,894 --> 01:00:10,680
Wer sagt das? (Who says?)

649
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:12,049
Etiquette, Madam!

650
01:00:12,137 --> 01:00:16,196
Für dieses mal vergessen wie
die Etikette! (forget etiquette, for once)

651
01:00:17,188 --> 01:00:19,833
Blindfold the eyes of Etiquette.

652
01:00:19,941 --> 01:00:23,471
What? Madam...
Majesty, you can't really...

653
01:00:23,418 --> 01:00:25,575
Really, your Majesty!

654
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:26,779
Not me.

655
01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:24,788
Here I am. Where are you?

656
01:01:29,913 --> 01:01:32,319
Where are you, my little ones?

657
01:01:32,554 --> 01:01:33,561
Por aqui. (falsetto)

658
01:01:34,577 --> 01:01:35,585
Por alla!

659
01:01:42,356 --> 01:01:44,750
Por aqui, Doña Juana!

660
01:01:46,261 --> 01:01:47,435
Yo te tengo! (I got you)

661
01:01:47,586 --> 01:01:48,681
Si, si, si!

662
01:01:48,736 --> 01:01:51,057
Un poquito mas, por favor!
(A little farther)

663
01:01:51,217 --> 01:01:52,292
Por aqui!

664
01:01:53,537 --> 01:01:54,567
Ole!

665
01:01:57,061 --> 01:01:58,529
Who did that?

666
01:01:59,025 --> 01:02:00,399
Who dared?

667
01:02:02,082 --> 01:02:03,763
I was pushed.

668
01:02:04,237 --> 01:02:05,724
Who pushed me?

669
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,621
I swallowed water.

670
01:02:10,704 --> 01:02:11,857
I'm choking.

671
01:02:18,128 --> 01:02:19,290
Madame!

672
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:21,275
Achtung! (Careful)
Doña Juana!

673
01:02:22,311 --> 01:02:24,228
Don't worry, I drowned her.

674
01:02:24,439 --> 01:02:27,193
Those little pests will pay
for this.

675
01:02:27,308 --> 01:02:29,146
I need to talk to your Majesty.

676
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:32,005
Das ist streng verboten.
(strictly vorbidden)

677
01:02:32,435 --> 01:02:34,513
Shh... Shhh...

678
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,849
What's verboten is deceiving you.

679
01:02:38,975 --> 01:02:41,107
To let you think
I'm someone else.

680
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:43,435
Accepting the King's favours
meanwhile I...

681
01:02:43,565 --> 01:02:46,755
Was sagen Sie? Ich verstehe nicht.
(What? I don't understand)

682
01:02:47,025 --> 01:02:51,122
Voila. My name isn't César,
it's Blaze.

683
01:02:51,966 --> 01:02:54,583
I'm not Salluste's nephew.
I'm his valet.

684
01:02:54,747 --> 01:02:57,411
Ach... Valais?

685
01:02:58,032 --> 01:02:59,029
Valais!

686
01:02:59,216 --> 01:03:00,925
Swiss, you are?

687
01:03:01,685 --> 01:03:04,216
Why Swiss? What Swiss?

688
01:03:10,181 --> 01:03:12,337
Katastrophe!
Die Alte! (the old lady)

689
01:03:16,673 --> 01:03:17,962
Madame.

690
01:03:20,828 --> 01:03:23,122
I don't know how...
- Don César!

691
01:03:23,556 --> 01:03:27,154
Madame, I must tell you.
I love you!

692
01:03:33,632 --> 01:03:37,329
You're so beautiful,
so radiant, so luminous.

693
01:03:37,555 --> 01:03:38,555
No...

694
01:03:38,937 --> 01:03:40,169
Oh, yes, yes.

695
01:03:41,059 --> 01:03:42,608
I've desired you for months.

696
01:03:43,655 --> 01:03:46,013
I don't know if you do it
on purpose.

697
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:50,292
You're so coquettish
with your mischievous eyes.

698
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:52,776
Your little feet.

699
01:03:54,518 --> 01:03:56,260
Now that I've told you everything...

700
01:03:56,698 --> 01:03:59,831
if you want me to leave...

701
01:04:00,745 --> 01:04:02,555
tell me and I'll obey.

702
01:04:02,736 --> 01:04:03,892
Oh!

703
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:07,587
You're crying, Madame!

704
01:04:07,751 --> 01:04:08,781
Yes...

705
01:04:09,325 --> 01:04:10,692
Don César!

706
01:04:11,053 --> 01:04:13,208
-There you are!
- Shhh!

707
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:16,310
My dear Baron.

708
01:04:16,426 --> 01:04:20,060
I want to talk to you
about my taxes.

709
01:04:20,657 --> 01:04:24,591
You must understand, it's very
hard to meet the requirements.

710
01:04:28,684 --> 01:04:29,743
César.

711
01:04:30,335 --> 01:04:33,333
I'm yours, body and soul.
Whenever you want.

712
01:04:35,419 --> 01:04:36,607
Here's my hand.

713
01:04:44,237 --> 01:04:46,109
Why do you sigh, César?

714
01:04:47,526 --> 01:04:49,108
I love you too.

715
01:04:55,388 --> 01:04:56,717
Not so fast.

729
01:04:58,597 --> 01:04:59,592
Ah!

716
01:04:59,849 --> 01:05:01,825
You savage!

717
01:05:39,964 --> 01:05:42,269
Monseigneur,
what if they recognise you?

718
01:05:42,433 --> 01:05:44,572
6 months in exile,
everyone's forgotten me.

719
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:48,158
Wait for me under the ramparts.
I'll join the procession.

720
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:50,474
Blaze is surely there. Go!

721
01:06:08,387 --> 01:06:10,935
Hey, Blaze, is that you?

722
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:15,294
No.

723
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:22,833
Hey, César, is that you?

724
01:06:23,193 --> 01:06:24,178
Huh?

725
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:26,247
Nope, not him.

726
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:34,958
Guess why the Minister
isn't here?

727
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:37,161
He's with the King, as usual.

728
01:06:37,328 --> 01:06:39,271
Wanna know what they're doing?

729
01:06:39,488 --> 01:06:41,279
Another new law.

730
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:44,700
Now, when you kill a domestic,
you have to declare it.

731
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:49,891
Blaze!

732
01:06:54,481 --> 01:06:57,156
- César!
- César! No doubt about it.

733
01:06:57,367 --> 01:06:59,849
We need the courage
to stab him in the back.

734
01:07:01,865 --> 01:07:04,333
A plot against Blaze?
They'll fuck up everything!

735
01:07:04,482 --> 01:07:07,615
Never thought I'd miss
that old bastard, Salluste.

736
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:12,732
At least, he only stole from the poor.

737
01:07:12,872 --> 01:07:14,762
The surest way is poison.

738
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:16,825
Tomorrow is his birthday.

739
01:07:17,294 --> 01:07:20,849
Our best chance ever, to make
him eat a big poisoned cake.

740
01:07:35,873 --> 01:07:37,663
Imbecil!

741
01:07:38,056 --> 01:07:39,928
But it wasn't me!

742
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:46,060
Del Basto! Sandoval!

743
01:08:04,556 --> 01:08:06,673
So, what time tomorrow?

744
01:08:06,797 --> 01:08:09,775
3 o'clock at my place.
By 4, it'll all be over.

760
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:13,457
Aaaah!

761
01:08:14,135 --> 01:08:15,213
Priégo!

762
01:08:15,468 --> 01:08:17,459
Aaaaah!

763
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,045
Los Montès!

747
01:08:34,815 --> 01:08:36,852
Hey? Paf!

748
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,126
That... pfft!

749
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:46,824
Another plot.
Now, they want to kill Blaze.

750
01:08:46,942 --> 01:08:50,887
I absolutely must warn him
or my own plot is sunk.

751
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:55,901
Hey, mute. Mute!

752
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:57,228
Mute!

753
01:08:57,699 --> 01:08:59,855
He's deaf, to boot!

754
01:09:06,512 --> 01:09:07,779
I'm listening.

755
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:13,154
You're talking too fast.
Repeat.

756
01:09:18,248 --> 01:09:20,844
Don't shout, I'm not deaf!

757
01:09:23,157 --> 01:09:25,458
I don't hear a thing.
What's he saying?

758
01:09:25,566 --> 01:09:27,654
Stay out of our conversation.

759
01:09:27,853 --> 01:09:28,847
You, continue!

760
01:09:30,153 --> 01:09:31,215
Reforms?!

761
01:09:31,529 --> 01:09:33,286
He's making reforms?!

762
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:38,720
That's why they want him to eat
the big cake a la creme.

763
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,898
Not to fatten him up, imbecile,
to poison him.

764
01:09:43,069 --> 01:09:45,867
We can't, at any cost, let him eat it.

765
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:48,637
Why? Because, you imbecile...

766
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:52,129
if they kill my poor little
Blaze, tomorrow,

767
01:09:52,225 --> 01:09:55,988
I can't have the King catch
him in the Queen's bed.

768
01:09:56,247 --> 01:09:59,864
The King, cuckolded by my valet,
now, THAT'S vengeance!

769
01:10:37,514 --> 01:10:39,923
For you, César, my best bull.

770
01:10:40,256 --> 01:10:42,780
Look how brave he is.

771
01:10:43,383 --> 01:10:45,722
I branded him with your momogram.

772
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:51,064
Priégo, 3 months ago, I took your gold.

792
01:10:51,078 --> 01:10:53,564
Now you offer me your best bull.

773
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:54,716
What does it mean?

774
01:10:54,982 --> 01:10:57,682
It means, hombre,
I have no hard feelings.

775
01:10:57,974 --> 01:11:01,367
Come, there are more
suprises, ahead.

776
01:11:29,612 --> 01:11:30,728
Cyanide!

777
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,057
Caught you pilfering!

778
01:11:36,237 --> 01:11:37,515
Animal! Lout!

779
01:11:37,742 --> 01:11:38,671
Rogue!

780
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:41,443
Just you wait. Come with me

781
01:11:42,747 --> 01:11:45,622
to Don Marquis de Priégo.
- Not the Marquis.

782
01:11:45,664 --> 01:11:48,155
He'll have you flogged.
It'll amuse the guests.

783
01:11:48,021 --> 01:11:51,997
No, listen, your cream
isn't sweet, it's salty.

784
01:11:52,463 --> 01:11:54,318
- Salty?
- It's salty!

785
01:11:56,357 --> 01:11:57,486
It's sweet.

786
01:11:57,569 --> 01:11:59,208
It's salty... Yum-yum, yum!

787
01:12:00,058 --> 01:12:01,740
Go on, more.

788
01:13:22,554 --> 01:13:24,539
The Marquis... a lackey?

789
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:35,195
What are you doing, Monseigneur?
- Hide me and dance! Quickly.

790
01:13:36,165 --> 01:13:39,569
You've got some gall!
Calling on me among MY friends...

791
01:13:39,785 --> 01:13:41,413
...on MY birthday.

792
01:13:41,657 --> 01:13:44,349
Enjoy your birthday. It's your last.

793
01:13:44,763 --> 01:13:45,666
What?

794
01:13:45,778 --> 01:13:48,333
Your birthday cake's poisoned.

795
01:13:48,493 --> 01:13:51,661
Eat as little as possible,
play for time. I'll do the rest.

796
01:13:52,591 --> 01:13:55,677
They want to kill me? Who?
- YOUR friends!

797
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:56,879
César!

798
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:58,919
There they are. Mistreat me!

799
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,435
So, César, are you coming?

800
01:14:00,501 --> 01:14:02,657
Take that, you lout!
And that, scoundrel.

801
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:04,607
Not so hard.
- Take that!

802
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:06,599
Ayi!

803
01:14:11,842 --> 01:14:12,873
Enough!

804
01:14:18,466 --> 01:14:20,427
César, come cut your cake.

805
01:14:20,754 --> 01:14:22,841
Gladly. I'm deeply touched.

806
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:25,966
Really. It's a very kind
gesture among friends.

807
01:14:26,474 --> 01:14:28,529
If there were fewer flies,
it'd be perfect.

808
01:14:28,817 --> 01:14:30,607
Because it's hot at this time.

809
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:35,075
(gotta play for time) ... Never mind.

810
01:14:35,224 --> 01:14:38,052
Shouldn't be that many...

811
01:14:38,873 --> 01:14:39,943
Don't move...

812
01:14:40,152 --> 01:14:41,670
No, but look!

813
01:14:41,865 --> 01:14:43,474
See how many flies?

814
01:14:43,732 --> 01:14:45,302
Look, look!

815
01:14:45,865 --> 01:14:46,826
Don't move!

816
01:14:46,896 --> 01:14:47,623
Don't...

817
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:48,490
Don't move!

818
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:49,435
Don't move!

819
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,187
Look!

820
01:14:51,461 --> 01:14:52,591
There it is.

821
01:14:52,873 --> 01:14:55,505
It's tasting my cake... What?!

822
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,520
It's dead.

823
01:15:00,207 --> 01:15:02,973
- How curious!
- What are you waiting for?

824
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:05,107
Cut your cake and eat it.

825
01:15:06,094 --> 01:15:09,968
Such a fine cake merits a fine blade.

826
01:15:13,952 --> 01:15:15,083
Bon appetit, gentlemen!

827
01:15:15,161 --> 01:15:16,404
Treason!

828
01:15:24,322 --> 01:15:25,880
Leave him to me.

829
01:16:01,067 --> 01:16:02,067
Salluste!

830
01:16:16,136 --> 01:16:17,422
This way, hurry!

831
01:16:21,606 --> 01:16:22,603
There!

832
01:16:25,632 --> 01:16:26,593
Oh!

833
01:16:40,966 --> 01:16:42,787
Silence.
- Death to him!

834
01:16:43,134 --> 01:16:46,956
Gentlemen, I offer you an execution.
But not the bull's.

835
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:04,512
Hey!

836
01:17:06,266 --> 01:17:07,254
Hey!

837
01:17:13,779 --> 01:17:14,763
Hey!

838
01:17:15,446 --> 01:17:16,419
Ole!

839
01:17:17,928 --> 01:17:18,922
Ole!

840
01:17:29,927 --> 01:17:31,301
Ole!

841
01:17:40,317 --> 01:17:42,369
Gentlemen, our turn.

842
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:25,646
Hurry!

843
01:18:29,058 --> 01:18:30,231
Hurry! Hurry!

844
01:18:55,153 --> 01:18:57,051
Aah! Hahaha!

845
01:18:59,657 --> 01:19:01,543
Thank you, Monseigneur,
you saved me.

846
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:03,473
You're... You're...

847
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:06,685
You're my prisoner! Up!
- <i>But, Monseigneur...

848
01:19:07,207 --> 01:19:09,536
<i>What's gotten into you?

849
01:19:09,696 --> 01:19:11,062
Let me go!

850
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:13,044
Dump him in there. Move!

851
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:15,060
<i>Monseigneur? Oh, come on!

852
01:19:21,982 --> 01:19:23,045
Ho!

853
01:19:57,089 --> 01:19:58,144
Shh!

854
01:19:59,488 --> 01:20:00,847
Shh! Enough.

855
01:20:01,097 --> 01:20:02,191
Don't!

856
01:20:05,796 --> 01:20:07,021
Enough now.

857
01:20:08,724 --> 01:20:10,162
That's enough now, huh?

858
01:20:10,795 --> 01:20:12,091
Look there.

859
01:20:14,104 --> 01:20:15,762
The Queen's there...

860
01:20:15,941 --> 01:20:18,418
Cooperate or I'll pluck you.

861
01:20:18,517 --> 01:20:20,793
The Queen's up there.

862
01:20:21,051 --> 01:20:23,098
Window with a balcony.

863
01:20:23,222 --> 01:20:24,832
Look up there. Very good.

864
01:20:24,925 --> 01:20:27,810
Now let's rehearse...
Are you listening?

865
01:20:28,003 --> 01:20:30,443
Rehearse one last time.
OK, talk!

866
01:20:30,795 --> 01:20:33,247
Ta-ta-talk! Go on! Go on!

867
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:36,295
- Merde!
- You uncouth character!

868
01:20:36,451 --> 01:20:38,685
After what I paid for you!

869
01:20:38,889 --> 01:20:41,373
Don't say it again. Now talk!

871
01:20:41,599 --> 01:20:43,840
Prrrr! Talk!

872
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:53,453
Now repeat after me.

873
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:56,605
César sent me. Go on.

874
01:20:56,926 --> 01:20:58,528
César sent me.

875
01:20:58,691 --> 01:21:01,223
Very good. Perfect.
What do you say next?

876
01:21:01,395 --> 01:21:02,770
Yo te quiero.

877
01:21:02,902 --> 01:21:05,653
Not in Spanish, in German.
She's German.

878
01:21:05,871 --> 01:21:07,609
Ich liebe dich.

879
01:21:07,781 --> 01:21:08,776
Ich li...

880
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,310
Ich liebe dich, go on!

881
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,521
Hup!

882
01:21:16,762 --> 01:21:17,974
This way!

883
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,240
No, not that window!

884
01:21:32,272 --> 01:21:35,560
Why'd it go to the old lady?
What's it telling her?

885
01:21:35,954 --> 01:21:37,888
César sent me.

886
01:21:39,215 --> 01:21:40,216
César!

887
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:43,099
Caw, caw! Caw, caw! ...

888
01:21:50,808 --> 01:21:53,909
You say, tomorrow evening?

889
01:21:54,805 --> 01:21:57,772
In the Cabeza Negra inn?

890
01:21:58,471 --> 01:22:01,212
- He'll wait for you.
- He'll wait for me?

891
01:22:01,529 --> 01:22:03,735
Jawohl, mein Lieber!
(Yes, my love)

892
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,245
What's that frightful noise?

893
01:22:26,663 --> 01:22:28,985
You made a mistake. Come here.
- No.

894
01:22:29,131 --> 01:22:30,381
- Come!
- No!

895
01:22:30,686 --> 01:22:33,470
The Queen is there, up there. Go on.

896
01:22:40,014 --> 01:22:43,007
Ist da jemand im Garten?
(Anyone in the garden?)

897
01:22:43,107 --> 01:22:46,595
Ach! Was für ein schöner Papagei!
(What a lovely parrot!)

898
01:22:46,601 --> 01:22:48,473
Speak! Tell her.

899
01:22:55,237 --> 01:22:56,694
Ich liebe dich.

900
01:22:56,711 --> 01:22:57,911
Wirklich?
(Really?)

901
01:22:57,918 --> 01:23:01,999
Ich bin sent by Don Césarrr!

902
01:23:02,313 --> 01:23:04,560
Don César, are you zere?

903
01:23:05,114 --> 01:23:06,443
Yo te quiero.

904
01:23:06,749 --> 01:23:10,079
Rotten beast!
I'll fix you later!

905
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,613
Was für eine gute Idee!
(What a good idea)

906
01:23:13,638 --> 01:23:16,263
Das ist ganz romantisch!
(It's so romantic)

907
01:23:17,964 --> 01:23:20,120
Don César, are you fallink?

908
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:23,746
Nein, mein liebe,
ich bin konfortabel!

909
01:23:29,385 --> 01:23:33,003
Kommen Sie to see mich?... me...

910
01:23:33,153 --> 01:23:37,057
Tomorrow evening?
The Cabeza Negra inn?

911
01:23:38,297 --> 01:23:42,272
Ein rendezvous?
Das ist eine grosse folly!

912
01:23:42,447 --> 01:23:45,217
Nein, little folly!

913
01:23:45,459 --> 01:23:47,537
Can I count on you?

914
01:23:47,647 --> 01:23:48,654
Count?

915
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:52,575
Ja, count: Eins, zwei, drei... Count!

916
01:23:52,731 --> 01:23:55,099
Ja, I vill pee there.

917
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:58,205
Ach, she vill pee there!

918
01:24:00,803 --> 01:24:03,374
Gute Nacht, Don César.

919
01:24:05,929 --> 01:24:08,745
Auf Wiedersehen!

931
01:24:15,038 --> 01:24:16,235
Mmmmm.

920
01:24:30,786 --> 01:24:33,192
An anonymous letter for the King!

921
01:24:41,465 --> 01:24:43,980
An anonymous letter for the King!

922
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,926
Sire, you're too strong for me.

923
01:24:51,115 --> 01:24:53,380
An anonymous letter for the King!

924
01:24:57,735 --> 01:24:58,974
Anonymous letter?!

925
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:07,458
<i>Sire, your Majesty is a cuckold.

926
01:25:07,904 --> 01:25:10,152
What? Me?

927
01:25:10,497 --> 01:25:13,566
<i>Yes, you!
The Queen's cheating on you.

928
01:25:14,582 --> 01:25:16,529
With who?
<i>- With Don César.

929
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:17,911
The traitor!

930
01:25:18,065 --> 01:25:20,802
<i>The Queen intends to meet
him this evening...

931
01:25:20,969 --> 01:25:23,083
<i>at the Cabeza Negra inn.

932
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:27,763
<i>And... in a moment,
she'll come in and say:...

933
01:25:28,036 --> 01:25:29,208
Majesty!

934
01:25:34,786 --> 01:25:37,246
Your Majesty, mein papa, sick.

935
01:25:37,446 --> 01:25:40,980
To Bavaria, go, may I, bitte?

936
01:25:42,028 --> 01:25:43,652
When will you leave?

937
01:25:44,035 --> 01:25:45,130
Tonight.

938
01:25:45,278 --> 01:25:47,966
Sooner I leave, sooner I be back.

939
01:25:48,169 --> 01:25:49,579
Go, Madame.

940
01:25:50,762 --> 01:25:54,527
You may be certain my thoughts
will follow your every step.

941
01:25:54,966 --> 01:25:57,967
Danke, mein geliebter König.
(my beloved King)

942
01:26:30,086 --> 01:26:32,725
I don't understand
anything, anymore.

943
01:26:32,867 --> 01:26:34,858
Oh, you will understand!

944
01:26:44,989 --> 01:26:47,720
Look here; you save me,
you kidnap me, you tie me up...

945
01:26:47,843 --> 01:26:50,208
and you shave me. Why, hm?

946
01:26:50,427 --> 01:26:52,849
Well?... Be careful!

947
01:26:53,638 --> 01:26:56,369
What are you up to? Old bastard.

948
01:26:56,669 --> 01:26:57,966
I'll tell you.

949
01:26:59,513 --> 01:27:01,943
You're my pawn... I'm playing you.

950
01:27:02,037 --> 01:27:03,716
I clean up my pawn.

951
01:27:04,755 --> 01:27:05,825
There!

952
01:27:06,944 --> 01:27:07,981
Look.

953
01:27:10,299 --> 01:27:12,124
Remember that?

954
01:27:12,857 --> 01:27:15,560
- Oh no, no!
- Yes, yes! Oh yes!

955
01:27:16,052 --> 01:27:18,349
That hurts. Doesn't it hurt?

956
01:27:19,287 --> 01:27:21,304
I perfume my pawn.

957
01:27:21,858 --> 01:27:22,929
Voilà!

958
01:27:24,287 --> 01:27:26,241
I tart up my pawn.

959
01:27:29,501 --> 01:27:33,021
Making it handsome. Irresistible.

975
01:27:34,117 --> 01:27:35,361
Mmmmm.

960
01:27:37,014 --> 01:27:38,251
Not happy, huh?

961
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:43,333
Finished. Voila! How handsome!
Madame, look how handsome!

962
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:49,279
That's 3 times.

963
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:51,584
Never in 40 years,
but, 3 times today;

964
01:27:51,585 --> 01:27:54,544
me, a Grandee,
ass-kicked by a lackey!

965
01:27:54,632 --> 01:27:57,046
The asses of the lowly are as
good as the asses of the Grand.

966
01:27:57,192 --> 01:28:01,710
My, how your head has swelled!
It's enormous!

967
01:28:02,062 --> 01:28:04,732
I'll have you arrested.
You're no longer Minister.

968
01:28:07,303 --> 01:28:08,592
Wait!

969
01:28:11,715 --> 01:28:13,575
I'm gagging my pawn...

970
01:28:13,896 --> 01:28:17,044
- Woah! Ho!
- Mmh! Mmh!

971
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:19,286
Now, I'm calming my pawn.

972
01:28:21,325 --> 01:28:22,482
Wait for it...

973
01:28:23,581 --> 01:28:24,659
All done.

974
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,398
Hey, Mute! One-eye!

975
01:28:46,933 --> 01:28:48,530
Mute! One-eye!

976
01:28:50,054 --> 01:28:52,183
- Yes, Monseigneur?
- Still nobody? - No.

977
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:54,365
You, keep your eye open.

978
01:28:55,071 --> 01:28:56,575
And you: ...!

979
01:29:19,742 --> 01:29:20,789
Talk!.

980
01:29:22,013 --> 01:29:24,507
A mute... Just my luck!

981
01:29:47,575 --> 01:29:48,704
Ow!

982
01:30:03,874 --> 01:30:05,771
Don't look. There's nobody.

983
01:30:06,202 --> 01:30:07,357
Go away, go!

984
01:30:14,595 --> 01:30:15,681
Malaga.

985
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:20,431
Don't worry.
It's for beddy-byes.

986
01:30:22,212 --> 01:30:27,576
Later, in that bed, when you
wake up, you'll get a surprise.

987
01:30:30,998 --> 01:30:32,739
Don't move.

988
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:37,272
I'll go make myself handsome, too.
Back in 5 minutes.

989
01:30:54,374 --> 01:30:55,521
Who are you?

990
01:30:56,329 --> 01:30:57,700
Don César.

991
01:30:58,499 --> 01:31:00,005
The real one.

992
01:31:20,914 --> 01:31:22,018
There's somebody.

993
01:31:55,126 --> 01:31:56,741
Mi amor! (My love)

994
01:31:58,179 --> 01:31:59,784
Mi tesoro! (My treasure)

995
01:32:01,890 --> 01:32:03,378
Mi hombre! (My man)

996
01:33:27,253 --> 01:33:28,331
Mommy!

997
01:33:28,579 --> 01:33:31,005
The parrot told me everything.

998
01:33:31,164 --> 01:33:34,802
Really? Shh... the zebra
under the bed can hear us.

999
01:33:36,925 --> 01:33:41,132
This room, this love nest,
these flowers, this supper!

1000
01:33:41,618 --> 01:33:46,192
Hmm, bite me again, wild man!

1001
01:33:47,487 --> 01:33:50,370
What if we drank something first?

1002
01:33:50,653 --> 01:33:51,979
You great fool!

1003
01:33:52,297 --> 01:33:54,581
Trying to get me drunk?

1004
01:33:54,805 --> 01:33:58,060
- You first.
-After you, Juanita. Mi corazon!

1026
01:34:07,776 --> 01:34:09,352
Ahhh!

1005
01:34:14,536 --> 01:34:15,614
Monseigneur!

1006
01:34:16,544 --> 01:34:18,388
What is it?
What's happening?

1007
01:34:18,491 --> 01:34:20,293
The mute's been knocked out.

1008
01:34:20,318 --> 01:34:22,294
Blaze! It must be him.

1032
01:34:31,317 --> 01:34:33,424
Ah! The old dame!

1010
01:34:34,326 --> 01:34:36,296
What the hell's she doing here?

1011
01:34:36,304 --> 01:34:38,605
- Who is she?
- The dueña. (chaperone)

1012
01:34:38,609 --> 01:34:41,355
Where's the Queen?
Where's Blaze?

1013
01:34:43,362 --> 01:34:46,072
- The ingrate got away.
- He can't be far.

1014
01:34:46,182 --> 01:34:48,314
Go find him.

1015
01:34:48,468 --> 01:34:51,300
I need him in this bed
right away. Go!

1016
01:34:53,506 --> 01:34:55,993
You, this way;
me, that way.

1017
01:34:59,816 --> 01:35:03,072
Lemme go. Oop-la!

1018
01:35:35,444 --> 01:35:37,269
You're so strong.

1019
01:35:38,321 --> 01:35:40,311
Make love to me.

1020
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:43,694
No, we mustn't.

1021
01:35:43,952 --> 01:35:45,028
What's all this nonsense!

1022
01:35:46,744 --> 01:35:48,693
Go beddy-byes.

1023
01:36:25,562 --> 01:36:27,148
Who is it?

1024
01:36:27,158 --> 01:36:30,025
Ich bin es, Don César.
(it's me)

1025
01:36:34,381 --> 01:36:37,249
Ein Moment, bitte!

1026
01:36:45,701 --> 01:36:48,849
Kommen Sie, mein Liebling.
(come my darling)

1027
01:36:59,697 --> 01:37:02,314
It's done, Monseigneur!
- Shh!

1028
01:37:02,576 --> 01:37:04,416
I found him.
- Where is he?

1029
01:37:04,533 --> 01:37:07,002
I knocked him out and put him
back in the bed, like you said.

1030
01:37:07,208 --> 01:37:08,748
Bravo! Help me.

1031
01:37:29,614 --> 01:37:31,963
Ah! César, my nephew.

1032
01:37:33,033 --> 01:37:35,356
You made a mistake, imbecile!

1033
01:37:35,577 --> 01:37:38,290
It's your nephew. It's him.
- No it's not!

1034
01:37:38,435 --> 01:37:42,939
I sold him to the Berbers.
I took their money and spent it.

1035
01:37:43,429 --> 01:37:45,568
- Where'd you find him?
- There, in the hall.

1036
01:37:45,708 --> 01:37:48,536
He must've escaped!
I'm going crazy!

1037
01:37:49,067 --> 01:37:50,607
Let's put him with the old dame.

1038
01:38:07,595 --> 01:38:09,943
Your Majesty, my Queen,
mein Liebling.

1039
01:38:10,087 --> 01:38:13,260
You must wake up. Quick, wake up.

1040
01:38:16,365 --> 01:38:17,629
One!

1041
01:38:17,747 --> 01:38:19,052
Two!

1042
01:38:25,946 --> 01:38:29,290
- Majesty, your Majesty!
- Ich liebe dich, César.

1043
01:38:29,384 --> 01:38:32,053
Wake up. You don't understand
He wants to compromise you.

1044
01:38:32,524 --> 01:38:33,993
Küssen sie mich!

1045
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:37,063
"Küssen sie mich"?...
Ah yes, kiss.

1046
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:40,794
Oh, your Majesty, I'd love to,
but this is not the moment.

1047
01:38:45,913 --> 01:38:49,319
It's Blaze, I need!
Where the hell is he?

1073
01:38:49,579 --> 01:38:51,040
Ah!

1048
01:38:58,853 --> 01:39:01,032
He's there! You said he wasn't.

1049
01:39:01,157 --> 01:39:02,618
I don't understand.

1076
01:39:02,695 --> 01:39:04,053
Ah!

1050
01:39:05,297 --> 01:39:07,087
There, voilà.

1051
01:39:08,388 --> 01:39:11,357
Her, like so; 
and him, like so.

1052
01:39:24,485 --> 01:39:26,842
César, I love you.

1080
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:29,848
Oh! Aaah!

1053
01:39:50,489 --> 01:39:51,794
Dismount!

1054
01:39:56,436 --> 01:39:58,428
César! César!

1055
01:39:58,717 --> 01:39:59,925
Come!

1056
01:40:01,564 --> 01:40:02,771
Your Majesty!

1057
01:40:08,568 --> 01:40:10,447
Search the house and bring
everybody to me.

1058
01:40:10,561 --> 01:40:11,556
Go, hurry!

1059
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:13,181
Salluste!

1060
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:15,384
What are you doing here?

1061
01:40:18,914 --> 01:40:20,526
Where's the Queen?

1062
01:40:22,089 --> 01:40:24,230
Did his Majesty receive
my anonymous letter?

1063
01:40:24,288 --> 01:40:25,808
Where's the Queen?

1064
01:40:27,299 --> 01:40:30,027
Upstairs, Sire. I'll show you.

1065
01:40:37,284 --> 01:40:38,396
Hurry.

1066
01:40:41,072 --> 01:40:42,185
Watch out!

1067
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:49,792
<i>Mmf!

1068
01:40:55,833 --> 01:40:59,263
So we agree, I rendered you
a great service.

1069
01:40:59,372 --> 01:41:04,789
You repudiate the Queen and return
my titles, my money, my Fleece.

1070
01:41:06,259 --> 01:41:07,828
Here we are.

1071
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:30,896
Sire! You, here?

1072
01:41:31,027 --> 01:41:35,949
Wake up, Juanita, my little
angel. The King is here.

1073
01:41:36,513 --> 01:41:37,634
Oh, Sire!

1074
01:41:38,233 --> 01:41:40,978
Doña Juana, have you no shame?

1075
01:41:41,158 --> 01:41:42,978
Oh no, Sire!

1076
01:41:43,653 --> 01:41:45,419
And you, César, huh?

1077
01:41:48,039 --> 01:41:50,825
- Where's the Queen?
- The Queen, here?

1078
01:41:50,993 --> 01:41:54,982
She left for Bavaria, Sire,
because of her papa is ill.

1079
01:41:56,029 --> 01:41:58,661
That's why Doña Juana and I...

1080
01:41:58,856 --> 01:42:00,692
took the opportunity.

1081
01:42:44,341 --> 01:42:45,740
Tell me, Salluste.

1082
01:42:47,294 --> 01:42:51,023
That's enough. You're in
the room of a young girl.

1083
01:42:51,466 --> 01:42:55,601
Sire, Sire!
I'm no longer a girl.

1084
01:42:55,815 --> 01:42:57,958
- Marry us.
- No, hey! Woah!

1085
01:42:58,136 --> 01:43:01,520
I mean... Let me explain, Sire.

1086
01:43:01,937 --> 01:43:03,318
Let me see if I can.

1087
01:43:03,655 --> 01:43:07,695
There's nobody else. We searched
everything. Only found these two.

1088
01:43:09,486 --> 01:43:11,630
Who are these two men?
Salluste!

1089
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,091
Where is he?

1090
01:43:18,435 --> 01:43:19,648
Giddy up.

1091
01:43:27,621 --> 01:43:28,862
César.

1092
01:43:29,784 --> 01:43:31,472
Küssen Sie mich!

1093
01:43:32,294 --> 01:43:33,521
What did she say?

1094
01:43:33,637 --> 01:43:35,427
Kiss her, you fool.

1095
01:43:44,963 --> 01:43:47,618
Salluste!
Where are you going?

1096
01:43:47,757 --> 01:43:49,524
Nowhere, Sire.

1097
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:52,911
I was looking for your Majesty.

1098
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:54,919
So, Salluste...

1099
01:43:57,511 --> 01:43:59,075
am I a cuckold?

1100
01:44:16,957 --> 01:44:18,230
Wait!

1101
01:44:19,827 --> 01:44:21,230
Wait!

1102
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:34,238
Yalla!

1103
01:44:39,838 --> 01:44:41,502
Look who's coming.

1104
01:44:41,783 --> 01:44:43,494
Look who's there.

1105
01:44:43,956 --> 01:44:45,353
The Grandees!

1106
01:44:57,823 --> 01:44:58,987
Yalla!

1107
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:04,251
I have the ritziest penal colony
in all of Sahara.

1108
01:45:19,596 --> 01:45:21,885
Anyway, we're not going
to rot here.

1109
01:45:21,904 --> 01:45:24,193
I have a little plan to escape.

1110
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:25,706
We go back to Madrid.

1111
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:27,352
We conspire together.

1112
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:29,622
The King repudiates the Queen.

1113
01:45:29,747 --> 01:45:31,684
The old dame marries the parrot.

1114
01:45:31,818 --> 01:45:33,391
César becomes King.

1115
01:45:33,551 --> 01:45:36,029
I marry him and voilà, I'm the Queen!

1116
01:45:37,099 --> 01:45:42,005
Listen, Salluste, don't you notice your
head swelling enormously sometimes?

1117
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:43,630
Know what I mean?

1118
01:45:44,735 --> 01:45:47,615
What are you doing here
then, my dear César?

1119
01:45:47,847 --> 01:45:50,286
His name is not César.
It's Blaze.

1120
01:45:51,485 --> 01:45:53,427
The King said to me:
"You have a choice.

1121
01:45:54,115 --> 01:45:56,808
Either you marry Doña Juana,
or it's the Berbers for you.

1122
01:45:56,915 --> 01:45:58,105
And?

1123
01:45:58,222 --> 01:46:00,162
And it's the Berbers.

1124
01:46:02,441 --> 01:46:03,894
Yoohoo!

1125
01:46:04,391 --> 01:46:05,801
César!

1126
01:46:05,891 --> 01:46:06,901
Oh no!

1127
01:46:07,609 --> 01:46:08,354
The old dame!

1128
01:46:08,609 --> 01:46:10,848
César! César!

1129
01:46:11,109 --> 01:46:13,893
I'm here! It's me!

1130
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:15,477
Oh no!

1131
01:46:15,734 --> 01:46:18,269
Oh no, help!

1132
01:46:27,048 --> 01:46:28,043
Help!

1133
01:46:28,136 --> 01:46:31,677
César, wait for me,
my love.

1134
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:39,690
