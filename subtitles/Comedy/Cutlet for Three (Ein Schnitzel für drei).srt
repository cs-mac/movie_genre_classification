3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,730
<i>To be honest...</i>

4
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:11,500
<i>Before Seong Min died...</i>

5
00:00:12,164 --> 00:00:18,110
Soo Hyeon, Kwang Hee, and I
donated our sperm...

6
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:21,239
<i>And the baby that was born is Ha Seon.</i>

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,934
What?

8
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:26,305
You donated what?

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,769
Sperm donation!

10
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:36,355
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:37,168 --> 00:00:38,915
Sperm donation?

12
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:41,924
Na Yeong, we're home...

13
00:00:42,044 --> 00:00:45,821
Na Yeong, this is for stone therapy.
You put it on your back, and...

14
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:51,133
Say that again.

15
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:53,720
What do you mean sperm donation?

16
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,122
I...

17
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:04,599
Na Yeong

18
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:06,976
So you're saying...

19
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,845
That the three of you went behind
my back and did what?

20
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:20,556
- Na Yeong, it's not what it sounds like.
- Kyeong Tae, what are you doing?

21
00:01:20,676 --> 00:01:25,368
Kyeong Tae said, but whatever he said,
don't believe him. He's wrong, okay?

22
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:31,340
No, I want to hear it from Kyeong Tae.

23
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:39,447
Is what you said true?

24
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,488
Na Yeong, it's not what it sounds like.
That's...

25
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:42,648
Yes.

26
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:45,762
It's true.

27
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:55,168
Oh my god!

28
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:00,252
How can this be?

29
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:01,364
No.

30
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:02,785
No.

31
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:07,372
We should have told you earlier.

32
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:10,723
What kind of situation is this?

33
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:15,917
So, Ha Seon isn't Seong Min's child?

34
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:20,840
Na Yeong,
Na Yeong!

35
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:31,364
Is it okay to leave her like this?

36
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:34,902
What should we do?
I think the shock was too much for her.

37
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,168
It would be strange if she didn't faint.

38
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:40,350
We announced that Ha Seon
isn't Seong Min's baby.

39
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,840
Kyeong Tae, that bastard!

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,822
Soo Hyeon!

41
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:45,001
Kyeong Tae, where are you?

42
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:46,948
- Where are you?
- Soo Hyeon, this isn't the time.

43
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:49,195
You two come have a seat here too.

44
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:50,406
Mother...

45
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:52,697
I said come sit here!

46
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:03,603
I heard everything from Kyeong Tae.

47
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:06,486
How much did you tell her?

48
00:03:06,606 --> 00:03:08,883
I told her the whole truth.

49
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:11,446
How much of the truth?

50
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,288
That I think Ha Seon is my child.

51
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:14,561
What?

52
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:21,207
Mother, I think Kyeong Tae
is largely mistaken here.

53
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:22,892
Mistaken?

54
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:26,187
So you three didn't donate your sperm?

55
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,152
No, that's not it.

56
00:03:28,272 --> 00:03:32,308
So then why did you hide that
from Ha Seon's mom and me?

57
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,199
What were your intentions?

58
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,794
Mother, we didn't have any motives.

59
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:40,489
Seong Min asked us to keep it a
secret until the day we died.

60
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:42,436
You think that kind of secret can be kept?

61
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,458
It's a matter of bloodline.

62
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:46,088
Bloodline?

63
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:48,746
I called and told your mother
to come, Kwang Hee.

64
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:51,535
My mother? Why?

65
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:54,156
It's a matter of blood.

66
00:03:54,276 --> 00:04:00,040
The adults have to discuss what we're
going to do about Ha Seon and her mom.

67
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,163
What?

68
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,287
You kids.

69
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:05,331
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

70
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:09,505
Why can't you think about your
actions? You thoughtless kids.

71
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,895
My goodness. What kind of
strange situation is this?

72
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:17,254
Sperm donation all of a sudden?

73
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:20,792
I'm going to go crazy
and jump off a bridge!

74
00:04:29,264 --> 00:04:30,406
No.

75
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:34,092
This could be a good thing too.

76
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:40,605
Kwang Hee would have lived alone
all his life and give me a headache.

77
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,020
Yes.

78
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:48,840
If I can use this opportunity to get
him married, it could be a good thing.

79
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:55,282
I knew there was something
familiar about Ha Seon.

80
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:56,910
Hm?

81
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:08,278
Get the door, it's your mother.

82
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:21,600
Mom.

83
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,269
Father? What are you doing here?

84
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:31,920
Your mother called me
and told me to drop by.

85
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,784
Is there something the matter
with my daughter, Na Yeong?

86
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:38,301
She was saying something
that I couldn't understand.

87
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,698
Something about sperm donation.

88
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,682
What is she talking about?

89
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:45,659
That's...

90
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:52,297
Oh, you arrived here first.

91
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:55,499
How have you been these days?

92
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,321
Have you been well?

93
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:01,233
There have been some special issues.

94
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,397
Mom, why?

95
00:06:04,517 --> 00:06:06,419
Why? Why?

96
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,156
How can you even ask that?

97
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:10,628
Okay, okay, let go and talk.

98
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:13,099
Go sit over there.

99
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,401
Hello Mother.

100
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:16,768
Mother.

101
00:06:16,888 --> 00:06:18,704
Hello Father.

102
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:20,108
You've arrived.

103
00:06:22,186 --> 00:06:24,002
It's good that you came.

104
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:26,866
Have a seat over here.

105
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:30,851
Have a seat.

106
00:06:36,654 --> 00:06:38,657
You guys, have a seat too.

107
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:43,403
What do you think you're doing?

108
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:45,181
Kneel!

109
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:55,204
The thing that you said earlier,
what were you talking about?

110
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:58,125
Sperm donation?

111
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,733
My goodness.

112
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:10,451
So they're saying that this
could be Kyeong Tae's baby?

113
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:13,242
What are you talking about?

114
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:16,481
She looks exactly like my Kwang Hee.

115
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:17,997
Look here.

116
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:19,645
See what?

117
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,757
Don't be like that.

118
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:26,344
As soon as we do a DNA
test, we'll know everything.

119
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:27,662
I guess so.

120
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:29,010
Of course.

121
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,979
There are rules in this world. We
have to find out who the father is.

122
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,094
He could even become my son-in-law.

123
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:46,286
Na Yeong.

124
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:49,720
Looks like your consciousness
has returned.

125
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,554
Are you okay?

126
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:54,287
You must have been really shocked.

127
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,140
Have some water.

128
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,148
Ha Seon, where is she?

129
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:00,526
She's sound asleep.
Don't worry about her.

130
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,780
Here.

131
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:11,649
You still don't look well.
Why don't you lie back down.

132
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:13,540
I'm okay.

133
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:16,255
Father, how did you...

134
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,677
I heard everything.

135
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,217
How is it that Ha Seon is
not Seong Min's daughter?

136
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:21,902
Father!

137
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:24,204
What are you talking about?

138
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:27,705
Ha Seon is Seong Min's daughter.
Don't even put those words in your mouth.

139
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:29,616
Anyway.

140
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,499
What should we do about this?

141
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:39,108
Na Yeong, I'm sorry to bring this up.

142
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,283
But we have no other choice,

143
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:45,184
so please don't be upset and
think about it from our side.

144
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:46,419
What?

145
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:49,133
Are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?

146
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:50,751
You couldn't even keep the secret
that Seong Min asked of us,

147
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:53,052
and you had to go tell
everything to your mother?

148
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:54,694
What could I have done?

149
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:57,995
Mom was telling me to kick
Na Yeong and Ha Seon out.

150
00:08:58,114 --> 00:09:00,550
You should have done everything to
change her mind, aren't you a man?

151
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,190
How can I lie to my mom?
I can't do that.

152
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,099
Fine. Good for you.

153
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:06,653
I knew you'd do this.

154
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:09,592
I told you many times to watch what
you said, and you messed up repeatedly.

155
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:12,462
And finally you messed up big time.
What are you going to do now?

156
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:14,596
Be quiet. You yelling isn't
going to change anything.

157
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:17,086
What are you going to do?
How are you going to fix this?

158
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:18,575
I'll take care of it.

159
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:20,802
How? What are you going
to take responsibility for?

160
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:22,702
Anyway, don't worry about it.

161
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:24,903
In any case, Ha Seon's my baby,
so I'll take responsibility for her.

162
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,007
You bastard.

163
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:27,224
Let go and talk.

164
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:29,364
Go ahead, hit me.
Hit me.

165
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:33,370
- You're still out of your mind. Stop it!
- This isn't going to change anything.

166
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:39,253
Na Yeong, don't be like this,
hear us out.

167
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:42,491
What do you mean paternity test?
Don't ever say that in my presence again.

168
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:45,904
But we have to do the test to
find out who the father is.

169
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:50,303
We should do this right. It's
not just a matter of Ha Seon.

170
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,531
Ha Seon is Seong Min's baby!

171
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:57,031
Na Yeong, Na Yeong, Na Yeong!

172
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:59,801
Hold on, hear us out.

173
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:03,097
I thought that the reason
you three were kind to me

174
00:10:03,198 --> 00:10:05,798
was because of your
friendship with Seong Min.

175
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:09,242
But this is what it was about?

176
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,939
How could you do such a huge
thing without me knowing?

177
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:15,595
How could you trick me like this?

178
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,115
Na Yeong, first, please
calm down, and hear us out.

179
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:21,068
We didn't mean to lie to you.

180
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,900
We did it for you and Ha Seon's sake.
Why can't you believe us?

181
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,266
It's true.

182
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:28,903
You know how much
we all love Ha Seon.

183
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:31,581
Then you should have kept
it a secret until the end.

184
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:33,041
Why now?

185
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:34,314
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,747
It's all my fault.

187
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:38,114
No.

188
00:10:38,695 --> 00:10:41,822
It could be a good thing
that I found out now.

189
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:46,951
Don't ever talk about
sperm donation in front of me.

190
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:48,992
And from now on

191
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:52,776
I don't think I can see
the three of you anymore.

192
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:55,865
And the three of you should give
up on seeing Ha Seon ever again.

193
00:10:55,985 --> 00:10:57,044
What?

194
00:10:57,164 --> 00:10:58,804
Thank you for everything until now.

195
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,248
I will do anything I can to repay
the debt that I owe to you.

196
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:03,353
Good-bye.

197
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:06,618
Na Yeong, where are you going
in the middle of the night?

198
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:09,661
She's going to stay with me for now.

199
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:11,906
Please get out of the way.

200
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:13,815
Na Yeong, let's go.

201
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:19,717
Na Yeong, Na Yeong!

202
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,687
What are we going to do?

203
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:30,217
Na Yeong, Na Yeong, no!
Please don't leave.

204
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:32,136
Na Yeong, let go of your anger,
and listen to what I have to say.

205
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:34,337
How can you just leave like this?

206
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:35,062
Ha Seon.

207
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:36,897
Taxi, Taxi!

208
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:51,911
Na Yeong.

209
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:01,753
<i>Mommy? Where are we going
without my Daddies?</i>

210
00:12:01,873 --> 00:12:04,617
<i>I want to live with my Daddies.</i>

211
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,703
<i>Apba! Papa! Daddy!</i>

212
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:14,015
The room is as small as a booger,
but the air is great.

213
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:15,925
We even have a front yard.

214
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:29,578
I'll clean the yard first
thing in the morning.

215
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:31,500
Let's go inside.

216
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,169
Come in,

217
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:41,506
Come in.

218
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:48,697
I did mop the floor.

219
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:50,869
Have a seat

220
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:53,490
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

221
00:13:56,926 --> 00:14:01,438
The room is somewhat small, but it should
be enough for you and Ha Seon.

222
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:04,431
Once I go out to the human market
(a place for daily waged jobs)

223
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:08,237
I don't come home for days from the
construction site, or I return late daily.

224
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:10,558
Dad, you go to the human market?

225
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:13,816
You and your daughter are in
this situation because of me.

226
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,461
I'm ashamed to see you.

227
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:19,325
Isn't it hard?

228
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:21,232
Of course, it's hard.

229
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:24,939
The only thing I ever did in
my life was play Go-Stop.

230
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:30,124
Oh, let me get the blankets.

231
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:50,788
You know what? I'm going to
go to the corner supermarket.

232
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:52,342
What for?

233
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:55,431
The only thing there is to eat is ramyeon.

234
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:59,406
I need to get some rice and side
dishes for breakfast tomorrow.

235
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,570
Here's some money.

236
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,247
No, no. I have money!

237
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,726
Grandpa wants to get something
yummy for his granddaughter,

238
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,027
so don't be like that.

239
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:12,187
I have money.

240
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:15,781
Ha Seon, Grandpa will be
right back, bye bye.

241
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,878
See you later.

242
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:43,810
How could this be?

243
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,359
How could this be?

244
00:15:51,386 --> 00:15:53,426
This doesn't make any sense.

245
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,646
No sense at all.

246
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:02,843
She looks just like Seong Min.

247
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:05,550
I can't believe it.

248
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,539
Why are you like this?
Why are you crying, you're a man.

249
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:21,698
Ha Seon and Na Yeong
left because of me.

250
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:24,824
This is all your fault, Mom.

251
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:26,256
What?

252
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:29,327
You think this is all my fault?

253
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:35,299
Hey, you. You, jerk!

254
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,226
Think clearly about this.

255
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:40,698
Ha Seon's mom is Seong Min's woman.

256
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:41,858
Do you know?

257
00:16:41,978 --> 00:16:43,599
Seong Min's wife!

258
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:47,544
How can you fall for
your friend's woman?

259
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,622
I don't know.

260
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:53,460
My heart is exploding.

261
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,043
Do you want to see
my insides reversed?

262
00:16:57,244 --> 00:17:02,036
It's not late. Try to harden your
heart and set right your feeling.

263
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:03,777
Do you understand?

264
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,154
It should be here somewhere?

265
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:16,059
It's too thin for me to see.

266
00:17:18,795 --> 00:17:20,574
Mom, aren't you leaving?

267
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:22,371
Yes, I will.

268
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,281
What are you looking for?

269
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:27,856
I found it!

270
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,411
Do you think this is it?

271
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:31,318
What?

272
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:33,100
Ha Seon's hair.

273
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,201
What?

274
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:38,112
We can do a paternity test and find
out whether she's your child or not.

275
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:39,141
Mom!

276
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:40,583
What?

277
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:47,262
If she's not yours, there's no problem,
but if she is, then we can keep her.

278
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:50,070
I wish she were yours.

279
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,488
Mom, are you crazy?

280
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:55,596
Don't worry about it for now.
I'll take care of it.

281
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:58,497
Oh, and I need one of
your hairs, give me one.

282
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,952
Gosh, really!

283
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:06,483
Sorry, I pulled too much.

284
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:12,603
Give it, give it!

285
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:15,074
Spit it out, spit it out!

286
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,366
It's gone, it's gone.

287
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:17,358
Say Ah.

288
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:18,369
It's gone.

289
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:20,172
You jerk.

290
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:26,414
Mom, that's enough, just go.

291
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:27,650
Alright.

292
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,602
Come on, go.

293
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:33,309
Alright, alright, just hold on.

294
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:36,928
- I'll go even if you tell me not to go.
- Then hurry and go.

295
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:54,658
You listen carefully.
Don't go looking for Ha Seon's mom.

296
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:56,156
Do you understand?

297
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:57,485
Have a safe drive home.

298
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:59,937
Mother, have a safe drive home.

299
00:19:01,355 --> 00:19:03,339
We're sorry to have caused you concern.

300
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:05,904
That's okay. I'll call again.

301
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:07,870
Don't come out. Go on in.

302
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,440
Go in, go in.

303
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,582
Yes, go in.

304
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:11,612
Bye Mom.

305
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:12,922
Go up.

306
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:19,343
What are we going to do about this?

307
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:23,875
How is this something to smile about?

308
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:27,342
What's so good about this?
Why are you smiling?

309
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:30,544
There's something like that.

310
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,521
I'll leave now.

311
00:20:00,418 --> 00:20:05,173
If I test this, we'll solve
this issue quickly.

312
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:10,794
<i>Na Yeong</i>

313
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:31,584
<i>Na Yeong, we didn't mean to trick you</i>

314
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:48,974
<i>Na Yeong, I'm sorry.</i>

315
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:52,232
<i>The promise that I made with Seong Min
made me have to lie to you.</i>

316
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:58,828
<i>Na Yeong, we never thought
things would go so far.</i>

317
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,243
<i>Please forgive us.</i>

318
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:06,560
<i>But we weren't taking care of
Ha Seon for the sense of duty</i>

319
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:11,615
<i>We really love Ha Seon.</i>

320
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:14,030
<i>You too.</i>

321
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,317
<i>I miss you, Na Yeong.</i>

322
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:34,759
Na Yeong, where are you?

323
00:21:35,246 --> 00:21:37,287
I'm really sorry.

324
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:38,934
Are you okay?

325
00:21:39,054 --> 00:21:41,498
Is Ha Seon okay?

326
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,485
Na Yeong, let's meet.

327
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:49,117
We'll meet, and I'll explain everything.

328
00:21:51,183 --> 00:21:52,512
Na Yeong.

329
00:21:54,141 --> 00:21:56,219
Where are you?

330
00:21:58,353 --> 00:22:00,319
Please call me just once.

331
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,810
I'll wait.

332
00:22:19,764 --> 00:22:21,842
Seong Min.

333
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:25,911
Why did you do it?

334
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:31,527
Why did you do it? Why?

335
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:34,675
Say something.

336
00:22:39,842 --> 00:22:41,750
I want to have a baby.

337
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,378
Let's talk later.

338
00:22:43,498 --> 00:22:45,475
You really hate going to
a hospital that much?

339
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:47,815
Can't you do this for me,
no matter how much I want it?

340
00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:48,976
Okay.

341
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:51,226
Then I'll put that on.

342
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:53,547
No, you don't have to put that on.

343
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,981
No. I will.

344
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:58,845
Let's go to the hospital one more time.

345
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:01,944
What are you doing?

346
00:23:02,636 --> 00:23:03,554
Hm?

347
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,463
What are you doing?

348
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:09,692
I'm going to put these in the
office and have it diligently.

349
00:23:09,812 --> 00:23:12,612
Seong Min, who do you want
our baby to take after?

350
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:15,477
I hope that baby looks a lot like you.

351
00:23:15,597 --> 00:23:16,768
Me?

352
00:23:17,502 --> 00:23:21,452
The baby can't take after me.
It has to take after you.

353
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:30,417
Seong Min, did I make
it difficult for you?

354
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:36,387
Was I too greedy?

355
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:40,262
Is that why you made that kind
of request to your friends?

356
00:23:40,382 --> 00:23:41,966
Behind my back?

357
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,987
Then this is all my fault.

358
00:24:00,468 --> 00:24:02,322
Ha Seon, I'm sorry.

359
00:24:02,865 --> 00:24:04,212
I'm sorry.

360
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:10,312
That doesn't mean that
Mommy doesn't love you.

361
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:12,203
You know that, right?

362
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,003
You're my daughter.

363
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:19,973
I love you so much.

364
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:37,337
Maybe.

365
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:45,066
Maybe if Daddy didn't do that
for us, we may not have met.

366
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,869
So let's be grateful to Daddy, okay?

367
00:25:08,195 --> 00:25:10,048
<i>Congratulations, you're pregnant.</i>

368
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:11,845
<i>- Thank you Doctor!
- Na Yeong!</i>

369
00:25:14,242 --> 00:25:16,131
If you're happy, then I'm happy.

370
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:20,212
This baby is a gift
from the heavens.

371
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,908
Seong Min,

372
00:25:47,948 --> 00:25:49,240
thank you.

373
00:25:52,722 --> 00:25:55,322
I won't think otherwise anymore.

374
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,314
Ha Seon is a gift from the heavens.

375
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:12,026
The greatest gift
that you left for me.

376
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:51,607
Is this the place
for paternity tests?

377
00:26:51,963 --> 00:26:54,415
Yes.
Would you like a paternity test?

378
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,242
Does that work with strands of hair?

379
00:26:57,362 --> 00:27:00,881
Yes. Did you bring the hairs
that you wanted to test?

380
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:01,836
Yes.

381
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:10,279
This is the father's.

382
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:12,092
This is the baby's.

383
00:27:12,212 --> 00:27:13,253
Yes.

384
00:27:28,562 --> 00:27:30,996
Oh, it's moving.

385
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:34,025
Wow, he's strong!

386
00:27:34,145 --> 00:27:35,897
It moved again.

387
00:27:38,275 --> 00:27:40,971
I'll make you a diaper, here.

388
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,808
Oh, you're so stubborn, here.

389
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:09,071
Ha Seon, I could never leave
you in a place like this.

390
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:10,307
Never.

391
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,291
You're my daughter.

392
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:15,942
It's fun, isn't it?

393
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,607
It's fun, it's fun.

394
00:28:17,727 --> 00:28:18,880
Dad.

395
00:28:23,523 --> 00:28:24,702
Papa.

396
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,261
I don't know who it will be,

397
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:36,443
But that woman who marries
you will be very happy.

398
00:28:51,581 --> 00:28:53,229
Na Yeong.

399
00:28:55,962 --> 00:28:57,385
Na Yeong.

400
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:03,079
Please come back, I'm begging you.

401
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:05,925
<i>That place was pretty good</i>

402
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,583
<i>Director, I'll buy tomorrow.</i>

403
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:12,000
Na Hwang, are you on a diet?

404
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,853
He isn't eating or drinking at all.

405
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:55,092
<i>It's almost as if you raised our Ha Seon.</i>

406
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:36,218
Are you really walking on your own?

407
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,811
<i>Kwang Hee, your work is so good.</i>

408
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:15,293
<i>You're really funny.
Keep drawing.</i>

409
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:17,332
You have a warm and delicate side.

410
00:31:17,452 --> 00:31:21,027
Don't put on a front.
Just be your usual self.

411
00:31:21,364 --> 00:31:22,768
My usual self?

412
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:24,640
Gentle and friendly.

413
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:12,726
Let's begin the picking up event.

414
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:20,103
The most important thing,
today's purpose is money.

415
00:32:20,223 --> 00:32:23,435
I've been told that a special preparation
for money donator has been made.

416
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:25,251
Han Soo Hyeon

417
00:32:25,371 --> 00:32:27,628
Han Soo Hyeon, where are you?

418
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:31,937
Yes, please come forward.

419
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:34,727
Applause please.

420
00:32:39,255 --> 00:32:42,644
He's very good looking.

421
00:32:42,764 --> 00:32:45,864
Please give us the money.

422
00:32:46,294 --> 00:32:48,672
How much will it be?

423
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,145
The anticipation is heavy.

424
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:53,272
That's it?
It's only 10,000 Won.

425
00:32:53,392 --> 00:32:54,919
Everyone, let's tell him to spend more.

426
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,211
Everyone, "spend some more,
spend some more!"

427
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:02,675
Please spend some more.

428
00:33:03,311 --> 00:33:04,974
Just a moment...

429
00:33:05,094 --> 00:33:07,111
It's coming, it's coming.

430
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:08,665
A lot is coming out!

431
00:33:09,751 --> 00:33:11,810
A total of 50,000 Won, 50,000 Won!

432
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,643
Wait, wait, where are you going?

433
00:33:14,763 --> 00:33:16,609
You can't just leave money and go.

434
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:19,585
For the future of Min Seo!

435
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:21,851
How about one song.

436
00:33:21,971 --> 00:33:25,842
Everyone, do you want to hear a song?

437
00:33:26,141 --> 00:33:29,173
"sing a song, sing a song!"

438
00:33:29,293 --> 00:33:32,581
Yes, I ask you, please.

439
00:33:45,121 --> 00:33:52,158
<i>You were born to be loved.</i>

440
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:59,314
<i>And you’re receiving that
love in your life now.</i>

441
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:06,716
<i>You were born to be loved.</i>

442
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:16,526
<i>And you’re receiving that
love in your life now.</i>

443
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:23,891
<i>God's love that started from
the beginning of time,</i>

444
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:31,565
<i>Produced fruit
through our meeting</i>

445
00:34:31,685 --> 00:34:38,444
<i>Because of your
existence in this world</i>

446
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:45,075
<i>You are a great joy to us.</i>

447
00:34:49,581 --> 00:34:52,015
<i>You...</i>

448
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:56,302
<i>were born to be loved...</i>

449
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:00,684
I'm sorry, I think I'll stop here.

450
00:35:00,804 --> 00:35:03,342
Congratulations on your
baby's first birthday.

451
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:27,485
<i>Have you ever seen a hyena
(famous song: Leopard of Kilimanjaro)</i>

452
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:31,095
<i>hanging around looking for food?</i>

453
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:35,457
<i>I don't want to be a hyena,</i>

454
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:38,003
<i>I wanna be a leopard.</i>

455
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:40,792
<i>I want to be the leopard
of Kilimanjaro.</i>

456
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,008
I'm glad you're here.

457
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:49,498
Can you do something about that friend?

458
00:35:55,931 --> 00:36:00,197
<i>I can't come like a wind then
go like a dew...</i>

459
00:36:00,317 --> 00:36:01,115
Let's go.

460
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,709
Han Soo Hyeon,
what are you doing here?

461
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,980
Sing a song.
Come on, sing.

462
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,563
He's going to sing a song.
Go on.

463
00:36:09,938 --> 00:36:11,613
Why did you drink so much?

464
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:13,223
I don't know.

465
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,339
Na Yeong,

466
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:19,128
Na Yeong is gone.

467
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:22,348
And she took Ha Seon.

468
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,969
It's all my fault.

469
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:26,934
It's all my fault, everyone!

470
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:28,101
It's my fault!

471
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:30,160
- I'm sorry everyone.
- My fault.

472
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,656
My fault.

473
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:43,468
Are the results of the test available?

474
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:45,864
Yes.

475
00:36:55,452 --> 00:36:59,121
Is he the true father?

476
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:00,488
Uh.

477
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:06,008
No.

478
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:08,741
Really?

479
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:12,036
That's strange.

480
00:37:12,156 --> 00:37:15,253
They look the same.

481
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:16,750
What?

482
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,390
They look the same?

483
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:25,536
Yes. The way my son looked when he was
young, and the baby looks exactly the same.

484
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:28,475
That's not possible.

485
00:37:28,595 --> 00:37:31,050
Was there a mistake?

486
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:34,551
Can you do the test again?

487
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:36,854
There's no need.

488
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:41,685
You brought a dog hair.

489
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,179
What?

490
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,950
A dog hair?

491
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:50,692
To be specific, a white maltese whisker.

492
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:54,341
Whisker?

493
00:37:54,461 --> 00:37:55,539
Yes.

494
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,591
A dog whisker.

495
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:13,476
This author is so funny.

496
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:17,879
Where was this kind of skill hiding?

497
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:30,498
Uh oh. I called it garbage.

498
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,886
He won't even see me if I contact him.

499
00:38:36,638 --> 00:38:39,296
<i>Why aren't you uploading a
new comic today?</i>

500
00:38:50,915 --> 00:38:55,015
<i>Something came up, so I may be taking
an extended break.</i>

501
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:58,085
I'm very sorry.

502
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:02,521
Hi Mom.

503
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:05,628
Did you clean the baby's room?

504
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,126
Why?

505
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:10,158
I brought the wrong hair.

506
00:39:10,278 --> 00:39:11,675
What hair.

507
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:14,576
Mom, what are you talking about?

508
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:16,785
I told you, you can't do a paternity test.

509
00:39:16,905 --> 00:39:18,452
Then what are you planning on doing?

510
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:20,542
Don't you care who's baby Ha Seon is?

511
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:22,246
No, I'm not curious at all.

512
00:39:22,366 --> 00:39:25,391
I cleaned Ha Seon's room, there's
not a thread lying around, so mark my words.

513
00:39:27,356 --> 00:39:31,112
I'm going to clean really well so that kind
of talk doesn't resurface again.

514
00:39:33,695 --> 00:39:35,979
What happened?
You two came home together?

515
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:39,030
- Take Kyeong Tae
- Na Yeong.

516
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:41,550
Ha Seon.

517
00:39:45,955 --> 00:39:47,490
Na Yeong.

518
00:39:49,044 --> 00:39:50,523
Ha Seon.

519
00:39:50,643 --> 00:39:53,141
Why did he have to bring it up,
if he was going to be like this?

520
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:55,294
I know what you mean.

521
00:39:55,414 --> 00:39:58,739
I'm going to clean the upstairs room,
so you can sleep there from now on.

522
00:39:59,076 --> 00:40:00,836
- In my own room?
- Yeah.

523
00:40:00,956 --> 00:40:03,221
I don't think Na Yeong is
going to come back.

524
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:06,066
You said you were uncomfortable
sleeping downstairs. Go sleep upstairs.

525
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:10,383
I can't do that.
It's still Na Yeong's room.

526
00:40:10,503 --> 00:40:12,282
You said downstairs was uncomfortable.

527
00:40:12,402 --> 00:40:15,165
I know, but let's leave it for now.

528
00:40:15,285 --> 00:40:16,999
I'm going to go wash up.

529
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:25,017
Not too long ago, you were throwing
a fit about being uncomfortable.

530
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,524
How did we get like this?

531
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:47,324
Woof, woof, this is a puppy.

532
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:48,490
Woof, woof.

533
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:52,734
Hi Ha Seon, I'm a puppy.

534
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:54,818
This is a birdy.

535
00:40:54,938 --> 00:40:58,113
Tweet, tweet, I'm flying.

536
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:00,154
Hi, Ha Seon!

537
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:07,149
And there was a bunny too.

538
00:41:07,528 --> 00:41:09,100
Bunny was...

539
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:15,539
How was I supposed to make a bunny again?

540
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:22,110
<i>- Hi Bunny, let's be friends.
- Hi Puppy, let's eat the Bunny.</i>

541
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:39,294
Ha Seon...

542
00:41:40,511 --> 00:41:42,551
I'm being silly.

543
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:46,412
I'm thinking about your uncles.

544
00:41:50,137 --> 00:41:54,572
Uncles were really nice to us, right?

545
00:41:57,867 --> 00:41:59,683
Ha Seon...

546
00:42:00,864 --> 00:42:04,832
You look exactly like your dad to me.

547
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,074
But you're actually supposed to look
more like one of your uncles.

548
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:14,688
I can't believe it.

549
00:42:15,062 --> 00:42:17,065
It makes no sense.

550
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:25,630
It's broiled eel.
Ha Seon, let's eat.

551
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,146
Yes, Dad.

552
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,161
Ha Seon, the tail is mine.

553
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:37,419
Dad, you bought this fish?

554
00:42:39,047 --> 00:42:41,987
I bought it, with my blood money.

555
00:42:42,107 --> 00:42:44,617
Haven't I earned the tail from that?

556
00:42:44,737 --> 00:42:47,257
Well, that's true but...

557
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:58,932
You should be grateful that I at least
let you eat the body of the fish.

558
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:04,193
No! No way.

559
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:09,721
You can't become cheap because
you take after your dad, okay?

560
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:13,316
What?

561
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,386
Ms. Choi, I can't hear you.
Speak loudly!

562
00:43:16,506 --> 00:43:20,346
Hi Ms. Choi, we can meet later.

563
00:43:20,627 --> 00:43:24,090
Why don't we go to Pagoda park where
there're a lot of good-looking people.

564
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:24,091
<i>{\a6}(Pagoda park is for aged people)</i>

565
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,420
Okay.

566
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:33,956
Dad, where are you going?

567
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:35,940
I'm going to meet Ms. Choi.

568
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,494
Good for you then.

569
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:40,760
Can I come home late
after dating Jun Oppa?

570
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,081
Didn't you say you were
going to meet Min?

571
00:43:43,961 --> 00:43:45,646
Min Oppa is for the morning.

572
00:43:45,766 --> 00:43:48,229
Jun Oppa is for the afternoon.
You know this already Daddy.

573
00:43:48,349 --> 00:43:50,938
Okay, then don't meet
more than three people.

574
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:52,891
No, no way.

575
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:55,941
You can't be a player, no way.

576
00:43:56,221 --> 00:43:58,206
That's even more of a nightmare.

577
00:44:01,156 --> 00:44:02,841
<i>Na Hwang Ha Seon</i>

578
00:44:19,564 --> 00:44:21,717
Be careful Ha Seon.

579
00:44:29,525 --> 00:44:31,659
I lost, Ha Seon.

580
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:33,887
You lost again, Dad.

581
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:41,955
Ha Seon, do you wash your feet?

582
00:44:42,075 --> 00:44:45,667
Dad, there's no time for Korea's
police to wash their feet.

583
00:44:45,787 --> 00:44:47,839
We're busy catching criminals.

584
00:44:47,959 --> 00:44:49,055
No.

585
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:02,722
That's wrong too.
What am I thinking of?

586
00:45:04,182 --> 00:45:06,784
How could I think these
things about you?

587
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,829
I'm sorry, Ha Seon.

588
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:14,924
But Ha Seon, you can't be like
those three people at all, okay?

589
00:45:15,044 --> 00:45:17,927
You have to be just like
your Daddy, okay?

590
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:23,972
Ha Seon.

591
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:30,225
- Ha Seon, Grandpa's back.
- You're back.

592
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:34,211
Ha Seon, did you
have fun today?

593
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,046
I brought some strawberries.

594
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,783
Wash them for Ha Seon.

595
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:40,236
You didn't have to do this.

596
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:43,531
How are you, Grandpa's home.

597
00:45:49,399 --> 00:45:52,376
So you found a place to leave Ha Seon?

598
00:45:52,496 --> 00:45:56,682
There's a space in the day
care down the street.

599
00:45:57,081 --> 00:46:00,394
The facilities are decent,
and the fees are small.

600
00:46:01,162 --> 00:46:02,042
Oh.

601
00:46:03,693 --> 00:46:06,931
All of Ha Seon's things
are in that house.

602
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:09,178
Ha Seon's things?

603
00:46:09,298 --> 00:46:12,154
All of my clothes are there too.
What should I do?

604
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:16,140
But it's not like I can
go there myself.

605
00:46:18,021 --> 00:46:21,340
Really? I'll go tomorrow
and pick up your things.

606
00:46:26,038 --> 00:46:28,135
Na Yeong,
I've been meaning to say.

607
00:46:30,176 --> 00:46:35,668
How about getting a paternity test,
like those fellows' mothers were saying?

608
00:46:36,305 --> 00:46:37,615
Dad.

609
00:46:38,402 --> 00:46:40,180
Not you too.

610
00:46:40,779 --> 00:46:42,643
Think about it.

611
00:46:42,763 --> 00:46:46,181
How long do you think you can
raise Ha Seon on your own for?

612
00:46:46,301 --> 00:46:49,270
It's not too late to find out who
the father is and live together.

613
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,254
What do you mean together?

614
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:54,458
Just because this happened,

615
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:56,859
doesn't mean that one of those three
men can become Ha Seon's father.

616
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,235
Well...

617
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:04,474
I'm not saying that you should marry
the father right away.

618
00:47:04,594 --> 00:47:09,566
I'm just saying that it would be nice
if we knew who the father was.

619
00:47:10,538 --> 00:47:14,114
All three of them seemed like decent men.

620
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:16,772
We could get some child support money.

621
00:47:16,892 --> 00:47:17,989
Dad!

622
00:47:19,043 --> 00:47:22,806
Ha Seon was born between Seong Min
and me, no matter who says what.

623
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,542
If you keep talking about that,
I'm going to take Ha Seon and leave.

624
00:47:27,662 --> 00:47:29,872
Okay, okay.

625
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:32,138
I won't talk about that again.

626
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,428
Have a strawberry,
Grandpa brought it for you.

627
00:47:36,548 --> 00:47:37,651
Have it.

628
00:47:39,111 --> 00:47:42,294
All three seemed like good guys.

629
00:47:42,414 --> 00:47:43,941
Dad!

630
00:48:03,543 --> 00:48:04,984
Hi, Team Leader.

631
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,103
Are you enjoying your vacation?

632
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:12,672
<i>Where are you?
Why is it so noisy?</i>

633
00:48:14,151 --> 00:48:16,510
We're updating the interior of our office.

634
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,176
<i>Interior?</i>

635
00:48:18,513 --> 00:48:21,597
Have you forgotten that the president told
us that our team must take more supports?

636
00:48:21,717 --> 00:48:23,806
Song Na Yeong, Assistant Leader.

637
00:48:23,926 --> 00:48:24,892
What?

638
00:48:25,012 --> 00:48:26,203
What did you say?

639
00:48:26,323 --> 00:48:28,337
<i>We will start getting
more team members,</i>

640
00:48:28,457 --> 00:48:30,976
<i>You can't continue
to be a team member.</i>

641
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:33,999
Na Yeong, please take the role of
Customer Service Assistant Leader

642
00:48:36,245 --> 00:48:37,368
Really?

643
00:48:37,488 --> 00:48:40,644
<i>Once you become Assistant Leader, you'll
get more busy, so enjoy your vacation.</i>

644
00:48:41,823 --> 00:48:43,414
<i>How's Ha Seon?</i>

645
00:48:43,534 --> 00:48:45,698
She's doing well.

646
00:48:45,979 --> 00:48:48,263
It hasn't been long since I've
seen her, but I miss her already.

647
00:48:49,124 --> 00:48:51,726
Ha Seon misses you too.

648
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:52,831
Really?

649
00:48:53,178 --> 00:48:56,417
I meant that I missed you, Na Yeong.

650
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:00,255
<i>Ah, I'm flattered...</i>

651
00:49:01,696 --> 00:49:02,801
<i>Hello?</i>

652
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:04,180
<i>Did you hang up?</i>

653
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,415
No.

654
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:08,561
Don't tease me.

655
00:49:09,066 --> 00:49:13,409
Anyway, Song Assistant Leader. Enjoy
your vacation and I'll see you next week.

656
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:14,750
Yes.

657
00:49:24,387 --> 00:49:27,794
Ha Seon, Mommy got promoted!

658
00:49:28,112 --> 00:49:31,201
Mommy got promoted!
I'm an Assistant Leader!

659
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,177
Doesn't that sound fancy?
Assistant Leader!

660
00:49:45,473 --> 00:49:48,356
Aren't you having lunch,
Detective Na Hwang?

661
00:49:49,105 --> 00:49:50,561
I'll buy you something yummy.

662
00:49:50,662 --> 00:49:52,962
How about spawn stew for
old time's sake? For 8000 won.

663
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:55,581
Go and eat, officer Nam.

664
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,164
But it's 8000 won.

665
00:49:59,282 --> 00:50:00,330
Okay.

666
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:19,441
She was caught in the
act of committing a theft.

667
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:20,943
Okay, go to your business.

668
00:50:26,316 --> 00:50:31,064
On Friday morning at 11am at a
local supermarket, 15 packs of milk...

669
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:37,616
She stole 32,000 won in products.

670
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,831
Why did you steal so much milk, Ahjumma?

671
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:45,294
I have a 3-year-old daughter.

672
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:54,543
My husband got in a car accident
recently and is hospitalized.

673
00:50:56,462 --> 00:50:58,746
I have no more money.

674
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,080
And I can't go out to work in the
restaurant where I used to work.

675
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,364
I'm sorry.

676
00:51:09,835 --> 00:51:10,752
Yes.

677
00:51:15,096 --> 00:51:17,529
She did it for a starving child.

678
00:51:17,649 --> 00:51:19,813
I'm not saying that what
the woman did was right.

679
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:22,958
But how do you think a mother whose
baby was hungry would have felt?

680
00:51:23,078 --> 00:51:25,105
Please forgive her this one time.

681
00:51:25,225 --> 00:51:30,210
I do feel sorry for her, but I have to take
responsibility for my family too.

682
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:33,610
The profit from selling these
things isn't very much.

683
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,650
If I let this person or that person,

684
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:38,051
get away with this kind of thing,
how can I provide for my family?

685
00:51:40,334 --> 00:51:41,757
Okay how about this?

686
00:51:41,877 --> 00:51:47,446
I'll give you 50,000 to compensate you for
your troubles, and we put this behind us.

687
00:51:48,195 --> 00:51:49,738
Well if that's what you want
to do, it's okay with me,

688
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,339
but what about you,
Police Officer?

689
00:51:51,993 --> 00:51:53,828
Oh, then let's do that.

690
00:51:53,948 --> 00:51:55,719
Here you go.

691
00:51:56,355 --> 00:51:58,911
I don't know if this is okay for me to take.

692
00:52:06,922 --> 00:52:08,775
What are you looking at?

693
00:52:08,895 --> 00:52:11,077
The baby is very cute.

694
00:52:11,197 --> 00:52:13,885
I thought you didn't like kids, Soo Hyeon.

695
00:52:14,578 --> 00:52:16,469
Kids are cute and pretty.

696
00:52:16,589 --> 00:52:17,421
Really?

697
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:21,727
I hate kids.
Noisy and crazy.

698
00:52:22,588 --> 00:52:24,385
I was like that too, back in the day.

699
00:52:24,505 --> 00:52:26,854
So you're saying you like them now?

700
00:52:26,974 --> 00:52:27,865
Hm?

701
00:52:28,989 --> 00:52:31,478
I'd like to be clear about this.

702
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:32,966
It's about our future,

703
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,967
so if we feel differently, don't you
think it will strain our marriage?

704
00:52:37,248 --> 00:52:42,134
Oh, no, I don't like kids
very much even now.

705
00:52:43,988 --> 00:52:48,116
I don't want to waste
my life for raising a child.

706
00:52:50,363 --> 00:52:52,160
Aren't you coming?

707
00:52:52,741 --> 00:52:54,257
I'm coming.

708
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,592
Then go on in.

709
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:03,921
I enjoyed lunch.

710
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:07,781
Oh, Soo Hyeon, this is for you.

711
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:10,814
What's this?

712
00:53:10,934 --> 00:53:14,362
I thought it suited you well,
so I bought you a shirt.

713
00:53:14,642 --> 00:53:16,234
Oh, you didn't have to.

714
00:53:16,354 --> 00:53:18,688
It's silk so you have to
take good care of it.

715
00:53:18,789 --> 00:53:21,289
Don't leave your iron
on it like last time.

716
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:24,491
Oh, that won't happen again.

717
00:53:25,184 --> 00:53:26,925
- I'll go now.
- Bye bye.

718
00:53:39,546 --> 00:53:41,249
- Is this everything?
- Yes.

719
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:43,376
If I find anything, I'll give you a call.

720
00:53:43,496 --> 00:53:44,649
Okay.

721
00:53:46,783 --> 00:53:49,161
Please don't call for now.

722
00:53:49,281 --> 00:53:51,463
It's hard for me to answer your calls with
Na Yeong around.

723
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:53,523
Oh, really?

724
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:58,034
Anyway, thank you very much for
taking care of Na Yeong.

725
00:53:58,614 --> 00:54:02,152
Please tell your friends the same.

726
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,594
Yes.

727
00:54:03,714 --> 00:54:05,726
- I'm going
- Go ahead.

728
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:08,890
Oh.

729
00:54:12,184 --> 00:54:15,322
Are Na Yeong and Ha Seon okay?

730
00:54:15,442 --> 00:54:17,643
Of course, they're good.

731
00:54:18,036 --> 00:54:23,407
Na Yeong was really shocked,
so please understand.

732
00:54:23,744 --> 00:54:26,777
After some time has passed,
she should come around.

733
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:29,531
I'm going.

734
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,139
Father.

735
00:54:36,259 --> 00:54:39,190
Can I have at least have the address?

736
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,886
I could get in big trouble
from Na Yeong for that.

737
00:54:42,006 --> 00:54:42,878
I'm going.

738
00:54:42,998 --> 00:54:44,170
Let's go.

739
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,925
Go on in.

740
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:56,105
Thank you so much.

741
00:55:56,225 --> 00:55:58,782
You even gave me food to eat.

742
00:55:59,081 --> 00:56:01,908
No matter how difficult it is,
I shouldn't have stolen.

743
00:56:02,028 --> 00:56:04,042
I don't know what bit me.

744
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,602
Here, this is for you.

745
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,942
What's this?

746
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:11,851
It's for you for your emergency.

747
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:15,163
No, no.

748
00:56:15,283 --> 00:56:17,773
It's not much, please take it.

749
00:56:20,974 --> 00:56:26,403
I even thought of killing
myself and my baby.

750
00:56:26,523 --> 00:56:30,578
Don't think of things like that.
You have to be stronger in these times.

751
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,433
If you ever need more help,
give me a call. Okay?

752
00:56:34,553 --> 00:56:37,746
I'm so thankful,
I don't know what to do.

753
00:56:38,945 --> 00:56:40,817
Go ahead.

754
00:56:40,937 --> 00:56:42,580
Thank you so much.

755
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,339
Bye bye.

756
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:50,292
Ye Lim.

757
00:56:52,514 --> 00:56:55,303
Thank you, bye.

758
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,801
Bye.

759
00:56:56,921 --> 00:56:57,999
Bye.

760
00:57:04,878 --> 00:57:06,993
I wonder how Na Yeong is doing.

761
00:57:08,322 --> 00:57:10,943
I wish I could see Ha Seon just once.

762
00:57:16,071 --> 00:57:19,104
<i>I found out where Na Yeong
is staying. Wanna come?</i>

763
00:57:19,984 --> 00:57:21,089
Gotta go.

764
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,926
Hereafter, if the rate
of interest is fixed,

765
00:57:25,027 --> 00:57:26,527
the bond price will be down,
dollar will be up,

766
00:57:26,646 --> 00:57:29,409
and the stock market will be stable.

767
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,600
Accordingly...

768
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,966
Team Leader!

769
00:57:34,745 --> 00:57:37,144
I have to go to and visit a company.

770
00:57:37,264 --> 00:57:40,607
Can't you wait until the end
of the meeting? It's almost over.

771
00:57:40,727 --> 00:57:43,359
I have to go right now.

772
00:57:43,644 --> 00:57:45,141
I'm sorry.

773
00:57:46,302 --> 00:57:47,481
Mr. Han.

774
00:57:47,601 --> 00:57:48,794
Mr. Han!

775
00:57:50,404 --> 00:57:52,164
- That's the house?
- Yes.

776
00:57:52,725 --> 00:57:55,739
It must be hard for her to go up
and down the stairs with Ha Seon.

777
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:57,780
Hey, look at that railing.

778
00:57:58,204 --> 00:58:00,769
What if Ha Seon were to fall off from there?

779
00:58:01,592 --> 00:58:04,195
Ow, my foot.

780
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:05,542
Here, shoes.

781
00:58:05,662 --> 00:58:07,115
Oh, thanks.

782
00:58:10,731 --> 00:58:12,023
What's this?

783
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,269
Just put them on,
they're from the police station.

784
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:16,272
Why couldn't you buy me a new pair?

785
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:18,257
I didn't have time for that.

786
00:58:41,832 --> 00:58:44,098
Let's go, let's go.
Let's follow her.

787
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,509
Where's she going?

788
00:58:55,629 --> 00:58:58,092
I don't know, but follow her anyway.

789
00:59:13,351 --> 00:59:16,210
I guess she's leaving
Ha Seon at the day care.

790
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,944
What if the day care has a fire?

791
00:59:19,064 --> 00:59:20,947
Watch your mouth.

792
00:59:24,036 --> 00:59:25,489
That bastard!

793
00:59:25,994 --> 00:59:27,978
- Hold it in.
- Did you see the plate?

794
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:29,607
I will catch him right now
as "riding without helmet"

795
00:59:40,173 --> 00:59:41,596
You lower the volume.

796
00:59:41,716 --> 00:59:42,812
Okay.

797
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:48,604
She's gone.

798
00:59:53,734 --> 00:59:56,784
I didn't even get to see
Ha Seon's face, thanks to you.

799
00:59:56,904 --> 00:59:58,038
Seriously!

800
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:02,606
At least we found out where she was.

801
01:00:02,726 --> 01:00:05,684
Now we can see her everyday.

802
01:00:35,714 --> 01:00:36,875
How's Ha Seon?

803
01:00:37,774 --> 01:00:40,207
She's doing gonji gonji.
(baby's finger play)

804
01:00:40,327 --> 01:00:42,042
What? gonji gonji?

805
01:00:42,162 --> 01:00:43,689
Send me her picture.

806
01:00:44,064 --> 01:00:45,112
Okay.

807
01:00:49,843 --> 01:00:52,857
What's this? I can only see her feet.

808
01:00:52,977 --> 01:00:54,415
Hey, I had to risk my life
to take this picture.

809
01:00:54,516 --> 01:00:55,816
This is no good.

810
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,832
Let's take this opportunity for
each of us to buy a good cell phone.

811
01:00:57,933 --> 01:00:59,433
One that does video.

812
01:00:59,552 --> 01:01:02,259
Do you know how expensive
a video cell phone is?

813
01:01:02,379 --> 01:01:03,779
I have no money, it's dog whiskers.

814
01:01:03,899 --> 01:01:06,700
- I'll help you pay for it.
- Me too.

815
01:01:17,948 --> 01:01:20,419
Ha Seon is good at Jjak Jjak Goong.

816
01:01:21,805 --> 01:01:24,931
Na Yeong's wearing the
outfit that I bought for her.

817
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:27,140
What?

818
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:29,010
Nothing.

819
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,126
An expensive cell phone
makes a difference.

820
01:01:42,246 --> 01:01:44,654
I don't feel like I
wasted money at all.

821
01:01:55,229 --> 01:01:57,813
Here are all the shoes
that we bought for her.

822
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:04,132
Hey, hey, show me the running
shoes that I bought for her.

823
01:02:08,981 --> 01:02:11,152
It looks like she's never
worn my running shoes.

824
01:02:11,272 --> 01:02:13,231
It's brand new.

825
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:16,057
Don't be so sad about it.

826
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:20,344
Kwang Hee, behind you.

827
01:02:20,794 --> 01:02:21,840
Behind you!

828
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,656
Behind me? What?

829
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:27,925
What are you doing here?

830
01:02:30,377 --> 01:02:32,790
I was just on the
phone with Kyeong Tae.

831
01:02:36,328 --> 01:02:37,938
Hello, Na Yeong.

832
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:39,698
Ha Seon, how have you been?

833
01:02:43,629 --> 01:02:45,632
How did you know to come here?

834
01:02:48,065 --> 01:02:48,964
Uh.

835
01:02:49,084 --> 01:02:50,761
Did my father tell you?

836
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:51,978
No.

837
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:57,871
I followed him.

838
01:02:58,994 --> 01:03:01,109
Please leave.

839
01:03:01,229 --> 01:03:03,487
I have nothing to say to the three of you.

840
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:06,426
Na Yeong.

841
01:03:06,546 --> 01:03:08,242
Please don't even come here again.

842
01:03:09,003 --> 01:03:12,860
If you keep coming, then I'm going to
run away to a place that no one knows.

843
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,919
We were just worried about Ha Seon.

844
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,083
Don't worry about Ha Seon.
I'll take care of her.

845
01:03:19,483 --> 01:03:22,928
I'll say this again, but I hope that
we won't run into each other again.

846
01:03:23,048 --> 01:03:25,603
Please don't appear in
Ha Seon's presence again.

847
01:03:49,065 --> 01:03:51,162
Kwang Hee, I'm sorry.

848
01:03:53,682 --> 01:03:56,209
But there's nothing I can do.

849
01:03:57,426 --> 01:04:00,347
This is the only way the
three of you will move on.

850
01:04:05,987 --> 01:04:10,705
Ha Seon, were you happy
to see Uncle Kwang Hee?

851
01:04:13,306 --> 01:04:18,024
All that time, you grew quite
fond of your uncles, didn't you?

852
01:04:20,851 --> 01:04:22,948
Anyway, we can't anymore.

853
01:04:23,936 --> 01:04:26,370
We can't see them anymore.

854
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:29,908
I'm sorry, Ha Seon.

855
01:04:32,248 --> 01:04:34,270
Sorry, Ha Seon.

856
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:46,569
Anyway, Na Yeong seemed
to be very angry.

857
01:04:47,019 --> 01:04:50,313
We might never see Ha Seon again.

858
01:04:51,585 --> 01:04:53,888
What can we do to
soothe her anger?

859
01:04:58,485 --> 01:04:59,720
Anybody home?

860
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,386
It's officer Na Hwang.

861
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,037
Did they go somewhere?

862
01:05:05,157 --> 01:05:06,516
Are you home?

863
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:07,995
Ahjumma?

864
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:13,060
I bought some milk and snacks.
I'm the officer.

865
01:05:17,796 --> 01:05:19,163
Are you home?

866
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:22,481
Ahjumma?

867
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:25,982
Ahjumma.

868
01:05:28,284 --> 01:05:30,081
Are you home?

869
01:05:36,339 --> 01:05:38,829
What is this?

870
01:05:50,433 --> 01:05:51,500
Mom!

871
01:06:05,798 --> 01:06:09,179
