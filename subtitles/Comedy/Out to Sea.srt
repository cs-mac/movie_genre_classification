00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,225
<i>Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna.</i>

2
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,566
<i>Hare Krishna.
Hare Krishna.</i>

3
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:42,438
Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna.
Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna.

4
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,945
<i>Just a quarter mile left,
Hare Krishna is still clear.</i>

5
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:50,449
<i>- Turning for home, Hare Krishna the one to catch.
- Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna.</i>

6
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,111
Hare Krishna!
Come on!

7
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,280
<i>- Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna.
- Hare Krishna's getting weary.</i>

8
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,086
Keep it together.
Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna.

9
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,617
<i>- A three-way photo finish coming up to
the wire. - Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna.</i>

10
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,357
Hare... No!

11
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,890
<i>And a heartbreaking loss for Hare Krishna.!</i>

12
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,912
Give me a 1-5-6,
a 1-5-7 and give me...

13
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,479
Give me a break, will you?
You can't bet every horse in the race.

14
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,752
<i>- It's cheating.
The horses are inside the gate.</i>

15
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,420
- We're gonna get shut out here.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:13,262
Got a sure winner. Ten dollars
across the board on number two.

17
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,633
At 70 to 1? Charlie!
Where's the money?

18
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,537
If I had the money,
would I be betting long shots?

19
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,804
Please, Edie, cover for me
this one time.

20
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,040
<i>- The flag is up.
- Okay, Charlie. You're down.</i>

21
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,638
<i>- Thank you, sweetheart.
I love you very much.</i>

22
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:33,015
<i>Away they go.!</i>

23
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,350
<i>Pretty good start for all.</i>

24
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:39,824
<i>The only one slow is High Button Shoes,
and High Button Shoes is last early on.</i>

25
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:44,057
<i>Swinging onto the back stretch, and it's
Last Chance and Coates Tail setting the pace.</i>

26
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,429
<i>Now High Button Shoes
does begin to pick it up.</i>

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,334
<i>High Button Shoes nowjoins the pack
as they swing onto the back stretch.</i>

28
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,066
<i>- It's still Punjab and Out of Time the leaders.
- High Button Shoes.</i>

29
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,973
<i>Coates Tail is racing on the outside
curve, and then Last Chance.</i>

30
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,568
<i>High Button Shoes.
High Button Shoes.</i>

31
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,773
<i>High Button Shoes
picks up good ground.</i>

32
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,408
<i>- High Button Shoes coming into contention.
- High Button Shoes!</i>

33
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:08,352
<i>High Button Shoes.!
High Button Shoes.!</i>

34
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,946
Come on, you schmuck!
Move!

35
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,754
<i>You got it, kid.!
You got it.!</i>

36
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:17,023
<i>That's the way to do it.!
High Button Shoes.!</i>

37
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,564
<i>High Button Shoes.!</i>

38
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,294
<i>- You got it, baby!
- High Button Shoes has won.!</i>

39
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:26,304
<i>High Button Shoes,
a major upset.</i>

40
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,363
- I love you.
- Love you too.

41
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,001
See you later, sweetheart.

42
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,103
Hi. How you doin'?

43
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,206
Looks like you're having a big day, huh?

44
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,877
Mickey, my favorite bookie.
How's business?

45
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,116
I'll tell you, Charlie.
I'm in a tough racket, you know?

46
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,556
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Well, I gotta see somebo...

47
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,527
Sometimes I get
this terrible feeling...

48
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,622
like people are trying
to avoid me.

49
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,133
Yeah? Gee, that's too bad.

50
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:59,194
- Maybe you should see someone about that.
- I am seeing someone.

51
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,604
- Who?
- Where's my money, Charlie?

52
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,869
Money? Come on.
I'm broke, Mickey.

53
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,434
You'd be the first to know
when I get money.

54
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,504
Oh, my goodness.
Where did this come from? L...

55
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:14,281
I tell you what. I'll give you $500,
and we call it even.

56
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,652
I'll tell you what.

57
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,181
I'll take a grand,
and you still owe me three grand.

58
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,824
Three thousand.

59
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,908
Always and forever, kiddo.

60
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,427
Did you come
to borrow money?

61
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,493
Let me just say...

62
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,844
Why do you assume the only reason
I come here is to borrow money?

63
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,012
<i>Because every time you come here,
you borrow money.</i>

64
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,421
Herbie, I'm gonna tell you something
you're not gonna believe.

65
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,756
<i>- I never believe anything that you tell me.
- Ho, ho, ho.</i>

66
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,127
- Very funny.
- No. It's very sad.

67
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,031
<i>Not as sad as a man having dinner
with a photograph.</i>

68
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,630
Hey, come on. I'm celebrating.
It's my 45th wedding anniversary.

69
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,234
Very touching...

70
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,610
except today
isn't your anniversary.

71
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,241
- Look, Suzie was my wife.
- Yes, I realize that.

72
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,309
- I should know my own...
- And she was my sister. I was your best man.

73
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,083
- March 15, 1952.
- Yes. Correct.

74
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,648
Except today is the 16th.

75
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,490
- What? That's impossible.
- Why? That's the way it works.

76
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,497
First you get the 15th,
then right after that is the 16th.

77
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,932
And then later on
comes the 17 th. Here.

78
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,493
Take a look at the date.

79
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,433
Sixteenth...

80
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,672
God, I've blown
my own anniversary.

81
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,149
Sorry, kiddo.

82
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,246
Here.

83
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,883
What the hell?
Hey, if you need clothes...

84
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,553
the Salvation Army's
over on Fourth Street.

85
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,291
- These will be perfect.
- Huh? Perfect for what?

86
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,299
Listen, will you
do me a favor?

87
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,029
I worked in a department store
for half of my life.

88
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,867
If you don't buy something,
you put it back.

89
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,602
Herbie...
happy anniversary.

90
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,076
- That was yesterday.
- Go ahead, open it.

91
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,248
"Mexico and the Yucatán.

92
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,448
"Witness the spectacle
of a rare solar eclipse...

93
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,356
from the foot of the Mayan pyramids. "
This is a cruise.

94
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,122
That's right.
Deluxe accommodations.

95
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,391
All right,
where'd you get these?

96
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,925
Do you remember a guy named No-Neck?
They finally busted him.

97
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,664
He gave me the tickets
in lieu of the cash he owed me.

98
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,832
<i>Now, wait a minute.
Somebody owed you money?</i>

99
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,775
How dumb
do you think I am?

100
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,747
What are you gonna do? Stay cooped up
in this mausoleum you call home?

101
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,216
- You're still alive. Hasn't anybody told you?
- Look who's talkin'.

102
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,685
You're damn right,
look who's talking!

103
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:12,212
- Don't you get tired of being alone?
- No. The answer's no.

104
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,455
- Herbie, there's gonna be gourmet food, free drinks,
- No. No.

105
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,463
A bevy of pretty broads.

106
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,295
- Sure, because you're looking for a meaningful relationship.
- Why not?

107
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,302
- You've never had one in your whole life.
- I got news for you.

108
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,136
My whole life isn't over yet, which is
why I suggest we get on that ship...

109
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:33,167
and sip champagne
with some lonely, rich broads.

110
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:38,411
Who knows? We may get lucky
during the eclipse.

111
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,419
Charlie, hear me.

112
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,853
The answer is no.

113
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,584
<i>Hold it.! Hold it.!
Coming through.!</i>

114
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,253
Two customers.

115
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,262
Made it just in time, huh?

116
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,026
Herbie, come this way.

117
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,125
- It's the wrong section.
- It looks like our seats.

118
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,136
Yeah, those are
first-class seats.

119
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,434
What's the matter?
We're not first class?

120
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,371
But our boarding things
here say...

121
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,205
I don't care what the boarding things
say. Will you sit down.

122
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,941
- Yeah, but these could belong to somebody else.
- Relax, will ya?

123
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,949
I mean, the doors are closed.

124
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,646
It's not like we're gonna be stopping
on 34th Street to pick up passengers.

125
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,211
- Okay, Charlie.
- Gentlemen?

126
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,281
- Thank you.
- Ah, thank you.

127
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,349
Thank you very much.

128
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,963
- Sir?
- I may become a frequent flyer.

129
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,966
Damn good mimosa.

130
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,968
Here's to good living, kid.

131
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,971
Okay, okay.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

132
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,906
<i>Okay, now.
Thank you very much.</i>

133
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,411
Okay, now begins the first leg
of our honeymoon.

134
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,412
<i>It's only a year late.</i>

135
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,416
Mmm, I'd like to make a small bet
on where they're gonna be sitting.

136
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,418
<i>There's Mom. Say hi, Mom.</i>

137
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,647
Stop it, will you, Allan?

138
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,748
And my beautiful bride.

139
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,316
Let me see here.

140
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,659
Excuse me.
I believe you're sitting in our seats.

141
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,568
Yeah, that figures.

142
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,607
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right. I'm sorry. See what you do?

143
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,542
- May I see your boarding passes, please?
- Actually, it's my fault.

144
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,604
The doctor here thought it would
be best if I were not subjected...

145
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,172
to the stress
of economy class.

146
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,051
<i>37-H and J. You gentlemen
will have to pay for these drinks.</i>

147
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,056
Maybe Blue Cross
could cover it.

148
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,957
That's...

149
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,019
That's very funny, ma'am.
Very witty.

150
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,539
Hey.

151
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:45,338
Aren't those the seats they use
for transporting convicted felons?

152
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,402
Herbie, sit down.

153
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,778
You're scaring the kids.

154
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,750
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, in a few minutes...</i>

155
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,558
<i>we'll begin our nonstop express service
to Miami, Florida.</i>

156
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,895
<i>- Our flight time will be
approximately five hours.</i>

157
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,075
<i>Welcome aboard
the beautiful M.S. Westerdam.</i>

158
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:23,275
<i>- Your cabin stewards are happy to meet any special needs.
- Ooh.</i>

159
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,580
<i>- So do not hesitate to ask for their assistance.
- Boy, oh, boy.</i>

160
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:31,089
<i>And please note, there will be a compulsory
lifeboat drill today at 5:30 p. m.</i>

161
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,318
<i>Oh, Mr. Leu.
Back again.</i>

162
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,986
<i>Nice to see you
and the lovely Mrs...</i>

163
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,395
Oh, no. It's someone else,
isn't it? Hello!

164
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,696
<i>I'd like you to meet
my dance hosts... Mac...</i>

165
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,702
<i>- Jonathan.
- Come on!</i>

166
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,568
<i>Please report
to the purser's desk. Mr. Dunbar...</i>

167
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,132
Herbie, listen to me. I wanted
to tell you something before you...

168
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,872
<i>- Herbie...
- Oh, wow.!</i>

169
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,315
I tell you something, Charlie.

170
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,546
When they say "deluxe accommodations,"
they mean deluxe.

171
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,918
Yeah, well, Herbie, "deluxe"
can mean several different things.

172
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,584
For example, in a diner, deluxe means
"comes with french fries. "

173
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,653
<i>- Come on.
- This is it. Oh, Ma!</i>

174
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,963
This is gorgeous!
What a suite. Oh!

175
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,730
<i>- Hi.!
- Hello, ladies.</i>

176
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,772
I want those small pieces in the bedroom.
Who the hell are you?

177
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,774
- Lizzy!
- What, Ma?

178
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,243
Get a load of slouchy here.
What, does he come with the stateroom?

179
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,974
Ma! Where's your hospitality?

180
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:33,382
Now, listen!
I have been on a plane for three hours.

181
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,250
I have been in a taxi cab
for an hour and a half.

182
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,691
I need to take a crap and a nap,
and I do not need an audience.

183
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,628
- Sounds like a party we can miss.
- We'll see you later, ladies.

184
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,927
Bye now.

185
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:50,025
<i>Oh, boy. Did you see the chassis
on that broad?</i>

186
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,696
I'll bet she's worth
a few mil.

187
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,139
This must be wrong. I mean,
why would they have us way down here?

188
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,542
I like it down here. Gives us a chance
to get away from the commotion up top.

189
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,446
What, like the other
passengers and the view? This is us.

190
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,349
Listen to me. I've been meaning
to tell you something.

191
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:09,945
Before you go into the room,
Herbie, please listen to me.

192
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,597
- Cozy, isn't it?
- It's what? Cozy?

193
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,069
A good fart will
give you a concussion.

194
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,629
Needs a little daylight.

195
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:46,720
Herb, this is the best possible thing
that could've happened.

196
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,886
Gee, I can't wait
to hear why.

197
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,294
- As dance hosts, it's actually our job...
- What?

198
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,492
- To flirt with all the classy broads.
- Our job? Dance hosts?

199
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,435
Yeah, that's how I was able
to afford the tickets.

200
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,099
Instead of paying for the cruise,
I signed us up as dance hosts.

201
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,166
- So the cruise is free.
- What do you mean it's free, you idiot?

202
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:09,010
- We're workin' here!
- We're not workin'. We're dancing and cavorting.

203
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,675
Oh, you moron. You don't even
know how to dance.

204
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,082
Well, that's why
I brought you here.

205
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,554
Oh. Perhaps we're interrupting
you gentlemen at a bad time.

206
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,958
Welcome aboard.
We're gonna be sharing the bathroom.

207
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,361
This is Jonathan Deveraux.
I'm Mac Vela, U.S.M.C., retired.

208
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,128
- I'll be your liaison to the C.D.
- The what "D"?

209
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,192
Cruise director.
Gil Godwyn.

210
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,831
<i>Oh, it's too bad you got Gil
for your first gig.</i>

211
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,137
- He's a real prick.
- Control freak.

212
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,200
- Friggin' Nazi.
- Classic megalomaniac.

213
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,439
Not a nice man.

214
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,414
Well, if you have
any questions, feel free.

215
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:48,977
I got one question.
What's the fastest route off this ship?

216
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,416
Excuse me.

217
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,611
- Hiya.
- Hello.

218
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,716
- Okay, Chief. Let's pull the gangway in.
- Take in the gangway, Captain.

219
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:33,026
<i>All visitors should
now be ashore. Last call, please.</i>

220
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,158
<i>All visitors
should now be ashore.</i>

221
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,203
Pardon me!

222
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,101
Ohh!

223
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:45,109
Oh, my God.
Sir, are you okay?

224
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,668
<i>- Yeah, I think.
- There you go. You sure?</i>

225
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,941
Thank you. Yeah.

226
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,347
- God, that's embarrassing.
- Only for you.

227
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:56,444
- Oh, my God!
- What?

228
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,717
<i>The ship's moving.</i>

229
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,918
- Ships are known to do that.
- Wait a minute! I need that gangplank!

230
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:05,760
<i>Please.! Hello.! Somebody.!
I gotta use that sucker.!</i>

231
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,061
<i>L... I've gotta...
Hello.!</i>

232
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,761
Where the hell did they go with my luggage?

233
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:15,136
Oh, God Almighty. Thank you very much.
What's the matter with you?

234
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:18,005
- You got a problem?
- Not really.

235
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:22,479
L- I always cry at sailings.
They're so romantic.

236
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,483
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

237
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,485
Mm-hmm.

238
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:45,498
<i>Pleasejoin
your cruise staffby the Lido Pool...</i>

239
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:49,905
<i>on the upper promenade deck aft
for the gala sail-away fiesta.</i>

240
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,967
<i>Meet your cruise director and enjoy
the music and drinks and prizes.</i>

241
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,309
Herbie.

242
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,645
Herbie, I know you're upset now,
but in a few days...

243
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,651
<i>you'll be thanking me.</i>

244
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,813
Listen, Charlie.
What is in this for you?

245
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:08,189
Now, tell me, and no shit
because I'm too tired.

246
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,856
Okay, fine. You remember my old pal
Tony? Tony.

247
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,865
- Anthony Caldoni?
- Yeah.

248
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,867
The mail fraud guy.

249
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,563
First of all,
those charges were dropped.

250
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,129
But more importantly,
guess what he's doing today?

251
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,141
I don't give a rat's ass.

252
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,576
He's married to one
of the richest broads in Palm Beach.

253
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:31,377
And guess how they met?
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

254
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,941
- One, two...
- No way, Jose.

255
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,386
Just wake me up at the first port of call.
That's where I'm gettin' off.

256
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,118
- I hate to see you do this, Herbie.
- Why is that, Charles?

257
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:43,457
Because if you don't dance,
you lose your employee status...

258
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:47,225
and that means you gotta pay for the
whole cruise... that's 2,500 smackaroonies.

259
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:51,235
You son of a bitch! You're the one
who should be paying.

260
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,500
<i>Will the dance hosts
please report to the main ballroom.</i>

261
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,633
<i>Herbie, they're playing our song.</i>

262
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:27,132
<i>Ahem.!</i>

263
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:29,139
Very nice hair.

264
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:32,836
Right.
Nails. Cut 'em. Uh!

265
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,209
<i>Let me. Thank you.</i>

266
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,444
Excellent, Mac.
Jonathan, clip the ear hair.

267
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,010
- I beg your pardon?
- Ear hair!

268
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,822
I'm very skeptical of dance hosts
who can't keep time.

269
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,261
- Mister...
- Me? Sullivan, Herb.

270
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,323
- Uh, and that's Gordon, Charles.
- Lovely.

271
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,064
Sorry we were late, but,
uh, it's a very big boat.

272
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:04,074
<i>This boat... happens to be
the flagship vessel...</i>

273
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:08,135
of the world's premiere cruise line,
and I am the cruise director.

274
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,238
Sir, yes, sir!

275
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,783
I've a feeling you two
are going to be trouble.

276
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:16,582
- Oh...
- No. We're pussycats.

277
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,748
For your sake,
I hope...

278
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,686
Is that cologne
or Armor All?

279
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,632
That's close, close. It's cologne,
but I bought it at a gas station.

280
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,431
I've got my eye on you.

281
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,734
You're not so bad yourself.

282
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,901
<i>All right.</i>

283
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,571
Gentlemen, we're
30 seconds from intros.

284
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:45,412
Now, remember that you
are the representatives of this ship...

285
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,580
and will, at all times, behave
in a manner appropriate thereto.

286
00:19:49,654 --> 00:19:54,421
<i>You will be courteous
and respectful at all times.</i>

287
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:59,021
When the music stops, you will
escort your partner back to her seat.

288
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:03,329
<i>And above all, you will not
fraternize privately...</i>

289
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,393
with the guests
at any time.

290
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,462
- Uh, no.
- If you do, it's grounds for immediate dismissal.

291
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,440
Permission to speak, sir.

292
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,307
Denied. Mac, mike.

293
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,708
- Who's Mac Mike?
- I don't know.

294
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,316
<i>Ohh, yes!</i>

295
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,727
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the M. S. Westerdam proudly presents...</i>

296
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,857
<i>your cruise director...</i>

297
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,867
the very talented...

298
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,336
Mr. Gil Godwyn!

299
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,339
Thank you!

300
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,501
Can't believe it. The man
actually opens for himself.

301
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:50,480
Thank you so very much.
Aren't they absolutely marvelous?

302
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,244
Thank you. Thank you.

303
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,512
- Very good. Very good.
- Thank you.

304
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,577
- Very good. Very good.
- Magnificent.

305
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,850
Moving experience.

306
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,721
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

307
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,782
You're too kind, really.
Thank you, girls.

308
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,853
What could his parents
have possibly done to him?

309
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,991
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce our dance hosts.

310
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,127
Here they are... Mac,

311
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:49,105
<i>Jonathan, Phil...</i>

312
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,075
- How do you like him?
- Oh, he's too short.

313
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:54,634
Julio...

314
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,614
<i>- Bobby, Scott,
- Me! Me!</i>

315
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:00,412
<i>Herb and Ch... Ch...</i>

316
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,419
Ch... Charlie!
Charlie!

317
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,478
<i>Hey, Charlie.</i>

318
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,918
Charlie.

319
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,485
- That guy Herb is cute, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

320
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,238
Well, let's get 'em while they're hot.

321
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,250
Just an expression.

322
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,616
Let's go.

323
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,454
It's just like
the beach at Normandy.

324
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,864
Gentlemen, I didn't hire you
to be wallflowers.

325
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:53,132
I don't want anyone on my ship
ever to feel ignored.

326
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:56,196
Mrs. Carruthers, may I
have the great pleasure?

327
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,175
Ah. Oh.

328
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,109
Kiss-ass.

329
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,979
Take it, fellas!

330
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,288
- I'm Mac. Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, Mac.

331
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:22,526
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Where do you think you're going?

332
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:27,038
Oh, taking on a lot of water
in the forward compartment, sir.

333
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,835
Oh, God.
You have two minutes.

334
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,672
Go.

335
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,915
- Any time you're ready, Herb.
- Huh?

336
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:45,582
Silly old me. I do expect my dance hosts
to actually dance.

337
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:49,525
Well, of course, yeah. It's just that
I don't know if I'm up to...

338
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,528
I'll tell you the truth, Gil.

339
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,588
- I lost my wife not too long ago.
- Oh, good. Good.

340
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,600
Tell it to the ladies.
They eat it up.

341
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,796
Um, do I take a number
or, uh...

342
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,704
may I serve myself?

343
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,265
Yeah. Well, I'm
kind of new at this.

344
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,176
Well, you can dance,
can't you?

345
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:14,581
Ohh!

346
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,019
Oh, you can dance.

347
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,064
<i>Ohh!</i>

348
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,403
Oh, I sure hope
these pins hold.

349
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,409
- What pins?
- Oh, nothing serious.

350
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:43,004
They just keep my legs
attached to my hips.

351
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,072
Da-da

352
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:43,469
- Have you ever seen so much food in your life?
- Spectacular!

353
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,169
I was a size four
when I got on this ship.

354
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,940
Excuse me for butting in, but don't I
know you from someplace?

355
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:51,140
- W-Well, I don't know...
- Pardon me.

356
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:55,409
Uh...

357
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,591
That's a good smoke.

358
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,999
Sometimes.

359
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:51,603
<i>Whoo-hoo.!</i>

360
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,873
- I like it.
- Bravo.

361
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,708
Oh, thank you very much.
Is there a seat open there?

362
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,719
- Oh, yes, of course.
- Well, sure.

363
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:06,223
- Pull up a chair.
- Here we go.

364
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:10,125
- Looks like it's your lucky night, kid.
- It is that. It is.

365
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,686
Luck had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

366
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,927
She played that hand splendidly.
Absolutely splendidly.

367
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,061
- Why, thank you.
- That's okay. You can drop the accent now.

368
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,936
You want a refill
on this, kid?

369
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:25,134
<i>- Your glass was empty.
- Oh, thanks.</i>

370
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,111
Name's Charlie Gordon.
I'm single and I'm lookin'.

371
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,808
Liz LaBreche. I'm single and I ain't
lookin', but thanks for the drink.

372
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,317
- Cheers.
- You're welcome.

373
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:38,287
- They call me Gordo on the street.
- What street is that, Gordo?

374
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,586
Wall Street.
You ever hear of it?

375
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,491
What exactly do you do
on Wall Street?

376
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,052
Well, I have a small
hot dog stand.

377
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,189
When things go badly
over there...

378
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,962
I'm in the mergers
and acquisitions game.

379
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:52,969
The buy-in's $1,000.

380
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:56,939
A thousand dollars. That reminds me
of my first year of college.

381
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,171
Where exactly did you
go to college, Gordo?

382
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,736
Oh, that's a little place
called F.U.

383
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,249
- Your name, sir, is...
- Carswell.

384
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,912
Now, boys, boys, boys.
Let's not have a pissin' match here.

385
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,922
We're here to play cards.
Let's play.

386
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,356
Yes, we're here
to play poker...

387
00:28:14,425 --> 00:28:18,657
if you can raise
the thousand dollars.

388
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,530
Oh, a thousand dollars. May I have
that deck for a minute, please?

389
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,262
<i>I'll give it right back to you.
I just want to take a look.</i>

390
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,772
I'll bet you $5,000
even money...

391
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,774
top card's a picture.

392
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,140
- Even money?
- Yes, sir.

393
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,873
<i>- You've got yourself a bet.
- Okay.</i>

394
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,938
Turn it over.

395
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,013
You owe me $5,000.

396
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,319
That was a lot of fun.

397
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:51,226
<i>I'll tell you what...
let's go again for 10, huh?</i>

398
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,992
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

399
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,159
<i>If you want to quit right now, it's okay
with me. I'll give you the five grand.</i>

400
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,294
Let's make it 20.

401
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:03,033
Yes. Yes. I like that.
Now we're having some fun.

402
00:29:03,107 --> 00:29:05,735
Twenty?

403
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,940
<i>You want to bet $20,000
the top card is not a picture?</i>

404
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,141
You've got a deal.

405
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:16,550
Okay, boy.
$20,000. Turn it over.

406
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:21,558
<i>Turn it over, please.</i>

407
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,766
Whew.

408
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:33,362
That's very interesting.

409
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,168
Oh, boy, is that interesting.

410
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,174
You want to
double it again?

411
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,074
Yes.

412
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:46,105
Enough of this child's play.
I owe you $15,000.

413
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,118
- All right.
- Let's play poker.

414
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,746
Okay. Here we go.

415
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,256
<i>That's a lot of fun.</i>

416
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:58,984
- I'm gonna get a brownie.
- A brownie? Yeah.

417
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:04,233
- L...
- Oh. Sorry.

418
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,465
<i>We shall have to call the Guinness Book
of Records about your friend Charlie.</i>

419
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:09,472
Now what?

420
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,670
- He's taking the longest piss in recorded freaking history.
- Oh.

421
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:17,943
There's a lady at table 16 who's arrived
late. I suggest you welcome her.

422
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,109
Okay. Where's table 16?

423
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:22,118
Over there.

424
00:30:22,186 --> 00:30:24,468
Oh, what a lovely room.

425
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,831
- Oh, that, uh... that... lady.
- Mm-hmm.

426
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,774
Hi there. Excuse me.

427
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:41,010
- Hello.
- Nice to see you're still on board.

428
00:30:41,085 --> 00:30:44,077
Thank you. I just wondered
if you'd care to dance.

429
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:48,922
Actually, I've seen you move. How do I
know you won't trip and drag me overboard?

430
00:30:48,993 --> 00:30:51,553
Well, you don't.

431
00:30:51,629 --> 00:30:54,564
<i>But I swim even better
than I dance.</i>

432
00:30:54,632 --> 00:30:57,192
- Go for it, Mom.
- I promise I won't bite.

433
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:02,666
Here goes nothing.

434
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:14,474
I haven't danced
in a long time.

435
00:31:14,552 --> 00:31:22,885
Slow, slow,
quick-quick.

436
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,123
Don't look down.
Look at me. That's it.

437
00:31:26,197 --> 00:31:29,530
Honey, tell me I did the right thing
by bringing Mom along.

438
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,036
You did the right thing.

439
00:31:33,104 --> 00:31:37,438
Mmm. Now let's go sneak inside
one of those lifeboats.

440
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:42,969
You and whoever
you used to dance with...

441
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:45,106
you must have been
great together.

442
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:48,015
Now promenade.
Yeah, that would be Suzie and me.

443
00:31:48,085 --> 00:31:50,212
We danced all night long
at our wedding...

444
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:53,279
and it seems like we never
stopped dancing for 46 years.

445
00:31:53,357 --> 00:31:56,690
- What a lovely image.
- Oh, thank you.

446
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:59,252
Now tell me all about you.
Everything.

447
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,321
- Everything?
- Sure.

448
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:05,699
<i>- It's only a 10-day cruise. - Well,
give me the Reader's Digest version.</i>

449
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:09,306
Okay.

450
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:11,341
- I live in New York.
- Yeah.

451
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:14,970
- I was a book editor at Doubleday.
- Ooh.

452
00:32:15,045 --> 00:32:17,570
- Mother of two.
- Mm-hmm.

453
00:32:17,648 --> 00:32:20,139
Recent widow of one.

454
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:24,745
And I was... I was shanghaied here
by... by newlyweds.

455
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:26,756
- Oh.
- Mmm.

456
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:29,952
- The bride is my daughter.
- Oh, well, I'm sure that she meant well.

457
00:32:30,027 --> 00:32:32,860
- I'm sure.
- Are you having any fun?

458
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:37,424
- I don't know yet.
- Well, whad'ya know.

459
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,656
Thank you.

460
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:05,456
<i>Thank you.</i>

461
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:11,129
That was, uh, fun.

462
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:13,670
- Yeah.
- Doctor...

463
00:33:13,737 --> 00:33:17,173
- Oh, uh, Sullivan. Call me Herb.
- Vivian.

464
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:21,075
<i>I could use a little fresh air.</i>

465
00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:23,670
- Join me?
- Ye... Oh.

466
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:25,874
- Well, I'd love to.
- I promise I won't bite.

467
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,410
You know something? I'm gonna go along
with you in case you change your mind.

468
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:33,855
<i>Are you getting
enough zeroes in there?</i>

469
00:33:40,498 --> 00:33:43,331
- Eighteen thousand.
- Thank you.

470
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:49,065
Enjoying the company
of a stunning lady...

471
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:53,075
is all I wish to take away
from this table, sir.

472
00:33:53,143 --> 00:33:56,044
<i>Mere confetti.</i>

473
00:33:56,113 --> 00:33:59,776
<i>Confetti, sir.</i>

474
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,718
- Excuse me.
- Very, very nice.

475
00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:10,291
I once heard that if a whale
loses its mate...

476
00:34:10,361 --> 00:34:12,852
it never takes another.

477
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:16,730
Do you suppose that could really happen?

478
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,031
I haven't spoken
to a lot of whales lately, but...

479
00:34:20,104 --> 00:34:23,665
hell, if it was perfect
the first time, then...

480
00:34:23,741 --> 00:34:27,040
My feelings...
My feelings exactly.

481
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:29,477
<i>Ooh.</i>

482
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:31,879
<i>Better not fall
on our heads.</i>

483
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:35,248
What, this? Oh, no, that's
50-gauge cable.

484
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:39,016
Hell, that could hold a couple
of elephants playing patty-cake.

485
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:41,922
Either you know your elephants
or you know your cable.

486
00:34:41,992 --> 00:34:44,358
I was a swabbie.
Pacific area.

487
00:34:44,428 --> 00:34:46,487
- Really?
- Yeah.

488
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:50,125
- Did you ever have to get in one of those?
- No, ma'am.

489
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,134
Thank God.

490
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:55,069
Matowski did though.

491
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,473
- Who?
- Ensign Myron Matowski.

492
00:34:59,543 --> 00:35:03,377
He was nuts about this Filipino girl,
and her parents objected...

493
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:06,314
so one night they put her in a boat
to send her to another island.

494
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:10,547
Matowski hijacks one of these lifeboats,
gets in there...

495
00:35:10,621 --> 00:35:13,112
whoosh... out he goes,
sends up a flare.

496
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,454
He damn near started
a naval battle.

497
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:17,517
- Did she see the flare?
- Are you kidding?

498
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:21,053
The last I heard, they were workin' on
their sixth grandchild...

499
00:35:21,131 --> 00:35:24,589
and she had her own brand of applesauce.

500
00:35:29,273 --> 00:35:31,400
So... So tell me...

501
00:35:31,475 --> 00:35:34,273
how does a swabbie
become a doctor?

502
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:37,246
A what?
Yeah.

503
00:35:37,314 --> 00:35:40,010
L- I wanted to explain
that to you.

504
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:42,882
- You don't have to explain.
- Yes... No, I wanted to... explain it.

505
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:46,389
- That's...
- Well, would you like to walk me to my cabin?

506
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:50,553
Yeah, I would,
but I-I-I ca-ca-can't.

507
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:52,562
I can take a hint.

508
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,564
No. What hint?

509
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:57,795
I promised a couple of chest butchers
that I'd have a brandy with them.

510
00:35:57,868 --> 00:35:59,859
Right.

511
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:07,166
Chest butchers?

512
00:36:08,312 --> 00:36:10,712
What the hell kind
of a moron are you?

513
00:36:12,716 --> 00:36:16,709
Now, why would you go
and do something like that?

514
00:36:16,787 --> 00:36:19,551
- To impress you.
- Oh!

515
00:36:19,623 --> 00:36:23,218
Oh. Well, keep it up.

516
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:25,352
It just might work.

517
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:33,728
<i>Mr. Gordon.!</i>

518
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:40,175
What you do, like samurai.
Great style.

519
00:36:52,823 --> 00:36:56,384
You have
most terrible accent.

520
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,554
- Where you learn Japanese?
- Okinawa.

521
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:04,897
- Oh.
- It's a small sushi joint on the Sunset Strip.

522
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,370
<i>Where were you?</i>

523
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:15,071
A passenger requested
an escort, sir.

524
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:18,080
- Fraternizing.
- Nobody "fratted" anybody.

525
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:20,378
- All we did was... Oh, my God.
- Don't tell me that.

526
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:24,046
<i>Coming through, please.
Injured man here. Injury.</i>

527
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,750
Well, if it isn't the Phantom
of the Ballroom.

528
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:32,387
I oughta sue you guys.

529
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:35,330
Everything around here
is so slippery and wet.

530
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:38,960
- It's an ocean liner.
- I may never dance again.

531
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:41,596
Aga... I haven't
seen you dance yet.

532
00:37:41,672 --> 00:37:44,937
Fortunately for you,
I found the infirmary.

533
00:37:45,008 --> 00:37:48,409
The infirmary is closed
at this hour.

534
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:52,745
- That's what I found out.
- Look, let...

535
00:37:52,816 --> 00:37:57,810
Let me... Let me speak
candidly, gentlemen.

536
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,686
I am this close
to a promotion...

537
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:03,750
that would make me
vice president of entertainment.

538
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:05,920
Wow.

539
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:08,362
I intend to get that job...

540
00:38:08,432 --> 00:38:12,562
by showing how well I can keep
two old dickheads like you in line.

541
00:38:12,636 --> 00:38:14,695
- Oh, now, listen, you...
- No, you listen.

542
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:18,469
Don't mess with me.
I'm your worst nightmare.

543
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:22,501
A song-and-dance man
raised on a military base.

544
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:24,570
Dismissed.

545
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:27,942
<i>Hoo.!</i>

546
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:38,522
Now, you seem to be
annoyed with me, Herbie.

547
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:41,860
Tell me if I'm wrong.

548
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:45,459
And what's this about you
leaving the dance floor?

549
00:38:45,536 --> 00:38:47,470
None of your business.

550
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:51,941
None of my business.
How do you like that?

551
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:56,343
- Why are you sterilizing your trousers?
- I'm steaming them.

552
00:38:56,413 --> 00:38:59,246
Oh. Then what are you gonna do,
eat 'em with garlic butter?

553
00:38:59,316 --> 00:39:01,841
It takes the wrinkles out,
you imbecile!

554
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:05,514
Huh. A man who's steaming
his pants at midnight.

555
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:09,582
- That generally means there's a broad.
- No broad.

556
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,424
Well, that's too bad,
because I got one lined up.

557
00:39:12,496 --> 00:39:14,430
Rich. Texas rich.

558
00:39:14,498 --> 00:39:16,830
With an ass so beautiful...

559
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,562
it's a shame she
has to sit down on it.

560
00:39:19,636 --> 00:39:22,400
Will you do me a favor and
just knock that stuff off?

561
00:39:22,472 --> 00:39:25,202
I'm sorry.
I forgot you were cooking.

562
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:28,108
Now that you've got this girl, how long
is it gonna be before she finds out...

563
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:30,112
you're not the man
she thought you were?

564
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,377
- By then, she'll be in love.
- In love with a lie.

565
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,714
Nobody's perfect.

566
00:39:35,786 --> 00:39:40,723
I think a man should always tell a woman
the truth before she falls in love.

567
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:42,725
<i>Otherwise, how do you
know it's real?</i>

568
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:46,251
What's real is, if I play my cards right,
I'll wind up on easy street.

569
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,390
Once I'm there,
I'm inviting you over every Sunday.

570
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:53,095
- I don't want to have anything to do with this.
- Okay, then don't come over.

571
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,662
She thinks I'm a doctor.

572
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,300
- Who?
- Oh, nobody.

573
00:40:07,651 --> 00:40:10,484
You met a broad.
Da-da

574
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:24,289
Y- You're crazy. Years of insanity
have made you crazy.

575
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:28,168
- Do I look crippled or not?
- Yeah, crippled up here.

576
00:40:28,238 --> 00:40:33,437
Oh, cut it out!

577
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,002
Most of you will work the dance class
from 10:00 to 11:00...

578
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,243
and the wine and cheese
tasting from 12:00 to 1:00.

579
00:40:40,317 --> 00:40:42,342
Please use moderation.

580
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:46,321
The last thing I need is flatulating
dance hosts staggering about the ship.

581
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,848
<i>I bet his father was cruise director
on the Bismarck.</i>

582
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:52,088
Think of yourselves...

583
00:40:52,162 --> 00:40:54,494
as butterflies, gentlemen...

584
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:57,590
and our guests as flowers.

585
00:40:57,668 --> 00:41:02,002
Your job is to pollinate the flowers
with hospitality.

586
00:41:02,072 --> 00:41:05,166
This guy's been at sea
too long.

587
00:41:05,242 --> 00:41:08,370
And if you screw up,
I am personally going to see to it...

588
00:41:08,445 --> 00:41:12,814
that you are removed from the ship and
charged the full round-trip passage...

589
00:41:12,883 --> 00:41:18,651
<i>of $5,462.51 as indicated
in your contracts.</i>

590
00:41:18,722 --> 00:41:21,190
What the hell is...
Five thou... Five thousand?

591
00:41:21,258 --> 00:41:23,488
You told me 2,000!

592
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,623
<i>As for you, Mr. Gordon, Dr. Johanson
will see you at 1100 hours sharp.</i>

593
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:33,159
I don't think that's necessary, sir.
The foot just needs rest.

594
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:37,332
You will remain off
your... injured foot...

595
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:40,069
until Dr. Johanson says otherwise.
Are we clear?

596
00:41:40,143 --> 00:41:42,668
Yes, sir. Clear!
Extremely clear, sir.

597
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:45,715
Brilliant.
Dismissed.

598
00:41:52,589 --> 00:41:55,581
<i>All passengers

00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,765
<i>Remember, the last tender...</i>

602
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:11,637
<i>will return from shore
at 4:30.</i>

603
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:24,182
Well... look who's here.

604
00:42:24,254 --> 00:42:27,883
Flowers and all.
I'll bet they're for me.

605
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:32,691
- Who else would they be for?
- Save it... Hoss.

606
00:42:34,097 --> 00:42:36,429
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

607
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,367
Thank you very much.
Sure appreciate it.

608
00:42:39,436 --> 00:42:43,566
You know, the first day you was in here,
sniffing around like a yard dog?

609
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,938
I knew you'd be back.

610
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:48,000
<i>Ma, for the love of Pete.!</i>

611
00:42:48,078 --> 00:42:51,104
- Who's Pete? My competition?
- That's right.

612
00:42:51,181 --> 00:42:53,274
And guess who I'm rootin' for?

613
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,911
- Oh, Charlie!
- Hi.

614
00:42:56,987 --> 00:43:00,946
- Oh, it's so nice to see you.
- Oh, yeah.

615
00:43:01,024 --> 00:43:02,958
Are these for me?

616
00:43:03,026 --> 00:43:05,722
- No.
- No?

617
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:08,458
- Oh, yes!
- Ohh.

618
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:10,466
They're just beautiful.

619
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:12,468
I didn't want to be
too showy.

620
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:16,563
Oh, well, yours are very tasteful.
Thank you, Charlie.

621
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,972
<i>- Thank you.
- I have to get dressed.</i>

622
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:22,034
Why don't you talk to Ma?
Ma'll keep you company. Excuse me.

623
00:43:22,112 --> 00:43:26,105
- Okay.
- I want you to behave yourself, Charlie.

624
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:30,279
You see, I saw the way you were starin'
at my daughter's... chest.

625
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:33,516
- Oh, I used to be a cardiologist.
- Really?

626
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,115
So I'm almost ready.

627
00:43:36,193 --> 00:43:38,491
Charlie, would you like
to walk with me?

628
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:41,554
- I'd be delighted.
- Oh, thank you.

629
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:45,933
- Ma, we'll see you later.
- Have fun.

630
00:43:46,002 --> 00:43:49,403
I'll try to find a shot glass
for those flowers.

631
00:43:49,473 --> 00:43:53,375
- She's darling, isn't she?
- That's Ma.

632
00:43:53,443 --> 00:43:55,377
<i>- Oh, there you are.
- Hello.</i>

633
00:43:55,445 --> 00:43:58,278
We really must hurry.
The bus is leaving in 10 minutes.

634
00:43:58,348 --> 00:44:00,282
- Hello there, sport.
- Hello.

635
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:04,719
- Why don't you come with us?
- I've been told that the tour is full.

636
00:44:07,057 --> 00:44:09,719
Oh, about those flowers...
thank you so much.

637
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:11,886
They're beautiful. I love them.
See you later?

638
00:44:11,962 --> 00:44:13,953
- Have a good day, Gordo.
- Ta-ta.

639
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,692
There's something about that man
I really don't like.

640
00:44:16,766 --> 00:44:20,550
<i>- Don't you agree?
- That you don't like him? I'd agree with that.</i>

641
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:29,885
Ha-ha!

642
00:44:32,662 --> 00:44:36,792
They call this dancing?
I did this in line at the A&P.

643
00:44:36,866 --> 00:44:39,300
Well, the view is right.

644
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:43,305
- I used to have an ass like that.
- Guys, pay attention.

645
00:44:44,741 --> 00:44:47,073
Would you mind
standing back, please?

646
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:50,169
<i>Let me show you how this is done, okay?</i>

647
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,628
<i>Ship-to-shore call
for Mr. Cullen Carswell.</i>

648
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:12,293
That's you!
That sounds excitin'.

649
00:45:12,368 --> 00:45:14,529
I'm sorry, Liz. I'll try
to wrap it up quickly.

650
00:45:14,604 --> 00:45:17,630
- Why don't I just go ahead and I'll save you a seat?
- All right.

651
00:45:17,707 --> 00:45:19,971
- Ship-to-shore for Carswell.
- Oh, yes, sir.

652
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:22,807
It's an overseas call
from Mr. Donald Trump.

653
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:24,870
He's calling from Zurich.
Says it's urgent.

654
00:45:24,948 --> 00:45:26,939
Is there a telephone handy
with some privacy?

655
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,314
You can take it in the second booth
there on your right.

656
00:45:29,385 --> 00:45:31,376
Thank you.

657
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,295
Hello. This is Cullen Carswell.
I'll take my call now.

658
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,957
- One moment, sir.
- Hello.

659
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:47,366
Hello, Mr. Carswell. Hello.
- Who is this?

660
00:45:47,437 --> 00:45:50,895
<i>This is the international
operator.</i>

661
00:45:50,974 --> 00:45:54,341
I have momentarily
lost your congestion.

662
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:57,004
Please hold
for Mr. Trump.

663
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,413
Yes, I'll hold,
but please hurry.

664
00:46:00,483 --> 00:46:03,748
- Are you holding, sir?
- Yes, yes, I'm holding.

665
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:07,389
Is this Mr. Car-smell?

666
00:46:07,457 --> 00:46:09,391
Carswell!
Yes.

667
00:46:09,459 --> 00:46:13,020
Please hold.
Don't go away.

668
00:46:40,223 --> 00:46:42,953
<i>All passengers
traveling to the festival...</i>

669
00:46:43,026 --> 00:46:46,962
<i>must board the fiesta bus at wharf 10
for immediate departure.</i>

670
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,998
<i>- This is the last call.
- Hey!</i>

671
00:46:49,065 --> 00:46:52,899
I figured I'd see if there were
any no-shows. Where's your friend?

672
00:46:55,071 --> 00:46:57,767
You just don't give up,
do you?

673
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:04,613
Mmm.

674
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:07,445
<i>Oh, look at those.!</i>

675
00:47:07,517 --> 00:47:10,975
- Don't you just love horses, Charlie?
- Only when they win.

676
00:47:13,323 --> 00:47:16,087
- You've never done any real gambling, have you?
- For how much?

677
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,960
<i>I'm not talking about money.
I'm talking about life gambling.</i>

678
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:23,021
You've never been married,
have you?

679
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,365
- In what sense?
- I knew it. I knew it.

680
00:47:27,437 --> 00:47:29,837
I'm waiting for
my sexual prime.

681
00:47:29,906 --> 00:47:32,898
Just when do you think
that's gonna happen?

682
00:47:34,377 --> 00:47:37,244
<i>In about five minutes.</i>

683
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:40,305
That's it.
Get the hips going.

684
00:47:40,383 --> 00:47:43,443
Get that Cuban motion going.

685
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:47,649
Ladies under. Very nice. Good.
Come back around.

686
00:47:47,724 --> 00:47:50,716
<i>- Mom, give me a break.
- Shelly, give me a break.</i>

687
00:47:50,793 --> 00:47:52,886
I danced with the man
one time.

688
00:47:52,962 --> 00:47:56,625
- And you were glowing like Miss Arkansas.
- So I had fun.

689
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:58,633
Herb's a wonderful dancer.

690
00:47:58,701 --> 00:48:02,000
But he's a doctor,
and you know I hate doctors.

691
00:48:02,071 --> 00:48:04,164
Now, moving to the side.
Hips going.

692
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,401
- There's a class. Let's go join the class.
- Oh, I...

693
00:48:06,476 --> 00:48:08,410
- It'll be fun.
- Well...

694
00:48:08,478 --> 00:48:11,743
<i>- You love dancing!
- Under-arm turn, gentlemen.</i>

695
00:48:11,814 --> 00:48:14,510
<i>- All right.
- Let the ladies under.</i>

696
00:48:14,584 --> 00:48:17,451
<i>- That's it.
- Oh, you guys are getting so good.!</i>

697
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,454
Your turn, madame.

698
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,513
Oh!

699
00:48:21,591 --> 00:48:25,220
Excellent! Now, try everything
that we practiced today.

700
00:48:25,294 --> 00:48:28,730
<i>Okay. Goodjob, everybody.</i>

701
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:33,396
How 'bout a wonderful hand
for our dancers?

702
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:05,098
It says that it's a festival,
a sacrifice to purge themselves...

703
00:49:05,168 --> 00:49:07,295
of all sins and evil
before the eclipse.

704
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,600
I'm so excited.
I've never seen an eclipse before.

705
00:49:09,672 --> 00:49:11,606
- Is that right?
- Never seen one.

706
00:49:11,674 --> 00:49:13,608
- I seen one once.
- Really?

707
00:49:13,676 --> 00:49:16,839
But I think the moon
got in the way.

708
00:49:18,815 --> 00:49:20,840
Yes!

709
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:23,750
Oh. Here we go.
Here we go.

710
00:49:36,466 --> 00:49:39,526
Look how happy they are
that we're here!

711
00:49:41,537 --> 00:49:43,528
La, la-la, la-la

712
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:48,775
What are you doin'?

713
00:49:48,845 --> 00:49:52,406
Oh, I... I'm looking at this
for a possible suit.

714
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,481
<i>Oh!</i>

715
00:49:58,554 --> 00:50:01,387
Charlie, what are you doing? I want
to stay here and dance with my friends.

716
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:03,391
- Come with me.
- La-la, la-la

717
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,393
<i>Come with me,
con permiso.</i>

718
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:08,726
<i>La-la, la-la</i>

719
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:11,631
- Watch out!
- You stay here. I'll be right back.

720
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:14,226
- I gotta see a man about a dog.
- Take your time.

721
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,237
La-la, la-la

722
00:50:18,908 --> 00:50:21,342
<i>Mucho viejo. Gracias.</i>

723
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:24,402
Gil, I've been talking
to the board...

724
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,745
about hiring a vice president
of entertainment.

725
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:29,751
Interesting.

726
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:32,879
Listen, is there a way out of here
besides the door?

727
00:50:32,955 --> 00:50:36,254
<i>Oh, yes. Sí, sí, sí.
Down the drain.</i>

728
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,259
Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha.

729
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:42,286
Very funny, pal.
Very funny.

730
00:50:47,904 --> 00:50:52,170
Listen, pal, I need to borrow your mask
for a few minutes.

731
00:50:52,241 --> 00:50:54,971
- Get lost, pops.
- Wait. I'll let you have this.

732
00:50:55,044 --> 00:50:57,774
It's a genuine Rolex.

733
00:50:59,282 --> 00:51:01,409
<i>Please, mister.</i>

734
00:51:01,484 --> 00:51:04,510
This ain't a Rolex.
It says "Romex. "

735
00:51:04,587 --> 00:51:07,579
What, you're gonna make a federal case
out of one lousy letter?

736
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:10,217
They don't make
Romexes anymore.

737
00:51:10,293 --> 00:51:12,158
<i>- This is a collector's item.
- Beat it.</i>

738
00:51:12,228 --> 00:51:16,358
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I haven't had a chimichanga in years.

739
00:51:16,432 --> 00:51:19,731
Would you mind... Would you
pardon me for just one moment?

740
00:51:19,802 --> 00:51:22,566
- What?
- Eh, nature, you know.

741
00:51:22,638 --> 00:51:24,731
- Sorry.
- Oh.

742
00:51:24,807 --> 00:51:27,469
<i>Perdóname. Perdóname.</i>

743
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:31,737
- You...
- Do you want to buy a Rolex?

744
00:51:31,814 --> 00:51:35,807
<i>Comin' through.
¿Qué pasa, señor?</i>

745
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:38,149
What's goin' on here?

746
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:40,416
<i>Parrot coming through.</i>

747
00:51:40,489 --> 00:51:42,821
Parrot here. Parrot.

748
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:45,656
<i>Con permiso. Con permiso.</i>

749
00:51:49,298 --> 00:51:51,732
Gil! Whoo-hoo!

750
00:51:55,338 --> 00:51:59,069
<i>Ah.! Leave her alone
for five seconds.</i>

751
00:52:00,376 --> 00:52:03,174
I'm gettin' a little dizzy
in here with all this...

752
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:06,044
<i>Let me outta here.!</i>

753
00:52:06,115 --> 00:52:08,709
<i>Are you people insane?
Oh, no.!</i>

754
00:52:11,687 --> 00:52:14,554
What do you do
with the bull?

755
00:52:14,624 --> 00:52:17,923
<i>Holy "shaxamahnee'!</i>

756
00:52:17,994 --> 00:52:19,859
Oh, my God!
I'm the parrot!

757
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:25,564
I see trouble!

758
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:30,231
Hey, señor.
Hey, pal.

759
00:52:32,308 --> 00:52:34,868
<i>Gil.! Wait.!</i>

760
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:44,951
All right, mister.
I've got you!

761
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:47,717
Oh, sorry. I thought you were...

762
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,418
Oh, my God!

763
00:52:50,493 --> 00:52:52,427
- Charlie.
- Let's go.

764
00:52:52,495 --> 00:52:55,293
- Why are we going now?
- Now is the time to loot the shops.

765
00:52:55,364 --> 00:52:58,891
- We are witnessing history here.
- I've seen history. It stinks.

766
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:01,960
No, stop!
There's a fire there! Can't you see?

767
00:53:02,038 --> 00:53:04,268
My head's on fire!

768
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:07,987
Help me!
Stop this cow instantly!

769
00:53:16,362 --> 00:53:19,092
Well, hello.

770
00:53:19,165 --> 00:53:22,896
Stuff works wonders for groin pain.
Cheers to you all.

771
00:53:22,968 --> 00:53:26,927
<i>- I've dug all over Guatemala and all over Honduras.
- Really?</i>

772
00:53:27,006 --> 00:53:30,339
It-It's just... The whole culture
is so interesting...

773
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:33,640
- so fascinating and...
- Oh, uh, Vivian.

774
00:53:33,712 --> 00:53:36,772
- Herb. What a lovely surprise.
- I know what you're thinking.

775
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:39,409
- This is my new friend, Sebastian.
- Hello.

776
00:53:39,485 --> 00:53:43,387
He just gave a brilliant lecture on the
significance of the solar eclipse in Mayan mythology.

777
00:53:43,455 --> 00:53:45,355
<i>- What?
- Mayan mythology will tell you...</i>

778
00:53:45,424 --> 00:53:48,018
that an eclipse isn't
really an eclipse at all...

779
00:53:48,093 --> 00:53:53,030
but rather a birth... or an unveiling,
if you will... of a new sun...

780
00:53:53,098 --> 00:53:55,794
- or a new life...
- Fascinating. Herb is a doctor.

781
00:53:55,868 --> 00:53:58,359
<i>- Oh?
- And apparently a dance host on the side.</i>

782
00:53:58,437 --> 00:54:01,304
- I tried to explain this to you.
- Explain what?

783
00:54:01,373 --> 00:54:04,035
I think you did your job
very well.

784
00:54:06,278 --> 00:54:08,269
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

785
00:54:08,347 --> 00:54:11,282
<i>- I've seen him somewhere. He looks familiar.
- Not to me.</i>

786
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:15,252
- My husband was in the oil business with my dad.
- Ah.

787
00:54:15,321 --> 00:54:17,881
If Daddy trusted him,
I figured I could trust him too.

788
00:54:17,957 --> 00:54:20,926
- So, what happened?
- Well, as it turned out...

789
00:54:20,993 --> 00:54:24,895
there were a lot of test wells
he was drillin' on the side.

790
00:54:24,964 --> 00:54:27,797
- You should've had him neutered.
- Oh, I did.

791
00:54:27,867 --> 00:54:31,166
- Except I used an attorney
instead of a doctor.

792
00:54:32,638 --> 00:54:34,936
For lending a helping hand.
Thank you, chappies.

793
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,237
<i>Thank you so very much.</i>

794
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:39,800
Oh! What's the matter?

795
00:54:39,879 --> 00:54:42,439
- Are you all right?
- Old football injury.

796
00:54:42,514 --> 00:54:45,415
- College?
- No. Professional.

797
00:54:45,484 --> 00:54:48,078
TheJets blew a 30-point lead
against the Dolphins...

798
00:54:48,153 --> 00:54:51,316
- and I tried to throw
my TV set out the window.

799
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,415
You're in pain. I'll get help.

800
00:54:53,492 --> 00:54:56,893
No! Wait, wait!

801
00:54:56,962 --> 00:55:00,955
- What are you doing? - I wanna
hear more about your ex-husband.

802
00:55:01,033 --> 00:55:04,491
You... What?
How can...

803
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,561
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Oh!

804
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:09,938
- His back went out,
and I think he needs some help.

805
00:55:10,009 --> 00:55:13,467
- Aw. Would you help me get him on the deck chair?
- Of course.

806
00:55:13,545 --> 00:55:17,709
- God bless you, sir, whosoever you may be.
- Oh, careful. Oh!

807
00:55:17,783 --> 00:55:19,614
If you go
in this direction...

808
00:55:19,685 --> 00:55:22,882
<i>Oh.! What are you doin'?</i>

809
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:25,116
I have to get the wind
from the east.

810
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,454
<i>- He has to get
the wind from the east.</i>

811
00:55:27,526 --> 00:55:31,622
Now, fortunately,
I'm a retired doctor. Aren't we lucky?

812
00:55:31,697 --> 00:55:33,892
Huh?

813
00:55:33,966 --> 00:55:36,298
- And chiropractics is my specialty.
- It's lucky for me.

814
00:55:36,368 --> 00:55:38,802
- Are you his wife?
- Oh, no. I'm just his friend.

815
00:55:38,871 --> 00:55:41,169
She's just a friend.
You tell me where the pain is.

816
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,641
- It's okay. It's better now.
- Well, I think we may need a little adjustment.

817
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:47,679
- I don't need...
An adjustment!

818
00:55:47,746 --> 00:55:51,409
- Uh-huh! A problem
in the lumbar region.

819
00:55:51,483 --> 00:55:53,474
No. My "lumber" is all right.

820
00:55:53,552 --> 00:55:56,419
Don't worry about...

821
00:56:00,926 --> 00:56:03,360
Can you feel anything?

822
00:56:05,931 --> 00:56:08,661
Uh, what are you...

823
00:56:08,734 --> 00:56:11,225
Ah! That should
relieve some tension.

824
00:56:11,303 --> 00:56:15,239
<i>- Uh, what the hell are you doin'?
- Now, just breathe normally.</i>

825
00:56:15,307 --> 00:56:18,071
Go on.

826
00:56:18,143 --> 00:56:20,077
I haven't done
anything yet. Uh!

827
00:56:24,116 --> 00:56:27,552
- Do you feel better, my friend?
- I'm gonna get you.

828
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:29,610
What? A present?
Oh, don't be silly.

829
00:56:29,688 --> 00:56:34,523
Just to lighten the suffering of my fellow
human beings is reward enough for me.

830
00:56:37,162 --> 00:56:39,722
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

831
00:56:39,798 --> 00:56:42,858
Why don't you go.
I'll just rest up here a little while.

832
00:56:42,935 --> 00:56:45,233
Oh, I-I just can't
leave you like this.

833
00:56:45,304 --> 00:56:47,602
<i>- Sure, you can.
- Are you sure?</i>

834
00:56:47,673 --> 00:56:51,131
- Yeah. You go on.
- Actually, I was gonna meet some friends in the casino.

835
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:54,179
Besides, I like
lying here on the couch.

836
00:56:54,246 --> 00:56:56,407
It's the puppy dog in me.

837
00:56:56,482 --> 00:56:58,609
All right.
I'll see you later.

838
00:56:58,684 --> 00:57:00,675
See you later.

839
00:57:00,753 --> 00:57:03,950
- All right.
- Bye.

840
00:57:06,258 --> 00:57:08,317
"Must be the puppy dog
in me. "

841
00:57:08,394 --> 00:57:10,385
You are in over your head, kid.

842
00:57:10,462 --> 00:57:14,159
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I saw the way you looked at her.

843
00:57:14,233 --> 00:57:17,828
She's a beautiful woman with a lot of
money. How do you want me to look at her?

844
00:57:17,903 --> 00:57:21,930
- I think you care about her.
- Give me a break, will ya?

845
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:27,277
Oh, boy. I'm gonna sue you
for malpractice.

846
00:57:27,346 --> 00:57:29,337
I saved your ass
is what I did.

847
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:33,941
Ah.

848
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:36,613
Gil, baby.
I was wondering...

849
00:57:36,688 --> 00:57:38,952
Oh, shut up.

850
00:57:39,024 --> 00:57:41,254
Tonight, you will dance
every dance.

851
00:57:41,326 --> 00:57:44,921
You will be charming,
attentive, light of foot.

852
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:47,488
- And I will be watching.
- Yes, sir!

853
00:57:48,834 --> 00:57:51,325
Have Dr. Johanson
look at that eye, Sullivan.

854
00:57:53,405 --> 00:57:56,636
Jesus, Herbie, we've been
pals for such a long time.

855
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:58,835
Give me a break,
will ya?

856
00:57:58,911 --> 00:58:03,143
- The answer is no.
- If I don't dance, they'll throw me off the ship.

857
00:58:03,215 --> 00:58:05,809
I'll teach you how to swim.
I won't teach you how to dance.

858
00:58:05,884 --> 00:58:07,875
<i>Herbie, please! Please, I beg you.</i>

859
00:58:07,953 --> 00:58:10,649
- Open up your heart.
- Will you knock it off?

860
00:58:10,722 --> 00:58:14,954
- Open your heart to a sad,
frightened old man.

861
00:58:15,027 --> 00:58:19,828
<i>Slow, slow. Quick-quick.</i>

862
00:58:19,898 --> 00:58:23,334
Slow, slow.
Quick-quick.

863
00:58:23,402 --> 00:58:26,633
There you go.
Slow...

864
00:58:26,705 --> 00:58:30,641
Whatever happened
to slow, slow, quick-quick?

865
00:58:30,709 --> 00:58:32,700
You're-You're very much
like a crane.

866
00:58:32,778 --> 00:58:36,475
Slow, slow.
Quick-quick.

867
00:58:36,548 --> 00:58:38,539
Do it.

868
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:44,622
Slow, slow.
Quick... Oh, God.

869
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:47,318
Try it. Left, right.

870
00:58:49,061 --> 00:58:51,154
Together.

871
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:53,323
Aha. Bingo.

872
00:58:53,398 --> 00:58:55,958
Left.

873
00:58:56,034 --> 00:58:58,400
Right. Together.

874
00:58:59,638 --> 00:59:01,629
Very strange.

875
00:59:01,707 --> 00:59:04,039
Okay. This is
the grapevine.

876
00:59:04,109 --> 00:59:06,577
Cross, behind, together.

877
00:59:06,645 --> 00:59:11,275
<i>Slow, slow. Quick-quick.</i>

878
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,443
<i>One, two, three, cha-cha.</i>

879
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:15,680
One, two, three,
cha-cha.

880
00:59:15,754 --> 00:59:19,588
One, two, three, cha-cha.
One, two, three, cha-cha.

881
00:59:19,658 --> 00:59:22,821
One, two, three, cha-cha.
One...

882
00:59:22,895 --> 00:59:25,693
Okay, now wait a minute.
Let's try...

883
00:59:25,764 --> 00:59:29,495
One, two, three, cha-cha.
One, two, three, cha-cha.

884
00:59:29,568 --> 00:59:33,004
One, two...
Uh, that's very...

885
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:35,471
What the hell is that?

886
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:38,203
Guys do this all the time
on the streets...

887
00:59:38,277 --> 00:59:40,211
and-and people
throw money at them.

888
00:59:40,279 --> 00:59:42,474
You're not gettin'
a nickel outta me.

889
00:59:47,486 --> 00:59:49,613
Wait a minute.
This is wrong.

890
00:59:49,688 --> 00:59:53,124
- You're leading.
- I'm supposed to lead. I'm a man.

891
00:59:53,192 --> 00:59:56,320
- Kiss me.
- All right. You lead.

892
01:00:41,273 --> 01:00:44,265
And on the CD...

893
01:00:49,281 --> 01:00:53,342
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

894
01:00:53,418 --> 01:00:56,478
- Uh, see, he's, uh... I'm-I'm...
- It's my first time.

895
01:00:56,555 --> 01:00:59,490
- Oh.
- Dancing, that is, see.

896
01:00:59,558 --> 01:01:02,322
Yeah. We're just friends.
Good pals, buddies.

897
01:01:03,528 --> 01:01:06,793
- Oh. Yes, of course.
- Don't ask, don't tell.

898
01:01:06,865 --> 01:01:09,129
Yeah.

899
01:01:20,379 --> 01:01:22,973
- Is that a waiter's jacket?
- How can you tell?

900
01:01:23,048 --> 01:01:25,039
You got stains
all over the sleeve.

901
01:01:25,117 --> 01:01:28,416
You got parsley down your back.
Fits like a pup tent.

902
01:01:28,487 --> 01:01:31,081
- Are you kidding...
- Ah! Good evening, gentlemen.

903
01:01:31,156 --> 01:01:35,217
Time to face the music, eh, Charlie?

904
01:01:35,294 --> 01:01:39,287
Hey, let-let's face.

905
01:01:41,466 --> 01:01:44,833
<i>Once again, your host...</i>

906
01:01:44,903 --> 01:01:50,671
<i>the very talented
Mr. Gil Godwyn.!</i>

907
01:01:50,742 --> 01:01:52,539
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

908
01:01:52,611 --> 01:01:55,774
here we are,
under the stars...

909
01:01:55,847 --> 01:01:59,442
in the moonlight,
out on the open sea.

910
01:01:59,518 --> 01:02:04,080
Let's get ready...
to rhum-ba.

911
01:02:04,156 --> 01:02:07,455
Ooh. We're going
to rhum-ba.

912
01:02:09,761 --> 01:02:11,695
He's demented.

913
01:02:32,517 --> 01:02:34,747
You're on, champ.

914
01:02:40,726 --> 01:02:43,559
Care to dance, madam?

915
01:02:43,628 --> 01:02:45,892
Oh, yes. Yes, I'd love to.

916
01:02:52,504 --> 01:02:54,802
Don't slouch.

917
01:02:56,074 --> 01:02:58,702
Have you been hosting
for long?

918
01:02:58,777 --> 01:03:02,304
This is my 23rd run,
ma'am.

919
01:03:02,381 --> 01:03:05,509
I started out giving ballroom exhibition.

920
01:03:14,426 --> 01:03:16,621
Shorten your steps.

921
01:03:24,236 --> 01:03:27,433
You're doing very well, madam,
but don't rush it.

922
01:03:27,506 --> 01:03:32,000
- You see, the rhumba is more of a walk than a dance.
- Ouch. Oh.

923
01:03:33,211 --> 01:03:35,679
- Oh, shit!
- Beg-Beg your pardon?

924
01:03:35,747 --> 01:03:38,716
<i>Oh. Uh, hit.
This song was a big hit.</i>

925
01:03:40,886 --> 01:03:45,323
- Oh, what... What does that have to do with the rhumba?
- Absolutely nothing.

926
01:03:53,465 --> 01:03:55,456
- Look out.
- You said it was a walk.

927
01:03:55,534 --> 01:03:57,525
It's a fast walk.

928
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:03,332
Ow!

929
01:04:09,648 --> 01:04:11,081
Oh, God.

930
01:04:18,557 --> 01:04:22,425
Oh! What... What do you call this step?

931
01:04:22,494 --> 01:04:24,928
- This is the Brazilian creep.
- Oh.

932
01:04:24,996 --> 01:04:27,260
- In Brazil, of course, it's just called "the creep. "
- Oh.

933
01:04:33,271 --> 01:04:35,262
Oh.

934
01:04:41,313 --> 01:04:43,247
Oh, oh, oh!

935
01:04:49,488 --> 01:04:51,649
Oh. Whoa.

936
01:05:07,772 --> 01:05:13,267
Oh! Oh!

937
01:05:31,396 --> 01:05:33,330
- Uh! Oh! I'm so sorry.
- Ow.

938
01:05:33,398 --> 01:05:35,559
- No. It's our fault.
- Sorry.

939
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:41,734
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

940
01:06:03,728 --> 01:06:05,923
Excuse me.

941
01:06:07,232 --> 01:06:09,132
<i>Thank you.</i>

942
01:06:14,005 --> 01:06:17,463
Do you have any idea whom you've just
assaulted on the dance floor?

943
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:19,737
Oh, Miss Carruthers,
I don't know what...

944
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:22,609
I feel... ravaged.

945
01:06:22,681 --> 01:06:25,650
Thank you.
I'm Ellen Carruthers.

946
01:06:25,717 --> 01:06:28,709
Oh. You're the dame that
owns this little boat.

947
01:06:31,289 --> 01:06:34,349
Excuse me.
Uh, duty calls.

948
01:06:34,426 --> 01:06:36,894
<i>Can I get you
anything, miss?</i>

949
01:06:39,898 --> 01:06:44,561
<i>All over Honduras. You wouldn't believe
what happened. There were 40,000 people...</i>

950
01:06:44,636 --> 01:06:49,232
So. It's the broad
that stole our airplane seats.

951
01:06:49,307 --> 01:06:53,004
- That broad happens to have been an editor at Doubleday.
- Who cares?

952
01:06:53,078 --> 01:06:55,308
All I was
was a clerk at Gimbel's.

953
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,678
And Secretariat
was just a horse.

954
01:06:57,749 --> 01:07:00,411
- Go on. Ask her to dance.
- Aw, it's too late, Charlie.

955
01:07:02,354 --> 01:07:06,347
There's no such thing as "too late. "
That's why they invented death.

956
01:07:06,424 --> 01:07:08,415
Dance!

957
01:07:14,966 --> 01:07:17,366
By the Inquisition,
they were burned.

958
01:07:17,435 --> 01:07:22,304
<i>So now, some people argue,
that they invented the ladle.</i>

959
01:07:22,374 --> 01:07:25,673
<i>But the ancient drawings indicate
that the Mayans were using...</i>

960
01:07:25,744 --> 01:07:29,771
<i>- a large perforated scooping utensil.
- Excuse me.</i>

961
01:07:29,848 --> 01:07:32,214
Um, I'm gonna go
drop the anchor on my toe.

962
01:07:32,283 --> 01:07:34,376
- I'll go with you.
- You're leaving?

963
01:07:34,452 --> 01:07:38,752
Anyway, what is really important is that
when I shone the light in the cave...

964
01:07:38,823 --> 01:07:40,950
there it was on the wall...
the ladle.

965
01:07:41,026 --> 01:07:43,256
- Vivian?
- Which proved beyond a reasonable doubt... Huh?

966
01:07:43,328 --> 01:07:48,391
Excuse me. L-I would really be very
honored if you would care to join me.

967
01:07:48,466 --> 01:07:51,526
I've already
danced this dance.

968
01:07:51,603 --> 01:07:55,130
Yes, well, I-I- I was hoping
you might want to try it again.

969
01:07:55,206 --> 01:07:58,642
You know, a, uh,
an archaeologist in Reykjavík...

970
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:02,806
- claims that the Incas actually did a form of the hustle.
- What?

971
01:08:02,881 --> 01:08:05,975
- You-You never heard of that?
I mean, it was a... - You win.

972
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:09,510
Excuse us.

973
01:08:17,395 --> 01:08:19,522
You dance much better
than you lie.

974
01:08:19,597 --> 01:08:23,363
Well, uh, lying is new to me.
I've been dancing most of my life.

975
01:08:23,435 --> 01:08:26,632
Hmm. Did you start dancing
before or after medical school?

976
01:08:26,705 --> 01:08:28,696
Oh, you're a funny lady.

977
01:08:28,773 --> 01:08:31,003
I'm also
a very serious lady...

978
01:08:31,076 --> 01:08:33,067
especially when
I'm lied to.

979
01:08:33,144 --> 01:08:35,908
Hey, I didn't lie to you.
My friend did.

980
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,414
<i>Well, you could've
told me the truth.</i>

981
01:08:38,483 --> 01:08:41,247
- Well, maybe I was afraid.
- Afraid of what?

982
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:45,085
Well, that you would,
uh, laugh or be disappointed.

983
01:08:45,156 --> 01:08:47,147
- About what?
- Aw, hell, I don't know.

984
01:08:47,225 --> 01:08:50,217
- Well, tell me now.
- Tell you what?

985
01:08:50,295 --> 01:08:52,786
- Try the truth.
- Well, the truth is...

986
01:08:52,864 --> 01:08:55,890
I was just a clerk
at Gimbel's for 35 years...

987
01:08:55,967 --> 01:08:58,162
till they damn well
went out of business.

988
01:08:58,236 --> 01:09:00,704
And I got roped into
this stupid dance-host thing...

989
01:09:00,772 --> 01:09:03,297
by that lunatic there,
over there.

990
01:09:07,011 --> 01:09:08,876
Just...

991
01:09:13,718 --> 01:09:15,860
What happened?

992
01:09:15,994 --> 01:09:19,521
<i>- Wait a second.
- Why? So I can make a fool of myself again?</i>

993
01:09:31,442 --> 01:09:34,377
I didn't think I'd ever
kiss anybody that way again.

994
01:09:34,445 --> 01:09:36,470
Neither did I.

995
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,476
- I need to step outside.
- We are outside.

996
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,712
I knew that.

997
01:09:50,128 --> 01:09:52,187
But won't... won't you
get in trouble...

998
01:09:52,263 --> 01:09:54,254
I mean, if someone
should see us like this?

999
01:09:54,332 --> 01:09:57,165
- Oh, well, they could throw me overboard.
- I'd miss you.

1000
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,430
Yeah?

1001
01:09:59,504 --> 01:10:03,372
Why don't we watch the, uh, eclipse
together tomorrow?

1002
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:07,775
- All right.
- Yeah. We could go in separate buses to Chichén Itzá...

1003
01:10:07,845 --> 01:10:09,836
and meet at a café.

1004
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:13,441
- What café?
- Well, it's a town. There must be a café.

1005
01:10:13,518 --> 01:10:16,316
I'll find it, and...
and you'll find me.

1006
01:10:16,387 --> 01:10:20,483
<i>Oh.</i>

1007
01:10:20,558 --> 01:10:24,585
- It's been my pleasure, ma'am.
- Oh, thank you very much.

1008
01:10:24,662 --> 01:10:28,098
Hey, Gil,
I loved the number.

1009
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:30,157
Oh. Thank you.

1010
01:10:32,236 --> 01:10:34,363
There are almost a dozen
in the fleet now.

1011
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,999
This is the baby,
my little jewel.

1012
01:10:37,075 --> 01:10:39,202
- Madam?
- Well, hello there.

1013
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:42,769
Oh, how do you do?
Mr. Godwyn asked me to give you this.

1014
01:10:42,847 --> 01:10:45,941
Oh, thank you.

1015
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:58,789
Would you excuse me,
please?

1016
01:10:58,863 --> 01:11:01,024
- How charming you look tonight.
- Thanks.

1017
01:11:01,099 --> 01:11:05,229
<i>- Oh, Mr. Godwyn.
- Why aren't you dancing?</i>

1018
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:10,070
Because Mrs. Carruthers...
asked me to give you a message.

1019
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:12,132
- Really.
- Yes. I have a feeling, sir...

1020
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:14,974
that you're gonna get that promotion
you've been looking for.

1021
01:11:15,046 --> 01:11:17,037
Did... Did she say that?

1022
01:11:17,115 --> 01:11:20,380
She said she wants you
in her room...

1023
01:11:20,451 --> 01:11:23,477
<i>A.S.P.C. A...
A.S.A.P.</i>

1024
01:11:23,554 --> 01:11:25,852
Her room? Now?

1025
01:11:27,258 --> 01:11:30,716
Her exact words were...

1026
01:11:31,963 --> 01:11:35,194
Well, I don't remember them
off-hand, but, uh...

1027
01:11:35,266 --> 01:11:37,894
- Come on, man.
- Uh, "If not sooner. "

1028
01:11:40,872 --> 01:11:43,033
- Get on that dance floor.
- Yes, sir.

1029
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:48,536
- Hi there.
- Yes?

1030
01:11:48,613 --> 01:11:51,241
Gotta deliver Godwyn's shirts
to his room.

1031
01:11:51,315 --> 01:11:53,510
- Oh, you need the key.
- Yeah. I'm not gonna slip them under the door.

1032
01:11:53,584 --> 01:11:55,575
They'll get wrinkled.

1033
01:11:57,989 --> 01:12:00,014
Hello, hello, hello.

1034
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:03,219
Oh, hello. You sure made
a fast recovery, didn't you?

1035
01:12:03,294 --> 01:12:05,285
Nothing like being young.

1036
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:11,100
Why do you look at me as though
I were nothing but trouble?

1037
01:12:11,169 --> 01:12:14,229
- I like trouble.
- I like you too.

1038
01:12:14,305 --> 01:12:16,603
- How about a game of poker?
- Poker, okay.

1039
01:12:16,674 --> 01:12:21,976
But I gotta warn you, Carswell. This time,
I'm not tearing up any of your checks.

1040
01:12:24,115 --> 01:12:26,743
<i>Domo.</i>

1041
01:12:26,817 --> 01:12:30,947
I think you're a phony, chum,
and I'm going to prove it.

1042
01:12:31,022 --> 01:12:35,959
- Oh, boy.
- Nice to see you're relaxing tonight, Carswell.

1043
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:55,973
- I beg your pardon?
- Take a hike. Hi.

1044
01:12:56,047 --> 01:12:58,607
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

1045
01:12:58,683 --> 01:13:02,278
- Two vodka stingers, and I lost my key.
- Oh.

1046
01:13:02,353 --> 01:13:06,790
- How about you?
- I work here.

1047
01:13:07,892 --> 01:13:09,883
You do?

1048
01:13:09,961 --> 01:13:12,930
Uh, do you do...
C.P.R.?

1049
01:13:14,632 --> 01:13:17,100
How does it go?

1050
01:13:48,065 --> 01:13:50,533

01:13:58,943 --> 01:14:01,639
<i>Ellen.
Bit of bubbly?</i>

1053
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:06,113
<i>Ace, queen bets.</i>

1054
01:14:06,183 --> 01:14:08,174
I will check.

1055
01:14:09,854 --> 01:14:11,913
Check, check.

1056
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:14,355

- Too rich for my blood.

1060
01:14:28,139 --> 01:14:30,869
I fold.

1061
01:14:31,942 --> 01:14:34,740
- Hmm.
- How much you bet?

1062
01:14:34,812 --> 01:14:37,713
- Twenty thousand dollars.
- Twenty thousand dollars.

1063
01:14:37,782 --> 01:14:40,717
Right.

1064
01:14:40,785 --> 01:14:44,687
Oopsy doopsy woopsy.
Call.

1065
01:14:48,759 --> 01:14:50,727
I'm out.

1066
01:14:50,795 --> 01:14:52,786
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You all right?

1067
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:56,731
- Yes, of course I'm all right.
- Does anyone have a napkin or something?

1068
01:14:56,801 --> 01:15:01,636
- Card in sleeve. He's a cheat. You were right, Mr. Gordon.
- Pretty sloppy, Carswell.

1069
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:04,231
- That's disgusting.
- But to prove that he was a fraud.

1070
01:15:04,308 --> 01:15:06,902
I'm gonna overlook this whole thing

the casino, sir.

1074
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:19,914
- Gentlemen, please believe me.
- It doesn't matter what we believe, does it, Carswell?

Tra la.

1076

All right. This hand is dead.
Everybody will get their money back.

1077

- Someplace quiet?

- Yeah.
- Right. Like your room, right?

01:15:39,944 --> 01:15:42,777
- Wonderful suggestion.
- No.

No, that wasn't

- Madam.

1082

- Thank you. Oh, this is a nice suite, Charlie.
- Isn't that nice?

1083
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:08,196
Charlie, about your cologne.

1084
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:10,331
Oh, it's not cologne.
It's aftershave lotion.

1085
01:16:10,408 --> 01:16:13,866
You ever thought of,
uh, growing a beard?

Oh!

1094
01:17:00,891 --> 01:17:03,052
That's above and beyond
the call of duty.

1095
01:17:03,127 --> 01:17:05,254
Yeah. He should
make captain for that.

1096

Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.

1099
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:36,182
I really had a good time
last night, Charlie.

1100
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:39,423
- I really enjoyed myself.
- L-I... I just wanted...

Oh. What happened
to the good-lookin' one?

1103
01:17:48,339 --> 01:17:51,604
This is
a good-lookin' one, Ma.

1104

See you later.

Huh.

1106

Yah! I'll race you

- That's terrible.

1110
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:58,841
The doctors say I have
only a few more months.

1111

Let's be married before

the hourglass of mortality.

1113
01:19:04,815 --> 01:19:06,942
You barely know
this woman.

1114
01:19:07,017 --> 01:19:10,384
Liz, I would be honored
if you took my last name...

1115
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,718

on your bank account.

- I'll take it.
- Okay.

1121
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,335
I finally figured it out,
seeing you here in the gift shop.

1122
01:19:35,412 --> 01:19:39,576
Back at St. Vincent's? Seems like I was
always running into you in the gift shop.

1123
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,641
St. Vincent?

1124

It's Nurse Collins.

1125
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:47,856
- Oh. I can't believe
that I didn't recognize you.

1126
01:19:47,925 --> 01:19:49,916
It's probably not one of your
better memories.

1127
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:52,827
Oh, no, no. Come on.
Suzie was nuts about you.

1128
01:19:52,896 --> 01:19:55,990
- The feeling was mutual.
- Yeah.

1129
01:19:56,066 --> 01:19:58,728
You, on the other hand,
were a complete pain in the butt.

1130
01:19:58,802 --> 01:20:00,793
Yeah.

1131
01:20:00,871 --> 01:20:05,433
- I've got exactly 20 minutes. How about a cup of coffee?
- Love it.

<i>Passengers going ashore,

1133

to let this thing beat us.

1137
01:20:23,227 --> 01:20:27,129
- Yeah. You guys were one of those couples.
- Yeah.

1138
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:30,598
I remember on the last night... By
that time, there's so much medication...

1139
01:20:30,668 --> 01:20:33,102
who knows whether they understand
what's goin' on, but...

1140
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:37,800
I remember you leaning
right down next to her ear...

1141
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:42,141
telling her you'd be in love with her
always and forever.

<i>Shejust had this...

You knew she knew.

1145
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:57,890
I shouldn't be saying this.

1146
01:20:57,961 --> 01:21:00,794
Oh, no, no.
It's nice, really.

1147

- Huh?

01:25:25,132 --> 01:25:29,398
- And he's... He's... a decent man.
- Terrific.

1200
01:25:29,469 --> 01:25:31,334
And he makes me laugh.

1201
01:25:31,404 --> 01:25:34,999
You not only snagged yourself
a millionaire...

1202
01:25:35,075 --> 01:25:38,476
you're gonna have laughs
into the bargain.

1203
01:25:38,545 --> 01:25:40,740
Yeah.

1204
01:25:40,814 --> 01:25:44,773
<i>The last tender
for shore departs in five minutes.</i>

1205
01:25:44,851 --> 01:25:48,685
<i>Please remember that all passengers
must return to ship by 4:30.</i>

1206
01:25:48,755 --> 01:25:52,919
<i>We will be raising the anchor at
5:00 p. m. And setting sail for Cozumel.</i>

1207
01:25:56,496 --> 01:26:00,626
- Hell, he probably... He probably changed his mind.
- No, Ma.

1208
01:26:02,135 --> 01:26:04,126
<i>- Hi, sweetheart.
- Oh, hi.</i>

1209
01:26:04,204 --> 01:26:08,800
- Oh, you look enchanting.
- Oh, thank you.

1210
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:12,971
Hello... Mother.

1211
01:26:13,046 --> 01:26:15,776
Charlie, don't
overshoot the runway.

1212
01:26:15,849 --> 01:26:20,013
I love family.
We'd better get goin'.

1213
01:26:21,621 --> 01:26:25,148
Oh, it's Mr. Gordon. Don't let this one
get away. He's a good one.

1214
01:26:25,225 --> 01:26:28,991
Mrs. Carruthers, Gil Godwyn,
this is Mavis and Liz "LaDreck. "

1215
01:26:29,062 --> 01:26:31,053
- LaBreche.
- How you doin'?

1216
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:34,794
Hmm.
That's a familiar cologne, Mr. Gordon.

1217
01:26:34,868 --> 01:26:37,666
Yes. Thank you. You can
pick it up anywhere.

1218
01:26:37,737 --> 01:26:40,900
Matter of fact, I picked
some up this morning... on my pillow.

1219
01:26:40,974 --> 01:26:44,068
This guy's hilarious.

1220
01:26:44,144 --> 01:26:46,704
Liz, have you had the chance yet
of dancing with Mr. Gordon?

1221
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:49,510
- No, not yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
- See you in the ballroom, Gordon...

1222
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:52,518
with the rest
of the dance hosts.

1223
01:26:55,622 --> 01:26:58,523
With the rest
of the what?

1224
01:26:58,592 --> 01:27:01,823
Oh, he's always kidding around.
He thinks I should become a dance host.

1225
01:27:01,895 --> 01:27:03,886
Charlie, I'm confused here.

1226
01:27:03,964 --> 01:27:07,730
<i>- You told me that you were in mergers and acquisitions.
- Well, he is.</i>

1227
01:27:07,801 --> 01:27:11,532
His job is to acquire a partner and
to merge with her on the dance floor.

1228
01:27:11,605 --> 01:27:13,766
Isn't that right, Gordon?

1229
01:27:14,908 --> 01:27:16,899
Liz, I was gonna
mention this to you.

1230
01:27:16,977 --> 01:27:19,275
That would have been
a good idea.

1231
01:27:19,346 --> 01:27:23,442
You see... Wait a minute, Liz.
Come back. Let me explain.

1232
01:27:23,516 --> 01:27:25,848
Where are you going,
Mother?

1233
01:27:25,919 --> 01:27:27,910
I hate losers.

1234
01:27:29,589 --> 01:27:32,057
Thanks a lot, pal.

1235
01:27:32,125 --> 01:27:34,719
Gil? What just happened?

1236
01:27:34,794 --> 01:27:36,785
- Well, where's your mother?
- She's not coming back on board.

1237
01:27:36,863 --> 01:27:38,854
You can tell your friend
she's going home.

1238
01:27:38,932 --> 01:27:41,025
- Where's my friend?
- Question of the day.

1239
01:27:58,418 --> 01:28:01,353
- What the hell are you doin' up here?
- Oh, hi.

1240
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:07,091
Ah, Charlie, I'm...
I'm still in love with Suzie.

1241
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:11,062
- It seems to present a problem.
- It's only a problem if you want it to be.

1242
01:28:11,131 --> 01:28:14,726
- Don't start with me, huh?
- Go on after Vivian. Go now.

1243
01:28:14,801 --> 01:28:17,895
- Look, I hardly know her.
- You know her, and you're crazy about her.

1244
01:28:17,971 --> 01:28:20,838
The question is, have you got the balls
to do anything about it?

1245
01:28:20,907 --> 01:28:24,741
- Well, I... I'm just not ready yet.
- Then get ready.

1246
01:28:24,811 --> 01:28:27,678
- You're here now. You're living.
You're breathing. You got a choice.

1247
01:28:27,747 --> 01:28:31,581
- I can't do it.
- Will you stop using Suzie as a safety net.

1248
01:28:31,651 --> 01:28:33,676
Wait a minute. Who in the hell
are you to tell me...

1249
01:28:33,753 --> 01:28:36,722
She was my sister
before she was your wife.

1250
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:38,781
If she were here now,
she'd tell you the same thing.

1251
01:28:38,858 --> 01:28:41,691
But she is not here now,
is she, Charlie?

1252
01:28:41,761 --> 01:28:43,752
She's gone.

1253
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:46,264
That's right, Herb,
but you're not.

1254
01:28:56,810 --> 01:29:01,008
- What the hell am I doin' here?
- That's what I asked you in the first place.

1255
01:29:01,081 --> 01:29:03,709
I am not authorized
to give you that information.

1256
01:29:03,783 --> 01:29:07,219
Hey, I'm not authorized to throw
your ass overboard, but I'll do it.

1257
01:29:07,287 --> 01:29:09,687
Now tell me
where she is.

1258
01:29:09,756 --> 01:29:14,352
You'd better tell him, mister. This man's
got a black belt in sum flung dung...

1259
01:29:14,427 --> 01:29:16,520
or one of them things.

1260
01:29:16,596 --> 01:29:20,862
Please.

1261
01:29:20,934 --> 01:29:24,529
All right, look. All I know is we got
a message that she's flying home.

1262
01:29:24,604 --> 01:29:26,595
- She's flying?
- Yes.

1263
01:29:26,673 --> 01:29:28,664
- From where?
- I have no idea.

1264
01:29:28,775 --> 01:29:30,800
All right, all right.

1265
01:29:30,877 --> 01:29:34,643
Stop the car. Stop the car.
Stop the car!

1266
01:29:34,714 --> 01:29:37,205
Stop... Stop the car.

1267
01:29:37,283 --> 01:29:41,083
Oh, my Lord!
Where in the...

1268
01:29:44,524 --> 01:29:48,016
Oh. Look, I don't think
you understand us at all.

1269
01:29:48,094 --> 01:29:50,995
We want to go
to the airport.

1270
01:29:51,064 --> 01:29:54,591
<i>- Sí, señora. The airport.
- That thing?</i>

1271
01:29:54,667 --> 01:29:56,658
- Oh, my Lord.
- I get the luggage.

1272
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:59,364
<i>No. Leave the luggage where it is, please.</i>

1273
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:01,339
<i>Wait a minute.
I see somebody.</i>

1274
01:30:01,408 --> 01:30:04,741
Right out of the corner of my eye.
Don't you move.

1275
01:30:04,811 --> 01:30:07,905
You stay right where you are.
Come on, dear.

1276
01:30:07,981 --> 01:30:11,542
<i>Come on. Uh, excuse me,
but maybe you could help me.</i>

1277
01:30:11,618 --> 01:30:14,610
<i>This crazy cab driver's
tryin'to tell me that this is a...</i>

1278
01:30:14,687 --> 01:30:17,918
<i>- "aerioporto. "
- Sí.</i>

1279
01:30:17,991 --> 01:30:21,620
<i>- Ayayay.
- I don't believe this. I don't believe this.</i>

1280
01:30:21,694 --> 01:30:23,685
<i>All right, if this
is the "aerioporto... "</i>

1281
01:30:23,763 --> 01:30:26,027
<i>then maybe you can
show me a... a piloto.</i>

1282
01:30:26,099 --> 01:30:29,626
- You're looking at him.
- What?

1283
01:30:29,702 --> 01:30:31,829
You want a lift,
sweetcakes?

1284
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:38,201
- My God Almighty, did you hear what he just called me?
- Sure did.

1285
01:30:49,222 --> 01:30:52,783
- Come on.
- Are you crazy? This is dangerous.

1286
01:30:52,859 --> 01:30:54,850
What's the matter, Charlie?
You afraid to live a little?

1287
01:30:54,928 --> 01:30:58,091
Living is good.
It's dying I'm worried about.

1288
01:30:59,799 --> 01:31:03,735
Where are Gordon and Sullivan?

1289
01:31:03,803 --> 01:31:06,499
And don't give me any of that
"code among comrades" crap.

1290
01:31:06,573 --> 01:31:08,564
Sir! Don't have
the foggiest. Sir!

1291
01:31:09,576 --> 01:31:11,908
Oh, bollocks!

1292
01:31:11,978 --> 01:31:14,811
Uh... Pardon me.
Pardon me.

1293
01:31:14,881 --> 01:31:17,247
This should be good.

1294
01:31:17,317 --> 01:31:20,047
- $500 cash.
- Are you out of your mind?

1295
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,850
- That's too much money.
- That doesn't mean I ain't a good pilot.

1296
01:31:25,058 --> 01:31:28,858
Look at this. Look at this.
It's J.F.K. All of a sudden.

1297
01:31:28,928 --> 01:31:30,919
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

1298
01:31:30,997 --> 01:31:33,625
I have an idea, Ma.
Just stay with me.

1299
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:36,533
Good evenin'. I don't know you,
but this man over here...

1300
01:31:36,603 --> 01:31:39,731
<i>says that he will charge us $500
to get to a real airport.</i>

1301
01:31:39,806 --> 01:31:41,967
Now, would you be interested
in splittin' that with us?

1302
01:31:42,041 --> 01:31:44,509
- Absolutely.
- You got a deal.

1303
01:31:44,577 --> 01:31:46,568
You wanna ride shotgun?

1304
01:31:46,646 --> 01:31:49,274
Don't touch me.

1305
01:31:49,349 --> 01:31:52,284
- Okay, get ready, kid.
- And where do we think we're going?

1306
01:31:52,352 --> 01:31:56,880
Oh, hi there. We're just gonna go
scouting for some icebergs.

1307
01:31:56,956 --> 01:32:01,052
You two geezers aren't going anywhere except
back to your cabin where you will stay...

1308
01:32:01,127 --> 01:32:04,062
Listen to me, you sniveling
little brownnose!

1309
01:32:04,130 --> 01:32:07,896
I have lived for 71 years,
I fought a war, I buried my wife...

1310
01:32:07,967 --> 01:32:12,233
and I have survived
48 white sales at Gimbel's.

1311
01:32:12,305 --> 01:32:17,504
<i>So if you think that some little fop like you
is gonna stop me, you got another think comin!</i>

1312
01:32:17,577 --> 01:32:19,807
How dare you
speak to me that way!

1313
01:32:19,879 --> 01:32:23,178
- May I speak to you for a moment, please?
- No, you may not!

1314
01:32:23,249 --> 01:32:25,581
Oh!

1315
01:32:25,652 --> 01:32:27,677
Way to go, Charlie!

1316
01:32:29,722 --> 01:32:32,520
I can't stop it, Charlie!

1317
01:32:32,592 --> 01:32:34,184
Hang on, Charlie!

1318
01:32:36,729 --> 01:32:38,321
We're gonna hit!

1319
01:32:40,099 --> 01:32:43,193
Bon voyage, meathead.

1320
01:32:43,269 --> 01:32:45,703
I hope your boat
capsizes...

1321
01:32:45,772 --> 01:32:48,434
and you drown
like bloody rats!

1322
01:32:48,508 --> 01:32:52,308
<i>- Bye.!
- When that old bag makes me V. P...</i>

1323
01:32:52,378 --> 01:32:55,040
I'll see to it you never work
another cruise ship...

1324
01:32:55,114 --> 01:32:57,708
as long as you live!

1325
01:32:57,784 --> 01:32:59,718
Hah!

1326
01:33:02,655 --> 01:33:05,715
Good evening, Ellen.
Eh...

1327
01:33:05,792 --> 01:33:08,226
- What are you doing out here?
- You know, Gil...

1328
01:33:08,294 --> 01:33:11,889
I find it hard to believe, but
it really is true. You are an asshole.

1329
01:33:11,965 --> 01:33:15,958
- Oh. I'm simply doing my job.
- Oh, you have no job.

1330
01:33:16,035 --> 01:33:18,629
<i>You're fired.
Mac?</i>

1331
01:33:18,705 --> 01:33:21,970
- As of now, you are my new C.D.
- No...

1332
01:33:23,042 --> 01:33:25,033
What about me?

1333
01:33:25,111 --> 01:33:27,341
You're...
his friend.

1334
01:33:29,882 --> 01:33:31,873
What the hell
is she talking about?

1335
01:33:31,951 --> 01:33:34,681
She's talkin' about
"button that button," you little prick.

1336
01:33:36,122 --> 01:33:39,091
Prick.

1337
01:33:44,564 --> 01:33:46,930
You know what
I don't see? Land.

1338
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,629
- It's there.
- I see nothing but night.

1339
01:33:50,703 --> 01:33:53,831
Hope we don't get stranded.

1340
01:33:53,906 --> 01:33:56,101
You know, these are
shark-infested waters.

1341
01:33:56,175 --> 01:33:59,269
We're not
gonna get stranded.

1342
01:33:59,345 --> 01:34:01,609
They say that the big ones
will swallow you whole.

1343
01:34:01,681 --> 01:34:03,808
Swallow my what?

1344
01:34:03,883 --> 01:34:06,613
You're not helping me,
Charles.

1345
01:34:06,686 --> 01:34:10,122
- Here, let me do that.
- What makes you think you can do it?

1346
01:34:10,189 --> 01:34:13,056
- Because I'm taller than you are.
- Oh, that has nothin' to do with it, taller.

1347
01:34:13,126 --> 01:34:15,993
It's in...
It's in the wrist.

1348
01:34:16,062 --> 01:34:18,053
<i>We did it.</i>

1349
01:34:18,131 --> 01:34:19,996
- We did it.
- Yeah.

1350
01:34:23,636 --> 01:34:26,002
Well, it turns nicely.

1351
01:34:26,072 --> 01:34:28,563
Sit down, will ya, so I
can see where I'm goin'.

1352
01:34:28,641 --> 01:34:30,632
Eh!

1353
01:34:32,211 --> 01:34:34,236
<i>- Are you from the cruise?
- Uh-huh.</i>

1354
01:34:34,314 --> 01:34:36,714
<i>- I thought so.
- Now, here he comes.</i>

1355
01:34:36,783 --> 01:34:39,809
- Be careful. Watch your head.
- Good evening, ladies, and welcome aboard.

1356
01:34:39,886 --> 01:34:43,083
<i>- Oh, my God.
- And thank you for choosing Vaya Azul.</i>

1357
01:34:43,156 --> 01:34:47,354
Oh, my God.

1358
01:34:47,427 --> 01:34:51,295
Piece of shit.

1359
01:34:51,364 --> 01:34:54,128
Which one of the Wright brothers
did you buy this from?

1360
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,327
Probably the one you
dated in high school.

1361
01:34:56,402 --> 01:34:58,927
Ooh! I feel so much better.
That's very reassuring.

1362
01:34:59,005 --> 01:35:02,168
We have a funny pilot!

1363
01:35:02,241 --> 01:35:04,709
Hold it! My God! What are you doing?

1364
01:35:04,777 --> 01:35:06,836
I wanna get out of here, Ma.

1365
01:35:06,913 --> 01:35:09,438
We're goin'!
We're goin'!

1366
01:35:21,728 --> 01:35:23,992
Take it easy now. Oh, my Lord!

1367
01:35:26,232 --> 01:35:29,258
There! A plane!

1368
01:35:29,335 --> 01:35:31,326
<i>There's a plane.</i>

1369
01:35:31,404 --> 01:35:33,702
- Is she in it?
- I don't know.

1370
01:35:33,773 --> 01:35:36,867
Do you see a telescope
attached to my head?

1371
01:35:36,943 --> 01:35:39,036
Oh, come on, baby.
Come on. Let's go.

1372
01:35:39,112 --> 01:35:41,376
- Come on, baby! Come on.
- Ooh-ooh!

1373
01:35:43,683 --> 01:35:46,049
Ah! Ah!

1374
01:35:46,119 --> 01:35:48,349
<i>- Wait.! Wait.!
- Wait.! Wait.! Hold it.!</i>

1375
01:35:48,421 --> 01:35:50,582
<i>- Wait.! Stop.!
- Wait a minute.!</i>

1376
01:35:50,656 --> 01:35:55,525
<i>- Wait for us.!
- It's Herbie.! Herbie and his friend.!</i>

1377
01:35:55,595 --> 01:35:57,563
<i>Wait a minute.! Hold it.!</i>

1378
01:35:57,630 --> 01:36:01,862
<i>Oh, God.! Ah.!</i>

1379
01:36:01,934 --> 01:36:03,697
Hold it!
Hold it!

1380
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:06,068
Wait! Wait!

1381
01:36:07,206 --> 01:36:09,265
Wait a minute! Wait!

1382
01:36:09,342 --> 01:36:12,038
Down here!

1383
01:36:14,447 --> 01:36:16,574
- Hey!
- Hey!

1384
01:36:16,649 --> 01:36:19,379
Turn back!

1385
01:36:19,452 --> 01:36:22,285
They're not gonna hear a whistle,
for cryin' out loud.

1386
01:36:22,355 --> 01:36:24,380
<i>Hey.!</i>

1387
01:36:29,695 --> 01:36:32,960
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

1388
01:36:33,032 --> 01:36:35,398
<i>- What are you doin'?
- You'll see.</i>

1389
01:36:37,537 --> 01:36:41,064
- What are you doin'?
- Yeah.

1390
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:43,472
<i>Yeah.</i>

1391
01:36:43,543 --> 01:36:45,909
<i>What are you gonna do,
shoot down the plane?</i>

1392
01:36:47,413 --> 01:36:49,847
Oh, my God.

1393
01:36:58,224 --> 01:37:00,818
It's a flare.

1394
01:37:00,893 --> 01:37:04,329
- See the flare?
- Now, turn for God sakes.

1395
01:37:04,397 --> 01:37:06,661
<i>- See it? Turn.
- Turn.! Come back.!</i>

1396
01:37:09,335 --> 01:37:11,326
Come back!
Turn around!

1397
01:37:12,872 --> 01:37:15,340
Ensign... Matowski.

1398
01:37:15,408 --> 01:37:18,866
- What?
- Herb.

1399
01:37:24,317 --> 01:37:27,115
Oh, my God.
That can't be Charlie.

1400
01:37:29,288 --> 01:37:31,222
No way.

1401
01:37:33,626 --> 01:37:35,617
- Turn the plane around.
- It's probably just...

1402
01:37:35,695 --> 01:37:38,528
- What is your problem?
- Just do it.

1403
01:37:38,598 --> 01:37:42,227
<i>- Come back.!
- Do it, baby.!</i>

1404
01:37:42,301 --> 01:37:45,031
Turn... Yes!
He's turning!

1405
01:37:45,104 --> 01:37:50,565
- Way to go!
- Whoa-ho! Ha-ha!

1406
01:38:15,731 --> 01:38:18,666
- Liz.
- Charlie.

1407
01:38:23,372 --> 01:38:26,170
- You're late.
- Yeah.

1408
01:38:26,242 --> 01:38:29,268
I had a little, uh,
trouble getting started.

1409
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:43,692
The-The plane was...
Windy, you know?

1410
01:38:43,759 --> 01:38:45,750
- Yeah. Windy on the plane.
- It made my eyes water.

1411
01:38:45,828 --> 01:38:48,729
It does that, yeah.
Oh, look at that.

1412
01:38:55,337 --> 01:38:57,328
Liz.

1413
01:38:58,674 --> 01:39:02,166
From the first moment
I saw you on that ship...

1414
01:39:02,244 --> 01:39:06,180
- it was my intention to lie to you, I swear.
- Oh, that's sweet.

1415
01:39:06,248 --> 01:39:10,184
What I didn't intend was
falling in love with you.

1416
01:39:13,923 --> 01:39:16,585
Well, okay.

1417
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:19,025
The deal is...

1418
01:39:19,094 --> 01:39:21,119
that I'm as big a liar
as you, Charlie.

1419
01:39:21,197 --> 01:39:24,496
- I highly doubt it.
- I'm broke.

1420
01:39:27,036 --> 01:39:30,972
- I'm sure you're exaggerating.
- No, I'm not.

1421
01:39:33,375 --> 01:39:37,141
Not even...
a couple hundred thousand?

1422
01:39:37,213 --> 01:39:39,613
Not even.

1423
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:42,344
Zip. Flat broke.

1424
01:39:46,322 --> 01:39:50,520
Sorry. Door's open.
It's not too late. You can leave.

1425
01:39:50,593 --> 01:39:53,027
No. I don't wanna get out.

1426
01:39:54,797 --> 01:39:56,788
I don't wanna leave.

1427
01:40:00,436 --> 01:40:03,701
Uh, how long
is all this gonna take?

1428
01:40:03,772 --> 01:40:07,868
Hah! Couple of gold diggers
comin' up empty.

1429
01:40:07,943 --> 01:40:09,934
That's terrific.

1430
01:40:10,012 --> 01:40:13,743
We still got the check
from Carswell for $18,000.

1431
01:40:13,816 --> 01:40:17,718
Wait a minute. What are you
talkin' about? I saw you...

1432
01:40:18,787 --> 01:40:21,415
You taped it?

1433
01:40:21,490 --> 01:40:24,516
What do I look like, a schmuck?

1434
01:40:24,593 --> 01:40:27,619
The jury's still out
on that one.

1435
01:40:27,696 --> 01:40:29,789
Shut up, Ma.
We're keepin' him.

1436
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,593
Thank you.

1437
01:40:39,375 --> 01:40:42,902
<i>Fifty dollars apiece
for picking up the two studs.</i>

1438
01:40:42,978 --> 01:40:46,277
<i>They ought to give you
50 bucks each for callin' 'em studs.</i>

1439
01:40:46,348 --> 01:40:48,339
<i>Herbie,
lend me 50 bucks, will you?</i>

1440
01:40:48,417 --> 01:40:50,408
<i>All I got is this check.</i>

1441
01:40:50,486 --> 01:40:52,977
<i>You're not gettin'
a nickel out of me, Charlie.</i>

1442
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:54,162
- Let me just say...
- Did you come...

1443
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:59,465
You got any, uh...
crack on you?

1444
01:44:03,812 --> 01:44:07,270
Instead... Instead of-of...

1445
01:44:07,349 --> 01:44:12,480
Instead of-of paying
for this cruise...

1446
01:44:13,689 --> 01:44:15,680
It's comin' to me.

1447
01:44:15,757 --> 01:44:20,785
See, we go to schmeer...

1448
01:44:25,534 --> 01:44:28,594
Baby, you talkin' about
humpback whales?

1449
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:30,934
- I was talking about humping, actually.
- Yeah.

1450
01:44:31,006 --> 01:44:34,373
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1451
01:44:34,443 --> 01:44:39,176
I just found us a couple
of chest butchers that'll whip it out.

1452
01:44:43,585 --> 01:44:47,021
Where were you?

1453
01:44:47,089 --> 01:44:51,355
A pas... A passenger
requested an escort, sir.

1454
01:44:51,426 --> 01:44:53,417
Indeed.
A likely excuse.

1455
01:44:53,495 --> 01:44:56,396
So I slipped her one in the lifeboat.

1456
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:06,631
Ah, shit.

1457
01:45:09,378 --> 01:45:12,245
Oh. Look who's here.

1458
01:45:20,222 --> 01:45:23,623
You better tell him, mister.
This man's got a martial arts thing...

1459
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:27,389
in black belt schmeer.

1460
01:45:27,462 --> 01:45:30,158
So if you think that some snot-nosed
little fop like you...

1461
01:45:30,232 --> 01:45:34,032
is gonna m... stop me, then...
Pinch me, Walter.

1462
01:45:34,102 --> 01:45:37,299
So if you think some snotty little fop
like you is gonna change me...

1463
01:45:37,372 --> 01:45:42,537
or me up,
then, uh, I'll it up myself.

1464
01:45:42,611 --> 01:45:46,547
Even though we've
known each other for a short time...

1465
01:45:50,953 --> 01:45:53,615
The moon... is up your ass.

1466
01:45:53,689 --> 01:45:55,816
<i>Keep looking at Dyan.</i>

1467
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:59,418
- Don't try to grab my thing.
- Oh, isn't that attractive.

1468
01:45:59,494 --> 01:46:03,294
- I wouldn't hold my thing.
- What about Walter's hand?

1469
01:46:03,365 --> 01:46:05,765
<i>Oh, Char...</i>

1470
01:46:05,834 --> 01:46:08,962
I really had a good time.

1471
01:46:09,037 --> 01:46:12,165
- I wanna tell you somethin'.
- Tell me. Tell me.

1472
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:15,403
I have never had
a better piece of ass.

1473
01:46:20,382 --> 01:46:23,647
La la la la
la la la la...

1474
01:46:23,719 --> 01:46:26,813
<i>Did I hear "cut"?</i>

1475
01:46:26,888 --> 01:46:28,549
<i>Great.!</i>

1476
01:46:29,491 --> 01:46:32,016
Dismissed.
