1
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,503
My mother always said,
"Follow your dreams

2
00:00:28,503 --> 00:00:30,004
and you'll always be happy."

3
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:31,507
My father always said,

4
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:34,509
"Don't listen to your mother.
She's not a well woman."

5
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:35,510
But she was right.

6
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,511
And these dreams
have brought me

7
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:38,012
On this particular day

8
00:00:38,012 --> 00:00:40,014
To the beautiful country
of Romania.

9
00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:42,017
Dad doesn't approve
of what I do,

10
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:44,520
So when I told him I was going
to Romania on business,

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,523
he said, "I went to Romania
once. I hated it."

12
00:00:47,523 --> 00:00:49,023
I said, "Dad,
that was world war II.

13
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:50,526
There were Nazis
shooting at you."

14
00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:52,027
He said, "Yeah,
but you get a feel."

15
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:55,029
But it's beautiful here.

16
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:57,031
It's got valleys
and castles,

17
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:58,032
Way too much cheese

18
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:01,036
and towns whose names roll off
your tongue like poetry.

19
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,541
OK, so it's a little
off Broadway,

20
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:06,542
but it's where I got to be.

21
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:09,044
Blimchuck. I have
to find Blimchuck.

22
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:10,547
Idea? No?

23
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:13,049
Blim--blim--where
movie--we're making--

24
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,553
See, I made a--I came here
through Flukshoon,

25
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:19,054
And then I had
to make a left by Peel

26
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:21,057
to get to blim-Blimchuck?

27
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:23,059
No?

28
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:25,061
Does it look like
I don't know where I'm going?

29
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:27,564
Well, I do.
Just not how to get there.

30
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,067
Which is the story
of my life, actually.

31
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:33,069
And the reason why
My wife and I are separated.

32
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:34,070
Am I getting ahead of myself?

33
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:36,072
Yeah, I do that.

34
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:37,073
Blimchuck?

35
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:39,076
Blim--do you know
where Blimchuck is?

36
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:40,077
That was... smart.

37
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:42,079
So, why am I here?

38
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,581
What do I do?

39
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:44,582
Well, I'll give you a hint.

40
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:46,083
It's called
by several names.

41
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:47,584
Animal names, actually.

42
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:50,087
Some say leech.
Some say vulture.

43
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:52,590
Some even say
scum-sucking pig.

44
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,591
No, I'm not a lawyer.

45
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:56,092
I'm an agent.

46
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:58,596
Yeah. Ever since I was
a kid, give me 5 minutes,

47
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:00,097
I could talk anybody
into doing anything.

48
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,600
Jesus Christ.

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,101
You're absolutely right,
Samuel.

50
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,603
This is delicious.

51
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:09,106
And I've been missing it
all these years.

52
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:11,108
So, about my bar mitzvah.

53
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:12,610
Anything you say.

54
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,612
And that's what it takes
to handle talent.

55
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:16,114
The power of persuasion.

56
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:18,116
When you're dealing
with a sensitive artist,

57
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:19,618
you have to inspire trust.

58
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:21,620
Cut the crap!

59
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,622
Jay, I told you.
I know I told you.

60
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:25,123
You told me
it was a club date.

61
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:26,124
It is a club date.

62
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:27,126
It's a club
and it's a date.

63
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:28,628
It's just booked
for a special occasion.

64
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:30,129
It's a wedding!

65
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,130
In the daytime.

66
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:33,131
Jay and the Americans
doing a wedding!

67
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:35,133
We're following
a limbo contest!

68
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,134
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

69
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:38,638
My biggest thrill is
discovering someone special

70
00:02:38,638 --> 00:02:40,139
And taking them
as far as they can go,

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,141
Like my new singer,
who, trust me,

72
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:44,143
Is going to be
the next Whitney Houston.

73
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:47,146
Nissan is the car

74
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:48,648
That you love

75
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:49,649
To drive

76
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:51,650
That you love

77
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,653
To drive

78
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:57,156
All right, so the auto show
isn't exactly Carnegie hall,

79
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:59,158
But if you want to make it
in show business,

80
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:00,660
You gotta pay your dues.

81
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,161
You can't do that.

82
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:04,663
That's the third time
in the last couple of months

83
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:07,166
That you've tried
to cancel my credit card.

84
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,167
Come on, I'm leaving

85
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,168
on a very important
business trip to Europe

86
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:11,170
and I need
that credit card.

87
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:14,674
My secretary sent that cheque
2 weeks ago.

88
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:16,176
She did--

89
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:18,177
Carol, you sent
that check, didn't you?

90
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:19,178
Shit, yeah.

91
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:20,680
See that? 2 weeks ago.

92
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,682
The fact that
it wasn't easy to get here

93
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:24,183
Makes it that much sweeter.

94
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:26,687
All the sacrifice
and the time away from home

95
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:28,189
And when they put my star

96
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,691
On the Hollywood Walk of Fame,

97
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:32,192
I'm going to thank my son,
who never lost faith in me.

98
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:33,694
Nick, don't look
at me that way.

99
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:35,196
I've got everything
riding on this.

100
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:37,699
It's my actor in a big movie.

101
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:39,701
Then I'm gonna take him down
to the Cannes film festival,

102
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,202
And all the big boys
are gonna be there.

103
00:03:41,202 --> 00:03:42,704
Schwarzenegger,
Van Damme,

104
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:44,707
Stallone, you know?

105
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:46,207
Seagal--
Steven Seagal?

106
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:47,208
Yeah. You like him?

107
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,209
He's really scary.
I mean, in real life.

108
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:49,710
How do you know that?

109
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,211
I saw it on
Entertainment Tonight.

110
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:53,714
That's all TV garbage.
They make that stuff up.

111
00:03:53,714 --> 00:03:54,716
Wow, so, do you think
you can sign him?

112
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:56,217
I'm a little hot
right now with Justin,

113
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:57,719
so you never know.

114
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,721
So my dad could be
Steven Seagal's agent?

115
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:00,721
Yeah.

116
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:02,222
And why not?

117
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:03,724
Because anything's
possible now.

118
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:05,727
It's just what I was
telling my wife Serena

119
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:06,728
before I left.

120
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:08,730
This is a big client
in a big movie.

121
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,731
It's the beginning
of a roll for me.

122
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:11,733
Nothing ever changes
anything, Sam.

123
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,737
We have been separated a year.

124
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:17,238
It's still your work,
your work, your work.

125
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:18,740
Nicky understands that.

126
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,741
Yeah, meanwhile I'm the one

127
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,242
Who goes to
father-and-son night.

128
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:22,744
You know,
his science project melts

129
00:04:22,744 --> 00:04:23,746
before you ever see it.

130
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:25,748
Look, look,
he's reading Variety,

131
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,249
so he's got something
to talk to you about

132
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:28,250
when you call.

133
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,752
Serena... come on.

134
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:32,754
I love him
and he knows that.

135
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:34,256
Sam, people know
you love them

136
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:36,258
when you put their needs
ahead of your own.

137
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,261
So, we talked it over

138
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:42,265
and like 2 rational people,
we came up with a solution.

139
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:44,268
Sam, I'm moving to Chicago.

140
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:46,269
What?

141
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:47,770
I'm sorry.

142
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,271
It's about Nicky.

143
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:50,773
You know, he needs
more family support

144
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:52,274
and my folks can really
help with that.

145
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:53,777
We'll move in with them.

146
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:55,779
And he's not doing
so well in school.

147
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:59,282
They have this great tutorial
programme back there...

148
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:00,783
Or let's just talk
about the fact

149
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:05,288
I--I can't get an acting job
in New York anymore, so...

150
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:07,791
I'm gonna teach drama
at my old high school.

151
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,796
I'm sorry.
I really need to do this.

152
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:13,297
So, that's my life

153
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:14,831
and the reason
I'm in Romania--

154
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:16,800
Broke, separated

155
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,302
and plugged up with cheese.

156
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:21,806
I discovered an actor
who's gonna turn it all around.

157
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:23,307
His name is Justin Allen,

158
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:24,809
my first client in a movie,

159
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:27,311
and the rest, my friends,
is soon to be legend.

160
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,313
This is so exciting.

161
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:30,313
What is?

162
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:31,315
To be here.

163
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:32,316
Big movie.

164
00:05:32,316 --> 00:05:33,317
Oh, yeah.

165
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:34,318
And I hear that
Justin's doing good.

166
00:05:34,318 --> 00:05:35,319
Good? Great!
Really?

167
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,320
Oh, the camera loves him.

168
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,322
I'm telling you,
they applauded the dailies.

169
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:39,323
I've never seen
anything like it.

170
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:40,324
Partlow!

171
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:41,827
Is there a problem, sir?

172
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:43,328
No. I'm screaming
for my health.

173
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:45,328
Have you read the script
for this movie recently?

174
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:46,830
The description
of the villain?

175
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,831
Well, I--

176
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,833
It says, right in
the stage directions.

177
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,836
It says--Stephanie?

178
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:54,339
Stephanie!

179
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:57,342
It says, "And there
on the hill...

180
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:59,343
"stands the dreaded
barbarian army

181
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:01,847
"led by a villain
so ferocious

182
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:03,348
"that the entire
Christian army turns

183
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:07,352
"and runs...
save one boy,

184
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:08,854
"whose heroism
can be measured

185
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:13,859
By the enormity
of the foe he faces."

186
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:14,860
That was very good.

187
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,864
So, what the hell is this?

188
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:20,366
"A villain so fierce
he makes an entire army

189
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:21,367
turn and run"?

190
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:25,371
Partlow...
what were you thinking?

191
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:28,374
Be scary.

192
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:31,878
Stephanie,
get them out of here.

193
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:34,881
He gave a great audition,
Larry.

194
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,382
It's not like
we didn't try.

195
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:37,884
We saw at least 100 guys--

196
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:39,887
Then see 500,
OK? See 10,000.

197
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:41,388
See every guy in this
godforsaken country,

198
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:42,890
'cause if this scene
doesn't work,

199
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:44,890
then you don't work
ever...

200
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,891
in this town again.

201
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:47,392
In Blimchuck?

202
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:50,396
Excuse me?

203
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:51,898
Sorry. Sammy Kamin.

204
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:55,401
I'm Justin Allen's agent.

205
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:56,402
Welcome.

206
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:57,403
Thank you.

207
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:58,404
Justin is brilliant.

208
00:06:58,404 --> 00:06:59,405
He's the only good thing

209
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:00,406
in this whole
messed-up picture.

210
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:01,407
Thank you.

211
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:02,408
The camera loves him.

212
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:04,410
He's gonna have
a hell of a career...

213
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,913
unlike you.

214
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:13,420
Last night,
I spit up blood.

215
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,421
Really?

216
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:15,923
Yeah.

217
00:07:15,923 --> 00:07:16,924
Where's Justin?

218
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:19,427
You're firing me?

219
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:23,932
Yeah. Well...

220
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:24,933
I'm sorry.

221
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:27,436
I discovered you.

222
00:07:27,436 --> 00:07:28,937
You weren't even
thinking about acting

223
00:07:29,437 --> 00:07:29,938
when I found you.

224
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:31,439
You were delivering
my newspapers.

225
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,942
I got you this movie.

226
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:36,444
I--I named you!

227
00:07:36,444 --> 00:07:37,947
My name was always Justin.

228
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:39,949
Schmell.

229
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:41,950
Justin Schmell.

230
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,450
I think they named
their town here after you.

231
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:44,952
Sam, I think what Justin
is trying--

232
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:47,455
Hey, dad, dad, please.

233
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,457
I feel bad...

234
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:50,458
but, honestly,

235
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,460
I think
I can do better.

236
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,462
You think you can do
better than me?

237
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:56,465
I met some people
from a big agency.

238
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:57,465
Which one?

239
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,969
Does it really matter?

240
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:02,470
Justin, we're
ready for you.

241
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,471
Look, I have to go.

242
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:05,473
No. Hey, hey, hold it.
Hold it a second.

243
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:07,476
You seriously think that
you can do better than me?

244
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:10,980
I brought you your
favourite ice-cream cake.

245
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,480
I packed it in dry ice.

246
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,983
It sat on my lap
the entire trip.

247
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:16,986
I can't have any more kids
because of this cake,

248
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:19,489
And you think that
you can do better than me?

249
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,992
Well, guess again,
Mr. Schmell.

250
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:23,493
Justin, our camera's ready.

251
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:24,494
OK.

252
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:25,997
Hold it, hold it,
Justin, please.

253
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:27,497
Come on,
what are you saying?

254
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:28,999
Don't do this.

255
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:30,500
For the sake
of your career.

256
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,501
You'll get lost
at a big agency.

257
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,003
They got everything but a heart.

258
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:34,504
Come on, don't--you don't
want to do this, do you?

259
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:38,009
Hey, look, Sammy,
I'm really sorry...

260
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:40,510
But, hey, good luck
with everything else.

261
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:50,020
They grow up so fast,
don't they?

262
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,021
Hey, Don.

263
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:53,023
Yeah?

264
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:54,525
You're next.

265
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:09,373
Goddamn it.

266
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,378
I don't believe this.

267
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:15,379
I don't believe this.

268
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:20,885
Didn't see that one coming!

269
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:44,409
Oh, shit!

270
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,420
No! No!

271
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,421
Oh, come on, god,

272
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:57,923
just give me 5 minutes,
Please!

273
00:09:57,923 --> 00:09:59,925
Oh, it's not how
I want to die.

274
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:02,428
Come on, god, please.
Can you hear me?

275
00:10:09,435 --> 00:10:11,820
Hey! This is just
a negotiation.

276
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,822
Work with me here,
please!

277
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:15,325
We're just 2 guys
talking, you know?

278
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,327
I don't accept this.

279
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:18,828
I don't want to die
like this.

280
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:20,330
I have a son.

281
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,833
I don't want him to think
that I'm a failure.

282
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:23,834
Please.

283
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:40,849
Well, there's good news
and there's bad news.

284
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,352
The bad news is...

285
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:43,854
I'm dead.

286
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:46,857
The good news is

287
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:49,360
that god himself
picked me up

288
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,363
and personally carried me

289
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:52,864
to heaven.

290
00:11:27,015 --> 00:11:28,516
Aw, shit.

291
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:31,020
Wrong heaven.

292
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:41,029
Definitely wrong heaven.

293
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:44,532
Hello?

294
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:47,535
My name is Sam Kamin.

295
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:51,540
Formerly Kaminski,
if you get my drift.

296
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:55,044
I'm in the wrong place.

297
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:57,046
Is there a concierge
or somebody I can talk to

298
00:11:57,046 --> 00:12:00,050
because there's been a mistake.

299
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:05,055
Does anyone here speak English?

300
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:07,057
Perfect.

301
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:09,559
Either I'm in heaven
or the Miami airport.

302
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,061
It is heaven, sir...

303
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:14,064
Heaven on earth.

304
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:17,567
You're at the Ministeria
Monterritomaoui.

305
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,570
I am Monsignor Papesco.

306
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,073
Monsignor?

307
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,574
Oh, thank god.

308
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:25,575
I thought I was dead.

309
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:28,079
As did we,
but you are not,

310
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,580
by the grace of god.

311
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,082
Yes. I saw him.

312
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,583
I saw god.
He appeared to me.

313
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:35,085
He pulled me
out of the wreck.

314
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:38,589
I was in a car crash

315
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:39,589
and I looked up,

316
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,592
and these huge hands

317
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:45,595
reached down
and pulled me out.

318
00:12:46,596 --> 00:12:47,598
That's it.

319
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:49,600
I'm so stupid.

320
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:53,603
I was a caesarean.
It was a flashback.

321
00:12:53,603 --> 00:12:56,106
No, no, it didn't feel
like a flashback.

322
00:12:56,106 --> 00:12:57,108
It felt real.

323
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:58,609
God is real, my son.

324
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,112
But why?
Why did he save me?

325
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:05,616
This is an important question.

326
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:07,620
You should seek the answer.

327
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,122
Where?

328
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,125
Each man's search is his own.

329
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,633
It's fate, I guess.

330
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,135
If things are meant to be,

331
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,636
they're meant to be.

332
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:26,639
Can I ask you
a personal question?

333
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,142
I mean, you choose
to live like this, right?

334
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,643
What's with these clothes?

335
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:33,145
The robes are
kind of comfortable.

336
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,147
It's the no-underwear thing
that I--

337
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,149
I don't understand.

338
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,650
I'm not used to being exposed
to the wind like this.

339
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:44,656
You know,
I'd like to be alone.

340
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,659
I'd like to walk alone.

341
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,162
I feel like
I just want to...

342
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,163
walk alone.

343
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,664
OK?

344
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,665
Thank you.

345
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,690
God...

346
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,693
It's Sammy Kamin.

347
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:21,196
You know,
we haven't spoken

348
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,197
since I did Fiddler
in high school,

349
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:27,701
but there's something
I really have to know.

350
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,204
Why me?

351
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,206
Why, with all the good people
in the world to save,

352
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,709
did you choose me?

353
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:36,211
God...

354
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:37,211
Come on...

355
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,712
If you're up there,

356
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,215
please...

357
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,218
give me a sign.

358
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:52,726
Thank you.

359
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:57,232
Oh, keep talking, baby.
Daddy's coming.

360
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,235
I'm coming! I'm coming!

361
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:01,236
Don't hang up!

362
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:09,244
Where the hell's my car?

363
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:10,745
Who's this? Oh, Hertz?

364
00:15:11,246 --> 00:15:14,250
I don't know when I can
have the car back. I--

365
00:15:16,752 --> 00:15:18,254
I'll call you back.

366
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:30,765
Either god is in
the salvage business,

367
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:32,636
or Bigfoot took my car.

368
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:43,113
Hey!

369
00:15:43,113 --> 00:15:44,615
Somebody!

370
00:18:22,276 --> 00:18:24,278
If you say
fee fie fo fum,

371
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:25,780
I'm gonna make in my pants.

372
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,282
Sam?

373
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:28,784
Max.

374
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:30,786
You saved my life.

375
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:32,788
It was you.
Thank you.

376
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:34,789
Sam! Sam! Sam!

377
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,292
Samoh mio!

378
00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:41,296
My name is Maximus Sanferescu.

379
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:42,798
I'm so happy you're well.

380
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:44,299
You speak English.

381
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,303
English, German,
Francais, Latin.

382
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:48,804
Now I speak to Sam.

383
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:51,306
Hello, Sam.
Sam, hello!

384
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:04,821
You eat.

385
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:07,323
I'm not that hungry.
I had a late gruel.

386
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:08,324
Eat.

387
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:09,826
I'll just pick.

388
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,349
Sam.

389
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:35,853
Tonight we speak
of many things.

390
00:19:36,353 --> 00:19:38,355
We speak of Mr.
William Shakespeare.

391
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:40,858
Shakespeare?

392
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:41,859
You know who he is?

393
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:44,362
Sure. He wrote
a lot of good stuff.

394
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:46,865
To be or not to be.

395
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,866
Yes! Yes!

396
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:51,368
What light through
yonder window breaks?

397
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:52,369
Very good, Sam.

398
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:54,873
To thine own self
be true.

399
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:58,376
Hey, to Mr. S.

400
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:09,387
We do more.

401
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:10,388
More?

402
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:11,890
More.

403
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:15,894
OK.

404
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:20,898
What is a man?

405
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:22,400
What has he got?

406
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,905
If not himself,
then he has not.

407
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:28,407
Shakespeare?

408
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:30,409
Sinatra.

409
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:36,916
If a man begin with certainty,

410
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,419
He shall end in doubt--
Bacon.

411
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,923
When a problem comes along,

412
00:20:42,923 --> 00:20:45,926
You must whip it,
whip it good. Devo.

413
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:47,426
I like it!

414
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:50,429
We do more.

415
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:53,934
Where did you learn
all this stuff?

416
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:55,435
The monsignor teach me.

417
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:56,937
Are you a monk?

418
00:20:56,937 --> 00:20:59,439
No. I like to talk
too much.

419
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,942
The monsignor say
better for me

420
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:02,442
to help the monks.

421
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:04,911
Sam, read to me in English.

422
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:06,746
Read to you?

423
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:10,250
You know, it's
a little late

424
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,753
and I'm tired, so...

425
00:21:12,753 --> 00:21:14,254
I think I'm gonna go.

426
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:18,757
Stay.

427
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:20,760
Please.

428
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,263
Another time.
I mean, I'm mending.

429
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:25,265
So I'm gonna go.

430
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:27,767
Listen, thanks
for saving my life.

431
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:30,771
I wouldn't know what to tip
for a thing like that.

432
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:33,273
So I'll--I'll
see you around.

433
00:21:33,273 --> 00:21:35,276
Go, Sam.

434
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:47,788
I'll tell you what.

435
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:49,791
I'll come back tomorrow.

436
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,793
OK? And we'll
have some fun.

437
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:54,296
We'll go into town.
I'll buy you lunch.

438
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:58,300
I cannot leave the monastery.

439
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,303
Why?

440
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:02,304
Because last time
when I go to the city,

441
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,306
people follow me.

442
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:06,308
They throw rocks at me.

443
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:07,809
They call me devil grotesque.

444
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:08,811
What does that mean?

445
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:09,812
The freak from hell.

446
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:20,822
Do you have family?

447
00:22:20,822 --> 00:22:24,826
My mother and my father
bring me here when I was 15.

448
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,828
They left me.

449
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:27,829
Why?

450
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:28,831
They say I'm possessed
by the devil

451
00:22:29,332 --> 00:22:32,834
Because I grow too much
too fast.

452
00:22:34,336 --> 00:22:35,837
Do you ever see them?

453
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:37,339
No.

454
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:40,343
They try to come
many times,

455
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:42,345
but I will not see them.

456
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:48,352
Maximus.

457
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:49,853
Max.

458
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:51,355
Max.

459
00:22:51,355 --> 00:22:53,357
Maybe your parents were
trying to protect you.

460
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:55,359
You know, I mean,
people...

461
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:57,362
threw rocks at you.

462
00:22:57,362 --> 00:22:58,863
They ran away from you.

463
00:22:58,863 --> 00:23:02,366
They--they shouted...
devil grotesque...

464
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:03,867
just because
all they know...

465
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:05,369
...is what they see.

466
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:06,871
And what do they see?

467
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:10,374
They see the biggest,
hugest,

468
00:23:10,374 --> 00:23:14,878
scariest-looking guy
in the whole wide--

469
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:24,888
Sam, you have stopped talking.

470
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:27,892
Do you still want me
to read to you?

471
00:23:29,394 --> 00:23:30,894
You read to me?

472
00:23:30,894 --> 00:23:33,897
Hey, you saved my life.
It's the least I can do.

473
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:37,902
What does that mean?

474
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:39,904
You are my friend.

475
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:45,910
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

476
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:48,913
"Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

477
00:23:48,913 --> 00:23:50,915
"Rough winds do shake

478
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:52,417
the darling buds
of may..."

479
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:53,918
So here I am in Romania,

480
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:55,421
reading bedtime stories.

481
00:23:55,921 --> 00:23:57,923
Usually you read bedtime stories

482
00:23:57,923 --> 00:23:59,424
about a giant.

483
00:23:59,424 --> 00:24:02,928
But I'm reading them
to a giant.

484
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:10,436
And as I watched him sleep,
it all became clear.

485
00:24:10,436 --> 00:24:14,439
I finally realized
what god had saved me for.

486
00:24:17,443 --> 00:24:18,444
Yeah?

487
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:19,445
I got him.

488
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:20,946
I got the guy.

489
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:21,947
What guy?

490
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:23,949
The villain.
He's enormous.

491
00:24:23,949 --> 00:24:24,951
How big?

492
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:26,953
Try this. 7 1/2 feet.

493
00:24:26,953 --> 00:24:28,455
But he can play 8.

494
00:24:28,455 --> 00:24:29,455
Can he talk?

495
00:24:29,455 --> 00:24:31,457
Talk? He recites Shakespeare.

496
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,462
Do you mind? This is
a private call, OK?

497
00:24:35,462 --> 00:24:36,463
And if you see the waitress,

498
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:37,964
tell her I'd like
a little more decaf.

499
00:24:38,465 --> 00:24:40,967
It sounds too good
to be true.

500
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,969
Partlow, you can't
let this guy get away.

501
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:43,970
He's unbelievable.
He's once-in-a-lifetime--

502
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,971
Partlow!

503
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:46,973
How soon can you
get him here?

504
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:48,442
I'll have him
for you Thursday.

505
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:51,311
Come on, you sweaters.

506
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:53,815
Max, I gotta tell you,
I love this simple life.

507
00:24:54,315 --> 00:24:57,318
Yes, I'm now
a man of the land.

508
00:24:57,318 --> 00:24:58,819
But after a while,

509
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:00,320
doesn't this get
a little boring for you?

510
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,322
What are you gonna do
with the rest of your life,

511
00:25:02,322 --> 00:25:03,825
Mooch around
with the animals here?

512
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:05,326
How much can you
play with the cows

513
00:25:05,326 --> 00:25:06,326
and talk to the sheep?
Come on.

514
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:08,829
I like the animals. They
don't look twice at me.

515
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:10,330
I understand that, Max,

516
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,332
But there's a big world
out there.

517
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:14,836
Places to go,
people to tower over.

518
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:17,839
Listen, you should not
hide away from it

519
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,841
Just because you think
you're too big.

520
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:21,342
I can help you.
No, I can.

521
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:23,345
I can help you do something
much more interesting,

522
00:25:23,345 --> 00:25:24,346
much more exciting.

523
00:25:24,346 --> 00:25:25,848
No, Sam.
I told you,

524
00:25:25,848 --> 00:25:27,349
I cannot leave from here.

525
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:28,850
This is my home.

526
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:32,354
Here. This one.

527
00:25:32,354 --> 00:25:33,856
I'll get this.

528
00:25:34,857 --> 00:25:36,859
Got it!

529
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:38,861
Here it is.

530
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:39,862
OK.

531
00:25:39,862 --> 00:25:41,363
You ready for the dismount?

532
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:42,866
Yes.

533
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:43,866
I don't like heights.

534
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,368
This is why I stopped
growing in fifth grade.

535
00:25:50,372 --> 00:25:52,375
Here we go.

536
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,381
Just another few inches.

537
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:00,883
OK, Max.

538
00:26:03,386 --> 00:26:04,386
Max?

539
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:05,387
Yes?

540
00:26:05,387 --> 00:26:07,389
Never mind.

541
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:10,392
Great.

542
00:26:10,392 --> 00:26:11,895
All right,
here you go.

543
00:26:12,895 --> 00:26:14,897
Thank you, Sam.

544
00:26:14,897 --> 00:26:15,898
No problem.

545
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:17,900
You do for me,
I do for you.

546
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,401
You lift me up,
I pick you an apple.

547
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:20,904
You save my life,
I show you the world.

548
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:22,405
Ba ba bing,
Ba ba boom.

549
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:23,406
What?

550
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:24,908
Ba ba bing,
Ba ba boom. Say it.

551
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:27,411
Ba ba bing,
Ba ba boom.

552
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:29,412
Great. OK.

553
00:26:29,412 --> 00:26:31,415
Hey, Max, listen.

554
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,918
I know this is gonna
sound crazy,

555
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:34,919
but I'm just gonna say it.

556
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:38,923
I could put you in the movies.

557
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:40,425
What is movies?

558
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:44,428
Shakespeare wrote stories, right?

559
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:45,930
Hamlet, Othello,

560
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,431
Henry V.

561
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:48,432
I like that one.
A lot of fighting.

562
00:26:49,935 --> 00:26:51,436
Don't be scared.

563
00:26:51,436 --> 00:26:52,938
I'm not scared.

564
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:54,940
When you read these stories,

565
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,942
do you see what the
characters are doing

566
00:26:56,942 --> 00:26:57,942
in your mind?

567
00:26:57,942 --> 00:26:58,943
Yes.

568
00:26:58,943 --> 00:27:00,445
Great.
That's perfect.

569
00:27:00,445 --> 00:27:02,446
See, movies are...
they-they're stories.

570
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:03,447
That's all.

571
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:04,949
Big stories on a screen.

572
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:07,451
Light, colour,
music, sound.

573
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:09,454
They're lifelike,
only bigger and better.

574
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:11,956
You love these movies?

575
00:27:11,956 --> 00:27:12,957
Yes. And that's my job.

576
00:27:12,957 --> 00:27:15,960
I find people to be in movies.

577
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,464
They pay for this?
They're so stupid.

578
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:21,466
You've been talking to
my father, haven't you?

579
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:23,969
Let's go, Sammy.
I don't want to be late.

580
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:25,470
Late for what?

581
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,971
There's nothing to be late for.

582
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:28,974
More gruel?

583
00:27:28,974 --> 00:27:30,976
More churning?

584
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:33,478
Yeah, can't be late
for churning.

585
00:27:40,187 --> 00:27:41,687
The room is spinning.

586
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:43,189
You're a little tipsy.

587
00:27:43,189 --> 00:27:44,190
Ah, tipsy.

588
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,692
Wait.
Have another one.

589
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:47,693
Come on.

590
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:48,695
The monsignor say,

591
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:51,198
one glass for eating,
one glass for sleeping.

592
00:27:51,198 --> 00:27:52,199
This is my last night here.

593
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:53,700
Come on, live a little.

594
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,702
There you go. OK.

595
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:03,209
OK, Max, last thing
about being an actor.

596
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,211
I know what you're thinking.

597
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:06,712
You're thinking,
"I'm too tall, Sammy."

598
00:28:06,712 --> 00:28:09,216
Right? "I'm not
the right type, Sammy."

599
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:10,217
But let me tell you something.

600
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:11,217
On a movie screen,

601
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:13,219
everybody is 40 feet tall.

602
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:14,220
No!

603
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,721
If you want to be
an actor, say the word.

604
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:18,225
No. No more actor,
movie, 40 feet.

605
00:28:20,227 --> 00:28:21,728
So stupid.

606
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:26,232
All right, that's it.

607
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:27,234
I'll stop.

608
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:28,735
I tried.

609
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:30,237
I'll just go back to America,

610
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:31,238
And I'll leave you alone.

611
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:32,739
America.

612
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:35,742
That's my home.

613
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:37,245
America is very far.

614
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:38,746
Oh, yeah.

615
00:28:38,746 --> 00:28:40,747
Galoop is in America.

616
00:28:40,747 --> 00:28:42,749
Who's Galoop?

617
00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:44,751
Never mind.

618
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:45,752
Wait, wait, wait a second.

619
00:28:46,254 --> 00:28:47,755
What's Galoop?

620
00:28:49,257 --> 00:28:51,260
Galoop is where she lives.

621
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,762
She goes so fast.

622
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:56,265
Galoop, galoop,
galoop, galoop.

623
00:28:56,265 --> 00:28:58,266
Wait, are you
talking about a horse?

624
00:28:58,266 --> 00:29:00,768
Lillianna.

625
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:09,278
Hey, look at--
is that you?

626
00:29:09,778 --> 00:29:10,778
Yes.

627
00:29:10,778 --> 00:29:12,280
Who is that, your sister?

628
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,781
No.

629
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:15,284
The girl I love.

630
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:19,288
This is from
last time I see her.

631
00:29:19,288 --> 00:29:23,792
We grow up together
in the village of Lunca.

632
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,794
She kissed me.

633
00:29:25,794 --> 00:29:27,796
I am 14.

634
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:30,299
Behind the fountain
of the virgin

635
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:32,801
at the end of the road
near my house.

636
00:29:34,304 --> 00:29:35,805
22 years, Sam.

637
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:39,309
I can still feel
her lips on mine.

638
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:41,310
I send her letters.

639
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,812
I make her poems.

640
00:29:46,816 --> 00:29:50,820
But I can never, ever
see my Lillianna again.

641
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:31,862
"Lillianna Otarro,
231 Desert View Place,

642
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:34,366
Gallup, New Mex--"

643
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,367
Galoop.

644
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,369
Galoop.

645
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:42,374
"My dearest Lillianna,

646
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,377
"the monsignor has
taught me English now

647
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,379
"so that I can write
I love you

648
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,381
"in the language
of your new land.

649
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,884
"He has also taught me
to love god,

650
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:54,385
"who I trust to protect you.

651
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,387
"I can no longer
send you photos of me

652
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,389
because it is not allowed."

653
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,893
"But remember always

654
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,896
the boy whose soul
will love you forever."

655
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,899
"Maximus."

656
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,808
What does that mean?

657
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:33,310
We will always have the sunset,

658
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,812
Lillianna and me.

659
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,815
You could have more, Max.

660
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,818
Now listen to me.
Listen carefully.

661
00:31:40,818 --> 00:31:42,820
I can walk away from here

662
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,321
and leave you forever

663
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:46,323
to talk to the cows,
play with the monks.

664
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:47,825
Whatever you want to do,
that's your decision.

665
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:49,326
But before I do,

666
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:51,829
I want you to do
something for me.

667
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:53,830
And please don't say no.

668
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,832
Because what you decide next

669
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,333
Will determine whether or not

670
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,837
You'll ever see
Lillianna again.

671
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,841
All right? Great.

672
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:10,347
This is bad.

673
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:11,849
It's OK. No one will be
in there but us.

674
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:12,850
Are you sure?

675
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,852
Promise. I told them
that you're a very famous

676
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:15,853
American film star.

677
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:17,855
You want to watch
the movie alone. Like Elvis.

678
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:19,858
Who's Elvis?

679
00:32:19,858 --> 00:32:20,859
Never mind. Come on,
it-it's starting.

680
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:21,860
This is very bad.

681
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,860
Don't worry about a thing.

682
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,862
OK?

683
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,363
Let me see. Perfect.

684
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:27,364
When you pass
the guy at the door,

685
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:29,368
You say,
"Thanks, man,"

686
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:30,870
'cause that's what
movie stars say.

687
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,371
Let's go to the movies.

688
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:33,873
This is very,
very, very bad.

689
00:32:33,873 --> 00:32:34,874
Don't worry about a thing.

690
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:35,875
Why I listen to you?

691
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,376
Come on.

692
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:49,889
It is my great honour.

693
00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:51,891
Thanks, man.

694
00:33:06,906 --> 00:33:08,407
He is so big.

695
00:33:08,908 --> 00:33:10,409
Larger than life, Max,

696
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:12,411
Just like you.

697
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:14,413
Once you're up there,
you never die.

698
00:33:14,413 --> 00:33:16,916
You live forever
on the silver screen.

699
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:27,928
You don't want
to see Lillianna

700
00:33:28,428 --> 00:33:29,930
Because she doesn't know
what you look like,

701
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,931
am I right?

702
00:33:30,931 --> 00:33:32,432
You never told her,
did you?

703
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:42,443
Once you're up there,

704
00:33:42,443 --> 00:33:45,446
the whole world
would love you.

705
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:46,949
And if the whole world
loves you,

706
00:33:46,949 --> 00:33:49,450
how could she not?

707
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,952
No more devil grotesque.

708
00:33:51,952 --> 00:33:55,455
Now, el supremo.

709
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:57,959
Il huge-o movie stario.

710
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,460
The newspapers will say,

711
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:01,963
"Romanian superstar
comes to America

712
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:05,467
to reunite with the
woman that he loves."

713
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:09,971
Max, trust me.

714
00:34:21,232 --> 00:34:22,233
Cut!

715
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:27,239
More Christians!

716
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,742
We're still rolling.

717
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:33,245
I said--

718
00:34:43,755 --> 00:34:46,258
Oh, my god.

719
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,262
Good morning.

720
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:53,265
Oh, my god.

721
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:55,268
Big enough for you, sir?

722
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:57,770
Vanquish mine enemies.

723
00:34:58,271 --> 00:35:00,773
The guy's spectacular.
I mean, look at him.

724
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:02,275
He's huge.
You want him?

725
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:03,276
Yeah, we want him.

726
00:35:03,276 --> 00:35:04,278
You're making the
right decision. Great.

727
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:05,279
Here are my terms.

728
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:07,280
5-day guarantee
at double scale

729
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,782
and a pair of first-class
tickets to America.

730
00:35:09,782 --> 00:35:10,783
Are you crazy?

731
00:35:11,284 --> 00:35:12,785
He sits on a horse.
He says one line.

732
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:15,789
OK, one day at scale,
one coach ticket to America.

733
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:17,791
How about no chance?

734
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:19,293
Do you know what
makes a hero?

735
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:21,294
The villain.
The villain makes the hero.

736
00:35:21,294 --> 00:35:22,795
The size of the villain

737
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:24,298
determines the size
of the hero.

738
00:35:24,298 --> 00:35:25,299
Without Goliath,

739
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:26,800
David is some punk
throwing rocks.

740
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,801
Am I making sense?

741
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:28,802
He's making sense.

742
00:35:28,802 --> 00:35:30,304
The sight of my guy
on that horse

743
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:32,306
saying that line--
what is that line?

744
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:33,308
Vanquish mine enemies.

745
00:35:33,308 --> 00:35:34,309
Unbelievable.

746
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:35,309
I wrote it.

747
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:36,310
Fantastic.

748
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,311
Pay him what he wants.

749
00:35:37,311 --> 00:35:40,314
Oh, the Schmells.
Hello, Schmells.

750
00:35:40,314 --> 00:35:42,317
I thought I fired you.

751
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:44,818
I have other clients.

752
00:35:44,818 --> 00:35:46,820
No, you don't.

753
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,322
Run along. I'm in the middle
of a negotiation here

754
00:35:48,322 --> 00:35:50,823
and you've got to
get ready for puberty.

755
00:35:50,823 --> 00:35:53,327
So, what is scale here?
What do we get?

756
00:35:53,827 --> 00:35:54,828
A day, 70,000.

757
00:35:54,828 --> 00:35:55,829
70,000?!

758
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,831
Romanian money.
It's about $100.

759
00:35:57,831 --> 00:35:58,832
I'll throw in a plane ticket.

760
00:35:58,832 --> 00:36:00,834
Deal. Thank you very much.

761
00:36:07,842 --> 00:36:10,345
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

762
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:11,847
That's not the rehearsal.

763
00:36:11,847 --> 00:36:14,850
I need a charge, gentlemen!

764
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,353
A charge!

765
00:36:17,353 --> 00:36:18,854
This is their hill,

766
00:36:18,854 --> 00:36:22,358
And you want it to be
your hill.

767
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:23,359
Charge up it!

768
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,360
We got a problem.

769
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,361
What's the problem?

770
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:26,862
He can't get on the horse.

771
00:36:26,862 --> 00:36:27,863
What do you mean,
he can't get on the horse?

772
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:28,864
What I mean is,
he can't get his leg

773
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:30,867
over the damn horse.

774
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:32,369
We're gonna have to bring
a winch in here,

775
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:34,870
lift him up
and lower him on it.

776
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,871
You OK with that, Max?

777
00:36:36,372 --> 00:36:38,374
No, I cannot do this.
I'm very scared.

778
00:36:38,374 --> 00:36:39,875
You're gonna be fine.

779
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:40,877
Really, it's gonna be OK.

780
00:36:40,877 --> 00:36:41,877
I gotta get him back
to wardrobe.

781
00:36:41,877 --> 00:36:42,878
They're going nuts.

782
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:43,879
OK, go with
the nice girl.

783
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:46,382
There you go.
It's gonna be OK, Max.

784
00:36:46,382 --> 00:36:48,384
Be all right.

785
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:50,386
Please, don't tell me
there's a problem,

786
00:36:50,386 --> 00:36:52,388
Because I'm developing
an aneurysm.

787
00:36:52,388 --> 00:36:53,389
It's OK.
What we need

788
00:36:53,889 --> 00:36:54,890
is something
to loosen him up.

789
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,892
You know, just a relaxer.

790
00:36:56,892 --> 00:36:57,893
That I can do.

791
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:03,400
Hello.

792
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Nick, how are you?

793
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,401
Dad!

794
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:06,402
Did I wake you up?

795
00:37:06,902 --> 00:37:07,903
No. I'm just leaving
for school. Are you back?

796
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:09,405
No, I'm...

797
00:37:10,407 --> 00:37:11,908
still in Romania.

798
00:37:11,908 --> 00:37:13,410
But I'm coming home soon,

799
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,911
And I got so much
to tell you.

800
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:16,413
Did you meet with Seagal?

801
00:37:16,413 --> 00:37:18,416
No, not yet

802
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,418
but he promised me
that he'd do it.

803
00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:21,919
That's too bad,

804
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:23,921
Because he's starting
a movie in Vegas.

805
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:25,423
Yeah, I read about it
in Variety.

806
00:37:25,423 --> 00:37:27,425
A new movie?
Is it an action movie?

807
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,428
I'm guessing, dad.

808
00:37:29,428 --> 00:37:30,929
Actually, I have to go.
Glen's picking us up.

809
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,930
Who's Glen?

810
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:32,931
He's my math teacher.

811
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:34,432
Mom went to high school
with him.

812
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:35,933
Oh, well, that's good.

813
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:37,935
He took us to a Bulls game.

814
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:38,937
Does he have good seats?

815
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:39,937
No.

816
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:40,938
Oh, good. Good.

817
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,440
Dad...

818
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,441
I don't like it out here.

819
00:37:43,941 --> 00:37:45,943
I miss my friends.

820
00:37:45,943 --> 00:37:47,445
I miss you.

821
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:48,446
Listen,

822
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:50,448
you're where you
have to be, Nick

823
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:51,949
and I'm where
I have to be.

824
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:53,951
Do you understand that?

825
00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:55,453
I guess.

826
00:37:56,954 --> 00:37:58,457
I gotta go.
He's honking.

827
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:00,459
The movie. Do you know
the name of the movie?

828
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:01,960
Coming to my birthday?

829
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,461
Of course I'll be there.

830
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:05,463
OK, the name of the movie
is Double or Nothing

831
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:07,966
and it starts shooting
in Vegas in a week. Bye.

832
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:08,967
Yes!

833
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:17,310
Quickly, quickly.

834
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,311
Max, I have new--

835
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:21,813
Hey, Sammy!

836
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:23,815
I'm no scared no more.

837
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:24,816
Oh, no.

838
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:26,318
I'm big singer.

839
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:28,321
Right.

840
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:31,325
Everybody looks so tiny
from here.

841
00:38:33,826 --> 00:38:34,827
What did you give him?

842
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:36,329
I told them to
bring him a bottle.

843
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:37,830
You gave him a whole bottle?
A whole bottle?

844
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,831
Yeah.

845
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:39,832
He's not supposed--

846
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:41,834
I'd love it if he could
stop laughing.

847
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,336
He's supposed to be mean.

848
00:38:43,836 --> 00:38:44,837
Hey, boss.

849
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:47,840
I'm flying.

850
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,841
The flying he's enjoying,

851
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:49,842
'cause he flew once.

852
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:50,843
He did Peter Pan in stock

853
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:52,345
with Jamie Farr as Hook.

854
00:38:52,345 --> 00:38:53,346
It was a fabul--

855
00:38:53,346 --> 00:38:55,348
Just shut him up
and get him on the horse.

856
00:38:55,848 --> 00:38:56,350
Gotcha.

857
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:01,355
You look fabulous
up there, Max.

858
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:03,356
OK, one line.

859
00:39:03,356 --> 00:39:04,857
Just say the one line.

860
00:39:04,857 --> 00:39:05,859
OK, you ready?

861
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:07,861
It's magic time.
OK?

862
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:08,862
Here we go.

863
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:10,364
OK.

864
00:39:10,364 --> 00:39:11,865
There he is.

865
00:39:11,865 --> 00:39:13,867
OK, stunt people,
step up.

866
00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:15,870
Ready to charge and fight.

867
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,371
Justin, are you ready
for your cue?

868
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:19,373
All right,
lock it up!

869
00:39:19,373 --> 00:39:21,875
Sound!

870
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:23,377
Roll camera.

871
00:39:23,377 --> 00:39:25,880
Giant, giant.
Raise sword.

872
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:29,884
Action.

873
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:32,886
To be or not to be,

874
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:34,889
that is the question.

875
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:36,890
I'll get it.
Max...

876
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,892
Vanquish mine enemies, Max.

877
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:40,894
Vanquish mine enemies.
Say it.

878
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:44,399
Look mean.

879
00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:46,901
OK.

880
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:48,903
OK, he's back.

881
00:39:48,903 --> 00:39:50,905
There he is.
He's all yours.

882
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:52,407
And...

883
00:39:52,907 --> 00:39:53,908
Action.

884
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:56,412
Give him the line.

885
00:39:56,912 --> 00:39:58,914
Vanquish mine enemies.

886
00:39:58,914 --> 00:40:00,916
Vanquish mine enemies.

887
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:02,917
Say the line.

888
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:05,421
O god of battles!

889
00:40:05,421 --> 00:40:06,422
Oh, shit.

890
00:40:06,922 --> 00:40:08,924
Steel my soldiers' hearts,

891
00:40:08,924 --> 00:40:10,926
possess them not with fear!

892
00:40:10,926 --> 00:40:13,429
Pluck from them their hearts!

893
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:14,931
Cut it, cut it, cut it.

894
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:15,932
Cut!

895
00:40:22,438 --> 00:40:23,940
What the hell was that?

896
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,941
I'm guessing Henry V.

897
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:27,444
Very good, Sam.
Henry V.

898
00:40:27,444 --> 00:40:29,446
Listen, with
the right editor,

899
00:40:29,446 --> 00:40:30,447
That's some good
stuff in there

900
00:40:30,447 --> 00:40:31,447
where they can cut it--

901
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:33,450
I'm gonna roll this camera,
he's gonna say that line.

902
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,950
I don't care how
you get him to say it

903
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,951
but he's gonna say it,

904
00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:38,454
because he's gonna sit on
that horse until morning.

905
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:41,957
Camera ready?

906
00:40:41,957 --> 00:40:43,960
Camera ready to roll.

907
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,961
Max, this is it now.

908
00:40:45,961 --> 00:40:48,464
You really have to do it
if you want to go to Galoop.

909
00:40:48,464 --> 00:40:50,466
I don't feel well, Sam.

910
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:52,469
What's the matter?

911
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:54,971
I'm spinning.

912
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:56,474
Lock it up!

913
00:40:56,474 --> 00:40:58,976
Sound! Roll camera!

914
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,478
Vanquish mine enemies, OK?

915
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:03,981
Very... very... tipsy.

916
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:05,483
Vanquish mine enemies.

917
00:41:05,483 --> 00:41:08,486
Justin, ready for your cue.

918
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:09,987
Action!

919
00:41:12,991 --> 00:41:13,992
Line!

920
00:41:13,992 --> 00:41:15,493
For Lillianna, Max.

921
00:41:15,493 --> 00:41:16,994
If you ever want
to see her again,

922
00:41:16,994 --> 00:41:17,995
say the line!

923
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:24,002
Vanquish mine enemies!

924
00:41:45,022 --> 00:41:46,023
Keep rolling!

925
00:41:46,023 --> 00:41:47,024
Justin!

926
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:52,030
Begone, foul demon,

927
00:41:52,531 --> 00:41:54,533
for I am the swordmaster!

928
00:42:11,552 --> 00:42:13,053
Cut. Print.

929
00:42:13,053 --> 00:42:14,555
Yes!

930
00:42:14,555 --> 00:42:16,055
You did it, Max!

931
00:42:24,064 --> 00:42:25,065
Did you see that?

932
00:42:25,065 --> 00:42:26,567
No digital stuff,
no computer.

933
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:28,569
That's how my giant prepares.
That's his process.

934
00:42:28,569 --> 00:42:29,570
You are an actor.

935
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:31,070
I feel better now.

936
00:42:31,571 --> 00:42:32,572
You, sir...

937
00:42:32,572 --> 00:42:34,073
are a genius.

938
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:35,074
Thanks, man.

939
00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:37,577
Now we go see Lillianna?

940
00:42:37,577 --> 00:42:39,313
Yeah.

941
00:43:07,808 --> 00:43:08,810
Can we see Galoop, Sam?

942
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,812
No, Max,
not from here.

943
00:43:10,812 --> 00:43:12,814
But that's my hometown.

944
00:43:12,814 --> 00:43:14,315
Incredible!

945
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:20,322
See, Max, New Yorkers
have seen everything.

946
00:43:20,322 --> 00:43:22,825
No one here looks
twice at you. See?

947
00:43:26,829 --> 00:43:28,830
What is that building?

948
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,332
Max, that's the
Empire State Building,

949
00:43:30,832 --> 00:43:32,334
one of the biggest
buildings in New York.

950
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:33,835
That's where King Kong
got killed.

951
00:43:33,835 --> 00:43:35,337
King Kong?

952
00:43:35,337 --> 00:43:37,340
Oh, it's a fantastic movie
about this sleazy promoter

953
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,842
who captures this huge gorilla,
brings it to New York,

954
00:43:39,842 --> 00:43:41,344
where he goes nuts
'cause he loves this girl.

955
00:43:41,844 --> 00:43:42,845
And...

956
00:43:42,845 --> 00:43:44,846
Lousy movie, sad,
it was terrible.

957
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:45,847
How he got killed?

958
00:43:45,847 --> 00:43:47,350
It was a climbing accident.

959
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:48,851
He was-- you know what?
Forget I brought it up.

960
00:43:48,851 --> 00:43:50,353
Come on, we got things to do.

961
00:43:50,353 --> 00:43:52,355
You haven't cast
the part yet, right?

962
00:43:52,355 --> 00:43:54,357
When's the latest I can
get him to Las Vegas?

963
00:43:54,357 --> 00:43:56,360
Friday?

964
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,361
Oh, I--I could get him
to Las Vegas by Friday.

965
00:43:58,361 --> 00:43:59,362
Trust me.

966
00:43:59,362 --> 00:44:01,364
Don't cast this part
until you've seen my giant.

967
00:44:01,364 --> 00:44:03,366
Believe me,
he's that special.

968
00:44:03,366 --> 00:44:06,370
OK? All right, I'll
get him there by Friday.

969
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,871
Good-bye.

970
00:44:08,372 --> 00:44:09,873
All right, Max.
We gotta go.

971
00:44:09,873 --> 00:44:10,874
How much?

972
00:44:10,874 --> 00:44:11,875
$52.50.

973
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:12,876
$52.50?!

974
00:44:13,376 --> 00:44:14,377
How many hot dogs
did he have?

975
00:44:14,377 --> 00:44:15,378
Well, 20 hot dogs--

976
00:44:15,378 --> 00:44:16,380
20 hot--?!
I was on the phone

977
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,381
for a minute,
for god's sake!

978
00:44:17,381 --> 00:44:18,382
And one soda.

979
00:44:18,382 --> 00:44:20,851
Jeez, this is like
owning a Saint Bernard.

980
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:23,604
Yeah, the dog lady married
the alligator man this weekend.

981
00:44:23,604 --> 00:44:24,605
Well, you know,

982
00:44:24,605 --> 00:44:27,107
she's a bitch
and he works for scale.

983
00:44:27,107 --> 00:44:28,608
No, no. I--
it's a joke, yeah.

984
00:44:28,608 --> 00:44:29,609
Oh, no. They're doing well.

985
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:31,110
Listen, I gotta
call you back, all right?

986
00:44:31,611 --> 00:44:32,111
An old friend
just walked in.

987
00:44:32,612 --> 00:44:34,114
Hey, Eddie.
How ya doing?

988
00:44:34,114 --> 00:44:35,116
Hey, Sam.
Long time.

989
00:44:35,617 --> 00:44:36,117
Hey, you look terrific.

990
00:44:36,618 --> 00:44:37,619
You look the same.

991
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:39,120
So what do you need
from the novelty world?

992
00:44:39,621 --> 00:44:40,622
Listen, I--what?

993
00:44:40,622 --> 00:44:41,623
I just signed
some singing pigs.

994
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:43,123
They're amazing.

995
00:44:43,123 --> 00:44:45,126
Now, who would have thought
a beautiful tenor voice

996
00:44:45,126 --> 00:44:46,127
Would come out of a body
like that?

997
00:44:46,127 --> 00:44:47,128
Who would have thought?

998
00:44:47,128 --> 00:44:48,129
Unbelievable.

999
00:44:48,129 --> 00:44:49,130
Maybe some other time, huh?

1000
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:50,131
All right, OK.

1001
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:51,633
Eddie, listen,
I need a favour.

1002
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:53,134
I need some work
right away,

1003
00:44:53,134 --> 00:44:54,135
like today right away,

1004
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:55,137
For a new client of mine.

1005
00:44:55,137 --> 00:44:56,639
Very special guy.
Right up your alley.

1006
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:57,639
I'm taking him to Las Vegas

1007
00:44:58,139 --> 00:44:59,641
to meet Steven Seagal
on a movie.

1008
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:00,642
Come on.

1009
00:45:00,642 --> 00:45:01,643
No, this is on the level.

1010
00:45:01,643 --> 00:45:02,644
All right,
what's he do?

1011
00:45:02,644 --> 00:45:04,146
Well, he's big.

1012
00:45:04,146 --> 00:45:05,147
They're all big.

1013
00:45:05,147 --> 00:45:06,649
No, I mean he's...
he's really big.

1014
00:45:07,149 --> 00:45:08,150
This is an amazing story.

1015
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,652
He's Romanian.

1016
00:45:09,652 --> 00:45:10,653
Lived most of his life
in a monastery.

1017
00:45:10,653 --> 00:45:11,654
Monastery?

1018
00:45:11,654 --> 00:45:12,654
In his hometown,

1019
00:45:13,154 --> 00:45:14,657
they call him
devil grotesque.

1020
00:45:14,657 --> 00:45:16,158
What's that mean?

1021
00:45:16,158 --> 00:45:17,159
I don't know.
Something from hell...

1022
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:18,661
but whatever it is,
it's not good.

1023
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:20,663
You got a picture?

1024
00:45:20,663 --> 00:45:21,664
I got better than that.

1025
00:45:21,664 --> 00:45:23,667
Max?

1026
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:25,167
Say hello
to my old friend Eddie.

1027
00:45:25,668 --> 00:45:28,670
Eddie, this is Max.

1028
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:30,672
Hello, Eddie.

1029
00:45:32,674 --> 00:45:33,676
I just wet myself.

1030
00:45:33,676 --> 00:45:34,677
All right.
Did I tell ya?

1031
00:45:34,677 --> 00:45:36,178
Jesus, he's got
a head like luggage.

1032
00:45:36,178 --> 00:45:37,680
He's got his own climate,
for Christ's sake.

1033
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,681
He's unbelievable.

1034
00:45:38,681 --> 00:45:39,682
He's amazing.

1035
00:45:39,682 --> 00:45:41,684
Wait a second.
This is perfect.

1036
00:45:42,183 --> 00:45:42,684
I got a great job for him.

1037
00:45:43,185 --> 00:45:43,686
Yeah, where?

1038
00:45:44,186 --> 00:45:44,687
- Cleveland.
- Cleveland?

1039
00:45:45,187 --> 00:45:45,689
Yeah, yeah.

1040
00:45:46,189 --> 00:45:47,190
They're looking for a monster

1041
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,692
to wrestle a bunch
of circus midgets.

1042
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:50,193
We got him a guy but
nowhere near as big as this.

1043
00:45:50,694 --> 00:45:52,195
That's not what
I'm looking for.

1044
00:45:52,195 --> 00:45:53,698
I thought money's what
you're looking for.

1045
00:45:53,698 --> 00:45:54,699
2,500 a night?

1046
00:45:54,699 --> 00:45:56,700
My giant doesn't wrestle.

1047
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,702
Well, neither do they.
They fake it, Sam.

1048
00:45:58,702 --> 00:46:00,203
I mean, your guy's
an actor, right?

1049
00:46:00,203 --> 00:46:01,705
Yeah, but this is ridiculous.

1050
00:46:01,705 --> 00:46:03,708
Oh, oh, oh. I get it.

1051
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,710
This is beneath you.

1052
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,712
This from a man
who represented a guy

1053
00:46:08,212 --> 00:46:09,714
who hand-farted the
William Tell overture.

1054
00:46:09,714 --> 00:46:10,715
Hey, he was an artist.

1055
00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:12,216
This guy is a religious man.

1056
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:13,217
I'm not doing that to him.

1057
00:46:13,217 --> 00:46:15,219
Sam, I thought
you needed the money.

1058
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:16,220
I do, I'm strapped.

1059
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,722
But there are other ways
To make it, Eddie.

1060
00:46:17,722 --> 00:46:20,224
Hey, you're right.
The post office is hiring.

1061
00:46:20,725 --> 00:46:21,727
See ya around.

1062
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:22,727
Yeah, I'll see ya.

1063
00:46:22,727 --> 00:46:25,730
Say hello to Steven Seagal.
Give him my best.

1064
00:46:28,515 --> 00:46:31,017
Here we go, Max.

1065
00:46:31,017 --> 00:46:32,520
How's that, better?

1066
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,521
Yes.

1067
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:34,522
OK.

1068
00:46:34,522 --> 00:46:36,524
I'll see you tomorrow.

1069
00:46:36,524 --> 00:46:38,025
Sam?

1070
00:46:38,025 --> 00:46:39,026
Yeah?

1071
00:46:39,026 --> 00:46:41,529
Why are you being
so nice to me?

1072
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:44,532
I like you, Max.
You're my friend.

1073
00:46:47,034 --> 00:46:50,037
Do you have many friends?

1074
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:51,540
A few.

1075
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,041
And you put them in the movies?

1076
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:55,544
No, Max.

1077
00:46:55,544 --> 00:46:56,544
It's my job.

1078
00:46:56,544 --> 00:46:59,047
I do it 'cause it
makes me feel good.

1079
00:46:59,548 --> 00:47:01,551
If I can make you
into someone important,

1080
00:47:01,551 --> 00:47:03,553
it makes me important.

1081
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:04,554
Do you understand that?

1082
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:07,557
OK, good night.

1083
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,561
You have woman?

1084
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:15,565
Go to sleep, Max.

1085
00:47:15,565 --> 00:47:17,066
She's gone.

1086
00:47:17,066 --> 00:47:19,068
Yeah.

1087
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:21,070
And you have child.

1088
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,071
Nick.

1089
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:24,574
And mother and father.

1090
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:25,574
Oh, yeah.

1091
00:47:25,574 --> 00:47:27,075
You'll meet them tomorrow.

1092
00:47:27,075 --> 00:47:28,577
And they love you?

1093
00:47:31,581 --> 00:47:32,582
Yes.

1094
00:47:32,582 --> 00:47:35,585
And this doesn't make
you feel important?

1095
00:47:37,587 --> 00:47:40,590
It would make me
feel important.

1096
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:45,595
Thank you, Sam,
for liking me.

1097
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,084
OK, Max. Here it is.

1098
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,087
The house I grew up in,

1099
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:12,090
Casa de Guilt.

1100
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:18,096
He's here.

1101
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:20,098
Sammy?

1102
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:22,600
Sammy.

1103
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,602
Hiya, ma.

1104
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:27,605
I shoulda made more.

1105
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,112
You have a nice appetite.

1106
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:35,613
I like that.

1107
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:38,617
He saved my life, pop.

1108
00:48:38,617 --> 00:48:40,118
Yeah? Good.

1109
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:42,120
Did you see how he sucked
down that herring?

1110
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,621
Like a pelican in one of those

1111
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:44,622
National Geographic specials.

1112
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:46,124
Pass him the stuffed cabbage.

1113
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:48,127
No, grandma,
not the cabbage.

1114
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,128
He gets gas,

1115
00:48:49,128 --> 00:48:51,130
he could wipe out
3 of the 5 boroughs.

1116
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:57,136
Jerry, come on.
Don't be stupid.

1117
00:48:57,136 --> 00:48:58,137
Don't say things
like that, huh?

1118
00:48:58,137 --> 00:49:00,139
Sam, don't call
your nephew stupid.

1119
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:03,142
Jerry's funny.
Why don't you sign him up?

1120
00:49:03,142 --> 00:49:05,144
He'd be funnier than
half of your clients.

1121
00:49:05,144 --> 00:49:07,147
So how is your business, Sam?

1122
00:49:07,147 --> 00:49:08,648
I'm glad you brought
it up, Uncle Nate.

1123
00:49:09,148 --> 00:49:09,648
There is a big opportunity

1124
00:49:10,149 --> 00:49:10,649
That has just come up--

1125
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:12,151
Do you know Bruce Willis?

1126
00:49:12,151 --> 00:49:14,653
I'm talking to
Uncle Nate here, Jerry.

1127
00:49:14,653 --> 00:49:17,156
It's just a simple question, Sam.

1128
00:49:17,156 --> 00:49:19,158
Yes, I know Bruce Willis.

1129
00:49:19,158 --> 00:49:20,159
I happen to be
heavily invested

1130
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:21,660
in Planet Hollywood.

1131
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,163
What did you do, run up
a big bar tab there?

1132
00:49:23,163 --> 00:49:25,665
Oh, nice.

1133
00:49:25,665 --> 00:49:27,167
Funny, pop.
That's very funny.

1134
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:29,169
Anyway, this enormous
opportunity's come up--

1135
00:49:29,669 --> 00:49:30,670
You know, my cousin Aaron

1136
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,172
was also quite tall.

1137
00:49:34,174 --> 00:49:35,676
Do you mind, mom?

1138
00:49:35,676 --> 00:49:37,678
Please, I'm trying
to discuss business

1139
00:49:37,678 --> 00:49:38,678
with Uncle Nate.

1140
00:49:38,678 --> 00:49:41,181
I have a question
for your friend.

1141
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:43,183
Yes, aunt Pearl.

1142
00:49:43,183 --> 00:49:44,184
I'm just curious.

1143
00:49:45,186 --> 00:49:46,187
How big is your--

1144
00:49:46,187 --> 00:49:48,689
Pearl!

1145
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:51,692
Well, I'd like to know!

1146
00:49:51,692 --> 00:49:52,693
Would you get her out of here!

1147
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:54,194
What did I do?

1148
00:49:56,197 --> 00:49:57,698
Don't we all want to know?

1149
00:49:57,698 --> 00:49:58,699
- No.
- No.

1150
00:49:58,699 --> 00:49:59,700
You must know.

1151
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,701
I don't know!

1152
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:03,204
Pearl, what's the matter with you?

1153
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:04,706
I'm awfully sorry.

1154
00:50:04,706 --> 00:50:06,708
My sister-in-law's
a very lovely woman...

1155
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:09,710
but she has a summer house on Pluto.

1156
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,713
I go to Galoop.

1157
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:15,716
He makes all
his own clothes, pop.

1158
00:50:17,218 --> 00:50:17,718
Yeah, he made this himself.

1159
00:50:18,219 --> 00:50:19,220
He made it?

1160
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,721
Yeah. Guess what on.

1161
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:23,223
An Obermeier, the old
pedal operated kind.

1162
00:50:23,223 --> 00:50:25,226
I collect Obermeiers.

1163
00:50:25,226 --> 00:50:26,727
Why don't you two
go downstairs?

1164
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:28,229
You can show him
the sewing machines,

1165
00:50:28,229 --> 00:50:30,665
And I'll talk to Uncle Nate.

1166
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:32,433
But it's not another loan.

1167
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:34,436
This time, it's a very
good investment.

1168
00:50:34,936 --> 00:50:36,939
This guy is going
to be a very big star.

1169
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,440
What's he gonna star in,

1170
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,443
Death of a Giant Salesman?

1171
00:50:41,443 --> 00:50:44,447
I may sell Cadillacs,
but I'm not a schmuck.

1172
00:50:44,447 --> 00:50:45,948
All right.
Wait, wait, wait.

1173
00:50:45,948 --> 00:50:48,451
Forget the 10,000.
$5,000 would be great.

1174
00:50:48,451 --> 00:50:49,452
Please.

1175
00:50:49,452 --> 00:50:50,953
Sammy.

1176
00:50:50,953 --> 00:50:52,955
If you had told me
that your son

1177
00:50:52,955 --> 00:50:54,457
needed braces on his teeth,

1178
00:50:54,457 --> 00:50:56,459
I'd reach in my
pocket like lightning.

1179
00:50:56,459 --> 00:50:59,462
But look at yourself.
Where are you?

1180
00:50:59,462 --> 00:51:00,963
Where is your family?

1181
00:51:00,963 --> 00:51:02,966
You're running around
with a glandular case,

1182
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:04,968
making a fool of yourself.

1183
00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:09,972
You're my favourite nephew
and I love you...

1184
00:51:09,972 --> 00:51:11,474
but enough already.

1185
00:51:11,973 --> 00:51:13,476
Enough.

1186
00:51:15,978 --> 00:51:18,481
Pearl, get the car!

1187
00:51:20,483 --> 00:51:22,485
Sammy?

1188
00:51:22,485 --> 00:51:24,487
Come here, come here.

1189
00:51:24,487 --> 00:51:25,988
Here, honey, take this.

1190
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:27,990
Listen, it's almost $200.

1191
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:29,992
Mom, mom, please,
I don't need your money.

1192
00:51:30,493 --> 00:51:31,995
We'll be fine.
No, no, please.

1193
00:51:31,995 --> 00:51:34,998
We'll be fine.

1194
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,501
We'll be fine.

1195
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:41,805
The Cleveland Municipal auditorium

1196
00:51:41,805 --> 00:51:44,308
And Paroni brothers
Sporting entertainment

1197
00:51:44,308 --> 00:51:45,309
Present...

1198
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:49,314
Geek night!

1199
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,817
We'll do this. We'll
make the money.

1200
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,318
We'll go right to Las Vegas.

1201
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,319
And Galoop?

1202
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,820
Absolutely.

1203
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:56,821
You're on, Sam.

1204
00:51:56,821 --> 00:51:58,823
Batman on steroids.

1205
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,826
Oh, yeah. It's terrific.
It's great.

1206
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,828
He's coming!
Yes, he's coming!

1207
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:06,332
Are you ready for the geeks?

1208
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,833
Geeks! Geeks! Geeks!

1209
00:52:18,843 --> 00:52:20,846
Go over to the ring, Max.

1210
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,847
Geek! Geek! Geek!

1211
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,851
Ladies and...

1212
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:28,353
Gentlemen.

1213
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,356
In this corner,

1214
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:34,360
Standing 4 feet,
8 inches each,

1215
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,361
which, when stacked
end to end,

1216
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:40,366
Makes a total of 28 feet tall,

1217
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:45,371
The 7... sweet little angels!

1218
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,377
You're mine.
You're mine.

1219
00:52:50,377 --> 00:52:52,878
I'll rip that ugly mug

1220
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:53,879
right off your shoulders,

1221
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,381
you tall goon!

1222
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,885
Look at this, Max.

1223
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:00,888
See, they-- they just
keep rolling.

1224
00:53:00,888 --> 00:53:03,391
Just throw them around
and have a good time.

1225
00:53:03,391 --> 00:53:05,892
Have fun with them.
OK, Max? Are you OK?

1226
00:53:06,393 --> 00:53:07,394
Then we'll get the money,
we'll go to Las Vegas...

1227
00:53:07,394 --> 00:53:08,395
and galoop.

1228
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:11,898
And in this corner...

1229
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:14,901
your worst nightmare.

1230
00:53:15,402 --> 00:53:17,904
Direct from satan's toilet,

1231
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:20,408
in his wrestling debut--

1232
00:53:20,408 --> 00:53:23,910
Mothers, hide your children!

1233
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,412
From the horrifying...

1234
00:53:25,412 --> 00:53:28,416
devil grotesque,

1235
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:30,918
the freak of hell!

1236
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:34,422
What are this?!

1237
00:53:34,422 --> 00:53:35,423
It wasn't me.

1238
00:53:35,423 --> 00:53:36,423
You told them devil grotesque?!

1239
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:37,925
I didn't!

1240
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:39,927
I swear I didn't!

1241
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:48,937
Hey, get over here.

1242
00:53:53,441 --> 00:53:54,442
What's the matter?
They love this.

1243
00:53:54,442 --> 00:53:55,943
You told them devil grotesque.

1244
00:53:55,943 --> 00:53:56,945
That's what you told me.

1245
00:53:56,945 --> 00:53:57,946
Yes, but not to tell them.

1246
00:53:58,447 --> 00:53:58,947
Oh, who cares?

1247
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:00,949
He does. It hurts
his feelings.

1248
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:01,950
Oh, yeah, like
he's so delicate.

1249
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:05,952
Please, they're hurting him.

1250
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:07,455
Oh, no, no, no.
He's just a great actor,

1251
00:54:07,455 --> 00:54:08,456
just like you said.

1252
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:09,957
Bullshit! That's not
what we talked about.

1253
00:54:09,957 --> 00:54:10,958
I'm pulling him out.

1254
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:12,460
No, you can't do that,
Sam. Wait a minute.

1255
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,962
You see those fine
gentlemen down there?

1256
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:14,963
What's up?

1257
00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:16,466
You have a contract
with them.

1258
00:54:16,466 --> 00:54:17,467
You break it

1259
00:54:17,467 --> 00:54:18,968
and they're gonna break
something of yours.

1260
00:54:26,476 --> 00:54:27,477
That's it. It's over.

1261
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:28,978
No, Sam!
I'm pulling him out.

1262
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,981
No more. It's over!

1263
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:32,982
Over!

1264
00:54:32,982 --> 00:54:33,983
Ring that bell.

1265
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:43,993
You told them devil grotesque?!

1266
00:54:43,993 --> 00:54:45,496
I did not.
I did not tell them.

1267
00:54:45,496 --> 00:54:46,997
We have a forfeit.

1268
00:54:46,997 --> 00:54:49,499
Devil grotesque cannot continue.

1269
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:50,500
No devil grotesque.

1270
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,502
No devil grotesque.

1271
00:55:00,511 --> 00:55:03,947
Let's go!

1272
00:55:04,113 --> 00:55:06,099
Come on. These guys
are not happy with us.

1273
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:07,100
Why did you tell them?

1274
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,102
I did not tell them.
I told Eddie and...

1275
00:55:09,102 --> 00:55:11,104
You said trust me,
I trust you.

1276
00:55:11,104 --> 00:55:12,105
You can trust me, Max.

1277
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:13,606
No, you tell this.

1278
00:55:13,606 --> 00:55:14,608
It's just words.
It doesn't mean anything.

1279
00:55:14,608 --> 00:55:15,609
It's like show business.

1280
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:17,611
No, Sam! It's me!
Devil grotesque.

1281
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:19,112
You believe this about me.

1282
00:55:19,612 --> 00:55:21,114
Max!

1283
00:55:21,114 --> 00:55:23,116
Max. Max!

1284
00:55:23,116 --> 00:55:24,618
You don't even know
where you're going.

1285
00:55:24,618 --> 00:55:26,121
I go home to Romania,

1286
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:28,123
Not to see you never,
no more.

1287
00:55:28,123 --> 00:55:29,624
Max!

1288
00:55:29,624 --> 00:55:31,126
Come back here.

1289
00:55:31,126 --> 00:55:32,627
Max!

1290
00:55:33,629 --> 00:55:35,130
Come here.

1291
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:37,632
Listen, that was my fault.
I take full responsibility.

1292
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:38,633
Whatever you spent,
I'll pay you back.

1293
00:55:39,134 --> 00:55:39,634
I promise.

1294
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:41,136
Get him back in the ring.

1295
00:55:41,136 --> 00:55:42,137
I can't do that.

1296
00:55:42,137 --> 00:55:43,138
Really?

1297
00:55:48,643 --> 00:55:51,646
Now find your freak
and get him back in there.

1298
00:55:51,646 --> 00:55:53,149
He's gone.

1299
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:54,650
I'll get you
somebody else, OK?

1300
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:55,651
Let's talk about this.

1301
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,653
Just give me 5 minutes,
huh? Please?

1302
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:58,654
Give him 5 minutes.

1303
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:00,156
5 minutes.

1304
00:56:02,157 --> 00:56:03,159
Now you gonna fight,
freak?

1305
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,159
Yes.

1306
00:56:08,663 --> 00:56:10,665
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

1307
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:14,170
Vanquish mine enemies!

1308
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:47,705
I asked god to forgive me

1309
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:50,707
for raising my hand
in anger.

1310
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:53,211
I'm sorry, Max.

1311
00:56:53,211 --> 00:56:56,214
I shot my mouth off about...

1312
00:56:56,214 --> 00:56:59,217
devil grotesque
and I'm really sorry.

1313
00:57:00,217 --> 00:57:03,220
I asked him
to forgive you, too.

1314
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,723
What did he say?

1315
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,725
He say OK.

1316
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:18,852
Hey.

1317
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:28,863
Dad!

1318
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,365
Get over here.

1319
00:57:31,366 --> 00:57:34,869
Oh. Oh, Nick,
I'm so glad to see you.

1320
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:36,370
Happy birthday.

1321
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,371
It's not until next week.

1322
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,372
But I brought you
an early present.

1323
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:39,373
This is Max.

1324
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:42,878
Hello, little Sammy.

1325
00:57:42,878 --> 00:57:44,379
Hi.

1326
00:57:44,379 --> 00:57:45,380
Listen, is mom home?

1327
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,381
Yeah, she's inside.

1328
00:57:46,882 --> 00:57:48,382
Great. Listen,
why don't you two guys

1329
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,385
play nicely together while
I talk to mom, all right?

1330
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:52,388
OK, I'll be right back.

1331
00:57:52,388 --> 00:57:53,890
Hey, you guys want
to play now?

1332
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:54,891
He's on my team.

1333
00:58:01,897 --> 00:58:02,898
Just a minute.

1334
00:58:02,898 --> 00:58:05,901
Hi.

1335
00:58:07,903 --> 00:58:08,403
Hi.

1336
00:58:08,905 --> 00:58:09,906
I happened to be in Chicago

1337
00:58:09,906 --> 00:58:11,908
and thought I'd drop by.

1338
00:58:11,908 --> 00:58:13,409
What happened to your face?

1339
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:15,411
Mickey Rourke.

1340
00:58:19,415 --> 00:58:20,917
Who's that?

1341
00:58:22,919 --> 00:58:23,920
Oh, that's my new client.

1342
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,922
It's a long story.

1343
00:58:25,922 --> 00:58:28,425
Can I come in and
tell you about it?

1344
00:58:28,926 --> 00:58:31,928
I get you.

1345
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:33,429
Come on, meet him.

1346
00:58:33,429 --> 00:58:35,431
Not right now.

1347
00:58:35,932 --> 00:58:36,933
Max is an amazing man.

1348
00:58:36,933 --> 00:58:39,436
Yeah, I'm sure.
Maybe later.

1349
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:43,941
So who's Glen?

1350
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:49,446
He's a nice guy.

1351
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:50,447
Oh, yeah?

1352
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:52,950
Yeah, he's just a nice guy.

1353
00:58:55,953 --> 00:58:57,454
What do you want, Sam?

1354
00:59:01,457 --> 00:59:02,959
Serena, listen.

1355
00:59:02,959 --> 00:59:05,462
I have to get him
to Las Vegas. My giant.

1356
00:59:05,462 --> 00:59:06,965
There's a movie
that's shooting there.

1357
00:59:06,965 --> 00:59:08,466
Nicky actually told me
about it.

1358
00:59:08,466 --> 00:59:09,467
I spoke to
the casting director.

1359
00:59:09,968 --> 00:59:10,468
If I can get Max there--

1360
00:59:10,969 --> 00:59:11,469
No money, Sam.

1361
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:13,471
Did I say money?

1362
00:59:13,972 --> 00:59:15,973
What else would you
be talking about?

1363
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:17,475
Not money. You did not
hear me say the words

1364
00:59:17,475 --> 00:59:18,476
"I want money."

1365
00:59:18,476 --> 00:59:19,477
I'd recognize my voice.

1366
00:59:19,477 --> 00:59:21,980
I did not say I want money.

1367
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,982
I need the rings.

1368
00:59:23,982 --> 00:59:26,485
The rings.

1369
00:59:26,986 --> 00:59:28,988
They were my father's
and they were given to me.

1370
00:59:29,488 --> 00:59:31,489
For safekeeping.
To be given to your son.

1371
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:32,490
They're called heirlooms.

1372
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,992
I need to borrow them.

1373
00:59:34,492 --> 00:59:35,995
They're Nicky's.

1374
00:59:35,995 --> 00:59:37,997
I'm broke.

1375
00:59:37,997 --> 00:59:41,000
OK? I have nothing.

1376
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,501
I am busted.

1377
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:45,504
I'll get 'em back to you.

1378
00:59:45,504 --> 00:59:49,008
You know the funny thing, Sam,

1379
00:59:49,008 --> 00:59:52,011
I thought you came here
because you missed us.

1380
00:59:52,011 --> 00:59:55,013
That's why I thought
you came with...

1381
00:59:55,013 --> 00:59:56,015
your giant.

1382
00:59:56,515 --> 00:59:59,018
Serena, Serena.
I miss you.

1383
00:59:59,018 --> 01:00:00,518
Of course I miss you.

1384
01:00:00,518 --> 01:00:02,520
Mom?

1385
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,024
Give dad the rings.

1386
01:00:05,024 --> 01:00:07,026
I don't need them.

1387
01:00:16,253 --> 01:00:17,254
You buy something, Sam?

1388
01:00:17,254 --> 01:00:18,755
Yeah, bus fare.

1389
01:00:19,256 --> 01:00:20,757
Taxi!

1390
01:00:20,757 --> 01:00:21,758
Come on.

1391
01:00:24,262 --> 01:00:26,264
An adult and a child
for Las Vegas, please.

1392
01:00:26,264 --> 01:00:29,267
I'm kidding.
2 for Las Vegas, please.

1393
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:30,267
Galoop, Sam.

1394
01:00:30,767 --> 01:00:31,768
First Vegas, then Galoop.

1395
01:00:31,768 --> 01:00:32,769
But you say--

1396
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:33,770
Max, please, please.

1397
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:34,772
2 for Las Vegas.

1398
01:00:34,772 --> 01:00:36,774
Galoop.

1399
01:00:36,774 --> 01:00:39,777
Give us a second, please?

1400
01:00:39,777 --> 01:00:42,280
Come over here.

1401
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,283
We have to go to Las Vegas first.

1402
01:00:45,283 --> 01:00:46,784
We go to Vegas first.

1403
01:00:46,784 --> 01:00:48,286
It's on the way to Galoop.

1404
01:00:48,286 --> 01:00:49,787
The movie is in Las Vegas,

1405
01:00:50,288 --> 01:00:51,289
And we don't want
to be messing around.

1406
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:54,292
I want to see Lillianna first.

1407
01:00:55,293 --> 01:00:56,794
Sit down.

1408
01:00:58,796 --> 01:01:00,297
Sit down.

1409
01:01:00,297 --> 01:01:02,299
Are you famous yet?

1410
01:01:02,299 --> 01:01:03,801
I don't know.

1411
01:01:03,801 --> 01:01:04,802
What did we say?

1412
01:01:04,802 --> 01:01:06,304
We said you'd meet her
when you were famous.

1413
01:01:06,304 --> 01:01:07,805
That was the agreement.

1414
01:01:07,805 --> 01:01:09,307
When will I be famous?

1415
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:14,312
OK, we'll call her.

1416
01:01:14,312 --> 01:01:15,313
OK? We'll call her.

1417
01:01:15,313 --> 01:01:16,314
We'll tell her
that you're here,

1418
01:01:16,314 --> 01:01:17,815
That you're on your
way to see her, OK?

1419
01:01:17,815 --> 01:01:19,317
We can do?

1420
01:01:23,822 --> 01:01:25,824
Max, this is just a letter.

1421
01:01:25,824 --> 01:01:27,326
This is just her address.

1422
01:01:27,326 --> 01:01:28,828
There's no phone number here.

1423
01:01:28,828 --> 01:01:30,329
We no can call?

1424
01:01:32,832 --> 01:01:34,334
We'll call information.

1425
01:01:34,334 --> 01:01:36,336
Right? We'll call Information.

1426
01:01:36,336 --> 01:01:38,338
Is she still living here?

1427
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:40,340
When was the last time
she wrote to you?

1428
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,341
She don't write.

1429
01:01:41,842 --> 01:01:43,344
She don't write?

1430
01:01:43,344 --> 01:01:44,344
No.

1431
01:01:44,344 --> 01:01:46,346
Never?

1432
01:01:46,346 --> 01:01:48,348
And you've been
writing to her for...

1433
01:01:48,348 --> 01:01:49,849
22 years.

1434
01:01:51,851 --> 01:01:54,321
In Galoop... in Gallup,

1435
01:01:54,321 --> 01:01:55,805
Miss Lillianna Otarro,

1436
01:01:55,805 --> 01:01:58,308
231 Desert View Place.

1437
01:01:58,807 --> 01:02:00,809
It's a good thing you have
a relationship with god, Max.

1438
01:02:00,809 --> 01:02:02,312
We may need his Rolodex.

1439
01:02:02,312 --> 01:02:03,813
What?

1440
01:02:03,813 --> 01:02:07,317
An L.J. Otarro
on Wonder View Terrace.

1441
01:02:07,317 --> 01:02:09,319
All right,
let's try that.

1442
01:02:09,319 --> 01:02:11,822
Could you connect me?
Thank you.

1443
01:02:12,323 --> 01:02:13,823
Max, don't get
your hopes up.

1444
01:02:13,823 --> 01:02:16,326
It may not be
the right person.

1445
01:02:16,326 --> 01:02:17,327
You never know about
these things, you know?

1446
01:02:17,327 --> 01:02:18,328
Hello.

1447
01:02:18,328 --> 01:02:20,831
Hello.

1448
01:02:20,831 --> 01:02:22,333
Who's calling?

1449
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:23,834
One second, please.

1450
01:02:23,834 --> 01:02:24,835
Do you want to talk?

1451
01:02:24,835 --> 01:02:26,337
No, no, no, no, no.

1452
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:29,339
Is this Lillianna Otarro?

1453
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:30,841
Yes.

1454
01:02:31,342 --> 01:02:33,344
Are you from Romania?

1455
01:02:33,344 --> 01:02:34,845
Yes.

1456
01:02:34,845 --> 01:02:37,848
I have a giant surprise
for you.

1457
01:02:37,848 --> 01:02:42,355
I'm calling for your old
friend Maximus Sanferescu.

1458
01:02:43,855 --> 01:02:48,859
He's in Chicago right now
and yes, he is,

1459
01:02:48,859 --> 01:02:51,863
but he's on his way to
Las Vegas to be in a movie.

1460
01:02:51,863 --> 01:02:53,865
Yes, he's an actor.

1461
01:02:53,865 --> 01:02:56,368
Please hang up.
This is a recording.

1462
01:02:56,368 --> 01:02:57,868
He's crazy about you.

1463
01:02:57,868 --> 01:03:00,372
I agree.
He remembers that kiss.

1464
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:05,377
Right, behind the
fountain of the virgin.

1465
01:03:05,377 --> 01:03:08,380
Well, you didn't forget
it either, did you?

1466
01:03:09,382 --> 01:03:12,385
Well, he would like
to come visit you.

1467
01:03:12,385 --> 01:03:14,386
Oh, that's a bummer.

1468
01:03:14,386 --> 01:03:16,888
Oh, for how long?

1469
01:03:16,888 --> 01:03:19,892
Couple of days.
Well, listen, Lillianna,

1470
01:03:19,892 --> 01:03:21,894
We will call you
and we'll--we'll hook up

1471
01:03:21,894 --> 01:03:23,896
in Gallup, OK?

1472
01:03:23,896 --> 01:03:26,899
It was lovely talking
to you, too, Lillianna.

1473
01:03:26,899 --> 01:03:29,402
I will tell him. OK.

1474
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:31,404
All right. Good-bye.

1475
01:03:31,404 --> 01:03:32,405
Here.

1476
01:03:32,405 --> 01:03:33,406
She wants to see me?

1477
01:03:33,406 --> 01:03:34,907
Yes, but she's gonna be gone

1478
01:03:34,907 --> 01:03:36,409
for a couple of days.

1479
01:03:36,409 --> 01:03:37,911
But she want to see me?

1480
01:03:37,911 --> 01:03:40,914
Yeah, Max. How could
she not? Come on.

1481
01:03:40,914 --> 01:03:41,915
And the kiss, Sam?

1482
01:03:41,915 --> 01:03:44,417
What she say about the kiss?

1483
01:03:44,417 --> 01:03:45,918
That she'll never forget it.

1484
01:03:46,418 --> 01:03:47,419
Come on.

1485
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,422
Oh, Sam.

1486
01:03:50,923 --> 01:03:53,427
Yep, that's what she said.

1487
01:03:53,427 --> 01:03:55,429
I'm so happy.

1488
01:03:57,931 --> 01:03:59,433
Isn't that nice?

1489
01:04:02,936 --> 01:04:04,438
- Sam?
- Yeah.

1490
01:04:04,438 --> 01:04:06,940
Tell me again. What
she say about the kiss?

1491
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,943
Max, you know what she said.

1492
01:04:08,943 --> 01:04:10,445
That she never forget.

1493
01:04:10,445 --> 01:04:12,946
That's right.

1494
01:04:12,946 --> 01:04:14,448
Thank you.

1495
01:04:43,478 --> 01:04:45,980
Max? Max, wake up.

1496
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:46,981
What?

1497
01:04:46,981 --> 01:04:48,983
I want you to see something.

1498
01:04:48,983 --> 01:04:51,486
Look.

1499
01:04:54,489 --> 01:04:56,491
It is miracle.

1500
01:04:56,491 --> 01:04:59,494
The miracle is we got here.

1501
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:08,505
Wait till you see
the buffets, Max.

1502
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:11,507
Do the words
"all you can eat"

1503
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,510
mean anything to you?

1504
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,513
Hey, hey, hey!

1505
01:05:24,522 --> 01:05:27,023
This is show business, Max.

1506
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:38,536
And... cut!

1507
01:05:38,536 --> 01:05:40,037
That's a cut!

1508
01:05:40,037 --> 01:05:41,037
OK, great.

1509
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:42,538
OK, come on, guys,
gather around.

1510
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:44,541
Steven, that was really
great, but I think

1511
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:47,043
We can do just a little
bit better, don't you?

1512
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,044
No.

1513
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,546
OK, that was perfect, everybody.

1514
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,481
New deal.
We're moving on.

1515
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:53,049
What do you mean,
"cast"?

1516
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:54,552
It wasn't cast
a couple of days ago!

1517
01:05:54,552 --> 01:05:55,552
Please.

1518
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:57,053
But I called!
We came all this way!

1519
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:59,055
I asked specifically,
"Do you need a big villain?"

1520
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:01,057
'Cause that's what I got!
I got the biggest!

1521
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:02,058
We don't need, capisce?
Case closed.

1522
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:03,561
- Can I at least show him to you?
- No.

1523
01:06:03,561 --> 01:06:04,562
Let me show him to the director.

1524
01:06:04,562 --> 01:06:06,564
Don't bother him.
We're in a meal penalty.

1525
01:06:06,564 --> 01:06:08,065
You tell me I'm wrong
and I go away.

1526
01:06:08,566 --> 01:06:10,067
But if Steven Seagal
finds out

1527
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:11,067
That you blew this opportunity,

1528
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,068
it's on your head.

1529
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:13,070
How big is he?

1530
01:06:13,571 --> 01:06:14,572
Around 8 feet and he can act.
You got a script?

1531
01:06:14,572 --> 01:06:15,573
No lines.

1532
01:06:15,573 --> 01:06:17,074
The bad guy's just an action part.
Excuse me.

1533
01:06:17,575 --> 01:06:19,077
That's perfect, 'cause,
now, what do you need?

1534
01:06:19,077 --> 01:06:21,079
You need a big, scary guy
and that's what I have.

1535
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:23,082
The biggest and scariest
guy of all time,

1536
01:06:23,082 --> 01:06:24,584
and he's sitting
right over there.

1537
01:06:24,584 --> 01:06:27,085
Max, stand up!

1538
01:06:27,085 --> 01:06:28,587
All the way up.
Don't slouch.

1539
01:06:29,087 --> 01:06:30,589
How about that, guys?

1540
01:06:30,589 --> 01:06:32,090
Big enough?

1541
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:33,092
He's unbelievable!

1542
01:06:33,092 --> 01:06:34,594
Oh, yeah, you see?
He's big.

1543
01:06:37,096 --> 01:06:39,098
Mr. Seagal, this is...
a pleasure to meet you.

1544
01:06:39,098 --> 01:06:40,598
I'm Sam Kamin.
I'm Max the giant's agent.

1545
01:06:41,098 --> 01:06:43,101
You... have your
elbow in his salad.

1546
01:06:44,603 --> 01:06:45,604
Sorry.

1547
01:06:45,604 --> 01:06:47,606
Steven, what do you think
about him as the bad guy?

1548
01:06:47,606 --> 01:06:48,607
The fact of the matter is

1549
01:06:48,607 --> 01:06:49,608
that he's much bigger than me

1550
01:06:49,608 --> 01:06:50,609
and as you know,
that's not good.

1551
01:06:51,109 --> 01:06:51,611
- Good.
- May I, sir?

1552
01:06:52,111 --> 01:06:53,112
Isn't that actually the point?

1553
01:06:53,112 --> 01:06:54,614
I don't think so.

1554
01:06:54,614 --> 01:06:56,615
No, see, I have this theory
about heroes and villains--

1555
01:06:56,615 --> 01:06:59,117
I know. Look, let's
not forget about Roy.

1556
01:06:59,117 --> 01:07:00,118
I mean, the fact
of the matter is

1557
01:07:00,118 --> 01:07:01,119
we did offer him
the part.

1558
01:07:01,621 --> 01:07:02,121
That's right.
There's Roy.

1559
01:07:02,622 --> 01:07:03,122
Who's Roy?

1560
01:07:03,623 --> 01:07:04,624
Steven's best friend.

1561
01:07:04,624 --> 01:07:06,626
He's our head stuntman
and he's got the role.

1562
01:07:06,626 --> 01:07:08,127
Come on, he's a stuntman.

1563
01:07:08,127 --> 01:07:10,128
With all due respect,
probably a great one,

1564
01:07:10,128 --> 01:07:11,631
but now, stuntmen stunt.

1565
01:07:11,631 --> 01:07:13,633
He acts! My giant
can do Shakespeare!

1566
01:07:13,633 --> 01:07:15,134
Shakespeare.

1567
01:07:15,134 --> 01:07:17,136
Every word.

1568
01:07:17,136 --> 01:07:18,638
I've always wanted
to do Shakespeare.

1569
01:07:18,638 --> 01:07:20,139
You would be a great
Shakespearean actor.

1570
01:07:20,139 --> 01:07:21,642
Matter of fact,
you and Max together

1571
01:07:22,142 --> 01:07:23,644
in this movie...
would be great

1572
01:07:23,644 --> 01:07:25,645
doing Shakespeare together.
Can you see it?

1573
01:07:25,645 --> 01:07:27,146
No. This is
a story about a man

1574
01:07:27,146 --> 01:07:28,147
who's trying
to stop terrorists

1575
01:07:28,147 --> 01:07:29,649
from blowing up
the Las Vegas strip.

1576
01:07:29,649 --> 01:07:30,651
Now if you'll excuse me--

1577
01:07:30,651 --> 01:07:32,153
But, sir...

1578
01:07:32,153 --> 01:07:33,655
You don't see how Shakespeare

1579
01:07:33,655 --> 01:07:35,156
can fall into that script idea?

1580
01:07:35,156 --> 01:07:36,658
- No. - Oh, come on!
It's easy!

1581
01:07:37,158 --> 01:07:38,158
You got this huge villain,

1582
01:07:38,158 --> 01:07:39,158
the world's biggest terrorist.

1583
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:40,160
He's huge.

1584
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:41,662
- Scary.
- Oh, scary.

1585
01:07:42,162 --> 01:07:43,163
And he's planting bombs

1586
01:07:43,163 --> 01:07:44,665
all over the strip, right?

1587
01:07:44,665 --> 01:07:46,667
But he's sending
messages to you...

1588
01:07:46,667 --> 01:07:48,168
in Iambic pentameter.

1589
01:07:48,168 --> 01:07:49,169
Great.

1590
01:07:49,169 --> 01:07:50,672
If he can eliminate you...

1591
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:52,173
with the Shakespeare...

1592
01:07:52,173 --> 01:07:53,174
See, he can be "to be"

1593
01:07:53,174 --> 01:07:54,174
and you are "not to be"

1594
01:07:54,174 --> 01:07:55,175
because he doesn't
want you to be.

1595
01:07:55,676 --> 01:07:56,176
Right.

1596
01:07:56,677 --> 01:07:57,678
But you have to stop that, see?

1597
01:07:57,678 --> 01:07:58,679
Because he loves Shakespeare

1598
01:07:59,179 --> 01:08:00,682
and blowing up stuff.

1599
01:08:00,682 --> 01:08:02,183
Max, do Henry V.

1600
01:08:02,183 --> 01:08:03,184
What?

1601
01:08:03,184 --> 01:08:04,686
Do Henry V!
He's...

1602
01:08:04,686 --> 01:08:06,688
You don't like it, Sam.
Remember?

1603
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:08,189
We got to get back to work.

1604
01:08:08,189 --> 01:08:09,691
Wait, wait, wait,
wait a second.

1605
01:08:09,691 --> 01:08:11,192
Max, listen to me.

1606
01:08:11,192 --> 01:08:13,695
You got to do it
like you did before.

1607
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,696
If you don't do it now,

1608
01:08:14,696 --> 01:08:16,197
you can kiss
Galoop good-bye.

1609
01:08:16,698 --> 01:08:18,700
Please! Now is the time--

1610
01:08:19,201 --> 01:08:21,203
Sammy was your name,
right? We got to go.

1611
01:08:21,704 --> 01:08:22,705
Please.

1612
01:08:22,705 --> 01:08:23,705
Do it.

1613
01:08:25,206 --> 01:08:27,709
O god of battles!

1614
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:30,212
Steel my soldiers' hearts,

1615
01:08:30,212 --> 01:08:32,715
possess them not with fear!

1616
01:08:32,715 --> 01:08:35,718
For he who sheds
his blood with me

1617
01:08:35,718 --> 01:08:37,719
shall be my brother.

1618
01:08:45,227 --> 01:08:47,229
Screw Roy.

1619
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:48,231
Roy is out.

1620
01:08:48,231 --> 01:08:50,233
Roy's gone.

1621
01:08:50,233 --> 01:08:51,234
OK. See you around.

1622
01:08:51,234 --> 01:08:53,235
Thank you very much, man.

1623
01:08:53,235 --> 01:08:54,236
Max, great!

1624
01:08:54,236 --> 01:08:55,237
Mr. Seagal, first of all,

1625
01:08:55,237 --> 01:08:57,239
Thank you from the bottom
of my heart. This is...

1626
01:08:57,239 --> 01:08:59,242
Will you just give me
5 minutes? You'd make me

1627
01:08:59,242 --> 01:09:00,243
the happiest man in the world.

1628
01:09:00,744 --> 01:09:01,678
You got it.

1629
01:09:05,799 --> 01:09:06,299
Hello?

1630
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,802
Is this Nick Kamin?

1631
01:09:07,802 --> 01:09:09,302
Yeah. Who's this?

1632
01:09:09,302 --> 01:09:11,805
Hi. This is Steven Seagal.
How are you?

1633
01:09:11,805 --> 01:09:14,307
Nice try, dad, but his voice
is a little bit raspier.

1634
01:09:14,307 --> 01:09:16,309
No, this is
Steven Seagal, really.

1635
01:09:16,309 --> 01:09:18,312
Oh, really, Steve?

1636
01:09:18,312 --> 01:09:20,314
Great, 'cause I want to
tell you a couple of things.

1637
01:09:20,314 --> 01:09:21,816
You're a huge wimp

1638
01:09:21,816 --> 01:09:23,817
with a big, stupid ponytail.

1639
01:09:24,317 --> 01:09:26,821
Yeah, and have you ever
heard of acting lessons?

1640
01:09:26,821 --> 01:09:28,322
You really might
want to try taking some.

1641
01:09:28,322 --> 01:09:30,324
Oh, by the way,
when you talk,

1642
01:09:30,825 --> 01:09:32,326
try clearing the phlegm
out of your throat.

1643
01:09:32,827 --> 01:09:34,327
Just spit it up already.

1644
01:09:34,827 --> 01:09:35,829
Well...

1645
01:09:35,829 --> 01:09:37,331
Thank you very much.

1646
01:09:37,331 --> 01:09:38,832
You know, I can see

1647
01:09:38,832 --> 01:09:40,333
that your father's
raised you very well.

1648
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:41,835
You're a very polite
young man

1649
01:09:41,835 --> 01:09:44,337
and I'm hoping that we can
get together someday soon.

1650
01:09:44,838 --> 01:09:46,340
Oh, pretty cool.
Hanging out with Stallone

1651
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:48,342
so I can understand
you both less?

1652
01:09:48,342 --> 01:09:50,344
So let's get rid of the mumble.

1653
01:09:50,344 --> 01:09:51,345
OK. God bless you.

1654
01:09:51,345 --> 01:09:52,345
Bye.

1655
01:09:52,345 --> 01:09:53,346
Dad?

1656
01:09:53,346 --> 01:09:54,347
Wow.

1657
01:09:54,848 --> 01:09:56,351
What did he say?

1658
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,352
He loves me.

1659
01:09:57,352 --> 01:09:58,353
Dad?

1660
01:09:58,854 --> 01:09:59,855
Dad.

1661
01:10:02,858 --> 01:10:03,859
Shit.

1662
01:10:03,859 --> 01:10:05,361
- Mr. Kamin.
- Yes. Hi.

1663
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:07,863
I've been asked to take you
to Caesar's Palace.

1664
01:10:07,863 --> 01:10:08,864
You'll be meeting
with the producers

1665
01:10:08,864 --> 01:10:09,865
tomorrow evening at 10:00.

1666
01:10:09,865 --> 01:10:12,367
Look over these papers.
W-2, social security,

1667
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:14,369
And these forms are
for the insurance exam

1668
01:10:14,369 --> 01:10:15,872
we need to do for doing
any stunt work.

1669
01:10:15,872 --> 01:10:16,873
That's up first thing
in the morning.

1670
01:10:16,873 --> 01:10:18,875
Insurance exam? We don't
have a deal yet.

1671
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:20,376
It's not my area, sir.
I guess it's what

1672
01:10:20,376 --> 01:10:21,877
you talk about
tomorrow at 10:00.

1673
01:10:21,877 --> 01:10:23,378
Yeah. Thanks a lot. Bye.

1674
01:10:23,378 --> 01:10:25,882
Steven! I can't tell you
how excited we are.

1675
01:10:25,882 --> 01:10:27,884
This whole thing is
such--it's amazing,

1676
01:10:28,384 --> 01:10:30,887
So we love it.
Thank you.

1677
01:10:30,887 --> 01:10:31,888
See ya.

1678
01:10:33,388 --> 01:10:34,390
Mr. Kamin.

1679
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:35,391
Wow.

1680
01:10:35,391 --> 01:10:37,392
Yes. Hey, there he is.

1681
01:10:37,392 --> 01:10:38,393
I do good, Sam?

1682
01:10:38,894 --> 01:10:39,895
You did great, Max.

1683
01:10:39,895 --> 01:10:41,396
Yes!

1684
01:10:41,396 --> 01:10:42,898
You're in a movie, Max!

1685
01:10:42,898 --> 01:10:44,400
You're gonna be in a movie!

1686
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,902
And then we're
gonna go to galoop!

1687
01:10:45,902 --> 01:10:48,521
Come on, let's
hit those buffets!

1688
01:10:51,523 --> 01:10:54,527
He's got fingers
as big as pickles.

1689
01:10:54,527 --> 01:10:56,029
You want to meet him?

1690
01:10:56,029 --> 01:10:57,530
His head touches the ceiling

1691
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:59,532
and he's gonna be
in this big movie

1692
01:10:59,532 --> 01:11:01,034
with Steven Seagal.

1693
01:11:01,034 --> 01:11:03,036
And when did you start
growing like this?

1694
01:11:03,537 --> 01:11:06,040
14.

1695
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,041
And how old are you now?

1696
01:11:08,041 --> 01:11:09,043
36.

1697
01:11:10,544 --> 01:11:13,047
Good. Well, I'll
see you in a minute.

1698
01:11:14,549 --> 01:11:16,551
But you're not saying
he can't do the movie?

1699
01:11:16,551 --> 01:11:18,053
No. I'm merely saying
I can't sign off

1700
01:11:18,553 --> 01:11:19,554
on these insurance forms.

1701
01:11:19,554 --> 01:11:21,555
Given his EKG, the exertion
could be dangerous.

1702
01:11:21,555 --> 01:11:23,058
How can this be?

1703
01:11:23,058 --> 01:11:24,559
This guy is
as strong as an ox.

1704
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:26,061
He's a giant,
for god's sake.

1705
01:11:26,061 --> 01:11:28,563
Exactly.

1706
01:11:28,563 --> 01:11:30,564
Mr. Kamin, have you
ever seen an old giant?

1707
01:11:31,065 --> 01:11:33,068
What?

1708
01:11:33,068 --> 01:11:34,569
They have a hormonal imbalance

1709
01:11:34,569 --> 01:11:36,570
that causes a heart condition.

1710
01:11:37,071 --> 01:11:38,572
I believe Max has one.

1711
01:11:43,578 --> 01:11:46,081
Are you a heart specialist?

1712
01:11:46,081 --> 01:11:47,582
No, but I intend
to fax his EKG

1713
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:49,584
to a heart specialist
and I'd like to--

1714
01:11:49,584 --> 01:11:51,085
Listen,
don't bother, OK?

1715
01:11:51,085 --> 01:11:52,587
Because I don't buy it.

1716
01:11:52,587 --> 01:11:54,589
"Ever see an old giant"!

1717
01:11:54,589 --> 01:11:56,091
What is that,
a trick question?

1718
01:11:56,091 --> 01:11:58,093
There are always
second opinions.

1719
01:11:58,093 --> 01:11:59,094
And I'm gonna get one.

1720
01:11:59,594 --> 01:12:01,597
And I'm sure you'll find
your way to a doctor

1721
01:12:02,098 --> 01:12:03,099
who, for the right fee,

1722
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:05,101
will give you his signature
on these insurance forms.

1723
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:07,602
No. I will just find
a better doctor.

1724
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:14,610
Hey, Max.

1725
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:16,112
How you doing?

1726
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:29,125
Hello?

1727
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:31,128
Is this Lillianna Otarro?

1728
01:12:31,128 --> 01:12:32,129
Yes.

1729
01:12:32,129 --> 01:12:34,131
I spoke to you
the other day.

1730
01:12:34,131 --> 01:12:36,132
I'm calling for
Maximus Sanferescu.

1731
01:12:46,943 --> 01:12:50,447
A 3-week guarantee
At 2,500 a week?

1732
01:12:50,447 --> 01:12:52,449
I think that's a nice offer.

1733
01:12:52,449 --> 01:12:54,451
I said
I'll think about it.

1734
01:12:56,453 --> 01:12:58,455
All right, so we'll
come up to 3.

1735
01:12:58,455 --> 01:13:00,958
3 grand a week,
a month guaranteed.

1736
01:13:04,462 --> 01:13:06,463
And a bump if it goes
to a TV series.

1737
01:13:06,463 --> 01:13:07,964
You've heard of
The Incredible hulk?

1738
01:13:07,964 --> 01:13:09,967
Do you know what
Ferrigno made on that?

1739
01:13:09,967 --> 01:13:12,470
We see a huge career
for this guy.

1740
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,972
I'll think about it.

1741
01:13:14,972 --> 01:13:16,974
What, you think we need
this guy or something?

1742
01:13:17,475 --> 01:13:18,976
No, I understand.

1743
01:13:18,976 --> 01:13:19,977
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1744
01:13:19,977 --> 01:13:21,979
Wait a minute.
Hold on. The point is...

1745
01:13:21,979 --> 01:13:23,981
...we want him.
I mean, the image of

1746
01:13:23,981 --> 01:13:25,483
this big, stupid beast
spouting Shakespeare--

1747
01:13:25,483 --> 01:13:26,983
"Big, stupid beast"?

1748
01:13:26,983 --> 01:13:28,485
Well, he looks stupid.

1749
01:13:28,485 --> 01:13:30,988
He speaks 5 languages.
How many do you speak?

1750
01:13:30,988 --> 01:13:31,989
Hey, settle down--

1751
01:13:31,989 --> 01:13:33,491
Don't call him stupid!

1752
01:13:33,491 --> 01:13:34,992
I'm sorry. It was
a slip of the tongue.

1753
01:13:34,992 --> 01:13:36,494
Look, Sam...

1754
01:13:36,494 --> 01:13:37,995
Sammy...

1755
01:13:37,995 --> 01:13:39,498
I'll be honest with you.

1756
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:42,000
The deal is
Steven wants him.

1757
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,502
He's nuts about him,

1758
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:46,004
So just tell us
what you want.

1759
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,006
5 grand a week?

1760
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:50,008
10?

1761
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:52,010
50.

1762
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:54,513
A million.

1763
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:55,514
What?

1764
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:58,017
Come on, Sam.
Talk to me.

1765
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:00,520
I just need to do

1766
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,522
what's best for my giant.

1767
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,028
Mr. Kamin.

1768
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:12,031
Doctor. They told me
you were... working late.

1769
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,533
First of all...

1770
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:16,035
I apologize.

1771
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:18,539
I was way out of line
with what I said before.

1772
01:14:18,539 --> 01:14:20,540
I--I was just stunned.

1773
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,041
It's OK.

1774
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:24,043
There are some things
that I need to know.

1775
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:25,544
Sure. Sit down.

1776
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,552
Life expectancy.

1777
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:37,056
The books say
35 to 50 years.

1778
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:41,561
You see, they suffer
from cardiac enlargement.

1779
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:43,563
Ventricular hypertrophy.

1780
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,066
Bad heart.

1781
01:14:46,066 --> 01:14:47,068
That's right.

1782
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:50,070
Well, what about
a new one, you know?

1783
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:51,572
I mean, a heart transplant.

1784
01:14:51,572 --> 01:14:55,075
His heart's the size
of a catcher's glove.

1785
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:57,579
You won't find one
to replace it.

1786
01:14:57,579 --> 01:15:00,081
He's aware of this,
you know.

1787
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,083
What?

1788
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:04,084
Yes.

1789
01:15:05,085 --> 01:15:09,591
He wrote "sick heart"
across his questionnaire...

1790
01:15:13,094 --> 01:15:17,099
Asked me how long
I thought he had left.

1791
01:15:21,102 --> 01:15:22,603
And what did you tell him?

1792
01:15:22,603 --> 01:15:25,106
That he should be
with family.

1793
01:15:40,872 --> 01:15:42,874
What did he tell you?

1794
01:15:45,378 --> 01:15:47,380
That you're dying.

1795
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:50,382
They always say that.

1796
01:15:50,382 --> 01:15:52,884
Tell me the truth.

1797
01:15:52,884 --> 01:15:56,389
Come on, Max,
tell me the truth.

1798
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,393
Do you feel like you are?

1799
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:00,894
Sometimes.

1800
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:03,396
Why did you do this?

1801
01:16:03,396 --> 01:16:04,398
Why did you let me

1802
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:05,899
drag you across the country?

1803
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:07,901
To see Lillianna.

1804
01:16:07,901 --> 01:16:10,904
You could have told me,
Max, you know?

1805
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:12,906
You should have told me.

1806
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:24,918
I'm sorry, Sam.

1807
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:31,425
Can we still see Lillianna?

1808
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:32,926
Please?

1809
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,932
I'll be all right.

1810
01:16:38,932 --> 01:16:40,434
Trust me.

1811
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:49,443
Hello.

1812
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:50,944
Hi. It's me.

1813
01:16:52,447 --> 01:16:53,948
Hi, Sam.

1814
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:57,452
How's it going?

1815
01:16:57,452 --> 01:16:59,454
Not so good.

1816
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:01,956
What's wrong?

1817
01:17:01,956 --> 01:17:04,959
I don't know.
I just...

1818
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:05,960
...wanted to say hi.

1819
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,962
Just wanted to hear
your voice

1820
01:17:07,962 --> 01:17:09,464
and to see
how you're doing.

1821
01:17:09,964 --> 01:17:11,968
How are ya?
How ya doing?

1822
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:14,971
What's going on
with you, Sam?

1823
01:17:15,472 --> 01:17:16,972
You sound strange.

1824
01:17:17,973 --> 01:17:19,974
My giant's dying.

1825
01:17:19,974 --> 01:17:20,975
What?

1826
01:17:20,975 --> 01:17:21,977
Yeah.

1827
01:17:22,978 --> 01:17:24,480
Ever see an old giant?

1828
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,982
You've lost me, Sam.

1829
01:17:26,982 --> 01:17:28,984
I know I have...

1830
01:17:28,984 --> 01:17:30,486
and I don't want to.

1831
01:17:30,486 --> 01:17:31,987
And do you--
do you really want this?

1832
01:17:31,987 --> 01:17:34,990
Do you want to just
give up on us, huh?

1833
01:17:38,494 --> 01:17:40,496
Where are you?

1834
01:17:40,496 --> 01:17:42,999
I'm at an airport.

1835
01:17:42,999 --> 01:17:45,001
I'm on my way
to New Mexico

1836
01:17:45,001 --> 01:17:48,504
to try to convince a woman
who knew Max 20 years ago

1837
01:17:48,504 --> 01:17:49,505
to come visit him

1838
01:17:49,505 --> 01:17:52,008
because that's what he wants

1839
01:17:52,008 --> 01:17:54,511
and I don't know
if I can.

1840
01:17:56,012 --> 01:18:00,017
Serena, my whole life...

1841
01:18:00,017 --> 01:18:02,018
I've been able to talk
people into doing things

1842
01:18:02,018 --> 01:18:04,521
and I don't think
it's working anymore.

1843
01:18:07,023 --> 01:18:10,528
What can I do for you, Sam?

1844
01:18:10,528 --> 01:18:11,529
I don't know.

1845
01:18:12,029 --> 01:18:13,531
You got a magic wand
lying around?

1846
01:18:14,031 --> 01:18:15,532
You could wave it...

1847
01:18:16,032 --> 01:18:17,032
Say a couple of--

1848
01:18:17,032 --> 01:18:20,537
No. There's no magic wands.

1849
01:18:21,037 --> 01:18:22,038
Well, there better be,

1850
01:18:22,038 --> 01:18:25,559
Because I'm about to need one.

1851
01:18:34,051 --> 01:18:36,053
Wonder View Terrace.
All right.

1852
01:18:49,568 --> 01:18:51,069
Don't forget to lock up
when you're done.

1853
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:53,071
OK. Bye-bye, Lillianna.

1854
01:18:53,071 --> 01:18:54,573
See you next week.

1855
01:19:06,585 --> 01:19:08,087
Miss!

1856
01:19:52,132 --> 01:19:55,135
We grew up together
in the village of Lunca.

1857
01:19:55,636 --> 01:19:57,639
She kissed me...

1858
01:19:57,639 --> 01:19:59,640
by the fountain of the virgin

1859
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,643
at the end of the road
near my house.

1860
01:20:02,643 --> 01:20:04,144
22 years, Sam.

1861
01:20:04,144 --> 01:20:07,649
I can still feel
her lips on mine.

1862
01:20:16,657 --> 01:20:17,157
Miss...

1863
01:20:17,658 --> 01:20:18,659
Keep away from me.

1864
01:20:18,659 --> 01:20:19,660
I have pepper spray.

1865
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:20,661
Wait. Hey,
let me explain.

1866
01:20:20,661 --> 01:20:21,662
Keep your distance.
Keep away.

1867
01:20:21,662 --> 01:20:22,663
Wait.
Don't shoot that.

1868
01:20:22,663 --> 01:20:23,664
Go away.

1869
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:25,165
Please, don't do this, Lillianna.

1870
01:20:25,165 --> 01:20:26,167
How do you know my name?

1871
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:27,669
I'm a friend of
Maximus Sanferescu.

1872
01:20:28,169 --> 01:20:29,169
You're the one
who was calling?

1873
01:20:29,169 --> 01:20:31,171
Yes.
Max is very sick...

1874
01:20:31,171 --> 01:20:32,673
...and he needs to see you.

1875
01:20:32,673 --> 01:20:34,174
I know he is sick.

1876
01:20:34,174 --> 01:20:36,678
He's very sick.
He's obsessed with me.

1877
01:20:36,678 --> 01:20:37,679
Do you know how many letters

1878
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,180
I've gotten from him
in 20 years?

1879
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,181
Maybe 1,000...

1880
01:20:40,181 --> 01:20:41,683
until I told
the post office

1881
01:20:41,683 --> 01:20:42,684
to start destroying them.

1882
01:20:42,684 --> 01:20:43,684
It's called stalking.

1883
01:20:43,684 --> 01:20:45,687
Does he know
it's against the law?

1884
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:46,688
I could get you
both arrested.

1885
01:20:47,188 --> 01:20:48,189
Let me explain,
please.

1886
01:20:48,189 --> 01:20:50,192
Explain why the church
doesn't do something

1887
01:20:50,192 --> 01:20:51,193
about this perverted priest.

1888
01:20:51,193 --> 01:20:52,695
Explain that to me.

1889
01:20:53,195 --> 01:20:54,196
Wait a second.
He is not a pervert.

1890
01:20:54,698 --> 01:20:55,699
He's not even a priest.

1891
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:58,201
He's a good man.
He's a wonderful man

1892
01:20:58,201 --> 01:20:59,201
who's in love with you

1893
01:20:59,201 --> 01:21:00,703
and he's always been
in love with you.

1894
01:21:01,203 --> 01:21:02,705
He remembers kissing you.

1895
01:21:02,705 --> 01:21:04,708
I never kissed him.

1896
01:21:04,708 --> 01:21:05,709
In Lunca?

1897
01:21:05,709 --> 01:21:06,710
Behind the fountain
of the virgin

1898
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:08,211
at the end of the road

1899
01:21:08,211 --> 01:21:10,713
near his parents'
house? Right?

1900
01:21:10,713 --> 01:21:13,716
That was 20 years ago.

1901
01:21:13,716 --> 01:21:16,218
I was a kid. There's
nothing to talk about.

1902
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:17,720
Wait...

1903
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,722
Lillianna, he's
an unusual person.

1904
01:21:19,722 --> 01:21:21,223
If you would let me explain,

1905
01:21:21,724 --> 01:21:22,725
you'd understand.

1906
01:21:22,725 --> 01:21:24,227
All I'm asking

1907
01:21:24,227 --> 01:21:26,229
is for you to give me
5 minutes, OK?

1908
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:27,731
Just 5 minutes.

1909
01:21:27,731 --> 01:21:28,731
You come into this restaurant--

1910
01:21:29,231 --> 01:21:30,232
in public--

1911
01:21:30,232 --> 01:21:32,234
Sit down, have a cup
of coffee with me

1912
01:21:32,234 --> 01:21:34,738
and listen to what
I have to say about Max.

1913
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:36,239
There are things
that you don't know

1914
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,742
that'll make all the
difference in the world.

1915
01:21:38,742 --> 01:21:39,743
Please.

1916
01:21:39,743 --> 01:21:41,745
5 minutes?

1917
01:21:42,245 --> 01:21:44,247
What do you say?

1918
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:46,750
I don't want to.
Get away from my car.

1919
01:22:01,682 --> 01:22:02,184
'Allo?

1920
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:03,185
Max, it's me.

1921
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:04,186
Sammy!

1922
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:06,188
Did you see her?

1923
01:22:06,188 --> 01:22:07,689
Not only
did I see her,

1924
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:10,191
I'm bringing her
to the hotel.

1925
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:11,192
She's coming?

1926
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:12,693
Any second.

1927
01:22:12,693 --> 01:22:13,694
What did she say?

1928
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:14,695
Now, listen,

1929
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:16,697
In 20 years, people change.

1930
01:22:16,697 --> 01:22:17,698
You understand?

1931
01:22:17,698 --> 01:22:18,699
So don't be surprised

1932
01:22:18,699 --> 01:22:20,701
if you find her a
little bit changed.

1933
01:22:20,701 --> 01:22:21,703
What do I wear?

1934
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:23,705
Stay away from
vertical stripes.

1935
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:29,710
What if she don't like me
when she see me?

1936
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:31,213
She will like you,
Max.

1937
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:33,215
Trust me.

1938
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:36,718
I'll see you in
a few minutes, OK?

1939
01:22:37,219 --> 01:22:38,220
All right. Bye.

1940
01:22:46,228 --> 01:22:48,730
Lillianna,
I'm gonna tell Max

1941
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,733
that you're here, OK?
Thanks.

1942
01:22:55,738 --> 01:22:56,738
Hey...

1943
01:22:58,740 --> 01:22:59,741
Are you ready?

1944
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:01,244
She's here?

1945
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:02,245
She's here.

1946
01:23:02,245 --> 01:23:04,247
I'll bring her in, OK?

1947
01:23:04,247 --> 01:23:05,248
Yes.

1948
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:11,753
Lillianna,
You wanna... come in?

1949
01:23:20,764 --> 01:23:23,267
Come in.
He won't bite.

1950
01:23:30,274 --> 01:23:31,775
Lillianna...

1951
01:23:31,775 --> 01:23:33,277
Maximus...

1952
01:23:39,784 --> 01:23:44,288
Max, Lillianna would like it
if you spoke English.

1953
01:23:44,788 --> 01:23:45,789
Yes. Please.

1954
01:23:45,789 --> 01:23:47,791
Yes. English.

1955
01:23:50,295 --> 01:23:51,296
We all speak English.

1956
01:23:58,303 --> 01:23:59,804
Listen, if you two
would like me to go--

1957
01:24:00,305 --> 01:24:00,805
- No.
- No.

1958
01:24:01,306 --> 01:24:02,807
I'll be happy to stay.

1959
01:24:02,807 --> 01:24:04,808
I'll just...
be right there.

1960
01:24:18,823 --> 01:24:20,325
You look different.

1961
01:24:21,826 --> 01:24:23,328
And you.

1962
01:24:23,328 --> 01:24:25,330
I grow.

1963
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:27,332
Yes.

1964
01:24:27,332 --> 01:24:28,834
Too much.

1965
01:24:28,834 --> 01:24:32,338
You are still my Maximus.

1966
01:24:38,345 --> 01:24:40,346
Why you never write to me?

1967
01:24:42,348 --> 01:24:43,849
I wanted to,

1968
01:24:43,849 --> 01:24:44,850
But... my--

1969
01:24:45,351 --> 01:24:45,851
father.

1970
01:24:46,352 --> 01:24:47,354
Father was so strict.

1971
01:24:47,854 --> 01:24:49,356
I'm sorry.

1972
01:24:49,856 --> 01:24:51,358
I thought you forgot me.

1973
01:24:51,858 --> 01:24:52,359
No.

1974
01:24:52,859 --> 01:24:53,360
You remembered?

1975
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:54,861
Everything.

1976
01:24:54,861 --> 01:24:57,364
Goat boy and the treasure?

1977
01:24:57,364 --> 01:24:58,865
The treasure?

1978
01:24:58,865 --> 01:25:01,868
Yeah. The goat.
Mine jump up.

1979
01:25:01,868 --> 01:25:05,371
The goat.

1980
01:25:05,871 --> 01:25:07,374
That was so funny.

1981
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:09,875
When the machine
cut his legs off?

1982
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:12,378
That was so sad.

1983
01:25:12,378 --> 01:25:14,380
I wrote to you
every day.

1984
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,384
I sent you poems.

1985
01:25:17,384 --> 01:25:20,387
I remember every one.

1986
01:25:20,387 --> 01:25:21,388
Say one.

1987
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:24,890
Say one.

1988
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:26,893
Whichever you like best.

1989
01:25:27,394 --> 01:25:27,894
Max,

1990
01:25:28,395 --> 01:25:29,396
why don't you do

1991
01:25:29,396 --> 01:25:30,897
one of your favorite poems
for Lillianna?

1992
01:25:30,897 --> 01:25:33,400
Wouldn't you like to hear
one, Lillianna, from Max?

1993
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,401
Yes, please.

1994
01:25:34,401 --> 01:25:36,904
I've longed to hear
one in your voice.

1995
01:25:36,904 --> 01:25:38,907
No. My accent.

1996
01:25:39,408 --> 01:25:40,908
Is beautiful.

1997
01:25:40,908 --> 01:25:43,911
Nothing about me
is beautiful.

1998
01:25:56,925 --> 01:25:58,927
Please.

1999
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:15,944
How do I love thee?

2000
01:26:15,944 --> 01:26:18,447
Let me count the ways.

2001
01:26:18,447 --> 01:26:24,453
I love thee to the depth
and breadth and height

2002
01:26:24,453 --> 01:26:25,454
My soul can reach.

2003
01:26:25,454 --> 01:26:32,461
I love thee with
the breaths, smiles, tears

2004
01:26:32,461 --> 01:26:34,964
For all my life.

2005
01:26:34,964 --> 01:26:36,966
And if god chooses,

2006
01:26:36,966 --> 01:26:41,470
I shall love thee better
after death.

2007
01:26:57,488 --> 01:27:01,491
You are happy,
Lillianna, in your life?

2008
01:27:03,994 --> 01:27:05,996
You're alone?

2009
01:27:07,998 --> 01:27:09,499
You are married.

2010
01:27:13,003 --> 01:27:14,505
He is a good man?

2011
01:27:16,006 --> 01:27:18,509
He doesn't seem to know it,

2012
01:27:18,509 --> 01:27:20,511
but he's a good man.

2013
01:27:20,511 --> 01:27:24,515
He just doesn't
feel good enough.

2014
01:27:24,515 --> 01:27:27,518
Even with your love?

2015
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:33,024
You deserve better man.

2016
01:27:35,527 --> 01:27:39,530
Lillianna,
you remember the kiss?

2017
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:42,033
Behind the fountain?

2018
01:27:42,033 --> 01:27:44,035
Yes.

2019
01:27:44,035 --> 01:27:46,037
I will never forget it.

2020
01:27:46,037 --> 01:27:48,540
I still dream of it.

2021
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:21,074
I'm so sorry, but...

2022
01:28:21,074 --> 01:28:24,076
We will always
have the sunset.

2023
01:28:38,591 --> 01:28:43,096
Just know...
I will never forget you.

2024
01:28:58,612 --> 01:29:00,113
I'll be right back.

2025
01:29:08,705 --> 01:29:10,707
Do you want me to go
to the airport with you?

2026
01:29:10,707 --> 01:29:13,710
No. I think you should
stay with him.

2027
01:29:17,715 --> 01:29:19,718
Do you have to go
right away?

2028
01:29:19,718 --> 01:29:21,220
It's Nicky's birthday.

2029
01:29:21,719 --> 01:29:23,221
Yeah.

2030
01:29:25,223 --> 01:29:27,726
That was unbelievable.
That was really amazing.

2031
01:29:28,227 --> 01:29:29,228
The kiss, however,
I didn't see coming--

2032
01:29:29,228 --> 01:29:30,229
Sammy.

2033
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:32,231
Yeah?

2034
01:29:34,733 --> 01:29:36,235
Right.

2035
01:29:40,739 --> 01:29:42,241
Thank you.

2036
01:29:44,243 --> 01:29:46,745
That meant everything to him.

2037
01:29:46,745 --> 01:29:48,248
And me.

2038
01:29:49,249 --> 01:29:54,252
And me. You know,
what you did for him...

2039
01:29:55,753 --> 01:29:58,257
That's the man
I married.

2040
01:29:59,758 --> 01:30:02,261
I've missed you.

2041
01:30:10,769 --> 01:30:13,772
Hey, Serena...

2042
01:30:13,772 --> 01:30:15,774
You're my Lillianna.

2043
01:30:16,276 --> 01:30:19,279
I'm gonna love you forever.

2044
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,283
There's one
big difference.

2045
01:30:27,787 --> 01:30:30,291
She didn't
love him back.

2046
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,521
Spell, please.

2047
01:31:16,521 --> 01:31:20,007
Big back end?

2048
01:31:20,007 --> 01:31:23,010
Thank you.
I'll tell him. Good-bye.

2049
01:31:26,515 --> 01:31:29,017
What is "big back end"?

2050
01:31:29,017 --> 01:31:30,519
What?

2051
01:31:30,519 --> 01:31:32,020
The man
from the movie said,

2052
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:34,023
"3-pic deal. Option TV.

2053
01:31:34,023 --> 01:31:36,024
Big back end."

2054
01:31:38,527 --> 01:31:40,028
What does this mean?

2055
01:31:42,031 --> 01:31:45,035
It means you're a star
of the silver screen, Max.

2056
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:47,538
The biggest I ever had.

2057
01:31:48,038 --> 01:31:50,539
Seems like a perfect time
to leave, doesn't it?

2058
01:31:50,539 --> 01:31:52,541
Come on, pack up.

2059
01:31:54,043 --> 01:31:55,545
But the movie, Sam.

2060
01:31:57,046 --> 01:31:59,048
The movie's
the easy part, Max.

2061
01:31:59,048 --> 01:32:01,050
It's the deal that's hard.

2062
01:32:05,388 --> 01:32:07,390
So, I'm in Romania,

2063
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:10,343
with a truly gigantic
movie star

2064
01:32:10,343 --> 01:32:11,344
whose one appearance

2065
01:32:11,344 --> 01:32:13,347
in a little-known European
movie skyrocketed him

2066
01:32:13,847 --> 01:32:15,849
to a 3-picture deal
in Hollywood.

2067
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:20,853
But he got out
while he was still on top.

2068
01:33:53,415 --> 01:33:55,417
Good morning.

2069
01:33:56,418 --> 01:33:58,922
Sanferescu?

2070
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:08,933
Max?

2071
01:34:08,933 --> 01:34:10,434
Max, wake up.

2072
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:16,941
No!

2073
01:34:16,941 --> 01:34:19,443
No! Why you do this
to me, Sam?

2074
01:34:19,443 --> 01:34:21,445
Why?! Why you
bring me here?!

2075
01:34:21,445 --> 01:34:24,448
This is not my home!
They leave me!

2076
01:34:24,448 --> 01:34:25,950
Why, Sam?! Who tell you
do this to me?!

2077
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:36,961
I told you lots of times,
I don't like this place!

2078
01:34:36,961 --> 01:34:38,964
My mother had a saying:

2079
01:34:38,964 --> 01:34:40,966
Never go to sleep angry.

2080
01:35:02,486 --> 01:35:03,487
Go home.

2081
01:35:40,527 --> 01:35:42,528
Mama.

2082
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:44,530
Mama!

2083
01:35:57,044 --> 01:35:58,545
Dada.

2084
01:36:22,603 --> 01:36:25,607
I saw Max twice
over the next year.

2085
01:36:26,107 --> 01:36:29,611
The last time,
to say good-bye.

2086
01:36:29,611 --> 01:36:32,113
It's funny to think
that someone could die

2087
01:36:32,113 --> 01:36:37,119
because his heart was too big,
but that was Max.

2088
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:39,120
The thing is,
he wanted to be small

2089
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,623
and I wanted to be big.

2090
01:36:41,623 --> 01:36:43,124
But what we both
were looking for

2091
01:36:43,626 --> 01:36:45,127
had nothing
to do with size.

2092
01:36:45,627 --> 01:36:48,630
Because I'm not the tallest guy
in the world,

2093
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:52,634
But in the eyes of my family,
I've become a giant.

2094
01:36:52,634 --> 01:36:57,139
Vanquish mine enemy!

2095
01:37:06,148 --> 01:37:07,650
Begone, foul demon,

2096
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:09,652
For I am the swordmaster!
