Max Landsberger.

180
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,100
I'm in charge
of new recruits at INC.

181
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,834
I'll be showing you around
for the first few days.

182
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,300
Now, you'll be starting
with Frank Stedman

183
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,700
on the 41st floor.

184
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,367
I'll meet you
in his office at 9:00.

185
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,767
Oh, and congratulations, Jack.

186
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,633
You really scored
getting Stedman.

187
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:32,600
slap!

188
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,333
He's going right to the top.

189
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,300
(Frank)
Sid, it's Frank Stedman.

190
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,300
I'm dead!

191
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,000
Finished!

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,100
(Sid)
Just relax.

193
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,700
Helmes swore
he wouldn't announce

194
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,734
this move until Christmas!

195
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:45,033
It's the goddamn headline
in The Journal!

196
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:46,200
(Sid)
No problem.

197
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,166
The SCC's going to want to know

198
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,367
why I sold 50,000
Allenville shares

199
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:53,100
the day before we torpedoed
the plant!

200
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,033
Frank, can you hold on--

201
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,166
I could go to jail!

202
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,400
Can you hold?

203
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,700
No, I can't hold!

204
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,066
What are you--ha--Sid, Sid!

205
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:03,066
Crap!
Will you get this thing moving?

206
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,567
[cars honking]

207
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,533
We're stuck
in a traffic jam, sir.

208
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:07,533
I'm not the great Houdini.

209
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:09,967
Well, blow your horn
like everybody else!

210
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:13,633
Only a fool blows his horn
in a traffic jam, sir.

211
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,433
[grunting and horn honking]

212
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,600
[cars honking]

213
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,400
Please, please, please pick up.

214
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,100
Come on.
Come on.

215
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,734
God, please, Sid, Sid!

216
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,767
(Sid)
Frank?

217
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:30,867
Thank God!

218
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,633
No, I can't hold, Sid!

219
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:33,800
Wait!
Hello!

220
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,100
Sid--crap!

221
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,233
I've got to get out.

222
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,033
(man)
Hey, hey!

223
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,533
(woman)
Get off.

224
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:50,433
[grunts]

225
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,333
(Scott)
Hi, Sid, Scott Dantley.

226
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,734
Sid, the SCC's really
got us by the balls

227
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:09,200
in the Stedman stock deal.

228
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,567
Mr. Helmes wants him
terminated.

229
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:15,667
Uh-huh, wants his desk out,
his chair out, carpet out,

230
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:16,900
parking privileges revoked.

231
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,967
Hold on, Sid.

232
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:20,333
[whispers]
Turn it up.

233
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,867
Can the stock market
survive a nuclear holocaust?

234
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:26,166
"Yes," says our next guest.

235
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,867
And he'll tell us what stocks
to buy and what to sell

236
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:31,567
in the event
of a thermonuclear exchange

237
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,133
right after these messages.

238
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,767
Listen, Sid, Mr. Helmes
is the company.

239
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,367
He doesn't give a flying shit
about Stedman's loyalty,

240
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,800
and, uh, he wants him
out by lunch.

241
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:44,967
Look there.

242
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:46,233
Art Grisham.

243
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,700
Chairman,
Petradyne International.

244
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,600
Oh, God.

245
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,734
I love it up here!

246
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,000
Dantley!

247
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:06,633
Dantley!

248
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,667
Get out!

249
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:13,834
We have most INC management
women with us, Jane.

250
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,266
We certainly hope
you're behind us.

251
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,367
God, yes,
absolutely, 100%.

252
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:18,700
We have to go in
united as women.

253
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,100
Oh, I agree
absolutely.

254
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,867
It's women 120%.

255
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:23,033
United we stand.

256
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:23,967
Divided we fall.

257
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:25,300
Frank!

258
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,266
Frank, this Latin American
move's really

259
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:28,166
gonna shake things up.

260
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,934
You know I'm ripe
for a division head.

261
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:31,333
Just help me
make my move.

262
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,533
I can't talk
about that now!

263
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:34,066
Oh, over drinks
tonight, then.

264
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:35,767
A drink, fine.
I'll need one later.

265
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:37,467
Great, how's my place,
8:00?

266
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,967
They're going to dump me
over this Allenville stock deal.

267
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,333
What are you
talking about?

268
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,300
I'm dead!
Finished!

269
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,400
Jesus, you're serious.

270
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,367
Dead serious.

271
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,300
We'll talk tonight
at your place.

272
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,633
I might need your help.

273
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:49,867
Damn it--I-I don't know
what's the matter with me.

274
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,266
I-I've got racquetball
tonight

275
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:53,033
and tomorrow night--
Racquetball?

276
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:54,900
We'll have to reschedule.

277
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,433
Call!
Racquetball?

278
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:57,567
You can count on me!

279
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,800
I can count on you?

280
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,433
[sighs heavily]

281
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,266
No one trusts me, Mike.

282
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:04,967
Oh, Al, trust me.
They trust you.

283
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm too honest for them.

284
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're not that honest.

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,567
Everyone thinks
I'm an asshole.

286
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:09,700
No, not everyone.

287
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,900
Name one person who hasn't
called me an asshole.

288
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Just one!
Stedman.

289
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,133
Stedman?
That asshole!

290
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,233
Name someone with clout!

291
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,567
Al, pull yourself
together.

292
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:17,900
Mike, don't shit me.

293
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,734
Don't shit a dead man.

294
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:20,166
You're looking
at an insect husk,

295
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,166
a whacked-up,
burned-out body shell--

296
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,633
a dead person!

297
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:24,967
Al, it's only Monday.

298
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:27,300
You're talking like
it's already Friday.

299
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,633
[sniffing]

300
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:31,834
[helicopter engine noise]

301
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,500
Scott Dantley.

302
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,734
Colonel Frank Tolliver.

303
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,600
Apollo 6, Apollo 16--

304
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,266
and now national sales rep
for Daisy Fresh Toilet Tissue.

305
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:56,100
You've always been a hero, sir.

306
00:12:57,367 --> 00:12:58,900
Colonel Tolliver's
going to speak

307
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,500
to the prayer breakfast
on God and space.

308
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,000
So, uh, what would you say
are the, uh--the, uh--

309
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,233
slap!

310
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:12,533
What are the implications
of the tests, Dr. Hirsch?

311
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:16,333
[buzzing]

312
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,033
I only have--
slap!

313
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:21,200
You mean I only have
eight months to live?

314
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,567
[buzzing]
Well, are you absolutely--

315
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:26,967
Is that a certainty?
slap!

316
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:29,400
Okay, thank you.

317
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,467
[buzzing]

318
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:31,967
[phone dropping hard]

319
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:33,033
slap!

320
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:34,033
clunk!

321
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,233
[loud buzzing]

322
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:38,567
[panting]

323
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,600
What the hell are you doing?

324
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,734
(Frank)
Put it back!

325
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:43,800
Put it all back down!

326
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,500
Down, down, down, down!

327
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,800
Down, down!

328
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,533
All I know is
what's on the work order.

329
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,000
Why are you doing this?

330
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,367
Who told you to do this to me?

331
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:54,867
Someone said the guy
who was in here died.

332
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,333
Died?

333
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,000
Died?

334
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,433
Do I look dead, huh?

335
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:00,967
What the hell do you mean,
"died"?

336
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:02,000
Do I?

337
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,967
Uh, not to me, sir.

338
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,667
This is Jack Issel, sir.

339
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,000
Out of my friggin' way!

340
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,333
Morning, Frank.

341
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,567
thud

342
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,600
Jack Issel.

343
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,700
Max Landsberger.

344
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,767
How you doing?

345
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:14,667
Hi.

346
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:15,800
There's been
a slight screw-up.

347
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,400
You won't be starting
with Stedman this morning.

348
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,200
I thought I caught him
at a bad time.

349
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,367
No problem.

350
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:25,800
Lesson number one:
beware of the furniture movers.

351
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,333
When the ax falls, they're
always the first to know.

352
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,033
People see them coming,
and they shit.

353
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,266
I thought Mr. Stedman
didn't seem too happy.

354
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:33,600
Hell, no,
he just got fired.

355
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,033
(Max)
Listen, I got you set up
in P.R. with Howard Gross.

356
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:39,300
Gross is the kind of guy
who really knows

357
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,567
how to handle the pressure.

358
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:41,567
This is Howard Gross!

359
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:42,867
I'm 35 years old!

360
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:44,066
I'm the head of this division!

361
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:46,533
I'm not the head of this
division because I'm a moron!

362
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:49,266
I got the head of this division
because I-I-I'm not a moron!

363
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:50,834
Listen, my neck is
on the line here.

364
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:52,467
I'm the one
who's going to determine

365
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:54,300
what is brilliant
or not brilliant!

366
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,533
And I'm telling you it's crap!

367
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:56,700
Look, I'm telling--

368
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,200
Listen, listen
to me for a second!

369
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,700
I'm not trying
to sell panty hose!

370
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,767
It's on my head!

371
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,100
I got to convince them
that killing 100,000 jobs

372
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,567
and closing down a plant
and moving it to Latin America

373
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,166
is not unpatriotic!

374
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,700
I got to sell this as being
patriotic as goddamn apple pie!

375
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,767
If anybody up there sees this,
I'm going to die.

376
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:14,934
They're going to kill me.

377
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:16,100
[phone buzzing]

378
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,734
I got--I got--
the phone's going here!

379
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,467
I got to hold!
I got to put you on hold!

380
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:21,867
35 lines going here!

381
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,800
35 lines
and 35 people looking for me!

382
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,867
Hang on for a second!
What?

383
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:26,567
Mr. Yonge's on three.

384
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,734
He's just seen the campaign.
He sounds upset.

385
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:29,834
Tell him to hold!

386
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:31,500
Mr. Rayback's on four.

387
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,000
He's also seen the campaign.

388
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,166
He also sounds upset.

389
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,133
Tell Rayback to hold!

390
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,533
Your wife's on five
from the hospital.

391
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:39,166
Her father just passed away.

392
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,333
Tell my wife to hold.

393
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,867
Your mechanic's on six.

394
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,967
He wants to talk to you
about your Mercedes.

395
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:47,900
Hey, how you doing, Harv, yeah?

396
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,633
Fine, no, I'm great.

397
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:50,934
You guys--you guys are great.

398
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:52,700
You guys are great.
Are you kidding?

399
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,033
So is it going
to be ready or what?

400
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:55,700
(Harv)
More than the oil leak--

401
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,233
I'm afraid we'll have to fix
the transmission--$2,500.

402
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,967
No, no, no, just the oil.
I just wanted oil.

403
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,533
We're talking
maybe $4,000 even.

404
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,066
No, no, wait, wait, wait!

405
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,633
No, no, I-I-I--you want to come
over and see my driveway?

406
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,567
I got no oil in my driveway.

407
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,200
What are you talking
about a leak?

408
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,266
You guys know of any of this?

409
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,300
You bring in car;
you put a little leak in it.

410
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,500
The car's got a warranty.

411
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,767
[frantic music]

412
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,400
They're doing it.

413
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,100
They're doing it.

414
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,433
(man)
Hi, Frank.

415
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
I got to see Dantley!

416
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,567
He's on his way
to the prayer breakfast.

417
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,400
Jesus Christ!

418
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,934
You guys are gutless!

419
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:31,133
You guys are--you guys
think you have a monopoly

420
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:33,633
on the whole thing you've got
that dealership there?

421
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,166
I bring it in at 15!
I bring it in at 25!

422
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,133
I bring it in at 35
for a goddamn oil change!

423
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,033
That's under warranty,
that transmission!

424
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,734
I'm 35 years old,
a head of a division!

425
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,233
I'm going to have
a heart attack

426
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:43,333
trying to pay for this car!

427
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:47,266
Lesson number two: never
volunteer, never confront,

428
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:49,166
never talk to anyone
you can possibly avoid.

429
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,333
Hello, Max.
Morning, Bob.

430
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,734
Lousy thing
about Stedman.

431
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:57,333
We're doing everything
in our power to save his neck.

432
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,000
Let me show you where
your office is, Jack.

433
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,166
Excuse me.

434
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:05,066
Stedman's out.

435
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,033
I want Xerox copies
of his personal files.

436
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,166
Hudson, that's
your first job.

437
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,500
Art, I want a list
of his contracts and Rolodex.

438
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,533
Rich, I want
his underground parking spot.

439
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,200
Get maintenance
to paint my name on it

440
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,533
before somebody else
grabs it.

441
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:16,934
Sir--
Anything else?

442
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:18,700
You're late
for your prayer breakfast, sir.

443
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,900
I think you've got God in space
this morning, sir.

444
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,934
[all laugh]

445
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:24,633
I believe in the Lord God,
mister.

446
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:27,000
If more people
in this company had my faith,

447
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,867
we'd not only be
the biggest;

448
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:31,266
we'd also be the best.

449
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,333
Amen, sir.

450
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,367
Through business and industry--

451
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:39,700
[man coughing]

452
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,200
the Lord God can once again
become a real force in America.

453
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,834
American industry is
the cornerstone

454
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,233
of moral order.

455
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,633
spiritual vitality,

456
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:55,133
and national defense.

457
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:58,500
When I stepped
into your building this morning,

458
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,033
I could feel
the spirit of the Lord

459
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:02,433
flowing through these halls.

460
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:03,467
thud!

461
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,467
[breathing harshly]

462
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:07,066
(Howard)
What do you want me to say?

463
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:09,600
I've got 35 guys on hold;
I've got too many--

464
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,133
Look, what do you
want me to say?

465
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,333
Your father is dead.

466
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,467
There's no point in him
being in semi-private.

467
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:15,600
He could be in Yankee Stadium!

468
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,400
He doesn't have to be
in semi-private!

469
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,333
The man is dead!

470
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,166
Of course, the company's
got a policy!

471
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,266
That doesn't mean
I'm going to cover for it!

472
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:23,800
I've got 35 lines here!
I can't talk!

473
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,533
It wasn't my fault;
I'll call you back.

474
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,266
It wasn't my fault;
I'll call you back.

475
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,100
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't my fault.

476
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
It wasn't my fault.

477
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,867
(woman)
Hey!

478
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:33,967
Hey.

479
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:44,834
[growling]

480
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,567
Was that--
Yeah, Frank.

481
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:50,100
Lesson number four:
the secret to survival is,

482
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,667
never make a decision.

483
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,734
Never?

484
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:53,700
Never.

485
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,633
The minute you do,
you get screwed.

486
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,266
I didn't make that decision!

487
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:59,233
I have approved
somebody else's decision!

488
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:00,667
I don't make decisions
like that!

489
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,533
Do you know the difference
between decision approval?

490
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:05,100
Call the guy
who made the decision!

491
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,900
I just approved it!

492
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,800
What are you guys
doing to me?

493
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,367
You're killing me up there.

494
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:11,767
I've got $72,000 Mercedes-Benz
that's leaking more oil

495
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,800
than---Poland!

496
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,033
I've got a dead father-in-law
who's pissed off

497
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:17,333
because he's in semi-private!

498
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,934
I got a cat in the hospital
that's costing me $100 a day!

499
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,700
You guys are killing me up here!

500
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm dying here!

501
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,867
I'm dying!

502
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:27,266
[pump squeaking]

503
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,433
I love this business.

504
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,667
So you think you're
executive material, Jack?

505
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,867
You mean,
can I play hardball?

506
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:36,834
No, I mean
can you kiss ass?

507
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,100
We'd better
get a move on.

508
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,433
Gross'll have a heart attack
if you keep him waiting.

509
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:42,734
Look, I'm afraid Mr. Gross
can't make the meeting.

510
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:44,533
[woman on phone]
He can't be that busy.

511
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,800
No, I wouldn't exactly call
what Mr. Gross is doing

512
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,934
right now as being busy.

513
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:48,767
Well, then what is he?

514
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:49,900
He's dead.
He's dead.

515
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,367
Let's make it
after lunch.

516
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:52,800
Well, after lunch is
just as bad.

517
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,734
Mr. Gross is dead.

518
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:55,967
He'll still be dead after lunch.

519
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:57,767
Look, Mr. Yonge
will be very upset.

520
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,033
Yes, I know Mr. Yonge gets upset

521
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,700
when we cancel
business meetings,

522
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,867
but Mr. Gross has passed away.

523
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,533
Passed away?
Dead?

524
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:04,533
That's right.

525
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:05,467
You mean really dead?

526
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:07,100
No longer alive, correct.

527
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,033
Try aspirin--

528
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:09,133
The man is dead.

529
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,433
He's turning green as we speak.

530
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:12,066
He's not going
to make it to lunch.

531
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,800
He's not going
to make it to the meeting.

532
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,867
If Mr. Yonge wants
to see Mr. Gross that badly,

533
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:18,100
I'll ship Mr. Gross's body
down by internal mail.

534
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,266
Oh.

535
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,333
Gross screams a lot.

536
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,333
You'll get used to him.
Right.

537
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,300
You can live with him

538
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,033
as long as you lift
your end of the load.

539
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:27,066
Right.

540
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:28,133
Lift.

541
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,333
Right.

542
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:33,633
Howard Gross is one of the best
PR men in the business.

543
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:36,100
Been doing a hell of a job
for us for a lot of years.

544
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,667
Real pressure player.

545
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:41,800
Son of a bitch,
he looks pretty bad.

546
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
He's dead, sir.

547
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,867
You can call me Max.

548
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:49,300
He's dead, Max.

549
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,900
You won't be
starting with Gross.

550
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,233
Give me a minute on this.

551
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:54,467
Uh, I'll make a call.

552
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:55,867
[sniffing]

553
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:57,700
Let me and try to set you up
with Mike Hoover.

554
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,934
He's got a great future
in this company.

555
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:03,934
They sure dropped a shit load
of power in your lap.

556
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:05,533
Al, I want to talk to you.

557
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:07,066
You were smart, Mike.

558
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,867
You picked up that whole
Latin American region last year.

559
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:13,467
Who would have guessed
this--this Allenville move?

560
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:15,066
You lucky son of a bitch!

561
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,000
Al, you're the only guy
I can talk to.

562
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,133
Well, then walk me down.

563
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,233
I'm going to have a little time

564
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:21,934
before the prayer
breakfast meeting.

565
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:24,433
Uh--Mike!
I'm gone!

566
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:25,900
I'm dead.

567
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,467
And you don't even understand
the meaning of the word.

568
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:30,600
Dead!

569
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,967
Pardon me.

570
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,200
(woman)
Hold the elevator.

571
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,133
You're actually
physically dying?

572
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:37,767
Eight months.

573
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,867
The doctor said
eight months.

574
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:41,333
I just couldn't
believe it.

575
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,300
Now, look, Al,
the most important thing is,

576
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,233
I don't want you
to tell anybody about this.

577
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,767
If any of these guys
find out anything about this,

578
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:49,000
it'll be terrible!

579
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,467
Al, my work is all
I have left right now.

580
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:53,967
And I want to keep working
for as long as I can.

581
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:56,767
But if any of these guys
finds out anything about this,

582
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:59,333
they're going to be after my job
like a bunch of vultures.

583
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,367
So be sure you don't tell
anybody, all right?

584
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:07,600
Jesus, Mike, I swear
I wouldn't say a word.

585
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,400
(Colonel Tolliver)
Social disorder, jobs,

586
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,000
homosexuality, racial impurity,
and foreign imports--

587
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,200
Hoover just told me
he had eight months to live.

588
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,100
Jesus.

589
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,233
What's he got?

590
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:23,934
The whole Latin American
division.

591
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:26,467
I mean what disease?

592
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:28,567
Jesus, I forgot to ask.

593
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:31,533
[applause]

594
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,533
Gentlemen, let us pray.

595
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:44,200
Get back!
[panting]

596
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,533
The carpets,
they rolled up my carpets!

597
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,767
My sink.

598
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,066
Ah.

599
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:04,967
"To Frank Stedman
for 15 years of service."

600
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:12,000
A Timex.

601
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,567
A goddamned, lousy $22 Timex!

602
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,066
[clattering]

603
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,467
[watch beeping]

604
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:20,567
Amen.

605
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,567
(all)
Amen.

606
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,400
Jack, welcome aboard.

607
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,533
Thank you, sir.

608
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:27,467
I know your father.

609
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:30,533
Great senator, great American,
outstanding human being.

610
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:32,266
Well, he's managed
to stay out of jail,

611
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:34,533
and we're real proud
about that, sir.

612
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:35,767
[both laughing weakly]

613
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:38,233
You met Howard Gross.

614
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:39,700
Uh, not really.

615
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,934
I mean, he, uh, died.

616
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:43,033
He died before I could--

617
00:23:43,033 --> 00:23:44,800
You'll have a new boss
in a few days, Jack.

618
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,467
We were planning on moving
Howard out anyway.

619
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,233
Move him out.

620
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:50,166
(man)
Yes, sir.

621
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,767
Never really had
the heart for the job.

622
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:56,800
God, I love this company.

623
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,000
I love the action.

624
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,367
I love how it touches you
every minute of every day.

625
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,033
Let it down for one second;

626
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:05,066
the entire system will roll
over you like a Mack truck.

627
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:06,000
It's merciless.

628
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,900
But when you're up there
in that cab--

629
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,200
[glass shattering]

630
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,567
Gripping that wheel,
pedal to the metal,

631
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:14,000
foot to the floor, flat-out
screaming down the highway,

632
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,700
wind at your heels,
the entire power

633
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,000
of a multinational corporation
pounding under the hood--

634
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,934
Huh!

635
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:22,000
Nothing like it.

636
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,033
[air whistling]

637
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:24,000
Nothing in the world.

638
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,333
[air whistling]

639
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,033
[car honking]

640
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:32,533
Bob, what was Frank Stedman
wearing this morning?

641
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:35,567
An all-blue suit, sir.

642
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,934
That's what I thought.

643
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,467
My God.

644
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:40,433
Exhilaration of power.

645
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:42,266
That's what we're
all here for, Jack,

646
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,767
but you got to have
what it takes.

647
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:44,834
Am I right, Nixon?

648
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:46,734
Absolutely, sir.

649
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:49,367
Stedman.

650
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,266
Looks like it.

651
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:54,066
The company's a world
unto itself.

652
00:24:54,066 --> 00:24:57,500
The company giveth;
company taketh away.

653
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,600
The strong survive;
the weak fall.

654
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,033
Jack.

655
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,533
We won't be easy on you,

656
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,467
but I promise you this.

657
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:06,934
You'll be
a better man for it.

658
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:08,400
Absolutely.

659
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,533
Two in one morning.

660
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:18,400
Welcome to the world
of big business.

661
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,266
You won't be starting
with Hoover.

662
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:22,066
Rumor is, he'll be dead
in eight months.

663
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:23,600
You'll be starting
in complaints.

664
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,400
This is you.

665
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,633
It's small,
but it has no window.

666
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:30,333
Eliminates the temptation
to jump.

667
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,800
You could always
hang yourself.

668
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,633
No way,
the ceiling's too low.

669
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,800
Hi, my name's Rabinovich.

670
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,867
I'm from St. Louie.

671
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:39,133
I'm just down the hall.

672
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:40,200
I'm new too.

673
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,266
Max Landsberger.

674
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:42,400
Jack Issel.

675
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,633
Hi.

676
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:46,266
(Hudson)
Well, if it isn't
the senator's son?

677
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:50,033
I bet Daddy had to pull a few
strings to get you in here.

678
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:53,133
I believe it was
a straight cash pay-off.

679
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:54,633
Max Landsberger.

680
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:56,567
Uh, John Hudson.

681
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,967
Jack, why don't you take
a few minutes to get settled?

682
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:01,533
I have to make some new
arrangements for you anyway.

683
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:03,233
I'll be back in a flash.

684
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:04,400
Gentlemen.

685
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,800
[laughs sheepishly]

686
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:11,567
[dramatic music]

687
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:14,767
This cream developed by
your company to eliminate hair

688
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,734
from women's legs is
a crime against women.

689
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:17,934
It's a crime against nature,

690
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:20,266
and we demand its immediate
removal from the market.

691
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:22,767
You--you don't think
women should shave

692
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,166
their legs or underarms?

693
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,567
Take a look.

694
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:28,166
We are not, and I repeat, not
involved in the underarm issue.

695
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:31,200
You're not involved
in the underarm--

696
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,333
That's the WACPFSMML.

697
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,166
WAC--

698
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,800
Women Against
Corporate Promotion

699
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,033
of Female Self-Mutilation
Marxist Leninist.

700
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:42,900
I'm going to pass this on
to my superior.

701
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,533
(woman)
Pass this on
to your superior, Jack.

702
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:49,667
(man #1)
Do you know what this is,
Mr. Issel?

703
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:53,166
Is this a trick question?

704
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,200
This is the liver
of a sperm whale.

705
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,700
A subsidiary
of your corporation

706
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,934
is killing sperm whales
for this liver.

707
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:01,100
We all represent groups
who are opposed

708
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,533
to this murderous action
against God and nature.

709
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:08,066
Child Psychologists for
a Free Poland Against Whaling!

710
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:10,433
(man #2)
Zionism is fascism.

711
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:12,233
Fascism is murder.

712
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:14,033
Murder is whaling.

713
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,533
Whaling is Zionism!

714
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,266
(all)
Yeah, right.

715
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:22,266
(man #3)
Larry and I were together
for six years.

716
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:25,600
Then your company
gave him a transfer,

717
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,166
and they won't give me
his address.

718
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:30,467
This is bad.
This is very, very bad.

719
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:31,867
You know Larry?

720
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,600
You're a very unhappy man.

721
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,700
You're keeping us apart.

722
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,033
I will not let big business play
with people's lives like this!

723
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:44,834
[gunshots ring]

724
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,266
You--you slug!

725
00:27:49,266 --> 00:27:52,834
[screaming]

726
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:54,834
Larry!

727
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,233
I'm looking for someone
in public relations.

728
00:27:58,233 --> 00:27:59,133
They sent me down here.

729
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:00,633
They did?

730
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:01,967
My name is Rachael.

731
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:04,500
I'm here to lodge a complaint
against your company.

732
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,166
Okay, that's why I'm here.

733
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,033
Look, Mr. Issel, I'm not naive.

734
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:11,266
I realize that these complaints
will be filed away

735
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:12,233
somewhere and forgotten.

736
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,133
But we will fight
your criminal company

737
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:14,967
in every way that we can.

738
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:18,133
Here, this is
for you, Mr. Issel.

739
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:19,166
thud!

740
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,600
Jesus.

741
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,400
What--what's the problem?

742
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Too much coffee.

743
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,033
[clears throat]

744
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:32,467
Anyway, there are 25,000 names
on that petition.

745
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,367
That's the population
of Allenville.

746
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:36,367
If your company closes
the Allenville plant,

747
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:39,633
those people will lose
their jobs and their homes.

748
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:41,700
Because your company
can get a bit more profit

749
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,567
by moving the plant
to some poor country,

750
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:44,934
where labor is 10¢ an hour

751
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:47,467
and you guys own
the government.

752
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:48,700
Gosh, you're pretty.

753
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:52,033
[clears throat]

754
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:53,800
Would you like to sit?

755
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,867
No, thank you.

756
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:58,900
If INC pulls out,
this town dies, Mr. Issel!

757
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,400
Hey, don't yell at me.

758
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,333
I just started here
this morning.

759
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,567
Would you like a diet Coke?

760
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:05,300
No, thank you.

761
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,433
Now, if INC would let
the workers buy the plant

762
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:10,934
and run it themselves,
they could save this town.

763
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:13,266
That sounds very sensible.

764
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:17,633
Hey, listen, I got to tell you.

765
00:29:18,734 --> 00:29:21,567
You're the most interesting
and attractive person

766
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:23,400
I've met on this job so far.

767
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,734
That's typical.

768
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:27,100
They always dump us
on some little guy

769
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,633
who just wants
to make small talk.

770
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,633
Hey, wait a minute.

771
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,734
This little guy's
going someplace, fella.

772
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:33,500
Oh, where's that, fella?

773
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,967
I'm going to lunch at 12:30.

774
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,934
Come along,
and we can talk

775
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:39,266
about this Allenville thing.

776
00:29:39,266 --> 00:29:40,333
No, thank you.

777
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,734
This photocopy of the petition
is for your boss.

778
00:29:42,734 --> 00:29:44,133
How about lunch on Tuesday?

779
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:45,700
This pamphlet
outlines the damages

780
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,533
that will be done
if the plant closes.

781
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:48,934
I'm free on Wednesday.

782
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:50,700
Good-bye, Mr. Issel.

783
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,600
I'm free on Thursday.

784
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,033
Thursday--actually,
I'm free right through 2010!

785
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:59,400
(Bob)
Jane, come on.
Can't we do that afterwards?

786
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,934
(Jane)
"Howard Gross's tragic death
was not only a personal loss,

787
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:07,400
but a blow to the entire
public relations division."

788
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,667
(Bob)
God, can't that wait?

789
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,033
(Jane)
No, no, wait a minute.

790
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:12,300
"As former PR head,
I feel qualified to recommend

791
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:17,567
"Jane Caldwell as the new
PR division vice president.

792
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:22,300
"She is a tough-minded,
innovative,

793
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,000
aggressive executive."

794
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,233
No, I can do better than that.

795
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:27,200
Now what?

796
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,834
Just hold it, Bob.

797
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:34,600
"She is a tough-minded,
innovative, aggressive--

798
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,834
[clicking]
team player."

799
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:37,834
Better, right?

800
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:39,667
[cranking noise]

801
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:43,500
"She has a fine intelligence
and a relentless drive--

802
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,066
"with wit and
a unique femininity.

803
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:50,200
"In short, she's the number one
choice for the job.

804
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Signed, Bob Nixon."
What do you think?

805
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:58,433
I think you've upset
my concentration.

806
00:30:58,433 --> 00:30:59,633
I'll have it typed,

807
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:01,467
and you'll sign it
in the morning.

808
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:02,467
Deal's a deal.

809
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:06,767
All right, all right, all right.

810
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:12,433
Don't be so angry, huh?

811
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:31,567
Scott, this is
Coach Branch Kipp.

812
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:33,834
You've always been a hero,
Coach.

813
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:35,667
You know, two Super Bowl
championships

814
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:38,567
with all white teams is
quite a feat.

815
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:41,133
It helps to have God
in the backfield.

816
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,633
Bob Nixon;
my pleasure.

817
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:45,900
How's the Issel kid doing?

818
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,133
Good.

819
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:48,166
Promote him.

820
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:49,233
Just started this week.

821
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:50,633
Promote him.

822
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:54,500
We have to make the San Marcos
move sooner than I thought.

823
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,700
I want his father in place.

824
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,333
I'll move him
into Jane Caldwell's department.

825
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:05,934
What do you think, Jack?

826
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:07,600
It's--

827
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,100
Perfect.

828
00:32:10,934 --> 00:32:12,633
Yes, ma'am.

829
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:15,033
God, it's weird.

830
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,667
I'm only 29 years old,

831
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:19,266
and I'm already head of public
relations and communications.

832
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:22,000
I must be blessed.

833
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,100
You had a little help.

834
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,000
Bob, oh, God.

835
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,233
Oh, I appreciate all you did.

836
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:28,400
You were fantastic.

837
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Why don't I, uh,
drop by your place tonight?

838
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,600
Oh, God, I-I-I'm
up to my ears tonight.

839
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,100
I-I've got departmental
meetings all week.

840
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,166
When, then?

841
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,667
When?

842
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,834
When, when, when?

843
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,533
Let's see; let's s.

844
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:45,600
Uh, when, when, when?

845
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,333
How's the, uh-- how's
the first week in September?

846
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,867
That's two months from now.

847
00:32:52,867 --> 00:32:55,800
Well, I'm up to my ears, Bob.

848
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,533
What do you want from me?

849
00:32:57,533 --> 00:33:01,233
Well, you are just screwing
your way to the top, aren't you?

850
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,400
I wouldn't be much
of an executive

851
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,934
if I screwed my way
to the bottom.

852
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:10,367
Would I?

853
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:15,800
Oh, excuse me, sir;
could you tell me--

854
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,200
You!
Sir?

855
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,066
Yes, you, mister!

856
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:19,900
Do you work
for this corporation,

857
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,934
or are you a messenger?

858
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:22,467
My name's Rabinovich, sir.

859
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,233
I'm a new recruit here.

860
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:27,767
You never wear brown shoes with
a blue suit, Mr. Rubenstein.

861
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:29,133
I just--
It's Rabinovich, sir.

862
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,667
You never, ever, ever hold
your glasses together

863
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,967
with tape and a paper clip,
Mr. Rosenberg!

864
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,266
I did this because--
It's Rabinovich, sir.

865
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,400
Glasses now!

866
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,500
Now, now, now!
Glasses!

867
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,500
You have them fixed
by a licensed optometrist.

868
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,900
Shoe, shoe, shoe, shoes!

869
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,433
Black only
in this corporation.

870
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:49,433
clap!

871
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:51,433
Mr. Robenstein.

872
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:53,633
Is that for me?

873
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:54,667
It's just a complaint.

874
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,066
By the way, you've been promoted

875
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:58,000
to Executive Assistant
Vice President

876
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,066
of External Information
and Public Affairs.

877
00:34:00,066 --> 00:34:01,967
This is just my first week.

878
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:04,133
Well, then you must have
good friends upstairs.

879
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:05,567
But don't get too excited.

880
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:08,700
It's the same job with 10%
more salary and 90% more title.

01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,133
like it was a stolen TV set.

1930
01:22:02,133 --> 01:22:04,300
Then you launder the hot goods
through something

1931
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,266
you call foreign policy.

1932
01:22:06,266 --> 01:22:09,367
[laughs]
My God.

1933
01:22:09,367 --> 01:22:10,800
America's a democracy.

1934
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,266
We're not some international
fried chicken chain.

1935
01:22:13,266 --> 01:22:15,066
Give me the money, Jack.

1936
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:16,433
thwack!

1937
01:22:16,433 --> 01:22:18,000
Let's get the hell
out of here.

1938
01:22:21,867 --> 01:22:23,200
Oh, my God!

1939
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,200
Push!

1940
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,367
Oh, come on.

1941
01:22:25,367 --> 01:22:26,333
Push harder!

1942
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:27,300
You try it!

1943
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,367
There!

1944
01:22:28,367 --> 01:22:29,200
I loosened it.

1945
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,200
(Sanchez)
Stop them!

1946
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,333
[machine gun fire]

1947
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:36,367
(man)
We have a security breach
on 109.

1948
01:22:36,367 --> 01:22:38,367
(Helmes)
Jack, this is Mr. Helmes!

1949
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:40,467
Drop the money, and nothing
will happen to you!

1950
01:22:40,467 --> 01:22:42,367
(Rachael)
All they want is their money!

1951
01:22:42,367 --> 01:22:43,567
Just drop it!

1952
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:45,400
I'm not dropping
$2 million in cash.

1953
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,867
They're in the staSewells.

1954
01:22:50,133 --> 01:22:51,633
(man)
Hold it there!

1955
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,667
God, this place is insane.

1956
01:22:53,667 --> 01:22:55,667
[computer rattling]

1957
01:22:55,667 --> 01:22:57,900
They're on the executive floors.

[elevator bell ringing]

1959
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:04,400

1961
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,100
Oh, God.

[gunshots]

1963
01:23:13,233 --> 01:23:14,367
[bell ringing]

1964
01:23:17,133 --> 01:23:18,867
Issel's gone.
I want his division.

1965
01:23:18,867 --> 01:23:20,700
Xerox his files.
Get his Rolodex.

1966
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:21,667
Copy his computer tapes.

1967
01:23:21,667 --> 01:23:23,700
Hudson, you can have
his parking space.

1968
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:24,633
Thank you, sir.

1969
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:25,934
[machine gun fire]

1970
01:23:29,633 --> 01:23:33,467
There are two unidentified
objects in stairwell 69D.

1971
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:38,066
Sex without emotional content
is a hollow, empty experience.

1972
01:23:38,066 --> 01:23:40,100
[gunfire and screaming]

1973
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,767
[gunshot]

1974
01:23:44,767 --> 01:23:47,333
[woman on phone]
This phone is no longer
in service.

1975
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:49,300
Oh, God, what are you doing
with that gun?

1976
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,767
I just shot a phone.

1977
01:23:50,767 --> 01:23:52,667
I don'believe this.
I can't believe this!

1978
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:53,567
Typical male response.

1979
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:55,300
They shoot at you;
you shoot at them.

1980
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:57,266
The violence just escalates
and escalates!

1981
01:23:57,266 --> 01:24:00,533
Well, buddy, I am not having
anything to do with this.

1982
01:24:00,533 --> 01:24:02,467
No way; you are incredible.

1983
01:24:02,467 --> 01:24:03,767

Pretty nice, huh?

1988
01:24:11,934 --> 01:24:13,433
You want to sit in it?

1989
01:24:13,433 --> 01:24:14,834
You want to sit in it?

1990
01:24:14,834 --> 01:24:16,133
No, that's okay.

1991
01:24:16,133 --> 01:24:17,767
I got the latest
Julio Iglesias tape.

1992
01:24:17,767 --> 01:24:19,300
[laughing]

1993
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,467

[male computer voice]
Storage area has been breached.

1998
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,233
They're on the storage floor.

1999
01:24:38,433 --> 01:24:39,600
Freeze!

01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,834
[exhaling sharply]

2001
01:24:41,834 --> 01:24:42,934
Don't turn around.

[laughing]

2003
01:24:48,266 --> 01:24:50,367

I'll call you in the morning!

[horn blaring]

2027

Where are we going?

2028
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,800
Just follow me.

Anything will help.

2032
01:26:13,233 --> 01:26:14,633
We'll take, uh,
checks or cash.

2033
01:26:14,633 --> 01:26:17,600
Oh, this is cash--
from INC--

2034
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,200
From Mr. Helmes himself.

2035
01:26:20,867 --> 01:26:22,567
(Jack)
There were a few changes at INC

2036
01:26:22,567 --> 01:26:24,367
after the night of the generals.

2037
01:26:24,367 --> 01:26:27,333
(Senator Issel)
Are you now, or have you ever
been a member

2038
01:26:27,333 --> 01:26:28,367
of the Communist Party?

2039
01:26:28,367 --> 01:26:31,400
Of--of course not, you idiot!

2040
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:34,633
Then why did your company
contribute over $2 million

2041
01:26:34,633 --> 01:26:36,266
to a Central American
organization--

2042

I'm a Christian.

2043
01:26:37,967 --> 01:26:39,300
I'm a businessman.

2044
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:42,333
I refuse to recognize
this illegal committee!

2045
01:26:42,333 --> 01:26:45,300
(Jack)
Chairman Helmes was forced
to resign from the company

2046
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,900
due to suspected
communist activities

2047
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:49,567
and mental incapacity.

2048
01:26:49,567 --> 01:26:54,100
This left Rachael
in control of 780,000 shares

2049
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:57,900
of her father's INC stock.

2050
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:00,867
This--
[chuckling]

2051
01:27:00,867 --> 01:27:02,233

2052
01:27:02,233 --> 01:27:04,567
[both laughing]

2053
01:27:04,567 --> 01:27:06,467
It did.

2054
01:27:06,467 --> 01:27:07,667
Wow.

2055
01:27:07,667 --> 01:27:09,567
God can be a great guy.

2056
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:13,400
Hey, don't you have
to get to work?

2057
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,300
Oh, my God.

2058
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:17,367
God can also throw
some heavy curves.

2059
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:23,967
Sal, wasn't that
our building you just passed?

2060
01:27:23,967 --> 01:27:25,800
Yes, sir, I have a plan, sir.

2061
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,734
I'm going to hang a louie
at the Prudential Building.

2062
01:27:28,734 --> 01:27:30,567
Then I'm going to circle around.

2063
01:27:30,567 --> 01:27:32,066
Go between Marina Towers.

2064
01:27:32,066 --> 01:27:34,367
I'm going to dive,
dive right between 'em.

2065
01:27:34,367 --> 01:27:36,233
Down Michigan, then turn right.

2066
01:27:36,233 --> 01:27:37,800
We'll pass Marshall Field's.

2067
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,033
We can check out the windows.

2068
01:27:39,033 --> 01:27:40,400
I hear they got a big sale.

2069
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,000
Then I come up
on our building from behind.

2070
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,567
It's going to be great.

2071
01:27:44,567 --> 01:27:47,000
(Jack)
Whatever you say, Sal.
