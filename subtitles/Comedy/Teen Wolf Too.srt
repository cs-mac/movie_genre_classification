1
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,346
He honestly doesn't seem
to like you, Finstock.

2
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,346
He loves me. Do you know why?

3
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,454
He loves me because I'm his master.

4
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,418
He knows I will protect him...

5
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,427
...like the students at Hamilton University.

6
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,555
Sit!

7
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,767
They know why I'm here.

8
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,904
Finstock, do you know why you're here?

9
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,834
Yes, sir. $32,500 a year and summers off.

10
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:36,075
You're here because it's time
to bring the glory back to this institution.

11
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,876
The regional boxing finals
are in three months.

12
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,416
Now, you and I have a sacred oath...

13
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,325
...to provide these young people
with an opportunity...

14
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,822
...to develop not only their minds,
but their spirit as well.

15
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,620
Their fighting spirit.

16
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,698
Am I right?

17
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,736
I promised the alumni
I'd give them a winning boxing team...

18
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,467
...and all you've given me
is this Todd Howard.

19
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,875
The only thing he ever did on an athletic
field was to play in the school band.

20
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,447
Clarinet, looks like.

21
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,975
Can I make a sudden move?

22
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,991
Yeah, that's the kid. I know him.

23
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,857
His cousin played basketball
for me at Beacontown High.

24
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,595
- And?
- And what?

25
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,891
And what?

26
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,366
What?

27
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:31,970
I don't think Scott knew the first thing
about playing the clarinet.

28
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:36,368
I gave that kid a full scholarship
based on your recommendation!

29
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,910
On my recommendation? That's great!

30
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,203
- Finstock!
- What?

31
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,976
Your job is riding on this boxing team!

32
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,982
My reputation as an educator
is riding on this boxing team!

33
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,186
And all you've brought me
is a clarinet player?

34
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,233
- I think it's that way.
- Okay, three blocks?

35
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,824
Todd!

36
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,004
- All right. Thanks a lot.
- Bye.

37
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,470
Come on, Todd! Let's go.

38
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,200
- Excuse me!
- Watch out!

39
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,305
Okay, she said the dorm
was past the quad...

40
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,348
...and left after the administration building.

41
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,009
- Or was it right?
- That's okay. We'll keep going straight.

42
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,190
I know how you feel.

43
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,399
College is a stressful time,
especially on your first day.

44
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,371
What I mean is, it's stressful for anyone...

45
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,369
...even for people without
your particular worry.

46
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,776
What worry?

47
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,272
You know.

48
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,715
I don't believe it!

49
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:59,649
Absolutely.

50
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,151
I hate it when you do that.

51
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,390
I'm not ashamed of who or what I am,
and you shouldn't be, either.

52
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,991
I'm not, because it skipped my family.

53
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,535
No, look, I've got enough problems, okay?

54
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,508
I'm at a new school,
it's my first time away from home...

55
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:22,570
...I gotta make new friends, and try
to fit in without this hanging over me.

56
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,386
It is true that
sometimes it skips family members.

57
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,620
Your mother and father aren't werewolves.

58
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:40,097
But if I were you,
I'd keep my possibilities open.

59
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:50,204
Uncle Harold, can you please change back
before we get to the dorm?

60
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,737
Thanks.

61
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,984
I think the dorm
is just a little north from here.

62
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,947
Watch out!

63
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,390
Excuse me, I think that this was our space.

64
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,598
- Are you talking to me?
- No, but...

65
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,407
...I’d like to maybe give you a call.

66
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,043
Gus, he says this is his space.

67
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,015
A freshman.

68
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,285
Did you think I said that this is my space?

69
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,825
I didn't say that, no.

70
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,992
This is your space. My space has got
a couple of yellow lines on it.

71
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:48,533
I brought my uncle by to see your space,
'cause it was such a nice one.

72
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,837
And now, since you're in your space,
we'll go get in ours.

73
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,705
They seem like nice kids.

74
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,907
Yeah, I think I saw
another space up the street.

75
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,323
Todd? Buddy, how are you? Come on in.

76
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,161
Drop your stuff off.
Make yourself at home.

77
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,138
Do I know you?

78
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,634
Stiles. We're roommates.

79
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,838
- Okay.
- Stiles?

80
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,539
Mr. H?

81
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,019
- How's the Prince of Paint?
- What are you doing here?

82
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,113
Took some doing, but I've got connections.
You know, daughter of somebody.

83
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,054
Let me just tidy up a bit.

84
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,096
It's a great room, I decorated it myself.

85
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,392
What do you think?
You're in the big time, kid: college.

86
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:02,697
No one telling you what to do. No more
picking up your stuff if you don't want to.

87
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,402
No parents. No offense, Mr. H.

88
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,274
Let me help you with that.

89
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,479
- Todd?
- Yeah?

90
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,921
I gotta get back to Beacontown.

91
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,582
- Could you walk me to the van?
- Sure.

92
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,956
Everything's kosher.
I've taken care of everything.

93
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,858
I've got Todd's year
at college all mapped out.

94
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,297
For the drive home.

95
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,643
- Thanks. You got any fries?
- See you in a bit.

96
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,475
Yeah, I'll see you.
We are going to have a great year.

97
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,571
I think so.

98
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,844
I got them vibes happening.

99
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:49,948
In a big way.

100
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,123
Listen, Uncle Harold,
everything's going to be fine.

101
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,825
I'm sure once I start those science classes,
I'll really like it here.

102
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,596
But what about
that sports scholarship they gave you?

103
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,104
The closest you ever came to a field,
was playing clarinet in the marching band.

104
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,042
I'm sure once they take a look at me, they
won't want me to try out for any team.

105
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,010
They're not going to give
you something for nothing.

106
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,208
I guess that's their problem.

107
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,919
- Listen, don't forget your groceries.
- Yeah, thanks.

108
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:28,219
It's just that your mom and dad...
I promised them to look after you, and...

109
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,454
...the last thing I expected
was to find Stiles as your roommate.

110
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,230
He seems okay.

111
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,731
Stiles was Scott's
best friend in high school.

112
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,668
He knows all about us.

113
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,098
I figure since I'm not a...

114
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,440
Since I don't have the family problem...

115
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,810
...there's nothing really to worry
about Stiles, is there?

116
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,644
- I'm sure you'll be okay. Listen...
- What are you doing?

117
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,620
- Come on, take this. You never know.
- Thanks.

118
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,191
- Take care.
- Yeah.

119
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:04,987
What?

120
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,260
If you need anything,
you call me, you hear me?

121
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,528
I will.

122
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,194
Okay.

123
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,503
- Thanks again, Uncle Harold.
- Take it easy.

124
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,276
Call me!

125
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,328
<i>En garde!</i>

126
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,130
No mercy!

127
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,808
- Take that!
- Take it easy, man!

128
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,234
Die!

129
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,105
He's nuts!

130
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,507
Sorry.

131
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,176
Chocolate milk.

132
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,958
- Grab the door for me?
- Todd, Chubby. Chub, Todd.

133
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,051
Hi.

134
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,791
Chub played basketball
at Beacontown, Todd.

135
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,330
- Yeah? You know my cousin?
- Scott.

136
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,562
We just love the Howard family.

137
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,767
Stiles, where's all my stuff?

138
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:32,807
Some of my t-shirts are in there, but
go ahead and help yourself, I don't mind.

139
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:39,322
What did you mean when you told
Uncle Harold you took care of everything?

140
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,394
All your classes. I registered for you.

141
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,522
You what?
Stiles, I've already pre-registered.

142
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,999
I know, I saw what you picked.
I made the necessary changes.

143
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,364
Trust me.

144
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,605
This is all wrong.

145
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,800
- "Girls' volleyball"?
- Good class.

146
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,103
"Candle-making."

147
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,609
"French for chefs"?

148
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,840
<i>C'est très magnifique.</i>
I took it twice. I'm taking it again.

149
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,043
- There's not one science class on here.
- Science?

150
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,051
You don't understand.

151
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,028
That boy's got werewolf
written all over him.

152
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,590
If everything goes as planned, he and I
are going to take this school by storm.

153
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,002
I love college. I love it.

154
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,605
- I gotta get these changed.
- Don't make me laugh, kid.

155
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,744
Rules are rules. Policy is policy.

156
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,819
You don't understand.
This must be changed.

157
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,047
- You've got a lot of nerve.
- Excuse me.

158
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,156
Nobody ever changes their classes.

159
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,111
What do you want?

160
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,644
- I...
- Well?

161
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,410
Come on. I haven't got all day.

162
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,020
I'd like to change some classes.

163
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,037
Have your professor sign this
and bring it back here...

164
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,643
...but not to me.

165
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,303
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

166
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,945
It's not as tough as it looks.

167
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,891
I'm looking for Professor Brooks.

168
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,467
She's not in there.

169
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,801
I was wondering
if you could tell me where she might be?

170
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,038
Professor Brooks
is both omnivorous and bipedal.

171
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,209
She's also a <i>Homo sapiens femininus.</i>

172
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,945
And a brilliant one at that.

173
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,995
I'm Tanya Brooks. Can I help you?

174
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,330
Yeah, I'm Todd Howard.

175
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,099
Howard, yes. I know all about you.

176
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,434
You do?

177
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,542
I'm your faculty advisor.
I read your application.

178
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,146
Your talent for science is very impressive.

179
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,941
That's why I was surprised
that you're here on an athletic scholarship.

180
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,544
That surprised me, too.

181
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,392
Listen, Professor Brooks,
I have a little favor to ask you.

182
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,495
You see, I want to be a veterinarian,
and I need your class.

183
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:07,258
I realize registration is over,
but I wonder if you could see it my way?

184
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,765
Yes.

185
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,963
You're in my class. It's not full yet.

186
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,266
As your advisor,
I'll make an exception for you.

187
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,863
Really? Thank you.

188
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,544
Thank you very much.

189
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,345
What are you looking at?

190
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,921
I'm looking for <i>Lubrus protozoa.</i>

191
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,524
Let's see.

192
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,335
Here it is, right here.

193
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,744
There's nothing on this.

194
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,576
It helps if you turn it on.

195
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,449
See you.

196
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,131
Are you a coach?
I need to speak to a coach.

197
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,469
There's nothing to talk about.
You're Todd Howard.

198
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,400
We're all depending on you.

199
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,712
Depending on me for what?

200
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,448
You missed a spot!

201
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,216
I know just how you feel.

202
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,081
I had this kid once,
he had an athletic scholarship just like you.

203
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,780
A gifted athlete...

204
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:43,125
...but he had this crazy dream
about wanting to become a chiropractor.

205
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,823
But he had to work all night
as a short-order cook at this diner...

206
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:51,494
...because he was supporting his sister
and she had three kids.

207
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,930
And, wait, his name was Phillip.

208
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,008
- No, wait...
- Doesn't matter.

209
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,044
Okay, but it sort of does.
No, his name was George...

210
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,978
...and her three kids were really nice...

211
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,108
...but one of them
had two thumbs on his right hand.

212
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,280
Did he become a chiropractor?

213
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,685
Not with two thumbs
on his right hand, he didn't.

214
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,799
Wait a minute.

215
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,504
- You're from Beacontown, aren't you?
- Yeah.

216
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,439
Now I get it.

217
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,771
You think that I'm...

218
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,844
You can forget it,
because you see, I'm not Scott.

219
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,543
I can't do what Scott did. I'm not like him.

220
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,415
What's a five-letter word
for Italian sausage?

221
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,352
So that's why they gave me
a sports scholarship.

222
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,015
What's the worst that can happen?

223
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:51,187
You jump in the ring, you go a few rounds,
you get your head knocked off, maybe.

224
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,890
Then you get your scholarship
and everybody's happy.

225
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,660
Wait. Jump into what ring?

226
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,200
Just show up for practice
this Thursday, okay?

227
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,771
- Practice for what?
- Boxing.

228
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,373
"Frank!" That's perfect!

229
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,549
Would you take it easy?

230
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,282
I'm trying to make it look good.

231
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,223
I want to keep this scholarship,
but I don't know what to do.

232
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,394
Fat kid's a great dancer.

233
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,859
- All right.
- Go, Chub.

234
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,791
Okay. You want to play rough?

235
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,966
I'm going to throw two jabs.
You come back with a right.

236
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,090
- Which one's the Howard kid?
- Hey, Todd.

237
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,526
I guess he's a little rusty, you know.

238
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,606
If this is some kind of joke...

239
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,608
...you'll notice I'm not laughing.

240
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:55,446
- I had dibs on this.
- Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

241
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,284
Now you're a lawyer?
I thought you were a biologist.

242
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,326
What do you want with it, anyway?
It's probably over your head.

243
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,695
- Over my head?
- Over any jock's head.

244
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,457
Jock?

245
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,037
Listen, all I want to do
is go to this school...

246
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,472
...but I'm here on some
stupid sports scholarship...

247
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,602
...with a coach who wants me
to have two right thumbs.

248
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,974
My roommate sunbathes
with a 40-watt light bulb...

249
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,242
...a fat kid's eating me
out of house and home...

250
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,478
...I’ve got Dean Dunn's dog
trying to bite my leg off...

251
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:31,681
...and you want the only book
that I want in this entire library?

252
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,825
I'll tell you what:

253
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:39,192
You can have this book
and this book and this book and this book.

254
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,232
And you can keep that book as well.

255
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,929
You too, buddy.

256
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,196
You okay?

257
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,296
Yeah.

258
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,332
Here.

259
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,576
I think you want this
a little more than I do.

260
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:27,905
Thanks.

261
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,585
I guess I got a little carried away in there.

262
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,878
I guess you did.

263
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,665
Wait up.

264
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,544
<i>Phylum and Genus Classes</i>
<i>of North American Crustaceans</i>?

265
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,675
A little light reading for you?

266
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:09,879
I guess I should have known
that I'd find you in the science section.

267
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,925
You know, I probably
won't be needing this book anyway.

268
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:21,529
I was a science fair champion
in the Tri-County area.

269
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,158
Yeah.

270
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,330
My research is in crustacean reproduction.

271
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,871
How exciting.

272
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,842
- So, how's your schedule?
- It's better.

273
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,708
Listen, Nicki.

274
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,887
I was wondering if...

275
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,392
Would you like to...

276
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,958
I'd love to.

277
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,491
- You would?
- Sure.

278
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:27,724
Great.

279
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,404
I'm busy Friday, but Saturday I'm free.

280
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,701
Do lab partners usually work on
the weekends this early in the semester?

281
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,547
I thought you were asking me if...

282
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,245
Really?

283
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:55,115
Then, you mean you'd like to?
I mean, maybe...

284
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,792
Maybe we can.

285
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,502
Hi.

286
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,211
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

287
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,823
- About earlier...
- Don't worry about it.

288
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,299
It's nothing.

289
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,835
- Thanks. You look nice.
- Thank you.

290
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,772
- You want to dance?
- Sure.

291
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,339
How's that left hook?

292
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,411
It's great.

293
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:56,954
Todd Howard,
I'd like you to meet Mrs. St. Claire...

294
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,353
...one of our principal benefactors.

295
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:04,492
New physics lab, athletic field
and other endowments.

296
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,723
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.

297
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,933
I'd like you also to meet Lisa Goldfluss
and Emily Lord.

298
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,899
They are co-hostesses
of our reception committee.

299
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,472
We've met.

300
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,479
This fine young man carries
our hopes and dreams...

301
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,208
...into the ring, eh?

302
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,415
Lisa, dance with Todd.

303
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,920
- Dean Dunn, I...
- Do it.

304
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,789
Why are you smiling? You're next.

305
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,258
How's your boyfriend?

306
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,496
I may have to dance with you,
but I don't have to talk to you.

307
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,924
- You sure do sweat a lot.
- Shut up and dance.

308
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,100
Oh, no.

309
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,667
Oh, my god.

310
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,717
Oh, my...

311
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,381
You're a dog.
I've been dancing with a dog.

312
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,786
Yeah, I knew you had it in you!

313
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,979
Look out!

314
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,753
Mrs. Woodbury, be careful.

315
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,286
I can't believe they're doing this.

316
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,804
Let me give you a hand with that.

317
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,133
This has gone much too far.

318
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,679
Miss Goldfluss,
do you have an explanation for this?

319
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,841
What are you so upset about?

320
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,510
Upset, Stiles?

321
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,345
Me, upset?

322
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,353
I just had a beard all over my body, okay?

323
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,620
- I had fingernails the size of French fries.
- So?

324
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,925
Teeth from here to Texas,
and she called me a dog.

325
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,032
- A dog, Stiles!
- Okay.

326
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,501
I might be able to cut you a deal.

327
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:08,936
If they'll let you keep the scholarship,
you'll promise to be the school mascot.

328
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,373
- Yeah?
- This is just the tip of the iceberg, buddy!

329
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:16,914
The whole school will be talking about you.
All you got to do is be the wolf, Todd.

330
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,813
- I'll take care of the rest.
- Wonderful.

331
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,149
Wonderful!

332
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,153
She called me a dog.

333
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,823
The bed they laid him in
was only six feet long.

334
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:34,698
His feet hung over the end.

335
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:40,266
Mary, his wife, clung to his side.

336
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,036
Her tears mingled with his blood.

337
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:50,409
Her prayers echoed the grief
of an entire nation.

338
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,483
The small projectile from the derringer...

339
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,017
...that John Wilkes Booth used...

340
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,814
...was still lodged in his left temple.
- I got fleas. You distract him.

341
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,253
- And all night long...
- Hi.

342
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:09,656
...the vigil waited in that small boarding
house across from Ford's theatre...

343
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,635
...until the wee hours in the morning...

344
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,275
...when fate dealt that final blow.

345
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,840
A crowd of mourners gathered.

346
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:29,045
White, black, rich and poor.

347
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,252
And so, 10 hours after that fatal shot...

348
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,821
...President Abraham Lincoln...

349
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,989
Mr. Howard, where are you going?

350
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,234
I've been wanting
to speak with you, young man.

351
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,537
Your disruptive behavior
at yesterday's reception...

352
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,239
...warrants my personal
attention, don't you think?

353
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,277
I don't like practical jokes.

354
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,949
I am not a funny man.

355
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:08,323
Frankly, I fail to see the humor
of dressing up in a dog costume...

356
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,291
...and trying to frighten our alumni.

357
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:14,388
- But, Dean Dunn...
- Don't give me any of that back talk.

358
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,800
If you're trying to push me...

359
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,803
...you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

360
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:31,073
Your first fight is coming up.
So far, I'm unimpressed.

361
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,646
You'd better not fail me...

362
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,446
...because if you do...

363
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:39,512
...I’ll call every dean at every school...

364
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:43,722
...and you'll never go to college,
anywhere, ever.

365
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,298
Do I make myself crystal clear?

366
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,695
Strange boy.

367
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,705
Excuse me.

368
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,881
It's that guy.
You know, the guy who turned into a dog?

369
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,011
He's really weird.

370
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,114
Everybody's scratching around here.

371
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,594
Todd, we're all looking forward
to your presentation. Are you ready?

372
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,398
Yeah. I think so.

373
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,608
Todd, I want to see you.

374
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,042
All right, everyone.
That's all for today. Thank you.

375
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,377
Do you want to go to lunch?

376
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,509
You don't want to be seen with me.
I'm a dog.

377
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,883
Do you want to go to lunch, or not?

378
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,680
Nicki, I've got to go see the professor.

379
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,657
They're giving you a hard time, aren't they?

380
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,334
I'm your faculty advisor.
Maybe there's something I can do.

381
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,835
- I don't think so.
- I would like to try.

382
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,538
You have a talent for science.
Let's start with that.

383
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,968
No matter what anybody
says or does to you...

384
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,772
...don't lose sight of your goals.

385
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:10,776
All I wanted was to study hard
and become a veterinarian.

386
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,974
I can help you with that.
You're a very bright young man, Todd.

387
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:18,278
You'll find a way to deal
with your other problems.

388
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,749
If you only knew, Professor Brooks.

389
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,092
I'll do my very best to try and understand.

390
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,156
In any case,
I'm always here if you need me.

391
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,689
Okay.

392
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,183
I hope you're hungry.
I got a ton of stuff here.

393
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,218
You like chicken, don't you?

394
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,596
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I'm hungry.

395
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,031
Drumstick?

396
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,964
You know what I mean.

397
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,634
Listen.

398
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,436
Biologically speaking,
it's absolutely fascinating...

399
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,944
...what's happened to you.

400
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:21,212
If you think I'm going to feel sorry for you,
you can forget it.

401
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:22,848
But I'm a dog.

402
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,821
You'll be okay.

403
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:27,683
You will.

404
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,533
One, two, three. Come on.
You're outta here.

405
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,636
Bring the doctor in here.

406
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,174
- How many does that make?
- Three for them. None for us.

407
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,680
Okay, you're up next, big guy.

408
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,658
Coach, it isn't my weight class.

409
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,687
That'll be my problem, okay? Go on.

410
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,564
What do I... What if I...

411
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,233
You got to be kidding. That guy's a tub.
He outweighs my guy by 50 pounds.

412
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,274
It's all water weight. Look at him.

413
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,986
All right, Chubby, look tough.

414
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,189
Let's box.

415
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,426
- What are you doing?
- Put him down.

416
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,960
- Put me down!
- I'm warning you.

417
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,265
All right. Let's box.

418
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,472
- You pig!
- I'm warning you. Come on.

419
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:25,803
Come on.

420
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,208
Use your weight, Chub.

421
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,747
Break loose!

422
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,344
All right. Come on, get over there.

423
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,921
That's the last fight you win.

424
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,329
All right, Chubby.

425
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,573
All right, Gus. Take him, babe.

426
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,007
Get out there, babe. All right.

427
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,056
Get in there.

428
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:05,906
Let's box!

429
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,143
You're next.

430
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:52,723
Next!

431
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,661
Don't worry,
there's a good hospital on campus.

432
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:02,096
Let's get this over with,
I got a date in a half hour.

433
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,402
Let's go, Big Blue, let's go!

434
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,381
This makes or breaks your career.

435
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:23,876
We want a knock out!

436
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,620
Let's go, Pug!

437
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,954
You're going to die.

438
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,554
I know.

439
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,508
Move!

440
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,406
Knock him out!

441
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:52,783
Great move!

442
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,316
I'll break your kneecaps
if you don't keep still and let me hit you.

443
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:06,963
Come on, Pug!

444
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,915
All right.

445
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,110
Yeah! All right, get back over there.
Come on.

446
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,577
You're history.

447
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,914
I knew Pug would win that fight.

448
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,259
You okay, kid?

449
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:41,463
- One, two.
- Todd, get up. Come on!

450
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,563
Get up! Don't lay there like a fish.

451
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,900
Three.

452
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,013
Four.

453
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:04,611
Five.

454
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,431
Holy shit!

455
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:22,529
What is this?

456
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,631
It's that dog you were dancing with.

457
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,175
You want to stop the fight?

458
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,605
Hell, no. Go on.

459
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,650
All right. Box!

460
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:43,791
Stay away from him.

461
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,188
Nail him.

462
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,713
What are you doing?
Get in there and kill him.

463
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,354
He's got a right hook. He can fight.

464
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,567
Murder him!

465
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:41,978
You're out.

466
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,874
Have no fear, Stiles is here.

467
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:09,570
We're going to rock 'n' roll.
The brewskis are coming, everybody.

468
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,343
We're going to have a party.
We're going to have so much fun.

469
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,787
We need music!

470
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:22,050
<i>Is this thing on? Can you hear me?</i>

471
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,887
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

472
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:27,224
<i>... we have a very special guest</i>
<i>with us this evening.</i>

473
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:31,231
<i>Not only does our teen wolf</i>
<i>throw a punch like lightning...</i>

474
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,696

477
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,512
<i>"You didn't even want me around</i>

478
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,116
<i>"But now I'm back</i>

479
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,809

00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,069

487
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,441

488
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,480
<i>"With just a little bit of soul now</i>

489
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,451
<i>"Yeah</i>

490
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,614

00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,754

<i>"Crazy"</i>

515
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:48,159
We've arrived!

516
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,873
Look what I got.

517
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,177
Boys and girls of all ages...

518
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:14,718
...come and see Stiles, the man.
I've got the stuff for you.

519
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,397
Break!

520
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,601
The championship,
it's just two weeks away.

521
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:26,273
It's down to just you and that wolf.
Any predictions?

522
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,716
Every dog has his day, and his is mine.

523
00:53:58,868 --> 00:53:59,926
Hello?

524
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,072
- Emily.
- Stiles.

525
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,871
- Yeah?
- Go away.

526
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:09,670
What?

527
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,374
You don't mind, do you, buddy?

528
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:14,977
Lisa!

529
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:19,382
- Todd!
- Stiles, beat it.

530
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:20,816
Chubby?

531
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:47,607
What?

532
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,351
I've created a monster.

533
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,614
Okay, so I was absent
the day you guys did this.

534
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,517
Are you mad at me?

535
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:32,061
- You're jealous.
- What?

536
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,722
Of those two leeches
you've been hanging around with?

537
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,924
You can't even see it, can you?

538
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:39,898
They don't like you, only the wolf.

539
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,237
Just because everything's
going great for me...

540
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,509
...doesn't give you
the right to go off and start judging...

541
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:54,946
You just hit me with a dead frog.

542
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:56,775
Jerk.

543
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,062
Frog fight!

544
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:20,735
Incoming!

545
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,852
What is going on here?

546
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,257
Frog fighting in my lab?

547
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,592
Put those things away.

548
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:43,463
That's the end of class for today.

549
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,324
Except for you.

550
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,833
I want to talk to you.

551
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:11,392
I've been talking
with your other professors.

552
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:15,396
I know about the car,
about the grades you're getting...

553
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,295
...and how you're coasting through.

554
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:19,429
It's like anything else in life.

555
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:23,438
When you have a gift,
you have a responsibility to use it wisely.

556
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,138
You're not.

557
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,908
And you're only letting yourself down.

558
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:30,275
Are you in a hurry?

559
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,941
Yeah, actually, I have to get to practice.

560
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,480
Team's nothing without the wolf.

561
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:40,352
You can't face life as a wolf
and expect it to solve all your problems.

562
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,585
You do realize you have finals coming up,
don't you?

563
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,986
Yeah. Regional finals.

564
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,427
No. Course finals.

565
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:55,498
Listen, I don't think I need this class.

566
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,498
You told me to choose the right path.

567
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,302
And with the road that I've chosen...

568
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:05,814
...I don't think I need biology at all.

569
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:12,178
I'm very sorry to hear that.

570
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,828
You waited for me?

571
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,330
I don't know why.

572
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:37,778
You know, I never thought I'd say it,
but I miss the old Todd.

573
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,717
What happened?

574
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:44,710
He turned into a werewolf.

575
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,785
But that's not the real you.

576
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:50,988
The wolf lets me do what I want to do.
Okay? It's a gift.

577
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:53,158
I've a responsibility to myself...

578
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:54,455
Responsibility?

579
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:57,465
What about school?
What about wanting to be a veterinarian?

580
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,665
What about you and me?

581
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:06,938
My feelings for you are real.
They have nothing to do with the wolf.

582
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:10,141
Those others could care less
about the real you.

583
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,111
Look, I'm late, and you're wrong.

584
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:27,156
That's the way it's done, girls.

585
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,201
Watch this.

586
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,779
We'll play through.

587
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,348
How can you take him seriously?

588
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:58,293
He's a freshman...

589
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:01,630
...with an awful lot of hair.

590
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,263
Why don't you shut your mouth?

591
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:11,307
Why don't we settle this man to man?

592
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,840
- I don't fight chipmunks.
- Not here, Gus.

593
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,116
What are you doing?

594
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:34,690
Where are you going?

595
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:39,668
You die in the ring, pal.

596
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,140
Fore!

597
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:58,178
It's in the hole.

598
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:14,829
You guys studying?

599
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:19,502
Yes. Some of us
actually have to take finals.

600
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:27,473
Mr. Stilinsky...

601
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:32,381
...what say you, me, and the wolf...

602
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:35,517
...take the wheels for a little...

603
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:39,686
...spin?

604
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:41,288
Nope.

605
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:42,621
No?

606
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:52,437
How about you, big guy?
I might even let you drive.

607
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,567
What do you say?

608
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,004
I'm busy. Okay?

609
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,317
See you, Stiles.

610
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:03,984
See you, Chub.

611
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,255
Shot a 46.

612
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,123
You know, it's funny.

613
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:16,795
I wanted you to become the wolf
more than anybody else.

614
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,399
So I guess I'm partly to blame
for what you've become.

615
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:24,806
What have I become?

616
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:27,642
A jerk, Todd.

617
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,390
Thank you for coming.

618
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,923
I really need to talk to you.

619
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,026
You're in a tough spot?

620
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:26,792
Yeah.

621
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:32,600
I just let it get out of hand.

622
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:40,178
I mean, I know you warned me.

623
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,321
And I guess I should
have listened because...

624
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:51,519
I got a little crazy, Uncle Harold.

625
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:56,326
I ended up hurting a lot of people
that I really care about.

626
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:00,133
What are you going to do about it?

627
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:03,570
I don't know.

628
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:07,938
I really don't know.

629
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:11,742
Don't be too tough on yourself.

630
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:15,008
After all, you're only human, too.

631
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:18,175
So?

632
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:22,453
So, you made a mistake.
You admitted it. It's over.

633
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:26,624
Maybe it's time
you were Todd Howard again.

634
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:29,528
I'm scared.

635
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,169
Really scared.

636
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:41,404
I mean, if I'm myself in this ring tomorrow,
I'll get killed.

637
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:44,411
I don't think you're going to get killed.

638
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:47,179
This guy's really big.

639
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:50,812
- He's huge.
- Never mind him...

640
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:56,153
...because what I'm interested in is you
and what you've got right there.

641
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:02,930
What's that got to do with boxing
when the guy's twice your size?

642
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,136
- Uncle Harold, I wouldn't stand a chance.
- Maybe not.

643
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,873
Sometimes, you have to make a stand...

644
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:19,143
...even if it's the last thing you want to do.
- What's that?

645
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,716
These are boxing gloves.
They used to belong to me.

646
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:24,479
It may surprise you,
but when I was in college...

647
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,487
...I did a fair bit of boxing myself.

648
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,749
- Really?
- Yeah.

649
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:31,918
Maybe I can show you a couple of moves
nobody's seen in the last 30 years.

650
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:34,258
- When's this big match?
- Tomorrow.

651
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,694
Plenty of time.

652
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:09,191
- What are you doing?
- Studying.

653
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,926
I still have two more finals.

654
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,899
I guess you wouldn't know about that.

655
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,971
I'm real sorry...

656
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,174
...for everything.

657
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,019
I guess the wolf makes you a jerk.

658
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:34,578
No.

659
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:36,355
I'm a jerk.

660
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:39,951
I just hope that...

661
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:43,788
...there's still time to make up for it all.

662
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:54,276
There's still time to try.

663
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:56,572
I want to try.

664
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:00,907
You can start by saying
you're really sorry...

665
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,081
...for mistreating someone you like.

666
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:07,021
I'm sorry for mistreating someone...

667
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:09,757
...I really love.

668
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:23,396
You missed your final.

669
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,229
What?

670
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:28,773
Your final.
I'm sure Professor Brooks flunked you.

671
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:34,073
Maybe we could talk to her.

672
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,442
Yeah.

673
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,994
We were just coming to see you.

674
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,999
I know I probably don't deserve it...

675
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,501
...but if you're willing
to give me a second chance...

676
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,932
...I’d really like to earn my grade.

677
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,736
You can take a make-up exam
tomorrow at 12:00 noon.

678
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,504
That's the latest I can give it.

679
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:05,512
I have to turn the grades in
by the end of the day.

680
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,346
I have a fight at 3:00, see?

681
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:12,209
The test takes three hours.
You ought to just make it.

682
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:15,322
That's my final offer. Take it or leave it.

683
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,518
- We'll take it!
- Yeah, thank you very much!

684
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:02,428
It's time.

685
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:13,439
Good luck on your test.

686
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:15,636
Thanks.

687
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,609
And at the match.

688
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,546
Will you come see me box?

689
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:24,343
Yeah.

690
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,232
- Good luck.
- Bye.

691
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:33,917
That's the best I could do.

692
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,421
I missed a few classes.

693
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:45,863
It looks like
you did well enough to pass the course.

694
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:48,462
Great.

695
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:57,602
I really want to thank you
for trying to help...

696
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:01,214
...when things got a little crazy.

697
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,683
Welcome back.

698
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:27,836
Where've you been?

699
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,075
Taking a final.

700
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,546
Where's the wolf?

701
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:37,751
What are you doing? You got to go fight
in the 145-pound class now.

702
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,615
That's Peter's weight class.

703
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:43,183
Yeah, so what?

704
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:46,053
Look, coach, we are a team.

705
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,291
We're going to fight as a team.

706
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:53,701
By the way, I am going up against Gus.

707
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,867
That's great.

708
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:59,803
All of you, go out there
and get your brains knocked out.

709
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:01,205
That'll be attractive.

710
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:17,783
"Hamilton

711
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:22,894
"Thou art highest of them all

712
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:27,465
"We, your loyal subjects

713
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:31,331
"Are listening for your call

714
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:35,509
"Proud are we of your emblem

715
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:38,913
"Of your columns straight and...

716
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:40,372
White!

717
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:42,177
"White

718
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:45,811
"So let's get in the ring, boys

719
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:48,287
"And fight, fight, fight"

720
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,831
This is only the beginning.

721
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:10,776
From here, we go to the state finals,
then the nationals, the Olympics!

722
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:14,307
Remember, this is only your first year.

723
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,344
What you've got to do is fight and win...

724
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,086
...I’ll take care of the rest.

725
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:22,180
Grades, cars...

726
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,225
...money, women!

727
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,321
It'll be our little secret.

728
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:38,504
I hope you don't have any funny ideas
about not fighting as the wolf.

729
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:40,968
Oh, no.

730
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,979
Remember, I still run this school!

731
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,513
I hold your scholarship.

732
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:56,318
Give 'em hell, kid.

733
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:51,876
"Way to go, Hamilton,
way to go, fight, fight!"

734
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:02,320
Ready, and...

735
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,827
"Hamilton says, for all to see

736
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:08,021
"We're gonna float like a butterfly

737
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,859
"And sting like a bee

738
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:11,557
"We know how to punch

739
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:12,964
"We know how to fight

740
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:14,763
"We're gonna hit 'em with the left

741
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:17,304
"Then we'll hit 'em with the right"

742
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,967
Okay, Peter!

743
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,066
You're next! Go on up!

744
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,490
I'm sorry. I'm busy right now.

745
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:47,001
I know what you're doing.

746
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:50,361
I know about the car, the grades...

747
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:52,299
...and the promises.

748
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:54,135
I want you to lay off.

749
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:58,970
Todd Howard has a future at this school,
but it's not in the ring.

750
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:01,812
Who do you think you're talking to?

751
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,948
He'll do exactly as I say.

752
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:05,879
You don't own him.

753
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:09,316
Is this your idea of a threat?

754
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:10,547
No.

755
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:12,353
This is.

756
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,999
You don't know who you're dealing with.

757
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,342
All right, Chubby! Come on!

758
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:07,780
Box!

759
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:33,867
Let's go.

760
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:36,144
Come on.

761
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:44,886
Come on.

762
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:58,657
He's out. Let him go.

763
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,826
Come on. Put him down.

764
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:03,728
Put him down so I can count.

765
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:06,330
- Let's go. Come on.
- Good night.

766
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:07,834
He's out!

767
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:12,306
Chubby!

768
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:15,415
Come on out, dude.

01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,514
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

Wolf!

01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:38,763
<i>Todd "The Wolf" Howard!</i>

785
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:58,917
Where's the wolf?

786
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,190
Where's the wolf?

787
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,685
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

788
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:09,525
Are you crazy?

789
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,565
Come on!

790
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:14,096
Man!

791
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,897
What is the meaning of this?

792
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:19,440
Tactics.

793
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,941
I'll have him kicked out of this college!

794
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:24,238
Bring out the wolf!

795
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,938
Dean Dunn.

796
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:32,050
I won't be needing these anymore.
It's my last fight.

797
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:34,980
Good. I hope he kills you.

798
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:38,250
He probably will.

799
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,386
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- Are you kidding?

800
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:43,589
It pays to be positive, big guy.

801
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:45,299
Come on!

802
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:48,793
Box!

803
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,373
He made such a great wolf.

804
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:00,610
Kill him, Todd!

805
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,353
Come on. Hit me.

806
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:18,258
Come on. Hit me. Right here.

807
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:28,433
My grandmother hits harder than that.
Take that!

808
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:40,154
Come on!

809
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:41,782
Good round!

810
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:46,152
- Try that with me!
- What are you? Come on.

811
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:48,527
- Let go.
- Calm down.

812
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:50,392
- Round's over.
- Good round.

813
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:53,399
Back up! Look, I'm warning you.

814
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:12,653
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

815
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,244
Cut the ring off on him.

816
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:20,826
- How you doing?
- All right.

817
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:21,918
You feeling okay?

818
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:25,329
Keep them in, keep them tight,
keep them up. How's the ribs?

819
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,331
Chubby, give me some.

820
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:29,027
How's the jaw?

821
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:33,172
- Listen, I'm sorry I called the wolf a jerk.
- Don't worry, I was a jerk.

822
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:36,437
If you don't turn back into the jerk,
you'll get us both killed.

823
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:38,341
It's got to be this way.

824
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:40,976
Coach, got anything to say to me?

825
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:47,043
No.

826
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:53,723
- Go out and kick some butt, Todd!
- Take him now!

827
01:23:57,565 --> 01:23:58,793
Break!

828
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:03,530
- Step back.
- He's a baby!

829
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:07,902
Let's box.

830
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:24,725
Come on. Get up.

831
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:30,021
Break!

832
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:32,929
- Let go, you sissy.
- Break! Come on, let's go.

833
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:35,160
Break, I say. Box!

834
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:14,966
Come on. Sit down.

835
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:22,807
- That's an early bell!
- I said, "Sit down!"

836
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:24,578
God.

837
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:27,480
Come on ref,
keep your eyes open over there.

838
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:37,830
Listen, unless you're planning on
wolfing out on this guy...

839
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:39,991
...I suggest we throw in
the proverbial towel.

840
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:41,295
I'm not quitting.

841
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:46,204
Teen Wolf Too!

842
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:52,941
Don't worry. It's not as bad as it looks.

843
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:04,757
You're way ahead on points, okay?
You got both rounds.

844
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:08,659
Keep fighting the same fight.
Look at his face over there.

845
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:11,823
That guy's in trouble. You got it? Go!

846
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:17,403
Touch gloves.

847
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:20,169
Last round. Box!

848
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:26,072
Go, Todd, go!

849
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:28,449
Do it!

850
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:46,189
- I'm gonna make you howl with pain.
- It's gonna be a long night.

851
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:09,390
Come on. Back in the ring. Let's go!

852
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:12,653
He's going to kill him.
Somebody do something!

853
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:15,788
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

854
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:20,994
Are you all right?

855
01:27:22,804 --> 01:27:24,396
Get back in there.

856
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,965
- Where are you going?
- Home.

857
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:28,842
Okay. Let's box.

858
01:27:43,157 --> 01:27:44,181
One.

859
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:50,161
Two, three.

860
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:53,658
Four.

861
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:23,893
Get up!

862
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:32,666
Five.

863
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:40,871
Six.

864
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,358
Seven.

865
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:06,867
Eight, nine.

866
01:29:40,174 --> 01:29:42,836
Come on, dog. Fight like a man.

867
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:45,042
Give me your best shot.

868
01:30:09,103 --> 01:30:10,127
Break.

869
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,435
Step back. Box!

870
01:30:17,278 --> 01:30:18,506
He's out!

871
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:42,262
<i>The new regional champion</i>
<i>from Hamilton University...</i>

872
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:45,238
<i>... Todd Howard!</i>
