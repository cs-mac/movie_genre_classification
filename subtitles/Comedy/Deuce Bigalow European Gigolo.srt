1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,753
I got no interest down there.

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,920
Zero. None.

3
00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:08,252
Who's the new brass?

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,986
If it gets
somewhere new and you want the truth,

5
00:00:11,186 --> 00:00:13,077
find a veteran black cop
who hasn't made rank.

6
00:00:13,277 --> 00:00:14,894
He's probably on the outside
enough to be trusted.

7
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:16,511
We pushed them into the parlors.

8
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:19,003
Been runnin'
women off the streets for a while now.

9
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:20,795
The parlors are all payin' us.

10
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:23,194
We becoming extraneous
in this whole situation.

11
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:25,503
The money's still the money,
but the pimp...

12
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,127
Who the fuck is he right now?

13
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:32,045
How... how...
how did you end up in the life?

14
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:33,386
Come on, Harvey.

15
00:00:33,586 --> 00:00:35,294
You're thinkin' like a degenerate.

16
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:36,920
I am a degenerate.

17
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:38,553
What the fuck am I lookin' at?

18
00:00:38,753 --> 00:00:41,419
We're gonna call it a "masturbatory."

19
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:53,444
Hey, let me see that.

20
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:56,036
See what?
The lever.

21
00:00:56,236 --> 00:00:58,428
Why?
It's mine, isn't it?

22
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:00,678
Yeah.

23
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:03,628
Son of a...
What?

24
00:01:03,828 --> 00:01:04,503
What?
Yeah.

25
00:01:16,294 --> 00:01:20,277
Where are the latches?
Oh, wow.

26
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:24,461
Hey, ain't seen your mother in years.

27
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:32,052
All right, Frankie, half the job's done.

28
00:01:32,252 --> 00:01:33,860
The other half will be
complete by tomorrow.

29
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,669
All right.
Projectors work in all of them?

30
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:36,969
Locked and loaded.

31
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:39,961
You get the other half tomorrow.
All right.

32
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:42,003
Hey, hey, hey, hey, come here.

33
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:43,720
Do me a favor?

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,503
Load this one up for me personally,
all right?

35
00:01:46,703 --> 00:01:47,836
This one right here.

36
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:51,336
Hey, big man.

37
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:52,386
Hey.

38
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:54,673
So, you get the coin take from Hodas

39
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:57,150
and walked it over to Carlos, right?

40
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,428
How much this week?
Four to Rudy.

41
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:02,086
All this should bump that up real nice,
though.

42
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:04,294
They said it's gonna be
done by tomorrow.

43
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:07,711
Hey, come here.

44
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,795
Now, I figure you should
be the one to christen it.

45
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:16,461
I mean, after all...

46
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,377
Go on.

47
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:22,278
Whoa, not that one.

48
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:24,140
This one over here.

49
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,803
Yeah, this one works.

50
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:29,344
This one works real, real good.

51
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:31,544
Now, you're gonna want some privacy,
big man.

52
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,961
Now, I know your cock just jumped

53
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,898
right into your hand, Mikey.

54
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,836
There's no way it didn't.

55
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:50,003
Man.

56
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:55,169
Because you dreamed it, big man.

57
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:56,628
Because you dreamed it.

58
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:17,294
<i>Sisters</i>

59
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:21,252
<i>Brothers and the whiteys</i>

60
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,127
<i>Blacks and the crackers</i>

61
00:03:26,628 --> 00:03:28,586
<i>Police and their backers</i>

62
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,503
<i>They're all political actors</i>

63
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:36,628
<i>But they don't know</i>

64
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,461
<i>There can be no show</i>

65
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:44,461
<i>And if there's hell below</i>

66
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:51,086
<i>We're all gonna go,
go, go, go, go, go</i>

67
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:52,961
<i>Everybody praying</i>

68
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,336
<i>And everybody saying</i>

69
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:00,294
<i>But when come time to do</i>

70
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:06,052
<i>Everybody's laying</i>

71
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:10,465
<i>Just talking about don't worry,
worry, worry, worry, worry, worry</i>

72
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:14,878
<i>They say, "Don't worry, worry,
worry, worry, worry, worry"</i>

73
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:16,553
<i>They say, "Don't worry, worry</i>

74
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:18,553
<i>Worry, worry, worry, worry"</i>

75
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:20,511
<i>They say, "Don't worry, worry</i>

76
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:23,003
<i>Worry, worry, worry, worry."</i>

77
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:34,211
So, I've been approaching it
scientifically as of late.

78
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:36,720
Why not, right?
Better porno through science?

79
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,361
No, I'm not kidding.
Come here. Take a look.

80
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:41,803
See, past couple of months...

81
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:43,878
I've been sorting the quarters
from each machine separately.

82
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:45,857
Now, I know what film
I'm running on each machine

83
00:04:46,057 --> 00:04:48,117
and I never mix it up
before we do the weight.

84
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:50,177
Starting to give me
a real sense of what stuff

85
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:52,419
is bringing in the most quarters,
know what I mean?

86
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:54,003
Right.
Yeah. Come on.

87
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:01,386
This is your cheat sheet.

88
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:04,086
Consider straight fucking
and sucking to be a baseline.

89
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:05,303
Brings in coin, no problem.

90
00:05:05,503 --> 00:05:07,094
Mm-hmm.
But lesbian sex?

91
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:10,235
Oh, that's a punch
way above its weight class.

92
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,377
Lesbians, huh?
Yeah, cash cows, so to speak.

93
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:15,252
What else?
Black on white.

94
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:16,428
Interracial.

95
00:05:16,628 --> 00:05:18,753
Not so much the black
girls with the white guys.

96
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:19,886
Vice versa.

97
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,377
The bigger the dick, the better.

98
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:22,511
That sells, huh?

99
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:24,011
Yeah, I had a couple of new machines

100
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,136
over on Eighth Ave.
, the ones with the doors

101
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:28,795
so nobody can see what
particular kink you got going on.

102
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,553
Oh.
Showing only black on white.

103
00:05:30,753 --> 00:05:33,086
Pfft, those guys made more
money at the end of the month

104
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:34,482
than anybody else on the Deuce.

105
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:35,888
I also got some Danish loops

106
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:37,094
showing on some new machines.

107
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:38,969
Now, I couldn't put
the labels on those machines

108
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:41,586
because the cops would've lost
their minds and confiscated them.

109
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:43,795
But the customers
found them just the same.

110
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:45,274
Dogs.

111
00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:46,553
Dogs?

112
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:48,215
And one horse, actually.

113
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,678
Look, I know it's crazy,

114
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:52,553
but they can shoot that
stuff over in Denmark.

115
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,878
Actually, it was more of a
jerk-off scene than fucking.

116
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:57,127
Yeah, well, with a horse, I'd think so.

117
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,553
Now, me, personally, I don't draw

118
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,711
any inspiration
from the real rough stuff,

119
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:05,398
but there are customers that do.

120
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,086
I think I know why. Wanna guess?

121
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:13,303
Hmm? Guess?

122
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,927
Yeah, I'll take a guess.

123
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:19,845
Um... well, because all these guys

124
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:22,461
have been taught that women
could take it or leave it

125
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:24,648
when it comes to sex.

126
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:26,867
That we make choices,

127
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,886
that we're particular.

128
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:31,277
They see some pretty little white girl

129
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:33,469
fucking some big, rough black guy,

130
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:37,377
and it says, "No, women are
just as sex-crazed as they are."

131
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:39,344
That we have no inhibitions

132
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:41,569
like they wish we had no inhibitions.

133
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,795
"Shit, fellas, we'll even fuck the dog

134
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:45,595
when you're not looking."

135
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:47,882
I mean, that's the fantasy, right?

136
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:50,169
That's the shit we're selling here.

137
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:55,336
I see why you brought her here.

138
00:06:57,461 --> 00:07:00,294
I saw that scene you did
in the wedding gown.

139
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:02,711
Very notable.

140
00:07:06,086 --> 00:07:09,503
Still think you
got the pick of the litter, son?

141
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:11,803
Man, I like her look.

142
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:15,836
For real? The bitch is strung out.
I'ma handle that.

143
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:19,845
You'll see.
Shit, I would've jumped on Melissa first.

144
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:23,003
But three women is more than enough trouble.

145
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:24,469
No need for four.

146
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:26,169
I let C.C. beat me to it.

147
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:27,469
Oh, you let me?

148
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:29,902
Nah, see the hole in the fence?

149
00:07:30,102 --> 00:07:32,336
Shit fucks me up.
What? Her teeth?

150
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,169
Yeah, the gap.

151
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:38,469
Oh, man, that shit is hot, man.

152
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:41,944
Like that model,
that Revlon bitch in the football movie.

153
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:45,219
Oh, yeah, that's some
girl-next-door action right there.

154
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,878
Reggie just didn't
know how to present the bitch,

155
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:48,969
that's all.
Yeah?

156
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,423
Need to go the other way with her.

157
00:07:50,623 --> 00:07:51,878
All farm girl and shit, you know?

158
00:07:52,078 --> 00:07:53,011
Fuck the boots and minis.

159
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,303
Sell her ass in calico dresses.

160
00:07:55,503 --> 00:07:57,336
Like she just rode through
the Lincoln Tunnel

161
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:58,720
on a covered wagon and shit.

162
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,219
Mm-hmm, I see that.

163
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:01,969
Yeah, bet, son. Melissa's gonna earn.

164
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,177
I see it.
For real, Reggie had that wrong.

165
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:08,336
Reggie Love had a few things wrong,
come to think of it.

166
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:13,152
Man died right there on the floor.

167
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:15,515
Stretched out on them greasy tiles,

168
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:17,363
still talking shit to a smoking .44.

169
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,099
Now, how you know he died talking?

170
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,092
Motherfucker never shut the fuck up.

171
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,086
Till he did.

172
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,344
Thing is, though...

173
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,753
there's gotta be more game
out there than this, you know?

174
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:34,878
Yo, think about what we have, Larry.

175
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:37,086
The cars, the bitches, the vines.

176
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:39,294
Wouldn't trade it for the world.

177
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:40,920
Neither would I.

178
00:08:42,461 --> 00:08:44,127
Yeah.

179
00:08:45,252 --> 00:08:46,544
Yeah.

180
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:53,720
As good as Les Matthews?

181
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,548
Well, he read it over my shoulder

182
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:59,177
and vouched for it, so be proud.

183
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:01,753
Wait, you're starting the story inside?

184
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:02,678
You're not jumping?

185
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:04,711
We'll tease it off the front.

186
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,511
Tease it?

187
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,503
How are you
gonna tease an expose

188
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:09,720
of police corruption?

189
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,711
You've got me holding
the Lindsay Administration

190
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,211
complicit in the lede.

191
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:14,511
No, you have that.

192
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:17,757
We called the lawyers and they
told us we had to re-top the story.

193
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:18,906
You called the lawyers?

194
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:21,003
Yeah, it has to run
as a straight feature now.

195
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:23,669
Life on the street...
the girls, the pimps, the human aspect.

196
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:26,148
You cut out everything
about the protection?

197
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,388
About the parlors
operating in plain sight?

198
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:30,628
We've called out city corruption before.

199
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:31,678
You named names.

200
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,261
The precinct commanders,
the property owners,

201
00:09:34,461 --> 00:09:37,628
and lawyers off the corporate papers.
I have sources.

202
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,544
Unnamed sources and no
documents to back it up.

203
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:42,761
No corroboration.
"Amsterdam News."

204
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,586
Either get people on the
record or get some documents.

205
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,419
So, all these months, and in the end,

206
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,052
you're just gonna run a sob story

207
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:51,628
about the poor street waifs
and their hard-hearted pimps?

208
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:53,878
We weren't going to even take that,
remember?

209
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:55,377
But you wrote the hell out of it.

210
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:58,595
Like I said, be proud.

211
00:09:58,795 --> 00:10:00,219
Now, I'm thinking,

212
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:02,219
"Motherfucker, I'm short-timing,

213
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:04,961
and here you are trying to
send me to the pearly gates,

214
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,920
and my black ass ain't ready to go."

215
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,878
That's fucked up.

216
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:10,940
Sweeney.

217
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,003
Bielski's with him.

218
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:16,878
Collecting.

219
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:28,461
No rathole is too
small to be on the fucking pad.

220
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,920
Everybody in the precinct pays.

221
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:35,836
Sweeney has it locked down.

222
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,211
Maybe.

223
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,678
Maybe not for long.

224
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:42,678
I'm saying I think
some shit is coming soon.

225
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:46,169
I don't think us getting a new
captain is business as usual.

226
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:48,961
McDonagh?
I think he's gonna houseclean.

227
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,753
What do you mean you think?
He feel you out?

228
00:10:55,503 --> 00:10:58,094
I'm just saying.

229
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:00,628
I don't think we should
get seen with our hand out.

230
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,961
And I wouldn't stand
too close to Sweeney

231
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,419
or the other moneymakers.

232
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:07,523
Well, thanks for the warning.

233
00:11:07,723 --> 00:11:09,628
What do you think we should do?

234
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:10,961
Give the envelope back?

235
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:14,428
What do you think?

236
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:17,544
I think if we do that,
everyone in the house

237
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,252
will think we're rat motherfuckers.

238
00:11:21,377 --> 00:11:22,586
Yeah.

239
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,219
Take what comes,

240
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:29,252
but show no ambition.

241
00:11:29,452 --> 00:11:31,428
You dig?

242
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:34,169
It's better money than slinging
drinks in that shithole bar.

243
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:36,628
Am I right, Suze?
More fun, too.

244
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:39,252
You're the best.

245
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:43,219
Thanks, Mr. Pipilo.

246
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:46,377
Hey, how many times I gotta tell you?

247
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:47,927
It's Rudy.

248
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:51,878
I'll see you soon, doll.

249
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:57,753
All right,
you are now officially christened

250
00:11:57,953 --> 00:11:59,628
with your first VIP.

251
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:01,461
Oh, who had the honors?

252
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,294
Suzi, the Oriental broad.

253
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:05,136
Oh, shit!

254
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:06,819
The one that works at the bar?

255
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,303
I didn't know she tricked.

256
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:11,428
Look, gentlemen,
can we get down to business, please?

257
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:14,628
Yeah, first I gotta know what the
fuck's going on with these walls.

258
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:17,428
It's supposed to be a magic forest.

259
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:21,003
Hmm?
It's from this play, "Summer Night Dream."

260
00:12:21,203 --> 00:12:22,544
It was at one of the theaters on 41st

261
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:23,886
and they were dumping this stuff.

262
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:26,169
Black Frankie knows
the stagehand over there,

263
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:27,386
so we got it for free.

264
00:12:27,586 --> 00:12:29,336
Looks better than an empty wall.

265
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:30,428
"Summer Night Dream"?

266
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:31,927
Yeah, it's like a fantasy story.

267
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,795
I even got some of the
costumes in the back,

268
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:35,732
but nothing looks good on the girls.

269
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:37,669
Some fairy shit and a donkey head.

270
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:39,428
Fairy shit like homo?

271
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,511
No, like fairy tale fairies.

272
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:45,586
Ah.
Well, candy carnival decorations aside,

273
00:12:45,786 --> 00:12:47,045
this is nice for the VIPs.

274
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:48,261
You did good with it.

275
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:50,169
I especially like
the mirrors on the ceiling

276
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,052
in the rooms.

277
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:53,544
Nice touch.
That was me.

278
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:57,127
What? It was.

279
00:12:58,336 --> 00:12:59,845
All right, no disrespect, Rudy,

280
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,986
but I gotta get over to the bar,
get everything set up for the day.

281
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:06,265
Vince don't even like walking
into this place. Do you, brother?

282
00:13:06,465 --> 00:13:09,544
Hey, why don't you just shut
the fuck up already, all right?

283
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:11,878
Excuse me.
Okay, I called this meeting

284
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:13,261
to make good on what I promised you,

285
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:17,086
just like you made good
on what you all promised.

286
00:13:17,286 --> 00:13:18,428
That's your cut of my cut

287
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:20,344
of the quarters from the peeps.

288
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:22,381
Even if Hodas and them are stealing,

289
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:24,419
we're still making money hand over fist.

290
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:26,045
Fist over fist.

291
00:13:27,377 --> 00:13:28,845
Oh!

292
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:30,511
Nice.

293
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:34,377
Add that to what you guys took
in last month on the parlor,

294
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:36,377
and nobody in this room goes home poor.

295
00:13:36,577 --> 00:13:37,886
Am I right?

296
00:13:38,086 --> 00:13:40,586
Yeah.
It's like I told you, Vincent,

297
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,219
I ain't greedy.

298
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,503
You make money, I make money.

299
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,694
We're good together.

300
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,344
Take care of Suzi.

301
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:51,045
Make sure she's available for me

302
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:52,136
anytime I drop by.

303
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:54,252
And don't let her get
with any colored guys.

304
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:55,753
They'll stretch her out.

305
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:04,261
Oh!

306
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:06,586
Christ,
there's gotta be four or five large here

307
00:14:06,786 --> 00:14:07,761
just from the peeps.
Yeah.

308
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:09,586
After paying off Rudy and the cops,

309
00:14:09,786 --> 00:14:11,336
we pulled, like, $14, $15,000

310
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:13,856
from the parlor last month.

311
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:16,377
That's $20,000 in four weeks.

312
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,428
Hey, wait for your cut.

313
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:25,878
Just bring it by the bar. I gotta go.

314
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:31,127
Too good for the pussy trade.

315
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:46,461
Can I get you a drink?
WoYeah.

316
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:50,845
<i>Too many teardrops</i>

317
00:14:51,045 --> 00:14:54,252
<i>For one heart to be crying</i>

318
00:14:56,544 --> 00:15:00,294
<i>Too many teardrops for one heart</i>

319
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:02,503
<i>To carry on</i>

320
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,127
<i>You're way on top now</i>

321
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:11,761
<i>Since you left me</i>

322
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,923
<i>Oh, you're always laughing</i>

323
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,086
<i>Way down at me</i>

324
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,344
<i>Better watch out now</i>

325
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:26,669
<i>Baby, I'm gonna get... -
What the fuck is going on here?</i>

326
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:28,961
We thought we'd play some live music.

327
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,503
You decided? In my bar?

328
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:33,261
Paul and me.

329
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:35,127
The band's playing for their drinks only

330
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:36,919
and they get to pass the hat,

331
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,711
so what did we have to lose?

332
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:43,177
And look, we packed the house.

333
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:46,069
Yeah,
don't look like they're drinking much.

334
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:48,961
Why's the singer got
all that shit on his face?

335
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,503
I thought that went out with Al Jolson.

336
00:15:51,703 --> 00:15:53,211
He's part black.

337
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:58,294
Now I'm really confused.

338
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,544
You guys good here? Another round?

339
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:06,711
What's it all mean, Mike?

340
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,261
I don't know,

341
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:12,011
but I kind of dig it.

342
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:14,503
Come on, Sherry, let's dance.

343
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,753
Chris, Nita.

344
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:24,845
So, what do you guys think?

345
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:27,336
Not your usual guitar hero shit, right?

346
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,961
I saw them playing this rent party

347
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:32,045
down on St. Mark's Place.

348
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:33,469
The singer is wild.

349
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:36,003
More Velvet and street than Ziggy.

350
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,553
It's different.

351
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:39,595
Not really glam band.

352
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:43,045
What'd you say?

353
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:44,011
Glam band.

354
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,961
Gang bang... gang bang?

355
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,377
Did you say gang bang?

356
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:51,586
I'll be back!

357
00:16:51,786 --> 00:16:53,795
We did it!

358
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:54,720
Whoo!

359
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,569
<i>...Cry, cry, cry now</i>

360
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:00,219
<i>Cry 96 tears</i>

361
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,969
<i>Baby, cry</i>

362
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:05,720
<i>Cry, cry, cry 96 tears</i>

363
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,820
<i>Come on, baby, tears, tears,
come on, baby</i>

364
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,390
<i>Come on right now,
please, darlin'</i>

365
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,488
<i>Let me hear it now, now, yeah</i>

366
00:17:13,688 --> 00:17:15,586
<i>All night long...</i>

367
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:31,294
I wanna show you something.

368
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:34,294
What?

369
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:38,595
My story.

370
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:40,669
Draft I want to turn in, anyway.

371
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:50,920
That's what I want to see run next week.

372
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,969
But all the stuff at the top

373
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:55,045
about the parlors and the payoffs?

374
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:57,628
My editor is saying no.

375
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,219
Why no?

376
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:01,553
He says to name names like I want,

377
00:18:01,753 --> 00:18:04,836
I need my sources
to be named on the record.

378
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:08,003
Either that or some proof on paper.

379
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:09,961
A document or whatever.

380
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:14,003
Well, I'm not a source.

381
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:18,303
I think I made that clear.

382
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:21,503
You cut out everything that
makes the city a part of it,

383
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:22,720
and what's left?

384
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,503
A human interest story.

385
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,860
Uh, hell makes you think

386
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,669
I won't use my cuffs?

387
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:45,836
Maybe you will.

388
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,503
Well, how much love do you want?

389
00:18:55,461 --> 00:18:58,511
How much do you got?

390
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:00,861
How much for half-and-half?

391
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:03,011
$40 for half-and-half.
Oh, yeah?

392
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:06,586
And if you like it, maybe a tip for me.

393
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:08,045
Get up there.

394
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:18,753
I get a first-timer discount?
No, baby.

395
00:19:18,953 --> 00:19:21,628
I'm asking how much
loving you want here.

396
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,461
Gotta be $40 for half-and-half.

397
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,211
Can't be less, baby.

398
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,127
You thought that probably you might be able

399
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:39,752
to throw some light on the subject.

400
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:41,377
This might be one.

401
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:42,553
Leave her there?

402
00:19:42,753 --> 00:19:44,586
There's absolutely
nothing wrong with her.

403
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:45,886
Huh?

404
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:48,386
You mean I've been
pining away for nothing?

405
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:51,586
She was put in a deep hypnotic sleep,
that's all.

406
00:19:51,786 --> 00:19:53,553
But why? Why, Doc?

407
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:55,553
Hey, Harv?

408
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:57,586
You wanna pick the fuck
threads for Thursday

409
00:19:57,786 --> 00:19:59,419
or you wanna just let me do it?

410
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:02,469
What?

411
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,511
Oh, hey. Excuse me.

412
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:06,961
Candy, I'd like you to meet Shana.

413
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:08,344
Hi.
Hi.

414
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:10,386
How do you do?

415
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,428
Candy's a performer,

416
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:16,294
and my assistant as well.

417
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:19,511
Shana drove up from, uh...

418
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:21,636
Virginia Beach.
Virginia Beach.

419
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:24,753
She would like to make movies with us.

420
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:28,761
Oh.

421
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,795
You done this before?

422
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:31,961
No.

423
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:35,469
But you're in the trade?

424
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,636
Shana is a housewife in Virginia Beach.

425
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:43,836
And with her husband
she owns a small bookstore.

426
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:45,969
I watch the movies.

427
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:48,294
I think I can do what you do.

428
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:53,628
Before they opened
their adult bookstore,

429
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:55,544
Shana was a dental hygienist.

430
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:01,628
Rise and shine.

431
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:04,386
Why?

432
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:06,469
Or don't rise and shine. Fuck it.

433
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:10,169
But it's gonna taste a lot better
right now than in 20 minutes.

434
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,428
You had fun last night, didn't you?

435
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:19,045
You and Paul turned my bar into
some sort of rock 'n' roll show.

436
00:21:20,836 --> 00:21:23,503
You made money.
Yeah.

437
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:27,673
I did.

438
00:21:27,873 --> 00:21:30,386
So...

439
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:33,052
you and Paul can have
a third of the take

440
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:36,544
every Saturday night if
you wanna keep that going.

441
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:39,211
And I think we should
get a place together

442
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:41,377
and move in.

443
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:48,211
Why not?

444
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,469
Why would we move in together?

445
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:55,678
'Cause I'm tired of living
in a shithole SRO,

446
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:59,711
and you're tired of sleeping on
your roommate's sofa, for starters.

447
00:21:59,911 --> 00:22:01,940
I like being anywhere near you.

448
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,969
It doesn't make me unhappy.

449
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:06,177
I can't imagine living with anyone else

450
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:09,045
that wouldn't make me
go out of my fucking mind

451
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,753
in two weeks but you.

452
00:22:11,953 --> 00:22:13,094
Eh.
Eh.

453
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:14,136
This is so romantic.

454
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:15,720
I mean, one more double negative

455
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,252
and I'll just fall
straight into your arms, Vin.

456
00:22:19,452 --> 00:22:20,586
See?

457
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:24,177
See what?

458
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:27,386
You, with the smart-ass.

459
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:29,211
I always knew I should get with a girl

460
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:31,461
who's smarter than me.

461
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:33,711
I'd be bored otherwise.

462
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:39,086
Also, you're beautiful.

463
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:42,586
I mean, like,
you're the most beautiful woman

464
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:44,344
I ever been with,

465
00:22:44,544 --> 00:22:46,127
but you've always known that,

466
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:48,094
so I don't know.

467
00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:50,419
It's no fucking fun
telling you that part.

468
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:04,461
So, um, this new place of ours?

469
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:05,678
Yeah?

470
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:08,628
Does it mean we don't see other people?

471
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:09,927
We get real possessive

472
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,711
and we start living like
a sad-shit married couple

473
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:16,461
arguing over who takes out the garbage?

474
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,294
I take out the garbage.

475
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:25,795
All right, look,
you wanna fuck somebody, fuck somebody.

476
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:27,469
Same goes for me.

477
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:29,669
No questions asked, all right?

478
00:23:31,127 --> 00:23:33,261
Nobody owns anybody.

479
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:36,961
We just lay our heads
down in the same place

480
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:40,461
and enjoy each other when we do.

481
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,503
You take the garbage out.

482
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:02,336
Yeah, that's what I said.

483
00:24:08,503 --> 00:24:11,465
We'll be in touch as soon as
we can commit to a schedule.

484
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:14,628
I'm really looking forward to it.
Yeah, see you soon.

485
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:20,386
Am I fucking missing something?

486
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:23,007
Didn't she have a bake
sale or PTA meeting

487
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:25,628
or something she's gotta get to?

488
00:24:25,828 --> 00:24:27,344
Uh, she's seen the movies,

489
00:24:27,544 --> 00:24:29,611
she thinks what we do is interesting.

490
00:24:29,811 --> 00:24:31,619
I mean, how can I not give her a try?

491
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:33,628
She looks pretty hot, you ask me.

492
00:24:33,828 --> 00:24:34,761
Yeah.
You know?

493
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:37,403
Store clerks, housewives.

494
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:39,845
You know what, every day,

495
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,795
this thing takes another
step out of the forest.

496
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:44,678
Look.

497
00:24:44,878 --> 00:24:46,169
Look at this.

498
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:50,711
Invitation to an X-rated movie premiere

499
00:24:50,911 --> 00:24:52,219
at a general admission theater.

500
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:55,756
They mail these to me
with an RSVP and everything.

501
00:24:55,956 --> 00:24:58,525
Like some kind of gallery
opening or whatever.

502
00:24:58,725 --> 00:25:01,294
What,
they're just doing this out in the open?

503
00:25:01,494 --> 00:25:04,219
When they held over that cock film

504
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,419
on 55th Street for six months, you know,

505
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:09,428
and the police let it be?

506
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:12,090
I thought, "You know,
so it's the fucking fags.

507
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,108
You know, who cares what they do, right?"
Hey.

508
00:25:14,308 --> 00:25:16,127
But, you know...
Don't say that.

509
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:18,252
What?
Don't say that.

510
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,461
I got a brother.

511
00:25:25,711 --> 00:25:27,252
Well, I didn't mean anything.

512
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:33,252
You never said you had a brother.

513
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:38,319
We're looking to double the floor space,

514
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,169
so you're gonna need
to look at twice the layout.

515
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:42,219
What says the foreman?

516
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,303
I see lots of possibilities.

517
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:46,628
I can get us the right guys for it, too.

518
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:48,794
What now?
Hey, more business.

519
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:50,752
I couldn't wait to show you guys.

520
00:25:50,952 --> 00:25:52,511
What... what... what more business?

521
00:25:52,711 --> 00:25:55,795
We got a lease on this whole place,
all three floors.

522
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:57,136
And it's all cleared with the city.

523
00:25:57,336 --> 00:25:59,294
Gonna open another parlor
on the second floor,

524
00:25:59,494 --> 00:26:00,428
VIP room at the top.

525
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:04,503
Yeah. Over here, wall-to-wall peeps.

526
00:26:04,703 --> 00:26:06,595
The new kind with the booths.

527
00:26:06,795 --> 00:26:09,177
Whoa, whoa.
More fucking pussy?

528
00:26:09,377 --> 00:26:12,003
It's a bad thing?
What, you don't think there's a market?

529
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,720
Fuck, Rudy.

530
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,669
One day, I'm paying off
my brother's gambling debts.

531
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,136
The next day, my whole fucking family's

532
00:26:18,336 --> 00:26:21,511
neck-deep in running whores
and dirty fuck films.

533
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:25,336
The fuck?
Hey, you don't want the opportunity, I can...

534
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:26,595
Hey, hey, hey, no.

535
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:29,878
We want it, all right? Vincent, come on.

536
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:32,011
It ain't me, Rudy.

537
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:34,961
I'm out.
Then you're out. Fuck you.

538
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:41,803
Fuck me?

539
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:45,169
Bobby, you should be on a fucking
construction site somewhere,

540
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:46,961
not trying to run whorehouses.

541
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:48,553
Look at you.
Look at me, yeah,

542
00:26:48,753 --> 00:26:51,628
with my wallet fat, bringing in
more money than the goddamn bar.

543
00:26:51,828 --> 00:26:53,461
Mm.
Which is probably what's eating you.

544
00:26:53,661 --> 00:26:54,836
Mm-hmm.

545
00:26:56,503 --> 00:26:58,003
Fuck all of you.

546
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:00,965
Fuck you,

547
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:02,669
and fuck you!

548
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:05,636
And, yeah, Mr. Pipilo,

549
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:09,169
Rudy, respectfully, fuck you!

550
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:18,927
He'll come around.

551
00:27:19,127 --> 00:27:23,377
Hey, let's go see the upstairs.

552
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:29,419
You got my letters, right?

553
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:34,027
They were funny.

554
00:27:34,227 --> 00:27:36,586
I read them a bunch.

555
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:40,544
Yeah, shit.

556
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:45,336
I should've come by more often.

557
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,045
I'm sorry, I...

558
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,586
I just lost track of time.

559
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:56,586
Hey, there are a couple of years there

560
00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:58,544
I don't even remember.

561
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:06,586
That's not any better?

562
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:11,819
I don't know.

563
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:14,094
They say it is.

564
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:17,419
Are they still doing
the electric shock stuff?

565
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:20,052
No.

566
00:28:20,252 --> 00:28:21,961
Mostly meds for me now.

567
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:26,465
I don't think the shock treatment thing

568
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:29,344
is something they want to do anymore.

569
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:32,419
Dad was so quick
to sign off on that shit.

570
00:28:34,503 --> 00:28:36,795
He thought it would help.
Oh, fuck him.

571
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:38,252
I hate him.

572
00:28:43,878 --> 00:28:45,461
The look on his face.

573
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,294
Like I was gonna wear it out and...

574
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:54,261
walk down Queens Blvd.

575
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:58,344
Hey, that was my fucking dress,
remember?

576
00:28:58,544 --> 00:29:02,152
You could've gotten married
in it for all I care.

577
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:05,961
Hmm. Leenie,
the joke is I wasn't even into that.

578
00:29:07,461 --> 00:29:10,461
I just tried it on for a laugh.

579
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:13,094
Dad didn't laugh, though.

580
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:16,045
Patrick,
Dad doesn't give a shit about you.

581
00:29:16,245 --> 00:29:17,469
Or me.

582
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:19,094
Or who we are.

583
00:29:19,294 --> 00:29:22,419
He only cares about how it
might look to everyone else.

584
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:24,261
How the rest of the world might see him

585
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:27,836
if his daughter gets knocked up,
if his son likes boys.

586
00:29:28,036 --> 00:29:30,303
Fuck him.

587
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:32,878
Seriously, Patrick, who gives a fuck

588
00:29:33,078 --> 00:29:35,003
what Dad thinks about anything?

589
00:29:39,003 --> 00:29:40,673
I'm not homosexual.

590
00:29:40,873 --> 00:29:42,544
Patrick, come on.

591
00:29:42,744 --> 00:29:43,761
It's me.

592
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:45,169
He knows I'm not.

593
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:46,803
It's okay.

594
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:48,969
He knows. The doctors, they know.

595
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:51,127
Hey,
I've known you my whole goddamn life.

596
00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:52,261
I like girls.

597
00:29:52,461 --> 00:29:55,045
Name one girl you were ever with.

598
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:04,544
Shit, I'm sorry.

599
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:11,711
Patrick, the world...

600
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:16,011
it's changing.

601
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:18,586
And most people don't fuck with you,

602
00:30:18,786 --> 00:30:20,336
not like they used to.

603
00:30:28,377 --> 00:30:31,086
Dad would fucking hate it.

604
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,294
Shit.

605
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:00,052
You two are, what?

606
00:31:00,252 --> 00:31:02,177
Renewing your vows or something?

607
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:04,652
My husband's taking me to Delmonico's.

608
00:31:04,852 --> 00:31:07,127
And then we're gonna go see "Hair."

609
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:09,711
Hippie shit.

610
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,090
That a new ring, Fran?

611
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,984
Bobby got it for me.

612
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:16,618
It's aquamarine.

613
00:31:16,818 --> 00:31:18,252
Her birthstone.

614
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:22,678
You two should get a room.

615
00:31:22,878 --> 00:31:25,336
So sue me for being happy.

616
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:29,586
Heard from Andrea lately, Vince?

617
00:31:29,786 --> 00:31:31,294
No. Why?

618
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:38,419
She, um... she came around
to our house this morning.

619
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:39,753
She was pretty banged up.

620
00:31:39,953 --> 00:31:40,595
"Banged up"?

621
00:31:40,795 --> 00:31:42,836
Eddie Buccho, that son of a bitch.

622
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:44,969
He beat her.

623
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,798
Eddie Buccho?
All because of a pair of high heels.

624
00:31:47,998 --> 00:31:50,192
Yeah, he bought her a pair
of evening shoes from Saks.

625
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:52,586
She didn't want to wear them
'cause they hurt her feet.

626
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,336
And what's that loser do?

627
00:31:54,536 --> 00:31:55,753
He beats on her.

628
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:00,595
Piece of shit.

629
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:02,653
You know what the worst part is?

630
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:04,711
He did it in your house.
What?

631
00:32:04,911 --> 00:32:07,011
In front of your kids.

632
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:09,461
I gotta go to the bathroom.

633
00:32:15,003 --> 00:32:17,177
How bad?

634
00:32:17,377 --> 00:32:20,461
Black and blue all over,
but she ain't had nothing broke.

635
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:21,969
Fuck.

636
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:23,319
Fuck you can do, Vincent?

637
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,285
Eddie's with Twist and them.

638
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,144
You can't mess with that crew.

639
00:32:27,344 --> 00:32:28,803
You shouldn't have left Andrea.

640
00:32:29,003 --> 00:32:30,736
That's what your sister's telling you,

641
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:32,469
bringing that news in here like that.

642
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:34,965
You should go home.
What, the perfect husband's

643
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:37,461
gonna lecture me now
about love and marriage?

644
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:39,190
Hey.
That ring you bought Fran?

645
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,720
I was in here the day that guy

646
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,678
put all that jewelry out on the bar.

647
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,461
Couldn't help but notice
you bought two rings...

648
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:47,177
one for your wife and one for...

649
00:32:47,377 --> 00:32:50,252
I'm guessing that blonde
who works the parlor.

650
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:53,003
Her name's Tiffany. She's my friend.

651
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:59,586
Fuck you, Vincent.

652
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,377
Slide over, girl.

653
00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:33,969
All set.

654
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:35,595
But you didn't pay him.

655
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:38,252
Gonna do the full transaction tonight.

656
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:39,878
Saying you are.

657
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:43,169
You go in there with some money,

658
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:44,920
come out with the thing.

659
00:33:47,127 --> 00:33:50,586
Look, ain't no lawman gonna stop
a pretty little girl like you

660
00:33:50,786 --> 00:33:53,086
walking down the street with a gym bag.

661
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:54,920
Me, they brace me for breathing.

662
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,961
Shit.
You know this guy?

663
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,003
A player I know hooked me up.

664
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,086
Said his man's cool.

665
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:10,720
You my bottom.

666
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,419
You know that, right?

667
00:34:23,336 --> 00:34:25,069
Let's get a drink.

668
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:27,003
Anything you want.

669
00:34:42,211 --> 00:34:44,219
Hey, Vince.

670
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:46,086
Downstairs, in the stockroom.

671
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:47,294
Come on.

672
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,836
Therese, Claudette, watch the bar.

673
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:11,761
Hey.

674
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:15,219
What the fuck are you doing here?

675
00:35:15,419 --> 00:35:18,503
Snatched this hump off of
46th and he was making a fuss,

676
00:35:18,703 --> 00:35:20,274
so we needed kind of a quiet space.

677
00:35:20,474 --> 00:35:22,045
Frankie here thought about bringing him

678
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,377
in the back, down the stairs.

679
00:35:23,577 --> 00:35:24,886
And you let them in?

680
00:35:25,086 --> 00:35:27,382
We're on the same team, right?

681
00:35:27,582 --> 00:35:29,421
What the fuck?

682
00:35:29,621 --> 00:35:31,261
Go play the jukebox.

683
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:34,544
Loud,
in case this asshole gets emotional.

684
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:38,261
All right.
It wasn't me, Tommy.

685
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:41,294
Lock the door behind you.
It wasn't me.

686
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:54,177
So, it's actually, like, two cities

687
00:35:54,377 --> 00:35:58,045
because Minneapolis is
on one side of the river,

688
00:35:58,245 --> 00:36:00,211
but then St. Paul, which that's, like...

689
00:36:00,411 --> 00:36:02,336
the, like, cooler place to hang out,

690
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:04,261
that's actually on the other end,

691
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:07,961
so it's kind of, like,
actually on the other end of it,

692
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:09,553
so...
Girls...

693
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:13,878
why don't you get
yourselves another drink?

694
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:20,086
I'll be back.

695
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:25,294
Thank you, baby.
Mm-hmm.

696
00:36:31,252 --> 00:36:33,711
So, how's C.C.?

697
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,211
Was Reggie better or worse than C.C.?

698
00:36:39,045 --> 00:36:40,595
Shit, girl.

699
00:36:40,795 --> 00:36:42,878
Give me a moment to grieve.

700
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:45,511
Sure, take a moment.

701
00:36:45,711 --> 00:36:47,878
Go to church, light a candle.

702
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:53,382
Hey, hey, hey! Tommy, this is my bar.

703
00:36:53,582 --> 00:36:55,878
Yeah, but this gaguzz is one of the guys

704
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:57,753
stealing coins from Marty Hodas.

705
00:36:57,953 --> 00:36:59,761
My bar, Tommy!

706
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:02,211
Hey! Tommy!
You grabbed the wrong guy, man.

707
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:03,720
Hold up, hold up. Hold up.

708
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,469
Vince, what's that by the mook's head?

709
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:08,003
What are you talking about?
What's that case there?

710
00:37:08,203 --> 00:37:09,803
That's scotch.
What kind?

711
00:37:10,003 --> 00:37:12,628
Johnnie Walker, black.
The good shit.

712
00:37:17,294 --> 00:37:19,669
Come on, guys.
Come on.

713
00:37:21,377 --> 00:37:23,761
Now?
No, man, this is crazy.

714
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:25,757
Go ahead, shoot him.
You ain't gonna count to three

715
00:37:25,957 --> 00:37:27,671
or nothing like that?
What, like in the movies?

716
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,386
Fuck, no.
All right, guys, listen, listen.

717
00:37:29,586 --> 00:37:32,586
You'll get the money, all right?
Just not all of it.

718
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:34,627
But it's in a couple of banks.

719
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:36,669
And we just spent a little of it.

720
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:39,219
How much?
Maybe $20.

721
00:37:39,419 --> 00:37:41,503
Between the two of us,
just under that, maybe.

722
00:37:41,703 --> 00:37:42,857
All right, get rid of him.

723
00:37:43,057 --> 00:37:44,011
What, what? Hey!
You got it.

724
00:37:44,211 --> 00:37:46,465
No, no, no, no, no. Not like that.

725
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:48,920
Use my car, you take him to his home,

726
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,136
so we know where he lives,

727
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:53,045
and then tomorrow,
we go with him to the banks.

728
00:37:53,245 --> 00:37:55,045
Right?
Christ Almighty.

729
00:37:55,245 --> 00:37:57,045
Come on, let's have a drink.

730
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:06,211
You look like you prospering.

731
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:10,423
I'm doing all right.

732
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:12,711
Scrumping every day.

733
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,428
Brought my stable uptown.

734
00:38:18,628 --> 00:38:21,169
We're gonna spend the night
at my permanent crib.

735
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:23,753
Gonna make them both feel special,
you know?

736
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:26,094
Like how you taught me how to do.

737
00:38:26,294 --> 00:38:29,711
You want to control the bodies,
you need to control the mind.

738
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:31,377
That's right.

739
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,678
Mm-hmm.

740
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:39,878
So, uh...
so, what, you still in it, Ace?

741
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:42,386
Ah, I slowed down.

742
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,777
And my knees is all fucked up.

743
00:38:44,977 --> 00:38:47,169
I read the writing on the wall.

744
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:49,503
Told me to pull back.

745
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:51,761
What you mean?

746
00:38:51,961 --> 00:38:54,045
You operate on the Deuce, right?

747
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:58,052
Take a look around, brother.

748
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,177
Any man can drop a quarter in a machine

749
00:39:00,377 --> 00:39:04,252
and pull on his rod while
he's watching people fucking.

750
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:06,335
They do it in the movie theaters

751
00:39:06,535 --> 00:39:08,219
in every day of their lives.

752
00:39:08,419 --> 00:39:09,927
Man don't even have to ask a woman.

753
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:12,461
She just drop her panties
and get in the bed.

754
00:39:12,661 --> 00:39:13,469
Even ugly motherfuckers

755
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:16,590
don't have to pay for pussy no more.

756
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,711
That's why they call it free love.

757
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:21,920
Fuck. Listen, man.

758
00:39:23,753 --> 00:39:26,303
Always gonna be hos, right?

759
00:39:26,503 --> 00:39:28,669
And they always gonna need a man

760
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:30,127
to hold their money.

761
00:39:32,836 --> 00:39:34,628
Business is good, Ace.

762
00:39:36,544 --> 00:39:39,252
Mm. You should get back in the game.

763
00:39:39,452 --> 00:39:40,927
I need me a new ride,

764
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:44,127
and I don't even like them
cars y'all driving nowadays.

765
00:39:44,327 --> 00:39:45,795
They all look like boxes to me.

766
00:39:49,294 --> 00:39:52,586
I had me a '59 El D.

767
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:55,094
Red over white, you know.

768
00:39:55,294 --> 00:39:57,094
That Biarritz edition?
Mm-hmm.

769
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,920
225 inches long with them
big-ass motherfucking fins

770
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,011
and them four taillights.

771
00:40:02,211 --> 00:40:04,152
That motherfucker was beautiful.

772
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,094
Come on, man, Ace.

773
00:40:06,294 --> 00:40:07,795
You could find you one in good shape.

774
00:40:07,995 --> 00:40:10,511
Ah.
Get out there again.

775
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:13,961
A man has to know
when to step off the stage.

776
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:18,294
I had my day in the sun.

777
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:22,548
Ah, there's my woman.

778
00:40:22,748 --> 00:40:25,336
WoHey, Melvin.

779
00:40:28,336 --> 00:40:29,595
Ace.
Hmm?

780
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:31,503
Please.

781
00:40:43,003 --> 00:40:43,886
Hey, baby.

782
00:40:44,086 --> 00:40:46,003
I'll see you around, young man.

783
00:40:50,169 --> 00:40:53,586
Wol got you butter pecan.
Butter pecan.

784
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:55,511
You got me.

785
00:40:55,711 --> 00:40:58,294
WoWe still need to go by
the Rexall and get the medicine.

786
00:40:58,494 --> 00:41:00,669
All right, sugar.

787
00:41:24,419 --> 00:41:26,336
Tommy?
Yeah?

788
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:32,045
I'm not a made guy or nothing, right?

789
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:35,469
Fuck, no.

790
00:41:35,669 --> 00:41:37,377
But I'm with you, right?

791
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:45,252
So, what does that mean, exactly?

792
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:48,753
What do you want?

793
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,803
How you doing tonight?

794
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:58,586
I know you like what you see, baby.

795
00:41:58,786 --> 00:41:59,803
How you doing?

796
00:42:00,003 --> 00:42:02,761
Hey, juicy wrap. I know you love it.

797
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:05,211
Hey, sugar.
What you looking so glum for?

798
00:42:05,411 --> 00:42:06,511
You dating tonight?

799
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:09,294
It's all right,
you don't gotta be shy, baby.

800
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:10,886
Where you going?

801
00:42:11,086 --> 00:42:13,252
I know you see me, baby.

802
00:42:13,452 --> 00:42:14,878
I know you see me.

803
00:42:17,045 --> 00:42:18,503
Hey.

804
00:42:24,003 --> 00:42:25,628
Y'all don't gotta be shy.

805
00:42:40,294 --> 00:42:41,795
Shit.

806
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,428
Mm.

807
00:42:46,628 --> 00:42:48,586
At your service.

808
00:42:49,669 --> 00:42:51,927
Where your shadow at?

809
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:54,169
In the diner using the head.

810
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:55,052
Mm.

811
00:42:55,252 --> 00:42:56,819
What you doing on the street?

812
00:42:57,019 --> 00:42:58,386
I thought you were, you know...

813
00:42:58,586 --> 00:43:02,003
I wasn't getting chosen
all that much on the inside.

814
00:43:02,203 --> 00:43:06,511
Out here, men with special taste,
they find me.

815
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:11,211
You mean to tell me...
I'm a big girl in case you didn't notice.

816
00:43:11,411 --> 00:43:14,377
All I notice are those beautiful eyes.

817
00:43:16,211 --> 00:43:17,927
Damn, Alston.

818
00:43:18,127 --> 00:43:19,469
Been a while since I gave it away,

819
00:43:19,669 --> 00:43:22,211
but I might have to make
an exception with you.

820
00:43:22,411 --> 00:43:25,211
Mm.
I'm spoken for.

821
00:43:26,628 --> 00:43:28,544
At least I think I am.

822
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:35,469
Tell me something.

823
00:43:35,669 --> 00:43:38,211
How a dude like you get to be a cop?

824
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:44,169
How you doing tonight?

825
00:43:46,669 --> 00:43:48,840
Like what you see, baby?

826
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,211
Hey, sugar. How you doing?

827
00:43:54,419 --> 00:43:56,252
Can I make you date for a little bit?

828
00:43:58,211 --> 00:43:59,711
Won't take me long.

829
00:44:25,211 --> 00:44:27,003
WoYeah, what are you looking at?

830
00:44:34,586 --> 00:44:37,211
Not Eddie Sorrentino, Eddie Buccho.

831
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:38,982
Oh, which one is that?

832
00:44:39,182 --> 00:44:40,763
The one in Twist's crew.

833
00:44:40,963 --> 00:44:42,344
Twist over on Lefferts?

834
00:44:42,544 --> 00:44:45,211
That bunch of fucking humps?
Yeah, that bunch.

835
00:44:45,411 --> 00:44:46,219
Fuck, no.

836
00:44:46,419 --> 00:44:48,152
Mm, candy store gangsters.

837
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,086
Not one of them's made.

838
00:44:50,286 --> 00:44:51,961
No?
Nope.

839
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:23,961
Hey, hey, hey. Keep it fair, fellas.

840
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:25,961
One at a time.

841
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,236
<i>Hear me when I'm saying</i>

842
00:45:31,436 --> 00:45:33,553
<i>Smiling faces</i>

843
00:45:33,753 --> 00:45:35,590
<i>Smiling faces sometimes...</i>

844
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,628
Your shot or mine?

845
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:43,736
Who the fuck is that?

846
00:45:43,936 --> 00:45:46,411
<i>Smiling faces tell lies</i>

847
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:48,886
<i>And I got proof</i>

848
00:45:49,086 --> 00:45:51,127
<i>Beware
Beware...</i>

849
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,819
You Rufus?

850
00:45:57,019 --> 00:45:58,503
Yeah. Come on.

851
00:46:22,669 --> 00:46:24,069
It's all there.

852
00:46:24,269 --> 00:46:25,669
Looks right.

853
00:46:28,294 --> 00:46:30,336
Give me the stuff.

854
00:46:30,536 --> 00:46:31,628
What stuff?

855
00:46:33,503 --> 00:46:34,836
The shit.

856
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,527
Stop fucking around.

857
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:41,544
Okay, sweetheart.

858
00:46:51,336 --> 00:46:52,544
Here you go.

859
00:47:06,669 --> 00:47:08,336
You're under arrest.

860
00:47:10,211 --> 00:47:11,169
Turn around.

861
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:17,927
Just take me to the precinct.

862
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,628
I know Alston, Haddix,
and all those guys.

863
00:47:20,828 --> 00:47:23,011
We're not NYPD, hon. We're federal.

864
00:47:23,211 --> 00:47:26,261
You just bought quantity.
You're looking at long time.

865
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:28,795
Unless you wanna speak on that bold,
cowboy-looking brother

866
00:47:28,995 --> 00:47:30,052
who sent you in here.

867
00:47:30,252 --> 00:47:31,461
Maybe then we can help you out.

868
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:39,628
Come on.

869
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:56,753
Can I get that crate?
Yeah.

870
00:47:56,953 --> 00:47:57,961
Yeah?

871
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,636
Uh-huh.

872
00:48:03,836 --> 00:48:06,761
Okay. All right.

873
00:48:06,961 --> 00:48:08,652
Okay, let me know.

874
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,344
That was Harvey.

875
00:48:10,544 --> 00:48:12,303
His car broke down on the LIE

876
00:48:12,503 --> 00:48:15,944
and they're towing him to a garage now.

877
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:19,586
And he just wants us to wait?
Yeah.

878
00:48:24,961 --> 00:48:26,795
This your first time?

879
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:30,795
It's just fucking.

880
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:39,094
Hey.

881
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:40,753
Hey, you.

882
00:48:43,586 --> 00:48:45,169
The hell happened to you?

883
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:47,136
Ah, I hit this guy.

884
00:48:47,336 --> 00:48:49,252
This asshole over in Brooklyn.

885
00:48:49,452 --> 00:48:51,336
Brooklyn?
Yeah.

886
00:48:51,536 --> 00:48:53,469
Why?

887
00:48:53,669 --> 00:48:55,211
Beat on my wife.

888
00:48:57,503 --> 00:48:58,757
My ex-wife.

889
00:48:58,957 --> 00:49:00,211
Whatever.

890
00:49:07,336 --> 00:49:08,803
Hey, Vince.
What?

891
00:49:09,003 --> 00:49:11,632
Um, I've been talking to Paul,

892
00:49:11,832 --> 00:49:14,461
and he wants to open his own spot.

893
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:15,219
So?

894
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,344
So you should back him.

895
00:49:17,544 --> 00:49:19,294
Go in with him on a downtown place.

896
00:49:20,628 --> 00:49:22,961
He knows the Village.
Like, really knows it.

897
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:24,219
Mm-hmm.

898
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,544
And with money behind him
and somebody who could leverage

899
00:49:27,744 --> 00:49:30,503
paying off the cops like you all do...

900
00:49:31,795 --> 00:49:33,927
A fag bar?

901
00:49:34,127 --> 00:49:36,419
I gotta go partners in
on a pink bar now?

902
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:38,003
Why not?

903
00:49:38,203 --> 00:49:39,669
Vincent.

904
00:49:41,419 --> 00:49:43,632
Sweeney,
you were just in here last night.

905
00:49:43,832 --> 00:49:46,045
Now,
I know you're not back here that quick.

906
00:49:46,245 --> 00:49:47,136
Tell him.

907
00:49:47,336 --> 00:49:50,236
You guys didn't find a small book...

908
00:49:50,436 --> 00:49:53,336
puke green, about like this big?

909
00:49:54,544 --> 00:49:57,011
A book?

910
00:49:57,211 --> 00:49:58,878
I'll check with Mike when he comes in,

911
00:49:59,078 --> 00:50:00,211
but I don't think so.

912
00:50:03,294 --> 00:50:05,507
If you could just talk to him.

913
00:50:05,707 --> 00:50:07,720
Put that goddamn thing away.

914
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,586
You shouldn't have come
down here looking for me,

915
00:50:09,786 --> 00:50:12,127
not to the house.
But I'm out of time.

916
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:13,803
My article goes to press tonight.

917
00:50:14,003 --> 00:50:17,194
My editor... I showed him the
book and he says it's not enough.

918
00:50:17,394 --> 00:50:20,586
But if you could confirm, it could...
How is that not enough?

919
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:21,927
It's just numbers in there.

920
00:50:22,127 --> 00:50:23,969
Just a bunch of addresses and amounts.

921
00:50:24,169 --> 00:50:27,544
He says I need someone
to say what it all means

922
00:50:27,744 --> 00:50:29,460
or we still can't name people.

923
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,252
So, if I just say what it is,

924
00:50:31,452 --> 00:50:33,606
they'll run the story you want?

925
00:50:33,806 --> 00:50:35,761
Yes, if you say what it is.

926
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:38,803
And you'll keep my...

927
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:41,419
You'll keep my name
out of your goddamn paper?

928
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:45,377
I gotta go.

929
00:51:05,544 --> 00:51:09,052
So, Harvey can't make it today.

930
00:51:09,252 --> 00:51:12,586
He says that they can't fix his
car until they get another part,

931
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:16,628
and it's gonna be hours,
so he says to just call it a day.

932
00:51:16,828 --> 00:51:18,086
We still get paid for our time?

933
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:19,419
I don't know.

934
00:51:21,127 --> 00:51:23,261
Hey, fuck that. We're here.

935
00:51:23,461 --> 00:51:25,045
We're not gonna fucking go home.

936
00:51:25,245 --> 00:51:26,461
We're not?

937
00:51:30,878 --> 00:51:32,961
We rented the fucking camera.

938
00:51:35,419 --> 00:51:38,211
Can we get the prairie set lit?

939
00:51:39,377 --> 00:51:40,294
All right.

940
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:43,886
Greg, come.

941
00:51:44,086 --> 00:51:45,669
Bring the camera over.

942
00:51:48,336 --> 00:51:49,986
Bring the fence over, guys.

943
00:51:50,186 --> 00:51:51,836
And two of the props?
Yeah.

944
00:51:58,586 --> 00:52:00,795
Right there.
Yeah.

945
00:52:04,503 --> 00:52:07,090
Yeah, that's some wig you got there.

946
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,878
Kind of screams it's not really you.

947
00:52:16,544 --> 00:52:18,377
You're worried you're gonna make a movie

948
00:52:18,577 --> 00:52:20,377
and you're gonna get recognized?

949
00:52:20,577 --> 00:52:22,211
Yeah.

950
00:52:22,411 --> 00:52:24,045
So what?

951
00:52:31,419 --> 00:52:35,377
I see you got
quite the wig your own self.

952
00:52:35,577 --> 00:52:37,003
Yeah.

953
00:52:39,878 --> 00:52:41,419
I don't need it.

954
00:52:43,336 --> 00:52:45,045
How about you?

955
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:03,344
Hey, Candy.

956
00:53:03,544 --> 00:53:05,878
These are Harvey's notes for the shoot.

957
00:53:08,169 --> 00:53:11,086
All right, first up is Lori and Andy.

958
00:53:14,377 --> 00:53:17,094
All right, fire it up.

959
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:20,252
Let's make a movie!
Striking.

960
00:53:22,586 --> 00:53:24,090
Patrolman.

961
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:25,795
A word?

962
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:40,086
Anything we need to talk about?

963
00:53:40,286 --> 00:53:41,628
Captain?

964
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:45,461
A word to the wise, Patrolman.

965
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:46,595
I have your back.

966
00:53:46,795 --> 00:53:48,711
And when the shit
hits the fan around here,

967
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:49,961
I'm gonna make sure you come through

968
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:51,177
with flying colors.

969
00:53:51,377 --> 00:53:52,886
But the one thing I need

970
00:53:53,086 --> 00:53:55,386
is to know that I have
the loyalty of my people.

971
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:58,878
Whatever you know about what's
going on in this house comes to me

972
00:53:59,078 --> 00:54:00,461
and goes up the ladder from me.

973
00:54:00,661 --> 00:54:01,795
Understand?

974
00:54:03,628 --> 00:54:06,674
Trust me,
I am going to scrub this shithole clean,

975
00:54:06,874 --> 00:54:09,920
but I can only do that
if we keep our dirt in-house.

976
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,419
Yes, sir.

977
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:18,045
Where were you hoping to get to?

978
00:54:18,245 --> 00:54:19,469
Sir?

979
00:54:19,669 --> 00:54:23,544
I asked you where you were hoping
to go when the dust settles.

980
00:54:23,744 --> 00:54:25,636
Detective Bureau.

981
00:54:25,836 --> 00:54:28,045
I know that's shooting high, but I...

982
00:54:36,169 --> 00:54:38,045
Special delivery.

983
00:54:51,461 --> 00:54:54,795
Joss, come get her beautiful tits.

984
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:01,678
No!

985
00:55:01,878 --> 00:55:03,011
Shit.
What is it?

986
00:55:03,211 --> 00:55:05,011
This is backwards.
Should I cut?

987
00:55:05,211 --> 00:55:08,795
I just... I can see this is backwards.
What do you mean?

988
00:55:08,995 --> 00:55:11,003
Well, we're telling a story, right?

989
00:55:11,203 --> 00:55:11,969
We need Dwayne...

990
00:55:12,169 --> 00:55:13,920
Dwayne, can you come back here?

991
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:14,227
Sure.

992
00:55:14,427 --> 00:55:17,377
We need Dwayne's dick
to take us into Shana.

993
00:55:17,577 --> 00:55:18,636
Right? We need to be with him

994
00:55:18,836 --> 00:55:21,003
and follow him,
and he takes us into her.

995
00:55:21,203 --> 00:55:23,377
The dick takes us in.

996
00:55:23,577 --> 00:55:25,045
Right?

997
00:55:26,211 --> 00:55:27,636
Uh...

998
00:55:27,836 --> 00:55:31,344
Okay, the... the action is of him

999
00:55:31,544 --> 00:55:34,235
walking up and taking her from behind,
right?

1000
00:55:34,435 --> 00:55:37,127
If you start on her pussy,
you've got no story.

1001
00:55:37,327 --> 00:55:40,127
We're not with him
going to her to start.

1002
00:55:40,327 --> 00:55:43,669
It's like...
Hitchcock-Truffaut?

1003
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:46,045
Can I get a rehearsal?

1004
00:55:46,245 --> 00:55:47,428
Go ahead.

1005
00:55:47,628 --> 00:55:50,174
You just gave a pretty good explanation

1006
00:55:50,374 --> 00:55:52,920
of how action dictates camera movement.

1007
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,336
I come here and then like this.

1008
00:55:55,536 --> 00:55:57,553
The Hitchcock-Truffaut interviews,

1009
00:55:57,753 --> 00:56:00,753
but they're talking about
dicks and pussies

1010
00:56:00,953 --> 00:56:02,419
instead of... I don't know,

1011
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:03,886
a guy getting up from a table.

1012
00:56:04,086 --> 00:56:06,045
Can you explain to Greg
about Hitchcock and Truffle?

1013
00:56:06,245 --> 00:56:08,127
Because he definitely
doesn't understand it.

1014
00:56:09,586 --> 00:56:10,803
How's your car?

1015
00:56:11,003 --> 00:56:12,219
I gave up on it.

1016
00:56:12,419 --> 00:56:14,503
I called a... called a good cab.

1017
00:56:14,703 --> 00:56:16,678
Oh.

1018
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:19,252
Is this the last scene up?

1019
00:56:19,452 --> 00:56:20,761
Yeah.
Yeah?

1020
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:23,628
You direct them all?

1021
00:56:23,828 --> 00:56:26,052
Yeah.

1022
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:27,344
Well, finish it.

1023
00:56:27,544 --> 00:56:29,136
We get out of here in a couple of hours,

1024
00:56:29,336 --> 00:56:32,544
and then you and I can poke our
heads in at that movie party.

1025
00:56:32,744 --> 00:56:34,094
Like this?
If you want.

1026
00:56:34,294 --> 00:56:35,961
Yeah, like that.
Careful, you're in frame.

1027
00:56:40,544 --> 00:56:43,636
The bail is $4,000, right?

1028
00:56:43,836 --> 00:56:46,086
Now, the Gs, they ain't nothing to me.

1029
00:56:46,286 --> 00:56:47,428
You know I got the money.

1030
00:56:47,628 --> 00:56:49,669
Yeah, but you ain't gonna bail her out,
right?

1031
00:56:51,045 --> 00:56:52,628
Man, you can't be going near those feds

1032
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:54,128
showing that kind of bread.

1033
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,628
You can't show like that.

1034
00:56:55,828 --> 00:56:56,678
Nah, listen, man.

1035
00:56:56,878 --> 00:56:58,694
Unless she can put proof on you,

1036
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:00,711
you need to let her take the charge

1037
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:02,648
and do the the time.

1038
00:57:02,848 --> 00:57:04,386
Bail or no bail,

1039
00:57:04,586 --> 00:57:07,045
Barbara ain't gonna say nothing on me.

1040
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:08,711
That girl gonna stand tall.

1041
00:57:08,911 --> 00:57:10,169
You broke her good.

1042
00:57:11,503 --> 00:57:13,461
She loyal like a three-legged dog.

1043
00:57:15,336 --> 00:57:16,553
And Barbara's a good earner, too.

1044
00:57:16,753 --> 00:57:19,045
Yeah, and she still gonna
be when she comes out.

1045
00:57:19,245 --> 00:57:21,052
Provided she keeps her looks.

1046
00:57:21,252 --> 00:57:23,003
But anyway,
you can't be stressing on her.

1047
00:57:23,203 --> 00:57:24,336
You a man, right?

1048
00:57:26,961 --> 00:57:29,045
You know it.

1049
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:43,736
Hey, Ruby.

1050
00:57:43,936 --> 00:57:45,836
Hey! Ruby!

1051
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:49,211
Ruby, baby!

1052
00:57:51,586 --> 00:57:55,169
You wanna get out here, lady?

1053
00:57:55,369 --> 00:57:57,586
No, no, no. Keep going.

1054
00:58:18,336 --> 00:58:19,678
I'm sorry.

1055
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:21,419
Is that all that this is for you?

1056
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:22,920
No, don't even start.

1057
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,336
Sandra, Sandra!

1058
00:58:24,536 --> 00:58:25,544
Sandra!

1059
00:58:52,669 --> 00:58:55,111
You tipped off the captain.

1060
00:58:55,311 --> 00:58:57,753
For your own good, partner.

1061
00:58:57,953 --> 00:58:59,294
For your own good.

1062
00:59:11,795 --> 00:59:12,761
Hey.

1063
00:59:12,961 --> 00:59:14,219
What you think you doing?

1064
00:59:14,419 --> 00:59:15,595
Didn't like it. Don't have to pay.

1065
00:59:15,795 --> 00:59:17,761
Put that goddamn money back in my purse.

1066
00:59:17,961 --> 00:59:19,795
I don't have to.
Oh, you're gonna have to, all right.

1067
00:59:19,995 --> 00:59:22,107
Wait till I tell my man.
Fuck your man!

1068
00:59:22,307 --> 00:59:24,419
The fucking coon and his processed hair.

1069
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:26,219
How'd you know who...

1070
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:28,503
go on, get the fuck out of my room.

1071
00:59:30,503 --> 00:59:33,127
I'll see you around, Thunderthighs.

1072
00:59:33,327 --> 00:59:34,252
My name is Ruby.

1073
00:59:54,419 --> 00:59:56,720
Hey, hey.
Hey.

1074
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,294
Hey, look, they got a carpet
on the sidewalk and everything.

1075
00:59:59,494 --> 01:00:01,920
It's like the Grauman's
Chinese Theatres, actually.

1076
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,294
Yeah?
You look beautiful.

1077
01:00:04,494 --> 01:00:05,219
Thanks.

1078
01:00:05,419 --> 01:00:07,503
So, what, is that true?

1079
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:08,886
Fuck if I know.

1080
01:00:09,086 --> 01:00:11,836
I mean, we're gonna find out tonight,
aren't we?

1081
01:00:12,036 --> 01:00:13,303
I mean, this thing's making money,
though.

1082
01:00:13,503 --> 01:00:15,920
You know,
it pulled in 30 grand the first week.

1083
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,003
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1084
01:00:17,203 --> 01:00:18,136
Come on.

1085
01:00:18,336 --> 01:00:20,652
These tickets get us in
to some kind of VIP area

1086
01:00:20,852 --> 01:00:23,169
where they probably
give you a glass of bad wine

1087
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,795
and a complimentary condom.

1088
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,586
Good. Good to see you.

1089
01:00:33,786 --> 01:00:35,920
This is Candy.
Hey.

1090
01:00:51,878 --> 01:00:53,511
Hey, you.

1091
01:00:53,711 --> 01:00:55,753
How'd you get in here?
Marty, please.

1092
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:56,927
Sorry.
Come on.

1093
01:00:57,127 --> 01:00:59,169
Good to see you.
Save me a seat.

1094
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,503
She's with me.

1095
01:01:08,836 --> 01:01:10,094
Oh, there she is.

1096
01:01:10,294 --> 01:01:12,544
Linda! Linda!
Oh, hey.

1097
01:01:12,744 --> 01:01:14,303
It's the lead actress.

1098
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:17,882
They flew her in from Florida for this,
first-class.

1099
01:01:18,082 --> 01:01:21,461
It's like a
honest-to-God publicity tour.

1100
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:30,720
Excuse me, folks.

1101
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,211
I'm gonna need tickets for the VIP room.

1102
01:01:35,878 --> 01:01:38,052
No...

1103
01:01:38,252 --> 01:01:41,377
See, my girl here is an actress.

1104
01:01:43,377 --> 01:01:44,386
All right, guys.

1105
01:01:44,586 --> 01:01:46,586
I still need to see your tickets.

1106
01:01:48,961 --> 01:01:50,294
Fuck this here!

1107
01:02:14,294 --> 01:02:16,011
Hey.

1108
01:02:16,211 --> 01:02:18,711
You don't want to see the movie?

1109
01:02:18,911 --> 01:02:20,753
What, another fuck film?

1110
01:02:20,953 --> 01:02:22,127
Hell, no!

1111
01:02:25,795 --> 01:02:27,336
Hey, yo, bitch, come on.

1112
01:02:48,461 --> 01:02:52,336
A penny for your fuckin' thoughts.
I already told you.

1113
01:02:52,536 --> 01:02:55,795
Looks like she came through the awning,
knocked out the bars.

1114
01:02:55,995 --> 01:02:58,836
Did a lot of damage.
I'm gonna have to replace the sign.

1115
01:02:59,036 --> 01:03:00,377
You got insurance, right?

1116
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:01,428
I don't know.

1117
01:03:01,628 --> 01:03:03,127
I gotta call Rudy.

1118
01:03:08,711 --> 01:03:10,503
That's high up there.

1119
01:03:24,211 --> 01:03:26,803
Hey, you got business here?

1120
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:29,544
This is my crime scene, motherfucker.

1121
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:33,669
Yeah, behind the tape.

1122
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:35,377
So sad.

1123
01:03:37,836 --> 01:03:40,003
Did you see it?
WoYeah, I saw it.

1124
01:03:41,544 --> 01:03:43,836
The girl was in a hurry, I guess.

1125
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,086
What was that?

1126
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:51,003
I'm saying she could've used the stairs.

1127
01:03:54,836 --> 01:03:56,136
Come on.

1128
01:03:56,336 --> 01:03:57,595
Come on, come on, Alston.

1129
01:03:57,795 --> 01:03:59,586
Come on. Come on, man.
I'm cool, I'm cool!

1130
01:03:59,786 --> 01:04:02,678
Back it up.

1131
01:04:02,878 --> 01:04:05,252
Hey, I said back it up.

1132
01:04:09,086 --> 01:04:10,544
We might as well close up.

1133
01:04:18,544 --> 01:04:19,961
What?

1134
01:04:21,753 --> 01:04:23,252
Kind of cold, Vincent.

1135
01:04:26,878 --> 01:04:28,753
Hey, I liked Thunder.

1136
01:04:28,953 --> 01:04:30,052
I really did.

1137
01:04:30,252 --> 01:04:31,711
You think I like seeing that?

1138
01:04:33,586 --> 01:04:35,048
That?

1139
01:04:35,248 --> 01:04:36,711
Her.

1140
01:04:43,586 --> 01:04:47,795
That guy you fought,
the one that beat up your wife?

1141
01:04:47,995 --> 01:04:49,927
Mm-hmm?

1142
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:51,628
Who'd you do that for?

1143
01:04:53,628 --> 01:04:54,944
For my wife.

1144
01:04:55,144 --> 01:04:56,461
Who else?

1145
01:05:07,628 --> 01:05:10,003
You got me wrong, Abby.

1146
01:05:10,203 --> 01:05:11,503
Way wrong.

1147
01:05:13,294 --> 01:05:14,795
I love women.

1148
01:05:16,336 --> 01:05:17,628
But...

1149
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:20,461
it's the Deuce.

1150
01:06:02,961 --> 01:06:06,403
<i>Well, I say love</i>

1151
01:06:06,603 --> 01:06:09,845
<i>Oh, love</i>

1152
01:06:10,045 --> 01:06:11,669
<i>Careless love</i>

1153
01:06:16,252 --> 01:06:19,511
<i>I said love</i>

1154
01:06:19,711 --> 01:06:22,177
<i>Oh, love</i>

1155
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:27,336
<i>Oh, careless love</i>

1156
01:06:29,878 --> 01:06:32,469
<i>Love</i>

1157
01:06:32,669 --> 01:06:34,878
<i>Please tell me</i>

1158
01:06:37,503 --> 01:06:40,920
<i>What have I done</i>

1159
01:06:42,045 --> 01:06:44,845
<i>For you</i>

1160
01:06:45,045 --> 01:06:47,678
<i>To hurt me</i>

1161
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:50,377
<i>All in fun</i>

1162
01:06:52,586 --> 01:06:56,252
<i>Well, you know that I once</i>

1163
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,428
<i>Was blind</i>

1164
01:07:00,628 --> 01:07:02,878
<i>But now I see...</i>

1165
01:07:07,003 --> 01:07:09,586
<i>I say that I once</i>

1166
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,428
<i>Was blind</i>

1167
01:07:13,628 --> 01:07:18,753
<i>But now I see</i>

1168
01:07:20,419 --> 01:07:23,007
<i>Whoa, you know I once</i>

1169
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:25,795
<i>Was blind</i>

1170
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:29,927
<i>But I'm so glad</i>

1171
01:07:30,127 --> 01:07:33,386
<i>So glad I see</i>

1172
01:07:33,586 --> 01:07:36,927
<i>That that old love</i>

1173
01:07:37,127 --> 01:07:42,252
<i>Has made a fool of me</i>

1174
01:07:45,086 --> 01:07:49,257
<i>Well, you know if I could mmm...</i>

1175
01:07:49,457 --> 01:07:52,838
Come on, come on, come on.

1176
01:07:53,038 --> 01:07:56,419
<i>Like a mourning dove...</i>

1177
01:08:00,628 --> 01:08:07,303
<i>Well, if I could mmm-hmm</i>

1178
01:08:07,503 --> 01:08:14,052
<i>Like a mourning dove</i>

1179
01:08:14,252 --> 01:08:17,086
<i>Well, if I could moan...
Wait, actually, hang on.</i>

1180
01:08:17,286 --> 01:08:22,720
<i>If I could moan</i>

1181
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:28,003
Stick your ass out. Very hot.
Like a mourning dove

1182
01:08:28,203 --> 01:08:31,469
<i>You know I'd moan...
Come over here.</i>

1183
01:08:31,669 --> 01:08:37,628
Just come over here.
For everyone in love

1184
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:44,211
<i>Well, you know what</i>

1185
01:08:45,836 --> 01:08:48,636
<i>A big fool</i>

1186
01:08:48,836 --> 01:08:51,294
<i>I have been</i>

1187
01:08:55,586 --> 01:08:58,798
<i>Let me say what</i>

1188
01:08:58,998 --> 01:09:02,011
<i>A big fool</i>

1189
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:05,669
<i>I have been</i>

1190
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:11,211
<i>Let me say what</i>

1191
01:09:13,169 --> 01:09:15,711
<i>Oh, what a big fool</i>

1192
01:09:18,836 --> 01:09:22,423
<i>That I have been...</i>

1193
01:09:22,623 --> 01:09:26,011
<i>But I'd be</i>

1194
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:28,011
<i>I'd be one...</i>

1195
01:09:28,211 --> 01:09:29,628
You have rubbers?
WoYeah.

1196
01:09:29,828 --> 01:09:32,544
<i>All over again</i>

1197
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:38,511
<i>That's why I said love...</i>

1198
01:09:38,711 --> 01:09:41,052
Okay, baby, let me look at you.

1199
01:09:41,252 --> 01:09:45,086
I don't wanna see no drip.
I'm clean.

1200
01:09:45,286 --> 01:09:46,886
That's gonna be extra.

1201
01:09:47,086 --> 01:09:49,652
That's a whole lot more love.

1202
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,419
I got you.
All right.

1203
01:09:52,619 --> 01:09:54,252
No, none of that.

1204
01:09:55,586 --> 01:09:57,819
But you can play with these, honey.

1205
01:09:58,019 --> 01:10:00,252
Oh, yeah.
Okay, baby.
