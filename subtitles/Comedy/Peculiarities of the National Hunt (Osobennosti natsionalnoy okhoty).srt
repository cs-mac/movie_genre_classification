00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,444
- Bravo, Nikolenka!
- Good for you, Nikolenka.

15
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,988
- Well, I can do that too.
- Here you are, hold it.

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,741
Everyone can do that with a dagger.

17
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,166
Did you see that?

18
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,586
Zakharka! Don't mutilate the boys.

19
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,671
Daddy!

20
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,888
Well, let's start from
the Otradnevsky enclosure?

21
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:23,310
I think we shouldn't set all packs on.
We'll pursue by two groups.

22
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,939
- Well, shall we begin from
the Otradnevsky enclosure? - Yes.

23
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,733
Here you are.

24
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:46,625
Let's go! And you dare!
Don't do it as the last time.

25
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,173
Those with hounds, go!

26
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,720
Rayvo!

27
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,890
Rayvo!

28
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,227
Rayvo!

29
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,705
Why so much alcohol?
Hunting is recreation.

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,916
I'm afraid even that
much won't be enough.

31
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,753
After all, did You want to know
what is the real Russian hunting is?

32
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,048
Yes, I did.
But I don't like to drink.

33
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:41,221
It's voluntary with us.
Nobody will pour out by force.

34
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,057
Zhenya, I'll have a walk.

35
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:49,646
Don't be lost. Don't talk to the locals.
For them, a foreigner is just a wonder.

36
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,442
- They may take you for a spy.
- What?

37
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,821
Eh, you'll never perceive the features
of Russian out-of-the-way parts.

38
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:22,095
Pardon, it's really inconvenient to
trouble you, but my trumpets are burning.

39
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,307
I'm dying completely. Be so kind
as to present me a small sum.

40
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,476
Forgive me for troubling you.

41
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,855
Well, the trumpets are burning.
Make a donation. Don't let...

42
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,525
- I see, shall I exchange?
- Yes, sir.

43
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,699
Thank you ever so much.

44
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,712
Are there many foreigners?

45
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:01,343
What are you speaking about? What
foreigners here? The border is near.

46
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,881
Civilization.

47
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,060
- Are you gonna hunting?
- Yea, yea, hunting with General Buldakov.

48
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,230
You've got a very
strange number plates.

49
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,151
Devil knows what kind these plates are.
We've won that in an international lottery.

50
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,112
- So, you were lucky.
- Lucky.

51
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,032
- Hi, Zhenka!
- Hullo!

52
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:11,079
We've already loaded. Move!
Mikhalych is as angry as the devil!

53
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,042
- And you're a brick.
- You know, I've taken more.

54
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,336
Well, they've already swept all.

55
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,546
- Here's Rayvo.
- Hi!

56
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,132
- Serguey Olegovich.
- Khaapassalo.

57
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,135
- Sayenko... Are you a Finn?
- Finn.

58
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:30,599
- Do you speak Russian? - No, no,
Russian is a very difficult language.

59
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,310
Rayvo writes a book
about Russian hunting.

60
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:39,900
Russian hunting? Russian hunting
is a very good one. A bear...

61
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,195
Elephant. Russian elephant.

62
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,322
Russian elephant...

63
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,580
Russian elephant is the best friend
of the Finnish elephant.

64
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,000
Do you get me?

65
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,213
All right. This is...

66
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,093
- Let's urgently load aboard the ship.
- Yes, good.

67
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,643
You'd better drive the car to the
parking Lot. Otherwise it'll be stripped
to the skin in no time.

68
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,484
Well, how much we should wait?
We'll set sail in 5 minutes.

69
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,445
Mikhalych, we hadn't time to load vodka.
If we don't take vodka,

70
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,156
...then we'll fulfill the normative.
- Vodka we take!

71
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,910
Oh, here is our Finnish guest.

72
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,914
Well? Welcome to the land
of your ancestors!

73
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,041
- Rayvo.
- Soloveychik.

74
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,003
I studied Finnish at school.

75
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,547
Mikhalych is a general.

76
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,758
- Belt out something in Finnish.
- Will I?

77
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:53,182
Name? Rank? Location of your unit?

78
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,019
GI Khaapassalo!
Aerodrome protection company!

79
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:03,066
If you want to live, take us
to the rocket installation.

80
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,444
We don't have any rocket
installations.

81
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,490
I see, you studied the Finnish
language at military school.

82
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,077
Well, all I knew I've told you.

83
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:19,208
Mikhalych, what were you asking him about?
I hope, without anything specific military?

84
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,878
He asked how to get
to the Lenin Museum.

85
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,047
- Did he?
- Yes, he did.

86
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,133
- Rayvo, are you all right?
- Everything's normal.

87
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:34,515
Comrade General, battery commander, is
interested what will be your next orders.

88
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,186
Let's sail off. Anchors aweigh!

89
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,522
Aye. Anchors aweigh!

90
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,324
We've forgotten, comrade general!
We've forgotten a small box!

91
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,119
Comrade General, we've
forgotten a small box!

92
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,803
Ahoy, Rayvo, come on.

93
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,807
Sorry. I don't drink.
I don't want to drink.

94
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,309
- What does he say?
- He says that he doesn't drink.

95
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,520
- Doesn't drink?
- No.

96
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:26,984
We know how you don't drink. Don't break the
tradition, otherwise there'll be no hunting.

97
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,404
You must drink. This is
a Russian hunting tradition.

98
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,531
Come on! Yeah, yeah!

99
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,033
Well, this one to our meeting.

100
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,080
What I like in you, Mikhalych,

101
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,750
...is that you pronounce
capacious and meaty toasts.

102
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,092
Toasts at hunting must be short.

103
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,721
Like a command. Like a shot.

104
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,433
Or else, there'll be
no time left for rest.

105
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:08,108
I come here so many times and
still cannot stop wondering:

106
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:12,070
...what beauty, isn't it?

107
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,784
You only look around. Do you know why
there's so much spite in people?

108
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:23,457
They live in cities, never going to nature,
and spite accumulates in their souls.

109
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,043
And the outlet is crimes.

110
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:32,591
If they could come here though once,
roam a little bit, relieve themselves...

111
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,260
I mean...

112
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,181
...they would have lived much easier.

113
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:44,603
- Mikhalych.
- Well, this one to beauty.

114
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,691
Look, he's our man.

115
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:03,622
- Leave him alone. Let him rest.
- Don't worry.

116
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:10,170
He's tired. Working in the police,
Criminal Investigation Department.

117
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,256
Let him sleep.

118
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,062
All right.

119
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:40,158
Here come wolfhounds. People
in charge, don't fall behind.

120
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,995
Fellow Ivan, do you wish fruit?

121
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,789
Thanks, dear, thanks.

122
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,751
Yegor!

123
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,219
Here you are.

124
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,848
Don't fall behind.

125
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,662
Forward. Forward. Forward!

126
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,127
Come on. C'mon, c'mon, let's go.

127
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,048
Let's go! Let's go!

128
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:53,899
Come on! Come on!

129
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,338
Kouzmich!

130
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,844
- Kouzmich!
- Kouzmich!

131
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:25,138
Let's go to the bank.
We'll disembark ourselves.

132
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,875
Yes sir! A transport!

133
00:13:54,793 --> 00:14:00,215
This belongs to Kouzmich. I know, know.
Letter "K" is drawn over there.

134
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,803
Here!

135
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,599
Come here!

136
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,523
Easy, easy.

137
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,084
Kouzmich!

138
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:42,132
Well, Kouzmich, meet the guests!

139
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,802
Kouzmich!

140
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,147
There he is, in the kitchen-garden.
Meditating.

141
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:05,948
Kouzmich! Well, that's enough
to meditate. Meet the guests.

142
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,998
Well, Kouzmich...

143
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:25,300
- Kouzmich?
- Kouzmich...

144
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,142
- General!
- Kouzmich!

145
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:39,356
Vanka! Mikhalych has taken
sonny Vanka here!

146
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,775
- What son?
- So, this is a Finn, Kouzmich.

147
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,152
- I have a daughter.
- Lyova!

148
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,698
Kouzmich, you have acquired
one more cow, haven't you?

149
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,619
What for? I can hardly cope with one. And
wild boars are gone. Gone. Gone far away.

150
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,999
What have you taken the Finn for?
The Finn is interested in wild boars,
and I have only elks.

151
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,334
Get out of here! Get out!

152
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,333
Zhenya, when, at last,
will the hunting begin?

153
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,711
- As soon as the people have a rest we'll
go hunting. - Have you come to sleep?

154
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,172
- What does he say?
- He asks, when will the hunting begin?

155
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:48,217
Soon, the hunting will be soon.
We'll go there, to the remote cordon.

156
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,094
Why the remote cordon? This will take
more than 20 kilometers.

157
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,473
There are many elks.
Many elks. AII...

158
00:16:55,015 --> 00:17:00,145
Elk is a big animal.
Huge antlers, big eyes.

159
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:05,692
Oh, yeah, yeah, we have excellent girls.
Big-eyed. Well, you understand.

160
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:11,114
- You take her there, to a grove,
and there you... her... - Whom, elk?!

161
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:15,077
Well, brother, there's beautiful nature
there. She loses her wits, and you... her...

162
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:19,706
- You and I? - We go together.
You and I, together. Do you see?

163
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,627
- Zhenya, what did he say?
- He says that he'll do it with you.

164
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,005
No, no! This is not for me.
I love women.

165
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,133
You don't be afraid, girls are near.
It's elks what're gone far away.

166
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,679
Elks're gone too far, and girls are near. You
only give a whistle, it'll be enough for all.

167
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,890
- You and I, we'll give whistles together,
they'll come running. - No, no...

168
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,561
Stop, stop! You may not come here!
You may not come here!

169
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,939
Turn away! You may not come here!

170
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,526
What? What do you do?

171
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:55,701
Well. Who's done it?

172
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:03,750
Kouzmich, we thought you were calling us,
so we went in your direction.

173
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:11,008
Are you upset? Kouzmich,
Don't be upset!

174
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,343
Kouzmich!

175
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,722
Well, to the friendship.

176
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,816
No, I still don't understand,
why to the remote cordon?

177
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,570
How the beast could escape?

178
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,032
How? On feet, on feet.
He escaped on feet. Over there.

179
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:39,244
Zhenya, Kouzmich said
that he makes love to elks.

180
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,123
Yes, he loves elks. An elk-cow lived
with him for about two years.

181
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:48,795
Mikhalych. Mikhalych, you, as a military
man, give me an advice, what shall I do?

182
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,299
It could be nice to bring a cow to my
brother-in-law, to the remote cordon.

183
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,093
I don't need it, and
it's exactly what he needs.

184
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,764
Well, now I see,
why to the remote cordon.

185
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,475
He needs to transport the cow to his
brother-in-law. Have you heard?

186
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,144
So, we'll be transporting
it by boat, won't we?

187
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:17,574
Mikhalych, rack your brains,
so far you're a general.

188
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:21,078
Advise me, how can I deliver
the cow to my brother-in-law?

189
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:27,167
- By plane. - Are you making fun of me?
There are only bombers here.

190
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,213
Bomb compartments.

191
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,677
Only I'm not your helping hand in this
business. Make an arrangement yourself.

192
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,972
Haven't I given you an idea? I have.

193
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:45,477
Well, this one to the brotherhood.

194
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,856
Oh! Oh, my arm!

195
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,735
Cold water!

196
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,488
Mikhalych, don't swim
beyond the buoys.

197
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:46,246
I feel as if I'm falling to pieces.

198
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:51,251
My arms, legs, heart and soul.
I'm all separating.

199
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:54,254
What does he say?

200
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:56,965
He's well.

201
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,636
Bath, brother, Russian bath!
Translate it for him.

202
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:02,804
- Bath!
- Sauna.

203
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,353
Good.

204
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:15,025
Ah, you have come too, my little one.
You have come to warm up.

205
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,532
Who's there?
He happens to swill vodka.

206
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,577
It's Mikhalych, don't you see?
Under the guise of a bear.

207
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:39,091
- This is a bear! Real.
- You don't say so!

208
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:42,177
- Hold.
- Help me!

209
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:51,353
Serguey, won't it difficult
to pour cold water over me?

210
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:55,566
- Call the General!
- Mikhalych. Mikhalych.

211
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,280
- Mikhalych.
- Mikhalych!

212
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,453
- This is a bear!
- Quiet.

213
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:14,209
- Yes, this is a bear. It dropped
in to drink vodka. - Tame?!

214
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,628
Mikhalych. Mikhalych.

215
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:21,341
So, you say there are no beasts, yes?
Gone to the remote cordon?

216
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:25,053
- What shall we do? - What, what! Mikhalych
will come and lay down this creature.

217
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:28,557
Yes, if this creature hasn't
already laid down Mikhalych.

218
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:35,189
- Why is it yelling? - Why, why! It's got
drunk with vodka, and singing songs now.

219
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:42,821
Let it be as drunk as a lord... Listen,
may be you'll be able to get out of here.

220
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:46,241
You need only to run up to the house,
and there are guns there.

221
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:50,329
Aha! If you draw out
a short one, you go.

222
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,834
Rayvo is excluded. If the bear...

223
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,171
On the whole, we need no
international conflict.

224
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:02,132
I say, what conflict? International
conflict, do you understand?

225
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,219
He's also come to hunt.
Here's hunting, by the way.

226
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,930
- All are equal...
- Before the bear.

227
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:22,861
All right! Agreed.

228
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,999
Yes, Kouzmich, Kouzmich...

229
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,211
Now my gun is yours.

230
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,012
He seems to have passed.

231
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,517
Seryoga!

232
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,854
Seryoga!

233
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,983
Where are you Sery?

234
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:06,530
Hold!

235
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:06,632
Help! Help...

236
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:17,768
It's a long time he doesn't appear.

237
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:20,729
Quiet!

238
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,027
The bear!

239
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:29,488
- Hold!
- Help!

240
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:33,826
Give me water! Why are you sitting,
give me boiling water!

241
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:36,411
Hold! Come on!

242
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:39,581
Come on! Hold!

243
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,211
Let it go!

244
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:50,592
Mikhalych? And we took you
for the bear.

245
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,637
- I haven't understood.
- Mikhalych, what's happened?

246
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,140
Mikhalych.

247
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,810
Why are you carrying him feet ahead?
You should carry him head first, head!

248
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:04,565
Mikhalych, who could know that it was you!
We were expecting the bear! Mikhalych.

249
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:09,194
Why were you crying?
We thought it was the bear.

250
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:13,866
- Come on, come on, bring him to the planked
Footway. - Turn around. Turn around.

251
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:16,160
Don't give orders, turn around.

252
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,830
Oh, how can it be?

253
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,376
Give me light.

254
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:28,130
Mikhalych. How, Mikhalych?

255
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:32,593
Bear, bear... You could
hardly kill a man.

256
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,761
- Who, me?!
- Aha.

257
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:39,099
And who has hit me with a log?

258
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,519
- I really thought that was the bear.
- Mykhalych.

259
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:46,398
- Rayvo!
- Zhenya, the bear is here!

260
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:53,739
Very good.

261
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:57,868
Well, you, srew, have
staged a real show.

262
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:06,210
- What was that?
- It's still bear. Skunk.

263
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,546
If you hadn't growled when you
were getting into the bath house.

264
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,590
- We thought that it was our end.
- Yes.

265
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:15,636
- Where's that dirty scum?
- Where's that dirty scum?

266
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:18,347
- Where?
- It is lying there in the grass.

267
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:29,483
A cub. And what shall
we do with it now?

268
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:33,570
You'd better take it to a sobering-up
station, or better don't give it a chance
to kill the hangover. Let it suffer.

269
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:37,074
- It has gorged all our vodka.
- Well, bring it here.

270
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:41,662
Tomorrow my noddle will be splitting.
A young one.

271
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:52,172
- Whose that?
- So, these belong to Seryoga.

272
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,551
Seryoga! Seryoga, come out,
the bear is sleeping!

273
00:27:56,385 --> 00:28:00,389
So, it has gobbled it, skunk.
Has eaten.

274
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,350
Are you gone out of your mind?
Look at its belly.

275
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,435
Okay, speak up, where's Seryoga?

276
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:08,272
- What are you saying?
- I asked you, where's Seryoga?

277
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,983
You asked him to write an explanatory
note? He is too drunk to make sense.

278
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,694
Better speak, or it'll be worse for you.
Yes, he was the last who saw it!

279
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:18,282
Scum! He will tell me everything now!

280
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:21,994
- Scum!
- He's a bear cub!

281
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:24,746
A young bear.

282
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:27,624
Silly.

283
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:31,503
Ah, you scum!

284
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:33,922
Let me go.

285
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,862
Seryozha.

286
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,031
Seryozha.

287
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:05,204
It seems to breathe. Seryoga,
wait, we'll take you out!

288
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:11,543
Seryoga, wait, we'll set you free.
Have patience.

289
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,378
You, wait.

290
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,689
Zhenya, what's happening?

291
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:36,360
This is... training.

292
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,531
Before Russian hunting.

293
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:45,911
Easy.

294
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:50,541
Let's put him. Seryozha,
give back the gun. Give it back.

295
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,252
Give it to him.

296
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:55,754
Tilt.

297
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,343
This way.

298
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:07,015
I thought that it was the end.
I'm all completely numb.

299
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:09,268
Tilt.

300
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:11,895
This way.

301
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:17,776
What was that? Stop. Hold it.

302
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:22,364
Well, what did you expect,
it's the rescue facilities.

303
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:33,458
Well, bring this... to me.

304
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:42,509
- Quite small.
- Yes, small.

305
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:45,345
But it gorged much vodka.

306
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:49,683
- Kouzmich, what are you feeding it with?
- I told you that it's not the season yet.

307
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,481
Well, what shall we do with it now?

308
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,819
Yes? What shall we do with it?

309
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,864
That's me who asks
what to do with it.

310
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,867
Yeah. What to do?

311
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:10,662
Something should be done.

312
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:15,125
Say "June".

313
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:42,945
Oh, mummy! Mummy!

314
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,658
Be careful.

315
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:51,245
Don't anger it. Easy!
This is a beast, after all.

316
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:53,372
Oh, take it away!

317
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:57,584
You shouldn't shoot! I've told you,
it's not the season yet!

318
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:01,296
Quiet! Go away! Go away from here!

319
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:05,008
I'll tackle it myself. Go away!

320
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,719
Look, what a scum!

321
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:11,849
Easy.

322
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:14,768
Easy. Seems all is intact.

323
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:17,813
What a scum!

324
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,483
Scum!

325
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:26,155
- What a scum, isn't it?
- Easy.

326
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:29,783
- Scum, isn't it?
- AII. All's intact.

327
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,778
Who's shot? You've shot?

328
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:11,366
- Semyonov, will you drink vodka?
- Vodka?

329
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:15,871
Vodka...

330
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:18,665
...I will.

331
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:29,426
And I was guessing, what's the row?
And this is you having a rest.

332
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:37,309
And we've got an emergency case:
The cow was stolen yesterday.
With the letter "K" on two sides.

333
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:48,821
The huntsman is all right. There happened an
involuntary explosion of hunting cartridges.

334
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:52,825
Well, you write down like this.

335
00:33:56,745 --> 00:34:01,625
I'd like very much to go to a real
Russian hunting. Real Russian hunting.

336
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:06,797
Yes, the real Russian hunting
is very good.

337
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:13,637
I like hunting, but...
I don't have spare time.

338
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:18,725
Well, give it to me.

339
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:24,648
Lower, shoot lower.

340
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:34,074
- What?
- When shall we go hunting? Elk.

341
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:38,829
Ah, I see, I also feel like having a woman.
Only it's late already. They are all taken.

342
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:44,168
If only in a cow-shed. Cows.
Dairymaids. You understand? Dairymaids.

343
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,963
- You and I go to dairymaids.
- Aha, elk.

344
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,966
And... You see?

345
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:55,470
Only you should change your clothes.
Your clothes are no good.

346
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:09,401
You and I go to cows to make love.
Understand?

347
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:13,113
I don't so feel making love to cows.

348
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:23,457
- Zhenya... - Why have you smarten
yourself up, is it for dancing?

349
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:27,044
Kouzmich calls to make love to cows.

350
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:32,216
It's no good to refuse Kouzmich. I could
do it myself, but I can't be unfaithful.

351
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:40,432
And you go. Go.

352
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:51,652
I repeat, if there's no car, then they went
to fulfill an assignment. Or for vodka.

353
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:57,825
We've got plenty of vodka, so,
they went on assignment.

354
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:03,789
You were in a uniform alone.
Now you're without that uniform.

355
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:08,460
So, you went on an assignment.

356
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:14,466
But not for vodka.
'Cause we've got plenty of vodka.

357
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:22,349
You know what rumps they have!
Like this!

358
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:26,520
In Finland we also
have very big cows.

359
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:33,318
- And tits like this!
- Ours don't have tits.

360
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:39,366
Some knocking in the engine.

361
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:51,044
Here you are, moisten your lips.
Have a shot, they like it.

362
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:14,109
- Get your bearings meanwhile.
I'll go to fetch one for you. - No, no!

363
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:23,285
Kouzmich, Kouzmich, I don't want! I've lost
my appetite! In fact I've never had it.

364
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,293
Rayvo, come here.

365
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:38,509
Smile, They like it.

366
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:43,347
I see, in our Finland cows
also like kindness.

367
00:37:55,734 --> 00:38:00,239
We're mistaken a little.
Open up here come your people.

368
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:15,003
Well, how are they? Pretty.

369
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:21,635
- Pretty.
- Yeah, yeah.

370
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:20,110
Come on!

371
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:07,074
Stop. Stop, stop!

372
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:22,214
Shalfey and Valday are leading.
And who's the third one?

373
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:27,010
- Tuba.
- May be Tuba.

374
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:32,432
- Yeah, yeah, Tuba.
- No, it's Zvona. That's its barking.

375
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:35,978
Exactly Zvona.

376
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,885
Hey, chief.

377
00:43:13,552 --> 00:43:15,846
Chief, let me out.

378
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:21,476
Chief, please let me out. They've
held me here whole night long.

379
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,563
For the sake of Christ.

380
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,235
Chief, you what, you don't
understand Russian words?

381
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:32,821
Open up, I can't stand any longer!

382
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:39,912
- Kouzmich... - Seems we took
a little in excess yesterday.

383
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,789
My noddle's splitting.
Have a seat, let's go.

384
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:50,714
I studied it at school. I don't
understand. Have a seat, let's go.

385
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:59,890
But I've never been at the wheel. You what,
have drunken in excess? I'm afraid of a car.

386
00:44:00,432 --> 00:44:02,226
Sit at the steering-wheel.

387
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:05,395
Oh, my noddle's splitting.

388
00:44:07,064 --> 00:44:11,652
Kouzmich! Open up, Kouzmich!

389
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:16,240
You what? Turned to be a cop?
Open at once!

390
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,117
- Who's there with you?
- Move!

391
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:34,258
Well, Kouzmich...

392
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:37,177
Bitch.

393
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:44,601
Fascists! Held me here
for the whole night.

394
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:41,844
Protecting the nature?

395
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:44,721
Ecology.

396
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:16,670
- Why hasn't the cop taken the high boots?
- What high boots?

397
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:19,840
- You know, he was looking
for the high boots. - Semyonov...

398
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:24,678
...was looking for the pistol.
He's lost his pistol.

399
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:39,401
Black raven, what are you hovering

400
00:47:40,694 --> 00:47:47,910
Above my head?

401
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:58,045
You won't get your prey.

402
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:06,512
Black raven, I'm not yours.

403
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:07,698
- You've got a very big army.
- Is it bad?

404
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,451
Well, you! Stop babbling in a strange
language. For all that, it's a secret unit.

405
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:17,249
Which, this one?

406
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:24,965
Will come in.

407
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:29,553
Okay, let's go.

408
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:33,015
C'mon, c'mon.

409
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:40,189
You, warrant officer,
have you lost your Wits?

410
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:42,983
We'll go to tribunal
because of that cow.

411
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:45,611
Commander...

412
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:54,036
You've gone off your rockers completely.
All right, you do what you want.

413
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:55,662
Come on.

414
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:58,457
- C'mon, c'mon.
- Move!

415
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:02,961
- Well, drive it on. Come on.
- Come on!

416
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:06,006
Open up.

417
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:10,761
Move, dear.

418
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,770
Reliably?

419
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,940
- It'll fly up securely.
- All right.

420
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,959
What's he doing there?

421
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:28,630
Commandant. So, they've informed.

422
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:35,804
Stop. Where are you going?

423
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:40,767
Stop! I order you to stop!

424
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:44,229
Stop the engine!

425
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:47,524
Stop, I'll you to the Court!

426
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:52,446
Stop!

427
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:57,951
Stop! Stop going! Stop!

428
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:01,622
Stop going!

429
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:04,791
Listen, will the cow fly up?

430
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:09,296
Well, it's her first flight.

431
00:52:15,677 --> 00:52:18,263
Now many people will be removed.

432
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:34,446
Happy flight, dear!

433
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:43,163
I tell you honestly, they've got
a cow in the bomb compartment.

434
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:45,457
Yes.

435
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:54,132
Comrade Colonel, do you think I'm able to
confuse cow's urine with somebody else's.

436
00:52:54,883 --> 00:52:55,968
I'm waiting.

437
00:52:56,844 --> 00:53:01,265
Attention! Tulip's calling. To all
planes. We've got a slight incident.

438
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:05,477
An information received that
some crew has enlisted a cow.

439
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:09,857
- Plane 57, did you get me?
- Here's Fifty-7, I got you.

440
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:13,777
I order to stop transmitting
any information on the air.

441
00:53:14,236 --> 00:53:18,782
Militia, here's calling major Cherdyntsev,
Commandant of the aerodrome.

442
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,078
Plane-57, I order you to come back.
Did you get me?

443
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:29,459
Here's Fifty-7, I got you.
Returning home.

444
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:34,214
You'd have a U-turn in the Western sector.
Approach at 1:15 hours.

445
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,758
Boys, we've got a real mess here.

446
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,595
The Commandant called for militia.
Regiment commander has arrived.

447
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:45,392
Even a man from the special section...
they are looking for this man.
You are expected with the cow.

448
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:51,231
Commander. Commander!

449
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:04,369
- Navigator, drop!
- Yes, sir. Drop.

450
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:07,164
A cutlet.

451
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:12,628
Here's Tulip, what cutlet?
Don't interfere with the air.

452
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:39,363
Go.

453
00:54:43,325 --> 00:54:45,202
Forward! Move, move!

454
00:54:57,089 --> 00:55:00,592
Oh, wolf.

455
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:07,975
What do you do, you mother fuckers,
two... have missed?

456
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:10,561
And how about a hit on your snout?

457
00:55:26,952 --> 00:55:29,621
Bumpkin...

458
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:29,223
Comrade colonel, according to your order
Captain's Kanopkin's crew has stopped the flight.

459
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:35,312
We've returned home. Captain Kanopkin,
Commander of the crew.

460
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:39,399
According to my information, you're taking
an animal in the bomb compartment.

461
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:44,154
What animal? Comrade colonel,
we are taking no animal.

462
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:47,866
For sure they're taking, comrade Colonel.
Surely, I was reporting you. Exactly an animal.

463
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:49,868
Open bomb compartment.

464
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,586
Oh, what I've told you, comrade Colonel,
they're taking it.

465
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:10,013
Yes, if you want to live you
will be bow-legged even worse.

466
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:15,060
Comrade Colonel, what I've told you?
Here's how they utilize military machinery.

467
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:17,229
How did it happen to be here?

468
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:20,482
I'm not in the know. Infiltrated.

469
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:26,196
And may be it's got here on its own?
It was wandering and climbed on.

470
00:57:27,656 --> 00:57:30,701
If it had got here on its own, it would
have taken a parachute at least.

471
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:35,873
The cow-to a slaughter-house, and
the crew-under arrest. Home arrest.

472
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:41,170
- Stop! Hold it!
- Stop! Stop!

473
00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:45,090
- Lieutenant, outflank it from the right!
- Stop, I tell you!

474
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:51,388
- Hold it! - From the right,
I tell you! From the right!

475
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:58,061
Semyonov, how is it?
How's my little cow?

476
00:57:58,437 --> 00:58:00,898
- I thought it belong to the
collective farm. - Well, what?

477
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:04,151
- Which was stolen. And it's yours
that was flying. - It's mine.

478
00:58:04,485 --> 00:58:07,905
- Well, Kouzmich, you'll smear all with
shit. - What are you saying? What shit?

479
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:11,283
- You're under arrest!
- Do you have a pistol?

480
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:15,746
Then you're detained. AII!

481
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:35,933
Come out.

482
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,445
Well, they're drunk!
You devils, devils.

483
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:53,492
- We must go hunting, and you drink!
- Not only drink.

484
00:58:58,497 --> 00:59:01,542
Transporting a cow
by a military plane.

485
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:07,589
Kouzmich, are you serious?
Well this is old wives' tales!

486
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,344
There was nothing at all!

487
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:20,519
Tales or not tales, but the fact
of infringement is on hand.

488
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:30,028
- And we have found your high boots.
- What high boots? Anything to press with?

489
00:59:45,836 --> 00:59:51,717
And you did involve a foreigner
into your dirty ventures.

490
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:57,014
- Cold.
- Well...

491
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:03,896
...this one to justice.

492
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:17,451
Zhenya, it seems to me
that all this has been already.

493
01:00:18,494 --> 01:00:21,580
Dream, reality.

494
01:00:22,456 --> 01:00:26,919
Yes, we live eternally.
Only we forget about this sometimes.

495
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,047
All this has been.

496
01:01:04,665 --> 01:01:09,127
Wait, wait. An important
evidence has been lost. A cow.

497
01:01:10,337 --> 01:01:12,840
Without it the investigation
may reach a deadlock.

498
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:18,428
- And a gun. - And the personal arm,
Makarov system pistol.

499
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:22,766
- Our task...
- Is to find my pistol!

500
01:01:23,142 --> 01:01:26,019
- And...
- And...

501
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:29,898
- My cow.
- And cow!

502
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:35,154
- Zhenya, is this Russian hunting?
- This is a torment.

503
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:39,575
- That's the end. I quit drinking and
smoking. - Zhenya, is it called hunting?

504
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:45,330
- Oh, Lord, if I'd known.
- What? What?

505
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:50,419
- Yes, this is Russian national hunting.
- Kouzmich says there are no beasts here.

506
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:57,634
For our national hunting the most important
thing is the very process, and not beasts.

507
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:02,806
You are wandering and seeking.
You may do nothing but wander.

508
01:02:03,307 --> 01:02:08,187
- Is this possible without vodka?
- Oh, we should like to.

509
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:43,680
- Throw the string-bag!
- The string-bag, throw!

510
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:49,436
- Throw the string-bag!
- The string bag, throw!

511
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:53,649
- Throw the string bag!
- Mikhalych, shoot!

512
01:02:57,236 --> 01:03:01,490
- Climb higher, please.
- Where higher? Well, where higher?

513
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:05,869
Oh, take away the butt-stock.

514
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:09,122
Lord, where are you climbing?
Are there few trees around?

515
01:03:09,498 --> 01:03:11,708
I'm indeed not a hunter,
not a hunter!

516
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:16,672
Oh Lord, why have you grabbed me?
What am I to blame?

517
01:03:19,508 --> 01:03:21,760
Leave me alone, you skunk!
Leave me alone!

518
01:03:22,094 --> 01:03:25,180
- Throw the string-bag. Throw
the string-bag. - Leave me alone!

519
01:03:30,144 --> 01:03:31,979
No, he won't throw it.

520
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:35,357
Aha, with vodka he won't throw it.

521
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:41,488
- Semyonov... sergeant Semyonov,
fire at the beast! - Yes, sir, fire.

522
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:46,160
And fire with what?
We've lost the pistol.

523
01:03:54,168 --> 01:03:58,589
Zhenya, I don't understand
the gist of this hunting.

524
01:03:59,298 --> 01:04:02,968
The gist? The gist...

525
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:10,934
...is to feed and water the beast.
- That's very humanely.

526
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:21,945
Look, it's leaving.

527
01:04:23,447 --> 01:04:26,074
I figure that vodka
is unnecessary here.

528
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:28,911
National tradition.

529
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:37,294
Well, why are you sitting, come down.

530
01:04:37,669 --> 01:04:41,465
We were crying that you should throw
the string-bag. It has sensed vodka
and started chasing you.

531
01:04:41,882 --> 01:04:43,717
So we have dropped it.

532
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:47,888
Why all of it? One bottle could be
enough to kill the hangover.

533
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:37,938
Here's Earth, I'm Semyonov.
The cargo is received, thanks.

534
01:05:38,522 --> 01:05:42,025
- Not at all. Regards to the General.
- I got you.

535
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:05,465
Zhenya, When shall we begin hunting?

536
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:08,677
Now I don't know already.

537
01:06:09,428 --> 01:06:15,225
Black raven, what are you hovering

538
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:23,275
Above my head?

539
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:34,786
You won't get the prey...

540
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,583
And it's not seen from Finland.

541
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:44,463
Black raven, I'm not yours.

542
01:06:46,632 --> 01:06:49,301
Come on, come on!

543
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:54,389
Where, where? Valday,
don't you see the beast?

544
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:58,519
Valday, Valday, have you lost
the tracks? Come to me!

545
01:07:00,229 --> 01:07:02,147
You, come here.

546
01:07:07,611 --> 01:07:10,364
Do you see? Forward. Forward.

547
01:08:18,849 --> 01:08:22,686
"The Emperor's Hunting In Rus"

548
01:09:09,525 --> 01:09:13,445
Here, the idiot's dream
has come true.

549
01:09:23,247 --> 01:09:26,083
Well, now all ducks are ours.

550
01:09:38,136 --> 01:09:41,431
You hear, it's answering?

551
01:09:54,153 --> 01:09:57,489
Come on, quick, come on! Why are you
dragging on? Mikhalych, Mikhalych.

552
01:09:57,823 --> 01:10:01,076
- What scum has shot?
- Michalych, hold on.

553
01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:03,537
- I'll tear off your jaws!
- Lyova, hold on.

554
01:10:03,871 --> 01:10:07,416
- We're drowning, Mikhalych, why don't you
say anything? - Be quick, come on, be quick.

555
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:11,044
- Come on, be quick!
- Let's row. Jump, jump, Mikhalych!

556
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:13,839
- Drag me!
- Come on, come on.

557
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:17,384
I'll kill you!

558
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:20,929
Well, and what scum has shot?

559
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:23,807
So you've been told, we must go to
Gloukhi! And where were you lurching?

560
01:10:24,183 --> 01:10:26,685
And what is this, fucking aboriginal?

561
01:10:27,144 --> 01:10:31,231
And this... is Gloukhi.

562
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:37,112
- Kouzmich, what number
did you shoot, hey? - Five.

563
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:41,200
It was closely grouped fire.
Exactly between us.

564
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,495
- Take off your high boots.
- What for?

565
01:10:44,703 --> 01:10:47,748
Come on, take off your high boots.
Your boots will go for patches.

566
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,501
- Mikhalych.
- Take off, take off.

567
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:56,924
Lyova, why do you cut them into
big pieces? Try from the upper part,
the rubber is thinner there.

568
01:10:57,257 --> 01:11:00,594
Be quiet, all the same they will all be used.
May be even this won't be sufficient.

569
01:11:02,763 --> 01:11:05,808
There's no fish here. No fish.

570
01:11:12,105 --> 01:11:17,653
So, fish together with beasts
are gone to the remote cordon.

571
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:23,992
Well, stretch! Come on.

572
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:28,455
Don't be excited. Come on, lift it.

573
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:34,545
Here it is, here it is, darling!

574
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:44,429
Who's let it go? Yes, I've let it go.
And it lashed me so hard!

575
01:11:44,721 --> 01:11:47,182
Nobody could hold it!

576
01:11:50,644 --> 01:11:54,148
I don't know how to hold it?
I held such species!

577
01:11:57,651 --> 01:12:00,654
Of course, in my excitement
I could hardly jump for it there.

578
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:02,614
- Kouzmich.
- What?

579
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:06,243
- You what, got a good command
of Finnish? - What Finnish?

580
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:12,166
- He speak Finnish after all.
- Who speaks Finnish?

581
01:12:15,836 --> 01:12:17,796
He's a Finn.

582
01:12:18,547 --> 01:12:20,174
Who's a Finn?

583
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:23,969
Me!

584
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:55,417
You've found it all the same.

585
01:12:55,751 --> 01:12:59,588
Kouzmich, he says that we should not give
way to despair. There's hope we'll find it.

586
01:13:00,172 --> 01:13:02,758
- We'll find what?
- My pistol.

587
01:13:03,175 --> 01:13:04,760
Ah, yeah, yeah.

588
01:13:07,054 --> 01:13:10,933
Here, he says that we shouldn't
give way to despair. We'll find.

589
01:13:12,142 --> 01:13:15,437
Well, what? D'you know
what shall we do now?

590
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:21,026
We know. Now you may...

591
01:13:24,196 --> 01:13:30,369
...give way to despair.
No pistol. It's lost.

592
01:13:41,046 --> 01:13:45,926
You'll go to work.
Can you do something?

593
01:13:51,473 --> 01:13:55,811
Well, that's the reason
to give way to despair.

594
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:19,835
And you know what pains me. I held it
in my hands. It was like this. Like this!

595
01:14:20,294 --> 01:14:23,463
It wagged its tail, plumped
into the water and...

596
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:33,056
You teach me?! Teach a learned man?!
I've seen so much fish
what you've never dreamt about!

597
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:37,519
Now I'll take dynamite, bang so loudly
that your eyes will pop out of your head!

598
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:44,109
- Oh, My! And what I grabbed it by?
- Shut up!

599
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:49,865
And you'd better start fighting,
you hot-tempered Finnish boys.

600
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,119
- Well, let's get down to fishing.
- Lyova!

601
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:59,541
Lyova! Skip your fussing about
that boat, come to us.

602
01:15:05,672 --> 01:15:10,010
Lyovka, come on have a seat.

603
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:21,230
You're drinking, aren't you? Drinking
and drinking, and drinking, and drinking.

604
01:15:23,148 --> 01:15:25,025
Swapped everything for drink.

605
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:29,863
Do you think Russia's finished,
don't you?

606
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:34,660
Take this! Take this!

607
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:37,412
Take this!

608
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:42,000
Are you scared of something, aren't you?
Are you looking for a life-saver in it?

609
01:15:43,085 --> 01:15:45,003
What have you found in it?

610
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:54,763
Sheer poison.

611
01:15:57,141 --> 01:16:02,271
You what, Lyova? You've scared me.
No, that happens to me too.

612
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:05,816
You know, sometimes it'll grab me,
hold and doesn't pass away.

613
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:08,485
At this moment you resort to it,
or go to women.

614
01:16:09,862 --> 01:16:13,740
And it's better altogether
at once and in abundance. Yes.

615
01:16:20,706 --> 01:16:23,292
A militia man is born.

616
01:16:35,012 --> 01:16:40,893
The beauty Elle was laundering on the river,
she slipped on a piece of soap and fell.

617
01:16:41,477 --> 01:16:43,937
And the lad Yussy was
speeding on a bicycle.

618
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:48,150
The wheel got into a pit, and Yussy
fell upon the bicycle carriage.

619
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:52,946
Now Elle and Yussy
cannot love each other.

620
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:01,622
Okay... this one to art.

621
01:17:10,964 --> 01:17:14,134
And when I was such a little boy
I would throw away this one.

622
01:17:16,887 --> 01:17:19,348
Moment. Now I'll prove it.

623
01:17:20,224 --> 01:17:21,767
Let's search over there.

624
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:25,854
Now we'll be fishing. Now we'll
fish to such an extent...

625
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:29,525
...that your eyes will pop
out of your head.

626
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:33,737
He will see how our people can fish.

627
01:17:34,321 --> 01:17:37,074
I'll prove to you,
who's a fisherman among us!

628
01:17:37,825 --> 01:17:40,661
Now it'll bang so that all fish
in the river will come to the surface!

629
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:45,290
- All will see how I can fish!
- Dynamite is with him!

630
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:52,589
Stand! Attention!

631
01:17:53,966 --> 01:17:57,719
First thing in the morning, tomorrow
we go hunting. All go to bed.

632
01:18:46,226 --> 01:18:49,062
Oh! Mommy!

633
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:05,996
Mommy!

634
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:09,625
Mommy!

635
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:20,112
Hound pack! Valday!

636
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:31,206
- Zvona, Zvona!
- Commander!

637
01:20:42,676 --> 01:20:44,261
Head, hold its head!

638
01:20:45,804 --> 01:20:47,181
I'm holding.

639
01:20:58,233 --> 01:20:59,902
You've got a good one.

640
01:21:09,286 --> 01:21:13,832
Serv, you've got a good beast.
Good fella.

641
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:18,086
Serduey Kirillovich, little boys saw
a whole brood near the new village.

642
01:21:18,295 --> 01:21:19,880
What shall we do?

643
01:21:20,214 --> 01:21:21,882
- Let's go.
- To the new village!

644
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:41,693
And he stopped recognizing
the people he has known.

645
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:44,279
He started forgetting what
were the days, months and years.

646
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:49,159
He didn't know where he was.
Then trembling of his extremities began,

647
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:54,081
...careful, uncertain walk,
and then subsequent paralyses.

648
01:21:54,832 --> 01:21:58,085
The teenager has become literally
brutalized under the effect of alcohol.

649
01:21:58,627 --> 01:22:01,630
He's got short-tempered,
aggressive and reserved.

650
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:05,884
His behavior revealed estrangement.

651
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:11,598
Remember. Alcohol consumption,
especially in prime years,

652
01:22:12,182 --> 01:22:16,478
...when a personality is being formed, is
not only undesirable, but also intolerable.

653
01:22:20,107 --> 01:22:21,483
Understand?

654
01:22:23,694 --> 01:22:26,530
Well, will you drink?

655
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:31,869
No, no, no. And once again...

656
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:36,039
...yes.

657
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:43,046
We must go to the aerodrome.
We should comb the whole forest.

658
01:22:43,505 --> 01:22:46,800
So, I haven't got it. Are we to go
hunting or to look for your cow?

659
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:50,512
- Hunting.
- Okay, let's go to the cape as agreed.

660
01:22:52,014 --> 01:22:54,850
- And have you got a license?
- Of course... no.

661
01:22:58,437 --> 01:23:02,399
- Oh, you've found!
- I did told you that Lyova would find it.

662
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:07,321
- Semyonov, do you understand
what you owe us? - You don't ask.

663
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:10,407
Well, Lyova, you're a real sleuth!

664
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:15,245
What does it mean they don't fly?
I've got a general here. General.

665
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:17,664
- Good, let's fly.
- Come on, I'm waiting.

666
01:23:18,457 --> 01:23:21,960
Now we'll know everything.
They send here a helicopter.

667
01:23:22,586 --> 01:23:25,255
No good, from a helicopter,
tank-it's not the sporting way.

668
01:23:27,966 --> 01:23:31,011
Semyonov, we've seen wild boars
at the distant swamp.

669
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:36,517
- Listen, my General is an old man, it's
hard to walk for him. - I've got you.

670
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:40,395
Look in the vicinity.
No need to go far.

671
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:44,316
And will you take me to hunting?

672
01:23:51,365 --> 01:23:54,451
Semyonov, we see elks at the cape,
near the weir.

673
01:23:58,997 --> 01:24:01,208
- How many there?
- Two.

674
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:06,713
- Two elks at the cape!
- And is my cow there?

675
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:09,299
No.

676
01:25:14,323 --> 01:25:15,616
Rayvo!

677
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:27,169
Come on, move! What are you dawdling
there? How long should we wait for you?

678
01:25:37,554 --> 01:25:41,058
- Where should you be?
- And where should I be?

679
01:25:41,391 --> 01:25:44,645
- At your number!
- Oh, Lord! I'll be at my number for sure.

680
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,648
Is it possible to sit for a minute,
have a lunch, isn't it?

681
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:51,068
Well, why are you standing? Let's go!
You, two-bit of hunters.

682
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:56,365
Kouzmich, Kouzmich.

683
01:26:01,411 --> 01:26:02,871
They're bypassing.

684
01:26:03,205 --> 01:26:06,792
There're stones there. Stones. There're
narrow valley there. Narrow valley, you see?

685
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:10,504
Stand there. The beast isn't a fool, it
won't go in your direction, and you... it.

686
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:13,590
No, no, you'll thank me later on.

687
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:40,576
Mikhalych, take the launches here,
we leave!

688
01:26:42,119 --> 01:26:47,082
That's finish, we've missed the beast.
It 's gone through the channel.

689
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:50,127
The beast has gone
through the channel.

690
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:51,753
Yes, there.

691
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:54,673
Yes, let's get over.

692
01:26:56,008 --> 01:27:00,262
- Zhenya, we what, hunting apes?
- There're no apes in Russia.

693
01:27:00,637 --> 01:27:04,433
I've seen a huge ape. Ape!

694
01:27:05,392 --> 01:27:09,980
Well? What shall we do,
shall we return and catch it?

695
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:14,651
- I don't know.
- Well, then let's go hunting elks.

696
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,364
Kouzmich, Rayvo says
that he saw some ape.

697
01:27:19,573 --> 01:27:21,950
What do you have here, a snowman
inhabiting these parts?

698
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:26,079
What ape? What snowman? Beasts
are leaving, elks too! All aboard!

699
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:31,168
Again, Semyonov is wandering somewhere,
dirty cop. Semyonov!

700
01:27:32,628 --> 01:27:35,631
While you fancy some apes,
the elk will go away.

701
01:27:40,552 --> 01:27:43,639
You are exaggerating. They don't
produce such high boots here.

702
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:45,724
Here's the biggest one.

703
01:27:50,729 --> 01:27:52,981
You think hard when you cast bullets.

704
01:27:53,315 --> 01:27:56,568
Now it's cold. Who will let out
a naked person outside?

705
01:27:57,069 --> 01:27:59,029
Semyonov!

706
01:27:59,863 --> 01:28:02,574
Well, what are you sitting
here? Kouzmich!

707
01:28:03,116 --> 01:28:05,786
The beast is over there, in the depression.
It dashed so quickly through the forest!

708
01:28:05,994 --> 01:28:07,538
Antlers like this!

709
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:38,610
Aim lower, comrade General! Lower!

710
01:28:43,866 --> 01:28:46,243
Don't let it escape to the fir-grove!

711
01:28:59,882 --> 01:29:01,216
I've hit it!

712
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:05,888
Well, have you tumbled it?

713
01:29:07,514 --> 01:29:10,601
Well, have you seen how I laid it?
Right in the head, bang!

714
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:13,687
Of course, you don't say so. I've shot it
point-blank. So that's me who tumbled it.

715
01:29:13,979 --> 01:29:18,525
Come, don't dispute. Most important we've
got it. Though my shot was the last one.

716
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:22,446
After all my shot was the last one.

717
01:29:22,779 --> 01:29:25,157
Why to be busy in guess-work?
Now we'll descend and see.

718
01:29:25,491 --> 01:29:27,409
Well, eagles, we've laid the beast.

719
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:29,953
What are you saying?
My bullet's got it. My bullet.

720
01:29:30,162 --> 01:29:34,416
And I said to him, comrade General, aim
lower. He-bang! And missed. Bang! Missed.

721
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:37,753
- I started shooting afterwards.
- Imagine. You think Mikhalych could miss?

722
01:29:38,045 --> 01:29:42,633
And I'm not surprised at that. By the way,
I've been paying heed to that for long:
He doesn't kill beasts.

723
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:46,470
Doesn't kill beasts. In fact he shoots,
he shoots, but just aimlessly.

724
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:49,723
- Well, whose shot was the last one?
- Mine. Mine, mine!

725
01:29:50,098 --> 01:29:52,434
- My shot!
- Mine! Mine, mine!

726
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:00,359
No, in general, it was me
who shot first.

727
01:30:01,276 --> 01:30:03,487
Well, then I was reloading.

728
01:30:06,365 --> 01:30:07,908
Do you have vodka?

729
01:30:13,956 --> 01:30:17,584
Kouzmich, you've submitted
to its loss, aren't you?

730
01:30:19,753 --> 01:30:22,172
All right, I see.

731
01:30:22,798 --> 01:30:26,677
That's fate. It flew by plane...

732
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:32,266
So many times it was on the verge
of death, and here you are.

733
01:30:32,766 --> 01:30:35,144
- And what shall we do with it?
- Bury.

734
01:30:35,394 --> 01:30:38,438
Now we'll drag it out and bury.

735
01:30:38,814 --> 01:30:42,317
How? Here's about 300 kilos.

736
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:46,613
322.

737
01:30:47,573 --> 01:30:50,617
We'll cut it into pieces,
take the best, and bury the bones.

738
01:30:51,076 --> 01:30:52,619
You...

739
01:30:58,876 --> 01:31:00,127
As you wish.

740
01:31:02,296 --> 01:31:05,257
- Well, get cutting.
- No, I don't know.

741
01:31:05,674 --> 01:31:08,343
- You? - I don't. I'm a vegetarian,
and, it's always disgusting.

742
01:31:08,927 --> 01:31:13,307
Aha, it's disgusting to him!
It's silly to throw away the meat.

743
01:31:24,067 --> 01:31:25,319
Fastidious jacks.

744
01:31:28,906 --> 01:31:30,616
We take only sirloin.

745
01:31:33,327 --> 01:31:35,496
You only tell where's that sirloin?

746
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:44,171
What shall we begin with, Lyova?
First cut out horns.

747
01:31:45,214 --> 01:31:47,424
Ah, of course.

748
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:55,307
I see you're kidding, hey? You think
that gives me the pleasure.

749
01:31:56,225 --> 01:32:00,604
Simply somebody should begin it.
It's unwise to leave it here.

750
01:32:03,565 --> 01:32:05,025
God almighty!

751
01:32:10,072 --> 01:32:11,448
Oh, my God!

752
01:32:13,951 --> 01:32:16,662
Lyova, it's alive.

753
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:21,250
I began it like this, with the knife.
And its side... like this, and leg.

754
01:32:22,376 --> 01:32:25,712
These are reflexes. Go on cutting.

755
01:32:27,172 --> 01:32:28,632
Reflexes.

756
01:32:30,843 --> 01:32:32,553
Where are you going? Catch it!

757
01:32:33,428 --> 01:32:36,014
You jump on your heels,
it'll pass away at once.

758
01:32:36,515 --> 01:32:40,936
- Don't shoot! We'll take it alive!
- Stop, I tell you, stop, or I'll shoot!

759
01:32:50,571 --> 01:32:53,365
I guess myself that
it's not a fracture.

760
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:58,871
There's nothing to be
fractured there. Pah!

761
01:33:05,252 --> 01:33:10,382
Kouzmich is shooting. Decided
to finish off the livestock.

762
01:33:22,769 --> 01:33:24,229
Well, what's there?

763
01:33:24,605 --> 01:33:28,400
Ah, it's become quite wild, it doesn't let
itself to be caught. That's all right,
we'll take it afterwards.

764
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:43,707
- Oh, this pistol isn't mine.
- Have you had a good rest?

765
01:33:44,082 --> 01:33:49,713
Mine has number 17-76, the year of signing
of the USA Declaration of Independence.

766
01:33:50,088 --> 01:33:52,341
I remember it very well.
And this isn't mine.

767
01:33:52,925 --> 01:33:58,013
And here's, comrade General, number 18-37.
The year of the death of Pushkin
Alexander Sergueyevich.

768
01:34:00,808 --> 01:34:03,060
Those with hound dogs,
don't fall behind!

769
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:06,396
Don't fall behind!

770
01:34:25,707 --> 01:34:28,502
It was a good hunting.

771
01:34:30,712 --> 01:34:34,842
Normal. Quite normal.

772
01:36:30,082 --> 01:36:36,672
The end
