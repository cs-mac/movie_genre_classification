00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:19,396
<i>Hi. I'm Doug Stauber.</i>

2
00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:21,766
<i>I'm an assistant manager
at Donaldson's Grocery...</i>

3
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:24,738
<i>where customers come first-
even customers who are nuts.</i>

4
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:28,072
- Mr. Stauber.
- Can I help you?

5
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:32,171
<i>This guy had some complaint
about the cracker Teddy Grahams...</i>

6
00:00:32,248 --> 00:00:34,182
<i>a honey graham snack.</i>

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>- Okay.
- He spoke some other kind of language.</i>

8
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:39,685
<i>"Lerhman torsh. "</i>

9
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:44,255
That's not Spanish, bro.
I don't know what that is.

10
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:53,364
Okay, "Lerhman. "
Let's go. Sorry.

11
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:01,742
Oh, no.

12
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,641
Lerhman, man,
I don't know, Lerhman. I don't-

13
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:06,681
<i>- Holy shit!
- At Donaldson's...</i>

14
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:09,877
<i>the assistant manager
deals with customer complaints.</i>

15
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:14,088
<i>What the hell?</i>

16
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:16,624
<i>It's my job to keep a lid on this place.</i>

17
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:20,492
<i>It's kind of hard.
I mean, it's not like I have a crack staff.</i>

18
00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:27,759
<i>Outside, we have a gang problem. And we
have two 14-year-old security guards...</i>

19
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:31,636
<i>who stand as far away from the store
as they possibly can.</i>

20
00:01:31,707 --> 00:01:34,574
<i>And at the end of the day,
I get reviews from customers...</i>

21
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:36,736
<i>whose feedback is important to us.</i>

22
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:39,804
<i>I returned to the lot from the
grocery and found three black guys...</i>

23
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:42,009
<i>sitting on my car eating snacks.</i>

24
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:45,986
<i>They finally left, but called me
names and words like "tasty"...</i>

25
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:48,683
<i>and "lick"and "titties. "</i>

26
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:52,523
<i>I have to turn these cards
over to our actual manager...</i>

27
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:55,359
<i>who's usually on his way back
from a movie.</i>

28
00:01:55,431 --> 00:01:57,160
- What's up?
- Hey.

29
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:59,064
- New cards?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:01,125
Good ones?

31
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:06,801
That's good.
"Lick. " "Titties. "

32
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,207
I'm gonna take off.

33
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:12,475
<i>So my job has challenges.</i>

34
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:14,539
<i>So I'm not smiling here
because I'm actually happy.</i>

35
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:16,551
<i>I'm smiling because
I'm pretty sure my manager-</i>

36
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:19,144
<i>who probably is actually happy-
expected me to...</i>

37
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:21,655
<i>and I want to advance
and have a good career.</i>

38
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,056
I'm supporting the orbital bone
with my right hand...

39
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:26,754
and the other hand
is right in her chest cavity, you know?

40
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:30,390
I'm manually massaging her heart now.
I thought she was going to die.

41
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:33,162
- How'd you get her back?
- Instinct.

42
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:36,830
- Hey, Jen.
- Hey, Doug. You remember Mark Timms.

43
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,338
<i>- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.</i>

44
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:42,309
We were just talking about how Mark
saved a two-year-old girl's life.

45
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:44,312
Good job.

46
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,110
- Oh. Tell Mark about "Teddy Grahams. "
- That's all right.

47
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:48,672
<i>- It's hilarious.
- What?</i>

48
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,914
- This Teddy Grahams "snack slap" thing.
- Oh, snack slap?

49
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:54,717
- He got in this little slap fight.
- What happened? Tell me.

50
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,758
- Tell him.
- That's ok- No.

51
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:59,919
No, come on, man.
I want to know. Come on, guy.

52
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:03,487
<i>And I'm asked to share my graham cracker
slap stories with my wife's boss...</i>

53
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:06,625
<i>- who never remembers my name.
- All right.</i>

54
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:09,364
<i>And my name's on my shirt. Right side.</i>

55
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:13,534
<i>Just the first name though. I tried to put
"Mr. Stauber" on it, but I got reprimanded.</i>

56
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:19,141
Big deal. He saved an infant.
That's great.

57
00:03:19,214 --> 00:03:21,842
- If I had infant-saving training,
I could probably do it. - Okay.

58
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:26,513
<i>Some days, I didn't think
anyone would call me "mister. "</i>

59
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:30,388
<i>I'd just be "Doug"... for good.</i>

60
00:03:52,114 --> 00:03:53,877
You're a shoo-in, dude.

61
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:56,383
<i>- Seriously?
- Seriously.</i>

62
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:59,751
Hey, do you know where the expression
"shoo-in" comes from?

63
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,915
No.

64
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,118
<i>The Romans used to-</i>

65
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:09,161
I'm the shoo-in- the leading shoo-in.
Totally.

66
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:11,324
<i>- Oh, you're the leading shoo-in.
- Yeah, totally.</i>

67
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,267
Come here, you sweaty bastard.
You sweaty shoo-in.

68
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:17,396
- I'm really sweaty.
- I don't care. Come here.

69
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:20,169
Oh, Jesus! You stink.

70
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:23,234
- I'll take a shower.
- It's okay.

71
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:40,958
<i>- Hey, guy, can you just give us a break?
One night?</i>

72
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,224
<i>My partner's coming over.</i>

73
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:46,665
<i>- I'm supposed to have this piece prepared.
- Man, we're trying to...</i>

74
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:48,999
have dinner.

75
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,301
<i>I thought you were makin' out. "All sweaty. "</i>

76
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:56,100
<i>Compromise. I'll do scales.</i>

77
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,849
- Is it still for sale?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,979
<i>We should go get that house. This week.</i>

79
00:05:07,055 --> 00:05:09,853
Because I'm gonna get that job,
and I feel really good about things.

80
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:13,554
Me too.
Maybe we should wait though.

81
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:18,692
I'm a shoo-in. And someone's
gonna snag that house. Let's do it.

82
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,531
- Shoo-in?
- Yeah.

83
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:25,232
All right. Let's do it.

84
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:28,674
<i>It was right there, what we worked for.</i>

85
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:31,947
<i>Then this guy
comes down from Canada.</i>

86
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:35,742
<i>#Every day I'm gonna strut that stuff #</i>

87
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:38,810
<i># When the music's loud
I can't get enough #</i>

88
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:41,856
<i>#Singin' hi, singin' hi #</i>

89
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,825
<i># Come on, feet

90
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:46,884

<i># Unhappy faces

93
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:58,129
<i>#Singin' hi, singin' hi #</i>

94
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:01,176
<i># Come on, people

95
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:04,178

00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:08,874
<i>#Hey, all right #</i>

00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:37,801
<i>#Spread the news

98
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,610
<i>#Let it go

99
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:43,446
<i>#Singin' hi, singin' hi #</i>

100
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,250
<i># Come on, feet
We was born to move #</i>

101
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:50,052
<i>- #Hey, yeah ##
Got the loading dock right over there.</i>

102
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,218
<i>- That's for blue stock only.
- Okay.</i>

103
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:54,762
<i>- That gets logged in right away.
- Blue stock.</i>

104
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,924
And if it's before 8:15 in the morning,
you've got to do it.

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,264
- Move it over right up there to that first pallet.
- Right.

106
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:03,668
This way, as soon as it goes back,
it's rotated back to the first-

107
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:11,574
<i>We just moved.
My wife was transferred, so now I'm here.</i>

108
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:15,083
Richard Wehlner, from Quebec.

109
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,141
<i>And that's pretty much where it all started-</i>

110
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:19,813
<i>some joker blowing down
from Canada...</i>

111
00:07:19,888 --> 00:07:22,857
<i>from a sister company
I didn't even know we had.</i>

112
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,761
Nice location.

113
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:41,708
Yeah.

114
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,938
<i>- It's a Plus?
- What's that?</i>

115
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:46,879
<i>- It's gonna be full size?
- Full size.</i>

116
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:50,248
This place will draw too.
There's not another grocery till Western.

117
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,288
I'm gonna put in for it,
full manager.

118
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:55,550
Yeah, me too.

119
00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:03,120
- So, okay. See you later.
- Yep. See you later.

120
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,292
Eh, gimme five.

121
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:23,710
<i>Erickson's is our sister company.</i>

122
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:25,685
Okay.

123
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:29,246
Yeah, they're all over Canada.
Wehlner's got, like, six years in up there.

124
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:31,258
But I'm still the shoo-in, right?

125
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:35,126
I don't know.
Wehlner's kind of a wild card.

126
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:38,291
His work history transfers clean, so-

127
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:41,700
I don't know about
this shoo-in business.

128
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,228
So there's a microchip on the right
anterior wheel that has a sensor in it...

129
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:49,038
<i>and if it detects an obstacle,
it will engage the self-braking mechanism.</i>

130
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,376
<i>So no more scratched
door small claims, right?</i>

131
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,438
All right, here we go.

132
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,425
<i>I had to tell her I wasn't a shoo-in...</i>

133
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:08,019
<i>- and that maybe the house was out for now.
- Whoa!</i>

134
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:10,030
<i>That's no way to play the banjo.</i>

135
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:12,896
<i>- I'm doing the best I can.
- No, you're not. Because you don't love me.</i>

136
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:15,368
<i>- I love you intensely.
- Then show me...</i>

137
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:17,962
<i>- by playing better banjo.
- Okay.</i>

138
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,009
<i>Then show me... sexually.</i>

139
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:23,169
Dream or real?

140
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:27,738
- Real.
- Oh, my God.

141
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:29,750
<i>Chapter Two.</i>

142
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:32,286
<i>We'll learn the importance
of recognizing opportunities...</i>

143
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:35,949
<i>to stand out at work
and to steer clear of trouble.</i>

144
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:38,822

- Well, what's so f'ing nuts about it?

153
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:16,092
- It's just crazy. Lot detail means bad cards.
- Oh.

with a couple of other guys as a formality.

268

They don't stand a chance really.

Not with you in this suit,
they don't.

270

- Is that guy still standing on his balcony staring at us?
- Yeah.

271

That's nice.

00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,704
- Richard Wehlner-
- #Till I'm free ##

295
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:38,357
Our grocery-
We have Martin's projects right there.

296
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:41,259
And we're trying to draw
from pretty high-end neighborhoods.

297
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:46,460
We get a lot of cut-throughs, but, uh, keeping
the lot safe is our number one obstacle.

298
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:49,094
And I don't shy away
from the lot. It's critical.

299
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,628
<i>That's good. It's critical
at the Augusta Plus store too.</i>

300
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:54,834
We have public housing right there.

301
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:59,437
Yeah, it's a balancing act. You need safety,
but you also need good community relations.

302
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:01,914
I'm glad you mentioned
community relations.

303
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:06,716
The housing- those are our neighbors,
our customers too.

304
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,450
It's important to get along.

305
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:13,619
Doug, what's this?

306
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:18,862
<i>- I grabbed this on the 19th.
- That's out of line.</i>

307
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,764
Yeah.

308
00:20:20,835 --> 00:20:26,535
- When did you get that?
- June 19th, at your deli, on the refrigeration unit.

309
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:31,772
<i>- I think this is B.S.
- It is B.S.</i>

310
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:35,111
I was probably on lot that day.
I like it out there.

311
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:37,743
Who was inside?

312
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:43,052
Maybe... Richard?

313
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:49,425
- Richard Wehlner.
- Yeah. Mmm.

314
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:53,558
I think so. Yep.

315
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:57,798
<i>You think he was on Deli,
or he was on Deli?</i>

316
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:01,441
Was on Deli.

317
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:05,912
Send him in.

318
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:13,818
<i>Doug, these aren't great.</i>

319
00:21:13,888 --> 00:21:18,985
Bear down. We'll get some fresh cards.
We'll take it from there.

320
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,153
I like what you're saying.

321
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:24,289
I need to like what you're doing
a little more.

322
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:26,299
Thank you.

323
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:33,168
- How'd it go?
- Good.

324
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:39,311
<i>Hello, gentlemen.</i>

325
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,213
<i>I'm Richard Wehlner.
Thank you for your valuable time.</i>

326
00:21:42,283 --> 00:21:44,581
Nice to meet you, sir.
Richard Wehlner.

327
00:21:44,652 --> 00:21:48,213
Hi. How do you do?
Thank you for your valuable time.

328
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:03,359
In Canada, we don't say-

329
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:12,745
"Cutting the cheese" simply means
cutting the actual cheese.

330
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:16,978
It doesn't have a double thing,
so I just missed it.

331
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,221
Because in Canada, it's "cracking. "

332
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:27,660
- The expression.
- It's "cracking" in Canada. Yeah.

333
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:31,220
We "crack the cheese. "

334
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:43,266
"Cracking it"?

335
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:49,550
"Cracking the cheese"?

336
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:53,779
So I simply really believed
that Rogelio...

337
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:56,449
had been given
an intra-Deli award...

338
00:22:56,524 --> 00:22:58,924
for cutting the actual cheese.

339
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:01,188
I'm sorry.

340
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:21,040
I simply believed Rogelio
had been given an intra-Deli-

341
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:25,074
I heard you the first time.
Listen. We have permit delays.

342
00:23:25,152 --> 00:23:29,088
We're on hold this month.
We won't be deciding for a few weeks.

343
00:23:29,156 --> 00:23:31,818
Make up the ground.

344
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:34,157
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

345
00:23:34,228 --> 00:23:36,093
Then that's all.

346
00:23:36,163 --> 00:23:38,461
Well, thank you for gimme-

347
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:42,435
for giving me your valuable time.

348
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:50,571
Thank you for your time. I appreciate it.
Thank you, sir, for your time.

349
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:52,909
Thank you for this- for this moment.

350
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,416
Thank you very much, Mr. Cranston.
Appreciate it.

351
00:23:56,484 --> 00:24:00,614
Thank you very much, sir, for your time
today. You are a valuable person to me.

352
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:04,317
And I am sorry
about this cutting business.

353
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:06,326
That's the end of that.

354
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:08,919
No more cheese business.

355
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:16,035
<i>Last stop, financial district.</i>

356
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:25,544
<i>So I never got to go over my cool
bullet points because of the fart gag joke.</i>

357
00:24:25,613 --> 00:24:28,480
The whole board saw it.
It was uncool.

358
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:30,949
Why don't you
forget about it for now?

359
00:24:31,018 --> 00:24:34,454
I want you to blow off some steam.
I have an idea.

360
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:37,514
I signed us up for dance lessons.

361
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:39,992
- Oh, I don't know.
- Let's go for it.

362
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,656
- Let's do salsa. It's so beautiful.
- Not when I do it.

363
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,791
It's gonna be,
because you're a beautiful guy.

364
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:55,072
I don't know if I can do it.
Here, sweetie. Ready?

365
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:00,805
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna backslide.

366
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:06,151
All right. Let's go dancin'.

367
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,087
Ready? Whoo!

368
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:27,865
- How many pages is that?
- Eight pages.

369
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:34,607
It's so quiet.

370
00:26:01,676 --> 00:26:05,908
Okay. Now we just need that $12,000 check-
the earnest money check.

371
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,076
If I can't make the big 10% down payment
in August, I can get this back, right?

372
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:15,487
Like, uh, if I don't get this job
that I thought I was gonna get?

373
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:19,925
Um, you forfeit that.
It will be a forfeiture in that amount.

374
00:26:19,994 --> 00:26:22,121
- Is that bad?
- Yes.

375
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:26,428
"Forfeit," as in, you don't
get the money back.

376
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,594
The seller keeps the money.
It's so they're not hung out to dry...

377
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,298
and it's also a way
of preventing schmucks...

378
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:34,398
from trying to purchase
houses they can't afford.

379
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:36,670
Yeah. Schmucks.

380
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:39,508
- What are you talking about?
- Schmucks who buy houses they can't afford.

381
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,140
- Are there really schmucks like that?
- Well, every once in a while...

382
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:44,343
we'll encounter a schmuck like that-
not often.

383
00:26:48,155 --> 00:26:50,851
<i>- Hey! Man, what the hell?
- Ah!</i>

384
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:54,588
Holy shit.

385
00:26:54,662 --> 00:26:57,290
- That was "Teddy"?
- Yeah.

386
00:26:57,364 --> 00:27:00,663
- He's smaller than I imagined.
- Yeah, well, he's got a lot of stamina.

387
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:06,906
<i>It took us five years to save $ 12,000...</i>

388
00:27:06,974 --> 00:27:09,204
<i>and I might have
just schmucked it away.</i>

389
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:11,744
<i>So Richard might be
a nice recovering drug guy...</i>

390
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:15,509
<i>but if I could slide ahead of him at the
company retreat, I was going to do it.</i>

391
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:20,145
Hey, leaders in quality foods,
the Donaldson's difference- it's people.

392
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,987
<i>And all of you-
here's the great news- are people.</i>

393
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:27,391
<i>Now concentration allows you
to shut out distraction.</i>

394
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:30,453
Shutting out distraction, gang,
allows you...

395
00:27:30,531 --> 00:27:34,661
to accomplish your goals
and achieve new heights!

396
00:27:38,572 --> 00:27:41,006
Get it in here, Chicagoland Donaldson's.
Come on.

397
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:44,044
<i>Tout de suite it in here, make a stack
of hands. Right here in the middle.</i>

398
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:46,477
<i>Let's go.
Bunch of hands, here we go. Ready?</i>

399
00:27:46,547 --> 00:27:50,244
Now let's make it happen on "one. "
Ready on "one"? One!

400
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:54,083
Let's make it happen!

401
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:59,153
<i>Here we go. Let's go.
You can do this, Mitch. Concentration.</i>

402
00:27:59,226 --> 00:28:01,592
And... block out distraction. Easy.

403
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:04,825
Here we go, Aaron.
That's it. That's it. That's it!

404
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:07,629
Doug, you can do it.
Block out distraction.

405
00:28:07,701 --> 00:28:10,499
Block out distraction.
Very good.

406
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:15,031
<i>What do you think, Richard?
Here we go. And-</i>

407
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:18,601
It's not hot! It's not hot!

408
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:22,046
You've essentially attained your goal.
Blockin' out distractions!

409
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:24,050
Who's next?
Who's next?

410
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:26,678
Let's do it, Steve. You've got it.
You've got it. You've got it!

411
00:28:26,754 --> 00:28:30,986
This guy's done this before, right?
You did this before on some weird island?

412
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:33,492
Here we go.
Hey, burgundy jumpsuit!

413
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:36,553
<i>Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.</i>

414
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:44,031
Scott, you just concentrate,
concentrate, concentrate.

415
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:50,601
He didn't block out the distractions.

416
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,771
<i>- Just get in the pool. You can try it again.
- Stop!</i>

417
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:57,079
That's all right.
This is why we sign waivers, everybody.

418
00:28:57,151 --> 00:29:00,951
All right. Put the bags
on over your head. Everyone.

419
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:04,718
Right over the top.
Perfect. Okay.

420
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:10,628
Now, I want you to take off one thing
that you don't need... quickly! Come on!

421
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:25,572
Let's take something else off
that you really don't need... right away!

422
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:34,120
<i>Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Something else you
don't need. Let's make it happen. Come on!</i>

423
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:38,420
<i>- Something else you don't need.
Come on. Let's go.</i>

424
00:29:38,492 --> 00:29:41,120
<i>Something completely unnecessary.</i>

425
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:46,659
Doug, can we take our sack off?

426
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:48,759
What?

427
00:29:48,836 --> 00:29:52,272
- Did you take your sack off?
- I can't really hear you.

428
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:57,038
People, take off one more thing that you
simply do... not... need.

429
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:01,344
- Do it.
- Fuck.

430
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:15,695
<i>Okay, um-</i>

431
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:21,561
All right, everybody that still has a bag
on top of their heads, scream...

432
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:24,798
"My concentration skills
need improvement. "

433
00:30:24,872 --> 00:30:28,672
<i>- One, two, three.
- My concentration skills need improvement!</i>

434
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:33,880
<i>Easy with the laughter.</i>

435
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:35,939
Easy with that.

436
00:30:40,554 --> 00:30:44,183
<i>That's enough. All right.</i>

437
00:30:44,258 --> 00:30:46,886
<i>- Who's up for some team building, huh?
Let's do it!</i>

438
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:49,794
<i>Let's head over
to the productivity obstacle course.</i>

439
00:30:49,863 --> 00:30:51,797
Guy, slap the clothes back on.

440
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:54,663
Let's just watch the assumptions.
That's all it is.

441
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,268
Yeah, is this Chicagoland Pepsi?

442
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,774
Connect to Kevin Conoway, please?

443
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:04,810
Richard Wehlner.

444
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:11,208
<i>Brighten the week with a
sweet from Donaldson's...</i>

445
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:13,776
<i>the champion of excellence.</i>

446
00:31:40,614 --> 00:31:43,674
Scott, lot the full week?

447
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:48,950
Pepsi's sending a new season of stuff.
Yep. Kevin wants Richard.

448
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:53,926
- PepsiCo's chips and paperware-
- That's six days of bad cards from the lot.

449
00:31:53,994 --> 00:31:55,985
I got two weeks before the board
decides about Augusta.

450
00:31:56,063 --> 00:31:59,464
That's one week of suck cards.
Come on, Fargas.

451
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:02,127
- What, are you callin' me by my last name now?
- Scott.

452
00:32:02,202 --> 00:32:06,366
Kevin wants Richard. That's Pepsi.
Don't make a stink about it.

453
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,104
You know what? I'm takin' lot. Give it
to me. They got lot concerns at Augusta.

454
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:14,170
I'm gonna get some prime lot cards.
I'm gonna show 'em I can do it.

455
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:16,239
- Awesome.
- I'm gonna jam for six days.

456
00:32:16,316 --> 00:32:18,250
Awesome.

457
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:21,378
Let's make it happen!

458
00:32:28,695 --> 00:32:32,426
Hey, remove yourself! Get your pizza
off there. Get your butt off my car!

459
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:35,525
<i>Fuck you, Mr. Chopsticks.
You Chungking fuck ass.</i>

460
00:32:35,602 --> 00:32:39,834
<i>Hey, show some respect! Where is someone?
Can someone please help me?</i>

461
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:47,003
That's addressed to the board,
for the cards.

462
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:49,572
They want the fresh ones.

463
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:57,050
<i>Gordon "Jiminy. " A kid hanging
out in your lot kidney punched me...</i>

464
00:32:57,124 --> 00:33:01,322
<i>because I offended him,
I guess, by doing nothing.</i>

465
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:03,590
<i>Kidney punched me.</i>

466
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:06,462
<i>There's a little bit
of a lack of security in your lot...</i>

467
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:09,764
<i>'cause your security guy
was sleeping in my car.</i>

468
00:34:08,695 --> 00:34:11,994
Okay. The, uh-
The fucking chip is fixed...

469
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:15,728
and, uh, here we go-
right towards my own private vehicle...

470
00:34:15,802 --> 00:34:18,362
<i>because that's how much confiidence
I have in this.</i>

471
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:20,463
Remember, this could be
your daughter.

472
00:34:24,044 --> 00:34:25,978
Fuck!

473
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:29,743
...as I offer you
a blueprint for success in the workplace.

474
00:34:29,816 --> 00:34:34,150
And, like the eagle, you'll create
a commanding atmosphere around-

475
00:34:34,221 --> 00:34:36,155
Richard Wehlner.

476
00:34:36,223 --> 00:34:39,090
<i>If you ever have to choose between
working inside and outside...</i>

477
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,651
<i>at a major American grocery store,
choose inside.</i>

478
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:47,063
<i>Inside you have some freedom.
You have places to hide.</i>

479
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:54,301
<i>You can catch a breeze off the dairy cooler.
The girls work inside.</i>

480
00:34:59,246 --> 00:35:00,338
Mmm.

481
00:35:00,414 --> 00:35:02,644
<i>Outside sucks.</i>

482
00:35:02,716 --> 00:35:06,015
<i>I just wanted to let you know
that everything was top-notch.</i>

483
00:35:06,086 --> 00:35:08,281
Yes.

484
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:10,687
<i>You guys are really
getting your shit together.</i>

485
00:35:10,757 --> 00:35:15,854
<i>I fuckin' had it for a while there,
but I've sensed a shift. Hey, good shift.</i>

486
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:18,864
<i>Keep on truckin' in that direction.</i>

487
00:35:18,932 --> 00:35:20,866
<i>I'll be a repeat customer.</i>

488
00:35:25,138 --> 00:35:28,596
...cuttin' grass and shit?

489
00:35:28,675 --> 00:35:32,270
I can call the police. So, just so you know,
this is Donaldson's property. You're trespassing.

490
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:34,337
- I'm on a parkin' lot.
- It's our lot.

491
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:38,180
<i>- Fuck you.
- Heh, your ma's courteous. She took my ride, sissy.</i>

492
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:42,018
What does that mean?
Hey! Well, give 'em back!

493
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:44,649
Fuckin' get 'em.

494
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,818
Fuck!

495
00:35:51,431 --> 00:35:53,365
Fuck!

496
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:56,027
Fuck you, man, you know?
Back up.

497
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:58,503
- Back what?
- Back up. I'm not fuckin' around, dick.

498
00:35:58,572 --> 00:36:01,040
What you call me, motherfucker?

499
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:04,373
Get off the lot! Get off me!

500
00:36:04,444 --> 00:36:07,504
- Is he serious?
- Hey, he can't be fuckin' serious.

501
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:10,141
- Have a nice day!
- Have a nice day!

502
00:36:10,217 --> 00:36:14,677
<i>You have a nice day, fuckin' assholes!</i>

503
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:22,361
Aren't you on lot?

504
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:24,920
I'm tryin' to fix these cards.
They got messed up.

505
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:27,023
Don't forget, those go in today.

506
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,864
Half hour, I'm gonna go down there.

507
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:33,201
- Who's on lot?
- Just Bredon. Keith's sick.

508
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:36,606
<i>Ah, put Octavio out.
He can come off Deli.</i>

509
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:38,611
We got it covered.
You have the vest?

510
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:41,409
In my locker.

511
00:36:41,481 --> 00:36:43,779
- Thanks, Scott.
- All right.

512
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:56,518
I don't know what you say.

513
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:04,559
<i>I was trying to figure out
if Brian... "Grall's"card...</i>

514
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:09,098
<i>said, "Your employees were very...
courageous"?</i>

515
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:15,270
<i>I wondered,
were any of them courageous?</i>

516
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:18,910
<i>Esteban? No.
Little Esteban? No.</i>

517
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:28,722
<i>- Hey.
- Then I thought, fuck.</i>

518
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:33,391
<i>I found a whole stack
of D.E. 's in your locker.</i>

519
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:38,360
- Stauber.
- Yeah.

520
00:37:38,438 --> 00:37:40,929
A whole stack.

521
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:45,068
Scott, man, lot's so messed up.

522
00:37:45,145 --> 00:37:47,943
<i>I know it is,
but it's not about you, okay?</i>

523
00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:51,211
I'm going down to the Augusta Plus.

524
00:37:51,284 --> 00:37:56,517
Why don't you pack your stack and take a
ride with me? I wanna see you hand these over.

525
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,524
<i>Pack your stack.</i>

526
00:37:58,592 --> 00:38:02,119
A lot of the guys, when they're goin' out
to assist customers with their bags...

527
00:38:02,195 --> 00:38:04,129
they're doin'
some lollygaggin' outside.

528
00:38:04,197 --> 00:38:06,131
And everyone wants to get fresh air.

529
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:08,633
<i>Don't get me wrong.
I like fresh air...</i>

530
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:12,866
<i>but we need you inside,
or else we're short-</i>

531
00:38:17,177 --> 00:38:19,441
<i>Several young men taunted me with chants...</i>

532
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:23,472
<i>of "ching chong Chinaman"
and "cinnamon face"!</i>

533
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:28,249
You know what? I'd like you
to read them to me right now.

534
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:32,018
- Out loud?
- No, read them to me silently.

535
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:41,561
"My grocery list didn't include
sexual harassment, but thanks.

536
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:44,433
Beth Kopins, 84."

537
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:50,035
- You want me to read all of these?
- Yes.

538
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,203
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry?

539
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,974
That's on the card.

540
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:59,576
"Fuck, that was a great
shopping experience. "

541
00:38:59,653 --> 00:39:02,087
- It doesn't say that, does it?
- No.

542
00:39:02,155 --> 00:39:05,022
What does it say then?

543
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:10,960
<i>Not a good demonstration
of my managerial skills.</i>

544
00:39:11,031 --> 00:39:14,728
<i>But I just decided to bear down,
motivate my staff to raise their game...</i>

545
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:17,167
<i>and just get more hands-on.</i>

546
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:19,688
<i>I was going to handle it. I was going
to keep my cool and handle anything.</i>

547
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:22,139
<i>I was going to handle it. I was going
to keep my cool and handle anything.</i>

548
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:25,770
<i>- Then something happened: The Tater
Tot incident- - You're on the lot.</i>

549
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:28,508
<i>Provoked by what I call
the "Yoo-hoo smash. "</i>

550
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:30,516
<i>Full Yoo-hoo.</i>

551
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:35,248
<i>Fuck!</i>

552
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:38,849
- That's assault! I'm callin' the police. You're gone!
- Suck my dick.

553
00:39:38,925 --> 00:39:41,587
<i>- You're fucking gone.
All spiced up with a little Mace.</i>

554
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,464
- I mean, what did he do? Did he grab you?
- He, like-

555
00:39:49,536 --> 00:39:51,731
A bottle hit me,
and then he tugged at my shirt.

556
00:39:51,805 --> 00:39:54,774
- He threw it?
- I don't know, someone in the group!

557
00:39:54,841 --> 00:39:57,435
Hey, you Maced him full in the face.
He's in the hospital.

558
00:39:57,511 --> 00:40:00,947
<i>- Why don't you calm down?
- He hit me in the head with a bottle. It's out there.</i>

559
00:40:01,014 --> 00:40:03,414
<i>Look, pal, there's a lot of bottles out there.</i>

560
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:05,951
What I know is, he's got a face
full of liquid frenzine...

561
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:10,149
<i>his mom and dad are upset, and I'm tryin'
to figure out what he did to you.</i>

562
00:40:10,223 --> 00:40:15,092
<i>They wanna talk to somebody-
an owner, they said.</i>

563
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:17,254
I have to call the board.
Frig.

564
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:20,788
- Man, he grabbed me.
- Are you going to press charges?

565
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:25,236
<i>I don't know. I have to talk to the board.
Are they? Can they?</i>

566
00:40:25,305 --> 00:40:28,797
I don't know.
The parents are upset.

567
00:40:39,886 --> 00:40:43,515
Javier, what are you-
You just left these here?

568
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,615
The bag's damaged.

569
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:49,184
What, are they gonna melt?
Come on, man.

570
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:55,167
This is bullshit.

571
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:58,796
This... is...

572
00:40:58,872 --> 00:41:00,840
bull...

573
00:41:00,907 --> 00:41:03,569
- shit!
- Ow!

574
00:41:03,643 --> 00:41:06,339
- Hey! Whoa!
- What?

575
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:09,849
- He's whippin' stuff at me.
- I was tossing them out. He walked right in front of me.

576
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:12,976
It hit me in the wrist.
They're heavy.

577
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,044
Ow. They're frozen.

578
00:41:15,121 --> 00:41:18,955
- Fuck you, Wehlner.
- What is your problem?

579
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:21,152
You want to file an in-store?

580
00:41:21,227 --> 00:41:25,288
- What?
- An in-store. An in-store complaint?

581
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:28,823
Geez. I don't know. It just-

582
00:41:28,902 --> 00:41:31,029
They're pretty dense.
They're frozen potatoes.

583
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:34,471
- Man, fuck you, Richard.
- What is your f'ing problem?

584
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:42,210
Something's wrong.
What's been bothering you?

585
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,041
You know, in the case
I don't get this job-

586
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:48,713
in a weird case
I don't get this job-

587
00:41:48,788 --> 00:41:51,985

I'm feeling a little
turned around here.

738
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,996
- Maybe I'm missing home.
- It's the home of the eagle.

739
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:34,403
- "It's a great place to soar," you said.
- Yeah.

740
00:51:34,473 --> 00:51:37,340
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

741
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:40,038
I just feel like I'm at camp
and I want to come home.

742
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,642
You did male gymnastics
in the junior Olympics?

743
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,417
- What?
- You were a male gymnast? Lopez said.

744
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:54,721
I don't know what they're saying. Name same
as mine popped up on Google or something.

745
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,687
Hey, watch your soups.

746
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:02,057
What about my soups?

747
00:52:03,502 --> 00:52:05,493
Your soups are sloppy.

748
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:11,100
- We're gonna be okay.
- Thanks, Lori.

749
00:52:11,177 --> 00:52:14,476
- I love you.
- I love you too.

750
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:16,708
<i>- I'll see you at home.
- I'll see you.</i>

751
00:52:16,782 --> 00:52:18,773
<i>I just have to log
these Mesquite Crunchers.</i>

752
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:20,819
Bye.

753
00:52:22,888 --> 00:52:24,822
Hey.

754
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:29,027
Are you gonna write me up, Doug?

755
00:52:29,095 --> 00:52:31,029
No, man.

756
00:52:46,178 --> 00:52:50,046
Yeah, I just- I just feel like
everything's getting to me.

757
00:52:50,116 --> 00:52:52,846
I know.

758
00:52:52,918 --> 00:52:56,547
Hey, smoke it down, bro.
I would, too, but I get bad headaches.

759
00:52:58,457 --> 00:53:02,416
I had some, like, lost years.

760
00:53:04,397 --> 00:53:06,331
Man, I was in a motorcycle gang.

761
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,762
Fuck you!

762
00:53:16,676 --> 00:53:18,701
I guess I'll just get everybody.

763
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,810
- Have a nice day, hon.
- You too.

764
00:53:27,053 --> 00:53:30,614
<i>Man, come on!</i>

765
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:34,524
We found each other
and started a family.

766
00:53:36,495 --> 00:53:38,520
We said we were gonna
make a go of it.

767
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:44,269
It's just hard.

768
00:53:44,337 --> 00:53:47,397
I mean, day care's 300.
Our premiums are 400.

769
00:53:47,473 --> 00:53:49,737
This dance class is $280 U.S.

770
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,743
Yeah.

771
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,804
This is what I did.

772
00:53:55,881 --> 00:53:58,907
I bought a house
that I can't even-

773
00:54:00,086 --> 00:54:02,919
I can't even nearly afford.

774
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:08,419
I'm gonna tell Lori I toked up.

775
00:54:08,494 --> 00:54:11,395
Yeah. I'm gonna tell Jen.
I have to.

776
00:54:11,464 --> 00:54:13,398
Because that's how you get happy-

777
00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:16,833
leading an honest life no matter
what your life's like beside.

778
00:54:18,637 --> 00:54:22,004
So I'm telling her.
Because that's a man.

779
00:54:22,074 --> 00:54:24,269
Because-

780
00:54:24,343 --> 00:54:27,608
If you have that
"to the max" clean love-

781
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,944
man, that-that "all the way" love-

782
00:54:31,951 --> 00:54:35,819
then you could be even,
like, a midget or something...

783
00:54:35,888 --> 00:54:37,913
and still light it up with a smile.

784
00:54:39,925 --> 00:54:43,019
So go on, let it shine.

785
00:54:43,095 --> 00:54:45,962
I'm not bullshittin'.
Lori, I can make a go of it.

786
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:48,591
We're goin'. We're goin' to Glasgow,
fuckin' like it or not.

787
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:52,626
Okay, great. Yeah, go visit your grammy.
And then come on back, yeah?

788
00:54:52,705 --> 00:54:55,503
Make it a holiday. I'll show you
I can make a big dancing go of it.

789
00:54:55,574 --> 00:54:57,701
Tell your grammy I said hi.
I'll be seeing her.

790
00:54:57,777 --> 00:55:00,371
I'll tell Grammy that you're a doper.
I'll tell Grammy that.

791
00:55:00,446 --> 00:55:02,607
Whoa. Lori, don't.

792
00:55:02,681 --> 00:55:05,582
Okay, Chrissie. Have a little holiday
with your grammy.

793
00:55:05,651 --> 00:55:08,848
- All right. Let's go.
- I'll be seein' ya.

794
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:10,912
Lori, make it a holiday.

795
00:55:13,793 --> 00:55:17,456
- Will you get the mail in when you get home?
- Yeah. No problem.

796
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,498
- I gotta tell you something.
- Mark, you remember Doug.

797
00:55:19,565 --> 00:55:22,728
- Yeah. Hey. Teddy Grahams.
- Yeah, hey.

798
00:55:22,802 --> 00:55:25,635
- We got surgery at 10:00. A
cleft palate- two-year-old. - Okay.

799
00:55:25,704 --> 00:55:31,233
- What's a cleft palate? - It's a
deformation of the "mascus"- the lower face.

800
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:34,643
Medically, it's "masculari horriblus"...

801
00:55:34,713 --> 00:55:37,841
which is Latin for "monster face. "

802
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:42,013
And I guess some of these kids
really do feel like monsters.

803
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:45,147
But we restore them to normalcy.

804
00:55:45,224 --> 00:55:47,488
You should see it, man.
It's beautiful.

805
00:55:50,229 --> 00:55:52,527
- Man.
- Yeah.

806
00:55:57,436 --> 00:56:01,099
- What? Tell me what.
- Nothing. I'll see you tonight.

807
00:56:01,173 --> 00:56:02,902
Okay.

808
00:56:04,076 --> 00:56:06,101
- Let me show you something.
- Yeah.

809
00:56:13,385 --> 00:56:17,082
<i>One way to go from planning to tell
the truth to telling another lie...</i>

810
00:56:17,156 --> 00:56:20,887
<i>is to find a gift from your wife-
who has no money-</i>

811
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,121
<i>of some long-sleeved shirts...</i>

812
00:56:23,195 --> 00:56:25,129
<i>because she believes
you'll dress more formally...</i>

813
00:56:25,197 --> 00:56:28,894
<i>as the shoo-in boss of a large grocery
because you said this.</i>

814
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:32,028
<i>When the truth is you might
stay a "short sleever"...</i>

815
00:56:32,104 --> 00:56:35,972
<i>for the foreseeable future
of thousands of days.</i>

816
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:38,771
- Hey. I like my shirts.
- Hey.

817
00:56:38,844 --> 00:56:41,074
What are you doing?

818
00:56:41,146 --> 00:56:44,707
It's for night school-
for the school thing, for just in case.

819
00:56:44,783 --> 00:56:46,717
I thought I should do it.

820
00:56:46,785 --> 00:56:50,585
- Are you worried?
- No. But just in case.

821
00:56:50,656 --> 00:56:53,489
I didn't want to miss the sign-up.
I want to save a spot.

822
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:57,222
- You have to write a check?
- 180.

823
00:56:58,931 --> 00:57:01,297
Don't. Because I got the job.

824
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:03,835
- They decided?
- Yeah. I got the job.

825
00:57:03,903 --> 00:57:07,168
- Doug! You are great!
- Yeah.

826
00:57:08,173 --> 00:57:10,641
Good-bye, banjo fuckers!

827
00:57:10,709 --> 00:57:12,643
Yeah.

828
00:57:18,918 --> 00:57:20,852
<i>I don't know what that was.</i>

829
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,252
<i>A lie wish?</i>

830
00:57:23,322 --> 00:57:25,984
<i>Way to go, Doug!</i>

831
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:30,127
Whoo.

832
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:54,478
<i>Hey, Scott, I wanted to mention, um-</i>

833
00:57:54,553 --> 00:57:56,544
My wrist is acting up a little...

834
00:57:56,622 --> 00:57:59,147
from the Tater Tot thing.

835
00:57:59,224 --> 00:58:03,160
So I think I should
probably do that in-store.

836
00:58:03,228 --> 00:58:04,991
The in-store complaint?

837
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,157
- Yeah.
- All right.

838
00:58:07,232 --> 00:58:09,666
That circulates through the company-

839
00:58:09,735 --> 00:58:12,727
to the board, everywhere.

840
00:58:12,805 --> 00:58:16,901
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I think that's probably for the best.

841
00:58:16,976 --> 00:58:19,001
You know, in case he does it
to somebody else.

842
00:58:20,379 --> 00:58:24,315
- Okay. I'll get the forms.
- Thanks, Scott.

843
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:28,717

01:01:46,685 --> 01:01:48,846
- I wanted to ask you a question about the application.
- No problem.

890
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:50,855
I'll see you guys later, all right?

891
01:01:50,923 --> 01:01:52,857
Hey, fellas.

892
01:01:57,429 --> 01:01:59,420
What was he doing?

893
01:01:59,498 --> 01:02:03,525
- Was he talking about jacking off?
- Richard?

894
01:02:03,602 --> 01:02:06,070
He was talking about jacking it?

895
01:02:06,138 --> 01:02:08,072
In front of customers?
Jacking dicks?

896
01:02:21,453 --> 01:02:25,150
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.

897
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,814
F. You!

898
01:02:49,882 --> 01:02:52,646
- What?
- I didn't say that.

899
01:02:52,718 --> 01:02:55,585
They asked me what you said.
That's what you said.

900
01:02:55,654 --> 01:02:58,953
- You know what? Fuck you, Doug.
- That's what you said.

901
01:02:59,024 --> 01:03:01,424
How's your wrist?
How's your wrist, Richard?

902
01:03:01,493 --> 01:03:03,757
- You're bogus.
- I'm bogus?

903
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:07,162
You lace that thing on, try to fuck me out of a job
- out of money for me and my wife.

904
01:03:07,232 --> 01:03:08,961
Those things weigh 62 grams.

905
01:03:09,034 --> 01:03:12,868
I don't know what a gram is,
but I guess that's a lot 'cause you're hurt.

906
01:03:12,938 --> 01:03:14,872
Get off me, Wehlner!

907
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,306
See you later, Tappy.

908
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:20,277
What, are you wearing tap shoes?

909
01:03:20,345 --> 01:03:22,279
Lori left me, little boy.

910
01:03:22,347 --> 01:03:24,713
It's the only class
I can attend as a single.

911
01:03:24,783 --> 01:03:27,149
Goddamn! Come on!

912
01:03:32,524 --> 01:03:34,549
<i>Is that guy wearing tap shoes?</i>

913
01:03:38,297 --> 01:03:40,731
Come on!

914
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,391
- Fuck off!
- Yeah?

915
01:03:42,467 --> 01:03:44,367
Come on, dick!
Come on!

916
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:49,139
- Fuck you!
- Hold it! Not cool!

917
01:03:51,076 --> 01:03:53,738
Not cool! Go inside.

918
01:03:55,814 --> 01:03:58,282
Sorry, Scott.

919
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:00,477
<i>- Dancing bear.
- Yeah, wife liar!</i>

920
01:04:04,723 --> 01:04:07,385
<i>I was lunching with Jen...</i>

921
01:04:07,459 --> 01:04:10,394
<i>trying to forget about it and roll into
the crucial second interview.</i>

922
01:04:11,496 --> 01:04:14,522
<i>Then I spied that Big World.</i>

923
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:16,624
<i>Remember Do-Good and Dodo?</i>

924
01:04:17,903 --> 01:04:21,031
<i>Dodo makes lunchtime
unpleasant for everyone.</i>

925
01:04:30,615 --> 01:04:34,210
<i>Do-Good shares his peanut brittle
with the new... Negro.</i>

926
01:04:36,588 --> 01:04:38,613
"Negro"?

927
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:41,557
What the fuck?

928
01:04:45,263 --> 01:04:47,959
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

929
01:04:49,534 --> 01:04:52,435
<i>Sometimes, Do-Good cleans up a mess...</i>

930
01:04:52,504 --> 01:04:54,438
<i>even if he didn't make it.</i>

931
01:04:56,775 --> 01:05:00,267
<i>Dodo is sometimes simply
not a good young man.</i>

932
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,827
<i>Hey, Lori. It's me.</i>

933
01:05:23,902 --> 01:05:26,928
Hey, uh, tomorrow's the big day-
the final sit-down.

934
01:05:27,005 --> 01:05:29,371
You know, the final interview thing.

935
01:05:29,441 --> 01:05:31,568
Then they make their decision.

936
01:05:31,643 --> 01:05:34,111
Hey, guess what.
I'm taking tap dancing.

937
01:05:34,179 --> 01:05:37,945
The studio wouldn't give me
the deposit back, so I'm tappin'.

938
01:05:38,016 --> 01:05:40,177
I've gotta say I really like it.
It's real-

939
01:05:40,252 --> 01:05:42,982
It's a real dance style.
Very expressive.

940
01:05:43,055 --> 01:05:46,183
Um, anyway, whatever.
I'm still dancin', practicin'.

941
01:05:46,258 --> 01:05:48,192
And, uh-

942
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,785
Listen, Lori.

943
01:05:50,862 --> 01:05:53,092
I love you, and I miss you.

944
01:05:54,633 --> 01:05:56,362
Bye.

945
01:05:56,435 --> 01:06:00,804
<i>#And deep down
we were really in love #</i>

946
01:06:02,574 --> 01:06:05,737
<i># Oh, but I'm tired
of holdin' on #</i>

947
01:06:05,811 --> 01:06:07,938
<i># To a feelin'
I know is gone #</i>

948
01:06:08,013 --> 01:06:11,608
<i>A man probably has just a half dozen or so...</i>

949
01:06:11,683 --> 01:06:14,811
<i>really critical days in his life-
that's all-</i>

950
01:06:14,886 --> 01:06:19,914
<i>a few days that can totally determine
the quality of his future.</i>

951
01:06:19,991 --> 01:06:24,655
<i>This chapter is dedicated to helping you-
Richard Wehlner-</i>

952
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:30,429
<i>to make the most of the few really golden
opportunities many of us will actually have.</i>

953
01:06:30,502 --> 01:06:34,598
<i>So let's let this classic track
take us into Chapter 10.</i>

954
01:06:34,673 --> 01:06:39,167
<i>"Time for Me to Fly. "</i>

955
01:06:39,244 --> 01:06:41,940
<i># Time for me to fly #</i>

956
01:06:42,013 --> 01:06:45,244
<i># Oh, I've got
to set myself free #</i>

957
01:06:45,317 --> 01:06:48,047
<i>- # Time for me to fly #
- # Oh, baby #</i>

958
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,817
<i># That's just how
it's got to be #</i>

959
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:56,350
<i># Oh, I know it hurts
to say good-bye #</i>

960
01:06:56,428 --> 01:06:59,556
<i>#But it's time for me to fly #</i>

961
01:06:59,631 --> 01:07:02,259
<i>#It's time for me to fly #</i>

962
01:07:02,334 --> 01:07:05,565
<i>#It's time for me to fly #</i>

963
01:07:05,637 --> 01:07:08,105
<i>#It's time for me to fly #</i>

964
01:07:08,173 --> 01:07:10,971
<i>#It's time for me to fly #</i>

965
01:07:11,042 --> 01:07:13,875
<i>#It's time for me to fly #</i>

966
01:07:13,945 --> 01:07:17,403
<i>#It's time for me to fly ##</i>

967
01:07:17,482 --> 01:07:20,280
<i>By the way, don't tell
anyone that track's on here.</i>

968
01:07:20,352 --> 01:07:22,582
<i>Because I didn't pay
for the licensing.</i>

969
01:07:27,192 --> 01:07:29,217
You have to pull the card back out.

970
01:07:34,766 --> 01:07:38,964
<i>Orange Line, Midway. Now changing to direct.</i>

971
01:07:39,037 --> 01:07:41,665
<i>Orange Line, Midway.
Now changing to direct.</i>

972
01:08:33,925 --> 01:08:36,758
<i>We have a temporary delay.</i>

973
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:53,744
<i># When #</i>

974
01:08:55,380 --> 01:09:00,079
<i># Whenever Paul #</i>

975
01:09:01,486 --> 01:09:04,944
<i># Thinks of rain #</i>

976
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:10,855
<i>#Swallows fall #</i>

977
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:17,692
<i>#In a wave #</i>

978
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:23,766
<i>#And tap on his window #</i>

979
01:09:23,842 --> 01:09:26,709
Chapter 12. "Finishing Strong. "

980
01:09:26,778 --> 01:09:30,407
I've written this chapter
as a reminder of your new skills.

981
01:09:31,616 --> 01:09:33,846
Perhaps you'll choose
to listen to this passage...

982
01:09:33,918 --> 01:09:36,443
on the morning
of your most important day.

983
01:09:37,722 --> 01:09:41,488
So here it goes,
because you're ready.

984
01:09:41,559 --> 01:09:43,493
Richard Wehlner-

985
01:09:43,561 --> 01:09:45,495
is totally number one.

986
01:09:46,564 --> 01:09:48,896
Because- Richard Wehlner-

987
01:09:48,967 --> 01:09:50,901
shows true grit.

988
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:55,303
Richard Wehlner
- is not afraid to put others under his thumb...

989
01:09:55,373 --> 01:10:01,175
<i>because- Richard Wehlner-
totally does more than what's expected.</i>

990
01:10:01,246 --> 01:10:03,407
<i>#Rings just once #</i>

991
01:10:03,481 --> 01:10:09,010
<i>#Late at night #</i>

992
01:10:09,087 --> 01:10:13,217
<i>#Like a bird #</i>

993
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:15,885
<i>#Don't be scared #</i>

994
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:20,988
<i>#Don't believe
you're all alone #</i>

995
01:10:24,469 --> 01:10:28,132
<i># Wake #</i>

996
01:10:28,206 --> 01:10:32,905
<i># Wake up, Paul #</i>

997
01:10:32,977 --> 01:10:37,710
<i># Whisper clouds #</i>

998
01:10:37,782 --> 01:10:43,152
<i>#Rolling by #</i>

999
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:48,386
<i>#And the seeds ##</i>

1000
01:10:51,596 --> 01:10:53,621
<i>Is there anything you'd like to add?</i>

1001
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:56,428
Just that I'd give
the new store my all.

1002
01:10:56,501 --> 01:10:58,435
I think you would.

1003
01:10:58,503 --> 01:11:01,233
Good. So if there's nothing else...

1004
01:11:01,306 --> 01:11:03,297
send in jack apples.

1005
01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:07,605
<i>Let's get apple jacker's
interview over with.</i>

1006
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,580
That cheese cracker.

1007
01:11:16,554 --> 01:11:18,988
Good luck.

1008
01:11:19,057 --> 01:11:21,048
Because you're gonna need it.

1009
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:25,457
<i>Before I get Richard,
I just-</i>

1010
01:11:29,134 --> 01:11:33,503
We have this bag boy
- Hardy. I wanted to tell you that, when you thought...

1011
01:11:33,571 --> 01:11:37,007
that Richard Wehlner
was talking trash talk, as you said...

1012
01:11:37,075 --> 01:11:40,943
Richard was just letting me know there are
parts of Hardy's life that made him sad.

1013
01:11:41,012 --> 01:11:44,539
- That's all.
- Which parts?

1014
01:11:47,218 --> 01:11:51,712
Um, the parts where Hardy
can't stop masturbating his penis.

1015
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:55,726
<i>So he has a powdered right hand
for a deterrent.</i>

1016
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:01,822
Wouldn't powder make
the experience better?

1017
01:12:03,134 --> 01:12:06,592
Uh, probably, but-

1018
01:12:06,671 --> 01:12:11,540
This is a specific powder
with sandpaper-like qualities, I think.

1019
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:15,340
<i>All I'm saying is that-
Richard is a good guy.</i>

1020
01:12:17,015 --> 01:12:18,983
<i>He's not out of line
or inappropriate.</i>

1021
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:21,518
I wanted you to know.

1022
01:12:21,586 --> 01:12:23,577
He's a real good grocer.

1023
01:12:23,655 --> 01:12:26,215
So if there was
no inappropriate talk...

1024
01:12:26,291 --> 01:12:28,657
I guess that leaves you guys
on equal footing.

1025
01:12:32,397 --> 01:12:35,423
Yeah. I guess.

1026
01:12:36,634 --> 01:12:39,228
Tell Richard we'll be with him
in five minutes.

1027
01:12:44,175 --> 01:12:46,735
Are you all done?

1028
01:12:46,811 --> 01:12:49,678
They said wait around.

1029
01:12:49,747 --> 01:12:52,648
- For what?
- They didn't say.

1030
01:12:52,717 --> 01:12:54,708
They just said wait around.

1031
01:13:30,221 --> 01:13:32,155
I'm fucked.

1032
01:14:07,892 --> 01:14:10,622
Hey. Richard.

1033
01:14:12,263 --> 01:14:14,197
Doug.

1034
01:14:15,366 --> 01:14:17,698
We're all just out here
tryin' to get some food.

1035
01:14:19,837 --> 01:14:22,271
Sometimes we bump into each other.

1036
01:14:31,749 --> 01:14:33,683
Stay loose, Doug.

1037
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:48,624
<i>#Every day, I'm gonna
strut that stuff #</i>

1038
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,895
Hey. I've enjoyed our time together.

1039
01:14:50,969 --> 01:14:53,164
But now it's time
for you to get out there...

1040
01:14:53,237 --> 01:14:55,762
and just kick everyone's ass.

1041
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,209
See you at the yacht club, my good friend-
Richard Wehln-

1042
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:16,518
- Do one thing for me.
- Yeah, babe.

1043
01:15:16,594 --> 01:15:18,755
You fix that little ship...

1044
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:21,765
and you keep it cool
and keep it clean, mister.

1045
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:25,166
- Chrissie's sleepin'.
- Okay.

1046
01:15:33,244 --> 01:15:35,735
<i>Don't get f'ing tangled.
Come on.</i>

1047
01:15:42,553 --> 01:15:44,544
Tell me again why you're not at work.

1048
01:15:44,622 --> 01:15:46,852
I carved out some free time.

1049
01:15:46,924 --> 01:15:49,791
- On your first day?
- Yep.

1050
01:15:54,165 --> 01:15:56,326
You didn't start
your new job today, did you?

1051
01:15:57,402 --> 01:15:59,336
No.

1052
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:04,840
You didn't actually get it yet,
did you?

1053
01:16:04,909 --> 01:16:06,934
No.

1054
01:16:07,011 --> 01:16:09,138
Doug, why did you tell me that?

1055
01:16:09,213 --> 01:16:11,807
I said I could go back to school.

1056
01:16:11,883 --> 01:16:15,148
I want to be the primary
breadwinner, Jen. Come on.

1057
01:16:17,922 --> 01:16:19,913
Female lions do the hunting.

1058
01:16:21,592 --> 01:16:24,390
I'm not a lion.

1059
01:16:24,462 --> 01:16:26,453
I'm a guy.

1060
01:16:26,531 --> 01:16:28,829
<i>Get up there, son of a b.</i>

1061
01:16:39,544 --> 01:16:42,274
- I was embarrassed.
- About what?

1062
01:16:42,346 --> 01:16:44,280
Our life.

1063
01:16:44,348 --> 01:16:46,839
- And George Washington Carver.
- George-

1064
01:16:46,918 --> 01:16:49,216
Who made all this stuff
out of peanuts-

1065
01:16:49,287 --> 01:16:51,221
blankets, peanut silverware...

1066
01:16:51,289 --> 01:16:53,223
a peanut car, a peanut gun.

1067
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:55,623
<i>- No, he didn't.
- He made some peanut stuff.</i>

1068
01:16:55,693 --> 01:16:57,854
And he was a slave.

1069
01:16:57,929 --> 01:17:00,159
I should've made something by now.

1070
01:17:00,231 --> 01:17:02,665
<i>I'm 33 years old.
I sell peanuts.</i>

1071
01:17:04,802 --> 01:17:06,793
<i>I am peanuts.</i>

1072
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:13,769
You're such a guy.

1073
01:17:24,622 --> 01:17:25,611
Hey.

1074
01:17:27,592 --> 01:17:28,616
Fuck!

1075
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:36,291
- I tried, babe.
- I know.

1076
01:17:38,803 --> 01:17:41,101
I'll get the next one, babe,
all the way.

1077
01:17:41,172 --> 01:17:44,505
- I know.
- I love you.

1078
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:46,736
Love you too.

1079
01:18:18,209 --> 01:18:21,542
- Hello.
- Doug. Mitch from Donaldson's.

1080
01:18:21,612 --> 01:18:23,603
- Hey.
- We've made our choice.

1081
01:18:23,681 --> 01:18:27,845
Between you and me, Richard
failed his drug test- spectacularly.

1082
01:18:27,919 --> 01:18:30,046
So it was you and Donnie Wahls
from Lakeview.

1083
01:18:30,121 --> 01:18:32,055
But he's pretty junior.

1084
01:18:32,123 --> 01:18:35,217
So I'm calling to say
welcome aboard.

1085
01:18:37,962 --> 01:18:41,295
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

1086
01:18:41,365 --> 01:18:43,299
I just wanted to say welcome aboard.

1087
01:18:43,367 --> 01:18:46,530
Oh, hey. Welcome aboard
to you too, Mitch.

1088
01:18:46,604 --> 01:18:50,040
- Yeah. Doug, we'll see you on the seventh at 8:00 a. m.
- Okay, yeah.

1089
01:18:50,107 --> 01:18:53,304
- Hey-Hey, Mitch. Thanks.
- See you, Doug.

1090
01:18:59,984 --> 01:19:03,147
<i>Standing downtown,
I thought of everything that happened.</i>

1091
01:19:03,221 --> 01:19:05,155
<i>Was I the better man?</i>

1092
01:19:05,223 --> 01:19:07,555
<i>I don't know.
I just know I started running.</i>

1093
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:09,559
<i>Maybe because
I got something I needed.</i>

1094
01:19:09,627 --> 01:19:11,652
<i>And if I met Richard
in the street or somewhere...</i>

1095
01:19:11,729 --> 01:19:13,720
<i>I think I could still
shake his hand.</i>

1096
01:19:14,732 --> 01:19:17,394
<i>So was I the better man?</i>

1097
01:19:17,468 --> 01:19:19,459
<i>I don't know.
I just felt like a man.</i>

1098
01:19:24,008 --> 01:19:27,239
<i>Man, I hadn't felt that good
since I placed silver in Boys' Apparatus-</i>

1099
01:19:29,146 --> 01:19:30,738
<i>in the junior Olympics.</i>

1100
01:19:40,091 --> 01:19:42,025
Yeah!

1101
01:19:49,967 --> 01:19:54,700
<i>I never saw Richard again, but I heard
he went back to Canada with his family...</i>

1102
01:19:54,772 --> 01:19:56,535
<i>back to his old grocery.</i>

1103
01:19:56,607 --> 01:20:00,043
<i>I also heard he put out a storage room fire
with his bare hands or something...</i>

1104
01:20:00,111 --> 01:20:02,204
<i>and got promoted to manager.</i>

1105
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:06,307
<i>There are rumors he started the fire himself
for self-promotion purposes.</i>

1106
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:09,512
<i>But either way,
he's a higher-up now.</i>

1107
01:20:09,587 --> 01:20:12,750
<i>And that's cool, because he can
get a place for his wife and girl.</i>

1108
01:20:12,823 --> 01:20:15,917
<i>He can save a little something
off to the side for himself too.</i>

1109
01:20:15,993 --> 01:20:17,984
<i>I don't know, maybe a new chopper.</i>

1110
01:20:30,374 --> 01:20:34,174
<i>#Put your face where we can see it #</i>

1111

1112
