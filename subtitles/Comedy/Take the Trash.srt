1
00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:06,843
Kill him, Raphael!

2
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:12,015
Kill him, let's go!

3
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:17,729
When you watch this video...

4
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:20,357
I'll probably be dead.

5
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:24,653
The police are after me

6
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:29,491
because I've got something very
valuable to a powerful politician.

7
00:01:30,408 --> 00:01:32,410
But I'm not going to give it up.

8
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:34,037
They'll have to come get me.

9
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:37,123
I was afraid before, not now.

10
00:01:37,957 --> 00:01:41,169
I'm going to finish what
Jose Angelo started.

11
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:16,963
I found something for us.

12
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:17,714
I found something for us.
What?

13
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:19,674
I'll show you later.

14
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:31,644
The boss is an ass

15
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:34,772
paying less because I'm a kid.

16
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:37,066
I said I had something good, right?

17
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:38,776
Smell the cash.

18
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:43,698
Knock it off.

19
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,410
See this? It's yours.

20
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:52,707
What about the rest?

21
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,793
Trust me.

22
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:57,837
Alright, go and change this.

23
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,505
Hurry up.

24
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:01,758
Throw this away.

25
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:03,843
Don't be crazy.

26
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:06,721
See you at the church.

27
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:08,306
I want my money back!

28
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:12,602
Mad man.

29
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:17,315
Jose Angelo.

30
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:34,665
The Animal Lottery...

31
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:50,014
Congressman Santos...

32
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:51,891
This can't happen during my election.

33
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:53,643
Get it out of him.

34
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,276
We want the money and the book.

35
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:06,322
Tell me.

36
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:08,199
What was in the wallet?

37
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:16,332
Nothing.

38
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,002
Don't worry, I know how to fix this.

39
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:50,408
After we finish, we'll eat.

40
00:09:56,164 --> 00:09:57,373
Fourteen?

41
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:01,169
The name...of the animal.

42
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,610
Hey, Gardo.

43
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,334
Check this out.

44
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:45,671
Some good chicken.

45
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:47,632
You spent all our money?

46
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:09,612
Such a dick.

47
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:17,203
Come on, let's get Maria to cook it up.

48
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,506
Good food tonight, guys!

49
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:39,410
A friend has lost something important.

50
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:48,336
He'll pay everyone R$20 to help find it.

51
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:52,256
We know it's here.

52
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:06,103
Hey, don't drop it..

53
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:11,317
Gardo, watch out.

54
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:17,948
Taking pictures? Take one of me.

55
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,701
Strike a nice pose.

56
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:26,582
What's going on?

57
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:30,378
We're looking for something.

58
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:33,381
A wallet.

59
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,800
It was lost, we need to find it.

60
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:40,805
Any reward for it?

61
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:47,103
How much?

62
00:13:47,812 --> 00:13:49,021
R$1000.

63
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:52,900
What's your name?

64
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:57,071
Gardo.

65
00:13:57,822 --> 00:13:58,864
And you?

66
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,243
Raphael.

67
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:03,744
How old are you?

68
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:05,079
14.

69
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:07,832
14, too.

70
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,917
You always answer for your boyfriend?

71
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,253
If he is or isn't, that's
not your business...

72
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,629
Cool?

73
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:17,800
So why do the police give a damn?

74
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:20,344
The wallet is important.

75
00:14:20,803 --> 00:14:22,513
Very important.

76
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,518
It's a clue to solve a crime, get it?

77
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:29,019
I get it.

78
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:30,646
Will you be here tomorrow to help me?

79
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:31,564
Of course.

80
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:34,066
Good boy.

81
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:43,701
How did you pay for this?

82
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,341
Like I always say...

83
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,260
Never trust a policeman.

84
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,346
Police treat poor people like trash.

85
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:06,557
Everyone knows that.

86
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:08,642
Except this dumbass here.

87
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:14,482
So tomorrow we work and get our R$20,

88
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:17,693
then hand in the wallet
and claim the R$1000.

89
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:18,569
Easy.

90
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:20,112
Why not?

91
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:22,656
I don't believe a word of it.

92
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:25,326
You're crazy, he's cool.

93
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:26,869
What's your problem?

94
00:15:28,037 --> 00:15:30,748
R$1000 for a wallet? He's after
something else.

95
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:31,957
Like what?

96
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,918
This guy.

97
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,336
That's just some guy.

98
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:37,588
Tomorrow the wallet might
be worth R$2000.

99
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:39,590
You never know.

100
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:47,973
I don't know if I'm crazy
or just too persistent.

101
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:50,601
You're persistent alright.

102
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:52,937
Where are we going?

103
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:54,605
Rat's place.

104
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:56,315
Not Rat!

105
00:15:56,398 --> 00:15:57,691
He smells, man.

106
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:59,235
He's our only option.

107
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:00,611
Why Rat?

108
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:02,321
Nobody will look there.

109
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:04,114
You're paranoid.

110
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,784
You let the cop take photos...

111
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,286
and told him our names.

112
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,287
You're an idiot.

113
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:13,207
And you have chicken poo in your head.

114
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,416
No I don't.

115
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,251
Do.

116
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:16,961
Do not.

117
00:16:22,258 --> 00:16:24,468
Look at the rats, Jesus!

118
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,012
I'll be waiting here.

119
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:41,860
Rat!

120
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:49,660
Do us a favor?

121
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:50,786
What?

122
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:52,580
Keep something for us?

123
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,087
The police are looking for it...

124
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,255
Where's the cash?

125
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:02,923
What cash?

126
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:05,676
No deal then, shit for brains.

127
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,094
Okay, we spent it.

128
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:09,388
No money and you want help?

129
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,682
What's in it for me?

130
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:13,100
There's a reward.

131
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:13,934
How much?

132
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:15,185
R$50.

133
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:16,937
Stay out of it, jerk.

134
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:19,940
Let's go, he's a dick.

135
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:22,192
I'll give you a cut.

136
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:23,861
An even cut?

137
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:28,324
There's no point, let's go.

138
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:33,537
I bet this is what they're after.

139
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:37,541
I know what it opens.

140
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,584
Tell me.

141
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,002
Equal cut?

142
00:17:43,547 --> 00:17:46,258
People don't like me at the dump.

143
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:48,469
I'm the sewer kid.

144
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:50,429
It's my disease...

145
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:51,930
What can you do?

146
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:10,783
We have to follow the Rat, come on!

147
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,459
How do we get past the cops?

148
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:24,088
Where's he taking us?

149
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,465
That way. Get in there...

150
00:18:39,144 --> 00:18:40,354
What are you doing back here?

151
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:41,689
Got to go in...

152
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:45,316
Who's there?

153
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:46,402
Who's there?
My friends.

154
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,278
You setting me up?

155
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:51,615
You're vermin. You don't have friends.

156
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:54,618
Go, Cockroach. Check them out.

157
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,705
Who's that guy?

158
00:18:58,163 --> 00:19:00,124
If you want to get through,
I need money.

159
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:05,879
Not enough, I need more.

160
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:08,882
Boss wants to know why you're here.

161
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:11,093
The boss? Let me talk to him.

162
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:12,845
Shut up.

163
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:15,806
Maybe I'll take this ear.

164
00:19:16,473 --> 00:19:17,808
It's way too big.

165
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:19,351
Get me a knife.

166
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:24,732
We can make a deal.

167
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,400
He's messing with your friend.

168
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:35,993
I brought it for you, a present.

169
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:41,498
Let them through.

170
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:50,132
Got a problem?

171
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:52,676
You want to die?

172
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:00,225
How do you know that prick?

173
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,436
I used to work here.

174
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,439
No wonder you're a freak.

175
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:11,445
It opens a locker over there.

176
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:16,366
Give me the key.

177
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,995
Do you trust me?

178
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:21,079
We'll go together?

179
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:33,300
Christ, there are police everywhere.

180
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:34,968
Deal with it.

181
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:36,887
So, you're the boss now?

182
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,889
There's no boss here.

183
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,225
We've got to work together.

184
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:44,770
Fine, I'll handle it.

185
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:46,522
Where's he going?

186
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:48,440
God knows, he's your friend.

187
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:53,779
Shout! Shout!

188
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:56,865
Louder!

189
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,913
He's a genius!

190
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:25,602
Damn, only an envelope.

191
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:52,629
Suck on this, you racist assholes!

192
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:07,978
Go after them!

193
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,521
Get 'em!

194
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:14,943
Open up!

195
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:18,780
What did you find?

196
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:23,660
How much?

197
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:25,162
Millions!

198
00:22:25,704 --> 00:22:27,080
Take me with you!

199
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:36,006
What's up, boys?

200
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:38,592
Drinks are on me.

201
00:22:38,842 --> 00:22:40,427
Are you crazy?

202
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:42,179
You scared me.

203
00:22:42,512 --> 00:22:44,806
He told me to do my thing.

204
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:47,392
Where's the stuff?

205
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,649
"Deliver to Prisoner Joao Clemente"

206
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:55,359
"Cova Prison"

207
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:57,027
That's it?

208
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:00,072
Are we rich?

209
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:10,499
Who's that?

210
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:12,834
Jose Angelo.

211
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:17,923
It was a disaster...

212
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:20,509
Nearly killed for a letter!

213
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:24,054
It wasn't just a letter.

214
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,974
Raphael wanted to know more.

215
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:29,226
So he still needed me...

216
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:32,062
Because I'm the man, the man
with the plan.

217
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:04,469
The internet is slow.

218
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:08,348
So many links.

219
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:12,227
He was a lawyer.

220
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,334
Hurry, hurry!

221
00:24:47,512 --> 00:24:49,473
Gabriel, are you hungry?

222
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,434
Activist, what's that?

223
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:55,020
He built lots of houses for the poor.

224
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:03,528
They stopped him.

225
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,048
Look at that.

226
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,510
He took to the streets.

227
00:25:27,511 --> 00:25:28,553
More butter.

228
00:25:32,516 --> 00:25:34,017
Then they put him in jail.

229
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,852
Something's not right.

230
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:51,034
Print! Print!

231
00:25:53,036 --> 00:25:54,162
Bless me.

232
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:08,426
Butter?

233
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:10,637
Lettuce?

234
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:14,099
More cheese?

235
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:28,613
I found it! I found it!

236
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:40,000
No, back to work, punk.

237
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:47,299
Boy! Come here.

238
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:51,928
Everyone here?

239
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:52,888
Yes.

240
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:57,767
Do you know those boys, Raphael
and Gardo, they here?

241
00:27:04,941 --> 00:27:07,277
They didn't come to work today.

242
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,369
So, the guy in prison
is a serial killer.

243
00:27:16,453 --> 00:27:20,624
And Jose Angelo buries the bodies.

244
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:24,169
None of that's written there.

245
00:27:24,628 --> 00:27:26,338
You can't even read!

246
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:29,257
Pay me two bucks for playing my game.

247
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,594
He thinks I'm paying for it!

248
00:27:34,804 --> 00:27:36,973
This game is sick.

249
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:37,974
Want to buy it?

250
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:38,892
How much?

251
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:40,393
R$800.

252
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:47,901
Give the wallet back and
we can buy the game.

253
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:51,154
Let me think about it.

254
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:54,908
Seriously, let's get that reward.

255
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:55,825
Not yet.

256
00:27:56,618 --> 00:27:58,036
Let's talk to the prisoner first.

257
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,663
Not me.

258
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:02,165
I'll go on my own then.

259
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:09,256
Forget the guy in jail.

260
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:11,925
We give Rat R$500...

261
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:13,927
He'll take it.

262
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:16,680
The game's not worth more.

263
00:28:18,014 --> 00:28:19,516
We rent it...

264
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,602
50 cents for 30 minutes

265
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:27,482
Look, I'm about to win!

266
00:28:30,235 --> 00:28:32,028
Piece of shit, it's crashed.

267
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:46,918
You think he can help?

268
00:28:47,043 --> 00:28:48,503
He's a priest!

269
00:28:52,716 --> 00:28:54,301
You can't wake him up!

270
00:28:56,386 --> 00:28:57,470
Wait here.

271
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,440
Raphael's been taken.

272
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:37,302
You should've taken me seriously.

273
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:56,654
Have you had dinner?

274
00:29:57,447 --> 00:30:00,158
I don't want you messing up the car.

275
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:23,950
I'm looking for a boy.

276
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:27,203
Raphael Fernandez. Here's a photo.

277
00:31:27,328 --> 00:31:29,497
We don't take minors here.

278
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:31,624
I know he's here.

279
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:36,212
No minors in here, this is
a police station.

280
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:06,743
Water?

281
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:25,386
I found...

282
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:28,181
R$300.

283
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:30,266
So you lied.

284
00:32:31,434 --> 00:32:33,895
You did find something.

285
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,399
Find anything else?

286
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:41,110
Raphael...

287
00:32:54,165 --> 00:32:55,875
Do you like rollercoasters?

288
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:15,687
What a joke.

289
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,564
Have some respect, old man.

290
00:35:56,264 --> 00:35:59,058
He's with God now.

291
00:36:33,968 --> 00:36:36,345
Want to know how Jose Angelo died?

292
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:50,401
Are you praying?

293
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:56,991
May God protect you.

294
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:05,833
Finish him.

295
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:10,171
What are you going to tell Santos?

296
00:37:40,952 --> 00:37:42,537
You chickened out...

297
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,914
Santos can do his own dirty work.

298
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,623
I'm not working anymore.

299
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,752
Help!

300
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:34,046
There's a kid up here on the road!

301
00:39:15,171 --> 00:39:17,673
If you found the wallet

302
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,177
the best plan is to get out of trouble

303
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,346
while you still have time.

304
00:39:26,057 --> 00:39:30,353
There's nothing cowardly about it.

305
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:34,982
In fact, it's the brave way out.

306
00:39:37,526 --> 00:39:40,321
If you give me the wallet

307
00:39:40,738 --> 00:39:42,114
I'll collect...

308
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:45,993
the reward.

309
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:48,829
Everyone's life

310
00:39:48,913 --> 00:39:50,957
will get a little bit better.

311
00:39:51,582 --> 00:39:53,709
A little bit better, is good.

312
00:39:54,543 --> 00:39:57,296
A little bit better is...

313
00:39:57,964 --> 00:40:00,424
a lot better than nothing.

314
00:40:24,907 --> 00:40:27,410
You bringing trouble to the community?

315
00:40:29,704 --> 00:40:31,831
So do you want to give up?

316
00:40:31,914 --> 00:40:34,000
Over my dead body.

317
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:35,668
I want you to know...

318
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:39,046
I'll follow you whatever.

319
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:42,258
I just need a little rest first.

320
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:47,763
If the cops didn't kill me this time...

321
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:51,267
they will next time.

322
00:40:52,143 --> 00:40:53,394
That was it.

323
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:55,730
We had to go on.

324
00:40:57,148 --> 00:40:59,442
All we had was a name.

325
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:01,610
So tell me this...

326
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:03,946
how could we get into a prison?

327
00:41:05,614 --> 00:41:07,158
We needed a plan.

328
00:41:07,783 --> 00:41:09,618
We needed a miracle.

329
00:41:10,244 --> 00:41:11,120
That too.

330
00:41:40,441 --> 00:41:42,485
Police...will...

331
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,571
kill...him.

332
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,707
Show it to her.

333
00:42:13,891 --> 00:42:15,476
Where's your grandfather?

334
00:42:24,985 --> 00:42:26,445
Why do you...

335
00:42:27,113 --> 00:42:29,198
Why do you need me?

336
00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:08,904
I remembered something.

337
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,952
The cops were talking
about a guy called Santos.

338
00:43:16,954 --> 00:43:18,998
I think he wants the letter.

339
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,918
Hey, I know Santos...

340
00:43:24,211 --> 00:43:25,588
He's that politician.

341
00:43:26,213 --> 00:43:28,424
The fat bastard wants to be Mayor.

342
00:43:28,966 --> 00:43:30,176
Do you know where he lives?

343
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:33,429
Where all the fat bastards live,
near the beach.

344
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:37,224
I can take you there.

345
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:41,312
What did Santos want with me?
Why did he want me dead?

346
00:43:41,395 --> 00:43:43,230
I've done nothing to him.

347
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:45,774
Doesn't make sense.

348
00:43:46,192 --> 00:43:48,110
I just wanted to go to the beach.

349
00:44:21,977 --> 00:44:22,978
Hey, hot stuff!

350
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,698
I've never been to the beach.

351
00:44:35,366 --> 00:44:38,327
I lived on the beach. I was born there.

352
00:44:39,286 --> 00:44:40,329
What was it like?

353
00:44:40,537 --> 00:44:42,164
It was beautiful.

354
00:44:42,248 --> 00:44:43,749
Far away from here...

355
00:44:43,832 --> 00:44:46,335
Perfect water. You can see the fish.

356
00:44:46,919 --> 00:44:48,420
You never go hungry there.

357
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:50,381
Make money fishing.

358
00:44:52,841 --> 00:44:54,343
Life there is fair.

359
00:44:55,177 --> 00:44:57,888
I'm going to move back, you should
come with me.

360
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,895
Sounds great.

361
00:45:19,576 --> 00:45:23,247
If you don't have a pass,
you don't get in...

362
00:45:31,964 --> 00:45:34,091
We have to wait in line.

363
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:09,501
Are you sure this is Santos' house?

364
00:46:09,585 --> 00:46:11,587
Yeah, I saw it on TV.

365
00:46:36,236 --> 00:46:37,236
What's going on here?

366
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:39,031
What's going on here?
Just picking fruit.

367
00:46:40,449 --> 00:46:42,076
Are you armed?

368
00:47:07,017 --> 00:47:09,144
You're crazy, jumping on
to private property.

369
00:47:13,357 --> 00:47:14,316
Scram.

370
00:47:16,568 --> 00:47:19,488
Shut those dogs up right now!

371
00:47:19,738 --> 00:47:21,407
Do I have to do everything myself?

372
00:47:37,548 --> 00:47:38,549
Crazy woman.

373
00:47:39,049 --> 00:47:40,300
Get down.

374
00:47:40,592 --> 00:47:43,387
If Mrs Santos catches you,
she'll kill you.

375
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,181
You picked a terrible time to drop in.

376
00:47:46,515 --> 00:47:47,558
What's going on?

377
00:48:38,734 --> 00:48:39,860
Good morning.

378
00:48:42,237 --> 00:48:43,614
You speak my language?

379
00:48:43,906 --> 00:48:45,282
A little.

380
00:48:45,616 --> 00:48:47,242
Thanks for the visit.

381
00:48:47,743 --> 00:48:50,746
I hope it wasn't too traumatic.

382
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:54,625
What's your name, kid?

383
00:49:28,951 --> 00:49:30,285
Who gave you my name?

384
00:49:32,287 --> 00:49:33,664
What's your scam, punk?

385
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,219
What's with all the security?

386
00:49:47,302 --> 00:49:49,513
Something important was
stolen from the boss.

387
00:49:49,596 --> 00:49:50,889
Was it a wallet?

388
00:49:50,973 --> 00:49:52,516
He wishes.

389
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:55,769
You think you can fit 10 million
in a wallet?

390
00:49:57,771 --> 00:49:58,564
Who stole it?

391
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:00,941
His name is Jose Angelo.

392
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,985
The boss's right-hand man.

393
00:50:03,068 --> 00:50:04,736
Fucking destroyed him.

394
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:09,783
Can you give me a hand?

395
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:11,410
I saved your ass.

396
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,663
Go get the bags on the lawn.

397
00:50:20,335 --> 00:50:21,753
I have a message for you.

398
00:50:29,928 --> 00:50:31,680
From Jose Angelo.

399
00:50:45,527 --> 00:50:46,737
How do you know this?

400
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,031
It was in a letter we found,
he wrote to you.

401
00:50:50,824 --> 00:50:52,075
What did he say?

402
00:50:57,456 --> 00:50:58,790
Do you have the letter here?

403
00:50:59,374 --> 00:51:00,876
No, it's here.

404
00:51:01,543 --> 00:51:02,961
I memorized it.

405
00:51:08,383 --> 00:51:09,343
Tell me.

406
00:51:09,468 --> 00:51:11,011
It read like this:

407
00:51:12,554 --> 00:51:14,264
Dear Sir,

408
00:51:14,931 --> 00:51:19,394
I haven't written in a long time,
but I think of you always.

409
00:51:20,145 --> 00:51:22,731
I have something important to tell you,

410
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:26,109
in the words you once spoke to me:

411
00:51:31,323 --> 00:51:36,078
Soon, the devil who put
you behind bars will be chained,

412
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:41,124
his corruption and lies all exposed.

413
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:45,253
Your struggle was not in vain.

414
00:51:47,214 --> 00:51:48,298
I promise.

415
00:51:49,466 --> 00:51:55,305
Santos will be finished and God willing,
he is only the first domino to fall.

416
00:51:57,182 --> 00:52:02,187
Your fight against the corruption that
destroyed our dream for justice goes on.

417
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:07,359
Even now people flood the streets,
fanning the flames of hope that you
helped ignite.

418
00:52:08,485 --> 00:52:09,945
Change is coming.

419
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:13,740
But with joy comes sorrow.

420
00:52:14,324 --> 00:52:18,870
If you are reading this, it means
I've been taken.

421
00:52:19,913 --> 00:52:21,790
And they will not be merciful.

422
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:29,631
But the dream you passed to me
is passed to new generations.

423
00:52:32,634 --> 00:52:38,098
I'm sorry for being a burden,
you have suffered so much already.

424
00:52:39,641 --> 00:52:44,980
This letter has the secret,
it seals our enemy's fate.

425
00:52:47,941 --> 00:52:49,901
Do what must be done.

426
00:52:51,737 --> 00:52:56,658
I pray for you, and for my daughter Pia

427
00:52:57,033 --> 00:52:59,578
and for all who fight for our people.

428
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:31,443
How did Jose do it?

429
00:53:31,526 --> 00:53:32,819
You're nosy.

430
00:53:32,903 --> 00:53:34,362
Just tell us.

431
00:53:37,282 --> 00:53:40,410
Okay, this is the fun part.

432
00:53:40,494 --> 00:53:42,245
You won't believe it.

433
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:46,291
As I told you, he was the boss's
right-hand man...

434
00:53:56,551 --> 00:53:58,136
How are you, Congressman?

435
00:53:58,261 --> 00:53:59,846
Good, everyone's here.

436
00:54:01,932 --> 00:54:03,266
Such generosity.

437
00:54:04,226 --> 00:54:06,311
Okay, let's make me Mayor.

438
00:54:07,854 --> 00:54:09,856
I love businessmen.

439
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,609
They've covered all my election costs.

440
00:54:13,401 --> 00:54:16,321
Maybe I'll even throw the police
a few bucks...

441
00:54:17,072 --> 00:54:18,615
No computer.

442
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:21,827
Everything in my little book.

443
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:24,913
Keep it safe.

444
00:54:30,836 --> 00:54:33,839
Thank you, for everything.

445
00:54:37,926 --> 00:54:39,970
You're welcome, boss.

446
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,359
Safe trip, Congressman.

447
00:55:17,173 --> 00:55:20,218
Oh my God, all this water.

448
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,389
The freezer's broken again.

449
00:55:25,056 --> 00:55:27,100
This one's a lost cause.

450
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:30,812
Let's chuck it out and get a new one.

451
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,680
What are you doing with the trash?

452
00:56:06,348 --> 00:56:07,849
Doing your job...

453
00:56:08,183 --> 00:56:11,519
How long is this fridge staying here?

454
00:56:12,187 --> 00:56:14,522
It'll be picked up in the morning.

455
00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:44,052
R$40 to take the fridge to my house?

456
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,346
Is it far?

457
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:49,015
I'll go with you.

458
00:56:49,557 --> 00:56:52,477
R$20 more to carry it upstairs.

459
00:57:03,738 --> 00:57:06,365
Jose, where you taking that junk?

460
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:07,659
Jose, where you taking that junk?
Home.

461
00:57:08,284 --> 00:57:10,328
I'll fill it with ice-cream
for my daughter.

462
00:57:37,355 --> 00:57:39,357
Was there something else?

463
00:57:40,692 --> 00:57:41,943
There was a photo...

464
00:57:42,235 --> 00:57:43,903
A photo with numbers.

465
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:46,573
Marco, I need my bible!

466
00:57:51,286 --> 00:57:52,327
Yes, Mr Clemente?

467
00:57:52,328 --> 00:57:54,164
Yes, Mr Clemente?
I need my bible.

468
00:57:54,789 --> 00:57:56,833
The visit is over.

469
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:59,753
She's come to help me.

470
00:57:59,836 --> 00:58:01,046
The boy has a message.

471
00:58:01,129 --> 00:58:02,630
I need to reply.

472
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:06,801
If I bring the bible now
things could get ugly for us.

473
00:58:07,177 --> 00:58:10,847
Ask them to come back tomorrow,
I'll give it to them then.

474
00:58:11,973 --> 00:58:13,600
It's too dangerous.

475
00:58:43,546 --> 00:58:45,465
Two identical bibles...

476
00:58:45,548 --> 00:58:47,300
It's how we sent messages.

477
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:49,469
Use mine...

478
00:58:49,552 --> 00:58:51,888
to find what Jose has hidden.

479
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:54,182
You have to find it.

480
00:58:54,891 --> 00:58:56,226
Help us.

481
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,121
We won't see each other again.

482
00:59:21,042 --> 00:59:23,086
But we'll be together forever.

483
00:59:32,428 --> 00:59:34,139
I spoke to Marco...

484
00:59:35,348 --> 00:59:38,393
He wants R$1000 for the bible.

485
00:59:49,404 --> 00:59:50,738
I think that's the code.

486
00:59:56,494 --> 00:59:57,704
The letter?

487
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:10,884
Why are you doing all this?

488
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:32,989
What do you think?

489
01:00:33,198 --> 01:00:35,074
I think she won't give us the money.

490
01:00:35,158 --> 01:00:37,118
Then we're screwed.

491
01:00:37,327 --> 01:00:38,536
Chill out, man.

492
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,163
Getting the money is easy.

493
01:00:40,538 --> 01:00:42,207
We got her to the prison...

494
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,292
Money will be easy.

495
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,920
Money is never easy.

496
01:00:56,346 --> 01:00:58,806
I think she wants to make a porno.

497
01:01:03,353 --> 01:01:06,731
Sorry, she wants to make a video,
but not a porno.

498
01:01:06,814 --> 01:01:10,902
We tell the wallet story and
she'll ask questions. Cool?

499
01:01:11,277 --> 01:01:13,238
Do I have to take my clothes off?

500
01:02:00,827 --> 01:02:05,123
While you were taking children
on fairground rides...

501
01:02:05,206 --> 01:02:07,667
a gringa and some trash boy
were with Clemente.

502
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:08,835
A boy of what age?

503
01:02:08,918 --> 01:02:09,711
Listen to me...

504
01:02:09,794 --> 01:02:11,421
I want my money.

505
01:02:11,504 --> 01:02:13,089
I want my book.

506
01:02:13,381 --> 01:02:16,050
I want you to tear that place down.

507
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:18,136
Tear the dump apart.

508
01:02:18,219 --> 01:02:20,054
Shut it down!

509
01:02:20,763 --> 01:02:22,682
Santos acts like a nice guy on TV...

510
01:02:23,224 --> 01:02:27,061
but leaves us without schools
and hospitals.

511
01:02:50,168 --> 01:02:51,586
Leave.

512
01:05:03,634 --> 01:05:05,261
There's something going on at the dump.

513
01:05:08,222 --> 01:05:09,056
Can you see anything?

514
01:05:09,182 --> 01:05:10,516
Hold on...

515
01:05:12,226 --> 01:05:13,519
Oh God!

516
01:05:15,396 --> 01:05:16,814
It's all gone.

517
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,979
We've got to go...the police did this.

518
01:05:57,063 --> 01:05:59,023
They'll find us.

519
01:06:03,194 --> 01:06:05,029
What did we do?

520
01:06:05,947 --> 01:06:07,823
I don't know.

521
01:06:12,578 --> 01:06:15,248
Let's get that bible, come on.

522
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:34,850
Our Father who art in heaven

523
01:06:35,268 --> 01:06:36,811
Hallowed be thy name...

524
01:06:37,812 --> 01:06:38,896
Stop it.

525
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,731
God has forgotten us.

526
01:06:40,815 --> 01:06:42,483
God looks after the poor.

527
01:06:43,985 --> 01:06:46,737
Will God give us money then?

528
01:06:54,745 --> 01:06:56,330
I'll meet you at the station.

529
01:07:16,601 --> 01:07:19,353
Let them in, let them all in.

530
01:07:19,437 --> 01:07:22,023
They've lost their homes.

531
01:07:51,052 --> 01:07:53,220
No, Jonathan, get out.

532
01:07:56,223 --> 01:07:58,559
We got no food, no medicine...

533
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:03,230
Where the hell is Olivia?

534
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:05,876
Here's the cash.

535
01:09:14,593 --> 01:09:17,138
So now we get the bible.

536
01:09:17,221 --> 01:09:18,597
Where did you get all this?

537
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:23,477
Will God forgive me?

538
01:09:39,618 --> 01:09:41,912
You get the bible from Marco.

539
01:09:41,996 --> 01:09:43,372
Give it to Rat...

540
01:09:45,624 --> 01:09:48,085
Rat gives it to me at the corner.

541
01:09:48,377 --> 01:09:50,171
I need some sleep.

542
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:52,339
You need to pay attention.

543
01:09:52,548 --> 01:09:54,258
I'm going to tell you again.

544
01:09:54,341 --> 01:09:55,676
Listen this time...

545
01:09:59,221 --> 01:10:01,557
Get the bible and give it to Rat.

546
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,684
Rat will be where they play cards.

547
01:10:09,815 --> 01:10:10,858
You brought the cash?

548
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:12,693
Where's my book?

549
01:10:12,818 --> 01:10:14,195
Give me the money first.

550
01:10:16,864 --> 01:10:19,658
Check the bible before you
give him the money.

551
01:10:19,742 --> 01:10:22,286
If it's wrong, don't pay him.

552
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:28,626
Good boy.

553
01:10:28,918 --> 01:10:30,419
Where did you get this?

554
01:10:31,629 --> 01:10:32,880
I did my thing.

555
01:10:34,173 --> 01:10:35,007
I get it.

556
01:10:37,635 --> 01:10:38,719
As promised...

557
01:10:40,387 --> 01:10:42,223
Your Grandpa's, right?

558
01:10:48,521 --> 01:10:51,232
Now you can take it back
to your friends.

559
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:55,903
I've got this, if he tries something.

560
01:10:56,487 --> 01:10:58,656
This will keep you safe in hell?

561
01:11:01,742 --> 01:11:03,077
What friends?

562
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,497
Come on cop, help!

563
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:10,835
Everything will be alright.

564
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:12,586
Nothing will go wrong.

565
01:11:51,041 --> 01:11:52,960
Throw it! Throw it!

566
01:11:53,544 --> 01:11:56,505
Nobody knows Rat.

567
01:11:57,172 --> 01:11:59,508
If he gets the bible, we're safe.

568
01:12:03,429 --> 01:12:04,763
Don't draw attention...

569
01:12:05,097 --> 01:12:06,557
and don't throw the bible.

570
01:12:09,143 --> 01:12:10,019
Are you blind?

571
01:12:16,358 --> 01:12:18,319
Rat is going to walk.

572
01:12:19,486 --> 01:12:21,405
Very, very slowly...

573
01:12:21,488 --> 01:12:22,573
Okay, I won't run.

574
01:12:37,713 --> 01:12:39,381
Suck it, bitches!

575
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,385
Into the favela!

576
01:13:26,387 --> 01:13:27,721
Don't shoot!

577
01:13:34,269 --> 01:13:35,896
Just have faith.

578
01:13:36,855 --> 01:13:38,399
Faith moves mountains.

579
01:13:40,275 --> 01:13:42,236
Fuck you, the bible's ours!

580
01:13:56,291 --> 01:13:58,127
Follow me, this way, this way!

581
01:13:58,585 --> 01:13:59,628
Shit, not that way!

582
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:01,630
I thought you knew this place?

583
01:14:01,714 --> 01:14:02,756
I do, let's go!

584
01:14:08,345 --> 01:14:10,180
It's just round the corner.

585
01:14:10,764 --> 01:14:11,807
Shit!

586
01:14:12,224 --> 01:14:13,308
What now?

587
01:14:13,934 --> 01:14:15,602
Can we get up?

588
01:14:16,812 --> 01:14:18,313
Do you have shit in your head?

589
01:14:18,397 --> 01:14:19,440
Calm down!

590
01:14:19,815 --> 01:14:21,316
You sure this is the right bible?

591
01:14:21,483 --> 01:14:22,860
Of course it's the right bible.

592
01:14:22,943 --> 01:14:23,902
Did you check it?

593
01:14:23,986 --> 01:14:25,195
When did I have time?

594
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:26,447
It's all in English!

595
01:14:28,032 --> 01:14:29,158
I'm a fucking genius!

596
01:14:29,283 --> 01:14:31,160
You're a fucking dick.

597
01:14:31,452 --> 01:14:32,745
A dick who just saved your butt.

598
01:14:32,828 --> 01:14:34,288
Still a dick.

599
01:14:40,502 --> 01:14:42,838
You must be kidding.

600
01:14:43,505 --> 01:14:45,632
This is hopeless.

601
01:14:45,841 --> 01:14:47,176
It's way too open.

602
01:14:47,259 --> 01:14:50,054
We're too exposed, anyone can see us!

603
01:14:50,512 --> 01:14:52,473
It's like we're on TV.

604
01:14:53,015 --> 01:14:54,183
What's the code?

605
01:14:54,683 --> 01:14:55,851
Something to do with...

606
01:14:56,643 --> 01:15:00,064
numbers and chapters.

607
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:02,483
I can't remember exactly.

608
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,610
He said it's easy.

609
01:15:05,778 --> 01:15:08,113
It's in English,
I don't understand a word.

610
01:15:09,531 --> 01:15:11,241
Do you read English?

611
01:15:11,325 --> 01:15:12,659
Leave me alone.

612
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:16,413
I don't get it!

613
01:15:16,497 --> 01:15:18,457
What the hell?

614
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:21,085
You two idiots!

615
01:15:21,293 --> 01:15:22,961
I'm getting something to eat.

616
01:15:26,924 --> 01:15:29,051
You two are nothing but trouble.

617
01:15:41,855 --> 01:15:44,066
Can you help me?

618
01:15:44,149 --> 01:15:45,567
Please.

619
01:15:50,405 --> 01:15:52,199
It'll be alright.

620
01:15:52,658 --> 01:15:55,619
Let's figure this thing out.

621
01:15:56,286 --> 01:15:57,913
Let's crack the code.

622
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,342
What's the first number?

623
01:16:10,717 --> 01:16:12,136
909

624
01:16:25,065 --> 01:16:27,442
It could be a page.

625
01:16:27,526 --> 01:16:28,443
Maybe.

626
01:16:28,569 --> 01:16:30,404
Next number?

627
01:16:30,737 --> 01:16:31,613
4

628
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,325
There are three 4s.

629
01:16:37,077 --> 01:16:40,247
Let's try this 4 here.

630
01:16:41,915 --> 01:16:44,042
Something like a psalm...

631
01:16:44,209 --> 01:16:46,461
Next number?

632
01:16:48,088 --> 01:16:50,757
Just one 3, must be this.

633
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,428
10?

634
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:56,805
There's no 10 here.

635
01:16:56,889 --> 01:16:58,307
Let me see it.

636
01:17:01,518 --> 01:17:03,228
I've got an idea.

637
01:17:05,022 --> 01:17:06,648
Damn, this is so hard.

638
01:17:06,773 --> 01:17:09,067
Try counting ten words on from 3.

639
01:17:20,537 --> 01:17:21,622
Cow!

640
01:17:22,998 --> 01:17:23,999
Next?

641
01:17:28,837 --> 01:17:32,841
Look, it's the same, Chapter 24.

642
01:17:35,302 --> 01:17:37,304
There's only one 9 here.

643
01:17:43,227 --> 01:17:44,061
Another animal.

644
01:17:44,144 --> 01:17:45,437
We're getting close.

645
01:18:07,626 --> 01:18:11,088
It's like the Animal Lottery.

646
01:18:12,256 --> 01:18:14,716
I need something to write with.

647
01:18:44,955 --> 01:18:47,165
Hey boy, you hungry?

648
01:18:47,249 --> 01:18:49,001
Looking for something tasty?

649
01:18:50,585 --> 01:18:51,962
I am.

650
01:18:57,259 --> 01:18:58,051
What's that?

651
01:18:59,845 --> 01:19:02,889
Just a party, come on, let's finish.

652
01:19:03,223 --> 01:19:05,183
That means the cops are here.

653
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:26,413
If it's the Animal Lottery, write down
the numbers.

654
01:20:28,725 --> 01:20:30,769
God, please help me.

655
01:20:45,409 --> 01:20:47,119
Must. Mean. Something.

656
01:20:58,046 --> 01:20:59,256
Come on!

657
01:21:00,215 --> 01:21:01,925
The cops are right behind me!

658
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:09,266
What's with the numbers?

659
01:21:09,349 --> 01:21:11,560
Whose phone number?

660
01:21:38,336 --> 01:21:39,588
You follow me this time.

661
01:21:40,881 --> 01:21:42,174
Take this.

662
01:21:44,259 --> 01:21:45,218
You hold it.

663
01:21:49,055 --> 01:21:50,765
Throw the bible!

664
01:21:54,895 --> 01:21:55,812
We need a phone!

665
01:22:25,383 --> 01:22:26,676
Jump! Jump!

666
01:22:28,053 --> 01:22:29,221
I can't.

667
01:22:29,429 --> 01:22:30,639
They'll shoot you!

668
01:23:04,089 --> 01:23:05,966
I thought I told you to leave.

669
01:23:08,301 --> 01:23:09,427
Can we use your phone?

670
01:23:09,511 --> 01:23:11,263
You're mad, you need to go.

671
01:23:11,346 --> 01:23:12,597
Come on.

672
01:23:25,193 --> 01:23:26,820
Give my friends a ride?

673
01:23:27,487 --> 01:23:29,322
The cops are after them.

674
01:23:29,656 --> 01:23:31,074
Fucking cops.

675
01:23:37,163 --> 01:23:39,040
Come on!

676
01:23:46,339 --> 01:23:47,465
Good luck!

677
01:24:20,248 --> 01:24:22,292
Watch out, he's here.

678
01:25:47,293 --> 01:25:49,879
Cemetery of St. Francis.

679
01:25:49,963 --> 01:25:53,299
Our hours are 9am to 6pm.

680
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:08,314
Where the hell are we going?

681
01:26:08,523 --> 01:26:10,066
Follow me.

682
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,051
What do we do now?

683
01:26:37,135 --> 01:26:38,344
Look for the money.

684
01:26:39,012 --> 01:26:41,055
Where the hell do we look?

685
01:26:41,723 --> 01:26:43,266
It could be anywhere.

686
01:26:43,349 --> 01:26:44,851
This place is huge.

687
01:26:45,977 --> 01:26:46,978
Let me think.

688
01:26:47,228 --> 01:26:48,396
It'll be in a grave.

689
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,690
Let's look, it'll say Jose Angelo.

690
01:26:50,774 --> 01:26:53,318
No point sitting around, let's go.

691
01:26:54,235 --> 01:26:56,070
Let's find Jose Angelo.

692
01:27:17,634 --> 01:27:18,927
Da Silva...

693
01:27:19,677 --> 01:27:20,929
No name...

694
01:27:22,972 --> 01:27:24,891
<i>Area 4, Grave 6</i>

695
01:27:31,481 --> 01:27:32,816
When I die...

696
01:27:33,399 --> 01:27:35,527
I want a house like this one...

697
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:37,612
Golden and full of naked women.

698
01:27:38,571 --> 01:27:39,948
And me inside.

699
01:27:40,406 --> 01:27:42,075
That'd be sweet.

700
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:59,717
That's terrible, you can't even rhyme!

701
01:29:24,177 --> 01:29:26,012
Pia Angelo.

702
01:29:30,224 --> 01:29:32,685
The light of our lives.

703
01:30:33,746 --> 01:30:35,957
What are you doing?

704
01:30:42,046 --> 01:30:43,172
Just looking.

705
01:30:45,258 --> 01:30:46,759
What's your name?

706
01:30:51,139 --> 01:30:51,973
And you?

707
01:31:00,481 --> 01:31:03,609
Well, if you're there...who's in here?

708
01:31:03,985 --> 01:31:05,111
I don't know.

709
01:31:06,446 --> 01:31:08,072
Why are you whispering?

710
01:31:08,156 --> 01:31:09,699
Because I'm hiding.

711
01:31:10,033 --> 01:31:12,160
He said I'd be safe here.

712
01:31:14,954 --> 01:31:16,581
Come talk to me.

713
01:31:17,123 --> 01:31:18,666
I'm a friend.

714
01:31:23,463 --> 01:31:26,007
You don't have to hide anymore.

715
01:31:30,803 --> 01:31:32,138
Let's just talk.

716
01:31:35,475 --> 01:31:38,186
I've been here a long time,
do you have any food?

717
01:31:38,269 --> 01:31:39,645
I can help you.

718
01:31:40,021 --> 01:31:41,689
What are you doing here?

719
01:31:41,773 --> 01:31:43,274
I'm waiting for my dad.

720
01:31:45,443 --> 01:31:46,444
Why?

721
01:31:47,487 --> 01:31:50,531
He told me that if anything
went wrong...

722
01:31:50,823 --> 01:31:53,034
I should meet him here.

723
01:31:53,117 --> 01:31:54,660
He said that?

724
01:31:55,536 --> 01:31:57,080
Do you know him?

725
01:31:58,998 --> 01:32:02,335
No, but I think he'd like you
to have this.

726
01:32:08,841 --> 01:32:09,717
Thank you.

727
01:32:10,176 --> 01:32:12,011
Wait here while I find my friends.

728
01:32:23,856 --> 01:32:25,316
The joke's over!

729
01:32:26,567 --> 01:32:28,194
Damn, where are they?

730
01:32:35,368 --> 01:32:35,951
Run! Run!

731
01:32:35,952 --> 01:32:37,328
Run! Run!
Where were you?

732
01:32:39,122 --> 01:32:40,998
Calm the fuck down!

733
01:32:44,752 --> 01:32:45,962
Have you found it?

734
01:33:06,482 --> 01:33:08,192
You shouldn't have told him.

735
01:33:12,196 --> 01:33:14,323
Some cockroaches just don't give up.

736
01:33:15,741 --> 01:33:18,828
You crush them, crush them...

737
01:33:22,498 --> 01:33:24,125
and the bastard just won't die.

738
01:33:27,128 --> 01:33:28,796
Let's get to work.

739
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:15,968
Pull it out.

740
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:32,777
Check it out.

741
01:34:33,903 --> 01:34:34,820
Go on.

742
01:34:42,578 --> 01:34:44,372
Here's your money.

743
01:34:45,998 --> 01:34:47,083
Put it back.

744
01:34:49,835 --> 01:34:51,837
See if there's a book in there.

745
01:35:40,386 --> 01:35:41,762
Santos.

746
01:35:43,222 --> 01:35:44,598
I found the book.

747
01:35:46,058 --> 01:35:47,226
But...

748
01:35:47,977 --> 01:35:49,061
the money's gone.

749
01:36:04,243 --> 01:36:05,828
Come on girl, this way!

750
01:36:09,206 --> 01:36:10,583
Raphael, kill him!

751
01:37:30,788 --> 01:37:32,415
What do we do now?

752
01:37:32,581 --> 01:37:33,874
Jump in.

753
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,501
It's all dirty.

754
01:37:36,419 --> 01:37:37,878
You get used to it.

755
01:37:39,213 --> 01:37:40,798
What now?

756
01:37:42,258 --> 01:37:43,551
We go home.

757
01:38:23,257 --> 01:38:24,884
Are we really doing this?

758
01:38:25,468 --> 01:38:27,052
Of course, let's blow their minds.

759
01:38:27,636 --> 01:38:28,679
You okay with it?

760
01:38:28,804 --> 01:38:30,723
Of course, it was my idea.

761
01:38:31,682 --> 01:38:33,434
Yeah, go start the revolution.

762
01:38:48,324 --> 01:38:50,284
We've got to be quick.

763
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:15,935
Who's there?

764
01:40:44,481 --> 01:40:46,191
What's up, bro?

765
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:49,194
I'm thanking God

766
01:40:50,154 --> 01:40:51,614
for being alive

767
01:40:54,533 --> 01:40:56,744
and for our victory.

768
01:40:57,161 --> 01:40:58,996
For our victory.

769
01:42:31,547 --> 01:42:33,924
We need a ride!

770
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:39,972
What's the rush?

771
01:42:40,055 --> 01:42:41,557
We've got a long trip.

772
01:43:04,371 --> 01:43:06,290
Have you heard?

773
01:43:08,333 --> 01:43:11,336
Father, tell her about the miracle.

774
01:44:05,808 --> 01:44:08,143
When you watch this video...

775
01:44:08,769 --> 01:44:10,395
I'll probably be dead.

776
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:12,731
The police are after me...

777
01:44:14,024 --> 01:44:18,111
Santos is corrupt,
but he won't get away with it...

778
01:44:18,195 --> 01:44:20,364
If something bad happens to us

779
01:44:20,447 --> 01:44:22,908
I hope you know it was
Santos who did it.

780
01:46:02,215 --> 01:46:04,509
Municipal Water Supply...

781
01:46:13,393 --> 01:46:16,355
Eternal Construction Company...

782
01:46:22,194 --> 01:46:24,154
Universal Church...

783
01:47:06,279 --> 01:47:08,240
Get out on the streets.

784
01:47:08,323 --> 01:47:10,033
Let's fight for our rights.

785
01:47:10,117 --> 01:47:14,246
If not, I'm scared Brazil will
keep on going down...

786
01:47:14,830 --> 01:47:20,252
We're all human beings so everybody
should be treated the same.

787
01:47:20,877 --> 01:47:23,547
We need to think about that a lot more.

788
01:47:23,755 --> 01:47:26,967
The day people take the streets,
you can be sure...

789
01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:28,760
believe me...

790
01:47:29,261 --> 01:47:31,596
nobody will stop us.

791
01:48:17,517 --> 01:48:19,686
Where are they?

792
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:17,920
