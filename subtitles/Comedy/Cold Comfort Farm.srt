I've always found your choice

Yes. What do

Ugh! Horrid.

all the London relatives
seemed to enjoy it no end.

Did any of them ask you
to go and live with them?
I meant to warn you.

Relatives at funerals
always do that.
Not me.

Of course you can stay here

Surely no one can
object to that.

586
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:22,474
Aye, ye fornicators.
Fornicators!

587
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:27,916
[ Stammering ]
No, I assure you, Miss Poste
and I are just old friends.

588
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:31,045
- We met in London.
- Oh, aye, the devil's city.

589
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,784
The stinkin' pit of whoredom.
Come on, young lady.

590
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,985
It's back to Cold Comfort
for you!

591
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:50,469
Ye'll fritter and fry.
Ye didn't even stay
to hear the Lord's Word.

592
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:54,341
I was overwhelmed, Cousin.
You're such a powerful preacher.

593
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:57,778
Aye, the Word
burns in me mouth,

594
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:01,079
and I must blow it
on the whole world
like fames.

595
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:06,555
You ought to do it
more widely, Cousin Amos.
What do ye mean?

596
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:10,059
You shouldn't waste it
on a few miserable sinners
in Beershorn.

597
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:13,893
You could go round the country
in a Ford van preaching
on market days.

598
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,694
'Twould be exalting meself
and puffin' meself up...

599
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,463
if I went around
in one of they vans.

600
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,835
Thinkin' of my glory
'stead of the Lord's.

601
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:27,138
You could save
thousands of souls.
That's how I'd look at it...

602
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:30,044
if I were going
round the country
in a Ford van.

603
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:35,448
What kind of Ford van?

604
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:59,108
Has she been askin' about
me, Robert Poste's child?
What does she want?

605
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:02,509
She's been here more than
a week. She keeps askin'
to see you, Mother.

606
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,604
Couldn't you come down
just once and talk to her?

607
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:09,948
You know I never come down
except for the countin',
not after what happened to me.

608
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,080
She's Robert Poste's child.
She has her rights.

609
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:16,319
Saw something nasty
in the woodshed.

610
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,793
I never spoke of it,
not even to Mama.

611
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:24,129
But I've always remembered it
every day of my life.
It's made me the way I am.

612
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:27,898
Yes, Mother.
It's the farm
she wants, isn't it?

613
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:31,236
She's your sister's
grandchild. She's owed--
She's owed nothin:

614
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:35,540
She should never have come here.
She's playin' her wiles
on all of you.

615
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:39,378
I've watched her.
Reuben, Seth, now Amos.

616
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:42,907
I'm not havin' it, girl.
There've always been
Starkadders...

617
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:46,285
at Cold Comfort Farm.
At Cold Comfort Farm. Yes,
Mother, don't upset yourself.

618
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:49,883
Starkadders!
Always were,
always will be.

619
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,556
Tell her, girl. Tell her!
Hear what I said?
Starkadders!

620
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:26,252
Adam, you're not using that
nice dish mop I bought you
for the clettering.

621
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:31,989
Nay. I'd never put that
pretty in gurt-greasy
washing-up water.

622
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:35,998
I mun do that
with thorn twigs.
They'll serve.

623
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:41,403
'Tis prettier
than apple bloom,
my little mop.

624
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,434
Is something wrong, Adam?

625
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:50,537
'Tis my little wennit.
What's the matter
with her?

626
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:53,606
She's always peerin' through
the windows up Howchiker Hall...

627
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:56,811
to get a sight of that young
chuck-stubbard Master Richard.

628
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:00,220
Dick Hawk-Monitor?
Arr!
Blast him...

629
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,123
for a setup yearlin'
of a womanizer.

630
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,320
Oh, I hear
he's nice enough.

631
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,364
You knows the ways
of gentry.

632
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:13,369
Him the young squire
and her just a little
wennit out of nature.

633
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:16,463
Indeed I do know
the ways of gentry.

634
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,872
I'm sure he means no harm.

635
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:22,537
The problem is, Elfine's
not quite the sort gentry marry.

636
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:26,446
'Tis what I mean.
Leave it to me, Adam.
I'll talk to her.

637
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,051
Poor little wennit.

638
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:36,490
Sister Sun
and Brother Wind,

639
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,018
dancin' through
the woodland trees,

640
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,861
this little ode
to you I sing...

641
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,401
and whisper it
upon the breeze.

642
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:48,700
Really, Elfine, don't you
think you sometimes
overdo it a bit?

643
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,434
Overdo what?
This will-o'-the-wisp thing.

644
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:53,442
Who encouraged you
to be like that?

645
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,876
Miss Ashford from
the Arts and Crafts Shop
in Beershorn.

646
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:59,279
She was so kind to me.
She taught me such a lot:

647
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:02,876
how to dress,
how to speak beautifully.

648
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,421
And she had
such lovely things.

649
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,423
And she made you
read poetry.
Mmm.

650
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,892
Write it, too, probably.
Yes. I'm going to publish
a volume when I'm 50.

651
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,930
Oh. And that's why
you have to be alone on
the hillsides, is it?

652
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:17,865
Yes. It's where I can be
with my poetry and my dreams.

653
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:23,705
Anyway, I can't stand
the farm another minute.
Why not?

654
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,833
Urk, of course.
He's horrible.

655
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:30,437
He's always in the tree
outside my window,
spying on me.

656
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:34,746
Mmm.
Grandma Doom says I'm promised
to marry him when I'm 18.

657
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,753
Oh, no! Why?
Because he's
a Starkadder.

658
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,917
And there have always
been Starkadders at
Cold Comfort Farm.

659
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,517
But there's someone else,
isn't there?

660
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:47,893
How did you know?
There always is.

661
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:51,491
Dick Hawk-Monitor
at the Hall? Yes?

662
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:55,664
Are you engaged
to him?
Engaged? No.

663
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,299
No, it's--
It's too binding.

664
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,674
Mmm.
Don't you think it's horrible
to bind someone down?

665
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:07,411
I see. So he doesn't
want to marry you.

666
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,453
Oh, I think he does
sometimes,

667
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,511
but he's got this London
cousin called Pamela.

668
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:16,320
It's his 21st birthday
party next month. They're
bound to get engaged then.

669
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:19,487
Next month?
Well, then,
it's quite simple.

670
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:22,054
You must go to this party
and win him over.

671
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:26,191
I can't go to the party.
Grandma Doom doesn't let us
accept invitations.

672
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,999
Only to funerals and
the churchin' of women.

673
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:33,532
Look! There he is!
Isn't he fine?

674
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,773
[ Flora ]
Yes. He should
suit you very nicely.

675
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:39,246
Would you like me
to help you?

676
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:03,900
Reuben.
Miss Poste.

677
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,076
Goin' to church again
with the old devil?
No.

678
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:12,911
I was advising Cousin Amos
to address his sermons
to a wider audience.

679
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,611
Wants to frighten the birds
off the trees, does he?

680
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,916
Think about it, Reuben.
If he were away preaching,

681
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,321
someone else would need
to take charge of the farm.

682
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:24,554
And so I'll have to one day,
when the old devil dies.

683
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,721
But he talks of
leaving it to Adam.

684
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:30,095
Wouldn't it be better if
whoever took charge got
a real grip on things...

685
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:34,694
so when Cousin Amos came
back, he could see it ought
to be left to that person?

686
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,501
Oh, I get it.
Meaning you.

687
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:42,978
No, Reuben, I've told you
before, I don't want the farm.
Meanin' who, then?

688
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,776
Meaning you, Reuben.

689
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,511
Who, me?
Aye, thee.

690
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,154
Ah, 'tis impossible.

691
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,690
Aunt Ada'll
never let him go.

692
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,892
If anyone talks o' leavin',
she has an attack.

693
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,797
She's ill.
How does it show?

694
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,062
Oh, has to know
everythin' as goes on.

695
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,367
Has to see the milk book,
chicken book, cow book.

696
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,634
We keeps back the books,
she has an attack.

697
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:14,575
We ask for pocket money,
she has an attack.

698
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,078
Anyone wants to wed,
she has an attack.

699
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,513
Anyone want to leave
Cold Comfort--

700
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,557
She ain't like
other people's grandmothers.

701
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:34,995
She's mad, and that's all.

702
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:40,503
I see. Well, just because
Aunt Ada is mad,

703
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:44,370
that's no reason why you
shouldn't persuade Amos
to go on his preaching tour.

704
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,071
Dang me if it don't.

705
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,026
Aunt Ada, isn't it
time we talked?

706
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,467
I saw something nasty.
Saw something nasty!

707

Something nasty
in the woodshed.

708

Go away, girl!
[ Sighs ]

709

How long have you been
in there, Aunt Ada?

710
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,873
Ever since my Judith
married Amos.

711
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:30,442
Isn't it lonely?
Lonely?

712
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:35,082
I saw something nasty
in the woodshed.
Did you? What?

713
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:38,457
I don't remember anymore.
I was little.

714
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:42,062
Something terrible!

715
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:45,295
And it was in the woodshed?
Are you sure?

716
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:47,302
Course I'm sure.

717
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:54,803
Or maybe the potting shed.
Or the bicycle shed.

718
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,937
Or the tool shed.

719
00:56:57,013 --> 00:57:00,642
All these years,
getting five good meals a day,

720

running the farm,
ruling the roost,
everyone doing...

721
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,183
exactly as you say
and sacrificing their lives
to yours?

722
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:11,956
That's not bad, is it,
just for seeing something nasty
in the woodshed?

723
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:14,997
Everything depends on me.

Where's Seth?

Dang Seth!
Come on!
All right!

731
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,596
Somethin' to do
with you, isn't it?
Why me, Urk?

732
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:57,640
I know you're tryin'
to take Elfine away from me.
She's mine.

733
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:01,143
She were promised me
the day she was born.
You heed what I say.

734
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:03,941
[ Amos ] Urk!
When the water-voles
mate this summer, she be mine.

735
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:06,481
Better hurry, Urk.

00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,992
Whoa.

742
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:17,485
Voila.
No, no. Low here?

[ Murmuring ]
[ Murmuring In French ]

[ Mary ]
Oh, that's lovely.
Yes, that's it.

745
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,392
You happy, darling?
Yes, I think that's sweet.

746

Right here.
[ Murmuring ]

00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,495
Round neck,
I think.

748
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:38,200
[ Mary ]
Yes, I think a small train.
And then somewhere here,

749
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,435
we're needing a bit
of uplift, I think.

750
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:48,280
Here we have a prime example
of Ecole de Paris painting.
He's also very keen...

751
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:52,549
on the whole calligraphic
effect of his painting,
the very linear quality of it.

752
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:54,556
Always with his work,
you find--

753
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,489

do you think?
No, please, look at this.

Very good. Very clever.

[ Cork Popping ]

756

That's for you.
Oh, thank you.

757
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:22,446
I think she's charming.
Wait 'til
we've finished.

758
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:24,952
Do you like
your new dress, Elfine?
Oh, it's heavenly.

759
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:28,354
It's white satin,
straight lines.
Better than poetry?

760
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,984
Do explain to her
about poetry, Mary.

761
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,518
Do I gather that you
love poetry and think
that if you talk about it...

762
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:37,191
to a young man like
Dick Hawk-Monitor,
he'll be pleased?

763
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:41,134
- Everybody loves poetry.
- [ Mary ] Most decent young
men are totally alarmed...

764
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:44,662
when they hear that
a girl reads it,
let alone writes it.

765
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:47,972
Tell her, Charles.
Dick Hawk - Monitor's
a perfectly nice chap.

766
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:51,502
- You know him?
- Of course. And his mother.
Rather well, actually.

767
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,515
But poetry and Dick--

768
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:57,212
No, quite frankly.
In fact, when
poetry's combined...

769
01:00:57,286 --> 01:01:00,983
with ill-groomed hair
and eccentric dress,
it's generally fatal.

770
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:04,185
You're very lucky, Elfine.
He must have seen
your finer points.

771
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,752
I shall write it
secretly then.
Quite right.

772
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:13,029
It's bad to be dewy-eyed
among smart people, but you can
always secretly despise them.

773
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:17,436
You see, Elfine, we tell you
these things so you'll have
some standards inside yourself,

774
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,102
now you're going to meet
a new kind of life.

Everything arranged, Charles?
Absolutely.

What's arranged?
[ Flora ]
Never mind.

Who's this man Mybug?

Oh, just a strange
Lawrentian person who
says he's in love with me.

[ Mary ]
Jealous, Charles?

Good.
Enjoying yourself,

Oh, it's going to be
such fun.
No, it's going to be...

783
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:53,299
''amusing'' or ''diverting,''
not ''such fun,'' darling.

784

Hi there, Flora Poste.

Yeah, I few
into the Savoy
this morning.

What do I do?

Imagine the night sky.
What do you see?

- Clouds?
- You see stars.

And what you see up there,
I spot down here.

Afraid not, Mrs. Hawk-Monitor.

Oh, what a shame, Miss Poste.
We haven't seen anything of you.
Where are you staying?

What have you got
time for, Seth?

Never mind. We're all
purified by suffering.

857
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:09,276
He's so obnoxious. I haven't
the heart to tell him that's
why I won't let him kiss me.

858

He thinks I'm inhibited.
I'm not, of course.
I'm not obnoxious.
