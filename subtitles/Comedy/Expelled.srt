1
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,422
Welcome back, Felix.

2
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,891
It's good to be back, Gary.

3
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,626
It says here that you've had two suspensions

4
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,461
in the last semester.

5
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:44,830
Oh, that can't be right.
I thought that was three.

6
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:45,898
Two, Felix.

7
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,766
Two suspensions.

8
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,434
The first was in September

9
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,603
for rewiring the cheerleaders fund-raiser money

10
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,705
to a koala bear sanctuary.

11
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,910
Noble cause, don't you think?

12
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:00,312
I think you owe an apology to a dozen cheerleaders.

13
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,714
I think there are two dozen koalas

14
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,415
that would disagree with that, Gary.

15
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,417
And then again, in October

16
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,486
for programming the gym scoreboard

17
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:10,189
to display an indecent photo
of Mrs. Jensen.

18
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,526
Whoo!

19
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,328
I think I did everyone a favor with that one.

20
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,363
I'm not gonna play games with you, Felix.

21
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,831
Two suspensions in a single semester

22
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,533
is unheard of here at Eastwood.

23
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,468
Mr. Truman, I understand

24
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,938
I'm... I'm not what you'd consider
an exemplary student.

25
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,839
But I believe I play a pivotal role

26
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,341
in the operations of this school.

27
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,677
If I wasn't here to test the rules,

28
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:34,279
how would the other students even know they existed?

29
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,682
Today I was told

30
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,717
that you hacked the vending machines

31
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,452
to give out free gum to students.

32
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:41,920
Is that true?

33
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,655
Gum?

34
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,857
Are you trying to get expelled?

35
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,694
And deny you the pleasure of my company?

36
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:54,833
I'm expelling you, Felix.

37
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,568
That's it.

38
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,804
Wait. Seriously?

39
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,806
That was your third strike.

40
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:04,243
- So that means I-I can't come
to class anymore?

41
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,412
Oh, you'll never set foot in the school again.

42
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,449
Gary...

43
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,351
I don't know how to thank you.

44
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,461
Incredible.

45
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,463
I spent my whole school career trying to ditch class,

46
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:27,466
and they punish me by giving me an early retirement.

47
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,735
Right now Mr. Truman
is about to call my mom

48
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,098
to let her know about my expulsion.

49
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,043
I can't let that happen.

50
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:40,912
Oh! Oh!

51
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,718
On average, an Eastwood High fire drills take 11 minutes.

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,454
I only need 10.

53
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,058
Yo, Felix!

54
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,027
Danny boy. What's up, buddy?

55
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,695
You pulled the fire alarm again?

56
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,563
Of course. Did I get you out
of that trig test?

57
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,965
You got me out of the trig test.

58
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,867
- Timed it perfectly.
- Yeah.

59
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,468
Yo, I heard you got suspended.

60
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,304
Nope, expelled.

61
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,672
- Whoa, what? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

62
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,040
Dude, your parents are gonna kill you.

63
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,742
Only if they find out, and they won't.

64
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,312
- What makes you say that?
- We'll talk soon.

65
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,747
I got a take an important call
in eight and a half minutes.

66
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,350
You're insane!

67
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,861
I programmed my mom's phone

68
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,863
to forward her calls to my Skype account.

69
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,965
When Mr. Truman calls,
I'll just...

70
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,337
Excuse me. I got to take this.

71
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,475
Hello?

72
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,043
Expelled?

73
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,812
Expelled, Mrs. O'Neil.

74
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,747
We have a three-strike policy
here at Eastwood,

75
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,716
and that was his third strike.

76
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:53,485
What are we gonna do with him?

77
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,053
What are we gonna do with him?

78
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,688
Who, me?

79
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,056
No, not you.

80
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,691
Ben.

81
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,560
What happened?
I thought he was improving.

82
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,562
His grades are getting worse.

83
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,665
Last year, my brother, Ben, forged a report card.

84
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,367
When my parents found out, they sent him

85
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,535
to the Mountain disciplinary academy.

86
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,671
Located in the foot hills of Montana,

87
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,840
it's more of a jail than a school.

88
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,475
There's bar on windows,

89
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:17,943
wardens instead of teachers.

90
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:21,680
I heard it smells like butthole.

91
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,716
He got a 1.7 gpa.

92
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,885
Unbelievable.

93
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,154
What about you, Felix?
How are things at school?

94
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,623
Things are great.
I aced my trig test.

95
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,724
There you go.

96
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,559
Wow. Great job, kiddo.

97
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,428
Yep. Studied for it all week.

98
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,096
- I like to hear that.
- Yes.

99
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,867
Diane says the report cards are coming out in a few days.

100
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:46,538
Mm, and what kind of grades can we expect to see?

101
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,173
Lots of "A"s.

102
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,643
Aw.

103
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,179
Looks like I'm gonna need a new report card.

104
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,087
Getting a decent report card here at Eastwood

105
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,822
is pretty difficult...

106
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,425
Slightly more difficult when you've been expelled.

107
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:07,659
There are only seven people

108
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,528
with the power to print a report card.

109
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,630
Just one of them is a student.

110
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,098
She's Mr. Truman's t.A.

111
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,568
She also happens to be my bitter ex-girlfriend.

112
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,971
Someone's coming.

113
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,040
I do not have time to talk to you.

114
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,909
You haven't heard what I want talk about.

115
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,745
Now we've already talked more than I wanted.

116
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:27,979
I need a report card.

117
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,615
Then I suggest going back to school,

118
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,484
preferably somewhere far from here.

119
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:33,685
Ouch.

120
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,487
Or you could just print one for me.

121
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,622
No.

122
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,025
Um, weren't you expelled?

123
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,494
Um, yeah.

124
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,196
Can you please go?

125
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:47,466
- Any reason you keep covering
Stacy's anti-bullying postings?

126
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,901
- I want to win.
- I can help with that.

127
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,003
I don't think so.

128
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,772
Oh, come on.

129
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,240
We both know I can.

130
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,809
Vanessa, don't. He's trouble.

131
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,679
Can you finish this for me?

132
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,215
Sure.

133
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,784
Bye.

134
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:11,656
So Stacy's favored to win this thing.

135
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,758
Yeah, I figured.

136
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,060
So how do I beat her?

137
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,629
Oh, it's actually really simple.

138
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,097
Just hand out cute little marshmallows

139
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,099
- with your name on them.
- Do I need to slap you?

140
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,534
Hey, guys?

141
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,135
Could you possibly get off the stairs?

142
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,737
You're in the shot.

143
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,273
It blows my mind that people like her so much.

144
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,108
Hey, hey, come over here.

145
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,177
I'll interview you for my bullying segment.

146
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,079
I want you to end her.

147
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,814
That can be arranged.

148
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,249
Can you get me my report card?

149
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,684
Yes, I can get you a report card.

150
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,787
Great. I'll take
straight "A"s, please.

151
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,823
Do you have the slightest clue as to how much work

152
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,725
goes into getting straight "A"s?

153
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,527
Mm... don't care.

154
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,928
I'll take straight "A"s, please.

155
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,664
Done. What's the plan?

156
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,666
All it takes is a single tweet.

157
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,967
Roxy?

158
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,202
Roxy.

159
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,671
Meet Roxy.

160
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:03,542
Roxy is infamous for ruining the lives of students

161
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,010
with vicious rumors.

162
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:08,179
I am no exception.

163
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,216
"Leave it to Felix O'Neil to creep on the girl's bathroom

164
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,651
"through a hole on the ceiling.

165
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:15,720
"Peepingtom."

166
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,123
It all happened when Vanessa
and I were dating freshman year.

167
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,559
After school, I tried to break into the library

168
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,728
to borrow a new p.C.

169
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,765
Aah!

170
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,135
This isn't the boys' bathroom.

171
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:34,039
A single tweet caused the bitter end

172
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:38,743
of my sweet, sweet relationship with Vanessa.

173
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,062
Danny!

174
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,264
What are you doing here?

175
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,366
I need help with something.

176
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,101
Seriously, though,

177
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,803
where the hell did you just come from?

178
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,037
The window.

179
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,974
You scared me half to death, man.

180
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,076
- Oh!
- I apologize.

181
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,345
I need you to help me hack into Roxy.

182
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,246
And I need you to shut your mouth.

183
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,848
How's that? Cool.

184
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,783
Is there a problem here?

185
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,953
Uh, yeah, there is a problem.

186
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,655
I don't like hacking into things

187
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:26,257
that can tweet my social life out of existence.

188
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,126
No. Yeah, yeah,
but that's the thing.

189
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,763
If we had Roxy's password, we could control the tweets.

190
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,132
Go on.

191
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,802
We could delete them or...

192
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,171
Post them.

193
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,775
We can post them?

194
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,344
I mean, I guess it wouldn't hurt to just get the password.

195
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,780
Yes, exactly!
Do your thing, man.

196
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,649
Do your thing.

197
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,171
How's it coming?

198
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,242
You may want to sit down for this.

199
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,212
Password acquired.

200
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,415
And I also found
Roxy's I.P. Address.

201
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,183
You got the I.P. Address?
How?

202
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,718
Worked a little bit of my magic

203
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,986
and found a back door into Twitter.

204
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,220
- Are you kidding?
- Nope.

205
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,457
Nearly pooped my pants from excitement.

206
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,893
I know Roxy's true identity.

207
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,194
Shut up and show me.

208
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,133
Holy...

209
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,269
Crap.

210
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:48,440
I heard it said that bullying creates bullies...

211
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,241
A vicious cycle that will continue

212
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:53,011
until someone makes a stand against it.

213
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,081
I am here to make that stand.

214
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,816
When you vote today,

215
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:01,286
remember I am here to make
Eastwood High bully-free.

216
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,723
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

217
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,291
Vote Stacy.

218
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,226
These people need to know the truth.

219
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,728
We need to expose her.

220
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,730
Let's just beat her to death.

221
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,364
She'll lose the race if she is exposed.

222
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,200
She'll lose the race if we beat her to death.

223
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,936
Vanessa, would you relax a little bit?

224
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,004
Fine. How do we expose her?

225
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,273
With this.

226
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,476
We put a video on there with all of the information

227
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,878
linking Stacy to Roxy.

228
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,947
We're gonna patch into the school's TV system.

229
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,182
Then we're gonna broadcast it live to the entire school

230
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,751
during the video announcements.

231
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,819
Excuse me.

232
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,488
What the hell are you doing here?

233
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,089
Hi, Gary.

234
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,858
What do I have to do to get through to you?

235
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,226
Do I need to call the police?

236
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,094
I don't think that'll be necessary.

237
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,063
What are you planning to do with this, huh?

238
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,397
Uh, that's just a school project

239
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,799
that I've been working on.

240
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,200
Yeah, another one of your pranks?

241
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,970
- No, I just...
- Listen to me very carefully.

242
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,105
If I see you on my campus again,

243
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,406
I'll have you in handcuffs

244
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,443
in front of all your little friends.

245
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,012
Do you understand?

246
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,854
- Sure.
- Leave...

247
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,856
Now.

248
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,062
We need another copy of that
video before the announcements.

249
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,564
It's impossible.

250
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:22,167
It would take hours to run home and render a new one.

251
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,501
There's just not enough time.

252
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,970
But the student body votes today.

253
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,205
Yeah.

254
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,440
I think you're boned.

255
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,176
And that solves the mystery

256
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,944
of our faulty fire-alarm system.

257
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:36,214
Up next, an anti-bullying
segment from Stacy Richards.

258
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,216
At Eastwood High there is one bully

259
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,352
that has caused more torment
than any other... Roxy.

260
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,454
If I'm elected, I will stop at nothing

261
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,824
to bring Roxy to justice.

262
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,826
I can help with that.

263
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,994
Good morning, Eastwood High.

264
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,363
It is my genuine pleasure to reveal the true identity

265
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,399
of the anonymous cyber bully, known as...

266
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,267
Roxy.

267
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,536
He must've patched into the system.

268
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,305
But how did he get on TV?

269
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,106
He's doing it live.

270
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:05,243
And basically, I'm gonna screw her.

271
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,512
- What the hell is this?
- Shh.

272
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,348
Behind me is Roxy's I.P. address,

273
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,217
which I acquired by a brute-force hacking

274
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,852
of the Twitter account.

275
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,486
If Stacy Richards is truly searching for Roxy,

276
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,589
she doesn't have to search very far.

277
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:21,593
He's in the cheerleaders' closet.

278
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,429
This is Stacy Richards'
I.P. Address...

279
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:27,165
A perfect match with the one associated with...

280
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,466
Roxy!

281
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,274
Open it.

282
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,010
Oh, for the love of God, come on!

283
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,383
Oh!

284
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,655
Aah!

285
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,271
So here it is, folks...

286
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,307
Straight "A"s, courtesy of my girl Vanessa.

287
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,513
What you got there?

288
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,548
Are those your grades?

289
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,584
Uh...

290
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,186
Nope, it's Vanessa's death certificate.

291
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,488
Felix.

292
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,189
Are those your grades?

293
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,992
Uh...

294
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:31,029
Felix!

295
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,330
Hey!

296
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,133
Hey, mister, you just don't take off.

297
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,535
I probably could've handled that better,

298
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,170
but one thing is certain,

299
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,372
my parents must never see that report card,

300
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,974
for if they do,

301
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:46,210
they'll simultaneously crap their pants.

302
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,349
Oh!

303
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,217
Most parents would consider disowning you

304
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,485
for an "f" on your report card.

305
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,487
Seven "f" s is a different story.

306
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,990
That right there is a death sentence.

307
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,535
What is this?

308
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:12,537
- It's your report card, silly.
- Funny.

309
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,706
I distinctly remember asking for straight "A"s.

310
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,507
Those appear to be "f" s.

311
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,243
Hmm, looks like you got the report card you deserve.

312
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,045
This is what I deserve for helping you?

313
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,747
You've never worked for anything in your life,

314
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:23,982
have you, Felix?

315
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,650
What are you talking about?

316
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,119
You can't expect to walk out of here in the top percentile

317
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,654
without ever applying yourself.

318
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,622
I'm not gonna help you cheat your way to the top.

319
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,291
Are you insane?

320
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,126
I helped you cheat your way into the presidency.

321
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,761
I earned that presidency.

322
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,397
I've been working towards it for the last three years.

323
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,399
Do you have any idea how hard I worked?

324
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,235
I'm gonna give you five minutes to fix my report card.

325
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,139
- Fix it!
- Or what?

326
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,574
What's gonna happen if I don't?

327
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,743
Use your imagination.

328
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,711
Two minutes to curtain.

329
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,115
So how do you want to play this?

330
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,550
Excuse me.
I have a play to star in,

331
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,419
but good luck with the report card.

332
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,188
I'm sure your parents will be really proud.

333
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,029
Anyone can be a jerk,

334
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,664
but Vanessa makes it in art form.

335
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,333
She's a rare breed,

00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,168
an innovator.

337
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,571

Hey, guys.

358
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,526
Where were you?

359
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,427
- I was at school.
- "At school"?

360
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,629
Why?

361
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:25,930
What's going on, Felix?

362
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,732
I was...

363
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,468
Gonna explain that to you.

364
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,605
What is this?

365
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,874
The school play... I'm in it.

366
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:40,578
You never told me about a school play.

367
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,946
Yeah, the premiere was tonight,

368
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:45,249
and I totally forgot.

369
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,185
And...

370
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,354
That's why you ran off like you did before?

371
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,256
That is correct.

372
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,258
So...

373
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,762
What character were you playing?

374
00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:00,865
The clown...

375
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,333
Wizard.

376
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,769
"The clown wizard"?

377
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,571
Yeah, people love me.

378
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,508
"Musical"?

379
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,376
I didn't know you could sing.

380
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,844
Yeah, I do.

381
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,847
- I do sing a little.
- Yeah, well...

382
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:21,319
Sing us something.
Sing us something from the play.

383
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,921
- Well, I-I don't...
I don't... I can't...

384
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,224
Yeah, this just doesn't make any sense.

385
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,526
♪ I am the wizard ♪

386
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:33,331
♪ A clown wizard ♪

387
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,509
- Hey, honey.
- Good morning, mom.

388
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,745
Listen...

389
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,716
It was unfair of me to be like that last night.

390
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,551
- I'm sorry.
- It's cool, mom.

391
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,854
Don't worry about it.
I understand.

392
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:01,025
I am just anxious to see your grades, that's all.

393
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,994
There's really nothing to be anxious about.

394
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,829
They just haven't sent them out yet.

395
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:07,431
Maybe yours were sent to the wrong address.

396
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,400
Possibly.

397
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,502
I should talk to someone over there.

398
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,870
- No.
- I'll take you to school.

399
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,338
No, it's fine.
I'll just ride my bike.

400
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,606
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

401
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,409
I need the exercise anyways.

402
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:22,280
- Have a good day.
- Will do, daddy-o.

403
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,649
- And don't be late.
- Impossible!

404
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,623
Ever had a snow day?

405
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,391
Pretty cool, right?

406
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,592
You get the whole day off

407
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,662
because of some wretched weather.

408
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,032
Being expelled is kind of like that...

409
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,105
Except the weather's awesome.

410
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,910
Your life is a never-ending series

411
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:29,914
of missed opportunities.

412
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:34,852
At any given moment, you are
completely surrounded by them.

413
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,923
You just got to know where to look.

414
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,997
This room, for example...

415
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,799
What do you see?

416
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,067
Anything?

417
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,536
Time's up.

418
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,505
Here's what you might've missed...

419
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:57,641
$4.67 under
the couch cushion...

420
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,712
Decorative boomerang bought by my dad,

421
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,981
never been thrown a single time...

422
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,850
Shame.

423
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,685
You think this is just for blowing leaves?

424
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,522
Think again!

425
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:20,398
Opportunities...
They're all around you...

426
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,401
Unless you're in history class.

427
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,838
- Hey, there.
- Hi.

428
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,640
Nice robe.

429
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,642
Thank you.

430
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:06,577
It's, uh, $18.50.

431
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,546
One second.

432
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:10,881
Um...

433
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,650
You look familiar.

434
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:13,851
Do you go to Eastwood?

435
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:15,553
Yeah, I used to...

436
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,054
Till I got expelled.

437
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,590
That's right...
For the pranks.

438
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:21,759
I liked your work with the koala bears.

439
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:23,160
Thank you.

440
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,729
Uh, it's $18.50.

441
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,965
You think you could help me get that down?

442
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,000
Um...

443
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:33,037
That depends on how much you're gonna tip me.

444
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,107
Does $4.67 tickle your fancy?

445
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:44,148
Almost... it's about a foot
to the left.

446
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,649
Come on, you got it.

447
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,218
Really? Am I almost there?

448
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,487
Yeah, almost there.
Just jump... jump a little higher.

449
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,522
Oh!

450
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:53,190
- You almost hit me.
- I did?

451
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,892
Good.

452
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:56,894
Oh, that was so close.

453
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,529
You got this.

454
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:00,498
One more, one more, one more.
Wait. It's fine.

455
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,665
Go ahead.

456
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,900
Yes!

457
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:04,802
Oh!

458
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,537
Well...

459
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:07,771
There goes your tip.

460
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,975
What?

461
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:13,677
No, stop. I'm kidding. Stop.

462
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,517
I like her.

463
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,523
These grades right here

464
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,058
are a one-way ticket to Montana.

465
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,660
If I don't turn these "f"s into "A"s,

466
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:33,230
my vacation's gonna end very quickly.

467
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,598
Yo.

468
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,634
How's early retirement?

469
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:38,202
Incredible.

470
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,104
I got to be honest with you.

471
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:41,705
I'm pretty envious.

472
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,808
I would be too. Pizza?

473
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,745
- What's the catch?
- "Catch"?

474
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:50,581
Yeah, you show up to my house unexpected, there's a catch.

475
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,684
No... just pizza.

476
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:57,788
I swear to God, man, if there are any catches,

477
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,223
I'm gonna slap you in the mouth.

478
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,959
Zero catches.

479
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,161
Okay.

480
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,763
All right.

481
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,569
Okay, cool.

482
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:14,939
I need you to help me break into the school.

483
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,008
Pizza slap!

484
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,258
No. This is insane.

485
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,360
Which part?

486
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:37,761
All of it.

487
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,330
All... all of it is insane.

488
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:42,066
Can you be more specific?

489
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,234
Yeah.

490
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:46,670
You want to destroy the school's security camera

491
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:49,707
- with super string
- "super string"?

492
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,609
Who calls it that?

493
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,978
I don't... whatever it's called,
we're not using it.

494
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,313
Fine. Would you rather use
spray paint?

495
00:26:56,315 --> 00:27:01,185
No, I'd rather not have a plan
that hinges on sprayable string.

496
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,320
Okay. Anything else?

497
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,623
Uh, yeah, step one...

498
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,625
I'm not stealing the janitor's keys.

499
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,059
I mean, the guy looks like Jeffrey dahmer.

500
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,761
Come on.

501
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:13,364
That dude's a sweetheart.

502
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:16,033
So you in?

503
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,202
I can't do this without you, man.

504
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:21,138
I will help you hack the grading system

505
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,774
- under one condition.
- Which is?

506
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,676
We need to change my biology grade.

507
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,811
- Why? What'd you get?
- I'm failing...

508
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,913
So is half of the entire class.

509
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,949
We'll just have to change your grade, then.

510
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,221
Who are we gonna get the security code from?

511
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:40,758
I hear the assistant librarian has it.

512
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,061
Who is the assistant librarian?

513
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:46,997
Stacy Richards...

514
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,365
Or should I say "Roxy"?

515
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,000
You can't be here.
You're expelled.

516
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,436
And you're suspended, so that makes two of us.

517
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:54,772
I'm still allowed to participate

518
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,106
in extracurricular activities.

519
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,307
Well, perfect, 'cause I got

520
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,778
a great extracurricular activity for you.

521
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,147
- Mrs. Taylor.
- Aw, you're turning me in?

522
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,249
- Mrs. Taylor?
- Sure you want to do that?

523
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,818
- I can give you straight "A"s.
- I already have straight "A"s.

524
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,219
Yeah, but what good are straight "A"s

525
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,155
when you have a suspension on your record?

526
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:14,224
Yes, hon.

527
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,460
I could make that disappear, you know.

528
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:18,295
What is it, Stacy?

529
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,831
Your record would be completely clean.

530
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,769
Never mind.

531
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:33,310
What exactly do you need from me?

532
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,878
The keys to the school

533
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,047
and the code for the alarm system, please.

534
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,983
What makes you think I have either of those things?

535
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,452
Because those things are necessary

536
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:42,986
for assistant librarians

537
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:45,723
to open the library on Saturday morning.

538
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,133
It's the one that says "do not copy".

539
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:59,970
Yes, I know which one it is.
Thank you.

540
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:03,207
What do you plan to do with it exactly?

541
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:04,942
Copy it.

542
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,877
No, stupid, I mean, what is your course of action?

543
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:09,847
Well...

544
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,749
Due to new security measures,

545
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,217
my colleague and I have determined

546
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:15,385
that it is impossible to hack the grading system

547
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,221
from the outside.

548
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:18,989
We need access to Truman's computer,

549
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,525
and for that, we will need one key

550
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:25,462
and one security system code, which is...?

551
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,899
1,036.

552
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:31,802
Oh! Like the number of parties
you missed.

553
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:34,404
Or the number of jobs you won't qualify for.

554
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,507
Ouch.

555
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:52,089
- Felix?
- Hey, mom.

556
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:54,792
It's late, honey.
What's going on?

557
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,927
Uh, just a chemistry project...

558
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,929
For school, school chemistry.

559
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:01,265
- "Chemistry"?
- Yeah.

560
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,402
Is this a...

561
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,870
Smoke bomb.

562
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:08,405
- Yeah.
- Yes.

563
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,107
Yes, it is.

564
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:13,110
All right, well, don't go blowing yourself up

565
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,812
- or anything.
- I won't.

566
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:17,281
And get to bed at a reasonable hour.

567
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,428
Danny.

568
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,101
What are you wearing?

569
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:41,138
Me? I'm dressed
like a normal human.

570
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,140
- You?
- Well...

571
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:46,243
I'm wearing black stuff, b-burglary stuff.

572
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,111
You can't do that.

573
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,447
Why can I not do that?

574
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:52,549
Are you robbing a bank?

575
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:53,884
What?

576
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:57,020
- Are you?
- Maybe I am.

577
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,623
Oh, then by all means, dress like that.

578
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:01,058
I'm just wondering where your big money bag is

579
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,292
with the dollar sign on it?

580
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:03,961
Oh, oh.

581
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:05,462
You're so funny, yeah, let me go...

582
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:08,966
I'm gonna go do that real quick.
I'll do that.

583
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,445
Okay, wait.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

584
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:23,513
Can we... can we think about this
for just a split second?

585
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,984
Like, we're about to commit
a-a legit crime right now.

586
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:31,355
Do you understand the gravity of the situation at all?

587
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:33,624
Okay, I take that as a no.
Great.

588
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:35,259
Ow. Oh.

589
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,198
All right, all right, all right.

590
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,591
What the hell, man?
I told you...

591
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,426
No super string.

592
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,562
What is it with you and super string?

593
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,231
Nothing. You know what?
Let's just...

594
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,499
We'll forget about it.

595
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,234
No, no. What, what?
Whoa, wait.

596
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:22,205
Do you have, like, some dark history with string?

597
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,174
Were your parents killed by strings?

598
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,710
No, you douche.
I am allergic to latex.

599
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:29,379
I can't be around super string 'cause it burns my skin.

600
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:33,483
Relax. I'm just gonna
black out the camera.

601
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,054
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!

602
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:38,355
- This is my nightmare.
- Shh!

603
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:39,723
This is my nightmare!
It's everywhere!

604
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:41,391
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

605
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,593
- The knot was on the wrong way.
- Oh, I bet it was.

606
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,362
Are you good?

607
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:47,664
Yeah, oh, I'm perfectly fine, you moron.

608
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,738
- How many times...
- Shh.

609
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,540
Did I say it?
I said, "no super string"!

610
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:58,241
- Jeez.
- I am sorry.

611
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,609
- I didn't know.
- Oh, "you're sorry.

612
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,611
You didn't know."

613
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,716
Ready?

614
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:09,086
Yeah, I'm ready.

615
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,128
Yeah.

616
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,130
Boom town.

617
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,599
Don't celebrate yet, man.

618
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:25,168
Hey, hey.

619
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,037
Don't make me use this, bro.

620
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,539
Are you looking to get punched in the balls today?

621
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,241
Don't... hey!

622
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:32,442
No. Felix.

623
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:36,113
No! don't! Felix, no!

624
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,455
- What?
- I can't do it.

625
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,057
He'll wake up.

626
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,625
So how are we gonna move the laptop?

627
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:24,528
We don't have to.

628
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:30,100
- Where did you even find this?
- I got it from Truman's desk.

629
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:31,768
Shh.

630
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,717
And...

631
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,252
Got it.

632
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,821
You're a wizard, Danny.

633
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:52,856
You know it, bitch.

634
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,094
What are you doing?

635
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:59,696
I'm bugging his computer to keep tabs on him.

636
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,467
- "Keep tabs"?
- Yeah.

637
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,535
If he figures out that we tampered with the grades,

638
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:06,870
we're gonna want to know about it.

639
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:08,572
Ah, got it.

640
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:10,273
Now let's change your biology grade.

641
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,577
Yes, let's do that.

642
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,687
Okay, what gpa do you want?

643
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,689
3.5 should be good.

644
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:28,291
4.0 coming right up.

645
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,260
Really?

646
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:32,429
Yeah. What, you don't want
straight "A"s?

647
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:34,364
All right. Do it.

648
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,833
4.0 it is.

649
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:48,211
There it is...
Straight "A"s, baby.

650
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:49,479
Crap, I got to put this back.

651
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,780
Oh, no way, man.

652
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,215
It's mine now.

653
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,284
I got to put it back on his desk.

654
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,520
He's gonna know we were here.

655
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,401
What are you doing here, Felix?

656
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,769
What are you doing here,
Mr. Truman?

657
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,304
It's 2:00 in the morning.

658
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,373
- Uh-huh. Waiting for the police
to arrive.

659
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,811
What brings you here this time...
Stealing computers again?

660
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:24,381
I think I'm gonna have to
break your window, Mr. Truman.

661
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:26,950
If you think that'll help, son, knock yourself out.

662
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,837
What do you want, Felix?

663
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,207
If you could let me go, that'd be great.

664
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:54,678
No, no, no. I mean, what is it
that you want, huh?

665
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,280
What kind a future do you see for yourself?

666
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,852
Have you ever even thought about it?

667
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:06,690
I know what I don't want.

668
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:10,327
I don't want a seat behind
a desk for the next six years...

669
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:14,631
So I can get a job and sit behind a desk for the next 40.

670
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,499
I'm trying to live...

671
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:19,269
Every second of my life to the fullest.

672
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:20,971
And...

673
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:24,474
You're making that
really difficult, Mr. Truman.

674
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:31,448
Police, open up!

675
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:36,920
He's over here, officer.

676
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,723
Put your hands behind your back.

677
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,812
Very rarely do I say this,

678
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:07,751
but I am, without a doubt, 100% boned this time.

679
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,621
On the bright side,

680
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,325
Montana can't be much worse than this.

681
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:18,428
This could be difficult to explain to my parents.

682
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,830
What do you think?

683
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,470
I never planned to end up like my brother.

684
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,709
Your dad's here to pick you up.

685
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:34,511
Excellent.

686
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,948
Come on out.

687
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,822
Hey, there, son.

688
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,761
Mr. O'Neil?

689
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:55,465
Do you happen to have a moist towelette, by chance?

690
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:57,334
Your son's in a lot of trouble.

691
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:58,635
What?

692
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,603
Felix, I am disappointed in you, son!

693
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:02,405
Super, super disappointed!

694
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:05,608
I'm so sorry, dad.

695
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,646
- Ready, son?
- Yep.

696
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:12,482
All right, then. See you.

697
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,988
You know, I was expecting you

698
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,558
to be a little bit more upset, dad.

699
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,926
Or can I call you "Ben" now?

700
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,831
It's good to see you, little bro.

701
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,499
Seriously.

702
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,468
- I missed you, man.
- I missed you too.

703
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,969
How did you know is me?

704
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,838
I mean, it wasn't hard to recognize you,

705
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,674
even with that little creep-stache.

706
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:39,109
What made you think that would work?

707
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:41,845
It did work, and you're welcome.

708
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:45,849
Sorry, I just... I just
can't believe he bought it.

709
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:47,717
What are you doing here, anyway?

710
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,887
Well, that one is kind of hard to explain.

711
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,455
I haven't really told mom and dad yet

712
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:55,458
about the whole "great escape" thing, so...

713
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,829
- You okay there?
- Yeah.

714
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,998
I know a shortcut.

715
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,636
My brother's a different class of troublemaker.

716
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,805
He's been caught more times than I can count,

717
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:12,742
but he always manages to power through.

718
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,911
He's a veteran rule-breaker.

719
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,679
Me?

720
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,815
I prefer a more subtle approach.

721
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:20,417
Oh, yeah.

722
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,452
- Mm.
- Come on.

723
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,657
I got to say...

724
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,860
You definitely save my ass from the Mountain academy.

725
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:33,596
Yeah, you don't want to go there.

726
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,998
So...

727
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,866
How did you escape?

728
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,602
Isn't that place, like, maximum security?

729
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,572
To be honest, it was pretty easy.

730
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:44,874
How?

731
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,010
I shipped myself out.

732
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:52,182
Last semester I got a job in the mail room.

733
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:54,651
Every Monday I would sort through everybody's letters

734
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:57,020
from a giant sack.

735
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:59,923
The other kids starting
calling me "sack boy."

736
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:03,726
But I had the last laugh.

737
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,208
I was supposed to ship back a broken tandem bike

738
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,009
from our fitness class.

739
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:24,013
But there was just enough space for me to crawl inside.

740
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,582
So I hopped in the box

741
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:28,051
and I shipped myself to freedom.

742
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:29,886
Wait. Seriously?

743
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:31,554
How were you able to breathe?

744
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,656
There was plenty of oxygen, as I recall.

745
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,626
- The box was shipped ground.
- Wait, wait, wait.

746
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:38,761
So you just changed the address on the box?

747
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:41,498
Shipped myself right to our doorstep, baby.

748
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,733
The crate...
You were in that crate.

749
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,935
Yes, dude, you walked right pass me.

750
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:46,936
Oh.

751
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,010
Stretching my legs was...

752
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,947
Borderline orgasmic.

753
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:01,251
Sneaking into the house was easy.

754
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:05,221
Finding a permanent hiding spot was even easier.

755
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,126
I quickly discovered that the attic

756
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:12,295
is the most badass part of the house.

757
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,697
My old box of toys was up there.

758
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,666
So was Santa Claus.

759
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:19,903
It was a little cramped, but I made do with what I had.

760
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,974
For the last few days, I've been living in the attic,

761
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:27,277
off of hot dogs and candy.

762
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,059
Hello?

763
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,761
When I heard you were arrested,

764
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:46,629
I immediately knew what had to be done.

765
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:49,566
Oh, yes. This is certainly him.

766
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,768
We're gonna need you to pick him up at the station.

767
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,237
Absolutely. I'll be right
there to pick him up,

768
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,173
'cause I'm his dad.

769
00:42:57,175 --> 00:43:01,811
I mean this in the best possible way,

770
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:04,647
but you are insane.

771
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:06,616
I can't thank you enough, man.

772
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:08,952
Of course, dude. I got you.

773
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:10,353
You do know

774
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:13,289
that we are about five miles from the house.

775
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,191
Are we walking the whole way?

776
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,893
Nope.

777
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,232
I fixed it...

778
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,736
Sort of.

779
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:30,173
Dude, what is wrong with this bike?

780
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,808
A lot of things.

781
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:42,018
Sorry.

782
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,053
Okay, nice and easy.

783
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:52,862
What are you doing?

784
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:54,764
- What do you mean?
- You can't use the front door,

785
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:57,734
the alarm system
activates after 10:00.

786
00:43:57,736 --> 00:44:00,169
Get it together, man.

787
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:02,305
Okay.

788
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,273
What are<i> you</i> doing?

789
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:06,342
I'm gonna sneak through my bedroom window.

790
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:07,944
Are you kidding me?

791
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:09,412
It's right next to mom and dad's room.

792
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:11,314
They're gonna hear you when you go on the roof.

793
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:12,749
Okay.

794
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:14,651
So how do you suggest that we get in?

795
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:16,719
- The living-room window.

796
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,821
- The living-room window.

797
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,123
That's a rookie move, and you know it.

798
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,424
That window squeaks.

799
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:24,093
I have done this a thousand times, Felix.

800
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:26,663
- So have I.
- All right, you don't get it.

801
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,765
It's my patootie if we get caught.

802
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:31,234
Mom and dad are gonna send me right back to Montana.

803
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:33,069
Not gonna happen.

804
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:34,671
Executive decision...

805
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,739
We're going through the living-room window.

806
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:39,042
- Let's go.
- Fine.

807
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:40,243
But once you're in the attic,

808
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:43,046
you need to be absolutely silent.

809
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:45,915
Mom is the world's lightest sleeper.

810
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,750
You don't need to tell me this, man.

811
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:49,352
I'll be as quiet as a rodent.

812
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:52,221
Mouse, as quiet as a mouse.

813
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:53,956
A mouse is a rodent.

814
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,725
Yeah, but so is a squirrel.

815
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:58,027
Squirrels are relatively quiet, man.

816
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:01,030
I'm gonna kill you.

817
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,832
Okay, all right. Sorry.

818
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:32,895
Go, go, go.

819
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,997
Honey? Is that you?

820
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:36,766
This way, this way.

821
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,138
Come on, this way.

822
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,009
- Hey.
- Hey.

823
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,245
What happened to going to bed at a reasonable hour?

824
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:52,281
I did, I was asleep, I just really needed a...

825
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,085
- Banana.
- Don't touch that.

826
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,754
It was expensive.

827
00:45:57,756 --> 00:45:59,021
Really?

828
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:00,456
The bowl.

829
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:01,824
Oh.

830
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,528
I got a call tonight

831
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,930
from the Mountain academy about your brother.

832
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:10,133
- Yeah.
- They can't find him.

833
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,468
He escaped.

834
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,937
They've been searching the area,

835
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,206
and they haven't found anything yet.

836
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,975
I am just...
I am worried to death.

837
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:20,409
- I-I know your brother...
- Mom.

838
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,378
And I know what he's capable of, and I...

839
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,382
It's okay.
Ben's gonna be fine.

840
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:29,819
You don't happen to know anything about this, do you?

841
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:32,355
- No. No. I--

842
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,193
You don't think he'd come here to the...

843
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,830
What was that?

844
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:42,165
Was that upstairs?

845
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,100
No.

846
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:45,868
Yeah, I think it was upstairs.
Probably...

847
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,904
No, it came from right over here.

848
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:54,343
What did you do?

849
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:57,346
Felix, what is wrong with you?

850
00:46:57,348 --> 00:47:00,216
I told you that was expensive.

851
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:03,452
Why would you do something like that?

852
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,891
Are you gonna help me clean it up?

853
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,364
Felix!

854
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:17,433
Just trying to help.

855
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,386
- The answer is "B."
- Are you insane?

856
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:39,255
I need the report card.

857
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:41,424
Do you not see that I'm in the middle of a test right now?

858
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:42,525
Just get it at lunch.

859
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,067
Hey, hey.

860
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:52,301
My mom's been on my ass all week.

861
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:53,436
I need it now.

862
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:59,275
- You're killing me.
- Yeah, buddy.

863
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:05,648
Thank you.

864
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,550
Hey, seriously,
the answer is "B."

865
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:10,653
Seriously, shut up.

866
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:12,655
It is.
I can see Emily's test.

867
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:15,658
Hi.

868
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,493
Are you serious?

869
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:19,128
"Are you serious?"

870
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:37,380
Any word when we can expect to see your report card?

871
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:39,949
You mean...

872
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:41,217
This one right here?

873
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,551
Is that it?

874
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:44,620
Yep, got it in the mail this morning.

875
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:47,490
Why didn't you tell us it came?

876
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,992
How do you think you did?

877
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:52,328
I think I did okay.

878
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:57,500
Oh, my God!

879
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:01,704
Straight "A"s...

880
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:04,340
The holy grail of academia.

881
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:07,209
Every parent wants to see their kid succeed.

882
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:10,179
They also want the bragging rights at Christmas parties.

883
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,348
They want the honor roll bumper sticker

884
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,183
on the back of their minivan.

885
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:17,253
"A"s are like a reward for properly raising your kid.

886
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:20,423
It's like catnip for parents.

887
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:24,260
Wow, Felix! This is...

888
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:26,996
- Wow!
- I can't believe it.

889
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:29,999
You even got an "A"
in Mr. Harris' class.

890
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:32,234
What, you didn't think I'd be able to handle chemistry?

891
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:35,171
No, no, no, we just got a call
from him a couple of weeks ago

892
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:36,605
about a parent-teacher conference.

893
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:38,207
I was worried there was a problem,

894
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,976
but apparently not.

895
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,544
No.

896
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:44,313
You guys aren't actually going to that, right?

897
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,216
Well, your dad can't make it because he has a real job,

898
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:48,718
but I already said yes.

899
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,653
We're supposed to meet with him on Saturday.

900
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,555
But there's really no reason to.

901
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:54,123
I have an "A" in his class.

902
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,592
I already told him we were going, Felix.

903
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:59,562
Okay, you could just cancel it.

904
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:02,999
- Is everything okay?
- Is there...

905
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,633
Something we should know about?

906
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:06,769
No. No.
I just don't want you to feel

907
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,004
like you have to go.

908
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:09,705
We're going.

909
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:10,773
Great.

910
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:12,208
Terrible.

911
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,043
That's terrible.

912
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:15,344
Is unreal how Mr. Harris

913
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,546
always manages to ruin everything.

914
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:21,083
So I guess you got to tell your parents the truth.

915
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:22,618
Absolutely not.

916
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,221
I'm gonna fake a parent-teacher conference.

917
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:28,290
Well, that sounds difficult/impossible.

918
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:30,026
Mm, difficult, yes.

919
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:33,062
Impossible...

920
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:36,132
Probably also yes, but that's never stopped us before.

921
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,470
We're going to need a shady middle-aged man.

922
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:44,807
Why?

923
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:47,410
To act as Mr. Harris
during the conference.

924
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:51,781
Do you ever just stand back sometimes

925
00:50:51,783 --> 00:50:55,217
and look at your plan and think to yourself,

926
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,620
"wow, I am dumb"?

927
00:50:57,622 --> 00:50:59,688
Why do you got to be like this?

928
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:02,658
Maybe it's because I'm sick of nearly getting arrested

929
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,260
every time that I help you.

930
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:06,429
Who says I'm asking for your help?

931
00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:08,164
You are always asking for my help.

932
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,466
False.

933
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:13,669
I don't need it.

934
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:16,772
- I got this.
- Good...

935
00:51:16,774 --> 00:51:19,075
- 'Cause I would say no.
- Why?

936
00:51:19,077 --> 00:51:20,242
Because...

937
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,411
I'm sick of your sketchy plans.

938
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,713
I help you because you're my friend,

939
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:29,518
but I cannot keep doing this stuff.

940
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,520
No.

941
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,124
It's cool.

942
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:42,398
- I'll just handle it myself.
- Good luck.

943
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,139
Danny isn't wrong.

944
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:52,141
I'm not going to contest what he said.

945
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:58,414
Guess I'm going to have to pull this off by myself.

946
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,555
Shamus.

947
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:08,424
How's it going, man?
Remember me?

948
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:10,626
Oh, come on, Shamus, it's Felix!

949
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,428
I gave you two packs of gum last week.

950
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,497
Hey.

951
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:18,801
I have a proposition for you.
Are you interested?

952
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:21,804
Let me put on some pants.

953
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,613
So you expect me to dress like a teacher?

954
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:32,314
Yeah, we just need to convince my mom

955
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,350
that you're Mr. Harris
for five minutes.

956
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:37,786
- You going to pay me?
- I don't have much money.

957
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:41,624
- What do you got?
- Um, 40 bucks.

958
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:43,759
- What else you got?
- Um...

959
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:45,661
A crossbow.

960
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:49,198
40 bucks and a crossbow...
You got yourself a deal.

961
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,468
Cool, cool. Just make sure
you wear something nice.

962
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,869
"Something nice"?

963
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:55,804
Yeah, like a collared shirt or something.

964
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:57,806
Do I look like the sort of fellow

965
00:52:57,808 --> 00:52:59,775
who owns a collared shirt?

966
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,377
Let's do this...

967
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:03,579
Meet me at my house tomorrow morning...

968
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:05,214
And I'll let you borrow some of my dad's clothes.

969
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:06,782
- All right.
- Okay?

970
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:08,918
- All right.
- Cool.

971
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,389
So you want me to act
like Mr. Harris.

972
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:16,759
Think I can pull it off?

973
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:18,627
Yeah.

974
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,471
- Why? Why?
- What's the problem?

975
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:31,507
What happened with being as quiet as a rodent?

976
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:33,409
I was balls deep in rodent quietness

977
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:35,544
until I found these horseshoes,

978
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,446
and I was faced with a very difficult decision.

979
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:39,215
What?

980
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:41,417
I'm failing to see the difficulty here.

981
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:45,454
It was horseshoes versus quietness.

982
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:47,790
Are you trying to get caught by mom and dad?

983
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:49,925
No, okay? Look, I didn't go
through the trouble

984
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:52,428
of escaping the Mountain academy just so I could be bored

985
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,296
out of my frickin' mind here in the attic.

986
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:56,865
Yeah, yeah, yeah, out of everything you could've done,

987
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,901
all this, you decide to throw horseshoes?

988
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:02,705
Yes. What do you do
in your free time, Felix?

989
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:05,708
It's complicated. You wouldn't
believe me if I told you, but...

990
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,443
Try me.

991
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:11,247
I just bribed a janitor with a crossbow

992
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:13,349
to fake a parent-teacher conference.

993
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:15,684
That sounds amazing.
Let me help you.

994
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,586
No.

995
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,955
I would be an absolute asset to your team.

996
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:23,626
I'm professional. And how do you
know your plan doesn't need me?

997
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:26,028
Because my plan doesn't involve getting screwed

998
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,430
- and going back to jail.
- Okay, at least...

999
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,433
At the very least, tell me what you're doing.

1000
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:34,837
Well, first I'm going to need pizza.

1001
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:36,739
Okay, why pizza?

1002
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,941
- Because I'm...
- Stop. I know why pizza...

1003
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,376
Because you're going to put ex-lax

1004
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:41,910
on the pizza, give it to the teacher.

1005
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:43,545
He's going to have diarrhea

1006
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:44,813
and not going to be able to show up to the meeting.

1007
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:46,548
- What? No, I...
- You're going to do

1008
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,517
the "imposter pizza delivery guy" switch, aren't you?

1009
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:51,620
Ben. I'm getting pizza
because I'm hungry.

1010
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,856
Oh.

1011
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,642
Where have you been? My mom's
going to be here any minute.

1012
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:15,978
- You said be here at 9:00.
- That was an hour ago.

1013
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,579
Oh. Huh.

1014
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:25,921
You know how to tie a tie, right?

1015
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:29,792
Well, I'll figure something out.

1016
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:33,629
Remember, I need you
in room 34... crap.

1017
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,331
- What? What?
- Come on, get inside.

1018
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,066
- What? What?
- My mom's here. Get inside.

1019
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:38,934
- Ooh.
- Get inside.

1020
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:42,438
Upstairs, come on.

1021
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:45,941
No, no.

1022
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,583
Felix?

1023
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:56,585
Yeah?

1024
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,422
What's going on?
What was that?

1025
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:04,126
- W-what was what?
- Never mind.

1026
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:06,395
Remember, we have to leave for that meeting soon.

1027
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:07,429
Okay.

1028
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:28,884
Honey?

1029
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,753
What's going on up there?

1030
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:33,155
- Uh, n-nothing,
I just tripped.

1031
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:36,158
You ready to leave soon?

1032
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,893
Yep, sounds good.

1033
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,667
What the hell did you do?

1034
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:46,869
Who is that?

1035
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,871
- It's Shamus.
- Who is Shamus?

1036
00:56:48,873 --> 00:56:50,706
He's my one hope at faking this conference.

1037
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,708
- Seriously? That?
- Yes.

1038
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,543
You screwed this whole thing up, man.

1039
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:56,145
- What did you do?
- I don't know, man.

1040
00:56:56,147 --> 00:56:58,414
When I see bearded people in my attic, I go buck wild.

1041
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:00,182
Oh, you go buck wild, yeah?

1042
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:02,618
- Yeah.
- Shamus, Shamus, wake up.

1043
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,787
- Oh, man.
- Shamus, wake up.

1044
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:08,791
Shamus, wake up, buddy!
Wake up.

1045
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:10,592
The conference is in 20 minutes.

1046
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,060
Just tell mom he didn't show up.

1047
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:15,097
No. The real Mr. Harris
is going to be there.

1048
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:18,967
Felix, are you ready, honey?

1049
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:21,437
- I got you, man.
- No.

1050
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:23,472
Absolutely not. Stay here.

1051
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:25,474
- Trust me, dude, I got you.
- No.

1052
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:26,708
Yes.

1053
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,777
Felix, let's go!

1054
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,078
Be right there!

1055
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,514
No!

1056
00:57:32,516 --> 00:57:35,951
Oh, there you are, honey.
Come on.

1057
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,886
I don't want to be late.

1058
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:39,888
A little anxious about this meeting.

1059
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,924
I don't know what to expect.

1060
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:44,860
I know exactly how you feel.

1061
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,536
Boom town.

1062
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,579
Target acquired.

1063
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:48,784
Yeah, unfortunately, I'm not gonna be available

1064
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:50,919
till late this afternoon.

1065
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,287
You got it.

1066
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:09,137
Mrs. Anders, you're not
due here until 12:00 noon.

1067
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:13,609
Oh, Mrs. O'Neil.
I'm Felix's mom.

1068
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:15,711
Felix's mom?

1069
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:17,846
Felix...

1070
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:20,616
What's going on here?

1071
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:23,986
- Ooh, were we scheduled later?
- No, no, no, no.

1072
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:26,688
You weren't scheduled at all.

1073
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,390
I don't understand.

1074
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:31,393
Oh, is this because Felix got an "A" in your class?

1075
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:34,029
That's, uh...

1076
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:38,634
No, Felix never got an "A" in my class.

1077
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:41,837
Felix never even passed my class.

1078
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,846
Are you sure you're thinking of the right student?

1079
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:52,881
Oh, I'm positive.

1080
01:00:54,385 --> 01:00:57,853
Felix, would you like to explain this?

1081
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:04,226
Mrs. O'Neil, you're aware
that your son...

1082
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:06,128
No longer attends my class, right?

1083
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,165
Yeah, Felix...

1084
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:17,739
Oh, my God.

1085
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:19,908
Mr. Harris?

1086
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,744
Mr. Harris, are you okay?

1087
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:25,180
- This is perfectly normal.
- How is this normal?

1088
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:27,783
- He's narcoleptic or something.
- Oh.

1089
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:30,752
- I'm calling an ambulance.
- No, mom, he's fine.

1090
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,823
- Yes, a teacher just...
- He's okay, he really is.

1091
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:36,158
- Had a stroke or something.
- Trust me.

1092
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,728
I don't know.
We need medical help.

1093
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,063
Mom, we don't need help.
We got it.

1094
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:43,198
- Eastwood High School.
- We got this.

1095
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,800
- Please hurry.
- He does this all the time.

1096
01:01:44,802 --> 01:01:47,235
- I'll wait outside.
- No, wait, mom.

1097
01:01:47,237 --> 01:01:50,105
Mom, chill, chill, chill, chill.

1098
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:52,441
Oh, my God.

1099
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,811
Ben?

1100
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:58,013
What is going on here?

1101
01:01:58,015 --> 01:01:59,448
Ben, what's wrong?

1102
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,951
I tried. He just... Felix...

1103
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:06,054
Oh, my God, what is wrong with him?

1104
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,457
- Honey?
- I don't want Montana.

1105
01:02:08,459 --> 01:02:10,125
Oh.

1106
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:14,062
Wait a minute.
W-what the hell is he doing here?

1107
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:16,498
I don't know.
He... why would he be here?

1108
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,801
Don't you dare lie to me.
I want answers.

1109
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,306
You failed Mr. Harris' class,
didn't you?

1110
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:25,874
No, I didn't...

1111
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:27,743
- You faked your grades?
- What?

1112
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:31,313
I am gonna talk to Mr. Truman
about this immediately.

1113
01:02:31,315 --> 01:02:34,216
He's not here.
It's the weekend.

1114
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:36,384
Well, then I plan on meeting with him

1115
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:38,487
first thing Monday morning.

1116
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:41,990
And when we get home, you go to your room,

1117
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:45,994
because you are grounded...
Indefinitely.

1118
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,400
Well, at least no one got arrested.

1119
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:58,073
Luckily, Ben used the right amount of sedative.

1120
01:02:58,075 --> 01:03:00,542
Mr. Harris was taken
to the hospital

1121
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:04,212
and woke up a few hours later
with short-term amnesia.

1122
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:08,416
Shamus regained consciousness

1123
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:11,486
and left the house before we returned.

1124
01:03:11,488 --> 01:03:14,422
He made sure to raid our pantry first.

1125
01:03:20,264 --> 01:03:22,464
You've reached the office of principal Truman.

1126
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,833
Please leave a message after the beep.

1127
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:27,302
Hi, Mr. Truman,
this is Julie O'Neil...

1128
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,171
This happens to be the third voice mail

1129
01:03:29,173 --> 01:03:30,539
my mom has left for Mr. Truman.

1130
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:32,207
I'm sorry to call again...

1131
01:03:32,209 --> 01:03:34,075
Hoping she doesn't get through anytime soon.

1132
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:37,112
Concerned about my son...

1133
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:39,881
Ben.

1134
01:03:39,883 --> 01:03:42,184
Ben tried to take the blame for the whole thing.

1135
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:44,019
Mom wasn't sure what to believe.

1136
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:47,455
Regardless, he was sent back to the Mountain academy,

1137
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:50,959
or, as he calls it,
"project butthole."

1138
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,200
He told me he's already planned his next escape.

1139
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:03,572
As for me, the vacation's over.

1140
01:04:03,574 --> 01:04:07,943
I may not want to spend my life at a desk job,

1141
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:10,412
but I sure as hell don't want to spend it in jail either.

1142
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:17,886
Hey, let's do something fun.

1143
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:21,356
I can't. I'm grounded.

1144
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,358
I have pizza.

1145
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,199
- Hey.
- Hi.

1146
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,034
So what did they ground you for?

1147
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:37,005
It's...

1148
01:04:37,007 --> 01:04:39,007
Hard to explain.

1149
01:04:39,009 --> 01:04:41,343
Well, other than that, how are you doing?

1150
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:43,178
Well...

1151
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,579
My parents are on the verge

1152
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:48,617
of finding out I've been expelled, so...

1153
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:50,986
Okay, wait.

1154
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:54,089
- They don't know?
- No.

1155
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:58,260
They are gonna flip when they find out.

1156
01:04:58,262 --> 01:05:01,997
Yeah, that could be a problem.

1157
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:06,368
I just... I just want
to turn things around.

1158
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:09,905
I think I really messed up this time.

1159
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:12,007
I...

1160
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:15,911
I want to do the right thing, but I'm not...

1161
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:18,513
I'm not entirely sure what that is.

1162
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:21,082
I can't keep lying to my parents.

1163
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:25,220
Well, maybe you don't have to lie to them at all.

1164
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:28,390
Huh?

1165
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:32,160
What do you mean by that?

1166
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:37,332
I think I've broken into Eastwood enough times this week.

1167
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:40,435
We're not breaking in, silly.
Come on.

1168
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,652
This is crazy.

1169
01:05:57,654 --> 01:06:00,255
You can almost see the whole campus from here.

1170
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:03,692
- I know. It's awesome, right?
- Yeah, it is.

1171
01:06:03,694 --> 01:06:06,528
So many good memories here.

1172
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:09,230
- Yeah.
- I'm going to miss it.

1173
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:11,132
Montana's gonna suck.

1174
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:16,104
Come on, don't say that.
There's a way out of this.

1175
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:18,273
My mom's not gonna stop until she finds the truth.

1176
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:19,574
Well...

1177
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:22,510
If you could get Truman to re-enroll you,

1178
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:25,113
you will not have to lie to your mom at all.

1179
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:27,148
You'd actually be going to Eastwood.

1180
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,184
I'm not exactly in the position to get Truman

1181
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:31,619
to do anything for me.

1182
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:33,422
Then I guess you're going to have to get him

1183
01:06:33,423 --> 01:06:34,689
to see things your way.

1184
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:37,225
Do you know something I don't?

1185
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:39,194
Possibly.

1186
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:40,996
What?

1187
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:43,198
Well, you know that pizza place I work for?

1188
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,366
Yeah.

1189
01:06:44,368 --> 01:06:46,735
We deliver 24 hours a day.

1190
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:48,770
So?

1191
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:50,672
So...

1192
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:53,708
That means...

1193
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:55,377
Wait for it.

1194
01:06:55,379 --> 01:06:57,178
Now.

1195
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:03,585
I don't get it.

1196
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:11,092
- Whoa. Is that Mr. Truman?
- Yeah.

1197
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:12,694
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

1198
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:16,097
He orders a barbecue-chicken
pizza every Saturday night.

1199
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:18,500
- Why?
- No idea.

1200
01:07:18,502 --> 01:07:21,036
Want to find out?

1201
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:42,257
What do you think he's looking at?

1202
01:07:42,259 --> 01:07:45,093
I don't know.
What time is it?

1203
01:07:45,095 --> 01:07:46,528
It's 11:00.

1204
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:54,269
What is he doing here so late?

1205
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:55,703
Shady stuff.

1206
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:59,374
I wish we could see his screen.

1207
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:02,577
I think that can be arranged.

1208
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,126
Oh.

1209
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:29,537
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

1210
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:31,106
I know.

1211
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:32,841
I really mean that.

1212
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:35,577
I know.

1213
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:37,712
Asking you to risk your neck for me all the time

1214
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:40,748
is pretty selfish.

1215
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:44,119
I just want you to know that if it was you who needed me

1216
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:45,553
to do some shady stuff,

1217
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:47,889
I would do it in an instant.

1218
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:51,126
Well, I was planning

1219
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:53,294
on stealing the declaration of independence.

1220
01:08:57,434 --> 01:08:59,767
I brought you a burrito.

1221
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:03,905
Yeah, okay, I forgive you.

1222
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:08,143
Who's that?

1223
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:09,444
Oh, that's Katie.

1224
01:09:09,446 --> 01:09:13,148
- Hi.
- Hi.

1225
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,457
You really think there's something shady on here?

1226
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:24,592
Absolutely.
There's... there's got to be.

1227
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:26,861
So you recorded this from Truman's computer?

1228
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:28,897
Yeah. What time did you
see him log on?

1229
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:31,599
Around 11:00.

1230
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:33,501
Wait.
How far back does this go?

1231
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,503
I mean, technically, we can go
all the way back to the point

1232
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:36,838
where we bugged his computer.

1233
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,473
I got everything on the hard drive, so...

1234
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:40,508
Wait, wait, look.

1235
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,645
He plays online Blackjack?

1236
01:09:43,647 --> 01:09:46,181
But why would he do this in the middle of the night

1237
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:47,582
at school?

1238
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:50,585
I mean... he must be hiding it
from someone.

1239
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:52,587
His wife, probably.

1240
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:57,425
Whoa, look at this.

1241
01:09:57,427 --> 01:10:00,461
- He just lost $600 right there.
- Oh...

1242
01:10:00,463 --> 01:10:02,230
I'd say he definitely has a problem.

1243
01:10:02,232 --> 01:10:04,599
Oh, wow.

1244
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:07,502
No, this is insane.
He just lost another grand.

1245
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:10,271
Wow! He sucks.

1246
01:10:10,273 --> 01:10:11,940
I mean, he's got to give up at some point, right?

1247
01:10:11,942 --> 01:10:13,841
I mean, this is crazy.

1248
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:15,677
Maybe his wife might want to see this.

1249
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:19,547
Yeah.

1250
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:21,449
What's he doing?
Is he quitting?

1251
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:24,819
I don't know.

1252
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:31,926
Does that...?

1253
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:34,562
Does that say "Eastwood"?

1254
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:38,233
Wait. Did he just...

1255
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:41,769
He just stole money from the school.

1256
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:45,240
Dude, that is, like, serious jail time right there.

1257
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:46,474
This is huge.

1258
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:48,576
Wait. So we just recorded...

1259
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:52,480
We just recorded blackmail jackpot.

1260
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:56,017
Dude, I can't believe this.
He must be out of his mind.

1261
01:10:56,019 --> 01:10:58,586
Does this mean we can get
Truman to re-enroll you?

1262
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:02,590
This means we can get Truman to do anything.

1263
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,692
Yes.

1264
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:05,827
Yes!

1265
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:32,487
Ooh, tell him to come alone.

1266
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:34,322
But who would he bring?

1267
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:36,858
Just do it. It's creepy.

1268
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:41,429
Oh, also tell him he's a douche.

1269
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:43,431
Why?

1270
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:45,066
'Cause he's a douche.

1271
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:56,711
You going to bed soon?

1272
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,483
Felix.

1273
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,620
Sorry. Yeah, I'm going
to pass out in a bit.

1274
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,522
Okay, just checking in on you.

1275
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:09,657
Get some sleep.

1276
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,060
Good night, dad.

1277
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:28,009
Gary.

1278
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:29,410
Nice car.

1279
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:32,447
Are you really this stupid?

1280
01:12:32,449 --> 01:12:34,849
How many times do I need to have you arrested this week?

1281
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:38,553
Oh, you're going to call the cops?

1282
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:39,954
If you are, then great.

1283
01:12:39,956 --> 01:12:41,723
I'd love to tell them about the $10,000

1284
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:45,760
you stole from the school to fund your gambling addiction.

1285
01:12:45,762 --> 01:12:47,995
- Yeah.
- It's your word against mine.

1286
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:51,499
Who do you think they're gonna side with, anyway?

1287
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:53,534
I bugged your laptop, Gary.

1288
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:56,037
I have hard evidence of all your activity

1289
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:58,005
on my hard drive.

1290
01:12:58,007 --> 01:13:00,842
And, frankly, I don't think they're going to have trouble

1291
01:13:00,844 --> 01:13:02,377
picking sides.

1292
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,648
What is this?

1293
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:10,385
Do you want money?
What do you want?

1294
01:13:10,387 --> 01:13:11,619
Enrollment.

1295
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:13,721
- "Enrollment"?
- I want enrollment

1296
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,690
in the next semester at Eastwood.

1297
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:17,859
And I want the forms filled out by Monday.

1298
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:21,095
- That's ridiculous.
- Gary.

1299
01:13:21,097 --> 01:13:23,498
These last few days have been hell for me.

1300
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,466
But I know there's still a chance for me

1301
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:27,468
to set things straight.

1302
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:29,704
- W-what are you talking about?

1303
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:31,873
You once asked me,

1304
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,608
"what kind of future do you see for yourself"?

1305
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:36,411
I thought about it...

1306
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:39,714
A lot.

1307
01:13:39,716 --> 01:13:42,417
And my future is here at Eastwood.

1308
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:44,185
No, that's not gonna happen, Felix.

1309
01:13:44,187 --> 01:13:45,853
The faculty won't approve it.

1310
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:48,790
I think you'll find the way.

1311
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:51,692
Oh, really? Why is that?

1312
01:13:51,694 --> 01:13:53,961
'Cause you don't want to go to jail, Gary.

1313
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:59,767
You're not listening.

1314
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,069
I need those forms authorized by tomorrow morning.

1315
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:03,571
You understand?

1316
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:05,640
Hold on a second.

1317
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:07,875
Come on in, come on in. Hi.

1318
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:10,945
I need you to search for form A-13.

1319
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,914
- It's the enrollment form, okay?
- Yeah, of course.

1320
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:14,682
- Get right on it.
- Great. Great.

1321
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:17,018
Yeah, I've got my T.A.
Working on it right now, uh-huh.

1322
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,137
Felix!

1323
01:14:36,139 --> 01:14:39,607
What in the...
- Danny!

1324
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:41,008
No, no, no!

1325
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:43,211
- Ow! Ow!
- Chill.

1326
01:14:43,213 --> 01:14:46,514
I hate you. I hate you...

1327
01:14:46,516 --> 01:14:48,149
But I respect you.

1328
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:50,117
Oh. Okay.

1329
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:51,853
Ah. Wait, so...

1330
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:53,254
Okay, so how did last night with Truman go?

1331
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:55,156
- Is he gonna enroll you?
- Uh...

1332
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:58,259
He didn't exactly say yes, but he didn't say no either,

1333
01:14:58,261 --> 01:15:00,161
so...

1334
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:03,865
Maybe you need to threaten him a little more.

1335
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,502
What is this?

1336
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:09,270
Uh, an enrollment form.

1337
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:10,972
For Felix?

1338
01:15:13,743 --> 01:15:14,909
Yes.

1339
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:16,544
Why?

1340
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:18,946
It's...

1341
01:15:18,948 --> 01:15:20,681
It's not so easy to explain.

1342
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,551
You can't do this.

1343
01:15:23,553 --> 01:15:25,820
He's got me in a really bad spot, Vanessa.

1344
01:15:25,822 --> 01:15:27,622
What is it... blackmail?
Don't even...

1345
01:15:27,624 --> 01:15:29,624
don't even say anything.
You don't have to say anything.

1346
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:32,760
- I-I really don't have
a choice here.

1347
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:37,265
Mr. Truman, yes, you do.
I can help you.

1348
01:15:37,267 --> 01:15:38,799
"If my demands aren't met,

1349
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:40,568
"then I will be forced

1350
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,971
to turn the hard drive
directly over to the police."

1351
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:45,907
- How was that?
- Perfect.

1352
01:15:45,909 --> 01:15:48,042
Pounds all around.

1353
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:49,977
Amazing.

1354
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:52,079
You guys want to get burritos?
I'm starving.

1355
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:54,315
- Yeah.
- Aren't you grounded?

1356
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:57,652
That is what this guy is here for.

1357
01:15:57,654 --> 01:15:58,986
Oh, don't.

1358
01:16:04,594 --> 01:16:06,627
- Hello.
- Mr. Truman?

1359
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:08,296
Yes.

1360
01:16:08,298 --> 01:16:10,298
Oh, my God, I've been trying to reach you all weekend.

1361
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,266
This is Julie, Felix's mom.

1362
01:16:12,268 --> 01:16:14,235
We need to talk.

1363
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:17,238
Yes, we do.

1364
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,641
Oh, that burrito was fantastic.

1365
01:16:20,643 --> 01:16:22,643
However, I am going to need to use your bathroom

1366
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:23,878
and a scented candle.

1367
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:29,617
Whoa.

1368
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:40,061
Where's the hard drive?

1369
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,896
I put it in that drawer.

1370
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:49,070
Please tell me you made a copy of that video.

1371
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:50,605
What video?

1372
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:52,206
The Truman video.

1373
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:55,142
And, no, I did not make a copy.

1374
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:58,112
Wait. No.

1375
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,848
There is technically still one more copy.

1376
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:02,883
- So you made a copy.
- Truman's computer...

1377
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:04,619
There's still a hard copy on his laptop.

1378
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:07,188
Let's go.

1379
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:17,331
Vanessa...

1380
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:21,035
Funny seeing you here.
Did Truman put you up to this?

1381
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:23,318
- What are you talking about?
- The drive... give it back.

1382
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,376
Blackmailing the dean of students?

1383
01:17:28,378 --> 01:17:29,877
What happened to you, Felix?

1384
01:17:29,879 --> 01:17:31,278
Not that it's any of your business,

1385
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,047
but I'm not doing it for the money.

1386
01:17:33,049 --> 01:17:35,416
I don't care. You're not
coming back to Eastwood.

1387
01:17:35,418 --> 01:17:37,685
Is that the only way for you
to succeed, is to watch me fail?

1388
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:39,320
You're a cheater, Felix.

1389
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:43,891
Everyone else is just too stupid
to see it, even your parents.

1390
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:46,661
It's all fake, just like your report card.

1391
01:17:46,663 --> 01:17:48,162
When are you gonna put in the work

1392
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:50,031
and actually try to play by the rules?

1393
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:52,333
Why do you think I'm trying to come back to Eastwood?

1394
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,702
Probably just to spite me.

1395
01:17:54,704 --> 01:17:57,004
I just need another chance.

1396
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,706
And I'm willing to put in the work.

1397
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:01,375
I will. I want to.

1398
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:03,744
Don't you think I deserve one more chance?

1399
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:08,282
Where's the drive, Vanessa?

1400
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:11,118
I told you I don't have it.
Didn't you make a backup?

1401
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,155
I need that drive.

1402
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:18,693
It's in his bottom desk drawer.

1403
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:22,029
I'm sure if you run, you can get it before he wipes it.

1404
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:37,178
Welcome back, Felix.

1405
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:40,481
It's good to be back, Gary.

1406
01:18:40,483 --> 01:18:43,150
I finished your enrollment forms.

1407
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,892
Shame you won't be needing them.

1408
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:58,999
Oh, and, uh, I wiped everything off of your drive.

1409
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:01,102
What about our deal?

1410
01:19:01,104 --> 01:19:03,070
Looks like our deal is off.

1411
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:08,776
Your mom is on her way.
So are the police.

1412
01:19:08,778 --> 01:19:11,479
I beat you, Felix.

1413
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:24,792
Oh, my God.

1414
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:26,193
- Oh, and I-I wouldn't worry

1415
01:19:26,195 --> 01:19:29,396
about bringing any of this up to the police.

1416
01:19:29,398 --> 01:19:32,199
I've tied up all loose ends.

1417
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:38,172
So you wiped the laptop.

1418
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,110
Laptop?

1419
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,493
All the evidence I need is, uh...

1420
01:19:59,495 --> 01:20:01,395
On that laptop.

1421
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:08,402
Stop!

1422
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,011
You, uh...

1423
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:20,347
Might want to tape these back together.

1424
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:27,388
Felix?

1425
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:30,291
Hi, mom.

1426
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,294
Is he in trouble?

1427
01:20:33,296 --> 01:20:34,895
Uh...

1428
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:40,501
"Trouble"? No, no trouble.

1429
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:42,036
Okay.

1430
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:45,840
What... what is going on?
Why are the police here?

1431
01:20:45,842 --> 01:20:49,276
Oh, why are the police here,
Mr. Truman?

1432
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:56,150
Um, that's kind of...
Hard to explain.

1433
01:20:56,152 --> 01:21:00,988
You know, maybe we should meet
at another time, Mrs. O'Neil.

1434
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,958
Mr. Truman, I have gone
to great lengths

1435
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,994
to meet with you, uh, and to be Frank,

1436
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:09,530
I am kind of fed up with this whole situation.

1437
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:12,166
I need to know what's going on right now.

1438
01:21:12,168 --> 01:21:14,535
His report card...

1439
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:16,437
It's faked.

1440
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:17,571
Right?

1441
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:28,649
Mm, mm, mm. No, no.

1442
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:31,118
This... this looks right to me.

1443
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,920
What?

1444
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:37,291
Felix has been doing...

1445
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:40,961
Remarkably well here at Eastwood.

1446
01:21:40,963 --> 01:21:42,463
Really?

1447
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:46,533
And he's...
He's been participating

1448
01:21:46,535 --> 01:21:49,370
in many...

1449
01:21:49,372 --> 01:21:52,406
Extracurricular activities.

1450
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:56,076
Like the school play, right?

1451
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:58,112
Oh, the school play...

1452
01:21:58,114 --> 01:22:01,682
He was just wonderful at the school play.

1453
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:11,926
Truman signed the papers, and three days later,

1454
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:14,094
I was officially re-enrolled
here at Eastwood High...

1455
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,667
With a few extra benefits.

1456
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:24,405
Can we make this a duet?

1457
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:26,140
There's not enough room.

1458
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,945
You sure about that?

1459
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:36,684
Needless to say,

1460
01:22:36,686 --> 01:22:39,486
looks like this is gonna be my best year yet.

1461
01:22:42,325 --> 01:22:44,024
Oh, sorry. Hey.

1462
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:48,262
Stop stalking me.

1463
01:22:48,264 --> 01:22:50,464
- You're ridiculous.
- See you around...

1464
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:51,632
If you're lucky.

1465
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:03,010
The shortest definition of a game is as follows...

1466
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:05,713
A competitive activity with a fixed set of rules.

1467
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:10,417
There's a point system.

1468
01:23:10,419 --> 01:23:12,419
There are winners.

1469
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:14,521
There are losers.

1470
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:18,592
There are allies...

1471
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:21,061
And opponents.

1472
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:25,466
