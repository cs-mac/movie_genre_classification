Go! Give me $ 20 and I'll go.

Dayle, why did you shoot the basket?
-Well, I hit.

31
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,300
Do you want to sit on the bench
because you scraped your knee?

32
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,700
No, I do not want to sit down.

I did not know it was a secret.

58
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,600
I will punch you.

68
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,500
Troy?

69
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,900
Why do we have to break into your house
if you live here?

70
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Because this is my mom's house
i lost my keys.

71
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,700
I had them, but suddenly
something happened and I lost them.

72
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,900

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Close the door.

76
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,800
They want to live here,
but you just can not.

77
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,500
I love my mom, but not the
hypocritical asshole who is married.

78
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,200
Because she  hypocritical asshole!

79

This is the level of intellect of which we speak.
He ​​reads the tv guide cover to cover.

80
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
Do not need this crap

when I'm swimming in money.
Literally going to make it.

83
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Old, more bands should do this,
wear the same clothes.

84
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,700
Because you are not just a band, you're a bunch of

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,100
This we have to obey.

87
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,400
This intro is the best album ever.

88
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,300
What?
-This is the best intro album ever!

89
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,500

I play with a guy named Kingballs.

95
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,900
No dude, I think,

96
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
All kinds of music.

97

100
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,200

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Yeah.

102
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,800
Thanks, Mom.
I love you.

103
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Hence, play an instrument, do not you?
Do you play anything.

104
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,300
Bass drum.

105
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,800
Drums my man, that's smart.
These days all the damn guitar players.

106
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,000
I need a bag.

107
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,600
Oh, shit.

108
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,800
What? Oh, shit, shit,

109
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,500
Sanctimonious asshole came home.

110
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,900
Let old proguraj it.

111

Okay, just tuck in the stomach.
-I pulled her belly!

112
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,600
I can not wait, I gotta go, I will kick your ass
. -Where are you going? Marcus!

113
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
Stealing my food?

114
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Now you're going to die, fat man.

115
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,400
Hey, what do you want?

116
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,000
Accidentally sent it to my address.

117
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I have digital cable so I really do not need these things.

118
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Ripped my pants from here to here,
my dick hanging out.

119
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,500
Jeez, mate.

120
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,800
Hey, guys.
-God, what are you doing here?

121
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Do you live here now?

122
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
No, I'm...

123
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,900
I came to get my stuff
and pass out on the couch.

124
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,600
Yes, with the lights off. -Yes.

125
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,600
This is bullshit, man. You left the band.
You're done, get out of here.

126
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,300
Chill, OK. I pay half the rent,
can not stay here half the time.

127
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
No, never paid rent,
never paid anything.

128
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,200
I paid to sleep with your mom
. Oh, yeah? -Yes.

129
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,400
Trash one, let's go!

130
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Come on, let's go!
-Old must go.

131
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,100
Stink! Your mother sucks!
Its pizza stinks!

132
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,300
You can not stay here.
-He's an animal! Go away now!

133
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,200
Give me until tomorrow morning.
No, you have to go now.

134
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Ollie. -Because of you we will be
out on the street.

135
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Old, I have nowhere to go. Can I,
please sleep on your couch?

136
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
No. -
Because of what happened to Darentom?

137
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Do the Darenta, do you remember that?
And Allison?

138
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,300
Are you crazy?

139
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,400
Do...

140
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,000
OK kids, let's talk about
who is the hero of this book.

141
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,700
Is there a hero?
Is Piggy hero?

142
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,100
P.O.I.

143
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,200
Do not forget to write the test tomorrow.

144
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,800
Move, I'm serious!
Away, OK?

145
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,300
Go? No, I will not go.
This is a free country.

146
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
You have the right to...
Go away or I'll kick your ass!

147
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,300
You're a little bully, right?
This is my friend.

148
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
If this is your friend,
tell me his name.

149
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,700
You tell me.
This is my brother.

150
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,900
Then
should really know his name.

151
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,100
Do you want to fight? I swear to you...
-Get away from me you little shit.

152
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Okay, enough. Enough!

153
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,200
What is going on here?

154
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,700
L... We...
We're in a band.

155
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,200
Well, we are in the process of drawing up the band.
We are called Tectonic.

156
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,000
We The Tectonics.

157
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Whatever is more punk rock, I guess.
I come to you to discuss.

158
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,700
We're like FM Knives,
but we have fun with them.

159
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,400
Sound more like The Knockout Pills,
Have you ever heard of them?

160
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,100
The Thermals? We're like The Thermals,
a not so political.

161
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,400
We are angry, we are very angry.
-Troy, who is this?

162
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,800
Well Dad, this is Marcus McRae.
He ​​plays guitar.

163
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,600
Plays in a band called
People Of Interest.

164
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
I left P.O.I. so...

165
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,100
My friend and I... -Troy.
-Troy and I could be together in a band.

166
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,100
I want to develop a strategy
here about this project?

167
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,800
Yes, sir.

168
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,500
You can not let him enter the house.
-Dayle, enough. -Terrible smell.

169
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,900
You are unacceptably dirty.

170
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Dayle, burn it.

171
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,000
Dad, I think I will not allow
to burn.

172
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
I thought...
I do not want them in the house.

173
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Well, where did you meet Marcus?

174
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,700
In school.

175
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,100
Lives nearby?
Yes, living in Central District-in.

176
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,500
And what exactly do you want to do in the band?

177
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Hey, what happened to my clothes
?

178
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Here's some clothes.

179
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,700
Well, why did you say my dad
we'd be in a band?

180
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,400
Because we want.
Do you want to be in a band, right?

181
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,300
Everyone wants to be in a band.

182
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,900
Do you mind?
-I'm sorry.

183
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,800
I'll play guitar,
and you'll play the drums.

184
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,500
'll Be perfect.
-What about P.O.I.?

185
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,100
Forget P.O.I. old
This will be better than P.O.I.

186
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,100
What happened to the bag
sausage and beer I gave you?

187
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,800
Threw my beer,
and I ate most of salami.

188
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,800
Actually,
I ate the whole salami.

189
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I plan to eat for dinner, man.

190
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,700
Well, maybe you can dine here?

191
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,500
Yes, that would be great, thanks.

192
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,300
Is it time for prayer?
No, I do not pray.

193
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,000
So, you attend a Lindbergh?

194
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,100
Well, I attended,
but no longer.

195
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,100
You graduated?

196
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,800
Yes. Well, I would not use that word
.

197
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,800
Do you have a job?
-Sometimes we pay to play the guitar.

198
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,800
Did I mention that
shatters on the guitar?

199
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,900
I ask whether you have steady employment?

200
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,600
Well, I've done a lot of work, but I keep getting
fired

201
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,600
for stealing things and sleep where I should not.

202
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,000
And why are you doing these things?
-Because I'm tired and hungry.

203
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,500
Dayle, eat your dinner.
Yes, sir.

204
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,600
Well, I do not really have a drum.
-Drums.

205
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,900
Do not have drums.
Yes, I do not have them.

206
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,600
No connection.
I think it will not be a problem.

207
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,600
Drums can be found everywhere.
Give me one plastic bag.

208
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You should immediately start playing,

209
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
because they do not know how long we will need
to become good.

210
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,600
We should begin as soon as
traveling a thousand steps...

211
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
I once heard
in kung fu movie.

212
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,600
's Funny.

213
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,300
Which are the worst?
-Body, the third hour.

214
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,500
What do you have before and after physical?

215
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,900
Mathematics and hour class community.

216
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,300
So, you're good at math?
Yes, I'm doing fine in all cases.

217
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,800
Besides physical and technical education.

218
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,500
Okay, so we have a physical,
SRH and mathematics.

219
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,400
Three free lessons.
Give me the bag.

220
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,700
I'm done,
it's time to go.

221
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,300
Hey, do you have the seven
dollars you owe me?

222
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,900
I only have five.
-I want my two dollars.

223
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,900
The third lesson,
do not let me down Troy, seriously.

224
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,600
Marcus!

225
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,500
Marcus. What?

226
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,700
I think this band is
is not a good idea.

227
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,800
I hope it's a good idea, Troy.

228
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,500
Booked a gig at a club Neumos.
We're on in five weeks.

229
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
See you tomorrow.

230
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,500
Let me do it, you're doing it wrong.
-I think that's the right amount.

231
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,700
No, it's too...

232
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,400
Now you can add
hydrochloric acid...

233
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,100
Damn, I splashed in the eyes!
-Oh, it burns me!

234
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,500
<i> Study in the American Journal of Health
reveals that the typical American teenager </ i>

235
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,700

236

237
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,100
Your brother and I are going to the store.
Do you want to go with us?

238
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,900
I think I'll stay here.
-What will you do?

239
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,100
Watch porn and jerk off.
-Tell your brother.

240
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,800
Sorry, Troy.

241
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I read the book for school.

242
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,700
It's an autistic kid who becomes a detective
... They say it's good.

243
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,900
We'll be back in a few hours.
Use this time wisely.

244
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,800
God... Shit.

245
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Is your brother here? -No.
-Okay, okay.

246
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,500
Is it cool if I leave a couple of things here?
-Of course, hey listen...

247
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,300
I'm really sorry that I could mark them.
-What? What are you talking about?

248
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
I could not get out of school.

249
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,100
I'm just going to push this crap
under your bed.

250
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,800
Fly's old slouch,
I do not want to see it.

251
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,500
Sorry.

252
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,100
Look at this.
Nothing happens in it.

253
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Depressing.
Look at all this space.

254
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,700
Fill it with something, you have
crayons.

255
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,400
Old, I have my own room...
Oh, my God.

256
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Things would have been different.
I'm telling you...

257
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,500
O my goddess...
Look at this!

258
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,700
This is incredible.
I am impressed.

259
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,100
These are my pants.

260
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,000
Hey, I just...

261
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,700
I've been thinking about the band...

262
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,100
And the two of us together...
-Old will be great!

263
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,800
Predgrupa We are the Raveonettes Neumos
at the club.

264
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,800
There is impossible to get a gig,
so I had to send demo

265
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,800
good one sick band from Detroit, you know?

266
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
They think it's us, and we'll start
rebellion.

267
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,700
But we need to practice.
We have become good

268
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,500
so I thought it would be a good idea if
spent some time here, you know?

269
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,200
In order to achieve the fusion of minds.

270
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,200
Or not.

271
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
You know, we can go slowly. -Yes.

272
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,600
I thought, The Jesus and Mary Chain
like the sound of drums

273
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,800
just a solid backbeat.
As The Sonics or fifties.

274
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I have not heard of the fifties.
It's a decade.

275
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Is
between the forties and sixties. Vietnam, man.

276
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Old does not matter at all.
This is all you need.

277
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,800
These are two new songs that I recorded
.

278
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,000
Cool.

279
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,300
Play with music.
-I do not stick.

280
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,000
Use your imagination, mate.

281
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Secret to drumming
is pounding.

282
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
How it sounds?

283
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,800
Marcus?

284
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,900
Hey, Banthare, can you conjure up some food

285
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,600
so I can restore my health.

286
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,300
I have to go guys, talk to you later.
-Old boy.

287
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,000
At the moment
I did not know where I am.

288
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,400
How long have I been asleep?
-Almost two hours.

289
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,900
O God,
I thought I was dead.

290
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,400
Hey, I found a couple of cool things
that can be put on the walls.

291
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,100
I have Desolation void
Japussa and goblins.

292
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,900
What? What's this?
-Asheron's Call.

293
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,700
Oh, my God. No, bad, bad.
This is the opposite of good.

294
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
This is bad.
These are ads.

295
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,700
I'm trying to get in your head and control you
. It does not want to.

296
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,200
You want to do it, I do not want
to make them for you.

297
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
I'm dead.

298
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Wait a second look.

299
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,800
Yes!

300
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,600
Well, I gotta go.
I have things to do.

301
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,700
Your drumming my guitar...
Ideal buddy, ideally.

302
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,400
Hey, you want to highlight on Thursday?
We can go to a pizzeria.

303
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,300
'll Order a jumbo pizza.
-OK.

304
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Mr. Billings,
look great.

305
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,700
Troy...
Hi, Dad.

306
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Son, maybe you should think about how
choose-friends.

307
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,700
Are you aware of the fact that Marcus
druggie?

308
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,900
Not. -Must be resolved addiction
to put his life in order.

309
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,600
I do not mind give him a shower,
clean clothes and a hot meal.

310
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,300
People deserve help. But I do not want to
in the apartment when I'm not here...

311
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,000
Troy.

312
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,100
Do you understand what
are talking?

313
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Yes, sir.

314
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,800
I'm glad you found a friend,
but the story of the band...

315
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,600
He was not real.
-Yes, exercise.

316
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,500
Only, be smart and open your eyes.

317
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,500
Believe you will make the right decision.
Yes, sir.

318
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,200
<i> May cry, but
not cry alone... </ i>

319
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:57,900
'Cause you see, what hurts, it hurts me
... </ i>

320
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:09,500
< i> Honey, you're not the only
with a broken heart. </ i>

321
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,900
<i> You see, I'm not made of stone
. </ i>

322
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,200
<i> I'm made of stone. </ i>

323
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:25,100
<i> may cry, but
not cry alone... </ i>

324
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,500
Hey, man, where have you been?
I want you to meet my mom.

325
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,200
Hey, Mom!

326
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,800
Hi, you must be Troy.

327
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,800
Most Marcus's friends are skinny, but you...

328
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,500
You look like a man.

329
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,700
I?
I just want to eat your...

330
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Who are you again now?

331
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,000
I ask for Marcus.

332
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,700
Is anyone still out
talks with Marcus?

333
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,900
His mother would be so proud.
It's not here, is he? It's not.

334
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,300
But if you accidentally meet in, say
sells native Oxycontin,

335
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,000
or sell your ass
Volunteer Park...

336
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,700
Tell him that I would, if
again take my salami

337
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,400
kill and rape his corpse.

338
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,900
Troy! Great T!
It's so nice to see you.

339
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,100
Are you ready?
Where have you been?

340
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,100
I waited at the pizza place.

341
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,500
Why? That's why you told me
to wait there,

342
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,200
but when you come and I went to look for
to your mother.

343
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,200
It was silly of you Troy.
Do you have any money on you? -Yes.

344
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,700
Hey...
I have to go.

345
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,800
I can not leave, my dad will kill me.
-That you McRae? McRae! I'm sorry...

346
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,500
McRae!

347
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,000
McRae!

348
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,500
God, this school water hypocrites!

349
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,200
You know that
biology teacher with big eyebrows?

350
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Caught him with students in the classroom,
but they covered it. -Marcus...

351
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,100
I do in trouble, and they kick me out.
This is bullshit. -Marcus!

352
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,200
What is it? What?
What is it?

353
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,000
I do not listen to punk rock.

354
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,200
I know who you are,
because everyone knows who you are.

355
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,900
I do not listen to bands you're talking about,
not know who they are...

356
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,600
This is a lie!
I do not know to play the drums.

357
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,000
Okay.
-I can not compete with you for five weeks.

358
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,700
Relax and take a deep breath.
Why freaking out?

359
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,400
Freaking out because I do not know
play the drums!

360
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
I can fix it.

361
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Now calm down, okay?
Good.

362
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,200
Ollie Ollie oxen loves you!

363
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,900
Hates it when I say that.
Would not you hate to call Ollie?

364
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Ollie Ollie oxen loves you!
Give me some free Oxya, please.

365
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,300
Open!

366
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,600
Open...
-Well, well what the hell...

367
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,500
Oh, shit.

368
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,800
Who is this guy?

369
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,500
This is Troy. You have to learn how to play
drums.

370
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,000
Why? Because everyone should know
play the drums Ollie on.

371
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
This is some kind of scam?
How much do you charge?

372
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,000
No, he's... He knows to play.
He ​​only has a Innovative Ideas

373
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,700
and need help in their implementation.
Here you go inside the image.

374
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,400
No.

375
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,800
Old, no. And if I play a gig in
Azengi with P.O.I.?

376
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Why do you think it would be like?
-Because you're terrible without me.

377
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,100
Just kidding, but the type of Kay'sa
will be there for my songs, right?

378
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,900
What happens when
realize that you're not a band?

379
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
I can not solve all your problems,

380
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,600
but if I'm there to watch the concert
, is not it?

381
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,600
Azenga sounds cool.

382
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Out! -Sorry.
-Out!

383
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Wait,
stop and talk with me for a minute.

384
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,700
Here I can have a kid.
He ​​is a child, this is a bar.

385
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,400
Three lessons. -No.

386
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Two lessons Mate will return
his Danelectro.

387
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,300
One lesson and you will appear on
gig on time.

388
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,700
In nine. Not at nine-fifteen,
not about nine. In nine!

389
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,700
I was
goodwill for five years

390
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,400
exactly much time has gone by
I met you.

391
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,600
OK, great. Cool. Do not steal anything,
and I'll be back later.

392
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,500
Wait, now? Yeah, now.
Can I have some money for food?

393
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,800
Law, man.
Talk to this guy, it's great.

394
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,300
Talk to him about the way Algeronovom and Japussu.

395
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,200
Japussu?

396
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,500
Hi, guys.

397
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,700
Guys?

398
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,300
Jesus.

399
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,000
Do not need to use double kick pedal,
a lot of batter so.

400
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,200
've Never played the drums, right?
No, not really, sorry.

401
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,400
So why do you have to learn today? Marcus
-we got a gig

402
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,600
at a club called Neumos.
-Neumos, seriously?

403
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
Neumos,
it's Marcus said?

404
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,100
Priceless .

405
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,800
Well, go ahead.

406
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Wait, let's try this.

407
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,000
Drums, sticks, hit.

408
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,500
This will be ugly.

409
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
How's it going?

410
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,900
Show him what you know.
-OK.

411
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,900
Unbelievable!

412
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,100
It taught him
in just one lesson?

413
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,500
Have you learned
rhythm of the song Be My Baby?

414
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,000
Kidding?

415
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,200
It took me an hour to learn how to
're not digging around the bat.

416
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Not matter.
It's just a drummer, right?

417
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,400
Troy! You feel better, do not you?
-I feel worse.

418
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,100
What?

419
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,800
Okay,
everything is fine.

420
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,900
Sorry.

421
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,400
Troy, come here.

422
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,200
Have you skipped school today?

423
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,800
Do you think asking this because
I do not know the answer?

424
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,700
They called,
where have you been?

425
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,400
With  Marcus.

426
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,100
Did you use drugs?
No, sir.

427
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Is Marcus used drugs?
No, sir.

428
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,000
Where have you been?

429
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,200
I will repeat the question once and only once.

430
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,900
Where did you go today, son?

431
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,500
Marcus wanted to meet in a pizzeria
,

432
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,200
so I went there,
but he never showed up.

433
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,900
I went to his house,
his stepfather was there

434
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,600
and threatened to kill me
and then I immediately went back to school.

435
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,700
For Dad. Marcus was at school.
He ​​said we have to go to a bar

436
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,000
and
would teach me how to play the drums.

437
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,700
I went to him and really,
we drank in the bar.

438
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,600
Indeed. And what I did was stupid
. That's enough.

439
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,500
Marcus  stepfather's threats?
Are you okay?

440
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,300
There was nothing bad, Dad.
Trust me, I'll call Marcus

441
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,500
and tell him to forget the whole thing
, OK?

442
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,900
I do not even play the drums,
should have seen me, I ended up looking a fool.

443
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,900
Why did you fool?
Because I am a fool.

444
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,600
I know it's difficult
when you lost your mom.

445
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,800
Look at me, son.
Look at me.

446
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,500
But you can not use that as an excuse
...

447
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,500
School...

448
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,600
... Thought it would be a good idea to talk to some
,

449
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,000
so I have to set up a meeting tomorrow
.

450
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,800
Daddy please
do not make me go.

451
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,800
I will not mark them.
No, it certainly will not do more.

452
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
I spoke with Mrs. Helm...

453
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,800
She does not mind if you play here,
already half-deaf.

454
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,900
You can not play before school, or after
22:00.

455
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,600
I wish them well sustainer,
were expensive.

456
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,300
Nothing on the drum kit.

457
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,000
These cymbals were not included.
This stand was...

458
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,700
Neither this stand was not included.

459
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,100
Daddy...

460
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,000
I want to polishing,
I want to keep Spun...

461
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,000
I want to keep them in good condition
.

462
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,300
Oh, shit!

463
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,200
Oh, shit!

464
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,100
Good company,
now all touch portal

465
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,800
and will be transported to
Hogarth.

466
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Got a phone call.

467
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,700
's Funny, Dayle.
I'm serious.

468
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,100
For real?

469
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,500
Hello ?
<i> Troy, what are you doing man? </ I>

470
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Nothing special.

471
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,600
Is not...
Do tonight?

472
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,200
I think I got $ 40.

473
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,500
This is a super cool...
Hello?

474
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,800
Hello?

475
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Are you still there?

476
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It was Marcus, I think...
Will come after me.

477
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,700
'll Come for me.

478
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,300
Why would you pick?

479
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,000
Azengu go to the gig.
It's like a concert.

480
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,400
And you agreed to go half-past nine in the evening,
without asking me,

481
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,800
though I stand here before you?

482
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,200
No, this is not acceptable.
Call him and tell him he can not go.

483
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,400
're Right. I can not go, no way...

484
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,300
I do not know who you be,
I do not know where you'll be,

485
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,300
Not for you to come home...
-You're right, I can not go.

486
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,200
No way. Because there is no way to
hang out with normal people.

487
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,900
This is so sad.

488
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,300
What if I'm too
to stop the car? -Troy!

489
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
Or if there is enough space in the car

490
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,200
everyone will ask:
"Hey, who invited the fat kid?"

491
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,200
You know what? They'll think I'll take up too much space
and everyone will be mad at me.

492
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,800
Hey guys, I'm back.
-Troy, you can go to the concert.

493
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You're a smart boy
and if something happens, you call me.

494
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,500
No, Dad, I do not get it, OK?
What if I go and...

495
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,300
Get up, get dressed,
I will tell you when your friends arrive.

496
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
My shoes!

497
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,600
Guys, calm down.
Stop.

498
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,600
You, there.

499
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
You wait here.

500
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,100
Hi!

501
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,200
Evening.

502
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,900
Do you have a nice house, sir.

503
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,200
Troy!
O God.

504
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,900
're Going dressed like that?

505
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,900
This is bad. I mean, it's OK.
It's good, you look OK.

506
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,600
But not tonight.

507
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,000
We can fix it.

508
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,400
Do you have a driver's license
to be able to drive the...

509
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,600
It's a beast.
-This is my first car, so...

510
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,500
I have no problem with it.

511
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,900
For some time I drive.

512
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,300
Now I know where they both live.

513
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,300
Old!
Oh, my God, yes!

514
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Where is this place?

515
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,200
The Eastlake neighborhood.
I do not know exactly the name of the street.

516
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,400
But I knew I would tell you,
swear.

517
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Here, g. Billings,
I hold the door for you to... OK.

518
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,600
Are you stoned, Marcus?
-What? Not at all.

519
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,300
Do you understand the concept of responsibility Marcus,
're here because you're in charge.

520
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,000
I put my trust in your hands.
Was it a mistake? -No.

521
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,700
Fully accept responsibility.

522
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,500
If there is drinking,
if drug use...

523
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,200
Do not.
-If anything, anything...

524
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,000
I'll hold you responsible,
understand me?

525
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,700
Yes
understand and accept responsibility.

526
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,300
Right then.

527
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,900
Rock Club...

528
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,200
Enjoy the concert.

529
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,200
I thought you said something else.
It's nice of you, thank you.

530
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,300
We have to go guys.
Go.

531
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,000
Troy!
Call me if you need me.

532
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,000
Drink this.

533
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,000
No, wait. I promised your dad
I'll look after you.

534
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,200
I have not promised anything
his dad.

535
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
And you are totally reliable,
except using.

536
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,600
I do not want to have anything to do with it!

537
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,100
I remember my first date.

538
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,900
Large T, what are you doing?
Go.

539
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,800
Hey, Morgan.
-Megan, You coward!

540
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,500
Megan, sorry.
This is my friend Troy.

541
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,100
We're in a band,
he's my drummer.

542
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,800
Is it good?

543
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,500
No, but it hits harder than my stepfather.
Look how big it is.

544
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,200
The most important thing about drumming
to know the pounding.

545
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,600
Do you pounding?

546
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,800
Old, I
that your band next.

547
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,500
OK, I gotta go.
Troy on.

548
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,600
O my God, are terrible.
I would think they're better than this.

549
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,300
Troy...

550
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Troy ! -What?
-I have an important job for you.

551
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,200
Are you ready?

552
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Ready for what?
-Ready. Okay, let's go.

553
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,800
Hey, guys.
Thank you for coming to see my band.

554
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,200
Everyone came just to see if
Marcus again implode on stage.

555
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,900
What do you think?

556
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:46,900
I'm not sure.
-Did not his friend?

557
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,600
I, we met at...
I...

558
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,600
Yes, he's my best friend.

559
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,300
Marcus...

560
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,200
Marcus! What?
-You do something for me.

561
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,900
Do what you play
at the end of each song?

562
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,600
Do it!
Do not do it. -OK.

563
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,500
's Horrible, man. Okay,
I know he's so annoying,

564
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,700
I will not do it anymore.
-Hey, that's it.

565
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,200
This is our last gig.
Let's finish with style.

566
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,700
Hey guys, we P.O.I.

567
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,100
Listen to this.

568
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,100
I love these guys!
This is good.

569
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,700
I do not understand how,
when Marcus was so self-destructive.

570
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,300
Sometimes I feel
-destruction.

571
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,800
I'm the same.

572
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,800
I like your shirt.

573
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:24,700
I drew.
-This is the law, buddy!

574
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,500
Hey, Dino!
Dino, do you like this?

575
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:19,000
We have a lot of goods for sale in the back,
ask the waitress.

576
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,200
Are you looking for someone?
Yes...

577
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,500
Marcus or...
In fact, any of the guys.

578
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:54,000
Do... Ollie and Dino
Max was taken to the hospital for a broken nose

579
00:50:54,200 --> 00:51:00,000
Marcus went to a whore,
and your two friends wanted a hot dog.

580
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,500
I went to the toilet.

581
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,600
Do...

582
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
You know, I was a school psychologist at
.

583
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,100
Snarled myself
wrists with a pocket knife. Really?

584
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,300
Do you want to see?
Yes, it can.

585
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,700
I'm just messing with you, man.

586
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,100
My friend Camille's done.
It's crazy, like...

587
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,300
Isabelle Come, let's go!

588
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,500
I have to go to their friends.
I'll see you at school.

589
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,700
Ladies, what happens?

590
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,700
Cool.

591
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,600
Daddy, make him stop!

592
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,400
Shut up, Troy!

593
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,500
Here, I made pasta with cheese.
I put more butter on it.

594
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
Do you want hot sauce? -No.

595
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,800
Listen, I have to tell you about a gig...
It was incredible!

596
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It was like...
So you start to play

597
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,700
and suddenly,
like a jet taking off.

598
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,400
Then  occurred scrimmage...

599
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,900
Smacked you in the face of the type
and fell right in front of me.

600
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,600
And then the guy ran,
and you're bent over...

601
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,300
I thought you'd get on the nose,
but you just slipped away.

602
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,500
And I thought that
I can not do in their games.

603
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,500
I felt like...
Jesus Christ!

604
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,300
There are many things about which I have no idea
and you've shown them.

605
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:19,000
I am committed to this, man.
Before I let you down,

606
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:24,500
but I did because I was stupid and did not know
a punk.

607
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,700
Well, now you know.

608
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,900
Look...

609
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,200
I totally strgan
and I think I'm going to get some sleep.

610
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,400
Is that cool?
Just a little nap.

611
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,600
Are you sure you do not want to practice, we have
gig in three weeks.

612
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,800
You dance, and I'll criticize.

613
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,100
Do...

614
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:12,100
Listen, I'm going to sleep,
and you just think about drumming.

615
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,500
Sorry.

616
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,700
I was very sweaty and frustrated.

00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,700
This was so angry.

621
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,600
Anger, revenge.
Revenge, is not it?

622
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,700
Revenge thick kid.

623

636
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,500
Yes, I want to sleep with you
if you knew you were in the band. -I would not.

637
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,000
Excuse me, miss...
-What are you doing? Marcus!

638
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,500
Hi! -Hi.

639
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,200
We play together in a band.
They came to our gig, right?

640
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,500
Are you trying to get a free piece of pie?

641
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,500
Yes, I would like a free piece of pie.
-What kind of music do you play?

642
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,700
Well, what kind of music do you listen?

643
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,500
I do not know...

644
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,700
Norah Jones.

645
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,300
Norah Jones? We are just like
Norah Jones. I love it.

646
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:13,000
Right. I'll give you a dollar if you tell me the title
any of her songs.

647
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,700
Come Away with Me. Yeah!

648
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,400
Perfect, we just got a free piece of pie

649
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,300
You guys are sweet guys.

650
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
See? Women love the musicians, especially drummers
.

651
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,200
I do not know, I guess it is
the primeval instinct or something.

652
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,400
Just like you.

653
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,100
Hey, Isabelle...

654
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,700
Will you be my girlfriend and
sleep with me as soon as possible?

655
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,800
Troy...

656
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,800
Who would not?

657
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,800
Jeez, you scared me.
-I'm sorry.

658
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,500
Did you go for a hot dog?
-Dude, what?

659
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,200
Other night,
we talked about them.

660
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,100
I thought you were going to eat.
-I.

661
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,900
Do not contaminate my pants, Isabelle.

662
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,700
Hey, Troy.
-Hey, Manoj.

663
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,800
When we were little,
we were good friends.

664
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,500
I can not see you to socialize.

665
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,700
Stopped talking to me
years ago.

666
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
He's a fool, does not matter.

667
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,700
You know, I had fun
at the gig the other night.

668
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,900
This is cool. -Yes.
I play guitar,

669
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,300
not in public or something, but...
-It's cool.

670
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,300
I have to go to class, sorry.

671
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,900
This is cool.

672
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:10,300
And this guy is a "hard" Tony DeTraglia.
He ​​is the strongest guy I know.

673
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,500
Was a Mormon.
-Mormon?

674
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,700
I did not know that there are
and these Marines. It's cool.

675
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,400
I think
owns Ford dealerships in West Virginia.

676
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,800
This is so cool, man.

677
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,700
Do you really like to be a Marine?

678
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,900
Yes, I really did.

679
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,400
I loved it,
I was good at it.

680
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,100
Maybe I should stay in the military, I do not know.

681
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
My wife...
At that time it was not my wife...

682
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,400
Not to condone it.

683
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,500
Old!
T, look at this!

684
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:50,100
Were as thin as a whip.
Look how cute you were!

685
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,800
Thank you.

686
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,300
Just a second!

687
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,500
I just wanted
aspirin for a headache, my head is killing me.

688
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,300
I need to meet...
I need to find a friend...

689
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,000
Sounds good, does not it?
Our band.

690
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,700
See you later.

691
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,100
I do not want to hang out with more
Marcus.

692
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,300
Dad, but...
-So do not go Troy

693
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,000
Later we'll figure out what to do with his stuff.

694
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,400
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.

695
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,900
You should not be here.

696
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:10,100
What to do, put me out of school?
It's already done.

697
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,900
Will you vote for Heather Hawks?

698
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,900
I think I have a
stole a bike with her brother.

699
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,500
Name was Travis Hicks, Hawks?

700
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,200
Maybe not.

701
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,000
Your daddy is
say something, right?

702
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,400
He said more
we can hang out.

703
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,600
Okay,
I'll talk to him.

704
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
No one stays mad at me for a long time.
I am a charming guy.

705
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,200
I talked to my friend for Neumos.

706
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,400
He said that we can push
gig for a few weeks to more practiced.

707
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,100
Come on man, just stop
.

708
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,300
To Stop what?
No-pants.

709
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,000
Troy There pants and we must be ready.
Neumos is a great club, man.

710
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,800
Behold, I checked on the net
and there is no mention The Tectonics.

711
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
OK, so you went to their site.
Did you see the announcement of a special guest?

712
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,900
Yes.
-We are the special guest, Troy.

713
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,600
So why announce
for each day of the week?

714
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,300
Look, I get it.
I am fat, I'm not stupid.

715
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:10,500
OK, do you play those two songs?
Working out every day? -Sam.

716
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,700
If we play a gig tonight,

717
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,900
if you
prove that this band is for real?

718
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,100
Hey...

719
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,300
You...

720
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,000
Do you have a phone?
Can I borrow you for a second?

721
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,500
Thank you.

722
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,900
My friend Chad
organizing things like this every Friday night.

723
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:28,300
'll Be perfect for a small space
and will be a lot of people.

724
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:31,700
Hey, can I get your attention?

725
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:35,600
Tonight
global survey of my new band, The Tectonics

726
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,000
with Troy Billings,
so if you think this is a great

727
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,700
after this will be huge, right?
We play with Chad at ten o'clock.

728
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,900
Be there for tomorrow
remain in ruins and the smell of burnt hair.

729
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,500
I vote for the Hawks!

730
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:57,200
What about the evidence?
-Band does not exist.

731
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,900
There if you want it.

732
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:03,100
Do not disappoint me, Troy.
-Hey, I see you!

733
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,900
Please do not disappoint me, thanks.

734
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,100
Vote for the Hawks!

735
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,300
Eat this. No, I'm trying to reach an ideal weight
.

736
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,300
Not taking enough calories.
Dad, everything is under control, right?

737
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:27,000
Just leave me alone.
-I do not like your attitude, Dayle.

738
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,700
Well, maybe me, if you pick up the homeless,
buy the drums.

739
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,800
're Done, leave.

740
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,700
I do not know what is going on in this family,
but from now on things will change.

741
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,800
For too long I have been indulgent.

742
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Daddy? What?

743
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,700
New store at Eliot
a new expansion Seas Of Deception

744
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,900
for Asheron's Call.

745
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,600
I think I went last year
and it was really fun, remember?

746
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,400
This is really important,
can easily go by bus.

747
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,800
Yeah, right.

748
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,800
I think this will not be able to.

749
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,500
Oh, everything will be fine, you'll see
.

750
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,700
As soon as you get there.

751
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,700
Told me that no one would come.

752
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,700
Usually they come, but maybe
came to see us.

753
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,400
Come.

754
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,100
Push it, push it...

755
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,100
Yes, we have The Tectonics.

756
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,000
You have to be patient a minute.

757
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:56,700
Good. We'll open with a Sock Hop
and we will immediately move to Disconnect.

758
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,900
What is wrong with you?
Troy, it's just two songs.

759
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,600
You'll make it, right?

760
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,000
This song is called Sock Hop.

761
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,900
Troy, Troy...

762
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,500
This we call punk rock.

763
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,500
You have no respect for me, or
to what I say.

764
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:20,200
Do you think you can do whatever you want
and there will be consequences?

765
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,600
You will go to school, you come home, you write
task.

766
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:28,500
You do not play games on the computer!
You'll sit and think about it

767
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:32,500
How
I can not believe you lied to me in the face, bitch.

768
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:41,300
I have never been so disappointed in you
, Troy. Never.

769
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,800
I hate you!

770
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:35,200
Fuck you!
Who do you think you are?

771
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:39,700
Why did I ever trust you?
I hate you, I hate you!

772
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,400
Hey. Hey.
-Is this a bad time?

773
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,500
Not.

774
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:13,600
I just wanted to stop by and say hi, see how you
.

775
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,000
Especially after what happened with Chad...

776
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,500
Old man, you have become a legend.

777
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,100
Yeah, but someone has to put
on YouTube...

778
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,300
I know, the video was seen by
23 000 people.

779
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:30,500
It does not sound good.
-Well, that...

780
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:36,400
I just came to see you.
You're okay, right?

781
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,900
Cool.

782
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,800
Old...

783
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,600
After the death of your mother, bring
I feel like an ass.

784
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,300
Sorry.

785
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,800
Okay. -If you want,
we can hang out.

786
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,000
Manoj Hey, long time no see.
-Hey, when do you do?

787
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,200
It's nothing special.
-Well, old.

788
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,900
While I was running I saw your gay friends

789
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,600
to sell your ass
for drugs in Volunteer Park.

790
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,300
Looks horrible.

791
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,000
Marcus?

792
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,600
Marcus!

793
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,600
Sorry.

794
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,100
Marcus?

795
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,400
Marcus.

796
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:58,200
T. You are alive.

797
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,200
Yes.
-I thought you killed.

798
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,300
I'm alive.

799
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:10,300
Good to see you.

800
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,700
So old, a lot of work ahead of us.
I have new songs

801
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,400
very complex and structural materials.

802
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:26,300
As long as it can be dammed,
dismantled and the two of us working on it...

803
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,000
I think in the end
it may work out fine.

804
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,900
What are you doing?

805
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:41,000
Marcus ?
Marcus, are you okay?

806
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,400
Marcus! Hey, what did you take?
Do you hear me? Marcus?

807
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,100
Sorry,
can I have your phone?

808
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:53,100
I need your help.
I need your help, please!

809
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:59,300
Please help me!
Please call 911!

810
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,200
Troy...

811
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,500
They told me to wait here,
was not long.

812
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:20,200
Stay here.
Mrs., Ms.,

813
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,900
I find patient...
Sir, step away.

814
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,600
If someone needs to step back,
it'll be you.

815
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,800
Okay, okay,
as the patient's name?

816
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,200
Marcus McRae.
-And you what a member of the family?

817
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,400
I'm the boy's father.

818
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,100
You.

819
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,600
Going?

820
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,400
Do not stay long.

821
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:12,000
I just flew in the air on a magic carpet

822
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,300
And you were there.
It was fun.

823
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,800
I have a fever.

824
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,700
What did you get for it?

825
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:26,900
Powdered detergent,
with him can go where I want.

826
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:32,300
Mr. Billings.
It sounds like you're the butler.

827
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,300
Good joke.

828
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,400
Some rest, son.

829
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,700
Go.

830
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,100
Troy...

831
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:56,100
This means much.

832
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,500
I'll stay with Marcus.

833
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,400
Go. Okay,
to go home now.

834
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,200
I hate hospitals.

835
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,800
I do not know what is going on.

836
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,400
Nobody ever says nothing.

837
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,700
No one has told me anything
when my mom was sick.

838
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:29,700
Everyone said, "Dayle,
everything will be fine, do not worry."

839
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:33,500
So I thought it would be good
and I do not need to worry, you know?

840
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:40,400
I felt like an idiot.
No one talked to me.

841
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,800
I tried to talk to you.

842
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,900
I tried.

843
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,500
Are you worried about Marcus?
-He's your friend.

844
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,300
He said it would be cool if
went with us

845
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,500
next time
The Tectonics be played.

846
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:13,700
You will be responsible for the sale of goods.

847
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:18,900
Nonsense, why would you do that?
Because the ladies selling t-shirts.

848
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,100
Do Dayle,
do not need to keep winning.

849
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,500
Tatu not care.

850
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I do not care at all.

851
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:39,200
Do what you want, be happy.

852
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:46,300
I thought you did the two of you
all around, you know?

853
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:50,800
And I always want you around.
You're my little brother, I love you.

854
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,200
Do?

855
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:35,100
<i> Dr. Fisher.
DR. Fisher, report to orthopedics. </ I>

856
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,600
OD'd and had pneumonia.

857
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,900
This was a long night, but
will be fine.

858
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:46,400
Outside, I saw his stepfather.
Will you come back?

859
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,100
Will not.

860
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,400
I think, will come back later?
Tonight?

861
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,700
I know what you mean, they will not.

862
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,200
And that they have to do with drugs...
Immediately pulled him out of the room.

863
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,500
She did not even see?

864
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
What if he died?

865
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,500
People are just tired, Troy.
Cancel.

866
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,700
I will not give up on him.

867
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,900
You do not give up on us.

868
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,100
Did not give up the lure,
not given up on me.

869
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:20,800
Did not give up any of Marcus
and does not your son.

870
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:33,700
Daddy's not your fault that I became fat.
I want you to know.

871
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,900
Sisters
will be back in a few hours.

872
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,800
Marcus  will be up soon,
will be happy to have you here.

873
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:01,300
Eat breakfast and
call me if anything changes.

874
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,600
Troy?

875
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,900
I am proud.

876
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:32,200
Most recent CD
Whiskey Tango is good.

877
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,400
Have you heard of The Marked Men?

878
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,800
They sound like us,
just as their drummer worse.

879
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Slow, slow progress g. McRae.

880
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:49,800
So bitter.
-What are you doing?

881
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Only...
It's too many of them, you know?

882
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:56,200
So I'm a couple of pills
save for later.

883
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,400
I'll need a little...
I need those books.

884
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:02,700
Where can I get that book
stating the fact that these pills.

885
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,900
Old, these are all colors of the rainbow.

886
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:10,200
I got fifteen tablets Oxya
from a guy who lost his arm.

887
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,100
But how do you recover from that?

888
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,200
Heal?

889
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,100
Do not worry about it,
just sit there and look pretty.

890
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,300
Like my frog.

891
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,800
Do not move, asshole!

892
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,100
Brought me skip it.

893
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,800
I think Marcus should come and live with us.

894
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,700
Marcus is eighteen years old,
is not a child anymore.

895
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,300
Stealing drugs?

896
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:46,800
Troy, I know that Marcus
your friend and you want him to be loyal,

897
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,600
but these are stolen drugs.
This is a criminal offense.

898
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,900
Then call the hospital.

899
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,800
They will call the police
and he will go to jail.

900
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Troy,
he is responsible for his actions.

901
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:03,000
Will it help constipation?
-He was so decided.

902
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,800
That these decisions were wrong,
but we can help my friend.

903
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,000
Daddy...

904
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I think we should.

905
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,100
Hey, are you awake?

906
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,700
I like your pants.

907
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,900
T! My friend,
we have to go.

908
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:43,700
I need pants, no pants.
Stole my frog

909
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:47,600
and it had been
pills that I took from a locked cabinet.

910
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,800
We have to go now!
-Well, I am...

911
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,000
I took your frog.

912
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,500
This is great!

913
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:01,900
Great, where is it?
-I gave it to my dad

914
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,000
and said he could come and live with us if
get some help.

915
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,200
That's the deal.

916
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:12,600
Stupid asshole.
Where were you when I found you?

917
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,800
I want to kill yourself, man.

918
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,500
Wanted to throw under the bus,
and I'm the one who needs help?

919
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:22,200
Do not you want to live somewhere where you have
food and TV, you're not on the street?

920
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:27,800
Here  I was so good, and you
we now take away?

921
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,200
I had a lot of tablets
to be my beautiful,

922
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:34,000
I had a lot of later,
but now I have to start over.

923
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:38,800
Do not.
Just come and play the gig with me.

924
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,300
What a gig, man?
Never been gig, right?

925
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,500
Wake up!
Exploited you, man!

926
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:47,200
This is the only reason why
I hang out with you.

927
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,400
This band does not exist!
This friendship does not exist!

928
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,100
There if you want it.

929
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:04,500
Do not fuck with a fat kid!

930
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:16,200
Oh shit man.
How long have you been here?

931
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,200
Buco Come on.

932
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,000
Hey Troy, what's up?

933
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,900
I have to talk to Isabelle.
Do you have her number?

934
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:56,100
Well, actually, it's...
-Hey, what's up?

935
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:01,300
Hey, what do you think about
to do something totally irresponsible.

936
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:05,900
I would not have minded.
What's on your mind?

937
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,600
Troy, I have a lot of work.
What do you need?

938
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,300
You call all the people you know.

939
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:21,800
Is there a specific reason?
-What about the amusement park or hall?

940
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,800
No? Thanks anyway.
All are booked, none of that.

941
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,500
Might still be something.

942
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:43,300
I can send you the link if you want.
Save-mobile.

943
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,400
<b> Winter clothes </ b>

944
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:21,000
This is crazy.
-Just put his head down and enjoy.

945
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:58,300
Hey, guys.
Are you jelly?

946
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,900
This is only for one night.

947
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:09,300
You'll be back and you'll go to rehab.

948
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:13,300
, no one will allow you to take the patient
no questions asked.

949
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,500
Good night, Sam.
-Good night.

950
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:18,100
Trick is to look
like you got a job

951
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:21,300
and you're in a hurry to get on with it.
It helps you cropped short.

952
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,700
If we do not come, we will have to cancel the
.

953
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,900
Do not worry, they will come.
-Are you sure?

954
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:54,100
There's a lot of people.
-You do not know my dad will come.

955
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:25,700
If you vomit, use this.
Has already been cracked.

956
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,500
Fun.

957
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,700
Do not know
looks kinda green.

958
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:43,900
No, it looks like a god.

959
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:12,400
Daddy, will arrest us for this.
-Very likely.

960
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,400
We will pass directly from the Sock Hop in the Deception, OK?

961
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:25,500
They do not know that we have
only two songs.

962
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,200
T!

963
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,400
Here . Look.

964
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:39,900
Now we're a gang.

965
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:44,000
Yes. Are you ready?

966
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,600
We'll see.

967
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,200
Go!

968
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,100
This is really cool.

969
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,800
Back from the dead,
directly from the insane asylum.

970
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,500
Under the supervision of the military police.

971
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:03,300
Ready?
