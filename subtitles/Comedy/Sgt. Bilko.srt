- Yes.

- Relax. Know where you're assigned?
- Motor pool.

- OK. Motor pool?
- Yes, I...

14
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:56,367
- You're going straight to the colonel.
- Colonel? What'd I do?

15
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,286
- How old are you, son?
- Nineteen, sir.

16
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,664
Nineteen... So young.

17
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,709
I'm a first-rate mechanic.
My two uncles owned a garage.

18

- Got any money?
- Yes, sir.

19
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,586
- Give it to me.
- But...

20
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:10,464
It's all right.

21
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:17,972
- My word, there must be $500 in here.
- 700. See, I worked at my uncle's...

22
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,892
You're going to take $700
in cash into Bilko's barracks?

23
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,896
- Yes, sir. Who, sir?
- Give me your hat, please.

24
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:30,401
Sergeant Bilko.
Master Sergeant Ernest G Bilko.

25
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:34,488
- Well, good luck. And Godspeed.
- Thank you, sir.

- You're too late, junior, no more bets.

30
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,855
- No, no, no. I'm reporting in.
- Come on, Duane! Pull!

31
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,775

32
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:19,784

Doberman's wearing the wrong shoes.

34
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,230
He's got no traction. And this horse!

35
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:53,734
This horse was not this lively this
morning. I want it drug tested now!

36
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:58,155
Someone, quick.
Get a urine bottle and a mop.

37
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,747
Hey! What's goin' on?

38
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,419
It's Private Doberman. He's the one
who looks sort of human.

39
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,672
Last night in the gym, Doberman said
"I feel as strong as a horse."

40
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:18,175
Some guy from company P overheard him
and said "Yeah? For how much?"

41
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:22,263
It's the golden rule. You don't say nothing
unless you're prepared to back it up.

42
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,935
No, no, not across the line.
Don't go across. Back. Just, back. Back.

43
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,580
- Are you OK, Duane?
- Sarge, I can't do this any more!

44
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,708
You did your best, Duane.
What's money, anyway?

45
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,712
So, Bilko, I finally won one. Pay up.

46

<i>(Bilko sighs)</i>

- Oh, so now we're on a schedule?

48
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,472
- Shall we go once more?
- Sarge! Please, no more. No more, Sarge.

49
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,932
Don't worry. I won't put you
through that again.

50
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:10,978
- He's finished. He's a loser.
- No one calls one of Bilko's men a loser.

51
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:15,274
I oughta... Hold me back! Aah.
No, no! Let me go! I'll kill him.

52
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:18,652
- You wanna double the bet?
- Double the bet? Ha! You're serious.

53
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,822
- Sarge, no.
- What's the matter, Ernie? Scared?

54
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:25,076
Sarge, please. That's all
the platoon's money-every cent.

55
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:29,580
This is beyond money now. This is
a matter of honour. OK, the bet is 1,000.

56
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,666
Sucker.

57
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,585
<i>(Bilko's men) Yeah!</i>

58

59
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,507
- Ready, Duane?
- Sure, Sarge.

60
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:43,511
See? He was just rollin' up the bet.

61
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,764
He's like a god.

62
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,362
Duane! Duane! Duane!

63
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:05,616
Duane! Duane! Duane!
Duane! Duane! Duane!

64
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,975
Yeah! Yeah!

65
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,483
Walk him around and wipe him down.

66
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,570
Not the horse! Doberman.

67
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:45,823
Listen, that M2 Bradley vehicle
is property of the US Army.

68
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:51,829
I want it back on the post by tonight.
We have rules! Rules and regulations.

69
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,833
I have your rental agreement right here.

70
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,503
And if you blow anything up,
it's coming out of your deposit.

71
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,506
Teenagers! So irresponsible.

72
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,593
- Sarge, you said I could count the take.
- She got to count it last time.

73
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,846
Will you stop fighting?
It's like I'm running a daycare centre.

74
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,600
Actually, that's not a bad idea.
We could keep 'em in the storeroom.

75
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:16,854
- Luis, how many kids on the post?
- Personal dependants under five?

76
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:19,940
- 293.
- Get me the total of their allowances.

77
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,194
- Hey, in the storeroom? Kids?
- Zimmy, they won't die.

78
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:26,364
In fact, that'll be our motto:
"They won't die."

79
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:30,451
I'll count the money. Rocky, make sure
the horse gets back to Knott's Berry Farm.

80
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:34,372
Private First Class Holbrook, Walter T,
reporting in for duty, Sergeant!

81
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,540
Sarge, Holbrook is a tech-school terror.

82
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,377
First in his class,
motor-vehicle maintenance.

83
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,629
A real live wrench-turner
in the motor pool?

84
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,384
It's so crazy, it just might work.
I'll introduce you to the boys and girls.

85
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,803
<i>- (Bilko sniffs)

86

Don't you smell it? It's money.

87
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:58,896
This is Sgt Henshaw and Sgt Barbella.
You'll see them about dances, raffles.

88
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,732
You'll get your tickets
through them. They run the shop.

89
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,820
So if you need stationery, magazines...
But not magazine subscriptions.

90
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,655
See Morales about that. Towels...

91
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:11,909
- Towels? Doesn't the army issue towels?
- Army? Get him a set of towels.

92
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,663
The fluffy ones.
The introductory price. Come on.

93
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,500
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

94

This is Dino Paparelli.
You're gonna laugh, you're gonna cry.

- Sam Fender. His motto in life is simple:

97
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:31,178

- Damn straight.

98
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,181
That's manly talk. Mickey Zimmerman.

99
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:37,768
Tragically, Zimmerman was born
without a personality.

100
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,271
- Hello.
- Luis Clemente.

101
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,024
This guy is smart, very smart.
He has an IQ.

102
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:46,027
- Hello.
- See what I mean?

103
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:48,946
Tony Morales. The only thing
you need to know about him...

104
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:52,033
...is he doesn't take showers
because it fogs up the mirror.

105
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:56,996
Finally, the man of the hour, the master
of disaster, the king of the universe -

106
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:01,709
...look out, girls, he hates to dine alone -
Private Duane Doberman!

107
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:02,960
Aw, Sarge.

108
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,924
Doberman doesn't take showers either,
but for a much more frightening reason.

109
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,719
My orders, Sergeant.

110
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:15,056
Everything seems to be in order.
Henshaw will take your bags.

111
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,141
Don't worry, he's bonded. Got a licence?

112
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,643
- A driver's licence?
- We can make one up.

113
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,314
- Henshaw, get the camera!
- No, no. I have a licence. It's right here.

114
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,900
My wallet.

115
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:29,820
Oh, here it is. Empty.
It's in your hat, isn't it?

116
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:35,993
Good boy. Oh. Oh, there must be six...
no, seven hundred dollars in here. Good.

117
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:39,622
Well, you can start with this.
The colonel's car.

118
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,333
- OK, what's wrong with it?
- It's the odometer.

119
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,045
It says 12,000 miles,
and it should say 11,000 miles.

120
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,924
Tony drove it to Lake Tahoe
to go to his grandmother's funeral.

121
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,426
- I'm sorry.
- When I say that...

122
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:58,265
...I mean "visit his niece". And
when I say "niece", I mean lady friend?

123
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:02,019
Look. I'm winking. Look at my eye.

124
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,690
<i>- You want me to turn that back?
- (gasps) Yes.</i>

125
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:09,443
- I can't do that, Sergeant.
- "Can't"! He said "can't"!

126
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,696
Sarge, are you all right?

127
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:15,074
Hey, man, "can't" is a four-letter word
in this platoon.

128
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,785
I cannot violate regulations,
unless it's an order...

129
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:22,039
...in which case I would have to ask
Master Sergeant Bilko to sign said order.

130
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,543
I'm asking you to do Tony here a favour.
We're all like family here.

131
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,753
Any one of these men
would take a bullet for you.

132
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:31,882
- Well, not in the chest.
- No, not in the chest, but in the thigh.

133
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:36,512
- Permission to speak freely?
- What, are we in Russia? Say anything.

134
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,181
You're soldiers. Guardians of freedom.

135
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:44,562
And frankly, I don't think there's a man
here taking his service oath seriously.

136
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:47,398
You know what? I'm gonna kill him.

00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,104
<i>My curiosity runnin' wild</i>

147
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:30,775
<i>Cruisin' and playin' the radio</i>

148
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,612
<i>With no particular place to go</i>

149
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:38,282
<i>Ridin' along in my automobile</i>

150
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:41,952
<i>I was anxious to tell her the way I feel</i>

151
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:45,623
<i>So I told her softly and sincere</i>

152
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:49,543
<i>And she leaned and whispered in my ear</i>

153
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,297
<i>Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow</i>

154
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:54,548
<i>With no particular place to go</i>

155
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:59,220
- Sarge, where can we hide the horse?
- What horse?

156
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,561
All right, men! Faster.
The army needs these vehicles.

157
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,650
Bilko?

158
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,987
Sergeant.

159
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,989
Sergeant Bilko!

160
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,910
Fall in, men, now! And get
into a semicircle or a rectangle, now!

161
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:25,579
Hut! Hey!

162
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,509
Very good. As you were.

163
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,761
He means go back to
what you were doing.

164
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:44,265
Colonel Hall, you look fantastic, sir.
Have you lost weight?

165
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:47,184
Why, a couple of pounds maybe.

166
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,270
Nell and I have been
"sweating to the oldies".

167
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:52,690
- Ah.
- Sergeant, I'm here to see about my car.

168
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,443
Ah, well, I'm afraid
we're still working on it, sir.

169
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:59,280
- You've had it a week and a half.
- I thought I saw it on Interstate 30.

170
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:02,616
There. Thank God I have a witness.
Thank you, Captain Moon.

171
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,536
And the colonel thinks
I never test-drive the vehicles.

172
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:07,705
What is that?

173
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:11,208
That's horse shit, sir. I tell the men
"You have to test-drive..."

174
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,961
- What's it doing there?
- It keeps the flies off the food.

175
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,881
There's no way you can tell
what's wrong with an engine...

176
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:18,966
- Off the food?
- It's an experiment.

177
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,636
I'd say the results are mixed.

178
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:30,144
It's a lot cheaper than
sending out for it, sir.

179
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,480
And fresher too.

180
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,232
Bilko, are you mental?
This is not the horse cavalry.

181
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,652
- You can't bring livestock onto the post.
- You're right, sir.

182
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,406
You heard the colonel. Assemble horse
platoon and get the horse out of here!

183
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:47,912
- All right, double-time, soldier.
- Sergeant, please, tell me about my car.

184
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,164
- Do you know anything about cars, sir?
- No.

185
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:54,835
Ah. Well, you see that
sort of pointy thing right there?

186
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:59,256
It seems that it's impinging on the
browned, round thing with the spots.

187
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,761
- You see, when Henry Ford first...
- Colonel Hall.

188
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:06,681
- Corporal, what is it?
- Permission to speak privately?

189
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,100
- Of course. Excuse me, Bilko.
- Absolutely.

190
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,769
- What is it, Corporal?
- The Pentagon called.

191
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:14,855
The Pentagon?
How did they get my number?

192
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:18,776
They're sending a team
to observe tomorrow's hovertank test.

193
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:23,781
- Why? It's just a preliminary... Aah.
- What is it, sir?

194
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:27,535
Well, they're closing
a lot of military facilities lately.

195
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:29,870
What if they're planning
to close Fort Baxter?

196
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,873
- Do you know anything about this?
- You flatter me.

197
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,962
- How could l, a mere master sergeant...?
- You know everything before I do.

198
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:43,050
I'm sure it's just routine, sir.
Anyway, come back any time. Call first.

199
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:46,887
I tell you, men, serving under
a great leader like Colonel Hall...

200
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,806
- He's gone.
- I'm hungry. What time is it?

201
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:51,142
12 o'clock. We ordered Chinese.

202
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,895
- Pentagon brass, Sarge? I don't like it.
- Relax. It's just army stuff.

203
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,732
It's got nothing to do with us.

204
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,151
- Did you say 12 o'clock?
- Yeah.

205
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,486
- Today's Saturday?
- All day.

206
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:08,242
Saturday at noon. I have a strange feeling
I'm supposed to be somewhere.

207
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,245
Hmm.

208
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,331
<i>(organ plays)</i>

209
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:16,250
I'll kill him.

210
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:26,927
- Poker game?
- No, no.

211
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:31,349
- Racetrack.
- No, no. It was something else.

212
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:35,186
<i>(sighs)</i>

213
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:37,938
My, that's a lovely dress.

214
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,358
- Thank you, Reverend.
- Is it new?

215
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:44,111
No, I wore it the last time
the lying shit-heel stood me up.

216
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,446
Ah.

217
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:48,699

00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,304
Give me the ring.
You were the best man last time.

220
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:13,391
- He didn't get married last time!
- It's my turn!

221
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:18,229
- How you gonna be best man?
- Just give me the ring!

222
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:24,318
- But you can't hate him, you know?
- I can hate him. I hate him right now.

223
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:27,154
Sweetheart...

224
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:30,324
Where are you going? Nobody leave.

225
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:36,580
You came to see me get married. You're
going to - I don't particularly care who to.

226
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:39,333
Sweetheart! I know you're upset...

227
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,087
Daddy, stay out of this.
I know what I'm doing.

228
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:44,755
- Nelson.
- Huh?

229
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,842
Are you busy? Will you
marry me? I love you.

230
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:51,262
I just never realised it until now.

231
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:56,183
Well, the thing is, Rita,
I'm engaged... to your sister.

232
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,603
And?

233
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:07,028
<i>(bell tolls)</i>

234
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:17,204
Don't ask. Don't even ask.

00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,875
OK, ask.

00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,377
Bunny face,
you won't believe what happened.

237
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:28,799
There was this busload of sweet geriatrics.
They went rolling down a mountain side...

238
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,218
Do you think I'm an idiot?

239
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:37,391
Ask Wally. He's new, a real straight arrow,
never told a lie in his life. Wally?

240
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:40,019
See?

241
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,396
Sweetheart, sweetheart...

242
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,066
Oh, baby... angel puff, you're overreacting!

243
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:49,487
- You know, it's... Ooh! Bad turnout.
- It was full an hour ago.

244
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:53,407
<i>Oh, sweetie, I... (gasps) I'm well!</i>

245

Sweetie, what can I do
to make it up to you?

246
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:58,120
Whaddaya want? Just tell me.
I'll do anything.

247
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,456
I've been waiting for seven years.

248
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:05,169
What do I want? I want my seven years
back. I can't live like this, Ernie.

249
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,922
I've got a maid of honour
on call 24 hours a day.

250
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:13,010
And I'm the only woman with a wedding
dress that's falling apart from wear.

251
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:16,222
- I'm sorry.
- I think you love me, Ernie.

252
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:20,518
But you're so slippery, it's impossible
to know what you're thinking.

253
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:22,520
Well, thank you.

254
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:26,023
I don't understand
what you're so afraid of.

255
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,943
You know what I wanna do
right here, right now?

256
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,612
No. Don't.

257
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:37,201
No. No, not this time.

258
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:41,205
- Don't, please.
- One game, to 500.

259
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,792
Don't. Please don't.

260
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,379
Spade. It's a double.

261
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:51,632
Triple boxes, to 500. Penny a point.

262
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,552
- A four?
- Yes.

263
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:59,724
Oh, two. Yeah. Come on. Here. Go, go, go.

264
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,151
What's up?

265
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:15,031
Well, Rocky and I were talkin' to Wally
while you and Rita were in the church.

266
00:19:15,156 --> 00:19:17,825
She's a nice girl.
We don't like the way you treat her.

267
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:20,369
He's right, Sarge.
You treat her like a rube.

268
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,664
- Wouldn't you be happier in the navy?
- You jilted that girl.

269
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:26,083
She'll probably have to
move to another town.

270
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,961
Will you relax? Rita and I
have a special relationship.

271
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,173
You think she expected me
to marry her today? Of course not.

272
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,176
She expected me to do
just what I did. It's a game.

273
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:39,347
Someday you might lose that game, Ernie.

274
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:03,621
Very good, men. Make sure it's tight.

275
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:06,457
- Tight?
- Whatever.

276
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,710
So, Major Ebersole,
tomorrow's the big day.

277
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:13,631
- How's she look?
- I hope it won't be too humiliating, sir.

278
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,383
What's supposed to happen?

279
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:19,720
Well, theoretically,
and I wouldn't bet the farm...

280
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,226
...the hovertank will lift off and hover
several inches above the pond.

281
00:20:25,393 --> 00:20:29,230
- Good. Very good.
- Yeah. Then it will engage the targets...

282
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:33,067
...the... the cannon. Boom.
The ammunition dump. Kaboom.

283
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:35,444
That truck. Boom.

284
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:39,657
Excellent. One thought.
Maybe it should be: boom, boom...

285
00:20:39,824 --> 00:20:42,660
<i>... then kaboom.</i>

286
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:46,998
You know, save that "kaboom" for the very
last? Kind of like a "hoo-ah" grand finale.

287
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:50,084
What do you think?

288
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:54,714
- I'll make a note of it, sir.
- Good.

289
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:58,259
- Missed me. Now run!
- Ow!

290
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:00,845
- Yeah. Gotcha.
- Hey, there goes the sarge, man.

291
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,180
Sarge!

292
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,767
- Hey, Dobie, come on, let's go.
- Sarge, you get married yet?

293
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:09,979
- Not yet.
- How did Rita take it this time?

294
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:12,273
Oh, she's happy. She took
40 bucks off me in a gin game.

295
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,691
Oh, she's great!

296
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:17,194
Paparelli. How's tickets goin' for the
"Meet Stormin' Norman" barbecue?

297
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:19,447
- It's a sellout, Sarge.
- Find a lookalike?

298
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,365
- We found one.
- Ahh.

299
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:25,286
No wonder they call me
a master sergeant.

300
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:27,621
You know, things weren't
always this good.

301
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:32,001
When I first got my stripes at Fort Dix,
I considered it my responsibility...

302
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:37,965
...to provide the hardworking men and
women with some wholesome recreation.

303
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:41,469
- You ran the gambling.
- That's right, Fender.

304
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:46,640
But there was this lieutenant there -
Lieutenant Colin Thorn.

305
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:52,980
<i>A lunatic. I mean, real smooth on
the outside, but underneath, barbed wire.</i>

306
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,982
<i>He rode me like a jockey.</i>

307
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:57,985
<i>Pools, raffles, card games -
I couldn't do anything.</i>

308
00:21:58,194 --> 00:22:01,572
<i>It was like being in the army.</i>

309
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:06,077
<i>(Bilko) All right, come on, baby. Let's go!</i>

310
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:08,996
Hi.

311
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:12,583
<i>Finally, I got a break. They held
the division boxing finals at our post.</i>

312
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,045
<i>You couldn't stop people
from betting on it.</i>

313
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:19,507
<i>It was a toss-up.
Now, to me, that's just sloppy.</i>

314
00:22:19,674 --> 00:22:25,930
I like a sporting event in which I know the
outcome beforehand. It's more organised.

315
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:29,850
<i>(bike bell rings)</i>

316
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,022
<i>I get to one of the pugilists
and we reach a business accommodation.</i>

317
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,108
<i>For a 50-50 split of our winnings...</i>

318
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,778
<i>... he agrees to give less than
a supreme effort in the squared circle.</i>

319
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:45,866
<i>- (Rocky) You paid him to take a dive.
- (Bilko) 0f course.</i>

320
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:50,871
<i>I had this corporal
working for me - Leo Cletz.</i>

321
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:02,800
<i>The night of the fight, I give him
the money to pay off my fighter.</i>

322
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:08,472
<i>Leo misunderstands and gives
the money to the other fighter.</i>

323
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:14,145
<i>This fighter's surprised, but figures "What
the heck? It's a good price. I'll go down."</i>

324
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:17,565
Meanwhile, my guy figures
"Bilko meant I'll get the money later."

325
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:21,402
- "No problem. I'll go down anyway."
- So both think they're takin' a dive?

326
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:24,155
- Exactly.
- What happened?

327
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:27,074
Boxing history.

328
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:55,686
<i>For three rounds, nobody hit anybody.
It was a dance recital.</i>

329
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:17,875
<i>Finally, I think out of boredom,
one of the guys connected with a right.</i>

330
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:23,798
What the hell's goin' on here?

331
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:27,218
<i>Lieutenant Thorn took it
as a personal insult.</i>

332
00:24:27,385 --> 00:24:31,138
- You OK? Did it hurt?
- Very cute.

333
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,234
<i>It looked like Thorn
was paying off the fighter.</i>

334
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:44,985
<i>He was cooked.</i>

335
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:49,740
<i>They didn't have enough evidence for a
court martial, but sent him to Greenland.</i>

336
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:58,749
<i>Game, set and match - Bilko.</i>

337
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,419
- Some story, huh?
- Permission to speak freely?

338
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:05,840
- Again, permission. OK.
- You dealt with him very dishonestly.

339
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:08,426
Never mind that.
What happened to him? Thorn.

340
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:13,097
I don't know. I don't know
what happened to him.

341
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:35,786
Colonel John Hall, garrison commander.
Welcome to Fort Baxter, Major.

342
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:43,627
<i>(bugle plays reveille)</i>

00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:02,980
Doberman! Wake up!

Come on, everyone!
Up and at 'em!

349
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,437
<i>(all groan)</i>

350
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:47,024
Come on, guys, let's not miss
one minute of this beautiful day.

351
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:49,527
Hey!

352
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:53,114
- Get outta here!
- I'll get the sarge!

353
00:26:53,364 --> 00:26:55,950
That's it. Now you guys
gonna be in trouble.

354
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:58,869
<i>(reveille)</i>

355
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,876
- Hey, Sarge! Get up.
- What's the matter?

356
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:11,632
Everybody take cover! Gather all the men!
Man the battle stations and...

357
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:14,885
What's that music?

358
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,734
I understand, Major, this weapon system
is in the experimental stage.

359
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:33,487
But I think you'll be very impressed
with the... noise it produces.

360
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:36,407
It's a powerful piece of equipment.

361
00:27:36,574 --> 00:27:40,077
Colonel, I really urge you
not to go ahead with this.

362
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:42,997
Ah, Major Ebersole, Major Thorn.

363
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:46,000
Major Ebersole is the brain
behind the hovertank.

364
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,004
<i>He's the one really responsible.</i>

365
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:52,506
- Thank you, sir.
- Can we get on with this?

366
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:54,925
Of course. You good to go?

367
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:58,596
All right. Let's light this candle.

368
00:27:58,763 --> 00:28:01,015
Hoo-ah!

369
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:07,188
You know, with all the base closings and
downsizing, people here have been jumpy.

370
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:09,690
Ready, Colonel.

371
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:13,277
<i>(Hall) This is exciting.</i>

372
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,957
OK, start her up.

373
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:37,385
<i>(rattling)</i>

374
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:49,230
It still needs work.

375
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:10,084
Fire.

376
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:17,008
Of course.

377
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,595
Get out! Watch out!

378
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:55,546
Let's go, campers! It's 10am.
Time to start the day.

379
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:59,467
- Mornin', Sarge.
- It's that time of the decade.

380
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,552
- You're taking a shower.
- Do I have to?

381
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:06,724
Everyone feels pretty strongly about it.
Here's the petition.

382
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:09,477
Aw, Sarge.

383
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:14,148
Why are you sitting there?
You were full of energy at 6am.

384
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:16,150
I don't think the guys like me.

385
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:19,653
- Oh? What makes you say that?
- They wrote me a note.

386
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,325
"Wally, we don't like you."
And they all signed it.

387
00:30:25,743 --> 00:30:29,330
- Yeah, that's Doberman's "X".
- Can I please have another roommate?

388
00:30:29,497 --> 00:30:31,415
- Why, what's the matter?
- He wet his bed.

389
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:37,004
- Oh, well, once in a while.
- No. He did it from across the room.

390
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:41,592
Major, please! At least
won't you stay for lunch?

391
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,178
- Do you like chicken casserole?
- No.

392
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,764
Well, Major, let me be frank.

393
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:50,434
A negative report from you would be
the death knell for Fort Baxter.

394
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:53,938
- We've been in a slump...
- Nine years without a successful test?

395
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:56,357
That's not a slump, that's a tradition.

396
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,528
But, Major, think for a minute
about the men, their careers.

397
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:03,364
<i>- My career.
- Colonel, you play the hand you're dealt.</i>

398
00:31:03,531 --> 00:31:06,200
This isn't the career
I had in mind when I got out of OCS.

399
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,036
Shining a seat with my ass in DC,
visiting dumpy posts.

400
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,706
I thought I'd be a colonel by now
or maybe a general.

401
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:15,793
Sorry. What I saw today was a dust cloud
that cost $70 million. Good morning.

402
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,631
Wait! There's a lot more to
Fort Baxter than just R&D, Major.

403
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:23,801
- We have an award-winning commissary.
- Try the casserole.

404
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:26,220
And our softball team won
the division title.

405
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:29,056
And Sergeant Bilko's platoon
is in the glee club finals.

406
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:32,977
I'll certainly keep that in mind.

407
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:43,070
Did you say Bilko?

408
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:45,156
Yeah.

409
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,492
<i>Is that Ernie Bilko?</i>

410
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,495
One and the same.

411
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:53,998
Maybe I will stay for lunch.

412
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:57,501
Well, hoo-ah! Ignite that
chicken casserole, Captain Moon!

413
00:31:57,668 --> 00:32:00,087
Yes, sir!

414
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:17,104
Now, where did that one go?

415
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:33,120
- Hey, you're eight over par, Sarge!
- Well, fix it.

416
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:36,290
- Sarge, they let you do this?
- I never asked. They'd say no.

417
00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:37,875
It is an army post.

418
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:40,961
<i>(dog barking)</i>

419
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,719
All right, I got 5-1 on Lover's Knot.

420
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:52,973
- $20 says I can hit the parking lot.
- I don't gamble.

421
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,393
<i>- What is it you do do?
- Permission to speak...</i>

422
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,228
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

423
00:32:57,395 --> 00:33:01,065
I get up every morning and I get dressed
to protect the American way of life.

424
00:33:01,232 --> 00:33:05,319
Would you tell me that later tonight
so I don't have to take a sleeping pill?

425

<i>(Thorn) Bilko!</i>

<i>(whispers) It can't be.</i>

427
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:12,576
Lieutenant Thorn.

428
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:17,665
- Actually, it's Major Thorn now.
- Well, congratulations.

429
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:22,670
I didn't know you were still in the service.
I'd have looked you up long ago.

430
00:33:22,837 --> 00:33:23,754
I'll bet.

431
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:27,925
Tell me, Colonel, is he still
the same rascal he was at Fort Dix?

432
00:33:28,092 --> 00:33:30,928
- That's one way of putting it.
- You changed my life.

433
00:33:31,095 --> 00:33:33,848
Remember that little boxing match?

434
00:33:34,015 --> 00:33:35,933
Boxing match... Hmm.

435
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,104
That made me a new man. You remember
how stiff and uptight I used to be?

436
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:43,107
Thanks to him, I realised
you can't treat people that way.

437
00:33:43,274 --> 00:33:45,693
I'm a better man for it. Thanks, Ernie.

438
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,113
<i>- Sure.

439
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,032
- What was that?
- Greyhounds, sir.

440
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,701
- How long will you be with us, Major?
- Not long.

441
00:33:53,868 --> 00:33:56,370
Colonel, what do you say
we have that casserole?

442
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:59,373
Absolutely, and some jellied yams as well.

443
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,709
Ha.

444
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:09,300
Let's get back to the barracks and cancel
everything-dances, raffles, everything.

445
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:34,575
God, I forgot it's the play-offs!

446
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:37,328
Sarge! Here's the money
from the blade rentals.

447
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:41,499
Stop, stop! Put that away!
Stop, everyone! Stop!

448
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:45,169
<i>Ridin' along in my automobile</i>

449
00:34:45,336 --> 00:34:48,756
<i>My baby beside me at the wheel</i>

450
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:52,426
<i>I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile</i>

451
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:55,846
It's Hall with Major Thorn.
Looks like a surprise inspection.

452
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:59,934
An inspection? Now? Look at this place!

453
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:02,603
<i>- ETA, 90 seconds.
- (Bilko) Think. Think.</i>

454
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,356
I've got to think. Where's Alpha company?

455
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:07,441
Field exercises.

456
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:11,278
<i>So we parked way out on the Kokomo</i>

457
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:14,699
<i>The night was young
and the moon was gold</i>

458
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:18,869
<i>So we both decided to take a stroll</i>

459
00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:22,373
<i>Can you imagine the way I felt?</i>

460
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:26,043
<i>I couldn't unfasten her safety belt</i>

461
00:35:26,252 --> 00:35:29,797
<i>Cruisin' and playin' the radio</i>

462
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:33,718
<i>With no particular place to go</i>

463
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,730
Um, which way are we...

464
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,315
...facing here?

465
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:52,737
Uh, well... it would
have to be this one here.

466
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:58,034
Over hill, over dale
we have hit the dusty trail

467
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:01,704
As those caissons go rolling along

468
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:05,750
And it's hi, hi, hee in the field artillery

469
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:08,085
<i>(Hall) Bilko.</i>

470
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:11,088
Ten-hut, platoon!

471
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:16,677
- Major Thorn wants to see the barracks.
- An inspection?

472
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:19,430
I wish we had a little more time.
We're not prepared.

473
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:23,517
It just gives me a thrill to see what a
first-rate top kick can do with a platoon.

474
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:26,604
- Why don't they stand by their rooms?
- Certainly. Sergeant?

475
00:36:26,771 --> 00:36:30,524
Really, sir, if the glee club misses
practice, I won't be responsible...

476
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:34,945
- I said now!
- Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut!

477
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,455
- Is this your room, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

478
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:47,124
Follow me.

479
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,761
Who's this?

480
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,308
<i>It's the cast of my favourite TV show, sir:
The African-American Hour.</i>

481
00:37:04,517 --> 00:37:06,602
Oh? I've never heard of it.

482
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:11,732
It's on cable. See, it's funny,
but it also makes you think.

483
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:15,444
Ah. Hm.

484
00:37:41,012 --> 00:37:43,931
<i>(toy squeaks)</i>

485
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:54,025
Are these yours?

486
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:59,864
It is my understanding that you can
no longer ask me these questions, sir.

487
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:02,908
It's a new army, Major.

488
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:06,120
We're all adjusting.

489
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:17,757
<i>(sniffs)</i>

490
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:22,386
- Whose bunk is this?
- Uh, mine, sir.

491
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,390
- That corner is not squared off!
- What? I told you to make this bunk!

492
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:31,979
Now, I don't want any of your excuses!
Now, drop and give me 20! Ha!

493
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:35,316
<i>(grunts)</i>

494
00:38:35,483 --> 00:38:38,903
All right. One. We're going for one.

495
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,238
Colonel, you're a very courageous man.

496
00:38:41,322 --> 00:38:44,492
Oh! I saw a little combat duty in Kor...

497
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:46,577
Courageous? What do you mean?

498
00:38:46,744 --> 00:38:50,247
Thumbing your nose at army regulations.
But I guess your men come first.

499
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:53,584
- And 20.
- My men? First?

500
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,879
- What does he mean, Bilko?
- This soldier, sir.

501
00:38:57,004 --> 00:39:00,675
I'd say he's about 50 pounds
over his maximum allowable weight.

502
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:04,512
What are the chances of that being
discovered and your being blamed?

503
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,430
Blamed?

504
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:09,433
Sergeant, I want him
at regulation weight in six weeks.

505
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,103
Yes, sir!

506
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:29,954
Adelaide, of course
we'll get married, sooner or later.

507
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:34,542
Nathan Detroit, after 14 years,
it is already too late to be sooner.

508
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:39,046
I'm from Rhode Island, where people
do not remain engaged for 14 years.

509
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:43,884
- They get married.
- Then why is it such a small state?

510
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,637
Miss Robbins. I don't get it.

511
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:51,100
Why would Adelaide stick around if he,
like, disses her all the time?

512
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:53,936
Doesn't she have any self-esteem?

513
00:39:54,145 --> 00:39:58,149
Well, that's a very interesting question.

514
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:02,653
<i>- (Bilko) Certainly is.
- Ernie! What are you doing here?</i>

515
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,739
- Did you get the flowers I sent ya?
- No.

516
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:08,326
Darn. I'll call FedEx
and have 'em put a trace on it.

517
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:11,662
That's right, sweetheart.
Nathan's a hustler.

518
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:14,665
He's irresponsible,
and he's careless with the truth.

519
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,669
But the one thing he never lies about
is how much he cares for Adelaide.

520
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:21,255
See, that's his core, and she knows it.

521
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:26,677
OK, let's take a break for ten minutes.
And that was really good.

522
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:29,388
Wonderful.

523
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:38,022
Ernie, I've been thinking, and I don't think
we should see each other any more.

524
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:41,025
Sweetheart, you promised to go
to the Rusty Spur with me.

525
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,279
- You never give up, do you?
- Come on. Come on, sweetheart...

526
00:40:45,446 --> 00:40:49,950
...go to the Rusty Spur with me.
It'd be like old times.

527
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:54,789
All right, but you've got 30 days.
If this finger is still naked in 30 days...

528
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:57,708
...it's adios, Pepe.

529
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:02,213
I mean it this time.
This is your last chance.

530
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:30,408
Major. I'm Lieutenant Oster and this is...

531
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:34,745
Lieutenant Monday. We're here
from the Inspector General's Office, sir.

532
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:39,333
I asked for the best number crunchers
in the army! I hope that's what they sent!

533
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:42,670
- If there's been any malfeasance...
- Or embezzlement...

534
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:43,963
We will find it.

535
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:47,758
This guy we're going after's
been feeding off the khaki tit for years.

536
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:52,763
He's a master sergeant.
His name is Ernie Bilko. Get him!

537
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:58,310
- Forget it, Bilko.
- But, sir, the moment my boys heard...

538
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:01,147
...about the desert manoeuvre,
they volunteered.

539
00:42:01,272 --> 00:42:04,191
We still haven't got over
being left out of Desert Storm.

540
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:06,777
How the orders got crisscrossed,
I'll never know.

541
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:10,781
But if we could go on these manoeuvres,
it would make up, in some small way...

542
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:12,783
You must think I'm a nincompoop.

543
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:15,745
A nincompoop? An NCP?
On the contrary, sir.

544
00:42:15,953 --> 00:42:18,289
- I think you're one of the finest...
- Las Vegas.

545
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:21,125
- What, sir?
- The desert manoeuvre will take place...

546
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,586
...15 miles from Las Vegas, Nevada.

547
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:26,464
Really? I had no idea. Won't that be fun?

548
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,885
- Lake Mead, Hoover Dam.
- Forget it. You've got bigger problems.

549
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:35,139
Two hatchet men -
excuse me, hatchet persons -

550
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:38,809
...from the Inspector General's Office
came to audit the motor pool accounts.

551
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:43,397
- I wonder who tipped them off?
- Yes, I wonder.

552
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:46,651
<i>(woman) Fort Baxter. How may I
direct your call? Motor pool?</i>

553
00:42:46,776 --> 00:42:51,572
Listen, Bilko, I might tell you this whole
post is skating on thin ice with hot blades.

554
00:42:51,822 --> 00:42:53,741
Don't let them find anything.

555
00:42:53,908 --> 00:42:56,827
- Is the colonel suggesting a cover-up?
- A cover-up?

556
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:00,873
Why, no. Is there... anything to cover up?

557
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:03,459
No... sir.

558
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:07,630
Good. Then I'm not suggesting one.

559
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:12,927
Just do... whatever it is you do
to make these things go away.

560
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:17,264
<i>I can't help myself</i>

561
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:20,142
<i>Bad habits</i>

562
00:43:20,518 --> 00:43:23,270
<i>I'm runnin' wild</i>

563
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:26,273
<i>Lost control</i>

564
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:29,777
<i>Well, I must confess</i>

565
00:43:29,944 --> 00:43:33,197
<i>Cos I can't repress</i>

566
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:37,201
In the last two months you
billed the army for 72 windshields?

567
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:40,496
That was a mistake.
One of my men, Private Buttersworth...

568
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:42,832
...had a hairline crack in his glasses.

569
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,792
- A crack?
- Yes, a hairline crack.

570
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:47,878
So to him, it looked like
all the windshields were broken.

571
00:43:48,045 --> 00:43:50,715
I transferred him right out.
That's the way I am.

572
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:56,137
She's crazy about you. Every time
you're not looking, she stares.

573
00:43:58,973 --> 00:44:01,976
You just missed it.

574
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:11,485
Sergeant, in the past two days we've
found a number of possible irregularities.

575
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:15,948
- Now, if you can't produce receipts...
- She's staring at you again.

576
00:44:16,157 --> 00:44:18,409
Oh, just missed it!

577
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:20,328
There.

578
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:23,497
<i>... that a boy like me</i>

579
00:44:23,581 --> 00:44:27,126
<i>Has got so many bad habits</i>

580
00:44:29,587 --> 00:44:33,382
<i>I said, all of these bad habits</i>

581
00:44:36,594 --> 00:44:40,014
<i>All of these bad habits</i>

582
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,856
<i>(bells ring)</i>

583
00:44:52,026 --> 00:44:53,736
Nothing? You found nothing?

584
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:56,322
All my training tells me
he's hiding something.

585
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,200
Every time we're about to
find something...

586
00:44:59,367 --> 00:45:02,870
It dissolves. - It's like trying
to nail Jell-O to the wall.

587
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:06,749
- No. It's like watching a magician.
- He's got you watching his left hand...

588
00:45:06,957 --> 00:45:09,710
And his right hand keeps pullin' rabbits!

589
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,547
Well, then, let's tie his hands.

590
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:17,301
Ernie, will you dance with me tonight?

591
00:45:17,468 --> 00:45:20,721
That's up to you. Last time,
I accidentally stepped on your knee.

592
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:23,224
- What if they play our song?
- We have a song?

593
00:45:23,307 --> 00:45:25,393
Don't you remember the first time we...?

594
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:27,895
Only you

595
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:30,982
How could I forget our song?
When they play it tonight...

596
00:45:31,065 --> 00:45:35,403
...you and I will dance the most romantic
dance we've ever danced in our entire life.

597
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:40,157
- You promise?
- That's a promise from Ernest G Bilko.

598
00:45:41,075 --> 00:45:44,662
Put some drive in your country

599
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:48,082
Keep country drivin' on

600
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:53,671
When the music gets you movin'

601
00:45:54,005 --> 00:45:55,840
You know it can't be long

602
00:45:56,007 --> 00:45:59,760
Baby, this is our night. Just us. Just
you and me. All night long. No soldiers.

603
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:02,013
- What do you wanna do?
- Let's shoot some pool.

604
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:06,100
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, Sarge. You're late!

605
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:11,772
- We want to celebrate the audit with ya.
- Those bean counters didn't have a clue.

606
00:46:12,023 --> 00:46:16,027
I know, I know. Sometimes
I'm so damn good I scare myself.

607
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:18,779
Just us, huh?

608
00:46:20,698 --> 00:46:24,118
If you see her out tonight

609
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:29,040
And she tells you
that it's just the lights

610
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:32,043
That bring her here

611
00:46:32,293 --> 00:46:35,379
And not her loneliness

612
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,719
That's what she says...

613
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:45,973
- I'll go get us a couple of drinks.
- OK.

614
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:57,485
...every word she says

615
00:46:57,735 --> 00:47:01,072
A scorpion and a brandy alexander.

616
00:47:01,238 --> 00:47:04,075
That's what she says...

617
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:06,494
The future
Mrs "Permission to Speak Freely"?

618
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:10,665
Oh, no. I mean, I don't know her.
I never even... I don't know her.

619
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:13,668
<i>(music ends)</i>

620
00:47:14,335 --> 00:47:18,089
Thank you very much, everybody.
we'll be back in just a couple of minutes.

621
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:20,091
- I'll introduce ya.
- You know her?

622
00:47:20,257 --> 00:47:22,510
- No.
- She's with someone.

623
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:25,179
A detail.

624
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:31,352
- Ah, you must be in Bravo company.
- No, Charlie company.

625
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,771
- Charlie Company! Haven't you heard?
- What?

626
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:36,440
You're shipping out -
Operation Vacuum Cleaner.

627
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,776
- Operation...
- Shh!

628
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:42,113
I want his name. I want it known
that in this moment of crisis...

629
00:47:42,363 --> 00:47:44,865
...this man chose to sit here
and eat bar nuts.

630
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:50,037
- I didn't know!
- Go ye into the night! Hut, hut, hut, hut!

631
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:54,542
All right. Now I'll settle this.

632
00:47:54,709 --> 00:47:56,711
- Hmm.
- Excuse me?

633
00:47:56,877 --> 00:48:00,464
You were right. Those are
the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.

634
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:02,383
- Did he say that?
- Oh, yeah.

635
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:06,053
He said your eyes were like diamonds
sparkling on a summer night.

636
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:10,558
The old sergeant's eyes didn't see what
he saw. Anyway, here's the $20 I bet you.

637
00:48:10,808 --> 00:48:15,479
I think the least you can do is sit down
and buy this young lady some dinner.

638
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:18,482
Sit down and buy dinner! Go! Hey!

639
00:48:18,649 --> 00:48:21,485
Ah, to be young again.

640
00:48:21,652 --> 00:48:25,072
- That's my sergeant.
- Oh.

641
00:48:30,745 --> 00:48:33,247
Oh! Major Ebersole, boys.
Welcome to the Spur.

642
00:48:33,414 --> 00:48:37,668
Oh, I've been here before.
Uh... five years ago.

643
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:40,671
I had... a scotch and soda.

644
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:43,591
Good. A place like this
depends on repeat business.

645
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:48,763
They're repainting our club, so we had to
move our weekly poker game down here.

646
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:52,933
Poker. I've heard wonderful things
about that game. Can I watch?

647
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,270
- You don't play poker?
- I'm pretty busy at the motor pool...

648
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,609
...up to my elbows in grease. Maybe
I could join... Oh, no, there's a problem.

649
00:49:01,776 --> 00:49:03,861
I don't have any change.

650
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:07,365
We can make change. It's OK.

651
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:11,535
Oh, goody. I get to play cards.

652
00:49:11,786 --> 00:49:15,456
<i>... long way home just to think of an alibi</i>

653
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:18,709
<i>Well, I couldn't think of a dozen things</i>

654
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:20,044
<i>That hadn't already...</i>

655
00:49:20,211 --> 00:49:24,215
- Get you somethin'?
- Scotch, rocks. Good-looking woman.

656
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:26,884
That's Bilko's girl.

657
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:30,388
Now she looks even better.

658
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:34,141
I'm dealing you five cards.

659
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:36,727
- Five cards. Let me write this down.
- Yeah, OK.

660
00:49:36,894 --> 00:49:40,064
Now, the worst hand that you can have...

661
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:43,985
...is if you only have one high card
and nothing else that matches.

662
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:48,906
- But then comes a pair.
- A pair. How exciting. A pair.

663
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:52,743
<i>(applause)</i>

Oh, thanks. Have you seen Ernie?

667
00:50:07,675 --> 00:50:09,927
- No, I haven't.
- Will you hold this a second?

668
00:50:10,011 --> 00:50:12,930
- Sure.
- Thanks.

669
00:50:15,016 --> 00:50:17,268
Excuse me. Have you guys seen Ernie?

670
00:50:17,435 --> 00:50:20,021
- No.
- No.

671
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:22,606
Ernie?

672
00:50:23,024 --> 00:50:24,275
Ernie!

673
00:50:24,442 --> 00:50:27,611
I have three jacks and two sixes.
What's that called again?

674
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:31,782
- A full house.
- What a cute name. A full house.

675
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:36,120
- Is that good?
- Yes, that means you win.

676
00:50:36,454 --> 00:50:40,291
- Again.
- Oh, God, this is almost embarrassing.

677
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,793
What is that? Five in a row?

678
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,297
What a lovely watch.
Now, let's see. We'll just shuffle.

679
00:50:46,464 --> 00:50:49,216
Oops. Clumsy me.

680
00:50:49,717 --> 00:50:52,053
- OK. Cut? Thank you.
- Hey!

681
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:55,222
Sorry. All right. OK.

682
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:02,647
You are my destiny

683
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:07,735
Oh. You hear that song?
It means I gotta go.

684
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:13,908
Gee, I feel bad.
Can't I give some of this back?

685
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:17,244
No, that would be wrong, wouldn't it?

686
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:20,998
All right, well, I'll just
take these IOUs...

687
00:51:21,082 --> 00:51:26,003
...and the pink slip, and you can cash me
out and I'll see you back at the base.

688
00:51:26,087 --> 00:51:27,838
- Ernie!
- Good evening, sir.

689
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:29,674
Excuse us, Major.

690
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,929
Listen, I don't know why, but the colonel's
decided to climb all over your sorry butt.

691
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:37,264
I'm afraid the party's over, Ernie.

692
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:42,269
Get back to the post. I'd like to see your
men on the parade ground at 0500 hours.

693
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:45,022
- Yes, sir. Weather permitting.
- What permitting?

694
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:47,358
Who said that?

695
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:50,444
It's payback time, Bilko.

696
00:51:50,528 --> 00:51:53,447
If it's all the same to you,
I'll tell my girlfriend we're leaving.

697
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:59,870
<i>It's not all the same to me, Bilko.
Move it! Hut, hut, hut! Hut, hut, hut, hut!</i>

698
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:03,958
You are my destiny

699
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:12,383
This solves nothing.

700
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:15,970
<i>This solves everything.</i>

701
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:20,307
You haven't seen someone called
Ernie Bilko, have you?

702
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:22,893
Oh, yes. He left a few minutes ago.

703
00:52:22,977 --> 00:52:27,064
- Are you sure?
- Yep, I definitely saw him go, in a hurry.

704
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:31,736
You see, I happen to know
Major Ebersole offered him a poker game.

705
00:52:31,986 --> 00:52:35,156
You're my dream come true

My one and only you

707
00:52:44,165 --> 00:52:46,334
I can drop you off
on my way back to the post.

708
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,837
- This is very nice of you.
- Not at all.

709
00:52:50,004 --> 00:52:52,757
May I ask you...

710
00:52:53,424 --> 00:52:57,261
...could I call on you sometime?
- Oh, well, you see, I'm...

711
00:52:57,428 --> 00:52:59,764
I just broke up with someone.

712

- What's the matter with you people?

- Get serious, Sarge!
- I am serious.

750
00:56:25,386 --> 00:56:28,139
I've been thinking about this.
You're Bilko's platoon!

751
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:30,558
Whatever they dish out, we can take.

752
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:34,562

I'm paralysed.
I have no feeling from the hair down.

755
00:56:47,158 --> 00:56:50,244
Make the bad man stop.

756
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:56,500
- Who are you calling?
- Rita. Her voice will make me feel better.

767
00:57:44,215 --> 00:57:47,218
I put on three pounds.

768
00:57:47,385 --> 00:57:50,554
Funny, it doesn't show.
Luis! This calls for plan A.

769
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:55,893
That won't work. He's on his way over.
He says if I can't do ten push-ups...

770
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:59,313
...he's gonna move me out.

that Fort Baxter will be shut down.

Frankly, sweetheart, after this hovertank

Oh, dear. I didn't realise it was that bad.

- Quite all right, Bilko.

783
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:05,546
Colonel, you didn't tell me
there was a movie star here.

784
00:59:05,713 --> 00:59:08,466
Sharon Stone! The men will be so excited.

785
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:10,885
- Bilko.
- We've seen all your movies.

786

- They're a little racy for me.
- Sergeant Bilko...

787

You know this is Mrs Hall.

788
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:20,311
Mrs Hall! Cradle robber. You were
dazzled by an older man, is that it?

789
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:22,063
- Bilko!
- Yes, my colonel?

790

John, I will see you later.

791
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:29,403
Right this way, Miss Stone. Uh... Mrs Hall.

792
00:59:30,655 --> 00:59:33,324
- What is it, Sergeant?
- Sir, if I could ask you again.

793
00:59:33,491 --> 00:59:35,493
- These desert manoeuvres...
- You can go.

794
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:39,080
If you'd seen the look on the men's faces
when I said we wouldn't...

795
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:41,499
- I said I've changed my mind.

Hey, Sarge, I was thinkin',
is it safe for us to be off the base?

- Thorn will be up to somethin'.
- You just thought of that?

833
01:01:42,953 --> 01:01:47,541
Relax. Before we left, I had Luis encrypt
the files. It'll take 'em years to break in.

834
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:50,211

837
01:02:02,473 --> 01:02:04,892
You two kids have just been sensational.

838
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:08,980

And do what?

840
01:02:11,565 --> 01:02:14,819

Quick, quick, cool 'em off.

01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:11,709
Press the six and the eight
and the black ten.

852
01:03:11,876 --> 01:03:15,296
- All right, here we go. Now...
- Oh, he's shakin' 'em off.

853
01:03:15,463 --> 01:03:20,885
Uh-oh, he's comin' with the pitch.
It looks like the high, hard one!

854
01:03:23,304 --> 01:03:25,556
Ooh, baby! Oh, good.

855
01:03:25,723 --> 01:03:29,894

It's easy, it's easy, it's easy.

856
01:03:30,061 --> 01:03:32,396
It's just... behind the back.

857
01:03:32,563 --> 01:03:35,816
Winner! We have a winner.

858
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:42,239
Wait a minute. This chip is scratched.

859
01:03:43,157 --> 01:03:44,158
- Mr Bilko.
- Yes?

860
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:46,994
That's quite a run.
Is there anything we can do for you?

861
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:52,750
Yes, go to your vault and tell your money
to be patient. We'll be together soon.

862
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:55,753
<i>You mean he stood you up
before that night at the Rusty Spur?</i>

863
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:58,839
Mm-hm. He left me standing at the altar.

864
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:01,008
There can be no excuse for that.

865
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:05,930
You'd be surprised. He had a new excuse
every time. They were all pretty amazing.

866
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:09,350
- He did that more than once?
- Mm-hm.

867
01:04:09,517 --> 01:04:12,603
Rita, you have a lot of love to give.

868
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:15,439
And you're smart.
Why put up with a clown like that?

869
01:04:15,606 --> 01:04:20,444
Because it was exciting. With Ernie,
every day was anything-can-happen day.

870
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:22,947
Some couples play Scrabble.

871
01:04:23,114 --> 01:04:26,450
This isn't a game we're talking about -
it's your life.

872
01:04:26,617 --> 01:04:30,037
Where I come from, when you tell
a woman you'll marry her, you mean it.

873
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:35,376
You know something? I would never
stand you up. I'd never not call you.

874
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:40,381
But then, I'm an officer with career
prospects. I can handle responsibility.

875
01:04:40,464 --> 01:04:42,216
I guess you can.

876
01:04:42,383 --> 01:04:44,552
Wouldn't you like a man
who's there for you?

877
01:04:44,802 --> 01:04:48,139
A man who wants to get married,
settle down and have a family.

878
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:50,558
Yes.

879
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:54,562
I bought you this.

880
01:04:57,481 --> 01:04:58,733
A ring!

881
01:04:58,983 --> 01:05:01,986
Two carats of cubic zirconia.

882
01:05:02,153 --> 01:05:04,822
It's beautiful.

883
01:05:09,827 --> 01:05:11,245
Oh...

884
01:05:11,412 --> 01:05:14,915
This is happening... too fast.

885
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:18,002
I don't want to hurt Ernie.

886
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:19,754
No.

887
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,674
We really don't want to hurt Ernie.

888
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,095
- That's when Vegas was Vegas.
- Excuse me, Mr Bilko?

889
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:31,515
- He said it was an emergency.
- This must be the Pentagon.

890
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:34,018
Hello? I can hardly hear you.

891
01:05:34,185 --> 01:05:37,938
Rita Robbins. She's been out
with that guy Thorn every night.

892
01:05:38,105 --> 01:05:40,274
<i>- Thorn?
- Since before you went on manoeuvres.</i>

893
01:05:40,441 --> 01:05:44,695
Tomorrow night they're going out to
that fancy French restaurant in Roseville.

894
01:05:44,862 --> 01:05:50,618
She's lookin' pretty weak, Ernie,
I gotta tell ya. Like she would do anything.

895
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:55,539
- Thanks, Sowicki.
- Bye, Ernie.

896
01:05:56,374 --> 01:05:58,959
<i>- Thank you, Stan.
- Hey, thank you!</i>

897
01:05:59,126 --> 01:06:01,629
For allowing me
to screw with Bilko's head.

898
01:06:01,796 --> 01:06:03,798
Oh, it isn't a game this time, Stan.

899
01:06:04,048 --> 01:06:06,801
<i>I just need to find out
how much he really loves me.</i>

900
01:06:07,051 --> 01:06:09,553
- He loves you plenty.
- More than Las Vegas?

901
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,640
That's asking a lot.

902
01:06:12,723 --> 01:06:15,059
<i>(rings)</i>

903
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:19,647
<i>(answer phone) Hi, this is Rita. I'm not in
right now. Please leave a message.</i>

904
01:06:19,814 --> 01:06:23,484
Rita, it's me, Ernie. I'm on my way home.
I hear you're seeing Thorn...

905
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:28,739
...and I just don't want you to take it too
seriously. He's only with you to annoy me.

906
01:06:28,906 --> 01:06:33,160
I see. He couldn't possibly be interested
in me-that would be ridiculous.

907
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:36,080
Rita, you're there.
This guy has terrible qualities.

908
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:41,919
- For one thing, he's very manipulative.
- He seemed nice to me. Goodbye.

909
01:06:42,253 --> 01:06:45,006
Hello? Hello?

910
01:06:45,256 --> 01:06:47,925
Rita? Rita?

911
01:06:52,847 --> 01:06:55,516
Why do you smell the cork?

912
01:06:55,683 --> 01:06:58,352
Your eyes are hazel, aren't they?

913
01:06:58,436 --> 01:06:59,437
Green.

914
01:06:59,603 --> 01:07:01,605
<i>(Bilko) I never have sex on the first date.</i>

915
01:07:01,772 --> 01:07:07,445
Thank God, it's our third. Oh, this is such
a... Oh, can't you just smell that... salad?

916
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:10,614
Yes, I have a reservation.

917
01:07:10,698 --> 01:07:16,203
Ah, this must be the table. You know,
what they do very well here is the garlic.

918
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,706
Oh, I touched you.
My temperature is rising.

919
01:07:18,873 --> 01:07:24,462
<i>Waiter, could we have two glasses
of red house, uh... s'il vous please?</i>

920
01:07:24,628 --> 01:07:26,797
In.

921
01:07:27,131 --> 01:07:29,050
Bilko. What a fool.

922
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:30,718
Yeah.

923
01:07:30,885 --> 01:07:33,804
How can he afford to eat here
on a sergeant's pay?

924
01:07:33,888 --> 01:07:38,059
- I'll be a lieutenant colonel very soon.
- No kidding?

925
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:40,728
<i>(exaggerated laugh)</i>

926
01:07:40,895 --> 01:07:43,981
- That woman's kind of attractive too.
- You think so?

927
01:07:44,065 --> 01:07:46,734
Well, not compared to you, of course.

928
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:49,737
Anyway, I understand
the oysters here are...

929
01:07:49,904 --> 01:07:53,407
...very, uh, very, uh... imported.

930
01:07:53,574 --> 01:07:56,494
- Just get me out of here fast.
- Relax, Paparelli.

931
01:07:56,661 --> 01:07:59,246
If you wanna make Rita jealous,
why not use Barbella?

932
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:05,252
She knows Barbella. I needed someone
she can't recognise. Someone alluring.

933
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:08,089
Thank you.

934
01:08:09,423 --> 01:08:14,512
Ah! Well, it's Rita Robbins
and Major Thorn! Ah! A-ha-ha, aha.

935
01:08:15,763 --> 01:08:19,016
Um, excuse me. One moment.

936
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:26,107
<i>- (Bilko clears throat)
- She's coming over? She's coming over?</i>

937
01:08:27,108 --> 01:08:30,778
Ernie, you made Paparelli
get into drag just to make me jealous?

938
01:08:30,945 --> 01:08:36,450
Well, actually, he was already in drag.
Paparelli, scram! Get going.

939
01:08:54,552 --> 01:08:56,971
Rita, you can't marry Thorn.
You don't love him.

940
01:08:57,138 --> 01:09:00,558
Think of the children.
You're a Catholic and he's an asshole!

941
01:09:00,808 --> 01:09:06,230
How would you raise them? And he's
already cheating on you with Paparelli.

942
01:09:06,314 --> 01:09:09,233
Hi, soldier boy.

943
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:13,738
<i>(hisses suggestively)</i>

944
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:20,161
Sowicki never told you
I was marrying Thorn.

945
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:25,249
You told Sowicki to call me.
You manipulated me. How could you?

946
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:29,670
Why not? I have a master's in
manipulation from the University of Bilko.

947
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:33,591
You tricked me. You sucked me in.

948
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:37,511
This is the most turned on
I've ever been in my life.

949
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:40,014
Rita, I'm so glad
we're back together again.

950
01:09:40,181 --> 01:09:43,017
Twelve more days.

951
01:09:50,441 --> 01:09:52,443
No wonder the hovertank never worked.

952
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:57,782
Yes, sir. He's been diverting research
funds into his own private account.

953
01:09:57,948 --> 01:10:03,287
For all the differences I've had with Bilko
over the years, I've always liked him.

954
01:10:03,454 --> 01:10:05,706
The way he kept up the men's morale.

955
01:10:05,956 --> 01:10:10,044
The way he'd pretend to cry when I went
on leave. The way, on my birthday...

956
01:10:10,211 --> 01:10:15,716
...he'd have the men mow my name in
the main lawn with a big heart around it.

957
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:19,387
- But now there'll be a court martial.
- Yes, sir.

958
01:10:19,553 --> 01:10:21,722
- Unless...
- Unless?

959
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:25,726
It's just that I know we'd both
do anything to spare Bilko a court martial.

960
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:28,479
If he could just be quietly punished.

961
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:31,816
<i>(sighs) Yeah, sure.</i>

962
01:10:31,983 --> 01:10:34,151
But... but how?

963
01:10:34,402 --> 01:10:37,571
The CO has certain powers, sir.

964
01:10:37,655 --> 01:10:42,243
- Powers?
- Can't he, for instance, have a soldier...

965
01:10:44,245 --> 01:10:46,831
...trans...

966
01:10:47,581 --> 01:10:50,418
Trans... atlantic?

967
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,840
Trans... vestite?

968
01:10:58,426 --> 01:11:01,929
- Transferred!
- What a wonderful idea.

969
01:11:02,096 --> 01:11:05,516
Yes, well, the wheels are always spinning.

970
01:11:05,683 --> 01:11:11,731
It'd have to be somewhere where there'd
be no chance of him making trouble again.

971
01:11:15,443 --> 01:11:17,987
Greenland?

972
01:11:18,112 --> 01:11:22,283
He's been out walking
by himself for, like, four hours.

973
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:25,202
- What's he doin'?
- He's thinkin'.

974
01:11:25,286 --> 01:11:30,791
- I thought I heard him crying.
- He even asked for a box of tissues.

975
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:35,046
<i>I guess you're happy.</i>

976
01:11:35,212 --> 01:11:38,549
Yeah. He hated the sarge.
He was probably helping Thorn to get him.

977
01:11:38,716 --> 01:11:41,218
- I was not!
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

978
01:11:41,469 --> 01:11:44,472
This is Bilko we're
talkin' about here. Bilko!

979
01:11:44,597 --> 01:11:46,724
Nobody gets the best of Bilko. Come on!

980
01:11:46,891 --> 01:11:49,644
<i>- That's right.
- (Paparelli) He'll think of somethin'.</i>

981
01:11:49,769 --> 01:11:53,314
Remember when I got the letter from
my wife sayin' she wanted to break up?

982
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:56,150
- Remember what Bilko did?
- He got your wife back?

983
01:11:56,317 --> 01:11:58,736
No, he got me another wife. A better wife!

984
01:11:58,903 --> 01:12:02,907
- Yeah!
- He'll come up with his best plan ever.

985
01:12:03,074 --> 01:12:07,411
Listen, I pity Major Thorn.
When Bilko gets done with him...

986
01:12:07,536 --> 01:12:10,164
<i>- (Doberman) Sarge!
- Ten-hut!</i>

987
01:12:10,331 --> 01:12:12,208
Hey, Sarge!

988
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:16,087
- Sarge!
- Sarge! You've come back!

989
01:12:16,504 --> 01:12:20,341
Ah, Doberman. The son I never wanted.

990
01:12:20,675 --> 01:12:23,928
Fall in and look this way!

991
01:12:27,515 --> 01:12:30,351
Hello, soldiers.

992
01:12:30,476 --> 01:12:34,105
<i>I'm talking to you.
Because that's what you are really.</i>

993
01:12:34,271 --> 01:12:37,274
Soldiers, every last one of you -
with a couple of exceptions.

994
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:39,318
- He's got a plan.
- He sure does.

995
01:12:39,443 --> 01:12:43,280
I wanna tell you a little story.
There was once a little boy...

996
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:47,159
...and that little boy had a dream to run
one of the most sophisticated...

997
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:50,621
...illegal gaming operations
the US Army has ever seen.

998
01:12:50,788 --> 01:12:51,956
- He's not worried.
- Not a bit.

999
01:12:52,123 --> 01:12:54,458
And that little boy's dream came true.

1000
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:58,129
But now they're trying to
snatch that dream back from him.

1001
01:12:58,295 --> 01:12:59,964
<i>- He is worried.
- That's not good.</i>

1002
01:13:00,172 --> 01:13:03,551
But what are the last two letters
in the name Bilko? K-O!

1003
01:13:03,718 --> 01:13:06,429
Of course, the first are B-l-L,
which is meaningless.

1004
01:13:06,637 --> 01:13:10,391
But still, am I giving up? No! Never!
Well, kind of, but not really...

1005
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:14,270
...because there is no way
I am going to Greenland.

1006
01:13:14,395 --> 01:13:17,064
Well, you're probably wondering
if I have a plan.

1007
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:21,569
Well, of course I have a plan!
A P-L-A-N. Plan.

1008
01:13:25,489 --> 01:13:27,825
But...

1009
01:13:28,326 --> 01:13:29,910
- He's got no plan.
- We're screwed.

1010
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:34,081
- I have a plan, Sarge.
- But maybe a plan is not what I need!

1011
01:13:34,165 --> 01:13:37,418
What I really need is just a little puppy.

1012
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:41,881
A little puppy with big, brown eyes
who'll just come to me and lick my face...

1013
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:46,552
...and just love me so much,
no matter what kind of person I am.

1014
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:47,762
<i>(Bilko sobs)</i>

1015
01:13:47,928 --> 01:13:50,723
Sarge, I really do have a plan.

1016
01:13:50,848 --> 01:13:55,436
<i>Oh, so now you have a plan.
Well, let's hear your plan, Wally.</i>

1017
01:13:55,686 --> 01:13:59,607
What if the hovertank did work? That'd
prove you haven't diverted the money.

1018
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:02,360
Oh! That is so stup... What?

1019
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:07,907
That would prove you hadn't been
diverting the money. Wouldn't it?

1020
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:11,952
Are you saying you can get
the hovertank to work?

1021
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:18,376
<i>No, of course not. But we don't need to
hold four aces if they think we hold'em.</i>

1022
01:14:20,461 --> 01:14:23,381
Permission to speak freely?

1023
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:26,967
Tell me a bit more about this plan,
because I think that's actually...

1024
01:14:27,218 --> 01:14:29,845
If they come, deny everything.
Just act dumb.

1025
01:14:30,054 --> 01:14:34,141
Fender, I'm putting you in charge of that.

1026
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:39,480
I love the nightlife, I like to boogie

1027
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:41,732
I like to rock all night long

1028
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:43,985
<i>(Bilko) Ahem.</i>

1029
01:14:44,151 --> 01:14:46,904
Oh... it's you, Bilko.

1030
01:14:47,071 --> 01:14:49,490
Sir, if I could talk with you
just for a moment.

1031
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:53,160
If you've come to talk about Greenland,
you're wasting your time.

1032
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:55,579
Frankly, Sergeant, I'm disappointed.

1033
01:14:55,746 --> 01:14:59,333
Sir, all I ever wanted was an honest
week's pay for an honest day's work.

1034
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:03,337
- I didn't steal money, sir.
- Please, Bilko.

1035
01:15:03,504 --> 01:15:05,923
Let's just say goodbye.

1036
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:08,092
And thank you.

1037
01:15:08,259 --> 01:15:11,429
- For what, sir?
- Well, for...

1038
01:15:11,554 --> 01:15:14,849
...always making me feel like
I actually ran this place.

1039
01:15:15,016 --> 01:15:17,601
Good old Fort Baxter.

1040
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:20,438
I guess your garden
is one of the things you'll miss most.

1041
01:15:20,604 --> 01:15:22,356
Ah, yes. I love...

1042
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:25,067
<i>- Miss? Why miss?
- The colonel hasn't heard?</i>

1043
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:29,030
- In that case, it must not be true.
- What? Uh... they're closing Fort Baxter?

1044
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,449
You didn't hear it from me.

1045
01:15:31,615 --> 01:15:34,702
Take good care of yourself in...
I've said enough.

1046
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:37,038
Have you heard where they're sending me?

1047
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:40,541
- You're stepping on your flowers.
- The hell with them! Where?

1048
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,544
- Where are they sending me?
- It's just rumour, sir.

1049
01:15:43,711 --> 01:15:47,548
Oh, that fair skin
under the burning desert sun...

1050
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:51,302
<i>Oh, my God. The desert sun.</i>

1051
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:54,555
Remember, if you get lost, travel by night.

1052
01:15:54,805 --> 01:15:59,226
- How can they do this to me?
- The hovertank test was the last straw.

1053
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:01,979
Too bad they didn't schedule it this week.

1054
01:16:02,146 --> 01:16:04,398
Well...

1055
01:16:04,565 --> 01:16:06,651
- Goodbye.
- Wha...? Wait!

1056
01:16:06,817 --> 01:16:10,529
- You mean the hovertank is working?
- Oh, I know what you're thinking, sir:

1057
01:16:10,738 --> 01:16:13,157
..."Arrange a public demonstration ASAP."

1058
01:16:13,324 --> 01:16:15,826
"Call the Pentagon
and the Department of the Army."

1059
01:16:15,993 --> 01:16:18,829
- All right.
- I've already taken that liberty, sir.

1060
01:16:18,913 --> 01:16:20,915
- Thank you.
- Oh, that picture of you...

1061
01:16:20,998 --> 01:16:23,501
...standing triumphant at the test.

1062
01:16:23,751 --> 01:16:28,422
That'll keep me warm
on those lonely nights in Greenland.

1063
01:16:28,589 --> 01:16:31,008
<i>In Greenland, sir.</i>

1064
01:16:31,175 --> 01:16:33,177
Oh. Yes.

1065
01:16:33,427 --> 01:16:36,013
Well, goodbye.

1066
01:16:37,056 --> 01:16:40,226
- Ah, Bi...
- Yes, sir?

1067
01:16:41,352 --> 01:16:44,605
If the test goes well,
you won't be transferred.

1068
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:47,858
Well, thank you, sir! I'm stunned!

1069
01:16:47,984 --> 01:16:50,277
Just as a formality,
I've put that in writing.

1070
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:55,199
If you could just sign here
and here, and initial here.

1071
01:16:57,535 --> 01:17:00,204
- Here?
- Uh, no. Here.

1072
01:17:00,371 --> 01:17:03,082
And I'll just notarise that.

1073
01:17:03,124 --> 01:17:08,129
- And I'll waive the usual ten-dollar fee.
- Oh. Thank you.

1074
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:11,465
Here you are. Good day.

1075
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:14,468
No, it'll hover. But as before...

1076
01:17:14,593 --> 01:17:18,889
...it will go completely haywire
if we attempt to fire the cannon.

1077
01:17:19,056 --> 01:17:21,434
We know that. We just need
a couple of hours with it.

1078
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:25,604
- Let's get started.
- It's a $70-million piece of equipment.

1079
01:17:25,813 --> 01:17:29,066
You think I'm gonna allow
one of your men to fool around with it?

1080
01:17:29,191 --> 01:17:31,652
- I think not.
- Oh. Mm-hm.

1081
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:35,740
Oh, boy. Oh, my, is it hot in here or what?

1082
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:38,909
What's this? Oh!
I almost forgot I had these.

1083
01:17:39,118 --> 01:17:41,579
It's the IOUs from the poker game.

1084
01:17:41,704 --> 01:17:46,500
- Would he like to use my tools?
- That would be nice.

1085
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:53,424
- You saw it?
- Yeah, it blew up the ammunition shed.

1086
01:17:53,591 --> 01:17:56,802
<i>- A perfect hit.
- (louder) The hovertank?</i>

1087
01:17:56,886 --> 01:17:59,680
- I thought that thing was busted.
- Yeah, it was.

1088
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,682
But the kid, Wally, he fixed it.

1089
01:18:01,849 --> 01:18:04,685
He said the key was the...

1090
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:07,229
The...?

1091
01:18:07,772 --> 01:18:11,275
The fire-control
and super-elevator board.

1092
01:18:11,442 --> 01:18:15,363
- Imagine that.
- Yeah, the super-elevator board.

1093
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:20,618
And the great thing is, if it works
at the demonstration, Bilko gets to stay.

1094
01:18:20,826 --> 01:18:23,037
Great!

1095
01:18:50,982 --> 01:18:53,192
Yeah.

1096
01:19:14,463 --> 01:19:19,010
- Wonderful to see you again, General.
- You, too, Colonel. Mrs Hall.

1097
01:19:19,176 --> 01:19:23,597
- And, of course, you know Major Thorn.
- Thorn.

1098
01:19:34,942 --> 01:19:37,695
<i>(deep sigh)</i>

1099
01:19:44,744 --> 01:19:48,039
- Tank crew ready, sir.
- Very good, Bilko. General.

1100
01:19:48,205 --> 01:19:50,624
Master Sergeant Bilko.
It's an honour to meet you.

1101
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:54,462
- You look terrific! Have you lost weight?
- Who is this?

1102
01:19:54,628 --> 01:19:59,216
Members of Congress, General Tennyson,
colleagues from the defence industries...

1103
01:19:59,383 --> 01:20:03,012
...distinguished guests, welcome.

1104
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:05,806
The weapon system
you are about to see today...

1105
01:20:05,973 --> 01:20:11,562
...can be called the world's first
truly all-terrain assault vehicle...

1106
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:17,485
...which I'm proud to say was developed
entirely in-house, here at Fort Baxter.

1107
01:20:17,652 --> 01:20:22,156
I give you the armoured attack platform
to lead American defence forces...

1108
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:26,661
...into the 21st century.
The HTX-1 hovertank.

1109
01:20:38,089 --> 01:20:42,259
Water and rough terrain can stop
an ordinary M1 or APC...

1110
01:20:42,426 --> 01:20:45,805
...but the hovertank can literally rise
above these obstacles.

1111
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:49,892
And that is the capability
we will show you here today.

1112
01:20:49,976 --> 01:20:53,562
Hovertank, you are looking good.

1113
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:58,025
Hovertank, fire when ready. Hoo-ah!

1114
01:20:58,442 --> 01:21:01,112
<i>(groans)</i>

1115
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:16,794
<i>(applause)</i>

1116
01:21:25,136 --> 01:21:29,223
Ha. This little bird packs a deadly punch.

1117
01:21:59,086 --> 01:22:01,881
Fire in the hole!

1118
01:22:35,247 --> 01:22:41,212
- You hit the wrong button, Rastahead!
- It's not my fault! He wired it wrong!

1119
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,549
Any questions?

1120
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:09,907
Congratulations, honey.

1121
01:23:10,116 --> 01:23:11,993
- Home run, sir!
- Thank you, Captain.

1122
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,870
- We'll rush this baby into production.
- Thank you.

1123
01:23:15,079 --> 01:23:18,749
Jack, I thank you
on behalf of a grateful nation.

1124
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:23,421
I just can't wait to see
what you fellas come up with next.

1125
01:23:23,504 --> 01:23:26,507
Wait! Wait. The demonstration was rigged.

1126
01:23:26,674 --> 01:23:30,469
Ah, do I see politics in your future, sir?
Perhaps a run at the Oval Office?

1127
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:32,847
I've never given that serious consideration.

1128
01:23:33,055 --> 01:23:35,016
Wait! General! He faked it!

1129
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:38,686
Didn't you see the gun was aimed
at target three, but blew up target four?

1130
01:23:38,769 --> 01:23:40,187
Yes, I did.

1131
01:23:40,396 --> 01:23:43,190
If you remember
Einstein's theory, space is curved.

1132
01:23:43,357 --> 01:23:47,194
- Yes.
- And these are smart weapons.

1133
01:23:47,445 --> 01:23:50,823
Oh, cut the crap! He faked it.
It's just one of his scams.

1134
01:23:50,948 --> 01:23:54,035
That's a serious charge.
Colonel, what about this?

1135
01:23:54,285 --> 01:23:56,370
General, in all my years in the service...

1136
01:23:56,537 --> 01:23:59,749
...I have never, not once,
publicly berated a fellow officer.

1137
01:23:59,957 --> 01:24:03,836
But I realise now that from the moment
Major Thorn set foot on Fort Baxter...

1138
01:24:03,919 --> 01:24:07,632
...he engaged in a personal vendetta
against Master Sergeant Bilko.

1139
01:24:07,798 --> 01:24:11,969
I find his conduct inexcusable, and will
recommend an article 32 investigation.

1140
01:24:12,178 --> 01:24:13,888
<i>- I see.
- (Thorn) You don't understand.</i>

1141
01:24:14,055 --> 01:24:18,392
He doesn't know what's going on. This
sergeant leads him around by the nose!

1142
01:24:18,643 --> 01:24:23,648
Major! You are the most
insubordinate officer I have ever met.

1143
01:24:23,814 --> 01:24:27,985
I'm telling you, he's a boob! He doesn't
get it! They faked the whole thing!

1144
01:24:28,152 --> 01:24:32,907
I'd like to see just one piece of evidence
to support these idiotic allegations.

1145
01:24:33,032 --> 01:24:38,287
Idiotic, huh? How's this for evidence? The
fire-control and super-elevator board.

1146
01:24:38,496 --> 01:24:42,667
I took it out last night,
so how can it work?

1147
01:24:49,757 --> 01:24:52,760
So you deliberately
sabotaged this project, Major?

1148
01:24:52,843 --> 01:24:55,471
I got it all on tape.

1149
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,848
Lucky.

1150
01:24:58,599 --> 01:25:01,519
<i>(wind howling)</i>

1151
01:25:03,437 --> 01:25:05,690
- Whoo!
- Yeah, celebration time.

1152
01:25:05,856 --> 01:25:08,359
Chin-chin.

1153
01:25:09,026 --> 01:25:13,698
Because I know Pap knew it,
and I... Stand, troops!

1154
01:25:15,282 --> 01:25:19,203
<i>- You're in the presence of a genius.
- (all) Hoo-ah!</i>

1155
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:24,291
You're a total kingpin. You got Thorn
to sabotage something that didn't work!

1156
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:29,213
Yeah, well, I couldn't have done it without
our Wally. Where is he, where is the lad?

1157
01:25:29,338 --> 01:25:31,966
Here, Sarge.

1158
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:36,804
I was just resetting
the colonel's odometer.

1159
01:25:44,228 --> 01:25:48,649
- I told you Wally was all right.
- OK. Glee club.

1160
01:26:02,413 --> 01:26:03,748
Oh, well.

1161
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:07,376
Only you, only you, only you

1162
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:12,923
Can make this change in me

1163
01:26:15,176 --> 01:26:17,678
Only you

1164
01:26:20,264 --> 01:26:23,184
You are my destiny

1165
01:26:23,851 --> 01:26:26,145
Destiny

1166
01:26:26,187 --> 01:26:30,191
When you hold my hand,
I understand the

1167
01:26:31,901 --> 01:26:35,613
Magic that you do,
magic that you do

1168
01:26:38,658 --> 01:26:42,203
Ooh, you're my dream come true

1169
01:26:44,288 --> 01:26:47,041
My one and only

1170
01:26:48,793 --> 01:26:49,669
You

1171
01:26:49,794 --> 01:26:52,880
Hum

1172
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:55,716
It's only you

1173
01:26:58,135 --> 01:26:59,971
Very nice.

1174
01:27:00,221 --> 01:27:02,723
Aw, get up, Bilko.

1175
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:08,729
Marry me, Rita. I know I'm a long shot,
but sometimes long shots pay off big.

1176
01:27:12,316 --> 01:27:15,236
<i>(soldiers cheer)</i>

1177

Well, better late than never.

1182
01:28:15,212 --> 01:28:17,548
- Poker?
- All right.

1183
01:28:17,757 --> 01:28:20,301
Nickel ante.

1184
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:25,014
Let's make it interesting.
One hand of showdown.

1185
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:28,392
If I win, we get married.

1186
01:28:31,228 --> 01:28:33,356
Ernie, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1187
01:28:33,481 --> 01:28:38,903
I've never known you to chicken out
of a game, whatever the stakes.

1188
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:47,411
<i>(whispers) You're on.</i>

1189
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:50,247
Well, well, well, what do you know?

1190
01:28:50,331 --> 01:28:53,167
- Full house. Jacks over threes.
- You cheated!

1191
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:55,169
- No, and we're getting married!
- When?

1192
01:28:55,294 --> 01:28:58,506
<i>Now! (blows whistle)</i>

1193
01:29:04,845 --> 01:29:07,014
Daddy!

1194
01:29:07,264 --> 01:29:09,600
- Ow!
- Dearly beloved, we are gathered here...

1195
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:11,936
...to witness the joining of these
two good people in holy matrimony.

1196
01:29:12,103 --> 01:29:15,356
Rita Robbins, do you take Ernest Bilko
to love, honour and cherish...

1197
01:29:15,523 --> 01:29:18,442
...for richer or poorer...
- Think we're moving too fast?

1198
01:29:18,609 --> 01:29:19,819
- I do.
- Let's go!

1199
01:29:19,944 --> 01:29:23,698
- Do you, Ernest Bilko, take Rita...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I do.

1200
01:29:23,864 --> 01:29:29,662
By the power vested in me, I pronounce
you husband and wife. You may ki...
