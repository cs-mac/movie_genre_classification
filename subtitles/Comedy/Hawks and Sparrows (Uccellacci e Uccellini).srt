human TOTO

00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:13,920
crazy TOTO

5
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:15,763
sweet TOTO

6
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:18,176

DAVOLI NINETTO

11
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:40,298
Found in the streets of the entire
world, the other actors

12
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:49,899
In the sad running

13
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:52,714
In the happy running...

14
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:57,729

FERNANDO FRANCHI organized

20
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:29,896
SERGIO CITTI, the philosopher, helper

21
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:34,709
A small groupe wandered

22
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,058
by the fields, the towns and the ways

23
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:49,848
Producer risking his position:

24
00:01:53,993 --> 00:01:59,886
Director risking the reputation:

25
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:12,208
Where goes the humanity? Bof!

26
00:02:12,457 --> 00:02:15,426
Extracted from an interview of MAO with
Mr. Edgard Snow.

27
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,529
With the moon nothing is caught.

28
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,339
Who said it to you? Why?

29
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:28,598
the fish is gotten sleepy. It is
necessary to wait for the high tide.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,084
Does that depend on what, this high tide?

31
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,716
Have you seen the sweepings
that leaves the sea on the sand?

32
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,031
On what depends that?

33
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:40,840
the moon exerts a gravity force...

34
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:42,845
... with which the water raises

35
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:50,000
Dad, mom has nice new teeth

36
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:52,407
My, I know what it cost me

37
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,937
But these are not authentic teeth, like
those before.

38
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:59,110
They are teeth of teeth! And she is
crazy about them

39
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:03,753
She hides them in the drawer
so that grandpa does not rob them.

40
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,707
To intention...Have you thrown
the DDT in the stable?

41
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:09,870
- No, I forgot.
- Shit. What a idiot!

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,200
It's not my fault .

43
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:14,288
This morning, crazy Josefina
showed her chest on the balcony...

44
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:16,376
Pity you have not seen it...

45
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:19,349
I do't care about that! I
think about the stable.

46
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:22,087
The flies eat them poor cows
alive.

47
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:23,846
Hell, a little conscience needed.

48
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:26,937
didn't stopped to complain
all the night, poor cows.

49
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,700
Cinzano and a limonade.
How much?

50
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:48,906
270.

51
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:51,473
Dad, there'll be nothing with her

52
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:53,766
Go, drink your lemonade.

53
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:07,252
Do you want to learn?

54
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:09,219
Please

55
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,680
Count the steps, if not,
you will never learn.

56
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,129
Go... one, two, three...

57
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:37,489
... and four.

58
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,865
Boys, the bus!

59
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:43,800
Listen a little...

60
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:47,602
Tell me a thing...in the morning you comb
yourself with the vacuum cleaner?

61
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,819
Street BENITO TEAR. Unemployed

62
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:15,431
I have something to do...Do you remember?
I have already said it.

63
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,795
It's good...It's good...

64
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:40,898
- What happened?

65
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,611
- A marriage?

66
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:04,308
Who it was?

67
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:09,922
Martucci, that had a tic in the
mouth, and his woman.

68
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:18,236
I will see my friend.
I return in 5 minutes.

69
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:20,291
Hurry up

70
00:07:23,304 --> 00:07:26,947
Street ANTONIO MANGIAPASTA. Street
cleaner

71
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:31,773
Street LILLO STRAPPALENZOLA.
left the house in 12 years

72
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,031
You seem an airplane!

73
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,532
What you want to do here?

74
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:16,104
we were proving the 600
with a friend mine...

75
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:17,998
To see what speed it's able to do

76
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:19,845
My friend was scared to death.

77
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:21,733
Sure, you are half crazy

78
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,215
For what these dresses?

79
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:26,945
Today is celebration of Maria's daughters
we give a celebration to the asylum.

80
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:32,280
That suits you well.
You come to dance with me, Sunday?

81
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,660
- No!
- Take your course.

82
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:38,036
If you come with the 600...

83
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,044
I cannot, my friend has taken
it to the mechanic...

84
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:45,904
for a revision. Later I will appear
this way...

85
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:47,990
You won't see me coming!

86
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,169
Do you know they have seen you with
my school friend ?

87
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,689
I met her by chance. We chattered...

88
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,982
Yes, chattered...In the meadow.
She said it to me.

89
00:08:57,072 --> 00:08:59,961
What meadow? We were there
just because...

90
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:03,128
... it was late, her father would
have beat her.

91
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:05,102
Do you understand?

92
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,398
Good bye, Nino.

93
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:53,767
What happened?

94
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:57,039
Get out of here, I don't want
to see you anymore!

95
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,643
Do you give me a little kiss?

96
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:10,423
The police officer said that
they were covered with vomit.

97
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,069
He was on the bed...

98
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:15,880
... She, fallen down in the entrance,
with the hand stretched towards the door.

99
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:51,062
Dad, seems to me that the life is
worth of nothing.

100
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:52,221
Sure it is

101
00:11:52,593 --> 00:11:54,512
Death is so strong.

102
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:58,691
When one dies,
all what he had to do...

103
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:00,377
...was already done.

104
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:12,143
Dad, always I think about the death

105
00:12:12,511 --> 00:12:14,909
Because I say myself: What makes one to
die?

106
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:17,810
Little by little, breathing,
making "Ah"

107
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:19,891
... and why later already stops?

108
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:22,659
Suddenly, doesn't make ...
... "ah" any more...

109
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:25,476
He does't notice
that he can't make "Ah"?

110
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:27,920
How to find out when one is alive
or dead?

111
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:33,912
Ask that another one!
Am I already dead?

112
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,324
I would like to be a parrot

113
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:39,686
I would live 200 or 300 years.

114
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:42,021
A rich man died....

115
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:45,673
... left a lot of money here

116
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:48,527
the richest one of the cementery

117
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:51,330
Think a little, how angry he must be.

118
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:56,801
Happy poor man, cause only few know
that he has died.

119
00:12:57,445 --> 00:13:00,334
They write: "So-and-so died.
and another one"

120
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:05,836
When a rich one dies, he pays his
debt to the life.

121
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,318
He pays for what the life gave him.

122
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,572
poor man, also pay, but the life has
not given him anything.

123
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:12,734
What makes the poor man?

124
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:15,709
Passes from death to another death.

125
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,839
Where you go, friends?

126
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,743
Where you go, friends?

127
00:13:36,597 --> 00:13:37,956
What you have said?

128
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:39,277
I have not said anything

129
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:40,934
Then I have hallucinations

130
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:44,098
May I accompany you?

131
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:46,068
But who is that?

132
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:52,529
Dad, watch who was it: A crow!

133
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:57,710
THE WAY BEGIN And The TRIP THIS ALREADY
FINISHED

134
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:00,930
Doesn't that annoy you,
if I come with you?

135
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:04,062
No, it will be a pleasure,
am I right, Dad?

136
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:09,277
Then we are going to be
part of the way together...

137
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:11,569
Can you tell me where you go?

138
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:12,933
We go there

139
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:15,623
But where?... It is a little misty.
Where is "there"?

140
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,102
Then... there.

141
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:19,639
- I believe that I will guess it.
- Guess.

142
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:24,405
You will make photographs of the
boy, which will work at FIAT.

143
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:28,032
- No. - No.
We already  made them last week.

144
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:32,332
Then, you go to your godfather,
to the baptism of his son

145
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,819
Shit. Is that
fortune tellers affluent... Eh?

146
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:37,793
already we were yesterday in the
baptism

147
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,399
Are you a prophet, or who?

148
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:42,729
Yes, a prophet...If you want...

149
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:45,704
a prophet or a cop, one of this.

150
00:14:47,232 --> 00:14:50,715
Let me think... I will see...

151
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:53,172
You go to the chiromancer..

152
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:55,779
... to ask medicine for Ninetto...

153
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:57,863
...who has the tapeworm.

154
00:14:58,034 --> 00:14:59,837
I burns, i burns...

155
00:15:01,928 --> 00:15:03,687
Forgive me, if I insist,

156
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:05,615
you do not want to tell me where you go?

157
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:07,223
I already said to you, there.

158
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,120
But where? On right side, left, straight?

159
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:11,274
There, further.

160
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:15,376
Never had seen you here

161
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:17,987
From where you come? Who you are?

162
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:20,590
I come from a distant spot...

163
00:15:20,802 --> 00:15:23,886
My country is called Ideology,
I live in the capital...

164
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:29,144
City of the Future, street Karl Marx,
the number 70 times 7.

165
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,242
And we, in the quarter
of the Trash.

166
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:34,884
- Street Died of Hunger.
- number 23.

167
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:36,736
Under the Mount of the Sewer...

168
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:40,308
Famous anywhere in the world by the
martyrdom of San Analfabeto

169
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:50,313
... That is...that is,hell...

170
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:06,859
sun begins to tighten.

171
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:09,301
cooks my brain.

172
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,430
Why we do not stop in this
meadow to make the siesta?

173
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:14,760
Go, bastard

174
00:16:14,922 --> 00:16:16,646
I go with you

175
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:21,979
I have two corns,
the small one on the finger,

176
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:26,123
and the big one on the toe,
which makes me suffer the hell.

177
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,525
You lucky one

178
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:31,021
Lucky with a horn! With this
migraine?

179
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:32,666
Yes, lucky

180
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,951
Why "lucky"?

181
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,569
For you can freely walk by the
highways...

182
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:40,293
...the suburbs of the city,

183
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,755
...Morning you can enter
the taverns with the young workers...

184
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,918
... to kiss girls in costume of angel,

185
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,432
speaking about life and death, with
the first words that leave your lips

186
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:53,619
While me...

187
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:57,478
But you do not have parents,
family... nothing?

188
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,093
My parents are Mister Doubt and
Mistress Conscience

189
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:03,748
Me, however, I am Ninetto...

190
00:17:03,912 --> 00:17:08,046
... Son of the Toto Innocent and the
Grace Simple.

191
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:13,509
Your innocence, simplicity and grace

192
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,754
...they are religious

193
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:19,445
The religion is the force
that moves you ahead

194
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:22,217
throughout a way that nobody knows

195
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:25,153
No matter who you are, farmers
or workers.

196
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,233
A way that leads you far

197
00:17:27,684 --> 00:17:30,927
To where all the ways of the world meet

198
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:35,265
As for religion, I would like
to tell you a history

199
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:38,197
Go ahead, please.

200
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:42,208
That will relieve us of this long
walk under the sun.

201
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:44,183
I can?

202
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:49,123
The history that I am going to
tell...

203
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:52,771
...is the strange history
of large and small birds.

204
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:55,146
We are in the year 1200.

205
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,878
All coincidence with people of
our days...

206
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,330
... is not casual.

207
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:06,069
You who do not want to know,

208
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:08,873
...who live like assassins
among the clouds,

209
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:13,259
... that you live like bandits in the
wind and crazy people in the sky.

210
00:18:13,702 --> 00:18:17,152
You, who have your laws outside the
laws

211
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:20,526
Who spend your days in a world
that stand on the foot of the world

212
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,774
Who you don't know the work and celebrate
the slaughters of the powerful ones

213
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:26,547
We simply can see you through God

214
00:18:27,516 --> 00:18:30,805
Because our eyes already are accustomed
our lives

215
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,648
... and are not able to recognize that...

216
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:35,015
... that you live in the desert or the
forest

217
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:39,075
We must understand you

218
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:43,775
For you are the ones who give faith of
Christ to the faithfuls

219
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:47,914
with your joy, your pure force
which is faith.

220
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:55,783
For that reason, I order you, Fray
Cicillo and to you Fray Ninetto

221
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:58,517
... to continue the preaching to the
birds

222
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:01,120
and I say to you in addition, that it is
right that you begin...

223
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,126
... with the two very different species:

224
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,133
the hawks, which are powerful

225
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:07,427
and the sparrows, which are humble

226
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:10,555
- For the glory of the Lord
- Amen

227
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:54,366
What are you doin' with this sling?

228
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:56,773
Throw it and recites "Ave Maria"

229
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:02,835
These saints, they have their claims...

230
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:06,214
Does it seem easy to you to speak
with the birds?

231
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:07,734
I am speaking too

232
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:09,346
Keep your mouth shut.

233
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:15,485
You think that I also go for a saint?

234
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,699
Yes, saint... With that face you have.

235
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,834
What? What's wrong with my face?

236
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:23,677
Brother Cicillo , we can not
make a thing:

237
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,212
we will say to San Francisco...

238
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:29,347
... that the deal is not made,
so better look for others.

239
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:31,510
I am going to slap you.

240
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:32,877
Or even better ...

241
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:36,932
... we go away to house of those
farmers where one eats so well.

242
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,662
We will eat a lot, sleep a lot and
after a month we return and say to him:

243
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,638
"Brother Francisco, the birds need
you"

244
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:45,528
No, we are not saint

245
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:47,851
We are human men

246
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:50,945
But, thanks to the Lord, we have
a brain.

247
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,415
So, fray Cicillo and
fray Ninetto...

248
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,383
... start up...

249
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:01,470
... to spread gospel among
birds.

250
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,134
Now, what is their language?

251
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,965
Everything depends on you, fray
Ciccillo. And God helps you.

252
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:11,137
You know all and I cannot
help you. I am good for nothing.

253
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:23,069
I am going to pray

254
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:28,646
Lord, give me the power to remain in
this place...

255
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:30,891
... where I have put my knees...

256
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:34,911
... until it has sanctified all
the hawks on this rock...

257
00:22:35,078 --> 00:22:39,052
... and on the world, according to the
will of San Francisco.

258
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,410
Look, what is that?

259
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:37,983
Maybe he is a mowering monk!

260
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,869
You come to spy for Christ?

261
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:41,963
Eh! Let's strip him off.

262
00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:50,174
Think that they let me be a monk?
I eat very little.

263
00:23:50,557 --> 00:23:53,527
Eh! Leave him in peace!
Let him go away.

264
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:54,849
Have you finished?

265
00:23:55,094 --> 00:23:56,659
Here is fray Margarita

266
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,872
Let him go! Leave him in peace!

267
00:24:00,194 --> 00:24:03,644
Shame on you, you do not know that he
is annoying santo.

268
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,932
A saint! A saint!

269
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,182
Yes... Saint Chicorey.

270
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:13,725
Help, fray Cicillo!

271
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,398
Damn it, how the grass grows

272
00:24:56,252 --> 00:24:58,902
They are right when they call us
mowering monks.

273
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:00,662
Only the chicory.

274
00:25:01,472 --> 00:25:04,156
And also a little ivy... you see?

275
00:25:04,885 --> 00:25:06,405
...and the nettles...

276
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:09,261
Come... I am going to take nettles.

277
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:21,548
Tsss... be quiet... go away...

278
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:41,862
Summer comes.

279
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,999
The season of the cicadas, the nettles...

280
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:49,127
The lunches on the grass,
the tomatos.

281
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,899
Autumn comes.

282
00:26:09,898 --> 00:26:11,702
Winter comes.

283
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:14,636
It never snowed as much as this year

284
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:27,041
And the beautiful season comes again.

285
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:37,040
That is enough, I am sick of it.
I want to leave.

286
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:40,253
What am I doing here? I serve for
nothing.

287
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:43,781
I want to speak with people, not
with the birds...

288
00:26:44,152 --> 00:26:46,390
I pass the day watching the flies

289
00:26:47,002 --> 00:26:49,320
I am sick of it.

290
00:26:58,001 --> 00:26:59,075
I return at home.

291
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:01,125
I return to my mother.

292
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:04,537
But Fray Cicillo could not answer him.

293
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,992
... Because after on year of
silence...

294
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:09,441
...his throat got rusted.

295
00:27:13,904 --> 00:27:16,302
Tell me brother, I am not right?

296
00:27:16,714 --> 00:27:20,117
For what reason I must be here?
Night and day, day and night

297
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:22,858
Summer and winter, with sun and rain...

298
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,903
To waste my existence? Why?

299
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:31,000
To deserve the Paradise, my son!

300
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:36,388
Would it bother you if I rest
a little at your feet?

301
00:27:39,964 --> 00:27:41,608
The Paradise...

302
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:51,803
I have found!

303
00:27:55,143 --> 00:27:56,102
Lord...

304
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:59,356
...thank you, I have found it

305
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:15,209
Hawks, come, listen...

306
00:28:15,663 --> 00:28:18,028
Come, listen...

307
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:20,439
Who are you?

308
00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:22,442
What do you want?

309
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:24,617
Two creatures of God...

310
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,823
... that they want to speak with you...

311
00:28:26,987 --> 00:28:28,061
... Creatures of God

312
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:30,871
God?

313
00:28:31,324 --> 00:28:32,888
Who is God?

314
00:28:34,336 --> 00:28:37,898
creator of all the creatures

315
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,605
For what reason God created us

316
00:28:46,584 --> 00:28:50,457
Why you have created
your children?

317
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:55,176
Then, each one of us is God.

318
00:28:57,024 --> 00:28:58,223
do not exaggerate, one gives you
an idea

319
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,271
and at once you become arrogant.

320
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:08,216
And the God: what he wants of
us?

321
00:29:10,877 --> 00:29:13,242
Love...

322
00:29:15,496 --> 00:29:17,459
Love...

323
00:29:19,511 --> 00:29:21,475
Love!

324
00:29:39,147 --> 00:29:41,625
good, good

325
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:51,151
Hell, what a hard work. But we succeeded.

326
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:54,804
I am really pleased, by you not by me.

327
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,151
But how have you done it?

328
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:06,764
Help yourself and God will help you.

329
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,977
the saints, with their faith could do
everything

330
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:13,513
But I am a man, Nino, a human man...

331
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,280
Do you know what I did?

332
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:17,286
I said myself: "Fray Cicillo...

333
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:20,186
... Think, use your brain."

334
00:30:20,348 --> 00:30:24,037
With the help of faith one believes,
with the help of science one sure knows.

335
00:30:24,765 --> 00:30:26,683
Luckily you have your head.

336
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:30,464
San Francisco was right to choose you.

337
00:30:30,868 --> 00:30:34,592
He will be happy when
we tell him all that.

338
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,179
But now we would amuse a little...

339
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:42,468
... we deserve it.

340
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:45,698
Let us play the organ in the church
to thank the Lord.

341
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:49,373
and then to house of the farmer to eat
cheese and cream cheese

342
00:30:50,103 --> 00:30:53,712
Their cellars are full of wine.

343
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:57,461
and we will request a new habit. These
are used and stink out.

344
00:30:58,174 --> 00:30:59,933
It doesn't seem to you, fray Cicillo?

345
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,637
Who serves the Lord is always
in a hurry.

346
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:05,197
you are only a parasite

347
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:08,610
With the hawks, it is done.

348
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:11,421
and now it's turn of the sparrows.

349
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:12,785
Let us go

350
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,721
In agreement, fray Cicci, I have
not said anything,

351
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:20,744
Where we are going to turn the sparrows?

352
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:24,589
There

353
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:44,313
Hope it is not as hard as with
the hawks, my Lord.

354
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:45,994
But I swear again...

355
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:50,140
... I will not move an inch of
my poor knees...

356
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:52,872
... Until the sparrows have been
sanctified

357
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:55,118
Let's hope that they are not...

358
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:57,202
... hard-headed

359
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:15,033
What he's doing here,
sister Gramigna?

360
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,688
I don't know, sister Misery,
and you, sister Avarizia?

361
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:22,019
Perhaps to satisfy his corporal needs,
sister Gramigna.

362
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,031
Eh, little monk comes here.

363
00:32:27,165 --> 00:32:29,689
- What do you want?
- But what is he doing?

364
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:32,982
He must stay at least a year here

365
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:37,839
in one year the figs will grow
on a fig tree,

366
00:32:38,087 --> 00:32:40,326
But to a friar...What grows on him?
The beard?

367
00:32:40,537 --> 00:32:43,301
would not speak thus, madam.
That man is a saint.

368
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:45,675
Do you believe it,
sister Gramigna?

369
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:50,730
Who knows it, sister Misery?
What do you say, sister Avarizia(Grifagna)?

370
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:54,302
we will see, sister Misery,
if he gets wet when it rains.

371
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,391
Now he is turning the sparrows...

372
00:32:57,564 --> 00:33:00,212
... But in the other towns
he made many miracles.

373
00:33:01,258 --> 00:33:06,182
In Frattochie he turned the water
into wine because they were drunk.

374
00:33:06,478 --> 00:33:10,489
In Zagarolo, turned the water into
wine because they desired to drink

375
00:33:10,494 --> 00:33:14,387
In Sgurgola, he did not change a thing,
because all was well.

376
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:53,541
Watermelon... sweet watermelon!

377
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,507
Cream cheese! Cream cheese!

378
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,299
God, give me a patience.

379
00:34:54,498 --> 00:34:58,060
Grace is returned to you.
blessed you are, fray Cicillo.

380
00:35:00,864 --> 00:35:04,407
I would be glad
If he save me from the wasps!

381
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:08,298
Lady Fortune,
touch me with your magical stick.

382
00:36:08,987 --> 00:36:09,980
You really want it?

383
00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:12,470
You really want it?

384
00:36:25,168 --> 00:36:26,400
a minute of patience, Mister...

385
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:28,298
... forgive me what I am going to do

386
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,670
Like you in the Temple of Jerusalem:
When it is necessary to go. Go ahead!

387
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,825
Let's go Ninetto, it's time to end
this!

388
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,545
It is, I am ready

389
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:20,337
Let's thank to the Lord

390
00:38:53,996 --> 00:38:56,531
- How, none comes?
- Keep silent yourself.

391
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,572
They don't answer. They don't answer.

392
00:39:11,905 --> 00:39:13,390
They don't answer.

393
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:15,196
These dirty beasts!

394
00:39:33,348 --> 00:39:36,158
science, yes, science.

395
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:40,086
It is the faith which you need,
not science.

396
00:39:41,942 --> 00:39:44,512
It seems that I have not had
sufficient faith

397
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:49,445
Lord, I have not had enough faith

398
00:39:54,752 --> 00:39:57,596
Can I play a little hopscotch?

399
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,234
Why you look at me?
just a little bit...

400
00:40:01,852 --> 00:40:04,661
It's two years I did not play.

401
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:08,718
Go ahead, my son, go.

402
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:09,804
... play, play.

403
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:12,774
What can I say?

404
00:40:13,023 --> 00:40:16,632
A little disaster. We must begin again

405
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:54,658
I have found!

406
00:40:55,829 --> 00:41:00,398
I found it. At Easter,
everything will be done.

407
00:41:00,568 --> 00:41:03,491
The sparrows do not speak
while chirping.

408
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:06,544
How stupid I have been!
How stupid!

409
00:41:24,104 --> 00:41:27,508
Lord, I hope that it works
this time.

410
00:41:28,642 --> 00:41:32,227
How, therefore, the sparrows
spoke between them?

411
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:34,899
What have learned fray
Ciccillo...

412
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:37,450
... after his long
meditations?

413
00:41:37,484 --> 00:41:41,966
It is simple: the sparrows
communicated while hopping.

414
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:52,727
Sparrows, come, listen...

415
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,662
Come, listen...

416
00:41:54,985 --> 00:41:56,343
Who  are you? What do you want?

417
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:59,160
We are servants of the Lord, we
bring good news to you.

418
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:01,681
We awaited it since so long time!

419
00:42:01,931 --> 00:42:04,901
Really? Did you await it?

420
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:06,949
Yes, specially in winter...

421
00:42:07,232 --> 00:42:10,395
when not one grain was in the field
to eat.

422
00:42:10,645 --> 00:42:13,774
A moment! What good news are
you waiting?

423
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:17,828
news of a lot of wheat and millit.

424
00:42:18,074 --> 00:42:22,608
How exhausting is to bring
good news!

425
00:42:22,893 --> 00:42:26,261
well? What news you
brought to us?

426
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:27,992
The Lent

427
00:42:28,314 --> 00:42:30,232
What? What do you say?

428
00:42:30,402 --> 00:42:33,608
The Lent... But not until
the death of hunger!

429
00:42:33,642 --> 00:42:37,752
The sacrifice... the love...
Oh Lord, the love!

430
00:42:38,553 --> 00:42:40,472
Love...

431
00:42:40,963 --> 00:42:42,527
Love!

432
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,615
LOVE!

433
00:42:48,673 --> 00:42:51,037
My Lord Almighty...

434
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:53,201
... what joy of seeing the sun.

435
00:42:53,411 --> 00:42:56,015
And what joy of seeing water....

436
00:42:56,182 --> 00:42:58,911
... Thus, the dirty man can wash himself.

437
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:02,802
Are you pleasured fray Cicillo...
Eh?

438
00:43:04,413 --> 00:43:07,977
Blessed be the Lord, for this
donkey...

439
00:43:08,229 --> 00:43:10,067
... for all these sheep...

440
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,193
-... and this shepherd.
- Amen

441
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:17,659
Blessed be the Lord...

442
00:43:18,027 --> 00:43:20,345
... for this blessed world

443
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:22,911
... where all can live

444
00:43:22,939 --> 00:43:25,012
-... even those that cannot.
- Amen

445
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,988
Blessed is the fresh grass,
the nettle, the chicory

446
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,563
... And God glorifie those who eat it.

447
00:43:38,426 --> 00:43:41,635
And curs those who die in the sin....

448
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:44,243
... that displeases me to see these
horrible funerals

449
00:43:48,747 --> 00:43:53,394
Blessed the Lord, for the
kindness that lives in the hearts

450
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:57,094
and because everything what He gives us
is rose and flowers

451
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,668
Why? Why?... that?

452
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:32,269
Brother Francisco,
we converted the hawks

453
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,645
and the hawks, in their way
praise to the Lord

454
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:40,423
and soon, brother Francisco,
We also converted the sparrows.

455
00:44:40,587 --> 00:44:47,374
and the sparrows, in their way
although with pain, praise to the Lord.

456
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:51,587
But between those two species ...

457
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:53,830
...they are massacred.

458
00:44:54,722 --> 00:44:59,941
What to do so that the sparrows
and hawks will...

459
00:45:00,103 --> 00:45:02,261
...  be put in agreement among
them?

460
00:45:02,674 --> 00:45:05,803
"What to do?" Everything can be
done with the help of the Lord.

461
00:45:06,207 --> 00:45:08,086
- What it means?
- What it means?

462
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:12,348
you must go to
teach them...

463
00:45:12,511 --> 00:45:15,845
... everything what they have not
understood you must explain them

464
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,500
- What?
- What?

465
00:45:18,013 --> 00:45:21,016
It is necessary to change this world,
fray Ciccillo

466
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,389
This is what you don't understand

467
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,900
One day a man with blue eyes come
and say:

468
00:45:28,212 --> 00:45:30,690
"We know that justice is progressive...

469
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:33,947
...according to slow progress of society,...

470
00:45:34,115 --> 00:45:37,644
"... we know conscience in its
imperfection wakes up...

471
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:39,853
"... and infiltrate in the world,
shouting and yeling..

472
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:43,181
"... about his inequality
that afflicts the humanity."

473
00:45:43,793 --> 00:45:49,686
This inequality between classes, nations...

474
00:45:49,897 --> 00:45:53,346
... isn't the most serious threats
against peace?

475
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:57,599
Go and start again for
the glory of the Lord.

476
00:45:58,129 --> 00:46:00,527
Come, Nine, we start again

477
00:46:04,313 --> 00:46:07,965
Come, my son, don't
discouraged yourself.

478
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,707
Courage, let us go... With joy...

479
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:01,314
If you are in doubts or distracted,

480
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:04,789
Let's recal that the Crow
is an intellectual of lefts...

481
00:47:04,953 --> 00:47:06,927
... before the
death of Palmiro Togliatti.

482
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:11,794
With permission.

483
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:16,575
DISCHARGE PROHIBITED

484
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:28,229
Dad, what will I do now?

485
00:47:31,465 --> 00:47:32,537
attack(load)!

486
00:47:32,748 --> 00:47:35,553
PRIVATE PROPERTY

487
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,450
"You're with me in the car
that arrives to town with the sun"

488
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:21,236
How is called the man who went
on the moon?...Gagarin?

489
00:48:21,297 --> 00:48:23,331
Dad, I don't know

490
00:48:23,382 --> 00:48:26,825
Look... the moon seems so far...

491
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,506
... goes to sleep and ...

492
00:48:28,713 --> 00:48:31,222
and they try to conquer him...

493
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:35,014
You see?... It seems to me that
I am only one to see.

494
00:48:35,649 --> 00:48:37,683
I also see it

495
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:39,336
I know, I know.

496
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:20,698
Bastards, hooligans!
You all come here!

497
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:22,545
One day I will shoot you!

498
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,657
It is not a public toilet here.

499
00:49:24,718 --> 00:49:26,952
I cannot see here all the day ...

500
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:30,616
...as they make dirt on my field,
I have young daughters.

501
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:32,672
Bring them here!

502
00:49:32,933 --> 00:49:36,006
these things are against law,
disgusting!

503
00:49:36,176 --> 00:49:37,659
I will denunciate you.

504
00:49:38,221 --> 00:49:40,820
What?... we fertilized the soil,
you would have to pay to us.

505
00:49:41,026 --> 00:49:43,565
Take that fertilizer and take it
to your house with you

506
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:47,092
You are joking or serious?

507
00:49:47,601 --> 00:49:50,639
I don't joke, take that
nastiness because if not...

508
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:52,046
If not... What?!

509
00:49:52,577 --> 00:49:54,813
Because if not, I will shoot you.
Severa, my riffle!

510
00:49:54,871 --> 00:49:56,535
... I am going to kill you

511
00:49:57,182 --> 00:50:00,466
The joke isn't bad... Eh?
but now, I have enough of it.

512
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:18,863
Severina, the riffle!

513
00:50:19,073 --> 00:50:20,396
Shoot, shoot!

514
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:51,578
For a handspan of soil
the war burst...

515
00:50:51,786 --> 00:50:55,070
Now you escape, you are scared...
Eh?

516
00:51:09,386 --> 00:51:10,582
Help, mamma!

517
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:13,548
Papa... Run!

518
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:20,000
<And our cartridges were full of butts
full of butts...>

519
00:51:23,738 --> 00:51:27,120
It was necessary to act like Gandhi!
To shake your handkerchief...

520
00:51:28,067 --> 00:51:31,591
... put your excrement at it,
and take it away

521
00:51:32,024 --> 00:51:36,836
Thus you would leave him there like
a clown, the owner on his property.

522
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,035
It's time to end the wars

523
00:51:54,287 --> 00:51:56,647
We must fight united for peace

524
00:52:08,398 --> 00:52:10,393
Is anobody in this house?

525
00:52:10,843 --> 00:52:13,603
You are all dead? Revive!

526
00:52:19,062 --> 00:52:20,463
By the body of Baco...

527
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:23,225
Where you hide yourselves, died of
hunger?

528
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,276
What devils put you up there?

529
00:52:29,444 --> 00:52:31,006
You do not answer?

530
00:52:33,053 --> 00:52:34,888
Ssssh... Silence!

531
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:45,749
Speak quietly, good morning

532
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:49,126
Speak quietly not to wake up the
children.

533
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:51,052
- At this hour?
- Come in.

534
00:53:11,419 --> 00:53:14,328
Sleep!, it still is the night, sleep!

535
00:53:14,626 --> 00:53:16,377
Quickly, the fact...either the money
or I put the subject

536
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:20,359
into the hands of lawyers and
morning happens what must happen.

537
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:21,800
Bravo, Dad!

538
00:53:23,068 --> 00:53:26,104
Look, Mr Marcello. As they are
the things in here

539
00:53:26,312 --> 00:53:27,604
we do not have anything

540
00:53:28,032 --> 00:53:29,593
You must be a little patient

541
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:33,647
We already gave you the pig,

542
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:37,802
and before that the
wool mattresses and carpets.

543
00:53:38,294 --> 00:53:41,613
But this time? We do not
have anything to give you.

544
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:55,851
But who eats nests of swallows?

545
00:53:56,616 --> 00:53:59,010
The Chinese! The Chinese!

546
00:54:04,393 --> 00:54:07,198
Sleep, it is still the night. Sleep.

547
00:54:08,001 --> 00:54:12,163
It is a shack. But with the land
around...

548
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:14,452
... we will recover our money.

549
00:54:14,696 --> 00:54:16,258
No, not the house!

550
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:27,197
Have a mercy! Not the house, not the
house!

551
00:54:27,405 --> 00:54:29,765
I say the house! Exactly the house!

552
00:54:30,174 --> 00:54:31,299
Bravo, Dad!

553
00:54:37,026 --> 00:54:39,990
Sleep, it is still the night. Sleep!

554
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:46,438
4 days I keep the children
in the bed without eating...

555
00:54:46,647 --> 00:54:49,771
... 4 days I say to them that
it is a night.

556
00:54:50,095 --> 00:54:52,711
Because if they rise they will
want to eat.

557
00:54:52,781 --> 00:54:54,617
What will I give them?

558
00:54:54,827 --> 00:54:57,666
Madam, don't say that to me

559
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:59,668
I can do nothing

560
00:54:59,837 --> 00:55:02,356
Ask Blessed Virgin, instead of me

561
00:55:02,659 --> 00:55:05,564
"Bussines is bussines". Is it clear?

562
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,733
Ninetto, we go

563
00:55:13,788 --> 00:55:15,988
Do you want to say anything?

564
00:55:16,153 --> 00:55:18,958
If you must say me something
speak face to face.

565
00:55:20,524 --> 00:55:21,879
Anyway I am right

566
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:25,772
I do not say: "You have done badly"
I simply say...

567
00:55:26,038 --> 00:55:30,168
..."Attention, a larger fish
could eat you one day"

568
00:55:46,661 --> 00:55:48,384
The nest is on the table.

569
00:56:37,254 --> 00:56:39,295
Dear Sirs, excuse us...

570
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:43,830
would you to help us to push
this Cadillac that refuses to go?

571
00:56:44,871 --> 00:56:47,517
Now you will say to me:
"You are 4, all powerful."

572
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:49,593
Well... No! Well... No.

573
00:56:49,963 --> 00:56:53,176
This one here... Said with pardon...

574
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,513
... Have hemorroides.

575
00:56:54,855 --> 00:56:56,895
The other, you see by yourself...

576
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,299
Madam, it is not necessary
to explains anything

577
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:02,064
As for the third one...

578
00:57:02,592 --> 00:57:06,514
... Mister was in the manicurist
this morning,...

579
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,558
... and do not want to soil the hands

580
00:57:09,246 --> 00:57:11,048
accordingly, but quickly.

581
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:20,522
- one, two ,three... - Go ahead, Nino.
- but you too, dad.

582
00:58:08,013 --> 00:58:10,772
The hand of the Lord is
necessary to make it run.

583
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,699
Anyway, thanks for your cooperation

584
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:14,903
I present myself:

585
00:58:15,469 --> 00:58:17,750
Pasquale Beautiful Ear.

586
00:58:17,955 --> 00:58:18,992
Ciro "Koko"

587
00:58:19,198 --> 00:58:20,156
non convinced

588
00:58:20,361 --> 00:58:22,561
Urganda the Stranger

589
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:24,682
Hannibal the Vegetarian.

590
00:58:24,931 --> 00:58:26,572
and these, my little children...

591
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,540
Kienpaga-Pagapoco

592
00:58:28,747 --> 00:58:29,944
... Called "Ki"

593
00:58:30,151 --> 00:58:32,717
and Colgadodelcuello, called "Col".

594
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:34,275
Have you calluses?

595
00:58:35,362 --> 00:58:37,677
Don't speak to me about it, my good negro!

596
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,208
You know who walks
with the naked feet...

597
00:58:40,374 --> 00:58:44,456
... on ardent coals to burn the Spirit of
the Death?

598
00:58:45,185 --> 00:58:48,342
They do that in your village, I believe...
As for me, it is worse!

599
00:58:48,873 --> 00:58:50,788
I have miraculous remedy

600
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:54,235
do not listen to him, this remedy-there,

601
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:56,241
... he use it only for himself.

602
00:58:56,409 --> 00:58:58,211
He keeps the cream jealously .

603
00:58:58,374 --> 00:59:02,136
and leave it only to the one who
can afford it.

604
00:59:02,503 --> 00:59:04,499
Well, I can in some way...

605
00:59:04,668 --> 00:59:06,469
... If it is not much sacrifice
How much...?

606
00:59:07,193 --> 00:59:08,185
5 thousands

607
00:59:08,397 --> 00:59:10,870
< They agreed on a thousand.>

608
00:59:11,082 --> 00:59:12,644
People!... People!

609
00:59:16,574 --> 00:59:17,805
How much people!

610
00:59:44,236 --> 00:59:47,076
HOW ROME HAS RUINED THE WORLD

611
01:00:09,293 --> 01:00:11,606
We are in 2000 and continue
making these things

612
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:13,454
Poor ones!

613
01:00:58,441 --> 01:01:00,004
What happened?

614
01:01:00,568 --> 01:01:01,721
I know it.

615
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,527
Dad, run, run!

616
01:01:05,179 --> 01:01:06,695
Quickly, child is on the way

617
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:10,267
To your age... you would not have to see
these things.

618
01:01:11,794 --> 01:01:13,915
Hot water!... Hot water!

619
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,471
For what?

620
01:01:15,722 --> 01:01:17,637
I know for what. I have 18
children

621
01:01:18,689 --> 01:01:20,251
Hot water!

622
01:01:23,419 --> 01:01:25,334
Hot water boys!

623
01:02:25,037 --> 01:02:27,318
Another mouth but... Live Maria!

624
01:02:27,803 --> 01:02:29,445
It is a girl! Live Jesus!

625
01:02:31,692 --> 01:02:33,733
A big applause to mama!

626
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:59,189
Now you do not go to the first Church
that you find...

627
01:02:59,394 --> 01:03:00,749
... and you leave her there... Eh?

628
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:02,797
How will you call her?

629
01:03:03,282 --> 01:03:04,560
Nobody wanted her...

630
01:03:04,726 --> 01:03:07,291
... nobody waited for her
and she wanted to come.

631
01:03:07,452 --> 01:03:09,368
Yes!... You are Welcome(Benvenuta) !

632
01:03:09,857 --> 01:03:12,171
Yes, yes, Welcome, Welcome!

633
01:03:58,447 --> 01:03:59,438
Why do you laugh?

634
01:03:59,809 --> 01:04:01,564
Do you know what there is in this box?

635
01:04:01,773 --> 01:04:03,005
Read!

636
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:05,936
to read? It's 40 years that I
do not read

637
01:04:09,271 --> 01:04:10,592
Look here, stupid

638
01:04:12,678 --> 01:04:14,273
What is written on that small box?

639
01:04:15,123 --> 01:04:17,199
- imposible to solve it.
- Read!

640
01:04:17,448 --> 01:04:19,171
I do not understand anything

641
01:04:19,493 --> 01:04:21,933
Aaantic Contraceptive ....

642
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,861
They sold to you...

643
01:04:25,026 --> 01:04:26,861
the out-of-date contraceptive
pomade...

644
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,547
... poor men

645
01:04:29,395 --> 01:04:32,553
What poor men? And you laugh
at misfortunes of the others?

646
01:04:34,727 --> 01:04:36,450
What it means this pomada...

647
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:39,370
anti... anti-no-se-que-tiva?

648
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:42,297
you don't know it? How many
children do you have?

649
01:04:42,465 --> 01:04:43,582
18... why?

650
01:04:44,429 --> 01:04:46,344
If you had taken this medicine...

651
01:04:46,514 --> 01:04:48,634
... you would have had less
children.

652
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,235
And why less children?

653
01:04:51,606 --> 01:04:53,166
More than half of the beings...

654
01:04:53,329 --> 01:04:55,723
... who forms this evolved
humanity...

655
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:59,218
... is in state of a
wretched and intolerable suffering.

656
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,908
They suffer literally from hunger...

657
01:05:04,274 --> 01:05:06,714
it will be worse, they will have more
children...

658
01:05:06,879 --> 01:05:09,352
....and the hunger grows.
You do not believe?

659
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:14,437
Use your wives with more understanding.

660
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:19,150
Carmen,Carmen...

661
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,623
... You single one, you are not
enough to me, I need other three...

662
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,577
I will make a good pasta
and satisfy all three...

663
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,577
I am not satisfied
and you must understand it.

664
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:46,577
I hold my head high, like all
I hold my head high, like all

665
01:05:47,422 --> 01:05:51,131
The twilight of the great hopes...

666
01:05:51,579 --> 01:05:54,622
These poor trickers are the first
ones who stay in the shadow...

667
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:57,187
...in company of Rossellini and
Brecht,...

668
01:05:57,392 --> 01:05:59,958
While the workers, in this twilight...

669
01:06:00,158 --> 01:06:01,753
...they go every day ahead
... ahead

670
01:06:02,283 --> 01:06:05,123
The ideologies passed from mode,

671
01:06:05,289 --> 01:06:07,855
But here is one who continues
speaking...

672
01:06:08,217 --> 01:06:10,131
... no one knows of what.

673
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,694
... to the men who go, not
knowing where.

674
01:06:13,709 --> 01:06:15,544
CONGRESS OF DENTISTS BY DANTE

675
01:06:35,277 --> 01:06:39,118
the women finds professor Otto
Volanten extraordinary.

676
01:06:39,807 --> 01:06:43,090
But in fact he have removed all his
material...

677
01:06:43,255 --> 01:06:48,339
... from whole studies on
Dante by english professor F.Efamen

678
01:06:48,506 --> 01:06:50,741
... published in Oxford at the end of
1933.

679
01:06:50,912 --> 01:06:55,039
Fred Efame is, among others, the
author of the novel...

680
01:06:55,923 --> 01:06:58,362
"Under pants covered with blood in
Scotland Yard"

681
01:06:58,529 --> 01:07:02,689
... That is the source of all James
Bond

682
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:10,305
Please... What do you wish?

683
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,800
we have come to speak with Mr. engineer

684
01:07:15,486 --> 01:07:17,208
Please, this way.

685
01:08:09,527 --> 01:08:10,518
Be good....

686
01:08:10,889 --> 01:08:13,809
and learn, Nino.

687
01:08:14,016 --> 01:08:16,377
But Dad, one bite and he will
swallow me.

688
01:08:16,543 --> 01:08:17,773
You never understand anything

689
01:08:18,226 --> 01:08:20,028
This is a custom of affluent people

690
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:22,471
What do you find strange there?

691
01:08:22,837 --> 01:08:24,797
But what I have with these peoples?

692
01:08:25,162 --> 01:08:27,522
Your father have something, therefore
you have something too.

693
01:08:36,387 --> 01:08:37,458
Good morning, Mister

694
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:39,915
Excuse me if I can not rise, but...

695
01:08:40,155 --> 01:08:42,390
You have come to make your duty, I
suppose.

696
01:08:42,802 --> 01:08:44,318
Today it is the 25th,...

697
01:08:44,525 --> 01:08:47,605
end of the contract, if I am not
mistaken.

698
01:08:48,214 --> 01:08:50,972
It was my intention.

699
01:08:51,621 --> 01:08:53,296
I will explain you.

700
01:08:53,987 --> 01:08:56,586
With all the snow that has fallen...

701
01:08:56,753 --> 01:08:59,318
... two hectares of cabbages has frozen

702
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:02,203
I did not gain a lira there.

703
01:09:02,886 --> 01:09:05,645
And this imbecile here...

704
01:09:07,095 --> 01:09:08,373
... all Sundays...

705
01:09:08,539 --> 01:09:11,012
... took the tractor to go to celebration.

706
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:14,465
But as he is not good driver...

707
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:19,838
...On sunday crashed the 600.

708
01:09:20,973 --> 01:09:24,410
and I had to pay it... And money...

709
01:09:24,735 --> 01:09:28,372
and in addition I have another 18
children, you know

710
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:30,699
and only one could help me...

711
01:09:30,909 --> 01:09:34,068
... This idiot... have chosen
the occupation

712
01:09:34,678 --> 01:09:36,637
... He became a monk.

713
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:40,806
Engineer...

714
01:09:41,693 --> 01:09:42,924
... this beast...

715
01:09:43,738 --> 01:09:45,413
I am a businessman...

716
01:09:45,582 --> 01:09:47,942
... I make only businesses and I
take care of my businesses.

717
01:09:48,388 --> 01:09:49,744
Give me my money...

718
01:09:49,911 --> 01:09:53,003
... or you will go in prison.
It is simple!

719
01:09:59,293 --> 01:10:02,371
Have you seen?
Your mama and you don't believe

720
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:04,135
... that I am always in troubles.

721
01:10:05,025 --> 01:10:06,221
Excuse me, engineer

722
01:10:08,152 --> 01:10:10,912
I had prepared a bunch
of roses for Madam,

723
01:10:11,078 --> 01:10:12,801
... but I forgot it in the house

724
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:17,279
I will bring it another time.

725
01:10:17,654 --> 01:10:18,805
Ignoramus!

726
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:45,343
Every day the same

727
01:10:45,555 --> 01:10:47,676
Nothing will be able to change them.

728
01:10:52,492 --> 01:10:54,565
Where you go?
Does a race starts now?

729
01:10:55,378 --> 01:10:57,817
Where you go? Where you go?

730
01:10:59,105 --> 01:11:00,177
Run!

731
01:11:04,196 --> 01:11:05,350
Go!

732
01:11:07,565 --> 01:11:08,968
Run, run, Dad, go!

733
01:11:10,492 --> 01:11:11,688
Wait!

734
01:11:14,621 --> 01:11:15,737
I go!

735
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:19,629
Hurry up Dad, run, it will leave!

736
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,983
Patience...

737
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:37,503
We will take the next one.

738
01:11:47,694 --> 01:11:49,211
It's a great type that crow

739
01:11:49,379 --> 01:11:51,419
I did not believe it, but you
have seen

740
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:53,738
He was right, speaking badly
of those comedians

741
01:11:53,908 --> 01:11:57,909
I like only that bearded one
that made "Ta, ta, ta"

742
01:11:58,077 --> 01:12:00,152
It seemed to me that it
is only a part of bird.

743
01:12:05,615 --> 01:12:08,454
Dad... When I go to the factory...

744
01:12:08,622 --> 01:12:11,460
... with the first strike I return
to the villa of the Engineer...

745
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,907
... and I kill all the dogs.

746
01:12:14,073 --> 01:12:15,110
This will teach him,
you will come too... Eh?

747
01:12:15,717 --> 01:12:18,120
Sure! I will come, and...
"Ta,ta,ta there..."

748
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:49,902
Let's go, Nine.

749
01:15:13,218 --> 01:15:16,376
I do not ask you to where you go.

750
01:15:17,428 --> 01:15:21,145
the end will come,
and I, who so many things know...

751
01:15:21,315 --> 01:15:23,150
... this will never know.

752
01:15:24,723 --> 01:15:26,763
The way begins...

753
01:15:27,409 --> 01:15:29,325
... and the trip is already
finished.

754
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:04,447
What are you doing?

755
01:16:05,454 --> 01:16:07,289
I watch the swallows.

756
01:16:07,659 --> 01:16:08,937
What is your name?

757
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:10,581
Luna

758
01:16:19,485 --> 01:16:21,641
100 meters beyond...

759
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:26,410
Help!

760
01:16:26,581 --> 01:16:28,542
Ay,ay... my belly! What could it be?

761
01:16:29,147 --> 01:16:30,025
My God

762
01:16:30,951 --> 01:16:32,353
It is not possible

763
01:16:32,595 --> 01:16:33,917
It starts again.

764
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:36,554
I have belly-ache

765
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,720
It makes glu, glu, glu...

766
01:16:40,212 --> 01:16:43,131
I do not hold it! I return immediately.

767
01:17:21,985 --> 01:17:23,387
Eh, brunette!

768
01:17:37,099 --> 01:17:39,704
Ah, Luna, Luna, what effect you
have on me!

769
01:17:43,914 --> 01:17:45,830
Let's go there. It is a
good place.

770
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,115
They cut the grass.

771
01:17:48,645 --> 01:17:50,240
That smells so good.

772
01:17:54,697 --> 01:17:56,135
What you have eaten at noon?

773
01:17:56,662 --> 01:17:59,388
To tell the truth, I have still
not had breakfast.

774
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,026
I have eaten in house of my sister

775
01:18:02,275 --> 01:18:04,430
Roasted with spinach

776
01:18:06,085 --> 01:18:08,809
As I had said to you,
do you feel this perfume?

777
01:18:45,972 --> 01:18:49,815
Ah, It is better now! Come,
Let's go.

778
01:18:50,022 --> 01:18:51,938
What a pain!

779
01:18:52,106 --> 01:18:54,307
I have a scouring.

780
01:18:54,472 --> 01:18:55,748
It's truth Dad...

781
01:18:55,955 --> 01:18:58,350
What we  have eaten today?
I can't hold it!

782
01:18:59,042 --> 01:19:00,907
Wait here, I return
immediately.

783
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:03,522
Where you go, cretino, come here!

784
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:22,166
Luna, 
Are you deaf?

785
01:19:23,015 --> 01:19:25,056
Luna, I am his son!

786
01:19:26,263 --> 01:19:27,380
I suspected it.

787
01:19:34,882 --> 01:19:37,037
You have face of altar boy

788
01:19:37,769 --> 01:19:39,968
Hell, what a beautiful tits!

789
01:19:40,414 --> 01:19:42,650
More beautiful than those of
"Maria of the balcony"

790
01:19:43,221 --> 01:19:44,292
What that?

791
01:19:45,105 --> 01:19:47,944
countrywoman that we visited my
friends and I

792
01:19:48,112 --> 01:19:49,753
But she is not young

793
01:19:49,996 --> 01:19:52,116
Have a fat belly like that...

794
01:19:52,362 --> 01:19:55,165
...a thin leg and the other enormous one.

795
01:19:55,407 --> 01:19:56,970
In addition do not have nose

796
01:19:57,211 --> 01:20:00,051
Have two eyes, mouth, but the nose...

797
01:20:02,576 --> 01:20:04,058
Did I make you laugh?

798
01:20:06,626 --> 01:20:08,780
I like people like you

799
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,350
With your father also I
laughed much.

800
01:20:21,739 --> 01:20:23,335
Everything all right, doctor?

801
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:30,831
Eeeeeh.....You!
Professors eat the piquant sauce...

802
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,561
... said  Giorgio
Pasquali.

803
01:20:32,804 --> 01:20:35,165
But who that eats and
digests...

804
01:20:35,409 --> 01:20:38,293
,.. also become a little
professor.

805
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:49,241
Already I feel better

806
01:20:49,441 --> 01:20:51,434
Let's go.

807
01:20:52,366 --> 01:20:53,762
And don't eat any more these filths,...

808
01:20:54,011 --> 01:20:55,528
... it makes you sick again.

809
01:21:02,951 --> 01:21:06,545
Eh, whatever problems could be
spoken with regard to the whores

810
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,964
And the crow continued speaking,
speaking,speaking,...

811
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:14,535
God, Family, Fatherland...
How much I could dispute them.

812
01:21:15,218 --> 01:21:16,780
Today, it's not worth it...

813
01:21:17,102 --> 01:21:19,987
perhaps already I am finished.

814
01:21:20,471 --> 01:21:22,430
My hour have come

815
01:21:22,675 --> 01:21:24,875
My words fall in the emptiness

816
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,001
Mr. Toto, I'm not complaining...

817
01:21:27,165 --> 01:21:30,209
...to see disappearing
all that I defended.

818
01:21:30,453 --> 01:21:33,850
Another will come to take my torch

819
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,980
...and will hold it up high.

820
01:21:36,425 --> 01:21:38,786
Then I will cry over my fate.

821
01:21:39,031 --> 01:21:42,510
It is human, when one feels that
no longer will count

822
01:22:39,647 --> 01:22:41,130
Master...do you allow me?

823
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:44,335
to say something to this
idiot?

824
01:22:50,354 --> 01:22:51,797
- I will eat it
- What?

825
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:53,402
- We will eat it
- What?

826
01:22:53,759 --> 01:22:56,855
If we won't eat it,
another one will.

827
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:59,399
In addition I believe that
already it's getting mad

828
01:22:59,651 --> 01:23:01,567
You are right... I think so...

829
01:23:01,737 --> 01:23:04,540
It'll teach him not to put feet
into another ones. How we will eat him?

830
01:23:05,425 --> 01:23:06,336
Like the old ones...

831
01:23:06,507 --> 01:23:08,661
... we clear the skin and ate
the fruit

832
01:23:24,081 --> 01:23:26,187
It is so good, the small fish.

833
01:24:06,601 --> 01:24:08,836
< Dear friends >

834
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:13,054
< Like always >

835
01:24:14,097 --> 01:24:16,297
< It finishes thus. It starts thus >

836
01:24:16,544 --> 01:24:19,223
< It is completed thus.
It continues thus >

837
01:24:19,831 --> 01:24:21,871
< This history >

838
01:24:22,116 --> 01:24:26,004
< OF THE LARGE AND SMALL BIRDS >
