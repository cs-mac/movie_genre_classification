1
00:00:01,053 --> 00:00:05,149
# Baby, who wants to love me sexy? #

2
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:10,019
# Baby, who's ready to lick me sexy? #

3
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:17,334
# Baby, we're naked
and we're humpin' sexy #

4
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,270
# Love me sexy! #

5
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:29,880
# Come on, girl. Yeah #

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,716
# It's me, Jackie Moon #

7
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:35,384
# Give me that look, that's right #

8
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:38,621
# Let's get sweaty,
let's get real sweaty #

9
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:41,493
# I'm talkin' rainforest sweaty #

10
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:44,430
# I'm talkin' swamp sweaty #

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,233
# Let's fill the bathtub full of sweat,
all right #

12
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:55,005
# Baby, who wants to love me sexy? #

13
00:00:55,105 --> 00:01:00,410
# Baby are you ready to lick me sexy? #

14
00:01:01,914 --> 00:01:04,749
# Baby, wake up, we're naked #

15
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,119
# And we're humpin' sexy #

16
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,487
# Come on, girl #

17
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:14,122
# Baby, who wants to love me sexy? #

18
00:01:14,222 --> 00:01:15,391
# Love me sexy #

19
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:18,919
# Baby, are you ready
to lick me sexy? #

20
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:21,029
# Lick me sexy #

21
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:24,064
# Take off your shoes
and suck me sexy #

22
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:26,769
# Suck, suck,
suck, suck, suck me sexy #

23
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:30,540
# Baby, we're naked
and we're humpin' sexy #

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,877
- # Whoo! #
- # Humpin' sexy #

25
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:35,578
# I wanna do a little thing wit' you #

26
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,382
# I wanna do a little thing wit' you #

27
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:41,415
# When I say "love me" you say "sexy" #

28
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:43,051
# Love me #

29
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:46,457
- Sexy.
- Oh, yeah, Flint Tropics crowd!

30
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:50,159
Get it goin'.
It feels good, doesn't it?

31
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,564
I see some ladies up there
who wanna love me sexy.

32
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:55,433
Jackie Moon soaking up
a robust round of applause...

33
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:59,703
as he finishes up his
once-popular song, Love Me Sexy.

34
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:01,707
I'm Dick Pepperfield joined,
as always...

35
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:04,508
by former Tropics forward
Lou Redwood.

36
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:06,641
Yeah, I might suit up tonight.

37
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:08,912
Sometimes I still dream of glory, Dick.

38
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:12,382
Well, sometimes dreams
can turn into nightmares, Lou.

39
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:14,481
What's your problem?

40
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:16,685
And now, the starting lineup...

41
00:02:16,785 --> 00:02:21,559
for your Flint, Michigan Tropics!

42
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:27,432
At Ball Girl, measuring 34-23-34...

43
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:29,435
she hopes to be
an astronaut one day...

44
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:31,268
I don't think she can do it.

45
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:35,938
Put your hands together for Melinda!

46
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:38,343
Go Tropics!

47
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:39,812
From South Bend, Indiana...

48
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:43,580
this guy has a heart of gold,
his brother's a retard.

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,782
He reads to him
and paints him pretty pictures...

50
00:02:46,882 --> 00:02:49,620
Scootsie Doubleday!

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,922
Scootsie Doubleday
taking the court now.

52
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:53,791
Yeah, his brother
is really retarded.

53
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:54,821
Ronnie Doubleday.

54
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:57,695
He has all three
major kinds of retardation.

55
00:02:57,795 --> 00:03:01,532
This guy is single
and disease-free, no V.D. At all...

56
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:04,565
but you could be the lucky girl
to give it to him!

57
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:05,937
Six foot five!

58
00:03:06,037 --> 00:03:08,407
Twiggy Munson!

59
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:09,639
Of course he's disease-free.

60
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,509
What chick wants to be with a guy
that's hung like a twig?

61
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,411
Well, that's not true.
I've heard a lot of women say...

62
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:14,846
that they actually prefer a small penis.

63
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:17,546
Show me one gal who says that
and I'll show you a liar.

64
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:20,080
I'll introduce you to
Mrs. Pepperfield later on tonight.

65
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,384
Oh, Jesus, here we go.

66
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:22,618
Your man in the middle...

67
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:23,920
seven foot two...

68
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,859
from a weird country called Lithuania.

69
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,024
He's ugly as shit.

70
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:33,831
- Vakidis!
- Go, daddy!

71
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:35,097
- This fella scares me.
- Yeah!

72
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:37,631
That little kid from the Jackson Five,
he scares ya too.

73
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:39,138
Oh, mark my words, Lou...

74
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:41,370
there's something creepy
about that young man.

75
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,038
Bobby Dee, where's Clarence?

76
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:44,673
- Nobody's heard from him.
- Come on, Tropics!

77
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:46,077
Bee Bee!

78
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:47,546
You're startin'.

79
00:03:47,646 --> 00:03:49,779
From Peoria, Illinois...

80
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,149
this guy,
what can I say about him?

81
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:54,181
He's got the hottest girl in the world,
I'm not kiddin'.

82
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:55,620
Cannons, people.

83
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,252
Big ol' boobies.

84
00:03:57,352 --> 00:04:03,161
The luckiest man in Flint...
Bee Bee Ellis!

85
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:04,962
Well, it's true about
what they say about Bee Bee's wife.

86
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:07,129
She has got a tremendous set of boobs.

87
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:08,600
To me, they're too large.

88
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,102
Oh, they're perfect.

89
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:13,600
I don't know, they... To me
she looks structurally unsound.

90
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,771
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

91
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:21,443
At six foot five,
a solid, meaty 215 pounds...

92
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:24,715
your pregame announcer,
your owner, your coach...

93
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:27,849
your pop singing sensation,
but most importantly...

94
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:29,220
your power forward...

95
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,089
yours truly, Jackie Moon!

96
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:36,560
All right!

97
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,463
Jackie Moon
always gives himself...

98
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:40,466
a fantastic introduction.

99
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:41,799
- Yeah, why not, Dick?
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

100
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:44,933
It's his team, his money and
his tunnel of beautiful ball girls.

101
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:48,002
Oh, speaking of money, Lou,
did you get paid this week?

102
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:49,036
No.

103
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:50,773
You lose weight, Father Pat?

104
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,805
Fuck off, Jackie.

105
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:55,713
All right, guys, huddle up.
Vakidis!

106
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:57,879
What is he doin'?
You know what? Fuck it.

107
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,352
Listen, I promised these fans
a show tonight, all right?

108
00:05:00,452 --> 00:05:02,951
Twiggy, if you get a dunk tonight
try to break that backboard, all right?

109
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:04,620
- We'll get that on the news.
- All right.

110
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,957
Let's bring it in,
it's showtime, right? Let's get...

111
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,522
Tropical!

112
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:11,062
Go Tropics!

113
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:13,429
Right here, right here, right here!

114
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,232
I don't like it.

115
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:16,533
Back! Back!

116
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:19,235
Clear!
Yep, that feels good. That feels...

117
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:21,870
- Danny, what are ya doin'?
- Nothin'. Eatin' nachos.

118
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,274
You get 'em from the concession stand?

119
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:25,975
- Nah, I brought 'em from home.
- What?

120
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,508
No, no, no, no, no.

121
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:28,981
Oh, come on!

122
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:30,179
- What?
- Travel!

123
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,347
He brought nachos from home.
Tryin' to run a business here.

124
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:34,286
- You can't call that.
- Jackie, you gotta dribble...

125
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:35,315
if you're gonna move.

126
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:36,619
What are you talkin' about?

127
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,523
- Basketball rules.
- Fine.

128
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:40,959
I got season tickets.
I can do whatever the hell I want.

129
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:42,687
Oh, yeah?
Well, I can do this.

130
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:44,994
And this.

131
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,231
And that!

132
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:49,892
Let's go, Trops!

133
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:53,567
We are well underway
and the big question, Lou...

134
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:57,306
where is Tropics' leading scorer,
Clarence "Downtown" Malone?

135
00:05:57,406 --> 00:05:59,542
I agree, it's completely
unprofessional, Dick.

136
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:01,547
Lou, can I ask you
to please put out your cigarette?

137
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:03,712
No, I like to smoke when I drink.

138
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:10,210
All right, fans, let's hear it for
"Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone!

139
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:16,423
Go Clarence!

140
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:18,093
That's my son.

141
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:21,162
Downtown wastes no time
tagging out Bee Bee Ellis...

142
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:23,135
and Munson passes him the ball
immediately.

143
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:26,037
Downtown dribbles the ball through
his legs... I love it when he does that.

144
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,040
He's making mincemeat
of his defender here.

145
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,474
Downtown!

146
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:31,775
If you want it!
If you... Only if you want it!

147
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,942
You don't want it, I can feel it.
You don't want it, OK.

148
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:36,111
That's right, Nets.

149
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:37,262
You're not gonna stop it.

150
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:39,118
Believe me, we don't
stop it in practice.

151
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:40,181
- Let's do it!
- Come on, come on, come on!

152
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,810
- Go!
- You got it.

153
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:44,118
He tosses a three...

154
00:06:44,218 --> 00:06:45,523
And, yes!

155
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:47,622
- Wow! That was quite a shot.
- Pounce!

156
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,388
Yeah!

157
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,398
At halftime, it's the Nets 62...

158
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,991
Flint Tropics 43.

159
00:06:57,536 --> 00:06:59,736
All right, everybody,
let's hear it for Tropical time...

160
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,932
and let's hear it for Busch Bavarian.

161
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:07,708
If you're gonna drink a beer, you
might as well make it Busch Bavarian.

162
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:10,547
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want you to welcome this man...

163
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:15,650
who's gonna attempt the impossible...
the $10,000 free throw...

164
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,819
from the other side of the court.
The Moon shot.

165
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,224
- Right on.
- All right. Tell everybody...

166
00:07:20,324 --> 00:07:22,160
- what's your name?
- Dukes.

167
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,724
- All right, Dukes.
- Dukes!

168
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:25,793
- Dukes, where ya from?
- Flint, Michigan...

169
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:27,229
and I never missed a game!

170
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,063
Go!

171
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:30,833
Dukes is homegrown.

172
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:34,334
I think you're on a little somethin'
that's homegrown maybe, huh?

173
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:35,936
We're havin' fun.

174
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:37,475
Dukes, what do you do for a livin'?

175
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:40,774
Nothin' right now.

176
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:41,977
OK.

177
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:43,036
Layin' low.

178
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:46,415
Dukes is excited!

179
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:47,616
So am I.

180
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:50,589
Come on, let's go, people.
Let's get it goin'.

181
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:54,588
Cheer this guy on
as he prepares for the impossible.

182
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:57,124
Well, we've got
an especially dirty hippie here...

183
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:59,193
down on the court tryin' to sink
an impossible shot.

184
00:07:59,293 --> 00:08:01,700
This is human drama at its best.

185
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,232
He's just focusing, taking a moment
to concentrate. That's OK.

186
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:08,296
Concentrate all you want.

187
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:12,042
- Come on, Dukes!
- All right.

188
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:15,781
- No!
- Yes!

189
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:17,748
Holy shit, I'm a miracle!

190
00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:22,053
Yeah!

191
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:24,219
Father Pat, he stepped on the line.
He stepped on it.

192
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,286
- No, no, it was legal.
- No, no...

193
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:26,555
he stepped on the line,
You were lookin' at it. Come on.

194
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:27,857
Jackie, he made the shot.

195
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:29,861
Who the hell has $10,000?

196
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:31,661
Relax, the beer company'll pay him.

197
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,823
They're not really a sponsor,
it just sounded professional.

198
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:37,800
Look at this guy. He's so hopped up
on goofballs and grass...

199
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,400
he's got no idea what's going on.

200
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,170
Holy crap.

201
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,674
Tropical!

202
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:46,577
Hey, congratulations to Dukes!

203
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:52,349
He just won a giant check
that says $10,000.

204
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,049
Cool!

205
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,454
Look at the size of that thing!

206
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:58,018
Go have yourself a ball!

207
00:08:58,118 --> 00:09:00,891
Second half, comin' up next!

208
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:02,017
Damn it!

209
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:06,624
- # Hi #
- # Hello #

210
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:14,268
# Get the funk outta my face #

211
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:17,107
# Get the funk
outta my face #

212
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,807
# Get the funk outta my face #

213
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:21,611
# Get the funk outta my face #

214
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:25,612
# You don't like my music
You don't have to use it #

215
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:30,684
# Funking is a thing
that all of us release #

216
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,286
# You don't have to get it #

217
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:34,990
# All you do is let it #

218
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,461
# Then you'll know
exactly how to groove #

219
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:43,730
#... More, more, more #

220
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,903
# Now he's back home doing 9 to 5 #

221
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:51,342
# Living his gray flannel life #

222
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:53,575
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey, guys, everything good?

223
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:55,840
- Keep the drinks flowin'.
- You got it.

224
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:59,881
# More, more, more #

225
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:02,819
# Gitchi, gitchi, ya ya da da da #

226
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:11,756
You're a sexy town, Flint.

227
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:14,121
Look at you, I love it.

228
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,664
I swear, if this Plexiglass
wasn't dividing us right now...

229
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:23,040
I'd make sweet, tender,
slow, hot love...

230
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,604
to each one of you,
that's a guarantee.

231
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:29,446
# Baby, who wants to love me sexy? #

232
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,511
# Love me sexy #

233
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:32,247
# Baby, are you ready to lick... #

234
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:33,847
- #... me sexy? #
- I'm tellin' ya, man...

235
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:36,321
that's the word on the street
and the shit is messed up.

236
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:37,519
It's a dang shame.

237
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:40,655
I can't go back to working
at that car wash. No.

238
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:43,161
I know there's some team out there
that can use the services of...

239
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,563
"Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone,
you hear me?

240
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:49,231
I dig you, brother, but I heard
the problem ain't just here in Flint.

241
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:51,298
It's the whole league
that's goin' under.

242
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:52,968
Hey, guys, what's shakin'?

243
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:54,973
What's shakin'?
Whole league goin' down...

244
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:58,376
- that's what's shaking.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

245
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:01,313
I don't know who you're talkin' to
but business is boomin'.

246
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:05,683
Jackie, come on, man, it's us.
You ain't got to jive us, man.

247
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:07,484
I'm not jivin' you.
I've never jived you my whole life.

248
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,517
Jackie, come on, you're jivin' us now
by sayin' you don't be jivin' us.

249
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:12,789
OK, well, this time
I'm tellin' the truth.

250
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:13,847
Right.

251
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,996
Now if I give you the lowdown on
somethin', can you keep a secret?

252
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:19,025
- Yeah.
- Course.

253
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:23,659
Tomorrow mornin', I'm drivin'
to Indianapolis for a league meeting...

254
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:28,105
possibly talking...

255
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:29,973
- merger.
- A merger?

256
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:32,039
Flint Tropics in the NBA.

257
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:33,342
- The NBA?
- Us mergin'?

258
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,909
I'm Jackie Moon,
I take care of you guys, right?

259
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,477
I mean, you can just think of me
as Bambi's mother.

260
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:39,783
I make sure nothing
bad'll happen to you.

261
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:41,584
Drink up, this is a big night.

262
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:43,086
- Hey, drinks on me.
- Big night.

263
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:47,688
Bambi's mother got shot, right?

264
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:49,723
Yeah, first scene.

265
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:53,287
I remember that the credits
were still rollin' and everything.

266
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:57,760
Who the fuck is Bambi?

267
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,480
Merger. Merger.

268
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,581
Merger.

269
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:15,216
Jackie Moon. Jackie Moon.

270
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:16,418
America.

271
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:17,552
Let's go.

272
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:19,654
Let's do this.

273
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:21,823
Don't worry, Mom,
I won't let you down.

274
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:24,954
I'll keep this team alive.

275
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:31,099
And our TV stations are complaining
about all the fighting.

276
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,025
Let's try to keep the
fights in the tunnel...

277
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,736
or out in the parking lot.

278
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:38,710
We have one more
piece of business to go over.

279
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,411
I'm sure you've all heard the rumors,
and they are true...

280
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,883
the ABA will be merging
with the NBA...

281
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:47,048
at the end of this season.

282
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:50,850
Yes. Yes.

283
00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:54,759
I did it.

284
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,261
I'm a real owner.

285
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:59,630
- Please, Jackie, let go.
- I did it.

286
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,262
All right, let's...

287
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:02,599
not get too excited.

288
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,868
Yes!
Give me ten, Norton!

289
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:06,602
Everyone can eat shit!

290
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,805
A big bag of shit!

291
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:12,435
I'm the greatest man in the world!

292
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:16,645
The NBA has agreed
to our financial demands...

293
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,279
- but there is something else...
- You were right, Mom.

294
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:19,413
Destiny.

295
00:13:19,513 --> 00:13:23,017
I'm so happy
I can't even feel my arms!

296
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:24,990
OK, Jackie, listen to me. Jackie?

297
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,789
- Hey, Jackie?
- Yes?

298
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,627
Four teams will be absorbed
into the NBA next year.

299
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,597
The rest of the league
will terminate operations.

300
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:35,161
Exactly. You know it.

301
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:38,001
Wait.
Wait, what did you say?

302
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:41,405
The Nets, the Spurs,
the Pacers and the Nuggets...

303
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:43,206
are gonna play in the NBA next season.

304
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:46,042
- The rest of us are gonna dissolve.
- Dissolve?

305
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:48,013
What's "dissolve"?

306
00:13:48,113 --> 00:13:49,877
Is that even a word?

307
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,446
Yes, it is a word...

308
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:55,015
and financially it means
you'll cease to exist.

309
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:56,617
Let's don't get emotional about it.
Just...

310
00:13:56,717 --> 00:13:58,155
No!

311
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,658
No!

312
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,357
OK.

313
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:04,661
All right, you're being...
Well, Jackie. Jackie...

314
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,132
You... Don't bite yourself.
Come on.

315
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:10,501
Jackie, we agreed to a very large sum.

316
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,134
I don't want a large sum, OK?

317
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:15,939
I want my team.
Come on, you guys...

318
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,273
you're not gonna just sit there
and take the money, are you? Huh?

319
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:24,479
What do the Nets have
that I don't have? !

320
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:25,984
The Nets have a huge fan base.

321
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:27,317
They got a brand-new stadium.

322
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:30,219
Solid economic growth package
with great tax incentives.

323
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:35,288
Come on, Alan, that's bullshit!

324
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:38,526
The NBA's gonna
take four teams, Jackie.

325
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:39,894
This is a good deal.

326
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:47,531
Best four teams should go.

327
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:51,876
He's right.
The season isn't over yet.

328
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:54,210
Hey, you know what? Yeah,
everybody should have a chance.

329
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,444
That's the fairest way.

330
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:57,646
Aw, gee whiz...

331
00:14:57,746 --> 00:14:59,651
that sounds like so much fun...

332
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:01,350
fair and all.

333
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,984
But come on, guys...

334
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:05,187
I mean, look at what
we're dealing with here.

335
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:08,356
This guy plays power forward
for his own team, so...

336
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:09,861
But he has a point.

337
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:12,695
Why not make the terms of
a merger performance-based.

338
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:13,726
- Exactly.
- Huh?

339
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:14,862
- What he just said.
- Yeah.

340
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:16,598
I move we vote
on the terms of the merger.

341
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,401
- I second.
- And what he... what that guy said.

342
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,803
But... What both those guys said.

343
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:23,038
God damn it, Bob! I'm about to reach
over there and tear you a new asshole!

344
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,138
Don't be a jackass.

345
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:26,111
- It makes sense.
- Fuck you, Bob! We talked this out!

346
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:27,708
I don't see a need
for that kinda language.

347
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:29,377
Now, if you wanna go outside
right now...

348
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:32,114
I'll take both of you fuckers out
right damn now!

349
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:33,585
We're not gonna fight,
we're gonna vote!

350
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:35,385
- Let's vote!
- Let's vote...

351
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:36,720
and then we'll fight!

352
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,723
Come on, guys...

353
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:40,658
you should be juiced right now.

354
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:43,257
This is a chance to become
a real NBA franchise.

355
00:15:43,357 --> 00:15:44,594
Man, get outta town.

356
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,930
Ain't no way in Sam Hill
we gonna make it to fourth place.

357
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,196
- Nope.
- Yeah, Jackie...

358
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:49,999
we have a horseshit record right now.

359
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:52,937
Yeah, well, we just need to start
hittin' our threes, OK?

360
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:55,603
That's not the problem, Jackie.
The problem is...

361
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:57,039
we suck.

362
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,743
Scootsie, you did not deserve that.

363
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:02,507
- I know.
- I apologize.

364
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:05,416
Stop that shit, man.

365
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:08,651
We do not suck, OK?

366
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:11,184
I been doin' a lot of thinkin'.

367
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:15,289
Decided to add someone to our team
to add some real firepower, OK?

368
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:17,762
I think this guy
could give us a new spark.

369
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:19,456
Now, don't get mad.

370
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:22,099
- At point guard...
- At point guard?

371
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,765
...five-ten...

372
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:26,400
I traded away our
washing machine to get him.

373
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,435
He punches in bunches.

374
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:31,499
Ed Monix!

375
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,180
Toilet's clogged.

376
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,015
Hell, no.
You traded for Monix?

377
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:40,580
Yeah.

378
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,385
This guy's an old warrior, come on.

379
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:43,517
Yeah, he old.

380
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:45,686
He can shoot the basketball.

381
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:47,788
Most importantly,
he actually agreed to come here.

382
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:49,659
So?

383
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,032
It's a thrill to be in Flint.
Smells Tropical in here.

384
00:16:55,132 --> 00:16:57,665
Now, look, I know
just about everyone...

385
00:16:57,765 --> 00:17:00,200
in this locker room has been
punched in the face by this guy...

386
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,436
at some point in time.

387
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:03,773
And maybe even one of us has...

388
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:07,509
had his collarbone broken... twice.

389
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,541
Sorry, Twig.

390
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:10,110
Thanks, Ed.

391
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,449
Hey, how are your mom and sister?

392
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:15,116
It's been about 12 weeks
since I porked 'em.

393
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:19,720
Let's not talk about porking
of the moms and the sisters...

394
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,694
because we only have
one rule on this team.

395
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,359
What is that rule, Twiggy?

396
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,459
E-L-E.

397
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,195
That's right, E-L-E.

398
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,700
And what does "E-L-E" stand for?

399
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,033
"Everybody Love Everybody".

400
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,565
"Everybody Love Everybody".

401
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:34,004
Right there up on the wall.

402
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:35,805
Got that, Monix?

403
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:37,207
- Nope.
- Great.

404
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,576
'Cause this isn't just
a basketball team...

405
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:42,046
this is a lifestyle.

406
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:43,345
Welcome aboard, Monix.

407
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:44,681
Thank you.
Good to be here.

408
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:46,549
All right.

409
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,582
Oh, if you see a possum...

410
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:52,090
try to kill it, OK?

411
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,715
It's not a pet.

412
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:01,898
Welcome back to Tropics Weekly.

413
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,733
The ABA has announced...

414
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:08,105
that the top four teams will merge
with the NBA after this season.

415
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:09,135
Seizing the opportunity...

416
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:13,578
owner/player/coach Jackie Moon
has already made the first move...

417
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:16,142
acquiring Ed Monix
from the Kentucky Colonels.

418
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:17,379
Yeah!

419
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,047
I'm a pretty aggressive owner.

420
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:22,616
When I heard Kentucky needed
a washing machine, I looked at ours...

421
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:24,453
even though we need ours.

422
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:26,486
I said, "I gotta pull
the trigger on this."

423
00:18:26,586 --> 00:18:28,088
- Hey, honey!
- It seemed appropriate.

424
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:30,859
- Guess who got traded to Flint?
- Who?

425
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,089
Monix!

426
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:35,962
Why the hell would he
want to come to Flint?

427
00:18:37,302 --> 00:18:38,967
I have no idea.

428
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,334
Who cares, right? I mean...

429
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:44,173
He's got an NBA ring
and he's playing for the Tropics.

430
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:45,677
Can you believe that?

431
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:47,939
No, I can't.

432
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:51,848
I'll get it.

433
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:55,117
It's like, if you watch a porn movie,
doesn't mean you got laid.

434
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,320
No, no. In fact,
it often means the opposite.

435
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,691
Monix was an All-American
at Michigan State...

436
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,919
then went on to...

437
00:19:02,294 --> 00:19:03,324
- Hey.
- Hey.

438
00:19:03,424 --> 00:19:04,357
You look great.

439
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:05,418
Why are you here?

440
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:09,029
Got traded. Yeah. Yeah.

441
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:11,227
I mean, why are you here?

442
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:13,971
Can we talk?

443
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,503
- Monix!
- Hey.

444
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:18,537
- What's up?
- Yeah.

445
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:20,140
That ol' jump shot of yours
ain't broke yet, is it?

446
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,843
Not yet.

447
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:24,113
Man... hey!

448
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:25,144
Great backdoor cut...

449
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:27,714
for the lay-up against the Amigos
last Friday night, man.

450
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:30,587
Yeah. That's the way
basketball should be played!

451
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,651
- Yeah.
- Up there.

452
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:34,924
- Yeah...
- Too slow!

453
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,861
Hey, can you give us
a second, please?

454
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:40,261
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks, Kyle.

455
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:44,664
You're his favorite player.

456
00:19:44,764 --> 00:19:46,733
I'd feel more comfortable
if he hated me.

457
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:51,242
Listen, I hope you didn't agree
to this trade because of me.

458
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:54,611
What if I did?

459
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:58,482
Then you'd be stuck
in Flint, Michigan for no reason.

460
00:19:58,582 --> 00:19:59,546
You know what?

461
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:01,316
You said you wanted to leave basketball
at the top of your game.

462
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,753
When are you gonna quit?

463
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:06,780
I'm at the top of my game.
I'm very close to the top.

464
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:14,394
I just got traded for a fuckin' washing
machine. What am I talkin' about?

465
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:16,991
Good night, Ed.

466
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:21,835
Thanks for the pep talk.

467
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:31,013
Ed Monix is a tenacious defender,
and he can hit the big shots.

468
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:34,350
- When he's not drunk.
- Which is never.

469
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,984
Look, there's nothing in the rulebook
that says you can't play drunk.

470
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,388
No, actually, there is.

471
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,420
Remember those 30 rebounds
against San Diego?

472
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,589
Yeah.

473
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:43,459
- I don't remember 'em.
- Oh, no.

474
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,058
- Amaretto stone sours.
- Yes.

475
00:20:45,158 --> 00:20:46,592
- I will never believe that.
- All game long.

476
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,431
- No way.
- I mixed 'em!

477
00:20:48,531 --> 00:20:51,065
- Doesn't leave the table.
- Yeah.

478
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:53,099
Look, guys, you ain't gotta worry.

479
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:56,574
'Cause tomorrow when I get this cast
taken off, I'll be back on the team...

480
00:20:56,674 --> 00:20:59,173
and I will be rainin' down some threes!

481
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:02,877
Cornelius, you're a good friend,
but that arm hasn't properly healed...

482
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:05,912
and I've told you 100 times
you're never gonna play for the Tropics.

483
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:07,216
You're a terrible athlete.

484
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:11,520
Come on, man! I'm a excellent athlete.
Look, I broke this arm playin' for you.

485
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,688
No, you broke it
playing with me in the driveway.

486
00:21:14,788 --> 00:21:15,924
You can't even make a lay-up.

487
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,328
I'm an injured player, man.
I should be on the bench.

488
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:20,196
No, you're not on the team.

489
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:22,633
Well, in my fantasy life,
I'm on the team.

490
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:25,400
Well, let's just keep
it that way, right?

491
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,967
My God. What the fuck is that?
It's incredible.

492
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:29,440
It's called fondue.

493
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,106
- Fon what?
- Fondue.

494
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:36,176
Three different cheeses, melted.
That's what you're tasting.

495
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:38,745
Gorgonzola, muenster and cottage.

496
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:40,752
It's the latest thing
from Sweden, apparently.

497
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:42,220
Well, I'm not surprised by that.

498
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,087
The Swedes are so
inventive, aren't they?

499
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:45,286
- They are.
- Yep.

500
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:48,090
They are my favorite producers
of pornography.

501
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,426
They make an excellent fuck picture.

502
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:54,399
Well, I think I'll excuse myself
from this conversation right now.

503
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:56,334
- To the men's room.
- Stop it!

504
00:21:56,434 --> 00:21:57,532
To make your wiener sing.

505
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,565
Boner machine.

506
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:01,370
I am not a boner machine, now.

507
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,307
Swedish porn saved my life in 'Nam.

508
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:04,904
- OK.
- Great, here we go.

509
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:07,176
- C'mon! Fuck you guys!
- Let me get my violin.

510
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:08,207
Swedish porn was the only thing...

511
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:10,344
that kept my mind off Charlie
when I was in the shit.

512
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:13,649
Is the shit in Ann Arbor? 'Cause
that's where you were during the war.

513
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,019
- He really believes it.
- You were never in 'Nam...

514
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,420
- Nope.
...you jive turkey.

515
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:32,026
You just call me a jive turkey?

516
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:36,304
No. No, he did not.

517
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:40,576
- He called you cocksucker.
- Yeah.

518
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:41,675
- Yeah.
- Right, Cornelius?

519
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:43,546
Yeah, yeah.
I just called you cocksucker.

520
00:22:43,646 --> 00:22:46,146
I'm pretty sure that
you called me a jive turkey.

521
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:50,385
No, no. Now, Lou,
nobody called anyone a JT.

522
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:52,919
Jive turkey is a little over the line,
my man!

523
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,425
Look, we're all here.

524
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:56,725
We all heard what was said
and we're in agreement.

525
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:58,696
- Cornelius said cocksucker.
- Yes.

526
00:22:58,796 --> 00:22:59,725
- Right?
- Yeah.

527
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:03,397
- He just said you suck cock.
- That's all he said about you.

528
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:07,598
Now, come on. Dig into that fondue,
you little cocksucker.

529
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:11,098
- We like playing games, don't we?
- We do, we're playing one right now!

530
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:15,310
I'm gonna show you guys
this game that I learned...

531
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,945
- when I was in fucking 'Nam!
- No, no, no, no!

532
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:19,383
Lou. Lou.

533
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,611
Who's the jive turkey now?

534
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:29,391
Gun's not loaded!

535
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,795
- You son of a bitch!
- It's not loaded!

536
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:32,893
It's not loaded!

537
00:23:32,993 --> 00:23:36,063
You shoulda seen your goddamn face!

538
00:23:36,163 --> 00:23:38,665
There's no bullets in there!
I never load it!

539
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:41,432
The gun was not loaded.

540
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,474
I'll see you fuckers in hell!

541
00:23:48,913 --> 00:23:52,144
<i>Jackie, Love Me Sexy</i>
is the worst song I've ever heard.

542
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:58,245
Watch this! I did call you jive turkey.

543
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:01,722
He did!

544
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:06,628
I got one. Hey, Lou, I know
you slept with Mrs. Pepperfield!

545
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:11,268
We're saying nutty things
'cause they're not true.

546
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:14,171
- My! Yeah.
- Especially that. More than the rest.

547
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:16,905
- He's jonesing you.
- It never happened.

548
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:18,876
- Hey. Bond.
- She's not ugly.

549
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:21,278
- James Bond.
- There it is.

550
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:24,713
- How do you like your martini, sir?
- Stirred, in a half-carafe.

551
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:30,180
- He shoots himself.
- He shoots himself in the wiener.

552
00:24:39,397 --> 00:24:41,332
- Everybody OK?
- I think so.

553
00:24:41,432 --> 00:24:43,993
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.

554
00:24:45,303 --> 00:24:48,368
We just literally dodged a bullet.

555
00:24:48,468 --> 00:24:50,971
We sure did!

556
00:24:51,071 --> 00:24:52,703
- We certainly...
- Except for Cornelius.

557
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:57,847
I did get shot!

558
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:01,976
- My God.
- Wow!

559
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:05,786
# Mr. Big Stuff #

560
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:07,488
# Who do you think you are? #

561
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:10,556
# Mr. Big Stuff #

562
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,795
# You're never gonna get my love #

563
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:15,198
# Now because you wear #

564
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:16,999
Vakidis, open the window, will ya?

565
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,365
Yes, right on.

566
00:25:20,505 --> 00:25:22,339
Did you give Bobby Dee a hand job?

567
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,139
Yes, right on.

568
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:25,873
Hey, Monix...

569
00:25:25,973 --> 00:25:27,845
what were the Celtics like?

570
00:25:27,945 --> 00:25:29,577
Well, they were fast.

571
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:33,050
Fast? Man. Clarence should play
for the Celtics, then. That boy can fly.

572
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,850
Downtown,
that's all he ever talk about.

573
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,916
"I'm goin' to the NBA, I'm goin'
to the NBA." Every day he say that.

574
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:39,519
No, I don't.
Why don't you just shut up, man?

575
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:43,359
Say, Monix, why don't you let us
see that championship ring, man?

576
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,392
Don't think nobody here
ever seen a championship ring before.

577
00:25:46,492 --> 00:25:47,595
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

578
00:25:47,695 --> 00:25:49,330
- Yes!
- Yo, man, let me see it!

579
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,768
Holy balls.

580
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:54,671
My God, look at this right here.
"Champion" in sparkling gold.

581
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:56,472
Man, why are you wearing that
on your neck?

582
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:58,774
If I had a ring like that,
I'd have it on my finger every day...

583
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:00,840
so the honeys could see it.

584
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,577
I'm not quite as flashy as you.

585
00:26:02,677 --> 00:26:05,212
I just like wearing it
around my neck, that's all.

586
00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:06,914
- That's cool, man.
- I hear that.

587
00:26:07,014 --> 00:26:09,418
He should be embarrassed.

588
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:12,920
Embarrassed?

589
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,926
He sat through every playoff game.

590
00:26:16,026 --> 00:26:18,761
Then he gonna walk around us
with all the shine...

591
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:20,861
like he some kind of hero or somethin'.

592
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:23,300
Come on, Clarence.
You're just actin' jealous.

593
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:30,207
Whatever. I ain't never rode the bench
and then go call myself a champion.

594
00:26:30,307 --> 00:26:33,975
Somebody need to snatch that ring
off his sorry neck.

595
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:35,508
- You wanna snatch it? Come on.
- L...

596
00:26:35,608 --> 00:26:37,712
- Be my guest.
- I don't think your knees can take it.

597
00:26:37,812 --> 00:26:41,479
Hey! Hey, I got a ring up here too.
Mine says love.

598
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:45,178
Think about that.

599
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,427
Everybody love everybody!

600
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,862
Come on!

601
00:26:51,962 --> 00:26:54,363
Eleven more hours to go.

602
00:27:00,671 --> 00:27:04,507
This way, this way.
Let's go, Tropics. Keep it alive.

603
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:07,174
Keep it alive, right here!
Throw it in the blender.

604
00:27:07,274 --> 00:27:08,578
No! Changed my mind.
Right back, though.

605
00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:10,379
- OK. OK.
- Right back to you. Give it back again!

606
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,815
- You got it.
- No, right back.

607
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:13,649
- No?
- Yeah. Yeah.

608
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:15,951
- Sure?
- Yeah. Right back. Come on, now. No.

609
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,786
Right back, reset.
Throw it to Papa.

610
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,851
- No, right back out.
- All right.

611
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:20,419
- Right back. Right back.
- Here you go, Jackie.

612
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,723
- Back to you. Right back, though.
- You're right. OK.

613
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:22,755
Shoot!

614
00:27:22,855 --> 00:27:23,958
- All right, right on.
- Clear. Yeah.

615
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:25,429
- You ready?
- No, right back.

616
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:26,931
- No?
- Yeah. OK, clear.

617
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:27,960
- All right, I'm goin'.
- My turn.

618
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,333
Yeah, I'll bet my alleged son
he won't make this.

619
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:32,567
Jackie Moon finally making a move...

620
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:36,473
- and it is worth the wait!
- All day long!

621
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:38,572
- Traveling!
- No, no, no, no! One and a half steps!

622
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:43,580
- Come on, Jackie. You walked.
- Suck my cock! I'll murder your family!

623
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:46,015
- You're gone, Jackie Moon!
- What? What?

624
00:27:46,115 --> 00:27:48,547
Jackie Moon is ejected from the game.

625
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:50,814
- What did I say?
- You said, "S my C."

626
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:56,456
And one lucky fan
will go home with a game ball.

627
00:27:56,556 --> 00:27:57,658
That's your head next time.

628
00:27:57,758 --> 00:27:59,028
You're a big baby, Jackie.
You cannot tell me to S my C.

629
00:27:59,128 --> 00:28:01,161
Jackie Moon and the referee
really going at it here.

630
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:03,134
- I didn't say anything.
- You said, "S my C."

631
00:28:03,234 --> 00:28:05,333
- I barely raised my voice.
- I should call your mother.

632
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,670
You need a phone to heaven to do that.

633
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,702
- Maybe your ma didn't go to heaven.
- Oh, dear.

634
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:12,402
Oh, my. Oh, no.

635
00:28:13,311 --> 00:28:15,308
OK. Everyone off the floor.
Let's go. Tropics, let's go.

636
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:16,544
Why... No, Jackie.

637
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:20,180
It appears a line has been crossed
by Father Pat of all people.

638
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,518
- Look, Jackie, I'm sorry.
- Stop the broadcast.

639
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:26,356
Jackie Moon is pulling his team
off the court.

640
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,455
You forfeit this game, Jackie,
if you keep walking.

641
00:28:28,555 --> 00:28:32,160
- That's fine.
- You threatened to kill my family!

642
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,165
God damn it, Pat.
What the hell's wrong with you?

643
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:38,164
Don't get on your high horse, Redwood.
Thank you, Dick, for staying.

644
00:28:38,264 --> 00:28:42,038
And that will do it from St. Louis,
where the score is inconclusive.

645
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,373
Good night.

646
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,040
- Dick.
- That's it.

647
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,606
We go to church together.

648
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:49,411
Not anymore.

649
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:53,384
# Hey, Flint Tropics, welcome back,
give the Amigos a heart attack #

650
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:54,615
I tried, Jackie.

651
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:56,716
They won't take it.

652
00:28:56,816 --> 00:28:58,486
Look, I don't know
what your bank is telling you.

653
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:01,222
This is a real check.
I signed it myself.

654
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,525
It's written in glitter, man.

655
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:07,661
Can't you just, you know, like,
write me a regular-size check?

656
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:10,634
Maybe you should try a different bank.
A big bank.

657
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:12,901
- Bigger bank?
- That has a big check department.

658
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,534
- That's what I'd do.
- OK.

659
00:29:14,634 --> 00:29:16,237
- Right? All right.
- Yeah.

660
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,574
Scootsie, he is takin' you to town!

661
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,736
Get him, Twig. C'mon!

662
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,742
There we go.

663
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:25,879
- All right, guys. Hey, listen up.
- Hey, hey.

664
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:29,977
Let's go. Eyes up here.
Turn that contraption off. Come on.

665
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:33,254
Look, just got off the phone
with the Commissioner.

666
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,091
He convinced the board
to pass another merger rule.

667
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:40,761
We gotta average 2,000 fans per
home game for the rest of the season.

668
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:42,463
- Two thou every home game?
- Damn. What?

669
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:45,700
Commissioner says they're not gonna
take a franchise that doesn't have fans.

670
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,504
- He's being a real dick.
- Good Lord, Jackie Moon.

671
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:54,276
Winning these games is gonna be hard,
but 2,000 fans? Lmpossible, man.

672
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,410
It's OK, Scootsie.
'Cause I got a plan. All right?

673
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,384
Now, you all know
we're the ABA game of the week, right?

674
00:30:00,484 --> 00:30:04,085
Could be a lot of television cameras
out there, so we just gotta be tiptop.

675
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:05,921
So, what's the plan?

676
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:07,323
I brought a secret weapon.

677
00:30:07,423 --> 00:30:09,591
It's gonna make us
look extra cool on TV.

678
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,292
What the hell is that?

679
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,592
It's eyeliner, dummy.

680
00:30:14,332 --> 00:30:16,129
Now who's first? Monix?

681
00:30:17,034 --> 00:30:21,471
Yeah. Just let me get a fresh Maxi Pad
out of my purse.

682
00:30:22,907 --> 00:30:24,953
Looks like Jackie Moon has brought a...

683
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:27,207
trick from Broadway
to the court tonight.

684
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:30,613
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap.

685
00:30:30,713 --> 00:30:31,846
Point of no return.
Go back. Go back.

686
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:33,784
Horse in the trailer.
Nowhere to go.

687
00:30:33,884 --> 00:30:35,949
Hey. Look at my eyes.
No, look at my eyes.

688
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:38,552
Are you scared? Tropical storm.
Eye of the hurricane.

689
00:30:38,652 --> 00:30:39,588
I'm gonna hypnotize you.

690
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:41,323
I'm not gonna blink.
I'm not gonna blink.

691
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,025
- Look at me.
- Where you goin'? Where you goin'?

692
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:47,194
Jackie tips the ball away.
Twiggy picks it up and takes it in.

693
00:30:47,294 --> 00:30:50,066
- Two points, Tropics.
- Way to go, Twiggy!

694
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,968
Make sure the camera gets your eyes!

695
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:54,369
- This team is on fire
early in the game.

696
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:55,968
They're flamin', all right.

697
00:30:56,068 --> 00:30:58,909
Nice lay-up.
Nice lay-up, Twiggy.

698
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:02,434
- Who's got character now?
- My confidence is sky-high right now.

699
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,779
What's with Vakidis?

700
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:09,250
What the hell's wrong with Vakidis?

701
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,222
Shit! Your eyeliner's running.

702
00:31:12,322 --> 00:31:14,556
Yeah. Yours is kinda smoky too.

703
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:15,891
All right, everyone.
Try not to sweat if you can.

704
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:17,957
Hell, no. This shit
burnin' already, man.

705
00:31:18,057 --> 00:31:20,060
- Yeah, it kinda is.
- Goddamn.

706
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,194
I'm going to the bench, man. Move!

707
00:31:21,294 --> 00:31:22,261
- What's happening?
- Shit!

708
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:24,397
The Tropics seem to be
disabled in some way.

709
00:31:24,497 --> 00:31:26,600
God, it burns.

710
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,770
Do they test this on animals
or is that just a lie?

711
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,837
Feels like I got cat piss in my eyes!

712
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:33,906
Just open your eyes with your fingers,
guys. It's really nice.

713
00:31:34,006 --> 00:31:35,508
Cock sandwich, that hurts!

714
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:36,845
- Fuckin' idiots.
- That feels really good.

715
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:39,446
Monix, where's your makeup, buddy?

716
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:42,819
Hey, how come it says Monix on
your jersey when your name's Pussy?

717
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:44,788
- I was curious about this...
- Fuck you, Petrelli.

718
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:47,055
- Hey, hey, Monix!
- Get your hands off me!

719
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,190
- Get back here! You little bitch!
- We're on TV!

720
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,860
- I don't give a shit!
- Commissioner's watching.

721
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,962
- You wanna kill the merger? C'mon.
- Everybody relax.

722
00:31:56,062 --> 00:31:58,835
Looks like a little gentleman's
disagreement on the court. Nothing big.

723
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:00,337
No, these girls aren't gonna fight.

724
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:03,239
No, but a little bit of a delay
in play for a moment here.

725
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,940
What about during commercial?

726
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,777
Yeah, I like it. Yeah, it's good.

727
00:32:08,877 --> 00:32:12,249
- Father Pat, timeout.
- Timeout, white!

728
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,415
It's a timeout on the
floor, with 9 minutes...

729
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,983
and 16 seconds left in the first.

730
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:17,651
The Tropics two, the Amigos six.

731
00:32:17,751 --> 00:32:21,125
And we'll be right back
after these messages from Shasta.

732
00:32:21,225 --> 00:32:22,722
And, clear.

733
00:32:22,822 --> 00:32:24,260
Somebody hit somebody!

734
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:29,389
Here we go.

735
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:33,333
- Come on!
- Get him!

736
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:37,505
This is a good old-fashioned
bare-fisted brawl here on the court.

737
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:39,634
My goodness.

738
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:44,075
Look at the Russian bear go.
Throwing people around like rag dolls.

739
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:48,817
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends? #

740
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,468
Look at Monix take it
to Petrelli. I wish...

741
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,755
the people at home could see this.

742
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:52,784
I could hurt someone.

743
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:56,890
New Red Apple Soda with a great taste
and tingle they're still looking for.

744
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,396
# Why can't we be friends? #

745
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:01,427
# Why can't we be friends? #

746
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:04,334
- # Why can't we be friends? #
- Get him! Get him!

747
00:33:04,434 --> 00:33:06,966
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends? #

748
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:08,857
Honestly, Dick, I could
watch this all day.

749
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:10,406
This is terr... Look at Father Pat!

750
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:12,708
Father Pat is getting
the worst of a lot of this.

751
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:14,211
Stop!

752
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:16,146
- # Why can't we be friends? #
- And we're back in three...

753
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:18,875
- # Why can't we be friends? #
...two, one...

754
00:33:19,884 --> 00:33:22,483
Welcome back
to your ABA game of the week.

755
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,516
I'll tell you, the spirit
and camaraderie of this league...

756
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:26,653
is on full display here tonight, Lou.

757
00:33:26,753 --> 00:33:29,626
Yeah, yeah, you got that right, Dick.

758
00:33:29,726 --> 00:33:30,655
Lou!

759
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:34,631
Come on, Jack! They won't come back
in here no more!

760
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:36,729
- Then I just kicked him!
- Man.

761
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:40,001
- Still got it, J.
- Now, that is how you play basketball.

762
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,568
- That's right.
- You hear those fans? They loved it!

763
00:33:42,668 --> 00:33:43,872
- Man!
- Right on.

764
00:33:43,972 --> 00:33:46,107
Monix, you got Petrelli's ass!

765
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:47,539
I mean, I was out there grabbin' balls.

766
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,113
I think I grabbed some
of your guys' balls.

767
00:33:49,213 --> 00:33:50,142
Damn!

768
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:52,312
- That was you on my nuts?
- Yeah.

769
00:33:52,412 --> 00:33:54,447
You got the softest hands in the world.

770
00:33:54,547 --> 00:33:58,484
All right, this is what we do.
Tae kwon do sessions every practice.

771
00:33:58,584 --> 00:34:00,823
In fact, we don't need...

772
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:04,356
Does anybody here wanna talk
about the fucking game?

773
00:34:04,456 --> 00:34:05,762
God, this guy's a bummer.

774
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:08,462
Did anyone look at the scoreboard?

775
00:34:08,562 --> 00:34:11,165
How about we run some plays
in the second half, Jackie?

776
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:14,734
Look, Monix, I'm not an X's and O's guy,
right? I'm not a tactician.

777
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:17,640
I'm a motivator
in the classic sense of the word.

778
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,308
You know, Lombardi,
Charles Lindbergh...

779
00:34:21,408 --> 00:34:24,444
that nun over in India,
like those people.

780
00:34:24,544 --> 00:34:27,614
I get people to do great things!

781
00:34:27,714 --> 00:34:31,954
And we just had an incredible,
team-unifying moment...

782
00:34:32,054 --> 00:34:34,621
by punching other guys in the face.

783
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:35,654
And it felt good...

784
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:38,893
and now we're gonna continue that
on the court in the second half...

785
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,425
with baskets, though.

786
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:43,265
We need a game plan, Jackie.

787
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:46,332
So he the expert. He should know.

788
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:47,866
He done seen the game
from every angle...

789
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:49,170
- sittin' on the bench.
- Damn!

790
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,253
Hey, guess what? The Celtics weren't...

791
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:53,441
just all-stars, they
were a team. A team!

792
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,518
As opposed to a bunch of selfish...

793
00:34:55,618 --> 00:34:57,943
assholes tryin' to
look cool every night.

794
00:34:58,043 --> 00:34:59,647
I mean, call us what you want to...

795
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:03,249
but we ain't never sat around
and pretended like we some champions.

796
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:09,987
Yeah, you got a little ring and all,
but you personally, you ain't won shit.

797
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,265
Clarence, I want you
to have this ring...

798
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:19,669
as a token
of what you will never achieve.

799
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:22,735
Champion or not,
at least I played the game.

800
00:35:22,835 --> 00:35:24,606
And I got news for you, Clarence...

801
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:28,545
for all your flash,
you are never gonna play in the NBA.

802
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:31,644
You are pissing your career away.

803
00:35:31,744 --> 00:35:34,348
And one day,
you're gonna look back on your life...

804
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:39,412
and you're gonna realize that you never
even learned how to play basketball.

805
00:36:01,178 --> 00:36:02,376
Jeez!

806
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:04,437
What the hell?

807
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:07,615
Shit.

808
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:09,676
Get your hands in the air.

809
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,159
Monix, bail's been set.

810
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,232
Lynn, can I ask you a favor?

811
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:28,205
You mean besides
bailing your ass outta jail?

812
00:36:28,305 --> 00:36:30,069
Lynn, no one can drain it like you.

813
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:34,539
I think I drained all
I can out of there.

814
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,743
- That hurt?
- Not really.

815
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:39,148
- How about that?
- Yeah.

816
00:36:39,248 --> 00:36:40,615
Good.

817
00:36:42,586 --> 00:36:47,216
Listen. This is long overdue,
but I wanna apologize.

818
00:36:48,525 --> 00:36:50,427
For what?

819
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:55,798
For, you know, back then
we had some problems.

820
00:36:55,898 --> 00:36:59,597
Did you wanna apologize
for cheating on me?

821
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,970
Twice.

822
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,603
Hey, I cheated on you once.

823
00:37:03,703 --> 00:37:07,077
There just happened
to be two girls there.

824
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:10,341
- Still not funny?
- Still not funny.

825
00:37:11,715 --> 00:37:13,706
And where's the necklace I made you?

826
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,088
Monix, it was the high point
of your career.

827
00:37:19,188 --> 00:37:20,686
I didn't deserve that ring, Lynn.

828
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:24,594
I hardly played.
I was never the guy to hit the big shot.

829
00:37:24,694 --> 00:37:27,361
Wanna know why
things didn't work out between us?

830
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:28,393
Yeah.

831
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:32,925
You hate yourself so much
it's impossible to love you.

832
00:37:34,938 --> 00:37:37,031
Kinda brutally honest.

833
00:37:40,077 --> 00:37:42,445
Did we have some fun?

834
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:43,813
You're kind of fun.

835
00:37:43,913 --> 00:37:46,614
Didn't we?

836
00:37:46,714 --> 00:37:49,083
Sometimes.

837
00:37:56,427 --> 00:37:59,796
- What are you doing?
- There he is.

838
00:37:59,896 --> 00:38:03,232
- Been lookin' all over for you.
- Like it. Sweaty.

839
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:06,000
See ya later, Ed.'Scuse me, guys.

840
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,370
Excused.

841
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,807
Doin' your girl in the locker room?
Classy.

842
00:38:10,907 --> 00:38:14,833
- What are you guys doin' here?
- We want you to coach the team.

843
00:38:16,447 --> 00:38:18,680
- What?
- You know the game better than Jackie.

844
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,816
I'm flattered, but I don't think
Jackie would be too happy about this.

845
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:26,419
Come on, don't worry about Jackie.
I mean, I got this.

846
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:28,321
OK, Tropics, hustle up.

847
00:38:29,526 --> 00:38:31,557
Five, six, seven, eight.

848
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:35,627
One and two and three and four,
and turn like you mean it.

849
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:36,965
Arch that back, Bee Bee.

850
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,402
I like it. Good rotation.

851
00:38:39,502 --> 00:38:40,668
Beautiful, seahorses.

852
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:42,003
Leg kick, Scootsie.

853
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:44,973
Nice! And freeze it.

854
00:38:49,546 --> 00:38:50,812
And then we start the game.

855
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:51,843
Now, when I say freeze it...

856
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:54,475
you guys gotta freeze it, OK?

857
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:57,452
- Hey!
- Hey.

858
00:38:57,552 --> 00:38:59,051
You're back. All right.

859
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:02,188
We got a extra costume
right over there for you.

860
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:06,961
I'm not here to do whatever this is.
What is this?

861
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:12,801
What is this? Come on, man,
this is the future of basketball, OK?

862
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:16,465
This is entertainment.
You'll get it. You'll catch on.

863
00:39:21,044 --> 00:39:24,813
Look, Jackie. Now, don't get mad,
but some of us got together...

864
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,413
and we aksed old Monix
if he'd teach us a little bit.

865
00:39:27,513 --> 00:39:29,549
Wait, what do you mean, teach us?

866
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:34,356
I teach you guys things.
Like expert choreography and stuff.

867
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,455
No.

868
00:39:36,555 --> 00:39:40,224
We wanna give Monix
a chance to coach, Coach.

869
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:44,226
What's goin' on here?

870
00:39:45,235 --> 00:39:46,896
What is this?

871
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:50,237
Clarence?

872
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:55,371
This is a mutiny.

873
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:59,015
You guys all in on this?

874
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:05,784
You motherfuckin' cocksuckers.

875
00:40:05,884 --> 00:40:07,983
All of you.

876
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:13,162
I have dedicated my life
to this team, OK?

877
00:40:13,262 --> 00:40:15,596
I have given you guys my soul!

878
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:20,536
I mean, who bought you
those boots last Halloween?

879
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:23,039
That would be you, Coach.
You bought us those boots.

880
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:24,068
I bought 'em!

881
00:40:24,168 --> 00:40:25,772
I really liked them boots.
They were nice.

882
00:40:25,872 --> 00:40:27,974
They're really nice boots.

883
00:40:28,074 --> 00:40:29,609
Yeah, we love ya.

884
00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:33,814
But Monix just knows
the X's and O's, baby. That's all.

885
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:36,753
Come on, come on,
don't turn your back on us.

886
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:39,448
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Listen.

887
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:45,160
How about this, I'll be the offensive
and defensive coordinator...

888
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,323
and you can still be head coach.

889
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:52,932
And you're the best promoter.
We gonna need fans, right?

890
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:55,803
Do you guys really think
I'm a good promoter?

891
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:58,741
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know you are, man.

892
00:40:58,841 --> 00:41:01,773
- I'm probably the best in the league.
- Yeah, that's what they say.

893
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:03,179
- Top three.
- Yup.

894
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:05,080
- Right up there.
- Yeah.

895
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,911
OK.

896
00:41:09,786 --> 00:41:14,985
If we play unselfish, fundamental
basketball, we can make a run at this.

897
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:20,861
By unselfish, I mean we sprint up
the court on every fast break...

898
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:24,598
not because we might get a dunk and
get your dick sucked after the game...

899
00:41:24,698 --> 00:41:28,003
but because sprinting might pull
the defense out of position...

900
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:29,512
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So what's goin' on...

901
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,372
with the blow jobs again?

902
00:41:30,472 --> 00:41:32,640
Yeah, 'cause I vote
we keep them blow jobs, Jack.

903
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,545
- Yeah. All in favor?
- Come on, let the man talk.

904
00:41:36,645 --> 00:41:38,278
Thank you, Clarence.

905
00:41:38,378 --> 00:41:41,545
Now, till we start playing
like a real team...

906
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,189
we're gonna practice without the ball.

907
00:41:47,457 --> 00:41:49,691
That's a waste.

908
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:52,228
OK, let's run the offense!

909
00:41:53,664 --> 00:41:56,431
- Without a ball?
- Yeah, without the ball, Clarence.

910
00:41:56,531 --> 00:41:58,767
Let's go, everybody get in position.

911
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:02,739
- Patch that ball up, Scootsie.
- Come on! Hustle!

912
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:04,803
OK, Clarence, flash through the lane.

913
00:42:04,903 --> 00:42:07,541
- Hustle, Clarence!
- Come on, come on.

914
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:08,573
Ball, ball, ball!

915
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:11,278
We been runnin'
the same play all day.

916
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:13,412
Yeah, can we maybe try
play number two?

917
00:42:13,512 --> 00:42:16,684
No! I want you to be brain-dead,
gentlemen!

918
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:20,752
'Cause someday you're gonna be
too tired or too nervous to think.

919
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:24,193
And when you are,
this is the play that I'm gonna call.

920
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:26,927
We need to be able to run
this play in our sleep.

921
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:29,528
I'm a rover, Coach.
I'm just gonna go rover.

922
00:42:29,628 --> 00:42:32,164
No, don't just go rovin'.
Run the play, Jackie Moon.

923
00:42:32,264 --> 00:42:33,765
I'm creatin' a diversion, though...

924
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:36,537
- by runnin' in circles over here.
- Don't lose your mind, Jackie Moon.

925
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,541
We are runnin' this until we puke.

926
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:41,573
- Well, basically, we have.
- Yeah, I'm pretty beat, Coach.

927
00:42:41,673 --> 00:42:43,912
"Until we puke"
is not a figure of speech.

928
00:42:44,012 --> 00:42:45,882
We are literally going to puke.

929
00:42:45,982 --> 00:42:47,644
What does he mean by "literally"?

930
00:42:51,788 --> 00:42:54,123
I wish you were still
a washing machine!

931
00:42:54,223 --> 00:42:57,757
Get up and run, Coach!
You're gonna puke like everybody else!

932
00:42:57,857 --> 00:43:02,063
I can't puke, Monix!
I've never puked in my life, ever!

933
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,330
You're lying to me.

934
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:07,067
I've been sick before, I've just never
puked. Swear on my mother's grave.

935
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,737
What about when you were a baby?
Babies throw up all the time.

936
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:14,368
My mom said I never did it. I swear.

937
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:17,480
She said I was fascinating.

938
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,916
In fact, the local PBS wanted to do
a documentary on me.

939
00:43:23,754 --> 00:43:25,486
Have you ever been punched
in the jejunum?

940
00:43:25,586 --> 00:43:27,423
No, what's a jejunum?

941
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,656
It's part of the small intestine.

942
00:43:29,756 --> 00:43:31,391
I don't think so.

943
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:35,864
I mean, I've been punched in the armpit
before, and in the wrist twice.

944
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:40,626
Coccyx, and in the back of the knee.

945
00:43:41,171 --> 00:43:44,766
Both eyes, and I've been punched
right in my tracheal...

946
00:44:03,627 --> 00:44:05,959
Let that out.

947
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:09,395
Go ahead, Jackie. Just let it go.

948
00:44:12,169 --> 00:44:13,568
Hey, hey, hey.

949
00:44:16,907 --> 00:44:19,539
Get ahold of yourself, Jackie!

950
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:23,378
Let go! Hold it in, Jackie!
Hold it in!

951
00:44:23,478 --> 00:44:25,444
Get off me, God damn it!

952
00:44:25,544 --> 00:44:26,880
Jackie!

953
00:44:33,323 --> 00:44:36,389
We are seeing a very different Tropics
basketball team than we're used to...

954
00:44:36,489 --> 00:44:37,692
aren't we, Lou?

955
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:40,062
Playing with a lot of energy
and a lot of confidence.

956
00:44:40,162 --> 00:44:41,193
They're movin' the ball well.

957
00:44:41,293 --> 00:44:42,994
It looks like they're
gonna win this game.

958
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:44,461
The only question is, by how much?

959
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:47,234
Jangel has the ball now.

960
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:49,706
My gosh, a loose ball on the court
and Clarence dives for it?

961
00:44:49,806 --> 00:44:50,735
Timeout!

962
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:52,573
That's something we have not seen
before. And a timeout is called.

963
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:53,976
Timeout, white!

964
00:44:54,076 --> 00:44:56,446
- Hey. Good playin' out there, Jackie.
- Thanks.

965
00:44:56,546 --> 00:44:58,948
- Way to go, man.
- Yeah.

966
00:44:59,048 --> 00:45:01,513
The crowd is really excited tonight.

967
00:45:01,613 --> 00:45:02,851
They know what's at stake, Dick.

968
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:06,255
Yup, gettin' their home team
into the NBA.

969
00:45:06,355 --> 00:45:07,690
No, I'm talking about free corn dogs.

970
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:10,255
That's right.
It's free corn dog night.

971
00:45:10,355 --> 00:45:11,790
Fellas, it's lookin' great.

972
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:13,594
We're 30 seconds away
from takin' this thing.

973
00:45:13,694 --> 00:45:17,899
Yeah, he's right. Let's try to win,
but not win by too much.

974
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:20,735
Wait, we don't want to win by too much?

975
00:45:20,835 --> 00:45:22,002
What the hell are you talkin' about?

976
00:45:22,102 --> 00:45:24,272
- Corn dogs.
- What?

977
00:45:24,372 --> 00:45:25,871
See, if we score 125 points...

978
00:45:25,971 --> 00:45:28,406
that mean we gotta give everybody
in here a free corn dog, all right?

979
00:45:28,506 --> 00:45:30,678
Yeah, sorry, Monix.
We don't even got corn dogs.

980
00:45:30,778 --> 00:45:33,115
Corn... I don't care,
we're takin' it to 'em, all right?

981
00:45:33,215 --> 00:45:35,084
Hey, we're up by seven, OK?

982
00:45:35,184 --> 00:45:37,851
Can't we just take it easy?
Run the clock out?

983
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:39,288
We're talkin' a lot of corn dogs!

984
00:45:39,388 --> 00:45:40,920
I don't give a shit
about the corn dogs, all right?

985
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:45,058
We play hard every second. We run
the offense. Everybody got that?

986
00:45:45,158 --> 00:45:46,760
- Right on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

987
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,232
You got that, Jackie?

988
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:52,066
- OK, bring us together, man.
- One, two, three.

989
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,801
Let's get Tropical!

990
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:59,073
OK, it looks like we are going
to return to the game. Monix...

991
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,307
- Hey, Monix.
...has the ball.

992
00:46:00,407 --> 00:46:01,415
You wanna just throw it to me? I can...

993
00:46:01,515 --> 00:46:02,577
get it to Clarence.
That might be easier.

994
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,013
Jackie, move!

995
00:46:04,113 --> 00:46:06,482
Ball, ball, ball, ball,
ball, ball, ball! Ball!

996
00:46:06,582 --> 00:46:09,149
- Nice, Monix!
- Monix inbounds to Clarence.

997
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:11,053
OK. Come on, Clarence,
take your time.

998
00:46:11,153 --> 00:46:12,850
Come on, Nets, play some defense.

999
00:46:13,957 --> 00:46:15,825
You wanna go for the double team?
Might be a good time.

1000
00:46:15,925 --> 00:46:17,591
Double team, double team.

1001
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,725
I won't do anything
if I get the ball, I promise.

1002
00:46:19,825 --> 00:46:23,261
He'll go with his right. He loves
his right one. He likes the right hand.

1003
00:46:23,361 --> 00:46:24,767
- What are you doin'?
- Clarence drives.

1004
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:26,966
Dishes off to Scootsie.

1005
00:46:27,066 --> 00:46:30,305
But look at this, Jackie Moon
blocks his own teammate's shot!

1006
00:46:30,405 --> 00:46:32,404
A loose ball on the court,
Vakidis gets it.

1007
00:46:32,504 --> 00:46:35,638
No!

1008
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:56,629
God damn it, Vakidis!

1009
00:46:56,729 --> 00:46:58,395
Learn fuckin' English!

1010
00:47:00,203 --> 00:47:04,438
Corn dogs, Jackie!
Corn dogs for all these people.

1011
00:47:04,538 --> 00:47:08,912
The Tropics win,
and this crowd is going crazy.

1012
00:47:09,012 --> 00:47:11,144
Crazy for corn dogs.

1013
00:47:11,244 --> 00:47:16,119
And Jackie Moon gives us
a victory lap right out the door!

1014
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:17,317
# Get up and dance to the music! #

1015
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,720
Now, Scootsie, rotate up top.

1016
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:22,124
Vakidis, flash to the high post.

1017
00:47:22,224 --> 00:47:25,691
No, to the high post, Vakidis.
Help him.

1018
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,491
Good.

1019
00:47:32,035 --> 00:47:33,734
- At guard...
- # Dance to the music #

1020
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:35,468
...formerly known as Clarence Withers...

1021
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:38,806
- and "Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone...
- # Dance to the music #

1022
00:47:38,906 --> 00:47:40,473
...and Sugar Dunkerton.

1023
00:47:40,573 --> 00:47:42,411
- # Dance to the music #
- He's tryin' out his new name tonight.

1024
00:47:42,511 --> 00:47:44,543
Put your hands together for...

1025
00:47:44,643 --> 00:47:47,680
- # Dance to the music #
...Coffee Black.

1026
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,416
Coffee Black!

1027
00:47:49,516 --> 00:47:52,152
# Dance to the music #

1028
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:55,923
# You might like to hear
the horns blowin' #

1029
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:59,450
# Cynthia on the throne, yeah! #

1030
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:05,434
Now let's do it again. Jab.

1031
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:07,465
Swing, back.

1032
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:09,236
Good.

1033
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:10,602
That's it.

1034
00:48:18,948 --> 00:48:21,382
# Dance to the music #

1035
00:48:22,585 --> 00:48:25,418
# Dance to the music #

1036
00:48:26,256 --> 00:48:28,315
# Dance to the music #

1037
00:48:30,193 --> 00:48:32,995
Here they come, the Flint Tropics
Ball Girls cheerleading squad,

1038
00:48:33,095 --> 00:48:35,594
keeping the crowd energized
through the timeout.

1039
00:48:35,694 --> 00:48:36,796
They've just got such big...

1040
00:48:36,896 --> 00:48:38,734
- What?
- Hearts.

1041
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:40,433
- Yes.
- Big, bouncy, jiggly hearts.

1042
00:48:40,533 --> 00:48:41,966
Well, hearts don't really bounce...

1043
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:45,030
so now I think you're talking
about something else, Lou.

1044
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,940
- # Say it! Get up! #
- Yeah!

1045
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,179
Downtown brings the ball up forward and
passes to Monix at the top of the key.

1046
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:54,380
Behind his back to Doubleday.

1047
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,885
Scootsie goes for the three-pointer...

1048
00:48:55,985 --> 00:48:57,613
and it is good!

1049
00:48:58,922 --> 00:49:00,452
Are you actually havin' fun out here,
Monix?

1050
00:49:00,552 --> 00:49:02,548
Hey, don't tell anybody.

1051
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:16,463
# Dance to the music #

1052
00:49:17,173 --> 00:49:19,609
# Dance to the music #

1053
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:20,807
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

1054
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:23,368
# Dance to the music #

1055
00:49:41,698 --> 00:49:44,229
Well, if it isn't
the toast of Flint, Michigan.

1056
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:48,236
Shouldn't you be out signing
autographs somewhere or somethin'?

1057
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:55,240
- Will you marry me?
- Shut up.

1058
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,376
I'm crazy about you.
You know that.

1059
00:49:57,476 --> 00:49:58,814
Do I?

1060
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:01,183
You came to one of our games.

1061
00:50:01,283 --> 00:50:04,215
Don't think I didn't see you
hiding in the upper deck.

1062
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:08,753
- So?
- So let's do this, Lynn. You and me.

1063
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:12,459
You know, like back in the day.

1064
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,995
You know? I mean not then, because
I was an asshole. Better, right?

1065
00:50:17,095 --> 00:50:18,931
For real this time.

1066
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:23,768
I need you.

1067
00:50:24,908 --> 00:50:26,972
Yo, Monix!

1068
00:50:27,072 --> 00:50:32,145
What's up, man?
Hey, check out the jersey. I'm you!

1069
00:50:32,245 --> 00:50:34,445
Yeah.

1070
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:38,117
- Hey, Kyle?
- Yeah.

1071
00:50:38,217 --> 00:50:39,920
Can you do me a big favor?

1072
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,987
Can you go get me a tube of Bengay?

1073
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:44,575
Are you kidding me?

1074
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:48,025
I'd be honored, man.
I'll leave right now.

1075
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:49,059
What do you think you're doing?

1076
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:50,229
- Hey, Kyle?
- Yeah!

1077
00:50:50,329 --> 00:50:52,797
Listen, don't... Kyle?

1078
00:50:52,897 --> 00:50:54,635
- Yeah!
- Don't go to the pharmacy.

1079
00:50:54,735 --> 00:50:58,203
I need one of those big tubes like
you get at Luger's out on Route 59.

1080
00:50:58,303 --> 00:51:00,640
I'm already gone, big man!

1081
00:51:05,682 --> 00:51:08,879
Hey, Lynn.
Forgot my stupid wallet.

1082
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,358
That's it.

1083
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,133
Yes.

1084
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:28,432
# Baby, keep on #

1085
00:51:30,273 --> 00:51:32,833
# Come on, baby,
keep on doin' it #

1086
00:51:34,844 --> 00:51:36,141
# Right on #

1087
00:51:37,714 --> 00:51:39,477
# Right on doin' it #

1088
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:42,650
# You got it together #

1089
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,715
# Baby, keep on #

1090
00:51:43,815 --> 00:51:45,817
# Oh, you got it together, baby #

1091
00:51:45,917 --> 00:51:48,054
# Right on #

1092
00:51:48,154 --> 00:51:49,255
# Keep on doin' it #

1093
00:51:49,355 --> 00:51:52,260
# And I'll give you,
baby, all that I get #

1094
00:51:53,663 --> 00:51:55,927
- Kyle.
- # Keep on #

1095
00:51:57,467 --> 00:52:00,336
- Fuck!
- Monix!

1096
00:52:00,436 --> 00:52:01,736
You old dog.

1097
00:52:01,836 --> 00:52:03,638
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Nothin', man.

1098
00:52:03,738 --> 00:52:06,907
I'm just sittin' here watching...
and stuff.

1099
00:52:07,007 --> 00:52:08,276
I'm outta here.

1100
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:11,809
Come on, man, don't be like that.
It's all cool.

1101
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:15,616
No, man. No, believe me, it's not cool.

1102
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,384
I'll call you.

1103
00:52:17,484 --> 00:52:19,114
OK.

1104
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:23,984
He was talkin' to me.

1105
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:25,925
Yes, ladies and gentlemen...

1106
00:52:26,025 --> 00:52:28,594
Jackie Moon has outdone himself
with this promotion...

1107
00:52:28,694 --> 00:52:32,400
as he prepares to jump
over 47 feet of Ball Girls.

1108
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,301
- # Rollercoaster #
- # Say, what? #

1109
00:52:36,339 --> 00:52:38,938
The fact that Jackie's
never been on roller skates before...

1110
00:52:39,038 --> 00:52:40,774
appears to have done nothing
to diminish his confidence.

1111
00:52:40,874 --> 00:52:43,678
- # Rollercoaster #
- All right, folks.

1112
00:52:43,778 --> 00:52:44,978
Here comes...

1113
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,282
- # Rollercoaster #
...Jackie!

1114
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:50,984
Here he comes down the ramp.

1115
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,423
- He is airborne!
- Shit!

1116
00:52:54,523 --> 00:52:57,425
- No!
- Lord!

1117
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:03,756
- Jackie's up!
- # Rollercoaster! #

1118
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:06,369
- Great job!
- # Rollercoaster! #

1119
00:53:06,469 --> 00:53:08,534
And everyone survives!

1120
00:53:08,634 --> 00:53:10,504
That was exciting!

1121
00:53:11,741 --> 00:53:13,907
- # Of love #
- That's an adrenaline rush.

1122
00:53:14,007 --> 00:53:14,939
# Rollercoaster #

1123
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:18,606
Next time I'm gonna jump
even more girls.

1124
00:53:19,649 --> 00:53:23,052
- What?
- The Commissioner just called again.

1125
00:53:23,152 --> 00:53:25,988
- Commish?
- He's drivin' up here on Monday.

1126
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:28,390
- He's comin' to Flint?
- Yes, he's comin' to Flint.

1127
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,949
Shit. Crap.

1128
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:35,827
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1129
00:53:35,927 --> 00:53:39,065
You know, Jackie, we need
2,000 fans in those stands.

1130
00:53:39,165 --> 00:53:41,937
We can't fake it this time.
We gotta do somethin'.

1131
00:53:42,037 --> 00:53:43,535
Look, it's no problem.
I'll take care of it.

1132
00:53:43,635 --> 00:53:45,839
Yeah? We've tried everything.

1133
00:53:45,939 --> 00:53:47,405
Look, I said I'll handle it, OK?

1134
00:53:47,505 --> 00:53:50,109
- I'll think of somethin'.
- All right.

1135
00:53:50,209 --> 00:53:51,878
Back in 30 seconds.

1136
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,682
- How's your wife doin'?
- She's doing just super.

1137
00:53:54,782 --> 00:53:56,017
- She's gorgeous. Yeah.
- Really...

1138
00:53:56,117 --> 00:53:58,251
- Thank you, I think. I mean...
- I'd be...

1139
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:00,785
...hands off.
- I'll try.

1140
00:54:00,885 --> 00:54:02,021
- OK.
- No guarantees.

1141
00:54:02,121 --> 00:54:03,587
Really?

1142
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:05,291
I'd like a guarantee.

1143
00:54:05,391 --> 00:54:06,796
Are we back, Chuck?
We're back.

1144
00:54:06,896 --> 00:54:09,298
OK. Welcome back
to Tropics Weekly.

1145
00:54:09,398 --> 00:54:12,268
I'm joined by owner/player/coach
Jackie Moon.

1146
00:54:12,368 --> 00:54:14,602
Jackie, it is always an honor
when you can drop by.

1147
00:54:14,702 --> 00:54:16,160
Always enjoy our time together,
Dick Pepper.

1148
00:54:17,306 --> 00:54:18,268
Dick Pepperfield, actually.

1149
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:19,303
Now, Jackie...

1150
00:54:19,403 --> 00:54:23,644
amazingly, you're two wins away
from getting your team to the NBA.

1151
00:54:23,744 --> 00:54:27,482
How do you intend to match up
to the Squires' strong inside game?

1152
00:54:27,582 --> 00:54:28,985
It's a great question.

1153
00:54:29,085 --> 00:54:34,115
Tomorrow, after the game,
I, Jackie Moon, will wrestle a bear.

1154
00:54:35,124 --> 00:54:36,890
Well, that's something...

1155
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:39,423
but defensively, as a team,
how do you...

1156
00:54:39,523 --> 00:54:41,430
That's tomorrow night,
one night only...

1157
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:44,062
watch Dewie the Wrestling Bear
attack me...

1158
00:54:44,162 --> 00:54:46,164
and he's killed people in public before.

1159
00:54:46,264 --> 00:54:47,799
Well, OK, that is some entertainment...

1160
00:54:47,899 --> 00:54:50,469
and you are known for
your creative promotions, Jackie, but...

1161
00:54:50,569 --> 00:54:52,138
You're not gonna
want to miss this, folks...

1162
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:54,874
and if you're a small child, you creep
into your mama's bedroom at night...

1163
00:54:54,974 --> 00:54:56,744
and you lift about 40 bucks...

1164
00:54:56,844 --> 00:54:58,045
- outta your mom's purse...
- No, no, no.

1165
00:54:58,145 --> 00:55:01,545
...and you walk down to Flint
Fairgrounds Coliseum, eight o'clock!

1166
00:55:01,645 --> 00:55:04,716
There ya have it. Jackie Moon,
thanks so much for joining us.

1167
00:55:04,816 --> 00:55:07,449
Dewie's insane!
He could rip my head off!

1168
00:55:09,892 --> 00:55:14,263
I'm Dick Pepperfield, reminding you
there will be another night.

1169
00:55:14,363 --> 00:55:16,361
Good night, Flint.

1170
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:19,531
Jackie, are you really
gonna wrestle a bear?

1171
00:55:19,631 --> 00:55:23,236
- Dick, you're the best.
- And we're clear.

1172
00:55:23,336 --> 00:55:25,837
- Let's go get some pussy.
- Gosh, I don't know.

1173
00:55:25,937 --> 00:55:28,507
- Really?
- Yeah.

1174
00:55:28,607 --> 00:55:30,845
- I shouldn't. You know, I shouldn't.
- But you want to.

1175
00:55:30,945 --> 00:55:34,946
Yes, I said I cannot say no to you. We
are gonna get some pussy, aren't we?

1176
00:55:35,046 --> 00:55:36,848
It's gonna be fun.

1177
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:40,650
Come on!

1178
00:55:41,424 --> 00:55:43,255
I'm scared, Clarence.

1179
00:55:44,293 --> 00:55:47,325
It's a baby bear.
It's trained and everything.

1180
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:49,951
I don't care. I'm
terrified of those things.

1181
00:55:50,051 --> 00:55:50,996
I'm freakin' out.

1182
00:55:51,096 --> 00:55:52,530
Come on, get it together.

1183
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,403
I'm startin' to feel really dizzy.

1184
00:55:55,503 --> 00:55:56,737
Break his neck! Come on!

1185
00:55:56,837 --> 00:55:59,006
- Wanna call it off?
- No! No.

1186
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,539
OK.
I gotta give these people a show.

1187
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:03,844
- Are you guys ready?
- Uh-huh.

1188
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,647
- You have to give me your safe word.
- No, I don't need a safe word.

1189
00:56:06,747 --> 00:56:11,176
OK, I'll tell you what, if you feel
like you're in danger, just say...

1190
00:56:12,622 --> 00:56:13,584
spumoni.

1191
00:56:13,684 --> 00:56:16,386
No, I don't need spumoni, OK?
Let's get this show on the road.

1192
00:56:17,059 --> 00:56:18,822
Bobby Dee.

1193
00:56:23,332 --> 00:56:26,893
- Let's go!
- Go... Go... Go ahead, man.

1194
00:56:29,272 --> 00:56:31,604
What are you afraid of?

1195
00:56:32,241 --> 00:56:33,799
Hey.

1196
00:56:35,478 --> 00:56:37,610
We're both wearing red.

1197
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,741
- Sorry, I'm not ignoring
you. I'm just...

1198
00:56:39,841 --> 00:56:40,881
That's stupid, Jackie!

1199
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,447
...trying to deal with him right now.

1200
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:44,853
How long you been
working with the bear?

1201
00:56:44,953 --> 00:56:46,884
Just like a day or so.

1202
00:56:46,984 --> 00:56:48,323
What?

1203
00:56:48,423 --> 00:56:51,192
But I've been working with cats
for like 12 years.

1204
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:54,095
So I'm very familiar with animals.

1205
00:56:54,195 --> 00:56:56,098
Great.

1206
00:56:56,198 --> 00:56:57,826
- C'mon!
- Hey, Dewie.

1207
00:56:58,801 --> 00:57:01,400
Fuck that shit!

1208
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,770
I'm outta here. Spumoni.

1209
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:06,001
No, nope. No, no.
You can't quit now. We just started.

1210
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:09,509
We got to give these people
a show, man.

1211
00:57:09,609 --> 00:57:10,980
- Yeah, you're right.
- That guy's a pussy!

1212
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,505
Test him out.
I'm just gonna be right over here.

1213
00:57:15,484 --> 00:57:17,419
- Do something!
- Come on, Dewie.

1214
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:19,421
You're just nothin' but a dumb bear.

1215
00:57:19,521 --> 00:57:21,820
Smack, smack. Yep.

1216
00:57:24,126 --> 00:57:26,754
Crazy fists. I'm comin'
with crazy fists.

1217
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:31,358
Yeah. This is fine,
he's not doing anything.

1218
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:38,473
Flint, can you dig it?

1219
00:57:38,573 --> 00:57:40,504
Jackie Moon Flint...

1220
00:57:40,604 --> 00:57:42,669
Shit!

1221
00:57:47,683 --> 00:57:50,051
Dewie!

1222
00:57:50,151 --> 00:57:51,149
Spumoni!

1223
00:57:51,249 --> 00:57:53,122
One round. No spumoni!

1224
00:57:53,222 --> 00:57:54,989
Fuck you, Clarence! Spumoni!

1225
00:57:55,089 --> 00:57:56,547
Dewie, no!

1226
00:57:57,627 --> 00:58:00,357
Bobby Dee, help! Shit! Spumoni!

1227
00:58:09,605 --> 00:58:12,704
Watch my hair! Watch my hair!

1228
00:58:12,804 --> 00:58:16,510
The only thing I care about
is my hair! Watch it!

1229
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:19,014
Dewie! My hair!

1230
00:58:19,114 --> 00:58:21,914
Spumoni! Spumoni!

1231
00:58:22,785 --> 00:58:25,783
How many times
do I gotta say spumoni?

1232
00:58:25,883 --> 00:58:28,622
- Somebody's got to do something.
- I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

1233
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:31,223
Don't worry, Jackie!
I'm coming, Jackie.

1234
00:58:31,323 --> 00:58:32,955
I'm comin', Jackie.

1235
00:58:39,001 --> 00:58:41,561
Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights!

1236
00:58:42,772 --> 00:58:44,501
Good.

1237
00:58:45,174 --> 00:58:48,803
Nobody move. Nobody move.

1238
00:58:49,879 --> 00:58:52,978
Where are you, precious?

1239
00:58:53,078 --> 00:58:55,648
Dewie?

1240
00:58:55,748 --> 00:58:58,654
Everyone just remain seated.

1241
00:58:58,754 --> 00:59:00,886
I think he left.

1242
00:59:00,986 --> 00:59:01,945
Dewie?

1243
00:59:05,127 --> 00:59:06,995
Everybody panic!

1244
00:59:07,095 --> 00:59:11,028
My God, there's a bear
loose in the Coliseum!

1245
00:59:11,128 --> 00:59:13,198
There will be no refunds!

1246
00:59:13,298 --> 00:59:16,334
Your refund will be escaping
this deathtrap with your life!

1247
00:59:16,434 --> 00:59:18,937
If you have a small child,
use it as a shield!

1248
00:59:19,037 --> 00:59:20,673
They love the tender meat.

1249
00:59:20,773 --> 00:59:24,201
Cover your sodas, Dewie loves sugar.

1250
00:59:25,715 --> 00:59:29,617
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey, Commish.

1251
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,385
What do ya think?
Packed house, right?

1252
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:35,121
I need to speak with you
and the rest of the team, Jackie.

1253
00:59:35,221 --> 00:59:38,459
OK. Locker room? All right.

1254
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:42,127
This whole merger thing
has been really complicated.

1255
00:59:42,227 --> 00:59:46,658
It's taken a lot of my time
out of my life, away from my family.

1256
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:51,907
Look, even if you beat the Spurs
on Saturday...

1257
00:59:53,342 --> 00:59:56,245
the Tropics won't be going
to the NBA next year.

1258
00:59:56,345 --> 00:59:58,112
Come on, man.

1259
00:59:58,212 --> 00:59:59,744
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

1260
00:59:59,844 --> 01:00:03,584
The expansion committee had
an emergency meeting in Manhattan...

1261
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:08,085
and they decided that Flint
just isn't a big enough media market.

1262
01:00:08,185 --> 01:00:11,358
Well, tough shit!
We done made it this far.

1263
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:12,389
And rules is rules.

1264
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:15,296
Guys, it's over.

1265
01:00:15,396 --> 01:00:17,355
There's nothing I can do.

1266
01:00:19,902 --> 01:00:24,168
Jackie, I'm man enough
to admit when I'm wrong.

1267
01:00:25,174 --> 01:00:28,610
I never thought you'd pull it off.
But you did.

1268
01:00:31,313 --> 01:00:32,871
Good luck.

1269
01:00:33,716 --> 01:00:35,049
Right.

1270
01:00:35,149 --> 01:00:40,020
Jackie, this is the type of deal
you can work around, ain't it?

1271
01:00:41,223 --> 01:00:44,715
Yeah, you Jackie Moon. I mean,
you can just make a phone call, right?

1272
01:00:46,862 --> 01:00:49,831
Sorry, guys. I let you down.

1273
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,864
I'm nothin' but a big phony.

1274
01:00:52,964 --> 01:00:56,200
Man, don't talk like that.
You ain't no phony.

1275
01:00:57,106 --> 01:01:01,173
Yes, I am. You know my song
<i>Love Me Sexy?</i>

1276
01:01:01,273 --> 01:01:02,340
Of course, yeah.

1277
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,145
Yeah, everybody loves that song, man.
It was number one in the country.

1278
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:06,514
I stole it.

1279
01:01:06,614 --> 01:01:08,484
No.

1280
01:01:08,584 --> 01:01:10,419
It's true.

1281
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:14,616
My mom wrote it on a napkin three
weeks before she died, and I stole it.

1282
01:01:15,658 --> 01:01:19,893
That song bought me this franchise
and everything I have in the world...

1283
01:01:19,993 --> 01:01:23,261
but it's all fake.

1284
01:01:24,433 --> 01:01:27,999
Well, look, you can write another
song. I know it's in your bones. Right?

1285
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:31,501
Don't be crazy. I can't write a song
<i>as brilliant as Love Me Sexy.</i>

1286
01:01:31,601 --> 01:01:33,475
You're right.

1287
01:01:33,575 --> 01:01:35,908
I just wish I could puke this all away.

1288
01:01:38,714 --> 01:01:41,046
Monix, can you punch me
in the jejunum?

1289
01:01:42,585 --> 01:01:43,916
Monix?

1290
01:01:45,221 --> 01:01:51,391
# Qu ser, ser #

1291
01:01:51,491 --> 01:01:53,260
In a new merger-policy shift...

1292
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:57,328
it seems the Tropics will not
be playing for an NBA berth after all.

1293
01:01:57,428 --> 01:01:59,863
Saturday's matchup
against the first-place Spurs...

1294
01:01:59,963 --> 01:02:03,102
will be the Tropics'
final basketball game.

1295
01:02:03,202 --> 01:02:05,270
And in an act of great sacrifice...

1296
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:07,973
Jackie Moon has helped
Tropics' superstar, Coffee Black...

1297
01:02:08,073 --> 01:02:09,810
realize his NBA dreams...

1298
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:10,875
by trading him to the Spurs.

1299
01:02:10,975 --> 01:02:15,649
Clarence baby, you made it!
You made it, Clarence, you made it!

1300
01:02:15,749 --> 01:02:18,084
Yes.

1301
01:02:20,155 --> 01:02:23,181
# Qu ser #

1302
01:02:23,526 --> 01:02:25,994
# Qu ser #

1303
01:02:26,328 --> 01:02:28,796
# Girl #

1304
01:02:31,734 --> 01:02:34,294
# Qu ser #

1305
01:02:35,437 --> 01:02:41,005
For Lou Redwood, I'm Dick Pepperfield
reminding you there will be another...

1306
01:02:41,105 --> 01:02:44,739
No, actually we're down
to our last night.

1307
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:47,170
Shit.

1308
01:02:56,058 --> 01:02:57,824
Sup, chief?

1309
01:02:57,924 --> 01:02:59,520
Hey.

1310
01:03:05,601 --> 01:03:07,262
What are you doing here?

1311
01:03:10,072 --> 01:03:11,906
If you ain't heard, I got traded.

1312
01:03:12,006 --> 01:03:13,606
Yeah.

1313
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:16,042
Coffee Black headin' to the NBA.

1314
01:03:17,146 --> 01:03:19,278
Big time.

1315
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:22,515
Yeah, I just wanted to let you know,
man, this year, you coaching us...

1316
01:03:22,615 --> 01:03:23,783
the way you did it,
you really made us feel...

1317
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:26,485
No, no, no, no.

1318
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:27,817
Don't.

1319
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:29,751
OK.

1320
01:03:33,929 --> 01:03:36,426
Let me ask you somethin', Monix.

1321
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:38,096
Yup.

1322
01:03:38,196 --> 01:03:39,828
You already played for the NBA.

1323
01:03:40,736 --> 01:03:43,402
Your knee is gone...

1324
01:03:43,502 --> 01:03:47,005
you couldn't give a damn about the
merger, you were gonna retire anyway.

1325
01:03:47,105 --> 01:03:49,444
What's the question?

1326
01:03:49,544 --> 01:03:52,207
What you playin' for?

1327
01:03:57,052 --> 01:03:59,651
I just wanna sit here
and have a beer in peace.

1328
01:03:59,751 --> 01:04:01,019
Yeah?

1329
01:04:06,595 --> 01:04:07,926
All right.

1330
01:04:10,666 --> 01:04:12,500
I just thought you'd wanna hear that.

1331
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,331
Have a good one.

1332
01:04:27,282 --> 01:04:31,951
# Baby, are you ready
to lick me sexy? #

1333
01:04:32,051 --> 01:04:32,983
Jackie, where you at?

1334
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:36,547
# I'm a big faker
and I stole this song-ly sexy #

1335
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:42,262
# I wanna kill myself-y sexy #

1336
01:04:43,832 --> 01:04:49,367
# I'm gonna get an extension cord
and hang myself sexy #

1337
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:52,305
Buddy. What are you doin'?

1338
01:04:53,876 --> 01:04:57,039
Right now I'm urinating on myself.

1339
01:04:58,947 --> 01:05:02,851
Listen, Jackie, I never thanked you.

1340
01:05:02,951 --> 01:05:06,354
- For what?
- For helpin' me find basketball again.

1341
01:05:10,826 --> 01:05:13,762
Now what is it... Don't eat that.

1342
01:05:13,862 --> 01:05:16,529
- What is that?
- Pancake.

1343
01:05:16,629 --> 01:05:20,198
- Has that been there?
- It's been here a while.

1344
01:05:20,298 --> 01:05:24,268
Listen, Jackie, I think
you should call a team meeting.

1345
01:05:24,368 --> 01:05:25,802
Why?

1346
01:05:25,902 --> 01:05:29,571
'Cause you're still the leader
of the Tropics. Can you do that?

1347
01:05:33,649 --> 01:05:34,638
OK.

1348
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:37,479
You're a good man.

1349
01:05:39,021 --> 01:05:40,388
Should we...

1350
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:43,122
I hate to see this go to waste.
This little bit.

1351
01:05:43,222 --> 01:05:47,219
It won't go to waste.
Save that for the next guy.

1352
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:52,067
If I could have
everyone's attention, please.

1353
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:53,900
Well...

1354
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,738
I just wanted to take one last time
to say thank you to all of you...

1355
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:02,470
for all your hard work
as part of the Flint Tropics.

1356
01:06:04,713 --> 01:06:09,280
My teammates, it was an honor
to be on the court with you.

1357
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:11,376
You guys are the best.

1358
01:06:12,955 --> 01:06:16,516
Even you, Vakidis.
Goddamn dumb son of a bitch.

1359
01:06:17,226 --> 01:06:19,854
You don't understand
a word I'm saying, do you?

1360
01:06:20,763 --> 01:06:23,862
To the Tropic Ball Girls...

1361
01:06:23,962 --> 01:06:25,564
I always thought I was gonna sleep
with a couple of you...

1362
01:06:25,664 --> 01:06:28,228
but that didn't happen.

1363
01:06:30,606 --> 01:06:32,870
That'll teach me to procrastinate.

1364
01:06:34,009 --> 01:06:37,467
Bobby Dee,
you're like a son I never had.

1365
01:06:38,447 --> 01:06:42,548
The son who's exactly
the same age as me.

1366
01:06:42,648 --> 01:06:45,987
Well, kinda... You're like
a half-son, half-friend.

1367
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:48,389
Friend. A son-friend.

1368
01:06:48,489 --> 01:06:51,168
No, don't talk. You'll
just make it worse.

1369
01:06:51,268 --> 01:06:53,622
I don't want to cry and wet my pants.

1370
01:06:56,231 --> 01:07:00,258
I'm not makin'
a whole lot of sense right now.

1371
01:07:02,137 --> 01:07:03,201
- Jackie?
- Yeah?

1372
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:05,871
- Can I say a couple words?
- Please.

1373
01:07:05,971 --> 01:07:07,932
Thanks.

1374
01:07:11,647 --> 01:07:15,449
So we all know
that Clarence got traded...

1375
01:07:15,549 --> 01:07:19,449
and we all know this game
doesn't really matter anymore, right?

1376
01:07:19,549 --> 01:07:21,421
I've been thinking...

1377
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:26,591
We made it our mission
to win fourth place.

1378
01:07:27,596 --> 01:07:30,478
You know, fourth place
is still out there...

1379
01:07:30,578 --> 01:07:32,260
waiting for us to take it.

1380
01:07:33,735 --> 01:07:35,566
And we're this close.

1381
01:07:36,338 --> 01:07:38,499
Now I tried to pretend that...

1382
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:41,571
it didn't matter if
we won fourth or not.

1383
01:07:42,611 --> 01:07:44,602
The truth is...

1384
01:07:48,217 --> 01:07:53,086
I never wanted anything
more in my whole fucked-up life.

1385
01:07:54,289 --> 01:07:55,988
This game does matter.

1386
01:07:56,088 --> 01:07:57,020
It matters...

1387
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:02,627
because this is the last real game of
basketball any of us is ever gonna play.

1388
01:08:02,727 --> 01:08:04,393
Ever.

1389
01:08:05,601 --> 01:08:09,904
Saturday night, I say we leave it
all out there on the floor...

1390
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:13,237
because there is nothing else
for us to save it for.

1391
01:08:14,877 --> 01:08:19,405
Clarence or no Clarence,
NBA or no NBA...

1392
01:08:21,984 --> 01:08:23,781
this is for us.

1393
01:08:29,858 --> 01:08:31,849
Yeah. Let's do this.

1394
01:08:32,494 --> 01:08:35,363
Jackie Moon, I believe you have
one more game to promote.

1395
01:08:35,463 --> 01:08:37,832
- That's right.
- Damn right.

1396
01:08:37,932 --> 01:08:40,465
- Gentlemen?
- Let's bring it in.

1397
01:08:40,565 --> 01:08:42,065
- Ladies?
- C'mon.

1398
01:08:42,165 --> 01:08:45,270
- Yeah.
- Let's go, Tropics.

1399
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:48,036
- Let me hear you say, "Fourth place!"
- Fourth place!

1400
01:08:48,377 --> 01:08:50,004
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

1401
01:08:50,345 --> 01:08:51,937
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

1402
01:08:52,281 --> 01:08:54,182
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

1403
01:08:54,282 --> 01:08:57,214
Look, the Spurs may be
the number-one team in the league...

1404
01:08:57,314 --> 01:09:00,689
but come Saturday night
they're gonna have to prove it.

1405
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:02,190
Turtleneck.

1406
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:06,060
Mr. Moon, since this game
doesn't actually count...

1407
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,759
what exactly is your motivation?

1408
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:13,032
On Saturday, we're gonna be playing
for the Flint, Michigan Megabowl.

1409
01:09:13,132 --> 01:09:14,598
White pants.

1410
01:09:14,698 --> 01:09:16,971
Yeah, I don't know if I understand
what you mean by Megabowl?

1411
01:09:17,071 --> 01:09:19,204
It's a Megabowl.
What's not to understand?

1412
01:09:19,304 --> 01:09:20,304
This is history in the making.

1413
01:09:20,404 --> 01:09:25,179
You're gonna wanna tell your grandkids
and their grandkids and their grandkids.

1414
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,812
And when they look back
in the annals of history...

1415
01:09:27,912 --> 01:09:29,784
they're gonna be talkin'
about three things...

1416
01:09:29,884 --> 01:09:33,316
discovery of fire,
invention of the submarine...

1417
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:34,851
and the Flint, Michigan Megabowl.

1418
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:36,689
Right, but still the game doesn't count.

1419
01:09:36,789 --> 01:09:41,427
The trophy's 12 feet high.
And it is glorious. I've seen it.

1420
01:09:41,527 --> 01:09:43,594
Yeah, and when
we win the game...

1421
01:09:43,694 --> 01:09:45,398
that big gun's gonna shoot off.

1422
01:09:45,498 --> 01:09:48,066
The cannon doesn't actually fire.
It's a relic.

1423
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:49,633
We're gonna win the Megabowl.

1424
01:09:49,733 --> 01:09:52,337
Saturday! Eight o'clock!

1425
01:09:52,437 --> 01:09:54,068
Flint, Michigan Megabowl!

1426
01:09:54,409 --> 01:09:58,311
Flint, Michigan Megabowl!
Flint, Michigan Megabowl!

1427
01:09:59,214 --> 01:10:00,176
Fourth place! Fourth place!

1428
01:10:00,276 --> 01:10:03,814
The Tropics seem to have captured
every heart in this town of underdogs.

1429
01:10:03,914 --> 01:10:05,787
People have poured in
from around the state...

1430
01:10:05,887 --> 01:10:09,387
to root for this first Megabowl
championship.

1431
01:10:09,487 --> 01:10:11,359
- Fourth place! Fourth place!
- It's a wonderful night for Flint...

1432
01:10:11,459 --> 01:10:14,122
and a wonderful night
for the Flint Fairgrounds Coliseum.

1433
01:10:15,364 --> 01:10:16,682
Now, Flint will be playing...

1434
01:10:16,782 --> 01:10:18,666
without Coffee Black,
their top scorer...

1435
01:10:18,766 --> 01:10:24,639
as the Spurs have traded for several
new players from around the ABA.

1436
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,170
I was excited to be here
till I saw your face, Coffee.

1437
01:10:40,655 --> 01:10:44,352
Why's it so quiet in here?
Somebody say somethin'!

1438
01:10:45,827 --> 01:10:47,954
Monix, what time is it?

1439
01:10:49,331 --> 01:10:50,320
It's time.

1440
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:06,678
It is a sold-out crowd here
at the Flint Fairgrounds Coliseum...

1441
01:11:06,778 --> 01:11:09,515
as the Tropics walk onto the court.

1442
01:11:09,615 --> 01:11:12,284
I tell you what, Dick,
this makes a lot of sense...

1443
01:11:12,384 --> 01:11:15,689
this heroes' welcome
for this Flint Tropics team.

1444
01:11:15,789 --> 01:11:17,889
This is extraordinary.

1445
01:11:17,989 --> 01:11:20,226
Jackie Moon is Flint's favorite son...

1446
01:11:20,326 --> 01:11:22,961
and he has done more for this city...

1447
01:11:23,061 --> 01:11:26,333
than any human being
who's ever lived on this planet.

1448
01:11:26,433 --> 01:11:30,968
With the possible exception
of Henry Ford...

1449
01:11:31,068 --> 01:11:33,102
Jackie Moon has done
a lot for this city,

1450
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:34,372
you're right about that.

1451
01:11:46,288 --> 01:11:49,089
Good tip to the Spurs.
Behind the back.

1452
01:11:49,189 --> 01:11:51,458
And wow! A little "How do you do?"
From Markie.

1453
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:53,760
That's a pretty impressive start
for the Spurs.

1454
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:56,662
Running roughshod over the Tropics.

1455
01:11:59,801 --> 01:12:01,832
Vakidis passes to Doubleday.

1456
01:12:01,932 --> 01:12:03,461
Rejected.

1457
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:06,138
Scootsie passes to Jackie.

1458
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:07,940
Out to Twiggy, and...

1459
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,973
Stolen by Rebenkoff.

1460
01:12:10,073 --> 01:12:11,108
He pulls up for a dagger...

1461
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:13,047
and ouch, three points.

1462
01:12:13,147 --> 01:12:14,881
Yeah!

1463
01:12:14,981 --> 01:12:19,478
Yeah, I don't feel good about this.
I may not have brought enough Scotch.

1464
01:12:20,288 --> 01:12:22,188
Shit!

1465
01:12:23,825 --> 01:12:26,924
It's hard to say where the Tropics
are falling down worse tonight...

1466
01:12:27,024 --> 01:12:28,761
on defense or on offense.

1467
01:12:28,861 --> 01:12:32,233
And with Coffee Black on
the Spurs bench, the Tropics look lost.

1468
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:34,134
You're goin' in, Coffee Black.

1469
01:12:34,234 --> 01:12:37,069
Coach, I've got back spasms.
I can't do it.

1470
01:12:37,839 --> 01:12:40,103
Lutz, you're in.

1471
01:12:43,645 --> 01:12:44,978
Jackie! C'mon. Jackie, Jackie!

1472
01:12:45,078 --> 01:12:46,678
Moon to Ellis.

1473
01:12:46,778 --> 01:12:47,913
Ellis to Munson.

1474
01:12:48,013 --> 01:12:50,216
Munson to Monix.

1475
01:12:50,316 --> 01:12:52,951
Three points! Monix responds!

1476
01:12:53,051 --> 01:12:58,118
But it will take more than one fancy
three to defeat these mighty Spurs.

1477
01:12:59,594 --> 01:13:03,025
This is easily the worst half
of basketball the Tropics have played...

1478
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:04,831
since Monix took over as coach.

1479
01:13:04,931 --> 01:13:07,063
- Yeah, it's a
shit-fuckin'-sandwich, Dick.

1480
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:08,533
Let's watch the F-bomb, Lou.

1481
01:13:08,633 --> 01:13:10,100
With time expiring in the first half...

1482
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,041
Monix splits the screen
with a pass to Moon.

1483
01:13:13,141 --> 01:13:14,976
He goes up strong...

1484
01:13:15,076 --> 01:13:16,005
Gets taken out by Petrelli.

1485
01:13:16,105 --> 01:13:19,345
I don't think I've ever seen anyone
get taken out quite that hard before.

1486
01:13:19,445 --> 01:13:22,181
- This looks serious.
- Damn.

1487
01:13:22,281 --> 01:13:23,911
Monix, you gotta hit him in the nuts!

1488
01:13:24,452 --> 01:13:27,287
Father Pat breaking up what
could have been total pandemonium.

1489
01:13:27,387 --> 01:13:30,258
Come on. Jackie? Jackie.

1490
01:13:30,358 --> 01:13:33,160
- Come on, back to the bench.
- Jackie?

1491
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:34,786
He's got a pulse.

1492
01:13:35,764 --> 01:13:37,727
Let's get the stretcher.

1493
01:13:37,827 --> 01:13:40,601
- We don't have a stretcher.
- Jackie sold it.

1494
01:13:40,701 --> 01:13:42,300
- All right, well, let's get him up.
- Yeah, come on.

1495
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,737
Let's get him in the locker room,
guys. Hurry.

1496
01:13:43,837 --> 01:13:44,970
Come on, come on.

1497
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:48,842
Jackie's teammates doing just
an awful job of stabilizing his spine...

1498
01:13:48,942 --> 01:13:50,744
as they carry him off the court.

1499
01:13:50,844 --> 01:13:52,973
Come on, Jackie.

1500
01:14:15,537 --> 01:14:16,499
Yeah!

1501
01:14:16,599 --> 01:14:18,067
Where the hell
do you think you're goin'?

1502
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:19,101
- Coffee!

1503
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:21,638
You walk away from this team,
you will never play in the NBA.

1504
01:14:21,738 --> 01:14:23,645
That's my son! That's my son!

1505
01:14:23,745 --> 01:14:26,277
- Go, Clarence! Go, Clarence!
- You hear me, Coffee?

1506
01:14:26,377 --> 01:14:29,683
Look at this. Coffee Black
is walking over to the Tropics.

1507
01:14:29,783 --> 01:14:32,549
This crowd is going crazy!

1508
01:14:36,858 --> 01:14:38,990
Come on, Jackie, wake up.

1509
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:41,226
Jackie, come on,
it's me, it's Bobby Dee.

1510
01:14:41,326 --> 01:14:43,327
Wake up. Come on, open 'em up.

1511
01:14:43,427 --> 01:14:46,390
- Hey, you got any smelling salt?
- I think we do.

1512
01:14:47,402 --> 01:14:49,034
- Get up.
- Jackie.

1513
01:14:49,134 --> 01:14:50,904
- Come on, Jackie.
- Snap out of it. Hey.

1514
01:14:51,004 --> 01:14:53,273
Come on, baby.

1515
01:14:53,373 --> 01:14:54,501
Jackie.

1516
01:14:58,013 --> 01:14:59,344
Mom.

1517
01:15:01,683 --> 01:15:04,450
- I miss you, Mama.
- I miss you too, honey.

1518
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:08,322
- Come on, little fella. Jackie.
- Jackie.

1519
01:15:08,422 --> 01:15:10,353
Clarence, what are you doin' here?

1520
01:15:10,453 --> 01:15:14,059
What it look like?
I'm wit' y'all. He a'ight?

1521
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:17,330
Are you outta your mind?
You wanna lose your NBA contract?

1522
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,795
I don't care nothin'
about that, man. This...

1523
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:21,831
<i>is our season and we gonna finish it.</i>

1524
01:15:21,931 --> 01:15:23,636
So you're gonna blow the deal for this?

1525
01:15:23,736 --> 01:15:26,439
- Fourth place, right?
- Right.

1526
01:15:26,539 --> 01:15:28,572
- Let's get Tropical.
- Right on.

1527
01:15:28,672 --> 01:15:30,804
Come on, buddy. Come around.

1528
01:15:31,813 --> 01:15:33,546
Now, I want you to go forward...

1529
01:15:33,646 --> 01:15:36,883
and tell the others
what I have told you here today.

1530
01:15:36,983 --> 01:15:38,650
Do you understand me, son?

1531
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:41,086
Yes, Mama. You're so kind.

1532
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:43,755
I'm sorry I stole your song.

1533
01:15:43,855 --> 01:15:46,694
I forgave you for that a long time ago.

1534
01:15:46,794 --> 01:15:50,026
Jackie, it's time you forgave yourself.

1535
01:15:51,099 --> 01:15:54,164
I don't wanna leave this place.
It's so fluffy.

1536
01:15:54,264 --> 01:15:58,038
Now hurry up,
and don't forget what I said.

1537
01:15:58,138 --> 01:16:00,233
OK. Bye!

1538
01:16:01,376 --> 01:16:03,643
Bye, Mama. Bye.

1539
01:16:03,743 --> 01:16:05,512
Bye.

1540
01:16:05,612 --> 01:16:08,246
Hey... I threw up, Mom.

1541
01:16:08,346 --> 01:16:10,881
I know you did, sweetie.

1542
01:16:10,981 --> 01:16:13,216
I threw up all by myself.

1543
01:16:15,957 --> 01:16:17,392
- That's workin'.
- Here we go. Come on, Jackie.

1544
01:16:17,492 --> 01:16:19,490
A little eye flutter. Hello, fella!

1545
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:21,159
- Hey there!
- Mornin', sunshine.

1546
01:16:21,259 --> 01:16:22,394
We missed ya.

1547
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:24,163
This just in.

1548
01:16:24,263 --> 01:16:27,365
It sounds like Jackie Moon is up
and around the Tropics locker room.

1549
01:16:27,465 --> 01:16:31,901
Then fake the pass and go straight
to the basket. Twiggy, how hard is it?

1550
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:34,071
He keeps throwin' elbows.
What do you want me to do?

1551
01:16:34,171 --> 01:16:36,544
I want you to stand up to him,
ya pussy.

1552
01:16:36,644 --> 01:16:39,978
Monix, wait. I gotta tell
these guys somethin'.

1553
01:16:40,915 --> 01:16:43,047
I had a dream.

1554
01:16:43,147 --> 01:16:45,683
I had a dream I was in heaven.

1555
01:16:45,783 --> 01:16:48,319
And my mother spoke to me.

1556
01:16:48,419 --> 01:16:50,089
She was wearing
this flowing white gown...

1557
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:53,960
and she showed me
a brand-new way to score a basket.

1558
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:56,861
She called it the alley oop.

1559
01:16:57,832 --> 01:17:00,259
She spoke to me and she said,

1560
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:04,067
"With this gift, you
will win fourth place."

1561
01:17:11,112 --> 01:17:13,677
We are back in action here
at the Megabowl.

1562
01:17:13,777 --> 01:17:17,016
Coffee Black is playing for the Tropics.

1563
01:17:17,116 --> 01:17:18,486
Jackie makes the start here.

1564
01:17:18,586 --> 01:17:22,250
In fact, it looks like
he's running the offense.

1565
01:18:03,097 --> 01:18:04,363
What was that?

1566
01:18:04,463 --> 01:18:06,834
I'm sorry, I don't know
what just happened.

1567
01:18:06,934 --> 01:18:11,531
A very unusual series of moves
just made the ball go in.

1568
01:18:14,209 --> 01:18:15,705
Damn.

1569
01:18:15,805 --> 01:18:19,406
Yeah, I don't know why, Dick,
but I just got an erection.

1570
01:18:24,586 --> 01:18:26,853
Foul. No, two fouls.

1571
01:18:26,953 --> 01:18:29,919
Foul? ! I didn't touch anybody.

1572
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:31,988
Look, Jackie, people can't just
go flyin' in the air like that.

1573
01:18:32,088 --> 01:18:34,428
Please. My mom
wouldn't cheat in my dreams.

1574
01:18:34,528 --> 01:18:36,763
- What?
- She's an angel!

1575
01:18:36,863 --> 01:18:38,766
Heaven wants us to win this game!

1576
01:18:38,866 --> 01:18:41,235
- I'll burn your house down!
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1577
01:18:41,335 --> 01:18:44,104
It can't be a foul without
touchin' another player.

1578
01:18:44,204 --> 01:18:47,575
And it can't be traveling without
first establishing a pivot foot.

1579
01:18:47,675 --> 01:18:49,510
- That's right.
- It's two points, Father Pat.

1580
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:50,942
It is two points.

1581
01:18:54,716 --> 01:18:57,984
- All right, I'm gonna allow it.
- That's the gospel.

1582
01:18:58,084 --> 01:19:00,218
Two points, Flint.

1583
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:01,621
Are you outta your mind?

1584
01:19:01,721 --> 01:19:03,754
- He was floating. Is this ghost ball?
- It's legal, Coach.

1585
01:19:03,854 --> 01:19:05,288
- It's legal, Coach.
- What the hell is that?

1586
01:19:05,388 --> 01:19:07,194
Yeah!

1587
01:19:07,294 --> 01:19:09,563
It worked, Jackie!

1588
01:19:09,663 --> 01:19:11,292
Thanks, Mama!

1589
01:19:12,534 --> 01:19:14,997
Things are getting interesting
here in the second half.

1590
01:19:15,097 --> 01:19:18,101
It's the Spurs' ball
as Rebenkoff makes a shot.

1591
01:19:18,201 --> 01:19:19,539
Misses it.

1592
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:21,507
Rebound Tropics.

1593
01:19:24,012 --> 01:19:24,974
There it is again.

1594
01:19:25,074 --> 01:19:28,449
Clarence leaping and forcing the ball in
a downward direction through the net...

1595
01:19:28,549 --> 01:19:30,581
off of a high arching pass.

1596
01:19:30,681 --> 01:19:31,918
- It's a great play.
- It sure is.

1597
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:36,689
Hold on. I'm just being told
that this is called an alley oop!

1598
01:19:36,789 --> 01:19:38,288
Yes, that is easier to say.

1599
01:19:38,388 --> 01:19:39,986
Twig!

1600
01:19:40,995 --> 01:19:42,492
Monix passes to Jackie.

1601
01:19:42,592 --> 01:19:43,661
Jackie lobs to Clarence.

1602
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:45,599
And then, yes! Another alley oop.

1603
01:19:45,699 --> 01:19:47,399
The Spurs don't know what's hit 'em.

1604
01:19:47,499 --> 01:19:49,732
I love the alley oop.

1605
01:19:53,374 --> 01:19:54,602
Yes! Yeah!

1606
01:19:56,077 --> 01:19:58,602
# I wanna take you higher #

1607
01:20:00,882 --> 01:20:03,082
# I wanna take you higher #

1608
01:20:03,182 --> 01:20:04,147
Here comes the alley.

1609
01:20:04,247 --> 01:20:06,345
And there goes the oop!

1610
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:17,727
Timeout, white.

1611
01:20:17,827 --> 01:20:21,000
In all my years of radio,
I've never seen anything like this.

1612
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,168
The Tropics have fought their way back
from a huge deficit...

1613
01:20:24,268 --> 01:20:27,804
and now with 12 seconds left
in the history of this franchise...

1614
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:31,711
they are down by two,
and, man, you can feel the tension.

1615
01:20:31,811 --> 01:20:34,046
OK, guys, listen up.
They've made adjustments.

1616
01:20:34,146 --> 01:20:36,849
We can't keep runnin' the alley oop.
They're keying on Clarence.

1617
01:20:36,949 --> 01:20:39,118
So we're not gonna run the alley oop.

1618
01:20:39,218 --> 01:20:41,786
- What the hell we gonna run, then?
- The puke.

1619
01:20:41,886 --> 01:20:43,021
The puke?

1620
01:20:43,121 --> 01:20:46,156
Don't tell me you've forgotten it.
I seared it into your brains.

1621
01:20:46,256 --> 01:20:49,793
- This will work, OK? The puke.
- Right on.

1622
01:20:49,893 --> 01:20:51,766
I was gonna say exactly the same thing.

1623
01:20:51,866 --> 01:20:54,865
Good call."Let's get Tropical" on three.
One, two, three.

1624
01:20:54,965 --> 01:20:57,034
Let's get Tropical!

1625
01:20:57,134 --> 01:20:58,568
We're down to the last play.

1626
01:20:58,668 --> 01:20:59,973
Monix inbounds to Jackie.

1627
01:21:00,073 --> 01:21:02,004
Jackie passes right back to Monix.

1628
01:21:02,104 --> 01:21:03,842
Monix back to Jackie.

1629
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:06,409
The Tropics have gotta
make a move here, Dick.

1630
01:21:06,509 --> 01:21:08,849
Yeah, they need to find a way
to the hole and fast.

1631
01:21:08,949 --> 01:21:09,949
Monix finds Bee Bee.

1632
01:21:10,049 --> 01:21:12,151
Back door to Jackie.
He goes up strong...

1633
01:21:12,251 --> 01:21:15,285
- Fouled hard by Petrelli!
- Eat shit, Petrelli!

1634
01:21:15,385 --> 01:21:17,017
Don't you know
how to play basketball?

1635
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:20,892
Father Pat struggles to keep order...

1636
01:21:20,992 --> 01:21:23,426
between these two tough,
competitive teams.

1637
01:21:23,526 --> 01:21:27,430
All right. Black. Four-two.
With the body. Two shots.

1638
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:28,461
- Come on, Jackie!

1639
01:21:28,561 --> 01:21:30,635
Jackie will shoot two free throws here.

1640
01:21:30,735 --> 01:21:34,108
His team down by two,
with two seconds left on the clock.

1641
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:37,910
All right, gentlemen.
Relax on the first one, we got two here.

1642
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:40,179
Come on, Jackie.

1643
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:43,949
Don't worry, guys. I got these.
I'm very good at free throws.

1644
01:21:44,049 --> 01:21:48,284
Seriously, free throws are probably
the best facet of my game.

1645
01:21:51,259 --> 01:21:53,959
What the hell are you doin', Jackie?

1646
01:21:54,059 --> 01:21:56,525
What, you never see me
shoot free throws before?

1647
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:59,033
He's shootin' granny style.
Let 'im do his thing.

1648
01:21:59,133 --> 01:22:00,563
Always has.

1649
01:22:00,663 --> 01:22:02,626
Shit.

1650
01:22:03,638 --> 01:22:05,162
Here we go.

1651
01:22:06,774 --> 01:22:10,908
Jackie Moon holding the fate of Flint
in his fingertips.

1652
01:22:11,008 --> 01:22:13,742
- He kisses the ball for good luck.
- Sweet sugar.

1653
01:22:17,552 --> 01:22:19,487
It's good!

1654
01:22:19,587 --> 01:22:22,822
- Yes!
- Never doubted you, Jackie. Come on.

1655
01:22:22,922 --> 01:22:25,056
The Tropics need one more
to stay alive.

1656
01:22:25,156 --> 01:22:28,861
Watch the lines. Move on the release.

1657
01:22:28,961 --> 01:22:30,898
One more, Jackie.

1658
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:52,404
Flint wins the Megabowl!
Flint wins the Megabowl!

1659
01:23:52,747 --> 01:23:55,648
Flint wins the Megabowl!

1660
01:23:56,384 --> 01:23:58,983
- Fourth place! Fourth place!
- # Just move on up #

1661
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:00,887
Go Tropics! Go Tropics! Go Tropics!

1662
01:24:00,987 --> 01:24:03,219
# And keep on wishin' #

1663
01:24:04,225 --> 01:24:07,594
# Remember your dreams
are your only schemes #

1664
01:24:07,694 --> 01:24:09,926
# So keep on pushin' #

1665
01:24:11,999 --> 01:24:14,767
Who's number four?
Who's number four?

1666
01:24:14,867 --> 01:24:17,935
- Yeah, Scoots!
- God. We really did it.

1667
01:24:18,035 --> 01:24:21,532
Just a moment.
Just a moment, please. Don't...

1668
01:24:24,011 --> 01:24:27,043
- What are you doin'?
- # Just move on up #

1669
01:24:27,143 --> 01:24:30,106
- Fourth place! Fourth place!
- # And peace you will find #

1670
01:24:30,451 --> 01:24:31,816
Fourth place! Fourth place!

1671
01:24:32,153 --> 01:24:34,294
# Into the steeple
of beautiful people #

1672
01:24:34,394 --> 01:24:35,753
Fourth place! Fourth place!

1673
01:24:35,853 --> 01:24:37,688
# Where there's only one kind #

1674
01:24:41,963 --> 01:24:43,229
Yeah!

1675
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:44,259
- Hey, Coffee.
- What?

1676
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:49,292
I've changed my mind. I think we could
use that alley oop of yours in the NBA.

1677
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:52,740
Thanks, Coach! Mama!

1678
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,469
The NBA!

1679
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:57,641
- Hey!
- Yeah, baby!

1680
01:24:57,741 --> 01:25:00,277
- Way to go!
- Thank you.

1681
01:25:00,377 --> 01:25:03,481
# Move on up #

1682
01:25:03,581 --> 01:25:05,250
# And keep on wishin' #

1683
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:08,784
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1684
01:25:08,884 --> 01:25:11,989
- We did it! Yeah!
- Yeah!

1685
01:25:12,089 --> 01:25:13,021
- Jackie!
- Hey!

1686
01:25:13,121 --> 01:25:15,693
- Congratulations on the Megabowl!
- Thank you.

1687
01:25:15,793 --> 01:25:17,529
- Whatever that is.
- It's very exciting!

1688
01:25:17,629 --> 01:25:19,466
- Yeah.
- You're a hell of a promoter!

1689
01:25:19,566 --> 01:25:20,529
Yeah.

1690
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:23,537
Listen, I'm gonna be working
with the Commissioner of the NBA...

1691
01:25:23,637 --> 01:25:25,539
and I want you to join me.

1692
01:25:25,639 --> 01:25:28,773
Me in the NBA? ! Really?

1693
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:32,145
My God, thank you.
Can I bring my son-friend with me?

1694
01:25:32,245 --> 01:25:34,514
- Jackie, you don't have to do that.
- Yes, I do.

1695
01:25:34,614 --> 01:25:37,016
Mark my words,
as long as I'm alive, you'll both...

1696
01:25:39,186 --> 01:25:42,089
Everybody panic!

1697
01:25:42,189 --> 01:25:45,523
It's just like the Titanic,
