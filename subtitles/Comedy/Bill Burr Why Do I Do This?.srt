1
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,831
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:38,304
You know, I'll bet I could fry an egg
on your head right now.

3
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,381
If I wanted to.

4
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,603
You know, kiddo.

5
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:52,523
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

6
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:58,575
to know that there's nothing sadistic
in my actions.

7
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:04,031
Well, maybe towards
those other jokers.

8
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,458
But not you.

9
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,042
No, kiddo.

10
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,919
At this moment...

11
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:23,641
This is me
at my most masochistic.

12
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,217
Bill.

13
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,765
It's your baby.

Coming!

54
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,760
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

55
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,702
What you gonna do now, huh?
What you got?

56
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,576
I got your ass!
Remember that? Huh? Remember?

57
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,091
Okay.
Come on, bitch.

58
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,346
Come on.
Bring it on.

59
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,965
Mommy, I'm home.

60
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,387
Hey, baby.

61
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,385
How was school?

62
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,095
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

63
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,899
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his ass

64
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,318
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

65
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,067
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

66
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,444
Baby, now,
you can't come in here.

67
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:17,494
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

68
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,750
This is an old friend of Mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

69
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,797
Hi, honey.

70
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,467
I'm What's your name?

71
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,673
Her name is Nikki.

72
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,349
Nikki.

73
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,970
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

74
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,856
How old are you, Nikki?

75
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,655
Nikki, asked you
a question.

76
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,608
I'm 4.

77
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,239
4 years old?

78
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,619
You know,
I had a little girl once.

79
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,747
She'd be about 4 now.

80
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,086
Now, baby, me and Mommy's friend

81
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,635
got some grown-up talk
to talk about.

82
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,132
You go in your room.

83
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,214
I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

84
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,141
Okay?

85
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,011
Nikkia!

86
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,346
In your room.
Now.

87
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,653
You want some coffee?

88
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,989
Yeah. Sure.

89
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,002
This Pasadena homemaker's name

90
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,174
<i>is Jeanne Bell.</i>

91
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,376
<i>Her husband is
Dr. Lawrence Bell.</i>

92
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,463
<i>But back when we were acquainted,
four years ago,</i>

93
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,389
<i>her name was Vernita Green.</i>

94
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,468
<i>Her code name was Copperhead.</i>

95
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,303
<i>Mine, Black Mamba.</i>

96
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,979
Do you have a towel?

97
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,682
Yeah.

98
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,027
Thanks.

99
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,356
You still take cream
and sugar, right?

100
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,986
Yeah.

101
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,079
So I suppose it's a little late
for an apology?

102
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,452
You suppose correctly.

103
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,784
Look, bitch, I need to know

104
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,540
if you're gonna start any more shit
around my baby girl.

105
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,793
You can relax for now.

106
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,635
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

107
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,262
That's being more rational

108
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,636
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

109
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,890
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.

110
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,097
Not rationality.

111
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,186
Look.

112
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,988
I know I fucked you over.

113
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,815
I fucked you over bad.

114
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,321
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.

115
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,279
You have every right
to want to get even.

116
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,705
No, no, no, no, no.

117
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,123
No.

118
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,794
To get even, even Stephen,

119
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:18,672
I would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

120
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,970
then wait for your husband,
the good Dr. Bell, to come home

121
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,093
and kill him.

122
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,596
That would be even, Vernita.

123
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,890
That'd be about square.

124
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,972
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

125
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,602
But I can't.

126
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,978
All I can tell you is that
I'm a different person now.

127
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,939
Oh, great.

128
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,034
I don't care.

129
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,700
Be that as it may,

130
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,824
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

131
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:51,284
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

132
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,870
Bitch, you can stop right there.

133
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,044
Just because I have no wish
to murder you

134
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,795
before the eyes of your daughter

135
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,469
does not mean that parading her
in front of me

136
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,263
is gonna inspire sympathy.

137
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,342
You and I have
unfinished business.

138
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,643
And not a goddamn thing
you've done

139
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,220
in the subsequent four years,

140
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:16,525
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

141
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,941
So when do we do this?

142
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,897
It all depends.

143
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,824
When do you want to die?

144
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,653
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?

145
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,237
How about tonight, bitch?

146
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,539
Splendid.
Where?

147
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,368
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach Little League

148
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,748
about a mile from here.

149
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,170
We meet there around 2.30
in the morning,

150
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,252
dressed all in black,
your hair in a black stocking.

151
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,837
And we have us a knife fight.

152
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,888
We won't be bothered.

153
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:52,095
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.

154
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,113
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw

155
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,530
with an edged weapon.

156
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,949
Fuck you, bitch.

157
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,323
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.

158
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:13,703
So you can just kiss my motherfucking ass,
Black Mamba.

159
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,617
Black Mamba.

160
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,579
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

161
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,834
Weapon of choice?

162
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,666
If you want to stick with
your butcher knife, that's fine.

163
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,886
Very funny, bitch.

164
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,714
Very funny!

165
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,154
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

166
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,367
For that, I'm sorry.

167
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,290
But you can take my word for it.

168
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,750
Your mother had it coming.

169
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:04,568
When you grow up, if you
still feel raw about it...

170
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,814
I'll be waiting.

171
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,246
For those regarded as warriors...

172
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,664
When engaged in combat...

173
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:24,372
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the Warrior's only concern.

174
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:32,012
Suppress all human emotion
and compassion...

175
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:43,349
kill whoever stands in thy way, even
if that be Lord God, or Buddha himself.

176
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:55,528
This truth lies at the heart
of the art of combat.

177
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,228
Come on out to Dallas.

178
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,479
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

179
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,685
And next, we got some record.

180
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,897
Very own wild man,
Charlie Feathers.

181
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,452

188
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:12,067
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.

189
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,739
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

190
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,528
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.

191
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,452
Give me a figure.

192
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,329
Nine dead bodies.

193
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,956
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

194
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,880
Bride. Groom.

195
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,674
Reverend.

196
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,218
Reverend's wife.

197
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,263
They even shot that old coloured fella
that plays the organ.

198
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,808
It would appear to me
somebody objected to this union

199
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,761
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.

200
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:52,899
Good gravy, Marie.

201
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,863
What'd I tell you, Pop?

202
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,117
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

203
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,995
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

204
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,328
- You're in a house of worship.
- Sorry, Pop.

205
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,920
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

206
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,004
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.

207
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,423
Four, maybe five strong.

208
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,554
How can you tell?

209
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,306
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.

210
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,440
This ain't no
squirrelly amateur.

211
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,644
This is the work of a salty dog.

212
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,605
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.

213
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:40,317
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

214
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,699
all the colours are kept
inside the lines.

215
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,283
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

216
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,425
Who's the bride?

217
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,971
Don't know.

218
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,970
The name
on the marriage certificate

219
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,928
is Arlene Machiavelli.

220
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,308
That's a fake.

221
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:13,062
We've been calling her "The Bride"
on account of the dress.

222
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,144
You can tell she was pregnant.

223
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,945
Man would have to be a mad dog

224
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,741
to shoot a goddamn good-looking gal
like that in the head.

225
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,703
Look at her.

226
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,995
Hay-coloured hair.

227
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,544
Big eyes.

228
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,372
She's a little
blood-spattered angel.

229
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,839
Son Number One?

230
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,091
Yeah?

231
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,721
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

232
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,044
I might never have liked you.

233
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,754
Point in fact, I despise you.

234
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:34,093
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

235
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,516
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

236
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,601
that our kind
is rarely afforded.

237
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,030
My gift to you.

238
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,530
For fuck's sake.

239
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,459
Hello, Bill.

240
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,122
What's her condition?

241
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,378
Comatose.

242
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,675
Where is she?

243
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:12,005
I'm standing over her right now.

244
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,181
That's my girl.

245
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,513
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.

246
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:20,813
What?

247
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,482
We owe her better than that.

248
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,309
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

249
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,019
Will you keep your voice down?

250
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,979
You don't owe her shit!

251
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,155
May I say one thing?

252
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,074
Speak.

253
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,156
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.

254
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,113
But you didn't kill her.

255
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,164
And I put a bullet in her head.

256
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,414
But her heart
just kept on beating.

257
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,086
Now, you saw that yourself

258
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:48,963
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?

259
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,338
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.

260
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:58,927
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

261
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,932
But one thing we won't do

262
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:05,392
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat

263
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,353
and kill her in her sleep.

264
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,110
And the reason
we won't do that thing

265
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:17,116
is because that thing
would lower us.

266
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,573
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

267
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,791
I guess.

268
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,370
Do you really have to guess?

269
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,543
No.

270
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:31,376
I don't really have to guess.
I know.

271
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,012
Come on home, honey.

272
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,382
Affirmative.

273
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,768
I love you very much.

274
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,892
I love you, too.

275
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,567
Bye-bye.

276
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,160
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

277
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,333
Word of advice, shit head.

278
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,462
Don't you ever wake up.

279
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:52,963
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

280
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:56,215
Bill, it's your baby.

281
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,860
Oh, my baby.

282
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,554
Four years.

283
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,230
Four years.

284
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,254
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.

285
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,259
You getting your freak on
or what?

286
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,182
Oh, yeah, boy.

287
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,522
<i>20, 40, 60, 75.</i>

288
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,566
Yeah.
Now here's the rules.

289
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,359
Rule number one.

290
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,527
No punching her.

291
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,400
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner

292
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,026
or less some teeth, jig's up.

293
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,484
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

294
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,569
By the way,
this cunt's a spitter.

295
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,119
It's a motor-reflex thing.

296
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,039
But spit or no, no punching.

297
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,117
- Now, are we clear on rule one?
- Yeah.

298
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,330
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites. No Hickeys.

299
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,040
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.

300
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,252
After that,
it's all good, buddy.

301
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,420
Her plumbing down there
don't work.

302
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,096
Feel free to come in her
all you want.

303
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,049
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.

304
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,884
I'll be back in 20.

305
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,473
Yeah.

306
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,305
Oh, shit.

307
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,891
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes

308
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,568
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

309
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:03,068
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

310
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,028
<i>Bon appétit, good buddy.</i>

311
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,121
Oh, yeah.

312
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,207
Oh, God damn.

313
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,918
You are the best-looking girl
I've had today.

314
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,857
Oh.

315
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,348
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.

316
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,100
Coming in, ready or not.

317
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,852
Hey, buddy, did you have yourself
a good time, man?

318
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,012
Where's Bill?

319
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,726
Where's Bill?

320
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,184
Please stop hitting me.

321
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,435
Where's Bill?

322
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,559
I don't know who Bill is!

323
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,143
Bullshit!

324
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,614
Well, ain't you the slice

I mean, arigato.

Very easy.

435

No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.

436

Most difficult.

437
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:45,401
But you have Japanese tongue.

One warm sake!

449

You listen well...

For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.

454
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,381
If this were the military,

455
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:53,006
I'd be General by now!

456
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:55,839
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

457
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:59,718
If you were General, I'd be Emperor,

458
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,974
and you'd still get the sake -

459
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:04,643
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake!

Do you understand?

461
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,851
I'm not bald, okay? I shaved my head.

462

What brings you to Okinawa?

466
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,620

Oh, yeah.

468

Not quite.

470

Not friend?

471
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,179
I never met him.

00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,305
Who is he?

474
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,726
May I ask?

475
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:46,348
Hattori Hanzo.

476
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,575
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

477
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,875
I need Japanese steel.

478
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,255
Why do you need Japanese steel?

479
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,669
I have vermin to kill.

480
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:24,436
You must have big rats,

You may.

484
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,819
Wait.

485
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,450
Try the second one down.

486
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,343
Funny.

487
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,887
You like samurai swords.

488
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,351
I like baseball.

489
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:21,442
I wanted to show you these.

490
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,443
However...

491
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:27,778
someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...

492
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:34,121
I no longer make instruments of death.

493
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,997
What I have here...

494
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:42,835
l keep for their aesthetic
and sentimental value.

495
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:48,549
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

496
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:55,935
I have retired.

497
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,028
Then give me one of these.

498
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:08,450
These are not for sale.

499
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,030
I didn't say "sell me."

500
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:14,035
I said "give me."

501
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:19,371
Why should I help you?

502
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:24,342
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

503
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:30,340
And considering the student,

504
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:35,554
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.

505
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,611
You can sleep here.

506
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,032
It will take me a month...

507
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,331
to make the sword.

508
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,206
I suggest you spend it practicing.

509
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:15,713
I've completed doing...

510
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:21,474
what I swore an oath
to God, 28 years ago,

511
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,728
to never do again.

512
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:32,981
I have created "something
that kills people."

513
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:41,198
And in that purpose, I was a success.

514
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,293
I've done this because philosophically,

515
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:52,925
I am sympathetic to your aim.

516
00:57:55,931 --> 00:58:01,597
I can tell you with no ego,
this is my finest sword.

517
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:06,105
If on your journey, you
should encounter God...

518
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:09,354
God will be cut.

519
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:24,578
Yellow-haired warrior...

520
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:27,251
Go.

521
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,203
<i>Domo.</i>

522
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:53,816
<i>It was one year after
the massacre in El Paso, Texas,</i>

523
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,896
<i>that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny</i>

524
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,232
<i>financially
and philosophically in her</i>

525

<i>Shakespearian-in-magnitude
power struggle</i>

526
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,243
<i>with the other yakuza clans</i>

527
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:06,369
<i>over who would rule vice
in the city of Tokyo.</i>

528
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,747
<i>When the final sword
was sheathed,</i>

529
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:11,920
<i>it was O-Ren lshii
and her powerful posse...</i>

530
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:16,463
<i>the Crazy 88,
that proved the victor.</i>

531
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,841
<i>The pretty lady
to O-Ren's right,</i>

532
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,469
<i>who's dressed like
she's a villain on "Star Trek,"</i>

533
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,019
<i>is 0-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.</i>

534
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:31,770
<i>The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale,</i>

535
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:35,194
<i>another former protégée
of Bill'</i>.

536
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,864
<i>The young girl
in the school-girl uniform</i>

537
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:45,242
<i>is 0-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.</i>

538
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:48,791
<i>Gogo may be young,
but what she lacks in age,</i>

539
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,335
<i>she makes up for in madness.</i>

540
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,458
Do you like Ferraris?

541
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:59,385
Ferrari... ltalian trash.

542
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,516
Do you want to screw me?

543
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,734
Don't laugh! Do you want
to screw me, yes or no?

544
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,111
Yes.

545
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,526
How 'bout now, big boy?

546
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,071
Do you still wish to penetrate me...

547
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,908
or is it I...

548
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:33,081
or is it I... who has penetrated you?

549
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,296
<i>See what I mean?</i>

550
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:42,302
<i>The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,</i>

551
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:46,804
<i>the head general of O-Ren's personal army,
the Crazy 88.</i>

552
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,849
<i>And just in case
you were wondering</i>

553
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:55,183
<i>how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American</i>

554
01:00:55,277 --> 01:01:01,273
<i>become the boss of all bosses
in Tokyo, Japan, I'll tell you.</i>

555
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,233
<i>The subject of O-Ren's blood
and nationality</i>

556
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,989
<i>came up before the council
only once.</i>

557
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,995
<i>The night O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.</i>

558
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,452
<i>The man who seems bound
and determined</i>

559
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:17,004
<i>to break the mood
is Boss Tanaka.</i>

560
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,923
<i>And what Boss Tanaka
thinks</i> is...

561
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,758
Boss Tanaka!

562
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,681
What's the meaning of this outburst?

563
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,804
This is a time for celebration!

564
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:33,183
And what exactly are we celebrating?

565
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,432
The perversion of our illustrious council?

566
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:41,521
Tanaka, have you gone mad?

567
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:42,946
I will not tolerate this!

568
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,616
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

569
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:52,285
Tanaka-San, of what
perversion do you speak?

570
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,292
My father...

571
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:03,091
along with yours, and along with yours,
started this council.

572
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:04,589
And while...

573
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,340
you laugh like stupid donkeys...

574
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,342
they weep in the afterlife...

575
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,470
Shut up!

576
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,801
Over the perversion committed today!

577
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,393
Outrageous!

578
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,690
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!

579
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:20,063
Bastard!

580
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,193
Fuck face!

581
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,896
Gentlemen.

582
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:31,491
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

583
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:37,918
By all means, allow him to express it.

584
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:43,090
I speak, of the perversion done to this
council,

585
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,676
which I love...

586
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,595
more than my own children,

587
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:54,352
by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!

588
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:21,212
So that you understand how serious I am...

589
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,630
l'm going to say this in English.

590
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,642
As your leader...

591
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,644
I encourage you
from time to time,

592
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:45,729
and always in a respectful manner,
to question my logic.

593
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,062
If you're unconvinced

594
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,615
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

595
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:50,907
tell me so.

596
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:52,610
But allow me to convince you.

597
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:54,741
And I promise you,
right here and now,

598
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,369
no subject will ever be taboo.

599
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,748
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

600
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,630
The price you Pay

601
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:09,005
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage

602
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,929
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.

603
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:15,383
Just like this fucker here.

604
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:20,262
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches

605
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:25,193
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!

606
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,862
I didn't think so.

607
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:35,035
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

608
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,579

01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:59,039
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

649
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,181
Who do you remind me of?

650
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,093
Charlie Brown!

651
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,642
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.

652
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,064
Charlie Brown.

653
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:26,516
Four pepperoni pizzas.

654
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:28,443
That's not on our menu...

655
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,520
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!

656
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:34,608
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

657
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:38,115
O-Ren lshii!

658
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,990
You and I have unfinished business!

659
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:14,416
Charlie Brown, beat it.

660
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:23,683
Miki.

661
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,653
TEAR THE BITCH APART!

662
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:19,250
So, O-Ren, any more subordinates
for me to kill?

663
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,627
Hi!

664
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:25,679
Gogo. right?

665
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,132
Bingo.

666
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,184
And you're Black Mamba.

667
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:35,515
Our reputations precede us.

668
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,188
Don't they?

669
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:45,071
Gogo, I know you feel
you must protect your mistress.

670
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,661
But I beg you.

671
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,784
Walk away.

672
01:17:57,131 --> 01:17:59,122
You call that begging?

673
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:08,097
You can beg better than that.

674
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,051
Aah!

675
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:16,019
Aah!

676
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:18,980
Aah!

677
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:23,751
Is that what I think it is?

678
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,545
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

679
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:33,925
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

680
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,673
Silly rabbit.

681
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:38,184
Trix are for...

682
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:39,349
Kids.

683
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,897
Hvah!

684
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:55,717
Hvah!

685
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:10,016
Aaaaaaaaahh!

686
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:11,108
Aaaaaaaaahh!

687
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:30,502
Aaahh!

688
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:38,900
Aaaaahhh!

689
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:54,523
Aaah!

690
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,776

This is what you get for
fucking around with yakuzas!

708
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,695
Go home to your mother!

709
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:16,181
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...

710
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:19,010
take them with you!

711
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,095
However...

712
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:27,443
leave the limbs you've lost.

713
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:32,106
They belong to me now.

714
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,413
Except you, Sofie!

715
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:43,288
You stay right where you are.

716
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:39,257
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

717
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,850
Where was it made?

718
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:49,020
Okinawa.

719
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:53,904
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

720
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:56,986
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

721
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:58,488
YOU LIE!

722
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:13,507
Swords, however, never get tired.

723
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:18,254
I hope you've saved your energy.

724
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:23,551
If you haven't...

725
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:27,479
you might not last five minutes.

726
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,646
But as last looks go,

727
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:34,645
you could do worse.

728
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:17,938
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.

729
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:23,063
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

730
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:29,411
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

731
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:01,484
Attack me...

732
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:04,112
with everything you have.

733
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:01,916
For ridiculing you earlier...

734
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:06,625
l apologize.

735
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:16,677
Accepted.

736
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:34,152
Ready?

737
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:40,117
Come on.

738
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:21,077
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

739
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:34,257
My Sofie.

740
01:39:34,343 --> 01:39:36,675
I'm so sorry.

741
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:43,175
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

742
01:39:43,269 --> 01:39:45,010
No more of that.

743
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,266
But still...

744
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:49,472
But still nothing.

745
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:54,854
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

746
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:57,860
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

747
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:01,902
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

748
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:04,112
The first reason is information.

749
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:08,292
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!

750
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:10,774
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.

751
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:15,166
But I am gonna ask you questions.

752
01:40:15,259 --> 01:40:19,298
And every time
you don't give me answers,

753
01:40:19,388 --> 01:40:21,880
I'm gonna cut something off.

754
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:28,687
And I promise you,
they will be things you will miss!

755
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,556
Give me your other arm!

756
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:38,189
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

757
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:39,693
If you had to guess...

758
01:40:39,784 --> 01:40:41,240
What they've been doing.

759
01:40:41,327 --> 01:40:42,658
why she left you alive...

760
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:44,452
And where I can find them.

761
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:47,327
what would be your guess?

762
01:40:48,334 --> 01:40:50,951
Guessing won't be necessary.

763
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:53,127
She informed me.

764
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:59,084
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

765
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:01,711
As I said before,

766
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:05,344
I've allowed you to keep your wicked life
for two reasons.

767
01:41:06,477 --> 01:41:11,768
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

768
01:41:11,857 --> 01:41:15,646
everything that happened
here tonight.

769
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:19,070
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

770
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:22,740
by witnessing
your deformed body.

771
01:41:22,827 --> 01:41:26,991
I want you to tell him all
the information you just told me.

772
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:30,119
I want him to know what I know.

773
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:34,419
I want him to know
I want him to know.

774
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:36,917
And I want them all to know

775
01:41:37,008 --> 01:41:43,675
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

776
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:12,165
Revenge is never a straight line.

777
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:16,665
It's a forest.

778
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:20,841
And like a forest it's
easy to lose your way...

779
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:25,215
to get lost... to
forget where you came in.

780
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:32,393
That woman deserves her revenge.

781
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:42,070
And we deserve to die.

782
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:49,410
She must suffer
to her last breath.

783
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:05,089
How did you find me?

784
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:06,920
I'm the man.

785
01:43:10,851 --> 01:43:14,264
One more thing, Sofie.

786
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:19,350
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?
