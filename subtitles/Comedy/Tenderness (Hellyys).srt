1
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:27,495
<i>My wife likes to say
there are two kinds of people.</i>

2
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,330
<i>Those chasing pleasure. . .</i>

3
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,700
<i>and those running from pain.</i>

4
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,815
<i>Lorelei Cranston is running.</i>

5
00:01:46,885 --> 00:01:49,480
<i>Running from all kinds of everything.</i>

6
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,420
<i>Probably has been her whole life.</i>

7
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:23,285
<i>If you ask me, nobody
gets to escape their pain.</i>

8
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:29,520
<i>It's there when you
brush your teeth at night.</i>

9
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:31,925
<i>It's there before breakfast.</i>

10
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,665
<i>It'll come up, fierce and sharp.</i>

11
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:38,995
<i>It'll lay on you, blunt and heavy.</i>

12
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,770
<i>The most you can hope for is one good day.</i>

13
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:54,510
<i>'Cause on a good day,</i>

14
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:57,520
<i>you get to tell yourself</i>

15
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,385
<i>'' I can fix this.</i>

16
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:02,585
<i>Today can be different. ''</i>

17
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,584
<i>''Today something might change. ''</i>

18
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:58,207
Yeah?

19
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:02,710
Gary?

20
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,701
And then Mrs. Rodell yelled at Anna

21
00:04:29,778 --> 00:04:32,508
and said she'd had enough of her
last year in her class.

22
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:36,813
And Anna was like,
''Hello, I wasn't in your class last year. ''

23
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:41,879
Well, it's a good thing
I didn't know any of this, or. . .

24
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:44,657
What?

25
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:49,622
I got you a little treat
for doing so well in trigonometry.

26
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:51,222
Thanks.

27
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,358
You're welcome.

28
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:53,765
Trig's easy. It's just memory.

29
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:55,599
God, I hope you don't
remember everything

30
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,161
when you get older.

31
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,354
It's not just because
you did so well in math.

32
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:24,392
l've got some news.

33
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:27,726
Come on honey, sit down.

34
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,240
And how you take it is important to me.

35
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:40,542
l've asked Gary to move in with us.

36
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:43,083
For real.

37
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:47,417
Not just a couple nights
a week or whatever.

38
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:50,753
I know it's only been a little while,

39
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:56,024
but it just feels so different
this time, you know?

40
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,893
Yeah, it is different this time.

41
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:02,458
Yeah?

42
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:11,734
<i>Some people live for their pain.</i>

43
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:15,114
<i>It's all they've got.</i>

44
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:17,875
<i>They stay up with it.</i>

45
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:22,317
<i>Afraid it might slip away.</i>

46
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,549
<i>People like me.</i>

47
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:33,263
<i>I would love to dream.</i>

48
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:37,936
<i>But one way or another--</i>

49
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:43,340
<i>. . . I'm always awake.</i>

50
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,087
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

51
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,423
<i>Oh, Dotty.</i>

52
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:41,294
<i>She won't let you go.</i>

53
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:54,508
<i>You like that? Yes!</i>

54
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,842
<i>Look at that. Look at that.</i>

55
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:15,562
<i>Look at her. She's really amazing.</i>

56
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:34,717
<i>Oh, Dotty.</i>

57
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,714
<i>That's a good girl.</i>

58
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:59,637
My stars are really nice this week.

59
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:04,978
They said, ''Financial woes through midweek
give way to--''

60
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:08,642
What's that word?
It means horns of plenty.

61
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,415
They're kind of bullshit anyway.

62
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:15,452
Horoscopes.

63
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:19,424
No offense, but ... kind of bullshit.

64
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:51,327
<i>. . . confirming today the teen
will be tried as an adult</i>

65
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:53,022
<i>for the brutal murder of his parents.</i>

66
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:54,996
<i>His case will be heard
in Buffalo City Court,</i>

67
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:56,692
<i>commencing later this month.</i>

68
00:09:56,767 --> 00:10:00,794
<i>By contrast, Eric Komenko committed
the same crime at 1 5,</i>

69
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,965
<i>but prosecutors chose not to try him
as an adult in this case,</i>

70
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,805
<i>citing high levels
of the antidepressant Zoloxia</i>

71
00:10:06,877 --> 00:10:10,108
<i>found in his bloodstream
as a mitigating factor.</i>

72
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,546
<i>Komenko's sentence, juvenile detention.</i>

73
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:16,382
<i>He is expected to be released
this coming Friday on his 18th birthday,</i>

74
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:18,147
<i>his record expunged.</i>

75
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,485
<i>Public questions
about Komenko's case remain, however.</i>

76
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:23,923
<i>Victims' rights groups
are protesting his release,</i>

77
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:27,451
<i>while members of Komenko's Baptist
congregation are supporting it.</i>

78
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:44,410
Komenko!

79
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,141
Lieutenant's here.

80
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,950
I can follow him, be close by.

81
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,646
It's going to pay off for us later on.

82
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:53,188
But I'm going to need your help.

83
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:54,279
Anything you need.

84
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,187
All right, Brian. Thank you.

85
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:11,605
Mexico.

86
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:13,266
Cool.

87
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:19,469
I wanted to take Spanish,
but the teacher here got laid off.

88
00:11:20,782 --> 00:11:22,750
Spanish?

89
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:25,909
That could be helpful.

90
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:30,958
What's happening on the college front?

91
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:34,358
I didn't want to send
applications postmarked from here.

92
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:37,557
That makes sense.

93
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:41,728
So, you're going to live with your aunt?

94
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:42,861
Yeah.

95
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:45,201
You don't think that might be hard?

96
00:11:45,273 --> 00:11:47,537
She said she wants me there.

97
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:52,977
Antidepressants
messed with my chemistry.

98
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,207
The state even testified to that.

99
00:11:54,282 --> 00:11:56,773
I know. I was there.

100
00:11:56,851 --> 00:12:00,844
Look, I did this evil thing.

101
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:02,355
But I know I can put it behind me.

102
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,653
That's what expunged means.

103
00:12:05,794 --> 00:12:07,125
What do you want from me?

104
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,365
You're a psychopath, Eric.

105
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:13,798
You're going to kill again.

106
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,563
You know it, and I know it.

107
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:18,037
And I want to prevent that from happening.

108
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:23,099
And when I do, I want you to know
it's going to make me very happy.

109
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:25,407
It's the best thing for you.

110
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:31,915
When you walk out of here,
know I will be waiting for you.

111
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,456
I got nothing else to do.

112
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,568
Thanks.

113
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,343
I hope your wife gets better.

114
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,917
<i>Let's go, guys!</i>

115
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,292
<i>Back to class. Let's go!</i>

116
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,534
I could get you a magazine, John.

117
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:34,401
Sorry.

118
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:36,463
How about some pie?

119
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:40,202
Not tonight, Debbie.

120
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,155
<i>Hi. Would you like some more coffee?</i>

121
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:55,522
<i>Yeah, a cup will do.</i>

122
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:01,186
Come on. Let's move it.

123
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:05,921
We got five minutes to clean this place up.

124
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:30,018
Hey!

125
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:31,554
Get her out of there.

126
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:33,486
I got her.

127
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:37,916
Open up!

128
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:04,583
Komenko.

129
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:50,220
<i>- Komenko!
- Right here!</i>

130
00:17:56,271 --> 00:17:57,795
Here you go, Eric.

131
00:17:57,873 --> 00:17:59,033
Good luck.

132
00:18:04,513 --> 00:18:05,480
Hey, Komenko!

133
00:18:05,547 --> 00:18:06,536
Eric! Eric!

134
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:14,314
You going home?

135
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:23,825
Not exactly.

136
00:19:13,948 --> 00:19:15,108
Morning.

137
00:19:15,182 --> 00:19:16,376
Good morning.

138
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:20,485
We're two early risers.

139
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:21,680
Yeah.

140
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:25,257
Come and sit.

141
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:26,987
Have some breakfast.

142
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,639
Eric, you don't have to pray.

143
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:50,478
Or only if you want to.

144
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,815
In this house,
your spirituality is your own.

145
00:19:53,886 --> 00:19:56,081
I do want to.

146
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:57,918
Okay.

147
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:14,170
This isn't a library.

148
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,105
Fuck off, Paul.

149
00:20:22,982 --> 00:20:24,677
A note from Lori there for you.

150
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:26,685
Read it to me, sugar?

151
00:20:34,594 --> 00:20:37,085
She's going to go stay
at Kim's for the weekend.

152
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:39,063
One of the girls from the store
is going to drive her.

153
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:53,471
Excuse me.

154
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:31,206
It's okay.

155
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:36,684
I'm sorry.

156
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,655
It was nice of you to use a mint.

157
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:26,297
Wow. You look like a real college kid.

158
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,235
You mind me saying ''kid''?

159
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,704
No.

160
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,974
Should I try that?

161
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:35,272
Sure.

162
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,809
- Here.
- Thanks.

163
00:22:44,422 --> 00:22:46,583
So, the money for the house came to--

164
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,147
Well, it's quite a lot.

165
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:50,215
I'll work for my money.

166
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:52,921
College is a full-time job.

167
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,260
Just don't forget who you are.

168
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,767
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

169
00:23:08,211 --> 00:23:10,202
I'm sorry, too.

170
00:23:42,545 --> 00:23:44,206
Where's Battenville?

171
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,747
<i>North of Albany.</i>

172
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:47,248
<i>Some random town.</i>

173
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:48,306
That's cool.

174
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:53,377
I was going to go to Albany
to look at colleges.

175
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:55,320
Maybe I could stop by.

176
00:23:59,795 --> 00:24:02,195
Where should we meet?

177
00:24:02,264 --> 00:24:04,198
<i>There's a place out here called FunLand.</i>

178
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:06,200
- Please!
- Let's go. Go, go, go.

179
00:24:06,268 --> 00:24:08,293
Can we get an umbrella?

180
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:12,068
- A what?
- A ladies' choice.

181
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,108
<i>They still have a cotillion.</i>

182
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:15,803
ls that what they're called?

183
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:16,867
<i>Can you be here on Sunday?</i>

184
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:18,640
Yeah, I think so.

185
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:20,511
<i>FunLand. Sunday.</i>

186
00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:21,742
FunLand.

187
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:23,250
<i>How about 5:00?</i>

188
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,319
Hey, Maria. . .

189
00:25:02,223 --> 00:25:03,690
What do you like?

190
00:25:10,064 --> 00:25:12,191
Hey, Maria. . .

191
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:26,838
What the--

192
00:25:26,914 --> 00:25:28,779
Shit!

193
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:43,596
I'm sorry.

194
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:45,928
I was just going to
wait until you stopped and then sneak out.

195
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,624
It was raining and I needed
a place that was dry.

196
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:48,725
I was going to go home,

197
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:50,396
but then there was this dog barking,
so I came in here.

198
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:53,304
Did someone put you up to this?

199
00:25:53,374 --> 00:25:55,342
No, of course not.

200
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:56,341
You were with the reporters.

201
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,639
No, I wasn't.

202
00:25:58,712 --> 00:26:00,202
How old are you?

203
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,338
I'm 16.

204
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:07,919
How old are you really?

205
00:26:07,988 --> 00:26:09,785
- I'm 16.
- Get in front.

206
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,495
Your belt.

207
00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:22,495
I'm so sorry.

208
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:24,469
This isn't how I thought it would be.

209
00:26:24,537 --> 00:26:27,097
- I just wanted to--
- Just stay quiet.

210
00:26:37,817 --> 00:26:39,114
Hey.

211
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:41,449
License and registration.

212
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:01,533
Was there a problem?

213
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:03,404
No, sir. Just. . .

214
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:05,272
. . . need to get some sleep, I guess.

215
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,608
Yeah, he had to work all night.

216
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:13,079
It's illegal in the state of New York
for your girlfriend to ride back there.

217
00:27:13,152 --> 00:27:14,278
Yes, sir.

218
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:18,412
Gesundheit.

219
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:21,892
Thanks.

220
00:27:23,095 --> 00:27:24,084
Get home safe.

221
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,971
I don't think I've ever seen
a Chinese cop before.

222
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,347
No, I don't think I have.

223
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:47,146
I'm Lori. Lori Cranston.

224
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:53,614
My real name's Lorelei, actually.

225
00:27:53,692 --> 00:27:54,886
But I hate that name.

226
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,103
I don't even know
where my mom got it from.

227
00:27:56,336 --> 00:27:58,386
Have you ever seen a Chinese cop?

228
00:27:58,464 --> 00:28:00,489
I don't think it's racist to ask that.

229
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:03,025
Do you want me to get out?

230
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:05,729
And then what? You'll call the papers?

231
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:09,239
No. I guess my mom will come get me.

232
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:12,004
But I'd rather stay.

233
00:28:17,148 --> 00:28:19,810
Are you one of the ones who wrote?

234
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:22,512
What? No.

235
00:28:22,587 --> 00:28:24,111
Please. I--

236
00:28:24,188 --> 00:28:28,181
I just thought after all that time,

237
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:31,057
maybe you'd like a girl around.

238
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:32,960
Just a friend.

239
00:28:34,732 --> 00:28:36,222
We've met before.

240
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,996
You were outside my aunt's house.

241
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:43,264
I don't mean then.

242
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:54,348
Look at me and think.

243
00:28:57,088 --> 00:28:59,283
I don't know. In a facility?

244
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:02,683
No.

245
00:29:06,263 --> 00:29:08,458
I mean, I'm not all Suzy Creamcheese
or whatever.

246
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:11,966
But no.

247
00:29:25,615 --> 00:29:27,742
Think you can find your way home?

248
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,009
Take it.

249
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:34,784
You really don't remember me?

250
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,291
No.

251
00:29:38,662 --> 00:29:40,960
I didn't look like this.

252
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:42,999
Get home safe.

253
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,896
It was right before your parents.

254
00:29:48,104 --> 00:29:49,765
By the river.

255
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:02,045
I guess nothing ever happens
the way you think it will.

256
00:30:29,011 --> 00:30:33,607
I'm going to be gone
for a couple of days.

257
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:36,310
I got to look after that Komenko kid.

258
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,354
Now this is where you tell me
to keep my hat on.

259
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:48,930
And I tell you I don't have one.

260
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,426
You'd laugh, wouldn't you, baby?

261
00:30:58,707 --> 00:31:01,369
Same old dumb joke.

262
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:10,707
Hey, can you think of a nastier word
than ''sneeze guard''?

263
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,221
I mean, it's this close to, like,
''snot window'' or something.

264
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:18,625
Hey, what's this?

265
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:20,455
I think it's curry.

266
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:22,852
Cool!

267
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:25,627
I've never had it before.

268
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:46,185
Amen.

269
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:47,812
Amen.

270
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:14,374
God.

271
00:32:17,684 --> 00:32:20,414
Geminis are indecisive.
About most things.

272
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:22,114
Not about important stuff, though.

273
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:24,282
About important stuff,
once I make up my mind--

274
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:25,552
Do Leos ever do that?

275
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:28,594
Just, like, go after something?

276
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:33,390
You still have to tell me where we met.

277
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:45,337
Picture a river.

278
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:49,979
A girl wearing glasses.

279
00:32:57,858 --> 00:32:59,792
Can you tie them in a knot?

280
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,125
Can you tie them in a bow?

281
00:33:03,196 --> 00:33:05,027
Can you throw them over your shoulder

282
00:33:05,098 --> 00:33:06,497
Like a Continental soldier?

283
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:09,091
Do your ears hang low?

284
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:11,364
Do your ears stand high?

285
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:12,996
Do they point up to the sky?

286
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:15,302
Do they droop when they're wet--

287
00:33:29,288 --> 00:33:31,415
- Hey.
- Hi.

288
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,923
You lost?

289
00:33:35,594 --> 00:33:37,494
What are you doing out here?

290
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:40,999
Just exploring around.

291
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:46,596
Do your ears hang high?

292
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:48,333
Do they point up to the sky?

293
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:49,772
Do they droop when they're wet?

294
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:51,673
Do they stiffen when they're dry?

295
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:53,405
Can you semaphore your neighbor

296
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,639
With a minimum of labor?

297
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:58,581
Do your ears stand high?

298
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:06,915
Anything?

299
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,221
You were just exploring around.

300
00:34:16,802 --> 00:34:18,200
You remember me?

301
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:28,244
Oh, my God.

302
00:34:28,313 --> 00:34:29,905
Here you go.

303
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:34,111
Yeah, of course I remember you.

304
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:36,881
You were the detective on the case.

305
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,783
I was concerned when l
saw you at my door.

306
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,884
I apologize. I didn't think.

307
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:44,929
Why are you here?

308
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:48,261
Eric doesn't have a parole officer, right?

309
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,732
No, he doesn't.

310
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:52,531
And I'm pretty much retired, actually.

311
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:54,299
You know, actually,

312
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:56,237
I just had the weekend off,
so I thought I'd--

313
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:58,741
So you came down to Lakewood?

314
00:35:01,112 --> 00:35:02,841
I just thought I would come down

315
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:05,280
and make sure his transition
was a healthy one, that's all.

316
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,342
Should I be asking
if your agenda is a healthy one?

317
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:11,582
Yes, it is.

318
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:13,624
And I appreciate you
asking me that question.

319
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:15,625
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

320
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:19,423
Can I ask you how. . .

321
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:23,262
how you are with him here?

322
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,961
It's hard, you know.

323
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:30,329
When I was in the courtroom,

324
00:35:30,407 --> 00:35:32,466
all I kept thinking was. . .

325
00:35:32,543 --> 00:35:34,477
thank God they haven't
called me to testify

326
00:35:34,545 --> 00:35:37,776
because I'd have to tell the truth. . .

327
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:44,380
about how our family
is damaged, so damaged.

328
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:47,582
We never talked about anything,

329
00:35:47,658 --> 00:35:50,320
and Eric just sat there in the middle of it,

330
00:35:50,394 --> 00:35:53,261
and my sister's. . .

331
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,457
I don't know.

332
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:58,831
She was terrified of the world.

333
00:36:00,737 --> 00:36:02,102
This one and the next.

334
00:36:02,172 --> 00:36:07,667
I'm not a believer
in medicating adolescents,

335
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:10,076
but my sister had a teenage boy.

336
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:15,141
She had no clue how to deal with him,

337
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:17,517
so she drugged the feelings out of him.

338
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:25,055
Still, he killed his mom.

339
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:38,304
He said he was going to Albany
to look at campuses.

340
00:36:38,374 --> 00:36:43,004
I've been a teacher for 14 years.

341
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,014
I have a pretty good sense
when a kid's lying.

342
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:52,881
Well. . .

343
00:36:52,955 --> 00:36:56,447
I might take a run up there
to see that he checked in okay.

344
00:36:59,195 --> 00:37:00,253
Thank you.

345
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:09,162
You have a very nice house.

346
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,342
You want to see something?

347
00:37:23,686 --> 00:37:25,313
I got a lucky star tattoo.

348
00:37:27,522 --> 00:37:28,887
This way, if they ever superimpose

349
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:30,925
someone else's face on my body,
like, on the internet,

350
00:37:30,992 --> 00:37:33,460
I'll know, and I can really sue them.

351
00:37:33,528 --> 00:37:35,359
You're a freak.

352
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:39,964
It's just ball point.

353
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,968
I got bored last night and drew it on.

354
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:48,769
I'm pretty vanilla, really.

355
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:50,834
No tattoos, no piercings.

356
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:57,015
Did they let you listen to music in there?

357
00:37:57,085 --> 00:37:59,144
No.

358
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,120
I can teach you.

359
00:38:01,189 --> 00:38:03,282
I know all the new music.

360
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:06,093
Here.

361
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:07,526
<i>He's gonna establish his kingdom.</i>

362
00:38:07,595 --> 00:38:08,721
<i>He's gonna set up his--</i>

363
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:16,327
There's a train station in this next town,

364
00:38:16,404 --> 00:38:17,371
so. . .

365
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:18,929
<i>. . . reach for you--</i>

366
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:23,773
So I'll give you some cash
for the train back to Buffalo.

367
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:26,712
But I just thought
I'd take one back from Albany.

368
00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:31,183
Look, you're cool, Lori, really,

369
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:35,312
but I need to be alone, okay? I--

370
00:38:35,389 --> 00:38:37,755
I need to make a fresh start.

371
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:42,996
Well, aren't I a fresh start?

372
00:38:43,063 --> 00:38:45,395
It doesn't get much fresher than old Lori.

373
00:38:50,604 --> 00:38:52,697
I'm basically a virgin.

374
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:55,640
That has nothing to do with it.

375
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:02,145
I just need to stay focused, all right?

376
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:04,248
When I find a college,
I'll send you my email.

377
00:39:04,518 --> 00:39:06,848
We can write. Okay?

378
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,615
I wouldn't tell her.

379
00:39:10,491 --> 00:39:13,289
I mean, really, there's nothing to tell.

380
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,557
But if there were,
it would just be what happens, right?

381
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,188
What are you talking about?

382
00:39:18,265 --> 00:39:19,425
Your girlfriend.

383
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,967
I don't have a girlfriend.

384
00:39:21,034 --> 00:39:22,763
You were saying her name.

385
00:39:24,104 --> 00:39:25,230
I what?

386
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:28,797
When I was in the back,
I wasn't eavesdropping or anything.

387
00:39:28,876 --> 00:39:30,241
You just kept saying her name,

388
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,140
like '' Maria, Maria. Hey, Maria. ''

389
00:39:32,211 --> 00:39:35,009
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria.

390
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,982
Just stop.

391
00:39:46,692 --> 00:39:48,626
I'm sorry.

392
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,527
I didn't mean to poke fun at you.

393
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:56,034
I guess I'm just jealous.

394
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,696
I don't know what you think you heard.

395
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,205
There's no girlfriend.

396
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,366
Really?

397
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,574
Yeah.

398
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:11,039
That's cool.

399
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:23,051
I need to take a leak.

400
00:41:04,202 --> 00:41:06,033
I wish I smoked.

401
00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:13,677
I kept saying somebody's name?

402
00:41:14,746 --> 00:41:16,213
Maria.

403
00:41:19,284 --> 00:41:20,945
Maria.

404
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:22,316
Yeah.

405
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,758
You sure?

406
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,064
I was right there.

407
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:39,032
That's pretty weird.

408
00:42:20,978 --> 00:42:21,945
Oh, God!

409
00:42:51,774 --> 00:42:53,298
Hey, guys?

410
00:43:15,465 --> 00:43:16,489
Eric?

411
00:43:33,783 --> 00:43:35,011
No!

412
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:28,385
It's a 1992 red Volvo 740.

413
00:45:28,462 --> 00:45:30,589
740.

414
00:45:30,664 --> 00:45:34,464
0319 Larry John Robert.

415
00:45:34,535 --> 00:45:36,127
<i>Do you want us to pick him up?</i>

416
00:45:36,203 --> 00:45:38,000
No. Don't pick him up.

417
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:40,597
Just, just tell me where he is.

418
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:41,800
<i>Okay. We're here.</i>

419
00:45:41,876 --> 00:45:43,468
Okay? If someone spots him, let me know.

420
00:45:43,544 --> 00:45:44,738
<i>Okay, we'll call you.</i>

421
00:45:44,812 --> 00:45:46,507
<i>You have a nice day now, John.</i>

422
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:48,012
Okay, Hazel, I will. Thank you.

423
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:49,844
<i>You're welcome. Goodbye.</i>

424
00:47:00,385 --> 00:47:01,613
Eric!

425
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:20,764
Somebody had to do number 2.

426
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,136
Let's go.

427
00:47:25,978 --> 00:47:27,411
Those are probably dirty.

428
00:47:27,479 --> 00:47:30,209
You wouldn't say that if you had one.

429
00:47:30,282 --> 00:47:32,477
They're so fucking good.

430
00:47:34,353 --> 00:47:36,412
We should get on the road.

431
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:54,329
Wouldn't you love to go out on a boat?

432
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,506
I've never been on one.

433
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:01,472
I can't swim.

434
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:21,632
Why can't you swim?

435
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:26,633
Aren't parents supposed to
teach you stuff like that?

436
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:28,365
My mom can't swim, either.

437
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,580
I lied before.

438
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,409
When I said I was a virgin.

439
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,682
Maybe I am. I don't know.

440
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,527
Mom has always just--

441
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,130
been kind of a pervert magnet.

442
00:49:04,674 --> 00:49:07,336
I guess she still is.

443
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:13,315
Gary just seems nice because he's quiet
and he doesn't drink, and. . .

444
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,749
he acts pretty dad-like.

445
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,714
Mostly.

446
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:33,259
He took me on this camping trip.

447
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,472
Just the two of us.

448
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:40,306
The bonding weekend.

449
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:51,984
He said since I got wet,
that was a sign I wanted it.

450
00:51:24,512 --> 00:51:26,707
Lori, you can't just knock on someone's door

451
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:28,214
and ask for the bathroom.

452
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:33,347
Emergency! Hello!

453
00:51:33,421 --> 00:51:34,718
Lori.

454
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,750
Hello!

455
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:46,362
Wow. This is so cool.

456
00:51:47,568 --> 00:51:49,058
I wonder why they left.

457
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:50,934
We shouldn't be here.

458
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:52,302
Look.

459
00:51:53,407 --> 00:51:54,669
They took seven photos.

460
00:51:57,245 --> 00:51:59,440
We should get them developed
and see what happened to them.

461
00:51:59,514 --> 00:52:00,674
Here.

462
00:52:02,016 --> 00:52:04,347
What if these people
are, like, serial killers

463
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:08,080
and there are seven photos
of seven bodies in here and then us?

464
00:52:08,155 --> 00:52:10,487
So we get them developed,
and the cops arrest us

465
00:52:10,557 --> 00:52:12,650
and we seem totally guilty
because of your record and all.

466
00:52:12,726 --> 00:52:15,194
That would be freaky.
Let's get one together.

467
00:52:18,298 --> 00:52:20,163
Come on. Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

468
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:21,860
No. One sec. I got to freshen up.

469
00:52:28,074 --> 00:52:29,871
Holy shit. There's paper.

470
00:56:15,231 --> 00:56:17,096
Yes!

471
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,690
Yeah.

472
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,662
You want to roll one?

473
00:56:22,738 --> 00:56:24,797
No, thanks.

474
00:56:24,874 --> 00:56:26,671
Bowling isn't gay.

475
00:56:27,943 --> 00:56:30,241
I didn't say it was.

476
00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:32,644
I'm just trying
to show you a good time.

477
00:56:32,715 --> 00:56:34,615
I'm fun to have around.

478
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:39,245
Think of me as a dry run
for a real girlfriend,

479
00:56:39,321 --> 00:56:40,845
somebody important.

480
00:56:40,923 --> 00:56:42,322
Why do you say things like that?

481
00:56:42,391 --> 00:56:43,551
Like what?

482
00:56:43,626 --> 00:56:45,389
Like you want pity.

483
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,697
I don't want pity.

484
00:56:57,173 --> 00:56:58,731
Fuck!

485
00:57:00,476 --> 00:57:01,704
Shit.

486
00:57:01,777 --> 00:57:04,746
Okay. It's 11:30 in the morning.

487
00:57:04,814 --> 00:57:07,180
You can watch your language,
or you can leave.

488
00:57:07,249 --> 00:57:09,945
Hey! Can we get a couple of beers?

489
00:57:25,767 --> 00:57:27,792
So did you have a lot of friends?

490
00:57:29,804 --> 00:57:30,930
So no one visited?

491
00:57:31,005 --> 00:57:32,563
No.

492
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,606
This cop.

493
00:57:41,616 --> 00:57:43,208
He was a do-gooder.

494
00:57:43,284 --> 00:57:44,842
What do you mean?

495
00:57:46,187 --> 00:57:48,621
He was just too easy.

496
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,784
- Easy?
- Yeah.

497
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,124
Easy like most people are easy.

498
00:57:57,632 --> 00:58:01,363
Once he told me about his sick wife.

499
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,269
From then on, all I had to do
was bring her up,

500
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:06,307
and he'd go quiet.

501
00:58:06,374 --> 00:58:09,775
This one time, I called him a. . .

502
00:58:09,844 --> 00:58:13,143
a small beans cop
with a vegetable wife.

503
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:18,115
His eyes got all watery.

504
00:58:18,185 --> 00:58:21,552
But aren't most people like that, though?

505
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:24,921
What?

506
00:58:27,761 --> 00:58:31,026
Not easy, but soft?

507
00:58:32,633 --> 00:58:33,895
It's gross.

508
00:58:35,502 --> 00:58:37,299
What is?

509
00:58:37,371 --> 00:58:38,963
That stuff.

510
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:41,234
It's gross.

511
00:58:41,308 --> 00:58:42,866
What, people?

512
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,806
Isn't she soft?

513
00:58:47,881 --> 00:58:49,815
Who?

514
00:58:51,151 --> 00:58:54,052
The girl you never mention

515
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:55,452
because she doesn't really exist

516
00:58:55,522 --> 00:58:58,719
or we're not going anywhere near her
because she doesn't really exist.

517
00:59:01,094 --> 00:59:03,460
The one who's not named Maria.

518
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:11,094
Don't!

519
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:18,041
Eric!

520
00:59:19,346 --> 00:59:21,540
Eric, I'm sorry.

521
00:59:21,614 --> 00:59:23,206
I didn't mean to freak you out.

522
00:59:23,282 --> 00:59:24,749
I just--

523
00:59:24,817 --> 00:59:26,409
Eric, wait!

524
00:59:27,653 --> 00:59:29,484
I saw you kiss that girl.

525
00:59:35,428 --> 00:59:38,295
That day by the river.

526
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:43,401
I saw you kiss that girl.

527
00:59:48,641 --> 00:59:50,131
She was so--

528
00:59:51,544 --> 00:59:53,535
so beautiful.

529
00:59:59,952 --> 01:00:01,385
What girl, Lori?

530
01:00:03,422 --> 01:00:05,185
The one you were with.

531
01:00:08,327 --> 01:00:10,386
I wasn't spying.

532
01:00:11,564 --> 01:00:13,555
What are you talking about?

533
01:00:15,234 --> 01:00:18,431
Don't you even remember her?

534
01:03:11,607 --> 01:03:13,598
I thought you were shy.

535
01:03:20,416 --> 01:03:22,748
You're not shy.

536
01:03:53,415 --> 01:03:55,781
<i>I have a collect call from a Lori Cranston.</i>

537
01:03:55,851 --> 01:03:57,443
<i>Will you accept?</i>

538
01:03:57,519 --> 01:03:59,111
<i>Her mom's not here.</i>

539
01:03:59,187 --> 01:04:01,246
<i>I can talk to her,
but her mom's not here.</i>

540
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:05,317
Look, we should just get out of here,

541
01:04:05,393 --> 01:04:07,122
keep moving.

542
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:14,299
Thank you.

543
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:09,080
Are you the guy from Buffalo?

544
01:05:11,859 --> 01:05:12,883
Yeah.

545
01:05:14,094 --> 01:05:15,721
ls that a new flashlight?

546
01:05:15,796 --> 01:05:18,060
Yeah. Oh. Sorry, Lieutenant.

547
01:06:02,842 --> 01:06:05,208
You should check in for us.

548
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:26,560
<i>In the mind of this kid,
there's no violence,</i>

549
01:06:26,632 --> 01:06:29,533
<i>no other will, just a desire to take a life.</i>

550
01:06:31,204 --> 01:06:33,672
<i>Pleasure of feeling a body expire.</i>

551
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:37,699
<i>Feel its last beautiful sigh in his hands.</i>

552
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:43,014
<i>He's addicted to the intimacy of the kill--</i>

553
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:46,073
<i>the tenderness.</i>

554
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:49,279
So that's the kid they let out.

555
01:06:49,354 --> 01:06:50,286
Yeah.

556
01:06:50,355 --> 01:06:52,118
Not the Buffalo I used to know.

557
01:06:53,225 --> 01:06:54,749
And they sent you?

558
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:59,395
Well, no, not exactly.

559
01:06:59,464 --> 01:07:01,056
I'm pretty much retired.

560
01:07:01,133 --> 01:07:02,794
They just give me the easy cases.

561
01:07:02,868 --> 01:07:04,529
You chasing after this kid?

562
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,037
Kind of.

563
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,571
Alone?

564
01:07:12,244 --> 01:07:14,508
Well, I got no family. He's my hobby.

565
01:07:34,399 --> 01:07:36,333
ls it because I'm a freak?

566
01:07:37,369 --> 01:07:39,166
You're not a freak.

567
01:07:40,205 --> 01:07:43,037
You've said it before.

568
01:07:43,107 --> 01:07:47,339
You listen too closely
to every little thing people say.

569
01:07:47,411 --> 01:07:50,005
You remember stuff you should forget.

570
01:07:52,316 --> 01:07:54,307
You could do things to me--

571
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:57,612
things you want. . .

572
01:07:59,824 --> 01:08:01,917
things you can't say.

573
01:08:01,992 --> 01:08:05,155
Doesn't work like that, Lori.

574
01:08:05,229 --> 01:08:07,595
That day by the river. . .

575
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,491
there was something. . .

576
01:08:13,337 --> 01:08:15,100
so. . .

577
01:08:15,172 --> 01:08:18,369
perfect in that kiss.

578
01:08:18,442 --> 01:08:22,208
Lori, I never kissed anybody.

579
01:08:23,614 --> 01:08:25,047
Yes, you did.

580
01:08:25,116 --> 01:08:27,949
Not really.

581
01:08:34,358 --> 01:08:36,792
Not like you think.

582
01:08:54,611 --> 01:08:56,602
Let's go inside, Lori.

583
01:09:37,654 --> 01:09:39,986
Just stay quiet.

584
01:09:43,193 --> 01:09:45,457
Use your hands.

585
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:51,396
It's what I want.

586
01:10:01,476 --> 01:10:02,966
Do it.

587
01:10:04,513 --> 01:10:07,505
Dissolve me.

588
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:10,040
Do it.

589
01:10:36,545 --> 01:10:38,206
I love you.

590
01:11:00,835 --> 01:11:02,769
<i>Welcome to FunLand.</i>

591
01:11:02,837 --> 01:11:04,429
<i>That's right. Welcome to FunLand.</i>

592
01:11:04,505 --> 01:11:08,032
<i>Hey, kids, what's crazier
than a barrel of monkeys?</i>

593
01:11:08,109 --> 01:11:10,543
<i>It's the Crazy Submarine ride. Now open.</i>

594
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:14,206
<i>But you must be this tall
to get on the Crazy Submarine ride.</i>

595
01:11:16,717 --> 01:11:18,742
Balloons! Come on, kids!

596
01:11:18,819 --> 01:11:21,788
2 bucks!
Tell Mommy you want a balloon!

597
01:11:21,856 --> 01:11:24,882
<i>Folks, there's no line
at the Sky Sweep right now.</i>

598
01:11:43,477 --> 01:11:45,069
<i>. . . by the Ferris wheel.</i>

599
01:11:45,146 --> 01:11:48,377
<i>Good afternoon, everybody.
Welcome to FunLand.</i>

600
01:11:48,449 --> 01:11:52,010
<i>Please enjoy yourselves today
and tell all your friends.</i>

601
01:11:52,086 --> 01:11:53,052
Hey!

602
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:55,212
Hey, Maria.

603
01:11:57,924 --> 01:11:59,448
Sorry I'm late.

604
01:11:59,526 --> 01:12:01,824
I had to sneak away from my mom.

605
01:12:03,763 --> 01:12:05,731
It's pretty lame here.

606
01:12:05,799 --> 01:12:07,960
No, it's cool.

607
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,002
I didn't come here for the rides.

608
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:11,697
Should we walk around?

609
01:12:11,771 --> 01:12:13,204
Yeah. Great.

610
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:25,418
Now boarding, the Dragon Coach.

611
01:12:26,586 --> 01:12:29,384
So do you want to go on a ride?

612
01:12:29,456 --> 01:12:30,718
Yeah, I guess.

613
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:32,223
I like the kiddie ones.

614
01:12:32,292 --> 01:12:34,590
Yeah, me, too.

615
01:12:42,702 --> 01:12:44,567
Hey, wait up, bro!

616
01:12:45,905 --> 01:12:47,634
Hi.

617
01:12:47,707 --> 01:12:50,232
Are you from in town?

618
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:51,299
No.

619
01:12:54,547 --> 01:12:57,014
I should keep you company.

620
01:12:57,082 --> 01:12:58,276
You know?

621
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:00,181
So guys don't hit on you.

622
01:13:03,322 --> 01:13:05,222
I'm 15.

623
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,893
So did you grow up around here?

624
01:13:16,969 --> 01:13:18,095
Kind of.

625
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:19,467
I mean--

626
01:13:19,538 --> 01:13:21,665
It's a long story.

627
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:23,970
Tell me.

628
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:27,239
We move a lot-- my folks and me.

629
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:33,878
That was fun.

630
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:36,147
<i>All right. Everybody off.</i>

631
01:13:36,221 --> 01:13:38,815
<i>That's it. Off to your right.</i>

632
01:13:38,891 --> 01:13:40,324
<i>Follow the railing.</i>

633
01:13:40,392 --> 01:13:42,223
<i>Right there.</i>

634
01:13:44,363 --> 01:13:47,594
<i>You must stay on the other
side of the yellow line.</i>

635
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:51,033
<i>Please don't put yourself
or anybody else in danger.</i>

636
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,037
So do you want to go on another ride?

637
01:13:53,105 --> 01:13:54,732
We don't have to.

638
01:13:58,876 --> 01:14:01,106
What do you want to do?

639
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,613
Be alone.

640
01:14:06,117 --> 01:14:07,846
I know a place.

641
01:14:11,088 --> 01:14:12,715
<i>Follow the railing around.</i>

642
01:14:17,195 --> 01:14:20,858
<i>Keep your hands
inside the ride at all times.</i>

643
01:14:20,932 --> 01:14:22,422
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

644
01:14:53,331 --> 01:14:54,923
How about over there?

645
01:14:54,999 --> 01:14:56,762
I like it here.

646
01:15:01,204 --> 01:15:02,865
<i>Stop spacing out.</i>

647
01:15:02,939 --> 01:15:04,998
<i>Oh, man!</i>

648
01:15:06,476 --> 01:15:07,966
<i>Crazy!</i>

649
01:15:17,921 --> 01:15:19,582
That's really pretty.

650
01:15:21,191 --> 01:15:22,658
Yeah.

651
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:25,661
<i>Here we go, bro. Hands up.</i>

652
01:15:27,697 --> 01:15:29,096
Here we go!

653
01:15:29,165 --> 01:15:31,725
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

654
01:16:08,137 --> 01:16:10,367
Eric!

655
01:16:13,943 --> 01:16:17,003
<i>God! Oh, my God!</i>

656
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,048
Eric!

657
01:16:29,458 --> 01:16:32,791
Stop! Let me off!

658
01:16:44,206 --> 01:16:46,766
Get me the fuck out of this thing!

659
01:17:04,326 --> 01:17:06,350
ls she your girlfriend?

660
01:17:06,427 --> 01:17:08,486
Get away from him! She's a liar!

661
01:17:08,563 --> 01:17:12,055
Get the fuck away from him!
She's lying to you! She's a liar!

662
01:17:12,133 --> 01:17:13,794
- It's a trap!
- Lori, you're crazy!

663
01:17:13,868 --> 01:17:14,960
Get the fuck away from him!

664
01:17:15,036 --> 01:17:16,867
- Lori! Lori!
- Get away from me!

665
01:17:16,938 --> 01:17:18,838
Why would you come here?
Why would you follow me here?

666
01:17:18,906 --> 01:17:20,498
We can see you!

667
01:17:20,575 --> 01:17:22,668
- Why would you come here?
- Come out, you fuckers!

668
01:17:22,744 --> 01:17:24,712
- Lori!
- Look! Look!

669
01:17:38,126 --> 01:17:40,458
Cristofuoro?

670
01:17:47,769 --> 01:17:49,760
No? Come on. Let's go.

671
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:51,828
Stay where you are, Eric.
Stay where you are.

672
01:17:51,906 --> 01:17:53,430
Step away from each other.
Step away!

673
01:17:53,508 --> 01:17:56,739
- No, you cannot do this to me!
- Shut up! Put your hands on your head.

674
01:17:56,811 --> 01:17:58,438
You cannot detain me!
You can't do this--

675
01:17:58,513 --> 01:18:00,845
Put your hands on your head!
Kneel down now! Both of you!

676
01:18:02,517 --> 01:18:04,007
Kneel.

677
01:18:08,588 --> 01:18:10,419
Who the fuck are you?

678
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:14,554
Lorelei Jane Cranston.

679
01:18:14,628 --> 01:18:16,994
- How old are you?
- 16.

680
01:18:17,064 --> 01:18:19,362
I have my parents' permission to be here.

681
01:18:23,804 --> 01:18:27,001
Eric, with your left hand,
empty your pockets.

682
01:18:27,074 --> 01:18:28,735
Slowly.

683
01:18:35,015 --> 01:18:36,676
Both pockets.

684
01:18:39,586 --> 01:18:41,520
You can't detain me.

685
01:18:43,957 --> 01:18:45,891
No, you're right. I can't.

686
01:18:45,959 --> 01:18:47,790
But I can detain her.

687
01:18:47,861 --> 01:18:49,761
Nothing was going to happen.

688
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:50,797
Yeah?

689
01:18:50,864 --> 01:18:52,695
What were you doing?

690
01:18:52,766 --> 01:18:55,257
I know what you were doing.
You were trying to entrap me!

691
01:18:55,335 --> 01:18:57,633
You were trying to entrap me.

692
01:18:57,704 --> 01:19:00,764
Stand. Drop your hands.

693
01:19:00,841 --> 01:19:03,605
From you, I'm going
to need a phone number. Come with me.

694
01:19:05,645 --> 01:19:07,476
Stand up, pal.

695
01:19:12,284 --> 01:19:16,015
<i>Well, can you get her mother to call me?</i>

696
01:19:16,088 --> 01:19:17,817
<i>When she can.</i>

697
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:19,517
<i>You do that.</i>

698
01:19:19,592 --> 01:19:22,425
<i>Get a statement from Eric
before we let him go.</i>

699
01:19:22,495 --> 01:19:24,486
<i>Great. Wait up.</i>

700
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:33,399
You get Gary?

701
01:19:33,472 --> 01:19:35,497
Yeah.

702
01:19:37,243 --> 01:19:39,211
Surprise, surprise.

703
01:19:42,281 --> 01:19:44,272
Do you know who this kid is?

704
01:19:45,918 --> 01:19:49,319
Do you have any idea what he's done?

705
01:19:49,388 --> 01:19:52,323
He is not someone you can trust.
You understand?

706
01:19:53,325 --> 01:19:55,020
Eric says you're a liar.

707
01:20:01,033 --> 01:20:03,695
I have to let you go.

708
01:20:03,769 --> 01:20:06,795
But when I do, if you stay with him,

709
01:20:06,872 --> 01:20:10,364
there is nothing I can do to protect you.

710
01:20:10,442 --> 01:20:13,376
I can't even have you followed.

711
01:20:13,444 --> 01:20:17,778
So before that happens,
you're going to hear me out.

712
01:20:17,849 --> 01:20:19,646
That kid is a killer.

713
01:20:19,717 --> 01:20:21,878
I know that.

714
01:20:23,454 --> 01:20:25,251
Everyone knows about his parents.

715
01:20:25,323 --> 01:20:27,086
I'm with him because I want to be.

716
01:20:27,158 --> 01:20:28,785
Not just his parents.

717
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:32,023
He only killed them
because they'd found out what he'd done.

718
01:20:32,096 --> 01:20:33,859
I could show you photographs of a girl--

719
01:20:33,932 --> 01:20:35,559
Alicia Vargas.

720
01:20:35,633 --> 01:20:38,067
A girl just like you.

721
01:20:38,136 --> 01:20:40,070
She was breathing
and laughing and watching TV

722
01:20:40,138 --> 01:20:43,369
and thinking she might like a boyfriend,
and now she's dead--

723
01:20:43,441 --> 01:20:46,103
in the ground, cold and dead.

724
01:20:46,177 --> 01:20:47,610
And there was another girl.

725
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:49,442
She went missing around the same time.

726
01:20:49,514 --> 01:20:51,414
Sophia Tersa.

727
01:20:51,482 --> 01:20:56,249
My guess is when we find her body,
we'll find she went just the same way.

728
01:20:56,321 --> 01:20:59,313
Lorelei, Eric liked Alicia and Sophia.

729
01:21:01,092 --> 01:21:04,425
Just the same way I'm sure he likes you.

730
01:21:04,495 --> 01:21:08,261
He doesn't like me like me.

731
01:21:16,473 --> 01:21:18,304
We're just friends.

732
01:21:20,143 --> 01:21:22,907
If you're just friends, what did he tell you
he was doing with Maria?

733
01:21:25,816 --> 01:21:27,750
What? Did he say he wasn't
going to hurt her?

734
01:21:27,818 --> 01:21:30,150
Just hook up with her?

735
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:35,783
I know that bothers you.

736
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:39,290
It's my choice.

737
01:21:45,235 --> 01:21:48,068
And I'm just trying
to help you make a good one.

738
01:21:50,574 --> 01:21:52,804
He told me about you.

739
01:21:56,747 --> 01:21:59,147
Told me all about you and your sick wife.

740
01:22:04,087 --> 01:22:07,648
You're just a small beans cop
with a vegetable wife.

741
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:25,336
<i>Here you go, Mac.</i>

742
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:27,968
<i>He's done, fellas. He's going home.</i>

743
01:22:35,885 --> 01:22:37,580
Good work tonight.

744
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:39,553
When do I get to go home?

745
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:41,647
Just a couple more minutes,
and I'll give you a ride home.

746
01:22:41,724 --> 01:22:43,885
What do you want to do now, John?

747
01:22:45,161 --> 01:22:47,095
I'm going home.

748
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,615
Lori.

749
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,091
I'm sorry.

750
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:22,754
I didn't. . .

751
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,822
You don't owe me anything.

752
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:22,389
I was wrong.

753
01:24:25,692 --> 01:24:28,024
You do owe me something.

754
01:25:33,259 --> 01:25:35,819
It's cooler out here
than I thought it would be.

755
01:25:48,007 --> 01:25:50,567
Mmm. Pretty much dead.

756
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,548
You know what I smell now?

757
01:26:10,963 --> 01:26:12,726
Lake.

758
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,808
Tell me I'm pretty, Eric.

759
01:26:25,945 --> 01:26:27,879
You are pretty.

760
01:26:28,915 --> 01:26:30,404
Yeah.

761
01:26:33,451 --> 01:26:35,976
But I'm breathing.

762
01:26:46,665 --> 01:26:48,656
My mom has this tape.

763
01:26:51,102 --> 01:26:53,730
And basically,
it's just this guy screaming

764
01:26:53,805 --> 01:26:57,366
over and over,
''You have to want change,

765
01:26:57,442 --> 01:26:59,876
you have to want change. ''

766
01:27:03,615 --> 01:27:05,674
Nothing changes.

767
01:27:13,191 --> 01:27:16,319
Nothing changes.

768
01:27:23,068 --> 01:27:24,729
Nothing changes!

769
01:27:26,271 --> 01:27:28,796
Nothing changes!

770
01:27:38,015 --> 01:27:39,676
What are you doing?

771
01:27:41,952 --> 01:27:43,283
Lori!

772
01:27:46,323 --> 01:27:48,018
Stop!

773
01:27:48,092 --> 01:27:50,287
Stop.

774
01:27:50,361 --> 01:27:51,487
Lori, stop!

775
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:53,956
Fuck you!

776
01:28:03,974 --> 01:28:05,908
No!

777
01:28:05,976 --> 01:28:08,672
Lori, give me your hand!

778
01:28:08,746 --> 01:28:10,873
Give me your hand! Come here!
Give me your hand!

779
01:28:13,951 --> 01:28:15,816
Lori!

780
01:28:15,886 --> 01:28:17,251
Take it!

781
01:28:17,321 --> 01:28:19,687
Come on. Please, grab it!

782
01:28:19,757 --> 01:28:21,281
Grab it, please!

783
01:28:35,438 --> 01:28:38,236
Lori!

784
01:29:20,717 --> 01:29:23,185
Lori!

785
01:31:00,047 --> 01:31:03,107
That's it.

786
01:31:03,184 --> 01:31:05,948
She just fell in.

787
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:11,148
And I tried to save her.

788
01:31:11,225 --> 01:31:14,023
I didn't kill her, Lieutenant.

789
01:31:16,831 --> 01:31:18,992
No, I know you didn't.

790
01:31:22,403 --> 01:31:26,703
I should get off this bus
and talk to the D.A. on your behalf.

791
01:31:32,746 --> 01:31:34,680
Here's the thing.

792
01:31:36,484 --> 01:31:38,475
You do belong here, Eric.

793
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:53,223
I say we take this any way it comes.

794
01:32:09,549 --> 01:32:12,313
My wife wanted to say hi.

795
01:32:15,889 --> 01:32:19,154
She wanted me to tell you
she's not paralyzed.

796
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:22,654
She might be fucked,
but she ain't no vegetable.

797
01:33:54,619 --> 01:33:57,918
<i>My wife likes to say
there are two kinds of people.</i>

798
01:33:59,357 --> 01:34:01,587
<i>Those chasing pleasure. . .</i>

799
01:34:03,294 --> 01:34:05,888
<i>and those running from pain.</i>

800
01:34:24,148 --> 01:34:25,979
<i>Maybe she's right.</i>

801
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:29,580
<i>I don't know.</i>

802
01:34:29,655 --> 01:34:32,620
<i>What I do know is this.</i>

803
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:38,250
<i>Pleasure helps you forget.</i>

804
01:34:41,065 --> 01:34:43,000
<i>But pain--</i>

805
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:48,960
<i>pain forces you to hope.</i>

806
01:34:52,275 --> 01:34:54,505
<i>You tell yourself</i>

807
01:34:56,745 --> 01:34:58,905
<i>''This can't last. ''</i>

808
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:08,750
<i>''Today could be different. ''</i>

809
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:21,400
<i>''Today. . .</i>

810
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:23,530
<i>something just might change. ''</i>
