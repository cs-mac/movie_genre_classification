1
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:21,164
SPANISH AFFAIR

2
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,369
You want anything?

3
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,996
<i>I need a kalimotxo to put up with this.</i>

4
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,956
You're not in Euskadi, Amaia.

5
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,375
You don't say! Really?

6
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,877
I was so sure we were in Hernani.

7
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,046
Come on, let's try to have some fun.

8
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,589
You could've taken me to Donosti,

9
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,050
with a stripper and a dick on my head.

10
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,428
"Have some fun", the way I love Andalusians and hair gel.

11
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,430
That was the joke about the hen party.

12
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,265
What do we call this now?

13
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,601
It isn't a hen party any more.

14
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,395
So, what is it?

15
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,064
You should know, you dragged me here

16
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,399
and dressed me like a halfwit.

17
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,234
Why let Antxon ruin the trip too?

18
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,819
<i>You want kalimotxo or not'?</i>

19
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,654
<i>I can't take this rebujete.</i>

20
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,823
Well, you've had six or seven.

21
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,449
Are you keeping score?

22
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,162
What a wonder and what a delight.

23
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,623
Hurrah for fino, manzanilla and beautiful girls.

24
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,918
They must have left Heaven's gates open,

25
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,628
- because I see...
- Some angels?

26
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,630
I hope one is a guardian angel

27
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,633
because I would really love to slap you hard...

28
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:38,844
What?

29
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,471
You can't treat everyone like that because of Antxon.

30
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,099
We said we wouldn't talk about him.

31
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,976
What fantastic women, Joaquin.

32
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,978
Those three, Currito? Forget it.

33
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,646
Why? Boyfriends? Even better.

34
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,481
- Worse!
- Worse? Dykes?

35
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,524
- Worse!
- Worse?

36
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,317
They must be Basque.

37
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,279
One moment, please.

38
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,823
Can we have some silence? Sit down, please.

39
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,326
I'm being asked to tell some jokes, as only I can

40
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:07,038
and all I want is to put a smile
on the faces of these women.

41
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:11,001
You're the prettiest in Andalusia.
Ole, ole and ole!

42
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,170
Here's the first one.

43
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,963
These two Basques meet

44
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,673
and one says: "Hey, Patxi,

45
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,217
I hear your daughter's in bed
with gonorrhoea."

46
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,179
The other says: "I don't care!
As long as he's Basque..."

47
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,724
No, don't clap, you'll break my rhythm.

48
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,144
I shouldn't say it,
but I'm really nailing the Basque accent.

49
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,730
Another one. These two from Bilbao meet,

50
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:32,689
and one says:

51
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:36,568
"Kepa, I hear you won
100 million on the lottery."

52
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,820
The other says: "Just what I bet".

53
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,579
Very funny jokes. Really shit hot.

54
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,040
You're such a wit. You have such flair here.

55
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,334
But I think that, to give us a real laugh,

56
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,419
you should go fuck yourself.

57
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,546
Have some respect, eh?

58
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,256
You may be from the Basque Provinces...

59
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,592
Yeah, from the fucking Gonorrhoea family!

60
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,929
The Basque Provinces!
The ignorance of these people.

61
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,055
Bunch of layabouts!

62
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,224
You only get up from the siesta to go partying.

63
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,517
What?

64
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,269
Why don't you go home and lift some stones

65
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,896
or whatever you Basques do to relax?

66
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,231
- You seem...
- What?

67
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,941
...a bit tense. The fun's over.

68
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,901
Don't touch me, dago, I'll report you!

69
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,737
Gora Euskadi, fuck you all! Don't touch me!

70
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,031
You're going out on the street and get an earful!

71
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:24,908
Wait a minute...

72
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,244
- My friends are there!
- I don't care.

73
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,413
No! Don't...! No! Hey!

74
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,253
- Let go of me!
- You've got no business here.

75
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,587
Take it easy, eh?

76
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,923
Go on, get out! And don't come back!

77
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,133
Don't worry, I'll never be back in Seville.

78
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,600
- Are you looking at my ass?
- Why would I look at your ass?

79
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,102
You were looking at it.

80
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,646
You should be so lucky that I'd like you.

81
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,107
You'll like me if I say so!

82
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,268
Come on.

83
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,763
Hey, Rafa, where were you?

84
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,099
I knew you were with the Basque girl,

85
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,601
or I'd have thought you'd hit on someone else.

86
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,023
- Did you screw her?
- No, no, but it doesn't count.

87
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:43,815
We just slept.

88
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:44,858
Why doesn't it count?

89
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,444
Sleeping with a Basque is like
screwing a girl from Mélaga three times.

90
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,697
I'll make supper for you another day, OK?

91
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,743
- You brought her home?
- Yes.

92
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,911
Are you crazy? Why did you do that?

93
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,621
She could be an ETA terrorist!

94
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,915
An ETA terrorist? Are you nuts?

95
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,375
Wasn't she wearing flounces?

96
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,626
How else would she come here?

97
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,962
With a balaclava and a Basque flag?

98
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,756
I'll tell you something.

99
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,258
I bet she's looking for a "show house" in Seville.

100
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,303
- Don't you mean a "safe house"?
- Not with her in it!

101
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,804
Don't give her any bottles.

102
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,641
That lot make Molotov cocktails in a nanosecond.

103
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,477
You're out of your mind.

104
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,897
Shit, you left the door open.

105
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,440
I don't want her to remember my face.

106
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,983
I closed it.

107
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,323
You bastard! I believed you!

108
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,824
"The Dude"...

109
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,786
I knew it was impossible to make out with a Basque.

110
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,496
She was here a minute ago.

111
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,834
For fuck's sake, Rafa! For fuck's sake!

112
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,339
Careful, there might be a bomb in there.

113
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,595
Are you sure this is a woman's purse?

114
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,139
There's no lipstick or mascara or anything.

115
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,599
Basque women don't wear make-up.

116
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,434
Joaquin, you saw her,

117
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,353
she could be Miss Euskadi.

118
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,271
Miss Euskadi? They don't have that.

119
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,649
Go on, tell him. Listen to this, Currito.

120
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,110
I want to give it back.

121
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,319
To the police?

122
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,695
No, to her.

123
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,949
Didn't you say that she's back in her village now?

124
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,700
Yes, well, there.

125
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,495
Are you crazy? You've never left Andalusia.

126
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,834
Shit, I've... I've fallen in love.

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,877
How could you fall in love with a Basque?

128
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,379
You've never been in love!

129
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,631
What do you two know? All I know is that

130
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,716
there's unfinished business between us.

131
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,968
You're unfinished business.

132
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,303
Take that thing and erase our details.

133
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,805
I bet she put us in there.

134
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,182
You have to check the numbers on the mobile

135
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,308
before you head off.

136
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,977
No, don't call, the battery's almost dead.

137
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,689
"Aita, Aita". "Aita" is something.

138
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,860
Pedrito, "aita" is something in their language, right?

139
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,363
"Aita" is "Father".
Like in "father and mother".

140
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,239
Pedro...

141
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,075
I'm waiting to see if she calls.
The battery's low.

142
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,203
Shut up, it's ringing.

143
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,582
It's dead.

144
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,212
You three are a great help. Thanks a lot.

145
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,589
Don't take your car.

146
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,092
I did my military service in Irún and mine was scratched 4 or 5 times.

147
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,012
The Basques love that. It's a custom.

148
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,098
I think it's a lot quieter up there now.

149
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,601
Another one who believes in that trick treaty.

150
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,937
The Basques can't stand the sight of Andalusians.

151
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,356
They're taught that in baby Basque school.

152
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,066
That and making Molotov cocktails.

153
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,611
Take two days, Rafa, and you'll forget her.

154
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,237
That's right.

155
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,781
That's just what I need: two days.

156
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,118
It'll take me two clays to bring her to Seville.

157
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,206
Plus, it isn't her fault she's Basque.

158
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,461
You're letting him go?
Grab him, you're strong.

159
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,880
I've known him since he was a kid.

160
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,049
He's incapable of going to the Basque Provinces.

161
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,820
"BASQUE WITHOUT FEAR"

162
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,928
<i>The Basques can't stand the sight of Andalusians.</i>

163
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,180
<i>Not even the sight of us!</i>

164
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,834
WELCOME TO THE BASQUE COUNTRY

165
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,296
JOAQUIN
MOBILE NUMBER

166
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,679
THURSDAY 6 JUNE
REAL BETIS FOOTBALL CLUB

167
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,772
Where are you from?

168
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,233
Who, me?
Where do you...

169
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,943
I'm Basque, from here.

170
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,239
Not from here specifically, but I'm Basque.

171
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,367
<i>Aupa. Agur.</i>

172
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,785
Yeah.

173
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,204
What are you? Andalusian?

174
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,791
Hey, watch it, I didn't insult you.

175
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,293
Calm down, I'm from Céceres.

176
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,462
Are you from Cérdoba?

177
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,298
How could I possibly be from Cérdoba?

178
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:48,388
I'm Basque. But if I was Andalusian,
I'd be Sevillian, not Cordoban.

179
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,147
I'm Sevillian, from Santa Cruz.

180
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,651
I was at the Expo with my husband.

181
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,153
- Wasn't the Polish pavilion lovely?
- Yes, it was.

182
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,657
I was dying to meet someone here who wasn't from Argoitia.

183
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,410
Come to the house one day and I'll make "migas".

184
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,828
Mine are delicious.

185
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,830
I've got a question.

186
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,292
Where is this street? "Gasteiz".

187
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,504
You have to get out in two stops.

188
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,676
Have you come here for this girl?

189
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,470
No, I'm just visiting for a few days.

190
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,639
Right. So, you're in love.

191
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,850
Head over heels.

192
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,190
Too bad, we've arrived just when we're getting acquainted.

193
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,359
Will you come to my house tomorrow?

194
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,652
Look, that's it.

195
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,366
The truth is, I'm only here for a few days.

196
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,035
That's what I said too.

197
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,374
I'll be waiting for you
with the "migas". Goodbye.

198
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,877
Goodbye, love.

199
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,295
Agur, blondie.

200
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,881
LEAVE THE BASQUE COUNTRY IN PEACE

201
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,119
Amaia?

202
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,914
Yes, come in, I'm in the kitchen.

203
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,126
Amaia?

204
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,880
Amaia, what are you doing?

205
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,798
It's me.

206
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,802
You must be... Don't say anything.

207
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,805
Look, I know it's kind of crazy,

208
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,099
but one of us had to do it, right?

209
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,101
What happened to your hair?

210
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,311
Never mind. You weren't
expecting this, were you?

211
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,314
Or maybe you were. Maybe you did expect it

212
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,651
because ours wasn't a one-night stand that...

213
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,778
Well, not you, you're Basque, but me?

214
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,822
It wasn't "Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am".

215
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,783
I mean, take that as a manner of speaking.

216
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,660
When I said not to interrupt me

217
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,453
it was so I could gather momentum,

218
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,747
but you can do it now, if you want.

219
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,332
Hang on, you are...?

220
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,001
Sorry, I don't remember your name.

221
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,752
What do... What a joker.

222
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,589
You Basques might be great at some things,

223
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,340
but you can't tell jokes.

224
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,009
"You are...?", she says.

225
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,844
I know you're the Sevillian.

226
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:19,015
I really don't like this tough nut role you're playing.

227
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,433
Well, "I don't like"...

228
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,226
It's turning me on, a lot.

229
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,853
It's turning both of us on.

230
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,187
Speak for yourself.

231
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,106
Let's be serious. I've come to get you.

232
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,399
What for?

233
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,442
"What for?"

234
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,278
You don't have to stay in the Basque Provinces.

235
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,405
- I can take you away.
- "The Basque Provinces"?

236
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,949
To Seville, the two of us, together.

237
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,619
And you can wear your hair like a normal person there.

238
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,871
Excuse me?

239
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,539
<i>You want me to ca" the Ertzaintza?</i>

240
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,542
I thought we'd be on our own for a while,

241
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,252
but call your friend if you want.

242
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,879
That's it, the joke's over.

243
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,714
I've got no time for this. Get out.

244
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,466
- Amaia, how can I go now?
- What do you want?

245
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,384
Apart from... there's something else.

246
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,095
You look very odd.

247
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,764
Have you been picking grapes?

248
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,223
Have you seen yourself?

249
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,225
That's enough. Don't keep on.

250
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,646
Look, I understand you, I really do,

251
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,273
after your bad experience with Antxon,

252
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,983
but not all men are the same.

253
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,070
What? Have you been looking at my phone?

254
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,571
Me?

255
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,947
Yes... Well, a bit,

256
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,075
just a quick "look-see".

257
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,409
I'll "look-see" you with my fist!

258
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,787
Amaia, that Antxon was something else.

259
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,122
The debt he left you in over the wedding.

260
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,083
He's got no shame and no manners.

261
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,417
That's enough, get out!

262
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,295
Hey, I'll start thinking you don't want me, baby.

263
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,297
Baby? I'm not your fucking baby!

264
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,925
Give me a few days.

265
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,844
I know you're confused, you fell in love so quickly,

266
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,846
but, shit, give me a weekend

267
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,932
and you'll never want me to leave you.

268
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,047
No, no, no! Oh, sweet virgin!

269
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,968
Fucking hell!

270
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,190
<i>What are you doing?</i>

271
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,192
<i>Call the fire brigade.</i>

272
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,988
<i>Fight, erentxu, erentxu, me too, eh'?</i>

273
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,406
Gora, and independence!

274
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,827
Why are you running off? I'm one of yours.

275
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,496
I was going to burn some Spanish ATMs.

276
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:48,998
Halt!

277
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:49,999
Don't move!

278
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:51,834
It wasn't me.

279
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:59,008
So, stirring things up for the demonstration tomorrow?

280
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,677
I didn't even know there was one tomorrow.

281
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,181
Just when it's quiet here,
we get the Andalusian kale borroka.

282
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,017
Did you call that number I gave you?

283
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,852
She says she doesn't know you.

284
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,687
She really is acting tough.

285
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,689
That's typical of Basque girls.

286
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,401
That, and looking like they cut
their fringe with an axe, right?

287
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,988
Are you new, or what?

288
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,709
And don't give us any trouble.

289
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,420
I'm Sevillian, don't you understand?

290
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,714
I don't belong to that "galleyborroca".

291
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,219
<i>Alma!</i>

292
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,895
It didn't work.

293
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,939
The Seville thing, I mean.

294
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,483
Despite the camouflage and the accent.

295
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,735
I'll have to practice more,

296
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,737
they didn't believe it for a minute.

297
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:06,242
But... look... are you serious?

298
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,078
Yes, yes. I don't know. About what?

299
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,247
Did you burn a container?

300
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,790
Fucking right!

301
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,583
And a big one!

302
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,627
I say that in street fighting

303
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,295
you have to take another step.

304
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,255
Sure!

305
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,131
Who are you?

306
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,091
Me?

307
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,760
Ifiaki.

308
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,514
"Machine gun" Ifiaki.

309
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,932
"Machine gun"?

310
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,477
- I don't know the name.
- Neither do I.

311
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,981
Are you in a terrorist cell or...?

312
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,943
Well, I could be. I mean, yes, I am.

313
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,111
Which one?

314
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,322
G cell.

315
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,288
JG-uipﬂzcoa"!
- Right.

316
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,456
Maybe you don't know my name because

317
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,500
the leaders always had me silenced.

318
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,961
But they're not going to shut me up now.

319
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,798
Hey, we spoke to the girl again.

320
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,971
I knew if you insisted a bit she'd give way.

321
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,639
What did she say?

322
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,183
She wants nothing to do with you.

323
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,867
Look at it.

324
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,660
It's new.

325
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,329
But it's made to measure.

326
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,331
Half, 1,000 euros.

327
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,832
What do I do with it?

328
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,375
500.

329
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,710
Shit, at least the material.

330
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,670
There are bits you can use

331
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,422
for some other idiot who wants to get married.

332
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,007
- 200...
- Amaia!

333
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,177
I'm very sorry, really, and I understand you...

334
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,345
What do you understand?

335
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,182
You know what people are like.

336
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,101
They say Antxon left you with debts...

337
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,270
I'm sorry, really.

338
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,273
You were such a nice couple.

339
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,777
Nice couple, my ass!

340
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,366
- Aita?
- Amaia.

341
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,744
You don't know how happy you made me.

342
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,245
What happened?

343
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,874
<i>I wanted to answer your call, but it cut out.</i>

344
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,709
<i>When you rang, I was on the boat.</i>

345
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,753
Is something wrong with your phone?

346
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,421
Well, no matter.

347
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,883
Listen, you don't know how happy I was

348
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,417
that you're calling again.

349
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,929
Hang on, hang on. Stop, wait, wait.

350
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,473
<i>Yes, it's best to discuss these things in person.</i>

351
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,808
What? Are you coming here?

352
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,727
That's why I rang. I've just come into port.

353
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:39,979
What?

354
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,444
Amaia! Amaia!

355
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,781
For fuck's sake, it's cut out again.

356
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,033
<i>- Aupa.
- Aupa.</i>

357
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,121
A fucking long voyage!

358
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,040
I worked the "Sabino" hard, eh?

359
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,292
But she behaved well, very well.

360
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,712
And here? Drizzling?

361
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,714
It's rained all week, yes.

362
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,382
Yes?

363
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,510
So... that's that.

364
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,305
You're the same.

365
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,640
I can't be.

366
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,143
I always remembered your birthday.

367
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,895
But I never called you,

368
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,230
you might have felt uncomfortable.

369
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,900
The first year, dammit,

370
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,860
I had the phone in my hand.

371
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,820
10th of April, 10th of April.

372
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,197
13th of October.

373
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,033
Right, 13th of October, exactly. Well said.

374
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,037
Well, now that it seems

375
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,748
we're back in touch, if you like, I'll call you.

376
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,583
October, then, the 13th.

377
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,835
Good, good.

378
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,546
And you never found anything?

379
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,508
No, no... Well, I didn't finish my degree.

380
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,344
I think there's a mix-up...

381
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,261
I knew it!

382
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,847
I knew you wouldn't call me for something stupid.

383
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,226
I was thinking about it.
I'm going to be a grandfather...

384
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,229
No, no. Look, wait. Hang on a minute.

385
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,563
I've waited long enough.

386
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,857
Look, Amaia, for me this is...

387
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,235
You don't know what it is for a father.

388
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,529
Fucking hell!

389
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,077
I don't think you understand.

390
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,453
There's nothing to understand.

391
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,413
That's how things are, end of story.

392
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,457
We've had our problems? OK.

393
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,376
But, at times, an aita has to be there

394
00:27:07,518 --> 00:27:08,685
and pay for his daughter's wedding.

395
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,611
What's there to understand?

396
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,922
You don't have to pay for anything.

397
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,882
Fr. Inaxio has to marry you. He baptized you.

398
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,384
And he says a nice mass.

399
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,927
Look, you've just arrived,

400
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,555
you can't go interfering with the wedding...

401
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,724
It's all organised, and I don't know if you should come.

402
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,893
OK, all right, all right.

403
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,770
- What?
- No, nothing.

404
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,730
- What?
- No, it's fine. Nothing.

405
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,065
No. What's nothing?

406
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,109
Your ama is coming, right?

407
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,569
I understand, well done.

408
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,070
I don't want to cause trouble.

409
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,321
It'll be a mess.

410
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,448
Tell her and that Sevillian she's with

411
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,741
that it's on me.

412
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,786
I don't care if I go or not. When is it?

413
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:43,745
On Saturday.

414
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,748
If I can be with you till Friday, I'm happy.

415
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,000
What do you mean?

416
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,586
I want to meet him. That's why you rang me.

417
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,754
- What's his name?
- Who? Antxon?

418
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,797
No, wait a minute.

419
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,508
You can't turn up now, wanting to give your opinion.

420
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,177
Why can't I?

421
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,137
Don't make the same mistake I made.

422
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,931
Tell him to come for dinner tonight.

423
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,266
You, him, the three of us.

424
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:07,603
I don't know. I'll see if I can convince him.

425
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:08,645
You tell him...

426
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,106
- Yes.
- Good.

427
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,363
Shit, Rafa, you really scared me!

428
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,282
Why were you scared?

429
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,493
When they rang, I thought something had happened to you.

430
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,454
But you told them you didn't know me.

431
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,873
What did you want me to say?

432
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,543
I was in shock. But I spent all night
wondering how to get you out.

433
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,629
Yesterday, you didn't even know me.

434
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,131
All right, yesterday I wasn't very polite.

435
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,383
But put yourself in my place.

436
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,222
You threw me out of your house!

437
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,559
Look, if we start exaggerating we won't get anywhere.

438
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,811
Come and meet my father.

439
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,813
Your father?

440
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,357
Something's going on here.

441
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,525
- You called him, didn't you?
- Certainly not.

442
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,819
Well, yes, but I didn't mean to.

443
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,655
Can you lose your accent?

444
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,241
Were you dropped on your head as a child?

445
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,159
What's going on?

446
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:08,205
I don't want my father to know I've been jilted.

447
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,667
I think that's all very well

448
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,335
but I'm going to Seville.

449
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,087
Oh, that's very nice.

450
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,838
Yesterday, all "lovey-dovey"...

451
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,383
Typical of Andalusians. All talk and then...

452
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,345
- What do I get out of this?
- Three days with me.

453
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,266
He's leaving on Saturday.
Weren't two days more than enough?

454
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,354
We'll have to prepare this really well.

455
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,899
Like, how did we meet?

456
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,193
Let's say the typical thing.

457
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,695
We got off at a disco.

458
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,531
That might be typical in Ibiza.
We're in Euskadi.

459
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,866
Well, at a pelota game or in a farmhouse.

460
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,120
No, I mean couples here don't
usually get off on the first day.

461
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,455
We did on the first night, my love!

462
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,291
Stop saying "my love"!

463
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,375
I can't help it.

464
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,461
Say "shit" every time you want to say "my love".

465
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,963
If my father hears you say "my love"...

466
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,881
How did we meet, shit?

467
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,092
Some friends introduced us.

468
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,636
That's really dull. It's got no kick.

469
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,221
He won't believe it.

470
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,433
OK, we were introduced and we got off.

471
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,102
No, we were introduced and dated for three weeks.

472
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,396
Three weeks before you got off?

473
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,231
That Antxon was a champ.

474
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,650
Three weeks until he asked for my number.

475
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,338
Let's see...

476
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,757
That might do for playing pelota

477
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,425
but not for the street.

478
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,359
These clothes are fine.

479
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,137
They're fine for picking olives

480
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,431
but I don't go out at night in a track suit.

481
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,184
And get rid of that necklace.

482
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,978
No! This is the Virgin of the Macarena.

483
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,355
It's the greatest.

484
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,648
No, the greatest is the punch from my father

485
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,275
if he finds out you're Andalusian.

486
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,530
You're getting a bit pushy.

487
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:07,657
Your phone.

488
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,660
We don't want a friend calling you from the Giralda.

489
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,955
You take away my roots,
and leave me incommunicado as well.

490
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,124
Typical of Basque radicals.

491
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,126
And a change of hairstyle.

492
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,795
You're right there,

493
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,297
you look like a donkey chewed your hair.

494
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,300
I mean your hair gel.

495
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,843
No way. My hair gel?

496
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,179
No, you can play around with my religion

497
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,348
but you're not touching my hair gel!

498
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:32,808
Stop moving!

499
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,394
Look, and a piercing here.

500
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,354
No, let's see... I'll put it here.

501
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,233
Will he be much longer?

502
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,152
He's punctual.
I don't know what's happened today.

503
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,822
I'll take the chance to say something.

504
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,075
I'm very happy you're finally getting on well.

505
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,159
Why "finally"?

506
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,663
A month ago someone told me you weren't getting on well.

507
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,997
That was all I heard

508
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,916
because I didn't want to know.

509
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,502
People can say what they want.

510
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,171
You'll see everything's fine with Antxon.

511
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,719
<i>Aupa.</i>

512
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,930
Hello, Koldo.

513
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,557
<i>How are you'? Aupa!</i>

514
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,599
<i>Alma!</i>

515
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,351
Maybe this was a bad time for you.

516
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,854
No, no, I’ve just been playing pelota, shit.

517
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,105
You play pelota?

518
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,190
He spends all Sunday on the court.

519
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,235
But if there's a demo, it's half demo, half court.

520
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:27,571
I combine sport and independence.

521
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:28,738
What'll you have?

522
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,407
A... <i>pote.</i>

523
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,909
Jose Mari, <i>give</i> him a <i>txikito.</i>

524
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,288
He reminds me a lot of that kid you dated,

525
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,622
the one from the south.

526
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,416
- From the south?
- Yes, from Vitoria.

527
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,377
But he did have his eight Basque surnames.

528
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,379
- As it should be.
- Eight at the least.

529
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:45,755
My grandfather had sixteen.

530
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:49,050
- Yes, Antxon has a lot.
- And very long, with lots of "k"s.

531
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,052
What are they?

532
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,055
What does it matter?

533
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,058
It's just in case I might know any of them.

534
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:03,106
Well... Gabilondo, Urdangarin,
Zubizarreta, Arguifiano...

535
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,232
<i>Four.</i>

536
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,068
And on my ama's side,

537
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,448
- Igartiburu, Erentxun...
- Six.

538
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,911
Have you forgotten the others?

539
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,996
No, when I remember my ancestors I...

540
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,415
Uncle Zubi, remember? What a man.

541
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,835
- I get emotional. Otegi...
- Jesus!

542
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,257
...and Clemente.

543
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,468
Clemente isn't Basque.

544
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,594
Who says so?

545
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:33,929
He's more Basque than the txapela.

546
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,096
He's not Basque!

547
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:37,849
He's not?

548
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,271
The family will be so upset when they hear.

549
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,817
But your grandchild will have eight!
So, shall we eat?

550
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,861
All right.

551
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,031
But as he's a Clemente, he might order paella.

552
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,616
Eh? Come on!

553
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,704
Where the fuck did you get the Clemente?

554
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,831
I don't know, but it's a miracle I didn't cry.

555
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,292
And stop all the hugging.

556
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,294
Why did you do it? You're not in Seville.

557
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,712
Do I look "uppersally"?

558
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,548
<i>Abertzale.</i>

559
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:11,675
I do, right?

560
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,301
Stay focused. Come on.

561
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,140
- Gabon.
- Hello.

562
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,686
Tonight we have beans, mixed salad,

563
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,564
peppers stuffed with txangurro, cod croquettes,

564
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,149
scrambled egg with mushrooms, squid in its own ink,

565
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,652
nape of hake and T-bone steak.

566
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,153
I'll have squid.

567
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,864
You don't choose. That's the set meal.

568
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,324
Here, you eat what there is.

569
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,494
No, squid is just what Antxon likes most.

570
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,080
He's mad about squid, aren't you, Antxon?

571
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,041
And all the rest too. I hope it's enough.

572
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,044
What'll you have to drink? Wine, cider...?

573
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,170
- Wine.
- Both.

574
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,922
And cider too. Both.

575
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,174
OK.

576
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,511
He forgot to tell us what the wines are.

577
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,681
Amaia, can you get the list, please?

578
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,517
When he brings the beans I'll tell him...

579
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,353
Get the menu, love, please.

580
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,112
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?

581
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:14,946
What?

582
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,032
I knew when I shook your hand.

583
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,618
Look me in the eye, I'm talking to you!

584
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,535
Bread...?

585
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,079
You don't fool me!
You've never played pelota!

586
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,956
With those hands? Come off it!

587
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,709
The league finished a few months ago.

588
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:31,713
Look, this is what a 2,000 lb. tuna
does to you on the Ivory Coast,

589
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,716
when it gets the nylon line round your neck and...

590
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,429
Nearly a ton weight, pulling for twenty minutes,

591
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,139
and it couldn't beat me.

592
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,058
You see what I'm getting at?

593
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,978
I think it's a bit of a metaphor between the tuna and me.

594
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,649
I don't know how the hell you tricked Amaia,

595
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,609
but if you lie to me,

596
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,738
I'll pull you in, tenderise you with my fists,

597
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,105
and make a sailor's knot out of you.

598
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,284
And those aren't "mattyphors" or any of that shit.

599
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,662
All right? And now, let's eat.

600
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,081
- How are things?
- Fine.

601
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,583
Great, here with your aita.

602
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,504
Osendo, no bad scene of any kind.

603
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:15,840
Beans.

604
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,802
Have you got Marqués de Zigoitia? Crianza?

605
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,680
- I have.
- Well, bring a bottle or two.

606
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,432
- Two?
- Two.

607
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,357
- What's he doing?
- I'll serve. Hold up your plate.

608
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,275
How can three of us eat with just that?

609
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,945
No, it's so it doesn't get cold.

610
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,949
A little bit of this isn't enough to get started!

611
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,959
Is he nervous or what?

612
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,794
No, why would he be nervous?

613
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,505
Well, why did he hug me as soon as he saw me?

614
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,632
Maybe he is a bit nervous.

615
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,135
You both seem odd to me.
And I know you well.

616
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,305
You haven't seen me in six years.
You don't know me, and him less.

617
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,350
I have to say I don't like him very much.

618
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,685
I'm the one getting married.

619
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,061
We'll see.

620
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,273
I'll drive, it seems I'm the one who drank least.

621
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:17,819
Are you all right?

622
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:22,657
Yes, I was looking to see if there
were any interesting mushrooms.

623
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,702
But they're all button mushrooms and "boletua".

624
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,539
Koldo, <i>eskerrik</i> asko for dinner.
I'll see you tomorrow.

625
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,958
What do you mean? We'll drive you home.

626
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,377
No, he'd rather walk,

627
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,921
because in general he likes walking a lot.

628
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,048
Yes, and to let the meal settle a bit.

629
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,051
Even more? You settled it all on that bush.

630
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,512
All right, where do you live?

631
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:49,058
Between the outskirts and the centre,

632
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,852
in the middle.

633
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,896
You start, and we'll tell you.

634
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,564
Yes, you start and...

635
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,941
Come on, get in.

636
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,748
When I was your age I knew where I lived.

637
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,920
Well? How are we doing?

638
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,380
Great, Koldo. It's been a fantastic night.

639
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,673
No, I mean the direction.

640
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,010
- Right.
- Right.

641
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,156
Antxon, do you know where you live yet?

642
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,200
How could I not know, Koldo?

643
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,495
There! It's there.

644
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,497
Are you sure?

645
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,332
I'm sure, Koldo. I'm sure.

646

647
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,264
It's certainly far out.

648
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,975
I've always liked living in the mountains.

649
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,686
<i>Eskerrik asko. Agur.</i>

650
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,855
- I'll wait here for you.
- Yes.

651
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,190
Act like we're saying goodbye.

652
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,316
What...?

653
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:26,573
That'll do.

654
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,409
I was about to pull back in front of your father.

655
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,702
You're...

656
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,203
Come on!

657
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,121
Coming.

658
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,416
What are you going to do? I have to go.

659
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,960
You go on, I'll sort something out.

660
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,764
What's he doing?

661
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,892
Nothing. Shall we go?

662
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,435
Isn't he going inside?

663
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,645
I don't know, he's there,

664
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,148
cool, walking around. Let's go.

665
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,357
Wait, wait.

666
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,276
Antxon, what's wrong?

667
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,028
Have you lost your keys?

668
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,530
No, no. You can go on, don't worry.

669
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,240
- Yes, let's go.
- No, wait...

670
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,035
I didn't see you go in, that's why I said...

671
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,289
- I've lost the keys.
- See? What did I say?

672
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,083
This morning I was... chopping tree trunks.

673
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,836
I was busy swinging the axe, and agur to the keys.

674
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,505
- It's always the same.
- You lost them.

675
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,468
Hey, you left that open. You're in luck.

676
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,303
Yes, I'll close it later.

677
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,806
<i>Eskerrik asko, agur, gabon...</i>

678
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,433
I'm abertzale.

679
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,392
No, no.

680
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,644
I mean, to get in.

681
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,562
I'll lift you up and... In you go.

682
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,105
No, no. How can you lift him up...?

683
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,149
Why not? That's how it's always done.

684
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,401
You can't lift him up to the window.

685
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,778
For Christ's sake! Antxon, come on.

686
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,363
- But"
- It's dead easy.

687
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,365
Koldo, you're cold... and you've just eaten.

688
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,532
Come on, Antxon.

689
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,911
Put your foot here when I say three, eh?

690
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,497
Do it carefully, you look a bit light-headed.

691
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:58,373
Come on!

692
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,833
<i>Bat, bi...</i>

693
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,043
<i>eta hiru. Aupa!</i>

694
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,631
<i>Eskerrik asko, Kokio.</i>

695
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,717
You see? That's it, let's go.

696
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:10,677
Come on, love.

697
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,982
Who's there?

698
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:25,400
No, no, don't shout, please.

699
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,069
It's me. Long live Spain and the Constitution.

700
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,445
Did you hear that?

701
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,114
What? No, I didn't.

702
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,657
It was a tree. Let's go.

703
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,953
You're the Andalusian guy.

704
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,707
Yes! I'm Antxon, I mean, Rafa, but Antxon.

705
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,417
You really scared me, love.

706
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,210
Why didn't you say you were coming to eat?

707
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,170
I've got no garlic for the "migas".

708
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,048
Don't even mention food, I'm going to explode.

709
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,676
Sweet Jesus!

710
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,554
You have to help me...

711
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,348
I'm Mercedes, but I prefer Merche.

712
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,518
No, I'll call you Arantxa.

713
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:03,104
If it has to be a name from here, I prefer Anne.

714
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,815
- Antxon!
- All right, "Anne".

715
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,191
Play along with me, OK?

716
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,901
From now on, you're my mother.

717
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,987
- Whatever happens, my mother.
- Don't worry.

718
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,656
I was at a theatre workshop, I must be very chameleonic.

719
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,116
Antxon, everything OK?

720
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,326
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

721
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,333
I hope you aren't annoyed about Arantxa,

722
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,170
but I think my hairstyle is more like an Anne.

723
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,847
<i>Aupa.</i>

724
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:38,931
What's up?

725
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,601
Nothing. Everything OK?

726
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,896
Yes, great, the two of us are here, a happy family.

727
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,524
I was dying for him to come home, right, Antxonito?

728
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,861
Koldo, this is Anne, my ama.

729
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,322
Right, Anne. Suits me, doesn't it?

730
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,783
Anne... Igartiburu?

731
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,494
Hell, there's a coincidence!

732
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,872
Yes, like the girl on TV.

733
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,085
Mother and son all our lives and we never realised!

734
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,797
Won't you come in?

735
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,757
- Well...
- We love each other.

736
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,634
It's OK, ama, they're leaving.

737
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,052
That doesn't matter.

738
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,888
It's polite to invite people.
That's what you do.

739
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:24,644
Despite these little disagreements, he's a wonderful son.

740
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,730
We'll have time later to meet up.

741
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,232
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

742
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,691
What do you mean?

743
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,611
Tomorrow we could go fishing for bonito

744
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,238
and cook it at night.

745
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,447
<i>- Yes.</i>
- I'm <i>arrantzale.</i>

746
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,949
And I'm Anne. A pleasure.

747
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,077
We'll leave you now. It's very late.

748
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,286
Come on.

749
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,038
<i>Bai. Agur.</i>

750
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,414
Aita, please.

751
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,291
See you tomorrow, my dears.

752
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,262
Tomorrow, my ass. I'm out of here.

753
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,680
Tomorrow we're going fishing.

754
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,181
What are you talking about?

755
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,725
Did you see that Koldo? He's a brute.

756
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,602
I thought he was very nice.

757
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,230
I'm going to Seville.

758
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,567
You're not going back without that girl.

759
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,111
I should never have come. it was a mistake.

760
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,115
That happened to me with my Antonio, God rest him.

761
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,491
I came to Euskadi for him

762
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,077
and look at me now.
I don't want to go back to Céceres.

763
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,081
I'm going and I'm not coming back.

764
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,043
I said that too the first night.

765
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:43,449
What the...?

766
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,701
Isn't this the direct bus to Bilbao?

767
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:46,619
Yes...

768
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,247
Fucking...!

769
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,250
What happened?

770
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,418
Please drive on. That woman's insane.

771
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:02,134
Kepa, let me in, it's important.

772
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,261
Amaia, what's up?

773
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,012
Nothing, don't worry.

774
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,931
- Come on.
- I'm not going anywhere.

775
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,266
I've brought you clothes.

776
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,850
Are you going to kidnap me?

777
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:16,399
Look, I said "kidnap" as a manner of speech.

778
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,235
It's nothing political. I know you can be...

779
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,780
Wasn't this the direct bus to Bilbao?

780
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,366
He's leaving tomorrow.
Just another day, please.

781
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,410
I don't know if I can take any more.

782
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,585
Antxon!

783
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,920
Not Antxon again!

784
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,922
Yes, or we'll get in a mess.

785
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,173
Weren't you with my father?

786
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,591
Yes, but...

787
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,176
I think he suspects something.

788
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,721
He says it doesn't seem you've been together three years.

789
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:49,098
- He did?
- Yes, he keeps asking me

790
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:52,310
if you're always like this, so... unaffectionate.

791
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,979
You don't really seem to be in love.
Have you had a row?

792
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,106
It doesn't matter. He's leaving tomorrow.

793
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:58,858
Merche is kind of right.

794
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,359
Now that we're in this,

795
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,902
we should do it well.

796
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,238
But if you want us to do the typical botch-up

797
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:05,656
and your father to realise...

798
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:10,453
Coming!

799
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,289
You won't catch me out.

800
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,458
That holding hands shit

801
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,835
and smooching isn't going to happen.

802
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,379
But someone from Seville can pretend to be Basque?

803
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,672
You're crazy.

804
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,382
No, don't insist. I said no.

805
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,551
And you, don't go beyond the waist.

806
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:28,220
Are we talking about the hard zone or the soft zone?

807
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,347
The waist.

808
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,514
He's coming.

809
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,434
You fucking...

810
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,186
- Well?
- A <i>upa.</i>

811
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,021
Ready to catch that bonito?

812
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:37,897
Yes!

813
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,398
Let's go.

814
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,320
Be careful with her, she's a bit bossy.

815
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,280
Don't worry, it's under control.

816
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:47,198
Under control?

817
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:49,658
You might think so, but you're being a wimp.

818
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,160
No, I'm playing for time.

819
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,788
In two clays I'll have her in Seville, dancing flamenco.

820
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,623
- I mean it.
- Really?

821
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:11,389
In our day, couples did things differently.

822
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:13,140
Now, young people

823
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,935
are together one day, they're arguing the next...

824
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,479
That's not the way.

825
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,733
Don't take it badly, I've only known you one day but...

826
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,027
What is it?

827
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,363
It's nothing.

828
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:31,409
Look, when I met him
I thought he was... not bad

829
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:33,577
but kind of odd.

830
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,621
I think your boy's odd.

831
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,289
That's very nice.

832
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,457
So, you don't like my son?

833
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,418
No, it's not that, Anne.

834
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,669
What about your daughter?

835
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:45,256
You think I want my son to marry a taxi driver?

836
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:47,508
A taxi driver, Koldo!

837
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,135
Some fortune he hunted!

838
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,053
Do I say anything to you about that

839
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,347
or the Romanian trucker haircut she has?

840
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,849
- No.
- Right.

841
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,519
If we're going to be honest, we'll say everything.

842
00:48:58,978 --> 00:48:59,854
Fine.

843
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,606
Have you said all this to Antxon?

844
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,984
I don't have to like Amaia,

845
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,735
he's the one marrying her.

846
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:10,739
And, anyway, look at them.
How could it go badly?

847
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,707
That hand is low.

848
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,292
You said on your waist.

849
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,586
Your little finger isn't on my waist.

850
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,880
It might be on the very limit

851
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,423
but I'm not touching the soft zone.

852
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:28,716
Move it up.

853
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,177
We're supposed to be getting married.

854
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,803
Enjoy it and relax a bit.

855
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,972
I can't enjoy it if you're touching my ass.

856
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,350
I mean the Titanic moment we're experiencing here.

857
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,393
Fuck.

858
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,395
And your ass isn't your best bit.

859
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,438
Excuse me?

860
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,565
- I'm going to kiss you.
- What's wrong with my ass?

861
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,441
With my tongue.

862
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,901
Rafa, don't you dare.

863
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,991
Well, you two, enjoying yourselves?

864
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,578
Amaia, go and give Anne a hand.

865
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:58,746
A hand with what?

866
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,831
Please. Go on.

867
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,170
Well, Antxon?

868
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,214
Have you travelled a lot?

869
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,716
Well...

870
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,344
there was a time I travelled a lot.

871
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:14,261
Sure.

872
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:18,265
I've been... in GuipUzcoa, in Donosti,

873
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,934
Hernani, Renteria...

874
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,018
Oh, Lord!

875
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,020
At your age,

876
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:26,148
I thought that if I stayed
in Argoitia, I'd lose out on a lot,

877
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,108
but it was the other way round.

878
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,569
What I lost was my wife and everything I had.

879
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,655
You get what I'm saying?

880
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,282
<i>Aita!</i> Something's making a lot of noise!

881
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,743
Like when the washing machine's finishing.

882
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:38,827
All right.

883
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,581
I bet you a round I'll catch a 30 lb. bonito.

884
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,375
Bonito, not tuna.

885
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,460
It's a bet.

886
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:47,378
Good!

887
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,547
<i>Oso ondo, agur.</i>

888
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,131
<i>- Eskerrik asko.
- Au pa!</i>

889
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,175
<i>- Aupa.
- Aupa.</i>

890
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,679
Three wines! Crianza, eh?
The son-in-law's paying.

891
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,182
Shit, look who's here, Ugaitz!

892
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,643
He's the fucking master I was telling you about.

893
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,019
<i>Aupa.</i>

894
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,854
- It's his gang.
- Yeah.

895
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,023
The drinks are on me, we're closing up.

896
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,608
There's a demo today.

897
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,610
You didn't say anything.

898
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,154
About the...? ls today Thursday?

899
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,072
Yes.

900
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,283
I don't know where my head is.

901
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,952
And I was even on the committee organising things.

902
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,495
Yes, you told me.

903
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,622
How about a bit of "Kortatu"?

904
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,916
No, no, some olives would be fine.

905
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:31,380
Olives, he says! What a joker!

906
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,513
"Machine gun", we...

907
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,015
We did what you asked.

908
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,393
- What did you do?
- You know, going a step farther.

909
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,061
You're sure, aren't you?

910
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,355
Well, a little step. Not...

911
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,732
You'll see.

912
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,611
<i>Tell everyone what you told us the other day.</i>

913
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:56,363
<i>Go ahead, "Machine gun".</i>

914
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,323
In Euskera, come on!

915
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:58,657
<i>Yes, bai,</i>

916
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,784
I'll happily say it in Basque.

917
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,288
But I tend to think in Basque and translate into Spanish,

918
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,541
to talk to the foreigners, as I call them.

919
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,085
Yes, he's like that.

920
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,004
He's a chancer.

921
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,672
Do like the gang said.

922
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,591
Talk in Euskera. We haven't heard you yet.

923
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:25,851
<i>Erretzea debekatuta dago.</i>

924
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:27,519
Why?

925
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,314
Why what, Koldo, specifically?

926
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,816
Why is smoking forbidden?

927
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,402
It's always been an obsession of his.

928
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,863
He's against nicotine and Spain.

929
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,240
- What's that got to do with it?
- A lot, Koldo.

930
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,325
A lot.

931
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,452
Who gets the cigarette tax?
The Spanish government.

932
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,913
You might think it's unimportant

933
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,914
but I'm like that.

934
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,666
First, health, then independence.

935
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,751
Independent, yes, but healthy.

936
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,252
Very healthy.

937
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,756
That wine must be fucking great.

938
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:56,965
Well, are we going?

939
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:57,800
Yes.

940
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:01,762
You go on, we have to pick up "a few things".

941
00:53:07,844 --> 00:53:08,911
HOMAGE TO
JOSE ANTONIO ARTEAGAREN

942
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:12,564
Independence! Fighting is the only way!

943
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,417
You just have to keep quiet.
Nothing will happen.

944
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,501
Nothing, she says.

945
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:35,671
I'm the new Andalusian leader of the kale borroka.

946
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,262
You've got a place in the front row.

947
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,723
You're the fucking boss! Come on.

948
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:46,849
He's here!

949
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,143
In the front row, he says.

950
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:52,229
Is this a demonstration or a Springsteen concert?

951
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,732
We'll be at the head of all that rumpus.

952
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,567
Don't worry. Nothing ever happens here.

953
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,292
Antxon! Antxon!

954
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:14,418
Antxon! Come on.

955
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,713
Take the loudspeaker, we want to hear you.

956
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:19,506
No, really...

957
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,092
I said a couple of borroka things

958
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,427
and felt great,

959
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,804
but that's very uncomfortable for Spain, Koldo,

960
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:26,847
I hope you didn't mind.

961
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:27,765
Come on.

962
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,350
Don't let them down. Let's hear you.

963
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,860
<i>We are better...</i>

964
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,321
<i>than the Spanish.</i>

965
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:55,000
<i>We are better...
than the Spanish.</i>

966
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:58,796
<i>We are better... than the Spanish.</i>

967
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,220
Why don't you say it in Euskera?

968
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,515
It is a bit odd that you don't.

969
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,808
Say it in Euskera!

970
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,143
So, what do you want?

971
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,062
That I speak in Euskera? OK.

972
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,647
The thing is,

973
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,316
who are we asking for independence?

974
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,859
The Basques?

975
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,111
No. The Spanish.

976
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:26,156
If we say it in Euskera, they won't understand.

977
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,201
It's true, they won't understand.
We have to say it in Spanish.

978
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:38,126
My aunties all agree, we want amnesty.

979
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,629
Come on, Argoitia, speak out, don't be shown up!

980
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:41,922
<i>Gora Euskadi, ole'!</i>

981
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:45,759
<i>Right now, a peaceful meeting is being held</i>

982
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,262
<i>in his home town, where some residents</i>

983
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:52,307
<i>are paying tribute to this historic nationalist leader.</i>

984
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:54,768
WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP?

985
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,106
That's it, that's it!

986
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,276
<i>- Come on, Argoitia!
- Fucking hell!</i>

987
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,695
<i>Oé, oé, oé, Euskadi all the way!</i>

988
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:05,779
Give me the remote.

989
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:08,657
<i>Oé, oé, oé, Euskadi all the way!</i>

990
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:09,491
Stop, Stop-

991
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:12,411
<i>Euskadi has a special colour!</i>

992
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:16,123
<i>Euskadi has a special colour!</i>

993
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,667
<i>Euskadi has a different colour!</i>

994
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:21,378
Stop, Stop-

995
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,214
Waiter!

996
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,049
What the fuck are you doing?

997
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:26,967
This is fucking great!

998
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,177
Koldo, I'm on fire!

999
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,888
Knock, knock!

1000
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,180
Who's there?

1001
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,807
Laura!

1002
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,475
Laura who?

1003
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,562
"Laura Norder", cops at the door!

1004
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,982
"Laura Norder", cops at the door!

1005
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,692
- Stop, Stop-
_l'm flying.

1006
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:44,484
Well, come down.

1007
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,448
I'm the boss here.

1008
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:51,909
Take a look at them. Stop now.

1009
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,391
<i>Gora Euskadi, gora Euskadi!</i>

1010
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,226
Now what, "Machine gun"? Look at this!

1011
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,311
What have you done?

1012
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:20,187
What you told us!

1013
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,855
Now what? You tell us, we'll do it.

1014
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,691
Hide and wait for orders from above.

1015
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,569
Above, where?

1016
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,989
- To independence and beyond!
- Right.

1017
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,242
Isn't that from "Toy Story"?

1018
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,166
Well? How was the bonito?

1019
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,461
- It couldn't be fresher!
- Delicious.

1020
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,420
Wonderful.

1021
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,090
The bonito was fucking great.

1022
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,467
Look, I'm going to say one thing.

1023
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:52,594
When I was young,

1024
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,597
I was involved in that independence stuff, too.

1025
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,518
But those were different times, with Franco and all.

1026
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,020
But today,

1027
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:05,357
getting so involved with the <i>kale</i> borroka,

1028
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:06,775
I don't know...

1029
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,736
Well, I'm not that involved.

1030
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,197
It's more like a hobby for me.

1031
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:15,242
Hey, but I'm Basque, you know? A lot.

1032
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,078
A lot!

1033
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,039
<i>Do you want some more txacoli?</i>

1034
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,749
This wine's fucking great.

1035
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,876
What's the grape...? And the year...?

1036
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,254
- What's that?
- What?

1037
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,131
I don't hear anything. Neither do you, right?

1038
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,382
- No.
- Be quiet.

1039
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,301
It sounds like...

1040
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,638
Can it be sevillanas?

1041
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,225
A sevillana, he says!

1042
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,853
- Sevillanas en Argoitia!
- That's all we needed.

1043
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,897
Don't give your father
any more wine. Look at him!

1044
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:50,152
I heard it in here. I'm serious, really.

1045
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,696
Come on, clink.

1046
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,823
That's it, drink. Take yours, Koldo.

1047
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:56,491
Clink!

1048
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,119
Christ Almighty! What the fuck...?

1049
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,089
Where are you going?

1050
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,759
Be quiet! It's coming from there.

1051
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,262
Sevillanas in Argoitia.

1052
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:33,945
- It's here...
- Wait, wait.

1053
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:37,240
- I have to tell you something.
- Yes.

1054
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,284
- Maybe you don't.
- No.

1055
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,704
What the hell's going on?

1056
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:47,209
There's something very important you have to know.

1057
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,835
It's not that important.

1058
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,545
I have to tell him.

1059
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:54,883
The other day, ama and the other came for dinner,

1060
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,510
and he left his things.

1061
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,636
The Sevillian? Here?

1062
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:58,970
Yes.

1063
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,263
I should have guessed.

1064
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,517
We didn't know how to tell you.

1065
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,519
The fucking son of a bitch!

1066
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,146
It's his phone. There, now you know.

1067
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,900
- This is his?
- Yes.

1068
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,319
I want to see his fucking face...

1069
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:16,822
To hell With him!

1070
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,741
Not only do our taxes pay for their siestas

1071
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:22,577
but now they come here and screw our women!

1072
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,539
Well done.

1073
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,415
A pity about the window.

1074
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,710
I thought it was open.

1075
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,383
I don't care about Maider.

1076
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,176
But, I don't know.

1077
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,470
A Sevillian? For fuck's sake!

1078
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,889
What kind of example is that for a daughter?

1079
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,393
Don't worry, Amaia has taken after you.

1080
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,895
That's right. She can say what she wants,

1081
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,022
but she takes after her father.

1082
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,442
She always says nice things about you.

1083
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:58,029
She's really missed you.

1084
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:00,907
She told you that?

1085
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:04,244
Yes. She's always "Koldo this",

1086
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,663
"Koldo that, Koldo this,"

1087
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,748
"Koldo... that."

1088
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,544
We hadn't talked for a long time. Years even.

1089
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,090
She really suffered, you know.

1090
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,094
She finds it hard to say things,

1091
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:24,472
but she loves you more than anything in the world.

1092
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,142
Well, like Antxon loves me.

1093
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,311
You're lovely.

1094
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,522
Well, ama, it's time to go.

1095
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,941
No, how can you leave now?

1096
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,986
He can sleep here, can't he, Amayita?

1097
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:41,615
There isn't a lot of room here...

1098
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,283
What did you call me?

1099
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:44,951
You two go up to bed.

1100
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,662
We'll make sure the wine is finished, eh, Anne?

1101
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,332
But if he doesn't want to stay,

1102
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,167
we shouldn't force him.

1103
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,585
No, that's all right.

1104
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,879
If we have to sleep together, for convenience,

1105
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,672
that's OK.

1106
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,341
Do you think I'm stupid?

1107
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,469
I've seen his clothes in your drawers.

1108
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,139
Amaia, he's caught us out.

1109
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:09,142
Just let it go, we're too obvious.

1110
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:14,189
Hey, one thing.

1111
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,861
I want you to know that I've really missed you too.

1112
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:21,154
What?

1113
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:25,200
Amaia, I love you.

1114
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,744
Very much.

1115
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:31,289
And I love you too, Antxon.

1116
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:35,085
It's all right if you don't finish the bottle.

1117
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,425
What are you doing?

1118
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,595
There's a lot of cloth down there.
Stuff has to breathe.

1119
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:51,434
You didn't tell me your mother was with a Sevillian.

1120
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,728
It's obviously in the genes.

1121
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,356
Put on your shorts, Antxon.

1122
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,900
I'm not Antxon, I'm Rafael Quirés!

1123
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,278
I'm a float bearer in
the brotherhood of the Divine Creator

1124
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,781
and a member of Real Betis Football Club:
number 14,430.

1125
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:08,576
I've got three photos with Gordillo,
two signed and one dedicated.

1126
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:10,787
Just a minute!

1127
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,041
Come in!

1128
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,503
It's nothing.

1129
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:21,673
Just to tell you that I told Anne that,

1130
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,801
as it's so late, she should sleep over too.

1131
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:28,430
I took sheets from the hall closet, OK?

1132
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,264
OK.

1133
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:31,766
Tomorrow we'll all say goodbye at the port.

1134
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:33,977
<i>Agur, aita.</i>

1135
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:37,397
How are you?

1136
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:41,776
<i>Great, "osendo". Eskerrik asko for asking.
How are you?</i>

1137
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:45,405
Hey, will you close the door? Please?

1138
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:47,782
All right...

1139
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,580
Let go of me right now.

1140
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,498
He came in so quickly, my love.

1141
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,792
Stop calling me that. And let go of me.

1142
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,502
Fuck it...

1143
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,757
You're just scared that with contact...

1144
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:05,467
What?

1145
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,678
You'll be asking for a bit of "cinnamon stick".

1146
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,223
Have you never been in bed with a woman
without something happening?

1147
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,100
Apart from you, no.

1148
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,352
Well, with Rocl'o.

1149
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,855
We just necked a bit.
That's because she was my cousin.

1150
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:21,858
Then I'm going to be the first.

1151
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,777
Only 'cause I'm playing away from home.

1152
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,236
Nothing happened in Seville.

1153
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,821
You know what would've happened

1154
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,198
if you'd stayed.

1155
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,492
I'd have given you a ride...

1156
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,327
in a carriage,

1157
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:35,580
drawn by four white horses through Triana.

1158
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,457
That would have knocked the nastiness out of you.

1159
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,334
You're so corny.

1160
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,961
Maybe, but I've scored more than Julio Iglesias.

1161
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,131
And gold trimmings along the side,

1162
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,674
and the horses with their manes tossing,

1163
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:51,012
with that special shampoo and conditioner they have now.

1164
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,682
And, clapping their hands, the greatest in Spain:

1165
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,267
"Los del FIT?"-

1166
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,686
- Look, no way.
- No way what?

1167
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:02,357
Even if I was blind drunk, I wouldn't get in one of those.

1168
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:06,361
Well, well, well.

1169
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:08,905
I'll tell you something.

1170
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,990
Tonight you're going to lose out

1171
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,909
because I've got my dignity.

1172
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:14,452
I'm getting on the floor.

1173
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,665
And were they really...?

1174
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,167
No doubt about it.

1175
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,711
Antxon's shorts were on the floor.

1176
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,798
Wow!

1177
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:27,882
And you...

1178
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:31,803
saying Amaia might just make him sleep on the floor.

1179
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,179
The thing is...

1180
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,014
she's changed so much.

1181
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,308
If you knew what she was like with boys.

1182
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,060
Here.

1183
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:47,694
That's it.

1184
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,663
<i>Chin-chin.</i>

1185
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,431
I need some sleep.

1186
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,434
I want to leave early tomorrow.

1187
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:22,395
The port is going to be fucking crowded with...

1188
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:34,699
<i>txalupas and arrantzales who've been catching</i> squid

1189
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:37,327
and I want to avoid the fuss.

1190
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,620
Of course.

1191
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,538
Anne,

1192
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,457
the bathroom, if you want to know,

1193
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,209
is upstairs...

1194
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,419
- Second on the left.
- All right.

1195
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:48,171
- Can you get up OK?
- Yes.

1196
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:50,673
Well...

1197
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,009
See you tomorrow.

1198
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,012
See you tomorrow, love.

1199
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:02,810
Anne.

1200
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:05,313
What?

1201
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,066
Everything OK?

1202
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:11,486
- What?
- The bathroom, did I tell you?

1203
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,238
Yeah, you told me.

1204
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,073
That's why I'm telling you.

1205
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,784
<i>Good, well, eskerrik asko,
thank</i> you. <i>Good night.</i>

1206
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:20,119
Sleep well. <i>Agur.</i>

1207
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:23,164
See you tomorrow.

1208
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:43,935
Anyway, look,

1209
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:46,604
we're not going to stretch this out.

1210
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:49,566
I had a great time with you all. Fantastic.

1211
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,236
But I hate goodbyes so...

1212
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,862
it's best to say nothing.

1213
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,489
I should go now

1214
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,908
because otherwise we'll all get emotional.

1215
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,411
Have a good wedding.

1216
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:04,455
Enjoy it... Antxon,

1217
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,333
I'm sorry if at first... You know...

1218
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,877
We're like that here.

1219
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:13,172
- Should I go, Amaia?
- No.

1220
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,134
Look, I mean...

1221
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,428
we've had a great time but...

1222
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,723
if you have to go, it's a pity.

1223
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:23,850
- There'll be other occasions.
- Yes.

1224
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,811
Would you like me to visit you from time to time?

1225
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:28,855
- Of course.
- When?

1226
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:32,317
I don't know, just, in general.

1227
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:35,028
<i>All right, txikichu,</i>

1228
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,238
if you've nothing more to say...

1229
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:39,324
<i>Agur.</i>

1230
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:41,868
What did you say?

1231
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:44,162
Eh? Nothing.

1232
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,789
I know what you're up to.

1233
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:47,915
What?

1234
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,500
All of it, Amaia.

1235
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,378
I couldn't and I didn't have...

1236
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,298
How can I not stay for the wedding?

1237
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,676
Because you can't.

1238
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,094
Maybe the christening.

1239
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:02,680
Yes, but it wasn't a question.

1240
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,765
Excuse me?

1241
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,725
A father has to be there.

1242
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,727
I'm staying. For the wedding
and whatever else.

1243
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:09,020
With you, in Argoitia.

1244
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:10,480
What? No, wait, wait.

1245
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,440
No, no fucking waiting.

1246
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:13,650
I've waited too long.

1247
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,777
I should never have gone away!

1248
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,111
That's right, Koldo!

1249
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,571
What do you mean, ama?

1250
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,990
He can't decide just like that.

1251
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,283
Why not? Of course I can.

1252
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:23,284
That's it, decided.

1253
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:25,411
No, look, you can't come to the wedding

1254
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:27,705
and coincide with ama. You said so yourself.

1255
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:31,084
She's the one hanging out with Andalusians.

1256
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,879
If a Sevillian can be there, why the fuck can't I?

1257
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:36,923
Are we stupid or what?

1258
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:38,800
Why did you do that?

1259
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,386
I don't know, it was the emotion of the moment.

1260
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:42,345
Eh, Antxon?

1261
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:45,473
I'm calling Fr. Inaxio right now

1262
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,350
and he can make time for you.

1263
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:48,434
<i>No, aita.</i>

1264
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,603
If I'm paying a fortune for the reception

1265
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,689
- let me pick the priest at least.
- What?

1266
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:56,025
Didn't you tell him the reception is on me?

1267
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:58,403
But no sirloins or chops.

1268
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:01,447
A three-pound T-bone for everyone.
Maybe the Sevillian will choke.

1269
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,449
I'll call the priest.

1270
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,993
Shit, the phone was in there.

1271
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:10,289
We'll have to go to the chapel, and it's in the sticks.

1272
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:14,127
Well, we'll go.

1273
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,677
The couple must be aware

1274
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:25,221
of what is involved when they come before God

1275
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,391
to ask Him to bless their union.

1276
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,310
For that reason, it is very important to be sure

1277
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,188
that the person we are with is the right one.

1278
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,734
Amaia, tell me,

1279
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:41,154
did you always know Antxon would be your companion?

1280
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,031
Well,

1281
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,368
to be honest, at first I didn't.

1282
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:48,828
You didn't?

1283
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,956
Why was that? Tell me, and what happened

1284
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:54,834
so that in the end you're here together?

1285
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,170
I don't know.

1286
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,006
He's a good person.

1287
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:02,467
Amaia, there are lots of good people

1288
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:04,844
but he must have done something that the others didn't.

1289
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:08,723
Father, ask her what I haven't done, it'll be quicker.

1290
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,058
Your turn, Antxon.

1291
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,311
I'll ask you the same:

1292
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,188
why Amaia?

1293
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:18,399
I don't know.

1294
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,110
What do you like about her?

1295
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:23,863
Well,

1296
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,785
right now, off the top of my head,
I can't think of anything.

1297
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:32,705
Hey, there must be something.
I think so, anyway.

1298
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:35,208
Two days ago you liked everything, and now, nothing?

1299
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,459
That's it.

1300
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:38,169
Something. Think, Antxon.

1301
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:39,754
Well...

1302
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:43,216
One thing is that she's very honest.

1303
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,051
She always tells the truth.

1304
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:47,178
She's never lied to her father,

1305
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:49,680
and with me, honest from the start.

1306
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:50,890
OK, that'll do.

1307
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:54,602
And another thing, she's the
most affectionate person I know.

1308
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,479
She's always hugging people.

1309
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:57,605
Isn't that something?

1310
01:11:57,772 --> 01:12:00,107
Another thing I'm crazy about is her hairstyle.

1311
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:03,194
Oh, young people...

1312
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:05,571
Well, that's great, just great.

1313
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,156
But it's not enough.

1314
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,491
Now you have to confess.

1315
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,243
Confess?

1316
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:11,160
Yes.

1317
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,538
You're a Christian, aren't you?

1318
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,207
Christian and practicing

1319
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:18,376
and apostolic and Roman.

1320
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:21,671
- Is it necessary?
- Please, what a question.

1321
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,214
Of course.

1322
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:25,675
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1323
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,052
- Conceived without sin.
- Very good.

1324
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:29,929
We can start.

1325
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,556
Antxon,

1326
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,432
why do you never come to mass?

1327
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:36,477
Father, I go to mass every Sunday.

1328
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,522
I had my First Communion
and even asked about the second one.

1329
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,232
And I sang a "saeta" at my Confirmation.

1330
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,526
A what?

1331
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,199
My name isn't Antxon.

1332
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,244
I'm Rafael Quirés, from Santa Cruz, in Seville.

1333
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,413
Antxon was the name of Amaia's fiancé.

1334
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,248
They were going to get married, right?

1335
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,708
But the wedding was called off.

1336
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,294
I met Amaia this week in Seville.

1337
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,629
We kind of hit it off and I took her home

1338
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,172
to sleep with her.

1339
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:07,633
I admit it, Father, to commit a sin.

1340
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,635
One, or several, depending on how it went,

1341
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,512
because I'd been drinking, but not that much.

1342
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,180
I didn't consummate,

1343
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,807
she fell asleep and...

1344
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,767
I didn't touch her. I swear I didn't.

1345
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:21,105
If I rubbed up against her a bit
it was because the mattress is soft.

1346
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:24,442
I came here to see her and she told me
to pretend to be Basque,

1347
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:25,693
to be her fiancé.

1348
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,863
Yesterday I said I was touching her waist.

1349
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:32,366
It was a lie. I touched her ass,
as much of it as I could, and more.

1350
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,452
Make a note of that.

1351
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:36,203
Give me all the prayers you want,

1352
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:39,665
because I'm the new Andalusian
leader of the <i>kale</i> borroka too.

1353
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:42,376
Don't worry, there's no wedding tomorrow.

1354
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,211
I'm going back to Seville.

1355
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:46,505
As soon as she's distracted, I'm on the bus.

1356
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,758
That's about it.

1357
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:51,719
Oh, last week I changed some skirting board for a friend

1358
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:53,721
and didn't charge him VAT.

1359
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:55,014
I know that's wrong,

1360
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:56,349
but I couldn't charge him.

1361
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,601
The day before I screwed his girlfriend.

1362
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:01,896
Father, are you OK?

1363
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,982
Get out, get out, get out!

1364
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:06,275
Koldo!

1365
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,902
- Are you all right, Inaxio?
- Bai, bai.

1366
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,447
It's odd this happened to you.

1367
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:12,740
No, it's not odd.

1368
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:14,867
You have to eat more sugar.

1369
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,202
You need beetroot.

1370
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:17,411
This person...

1371
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:19,789
What do you think of my son-in-law?

1372
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:24,168
Amaia is the one who has to be sure about him.

1373
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,379
Amaia, etorri.

1374
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:28,923
Come here, child.

1375
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:32,843
Don't you have something very important to tell your <i>aita?</i>

1376
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:33,803
What?

1377
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,432
No, don't worry, when we get home...

1378
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,728
I can't believe it.

1379
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,481
I never expected this.

1380
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:46,816
You're...

1381
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:50,820
Maybe you're making a big thing of the wedding.

1382
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,239
How could I not make a big thing of it?

1383
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:54,824
It is what it is.

1384
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:57,243
I've told all the cousins in Hondarribia.

1385
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,619
You called them already?

1386
01:14:58,786 --> 01:14:59,453
Yes.

1387
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,872
I told you you couldn't come here and...

1388
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:03,624
All of them?

1389
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:04,625
All of them!

1390
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:07,378
I don't care if you haven't seen them in years.

1391
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:10,089
They're your cousins, they're Zugastis.

1392
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:11,382
And at the wedding

1393
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:14,385
I want the Zugastis to be in the majority, dammit!

1394
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:16,762
Amaia, you look beautiful!

1395
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,681
Now that's what I call a dress.

1396
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,224
And Antxon?

1397
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:21,225
Antxon?

1398
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,312
Don't worry, I know he can't see the dress.

1399
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:27,356
He said he was going for a walk.

1400
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:32,319
Get out of here, I have to take this off.

1401
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:33,904
Go on down to the sitting room.

1402
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:35,114
I'll be right down.

1403
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,198
Go on.

1404
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,325
Go on, please, aita.

1405
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:43,349
Wait. Wait a minute.

1406
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:46,018
Damn you to hell, Rafa! Stop!

1407
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,482
- Let go of me!
- Let me explain.

1408
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:52,441
I don't care.

1409
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,276
I'm going to Seville. Don't you get it?

1410
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,362
Let go of me!

1411
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:59,240
I'm sorry, I never thought this would go so far.

1412
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,242
- You knew.
- How could I know he'd stay?

1413
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,035
You knew this wouldn't work.

1414
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:04,954
Even if it had, you'd have sent me to Seville.

1415
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,705
I wish it had worked.

1416
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,666
But now we're in a mess.

1417
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,292
No, that's your problem.

1418
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,544
I can't take any more.

1419
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:13,462
Wait.

1420
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:15,965
We'll cancel the wedding.

1421
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,175
If we do, your father will kill me.

1422
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,302
I can't tell him all this now.

1423
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,972
If you like, I'll dump you, in front of everyone.

1424
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,308
<i>Ekerrik asko but agur.</i>

1425
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,727
All right, go and don't come back!

1426
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,521
I'm never coming back here again!

1427
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:33,274
I didn't ask you to come!
Who the fuck told you to come?

1428
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:58,883
The handle, the handle!

1429
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:19,528
Well...

1430
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:22,698
Go on.

1431
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:23,824
Come on.

1432
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:35,229
What time is it?

1433
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:36,605
No, it can't be!

1434
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:42,528
Fucking hell!

1435
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:44,196
<i>Aita?</i>

1436
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:46,365
<i>Epa. What are you two up to?</i>

1437
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:47,366
What?

1438
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,326
Haven't you left yet?

1439
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:52,121
Tell them it's all right if they don't come.

1440
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,000
<i>No, yesterday when you came back so late</i>

1441
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:58,252
<i>and making all that racket, I knew that...</i>

1442
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,713
Doing these things in a hurry is a bad idea.

1443
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:03,924
They can get married another day, or another year.

1444
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:06,760
Yes, we're leaving now. We're on our way.

1445
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:08,721
Where are we going? You're crazy, my love.

1446
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:10,681
Or shit, or fuck, or whatever.

1447
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:12,683
Tell them to forget about it.

1448
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,476
We insist on people marrying

1449
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,603
and maybe they shouldn't do it so much.

1450
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:19,440
Get a move on.

1451
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:22,192
The groom's family is here and they're a bit nervous.

1452
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:23,277
Obviously.

1453
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:25,446
What do you...? You're mixed up..

1454
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,532
No, Mikel and Aitor.

1455
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,827
<i>You didn't tell them about changing the church</i>

1456
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:34,455
and they happened to meet Anne.

1457
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:38,208
Don't tell him, but they seem a bit odd.

1458
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,418
They must be from Alava.

1459
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:41,420
They must be from the Clemente side.

1460
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:42,880
We'll see you in a minute.

1461
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,845
Well, your family has come.

1462
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:51,305
What family?

1463
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,807
I think Merche is messing it up.

1464
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:55,768
Listen, Amaia,

1465
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:58,812
you will jilt me at the wedding, won't you?

1466
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,317
Come on, let's go.

1467
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:21,085
<i>Alma!</i>

1468
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,224
- Are you all right?
- Yes, what are you doing here?

1469
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:36,266
Don't worry,

1470
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,394
we've got the ransom money, in 100 notes.

1471
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,436
Keep your voice down.

1472
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:41,939
We've got our code names: Mikel and Aitor.

1473
01:21:42,106 --> 01:21:43,232
No, Aitor and Mikel.

1474
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:44,274
Well, whatever.

1475
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:45,442
Who told you that?

1476
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:47,528
A woman who says she's your mother.
What happened?

1477
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,405
Did you succumb to violence?

1478
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,074
We marked the notes so we can break up the cell.

1479
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,033
Look,

1480
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,827
we're going, but we have to wait a minute.

1481
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:57,663
See? He's been brainwashed
by the nationalists.

1482
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,790
No, the three of us are going to Seville

1483
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:01,375
but we have to wait.

1484
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:03,085
All right.

1485
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,964
Your ama hasn't come and I don't think she's coming.

1486
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:07,756
No, I know.

1487
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,466
I knew this would happen.

1488
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:12,136
She heard you invited me and she got angry.

1489
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:13,846
She's always the same.

1490
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,556
Screw her and him.

1491
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:17,724
They can fuck off to El Rocio.

1492
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:21,019
But don't worry, they won't ruin our day.

1493
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,355
- Come on...
- You know, <i>aita,</i>

1494
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:25,607
these things, when you look at them...

1495
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,901
Weddings are a fuss about nothing.

1496
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:28,944
Yes.

1497
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,280
When I arrived, you both scared me.

1498
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:32,698
You were odd,

1499
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,159
but I've seen you together these days and...

1500
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:38,120
I know you, and I know when you really like someone.

1501
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:40,914
What would you know?

1502
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,291
How could I not know?

1503
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:43,709
<i>Amen, sweetheart,</i>

1504
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:45,502
yes, those six years are there.

1505
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:49,131
But I see you now and I know you're in love.

1506
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,925
Come on, let's get you married.

1507
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,892
I knew you'd win her over.

1508
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:02,978
Basques are like that, all independence,

1509
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,147
but, in the end, they love Spanish things.

1510
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:07,107
- There won't be a wedding.
- What?

1511
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:10,027
Fucking hell!

1512
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,988
Who are they, the T-bone terrorists?

1513
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:14,406
Don't worry.

1514
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:16,450
Amaia's going to jilt me.

1515
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,092
Brethren,

1516
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,347
we are gathered here to celebrate the wedding

1517
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:41,350
of Antxon...

1518
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:45,145
- That's right, isn't it? "Antxon".
- Yes. Antxon.

1519
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:48,315
- Are you sure?
- About what? My name?

1520
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:52,319
I'm asking because this has consequences with God...

1521
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,905
Not just with God, with Koldo.

1522
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:58,575
With the people of Argoitia, etc.

1523
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:00,786
Yes, I'm sure.

1524
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,454
We'll see if she is.

1525
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:03,330
What?

1526
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:06,375
I don't know. Are you sure?

1527
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:07,709
Why?

1528
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:11,797
I don't know, you don't look very sure.

1529
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:13,882
Amaia,

1530
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:20,055
do you take... Antxon
for your lawful wedded husband?

1531
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:26,812
- Amaia!
- In a minute, shit!

1532
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,492
I do.

1533
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:43,161
Damn.

1534
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:48,125
Antxon, do you take Amaia for your lawful wedded wife?

1535
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,168
Think carefully about the answer.

1536
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:54,047
If nothing else, we've got all the time in the world.

1537
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,470
- I can't.
- Great!

1538
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,347
If that's how it is,

1539
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:04,683
I'm sorry, I have to stop the ceremony.

1540
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:06,893
Hold your horses, Inaxio.

1541
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,146
What's wrong, Antxon?

1542
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:14,109
I'm not sure.

1543
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:17,279
No, you're nervous. That's normal.

1544
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:19,698
Amaia, talk to him.

1545
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:24,953
I'm sorry, Koldo.

1546
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:22,761
What the fuck are you doing?

1547
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:44,032
Anne!

1548
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:51,373
Anne...

1549
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:56,211
I knew I couldn't trust a Clemente.

1550
01:26:57,963 --> 01:26:59,423
Oh, Koldo...

1551
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,592
- There is no Clemente.
- What?

1552
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:05,178
And he isn't called Antxon.

1553
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:07,597
- Come off it!
- And I'm not called Anne.

1554
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:11,977
Now, you're going to tell me you're not even his mother.

1555
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:33,183
Christ!

1556
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:52,494
I think there were a few details I never told you.

1557
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:56,248
Yeah.

1558
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:53,054
<i>- Bai?
- Aita.</i>

1559
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:54,639
<i>Amaia...</i>

1560
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:58,101
We have to meet.

1561
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:01,062
<i>Yes, I have to talk to you, too.</i>

1562
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:02,606
Tonight?

1563
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:04,065
<i>OK. Agur.</i>

1564
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,535
Are you all right?

1565
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:19,122
I don't know.

1566
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,292
I guess it had to happen.

1567
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:24,419
Maybe not.

1568
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:27,714
Maybe it didn't have to happen.

1569
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:34,262
Let's just say I'm not very lucky with men.

1570
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:38,767
I told you I didn't want you
to make the same mistake I made.

1571
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:42,479
Yeah.

1572
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:44,981
I'm stupid.

1573
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:48,360
I'm sorry.

1574
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:52,197
I'm sorry about what happened, and it was all my fault.

1575
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:54,866
No, mine too, I was a bit naive,

1576
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:59,162
because he had a fucking terrible accent.

1577
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:04,209
But I guess I wanted it to be true.

1578
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:07,337
A family, kids, the whole thing.

1579
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:11,675
Anyway, take this.

1580
01:31:12,342 --> 01:31:13,426
It's for you.

1581
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,679
The money for the reception. There it is.

1582
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:17,180
What for?

1583
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:19,933
Amaia, take it.

1584
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,977
You know what to do with it.

1585
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,022
No, I don't want it.

1586
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:49,963
Amaia!

1587
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:52,799
You forgot this.

1588
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:54,634
No, I don't want it.

1589
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:57,929
Amaia, take it.

1590
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:04,519
<i>Agur.</i>

1591
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:06,021
<i>Agur.</i>

1592
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:23,121
Don't worry.

1593
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,832
I'll be waiting for you here in Argoitia.

1594
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:27,751
But, listen,

1595
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:31,921
don't bring me a grandchild who supports
Sevilla if you don't bring the father.

1596
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:34,758
And if it's Betis?

1597
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:38,094
Give me a fucking break.

1598
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:54,527
Today we're going to have stew.

1599
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:55,695
I'm serious, Rafa,

1600
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:57,322
they brainwashed you.

1601
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:58,789
I don't mean in the "literary" sense...

1602
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:02,702
Well, that too, because they took away your hair gel.

1603
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:04,913
I mean in how you see life,

1604
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,581
your philosophy, your development, your...

1605
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:08,333
Joaquin, we get the message.

1606
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:11,377
Pepito was the same after Iraq.

1607
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:14,714
It's not the same as Iraq.

1608
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,424
You've been there.

1609
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:24,641
Now you'll say the Basques are witty.

1610
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,310
They're not one bit funny.

1611
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,018
I know this is crazy,

1612
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:14,691
turning up like this, but don't speak.

1613
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:16,568
Let me talk, I've been thinking

1614
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:18,319
about what to say and I almost have it.

1615
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:21,364
Rafa,

1616
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:24,534
I think that we needed one more day.

1617
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:28,663
And this. I found it in the street.

1618
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:33,251
Say something. I'm really suffering.

1619
01:34:35,628 --> 01:34:37,422
Well...

1620
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:40,133
Seen like this, it is a bit corny.

1621
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,594
But does it work or not?

1622
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:48,808
Boss, will you head for Triana, please?

1623
01:34:48,975 --> 01:34:50,476
I have to talk to this girl.

1624
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:52,478
Is it far away?

1625
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:55,064
With the carriage and "Los del rio" and all,

1626
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:56,649
the wedding money's almost gone.

1627
01:34:58,276 --> 01:35:00,445
Be quiet. All this talking...

1628
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:02,270
