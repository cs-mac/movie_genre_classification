1
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:17,192
Senator, an attorney named
Peter Gersten has filed suit in Arizona,

2
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:20,571
alleging that there's a cover-up
regarding UFOs

3
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:23,407
and there has been
for dozens of years.

4
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:26,994
And millions of people have seen
these objects in the sky,

5
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:30,831
and the military continues to deny
that anything's going on.

6
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:34,251
Is that an area
that's of interest to you at all?

7
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:36,462
It's always of great interest to me.

8
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:40,507
I think it's of great interest.

9
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:46,055
I would point out to you that there was
a case a couple of years ago in Arizona

10
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:50,059
of some lights that were seen
over Arizona,

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,854
and that has never been
fully explained.

12
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,177
Come on!

13
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:35,724
Help me!

14
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:41,814
Help me!

15
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,482
Let me in!

16
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,693
Help me, someone!

17
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:48,696
Help me, please!

18
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:50,781
Let me in!

19
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:08,424
No!

20
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:49,256
Where the hell are we?

21
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:50,966
No shit, Matt.

22
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:53,260
You sure you're not
holding that upside-down?

23
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:56,263
It wasn't <i>my</i> idea
to take the back roads.

24
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:59,558
Explain to me again why we left
a perfectly good highway.

25
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,227
Your husband wanted to see
the country, remember?

26
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:06,774
I never said I wanted to crisscross
the asshole of America all day.

27
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:12,446
Would you give me that?

28
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,326
This thing's older
than my grandmother.

29
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,286
I'm surprised we made it <i>this</i> far.

30
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,038
You coulda stayed home.

31
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,415
What, and miss the adventure
of a lifetime?

32
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,834
Fuck you, and would you
get that out of my face?

33
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:27,878
Excuse me, ass breath.

34
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,590
Come on, June bug.
Give me a smile.

35
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:32,966
Give it a rest, Joe.

36
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:35,177
You're so beautiful on camera.

37
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:39,348
He's right. You were totally hot
in that video he showed me.

38
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:41,975
What video?

39
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:44,478
You didn't tell her
you had the camera on?

40
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,480
Matt, stop causing trouble.

41
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:48,148
Yeah, shut the fuck up, Matt.

42
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,693
No, don't shut up.
What video?

43
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:52,778
It was nothing.

44
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,198
You were in those pretty red garters,
down on all fours, while Joe was...

45
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,282
Matt!

46
00:05:57,324 --> 00:06:00,661
- He's full of shit!
- How'd he know about the garters?

47
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:03,372
Maybe because he was with me
when I bought 'em.

48
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:07,418
Come on, June, do you really think
I'd do something like that?

49
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,628
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

50
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:12,881
Fine.

51
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:15,884
I didn't show him.

52
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,846
I did.

53
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:20,806
What?

54
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:24,727
How else would he have known
we did it doggy style?

55
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:27,146
You sexy little bitch.
Come over here.

56
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,231
Oh, my God!

57
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:31,859
Stop! Goddamn!

58
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,031
Let us know
when we find a real road.

59
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:39,033
I don't care what you guys say.

60
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:40,492
This is the American dream.

61
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:43,454
Free to travel anywhere
without having to worry about hotels

62
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:45,414
or restaurants or reservations.

63
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:48,834
And there's a place to sleep while
you wait for the mechanic to fix it.

64
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:49,877
Right.

65
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,463
I did a damn good job
getting this thing up and running.

66
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:55,090
You know how much I saved?
New ones cost more than a house.

67
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:58,135
Which is what
we're supposed to be saving for.

68
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,721
What's that supposed to mean?

69
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,514
Exactly what I said.

70
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,099
What is your problem?

71
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:05,809
You've been moody this whole trip.

72
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:07,895
I don't wanna talk about it.

73
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:13,317
Even if I did, it's not like you'd listen.
I mean, why'd you even give me this?

74
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:16,403
Don't tell me we're having
that conversation again.

75
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:20,449
Why should we? We've been engaged
longer than most people are married.

76
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:22,951
What do you want me to do?
We're in the middle of nowhere.

77
00:07:22,993 --> 00:07:23,911
Forget it.

78
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:25,746
No, I got it. You want me
to call and see

79
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:29,958
if there's a preacher dressed as Elvis
ready to marry us at the casino.

80
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,422
What's the rush?

81
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:38,133
There's no rush.

82
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,803
Lilly.

83
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:44,640
Lighten up, Matt.

84
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:49,186
Hey, guys, who's got the "hootah"?

85
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:03,117
Careful, Joe!
You're gonna wake up Molly.

86
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:43,342
Don't go in there.
You might wake Sleeping Beauty.

87
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,553
Who could sleep
with all that banging?

88
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:48,639
What's up, girl?

89
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:55,729
- Hand it over, June bug.
- Hand over what?

90
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:59,608
Don't play stupid. The bet was
they couldn't make it the whole trip.

91
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,277
They couldn't even make it halfway.

92
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,531
What about double or nothin'?

93
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,449
You're on.

94
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:11,203
That's the closest thing to a sure bet
I'll have this whole trip.

95
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,955
Right on.

96
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:24,133
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

97
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:27,011
Find the right road yet?

98
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:29,930
We shoulda
hit the connector by now.

99
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:32,516
This thing's worthless.

100
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:35,436
You're figuring that out <i>now?</i>

101
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,438
It's time to admit you're lost.

102
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:40,107
We're not lost.
We're heading in the right direction.

103
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:42,693
This road has to connect
with the highway eventually.

104
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:45,029
Yeah, the highway to hell maybe.

105
00:11:01,378 --> 00:11:05,507
Is there anything in here
besides bologna and ketchup packs?

106
00:11:07,676 --> 00:11:10,721
Oh, God! That's disgusting!

107
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:14,475
Guess I'll eat later.

108
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:19,063
Hey, should one of us
check on Lilly?

109
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,398
Nah, she'll be okay.

110
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,111
It's not her fault that my brother
is a gigantic penis most of the time.

111
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,827
Tell me again why we didn't stop
at that restaurant on the freeway.

112
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:37,956
The bathroom on this thing isn't
big enough to handle the aftermath.

113
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,041
Joe!

114
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,834
You didn't hear what Matt said?

115
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:44,630
We don't need restaurants, hotels...
useless stuff like that.

116
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:46,173
Like hot food.

117
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:48,592
It's called roughing it, Mol.

118
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:51,178
Kinda like you
with your last boyfriend.

119
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,390
Oh, my God! Come on!
He was not that bad!

120
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:56,392
Yeah!

121
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,728
You okay?

122
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:08,737
Lilly?

123
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,079
What's up with Lilly?

124
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,257
Lilly?

125
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:53,782
<i> And so the time to repent is n...</i>

126
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:55,534
<i> for the Lord...</i>

127
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,286
<i> soon to claim us all.</i>

128
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:58,787
<i>I need your help.</i>

129
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:03,334
<i>I need</i> your <i>help to spread
His word, my brothers and sisters.</i>

130
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,919
<i>Are you really going to let $20</i>

131
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:10,424
<i>stand between you</i>
<i>and eternal salvation?</i>

132
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:14,762
<i>The damnation of your soul</i>
<i>is no joke.</i>

133
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:16,096
<i>And so the time to...</i>

134
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:17,431
Hey, Matt.

135
00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:19,975
Wanna hear a real joke?

136
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:21,268
A'ight.

137
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,897
Christopher Walken
goes into a bar and he says,

138
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:28,525
"What do you get
when you crossbreed a lesbian

139
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,527
with a hippopotamus?"

140
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:31,612
What?

141
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:34,365
"A lickalottapus."

142
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:38,160
"It's a huge tongue."

143
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:41,163
You've got problems.

144
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,339
What is that?

145
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:53,425
I don't know.
I thought you turned the radio off.

146
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,969
What was that noise?

147
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:07,022
You better hope we don't blow a tire,
or your ass will be changing it.

148
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,161
Lilly. Are you alive in there?

149
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,414
Yeah. I'll survive.

150
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,801
You guys see those lights?

151
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:38,178
What lights?

152
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,055
There they are again.

153
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:43,475
Oh, <i>those</i> lights.
Yeah! They're spectacular.

154
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:45,894
You're a fuckin' pervert,
you know that?

155
00:14:45,936 --> 00:14:47,938
Goddamn radio.

156
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,233
There, Joe, in the sky.

157
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,987
Oh, yeah.

158
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,489
There's one over there.

159
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:11,837
What are you all looking at?

160
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,591
Some lights outside.

161
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:21,096
They're easier to see in the back.
Come on.

162
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,494
Well, that must've been entertaining.

163
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,708
Jesus, how many of 'em are there?

164
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,751
What's going on?

165
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:52,961
Come here.
Check this out.

166
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,339
You see 'em?

167
00:15:58,592 --> 00:15:59,593
Please!

168
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:03,472
Come on, it's not like we're having
a close encounter or something.

169
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:05,391
Can you see 'em up in the sky?

170
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:10,270
Not yet, but I should be able to
once we get around this corner.

171
00:16:17,194 --> 00:16:19,196
There. You see 'em?
They're right there.

172
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:21,156
Yeah, I see 'em.

173
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,784
Matt, watch the road!

174
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,706
Will you relax?

175
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:05,159
Matt.

176
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,287
Matt!

177
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:47,076
Lilly. Are you okay?

178
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:53,415
- June! You all right?
- Yeah.

179
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,793
Molly!

180
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,378
Molly, you all right?

181
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,673
What the hell do <i>you</i> think?
Of course I'm not okay!

182
00:18:00,673 --> 00:18:02,675
What the hell just happened?

183
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:05,219
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

184
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,262
Where are you going?

185
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:12,059
Hey! You guys okay?

186
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:21,402
You almost got us killed, asshole!
Why'd you park in the road?

187
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:23,779
What are you so pissed about?

188
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:26,448
How could you not see the flares?

189
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,950
- Fuck you!
- Matt, stop it.

190
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:28,867
Fuck you!

191
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:32,371
Matt! Matt! Joe's hurt.
Get in here.

192
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:34,790
This ain't over.

193
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:42,798
- How did this happen?
- He landed on it when you wrecked!

194
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,050
It was an accident!

195
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:51,265
Oh, my God.

196
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:56,854
- Pull it out.
- How? I'm not a fucking doctor.

197
00:18:57,187 --> 00:18:59,314
Pull it out.

198
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:04,528
Fine. Hand me the towel.

199
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:08,490
Put this over it as soon as I pull it out.

200
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,242
Got it.

201
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:14,288
Oh, God!

202
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:24,006
It's okay. It's okay.

203
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:46,403
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

204
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:49,698
Why? Are you a doctor?

205
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,618
I'm not a doctor, but I had
some medical training in the Army.

206
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,828
"Some" training?

207
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:58,040
Some training's better
than no training.

208
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,626
Please help us.

209
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:03,587
Fine, let G.I. Joe do it.

210
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:06,256
Name's Richard.

211
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:11,470
Okay. Let's take a look at this.

212
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:15,474
Can you get it out?

213
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:18,352
Right now,
this knife is his best friend.

214
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:20,521
What the fuck are you talking about?

215
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:24,817
If this nicked an artery and we pull it,
there's no way to stop the bleeding.

216
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:25,984
What?

217
00:20:26,026 --> 00:20:29,571
Calm down. It doesn't look
as though it's hit anything vital.

218
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:32,324
It looks worse than it is.

219
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:34,535
It looks pretty bad from where I'm at.

220
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:37,830
I'm gonna stop the bleeding,
and then we'll worry about the knife.

221
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:38,664
Okay, Joe?

222
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:42,376
And how the hell
do you plan on doing that, <i>Dick?</i>

223
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:45,963
Well, a first aid kit
will be a good place to start.

224
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:49,091
Here.

225
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:51,218
Can you hold this for me?

226
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:54,096
No, no.
I don't think so.

227
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:55,848
I'll do it!

228
00:20:55,848 --> 00:20:57,516
Push hard, even if it hurts.

229
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:59,560
Have you got a sewing kit?

230
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:01,353
Anything with a needle and thread.

231
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:02,604
No, we don't.

232
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:04,440
Okay, how about alcohol?

233
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,858
You have any vodka?

234
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:08,736
Whiskey?
Anything like that?

235
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,283
You'll be okay, baby.

236
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:24,001
Where the hell is Matt? Matt!

237
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:27,671
We got a problem.

238
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:30,424
We don't have a first aid kit?

239
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:32,634
Oh, Jesus, Matt!

240
00:21:32,885 --> 00:21:35,137
- I forgot, all right?
- No, it's not all right!

241
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:36,388
I didn't do it on purpose!

242
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,807
I don't care whose fault it is.
Joe needs help!

243
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:41,143
Okay, everyone, relax.

244
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:46,231
I can fix him up, but I'm gonna need
to clean the wound first.

245
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:48,067
Now, get him up.

246
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:49,777
Hang in there, Joe.

247
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:51,653
Come on, okay.

248
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:53,322
It's okay, Joe. Okay, okay.

249
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:55,532
- Can you hold him?
- Okay.

250
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:59,286
Hold this arm over there.
Okay, okay.

251
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:00,788
Here we go.

252
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:02,539
All right.

253
00:22:06,085 --> 00:22:07,586
I got a bottle of vodka

254
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:11,006
that I've been waiting
to get rid of in my truck.

255
00:22:11,632 --> 00:22:13,717
Let's move the arm now.

256
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,804
See if you can get Joe on the bed
while I'm gone.

257
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:18,764
Keep his arm by his side,

258
00:22:18,764 --> 00:22:21,600
and don't let anything
touch that knife, got it?

259
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,143
- Got it.
- Okay, good.

260
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:25,354
Okay. There.

261
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:32,486
You, hold on to this for me
until I get back.

262
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:35,030
Superglue?

263
00:22:35,072 --> 00:22:37,282
What are we supposed to do
with Superglue?

264
00:22:37,324 --> 00:22:39,535
Shut up!

265
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:10,649
- Where do you want this?
- Right there.

266
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:12,860
Lean back a bit, baby.

267
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,744
This is too much for me.

268
00:23:22,745 --> 00:23:24,496
Oh, no. I don't wanna see this.

269
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:25,664
Here.

270
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:28,167
- Here.
- Is that for me?

271
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,211
Yeah, but you're not gonna like it
as much as you think you are.

272
00:23:31,253 --> 00:23:33,505
- Hold him.
- Why does she have...

273
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:35,507
- Mother...!
- Take it easy, man!

274
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:39,303
Gotta disinfect the wound.
This gets infected, he'll be hatin' life.

275
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,305
Give me that.

276
00:23:41,347 --> 00:23:45,225
It's gonna do me more good
on the inside right now.

277
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:48,437
Easy with that.

278
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,272
Give me the Superglue.

279
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:59,865
Superglue was invented
for surgery, all right?

280
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:02,951
Superglue and duct tape?
To seal up a wound like that?

281
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:04,745
It's all we got.

282
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:17,925
There. That oughtta hold it.

283
00:24:17,966 --> 00:24:20,386
What about the knife?

284
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:24,723
We'll leave it right where it is
until you get him to an emergency room.

285
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:29,687
I'm gonna try my cell.

286
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:33,148
Okay.

287
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,359
Now get the arm.

288
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:47,538
What else can we do?

289
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:50,290
- Give me that blanket.
- It's okay, baby.

290
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:55,796
Keep his arm and the knife immobilized
till you get him to a hospital.

291
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,466
It's gonna be okay.
Thank you.

292
00:24:59,508 --> 00:25:01,677
No problem.

293
00:25:05,723 --> 00:25:07,016
I'd keep him warm.

294
00:25:07,057 --> 00:25:09,685
Come get me if anything changes.

295
00:25:15,357 --> 00:25:20,654
You should know she acts
like more of a slut than she really is.

296
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:35,377
Joe's gonna be fine.

297
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:36,462
Matt?

298
00:25:36,503 --> 00:25:40,132
You guys go have fun while I try
and get us the hell out of here.

299
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:47,890
Hey, you were pretty great in there.

300
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,725
Wanna celebrate?

301
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:51,560
No, thanks.

302
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:54,021
Six years without a drop.

303
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,483
So much for the party.

304
00:25:57,524 --> 00:25:59,234
A. A?

305
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,237
Kind of ruins the anonymous part,
but yeah,

306
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,823
and a couple other programs
along the way.

307
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:08,327
So, what, did you just, like,
party too much in the Army?

308
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:11,455
Well, that's one way to put it.

309
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:15,125
Let's just say I let things
get away from me, but I'm better now,

310
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:18,003
and people say I'm a better man for it.

311
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,505
Are you?

312
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:22,299
I was pretty damn good
to start with.

313
00:26:22,466 --> 00:26:25,219
Well, I'm Lilly, by the way.

314
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:30,516
And... you already met
my boyfriend Matt.

315
00:26:30,557 --> 00:26:32,184
That's one way of putting it.

316
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:33,727
I'm glad to meet <i>you,</i> Lilly.

317
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:35,979
And I'm Molly.

318
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:39,149
- No husband, no boyfriend.
- That so?

319
00:26:58,127 --> 00:26:59,670
Oh, my God. Yuck.

320
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,046
What?

321
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:03,632
There's blood on my shirt.

322
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:08,846
You're freaking out over this?
You can't even see it.

323
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:13,976
You know what,
your lip's bleeding.

324
00:27:14,184 --> 00:27:15,936
Here.

325
00:27:17,646 --> 00:27:20,357
God, the moon looks bright out here.

326
00:27:22,568 --> 00:27:24,445
I don't see those lights anymore.

327
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:26,030
You know, maybe later.

328
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:28,073
I gotta get my truck out of the road.

329
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:29,408
Good idea.

330
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,578
We wouldn't want someone
to have a wreck, now, would we?

331
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:33,620
You know what...

332
00:27:33,662 --> 00:27:35,581
Just don't listen to him, okay?

333
00:27:35,622 --> 00:27:37,458
Come on, let's go.

334
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:41,295
We need to talk.

335
00:27:41,337 --> 00:27:43,130
You're telling me?

336
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:47,092
I can understand Molly getting excited
about meeting a new guy, but you?

337
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:49,011
Jesus, Matt, would you stop?

338
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:50,095
His name's Richard.

339
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:53,432
I wouldn't have had to do that
if you weren't thinking with your fists.

340
00:27:53,474 --> 00:27:56,185
Is that it? You're still pissed
'cause I decked him?

341
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:57,686
Who is that guy, anyway?

342
00:27:57,728 --> 00:27:59,605
Oh, just some guy who saved Joe.

343
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:03,400
Yeah, well, you should stop
trusting people so much.

344
00:28:03,442 --> 00:28:05,694
Don't walk away from me, Matt.

345
00:28:05,736 --> 00:28:08,655
You're not gonna do this to me again.

346
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:09,823
Do what?

347
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:12,284
End another conversation
with your feet.

348
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:14,328
Give me a break.
You saw the guy's wrists.

349
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,040
It looked like he tried to kill himself
more than once. He's a mental case.

350
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:19,833
Why are you so paranoid about him?

351
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:22,461
I'm worried about you. That's all.

352
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:24,463
Right, right.

353
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:26,256
What?

354
00:28:26,674 --> 00:28:28,842
You hardly even
pay attention to me anymore.

355
00:28:28,884 --> 00:28:31,428
That's not true.

356
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:35,224
You spent every weekend for
the past two months working on this.

357
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:36,600
It's like I don't exist.

358
00:28:36,642 --> 00:28:40,312
I bought the RV for us, so we could
spend more time together.

359
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:42,189
You got it for you and Joe.

360
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:44,483
So now your problem's
with my friends?

361
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:46,318
I didn't say that.

362
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,569
You meant it.

363
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:50,531
I don't understand why you're
freaked out about a fucking RV.

364
00:28:50,572 --> 00:28:53,325
I'm not freaked out
about the stupid RV.

365
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,744
Then what do you want me to do?

366
00:28:57,496 --> 00:28:58,497
Nothing.

367
00:28:58,539 --> 00:28:59,957
Fine. Can I go back to work?

368
00:28:59,998 --> 00:29:03,669
The sooner we get out of here,
the sooner we can get Joe help.

369
00:29:03,711 --> 00:29:06,005
Yeah. Do whatever you want.

370
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:08,257
You always do.

371
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:17,641
It's weird.
Power just went out on me.

372
00:29:17,683 --> 00:29:21,270
Well, the miracle is
it ran for this long.

373
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:28,485
Either your truck
or Matt's RV better start soon.

374
00:29:28,527 --> 00:29:31,321
I got a massage appointment in Vegas
I am not gonna miss.

375
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:33,407
We couldn't have that.

376
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:41,790
That's progress, though.

377
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:45,002
The radio wouldn't even work
this morning.

378
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:49,256
Well, looks like
the massage is on me.

379
00:29:52,217 --> 00:29:54,928
Things could be worse.

380
00:29:56,597 --> 00:29:59,641
Well, we better get this thing
out of the road.

381
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:03,312
- You drive.
- Okay.

382
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:30,297
So, tell me more about Richard.

383
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:32,299
Not much to tell, I guess.

384
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:34,176
I was born and raised in Texas,

385
00:30:34,218 --> 00:30:37,179
played football at high school.

386
00:30:37,221 --> 00:30:39,264
Joined the Army to see the world.

387
00:30:39,306 --> 00:30:41,475
What was it like?

388
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:43,560
The Army or the world?

389
00:30:44,895 --> 00:30:46,647
Both.

390
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,108
Big and scary.

391
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:51,485
And lonely.

392
00:30:53,237 --> 00:30:54,613
Were you in that war?

393
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:56,573
Desert Storm?

394
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,743
Yep, I was there.

395
00:31:00,536 --> 00:31:02,996
Did you ever kill anybody?

396
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:05,708
Yeah.

397
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:09,753
I guess that kinda helps explain

398
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:13,090
some of the bad stuff
that's happened in my life.

399
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:15,843
It's okay.

400
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:18,220
You could tell me the bad stuff.

401
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:25,310
I was a POW.

402
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:28,147
Spent a couple of weeks
being convinced by the Iraqis

403
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:30,899
to tell 'em everything I knew.

404
00:31:31,817 --> 00:31:34,445
I was pretty much dead.

405
00:31:36,864 --> 00:31:39,783
They, uh... beat me.

406
00:31:39,825 --> 00:31:42,870
Cut me, shot me, burned me.

407
00:31:42,911 --> 00:31:46,206
They hung me by my wrists
while they did it.

408
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,167
Jesus.

409
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:52,713
Now, you tell Uncle Sam that,
and he'll say I wasn't even there.

410
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:57,551
But I got the scars
that say otherwise.

411
00:31:58,344 --> 00:32:02,723
Makes me being prom queen
sound pretty pathetic now.

412
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:08,062
I don't think you turned out so bad.

413
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:13,233
Anyway, I healed up pretty good.

414
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:16,320
I got hooked on morphine doing it.

415
00:32:17,154 --> 00:32:20,949
It's pretty easy
to fall into a bottle after that.

416
00:32:21,617 --> 00:32:25,829
Got my release, spent a couple of years
bouncing around Europe.

417
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:28,415
But I fought back.

418
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,584
Got a lot of help.

419
00:32:30,626 --> 00:32:33,671
But in the end,
it was all up here.

420
00:32:34,463 --> 00:32:37,299
Just me against myself.

421
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:40,803
Who won?

422
00:32:42,054 --> 00:32:44,139
I did.

423
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:19,133
Fuck!

424
00:33:28,058 --> 00:33:29,768
Lilly?

425
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:33,313
I have been spending
too much time...

426
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:38,569
Lilly?

427
00:34:04,345 --> 00:34:06,055
Lilly.

428
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:15,230
Lilly?

429
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,876
Lilly.

430
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:39,880
Lilly!

431
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:42,771
How's Joe?

432
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:45,441
Sleeping, finally.

433
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:49,403
He was hurting so bad.

434
00:37:56,118 --> 00:37:58,912
It's gonna be fine, June.

435
00:37:59,913 --> 00:38:02,541
I'm sure Matt will have us
on the road soon.

436
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:06,003
Okay? He didn't mean
for this to happen.

437
00:38:08,714 --> 00:38:10,424
I know.

438
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:13,761
It's j...

439
00:38:13,802 --> 00:38:15,888
It's just so freakin' frustrating,

440
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:18,223
knowing that everything
we need is, like,

441
00:38:18,265 --> 00:38:21,935
20 or 30 miles away
where we can't get to it.

442
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:29,276
I'm gonna go check
and see what's up, okay?

443
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:45,542
We might as well be
on the fucking moon.

444
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:53,467
Matt?

445
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:18,200
- Jesus!
- Sorry.

446
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:19,952
God!

447
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:21,704
What are you doing back here?

448
00:39:21,745 --> 00:39:23,288
I was gonna ask the same thing.

449
00:39:23,288 --> 00:39:24,998
I was looking for you.

450
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,376
You found me.

451
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:29,962
Where the hell were you?

452
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:34,341
I... thought I saw something.

453
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:37,636
Look, I'm sorry. I was
a complete jerk to you earlier.

454
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:39,847
I can understand it if you hate me.

455
00:39:39,888 --> 00:39:42,182
You know I don't hate you.

456
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,229
I was just pissed off and scared,
and I took it out on you.

457
00:39:47,604 --> 00:39:49,398
I know. It's just...

458
00:39:49,398 --> 00:39:52,693
you seem to be
doing that a lot these days.

459
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:55,237
I'm sorry.

460
00:40:05,956 --> 00:40:08,250
Actually, there's something else.

461
00:40:08,292 --> 00:40:11,503
I know. As soon as we get back,
I'll sell this piece of crap...

462
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:15,674
and put the money in savings.
- That's not what I was gonna say.

463
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:20,512
What?

464
00:40:23,974 --> 00:40:27,019
I need to tell you that...

465
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,189
Lilly?

466
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,066
Lilly!

467
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:44,078
I can't wake up Joe.

468
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:48,457
Joe.

469
00:40:48,499 --> 00:40:50,751
Joe, wake up, buddy!

470
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:01,845
Hang in there, pal.

471
00:41:01,845 --> 00:41:04,098
You better go get Richard.

472
00:41:06,558 --> 00:41:09,478
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, but it looks bad.

473
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,772
Let me see.

474
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:20,614
Come on, Joe.

475
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:27,830
You said he'd be all right.

476
00:41:27,871 --> 00:41:29,748
He should be.

477
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:40,718
His breathing's shallow but okay.

478
00:41:41,093 --> 00:41:43,971
Let me check this.

479
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:49,893
What are you doing?

480
00:41:52,146 --> 00:41:56,567
His abdomen would be hard if there
was internal bleeding, but it seems fine.

481
00:41:57,026 --> 00:41:59,236
Then what's wrong with him?

482
00:41:59,695 --> 00:42:01,280
What the hell is wrong with him?

483
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,323
I don't know.

484
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:07,911
He might be going into shock.

485
00:42:16,503 --> 00:42:18,922
I need to look at the wound.

486
00:42:19,715 --> 00:42:21,675
Help me get him up.

487
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:23,677
Gently, gently.

488
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:28,849
Oh, hell.

489
00:42:33,312 --> 00:42:35,272
Holy shit!

490
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:39,401
Looks like it did
hit an artery after all.

491
00:42:40,652 --> 00:42:43,155
You said he'd be okay.

492
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:49,119
What should we do?

493
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:53,916
We need to get him to a hospital,
that's what we need to do.

494
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:57,127
You have any luck with this thing?

495
00:42:57,461 --> 00:42:59,963
This thing ain't goin' anywhere.

496
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:04,093
What about your truck?

497
00:43:04,134 --> 00:43:05,219
No.

498
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,388
Has anyone been able
to get a cell signal?

499
00:43:07,429 --> 00:43:10,683
Cell phones aren't gonna work here.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

500
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:12,685
Shit.

501
00:43:13,394 --> 00:43:15,396
You gotta try something else.

502
00:43:15,437 --> 00:43:18,148
I can't do anything
without a surgeon.

503
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:20,693
Fuck. Fuck!

504
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:23,946
Matt! Matt, what are we
supposed to do?

505
00:43:25,948 --> 00:43:27,991
I'm goin' to get help.

506
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:31,286
Wait. No! From where?

507
00:43:31,328 --> 00:43:34,373
I don't know. There's gotta be
a gas station or something.

508
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:35,916
Maybe I can flag down a car.

509
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:38,669
We're in the middle of nowhere.
You said so yourself.

510
00:43:38,711 --> 00:43:41,422
We can't just stand here
and watch Joe bleed to death.

511
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:43,424
We gotta try something.

512
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,885
Power lines.

513
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:49,471
What?

514
00:43:50,222 --> 00:43:52,057
I saw power lines over by my truck,

515
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:54,268
leadin' over here into the woods.

516
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:56,729
Yeah, this dirt road's
gotta go somewhere.

517
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,772
Maybe there's a house
over in the woods.

518
00:43:58,814 --> 00:44:00,399
Or there might not be anything.

519
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:01,900
I've gotta try.

520
00:44:01,942 --> 00:44:04,319
You, you're comin' with me.

521
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,155
I don't think
that will be a good idea.

522
00:44:06,196 --> 00:44:09,199
- There's no time to argue about it.
- Matt.

523
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:21,337
Hey, do you think it's a good idea

524
00:44:21,378 --> 00:44:23,422
to be runnin' off
into the woods with him?

525
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:26,258
And I thought I was
the paranoid one, remember?

526
00:44:26,258 --> 00:44:29,053
It's just the two of you
don't get along real well.

527
00:44:29,094 --> 00:44:30,846
I thought you didn't trust him.

528
00:44:30,888 --> 00:44:34,725
I don't, which is why I want him
with me and not here with you.

529
00:44:35,017 --> 00:44:36,894
I'll be fine.

530
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:43,442
- Baby, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

531
00:44:43,442 --> 00:44:45,319
I'll be right back.

532
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,410
Ready?

533
00:44:53,452 --> 00:44:55,287
Wait. What else can I do for Joe?

534
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:58,665
Give him some blankets
and keep him warm.

535
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,335
Matt.

536
00:45:01,377 --> 00:45:05,172
Lilly, everything's going to be all right.
We'll talk later, I promise.

537
00:45:05,214 --> 00:45:07,091
Okay.

538
00:45:21,105 --> 00:45:25,275
The line goes off
into the woods... over there.

539
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:32,533
Let's go.

540
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:38,872
We're gonna get you help, baby.
Gonna get you help.

541
00:45:38,914 --> 00:45:41,709
I'm not leaving you, Joe.

542
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:44,253
Joe.

543
00:45:46,422 --> 00:45:48,590
Please, God, don't die.

544
00:45:48,632 --> 00:45:51,552
We're getting you help, okay?

545
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,563
How long do you think
they'll be gone?

546
00:46:02,938 --> 00:46:04,106
It won't be long.

547
00:46:04,148 --> 00:46:07,401
God, I hate just sitting here like this.

548
00:46:07,901 --> 00:46:10,487
I feel so useless.

549
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:17,161
Looks like you and Matt
kissed and made up.

550
00:46:17,745 --> 00:46:20,581
Yeah, once he realized
what a jerk he was being.

551
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:26,086
So did you tell him yet?

552
00:46:26,211 --> 00:46:27,421
Tell him what?

553
00:46:27,463 --> 00:46:29,590
That you're pregnant.

554
00:46:31,425 --> 00:46:34,094
Yeah, I'm not as stupid as I act.

555
00:46:35,346 --> 00:46:37,473
So how late are you?

556
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:40,976
Three months.

557
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,604
Is it Matt's?

558
00:46:44,229 --> 00:46:45,856
Of course it's Matt's.

559
00:46:45,898 --> 00:46:47,316
Then how come he doesn't know?

560
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:50,569
Because I can't imagine
how he'll react.

561
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:53,572
Yeah, well, he's gonna
find out sooner or later.

562
00:46:53,614 --> 00:46:56,992
I know, I know, but that's okay.

563
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:00,329
I feel like I can tell him now,
you know?

564
00:47:06,794 --> 00:47:08,962
There's something ahead.

565
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:12,299
Hope they're home.

566
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:16,220
What the hell is that noise?

567
00:47:16,428 --> 00:47:18,305
I don't know.

568
00:47:18,597 --> 00:47:20,808
Sounds electrical.

569
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,855
So what's the story
between you and Lilly?

570
00:47:26,897 --> 00:47:28,982
- No story.
- Come on.

571
00:47:29,024 --> 00:47:31,735
Bet you two have been together
since high school.

572
00:47:31,777 --> 00:47:33,612
Try third grade.

573
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:35,781
I remember
my third-grade sweetheart.

574
00:47:35,823 --> 00:47:38,992
Her name was Monica.
Turned into a stripper.

575
00:47:39,034 --> 00:47:41,203
Biggest set of tits
I've ever seen in my life.

576
00:47:41,245 --> 00:47:44,540
Of course, she wouldn't give me
the time of day when...

577
00:47:49,128 --> 00:47:51,005
Matt?

578
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:58,429
Matt!

579
00:47:59,388 --> 00:48:01,098
Matt!

580
00:48:03,058 --> 00:48:05,269
Where the hell are you?

581
00:48:08,313 --> 00:48:11,191
Don't pull this bullshit on me!

582
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:29,293
Matt.

583
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,309
Matt.

584
00:48:47,061 --> 00:48:48,896
Matt.

585
00:49:01,992 --> 00:49:04,119
Jesus!

586
00:49:11,335 --> 00:49:13,545
No, no.

587
00:49:13,587 --> 00:49:15,464
No, no, no.

588
00:49:15,506 --> 00:49:17,007
Matt. Matt.

589
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:19,718
No, no. Stay with me, Matt.

590
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,013
Matt. Matt?

591
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:28,769
Oh, God.

592
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:32,106
No, no, Matt.

593
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:38,028
No. Oh, God.

594
00:50:11,145 --> 00:50:12,604
Was that a gunshot?

595
00:50:12,646 --> 00:50:13,772
I don't know.

596
00:50:13,814 --> 00:50:15,983
Sounded like it.

597
00:50:31,749 --> 00:50:34,001
Get inside!

598
00:50:34,168 --> 00:50:35,294
Where's Matt?

599
00:50:35,336 --> 00:50:36,962
Get inside the RV now!

600
00:50:37,004 --> 00:50:39,757
But... but...

601
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:46,221
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

602
00:50:46,805 --> 00:50:48,682
I wanna know
where Matt is right now!

603
00:50:48,724 --> 00:50:50,684
We need to get outta here.

604
00:50:52,978 --> 00:50:55,564
Did you bring help?

605
00:50:55,856 --> 00:50:58,025
Is someone out there?

606
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:00,986
Hey!

607
00:51:01,028 --> 00:51:04,281
- Get away from the window!
- What the hell?

608
00:51:04,573 --> 00:51:06,492
Everyone, stay away
from the windows!

609
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:09,078
Whose blood is that?

610
00:51:14,124 --> 00:51:17,252
What happened to my brother?

611
00:51:25,678 --> 00:51:26,887
I need a hammer!

612
00:51:26,929 --> 00:51:28,847
Nails!

613
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:32,059
- You're fuckin' insane.
- I wish.

614
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,603
Fuck!

615
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:36,772
Listen to me!
We haven't got much time.

616
00:51:36,814 --> 00:51:39,900
- Whatever those things are...
- What? What's out there?

617
00:51:39,942 --> 00:51:42,111
I don't know!

618
00:51:43,737 --> 00:51:45,572
What the fuck do you know?

619
00:51:45,614 --> 00:51:48,117
What the fuck
do you know, asshole?

620
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:52,037
I know my husband is dying!

621
00:51:52,329 --> 00:51:54,206
My husband is dying
ten feet from me.

622
00:51:54,248 --> 00:51:56,291
It's all your fucking fault!

623
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,085
It's all your fault!

624
00:51:58,127 --> 00:52:01,130
Son of a bitch!
You're gonna kill Joe!

625
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:04,299
He's my life!

626
00:52:06,593 --> 00:52:09,138
Richard. Richard, please.

627
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:12,099
Please just tell me
what happened. Please.

628
00:52:45,632 --> 00:52:48,010
Snap out of it.

629
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:58,187
Joe! Oh, no!

630
00:52:59,146 --> 00:53:02,107
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be okay, baby.

631
00:53:02,149 --> 00:53:04,068
Just hold on.

632
00:53:07,154 --> 00:53:08,989
You never answered me.

633
00:53:09,323 --> 00:53:10,783
Whose blood is that?

634
00:53:10,824 --> 00:53:13,869
It's not what you think.

635
00:53:14,453 --> 00:53:16,705
What did you do?

636
00:53:17,122 --> 00:53:18,290
You don't understand.

637
00:53:18,332 --> 00:53:21,543
So then answer
the fucking question.

638
00:53:21,585 --> 00:53:24,713
There's not even any goddamn
flares in this piece of shit!

639
00:53:24,755 --> 00:53:26,215
Would you stop, okay?

640
00:53:26,256 --> 00:53:28,801
Just tell us what happened.

641
00:53:29,885 --> 00:53:32,304
We found a cabin
about a quarter mile from here

642
00:53:32,346 --> 00:53:33,889
on the other side of the hill.

643
00:53:33,931 --> 00:53:37,476
We were walkin' up the driveway,
and then all of a sudden they...

644
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:39,019
What?

645
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:40,979
He just disappeared!

646
00:53:41,021 --> 00:53:42,731
He was gone. I don't...

647
00:53:42,773 --> 00:53:45,484
- What do you mean he was gone?
- He's still out there?

648
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:48,153
You left my brother
alone out there?

649
00:53:48,195 --> 00:53:49,321
He's not out there.

650
00:53:49,363 --> 00:53:51,907
But that doesn't make any sense.

651
00:53:52,241 --> 00:53:55,411
Believe me,
I know how it sounds.

652
00:53:55,452 --> 00:53:56,829
We're gonna go find Matt.

653
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,372
I can't let you go out there.

654
00:53:58,414 --> 00:54:01,083
Trust me.
He is not outside.

655
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:04,336
Jesus, those were
gunshots we heard.

656
00:54:04,378 --> 00:54:06,588
Who are you?

657
00:54:08,507 --> 00:54:10,217
What is that?

658
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,595
Listen to me.
There's something out there.

659
00:54:13,637 --> 00:54:15,764
I'm begging you to believe me.

660
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:18,934
I didn't shoot him.
I swear I didn't.

661
00:54:19,852 --> 00:54:21,020
You killed him.

662
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:23,397
No. I was close enough
to touch it.

663
00:54:23,439 --> 00:54:25,357
I saw its face.
It wasn't Matt.

664
00:54:25,399 --> 00:54:28,569
It wasn't human.
You have to believe me!

665
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:31,280
Oh, fuck! Just...

666
00:54:34,783 --> 00:54:37,828
Why won't it stop?

667
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:41,790
Listen. What's that?

668
00:54:41,832 --> 00:54:43,834
What's what?
I can't hear anything.

669
00:54:43,876 --> 00:54:46,503
- Just listen.
<i>... kill me!</i>

670
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:49,757
That's Matt.

671
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,387
I can't see anything.

672
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:58,182
Molly, get the lights.

673
00:55:03,604 --> 00:55:05,272
It can't be Matt.

674
00:55:05,314 --> 00:55:08,484
- Do you see him?
- I can't see him.

675
00:55:08,776 --> 00:55:10,569
Fuck!

676
00:55:14,698 --> 00:55:15,741
It's Matt.

677
00:55:15,783 --> 00:55:17,951
It's Matt! He's outside!

678
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,205
Help me. Hello?

679
00:55:21,246 --> 00:55:22,498
Fuck, fuck!

680
00:55:22,539 --> 00:55:24,541
Please help me.

681
00:55:26,377 --> 00:55:28,212
He's outside.

682
00:55:28,754 --> 00:55:29,922
Where?

683
00:55:29,963 --> 00:55:31,965
Out by the road.

684
00:55:32,841 --> 00:55:35,928
No, you can't go out.
It's not Matt.

685
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:37,680
Matt is out there.

686
00:55:41,892 --> 00:55:43,352
- Let me go!
- No! Stay here!

687
00:55:43,394 --> 00:55:45,396
Matt?

688
00:55:46,313 --> 00:55:48,524
Matt!

689
00:55:53,028 --> 00:55:55,197
Where are you?

690
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:57,157
Molly.

691
00:55:59,493 --> 00:56:01,578
Molly, help me.

692
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:09,211
Molly!

693
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:16,176
Get inside!

694
00:56:24,351 --> 00:56:25,853
What just happened?

695
00:56:25,894 --> 00:56:28,397
I wish I knew.

696
00:56:57,885 --> 00:57:00,054
Stay down!

697
00:57:43,097 --> 00:57:45,140
Maybe they're gone.

698
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:51,021
What?

699
00:57:51,438 --> 00:57:53,273
Oh, God!

700
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:55,651
Did you see its eyes?

701
00:58:40,529 --> 00:58:42,531
We gotta get outta here.

702
00:58:42,573 --> 00:58:44,366
We can't go out there.

703
00:58:44,408 --> 00:58:46,493
We gotta find our way
to the cabin.

704
00:58:46,535 --> 00:58:49,204
What about Joe?

705
00:58:50,622 --> 00:58:52,583
I'll carry him.

706
00:58:57,671 --> 00:58:59,715
Where's my gun?

707
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,474
Lilly.

708
00:59:11,894 --> 00:59:14,063
Joe's not breathing.

709
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,151
No!

710
00:59:38,128 --> 00:59:40,339
Come on, Joe! Come on!

711
00:59:40,714 --> 00:59:43,509
Joe, come on!

712
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:52,643
Oh, God! Oh, God!

713
01:01:04,465 --> 01:01:06,592
Help me!

714
01:01:06,633 --> 01:01:08,677
Help me.

715
01:01:14,725 --> 01:01:16,602
Help me!

716
01:01:16,643 --> 01:01:18,479
Help me!

717
01:01:22,149 --> 01:01:24,151
Help me!

718
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:27,780
Help me!

719
01:01:29,656 --> 01:01:32,242
Let me in!

720
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:42,419
Help!

721
01:01:43,337 --> 01:01:44,797
Look at me!

722
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:46,840
Look at me, Lilly!

723
01:01:47,132 --> 01:01:49,051
Look at me.

724
01:01:50,177 --> 01:01:52,721
They're gettin' into our heads,

725
01:01:52,763 --> 01:01:54,223
makin' us see things,

726
01:01:54,264 --> 01:01:56,100
hear things.

727
01:01:57,726 --> 01:01:59,895
You hear me?

728
01:02:00,938 --> 01:02:04,608
Okay. Okay.

729
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:10,239
I'm gonna find the light, okay?
Stay with me.

730
01:02:12,116 --> 01:02:14,451
Okay.

731
01:02:16,453 --> 01:02:18,288
Stay with me.

732
01:02:39,893 --> 01:02:42,104
I don't believe this.

733
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,941
What the hell
are we supposed to do now?

734
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:57,202
- Give me a hand.
- What's the use?

735
01:02:57,244 --> 01:02:59,455
Lilly!

736
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:03,250
Look, I know you're scared.

737
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,129
But if we're gonna
get through this,

738
01:03:07,171 --> 01:03:09,214
you gotta help me.

739
01:03:09,256 --> 01:03:11,800
I can't do it alone.

740
01:03:13,427 --> 01:03:15,304
Please.

741
01:03:16,096 --> 01:03:17,973
Please.

742
01:03:25,564 --> 01:03:28,776
Okay. Over by the door.

743
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:48,379
So that wasn't Matt we heard.

744
01:03:49,004 --> 01:03:50,714
No.

745
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,010
But I saw him.

746
01:03:56,303 --> 01:03:59,181
You saw one of those things.

747
01:04:00,307 --> 01:04:03,852
Reeled Molly in
like a fish on a hook.

748
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:06,689
Wanted to do the same thing to you.

749
01:04:08,357 --> 01:04:10,567
Matt wouldn't have done that.

750
01:04:19,118 --> 01:04:21,995
I never got a chance to tell him.

751
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:24,873
Tell him what?

752
01:04:27,835 --> 01:04:31,505
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

753
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,966
So what do we do now?

754
01:04:35,884 --> 01:04:38,262
Make it to morning.

755
01:05:36,612 --> 01:05:40,282
Oh, God.
What are they doing to us?

756
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:34,837
Oh, God!

757
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:37,639
Yeah. Come on.

758
01:11:52,946 --> 01:11:54,615
Please, no, no, no!

759
01:11:54,656 --> 01:11:56,700
No!

760
01:14:46,453 --> 01:14:48,997
What have they done to me?

761
01:14:55,295 --> 01:14:58,132
They took my baby.

762
01:15:13,772 --> 01:15:16,567
Please do it.

763
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:27,299
Kyle to base. Checkin' on that
possible dead body at South Fork.

764
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:30,511
<i>Roger that. Report is unconfirmed</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

765
01:18:32,012 --> 01:18:33,847
Shit.

766
01:18:34,348 --> 01:18:37,393
Kyle to base.
Looks like I spotted something.

767
01:18:40,562 --> 01:18:42,815
Requesting 1052.

768
01:18:42,856 --> 01:18:45,776
<i>Roger, Kyle.</i>
<i>1052 is alerted.</i>

769
01:19:00,124 --> 01:19:03,961
Kyle to base.
Positive on that D.B.

770
01:19:04,378 --> 01:19:06,964
Send that 1052 ASAP.

771
01:19:07,297 --> 01:19:08,340
<i>Roger that.</i>

772
01:19:08,382 --> 01:19:12,219
<i>1052 is on their way</i>
<i>with an ETA of 20 minutes.</i>
