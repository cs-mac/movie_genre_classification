00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:00,915
There's a place I know, come along with me

3
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:03,157
Just break some laws and you get in free

4
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:05,602
- Three hots and a cot
- An orange jumpsuit

5
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:07,803
- Your name's a number
- Now, ain't that a hoot?

6
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:11,562
- Throw out that list of things to do
- The State's got plans for you

00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:13,683

9
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:19,358

Now, it's corrections officer,
not called a guard

11
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,442
Now, won't you kids go play in the yard?

12
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:27,802
Yeah, walk an earth circle
or lift some weights

13
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,639
Might get lucky, might get some date

14

- Let's go to prison
- Yeah

21

22
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,604
Bought yourself some time in the hole

23

They'll throw you a Bible to save your soul

24

Oh, ho-ho, Lord

25
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:56,125
- Doing a nickel
- Doing a dime

26
00:01:56,207 --> 00:01:58,437
- You know you're innocent
- You didn't do the crime

27
00:01:58,527 --> 00:02:00,722
- This place takes patience
- You will find

28
00:02:00,807 --> 00:02:03,116
- But as long as you're here
- Just have a good time

29
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,802

31
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:13,076
- San Quentin, Tehachapi
- It's called prison

32
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,203
- Prison, Alcatraz
- Come on, let's go!

JOHN: Our justice system sucks.

34
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:20,202
Over
2 Million Americans

35
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:22,676
You know, there are over
two million Americans behind bars.

36
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,679
That's a little larger
than the population of Houston.

(ALL CHEERING)

38
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,799
Every year, there are enough children
born in prison to fill 250 Little League teams

39
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:35,762
and enough people are raped in prison
to fill a stadium more than three times.

40
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:36,836
Can you picture that?

41
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:39,122
Three stadiums full of people
raping each other?

42
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,326
I know I can.

43
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:45,237
My name's John Lyshitski.
I just got out of prison.

44
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,876
(MUSIC PLAYING)

45
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:53,559
I don't know. Do you have anything bigger?

46
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:00,766
Yeah. That's more like it.

47
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:05,082
If I had a nickel for every time
I've been incarcerated, I'd have 15 cents.

48
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,444
It all started when I was eight years old.

49
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:10,200
I stole the Publishers Clearing House
prize patrol van.

50
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:11,925
Thought there'd be a million bucks inside.

51
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:13,599
Where's the cheque? Where's the cheque?

52
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:14,676
Wait!

53
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,684
They caught me
when I tried to cash the giant cheque.

54
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:22,846
That was the first time
I met Judge Nelson Biederman,

55
00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:24,599
who changed my life with the magic word.

56
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:25,676
Guilty.

57
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:26,756
Johnny Lyshitski, 8 years old.

58
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:28,041
You see, Johnny,

59
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:31,165
the reason we have
all these laws and rules to live by

60
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:34,683
is so that we can help guide
all the little boys with big dreams

61
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:36,485
and a chance for a bright future,

62
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:41,038
and so that we could help protect them
from worthless scum like you.

63
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:44,762
Seven years, juvenile detention.

64
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:49,002
JOHN: And with that, Judge Biederman
began my trip through the justice machine.

65
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:50,406
The machine works.

66
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:54,685
It took me, a confused child,
and turned me into a for-real, no-shit felon.

67
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,200
John Lyshitski, 18 years old

68
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:58,198
Hey! Hit the ground, motherfuckers

69
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:01,836
or I'll fill you full of more holes
than the Asshole Day parade.

70
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:05,960
There's an Asshole Day parade?

71
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:13,876
Motherfucker.

72
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,116
Guilty.

73
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:18,962
Four years, and if being a moron
were a crime, Mr Lyshitski,

74
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:21,159
you would never see the light of day again.

75
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:23,158
JOHN: I got out again when I was 24.

76
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:27,320
Then that same ass-wipe, Judge Biederman,
sent me back when I was 24 and a half.

77
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,636
Four to seven years.

78
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,276
The next time you steal a car, Mr Lyshitski,
check to see if there are lights on the roof.

JOHN: I'm out again,
and I intend to spread the pain around.

82
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:41,238
Starting with His Honour himself.

83
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:45,045
Take him down piece by piece.

84
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:49,962
Kick off his dog, strangle his cat,
shit in his pillowcase, burn down his garage.

85
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,038
Then I'll get really creative.

86
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:53,242
Hello?

87
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,438

00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:59,803
Great. My name is Ken Kennedy.

89
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,680
I'm calling from the Chicago Tribune.

90
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,439
Yes, we're doing a story down here

91
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:07,758
on some of the city's
longest-serving public figures

92
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:12,125
and we would love to see
Judge Nelson Biederman III at work.

93
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:16,806
So could you tell us which times this week
that he will be on the bench?

94
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:26,076
Uh-huh.

95
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:33,560
And how long ago did you say that he died?

96
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:44,644

do I have to be here if you don't?

00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:18,446
Yeah, I know he was my father.

whose generosity has made this all possible,

Nelson Biederman IV.

122
00:07:42,607 --> 00:07:44,484
I want to thank you all
for attending this honorarium

123
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,922
for my dear, departed Daddy.

are you ready to have your minds blown?

Well, what you got, Nelson?

126
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:19,918
A lot of people didn't think
that this neighbourhood needed

127
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:24,364
a $7-million, original Yoko Ono.

128
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:28,563
Well, those people didn't
grow up on these streets.

129
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:30,281
And maybe I didn't either,

130
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,927
but I am forced to drive through here
on my way to the airport

131
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:35,441
and I believe that anything that I can do

132
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:39,725
to make your lives and my drive
more beautiful is worth doing.

That's why I, Nelson Biederman IV,

134

in honour of my late father, officially declare

00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:44,565
Old Nelson IV's got his pinky caught in
the same machine his daddy threw me into.

177
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:46,644
The boys in the legal department think

178
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:48,797
the best course of action
would be for you to plead guilty,

179
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:51,807
plea bargain to keep this
as quiet as possible,

180

and step down as chairman
of the Foundation.

181

Well, then, you tell the boys
in the legal department

182
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:59,437
that they are a bunch of dipshits,

183
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:02,884
because I am innocent.

184
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:06,926
Well, apparently, the police have
a videotape of you committing the crime.

You got it, Duane?

He owes us one.

Look, I'm gonna be frank.

Off the record, you knew my father.

I am going to hurry this along,

"Trial by jury."

Juries are made up
of 12 people who are so dumb

225
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:07,684
they couldn't even think up
an excuse to get out of jury duty.

226
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:10,600
I'm just proud to be a part
of the American judicimal system.

227
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:12,918
I mean, uh, judaical.

never actually been attacked by dinosaurs.

Yes, we have, Your Honour.

psychologically abused
and raped some more

So why am I not happy?

I feels like it's prom night
and everyone else is porking my date.

I'm gonna have a heart attack
if you don't give me my medication...

269

You see this all the time. Ma'am, please,
we need to talk to Derek right now.

Can we talk to him?

272
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:31,964
You pissed me off because...
I mean I went to my own...

- Do you own this house?
- I mean...

Don't you ever wonder
if there's more to life than smoking grass

can smell undercover cops from 20 paces,

something crazy like sell pot to them.

Unless he actually wanted to go to jail.

I just sold grass to are cops.

or we're coming in.

300
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,481
JOHN: I guess sometimes when
fate knocks on your door,

301
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,000
it has a search warrant.

302
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,202
I'll go to jail.

303
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:22,644
I'll get bunked up with Nelson Biederman IV
and I'll make sure he gets the full treatment.

304
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,241
Yup. My whole life's been leading up to this.

305
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,479
- Guilty as hell.
- Guilty?

306
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:28,841
Now if we could discuss sentencing?

307
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:30,997
Save it, Lyshitski.
How does seven-to-ten work for you?

308
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:33,237
- Not as good as one-to-three.
- Five-to-seven?

309
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:34,840
I'll settle for three-to-five, but wait.
There's more.

- What's that?
- I want to do my time in Rossmore.

You actually want to go to
Rossmore Penitentiary? Why?

00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:10,236
(SCOFFS)

319
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:11,562
Me, too.

320
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:16,998
Tell you what, we should be cellmates.

321
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:21,963
I don't snore
and I'm a pretty quiet masturbator.

322
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,521
Hell, I'll even give you the top bunk.

323
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:31,596
Thanks.

324
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:36,043
Thanks for talking to me.

325
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:41,922
Last couple days in the holding cell,
some of these gang members

326
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:44,962
were really giving me the cold shoulder.

327
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,997
- It's inexcusable.
- That's what I thought.

328
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,918
I mean, why be that way?

329
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,244
WARDEN: Welcome to your new home.

330
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:20,196
Let me start off by saying
that if any one of you is innocent,

331
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,605
just raise your hand.

332
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:24,435
You'll be free to go.

333
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:27,041
MAN 1: Come on, baby! You gonna be mine!

334
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,116
Yeah, we're tossing salad!
That's what I'm talking about!

335
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:34,203
Put your little finger up, baby! Yeah!

336
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:39,998
You gonna be my bitch up in here!

337
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:42,476
(GRUNTS)

338
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:47,156
That was my little joke.

339
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:52,996
I have a notoriously dry sense of humour.

340
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:57,767
All right. Here's how it's gonna work.

341
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,483
If you make my life difficult,

342
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:06,205
I will make your life
exponentially more painful.

343
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:07,322
MAN 2: Yeah!

344
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,878
If you have a complaint,

345
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:14,956
all you have to do,
write it down on a piece of paper,

346
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:17,279
put it in an envelope

347
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:19,119
and stick it up your asshole.

348
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:21,926
MAN 3: Give me some brown sugar!
Tell them how we do it, boy!

349
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:23,281
(CHUCKLING)

350
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:28,526
If you feel that you've been treated unfairly,

351
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:33,760
write it neatly on some paper,
fold it up real good,

352
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:37,477
pull your cheeks apart
and stick it up your asshole.

353
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:47,679
If you have comments
or suggestions about how I run my prison

354
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:52,477
or, let's say,
maybe the cuisine is not to your liking,

355
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:55,847
please write a letter to my office.

356
00:21:56,007 --> 00:22:02,162
Just make sure that under "return address,"
you write the word "asshole,"

357
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:05,958
so that my head guard,
Mr Shanahan, can assist you

358
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:09,198
in pulling your cheeks apart
and sticking it up your asshole.

359
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,960
MAN 4: He's got some
pretty eyes. Pretty lips.

360
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:16,797
WARDEN: Come on, that was funny.

361
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:21,398
GUARD: All right! Move it out!

362
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:24,479
Cell 433. I want you to sign right there.

363
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,565
Move off, Biederman.

364
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:32,045
Lyshitski, John Q.

365
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:33,560
Hello, Johnny. How you doing?

366
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:35,046
(CHUCKLING)

367
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:36,566
Rooney. No glasses. You got the surgery.

368
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:38,446
Yes, I did.

369
00:22:38,527 --> 00:22:41,758
One Metallica t-shirt, Master of Puppets.

370
00:22:42,887 --> 00:22:44,320
One money clip.

371
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:47,604
I'd like to room with Biederman.

372
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:53,003
Empty. Cell number 433.

373
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:54,996
Sign right there.

374
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:56,406
Can I get my old shit?

375
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:57,636
Give it to him.

376
00:22:57,727 --> 00:23:01,561
JOHN: So fate, with a little help
from every last nickel I had,

377
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:06,084
threw me into a cell
with the esteemed Nelson Biederman IV.

378
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:09,603
Today is the first day
of the rest of my beautiful life.

379
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:14,645
People think they can't imagine
what it feels like to be in prison.

380
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,796
It's easy.

381
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:17,320
You know that bolt of fear you get

382
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:20,205
when you see a cop's
flashing red lights in your rear view?

383
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:22,596
It makes you dizzy
and kind of sick to your stomach.

384
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:24,917
Now imagine feeling that 24 hours a day

385
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:28,397
while you're surrounded by convicted killers
who feel the exact same way.

386
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:30,523
It'd kind of put you on edge, huh?

387
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:32,802
Well, that's life in the machine.

388
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:35,196
Nobody's here to relax, and once you're in,

389
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:37,323
there's only one quick way out.

390
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:38,726
In a body bag.

391
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:41,446
MAN 1: Dead man rolling!
MAN 2: Dead man rolling!

392
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:46,961
Wait...

393
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,678
Well, be it ever so humble.

394
00:23:58,127 --> 00:24:00,004
I'll just take the top.

395
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:08,236
It doesn't seem like
they cleaned this toilet up.

396
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:09,760
It's disgusting.

397
00:24:10,687 --> 00:24:12,917
MAN 1: Hey, bro, hold it.
You got two minutes.

398
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:14,235
(CRYING)

399
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:19,446
MAN 2: You want in on it?
Come on. What we got here?

400
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:25,440
Look, amigo, if you're gonna make it in here,
you better smarten up.

401
00:24:27,527 --> 00:24:30,200
Those pricks out there see you like this,
you won't make it a week.

402
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:32,357
You don't wanna die
in your first week, do you?

403
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:33,482
(SOBBING) No.

404
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:36,316
Right.

405
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,361
So you got to trust me. Do what I do.

406
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:43,120
Just keep your mouth shut and try not to cry.

407
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:45,718
It's all right to cry.

408
00:24:46,647 --> 00:24:48,842
Crying takes the sad out of you.

409
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,837
"Crying takes the sad out of you"?

410
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:54,722
Hey, that shit may have flown back
when you were a human being,

411
00:24:54,807 --> 00:24:57,685
but you're not now. You're a piece of meat
and you're in the grinder.

412
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,325
The softer you are,
the more it's gonna grind you up,

413
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:02,080
and the more them animals
are gonna wanna eat you.

414
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,476
All right, you gotta toughen up.

415
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:07,038
Show me your tough face.

416
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:10,357
Show me Nelson's tough face.

417
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:18,844
Jesus, you look like you're
going to take a shit, or something.

418
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:20,838
Hey, John. How you doing?

419
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:23,202
Same Lyshitski, different day.

420
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:25,118
Got some mail for you.

421
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:27,677
Bit backed up. Couple weeks.

422
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:29,086
Who's the new guy?

423
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:32,519
That is Nelson Biederman IV.

424
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:41,927
He got to take a shit or something?

425
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:45,315
- JOHN: No, he's trying to look like bad meat.
- Yeah.

426
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:50,236
Okay.

427
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,683
MAN 3: Now keep it quiet down there.

428
00:25:57,247 --> 00:25:59,442
Look at this, we can order out.

429
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:02,004
MAN 4: I need some
toilet paper, what's up?

430
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,156
MAN 5: Well, we got to you.

431
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:06,203
So now what do we do?

432
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:07,482
Hmm?

433
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,639
What do you mean?

434
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:12,560
What do I mean?

435
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:15,920
I mean, what are we...
What are we supposed to do?

436
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:18,562
We're doing it, man. This is it.

437
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:22,401
We're right in the thick of the action.

438
00:26:22,487 --> 00:26:24,796
We hang out here, go to lunch,

439
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:27,082
come back, hang out some more,
go to dinner.

440
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:31,361
You know how someone
might describe a situation

441
00:26:31,447 --> 00:26:35,326
that's unpleasant or confining
as being "like a prison"?

442
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:40,365
- Yeah.
- This is what they were referring to.

443
00:26:40,727 --> 00:26:43,082
MAN 6: CáIlate la boca!

444
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:47,484
JOHN: It costs $54 a day
to keep a person in prison,

445
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:50,445
which comes out to
$75 million a day nationally.

446
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,597
That's $28 billion a year.

447
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:54,006
When you think about it,

448
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:56,920
wouldn't it be cheaper just to let us
keep your goddamn car stereos?

449
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:01,837
What's on the menu today, good sir?

450
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:07,563
That's meat. That ain't meat.

451
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,680
Ain't meat.

452
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:16,560
Hit me with some meat.

453
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:17,762
MAN: Hey, come on, hurry up.

454
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:24,122
Great American melting pot.

455
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:27,995
You know,
20º% of all prisoners aren't even US citizens?

456
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:31,159
About 10º% are Mexican, 2º% Colombian.

457
00:27:31,247 --> 00:27:33,238
I can't tell the difference.

458
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:35,797
How do you know all this stuff, John?

459
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,276
I'm on a lot of weird mailing lists.

460
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,403
See those bad asses over there?

461
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:43,320
They're the White Kingdom.
They pretty much run the roost.

462
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:48,278
He who controls the smack,
controls the joint, and by "he," I mean him.

463
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,517
Lynard. Don't be fooled, though.

464
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:53,599
Underneath all those swastikas
he's a real prick.

465
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:56,439
MAN 1: Hey, hey.
You ain't gonna eat that, right?

466
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:02,002
At exactly 12:15, stand up.

467
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:04,682
Why?

468
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:07,836
Just do it. It's kind of a prank.

469
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,722
Oh.

470
00:28:10,407 --> 00:28:13,399
We used to do this sort of thing
all the time at prep school.

471
00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:16,923
A couple of the boys wanted to
put one over on old Professor LaRoche.

472
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:18,326
(CHUCKLING)

473
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:20,125
At exactly the appointed minute,

474
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:23,802
all the boys would push
their books down onto the floor.

00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:26,037
- Old LaRoche almost had a heart attack...
- Oh, shit. Not the face.

476
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:27,526
Not the face!

483
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:46,721
All right, Lynard, you're going to the hole.

484

Lunch is over, ladies,
hit the showers! Move it!

485
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:56,799
That's gotta be the stupidest
goddamn thing I've ever seen.

486

Never narc on somebody.

487
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,079
I mean,
haven't you seen any prison movies?

488
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,202
You told me to.

489
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:03,323
Yeah. I didn't mean
for you to tell the truth.

490
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:07,320
You're dead, and I'll probably gonna get
kicked in the teeth just for talking to you.

491
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:08,681
I'm sorry.

492
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:11,806
Okay.

493
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:15,357
Listen, from now on you do
exactly as I say. Exactly.

- Okay?
- Okay.

495
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:21,005
Just remember, number one rule in prison,

496
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:23,922
always look out for your cellmate.

497
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:27,920
JOHN: Remember,
the number one rule in prison,

498
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:31,166
never trust anybody.

499
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:38,558
Of all the fears men have about prison,

500
00:29:38,647 --> 00:29:42,606
loss of liberty, eating bad food,
claustrophobia, Ioneliness,

501
00:29:42,687 --> 00:29:46,475
none of them compare to the prospect
of being fucked up the ass.

502
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:50,397
So, what's a beautiful white boy like you
doing in a place like this?

503
00:29:51,927 --> 00:29:53,360
Three to five.

504
00:29:54,687 --> 00:29:56,120
Soft time, huh?

505
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:58,116
Yeah.

506
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:00,925
I like soft things.

507
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:03,882
You know, like, soft music,

508
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:07,479
maybe a soft little baby duck
on Easter morning.

509
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:12,279
You like little baby ducks?

510

Hey, back the hell off, Barry.

511
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,846
He's my bitch.

512
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:21,316
Hey, Lyshitski, how's it hanging?

513
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,918
Little to the right, I see.

514
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:26,966
Hey, he's my property, dickmonster.

515
00:30:27,207 --> 00:30:30,597
You guys got that? This little filly's all mine.

516
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:32,518
You can look, but don't touch.

517
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:35,758
Juliet's asshole's got
one name stenciled on it. Mine.

518
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:39,442
Romeo. Romeo Lyshitski. Capisce, amigos?

519
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:41,245
No rear entry.

520
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:44,085
That goes for you.

That big bastard's
the head of the Black G-Lords.

522
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:56,685
I don't mean to sound ungrateful, John,

523
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:59,759
but did you have to stick
your finger up my ass?

524
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:02,242
No. Probably not.

525
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:05,885
But it happened.

526
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:09,558
You've gotta get me out of here. Now!

527
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:11,842
Before I become
bitch du jour for one of the G-Lords.

528
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:13,997
I don't care how much it costs. I want out.

529
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:18,642
Well, that's just it, Mr Biederman,
you don't have any money.

530
00:31:18,727 --> 00:31:20,763
What're you talking about? I have millions.

531
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:22,803
Well, the Foundation does, yes,

532
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:26,482
but legally, you have no access
to the Foundation's funds

533
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:29,525
unless you are chairman,
which you are no longer.

534
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:32,440
My father started
the Biederman Foundation.

535
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:36,122
My name is Nelson Biederman!
You can't fire me!

536
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:40,606
Actually, according to the Foundation's
charter, we were required to.

537
00:31:40,687 --> 00:31:43,804
So, without Foundation funds,
you don't have a dime.

538
00:31:43,887 --> 00:31:47,118
Unless you've been working
a paper route on the side.

Well, he's a really good friend of mine.

556
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:41,480
I couldn't possibly let you have him
for anything less than, say,

557
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:44,919
half ounce of grass,
four cartons of smokes?

No, no.

635
00:40:38,047 --> 00:40:41,119

00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,366

my name is Nelson Biederman IV.

and I've been in prison for three months.

I've had my ass kicked so many times

it can't possibly get any worse.

647
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:32,479
That's a message from Lynard.
He gets out of the hole today.

648
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:35,078
He can't wait to see you.

649

- I'm dead.
- Not necessarily.

651
00:41:44,887 --> 00:41:46,957
He might just kick your ass.

652

- Really?
- Yeah.

653
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:50,755
I mean, every day.

654

He's not gonna kill me here, is he?

Oh, no. All the smart money's
bet on the rec yard.

Wait, people are betting
on when I'm gonna be killed?

661

Of course. Prison's a boring place.
They'll bet on anything.

662

664

Look, this is ridiculous.
I'm gonna go talk to Lynard,

665

Mr Lynard,

673
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:58,839
I know that we did not start
under the best of circumstances,

674
00:42:58,927 --> 00:43:02,715
so I just want to say how sorry
I am for the misunderstanding...

(GRUNTS)

676
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:07,002
Okay.

00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:09,722
Okay.

678
00:43:11,247 --> 00:43:12,805
I deserved that.

679
00:43:13,527 --> 00:43:15,279
I deserved that. I...

680
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:23,925
Well, we're even.

681
00:43:25,327 --> 00:43:27,124
I have done you wrong,

682
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:31,886
and twice, you have stabbed me with forks.

683
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:37,078
So let's just try to put
this whole thing behind us

684
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,400
and carry on about this business of living.

685
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:43,522
Sit.

686
00:43:44,687 --> 00:43:45,722
Sit.

687
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:49,406
Well, I should really get back to my friends.

Sit.

689
00:43:58,127 --> 00:44:00,960
It took a lot of guts to do what you did.

690
00:44:01,487 --> 00:44:04,001
Nobody's ever stood up to me before,

691
00:44:04,527 --> 00:44:06,119
except my old man.

692
00:44:08,487 --> 00:44:09,920
I'm sure he's a great man.

693
00:44:10,007 --> 00:44:11,156
I killed him.

694
00:44:12,847 --> 00:44:15,156
I'm gonna kill you the same way.

695
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:21,243
You didn't kill him with kindness? Did you?

696
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:25,400
With a hammer.

697
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:28,325

- Super.

703
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:57,482
All right. So he's not going to kill you?

704
00:44:58,127 --> 00:45:00,482
No, he is, just not right now.

705
00:45:06,607 --> 00:45:08,199
Not here, fellas.

Hey, don't sweat it, compadre.

709
00:45:31,207 --> 00:45:34,199
The way I see it is you still got three options.

710
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:37,798
You could kill yourself, you could fight him,

711
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:42,720
or you could just let him kill you,
which honestly might be your best solution.

712
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:51,163
Or you could always
move out to the boondocks.

713
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:54,246
Get a little place of your own, private cell.

714
00:45:55,527 --> 00:45:58,405
Private cell? How do I do that?

715
00:46:00,687 --> 00:46:03,042
Well, just stand right here. Okay?

716
00:46:05,887 --> 00:46:06,956
JOHN: Hey!

717
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:09,402

and you break the rules you think,

"What the hell are they gonna do,
throw me in jail?"

721
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:28,398
The answer's yes.
It's called isolation. The hole.

722
00:46:28,927 --> 00:46:31,043
In the hole, it's impossible
to tell the difference

723
00:46:31,127 --> 00:46:32,799
between five minutes and forever.

724

Your mind plays tricks on you,
you get depressed, you get disoriented,

725

but most folks
just suffer from extreme panic

726

- It's me, Nelson, Sergeant Barker.

730

I don't blame you. Let's go.

00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:24,155
I'm not going to make it.

743
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:27,997
You're not thinking about
doing yourself in, are you?

744
00:47:37,447 --> 00:47:40,007
My friend, I'm all out of smack today,

but you may be in luck.

746
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:44,802
Because I've got some very nice alternatives.

747
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:46,356
Paprika.

748

That's right. Paprika.

some mild-to-uncontrollable shitting.

Oh, it's like that.

753
00:47:58,047 --> 00:48:03,997
I don't condone that, my friend,
but pretty much any of this shit'll kill you.

This is something called boat cleaner.

00:50:38,047 --> 00:50:39,366
Ring around the rosy.

792
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:55,526
LYNARD: Well, hee-haw. What have we here?

793
00:50:55,607 --> 00:50:56,960
That's mine.

794
00:50:57,287 --> 00:51:00,040
You're holding out on your old pal Lynard.

795
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:04,723
No, Lynard, it's not that,
it's... It's my last fix.

796
00:51:06,727 --> 00:51:07,921
Oh, yeah.

797
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:11,841
Please. Kill me if you want, Lynard,
but please don't make me face it sober.

798
00:51:11,927 --> 00:51:13,599
Screw yourself, dickhead.

799
00:51:14,087 --> 00:51:15,520
You don't need this where you're going.

800
00:51:15,607 --> 00:51:16,801
I'm begging you.

801
00:51:21,447 --> 00:51:22,721
Don't do it.

802
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,683
Don't throw me into the briar patch.

803
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:30,716
Do what?

804
00:51:38,247 --> 00:51:40,636
If you weren't such
a white-supremacist asshole,

805
00:51:40,727 --> 00:51:42,957
you would have read up
on your Uncle Remus.

806
00:51:57,767 --> 00:51:59,598
I did what I had to do.

807
00:52:05,727 --> 00:52:09,003
You heard the man. Back up, boys.

808
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:17,801
Well, that was pretty goddamn weird.

809
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:21,598
You know, you're gonna get
another 20 years for that.

810
00:52:21,807 --> 00:52:23,718
For what? I didn't do anything.

811
00:52:23,967 --> 00:52:25,195
He shot himself up.

812
00:52:26,407 --> 00:52:28,443
I got the needle right here.

813
00:52:33,607 --> 00:52:34,596
Fuck.

814
00:52:38,127 --> 00:52:40,243
So the plot fucking thickens.

815
00:52:43,687 --> 00:52:45,279
- What did you say?
- Hmm?

816
00:52:47,687 --> 00:52:50,042
Nothing. Did I say that out loud?

817
00:53:07,807 --> 00:53:09,035
Oh shit, John.

818
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,039
They're all staring at me. What do I do?

819
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,319
Just play it cool, amigo.

820
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:17,800
Hey, I got something for you.

821
00:53:17,887 --> 00:53:20,082
No, man, I don't want any Biederman action.

822
00:53:22,007 --> 00:53:23,156
What do you want?

823
00:53:23,247 --> 00:53:25,124
I just wanted to say I owe you one.

824
00:53:25,207 --> 00:53:28,756
Lynard was the kind of dickhead
who gives Nazis a bad name.

825
00:53:28,967 --> 00:53:33,404
So anyway, from now on,
White Kingdom's got your back.

826
00:53:33,607 --> 00:53:35,086
- Yeah. Brother.
- White Kingdom.

827
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:44,835
- White Kingdom.
- MAN: White Kingdom. Yeah.

828
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:51,478
What the hell is going on?

829
00:53:53,087 --> 00:53:55,396
I think you're tippy-top dog now.

830
00:53:58,087 --> 00:54:00,442
That's ridiculous. No one's scared of me.

831
00:54:01,207 --> 00:54:02,765
Well, let's see.

832
00:54:03,527 --> 00:54:05,324
Yo, cueball.

833
00:54:06,807 --> 00:54:09,719
Your fat ass is stinking up Biederman's seat.

834
00:54:09,807 --> 00:54:11,001
Pop up.

835
00:54:16,007 --> 00:54:18,123
Look, I don't want no trouble.

836
00:54:20,047 --> 00:54:22,561
Well, that's good to hear, you...

837
00:54:23,047 --> 00:54:24,526
- Pussy.
- Pussy.

838
00:54:25,087 --> 00:54:28,796
So are you gonna move
or do my friends have to move you for me?

839
00:54:29,127 --> 00:54:32,085
Good, because I don't take no crap from no

840
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:36,640
Lucian Freud-looking pussies like you.

841
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:41,362
MAN: Hey. Get your fingers
out of my plate! You crazy?

842
00:54:43,407 --> 00:54:47,764
Wow. I really, really
can't believe that worked.

843
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,440
(CELL DOOR OPENING)

844
00:54:53,927 --> 00:54:55,360
(DOOR BANGING SHUT)

845
00:55:01,327 --> 00:55:05,639
Of all the bathroom stalls in all
the correctional facilities in all the world,

846
00:55:09,687 --> 00:55:11,405
he walks into mine.

847
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,277
Haven't you heard the news, Barry?

848
00:55:19,367 --> 00:55:21,039
The news? Oh, yeah.

849
00:55:22,647 --> 00:55:25,878
Barry finally pitches, Pisces catches,

850
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:28,840
home team wins.

851
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:30,724
(SNICKERING)

852
00:55:32,007 --> 00:55:33,963
Don't even think about it, Barry.

853
00:55:43,487 --> 00:55:45,079
That hurt, Nelson.

854
00:55:46,127 --> 00:55:47,606
Not physically,

855
00:55:48,247 --> 00:55:51,239
but I thought we'd gotten past
this point in our relationship.

856
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:53,797
What are you talking about?

857
00:55:54,447 --> 00:55:58,406
Well, over the last few months
I've started to like you a lot.

858
00:55:58,927 --> 00:56:01,441
Grown accustomed to your face, if you will.

859
00:56:01,527 --> 00:56:04,644
Thought you felt the same way,
but I see now.

860
00:56:07,087 --> 00:56:09,317
I've been living in a fool's paradise.

861
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,760
Look, I should really get back to...

862
00:56:12,207 --> 00:56:14,038
Uh-huh? Uh-huh?

863
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,846
Is this how you treat someone you love?

864
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:21,883
Choking them in a men's room?

865
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:25,442
No.

866
00:56:26,607 --> 00:56:28,040
I don't know.

867
00:56:29,007 --> 00:56:30,235
Maybe.

868
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:33,401
Oh, shit!

869
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:44,078
Maybe I was thinking
you'd forget all about me

870
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:47,724
if you wasn't scared
I was gonna cut your nuts off.

871
00:56:49,007 --> 00:56:50,838
Maybe behind the facade,

872
00:56:51,607 --> 00:56:55,600
there's just a scared little boy
who didn't never get enough love.

873
00:57:03,327 --> 00:57:04,726
Look, Barry...

874
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:06,402
I never thought...

875
00:57:06,487 --> 00:57:07,886
Oh, just leave me alone.

876
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:12,842
Go to him.

877
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:15,561
Go to him.

878
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:19,036
Barry.

879
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:27,882
Barry.

880
00:57:28,327 --> 00:57:29,476
Pisces.

881
00:57:31,007 --> 00:57:32,360
Get him!

882
00:57:32,447 --> 00:57:34,324
Kick his ass. Let's go!

883
00:57:36,047 --> 00:57:37,162
Stop!

884
00:57:37,727 --> 00:57:40,764
Did he touch you, boss?
We'll gut him, right here.

885
00:57:40,847 --> 00:57:41,836
Yes, he touched me.

886
00:57:41,927 --> 00:57:42,962
(FARTS)

887
00:57:43,047 --> 00:57:45,607
Sorry. That was me. Keep going.

888
00:57:46,927 --> 00:57:48,519
But not like that.

889
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,803
I'm giving him a pass this time.

890
00:57:53,447 --> 00:57:55,836
What are you ladies up to?

891
00:57:57,047 --> 00:57:59,322
You, Lyshitski, in the hole!

892
00:57:59,407 --> 00:58:01,523
Are you kidding me?
I didn't even do anything.

893
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:03,757
They're over there. I'm over here.

894
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,156
- Don't you have eyes?
- In the hole!

895
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:09,003
JOHN: The system is one shifty prick.

896
00:58:09,087 --> 00:58:10,440
You dodge right, it shifts left.

897
00:58:10,527 --> 00:58:11,562
Three Weeks Later

898
00:58:11,647 --> 00:58:14,366
You think you're on top of it,
suddenly you're underneath it.

899
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:16,563
The ass end of the punch-line.

900
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:24,837
During my retreat,
Nelson had become king of the crapper,

901
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:26,799
and nobody seemed to flinch.

902
00:58:31,367 --> 00:58:32,402
Just the opposite.

903
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:36,605
They're eating up his fancy-ass rich-boy act
like he was Ben & Jerry's Heroin Chunk.

904
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:39,565
So at exactly the appointed minute

905
00:58:39,647 --> 00:58:42,605
when old LaRoche's back is turned,

906
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:46,324
all the boys shoved
their books onto the floor.

907
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:47,920
(ALL LAUGHING)

908
00:58:48,007 --> 00:58:50,123
Old LaRoche almost had a heart attack.

909
00:58:50,207 --> 00:58:51,560
He didn't know what hit him.

910
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:55,635
Can't wait to see your grand premiere, baby.

911
00:58:55,727 --> 00:58:57,524
From the tippety, cocksuckers!

912
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:59,723
Five, six, seven, eight...

913
00:59:04,647 --> 00:59:05,966
(SINGING)

914
00:59:16,727 --> 00:59:19,400
Go, John. Go, John.

915

(JOHN WHISTLING)

Phillips head.

917
00:59:34,607 --> 00:59:35,881
- Hey, John.
- Hey.

918
00:59:35,967 --> 00:59:37,798
Didn't see you there.

919
00:59:38,527 --> 00:59:40,643
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

920
00:59:41,407 --> 00:59:43,637
You know, I've been meaning
to talk to you about something.

921
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:46,082
- What's that?
- Remember when I first got in here?

922
00:59:46,967 --> 00:59:49,083
I had the balls of a soufflé,
I'll be honest with you.

923
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:52,079
- But you changed that, John, you really did.
- Did I?

924
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:53,202
Yeah.

925
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:55,926
I owe everything that
I am today to you, John. I really do.

926
00:59:56,007 --> 00:59:58,601
I mean, you gave me my self-esteem back.

927
00:59:58,687 --> 01:00:00,518
- I've got the love of a man.
- Wow, good!

928
01:00:00,607 --> 01:00:01,801
All the things that you could want.

929
01:00:01,887 --> 01:00:03,923
I found myself
and I just feel like I really wanna

930
01:00:04,007 --> 01:00:06,123
- give you something, John, I do.
- Perfect! Yeah.

931
01:00:06,207 --> 01:00:08,004
- Can I get you some cigarettes?
- No. I'm good.

932
01:00:08,087 --> 01:00:12,205
- What about porn? Cigarettes and porn?
- No. I'm good.

933
01:00:14,607 --> 01:00:16,563
John, you're the greatest.

934
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:18,956
- I wanna say, from the bottom of my heart...
- Yeah?

935
01:00:19,047 --> 01:00:20,560
- Thank you.
- (CHUCKLES) Okay.

936
01:00:20,727 --> 01:00:22,240
- Hey, have some tea.
- Hey, thanks.

937
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,124
- Made it for you.
- Okay.

938
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:26,559
All right, have fun.

939
01:00:29,847 --> 01:00:31,041
Come on!

940
01:00:33,127 --> 01:00:34,480
JOHN: How did this happen?

941
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:37,161
A few months ago, I had his balls in a vise.

942
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,556
Now with his parole hearing
just around the bend,

943
01:00:39,647 --> 01:00:43,037
it looks like he might be
taking his balls and going home.

944
01:00:50,807 --> 01:00:53,560
Hold still. You got to look good for court.

945
01:00:55,687 --> 01:00:57,120
There you go.

946
01:00:59,287 --> 01:01:00,879
You wanna go out tonight?

947
01:01:00,967 --> 01:01:02,320
Me and some of the guys
were thinking about

948
01:01:02,407 --> 01:01:05,479
going down to the laundry room,
drinking some toilet wine,

949
01:01:05,567 --> 01:01:07,364
and beating up some of the new guys.

950
01:01:08,567 --> 01:01:12,355
Or we could just stay in
and drink toilet wine here.

951
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,964
We never go out any more.

952
01:01:31,847 --> 01:01:34,520
Well, I've got to hand it to you, buddy.

953
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:37,405
You're a bigger man
than I thought you were.

954
01:01:38,207 --> 01:01:39,276
They beat you up,

955
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:42,644
they robbed you of your dignity,
they pissed in your food,

956
01:01:43,127 --> 01:01:44,446
but they didn't break you.

957
01:01:44,527 --> 01:01:47,246
And with the revolving-door policy
of today's prison system,

958
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:49,325
you're probably gonna
get paroled tomorrow.

959
01:01:50,687 --> 01:01:53,645
- They pissed in my food?
- What difference does it make?

960
01:01:54,247 --> 01:01:57,000
You're getting out tomorrow
and I'm proud of you.

961
01:01:57,087 --> 01:01:58,566
- Really?
- Really.

962
01:01:58,647 --> 01:02:01,081
In fact, I snuck you in a going-away present.

963
01:02:02,647 --> 01:02:05,764
Good luck at your hearing.
I'll see you in 1-to-3.

964
01:02:07,527 --> 01:02:08,880
- Thank you, John.
- Okay.

965
01:02:08,967 --> 01:02:11,925
Couldn't have made it
in here without your help.

966
01:02:16,807 --> 01:02:18,684
Why is it already opened?

967
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:20,723
- I opened it for you.
- What for?

968
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:28,082
'Cause I'm a great guy
and I know you had a real tough day.

969
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:37,566
You don't trust me?

970
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:39,920
After all we've been through?

971
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:41,804
One friend can't give another friend a soda

972
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:44,640
without that friend thinking
the second friend put a roofie in it?

973
01:02:45,207 --> 01:02:47,277
Wow. Well, that hurts, pal.

974
01:02:48,167 --> 01:02:49,202
That hurts.

975
01:02:50,607 --> 01:02:52,996
I've been looking out for you
for almost a year now,

976
01:02:53,087 --> 01:02:56,363
and then I bust my nuts
getting you this goddamn fruity soda

977
01:02:56,447 --> 01:02:58,722
and you think I'm up to something?

978
01:02:59,287 --> 01:03:01,039
Well, screw you, pal.

979
01:03:02,087 --> 01:03:03,759
I thought we were friends.

980
01:03:11,727 --> 01:03:13,001
I'm sorry, John.

981
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,796
God, this place has really done
a number on me.

982
01:03:15,887 --> 01:03:17,036
It has.

983
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,406
We are friends.

984
01:03:20,447 --> 01:03:23,200
In fact, you might be
the best friend I've ever had.

985
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:27,359
That's it. Get it all. Go for it.

986
01:03:31,727 --> 01:03:33,524
The taste of freedom.

987
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:37,878
Oh, John, what would
this world be like without...

(RETCHING)

989
01:03:45,847 --> 01:03:49,203
All right, maestro, come on,
let's get him out of here.

990
01:03:50,247 --> 01:03:52,397
We got to put his new face on.

991
01:03:59,687 --> 01:04:02,485
Wake up, Biederman.
Parole board's waiting.

992
01:04:07,287 --> 01:04:08,515
Let's go.

993
01:04:10,207 --> 01:04:14,246
So, Mr Biederman,
do you feel you're ready to re-enter society?

994
01:04:15,207 --> 01:04:16,356
Absolutely.

995
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,524
Prison's made me a new man.

996
01:04:19,407 --> 01:04:24,561
When I get out of here, I intend
to stand up for what I know is right.

997
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:28,206
JOHN: When the parole board
gets through with der Führer,

998
01:04:28,287 --> 01:04:30,039
two things are going to happen.

999
01:04:30,127 --> 01:04:32,880
One, they're gonna file
his early release form

1000
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:35,276
right in between
Charles Manson and the Unabomber's.

1001
01:04:37,847 --> 01:04:41,965
And two,
Nelson's going to be pissed as hell at me.

1002
01:04:47,607 --> 01:04:49,040
Why'd you do it, John?

1003
01:04:49,127 --> 01:04:51,163
Amigo, I did it for your own good.

1004
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:54,361
Now hear me out on this one, all right?

1005
01:04:55,647 --> 01:04:58,719
Listen, you got to sandbag
your first parole hearing, because...

1006
01:05:06,927 --> 01:05:10,203
Okay, you want to know why?
I knew your dad.

1007
01:05:10,287 --> 01:05:12,801
- What?
- Yeah. The judge.

1008
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:15,636
The man who made me who I am today.

1009
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,960
The same man who's going
to kill you right now.

1010
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:20,446
What would you call that?

1011
01:05:20,527 --> 01:05:23,200
I'd call that pretty crazy, isn't it?

1012
01:05:23,927 --> 01:05:26,600
No! It's ironic!

1013
01:05:31,447 --> 01:05:33,915
The word you want is "ironic"!

- Get up, you mothers. Get up, get up now!

1016

You two pussies gonna have a cage match
and I don't even get an invitation?

1020
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:51,245

That's selfish.

'Cause goddamn it,
I want a front-row seat to that catfight.

You two want to kill each other?
Great, stupendous.

1024
01:06:04,207 --> 01:06:08,246
Save everybody else around here the hassle.
But this is my prison.

1025
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:12,765
I schedule the extra-curricular activities.

1026
01:06:14,767 --> 01:06:16,917
And if you two are going to fight,

1027
01:06:18,527 --> 01:06:21,041
I need some time to get some action going.

1028
01:06:21,407 --> 01:06:23,523
So, how's...

1029
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:29,081
How's Friday sound, huh?
Friday good? Say, rec yard?

1030
01:06:30,767 --> 01:06:32,598
Fight to the death?

1031
01:06:33,647 --> 01:06:35,683
Does that work for you two dickheads?

(BOTH GRUNTING)

Wait.

What do I win if I win?

1037
01:06:52,367 --> 01:06:55,165
If you lose, you die. If you win, you die.

1038
01:06:55,487 --> 01:06:58,081
The difference is I kill the winner.
It'll be quick.

JOHN: In one year,
I've proven that the machine

1040
01:07:09,247 --> 01:07:12,205
can warp a law-abiding,
spineless sack of shit like Biederman

1041
01:07:12,287 --> 01:07:15,802
into a totally violent,
psychopathic and lethal sack of shit.

The only flaw in my plan was
now I'm locked in a cage with him.

Friday, the yard. John versus Nelson.
Fight to the death.

take place on the cistern.

That's awesome.
Hey, how much does brain damage pay?

GUARD: Brain damage? I don't know.

1048
01:07:33,607 --> 01:07:35,802
You gotta ask Shanahan.
He's taking the bets.

1049
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:41,516
I'll put two cartons
on Richie Rich taking Lyshitski down.

ear cut off, seven to five.

Sure.

back up in here with my sweet little Pisces.

I'm getting out of here is in a body bag.
