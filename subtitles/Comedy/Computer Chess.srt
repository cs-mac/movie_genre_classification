1
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:27,007
Hi, I'm Robert Lawrence with the
Advantage Corporation in San Diego,

2
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:30,077
and we have a Colby 5 here,

3
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:33,444
which is highly optimised
for playing chess.

4
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:37,780
And we have designed it around
a recursive assembler routine

5
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:41,946
that uses a brute strength approach

6
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,857
to finding the optimal route.

7
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:45,759
I don't want to give away exact numbers,

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,096
but we've got the fastest depth-first
search to get the most number...

9
00:00:49,097 --> 00:00:51,565
We can predict more turns in advance
than any other computer,

10
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,000
so we've got a good chance.

11
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:55,231
My field is experimental psychology,

12
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,972
but I've spent the last three years
studying chess skill

13
00:00:57,973 --> 00:01:00,737
in both humans and machines.

14
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,035
And this is TSAR.

15
00:01:02,177 --> 00:01:08,207
This is the latest iteration of Caltech's
computer chess program.

16
00:01:08,316 --> 00:01:12,753
This is 3.0. Last year, 2.0 won
this very same tournament.

17
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:16,123
Computers are getting smaller, they're
getting better, they're getting faster.

18
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:18,892
It's a matter of time before
we beat people with these things.

19
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:22,483
Do you guys have a program
in the competition here today?

20
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:24,331
No. Don't know anything about it.

21
00:01:24,332 --> 00:01:28,359
We're just watching 'em get ready
for the end of the world here.

22
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:32,303
- World War III.
- That's what we're here for.

23
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:34,041
Getting in on the ground floor.

24
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:37,278
Do you think a human being
will ever beat a person at chess?

25
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:39,847
Oh... Between a "human being"
and a "person"?

26
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:42,009
My money's on the computer.

27
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:44,718
Er, I mean a computer...

28
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,921
If you ask Captain Apocalypse there...
Have you talked to this guy?

29
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:53,326
I feel like I'm writing intercontinental
ballistic missile routines here!

30
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:55,258
I just wanna win at chess.

31
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:06,036
"NOTHING BUT CHANGES")

32
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:56,690
Hey! Hey!

33
00:02:56,825 --> 00:03:00,527
Do not ever shoot at the sun,
you're gonna burn out the tube!

34
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:03,964
- I wasn't shooting at the sun, it's fine.
- You're shooting at the sun!

35
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:06,333
You're gonna shoot the rest
of the weekend inside.

36
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:09,269
We want to be only inside. That's it!

37
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:12,772
But computer chess goes back
even further,

38
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:18,311
to the mechanical Turk, 1770,
the original chess-playing machine.

39
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:22,405
It played against and defeated
Benjamin Franklin

40
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,110
and Napoleon Bonaparte.

41
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:27,612
Well, he had a secret.

42
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:30,987
There was a human being
inside the machine.

43
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:33,961
Though the first was a fraud,
we're working to get back

44
00:03:33,962 --> 00:03:38,296
to that level of chess play
when machine beats man.

45
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:42,436
I greet you for our annual North
American Computer Chess Tournament

46
00:03:42,437 --> 00:03:46,703
and present you with a panel
of the best and the brightest.

47
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:50,971
From my left, there is Les Carbray
from Allied Laboratories.

48
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:52,306
Hi there.

49
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:56,009
Martin Beuscher,
sitting in for Tom Schoesser.

50
00:03:56,151 --> 00:04:01,179
And that's last year's winner,
TSAR 2.0 from Caltech.

51
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:05,851
Roland McVey from MIT,
the programrs of STASIA.

52
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:10,396
And finally Mike Papageorge,
who is an independent programr.

53
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:16,067
Is there a computer program
in the house

54
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:19,230
which can stand up
to a human chess master?

55
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:22,639
That's me! When will a machine beat me?

56
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:26,476
Many years ago I made a public wager

57
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:30,675
that no computer would beat me
until the year 1984,

58
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:33,878
and that date is quickly coming up.

59
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:37,788
So what do you think, gentlemen?
Will I win my bet?

60
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:41,384
I... I think you're cutting it close,

61
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:45,455
but I think you will win that bet.

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,469
Erm... If I was in your shoes,
I wouldn't extend it any.

63
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:55,838
I think within two years of that, 1986,

64
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:57,912
you won't stand a chance,

65
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,381
and I think that,
say another ten years after that,

66
00:05:03,518 --> 00:05:07,028
there isn't a man or woman alive
who will stand a chance.

67
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:11,592
Well, there may be some disagreement,

68
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:16,686
but look at the speed with which
the technology, the software,

69
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:20,392
but particularly the hardware,
is progressing right now.

70
00:05:20,502 --> 00:05:24,063
And just based on that speed,

71
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:30,474
barring a calamitous event
like World War III to set us back,

72
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:33,012
I truly believe it to be inevitable.

73
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:37,918
How about any of the other gentlemen,
do you have a thought on this?

74
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,819
Want to chime in?

75
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:42,283
This articulate panel?

76
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,092
We've experimented some
with parallel processing

77
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:47,473
and then we're doing selective search,

78
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:51,959
and all the algorithmic and software things
that we're doing

79
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,868
makes a difference,
it does make an improvement,

80
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:59,829
but it's dwarfed by the improvement
we get just with better hardware.

81
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:04,139
More memory and faster processor.

82
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:08,248
We're blessed at Allied
in that we have the equipment,

83
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:11,069
we have the resources
at our disposal, so...

84
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:16,989
The person I'm really excited to talk to
about real gains in software

85
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,889
is perhaps Tom Schoesser,

86
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:22,796
who I thought was going to be here
on this panel?

87
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:24,765
Yes, Professor Schoesser
will be here shortly,

88
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:26,333
he is delayed, but he will be here.

89
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:29,462
OK, could you perhaps
talk about some of that?

90
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:31,869
Talk about advances? Well, I...

91
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,110
I think it's safe to say that we're operating
in some of the same avenues as Allied,

92
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:41,172
but maybe Professor Schoesser
could speak more to that,

93
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:45,514
but I'm not necessarily certain
he would speak about it.

94
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:48,322
Well, anyway,
whatever you did last year was working

95
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:51,383
because TSAR 2.0 was the winner,

96
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:54,316
and they were especially good
about endgames,

97
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:57,965
and that's a place
where computer programs often falter.

98
00:06:57,966 --> 00:07:02,767
So I think what I'd like to show is an
example of what happened last year.

99
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:09,499
And I'm sorry
to do this to my friend right here, but...

100
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:11,602
So, STASIA versus DAWN.

101
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:14,848
Well, this should have been
an easy win for STASIA.

102
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:20,651
Any human being can see
that there's a forced queen-takes-queen,

103
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:24,121
and it's a very easy victory for White.

104
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:28,592
But instead... Queen checks.

105
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:31,026
Queen checks.

106
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:33,998
Check, check, check, check,
back and forth,

107
00:07:34,102 --> 00:07:37,367
over and over again, lost in a loop.

108
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:40,175
Very, very embarrassing,
wouldn't you say?

109
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,610
Er, yes. It was not our finest moment.

110
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:47,146
But you bring up a good point.

111
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:49,850
I think we've seen a lot of increase
in hardware speed,

112
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:52,479
it's definitely led to stronger game play.

113
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:57,324
In fact I think we're searching the tree
deeply enough now

114
00:07:57,325 --> 00:08:00,975
that we're catching
pretty much all of the tactical issues.

115
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:02,896
But STASIA's greatest weakness,

116
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:06,856
which I think is the same weakness
all our programs share,

117
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:12,268
is that it really has a very poor
understanding of the positional issues.

118
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:16,707
So this year at MIT
we've hired a grandmaster to help us out.

119
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:20,080
He's helped us come up with a couple rules
on the endgame specifically

120
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:24,677
that will hopefully help us
avoid the comedy that we saw last year.

121
00:08:26,754 --> 00:08:29,523
Mr Papageorge,
we haven't heard from you yet.

122
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:32,391
You usually have
a very unique opinion, so...

123
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:35,257
Frankly Pat,

124
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:38,265
I have to tell you I find the programming
of my fellow competitors here

125
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:40,816
to be almost as boring as this discussion.

126
00:08:41,903 --> 00:08:44,905
Why, because the machine can't compete
against the human soul?

127
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:46,016
Very interesting!

128
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:48,508
Sure, sooner or later
somebody's gonna write a program

129
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:51,535
that's gonna beat you in '83, in '85,
who cares?

130
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:54,181
Listen, you guys
are just trying to eke out

131
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:56,483
one little victory
versus each other, you know?

132
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:58,952
You get here this year,
you get here next year.

133
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:01,188
My program is seeking harmonies,
seeking innovations...

134
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:03,690
- I'm not entirely sure...
- That's what I'm doing!

135
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:06,560
...from the perspective of programming
that it actually means anything.

136
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:09,501
Well, we'll see
when we get to the competition.

137
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:13,467
Could you please
spell your name for me, sir?

138
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:18,235
Sure, it's P-A-P-A-G-E-O-R-G-E.

139
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:21,308
I don't see anything here.

140
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:24,574
- I'm sorry.
- P-A-P-A-G-E-O-R-G-E?

141
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:27,078
- No.
- M-l-C-H-A-E-L?

142
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:28,648
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,086
I could call to one of the neighbouring
hotels and see if there's an available room.

144
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:37,247
No, I need to stay at this hotel
where the competition's being held!

145
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:48,560
Um, I am Pat Henderson,
I am very excited.

146
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:52,570
We have players from all over America,
Canada, Quebec...

147
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,375
Just great,
and we have something new this year,

148
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:58,645
we have a lady who is competing,
way in the back corner.

149
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:01,214
I'm happy about that too, she's welcome.

150
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:04,082
So, the way
this tournament works is this,

151
00:10:04,218 --> 00:10:07,585
we play Swiss system -
that's five rounds.

152
00:10:07,722 --> 00:10:11,920
That means everybody keeps playing.
If you lose, you play to the end.

153
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:14,892
However there is one big winner,

154
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:19,090
and that winner gets a $7,500 prize.

155
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,735
And the other thing you get to do,
you get to play me.

156
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:23,336
Stick around for the last day

157
00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:27,296
because I challenge
that winning chess program.

158
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:31,077
This will be a gruelling couple of days,
so let's keep it light,

159
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:34,614
let's keep it collegial, be respectful,
and of course have fun.

160
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:37,106
Let's begin round 1.

161
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:51,254
So, er, Tom Schoesser - is he showing up?

162
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,859
He's a good guy. Way ahead of his time.

163
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:56,341
He's like Tesla, he's so far ahead.

164
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:58,004
I wanna talk to him about
the "Eureka moment".

165
00:10:58,005 --> 00:11:03,875
And frankly, we're on the way to a kind
of timid strategy on the side of White.

166
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:10,609
I think the reason is, they are playing the
very, very strong Caltech TSAR 3.0 team.

167
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:15,548
In this case, maybe the program
is trying for a draw?

168
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,387
In fact I defy anybody
to tell me any theory of Tesla's

169
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:21,791
that's been disproven today.

170
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:25,457
I mean, wireless energy transfer,

171
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,068
radio before Marconi,

172
00:11:28,202 --> 00:11:29,601
the spark plug,

173
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:30,904
alternating current engine...

174
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:32,497
Rook to D8.

175
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:35,873
- Maybe the Industrial Revolution.
- No, it says E8...

176
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:42,677
TSAR takes pawn.

177
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:44,307
Queen takes queen.

178
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:50,285
And rather than capture queen,
the rook just approaches it.

179
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:54,027
Is there any possibility
that this is, er...

180
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:57,464
some kind of, er, very advanced...

181
00:11:57,565 --> 00:11:59,260
I mean, er...

182
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,666
we just gave up a queen to, er...

183
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,739
to get his queen there
and now we're basically just...

184
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,332
Well...

185
00:12:08,142 --> 00:12:09,632
Um...

186
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:12,968
- Don't move that rook.
- All right?

187
00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:15,604
- Be right back.
- Excuse me! Excuse me...

188
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:19,254
There seems to be a little glitch here,

189
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:22,288
maybe we should just
follow with the camera

190
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:25,558
and I'll look over here
at the STASIA SHORTSLEEV game.

191
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,360
We're having serious technical problems,

192
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:30,196
- I need to run a very, very brief diagnostic.
- I'm sorry, once the clock has started...

193
00:12:30,197 --> 00:12:32,933
There's a tiny...
I'm almost certain I know what it is,

194
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:34,734
it's just going to take
a moment of our time.

195
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:35,963
I appreciate that,

196
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:38,772
but unfortunately once the clock has
started we cannot halt the game.

197
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:41,469
OK, er... That's understandable.

198
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:45,045
We can go ahead
and leave the clock running.

199
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:47,113
It's gonna be a very brief diagnostic.

200
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:48,915
I'm almost certain
I know what the issue is.

201
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:54,286
- I'm sorry, there's no adjusting the code.
- We're at a point now... this game is not...

202
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,388
And MIT just won.

203
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,332
Great playing everyone, great round.

204
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,335
I've got your new table assignments
up here on the projector.

205
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:10,066
Eight of you will be moving.

206
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:14,501
Er, let's be careful and,
of course, watch for cables.

207
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:15,905
Good luck.

208
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,079
Oh, God...

209
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:30,148
Peter, can you tell me
what's going on here?

210
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:34,861
I mean, chess is the game where you're
supposed to protect the king, right?

211
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:35,862
Yes.

212
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:38,598
Rather than sending him out to die
at the earliest opportunity.

213
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:39,998
- Is that right?
- Yes.

214
00:13:40,134 --> 00:13:41,624
- Yeah?
- OK.

215
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:47,708
Do you have any idea what game it is
that TSAR is trying to play right now?

216
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:54,309
Can you enter the move?

217
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:20,872
Scotch, man?

218
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:22,868
God, yes.

219
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:26,446
Another of these
for the Rules Committee here?

220
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:28,176
Thank you so much.

221
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:31,845
A lot of late night coding sessions
fuelled by this stuff.

222
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:35,645
You don't find it blurs your judgment?

223
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,934
I've got it down to a science, you see.

224
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:40,885
There's a sweet spot.

225
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:43,496
And the sweet spot is three scotches.

226
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:45,465
Four?

227
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:48,933
You start to get a little bit drunk,
a little bit fuzzy.

228
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:51,638
One or two, it just doesn't work.

229
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,266
But on three scotches?

230
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:59,640
A man on three scotches could program
his way out of any problem in the world.

231
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:11,858
Excuse me, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

232
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,292
OK.

233
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:23,103
Shelly, hi. Mike Papageorge.
I was one of the panellists.

234
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:24,503
- Hi.
- How you doing?

235
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:25,672
Fine.

236
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,308
I see you're with the MIT team.

237
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:31,711
That's wonderful, I think that we need
more women here at this conference.

238
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:33,580
I mean seriously,
you get all these guys together

239
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:36,116
to come up with a solution for this
problem, what do they come up with?

240
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:39,348
"Brute force." Brute force.
It's pathetic, really.

241
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,588
I'd be willing to bet
that you and I are the only ones here

242
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:45,079
who even understand
that programming has a feminine side.

243
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,500
Anyway, I would love to stay in your room
if you have an extra bed.

244
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:55,935
I... I'm so sorry
that you lost your room.

245
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:58,166
I... I don't have an extra bed.

246
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:00,807
Could I just crash on your floor
or something?

247
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:03,309
I just need, you know,
a blanket and a pillow really.

248
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,612
Just somewhere where I can crash
till tomorrow morning.

249
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:09,242
The thing is,
the computer's in my room, so...

250
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,081
I would probably need to check
with the team to make sure...

251
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,882
What, McVey? He's fine, he loves me!

252
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:18,791
Excuse me.
Sorry to eavesdrop, but I don't think...

253
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:20,126
Can I help you guys with something?

254
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:23,029
Yeah, I don't think it's a good idea to...
with the computer equipment in her room.

255
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,998
I... I just don't think
that's a good idea.

256
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:30,301
Sir, sir... we, unlike Shelly,
we have a double, we have plenty of space.

257
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:32,739
We'd be happy to have you stay with us.

258
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,450
- You can stay in our room.
- Yes, no problem.

259
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:27,961
What?

260
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:32,112
So the thing, er...
the thing you got to remember is...

261
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,020
When I'm talking,
I'm not really talking, he's talking.

262
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:40,406
When I'm asking questions,
he's the one who's actually asking them.

263
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,487
He's just asking them through me.

264
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:44,476
You can answer me...

265
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:48,203
- But, but...
- It's all going back to him.

266
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:49,835
He's pulling the strings.

267
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:52,703
- How do you feel about that?
- I... I'm, er...

268
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:55,076
No, no, no! You've got to answer me.

269
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:57,088
So...

270
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,990
explain this to me, because...

271
00:18:00,094 --> 00:18:04,463
guys like you are, like,
from Mars, to me.

272
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,090
How does somebody end up being you?

273
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:11,636
I mean, how do you get to be you?

274
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:14,401
- How do I get to be me?
- Yeah.

275
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:17,443
- How do you have to be you?
- How do I <i>have</i> to be me?

276
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:19,469
Yeah. How do you get to be you?

277
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:22,909
Well, it's hard to sum up.

278
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,943
For the most part
I'm doing what I love to do.

279
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,280
Um... but I've got
the resources that I need.

280
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:34,519
You know, I... if I need...

281
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:39,223
if I need hardware,
if I need computational cycles or whatever,

282
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,453
I mean, I've got that all on my...

283
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:43,469
No, but tell me, like, like, like...

284
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,438
Like, you get up and you... what?

285
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:50,349
You take a shower, you eat breakfast, you
get in your car, you get on the highway?

286
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:54,018
- I'm, er...
- What are you doing with your life?

287
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:59,610
I'm... developing
a computer chess program!

288
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,453
Imagine a world where
children can hone their skills

289
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:06,059
playing against machines,

290
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,328
where you've almost got
an electronic chess coach...

291
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:12,799
But what if it's the computer honing
its skills playing against children?

292
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,970
Well, I think that's part of a...

293
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:17,609
I think that's part of a bigger question.

294
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:19,138
From a technical point of view.

295
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:22,308
Can you look me in the eye
and tell me that you have not...

296
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:26,939
had any interaction
with the Defence Department,

297
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:31,551
the Pentagon, DARPA,
the intelligence community, the entire...

298
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:32,919
- John invited me.
- Fine.

299
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,021
They don't call it the
"military-industrial complex" for nothing.

300
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:36,489
Hey, how's it going?

301
00:19:37,157 --> 00:19:38,157
Hey.

302
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:40,326
Welcome to our little
"after hours" joint here.

303
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:43,129
You want a beer, or you want some weed?
There's pills in the back.

304
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,724
Nah, I usually abstain.

305
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:47,332
Usually?

306
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:49,935
- Have a peanut, at least.
- All right.

307
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:53,339
- Let me... Let me...
- Actually I want one of those too.

308
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,142
...accept some assumptions
that I may not believe.

309
00:19:56,143 --> 00:19:57,542
Let's say that, er...

310
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:59,679
Let's overstate my importance.

311
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:03,271
Let's say that,
yes, this work that I'm doing,

312
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:05,181
they're very interested

313
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:11,087
and they're looking at every theory
that I come up with

314
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:17,391
and applying this to their great
military machine, or intelligence machine.

315
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:19,632
- I mean, let's...
- It's not even a metaphor!

316
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,667
I mean, there are two sides,
different colours,

317
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:24,070
one of 'em's got to win,
one of 'em's got to lose.

318
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:26,172
It's gonna be ugly for the ones that lose.

319
00:20:26,173 --> 00:20:28,841
There are "knights,"
there are "kings," there are "queens."

320
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:33,438
This is obviously a militaristic problem
that you're trying to solve.

321
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:38,151
Are you...
are you trying to recruit me here?

322
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:40,382
Are you from the Pentagon?

323
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:43,923
Is there something you're not telling me?

324
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:46,225
Er, I get around, but that's not...

325
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:48,057
Oh, you get around?

326
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:53,256
If I'm all that you seem to be suggesting
that I am to the Pentagon,

327
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,994
then if I wasn't performing this work

328
00:20:56,103 --> 00:21:00,673
doesn't that mean that the Russians
are getting ahead of us? I don't think...

329
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:04,844
You can use that excuse for any atrocity
that's ever been committed.

330
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:07,574
"If I didn't do it somebody else would."

331
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:10,817
But on the other hand,
you seem to be making the argument

332
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:14,754
that if any form of research
has military potential

333
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:19,291
then it is something which
morally should not be researched.

334
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,261
- I asked if it would bother you...
- I think you halt human progress.

335
00:21:22,262 --> 00:21:24,025
You halt human progress!

336
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:25,792
Chess is black and white.

337
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:28,000
Let's... again, let's take this example,

338
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:29,502
I'm not in the world,
I'm not in the world...

339
00:21:29,503 --> 00:21:31,971
It's not war, chess is not war.

340
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:36,432
It's like my uncle said,

341
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:43,781
"War is death, hell is pain,
chess is victory," and um...

342
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:47,854
I would rather play a game of chess

343
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:53,589
than go fight, get killed,
get a fuckin' bullet in the eye.

344
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:57,252
I enjoy it.

345
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:01,434
- I enjoy playing.
- Here you go. Enjoy that.

346
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:02,435
Thanks.

347
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:11,070
But what about...

348
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:13,408
What about the progress of A.I.?

349
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:16,039
You talk of its applications in war,

350
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:19,277
but how far has A.I. Really come?

351
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:22,788
Things evolve, this is true,
I'm not refuting that at all.

352
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:26,691
But if all computers can do is calculate,

353
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:33,023
then what about our basic
fundamental premise of intelligence?

354
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:35,067
What is artificial intelligence?

355
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:37,318
Let me stop you there for one second.

356
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:40,100
Why are you here?

357
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:43,543
To participate in a tournament,
to do the best you can,

358
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:46,779
in a field that you basically believe
is stagnant and you don't believe in?

359
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,514
I don't believe in the dominant approach.

360
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:51,884
You guys figure this out.
You ever seen the knight's tour?

361
00:22:51,885 --> 00:22:53,886
You've got to look at the real research.

362
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:56,017
- You do the knight's tour?
- Yeah.

363
00:22:56,123 --> 00:22:57,283
You wanna see it?

364
00:22:57,424 --> 00:22:59,756
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but, but...

365
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:03,488
So many of my colleagues, I feel,
have a very narrow view.

366
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:09,502
There's a fundamental assumption that
all knowledge can be formally represented.

367
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:12,405
That all knowledge
can be reduced to numbers.

368
00:23:12,406 --> 00:23:14,738
It needs to be an embodied sense...

369
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:17,143
But for God's sake,
you're in the academic world!

370
00:23:17,144 --> 00:23:19,512
If anybody -
if <i>anybody</i> could get a grant,

371
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:22,277
if <i>anybody</i> could get this signed off

372
00:23:22,382 --> 00:23:24,792
to do this kind of research, it's you.

373
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:27,753
You're in an ideal position for that.
I'm not.

374
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:31,991
My employer probably doesn't see
any money in what you're talking about,

375
00:23:31,992 --> 00:23:36,827
But you? You can go forth,
you can put these theories into practice.

376
00:23:36,964 --> 00:23:38,831
You can write research papers on it.

377
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:42,893
You would think
academia would be more promising,

378
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:45,136
er... but the dominant paradigm...

379
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:46,839
You been recording this whole time?

380
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,008
- ...is very hard to fight against.
- No.

381
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:51,705
- I mean, I...
- Why not?

382
00:23:51,812 --> 00:23:53,946
I've gone to grad school for years,

383
00:23:53,947 --> 00:23:57,781
because I was seeking
real artificial intelligence.

384
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:00,852
And real artificial intelligence, it's...

385
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:02,318
Let me ask you...

386
00:24:02,456 --> 00:24:04,788
Real artificial intelligence?

387
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:07,493
Is that different
than artificial real intelligence?

388
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:09,195
How significant is the research?

389
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:12,832
In the last decade
the research hasn't been that significant,

390
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,200
even in the calculable world.

391
00:24:14,201 --> 00:24:16,791
We're going round in circles, aren't we?

392
00:25:38,118 --> 00:25:39,483
Who are you?

393
00:25:39,586 --> 00:25:42,922
This is Mike Papageorge.
I'm here for the competition.

394
00:25:42,923 --> 00:25:45,483
Could I possibly come in for a minute?

395
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,286
Can you go away, please?

396
00:26:16,523 --> 00:26:18,991
Oh, um, I lost my key.

397
00:26:19,126 --> 00:26:22,128
Can I just come in here
and stay with you guys for a while?

398
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:23,926
- Sure, come on in.
- Thanks.

399
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:27,833
Ha.

400
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:29,196
- Ha.
- Ha.

401
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:30,696
- Ha.
- Hu.

402
00:26:31,037 --> 00:26:32,368
- Hu.
- Ha.

403
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:34,200
- Ha.
- Ha.

404
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,476
One want to be two,

405
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:41,706
two want to be one.

406
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,746
One want to be two,

407
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:47,386
two want to be one!

408
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:48,954
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah.

409
00:26:50,557 --> 00:26:52,124
It's half me and half you.

410
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,423
I didn't get absolute perfection,

411
00:26:54,561 --> 00:26:57,689
but I definitely see the possibilities,

412
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:01,734
and being open to the possibilities.

413
00:27:02,402 --> 00:27:05,701
I never realised
that our eyes are the same colour.

414
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,105
And just...

415
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:10,437
Thank you.

416
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:13,712
- Thanks.
- Thank you for being here.

417
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:33,431
Its warmth.

418
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:36,626
Its moisture.

419
00:27:37,637 --> 00:27:39,195
- Excitement!
- Ooh...

420
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:46,140
The joy it brings.

421
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,004
- Oh.
- It is OK.

422
00:27:48,682 --> 00:27:49,774
You may come in.

423
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,849
And we shall adjourn.

424
00:27:59,993 --> 00:28:01,093
Should we go back to the room?

425
00:28:01,094 --> 00:28:03,295
I will visit with you all individually,

426
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:06,356
and I will see you all together
this evening.

427
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:08,797
I love you. I love you.

428
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:11,268
Do you need help cleaning up?

429
00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:12,894
Yes, yes, thank you...

430
00:28:13,073 --> 00:28:14,607
Hey, what do you got there?

431
00:28:14,608 --> 00:28:16,828
A COMPAQ luggable portable computer.

432
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:25,136
Hey, that's a big one, huh?

433
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:26,643
Yeah.

434
00:28:27,454 --> 00:28:29,081
What's... what's, er...

435
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,887
It's the PDP-11.

436
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:35,088
- A what?
- It's the PDP-11.

437
00:28:35,262 --> 00:28:36,262
OK. Wow!

438
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,988
Yes. It's very good.

439
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:51,977
And how about your name, Luke?

440
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:55,141
- Is that some kind of acronym?
- OK, well...

441
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:58,645
Luke is me, not an acronym.

442
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,083
Luke is my computer.

443
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:03,678
Luke is the software
that I wrote for this contest.

444
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,759
So it's all Luke. Just me, version one.

445
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:09,929
- There'll only be version one...
- Gentlemen. Shelly.

446
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,710
Another round begins,
we can start the games.

447
00:29:20,707 --> 00:29:25,144
Roland, I'm sorry, I'm afraid we're
going to have to offer our resignation.

448
00:29:25,145 --> 00:29:26,510
Is that even legal?

449
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,270
To resign before you've even made a move?

450
00:29:29,382 --> 00:29:30,906
Should we ask Reini?

451
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,888
It's OK with us, we'll take the win.

452
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:37,117
What's wrong?

453
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:39,687
Oh, I wish I knew.

454
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:44,330
You guys need a bathroom break?

455
00:29:44,331 --> 00:29:48,665
This is a very odd, weird,
strange, idiosyncratic game.

456
00:29:48,768 --> 00:29:50,703
I don't know how many ways I can say it.

457
00:29:50,704 --> 00:29:51,804
And it's all on White,

458
00:29:51,805 --> 00:29:53,397
it's all CHECKERS.

459
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:58,204
White has already sacrificed
a queen and a knight.

460
00:29:58,345 --> 00:29:59,735
This is either suicide

461
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:01,914
- or just the most brilliant game...
- What's going on over there?

462
00:30:01,915 --> 00:30:03,048
...of the whole tournament.

463
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:04,416
TSAR hasn't made a single move!

464
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:05,818
Hey, don't talk to him. He's working!

465
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:07,514
Pat, go fuck yourself!

466
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:09,679
Look!

467
00:30:09,823 --> 00:30:14,351
This is a beautiful, beautiful quiet move
which I just missed.

468
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:16,395
- CHECKERS set quite a clever trap here...
- Tom! Hi!

469
00:30:16,396 --> 00:30:18,330
Hi! Les, good to see you.

470
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:20,629
Excuse me.

471
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,534
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine, thank you.

472
00:30:22,535 --> 00:30:24,069
Wow, you're still using the V-20-10...

473
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,604
Excuse me, Les.
Tom, could you follow me, please?

474
00:30:25,605 --> 00:30:27,740
- Nice position you've got there.
- Tom!

475
00:30:27,741 --> 00:30:29,608
Tom Schoesser, the man of the hour!

476
00:30:29,609 --> 00:30:31,702
Hey, what's wrong with you guys?

477
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:33,642
TSAR 3.0 - what's wrong?

478
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,690
Innovation can be a rocky road!

479
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:40,644
We actually just resigned the game.

480
00:30:40,787 --> 00:30:42,755
You resigned? Why?

481
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,917
Peter, you want to update Tom?

482
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,418
It, um...

483
00:30:48,561 --> 00:30:51,096
I was just up all night debugging it
and I haven't come across anything.

484
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:53,190
- You were up all night?
- Yes.

485
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:56,064
OK, um...

486
00:30:56,803 --> 00:31:00,653
How about you get a breath of fresh air
and we'll work on this?

487
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:02,669
Oh. OK.

488
00:31:05,812 --> 00:31:07,913
- Roland, good to see you.
- Hey, Tom.

489
00:31:07,914 --> 00:31:09,142
Good to see you.

490
00:31:09,282 --> 00:31:11,784
So, er, I know
this is a little unorthodox,

491
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:15,152
but between gentlemen,

492
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:16,822
do you mind if we "unresign"?

493
00:31:16,823 --> 00:31:17,823
Sure. Yeah.

494
00:31:17,924 --> 00:31:19,858
- I just want to watch her play.
- It's OK with us.

495
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:20,859
OK.

496
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,070
Hey!

497
00:31:31,704 --> 00:31:35,970
Hey, are you with the computer convention
over there?

498
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:39,478
Yeah, I think we met briefly
in the conference room, I'm Dave.

499
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:40,546
- You're...?
- Peter.

500
00:31:40,547 --> 00:31:42,347
- Peter, nice meeting you. Yeah.
- Yes.

501
00:31:42,348 --> 00:31:44,550
Hey, do you mind if I ask you a question?

502
00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:46,883
What are you guys doing in there?

503
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,910
Are those all the new computer models,
or what?

504
00:31:50,023 --> 00:31:51,820
No, not really.

505
00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:54,860
- They're new chess programs.
- Oh, yeah?

506
00:31:54,961 --> 00:31:59,625
Various... various people have written
their own chess programs this year

507
00:31:59,732 --> 00:32:02,067
- and it's a tournament for that.
- OK.

508
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:07,199
So the computers will face each other off
to see who's written the best program.

509
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:12,677
OK, so... the computers play chess
versus other computers?

510
00:32:13,746 --> 00:32:15,077
Yes.

511
00:32:15,248 --> 00:32:16,476
Wow.

512
00:32:17,383 --> 00:32:19,044
Wow!

513
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:24,089
Well, I've got
a little convention here, too.

514
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,991
I mean, it's a couples group.

515
00:32:25,992 --> 00:32:28,327
I don't know if you've ever done
any encounter stuff or anything like that.

516
00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:29,928
You're probably a little young for that.

517
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:31,055
It's, um...

518
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:34,566
I don't know if you're into
any of the therapy at all...

519
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,091
Anyhow...

520
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:38,737
the guy, I don't know if you've
seen this guy - Keneiloe in there?

521
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:40,706
Big black guy. I mean, he's from Africa!

522
00:32:40,707 --> 00:32:43,742
So his perspective is really...
really heavy, you know?

523
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:44,869
I mean, his...

524
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:49,741
It's not like the western therapy trip
at all. It's like, er, it's really...

525
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:52,177
Oh, man. Are you married?

526
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:54,286
- No.
- OK, well...

527
00:32:54,387 --> 00:32:56,997
I mean,
all truths contain their opposite.

528
00:32:57,023 --> 00:32:59,424
Without black you can't have white,
that sort of thing.

529
00:32:59,425 --> 00:33:00,526
You understand, right?

530
00:33:00,527 --> 00:33:05,537
It's like in order to know something you
have to forget it - that's why we seek it!

531
00:33:06,132 --> 00:33:07,463
OK, OK...

532
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:09,935
I know what you're thinking,
"Who's this crazy guy?"

533
00:33:09,936 --> 00:33:13,205
- No, it's nothing like that. - Yeah,
no, it's OK, it's OK, it's all right!

534
00:33:13,206 --> 00:33:15,040
Well, I'm Dave. Tell me your name again?

535
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:16,702
- Peter.
- Peter, right.

536
00:33:17,544 --> 00:33:18,810
- Peter Bishton.
- Peter Bishton.

537
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:19,811
- Hey.
- Yes.

538
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:24,315
Hey, we got the same colour eyes, man!

539
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,611
All right. Hey, I'll see you.

540
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:34,159
There is an interesting tie
for second place

541
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:36,227
between STASIA and ADVANTAGE.

542
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:37,963
Three and a half points each.

543
00:33:37,964 --> 00:33:43,163
Their only hope is that the top two teams
are going to draw,

544
00:33:43,336 --> 00:33:46,205
but I think that's very unlikely
with CHECKERS and ALLIANCE,

545
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:50,370
two teams that are absolutely
going to go for the kill.

546
00:33:50,543 --> 00:33:51,943
CHECKERS and ALLIANCE!

547
00:33:51,978 --> 00:33:54,708
ALLIANCE,
a kind of traditional program,

548
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:58,177
we like what they do,
but we can kind of figure it out.

549
00:33:58,251 --> 00:34:01,753
But CHECKERS... I've talked about
this several times today -

550
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:05,986
very strange,
very idiosyncratic, very odd.

551
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:09,425
I talked to Mr Papageorge himself
and I said,

552
00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:11,663
"What language is your program in?"

553
00:34:11,664 --> 00:34:13,765
And of course, he wouldn't tell me.

554
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:18,669
So I talked to a couple of other programrs
and they said, "We have no idea.

555
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:21,774
"It could be Sanskrit,
it could be Pig Latin!"

556
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,942
Shh-shh-shh...

557
00:34:30,216 --> 00:34:31,478
Um... Tom.

558
00:34:31,618 --> 00:34:32,618
Hey.

559
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:53,505
I'm sorry, can you go to the bathroom
and wash your hands?

560
00:34:53,506 --> 00:34:54,837
Yes.

561
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:14,020
OK. Let's check her out.

562
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:15,253
OK.

563
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:19,661
So let's run a trace
with test position 62.

564
00:35:19,766 --> 00:35:21,324
OK.

565
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,134
OK, keep scrolling.

566
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,598
OK, next page.

567
00:35:30,276 --> 00:35:33,939
I just don't understand
why it's committing suicide.

568
00:35:34,113 --> 00:35:36,682
It's not killing itself -
it's a computer.

569
00:35:36,683 --> 00:35:38,082
It doesn't have will.

570
00:35:38,184 --> 00:35:41,210
It's running software -
we wrote the software.

571
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:46,554
So there, it's going down the tree

572
00:35:46,726 --> 00:35:50,560
and then it's calling
the evaluation function.

573
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,221
OK, so... keeping that in mind,

574
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:57,895
when you are compiling
with F77, this code...

575
00:35:59,405 --> 00:36:02,307
The F77 that you're running
is not the standard one.

576
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:07,268
I wrote a new compiler, specific to
this hardware and this software.

577
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,015
- Say that again?
- So...

578
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:14,386
The compiler is adding instructions

579
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,546
to implement the machinery
of the optimisations

580
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:20,852
as it's compiling the lines that you see.

581
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:22,887
OK.

582
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:26,531
So you can see those lines of code,
but there's actually more being generated.

583
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:30,161
The system can improve itself
during the game - in the hash -

584
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,938
to run the evaluation and then
to store that evaluation in the hash.

585
00:36:32,939 --> 00:36:34,940
With adjusted parameter settings...

586
00:36:34,941 --> 00:36:36,508
To implement, say,
the transposition table...

587
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:37,809
Additional functionality...

588
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,412
That's right - everything
is not everything!

589
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:42,108
- What?
- There's more.

590
00:36:50,022 --> 00:36:53,116
- OK... That's kind of new.
- Yeah.

591
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,993
OK.

592
00:36:56,129 --> 00:36:57,562
OK.

593
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:01,163
So...

594
00:37:02,535 --> 00:37:04,002
Um...

595
00:37:04,137 --> 00:37:07,787
How do you stay up
through these all night hacking sessions?

596
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,610
I mean, do you want to get a coffee
or something?

597
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:13,612
- No. No, thanks. I'm fine.
- OK.

598
00:37:13,613 --> 00:37:14,946
- I'm fine, thank you.
- OK.

599
00:37:14,947 --> 00:37:18,550
Um, you know, when I was in grad school
I used to do some push-ups sometimes.

600
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:21,816
Keep my blood flowing. Yeah.

601
00:37:21,954 --> 00:37:23,955
No, I think I'm fine,
I don't need to do anything.

602
00:37:23,956 --> 00:37:25,223
OK, no push-ups. So...

603
00:37:25,224 --> 00:37:28,264
I just don't want it to keep losing,
that's all.

604
00:37:29,095 --> 00:37:32,030
I understand,
but this is an advantage for us.

605
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:37,629
Everyone down there
thinks that we're yesterday's news.

606
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,364
But we're getting information now

607
00:37:40,506 --> 00:37:43,275
about how this system is performing
in a tournament setting,

608
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:47,212
and we've got six months
before the world championship in Lisbon,

609
00:37:47,213 --> 00:37:48,780
and no one can catch up to us!

610
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:52,740
Because they haven't seen
the technology in action,

611
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:55,420
- because of this problem.
- Neither have we.

612
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:58,131
Yeah, well,
but we can go back to California

613
00:37:58,224 --> 00:38:00,824
and put the boards
in the testing hardware

614
00:38:00,927 --> 00:38:02,986
and test everything in isolation

615
00:38:03,095 --> 00:38:06,165
based on the parameters
that you're finding here.

616
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,066
We have time...

617
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:13,538
But speaking of time,
I have to get back to my wife and child.

618
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:15,063
Oh, all right, um...

619
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:17,409
Thank you.

620
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,501
- OK. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

621
00:38:23,716 --> 00:38:29,211
Thank you Dr Schoesser -
you're a great adviser and a brilliant man.

622
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:38,549
Convince me not to kick your ass.

623
00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:41,091
Don't kick my ass.

624
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:44,154
Why would you want to kick my ass, John?

625
00:38:44,537 --> 00:38:46,505
You stole something from me.

626
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:53,102
You hadn't talked to Freddy about this?
Is he here, by the way?

627
00:38:53,846 --> 00:38:57,646
Yeah, I took those drugs. The pills.

628
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:02,090
Freddy and I talked about this -
I'm bringing you guys money for them...

629
00:39:02,989 --> 00:39:05,056
John, come on, it's just some money.

630
00:39:05,057 --> 00:39:06,490
What's the big deal?

631
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:09,323
John... John?

632
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:34,840
- Hello?
- Hi.

633
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:36,608
Hi.

634
00:40:39,952 --> 00:40:41,579
I'm sorry, um...

635
00:40:43,055 --> 00:40:45,857
I'm sorry...
I'm Peter from the Caltech team,

636
00:40:45,858 --> 00:40:49,191
and I was wondering -
do you have STASIA here?

637
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:52,462
- Yeah.
- OK, um...

638
00:40:52,632 --> 00:40:57,797
Could I run an experiment
with the two of them, if that's OK?

639
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:02,230
- OK.
- Um...

640
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:04,476
Thanks. Thank you.

641
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:08,113
Can you help me come get it?

642
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:10,810
Yeah, let me go get my glasses.

643
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:12,406
OK.

644
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,488
Pawn A6 to A5.

645
00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:04,058
Knight B3 to D2.

646
00:42:05,037 --> 00:42:06,607
It's still retreating...

647
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:16,006
Hold on, sorry.
Erm, can you try something else?

648
00:42:16,115 --> 00:42:20,051
Can you try just making a move
on your own?

649
00:42:20,853 --> 00:42:23,481
Don't use STASIA.

650
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:25,318
Can you do your own move?

651
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:26,753
What?

652
00:42:26,926 --> 00:42:30,862
Just... Just do... Just do your own move.

653
00:42:30,963 --> 00:42:32,487
On your own.

654
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:36,164
OK.

655
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:40,365
Knight, C6 to...

656
00:42:40,506 --> 00:42:43,074
Just... Well, hold on.
Just think about it a little bit,

657
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:44,372
and then go.

658
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:50,872
Just give it a thought.

659
00:42:55,821 --> 00:42:58,688
Pawn A5 to A4.

660
00:43:17,143 --> 00:43:19,008
Pawn G2 to G4.

661
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:25,383
Now you're waking up.

662
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,817
Pawn E6 to E5.

663
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:49,003
Pawn F4 to F5.

664
00:43:54,146 --> 00:43:55,511
Did you see that?

665
00:43:55,648 --> 00:43:57,809
- It's a weird strategy.
- It's...

666
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,042
Yeah.

667
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:02,453
Yeah, it's revising its strategy.

668
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:08,061
Why do you think it's doing that?

669
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:23,170
Excuse me.

670
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:24,674
Sir?

671
00:44:25,978 --> 00:44:28,173
Sir, you can't sleep there.

672
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:34,619
Sir?

673
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:44,295
It actually turns out a couple didn't
check in for the other conference,

674
00:44:44,296 --> 00:44:46,026
and I have a room available.

675
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:47,871
- Would you like it?
- I would.

676
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,199
- How would you like to pay?
- Tomorrow morning?

677
00:44:54,707 --> 00:44:56,868
Great, here's room 302.

678
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:58,643
Just walk down the hallway,

679
00:44:58,644 --> 00:45:01,934
take the elevator to the third floor
and take a right.

680
00:45:57,603 --> 00:45:59,366
Sounds good.

681
00:45:59,505 --> 00:46:01,530
Good morning.

682
00:46:01,707 --> 00:46:04,637
I don't know
if that's ever happened to you...

683
00:46:05,177 --> 00:46:07,011
You're talking about the dream?

684
00:46:07,012 --> 00:46:08,279
We had the same dream last night.

685
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,714
At least I think
we had the same dream last night.

686
00:46:09,715 --> 00:46:12,383
The more we talked about it,
the more it sounds like we had...

687
00:46:12,384 --> 00:46:15,478
- because I felt like she was there.
- Who is that?

688
00:46:19,992 --> 00:46:21,084
Whoa!

689
00:46:21,193 --> 00:46:22,751
Come here, honey.

690
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,091
Good morning.

691
00:46:27,232 --> 00:46:29,132
Good morning.

692
00:46:31,303 --> 00:46:33,137
Can I help you people with something?

693
00:46:33,138 --> 00:46:34,901
Yes, absolutely.

694
00:46:36,575 --> 00:46:38,125
What can I help you with?

695
00:46:40,512 --> 00:46:42,022
Excuse me, Dr Schoesser?

696
00:46:42,715 --> 00:46:43,715
Can I join you?

697
00:46:43,816 --> 00:46:45,511
Oh, OK, yeah.

698
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:49,520
How are you doing? What's going on?

699
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:51,079
Um...

700
00:46:51,223 --> 00:46:53,524
Well, I really wanted
to talk to you this morning.

701
00:46:53,525 --> 00:46:54,787
Um...

702
00:46:55,661 --> 00:46:58,027
I had a theory that...

703
00:46:59,064 --> 00:47:02,534
I don't think that TSAR
wants to play against computers.

704
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:05,259
And why do you say that?

705
00:47:06,005 --> 00:47:11,409
Well, because last night
after we were working on it,

706
00:47:11,543 --> 00:47:14,842
I took it to an MIT student's room

707
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:20,418
and I had their program STASIA
play against ours.

708
00:47:20,552 --> 00:47:23,612
Wait, you wheeled it over there?

709
00:47:23,756 --> 00:47:26,589
I had a student help me, yes.

710
00:47:26,692 --> 00:47:27,989
OK.

711
00:47:28,093 --> 00:47:30,823
And what did you do with the MIT team?

712
00:47:30,963 --> 00:47:36,265
I just had one student play their program
against ours, that's all.

713
00:47:36,435 --> 00:47:37,732
OK.

714
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:41,169
I just wanted to see another game, and...

715
00:47:43,509 --> 00:47:46,239
The idea I had is, I just had...

716
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:51,671
at first the two programs
playing against each other,

717
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:56,878
and then I had that same student
start generating their own moves, and...

718
00:47:57,823 --> 00:48:01,691
TSAR at first was doing very poor,
just like it had,

719
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,829
and when it started playing
against the student,

720
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:09,594
it was much more aggressive

721
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:12,021
and it played... it performed better.

722
00:48:12,871 --> 00:48:14,270
I... OK, er...

723
00:48:14,406 --> 00:48:18,433
But this was just
part of a game last night, right?

724
00:48:18,544 --> 00:48:19,977
How many moves?

725
00:48:20,112 --> 00:48:22,672
Er... twelve or so.

726
00:48:22,848 --> 00:48:25,248
OK, I...

727
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,717
We just didn't have enough time.

728
00:48:26,718 --> 00:48:31,178
I appreciate your desire
to figure this stuff out,

729
00:48:31,323 --> 00:48:34,025
but I just don't think
that that's enough data

730
00:48:34,026 --> 00:48:39,191
to support this theory
about computers versus human opponents.

731
00:48:39,298 --> 00:48:42,062
I would like
to run some more tests as well.

732
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:46,661
This is just the start of it.
This is just a proposition I have.

733
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,036
It's just such an outlandish theory...

734
00:48:50,142 --> 00:48:54,511
I don't... I don't...
It just doesn't make sense, and, er...

735
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,079
Well...

736
00:48:57,116 --> 00:48:58,116
No...

737
00:48:58,283 --> 00:49:00,683
It's... It's still...

738
00:49:00,853 --> 00:49:03,921
There's still
some significant evidence for it...

739
00:49:03,922 --> 00:49:08,484
I know it's a bit unconventional,

740
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,252
but, um...

741
00:49:11,763 --> 00:49:14,698
There's some others -
like Nikola Tesla...

742
00:49:14,867 --> 00:49:17,268
Who has been talking to you about Tesla?

743
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:19,103
Just some person who mentioned him.

744
00:49:19,104 --> 00:49:23,473
I do not think that Tesla is a good
role model for your academic career.

745
00:49:23,575 --> 00:49:26,271
That is the path to madness.

746
00:49:28,113 --> 00:49:30,343
Do you know about confirmation bias?

747
00:49:30,516 --> 00:49:33,818
Where you're blind to all the things
that will refute your theory

748
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:36,939
and you're fixating
on the things that support it?

749
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:41,448
This is a human trait,

750
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,630
and it's an issue that I've dealt with
in my own work in the past.

751
00:49:47,332 --> 00:49:49,167
TSAR is a very complicated machine,

752
00:49:49,168 --> 00:49:53,195
it has many components,
many connections between them.

753
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:57,338
And right now, some of those connections
are going a little wrong.

754
00:49:58,977 --> 00:50:01,810
Our brains... even more complex.

755
00:50:01,947 --> 00:50:06,748
And I think that
with this theory of yours,

756
00:50:06,919 --> 00:50:09,820
you're making a few wrong connections.

757
00:50:09,955 --> 00:50:15,359
And I'm worried that
if you're fixating on this

758
00:50:15,527 --> 00:50:18,796
the balance of wrong connections
to right connections could shift,

759
00:50:18,797 --> 00:50:21,891
and at that point we've lost our sanity.

760
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:29,767
Dave!

761
00:50:33,745 --> 00:50:35,508
Dave!

762
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:37,707
Dave!

763
00:50:39,851 --> 00:50:41,978
Dave!

764
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:46,046
Monica!

765
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,240
Look deep within me

766
00:51:04,376 --> 00:51:07,140
to find what is inside you.

767
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:12,215
Go. Break through.

768
00:51:12,317 --> 00:51:14,649
Come through, Mr Michael Papageorge.

769
00:51:14,786 --> 00:51:16,344
Fight through!

770
00:51:17,322 --> 00:51:19,654
He's crowning - watch his shoulders!

771
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,125
Rotate his shoulders.

772
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:23,287
Keep fighting, Mr Papageorge.

773
00:51:23,462 --> 00:51:25,430
Squeeze through...

774
00:51:29,835 --> 00:51:32,463
I'm now going to cut your umbilical cord.

775
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,064
Breathe, Mr Papageorge.

776
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:39,800
Breathe, Mr Papageorge!

777
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:47,015
There you go.

778
00:51:48,287 --> 00:51:51,279
Now, what is your name?

779
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,084
Michael Papageorge!

780
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:56,285
Yes. Welcome, Mr Papageorge.

781
00:51:56,428 --> 00:52:02,389
Group, let us greet
the new Michael Papageorge.

782
00:52:03,268 --> 00:52:04,835
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

783
00:52:04,836 --> 00:52:06,103
Hey, it is a good morning.

784
00:52:06,104 --> 00:52:07,537
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

785
00:52:12,311 --> 00:52:14,745
Black, which was winning the game,

786
00:52:14,913 --> 00:52:16,933
has now gone off on this tangent,

787
00:52:17,516 --> 00:52:20,417
chasing after that white king.

788
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:22,787
Can you move your arm please? Thank you.

789
00:52:22,788 --> 00:52:26,123
Chasing the king,
trying to get it up, up on the board,

790
00:52:26,124 --> 00:52:29,890
and in the process
the black bishop is trapped.

791
00:52:29,995 --> 00:52:32,535
There's really nothing much for it to do.

792
00:52:32,597 --> 00:52:35,896
The white king,
which looks naked sitting there,

793
00:52:36,001 --> 00:52:39,528
is actually in a very nice position.

794
00:52:39,705 --> 00:52:41,615
CHECKERS has moved its rook up -

795
00:52:41,707 --> 00:52:45,643
I'm expecting ALLIANCE
to defend this pawn with its knight.

796
00:52:45,744 --> 00:52:47,604
- That was interesting.
- Yeah.

797
00:52:47,713 --> 00:52:49,738
How's your room?

798
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:52,281
Yeah, it's nice.

799
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:54,257
Same as any of 'em, I suppose.

800
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,284
The mini-bar is half-empty.

801
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,867
That's a bit of a surprise move.

802
00:53:18,744 --> 00:53:21,679
CHECKERS happily takes the pawn.

803
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:26,114
But, let me tell you -
that black king is in deep trouble.

804
00:53:30,122 --> 00:53:32,223
Do you have a Jacuzzi tub in your room?

805
00:53:32,224 --> 00:53:34,419
- Mm-mm.
- Jacuzzi tubs are nice.

806
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,890
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

807
00:53:36,027 --> 00:53:37,161
You got one of those?

808
00:53:37,162 --> 00:53:41,031
Yeah - they ran out of rooms so they had
to give me the honeymoon suite.

809
00:53:41,032 --> 00:53:42,226
Mmm, nice.

810
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:43,698
Yeah, it is nice.

811
00:53:43,802 --> 00:53:45,822
Just a matter of luck, I suppose.

812
00:53:56,047 --> 00:53:58,538
Deeply, deeply in trouble.

813
00:54:00,085 --> 00:54:02,505
Let's see what CHECKERS comes up with.

814
00:54:05,991 --> 00:54:07,652
So, Les...

815
00:54:08,894 --> 00:54:11,021
When did the tables turn?

816
00:54:12,197 --> 00:54:16,133
According to my evaluation,
ten moves ago I was up plus five.

817
00:54:16,268 --> 00:54:18,828
But now it looks like I'm busted.

818
00:54:19,871 --> 00:54:23,329
Do you have an evaluation transcript
over there?

819
00:54:23,475 --> 00:54:26,205
I just get the moves on my print-out.

820
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:29,713
Well, there's got to be a record
of that evaluation somewhere.

821
00:54:29,714 --> 00:54:31,682
Could I possibly get a transcript
of that after the game?

822
00:54:31,683 --> 00:54:34,584
I can talk to the powers that be.

823
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:37,321
That would be great
if you could talk to the "powers that be" -

824
00:54:37,322 --> 00:54:39,153
whoever they may be.

825
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:42,293
Put in a word for me, I could really use
a copy of that evaluation transcript.

826
00:54:42,294 --> 00:54:44,128
I'll ask. I'll ask for sure.

827
00:54:44,129 --> 00:54:45,994
Thanks, Les. Lester.

828
00:54:46,097 --> 00:54:48,432
- Put in a word for me.
- I will. Will do.

829
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:49,991
You're welcome.

830
00:54:50,101 --> 00:54:51,659
That's it.

831
00:54:51,803 --> 00:54:53,862
- Thanks. Good game.
- Good game.

832
00:54:54,005 --> 00:54:55,836
Black resigns.

833
00:54:55,941 --> 00:54:58,671
Mate in one more move.

834
00:54:59,678 --> 00:55:02,012
Les, I really would appreciate
a copy of that transcript.

835
00:55:02,013 --> 00:55:04,048
- I'll ask for you...
- Yeah, please do.

836
00:55:04,049 --> 00:55:06,574
I must say that was a very intense game

837
00:55:06,718 --> 00:55:10,017
played between
two wonderful computer chess players

838
00:55:10,121 --> 00:55:12,690
- and we've seen some of the...
- What just happened?

839
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:16,286
I'm talking on camera.
Could you please move?

840
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:18,429
- I'm talking to my camera.
- I understand that, but...

841
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,097
Please talk to my Rules Committee
over here.

842
00:55:20,098 --> 00:55:22,700
- This, the... Your Rules Committee?
- Thank you, John. Thank you.

843
00:55:22,701 --> 00:55:25,102
This one little guy
is your Rules Committee?

844
00:55:25,103 --> 00:55:28,038
That was an amazing game,
an extremely good computer program.

845
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:30,975
What do you think the problem is?
You just saw...

846
00:55:30,976 --> 00:55:33,576
Yes, I just saw
Allied win the tournament.

847
00:55:33,712 --> 00:55:37,079
You just saw...
You just saw Goliath beat David.

848
00:55:37,182 --> 00:55:39,917
And you're paying 'em for it.
You're rewarding 'em for it.

849
00:55:39,918 --> 00:55:42,588
This will be ALLIANCE
versus yours truly...

850
00:55:42,687 --> 00:55:45,155
...creative programming...
- They bought great ability!

851
00:55:45,156 --> 00:55:49,326
If you had that kind of resources,
you would show great ability also!

852
00:56:12,484 --> 00:56:15,044
Hey, Peter! Hey, how are you?

853
00:56:15,153 --> 00:56:16,643
No ice!

854
00:56:16,755 --> 00:56:18,389
Hey, what are you doing right now?

855
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:20,157
Hey, why don't you
come say hi to Pauline?

856
00:56:20,158 --> 00:56:23,093
- Who?
- My wife. Come on!

857
00:56:23,194 --> 00:56:24,889
Let's meet Pauline.

858
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:27,965
- Yeah, I've been... You all right?
- Yeah.

859
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:29,833
I've been telling her about you.

860
00:56:29,834 --> 00:56:31,267
Yeah.

861
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:41,910
Sweetie?

862
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:44,681
- Are you decent?
- What?

863
00:56:44,816 --> 00:56:47,184
I brought a friend here.
I met Peter, my friend, in the hallway.

864
00:56:47,185 --> 00:56:48,619
Come on in, Peter. Hey.

865
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,354
Is it OK? I'm gonna bring him in.

866
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:51,855
- Yes, yeah.
- All right.

867
00:56:53,191 --> 00:56:55,326
- Oh, hi. Hi, Peter.
- This is my wife, Pauline.

868
00:56:55,327 --> 00:56:58,125
- Pauline, Peter.
- Oh, welcome, welcome.

869
00:56:58,263 --> 00:56:59,663
Hey, come on in. Have a seat.

870
00:56:59,664 --> 00:57:01,974
- Put you right over there.
- OK. Yeah.

871
00:57:04,069 --> 00:57:05,536
Hey, no ice.

872
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:07,137
- Oh.
- Oh.

873
00:57:08,006 --> 00:57:11,908
So, I wish we could offer you
a drink or something, but...

874
00:57:12,043 --> 00:57:15,376
Yeah, our guy, Keneiloe,
he just says, "No...

875
00:57:15,547 --> 00:57:16,747
"No alcohol, no dope."

876
00:57:16,748 --> 00:57:18,482
Keneiloe is very strict
about that sort of thing.

877
00:57:18,483 --> 00:57:22,852
Right, right. He says it's a
spiritual shortcut - unearned grace.

878
00:57:24,155 --> 00:57:27,556
- Have you ever tried LSD?
- Oh, honey, come on!

879
00:57:27,692 --> 00:57:29,093
Spanish Inquisition over here.

880
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:31,974
Give the boy some room here,
let him settle in.

881
00:57:32,864 --> 00:57:33,956
Er, no...

882
00:57:34,766 --> 00:57:36,165
Er...

883
00:57:37,168 --> 00:57:41,218
I've read about it though,
and I thought it was interesting how...

884
00:57:41,272 --> 00:57:43,433
just a temporary hallucination

885
00:57:43,575 --> 00:57:46,271
can have a permanent effect
on some people,

886
00:57:46,411 --> 00:57:50,575
on their... on their consciousness,
just chemically.

887
00:57:57,322 --> 00:58:00,780
I love the way his mind is... working.

888
00:58:03,495 --> 00:58:05,229
Dave's just crazy about you guys.

889
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:09,428
It's like he's a little kid
and the circus is in town.

890
00:58:09,534 --> 00:58:12,196
He just wants to run away.

891
00:58:12,303 --> 00:58:14,203
It's true, I want to run away.

892
00:58:14,305 --> 00:58:17,468
Hey, let me get you something - a soda...

893
00:58:17,642 --> 00:58:20,132
water from the tap, something like that?

894
00:58:21,913 --> 00:58:27,579
I know that you've told Dave all about
your computers and your technology,

895
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:32,088
but has Dave taken a moment
to tell you what we're doing here?

896
00:58:32,924 --> 00:58:33,924
A little bit.

897
00:58:34,092 --> 00:58:37,728
Don't you think it's strange
that we're all here at the same time?

898
00:58:37,729 --> 00:58:42,132
Pauline and I don't actually believe
there's such a thing as...

899
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,426
Coincidence.

900
00:58:43,535 --> 00:58:45,025
...coincidence. - Yeah.

901
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:49,889
We're all kind of like seekers here.

902
00:58:54,312 --> 00:58:57,475
You know what I think
is so neat about you guys

903
00:58:57,582 --> 00:59:02,246
is you're kind of like mental explorers.

904
00:59:02,353 --> 00:59:03,445
Hmm.

905
00:59:03,555 --> 00:59:04,855
You know, I mean, with the computers

906
00:59:04,856 --> 00:59:07,324
you're kind of like way out there
like Columbus,

907
00:59:07,325 --> 00:59:09,526
sailing the ocean blue,
uncharted new territory.

908
00:59:09,527 --> 00:59:11,328
You don't know what you're going to find.

909
00:59:11,329 --> 00:59:14,531
There may be something really beautiful
on the other side.

910
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:17,695
But Peter, did you ever ask yourself,

911
00:59:17,802 --> 00:59:21,135
"How many squares
are there on a chessboard?"

912
00:59:22,173 --> 00:59:23,663
64.

913
00:59:23,808 --> 00:59:25,676
It's an eight-by-eight grid.

914
00:59:25,677 --> 00:59:28,874
Well, but don't you see
how limited that is?

915
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,140
No...

916
00:59:30,982 --> 00:59:36,142
It's actually very complex when you start
to think about it as a programming problem.

917
00:59:36,955 --> 00:59:40,724
Just the number of possible games
explode exponentially with each move.

918
00:59:40,725 --> 00:59:45,094
It's close to 10 to 120th power,

919
00:59:45,196 --> 00:59:49,098
and to try and compute all those games

920
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,402
might take even longer
than humanity would be around to do so.

921
00:59:52,403 --> 00:59:54,462
Oh, wow.

922
00:59:55,974 --> 00:59:57,908
Oh, man.

923
00:59:58,777 --> 01:00:02,269
But look at the whole world -

924
01:00:02,413 --> 01:00:05,211
you want to be the best chess player,

925
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:07,140
and that's beautiful, it is,

926
01:00:07,252 --> 01:00:09,948
and I honour the beauty of that,

927
01:00:10,121 --> 01:00:13,488
and the passion
you have to do a thing like that.

928
01:00:13,591 --> 01:00:17,728
But I have to be truthful and tell you that
it also breaks my heart just a little bit,

929
01:00:17,729 --> 01:00:23,361
because you could be
the greatest chess master who ever lived

930
01:00:23,535 --> 01:00:27,767
and still not begin
to tap into your full potential!

931
01:00:27,939 --> 01:00:30,741
I don't want to be a chess player,
it's programming...

932
01:00:30,742 --> 01:00:32,643
Right, right, but if you're a programr,

933
01:00:32,644 --> 01:00:35,212
you know, the best programr,
I mean, you could be the greatest...

934
01:00:35,213 --> 01:00:36,613
I mean, he could be the president of IBM...

935
01:00:36,614 --> 01:00:40,250
Well, Dave, he could be the President
of the United States and...

936
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:43,345
Right, and still not live up
to his potential.

937
01:00:51,396 --> 01:00:53,876
Have you been with a lot of women, Peter?

938
01:01:00,505 --> 01:01:01,802
Hey.

939
01:01:01,906 --> 01:01:03,407
I think I should probably go.

940
01:01:03,408 --> 01:01:05,774
Oh, come on.

941
01:01:06,978 --> 01:01:10,277
Well, I mean,
if you get your kicks some other way...

942
01:01:12,917 --> 01:01:15,977
Oh. Oh, yeah. We are very open.

943
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,055
We're very accepting, and...

944
01:01:20,658 --> 01:01:21,892
You know, I hate to say it,

945
01:01:21,893 --> 01:01:28,389
but we are actually old enough
to be your parents, and...

946
01:01:29,734 --> 01:01:32,567
if you want to think of
us that way, well...

947
01:01:38,509 --> 01:01:41,099
I don't understand what you mean by that.

948
01:01:43,514 --> 01:01:44,674
Peter...

949
01:01:47,452 --> 01:01:49,682
If you want to leave, it's OK.

950
01:01:51,556 --> 01:01:53,724
- You're not gonna hurt our feelings.
- No.

951
01:01:53,725 --> 01:01:56,990
It's... You know,
it's a free country, so...

952
01:01:57,929 --> 01:02:02,866
But, honey,
if you want to stay, that's OK, too.

953
01:02:04,702 --> 01:02:07,037
But if you stay, there's just one rule.

954
01:02:07,038 --> 01:02:10,633
And that is that you have to be free.

955
01:02:10,742 --> 01:02:13,233
No 64 squares on a board.

956
01:02:13,344 --> 01:02:16,871
No squares, no board, just...

957
01:02:17,048 --> 01:02:18,675
life!

958
01:02:19,717 --> 01:02:21,241
Squares.

959
01:02:22,086 --> 01:02:25,055
- I think we're the squares here.
- Maybe.

960
01:02:27,792 --> 01:02:29,942
We're just normal everyday people -

961
01:02:30,094 --> 01:02:32,074
a schoolteacher and a secretary.

962
01:02:34,732 --> 01:02:36,667
Why don't you just come
sit down on the bed next to us?

963
01:02:36,668 --> 01:02:39,136
Just sit next to us, that's all...

964
01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:55,115
You know what I like?

965
01:02:55,286 --> 01:02:58,278
I like to get the back of my neck kissed.

966
01:02:58,389 --> 01:03:00,084
Just like Dave is doing.

967
01:03:00,224 --> 01:03:04,320
Just so lightly that...

968
01:03:04,495 --> 01:03:07,191
that it almost tickles.

969
01:03:17,842 --> 01:03:19,342
What do you like, Peter?

970
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:23,113
Peter, you know,

971
01:03:23,247 --> 01:03:27,081
giving pleasure and receiving pleasure...

972
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:30,587
they're the same thing.

973
01:03:31,622 --> 01:03:33,002
Two wants to be three.

974
01:03:41,065 --> 01:03:42,327
Papageorge.

975
01:03:42,467 --> 01:03:43,764
Freddy.

976
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:50,102
I was talking to John.

977
01:03:50,775 --> 01:03:53,300
He said that you were gonna pay us.

978
01:03:53,444 --> 01:03:58,848
He thought that you were
gonna win that prize, the money...

979
01:04:00,485 --> 01:04:02,745
I was planning on winning that prize.

980
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:05,255
But you...

981
01:04:05,356 --> 01:04:07,090
You guys worried about the money
that I owe you?

982
01:04:07,091 --> 01:04:09,292
Well, we got bills.
You took pills from us.

983
01:04:09,293 --> 01:04:11,955
Yeah, I got bills to pay.

984
01:04:13,231 --> 01:04:14,459
All right, well...

985
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:17,701
I haven't had a chance to leave
the hotel yet to get any money.

986
01:04:17,702 --> 01:04:19,932
I don't have a car.

987
01:04:21,072 --> 01:04:24,074
I don't know when you guys would have
expected me to go get the money -

988
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:25,275
I've been here the whole time.

989
01:04:25,276 --> 01:04:26,676
- I have a car.
- You have a car?

990
01:04:26,677 --> 01:04:29,079
They got this guy there
- this African guru.

991
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,881
I mean, I don't even know
if he really <i>is</i> African.

992
01:04:30,882 --> 01:04:33,383
The guy's probably from Detroit
or something.

993
01:04:33,384 --> 01:04:35,654
They're just chanting and ranting...

994
01:04:36,621 --> 01:04:39,601
Uh, I tell you.
It's all over for the white man.

995
01:04:40,892 --> 01:04:43,994
I wonder how much those people paid
for that conference anyway?

996
01:04:43,995 --> 01:04:46,395
At least I got my catharsis for free.

997
01:04:47,098 --> 01:04:48,588
Blllaah!

998
01:04:51,302 --> 01:04:52,428
Freddy!

999
01:04:53,905 --> 01:04:55,395
It's marketing.

1000
01:04:55,506 --> 01:04:56,632
Right.

1001
01:04:56,741 --> 01:04:58,368
- Tom Schoesser.
- Tom?

1002
01:04:58,509 --> 01:05:01,945
He sold his program to Allied Labs,
that's what happened.

1003
01:05:01,946 --> 01:05:03,613
TSAR threw the competition.

1004
01:05:03,614 --> 01:05:05,515
He sold his program to Allied,

1005
01:05:05,516 --> 01:05:08,618
and they plugged it into their machine,
and that's the machine that beat me.

1006
01:05:08,619 --> 01:05:10,554
I mean, come on,
it's just the Turk all over again!

1007
01:05:10,555 --> 01:05:12,522
Instead of a man
hiding inside of a machine,

1008
01:05:12,523 --> 01:05:15,773
it's a program
hiding inside of another program.

1009
01:05:16,294 --> 01:05:18,694
Mediocrity triumphs again.

1010
01:05:18,863 --> 01:05:20,854
Always.

1011
01:05:21,699 --> 01:05:23,724
Just take... just take...

1012
01:05:23,901 --> 01:05:26,503
Just take a mediocre...
Just take a mediocre program

1013
01:05:26,504 --> 01:05:28,802
and turbo-charge it.

1014
01:05:28,906 --> 01:05:31,986
Just take something mediocre
and turbo-charge it.

1015
01:05:40,685 --> 01:05:42,152
OK.

1016
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,921
We've made some strides this year,

1017
01:05:44,922 --> 01:05:47,357
we've had a couple of issues
on the other hand.

1018
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:53,092
I apologise to anybody here
who has had cat allergies.

1019
01:05:53,264 --> 01:05:54,629
Miaow!

1020
01:05:54,732 --> 01:05:56,466
It's not gonna happen next time,

1021
01:05:56,467 --> 01:06:00,097
we're gonna be in a different hotel,
don't worry about it.

1022
01:06:00,338 --> 01:06:04,074
So now we go onto the awards -
the real reason we're here today.

1023
01:06:04,075 --> 01:06:06,675
So we're gonna start with the third prize,

1024
01:06:06,811 --> 01:06:10,042
and the winner of course
is the STASIA team,

1025
01:06:10,148 --> 01:06:14,141
and that is led
by our dear friend Mr McVey.

1026
01:06:18,022 --> 01:06:20,081
You guys come up.

1027
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:29,190
He's very generously
bringing his team up.

1028
01:06:29,934 --> 01:06:32,494
Congratulations to a great team.

1029
01:06:32,603 --> 01:06:35,367
Really beautiful programming...

1030
01:06:37,408 --> 01:06:40,935
This is the team that's got a lady on it -
there she is.

1031
01:06:41,612 --> 01:06:45,776
That's the first time for our conference
and we welcome her.

1032
01:06:45,917 --> 01:06:47,782
Thanks for being here.

1033
01:06:47,919 --> 01:06:49,284
Thank you.

1034
01:06:50,121 --> 01:06:51,588
The STASIA team!

1035
01:06:58,362 --> 01:07:02,132
Before we present the second prize,
we have a little surprise -

1036
01:07:02,266 --> 01:07:05,099
an amusement from the NOOG team.

1037
01:07:05,203 --> 01:07:08,238
I'm gonna get this right,
this is what the NOOG team has set up.

1038
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:13,370
They wrote up a little program, it's
up here, to run a predictive algorithm.

1039
01:07:13,544 --> 01:07:15,444
They charted every room

1040
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:19,414
that Mr Papageorge has attempted
to stay in over the weekend.

1041
01:07:20,484 --> 01:07:24,147
They spit out a prediction
of what room he would end up in -

1042
01:07:24,288 --> 01:07:28,019
and that is Room 217.

1043
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:29,939
That's the big winner. 217!

1044
01:07:30,027 --> 01:07:32,462
That's just a math joke... a math joke.

1045
01:07:32,463 --> 01:07:36,058
OK. Is Mike in the room?

1046
01:07:36,234 --> 01:07:37,826
Is Mike here?

1047
01:07:47,111 --> 01:07:50,478
All right, boys or gentlemen -

1048
01:07:50,615 --> 01:07:53,316
or young men,
or whatever you want to call yourselves -

1049
01:07:53,317 --> 01:07:54,884
it's time for your refreshment.

1050
01:07:54,885 --> 01:07:57,487
- Thanks, Mom.
- Well, you're quite welcome.

1051
01:07:57,488 --> 01:07:59,723
And by the way, Freddy, do you know Luke?

1052
01:07:59,724 --> 01:08:01,624
No, I don't know Luke.

1053
01:08:01,726 --> 01:08:04,894
Well, it's time you got acquainted.
Do you know Luke?

1054
01:08:04,895 --> 01:08:06,453
No, I don't know Luke.

1055
01:08:07,398 --> 01:08:09,662
Luke 15:11 through 32.

1056
01:08:10,501 --> 01:08:12,001
Try and decode this one.

1057
01:08:12,069 --> 01:08:16,165
So, Luke tells... these are parables,
these little stories.

1058
01:08:16,307 --> 01:08:18,675
Like "The Prodigal Son",
that's a parable.

1059
01:08:18,676 --> 01:08:20,343
There's one about the lost coin,

1060
01:08:20,344 --> 01:08:22,479
a woman who was preparing for a wedding

1061
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,115
and she had to have so many coins,
and she lost one.

1062
01:08:25,116 --> 01:08:28,318
And she just tore the house up
looking for that coin.

1063
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:31,083
All right?
Now it's called the Holy Bible.

1064
01:08:32,123 --> 01:08:33,573
Well, Bible means book.

1065
01:08:33,624 --> 01:08:36,024
- And what does "holy" mean?
- Blessed.

1066
01:08:36,127 --> 01:08:39,585
Mom, where is the box?
I left a little box here.

1067
01:08:39,697 --> 01:08:41,264
It's a small wooden box, Mom!

1068
01:08:41,265 --> 01:08:44,301
I haven't seen it.
I haven't seen any kind of box.

1069
01:08:44,302 --> 01:08:46,332
You must have moved it somewhere!

1070
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:47,894
I left it right here.

1071
01:08:48,072 --> 01:08:50,492
Well, if I moved it, I was unconscious.

1072
01:08:50,574 --> 01:08:54,738
Look... you know that shelf
your daddy built above the tub?

1073
01:08:54,912 --> 01:08:57,580
It's a small wooden box.
It has money in it.

1074
01:08:57,581 --> 01:08:58,581
Wow.

1075
01:08:58,716 --> 01:09:02,413
You know, there was an old man
called Uncle Otto.

1076
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,322
And he was nobody's uncle
but everybody's uncle.

1077
01:09:05,323 --> 01:09:08,313
And he hid his money
in a fruit jar, sealed it...

1078
01:09:08,326 --> 01:09:10,493
- I don't have time for this story
right now! - ...and buried it...

1079
01:09:10,494 --> 01:09:14,364
- I need to find this box! It has money in it!
- ..In a horse's stall out in the big barn.

1080
01:09:14,365 --> 01:09:17,967
- Well, the barn caught on fire, and...
- It's a small wooden box. It has money in it!

1081
01:09:17,968 --> 01:09:21,705
...the whole thing collapsed.
Tin was covering up his fruit jar.

1082
01:09:21,706 --> 01:09:25,267
And he finally had confessed the story
to his neighbours,

1083
01:09:25,409 --> 01:09:28,901
they came in and dug and looked
and never found it.

1084
01:09:29,613 --> 01:09:32,782
- Two years later, in some muck...
- It's a small wooden box.

1085
01:09:32,783 --> 01:09:35,518
...and some brush and some moss...
- It has money in it.

1086
01:09:35,519 --> 01:09:38,750
...in a creek, the jar was discovered.

1087
01:09:38,923 --> 01:09:40,447
It was perfectly sealed.

1088
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:44,253
The money was there,
but Uncle Otto was gone.

1089
01:09:44,362 --> 01:09:45,795
Lost in a loop...

1090
01:09:51,168 --> 01:09:52,499
Thank you.

1091
01:09:52,636 --> 01:09:54,570
And he's taking the cheque.

1092
01:09:54,739 --> 01:09:56,468
I would too.

1093
01:09:57,842 --> 01:10:01,005
Very inventive program,
very bold this year.

1094
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:06,340
Another round of applause for this guy.
He really is a winner.

1095
01:10:14,325 --> 01:10:16,122
Smile for the camera.

1096
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:19,627
- And thank you. All right.
- Thank you.

1097
01:10:21,031 --> 01:10:25,161
OK, this marks the official end
to our tournament this year.

1098
01:10:25,336 --> 01:10:28,438
For those of you who are not getting
immediately on an airplane,

1099
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:32,569
I advise you come around tomorrow
for a spectacular game

1100
01:10:32,743 --> 01:10:36,509
between the winning ALLIANCE team,
computers,

1101
01:10:36,647 --> 01:10:39,172
and me, a human person.

1102
01:10:39,283 --> 01:10:42,473
- That's it. Man versus
machine. Right, Les? - Right.

1103
01:10:42,586 --> 01:10:44,645
OK. The adventure continues,

1104
01:10:44,789 --> 01:10:47,549
and we're gonna see
all you folks next year.

1105
01:10:54,298 --> 01:10:56,299
Thank you.
Thank you all so much for coming.

1106
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,569
We really look forward to seeing
what you bring next year.

1107
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:02,038
The adventure continues.

1108
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,621
Are you sure I can't get you something?

1109
01:11:18,622 --> 01:11:20,249
- No.
- Shirley Temple?

1110
01:11:22,493 --> 01:11:24,223
Can you just leave me alone?

1111
01:11:27,498 --> 01:11:28,498
Hi, Peter.

1112
01:11:28,532 --> 01:11:32,298
- May I have a glass of house red, please.
- Sure.

1113
01:11:33,037 --> 01:11:34,265
Thank you.

1114
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:38,067
Talk about complex systems.

1115
01:11:38,209 --> 01:11:41,644
"Garbage in, garbage out."

1116
01:11:41,645 --> 01:11:45,682
You input garbage into the computer,
or the data, you're gonna get it out.

1117
01:11:45,683 --> 01:11:47,708
But the program is perfect!

1118
01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:51,287
The program calculated exactly
what you wanted. You know?

1119
01:11:51,288 --> 01:11:53,056
You want to know the real future
of computers?

1120
01:11:53,057 --> 01:11:54,581
Tell me.

1121
01:11:54,725 --> 01:11:56,090
Dating.

1122
01:11:58,829 --> 01:12:01,431
You mean computers are going
to start dating each other?

1123
01:12:01,432 --> 01:12:03,297
- No.
- Science of attraction?

1124
01:12:03,467 --> 01:12:05,196
We'll use 'em for dating.

1125
01:12:06,103 --> 01:12:08,638
You know,
we got a couple young people here.

1126
01:12:08,639 --> 01:12:11,374
- I want to hear this.
- What attracts them to each other?

1127
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:14,640
I'm wondering
if you could program a computer,

1128
01:12:14,745 --> 01:12:17,514
you know, with the inputs
on these signs of attraction?

1129
01:12:17,515 --> 01:12:19,516
- It's all about strategy.
- Right.

1130
01:12:19,517 --> 01:12:20,557
Just like chess.

1131
01:12:20,684 --> 01:12:23,278
Here we go. Go on.

1132
01:12:23,954 --> 01:12:26,047
- Just...
- What's your strategy?

1133
01:12:26,891 --> 01:12:27,891
Yeah?

1134
01:12:30,528 --> 01:12:31,893
I don't have one.

1135
01:12:32,062 --> 01:12:35,520
I'll tell you. When I met my wife,
years ago in college,

1136
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:39,635
I knew her one day
before we had that magical moment.

1137
01:12:39,737 --> 01:12:41,830
So what happens with that?

1138
01:12:41,939 --> 01:12:45,375
When people see each other
and get that reaction? I mean...

1139
01:12:45,376 --> 01:12:47,708
I mean... You're a video guy.

1140
01:12:49,346 --> 01:12:51,536
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what do you see, man?

1141
01:12:51,549 --> 01:12:52,846
What do I see?

1142
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:54,380
What do you see? Yeah.

1143
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,120
I don't know - you want to look
through the camera and see what I see?

1144
01:13:01,592 --> 01:13:03,890
You want to look through the camera?

1145
01:13:03,994 --> 01:13:05,256
Yeah.

1146
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:07,895
Go pick it up. Test it out.

1147
01:13:07,998 --> 01:13:09,832
- You ever use a video camera?
- No.

1148
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:11,994
- Check it out.
- OK.

1149
01:13:12,136 --> 01:13:14,195
Wow! Wow, wow, wow.

1150
01:13:31,989 --> 01:13:34,457
Have you, in your dealings
with the other teams,

1151
01:13:34,458 --> 01:13:38,224
heard any rumours or speculation

1152
01:13:38,362 --> 01:13:42,196
that the Allied Labs team

1153
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:45,530
paid Professor Schoesser
to throw the tournament?

1154
01:13:45,669 --> 01:13:46,669
No.

1155
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:47,770
Good.

1156
01:13:47,838 --> 01:13:50,608
I can tell you
that that is completely false.

1157
01:13:53,544 --> 01:13:55,910
Have you heard another rumour

1158
01:13:56,013 --> 01:13:59,723
that there's been interest
from the Pentagon in our project?

1159
01:14:02,486 --> 01:14:03,851
No.

1160
01:14:04,021 --> 01:14:05,454
That one's true.

1161
01:14:08,192 --> 01:14:11,594
And, in fact, they've been
following the project for some time.

1162
01:14:11,595 --> 01:14:13,997
They're aware of the failures
we've been having

1163
01:14:13,998 --> 01:14:17,263
and they don't understand them either.

1164
01:14:17,401 --> 01:14:20,470
And the reason the Professor was late
to the tournament

1165
01:14:20,471 --> 01:14:25,875
was because they had detained him
for some sort of questioning.

1166
01:14:31,081 --> 01:14:34,831
I want to tell you something
that I haven't told anyone else.

1167
01:14:35,019 --> 01:14:38,439
And I hope you'll use discretion
with this information.

1168
01:14:40,424 --> 01:14:45,589
You know that my own work
is primarily experimental psychology -

1169
01:14:45,696 --> 01:14:47,497
broader applications or implications

1170
01:14:47,498 --> 01:14:50,099
of the same artificial intelligence work
that we're doing?

1171
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,294
Yes.

1172
01:14:54,271 --> 01:15:00,676
Not necessarily having told Tom
I was doing this,

1173
01:15:00,811 --> 01:15:05,771
I used some of the TSAR software
in a personal project.

1174
01:15:08,452 --> 01:15:11,080
I was up very late one night -

1175
01:15:11,221 --> 01:15:13,489
in the lab running experiments -
I saw something anomalous...

1176
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:16,125
something that I told myself
for a long time didn't happen,

1177
01:15:16,126 --> 01:15:19,095
that it was some kind of a practical joke,
or RF interference -

1178
01:15:19,096 --> 01:15:22,657
something deeper and stranger,
possibly more exciting!

1179
01:15:22,766 --> 01:15:26,646
I saw something that night
that I can only describe as chilling.

1180
01:17:47,411 --> 01:17:49,321
I just thought you should know.

1181
01:17:51,181 --> 01:17:52,409
Thank you.

1182
01:18:51,642 --> 01:18:53,473
- Hi.
- Hi.

1183
01:18:53,644 --> 01:18:55,339
Um... hi.

1184
01:18:56,513 --> 01:19:01,109
Peter, your strange ideas from last night -
they really got to me.

1185
01:19:01,285 --> 01:19:03,719
This morning I woke up
and everything was weird.

1186
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:07,087
I walked out into the lobby
of the conference

1187
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:12,059
and I looked down and everybody
looked like they were chess pieces.

1188
01:19:12,162 --> 01:19:16,462
I saw Professor Schoesser standing there -
he was the king,

1189
01:19:16,566 --> 01:19:21,868
and Henderson was zig-zagging,
going diagonals like a bishop.

1190
01:19:22,005 --> 01:19:26,567
And there was a student
who was stepping forward,

1191
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:27,800
just like a pawn.

1192
01:19:27,878 --> 01:19:30,980
And just as he was about
to hit Professor Schoesser,

1193
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:34,576
his wife swooped in to defend him,
just like a queen.

1194
01:19:34,718 --> 01:19:39,246
And I kept thinking
that a knight was gonna teleport...

1195
01:19:40,357 --> 01:19:42,217
Did you see any teleportation?

1196
01:19:43,126 --> 01:19:44,684
No.

1197
01:19:44,828 --> 01:19:46,295
No...

1198
01:19:48,932 --> 01:19:51,400
Um... did you see anything where...

1199
01:19:52,536 --> 01:19:54,904
like if two bodies would come together,

1200
01:19:54,905 --> 01:19:56,896
one of them would disappear?

1201
01:19:58,542 --> 01:19:59,873
No.

1202
01:20:02,212 --> 01:20:03,543
OK.

1203
01:20:08,618 --> 01:20:10,085
All right.

1204
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:11,585
Well, thanks.

1205
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:14,218
Er... good night.

1206
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:16,592
Good night.

1207
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:32,637
Hello, sir.

1208
01:20:32,776 --> 01:20:35,301
We are a group of hearts and minds.

1209
01:20:35,445 --> 01:20:36,742
Oh, I see...

1210
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,614
That's very nice, but listen -

1211
01:20:38,615 --> 01:20:40,850
you're gonna have to get out of here,
take your group,

1212
01:20:40,851 --> 01:20:44,331
because I have this room reserved
for a chess tournament.

1213
01:20:44,388 --> 01:20:46,055
There's a chess tournament in 20 minutes

1214
01:20:46,056 --> 01:20:48,456
and I'm bringing in chessboards,

1215
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:51,093
I'm bringing in a computer,
there are 20 people coming.

1216
01:20:51,094 --> 01:20:53,763
So just take your group
and you'll have to leave.

1217
01:20:53,764 --> 01:20:55,724
Er... no, sir. We cannot leave.

1218
01:20:55,832 --> 01:20:57,392
I have the room reserved.

1219
01:20:57,501 --> 01:20:59,702
You don't have it reserved.
I have it for the whole weekend!

1220
01:20:59,703 --> 01:21:01,971
Every day I have it with the management.

1221
01:21:01,972 --> 01:21:04,273
We've had a chess tournament all weekend,

1222
01:21:04,274 --> 01:21:06,809
- people from all around...
- But today is Monday, sir.

1223
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:09,643
I know. Well, Monday is part of the...

1224
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:11,077
Yes.

1225
01:21:12,449 --> 01:21:14,250
Um, perhaps
we can speak with the manager?

1226
01:21:14,251 --> 01:21:16,611
No, no, let's not talk to the manager.

1227
01:21:26,329 --> 01:21:29,423
Um... excuse me, people.
We have an agreement.

1228
01:21:29,533 --> 01:21:30,533
Shh.

1229
01:22:39,603 --> 01:22:41,901
Don't you people have any respect?

1230
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,264
Pat, Pat... it's OK.

1231
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:20,985
Pat, forget about them.
Forget about them.

1232
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:59,782
...breaking down walls.
- I didn't see two of us, I saw one of us.

1233
01:23:59,783 --> 01:24:02,685
Seriously, I don't think
I ever saw him the way I saw him just now.

1234
01:24:02,686 --> 01:24:04,517
A much deeper connection...

1235
01:24:04,654 --> 01:24:07,156
There was a warm communion
that came through...

1236
01:24:07,157 --> 01:24:09,858
I wanted to, just, take her clothes off
in that moment.

1237
01:24:09,859 --> 01:24:12,169
Excellent. Did you hear what he said?

1238
01:24:12,195 --> 01:24:14,196
He wanted to take off her clothes...

1239
01:24:14,197 --> 01:24:16,887
Well, I have to think
it was my mom and dad.

1240
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,100
I have to think it was Biblical...

1241
01:24:18,101 --> 01:24:22,771
- What even does the love taste like?
- Dangerous and potentially catastrophic.

1242
01:24:22,806 --> 01:24:25,641
I think all of us can see mates
right down the line.

1243
01:24:25,642 --> 01:24:27,109
No, I don't do anything like that.

1244
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:29,237
- Wow. OK.
- I love doing this.

1245
01:24:29,379 --> 01:24:31,569

01:25:28,505 --> 01:25:31,115
Professor Beuscher, I'm very, very sorry.
