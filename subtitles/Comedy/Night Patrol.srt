1
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,720
Take it, brother.

2
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,320
Let me break you.

3
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,520
Man, that was funky.

4
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,800
-Fore!
-Well, I guess the meeting's started.

5
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,960
-Howdy, sir?
-Mahoney! Jones!

6
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,200
Thank you, Sweetchuck.

7
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,200
I've had the most wonderful news
about my new program.

8
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,920
-What new program is that, sir?
-My citizens on patrol.

9
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,960
I call it C.O.P. for short.

10
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,200
Has a nice policey ring to it,
don't you think?

11
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,840
What is C.O.P., sir?

12
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,200
What is the most frustrating thing
about police work?

13
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,840
-Not being able to carry hand grenades.
-Separate locker rooms, sir.

14
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,640
Icky blue uniforms.

15
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,640
I always thought
that the most frustrating thing was that...

16
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,560
we couldn't be everywhere at once
to solve every crime.

17
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
So the public ends up
thinking of us as enemies.

18
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,240
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if we could all be friends?

19
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,600
Officer Mahoney, please come in.

20
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,840
Have some lemonade. I love lemonade.

21
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,400
-Not too tart, not--
-Too sweet, just good.

22
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,960
So C.O.P. is
a community action program, sir.

23
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,160
-Like Neighborhood Watch?
-More. Much more!

24
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,800
We show the community that we care.

25
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,440
We train volunteers in crime detection,
in first-aid and....

26
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,320
-And it's a great idea, sir.
-But we need citizen support.

27
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,560
With all this neighborhood crime,
I'm sure you'll get it.

28
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,920
-Fore!
-Right. What if we were to....

29
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,520
What was that?

30
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,640
I believe brother Sweetchuck
is suggesting...

31
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,760
we recruit in our old neighborhood.

32
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,800
Excellent. We have the full support
of the Mayor...

33
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,920
and best of all, the Governor of the state
wants me to unveil the program...

34
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,320
at the end of
the International Police Seminar...

35
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,960
next month in England.

36
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,560
While I attend the seminar...

37
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,560
you, my good friends...

38
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,640
will put C.O.P. into action.

39
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,200
It will change community relations
all around the world.

40
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,400
The Lassard Method.

41
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,600
It rolls nicely off the tongue,
don't you think?

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,640
Hi! What did I miss?

43
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,760
Hi.

44
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,560
Capt. Harris,
Police Commissioner Hurst is here.

45
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,760
You want to see him?

46
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
No. Send him packing.

47
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,920
Yes, sir.

48
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,400
-Proctor!
-Yes, sir?

49
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,000
Send the Commissioner in immediately.

50
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,240
-I thought you said to send him packing.
-Immediately!

51
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,520
Yes, sir.

52
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,360
Nincompoop.

53
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,400
Commissioner.

54
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,720
-You have a problem, Capt. Harris?
-Yes, sir.

55
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,440
Commissioner, I am extremely concerned
with this memorandum from Lassard...

56
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,120
about his C.O.P. program.

57
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,600
Citizens doing police work?
An asinine idea.

58
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,560
If this goes through, no policeman's job,
no policeman's paycheck, will be safe.

59
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,160
Are you through, Captain?

60
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,600
The Governor of this state thinks
that this program is absolutely brilliant.

61
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,360
So until he changes his mind,
that's what you and I think, too.

62
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,840
Agreed?

63
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,960
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

64
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,000
You were right.
You should have sent him packing.

65
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,320
I don't give a damn
what the Governor or the Mayor thinks.

66
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,600
Lassard's program is a mistake...

67
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,320
and anyone who thinks otherwise
is wrong.

68
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,440
Pure and simple.

69
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,040
Don't touch those!

70
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,440
Don't you ever touch my balls
without asking!

71
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,720
You're gonna have to leave.
I'll call the police. I mean it.

72
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,960
Okay, I'm going. I'm out of here.

73
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,520
Wait a minute. I am the police.

74
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,440
-No, you're not.
-That's me. I'm here to speak about C.O.P.

75
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm sorry. I didn't....
Without the uniform on--

76
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,400
Regular human clothes
make people more comfortable.

77
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,720
Hi, ladies. Let's do some poetry!

78
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,160
I got to go to my in-laws'
for dinner tonight.

79
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,160
You want to come?

80
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,000
Officer Hightower,
I'm here to join the new C.O.P. Program.

81
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,520
Do I know you?

82
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,840
Yeah, you used to
bounce me on your knee.

83
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,160
-I did?
-Yeah. Little Tommy Conklin.

84
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,760
-But now they call me House.
-Tommy Conklin.

85
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,920
Sure. Welcome aboard.
You can register right over there.

86
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,760
"Blind mouth that scare themselves

87
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,360
"know how to hold a sheep-hook

88
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,040
"Or have learned aught else at least

89
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,600
"that to the faithful Herdsmans
art belongs! "

90
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,760
That was exciting.

91
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,160
We have an Officer Zed,
who's here to tell us...

92
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,640
a little bit about a new police program.
So won't you....

93
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,400
Thank you very much.

94
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,600
I'm sorry.
I'm an emotional, sensitive guy...

95
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,960
and that part about the sheep-hook
just tore my heart right out.

96
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,760
I have my own poem
that I prepared for you today.

97
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,400
"Gene, Gene made a machine...

98
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,240
"and Joe, Joe made it go.

99
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,920
"l blew a fart
and blew the whole damn thing apart."

100
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,520
What is he saying?

101
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,360
I didn't write it.

102
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,320
Okay, I'd like to talk to you
about what we're here for...

103
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,440
and that's for me to pitch
the new C.O.P. program to you.

104
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,800
Perhaps a few of you ladies
might be interested in it.

105
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,120
So the bartender asked the organ grinder,
"Hey, does your monkey sing any opera?"

106
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,000
And I said, "Nope.

107
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,200
"But if you hit me on the head,
I'll sing Yankee Doodle. "

108
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,920
It's so nice to have my family
all back together again.

109
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,920
-Can you pass the lettuce, Pop?
-Sure, honey. Here you go.

110
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,200
-Thanks, Pop.
-You're welcome. Hey, listen...

111
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,120
did I tell you I'm gonna join
that Citizen On Patrol thing?

112
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,640
That would be a great idea.
I'd be proud to have you at the precinct.

113
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,840
I'll take some more greens, Bud.

114
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,120
-Dad.
-Yeah?

115
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,120
I don't think you should sign up.
There are already three of us on the force.

116
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,400
-It's going to look like favoritism.
-That's not it.

117
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,320
That's not it at all. You just don't think
I'm fast enough anymore, do you?

118
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,920
I don't think that's it, do you, Tack?

119
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,800
It has nothing to do with being fast.
Now, that was fast.

120
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,160
You know, that was fast.

121
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,200
But that's hard.

122
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,440
Excuse me.

123
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,640
I think Bud hurt Pop's feelings.

124
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,240
Oh, you two.

125
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,320
Oh, well, who wants pie?

126
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,720
-I was just trying to help.
-You hurt my arm.

127
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,200
-I'll hand the rest out. Hi.
-Hi.

128
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Could I interest you
in the new citizens program?

129
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
-No, I don't think so.
-No, thanks.

130
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,600
-We'll take the stairs.
-Thanks, just the same.

131
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,400
Excuse me!

132
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,040
Would you be interested
in the new citizens program?

133
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,600
-Yes, in fact, we didn't hear you right.
-Sure, here.

134
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,720
-Why don't you hand the rest of them out?
-Thank you very much. Goodbye, sir.

135
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,760
-Arnie, where are you going?
-Home. I got a boatload of stuff to do.

136
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,760
I got a term paper due tomorrow,
and a history test.

137
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,920
I got to help my father clean the cellar,
and I have to do the dishes tonight.

138
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,120
What are you doing?

139
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,240
-I'll get the guys and hang out at the mall.
-Let's go.

140
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,520
I thought I told you guys,
no skateboarding in my district.

141
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,440
This isn't skateboarding, Sergeant.
This is carrying skateboards.

142
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,840
This is skateboarding.

143
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,600
-We got to check this out, you guys.
-Take it easy.

144
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
We'll see you later.

145
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,400
I'll see you later.
I want to check out these guys.

146
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,160
All right, I'll be back.

147
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,560
Hey, Sarge, look at that.

148
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,000
Kyle, that skateboard punk. Let's nail him.

149
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
Boy, you sure give them a hard time.

150
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,800
Yeah. Fun, isn't it?

151
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,200
You don't listen, do you, Kyle?

152
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,800
I was shopping
for Capt. Harris' birthday present.

153
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,400
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

154
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,200
Shop somewhere else.

155
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,040
Your Honor....

156
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,240
Here, Judge. Stop him! Hold up!

157
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,200
Excuse me, pardon me.
Excuse me, my fault.

158
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,960
-Watch it!
-Stop! Stop that skateboarder! Hold it!

159
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,200
I can do that, that handstand stuff.

160
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,040
I just hate it
when the change falls out of my pocket.

161
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,400
Hey, man,
I think these guys want to talk to you.

162
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,360
Hold it!

163
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,720
Capt. Harris will hear about this!

164
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,000
Come.

165
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,920
-Sir.
-Copeland, what the hell happened to you?

166
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,400
Some skateboard punks
started a riot at the mall.

167
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,040
Bring them in here.

168
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,400
-They got away.
-They got away?

169
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,520
-I did the best I could, sir.
-It wasn't enough, was it, Copeland?

170
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,040
-No, sir.
-I'll handle these punks personally.

171
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,000
-Yes, sir.
-I want three patrol cars...

172
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,160
dissecting the neighborhood.
Copeland, my hat!

173
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,360
-Yes, sir.
-You, radio-alert all motorcycle units.

174
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,120
I want a chopper in the air.
Spot these boys on the ground.

175
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,760
Proctor, ride with me.

176
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,000
-Now, Proctor, move it!
-Coming, sir.

177
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,520
Be right there!

178
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,120
There they go!

179
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,440
Back it up. Quiet!

180
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,840
I said quiet, dickhead.

181
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,000
We've got them now.

182
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,440
I know they came in here.

183
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Unit 6 to Capt. Harris.
We've got them at the end of the alley.

184
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,000
I got you now!

185
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,840
You hold them right there. We're coming.

186
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,920
Copeland, have you got them?

187
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,920
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Carey Mahoney of the Police Academy.

188
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Please. Thank you. You're too kind.

189
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,560
It's Harris. Haul ass. Go.

190
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,440
I got you, you little punks.

191
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,320
Freeze, you little hoodlums.
Get your hands off my ass, Proctor.

192
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,120
Get away, Proctor.

193
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,240
No. Don't shake the fence.

194
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,320
Oh, shit. No!

195
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,760
The purpose of this program...

196
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,640
is to develop a better working relationship
between us, the police...

197
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,520
When he says, "Okay, boys and girls,"
we're all gonna....

198
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,040
...and you, the community.

199
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,200
Stop! Stop right there!

200
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,360
You see, the great thing is, this is a first.

201
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,920
The Police Academy has offered to train
you citizens to better protect yourselves.

202
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,040
-You'll be trendsetters.
-Do we get to pack heat?

203
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,200
Heat--

204
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,720
Stop those little punks! Stop them!

205
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,520
You're under arrest!

206
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,160
Are you all right?

207
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,440
Who's laughing now, you little twits?

208
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,600
And your clothes make me want to puke.
I'll tell you that right now.

209
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,600
-Capt. Harris!
-Well, well, Mahoney.

210
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,560
-It's been a long time, sir.
-So it has.

211
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,520
Well, Motormouth Jones.

212
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,040
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a great tailor, sir?

213
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,240
I mentioned that just last week.

214
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,920
Has anyone told you, Mahoney,
that you're still a little pissant?

215
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,240
-No one whose opinion matters, sir.
-What did Arnie and Kyle do?

216
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,160
You know those clowns?
I should have figured.

217
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,840
Your little pals wrecked a police car,
destroyed a shopping mall...

218
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,320
harassed citizens, resisted arrest.

219
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,800
Go easy, Captain. They're just wacky kids.

220
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,800
We'll see how those wacky kids
like it in jail.

221
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,400
In all my years on the bench,
I have seen all sorts of public disorder.

222
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,840
Young people must learn to conform...

223
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,800
to the standards and laws
of civilized society.

224
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,440
In reviewing the testimony
and taking into account...

225
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,760
your disregard
for public and private property...

226
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,800
I can reach only one decision:

227
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,200
Guilty as hell.

228
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,360
You flushed me down the toilet!

229
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,560
Before you pass sentence--

230
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,760
They're gonna send me to jail,
and some fat, hairy guy is gonna--

231
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,760
-May I approach the bench, Your Honor?
-Yes, Sergeant.

232
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,560
Sir, do we want to expose these boys,
these children to a prison environment?

233
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,000
-Yes.
-May I run my own court, Captain?

234
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,440
-You've got a better idea?
-Yes, I do, sir.

235
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,640
Comdt. Lassard has initiated
a new community relations program.

236
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,960
Why not assign these kids...

237
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,200
to that program
as a form of alternate sentencing?

238
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,040
-That's ridiculous!
-I'll be the judge of that.

239
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,760
I.... Excuse me.

240
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,360
I like the sound of this
community relations gig.

241
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,040
Milt Butterworth,
defender of the common man.

242
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,520
Your Honor, look at this list of complaints.

243
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,360
And I quote you directly, sir, when I say--

244
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Gee, sir, I thought you only got
contempt of court for opening your mouth.

245
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,760
Mahoney, I'm warning you.

246
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,960
You keep Lassard's C.O.Ps
out of my precinct.

247
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,840
You don't understand
what I'm trying to do.

248
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,160
I understand
exactly what you're trying to do.

249
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,640
Just keep them out,
especially these two little buttwads.

250
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,240
Excuse me, sir,
but you're not planning to attack us...

251
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,000
with any more of your bodily functions,
are you?

252
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,440
You just make sure
that we never meet again. Ever.

253
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,400
You know, with those two idiots
in Lassard's program, it'll never work.

254
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,200
Excuse me, sir.

255
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,400
We're looking for a Mrs. Feldman.

256
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,320
-Do you know her?
-Yes.

257
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,920
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you know a Mrs. Lois--

258
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,800
-Where can we find Lois Feldman, please?
-There.

259
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,840
Thank you.

260
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,520
Mrs. Feldman?

261
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,320
-Who's asking?
-Police.

262
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,320
Is it about those damn library books?

263
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,760
We're following up on your alleged
interest in the Citizens On Patrol program.

264
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,360
Then I'm Mrs. Feldman. Come on in.

265
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,440
Callahan, cover your rear.

266
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,640
I admire your taste.

267
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,600
Yes, well, I do all my own decorating.

268
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,640
You have a talent for it, ma'am.

269
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,840
I'll be with you in a moment, Sarge.

270
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,360
Perhaps you'd like to discuss
the program first, ma'am.

271
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,920
What's to discuss?

272
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,440
Think I want to hang out here
and listen to arteries hardening?

273
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,800
Where did I put that bulletproof vest?

274
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,640
All right, fall in! Come on, please, line up.

275
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,000
Come on, I need a lineup here.

276
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,200
Hello, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen--

277
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,760
-Thank you, Miss....
-Mrs. Feldman.

278
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,920
I want to welcome all of you
to the Academy.

279
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,600
You are part of a new
and exciting program that I call...

280
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,160
-C.O.P.
-C.O.P.

281
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,240
-Citizens On Patrol.
-Citizens On Patrol.

282
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,320
-Citizens On Patrol!
-Citizens On Patrol!

283
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,120
You will work and train with the police.

284
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,720
The police will work and train with you.

285
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,440
Working and training,
training and working.

286
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,200
Excuse me, Commandant.

287
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,640
But do you expect the community
to do the job of the police force?

288
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,760
There are many, many jobs
for many, many people.

289
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,360
Sir, I'll take care of this.

290
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,400
Excuse me, young lady,
what the Commandant means...

291
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,240
is that this program
will promote understanding...

292
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,920
between the community and the police...

293
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,360
and make the community
more active in crime prevention.

294
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,320
Active in crime prevention?
Won't that be dangerous?

295
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,520
No. We just want to teach citizens...

296
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,800
to prevent crimes from taking place.

297
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,040
It sounds fine in theory.
Let's hope it works in practice.

298
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,800
I like him. He's a really nice fish.

299
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,240
He looks a little like you.

300
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,440
I will attend
an international police seminar in London.

301
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,920
It would be
the crowning achievement of my career...

302
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,200
if I could close this seminar...

303
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,400
by bringing instructors
from all around the world...

304
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,760
here to watch
the C.O.P. program in action.

305
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,960
I'm counting on all of you
to make that possible.

306
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,200
In Comdt. Lassard's absence...

307
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,840
I've appointed a very able-bodied
and experienced officer...

308
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,360
to run the Academy.

309
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,800
Perfect timing. Here he is now.

310
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,360
Attention!

311
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,640
Two weeks of Harris? Damn!

312
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,400
Damn.

313
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,120
Deodorant? Thanks.

314
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,440
Straighten this mess up.

315
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,000
-What mess?
-Now!

316
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,640
I want all of you dirtbags
and that group of C.O.P. people...

317
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,440
out in front of this dormitory
at 1400 hours.

318
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,640
Move it!

319
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,800
Sir, we were just commenting
on how you'd mellowed.

320
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,120
-Captain?
-What is it, Mahoney?

321
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,560
I hope you're gonna
give this program a fair chance.

322
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,840
This program, Mahoney,
is just like you: a bad idea.

323
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,520
That's your opinion, sir.

324
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,640
But this is Comdt. Lassard's idea,
and his Academy.

325
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,800
Things can change, Mahoney.

326
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,160
Yes, things can change.

327
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,360
I'll see you out front.

328
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,960
I bet that was refreshing, sir.

329
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,200
Over the next two weeks...

330
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,640
you'll go through
a modified training program.

331
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,160
You'll learn many, many keys
to crime prevention.

332
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,720
Keys you can teach many, many others
in your community.

333
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,720
Modified? Modified nothing.
I want the works.

334
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,520
-Yeah.
-Madam...

335
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,640
I think it's time for a dose of reality.

336
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,400
You can forget Lassard's hype.

337
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,440
You people do not belong here.

338
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,440
Especially you and you.

339
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,240
Community action groups mean one thing,
and one thing only.

340
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,040
I hope that wasn't gum.

341
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,360
You heard the Captain. Is it?

342
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,040
It's definitely gum, sir. Bubble gum.
Cherry, I think.

343
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,200
-Thank you, Proctor.
-You're welcome, sir.

344
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,760
These groups only mean
citizens getting in the way of the police.

345
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,120
Now, I don't get involved
in your business...

346
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,000
and I don't want you involved in my--

347
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,120
Now, if you were smart...

348
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,800
you would go home
and forget this stupid idea....

349
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,440
Are those wedding bells I hear, sir?

350
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,720
-Whose damn mutt is this?
-It's my damn mutt.

351
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,640
I want him out of here!

352
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,840
-But, sir--
-Out!

353
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,840
I am not getting rid of Clarence.
He's my pet.

354
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,600
Why should you?
After all, Harris has Proctor.

355
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,600
I'll take him.

356
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,200
I have a big house, nice yard.

357
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,640
See, he likes me. We'll get along fine.

358
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,840
Me, too? I'm housebroken.

359
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,560
Come on, C.O.Ps,
let's step up to the white line!

360
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,960
Let's line ourselves up with a slot,
then let's listen to Mr. Jones.

361
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,920
Thank you, Sgt. Tackleberry.

362
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,720
This is a standard police issue.38.

363
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,040
Examine this weapon carefully.

364
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,240
You must be sure
this weapon is not loaded.

365
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,520
You will be responsible for the loading
and unloading of this weapon yourself.

366
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,640
Now, Sgt. Tackleberry.

367
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,840
You want to become one with the gun.

368
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,520
Feel the gun, caress the gun...

369
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,600
until it's a living, breathing, vibrating...

370
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,920
extension of yourself.

371
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,640
I look for the same in a woman.

372
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,600
This sucker's not loaded.

373
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,760
You won't be using live ammo.

374
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,600
Tack, how about letting me squeeze off
a few rounds of that baby?

375
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,120
Tack?

376
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,720
Affirmative, Mrs. F.

377
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,800
Now, be careful
because a.44 magnum has quite a...

378
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,320
kick.

379
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,240
Damn, that was fun!

380
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,600
Rescuing the drowning victim.

381
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,600
Now, when approaching
a potentially dangerous...

382
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,920
and out-of-control victim,
use this stroke only.

383
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,720
Arms out of the way for protection.

384
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,520
Now, when you get the victim in control,
you slip your arm across his chest...

385
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,040
under his opposite arm.

386
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,520
Rest his head and his neck
against your shoulder.

387
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,040
Kick with your feet.
Now, your victim could be struggling.

388
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,400
Struggle, House. Good, House....

389
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,720
House!

390
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,560
Really swift! I'll get him!

391
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,760
Arnie, get out of the pool! You just ate!

392
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,640
Get him out of here!

393
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,720
Thanks, pal.

394
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,640
Now we have an opportunity
to start our water safety lesson.

395
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,440
I will play the drowning victim.

396
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,800
Now, who's going to save me?

397
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,560
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

398
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,600
That was mighty brave. I admire that.

399
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,640
That was nothing.

400
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,920
You don't have a hair dryer,
or perhaps some mousse?

401
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,200
No. Your hair looks nice. It's very stylish.

402
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,520
Moi?
Stylish?

403
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,440
I think I'd better be going.

404
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,000
Mickey!

405
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,960
He's dead! He killed him!

406
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,120
-I'm sure the Academy will pay for it.
-What about the sentimental value?

407
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,120
This is a family heirloom here.

408
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,600
This is the last thing I ever stole
before joining the Academy.

409
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,400
What the hell is this? Cadets in heat?

410
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,200
No. We were just, like, talking.

411
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,920
Just, like, talk somewhere else.

412
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,120
This is not a spawning pool.
I want discipline.

413
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,560
Do I make myself clear, Zed?

414
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,440
Discipline!

415
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,520
-Jerk.
-What?

416
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,160
He said bye.

417
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,440
No. I said jerk. I think it was pretty clear.

418
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,240
-I said, "Jerk."
-Jerk.

419
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,120
Cadets, I'd now like to discuss with you...

420
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,440
something that will be
vital for you to know...

421
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,000
when you're, like, out there on the job
as a police officer.

422
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,960
And that's the correct way
to eat a doughnut.

423
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,840
-A doughnut--
-Attention!

424
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,040
Capt. Harris.

425
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,360
From this moment on, anyone
who misplaces their canister of Mace...

426
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,440
will be reprimanded and fined.

427
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,760
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir!

428
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Bye.

429
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,440
As Citizens On Patrol...

430
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,920
endurance and longevity
should be very important to you.

431
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,000
Aerobic activity will keep you in shape...

432
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,600
and keep that heart rate up.

433
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,800
Music, however,
makes it a little less painful.

434
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,240
Hooks, cassette.

435
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,640
I have confidence that Sgt. Hooks
has chosen the appropriate music.

436
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,160
No cassette.

437
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,640
Let's go.

438
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,240
Nice selection, Hooks. All right.

439
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,400
Slow walk. Slow start.

440
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,560
Keep your arms moving. That's good.

441
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,040
Into a nice slow jog. Okay!

442
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,840
Arms moving. Keep breathing.
Don't forget to breathe.

443
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,560
Tuck his tummy, Hooks. Attagirl. Let's go.

444
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,120
Now, this whistle can be very valuable...

445
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,600
when walking through
a bad neighborhood.

446
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,520
If your purse gets snatched,
blow this whistle...

447
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,040
to alert your neighbors and the police
so they can help.

448
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,760
Now, Mrs. Feldman,
would you play the victim?

449
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,800
-Yes.
-Okay, and I'll be Mr. Purse Snatcher.

450
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,640
-Okay.
-Go.

451
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,160
Any questions?

452
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,200
Now, practice.

453
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,600
You had him for, like, a minute.
He was scared. He was, like, flinching.

454
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,200
His face went....

455
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,840
Sorry.

456
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,720
Citizens On Patrol. What a joke.

457
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,400
-You know what C.O.P. really stands for?
-No, sir. What?

458
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,720
-Collection Of Pissants. That's not funny.
-No, sir.

459
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,120
This citizen-action crap is a disaster,
a bad idea, and I'm going to prove it.

460
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,320
Yes, sir.

461
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,800
Excuse me, everyone.

462
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,240
I mean, not everyone.

463
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,600
Attention! Excuse me. Move it!

464
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,240
-Everybody, come over here!
-Hooks.

465
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,760
Stop embarrassing the Police Department
and join your civilian buddies.

466
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,920
May I have your attention, please?
Hooks, the tank!

467
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,920
-I'm so sorry.
-You dimwit!

468
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,200
Today, Hooks, today.

469
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,600
Now, take your little munchkin voice
and go away.

470
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,360
Listen up!

471
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,160
This is the proper procedure
for administering oxygen.

472
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,000
You place the mask securely
about the face of the patient...

473
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,440
and then have them breathe deeply.

474
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,240
Now, that is the way it's done
in Capt. Harris' precinct.

475
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,360
What the hell? Hooks!

476
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,720
So you gentlemen think
you're on a vacation?

477
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,360
You're no better than anyone else,
so let's go, let's get to work.

478
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,320
Come on, dudes, chill out.

479
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,160
You dudes are setting a bad example.

480
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,400
Can't hear you, bro. Can't you see
I'm getting my beauty sleep?

481
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,800
I'm sorry.

482
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,600
Move it!

483
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,200
You sure told them.

484
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,840
Did you ever think about
maybe getting some contact lenses...

485
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,040
or something, like, you know?

486
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,520
You'd look good in them.

487
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,800
Proctor, this is an alley.

488
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,520
I know, sir, but these are the directions
Mahoney gave me.

489
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
-Mahoney?
-Yes, sir.

490
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,040
He says this restaurant
has the best salad bar in town.

491
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,000
It damn sure better have.

492
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,400
-Proctor.
-Yes, sir?

493
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,600
I don't see a salad bar.

494
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,200
Look, maybe they serve seafood.

495
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,600
That's not funny, you idiot.

496
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,800
What are you looking at, you peckerhead?

497
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,240
Nice uniform.
Makes me wish I'd worn my sailor outfit.

498
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,440
I'm getting out of here. Move it!

499
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,240
I don't think cutting in is allowed, sir.

500
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,840
Nice collar.

501
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,320
Here we go again. Next round.
Mahoney weaving his way through...

502
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,400
looking pretty good.
Gets past the main defense.

503
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,160
And, under the leg!

504
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,760
Nice shot!

505
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,360
That man is a hot dog.
The crowd's gone wild!

506
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,520
The ball's brought in.
Here we go. We have the play going.

507
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,240
Throws to Zed.

508
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,920
A little bit of a steal there.

509
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,000
Mahoney throws a pass to Hightower.

510
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,640
And then Hightower he....
The Doctor of Dunk scores!

511
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,040
You killed it. Really swift!

512
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,520
Some community action.

513
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's Lt. Proctor, a ghetto favorite!

514
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,320
Thank you very much.

515
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,440
I'm honored to be--

516
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,320
You know,
Capt. Harris isn't gonna like this...

517
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,520
goofing off.

518
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,160
-Come on. This is community relations.
-No, Mahoney.

519
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,560
I'm an expert in goofing off,
and this is goofing off.

520
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,800
And I'm gonna have to tell him.

521
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,600
-I have an urge to break him in half.
-Why fight it?

522
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,240
No, Hightower. Take it easy, big guy.
The creep's not worth it.

523
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,000
-You through in there?
-Sure, go ahead.

524
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,200
Thanks.

525
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,440
Excuse me, Silvio?

526
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,600
I wonder if you can help me.
I need some help over here.

527
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,640
-Right there.
-No problem.

528
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,320
Hold your horses, I'll be out in a minute!

529
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,000
Okay, like, bring it in.

530
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,920
Just, like, bring it in a hair.

531
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,920
Watch out for the plane!

532
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,400
Oh, the humanity!

533
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,240
Okay, that's perfect. No, that's fine.

534
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,720
-Metro police.
-Special assignment.

535
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,600
Ladies and gentlemen...

536
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,320
please rise for our national anthem.

537
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,240
-Read that part about me again, Arnie.
-What part?

538
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,000
You know, the part about
the dynamic leader of the C.O.P.

539
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,600
Get real! That's me they're talking about.

540
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,320
Good evening, gentlemen.
I congratulate you on another good day.

541
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,760
Sleep well.

542
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,200
Count, getting worried
we're gonna be taking over soon?

543
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,640
We're ready.

544
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,240
You're improving, guys. But you're still
way down in the food chain.

545
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,240
As we vampires say, "Lights out, suckers."

546
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,720
This C.O.P. bit is a breeze.

547
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,800
-We are ready.
-I concur.

548
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,520
I think we're ready to bust
some truly major criminals.

549
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,000
Maybe we should go out and find some....

550
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,200
-Maybe we should become vigilantes.
-Yeah, that's it. Vigilantes.

551
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,040
Wake up, men! We need you. Now!

552
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,920
Come on.

553
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,200
-What's going on? Where are we going?
-Why are we here? What's happening?

554
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,200
You're here because you're ready.
You said you were ready.

555
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,520
-One thing l--
-You're ready, now.

556
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,440
Could you be a little more specific
concerning our current mission?

557
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,160
-We're apprehending two known felons.
-I'll be going home now.

558
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,840
-Where are the rest?
-What rest? We're it.

559
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,800
-We'll flush them out of the building.
-You stay behind, cut them off in the alley.

560
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,920
Stay.

561
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,760
What about guns and shit, man?

562
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,240
Guns? No, you won't be needing them.

563
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,720
We're pretty sure they're not armed.

564
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,000
They can handle this without us.
We'll just get in the way, you know.

565
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,520
Good thinking.

566
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,040
We got them, men!

567
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,200
It's all right, men. Come on over.

568
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,160
All right, you three
will be riding in the back with Badula...

569
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,520
and his late brother.

570
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,440
You guys keep him subdued.

571
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,040
Let's go.

572
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,360
Don't let his voodoo
mumbo jumbo scare you.

573
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,120
Fools. To think
they can kill the brother of Badula.

574
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,960
I never thought that.

575
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,520
That I could reach into the belly of a yak
and rip out his heart.

576
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,400
That would bring him back to life?

577
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,840
No, man. I'm hungry.

578
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,440
Listen, we're going for some burgers
and fries. We'll be right back.

579
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,240
Out of my way!

580
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,400
I guess they weren't as ready
as they thought they were.

581
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,840
You can take the mask off now, Tack.

582
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,200
-Proctor.
-Yes, sir?

583
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,920
-Who are all these people?
-They're here for the party, sir.

584
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,760
What party?

585
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,040
A few of the Citizens On Patrol members
invited a few of their friends...

586
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,760
and they invited a few of their friends.
You know how it goes, sir.

587
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,400
-A party?
-Yes, sir.

588
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,240
A party? Why wasn't I told?

589
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,960
Hey, Callahan. Hey, Hooks.

590
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,840
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

591
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,840
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I please have your attention?

592
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,200
I'd like to thank you all for coming!

593
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,960
Let's party!

594
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,400
-Move those patooties.
-Excuse me.

595
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,120
All police officers out of the pool!

596
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,120
Let's go! Out, everybody out!

597
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,120
Sir, why don't you just
let everyone enjoy themselves?

598
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,560
Why don't you just
kiss my rosy red ass, Mahoney?

599
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,840
Rosy?

600
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,160
Get out of that pool now!

601
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,840
Just look at yourself.

602
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:54,160
You are a disgrace to the uniform!
Go get changed. Move it.

603
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,640
-What are we looking for?
-This.

604
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,640
-Why, Capt. Harris.
-Miss Mattson.

605
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,160
-Hello.
-How are you?

606
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,000
Have you seen Clarence?

607
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,240
Don't you let that fleabag near me.

608
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,800
Clarence is crazy about you, Captain.
Let me just call him over.

609
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,320
-No.
-For a second?

610
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,040
-No.
-Okay. Bye.

611
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,440
Wipe those grins off your faces,
buttbreaths! Dismissed!

612
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,800
Dr. Berman, please pick up line two.
Dr. Berman, line two, please.

613
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,840
-You shouldn't be in here.
-How is Capt. Harris?

614
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,240
-We'll do all we can.
-Please, be gentle.

615
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,440
I heard what Harris said, and he's wrong.

616
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:21,000
It happens to me all the time.
People just don't understand me.

617
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,800
Maybe if you talked a little slower,
a little softer....

618
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,800
That's not what I meant. I meant
people don't know who I really am.

619
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,320
Now I got to worry about my diction, too?

620
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,640
-How's my sentence structure?
-Perfect.

621
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,120
In fact, I think you're just about perfect.

622
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,760
I think I'm going to puke.

623
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,720
Hi, sir. How are you feeling?

624
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,160
I have to wait
for the damn glue to wear off.

625
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,600
I didn't catch that.

626
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,320
Was that, "the dim shoot to snare off"?

627
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,400
I said I have to wait
for the damn glue to wear off.

628
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,840
So I asked her,
"Do you always work under podiums?"

629
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,440
Commandant?

630
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,720
Why, Chief Hurst,
this is a splendid, splendid surprise!

631
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,400
You remember Nogata?
He's part of our Japanese contingent.

632
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,200
This is Chief Hurst.

633
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,840
We have heard many, many
wonderful things about you and your city.

634
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,800
I've been helping them with their English.

635
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,240
-Please, sit. Please.
-Thank you.

636
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,320
I hope you'll find the time
to see our beautiful city firsthand.

637
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,160
In fact, I've just flown here personally...

638
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,360
to extend the Mayor's invitation...

639
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,120
to see my....

640
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:18,320
To see Comdt. Lassard's
community program in action.

641
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,640
We are convinced
that this program will serve...

642
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,920
as a model for cities around the world.

643
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,920
We would be honored
to accept your invitation.

644
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,360
-Wonderful.
-Please, come.

645
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,320
-Auf Wiedersehen.
-Arrivederci.

646
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,640
Bonsoir.

647
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,360
I see you've been teaching them
something other than English.

648
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,920
I do what I can.

649
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,320
-So my program is really, really working?
-Hell, yes.

650
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,640
Starting tomorrow,
C.O.Ps will be working the streets.

651
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,640
C.O.P. emergency. Feldman here.

652
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,640
Meet me at the corner of
Clark and Main Street at the warehouse.

653
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,160
10-4, Mrs. F.

654
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,040
-$40, we're agreed?
-Okay, $40.

655
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,600
Snap off a few shots for evidence.

656
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,920
Get closer.

657
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,160
I saw this on Hill Street Blues.
It's a fencing operation.

658
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,560
You're gonna love these.
We just unloaded a van full of them.

659
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,120
Okay, bring in the rest of it.

660
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,560
Next case.

661
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,520
Nice camera.
Don't let that crook give you less than $80.

662
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,800
Freeze, you scuzzbuckets!

663
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,960
This is a citizen's arrest. Get them, boys!

664
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,120
You're not moving till the cops get here.

665
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,440
I am the cops, lady.

666
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,800
Three months' work
out the window, down the drain.

667
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,160
Your Citizens On Patrol just screwed up...

668
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,160
the single biggest
undercover police sting operation...

669
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,240
in the history of this city!

670
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,440
Tell them the good news, sir.

671
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,240
-Thank you, Proctor.
-You're welcome, sir.

672
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,600
As of now,
the C.O.P. program is suspended...

673
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,440
pending a full investigation.

674
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,920
Attention!

675
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,320
Mahoney, I'm so, so proud
of the job you've done.

676
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,000
Nice work, men.

677
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,000
The eyes of the world are on this program.

678
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,240
Excuse me, sir. I think we should talk.

679
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,440
This precinct must deal with
every type of criminal...

680
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,000
from pickpockets to armed robbers,
felons of all kinds--

681
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,960
Capt. Harris. Excuse me.
Don't forget the gang of ninjas.

682
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,440
They're my personal favorites.

683
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,200
Why don't you go pay them a visit?

684
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,600
This precinct is run on discipline
and organization.

685
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,840
Simon says, "Pull your left ear."

686
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:15,120
Simon says, "Hop on your left foot."
Come on, guys.

687
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,600
Simon says, "Hop on your right foot."

688
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,960
It's a little too noisy in here, gentlemen.

689
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,920
We have important
police officials visiting...

690
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,520
and I think you'd better show
the proper respect.

691
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,560
Come on, Lieutenant.
We're almost finished.

692
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,600
Come on, Lieutenant,
join us in a friendly game of Simon Says.

693
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:38,120
There's nothing to it.
Now, Simon says, "Touch your toes."

694
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,400
Come on, Lieutenant.
Simon says, "Clap your hands."

695
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,960
Come on, get in the spirit.

696
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,320
Simon says, "Two steps right."

697
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,240
Simon says, "Five steps back."

698
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,440
Put your hands up!

699
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,960
Simon didn't say.

700
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,000
No, but Smith & Wesson does.

701
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,520
The high-security cell area
is used to hold criminals...

702
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:13,400
awaiting trial or transfer
to state or county facility.

703
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,000
Any convictions involving felons...

704
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:21,040
perverts, thieves, people of that nature,
are held in this area.

705
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,840
-You will notice the steel construction.
-What the hell is he doing in there?

706
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,520
I think that explains it, sir.

707
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,520
Come on, hurry up!

708
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,000
It's getting to the point now
when I'm with you

709
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,840
I no longer want
to have something stuck in my eye

710
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,840
Your mother, my mother
ain't never looked like Florence Henderson

711
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,720
I wrote that for you.

712
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,840
I hope now that C.O.P. is over...

713
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,600
it won't mean that we won't
be seeing each other anymore.

714
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,200
Shut up! Not you. I meant the ducks.

715
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,360
Attention. This is Mrs. F.

716
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,520
-There's been a jailbreak.
-Zed, 10-4!

717
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,040
Tack, you pick me up at Main and Maple.

718
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,400
Move it! Over and out.

719
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,760
Commandant!

720
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,120
-There's been a jailbreak, sir.
-Get in.

721
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:02,440
-It is so wonderful to see you again, baby.
-It's wonderful to be seen.

722
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:07,240
-Just like old times.
-ln America, talk is cheap.

723
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,520
There's been a jailbreak!

724
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:22,320
Look, there's a stolen police car.
That's got to be it.

725
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,200
I think we got a robbery in progress.

726
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,640
Stay here, Mrs. Feldman.

727
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,160
-Freeze!
-Good idea.

728
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,440
All right, I want everybody
to get back in that vault.

729
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,720
Book them, Tack.

730
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,360
-There's a ninja now.
-I see him.

731
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,720
Come on, let's get him. Let's go.

732
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,160
Do you see him?

733
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,960
Shit.

734
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:54,040
All right. If it's a fight you want,
a fight you'll get.

735
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,960
Damn you. You're gonna pay for that.

736
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,040
Shut up!

737
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,960
Will you two morons, knock it off!

738
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,840
We've got an international incident
going on here!

739
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,440
-I knew you'd come.
-Ja, danke.

740
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,920
-You may thank Mrs. Feldman.
-Who is Mrs. Feldman?

741
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:31,200
You know Mrs. Feldman,
a member of the defunct C.O.P. team.

742
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,760
This is Sgt. Mahoney
in pursuit of a stolen police car.

743
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,840
I'm headed towards
the Williams County air show.

744
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,960
Repeat, I'm pursing four escapees
toward the Williams County air show.

745
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,600
Now, folks,
making his second appearance...

746
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,960
at the Williams County air show....

747
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,800
-Look out for that car!
-What car?

748
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,360
That car! Come on, get out!

749
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,360
Come on!

750
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,360
Let's get out of here!

751
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,560
Hurry up!

752
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,440
This is where I draw the line.
I'm not going up in one of those things.

753
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,440
-No way. No, sirree.
-You don't have to.

754
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,000
You can open your eyes now.

755
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,160
How can you like this
better than my driving?

756
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,440
Because you can't do this in a car.

757
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,360
Grab that balloon!

758
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,800
We commandeer this balloon
in the name of the law!

759
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,520
-No, wait, you can't!
-You can't do that. We need it for the race.

760
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:23,320
Mrs. Feldman, stay with the car.
Zed, Sweetchuck, follow me.

761
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,520
Guys, wait up! Tackleberry.

762
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,400
-What do I pull?
-Take it up!

763
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,840
-They're getting away! Let's go!
-We are going up, sir.

764
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,560
Come on! Drop the parachute!

765
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,800
Stop screwing around!

766
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,800
-Come on! Drop the parachute!
-Come on!

767
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,520
If he doesn't want to do it, don't push him.

768
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,840
He's gotta, like, wanna help himself.

769
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,920
You land that balloon right now!

770
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,560
This is Capt. Harris! You are under arrest!

771
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,200
Land that balloon now!

772
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,120
-I'll just blast them out of the sky, sir.
-No! Not yet.

773
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,920
You're right.
I should give them a warning shot first.

774
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,040
lmbecile! Are you happy now?

775
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,040
At least it looks like
we're coming down in the river.

776
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,600
It won't matter
because you're going to be dead!

777
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,840
Pretty view--

778
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,720
I hate water!

779
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,800
Help!

780
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,440
-They're in the river.
-Hurry. Maybe we can catch them.

781
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,360
I'll pull alongside Tackleberry.

782
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,640
Look, I see my house!

783
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,800
Look, the crooks!

784
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,920
Let's go get them, okay?

785
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,200
Hang on, sir!

786
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,440
-Hurry, before they go over the falls!
-There they go!

787
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,960
Get a rope!

788
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,840
Hang on. Hang on, sir!

789
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,520
Hang on, we'll come and get you!

790
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:57,800
Grab it!

791
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,600
Try to relax!

792
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,760
There's the balloon! Now I've got them.

793
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:50,040
There's only one way to do this
and it's up to me!

794
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:54,840
-Take over!
-He was talking to you!

795
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,240
If you're coming back, bring some beer!

796
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:09,920
-No. He was talking to you.
-No, I heard him.

797
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:14,320
-He said, "Sweetchuck, take over."
-No, he did not.

798
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,600
-Get off of my foot!
-Shut up! Why are you always whining?

799
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,400
Leave me alone!

800
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,200
Gentlemen, may I see your license
and registration, please?

801
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:00,800
There they are. Take it down.
I want to get close. Get closer.

802
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:08,040
Mahoney, what are you doing?

803
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,840
Get in closer!

804
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,640
What do you think you're doing?

805
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,240
I'll take care of you, copper!

806
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,960
Get off my wing! Get off of there!

807
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
What will you do about them?

808
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:47,160
Pal, it's over. Let's go home.

809
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,200
-I hate you.
-I'm not really thrilled about you!

810
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,600
-Why don't you lose some weight?
-Why don't you get out and walk?

811
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,520
-I'm going to be sick!
-I don't have a parachute!

812
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,560
-Shut up! I'm going to be sick!
-Don't be sick on me!

813
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,640
-I don't have a chute!
-Break your fall!

814
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,800
-Hit the kids!
-No, I need a chute!

815
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,960
Get your own! Get away from me!

816
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,640
Come on!

817
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,720
Let go!

818
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,600
I'll break you in half, you dweeb.

819
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:36,120
There, I opened the chute.
Are you satisfied? Leave me alone!

820
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,200
-I'm going to kill you!
-Shut up and enjoy the flight!

821
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,560
Get off me!

822
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,920
Commandant, they say
your Citizens On Patrol group...

823
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:10,000
does many, many
wonderful and crazy things.

824
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,960
I think Sgt. Mahoney
deserves a special bow.

825
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,000
-Mahoney?
-All right!

826
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,760
-Mahoney?
-Way to go!

827
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,840
Get up! Look, it's Mahoney!

828
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,760
-Where?
-Sorry.

829
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,640
-To the Academy.
-To the Academy.

830
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,360
You know, you look
a little like Tom Cruise in Top Gun.

831
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,160
-Yeah?
-No!
