00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:48,705
   WHEN YOU COULD BE MAKING

1237
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:50,306
       SUCH AN IMPORTANT
    CULTURAL CONTRIBUTION?

1238
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:51,808
    ALL RIGHT, I'M CONFUSED
       ABOUT SOMETHING.

1239
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,476
       WHEN I WANTED TO
       READ YOUR STUFF,

1240
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:54,644
   YOU PROTECTED IT FROM ME

1241
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,379
              LIKE IT WAS SOME
              FRAGILE BUTTERFLY.

1242
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:57,480
             WHEN YOU WANT ME
             TO READ YOUR STUFF,

1243
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:59,649
        I HAVE TO MISS MY BEST
        FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY PARTY?

1244
00:41:59,651 --> 00:42:01,718
     YOU WANTED AN ARTIST,
        I'M AN ARTIST.

1245
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,353
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

1246
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,955
       I WANTED SOMEONE
    BRIGHT AND INTERESTING,

1247
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,358
        NOT SOME MOODY,
         SELF-ABSORBED
     PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL.

1248
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,326
           "PSEUDO?"

1249
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,296
        [QUIETLY] YEAH.

1250
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:15,064
         I KNEW THINGS
   WOULDN'T WORK OUT BETWEEN
              US.

1251
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:17,267
LOOK HOW LONG IT TOOK YOU
TO RE-READ PROUST.

1252
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:20,069
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF
AN ENGLISH TEACHER ARE YOU?

1253
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,437
     ONE WHO LOVES TO READ

1254
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,039
      AND HAS NEVER BEEN
  SO BORED BY A SET OF BOOKS

1255
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,173
         IN HER LIFE.

1256
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,678
       ARE YOU GOING TO
     READ MY PLAY OR NOT?

1257
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,448
      HAVE YOU NOT HEARD
   ANYTHING I'VE JUST SAID?

1258
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,418
 ACTUALLY, I THINK I'VE HEARD
    MORE THAN I NEEDED TO.

1259
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,255
               GOODBYE, BAILEY.

1260
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:40,557
GOODBYE.

1261
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,158
DON'T LET THE DOOR
HIT YOU ON THE WAY OUT.

         [SLAMS DOOR]

1265
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,706
     RIGHT THEN AND THERE?

1266
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,741
                  WELL, IT WAS
                  PRETTY MUTUAL.

1267
00:42:58,743 --> 00:42:59,976
               BUT IT WAS OKAY.

1268
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:01,444
 I HAD AMBER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
           TO GO TO,

1269
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:02,979
    SO I HAD A GREAT TIME.

1270
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:04,547
          ATTA GIRL,
   YOU HAD SOMEWHERE TO GO,

1271
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,182
 AND YOU WERE ALL DRESSED UP.

1272
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:07,850
THE GUY WAS A WET BLANKET.

1273
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,552
WHO NEEDS HIM?

1274
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:11,154
       I DIDN'T EXACTLY
     PUT ON BLINDERS WITH
           JONATHAN.

1275
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:14,357
    BUT I DEFINITELY PUT ON
  SOME ROSE-COLORED GLASSES.

1276
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:18,828
   HONEY, SOMETIMES, WE JUST
              SEE
     WHAT WE WANT TO SEE.

1278
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:22,165
      IS THAT HOW YOU GOT
          SPOT HERE?

1279
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:25,935
   WELL, REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
      EVE WAS VERY MOODY?

1280
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,338
    TURNS OUT SHE WAS MORE
           ATTACHED
      TO ME THAN I KNEW.

1281
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,842
      SINCE WE BROKE UP,
   SHE'S BEEN INCONSOLABLE.

1282
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:33,977
   I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,

1283
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:35,778
     SO I BROUGHT HER HERE
          TO SEE YOU.

1286
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,289
      SO YOU'LL TAKE HER?

1287
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,324
    UH... TO FOSTER, OR...?

1288
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:51,527
     JUST UNTIL SHE'S BACK
       TO HER OLD SELF.

1289
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:53,296
         I DON'T KNOW.
    I MEAN, SHE'S YOUR DOG.

1290
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:57,000
  NOBODY REALLY OWNS ANYBODY
         OR ANYTHING.

   SO, THAT'S HOW EVE BECAME
             MINE.

1295
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:10,980
      AND ONCE I HAD HER,
    I WOULDN'T LET HER GO.

1296
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,515

EXPLAIN THE DRESS.

       GETS INTERESTING.

WILL BE PERFECT,

01:04:58,495 --> 01:04:59,294
          HOW MANY THINGS
          YOU CAN GET FROM THEM?

1914
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:00,161
           ALL KINDS OF STUFF--

1915
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:01,196
NOPE, ZERO.

1916
01:05:01,198 --> 01:05:03,231
LOOK IT UP.

1917
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,933
                         OKAY...

1918
01:05:04,935 --> 01:05:06,134
         YOU KNOW WHAT, BAILEY,

1919
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:07,402
        SOMETIMES, I THINK
        YOU CARE MORE ABOUT DOGS

1920
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,838
       THAN YOU DO ABOUT PEOPLE.

1921
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,507
YOU REALLY
DON'T LIKE DOGS, DO YOU?

1922
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,143
     THEY'RE NOT MY THING.

1923
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:16,745
  THEY'RE YOUR THING, BAILEY.

1924
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:18,713
                I TOLD YOU THAT,
                REMEMBER?

1925
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,783
        AND SHIRLEY...

1926
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:25,353
   YEAH, I GOT HER JUST FOR
             YOU.

1927
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:29,858
    YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN'T
  UNDERSTAND MY LOVE OF DOGS,

1928
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:33,328
   THEN YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND
              ME.

1929
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:36,164
      WHAT DOES ONE THING
   HAVE TO DO WITH ANOTHER?

1931
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:41,002
            I THINK
 IF I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT...

1932
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:47,242
I DON'T KNOW,
WE SHOULD BE...

1933
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:51,746
WE SHOULD RECONSIDER
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

1934
01:05:51,748 --> 01:05:53,581
          RECONSIDER?
       WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
          RECONSIDER?

  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
       RECONSIDER WHAT?

1936
01:05:57,054 --> 01:05:59,387
                       BAILEY...

1937
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:03,158
         I'M GONNA GO.

1938
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,962
             WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
             YOU'RE GOING TO GO?

1939

                   WHERE ARE YOU
                   GOING TO--

          GOOD GIRL.

    WATCH YOUR HEAD, ADAM.

1944
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:18,974
DON'T JUST LEAVE,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

1945
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:21,543
    I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
       THERE IS TO SAY.

1946
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:23,611
  LISTEN, YOU BASICALLY THINK

1947
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:25,313
      THAT MY PRIORITIES
     ARE ALL OUT OF WHACK,

1948
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,483
      BUT YOU'RE MISSING
       WHAT MAKES ME ME.

1949
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:29,918
       NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

1950
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,052
 I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS,
    AND IT'S FINE, REALLY.

1951
01:06:31,054 --> 01:06:32,620
            "FINE?"

1952
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:34,322
   "FINE" IS LIKE SOMETHING
  YOU SAY ABOUT THE WEATHER.

1953
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,758
  IT'S NOT HOW YOU TALK ABOUT
    SOMEONE THAT YOU LOVE.

1954
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,827
        BAILEY, JUST...

1955
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:41,997
     PLEASE, JUST TELL ME
        WHAT YOU WANT.

1956
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:47,736
        I WANT SHIRLEY.

1957
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:50,271
WHAT?

1958
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:51,506
               COME HERE, GIRL.

1959
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:52,674
YOU CAN'T JUST
 TAKE SHIRLEY.

1960
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:57,178
        YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT
        YOU GOT HER ONLY FOR ME.

1961
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,315
     BESIDES, NO DOG SHOULD LIVE
     WHERE THEY'RE NOT WELCOME.

1962
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:12,160
      ERIC. WHY DIDN'T HE
         JUST TELL ME

1963
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:14,062
   THAT HE DIDN'T WANT A DOG
      IN THE FIRST PLACE?

1964
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:15,830
    IT WOULD HAVE SAVED US
   SO MUCH TIME AND TROUBLE.

1965
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:16,865
I THINK HE DID,

1966
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,033
JUST NOT IN A WAY
YOU WERE HEARING.

1967

              MM.

1968
01:07:19,002 --> 01:07:20,568
          TO BE FAIR,

1969
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,337
        I HAVEN'T BEEN
  COMPLETELY HONEST WITH HIM.

1970
01:07:22,339 --> 01:07:26,741
    I SAID "YES" TO GETTING
            MARRIED
     WHEN I REALLY MEANT,
           "MAYBE."

1971
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:28,276
     WELL, NOW THAT WE'RE
 ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THIS,

1972
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:29,477
         WHY DID YOU?

1973
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:31,179
     BECAUSE MEN LIKE ERIC
     DON'T GROW ON TREES.

1974
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:33,114
    I THINK WE CAN AGREE ON
             THAT.

1975
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:34,049
     NO OFFENSE TO TRAVIS.

1976
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:35,817
          NONE TAKEN.

1977
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:37,018
         I WISH TRAVIS
  HAD HALF OF ERIC'S INTEREST

1978
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,820
         IN MARRIAGE.

1979
01:07:38,822 --> 01:07:40,088
     THERE IS SUCH A THING

1980
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:40,889
          AS TOO MUCH
  OF A GOOD THING, YOU KNOW.

1981

 YOU KNOW, ON OUR FIRST DATE,

1982
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,760
    WHEN ERIC BROUGHT THOSE
           PICTURES
  OF THE PERFECT GOLF SWING,

1983
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:47,695
       I THOUGHT, "LOOK,
 THIS GUY IS SUPER-PREPARED."

1984
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:50,298
   BUT... A BIT OF OVERKILL,

         JUST KEEP IT IN CHECK.

      OF A GOOD THING...
