{1}{1}25.000
{3167}{3203}We are recording tonight...
{3209}{3293}... and because we are recording,|we 're trying to do some things...
{3299}{3379}... actually, that, I'm too tired to do.
{3385}{3421}But we'll...
{3444}{3502}But as Faye Dunaway, I think it was...
{3508}{3579}She said when Bonnie and Clyde|came out and all...
{3584}{3653}...she said she tried to give people|what they wanted.
{3659}{3723}That's a mistake, really. I know.
{3766}{3820}You can 't do it, but only after...
{3826}{3931}You use up everything you got|trying to give everybody what they want.
{4090}{4143}But I will learn my lesson soon...
{4149}{4257}...and then you will buy more records,|right, because you 'll want to see me.
{4314}{4419}Let's see what we can do|with this lovely, lovely thing...
{4425}{4514}... that goes past all racial conflict...
{4520}{4600}...and all kinds of conflicts.
{4607}{4655}It is a reflective tune.
{4725}{4801}At some time in your life...
{4807}{4931}... you will have occasion to say,|"What is this thing called time?"
{4948}{4992}You know, "What is that?"
{5009}{5093}The clock. You go to work|by the clock...
{5099}{5189}... you get your martini|in the afternoon by the clock...
{5195}{5248}...and your coffee by the clock...
{5259}{5350}...and you have to get on a plane|and arrive at a certain time...
{5356}{5422}...and it goes on and on and on.
{5428}{5465}Why does she talk?
{5471}{5552}And time is a dictator, as we know it.
{5559}{5605}She's preparing to sing.
{5611}{5687}Where does it go? What does it do?
{5693}{5763}Most of all, is it alive?
{5774}{5797}Iatin america
{5803}{5845}Is it a thing that|we cannot touch and is alive?
{5851}{5874}the recent past
{5880}{5947}And then one day you look|in the mirror. "How old. "
{5953}{6032}And you say, "Where did the time go?"
{6063}{6129}We 'll leave you with that one.
{6160}{6215}General Latche,|leaving to cast his vote...
{6221}{6291}...asked people to judge|the past 12 years fairly.
{6297}{6358}He spoke with supporters|gathered on the lawn...
{6364}{6390}...and then departed.
{6396}{6490}Polls show that Latche 's lead has|eroded sharply in the last few months...
{6496}{6534}...particularly in the capital.
{7408}{7437}Papers.
{7555}{7596}Sergeant Rejas.
{7624}{7654}Hello?
{7660}{7696}What about her?
{7730}{7776}She drove all night.
{7949}{7973}What is that?
{7980}{8036}It's his dog. We ran it over.
{8042}{8087}We' re giving him a lift to Huanta.
{8250}{8293}What was your dog's name?
{8300}{8324}Tupac.
{8600}{8638}Where have you come from?
{8644}{8674}The capital.
{8681}{8730}That's 1700 miles.
{8736}{8779}What brings you here?
{8795}{8833}Her father.
{8839}{8886}He's being buried this afternoon.
{8892}{8923}Sorry.
{8962}{9012}Why do you have temporary papers?
{9019}{9048}Mine were stolen.
{9054}{9123}Even temporary papers need a photo.
{9138}{9197}T echnically, I should detain you.
{9250}{9333}Pisac, stay with the truck.|Would you mind getting out please?
{9997}{10032}How was the road?
{10064}{10145}Government assures us it will|be finished any day now.
{10186}{10260}I'm sure you have faith in all|government pronouncements.
{10275}{10317}Yes, of course.
{10338}{10388}I was hoping to take|that route tomorrow.
{10394}{10466}- Why?|- I've been promoted.
{10514}{10578}So your name is Melquiades Duran?
{10591}{10645}And you're a laborer?
{10676}{10778}- You were born in Galiteo de Maranon?|- That's right.
{10893}{10943}Has your colleague always been corrupt?
{11001}{11079}I don't know about always,|but certainly while I've known him.
{11093}{11128}Does that bother you?
{11146}{11248}I was a lawyer once, so regrettably|I have some familiarity with corruption.
{11257}{11292}Distinguishing marks?
{11298}{11349}What's wrong with your neck?
{11398}{11469}The country gives me a rash|from time to time.
{11476}{11513}The countryside.
{11531}{11568}That too.
{11778}{11826}I have to take you outside.
{12229}{12278}Will you take off your glasses?
{12504}{12527}That's it.
{12564}{12615}One second, I'll be right with you.
{12739}{12790}Sergeant Rejas. Hi, Sylvina.
{12796}{12886}Listen, I have everything here ready--
{12908}{12961}Hey, Pisac?
{12981}{13064}Pisac? What are you doing?
{13120}{13204}five years later
{13215}{13328}the capital
{13739}{13804}What the fuck is that?
{13890}{13925}Jesus.
{14055}{14100}Wow.
{14171}{14249}The point of the next century...
{14255}{14366}...will be for man to rediscover his gods.
{14383}{14455}Long live El Presidente Ezequiel. "
{14495}{14533}Who the fuck's Ezequiel?
{14540}{14614}- There's something in his throat.|- Yes, there is.
{14641}{14673}Dynamite.
{14918}{14966}Yes, Sergeant Gomez?
{14977}{15011}Sergeant Gomez?
{15022}{15066}It's Lieutenant Rejas.
{15072}{15158}Will you check in our library|any reference to a person...
{15164}{15252}...or perhaps an organization|called Ezequiel?
{15259}{15298}Like the prophet.
{15341}{15394}No, Gomez, in the Bible.
{15401}{15459}And also what a dead dog|might symbolize?
{15465}{15502}Yes, thank you.
{15532}{15577}Have you any ideas, sir?
{15623}{15662}In my village, when you died...
{15669}{15750}- ...your family buried your dog with you.|- Why?
{15762}{15836}Dogs were good at swimming|across rivers in the underworld.
{15842}{15871}People believe that?
{15878}{15908}Sucre, where I grew up...
{15914}{16015}...we were taught foreigners were|demons who came to rob body grease...
{16021}{16142}...and that the government used|this human fat to lubricate its machines.
{16409}{16442}Sir?
{16455}{16536}Should I ask him|if he wants to borrow my penis?
{16570}{16604}Should l?
{16913}{16950}- Lieutenant Rejas?|- Yes.
{16956}{16992}Sergeant Sucre?
{17004}{17098}I'm Major Kwan.|Thank you for helping us out.
{17129}{17240}At the other side of the building|there's a door in the wall.
{17246}{17306}In the next few minutes,|a man will walk up.
{17313}{17420}At his request, then you open|the door, wait by the car...
{17426}{17554}...and make sure no one engages him|in conversation or takes his photograph.
{17559}{17679}And for your information,|do be discreet in what you say.
{17685}{17741}There are microphones everywhere.
{17748}{17803}May I ask you|to pull your car over there?
{17809}{17837}- Thank you.|- Yeah.
{17843}{17885}And who is this person?
{17891}{17942}A private citizen.
{17949}{17989}Hey.
{17996}{18042}What's in the briefcase?
{18048}{18093}My laundry.
{18141}{18185}His laundry.
{18679}{18704}Yes.
{18729}{18761}I'll spell it out for you.
{18767}{18807}E- Z-E...
{18813}{18874}...Q-U-l...
{18881}{18928}...E-L.
{19069}{19164}Excuse me. Weren't you a junior partner|at Belaunde & Vargas?
{19170}{19219}Yes, I was.
{19385}{19472}Welcome, Mr. President.|Congratulations on your election.
{19478}{19517}Good luck, Mr. President.
{19555}{19598}Congratulations, Senor Presidente.
{20904}{20958}Let me hang this up first.
{21888}{21931}Death to Deng Xiao Ping
{21938}{21977}Long live President Ezequiel
{22440}{22540}Yeah, rice wine|has that effect on me too.
{22579}{22662}So, who was that|shadowy motherfucker?
{22697}{22755}T ristan Calderon. He's a lawyer.
{22762}{22804}He represented the drug cartels.
{22810}{22904}He represented that British soldier|who made all the students disappear.
{22910}{23009}He also represented the president elect|in a statutory rape case.
{23041}{23064}How do you know?
{23071}{23154}I worked at the law firm|which acted as counsel for the girl.
{23161}{23197}What happened?
{23204}{23272}She closed the case|after her father lost his job...
{23278}{23344}...and her brother was raped.|She now lives in Miami.
{23362}{23400}Jesus Christ!
{23462}{23498}Fuck.
{24149}{24204}When I hear the word culture|I reach for my pistol
{24210}{24238}Okay, now...
{24278}{24361}What sort of a person would do that?
{24401}{24436}I don't know.
{24467}{24544}But I wouldn't entirely|rule out a cat lover.
{25259}{25335}I have something for my father,|Senor Granizo.
{25341}{25445}Okay, okay. Senor Granizo?|Here's your son.
{25482}{25521}Papa, Papa!
{25609}{25661}Viva El Presidente Ezequiel!
{25848}{25901}Viva El Presidente Ezequiel.
{26174}{26249}- You were a lawyer before?|- That's right.
{26297}{26332}Lawyers.
{26338}{26385}They' re the worst.
{26391}{26469}Bent. But you never catch them.
{26499}{26537}You want one?
{26573}{26596}No, thanks.
{26694}{26742}Why did you want to be a lawyer?
{26749}{26843}- I don't think I did want to be one.|- Well, what did you want to be?
{26849}{26898}I wanted to be a coffee farmer.
{26921}{26948}Like my father.
{26973}{27043}So why didn't you?|What stopped you?
{27058}{27096}I lack a coffee farm.
{27115}{27194}- What happened to your father's?|- The military seized it.
{27211}{27305}Do you have a feeling about that?|Or are you the Gary Cooper type?
{27333}{27473}Yes, I do have a feeling about that.|But perhaps I am the Gary Cooper type.
{27606}{27644}So...
{27679}{27782}...you went to university,|you got yourself a first-class degree...
{27788}{27857}...a prestigious law prize...
{27872}{27936}...worked with a bunch of fat cats...
{27953}{27986}Suddenly, you quit.
{27993}{28063}Not to move to Florida,|like anyone with half a brain...
{28069}{28128}...but to San Luis Police Academy.
{28134}{28183}Jesus Christ, Rejas.
{28189}{28275}You're 36 years old. You could|be heading for a judgeship by now...
{28281}{28376}...not a lieutenant having to make|ends meet on diplomatic road watch.
{28425}{28467}Why are you here?
{28474}{28562}I heard a powerful attorney once say,|"The establishing of the truth...
{28568}{28628}...was only one of the things|a trial is for. "
{28665}{28738}That is when I understood|the law wasn't for me.
{28790}{28858}Do you have a delicate|constitution or something?
{28879}{28927}No, sir. No.
{29208}{29257}You speak Quechua?
{29274}{29326}Well, yes. My mother's part lndian.
{29333}{29381}At police college...
{29408}{29487}...we used to make the lndians|eat dog shit.
{29527}{29598}Then it's fortunate that|I wasn't in your class, sir.
{29625}{29704}- Fortunate for whom?|- I should think both of us.
{29809}{29850}Here's what I want you to do.
{29856}{29914}I want you to take four people...
{29920}{30038}...you know, if you can find four|who aren't on some criminal's payroll...
{30066}{30182}...and I want you to investigate|this entity called Ezequiel.
{30188}{30252}Find out what's happening|before the army does.
{30259}{30347}You wanna see the army|back on the street again?
{30397}{30453}- You can go.|- Thank you, sir.
{30459}{30503}May I take this?
{30635}{30717}What did you tell Calderon|about Ezequiel?
{30785}{30808}Nothing.
{30921}{30999}You're not the only policeman here|who speaks quechua.
{31842}{31886}Man stoned to death.
{31892}{32033}A 33-year-old policeman was stoned|to death last week in Sierra de Puna. "
{32039}{32078}Mystery surrounds body.
{32084}{32161}An unidentified body was found,|with the limbs hacked off...
{32167}{32263}...on a roadside near Jauja,|200 miles east of the capital.
{32269}{32357}A note attached to the man's neck|was written in the victim's blood.
{32363}{32441}'Hurry to cut off the fat arms|of the damned.' "
{32448}{32509}A message found on the body declared:
{32516}{32626}'Guns will make us powerful.|Butter will only make us fat.' "
{32689}{32796}Dead dogs suspended from lampposts.|Macabre spectacle. "
{32868}{32974}The body had been skinned alive|using a high-pressure water hose. "
{34467}{34550}- You like it?|- Yes, it's really sweet.
{34556}{34607}Where might I have put my Bible?
{34613}{34706}I think I put that sort of thing|in the cabinet.
{34712}{34748}Yeah?
{35025}{35056}Good morning.
{35207}{35294}Jesus Christ.|Are you with the police force?
{35347}{35398}Sergeant Sucre? You begin.
{35506}{35575}We've drawn a blank|with the boy bomber, sir.
{35581}{35635}A small part of his face was left intact...
{35642}{35721}...so I've been able to circulate|an artist's impression.
{35727}{35788}He was about 10 years old,|probably not local.
{35794}{35858}Before entering the hotel,|he'd drunk lnca Cola...
{35862}{35902}...and eaten meatballs|with rice.
{35908}{36000}But no one's claimed the body and|no one has heard of Ezequiel before...
{36007}{36056}...so we have no suspects.
{36063}{36124}- What about those dogs?|- Clorindo, please.
{36130}{36183}Yes. Well, as it turns out...
{36189}{36269}...it's not the first time dogs|have been killed like that.
{36275}{36329}In the last election,|dogs were strung up...
{36336}{36397}...in two villages in|the Ayacucho region.
{36404}{36511}I've checked the folklore, bearing in mind|one or two references to Deng Xiaoping.
{36518}{36587}Yes, in China,|you may be interested to know...
{36593}{36713}...a dead dog is symbolic of a tyrant|condemned to death by his people.
{36754}{36821}- Llosa.|- ln the remoter valleys...
{36826}{36910}...around the Huallaga, masked robbers|have twice been reported...
{36915}{36957}...conducting kangaroo trials.
{36964}{37038}The targets in both cases|were government representatives.
{37044}{37126}They were executed in a ritualistic way,|with stones or knives...
{37132}{37196}...then messages|were written in their blood.
{37358}{37422}A strategic equilibrium.
{37498}{37569}Anybody here know|what the fuck that means?
{37600}{37735}You traced some of this crap|back to a German philosopher?
{37742}{37862}So far, I've found three references from|Kant and two from the prophet Ezekiel.
{37868}{37921}Yes, but who is this Ezequiel?
{37927}{38031}Some guy who never got laid?|Some smart aleck who reads too much?
{38037}{38123}Some creep on a bridge spitting at|the traffic? What is your theory?
{38130}{38225}Well, if it is a creep spitting off a bridge,|he has a lot of saliva, sir.
{38266}{38332}It seems these actions started|in the countryside...
{38338}{38404}...around the time General Latche|stepped down.
{38430}{38504}Most have taken place|in isolated communities...
{38510}{38592}...where the idea of a central|government almost doesn't apply.
{38598}{38664}I have to emphasize|there haven't been a ton of them.
{38670}{38722}About 37 in 5 years.
{38742}{38826}And at first glance, they might|appear to be random and scattered.
{38832}{38924}- ln no case was there ever a name.|- Lieutenant, what are you saying?
{38930}{38973}I'm saying that 5 years ago...
{38979}{39088}...these actions, thought to have been|taken by a secret wing of the army...
{39094}{39190}...or by drug cartels,|or by student organizations...
{39197}{39242}...in fact, may not have been.
{39248}{39329}Well, then who's behind it?|We have a name, don't we?
{39336}{39388}We do now have a name.
{39403}{39463}But so far, there isn't a manifesto.
{39469}{39527}There isn't a plan.|There isn't a spokesperson.
{39533}{39597}We don't have any clue as|to who the leaders are.
{39601}{39655}There isn't an organization,|or a known HQ.
{39662}{39710}There is only someone called Ezequiel.
{39729}{39793}So, what you're saying is...
{39798}{39884}...we don't know what he or she is...
{39890}{39941}...who they are, or what they want.
{39948}{39984}No, sir.
{40140}{40194}- Can you speak?|- Yes.
{40291}{40337}Do you have any conclusion?
{40343}{40407}It appears a revolution|could be going on.
{40413}{40517}But a revolution that has yet|to declare itself in that orientation.
{40543}{40589}For the moment.
{40681}{40720}T omcats.
{40734}{40782}Do you know anything|about them, Rejas?
{40813}{40842}No, sir.
{40869}{40963}If you're looking for a tomcat,|you don't send two dogs up an alley...
{40969}{41037}...because they knock over|garbage cans, they fight...
{41043}{41134}...fuck each other in the ribs.|Cat leaps up a tree and pisses on them.
{41140}{41220}You send in someone who knows|the other one's way of thinking.
{41227}{41326}How he smells, you know.|Well, how to meow.
{41332}{41474}You send in another tomcat.|So I want you to be my tomcat, Rejas.
{41578}{41622}Very well, sir.
{42243}{42275}Sweetheart.
{42286}{42319}Hi.
{42325}{42368}Where is your mother?
{42639}{42689}- Hi, honey.|- Hi.
{42695}{42743}Marco sent the camera and the film.
{42749}{42820}He got it for his birthday|and he already has one.
{42846}{42940}Agustin, I know we can't|afford it now, but...
{42946}{43000}Which one do you prefer?|I can't decide.
{43007}{43063}The one you already have.
{43070}{43103}You're just saying that.
{43110}{43159}It changed Marina's life.
{43166}{43240}- Marina's had a nose job?|- My God, Agustin.
{43246}{43291}How can you be a detective?
{43297}{43362}She's had three nose jobs|since you've known her.
{43369}{43407}Why do you want to|look like your friends?
{43414}{43460}I don't want to look like my friends.
{43466}{43564}I just don't want to spend any more|of my life reminding people of Pinocchio.
{43655}{43714}- I've been promoted.|- Really?
{43720}{43778}I might even be paid now.
{44212}{44235}nine months later
{44241}{44319}We wait six weeks for him|to put another packet in the fridge...
{44325}{44385}...and last night, we grab him.
{44391}{44443}But what's in the packet this time?
{44481}{44541}A leg of fucking ham.|We have to let him go.
{44547}{44623}Six weeks watching|a fucking freezer!
{44629}{44683}Did you confiscate the ham?
{44704}{44753}Yes, it's what we had for lunch.
{44759}{44806}What about the student haunts?
{44818}{44927}We've got four cafes under surveillance,|but we have to do it in rotation.
{44933}{44974}It takes a lot of manpower.
{44985}{45028}Keep at it for the moment.
{45040}{45083}What else have we got?
{45097}{45131}Two homosexuals beheaded.
{45137}{45205}And they shot the mayor of Silar|in a barbershop.
{45211}{45242}Silar?
{45257}{45292}Any suspects?
{45309}{45364}Just 23 million.
{45407}{45445}Then we're narrowing it down.
{45452}{45505}If he's a democrat,|then I'm an astronaut.
{45511}{45557}They could find him|if they wanted to.
{45563}{45640}They know him.|Quite a few people know him.
{45646}{45710}And even more people know|why we need him.
{45715}{45794}What we are discussing here|is a new birth.
{45820}{45903}And a new birth involves blood.
{45950}{45998}Okay, who says:
{46004}{46096}It's necessary that our civilization|builds its temples...
{46103}{46176}...on mountains of corpses,|on an ocean of tears...
{46182}{46232}...on the death of men|without number"?
{46238}{46287}- Napoleon.|- Charron?
{46293}{46339}- Von Hassler?|- Right!
{46345}{46368}Who said:
{46375}{46480}I would like the last king to be strangled|by the sash of the last priest"?
{46486}{46516}- Mussolini.|- No.
{46522}{46573}- Pol Pot?|- Lord Rochester?
{46579}{46621}Jean Messelier.
{46649}{46682}Who said:
{46701}{46806}Man 's ultimate desire|is to be God"?
{47022}{47069}Who is Ezequiel?
{47088}{47129}- It's possible--|- Fuck!
{47135}{47202}- Why do you say " possible"?|- Because l' m not sure.
{47209}{47264}But you said you were.
{47270}{47342}It's possible he was|a Kantian philosopher...
{47362}{47396}...of no small distinction.
{47402}{47476}I taught with him at San Cristobal|University in Ayacucho.
{47483}{47526}Why do you think he is Ezequiel?
{47533}{47609}- Because of the things he believed.|- Like?
{47616}{47687}He maintained he was|the fourth flame of Communism...
{47693}{47749}...after Mao, Lenin and Marx.
{47756}{47832}He was also fond of quoting|the prophet Ezekiel.
{47839}{47917}You're a man|who understands history, right?
{47976}{48054}If you want to start a revolution,|why not issue a manifesto?
{48060}{48132}Why not show people who you are|and what you are doing?
{48139}{48240}That's perfectly understandable.|Socrates wrote nothing down.
{48247}{48278}Neither did Jesus.
{48284}{48385}You see, the problem with text|is that it assumes its own reality.
{48391}{48458}It cannot answer, it cannot explain.
{48464}{48567}So if you want it to be effective,|you leave no trace, right?
{48574}{48621}That's right.
{48640}{48740}- Describe him.|- But this was 10 years ago.
{48772}{48815}Then concentrate.
{48874}{48911}Average height...
{48946}{49040}...glasses, dark hair, thin.
{49046}{49077}Dress?
{49083}{49182}Left Bank look. Supposedly,|he'd been in Paris for a time.
{49194}{49248}Always a cigarette in his mouth.
{49255}{49332}- Can you remember the brand?|- Very well.
{49413}{49505}He made this thing|of preferring unfiltered Camels.
{49561}{49596}Would you have a photo?
{49603}{49667}He would never allow himself|to be photographed.
{49673}{49706}I see.
{49755}{49815}So, what is this person's name?
{49996}{50037}Rivas.
{50097}{50166}Edgardo Rodriguez Rivas.
{50243}{50286}Fine. Thank you very much.
{51135}{51194}No. Honey, wait.
{51211}{51263}Marco saw the guy|who wrote it on TV.
{51269}{51340}He thinks women down here will love it.
{51346}{51450}I just hope Marina doesn't find out|where I got the idea from.
{51456}{51522}Would you read my speech?|I've written two pages.
{51528}{51588}It's enough, isn't it, for 10 minutes?
{51692}{51741}Oh, I'll happily trade.
{51774}{51804}Let me see.
{51810}{51852}And you will be here to help?
{51858}{51931}You're not going to wriggle out|of my literary evening.
{51937}{51989}Of course I'll be here.
{52141}{52179}Come.
{52240}{52322}This novel is about|a photographer cowboy...
{52328}{52425}...who is always bringing light|into women's lives. "
{52442}{52466}Yeah?
{52630}{52673}- Agustin.|- Hi, Marina.
{52695}{52737}I can't read my handwriting.
{52761}{52804}So is this the ballet school?
{52810}{52883}This is it, big boy.|Brought your tutu?
{52914}{52956}- Where's Sylvie?|- At the vet.
{52963}{53002}How's Mom's apartment?
{53008}{53044}Listen...
{53077}{53125}I'm sorry we are behind with the rent.
{53132}{53184}I don't mean that. I know you'll pay.
{53191}{53235}Anyway, don't worry about that.
{53242}{53320}Is it true what Sylvie said?|They'll put you in charge?
{53345}{53386}- Sylvina told you?|- Y eah.
{53392}{53451}We're not supposed|to talk about that publicly.
{53457}{53527}I'm not talking about it publicly.
{53534}{53580}Is there a revolution going on?
{53586}{53642}Come on,|you promised to tell me, Agustin.
{53650}{53704}Otherwise I will never know|what to wear.
{53711}{53797}- I will keep that in mind. Bye.|- All right. Bye.
{53934}{53963}Yes?
{53986}{54024}Have you a moment?
{54030}{54080}- I'm Laura's father.|- Oh.
{54110}{54160}Yolanda. But Laura's left.
{54166}{54240}- You didn't see her?|- Yes, she's in the car.
{54246}{54293}Don't you want to bring her in?
{54306}{54363}I'd rather not. It's about your letter.
{54611}{54658}Laura's told you, I guess.
{54796}{54857}Do you want some cake?|I made it this morning.
{54977}{55023}So this is it.
{55231}{55274}I'm sorry about the mess...
{55280}{55322}...but I wasn't expecting anyone.
{55411}{55466}- Here's the money.|- Yeah.
{55472}{55522}I'm sorry the check bounced.
{55538}{55589}I warn you, it may not be the last time.
{55594}{55679}My employers are two months|in arrears with our salaries.
{55684}{55712}Yeah, I've been warned.
{55717}{55808}It doesn't matter. You're not|the first ballet father to bounce a check.
{55848}{55916}If you need it back,|you know where it is.
{56129}{56186}- Sit down.|- No, thank you.
{56229}{56279}Your daughter is|a real spot of sunshine.
{56797}{56845}I'm completely soaked.
{56971}{57123}I'm not sure you can answer this,|but should we encourage Laura?
{57138}{57205}My wife is keen for her|to join the Metropolitan.
{57220}{57332}- Well, they do take very few.|- Then are we wasting our time?
{57354}{57450}I have the feeling she would rather|try the kind of things I do.
{57456}{57486}What is that?
{57670}{57734}So Minister Quesada|likes the theater?
{57740}{57798}No, he hates the theater.
{57804}{57885}But one of the actresses sent|him some tickets.
{58146}{58213}You said it would be a musical.
{58384}{58438}Is it a life you recommend?
{58468}{58543}It depends if you want your|daughter to turn out like me.
{58550}{58615}What does that mean,|turn out like you?
{58637}{58750}No idea. I'm usually moving too|much to think about that. Thankfully.
{58909}{59018}- Bring back Robert Wilson.|- No, don't.
{59113}{59182}- You funded this.|- Get on with it.
{59189}{59248}It must be very demanding.|Physically.
{59254}{59302}Yes, sometimes.
{59531}{59578}Why does Laura need|to be on a diet?
{59584}{59648}Oh, no, she shouldn't be on a diet.
{59653}{59712}She needs energy and|she's lovely as she is.
{59718}{59786}I think so. Yes, I think so.
{60288}{60367}Death to all traitors|Long live President Ezequiel
{60400}{60513}- Daddy?|- Sorry, sweetheart. I'll be right out.
{60528}{60629}- But...|- What is it, Laura?
{60635}{60785}I answered your phone and you're|to call the Fisherman immediately.
{60792}{60850}Would it be too much if|I left Laura until...
{60856}{60936}- ...her mother collects her?|- She doesn't need to collect her.
{60942}{61032}- lt isn't far and I'd like a walk.|- Thank you, that's very kind of you.
{61056}{61135}Remember, we don't tell people|what Daddy does for a living.
{61141}{61190}Of course not.|Will you be okay, Daddy?
{61196}{61256}Of course. Tell your|mother I'll call her later.
{61262}{61297}- Okay.|- Thanks again.
{61304}{61343}You're welcome.
{61398}{61431}Come.
{61515}{61626}We walk to the end of Calle Diderot,|and then we turn left at the corner.
{61632}{61685}- Okay?|- Okay.
{62029}{62108}- Yes, sir.|- Who were they?
{62145}{62232}Students, they said. From the|Catholic University.
{62239}{62303}No names, and they paid|in cash. Right?
{62308}{62372}I was grateful for the business.
{62445}{62504}Merino spoke to the|Americans and Canadians.
{62510}{62576}They volunteered|help with forensics.
{62631}{62668}Fine, thank you.
{62779}{62843}When did Minister Quesada arrive?
{63335}{63387}Someone's celebrating.
{63469}{63540}- You drive.|- Okay.
{63893}{63948}Stop. Wait!
{64011}{64043}Wait!
{64273}{64365}Wait. Who gave these to you?|Who gave these to you?
{64409}{64453}Where did you get these posters?
{64460}{64492}We were paid.
{64503}{64526}Who paid you?
{64553}{64602}The wind blew it into my hand.
{64702}{64768}Get into the car. They'll kill you.
{64775}{64824}I'm dead already.
{65010}{65053}A thousand eyes are on you
{65129}{65165}Is that him?
{65267}{65344}- Yes.|- How do you know?
{65350}{65398}I took the photograph.
{65421}{65489}Last night, after a meeting of|the Cabinet to discuss...
{65494}{65584}...the execution of lnterior Minister|Quesada, the president returned...
{65590}{65718}...to his private chambers. He|found this taped over his toilet.
{65757}{65809}Roughly translated it says:
{65815}{65926} Missed you at the opening, but|you'll soon be flushed away. "
{66024}{66109}The photograph is uncredited,|you'll be pleased to hear.
{66295}{66339}General Merino...
{66360}{66471}... 11 months ago, I called to ask|what this officer knew about Ezequiel.
{66477}{66575}T oday, our city woke up to|pictures of his face everywhere.
{66585}{66653}May I ask again what|you know about this man?
{66705}{66811}Well, the leads are still very scarce.
{66817}{66922}I remind you that until last night,|little had happened in the capital...
{66928}{67045}...if anything, and we have almost|no resources for investigating.
{67051}{67128}All we know is, there's been|a series of incidents...
{67134}{67228}...which sometimes have a|connection with the name Ezequiel.
{67234}{67315}So you don't know that he's|called Edgardo Rivas...
{67335}{67418}...that he was a professor|of philosophy at Ayacucho...
{67436}{67533}...or that these incidents, which you|feel may be developing into a pattern...
{67539}{67627}...are in fact, 327 separate actions...
{67633}{67721}...up to and including the murder of|six policemen, three mayors...
{67727}{67823}... 11 city counselors and the|minister of the interior.
{67942}{68070}Gentlemen, it strikes me there's|actually a revolution going on.
{68085}{68177}May I ask why the chief has seen|fit to keep the palace in the dark?
{68187}{68300}I've proceeded with this case|as I have done in my whole career.
{68306}{68415}It is a matter for the police|and for the judiciary.
{68421}{68549}I refuse to detain people before we|have evidence they are implicated.
{68554}{68598}And last night?
{68629}{68695}Are you asking what goes on|in the president's bathroom?
{68702}{68770}No, captain. I'm asking you|about Quesada's murder.
{68776}{68840}It was a theater group. Two|men and four women.
{68845}{68896}Allegedly from the|Catholic University.
{68903}{69020}I interviewed the only drama group,|and they had nothing to do with it.
{69028}{69141}The president and five ministers|were sent complimentary tickets.
{69216}{69337}Black Out. Lucky it wasn't Evita,|or we might not have a government.
{69363}{69439}What else can you tell us|about Rivas?
{69492}{69563}This man hasn't been seen|in 10 years.
{69569}{69666}In that time, what do you suppose|has been going through his mind?
{69673}{69768}Well, I think he thinks that the|capital is the head of the monster.
{69774}{69847}I think he thinks|that if the tree gives rotten fruit...
{69852}{69938}- ...then you cut down the tree.|- ls that what you think?
{69952}{70058}I think just because the president is|a rapist, it doesn't make democracy bad.
{70064}{70167}Success might have come sooner had we|reacted earlier with a clear policy...
{70173}{70257}...and if the state had an image|of being just, generous and firm.
{70262}{70397}- Unfortunately, the state isn't that.|- This professor, I'd like to interview him.
{70443}{70489}He's disappeared.
{70506}{70570}Why did I know you'd say that?
{70575}{70693}Maybe he's in Miami. Key|witnesses often turn up there.
{70783}{70861}You have two more weeks|to catch Ezequiel.
{70881}{70959}If in that time another member of|government is threatened...
{70964}{71012}...or there's an incident like this...
{71017}{71115}...I will bring in the army with such|rapidity, such clarity of intent...
{71120}{71199}...that you won't be worrying|about legal niceties.
{71205}{71316}Then I'd like a list of staff with|access to the president's chambers.
{71323}{71378}Happily, there are only two of them.
{71384}{71507}The first is named Fuck,|the second is named Off.
{71567}{71662}How would the president feel about|seeing soldiers on the street again?
{71668}{71781}Let the president's advisers worry|about the president's feelings, Rejas.
{71787}{71917}Then I suggest their security|should be especially vigilant, sir.
{72144}{72301}I've given instructions. No restaurants,|no beach, not even church.
{72353}{72382}No church?
{73214}{73246}How old are you?
{73594}{73664}- Well done. Zileri, isn't it?|- That's right, sir.
{73670}{73741}Come with me.|Any sign of the army?
{73747}{73799}I kept the location off the air.
{73818}{73864}Apparently there were three of them.
{73871}{73950}They took off on foot,|and they were dragging someone.
{74020}{74078}- Watch the car.|- Yes, sir.
{76792}{76836}Help is coming.
{76948}{76985}Help is coming.
{77959}{78069}You'll see a church|with a tin steeple.
{78075}{78151}- We're there in two minutes.|- Fine.
{78906}{78970}Blank, blank, blank.|All fucking blank, shit.
{78975}{79045}Wait, here. Here's something.
{79070}{79215}Here's something. Looks like|Chinese and some weird word.
{79226}{79306}- Might be Greek.|- What about these?
{79312}{79421}91092, Hola. 17891, Elle.
{79427}{79539}24390, Dona cover. "|What...a code maybe?
{79546}{79619}- No.|- Captain Rejas?
{79635}{79728}Captain Montesinos, military police.|I'm taking over this investigation.
{79740}{79856}Under article 6223 of our civilian code|you're trespassing on a crime scene.
{79868}{79996}Not anymore. As of 7:50 p.m.,|the president declared martial law.
{80002}{80084}This is no longer your crime scene.|I have to ask you to leave.
{80179}{80243}Yes, sir, I'll verify that.
{80364}{80432}- I hope I can pull this cart by myself.|- Then you say?
{80437}{80510}- I got to get back in business again.|- Okay, then you go.
{80515}{80587}Hey, you guys. I need to lock up.
{80803}{80889}Arguedas Theatre Group|Rehearsal in progress
{81012}{81084}And as Silk Leigh says to Katharine:
{81090}{81221}Old soul, don't worry,|you will survive.
{81232}{81337}The strong tend to leave. "
{81384}{81438}Isn't that clever?
{81719}{81811}I don't know whether to say, "What's|happened to you? " or "Can I watch? "
{81852}{81980}I had a girl die in my arms|with her face...
{82027}{82091}- ...blown off.|- Oh, my God.
{82102}{82170}They have declared martial law.
{82176}{82263}That should give you|some indication of what to wear.
{82278}{82321}Yeah, sort of.
{82327}{82386}How was your evening?
{82398}{82472}Sylvina's report was great...
{82478}{82516}...but, Jesus, that book is shit.
{82523}{82587}Just the kind of crap|Marco actually read.
{82598}{82635}Right.
{82706}{82748}Laura.
{85454}{85561}Admiral Prado assassinated|17 drama students kidnapped
{86462}{86519}What's going on?
{86545}{86619}The investigation is in|the hands of the security forces.
{86626}{86726}They are taking all our files to copy,|and they have canceled our overtime.
{86732}{86791}Was that you?
{86850}{86945}Are you nuts? Look at my face.|How do you think I keep it this way?
{86951}{87006}It was her.
{87128}{87224}Don't touch those. They're personal.
{87343}{87393}Excuse me.
{87436}{87514}I asked you not to take them away.
{87523}{87598}Our orders are to take everything.
{87604}{87641}Hey.
{87745}{87785}Hey!
{87807}{87852}Stop! Stop!
{87862}{87913}- Let him go.|- Please, stop!
{87937}{88048}- I said, step away!|- It's okay. I'm fine.
{88056}{88124}- Fuck off.|- I think the world has gone deaf.
{88130}{88191}How dare you kill the theatrical group?!
{88197}{88282}I told you we had established|their innocence.
{88683}{88772}It's okay, we don't need|copies of these.
{88937}{88996}- Get off me.|- By the way...
{89002}{89058}...you shouldn't be so upset about this.
{89064}{89134}You're perfectly free|to continue your investigation.
{89140}{89244}It's just that from now on|you won't be so alone.
{89478}{89559}You know the great thing|about me, Llosa?
{89580}{89632}Do you?
{89638}{89737}Do you know what I like|so much about me?
{89757}{89797}The truth?
{89803}{89841}Okay, I'll tell you.
{89862}{89950}What I like so much about myself...
{89956}{90080}...is that I could like myself|a lot more. Honestly.
{90086}{90171}I have that capacity--
{90215}{90298}Here she comes.
{90325}{90420}I love to see your eyes.
{90427}{90556}You're such a lovely girl.|Oh, mamita, mamita.
{90654}{90706}Llosa...
{90712}{90791}...ask her whether|she wouldn't feel more comfortable...
{90796}{90913}...unencumbered by all that clothing.|You just...
{91006}{91044}Llosa...
{91050}{91110}...that's an order.
{91116}{91152}I meant that as an order.
{91229}{91273}Bye.
{91295}{91385}Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
{91537}{91573}No gym today.
{92718}{92808}- Like a turn?|- No, thanks. I've seen her butt.
{92814}{92860}It's nice.
{92903}{92931}Jesus.
{93494}{93544}Police! On the ground!|Don't move!
{93551}{93597}On the ground!
{93668}{93693}Right.
{93775}{93913}- Llosa, see you later.|- I hope so.
{95307}{95348}State of Siege 
{96192}{96269}To Santiago on his first Communion
{96800}{96875}Why does he keep watching that? 
{96900}{96933}He was his altar boy. 
{96939}{97003}Did I baptize you? 
{97049}{97125}Did I baptize you? 
{97452}{97519}Is it out of cash? 
{97615}{97655}Papers? 
{97913}{97961}Excuse me. 
{97970}{98001}- Okay? - Okay.
{98053}{98141}- Do you know him? - Y es, he's my cousin. Bye.
{98170}{98213}What are you doing in my war zone? 
{98218}{98303}I' m looking for a cash machine that works when you don't have money.
{98308}{98381}Listen, I'm glad I ran into you. 
{98386}{98475}I probably wouldn't have had the courage to come and see you.
{98480}{98506}- Going home? - Yeah.
{98511}{98570}I'll give you a lift. 
{98583}{98726}When I was Laura's age, I played the flute in the Candle Dance.
{98731}{98773}- Oh, yeah? - Yes.
{98778}{98865}I've never met anyone who has been in Ausangate.
{98870}{98924}That's funny. 
{98929}{99016}- Do you want to hear her music? - I'd love to.
{99021}{99095}This is what Laura has. She has her own way of moving...
{99100}{99145}...which you can't teach. 
{99150}{99227}Just like the girls in the Sierra. 
{99244}{99294}Can I help put this away? 
{99317}{99379}Oh, no. I'm going to do it myself. Thanks.
{99384}{99438}Sit down. 
{99518}{99584}- Would you like some tea? - Sure.
{99661}{99722}You shouldn't take her out now. She's so good.
{99727}{99812}You'll be shocked when you see her. Really.
{100138}{100242}What is it? Are you all right? Yolanda, what happened?
{100351}{100446}- Why are you screaming? - I can't breathe!
{100513}{100572}Your nose is bleeding. 
{100577}{100635}Where are your shoes? 
{100651}{100742}- Calm down. - I'm sorry. I can't breathe.
{100747}{100821}- Oh, please, take me outside. - Put your head back.
{100826}{100897}I can't stay in the dark. 
{100918}{100964}- Don't worry. - I'm sorry.
{101023}{101072}I'm sorry. 
{101077}{101114}Here. 
{101185}{101288}- Oh, my God. - We will go and find some light.
{101542}{101616}Miraflores has electricity. Should we look for a pharmacy?
{101620}{101682}Oh, no. I'm all right, it stopped. 
{101688}{101758}I'll stay with you a little while. 
{101773}{101811}Yeah. 
{101822}{101857}Okay. 
{102218}{102307}I'm so relieved you were there tonight, you know?
{102344}{102406}I'm sorry, but I don't like the dark. 
{102412}{102463}I hate it. 
{102516}{102574}Any reason? 
{102683}{102769}Do you only teach or do you still dance?
{102776}{102867}Well, just recently I started working on a new piece.
{102872}{102965}I have an idea, but I still don't know. It's...
{103058}{103108}What is it about? 
{103113}{103212}Oh, something to do with the murder of that theatrical group, you know?
{103234}{103324}- But... - But what?
{103359}{103446}It's unlucky to talk about work in progress.
{103451}{103526}Tell me about you. I know that you are a father, husband...
{103531}{103605}...and a lawyer and what else? 
{103610}{103693}Yes, I'm a father and a husband, but I'm no longer a lawyer.
{103710}{103738}What do you do now? 
{103771}{103889}I'm trying to find a more honest way of practicing the law.
{104009}{104077}I wanted to see you before I left town. 
{104149}{104271}So if you are no longer a lawyer, what do you do?
{104306}{104395}You said it's unlucky to talk about work in progress.
{104400}{104455}You mentioned you were going away. Where to?
{104460}{104531}- My village. - You go back often?
{104551}{104606}No, not since my father died. 
{104617}{104734}- And when was that? - After the military confiscated our farm.
{104739}{104795}And why now? 
{104807}{104896}Well, I have to pay a visit to an old friend...
{104901}{104985}...who, I think, has something worth traveling for.
{105084}{105141}Be careful. 
{105423}{105462}Okay. 
{105467}{105572}This is fine, thank you. I think I can make it.
{105577}{105694}You don't need to walk me up. I've taken up too much of your time.
{105707}{105784}- So bye. - Goodbye.
{105827}{105879}Could I bring you anything from the countryside?
{105893}{105955}Maybe an emergency generator. 
{105961}{106003}Not just a flashlight? 
{106010}{106150}- A Roman candle? A box of matches? - A jar of fireflies.
{106293}{106354}Will you be gone long? 
{106758}{106850}You know the fireworks you see in the blackouts?
{106855}{106925}They say it's him, planning his operations.
{106940}{107013}His women love to kill. It's an event. 
{107018}{107094}Then they fuck for three days. Ezequiel too.
{107099}{107180}He just does what he wants with them, and they let him.
{107185}{107240}- How do you know? - This broad from Tacna.
{107245}{107394}She hears things. Man, it's no world revolution. It's a fuck-athon.
{107450}{107515}He's in the jungle. 
{107545}{107594}He's in the mountains. 
{107622}{107714}He's every tick of every clock. 
{107731}{107816}He's every breeze in every tree. 
{107918}{108013}He's every sun which refuses to set. 
{109036}{109198}Can you tell me if anyone is living at the old coffee farm?
{109604}{109690}T o Augustin on his first Communion from Father Ramon
{112269}{112314}Santiago. 
{112382}{112486}If I told you that I knew some people had come to this village...
{112491}{112551}...stayed in your house... 
{112556}{112633}...murdered the village priest... 
{112638}{112782}...and that his last supper was a number of pages from your Bible...
{112819}{112906}...what would you offer in the way of an explanation?
{112968}{113051}Why did they make a tape? 
{113233}{113338}It was for Ezequiel. She wanted to re-affirm her commitment.
{113344}{113434}By killing the man who baptised her? 
{113449}{113532}Who was she? 
{113611}{113668}She was called Edith Pusanga. 
{113689}{113817}The army killed her a fortnight ago. 
{113843}{113907}An ambush over in Tres Crusas. 
{113923}{114057}What was she to Ezequiel? 
{114088}{114137}They say she was once his mistress. 
{114160}{114224}She was a doctor. 
{114247}{114329}In the early days of the revolution... 
{114335}{114457}...she was the only one who could be trusted to write prescriptions.
{114470}{114515}Is he ill? 
{114669}{114706}Is he ill? 
{115222}{115274}Your Bible. 
{115676}{115732}Agustin. 
{115740}{115850}Don't stay here. 
{116671}{116779}- ls the curfew still on? - lt starts in 15 minutes.
{117070}{117145}Agustin, if you arrive back today or call home...
{117150}{117233}... we 're staying the night at Marina 's. Bye.
{117381}{117461}- Y olanda, it's Agustin. - Agustin?
{117466}{117557}I' m sorry to ring out of the blue, but l' m told there are women...
{117562}{117653}...you can wake in the middle of the night and those you can't.
{117658}{117708}What's wrong? What's the time? 
{117713}{117826}It's almost 2:00 a.m., but I'd like to see you now.
{117831}{117895}Are you free? Maybe you are tired. 
{117910}{117952}I'd love to see you. Where are you?
{118079}{118152}How many pesos, senor. 
{118160}{118187}Senor? 
{118411}{118515}- Next week is my birthday. - Really? How will you celebrate?
{118520}{118619}Oh, rehearse, then classes, more rehearsing, that's all.
{118624}{118720}On your birthday? What about your family?
{118771}{118846}I don't know. Three years ago, I guess.
{118851}{118944}And, when he left, he said the strangest thing to me.
{118949}{119026}He said I was someone who was just along for the ride...
{119031}{119129}...but that I wouldn't get off until the very last stop.
{119328}{119410}Oh, tonight... 
{119415}{119476}...I am prepared. 
{119544}{119586}Good. 
{119699}{119786}So, what's tonight's code? 
{119805}{119843}Sorry? 
{119874}{119940}What's tonight's code? 
{119969}{120008}Blue. 
{120052}{120098}Blue means... 
{120103}{120183}...that you'll be rung from out of the blue.
{120403}{120452}I want to find out what prescriptions...
{120457}{120555}...have been written by a Doctor Edith Pusanga.
{120560}{120604}No, here in the city. 
{120609}{120737}Y es, and also the translation of the Chinese and Greek texts, okay? Bye.
{121073}{121135}Are you a good judge of character? 
{121140}{121202}- I think so. - Yeah?
{121211}{121256}So let's see. 
{121261}{121349}They're from newspapers. So picture number two.
{121364}{121418}- Who do you think that is? - Thanks.
{121428}{121472}- Picture number? - Two.
{121477}{121575}Two. Well, he's obviously a thief. 
{121580}{121659}No, murder victim. 
{121664}{121718}So now... 
{121784}{121860}Yeah. Picture number nine. 
{121870}{121942}- Policewoman? - Yeah.
{121947}{122008}Policewoman it is. Now, your turn.
{122013}{122063}Have you already looked? 
{122069}{122114}Just a little. 
{122135}{122192}Picture number seven? 
{122198}{122273}I would say a judge. 
{122278}{122311}- No. - No?
{122316}{122355}Murderer. 
{122376}{122434}Number 10? 
{122520}{122563}- A thief? - Right.
{122598}{122719}Well, that means half the people we meet we get wrong.
{122752}{122788}Yeah. 
{122804}{122850}Yeah, exactly. 
{122988}{123037}What is it? 
{123042}{123086}Your wrist. 
{123091}{123152}I always look at a man's wrist... 
{123157}{123294}...or the side of his face, or his ankle. The vulnerable parts.
{123322}{123406}You know, all intelligent people can fake modesty...
{123411}{123515}...but you really are modest. 
{123533}{123573}So... 
{123591}{123659}...I can walk from here. 
{124283}{124340}I'm sorry. 
{124397}{124503}You don't have to apologize. I have no illusions.
{124536}{124609}You think I'm worried about you? 
{124742}{124806}We can't do this. 
{124831}{124920}It would be really bad for us to take a step further.
{125420}{125492}I feel like a child standing on the edge of the sea...
{125501}{125578}...in my sad yellow raincoat. 
{125584}{125668}And you're telling me not to get wet.
{125811}{125902}I want you to promise me you will be careful.
{125938}{125976}Yes. 
{125995}{126019}And you. 
{126321}{126362}Yolanda. 
{126543}{126594}Your wife called to see when you're back.
{126599}{126650}I said you were on your way home. 
{126655}{126696}Still no word on the doctor? 
{126701}{126745}We're checking the prescriptions. 
{126749}{126802}Going back seven years will take time. 
{126806}{126868}By the way, she was a dermatologist. 
{126881}{126913}- Sir? - Y es?
{126918}{126982}Those translations from the Chinese Embassy.
{126987}{127032}Thank you. 
{127482}{127522}Sir? 
{127607}{127646}Those Chinese words... 
{127652}{127758}...they're formulas for mixing fireworks into different colors.
{127807}{127888}- State of Siege, did you watch it, sir? - Y eah.
{127893}{127930}Most of it. 
{127935}{127982}I left the tape at the office. 
{127988}{128099}Of course, the terrorists are all very handsome French actors with scarves...
{128104}{128183}...while the policemen looked like the inside of a butt.
{128188}{128230}Sir! 
{128244}{128311}They don't have the ceviche or the Guadalajara dog.
{128315}{128395}Then I'll have a black bean burrito. 
{128408}{128479}They don't have that either. 
{128522}{128633}Who cares?! Just go order something.
{128714}{128779}Can't even get a fucking hot dog! 
{128849}{128940}There are only two things left in this country that work, Tomcat.
{128945}{128992}Ezequiel... 
{128997}{129067}...and the women's volleyball team. 
{129073}{129143}Your latest orders from the palace. 
{129148}{129220}The reward has gone up to 10 million. 
{129226}{129330}Whoever captures Ezequiel, turns him over to Calderon...
{129335}{129385}...and keeps it a secret. 
{129390}{129462}- What's that mean? - lt means they will shoot him.
{129506}{129613}It's a pity he had to bring in all this murder and philosophy.
{129619}{129723}It was perfectly understandable without that horseshit.
{129945}{130000}The body of a woman found in Parque Colon...
{130005}{130073}...is believed to be that of former model Paulita Kellner.
{130078}{130148}A military spokesman denies responsibility.
{130159}{130253}For the first time, the government is...
{130598}{130651}My face is cracking. 
{130673}{130778}No darling, you mustn't speak. Give it time to set.
{130784}{130888}Now you both listen to my speech. Oh, Agustin, it's so exciting.
{130894}{130958}We're going to make thousands of dollars in weeks.
{130963}{131035}- It's the Sally Fay promise. - Sure, I will listen.
{131041}{131074}We may win a Cadillac. 
{131160}{131250}- Here it goes then. You guys listen. - Sure.
{131256}{131385}Strategy is Sally Fay's revolutionary skin care for the older woman.
{131391}{131460}This new alpha-hydroxide serum... 
{131466}{131549}...will combat your skin fatigue and sensitivity...
{131554}{131647}...what the Greeks call 'psora,' or itching.
{131652}{131711}It will make your fine lines disappear... 
{131716}{131777}...and your face look 10 years younger overnight-- 
{131782}{131815}Let me see that manual. 
{132022}{132073}Daddy, look. 
{132079}{132109}- Daddy? - What?
{132114}{132171}- What's that? - I've asked everyone to come over...
{132176}{132282}...tomorrow without their makeup on so I can confirm their skin types.
{132288}{132371}Okay, honey, it's ready to come off. Come here.
{132828}{132883}- Let me know if you need anything. - Thank you.
{132910}{132948}Again. 
{133175}{133236}Can you turn down the sound, please? 
{133278}{133370}- Can we go back to the beginning? - Okay.
{133496}{133560}Is that really him? 
{133622}{133694}- Who's that? - That's Edith Pusanga.
{133700}{133787}And again. Forward. 
{133796}{133875}Wait. Okay. Could you clarify that part? 
{133881}{133930}Could you make it larger? 
{133947}{133984}Now, stop. Stop. Stop. There. 
{133990}{134059}How can we find out what that says? 
{134079}{134127}Is it a painting? 
{134132}{134165}No. 
{134170}{134247}- A window, could it be? - Could we blow up those letters?
{134253}{134282}More. 
{134287}{134334}An advertisement, maybe. 
{134339}{134401}No, flip it. 
{134501}{134534}No. 
{134553}{134593}It's a street sign. 
{134720}{134784}I keep thinking Eros. 
{134788}{134813}Eros. 
{134819}{134899}- Are you telling the Fisherman? - Not yet.
{134905}{134982}Can I widen the search, look outside the capital?
{134987}{135046}No, he's here. 
{135051}{135094}He's here. 
{135177}{135252}Calderon's people rang twice. 
{135263}{135363}They want to know why we contacted the Chinese Embassy.
{135459}{135548}If you drew a map... 
{135553}{135624}...of everywhere you've ever been... 
{135630}{135710}...they say you draw your own face. 
{135746}{135788}Where? 
{135819}{135878}Where are you? 
{135902}{135941}Yeah? 
{135968}{136012}Give me the pen and the paper. 
{136017}{136055}Hello? 
{136073}{136166}Yes, I know Calle Peron, but it winds through half the city.
{136171}{136230}What about others? 
{136245}{136332}Wait a minute, just one other? 
{136392}{136456}In Sucros? 
{136483}{136545}Calle Diderot? 
{137586}{137663}You're a breath of fresh air. 
{137679}{137724}After three weeks of sifting trash... 
{137729}{137819}...I feel like I need a year in the scrub-atorium.
{137886}{137966}We finished combing through yesterday's refuse in Calle Peron.
{137971}{138019}Dirty work, diplomacy. 
{138034}{138089}740 garbage bags... 
{138094}{138154}...most of them filled with duck a la-fucking-orange.
{138160}{138202}Cigarettes? 
{138232}{138328}Marlboro, Marlboro Lights, Winston, Dunhill, Benson & Hedges...
{138333}{138417}...Jockey Club, Lucky Strike, Virginia Slims Menthol, Gauloises.
{138422}{138486}Not a single unfiltered Camel. 
{138491}{138553}What about medicines? 
{138576}{138663}Xanax for panic attacks, Prozac for clinical depression...
{138668}{138761}...Iithium for manic depression, X for psychotic depression...
{138766}{138854}...Maalox for stomach acid, estrogen supplements for menopause...
{138859}{138929}...yards of dental floss... 
{138934}{139000}...and I would calculate enough used rubbers to fill...
{139005}{139079}...the Chinese ambassador's swimming pool.
{139084}{139182}I really hope people in the street have cleaner minds.
{139187}{139244}No dithranol, no Kenacort? 
{139249}{139292}Nothing for the treatment of eczema...
{139297}{139365}...acne vulgaris or any other skin condition.
{139379}{139417}I've been in Miami. 
{139422}{139481}I know the heartbreak of psoriasis. 
{139593}{139702}Sir? What color were the flares the night of the Cafe Haiti bomb?
{139707}{139800}- Red. - The Fisherman was right.
{139805}{139865}Some enormous piece of shit is going on.
{139870}{139935}Last night, they caught a girl near the water plant...
{139940}{139978}...with a bottle on her... 
{139984}{140066}...and my friend in the lab says it was full of typhus.
{140140}{140212}He thinks he's won. The whole country's about to fall...
{140218}{140278}...but for the first time I can sense him.
{140282}{140344}You don't want us to tell Calderon? 
{140354}{140446}He would supply us with enough men to search every house.
{140451}{140531}Do you know how long it takes a sequoia seed to germinate?
{140536}{140590}About 10 years. 
{140595}{140672}Ten years. No different to farming or fishing.
{140677}{140725}- I know, sir, but-- - The trick...
{140730}{140798}...is knowing when to be impatient. 
{140809}{140859}We're almost there, but not quite. 
{140864}{140942}He's either here or in Calle Peron. 
{141103}{141167}Should I start collecting now? 
{141229}{141289}No. In a minute. 
{141344}{141425}- What was that? - Sounds like a dog at a dumpster.
{141597}{141651}Hey. 
{141659}{141724}Who put the pubes on my coke can? 
{141757}{141811}That's got a nice little walk on it. 
{141832}{141882}Who is she? 
{141887}{141960}- She teaches ballet. - How do you know?
{141966}{142027}My daughter goes there. 
{142041}{142133}- Single, is she, sir? - That's right.
{142139}{142186}Well, she's waiting for someone. 
{142530}{142617}- You can start collecting. - What are you doing?
{142622}{142669}What? 
{142674}{142793}Oh, yeah. I hate my Beretta showing when I'm trying out a pirouette.
{142817}{142864}Hush. 
{143020}{143084}Hush, hush, hush. 
{145308}{145361}Happy birthday. 
{145557}{145625}I'll leave the slipper in the door. 
{146782}{146874}I love garbage. I can be around it always. 
{146879}{146912}Calle Peron's finished. 
{146917}{147021}Nothing of any interest except maybe this.
{147026}{147099}Marxism Today, property of the Cuban press attache.
{147104}{147160}- Okay? - What about Diderot?
{147165}{147226}We' re halfway through Diderot. 
{147231}{147300}We should be through by 5:00. 
{147305}{147356}Anything? 
{147373}{147425}Nothing to give you goose pimples. 
{147431}{147478}And Gomez? 
{147506}{147566}Problem with the maid in 332. 
{147571}{147645}Her employer likes to plant his own geraniums.
{147650}{147710}So today, Gomez is whitewashing trees instead.
{147715}{147786}Soon everyone will want to move in. 
{147905}{148000}That gives you plenty of time. Yes, good luck.
{148005}{148062}Yes, I thought the way you said it was fine.
{148067}{148110}Sir, I think you should come. 
{148115}{148239}I have-- I have to go. I'll talk to you later. Bye.
{148523}{148578}Dithranol. 
{148585}{148668}For the treatment of eczema and psoriasis.
{148697}{148768}Keep away from children.  
{148784}{148877}But they're not Camels. And they're filtered.
{148973}{149009}Which house? 
{149385}{149475}The class began on time? How many? Fourteen.
{149481}{149548}No, no, no, just go-- Just go on painting those trees.
{149562}{149629}- Should we warn the teacher? - No. That'll create panic...
{149635}{149699}...and alert Ezequiel above. Find who the landlord is...
{149705}{149804}...and if there's a ground plan. Move our men at Calle Peron to Calle Diderot.
{149809}{149865}And concentrate on any movement upstairs.
{149870}{149926}And keep out of sight. 
{150025}{150130}This is the captain. I can't speak to you individually, but I want you to listen.
{150136}{150204}I've been inside the house. It's divided in two.
{150209}{150253}Downstairs is the ballet studio. 
{150259}{150356}Suspect may be in upstairs apartment. There's no access from the studio.
{150362}{150423}The ballet mistress doesn't know who lives upstairs.
{150429}{150507}Probably our suspect relies on the staircase at the back.
{150513}{150567}Once you're over-- Once you're over the wall...
{150572}{150663}...you're not to fire unless you're fired on first.
{150669}{150728}Is that clear? There 's a dance class in there.
{150733}{150790}We wait until the class is out. 
{151257}{151296}- Captain Rejas? - Y es.
{151302}{151367}Meeting broke up minutes ago. He 's watching television.
{151372}{151427}- Who else is with him? - Three others.
{151432}{151497}- They are resting in a back room. - The dance class?
{151502}{151557}It was fine, sir. 
{151562}{151634}We wait until all the mothers have left. 
{151639}{151715}- Is that clear? - Got it, sir.
{152773}{152814}Here they come. 
{153612}{153661}Oh, God, she's going back inside. 
{153705}{153766}Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
{154063}{154094}Come on. 
{154253}{154301}Come on. 
{154437}{154484}Bye. 
{154599}{154651}Get on with it! 
{154892}{154942}Look, sir, upstairs. 
{155004}{155053}That's him, isn't it? 
{157926}{157980}Men in position. 
{158046}{158131}Sir? Men in position. 
{158404}{158473}We are ready to go. 
{158550}{158618}This is the captain. You can go in. 
{159603}{159651}Well? 
{159777}{159805}It's him. 
{160299}{160344}Stand up before the captain. 
{160707}{160778}Professor Edgardo Rivas. 
{160819}{160900}Captain Rejas, Anti-T errorist Police. 
{160906}{160951}We've met before. 
{160993}{161092}You'll never kill this. 
{161133}{161202}- How many others? - Four.
{161208}{161309}It doesn't matter if you shoot us. We are in history.
{161367}{161437}We are not going to shoot anyone. 
{161527}{161621}Find him a sensible pair of shoes... 
{161633}{161689}...and take him outside. 
{161864}{161920}Yes, sir. 
{162125}{162149}What are you doing? 
{162155}{162189}Let her go! 
{162261}{162289}Okay, calm down. 
{162294}{162328}Those bastards! 
{162333}{162445}Don't worry, calm down. 
{162451}{162497}Calm down. 
{162503}{162565}It's okay. Thank God, you're safe.
{162591}{162657}You don't know who we've got upstairs.
{163094}{163165}What's going on? 
{163370}{163412}What's going on? 
{163448}{163495}Don't be frightened. 
{163518}{163564}These are my men. 
{163669}{163729}Don't you dare harm him. 
{163734}{163805}You'll pay with your life if you harm him.
{163862}{163912}Yolanda? 
{165487}{165516}Is Yolanda with you? 
{165646}{165718}Everyone's with us, captain. 
{166059}{166131}Fourth flame of Communism... 
{166189}{166272}He's just a big, fat man in a cardigan.
{166559}{166598}Sir? 
{166620}{166709}It could be really dangerous if you don't ring Calderon.
{166731}{166799}Yes, it could be. 
{167085}{167124}Cecilia? 
{167151}{167233}Do you have that list of the press attaches?
{167242}{167276}And now, breaking news. 
{167281}{167336}Late last night in a residential district...
{167341}{167436}... terrorist leader Ezequiel was captured along with several accomplices.
{167441}{167496}- Where is the ballerina? - No more questions.
{167500}{167584}- I haven 't finished the interrogation. - Captain Agustin Rejas...
{167588}{167675}- ... declined to comment on the details. - If you 're not...
{167681}{167764}... busy next election, I have a job for you.
{167769}{167812}The palace has refused comment... 
{167817}{167892}...and the whereabouts of Ezequiel at present are unknown.
{167897}{167992}Rejas did confirm that Ezequiel's real name is Edgardo Rodriguez Rivas...
{167996}{168067}...and that he was taken into custody without incident.
{168073}{168134}When will she come around? 
{168139}{168259}Half an hour, maybe. I gave her another shot at 6.
{168500}{168583}She didn't understand what was going on.
{168666}{168718}You' re wrong, boss. 
{168911}{168958}Are you Rejas? 
{169021}{169137}Orders from the palace. The prisoners are no longer under your authority.
{169162}{169246}Okay! Get them out!
{169339}{169425}Professor Edgardo Rivas, you' re coming with us.
{169430}{169533}With infinite pleasure, comrade. 
{169584}{169666}Ten days after the dramatic capture of guerilla leader Ezequiel...
{169671}{169731}... the political repercussions are being felt.
{169737}{169838}Yesterday, a delegation of senators called on Police Captain Agustin Rejas...
{169843}{169889}... to run for president. 
{169895}{169961}His enormous popularity could unify the opposition...
{169965}{170008}...and threaten the ruling party. 
{170031}{170125}Thanks to the efforts of one honest man, our country can now breathe easily...
{170131}{170183}... for the first time in a decade. 
{170188}{170281}Meanwhile, the most notorious terrorist in the Western Hemisphere...
{170285}{170389}...began a new life on the island prison of San Lorenzo.
{170471}{170576}A military court today sentenced former ballerina, Yolanda Celandin.
{170581}{170636}As Comrade Isabel, she is believed...
{170640}{170704}... to have run the section of operative support.
{170708}{170746}The most damning evidence... 
{170750}{170847}...a mention in her notebook of the cafe destroyed by the Miraflores bomb.
{170852}{170933}Passing sentence, the judge agreed to a symbolic punishment...
{170937}{171036}...in addition to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
{171060}{171110}Will you stand? 
{171257}{171355}You will be condemned to a cell without light.
{171636}{171673}Viva El Presidente Ezequiel. 
{172620}{172690}You wanted to talk about a deal.
{172709}{172756}So, what's the deal? 
{172762}{172810}It's about Y olanda Celandin. 
{172858}{172886}What about her? 
{172892}{172966}I want to address three terms of her imprisonment.
{172999}{173025}Which terms? 
{173030}{173128}First, I would like her to be allowed blankets, books...
{173134}{173186}...and writing material. 
{173204}{173228}And? 
{173234}{173359}Second, I insist that she be moved to a cell with light.
{173469}{173522}I want to be clear on this. 
{173527}{173596}If we meet these conditions, you'll give your word...
{173602}{173686}...you won't run against the president in the next election?
{173705}{173758}In the next election. 
{173801}{173837}No. 
{173918}{173977}Let me tell you right off, this is impossible.
{173981}{174034}Your demands are preposterous. Besides...
{174039}{174096}...they contravene the due process of law.
{174115}{174217}But let us imagine a situation in which they could be met.
{174222}{174280}We would need reassurances. 
{174286}{174384}You would have to give your public support to the government.
{174430}{174511}The president is much maligned, but he sees the bigger picture.
{174515}{174571}Despite the fact you disobeyed his orders...
{174575}{174657}...he remains anxious to show the nation's gratitude.
{174667}{174749}I know he would like to offer you a judgeship.
{174802}{174901}This could be announced at a press conference. The sooner the better.
{174963}{175021}And the third condition? 
{175051}{175128}A quiet release after five years. 
{175303}{175385}That would not be mentioned at the press conference.
{175605}{175645}By the way... 
{175650}{175715}...she already had writing material.
{175720}{175798}This came back with the blankets you sent her.
{175895}{175963}She's only a young woman, Rejas. 
{175968}{176032}Seventy-two percent water. 
{176036}{176102}Yet, you could have been president. 
{177111}{177198}Do not contact me. Do not try to help.
{177207}{177241}I am dead. 
{177247}{177303}I live only for the revolution. 
{177310}{177344}Enough. 
{178303}{178403}Let's see what we can do with this lovely, lovely thing...
{178408}{178529}... that goes past all racial conflict... 
{178534}{178630}...and all kinds of conflict. 
{178635}{178721}It is a reflective tune... 
{178727}{178791}...and some time in your life... 
{178795}{178930}... you will have occasion to say, What is this thing called time?
{178935}{178991}You know, what is that? 
{178996}{179027}The clock. 
{179032}{179085}You go to work by the clock... 
{179090}{179185}... you get your martini in the afternoon by the clock...
{179190}{179257}...and you get your coffee by the clock...
{179262}{179363}...and you have to get on the plane at a certain time, arrive at a certain...
{179367}{179446}And it goes on and on and on. 
{179451}{179574}And time is a dictator, as we know.
{179579}{179624}- Where does it go? - Laura Rejas?
{179630}{179728}What does it do? Most of all, is it alive?
{179733}{179806}Is it a thing that we cannot touch? And is it alive?
{179811}{179856}And then one day you look in the mirror.
{179861}{179934}- Brought your own music? - ""How old. ""
{179940}{180031}And you say, Where did the time go?
{180035}{180119}We'll leave you with that one.
