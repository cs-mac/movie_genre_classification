2
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:03,633
- Have you got a light?
- No.

3
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:07,188
Fantastic. I want to stop smoking anyway.

4
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:10,230
- Please buy me a drink
- No.

5
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:13,095
I don't need cigarettes or drinks.

6
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:16,604
You don't want cigarettes
or nothing to drink?

7
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:21,841
No, you can get those things anywhere.
All I need is a boyfriend.

8
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:23,297
Is that so?

9
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:34,685
Right.

10
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:36,291
What's next?

11
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:21,578
Oh, you.

12
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,145
Oh, this is so good,
but wouldn't it be even better at home?

13
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:31,270
No, I'm just visiting.
We can't do it where I'm staying.

14
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,353
You can come back to my place.
It's small, but I can do as I please.

15
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:39,422
- That would be great. Where do you live?
- It's not far. It's near Bahía Baja.

16
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:43,134
That doesn't mean anything to me.
I don't know this area.

17
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:45,936
- I only arrived three days ago.
- Oh, did you?

18
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:49,744
- Will you show me the way?
- I've got a better idea.

19
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:53,495
- I'll drive you to my place.
- Please do.

20
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,103
- Fine.
- Can you get past?

21
00:04:55,203 --> 00:04:57,769
Yes. It's rather cramped in here.

22
00:04:57,869 --> 00:04:59,894
- Oh, wow!
- What?

23
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:04,145
- You're very well-built.
- That was just the gear stick.

24
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:06,827
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

25
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,394
Let's see if I can get used to your stick.
It is yours, isn't it?

26
00:05:13,494 --> 00:05:15,160
Well, yes.

27
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:42,602
Stop that, darling. I'm not insured
against accidents, you know.

28
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:45,864
- All right.
- Postponed is not abandoned.

29
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,073
You can get out now. We're there.

30
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:13,326
- Tell me, is this really your place?
- Yes.

31
00:06:13,426 --> 00:06:15,768
- I'll be damned!
- It's small, but it's mine.

32
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:18,768
If you call this small,
you must be pretty spoilt.

33
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:21,251
I prefer quality to quantity.

34
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:30,321
Good evening, mademoiselle.

35
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:33,166
- Good day, Sarah. ls everything OK?
- Everything's fine.

36
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:34,590
- Hello.
- Monsieur.

37
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:39,272
- Not bad.
- What?

38
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:40,701
Your little place.

39
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:05,951
Mademoiselle.

40
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:09,851
Thanks, Sarah.
A sip of champagne is all that's missing.

41
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,507
Thank you.

42
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:12,951
Cheers.

43
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:19,826
- Or would you like to eat something?
- No, this will do, thanks.

44
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:52,590
Mademoiselle.

45
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:55,272
We're ready.

46
00:07:57,158 --> 00:07:58,285
Cheeky monkey!

47
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:02,956
- You may undress me now, Sarah.
- Yes, mademoiselle.

48
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:13,038
Take it off.

49
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:21,659
And my knickers as well.

50
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:47,326
No, not the stockings. As a lady,
I have to keep some sense of decency.

51
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:48,258
Yes, mademoiselle.

52
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:52,576
Now the gentleman.
But take off his socks.

53
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:53,507
Yes, mademoiselle.

54
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:59,028
Would you get up so that I
can undress you, please?

55
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:38,541
Hello.

56
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:05,152
But wait.

57
00:11:25,113 --> 00:11:26,399
This bloody glass!

58
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:57,221
You like that, don't you?
You're in for something even better.

59
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,234
Stay right here.
I'll be back in a minute.

60
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,044
Edna!

61
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:35,429
Edna. At last you're back.

62
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,928
Where have you been all this time?
I'm at the end of my tether.

63
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:42,045
- I need you. I need you.
- I'm with you now. Calm down.

64
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:46,726
What a horny thing you are!

65
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:49,239
You haven't brought a man!
You're alone!

66
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:55,124
Just wait, Sis. A really well-built guy is
in the lounge, waiting to make you happy.

67
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,303
Release my arms.
Bring him here. I'll be good.

68
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,359
OK.

69
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:02,271
All right.

70
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,611
There you go.

71
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:13,190
Calm down.
That guy will be with you in no time.

72
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,165
I need him.

73
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:19,091
But promise me that you'll be sensible,
despite your sensuality.

74
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,011
I'll promise anything,
as long as you stay

75
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:25,690
You must watch, like you always do.

76
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,094
Watch me, the way I used to
watch you as a child. Please!

77
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:30,686
You must promise to watch us.

78
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:34,130
I like it best that way.
Will you? Yes?

79
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:37,773
You enjoy it too, don't you?
Go...get him.

80
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,164
You can come upstairs now.

81
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:57,394
Here I am.

82
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:00,400
Come here,

83
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:02,219
I need you.

84
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:07,019
- Come to me.
- What do you want?

85
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:10,024
You know what I want.

86
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:14,135
- And who are you?
- Edna's sister, Milly.

87
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:15,387
Where is Edna?

88
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:18,394
What does that matter right now?

89
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,964
Come here. Come to me.

90
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:24,034
I need you. Kiss me.

91
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:28,044
Kiss me.

92
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,874
I can't stand it any longer.

93
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:20,361
Yes. Yes. Yes!

94
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:40,210
Don't stop. Carry on.

95
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,567
Oh, yes!

96
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,832
- Is it good?
- Yes.

97
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,840
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

98
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:36,687
Now it's my turn.

99
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:53,137
Yes.

100
00:16:58,506 --> 00:16:59,687
Wonderful!

101
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:04,063
- Do you want more?
- Yes.

102
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,125
I'm going crazy.

103
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,661
Lie down.

104
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:10,373
Yes.

105
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,824
I can hardly bear it.

106
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:46,342
Can you go on?

107
00:18:46,422 --> 00:18:47,168
Yes.

108
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:11,310
- Come on, lie down now.
- I'll do anything you want.

109
00:19:28,105 --> 00:19:29,101
Oh, stop.

110
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:42,094
Wow!

111
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:28,125
Are you awake?

112
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:35,586
I wanted to tell you,
and please don't laugh,

113
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:40,215
You're the first person...
who has ever satisfied me.

114
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:44,300
And I think I love you.

115
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:09,307
Was it all... a dream?

116
00:22:41,363 --> 00:22:43,350
Good morning, Milly.
Did you sleep well?

117
00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:45,700
Yes, thank you.
What time is it?

118
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,044
It's past ten o'clock.
I let you have a lie-in.

119
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,966
But now it's time to take your medicine.

120
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,375
Dr Barrios should be here any minute now.

121
00:22:56,185 --> 00:22:59,634
He'll tell me off if he finds out
how late you were given it.

122
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:00,233
Thank you.

123
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,233
- He can be quite pedantic.
- I know.

124
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:06,650
But he's a handsome man, isn't he?

125
00:23:08,018 --> 00:23:09,682
I don't like Dr Barrios.

126
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:10,595
Don't you?

127
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:14,558
I think he is particularly
fond of you, though.

128
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:17,711
And you're greatly indebted to him.

129
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,450
A famous specialist like him
doesn't need to see you this often.

130
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:24,294
He goes to a lot of trouble for your sake.

131
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:27,639
I'm sorry. You're right, of course.

132
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:29,457
The main thing is that you realise it.

133
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:31,571
And now, it's time for your injection.

134
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,347
- Turn towards me, please
- OK.

135
00:23:51,726 --> 00:23:53,386
- Did it hurt?
- No.

136
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,808
Hello, Dr Barrios.

137
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,276
Good day, Sarah.

138
00:24:58,016 --> 00:24:59,675
- Where is she?
- In her room.

139
00:25:00,773 --> 00:25:03,148
- And Edna?
- Mademoiselle is still in bed.

140
00:25:04,975 --> 00:25:06,204
- Don't wake her up.
- All right.

141
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:21,683
Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town

142
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:25,433
With his big willy under his gown

143
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:28,417
- Good morning, Milly.
- Good morning, Doctor.

144
00:25:28,516 --> 00:25:32,127
- Is your willy as big as Willie's?
- No, but it serves its purpose.

145
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:33,279
Turn over, please.

146
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,166
It doesn't satisfy me, though.

147
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:38,745
We'll see about that.
Keep still.

148
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:42,960
Hey, that hurts!
Long and thin, a woman won't grin.

149
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,332
I see that you're in a good mood.

150
00:25:45,432 --> 00:25:49,457
- You must be feeling better today.
- Despite your willy, I feel fulfilled.

151
00:25:49,557 --> 00:25:52,228
More fulfilled than ever before.
I've had other men...

152
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:54,095
but never one like him.

153
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:58,470
Last night I was made happy,
with true passion.

154
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,561
I feel that life is worth living now.

155
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:04,468
I don't usually see them again,

156
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:06,787
but maybe Edna will allow
this one to come back.

157
00:26:09,557 --> 00:26:10,556
Well?

158
00:26:12,724 --> 00:26:13,625
Not bad.

159
00:26:15,024 --> 00:26:17,118
- I'm pleased to hear that.
- So am I.

160
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,726
Nurse Maria,

161
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:22,102
it might be a good idea if you took
Milly for a swim in the sea today.

162
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:23,591
That would be wonderful.

163
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:26,880
I haven't left this room for six months.
You're a kind man.

164
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,217
You flatter me.

165
00:26:29,057 --> 00:26:30,260
But no longer than an hour.

166
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,642
If it was half as long,
I'd be just as happy. Goodbye.

167
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:34,523
Bye, Milly.

168
00:26:34,603 --> 00:26:36,749
- Would you come with me for a moment?
- Yes, doctor.

169
00:26:54,771 --> 00:26:59,165
- We have something important to discuss
- What's the matter, Charles?

170
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,647
You like Milly a lot, don't you?

171
00:27:01,727 --> 00:27:04,395
- Yes, but...
- Milly is very sick.

172
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,643
She's a nymphomaniac,
and now she's having hallucinations.

173
00:27:07,723 --> 00:27:11,777
Like that man she claims was here.
That's how paranoid schizophrenia starts.

174
00:27:11,857 --> 00:27:14,415
We must start using new, stronger drugs.

175
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:19,726
I will start a new treatment today.
Inject her with this from now on.

176
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,635
This box contains 24 ampoules,
enough for four days.

177
00:27:22,895 --> 00:27:25,010
We must observe how she
reacts to this, understood?

178
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:27,540
You must keep an eye on her at all times.

179
00:27:28,091 --> 00:27:30,427
This will make Milly sleep even better.

180
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:32,563
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

181
00:27:32,643 --> 00:27:34,588
- You know what this stuff is like.
- Maria, trust me.

182
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:37,820
We are both trying to help Milly.

183
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,039
You must cooperate, as agreed, Maria.

184
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:41,385
Yes, but...

185
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,941
- I have to go and see a patient now

186
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:53,806
- Charles?
- Yes?

187
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,760
- I apologise.
- It's all right.

188
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:57,975
Don't worry, it will be fine.

189
00:27:58,055 --> 00:28:02,176
I know, that's why I'm apologising.
You know you can rely on me.

190
00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:05,347
- When will I see you again?
- I'm afraid I don't know.

191
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,404
You know how busy I am at the moment,

192
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:11,403
but I'm sure it will be soon.
I'll come over on Thursday in any case.

193
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:12,701
Call me if anything happens.

194
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:13,861
Certainly.

195
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,410
See you soon.

196
00:28:18,888 --> 00:28:19,578
Ciao.

197
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,648
Is anything wrong?

198
00:28:29,923 --> 00:28:32,230
Why would anything be wrong?

199
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,602
It's time for your injection.

200
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:43,165
Oh, right, the injection.

201
00:28:50,555 --> 00:28:53,763
- It's so cold!
- I don't think it is.

202
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:10,430
Hold on to me.

203
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:12,806
Come on, let's get back into the water.

204
00:29:15,197 --> 00:29:17,366
- Are you enjoying it?
- Very much so.

205
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:22,388
Be careful. No.

206
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:33,971
- I've swallowed some water.
- It's good for you.

207
00:29:34,054 --> 00:29:36,544
You can talk, you cow!

208
00:29:38,887 --> 00:29:40,508
Just you wait!

209
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,096
No, no!

210
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:48,220
Please stop now.
I'd like to get out. I'd like to sunbathe.

211
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,258
- Are you staying here?
- No, I'll come.

212
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:53,345
- Oh, I love the sea.
- So do I.

213
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:56,887
- I want to go swimming every day.
- That's up to Dr Barrios.

214
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,262
- Convince him that exercise does us good.
- I'll talk to him.

215
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:03,845
- Thank you. What would I do without you?
- You're welcome.

216
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:10,722
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

217
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:17,303
Stop laughing, dammit!

218
00:30:28,678 --> 00:30:31,215
- Don't trip, Maria.
- I won't.

219
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:34,878
I nearly did.

220
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:39,553
Isn't this a wonderful day?

221
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:44,053
Your skin is exceptionally beautiful.
You're going to get sunburnt.

222
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:46,261
Didn't you bring any suntan oil?

223
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,803
You have porcelain skin,
but it can't take the sun.

224
00:30:49,886 --> 00:30:54,428
Let me do it. I'd like to pamper you
a bit, in honour of the occasion.

225
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:14,428
- Maria, you're a good person.
- Quiet now.

226
00:33:17,384 --> 00:33:18,884
Maria?

227
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:25,485
You are so dear to me.

228
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:49,216
Maria. Oh, Maria!

229
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:56,833
Wake up, Milly!

230
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:59,408
You've woken the whole
house with your screams.

231
00:33:59,592 --> 00:34:01,815
You've had another bad dream, haven't you?

232
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:05,447
It's over now.

233
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:08,084
I'd like to go swimming again one day.

234
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:10,034
You're not allowed to swim, child.

235
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:15,133
- Didn't we swim in the sea today?
- What makes you think we did?

236
00:34:15,216 --> 00:34:17,195
So it was only a dream after all.

237
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:18,983
Good night, Maria.

238
00:34:19,175 --> 00:34:20,626
Good night. Sleep well.

239
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:25,019
- You can go to bed. You deserve it.
- Thank you. Good night.

240
00:34:25,924 --> 00:34:26,800
Edna?

241
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:31,531
I'd like to ask you something,
and I want an honest answer.

242
00:34:31,674 --> 00:34:33,492
Please tell me the truth.

243
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,712
Am I insane?

244
00:34:35,382 --> 00:34:37,492
I think you're much better.

245
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,886
That's not what the doctor told Maria.

246
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:44,049
He said that I was on the verge
of...paranoid schizophrenia.

247
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:47,182
What an idiot!
Why did you have to hear that nonsense?

248
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:51,158
We'll have a chat tomorrow,
but right now you need to rest.

249
00:35:14,424 --> 00:35:16,810
- Good night, little one.
- Good night.

250
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:42,502
- Hey! Hey, don't run away, little girl
- No!

251
00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:44,270
No!

252
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:51,098
Hey, you.

253
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:57,213
- I've got you now, you hussy
- Yes.

254
00:37:07,297 --> 00:37:13,501
- Ouch! You bit me, you minx!
- That's my temperament. Kiss me.

255
00:38:26,218 --> 00:38:28,796
No, no, I can't go on.

256
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:31,122
No!

257
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,632
Sarah, come in.
How are you?

258
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:37,154
Is Milly asleep?

259
00:38:37,343 --> 00:38:38,529
Yes, fast asleep.

260
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:41,337
- Come to me.
- Yes mademoiselle, I'm coming.

261
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,360
- I love being with you.
- Stop talking so much and get undressed.

262
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,554
Hurry up...

263
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,517
Mademoiselle, you look lovely.

264
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:10,180
Oh, this is wonderful.

265
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,883
I want to have a go now. Lie back.

266
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,590
Yes.

267
00:40:09,627 --> 00:40:10,900
Edna?

268
00:40:11,716 --> 00:40:14,456
I want it too. Edna!

269
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:20,873
Don't be cruel. Let me join you. Please!

270
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:26,539
Edna! I beg you!

271
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,362
I'm going crazy.

272
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,380
- That's good.
- Carry on, mademoiselle.

273
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,581
Edna!

274
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:39,171
Please release me.
Edna, take pity on me.

275
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:39,809
Yes.

276
00:40:45,015 --> 00:40:46,534
Help me.

277
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:50,752
Please!

278
00:40:53,341 --> 00:40:54,847
Oh, my body's on fire.

279
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,909
I can't bear it any longer.

280
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:05,740
I need help.

281
00:41:07,418 --> 00:41:09,793
Help! Who will help me?

282
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:12,771
Milly, I will help you as best I can.

283
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:14,533
Yes, please do.

284
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:18,140
Help me, Maria.

285
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:21,882
Please.

286
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,126
Please!

287
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:43,417
I don't have a man to offer you,

288
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,833
but perhaps this will help you.

289
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:53,664
I don't care what it is.
I don't care at all, Maria.

290
00:41:54,584 --> 00:41:56,059
You've got to save me.

291
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:59,759
Come...or I'll die.

292
00:42:01,282 --> 00:42:03,975
Come...yes.

293
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,334
- Christina!
- I'm here.

294
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:15,344
- What's taking you so long?
- I'm on my way.

295
00:42:23,294 --> 00:42:25,480
Are you looking for
something special, sir?

296
00:42:25,661 --> 00:42:28,291
Oh, I must have come to the wrong person.

297
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:31,461
At last.

298
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,753
Good evening, Countess.

299
00:42:51,378 --> 00:42:53,740
You haven't come here for a long time.

300
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:56,335
Yes, that's right.
Even though you're always here.

301
00:42:56,653 --> 00:42:59,293
Absolutely. Provided
I'm not busy, that is.

302
00:42:59,373 --> 00:43:01,256
So you're free right now?

303
00:43:01,336 --> 00:43:02,930
Would you like to be busy?

304
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,083
It would be a pleasure.

305
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,541
- How much would that cost?
- You've always been generous.

306
00:43:09,624 --> 00:43:12,754
- I pay for discretion.
- Well, then, pay.

307
00:43:32,575 --> 00:43:34,250
He's prepared to cooperate.

308
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:37,200
- Your sister's become rather pretty.
- That's not her.

309
00:43:37,738 --> 00:43:40,170
Milly's unwell.
I've never seen her like this

310
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,900
- I'd say that those injections...
- Quiet. That's nobody's business.

311
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,054
Oh, Sarah, the gentleman
would like to have a bath.

312
00:43:50,249 --> 00:43:51,555
Come with me, please.

313
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:54,780
Hang on, what's this all about? I'm clean.

314
00:43:56,998 --> 00:43:58,869
- That's her.
- Sounds like a lioness.

315
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:01,100
I've scrubbed him from
top to toe, mademoiselle.

316
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,049
Thanks, Sarah.

317
00:44:02,536 --> 00:44:03,993
I'll leave you alone with her now.

318
00:44:04,073 --> 00:44:05,877
Screw her until she's exhausted.

319
00:44:05,957 --> 00:44:10,748
- I am discreet and capable.
- Yeah, yeah, I got that. There you are.

320
00:44:10,832 --> 00:44:14,082
As generous as always.
I'll make a special effort for that.

321
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:15,152
I'd appreciate that.

322
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:16,452
Come, Sarah.

323
00:44:21,832 --> 00:44:23,233
Hello, lioness.

324
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,996
Let's see if I can tame you.

325
00:44:28,623 --> 00:44:30,837
You have screamed enough.

326
00:44:31,206 --> 00:44:35,498
- The Taming of the Shrew.
- No! You bastard, don't touch me!

327
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:38,914
- Leave me alone.
- Carry on just like this. It turns me on.

328
00:44:38,997 --> 00:44:43,827
- I beg you, please don't. You wretch!
- Spread your legs. Wider.

329
00:44:43,926 --> 00:44:46,556
- Don't do it!
- Lift your ass.

330
00:44:49,077 --> 00:44:50,209
You like it, don't you?

331
00:44:50,714 --> 00:44:51,715
Like old times.

332
00:44:54,254 --> 00:44:56,478
You like to be taken like that, don't you?

333
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:00,174
I can see that you love it, you pig.

334
00:45:06,749 --> 00:45:08,131
You can't get enough, huh?

335
00:45:13,216 --> 00:45:14,215
See.

336
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:47,215
Are you coming, baby?

337
00:46:01,881 --> 00:46:03,214
Please wait out there.

338
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:05,576
Excuse me.

339
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,233
The professor would like
to talk to you, Countess.

340
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:10,816
Thank you, just a second.

341
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:14,091
Sarah, would you take Milly home?
I'll be back in a little while.

342
00:46:24,422 --> 00:46:25,668
- Please.
- Thank you.

343
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:33,793
Your sister is an extraordinary case.

344
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:39,102
I would have liked to
examine her more closely.

345
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,498
An extremely interesting case.

346
00:46:42,254 --> 00:46:45,135
Unfortunately, I must
return to Prague tomorrow.

347
00:46:47,442 --> 00:46:50,304
You see, your sister is on
the verge of killing herself.

348
00:46:51,054 --> 00:46:52,667
What are you saying?

349
00:46:53,005 --> 00:46:58,431
Well, one might say that your sister
is seeking refuge in schizophrenia.

350
00:46:58,787 --> 00:47:01,808
She is making no effort
to resist it whatsoever.

351
00:47:01,888 --> 00:47:03,904
She wants her delusions.

352
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:08,700
She's trying to depersonalise,
to destroy her own ego.

353
00:47:08,963 --> 00:47:11,560
If she succeeds,
she'll have to be locked up.

354
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:13,466
That's a great responsibility.

355
00:47:13,546 --> 00:47:16,035
Once you've decided to do that,

356
00:47:16,322 --> 00:47:18,054
there will be no going back.

357
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:19,384
Pity.

358
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,334
She's charming...and intelligent.

359
00:47:22,897 --> 00:47:24,454
Please, how can I help Milly?

360
00:47:26,129 --> 00:47:29,385
All the answers I can give you
sound very banal...

361
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:31,216
no alcohol,

362
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,060
no cigarettes,

363
00:47:33,504 --> 00:47:38,616
no exposure to anything violent,
or anything which might shock her,

364
00:47:38,879 --> 00:47:40,543
no sexual contact,

365
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:43,493
as that would be very harmful.

366
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,991
And no masturbation. You must ensure that.

367
00:47:51,837 --> 00:47:55,450
I'll give her a prescription.
Go and get it from the pharmacy.

368
00:47:56,587 --> 00:48:00,450
It will delay the progression of the
illness by days or even months.

369
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:06,608
However...it will not
restore her lust for life.

370
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:08,733
That will require something else.

371
00:48:10,337 --> 00:48:13,017
This is the only effective medicine.

372
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:17,407
I would still like you to give me
a letter with your diagnosis.

373
00:48:18,879 --> 00:48:19,721
All right.

374
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,671
Only a little more information would
be needed for a precise diagnosis.

375
00:48:25,251 --> 00:48:27,374
I could make some helpful suggestions

376
00:48:28,629 --> 00:48:32,170
and explain my opinion from
the medical point of view.

377
00:48:32,512 --> 00:48:33,174
Yes,

378
00:48:34,218 --> 00:48:36,741
I would be able to write that down
for you, if that's what you want.

379
00:48:37,003 --> 00:48:38,527
Oh, yes, please do.

380
00:48:38,607 --> 00:48:42,132
You're the world's most
leading psychoanalyst.

381
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:45,563
Your expert opinion would be
incredibly important to the doctors here.

382
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:29,938
Oh, taxi!

383
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:46,490
To Bahía Baja, please.

384
00:50:00,002 --> 00:50:01,518
I'll gladly read it to you again.

385
00:50:01,762 --> 00:50:03,964
Now..."My last will and testament.

386
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:08,919
"In full possession of my mental
faculties, I, Hermann Wilhelm von Stein,

387
00:50:09,002 --> 00:50:13,422
"appoint, as sole heir to my assets,
my youngest daughter...

388
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:15,363
"Milly Antonie von Stein.

389
00:50:15,627 --> 00:50:19,447
"For the time being, my oldest daughter,
Edna Luise von Stein, is to manage them."

390
00:50:20,703 --> 00:50:23,340
Etc, etc, etc.

391
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:29,844
“On Milly's 21st birthday,
the assets will become her property.

392
00:50:30,732 --> 00:50:35,418
"In the eventuality of her death,
disability or mental illness, however,

393
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:38,587
“the entire assets will become the
property of my daughter, Edna

394
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:43,137
"who will be obliged to support her sister

395
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:48,846
"in the event of her disability
or mental illness, by any means possible."

396
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:52,558
Well, in a few days...

397
00:50:54,542 --> 00:50:56,304
in six days, to be precise,

398
00:50:57,335 --> 00:51:01,626
your sister will come into
possession of your current abode,

399
00:51:01,709 --> 00:51:07,988
your country house in Italy,
and bonds worth 12 million dollars.

400
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:15,343
I'm afraid that we must prevent
the execution of my father's last will.

401
00:51:15,834 --> 00:51:19,746
Why? What are your motives?
Why should we do something like that?

402
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:22,596
My sister is insane.

403
00:51:22,676 --> 00:51:24,838
What's written in the will has come true.

404
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:29,250
My father must have foreseen
that this might happen.

405
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,823
My sister will never be sane again.

406
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,321
Have you got any proof?

407
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:41,559
This is a certificate from one of
our most famous diagnosticians -

408
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:43,040
Professor Sebesky.

409
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,437
We'll just sell everything -

410
00:51:54,516 --> 00:51:56,837
the houses, the bonds and the title.

411
00:51:56,917 --> 00:51:59,017
And then we will go far away from here,

412
00:51:59,164 --> 00:52:01,873
and we will live like princes.

413
00:52:02,964 --> 00:52:07,042
Yes, my beloved, but first this drama
must be played out until the end.

414
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:07,940
Yes.

415
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:10,527
With a lot of heart.

416
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:17,042
Yes, and I'll applaud when the little
hypocrite is hospitalised on her birthday.

417
00:52:17,124 --> 00:52:22,333
That hussy will spend the rest of
her life in a mental institution.

418
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:23,562
How you hate her!

419
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:27,789
Oh, the good girl, the pretty thing,
the untouched innocent,

420
00:52:27,926 --> 00:52:30,003
Daddy's darling - I hate her.

421
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:33,249
That old bitch is
calculating and perverted.

422
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:36,993
Her sweet manner and gentle
smile won't help her now.

423
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:42,083
Stop thinking about her.
Think only about our future,

424
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:44,636
and about my convincing
acting over the past year.

425
00:52:44,715 --> 00:52:45,378
Yes.

426
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:47,336
It deserves a prize...

427
00:52:48,135 --> 00:52:49,766
an Oscar perhaps.

428
00:52:51,707 --> 00:52:53,229
You old rascal!

429
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,693
I did it all for you.

430
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:01,712
No, you did it all for
yourself, you scoundrel.

431
00:53:10,374 --> 00:53:12,058
Charles, I love you.

432
00:53:25,624 --> 00:53:28,791
CARLOS BARRIOS
Kiss me

433
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:33,525
The water is pleasant.

434
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,694
Why don't you come in?
It will do you good. Come on.

435
00:54:39,747 --> 00:54:40,846
All right.

436
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:48,159
Good?

437
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:52,616
Is the water too cold for you?

438
00:54:53,629 --> 00:54:54,405
No.

439
00:54:57,622 --> 00:55:00,872
- Have you ever seen fish mate?
- No.

440
00:55:00,956 --> 00:55:02,325
Neither have I,

441
00:55:02,957 --> 00:55:05,263
but I can imagine how it's done.

442
00:55:06,145 --> 00:55:09,539
The male approaches the
female and circles around it.

443
00:55:09,622 --> 00:55:13,163
- She ignores him and swims away.
- Like this?

444
00:55:14,413 --> 00:55:18,951
Yes, but he won't give up
and keeps on following her.

445
00:55:21,413 --> 00:55:25,288
Until she feels attracted to him
and lets him get closer.

446
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:28,705
Then he tries to touch her body gently.

447
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:36,122
- Like the way I'm touching you now.
- I think I'm falling in love with you.

448
00:55:36,205 --> 00:55:38,913
- Do you think that's bad?
- Love is never bad.

449
00:55:38,996 --> 00:55:42,704
I'm glad you say that.
You're always so kind to me.

450
00:55:54,758 --> 00:55:58,150
Enough of this now.
Come on, let's get out of the water.

451
00:55:58,409 --> 00:56:02,040
It's late, we must dry
ourselves and get dressed.

452
00:56:04,538 --> 00:56:05,763
That was lovely.

453
00:56:07,871 --> 00:56:11,419
Come on, we must hurry.
Your sister will be back soon.

454
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:16,579
Can we go swimming once
in a while, from now on?

455
00:56:16,663 --> 00:56:17,327
Of course.

456
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,440
Would they fire you, if they saw us?

457
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:23,691
I hope not. It would be awful
to live here with no one but my sister.

458
00:56:23,954 --> 00:56:27,093
How dare you disobey my strict orders?

459
00:56:27,344 --> 00:56:28,769
Milly is incurably ill.

460
00:56:28,848 --> 00:56:31,250
She is unpredictable and highly dangerous.

461
00:56:31,657 --> 00:56:35,470
I hope this will be the last time
you let Milly out of her room.

462
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:39,815
You can do anything you want with her,
but only at home, do you understand?

463
00:56:40,283 --> 00:56:43,145
You needn't worry about me, you know.

464
00:56:43,225 --> 00:56:46,216
I refuse to destroy
somebody in this manner.

465
00:56:46,296 --> 00:56:48,959
It's unfair and inhuman.
I'll go of my own accord.

466
00:56:49,628 --> 00:56:53,447
Go, if you're determined to,
but you will go empty-handed.

467
00:56:53,527 --> 00:56:55,607
You can shove my money up your arse!

468
00:56:58,638 --> 00:56:59,523
I know her well.

469
00:56:59,688 --> 00:57:00,976
You'll never see her again.

470
00:57:02,537 --> 00:57:03,803
I don't give a damn,

471
00:57:03,883 --> 00:57:05,859
as long as she doesn't tell on us.

472
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:07,721
Don't worry.

473
00:57:08,808 --> 00:57:10,040
I'll deal with this.

474
00:57:15,052 --> 00:57:16,058
Well...

475
00:57:18,537 --> 00:57:20,430
I'm going to have to have a word with her.

476
00:57:42,828 --> 00:57:44,897
- Come with me in my car
- Never.

477
00:57:44,977 --> 00:57:47,260
- I'm asking you to.
- Sod you!

478
00:57:47,622 --> 00:57:49,885
That's enough, OK? I need to talk to you.

479
00:57:58,494 --> 00:57:59,286
Come on, get in.

480
00:58:15,828 --> 00:58:18,092
How could you be so wrong about me?

481
00:58:18,172 --> 00:58:19,618
What a devil you are!

482
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:21,952
- Why am I always taken in by you?
- Why?

483
00:58:22,035 --> 00:58:24,247
- What about Edna?
- But, darling!

484
00:58:26,047 --> 00:58:28,685
How could I ever feel
anything for that iceberg?

485
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:31,578
I want to fleece her, you know that.

486
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:35,215
Once I've got the money, you and I
will go away and never come back.

487
00:58:36,577 --> 00:58:38,165
If only Milly wasn't there.

488
00:58:38,603 --> 00:58:40,260
How we've tortured the poor thing!

489
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,915
Don't think about it.

490
00:58:41,995 --> 00:58:44,439
She really is insane.
She always has been.

491
00:58:44,698 --> 00:58:45,665
I'm not sure.

492
00:58:46,084 --> 00:58:48,449
I don't want anything
to do with this any more.

493
00:58:48,528 --> 00:58:51,286
You're absolutely right.
Let's forget about it.

494
00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:53,745
Darling, tell me the truth.

495
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:57,345
Are you serious when you say that
we will go away to live together

496
00:58:57,425 --> 00:58:58,752
once you have the money?

497
00:58:59,952 --> 00:59:01,757
It's my dearest wish.

498
00:59:04,035 --> 00:59:06,369
And what should I do until then?

499
00:59:07,401 --> 00:59:08,739
Go and visit your sister.

500
00:59:09,908 --> 00:59:14,076
Under the circumstances, it might be
better not to mention this to anyone.

501
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,818
I'll stay in touch.

502
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:19,918
I should know better, really,

503
00:59:20,374 --> 00:59:22,211
but what have I got to lose?

504
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:43,078
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey!

505
00:59:44,953 --> 00:59:45,997
There you are.

506
00:59:46,534 --> 00:59:47,303
Thanks.

507
00:59:48,742 --> 00:59:50,826
- Would you like a drink?
- Rum, please.

508
00:59:50,909 --> 00:59:51,938
One double rum, please.

509
00:59:52,697 --> 00:59:55,609
I wanted to ask you a favour.

510
00:59:55,689 --> 00:59:59,617
It's something which demands tact.
I wanted to discuss it with you first.

511
00:59:59,701 --> 01:00:03,492
- You know I'm not stingy.
- And you know I'll do anything for you.

512
01:00:03,576 --> 01:00:06,576
- I want you to do something unusual.
- I'm always ready.

513
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:07,710
That's what I thought.

514
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:09,410
- What can I do for you?
- Not so fast.

515
01:00:10,061 --> 01:00:12,370
The main thing is that you
keep your mouth shut.

516
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,742
What? That's my speciality.

517
01:00:15,172 --> 01:00:15,785
Let's go.

518
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:26,145
So, you're in the picture.

519
01:00:26,945 --> 01:00:28,145
- Yes, I am.
- Come on, then.

520
01:00:28,405 --> 01:00:31,033
But we do it first, or I won't cooperate.

521
01:00:31,265 --> 01:00:33,367
I'll keep my word, and
with great pleasure.

522
01:00:33,551 --> 01:00:35,276
- Sarah.
- Yes, mademoiselle.

523
01:00:35,356 --> 01:00:35,944
Come on.

524
01:01:07,259 --> 01:01:08,016
Darling.

525
01:01:17,616 --> 01:01:20,158
Mademoiselle,
shall I take Monsieur upstairs?

526
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:23,866
We must get him in the mood first.
Isn't that right, darling?

527
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:24,773
Yes, mademoiselle.

528
01:01:30,373 --> 01:01:32,019
I'll undress Monsieur.

529
01:01:34,533 --> 01:01:35,735
Excuse me, may I?

530
01:01:37,907 --> 01:01:41,241
We don't want to lose any time.
Let's see the bare facts.

531
01:01:41,324 --> 01:01:43,337
Let's get those pants down.

532
01:01:43,711 --> 01:01:45,380
Right...that's...it.

533
01:01:47,949 --> 01:01:51,199
You behave as if you hadn't
had a man for a long time.

534
01:01:51,283 --> 01:01:55,267
- What a prime specimen!
- It really is a beauty!

535
01:01:57,116 --> 01:02:00,192
- Come on, help yourself.
- May I undress you, mademoiselle?

536
01:02:08,272 --> 01:02:09,979
Come, take me in your arms.

537
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:36,143
That's enough, mademoiselle.

538
01:02:36,403 --> 01:02:37,548
Remember Milly.

539
01:02:39,929 --> 01:02:41,741
You're right, Sarah, thank you.

540
01:02:42,365 --> 01:02:43,482
Give me a kiss.

541
01:02:53,889 --> 01:02:55,270
And who will kiss me?

542
01:03:23,489 --> 01:03:26,695
We didn't want to exhaust you too much.
You still have a job to do.

543
01:03:26,774 --> 01:03:29,983
Your wish is my command.
I'm always at your service.

544
01:03:30,063 --> 01:03:33,108
Milly is chained up, so you can
do to her whatever you like.

545
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:34,867
And she enjoys it too.

546
01:03:34,947 --> 01:03:37,655
- I'm looking forward to it
- Have a good time.

547
01:03:37,739 --> 01:03:40,339
- She's in that room up there
- OK.

548
01:04:01,274 --> 01:04:02,031
Edna?

549
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,392
Who are you, then?

550
01:04:07,949 --> 01:04:09,229
Has Edna sent you?

551
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,755
Then come...and take me.

552
01:04:25,308 --> 01:04:26,314
Go on.

553
01:04:28,738 --> 01:04:29,596
Not bad.

554
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:31,991
Let's get going straight away.

555
01:04:32,071 --> 01:04:33,195
Do it.

556
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:36,620
Do it.

557
01:04:37,905 --> 01:04:39,501
Do it!

558
01:04:44,863 --> 01:04:47,351
Oh, this is so amazing! It's fantastic!

559
01:04:48,322 --> 01:04:52,252
Good! Wonderful! Yes, it's
wonderful! I can't bear it.

560
01:04:52,401 --> 01:04:53,920
Yes...yes!

561
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,610
Oh, you're so good at this.

562
01:04:56,791 --> 01:04:58,599
Yes. Oh, yes!

563
01:04:58,946 --> 01:05:03,863
Yes. It's so wonderful. Yes! Yes!

564
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:10,540
This is so good.

565
01:05:13,133 --> 01:05:14,266
Give it all you've got.

566
01:05:15,546 --> 01:05:16,746
Oh, harder.

567
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:21,904
Yes, more! Yes!

568
01:05:23,696 --> 01:05:25,778
- Yes.
- Good?

569
01:05:25,862 --> 01:05:27,349
Yes, more.

570
01:05:30,737 --> 01:05:31,759
Careful.

571
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:35,182
Watch out. I'm going crazy.

572
01:05:55,321 --> 01:05:56,283
What's the matter?

573
01:05:58,029 --> 01:05:59,177
What's wrong with you?

574
01:06:00,487 --> 01:06:01,997
Are you feeling sick?

575
01:06:02,609 --> 01:06:03,878
Are you feeling sick?

576
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:06,432
Edna! Edna!

577
01:06:06,866 --> 01:06:08,071
Edna!

578
01:06:09,046 --> 01:06:10,591
Edna!

579
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:12,645
Edna!

580
01:06:13,188 --> 01:06:14,361
Sarah!

581
01:06:14,445 --> 01:06:17,126
What's wrong?
What happened, mademoiselle?

582
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:17,863
Oh, my God!

583
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:21,026
Wake up.

584
01:06:21,861 --> 01:06:24,252
He's not breathing.
Was it a heart attack?

585
01:06:24,487 --> 01:06:26,986
- He's dead.
- How could that happen?

586
01:06:27,069 --> 01:06:28,529
He collapsed.

587
01:06:28,922 --> 01:06:30,906
It was horrible. I couldn't move.

588
01:06:30,986 --> 01:06:32,195
What did you do to him?

589
01:06:32,278 --> 01:06:36,195
- Get him off the bed.
- Sarah, help me get him off Milly.

590
01:06:36,278 --> 01:06:38,279
Quickly! Quickly!

591
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:43,153
Oh, God, hurry up! Quickly!

592
01:06:43,236 --> 01:06:47,195
- Oh, God. I'm going insane.
- I can't get his leg free.

593
01:06:47,278 --> 01:06:50,402
Hurry up. Pull him away.

594
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:53,944
- Pull!
- It's getting tricky now. Pull.

595
01:06:55,819 --> 01:06:58,028
- Take him away.
- He's so heavy!

596
01:06:58,111 --> 01:07:00,611
- Wait, I'll help you.
- Yes, give me a hand.

597
01:07:09,903 --> 01:07:12,110
We must get rid of the body somehow.

598
01:07:13,152 --> 01:07:17,006
Sarah, help me undress him.
It's better if he's found naked.

599
01:07:17,086 --> 01:07:18,056
Yes, mademoiselle.

600
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:20,360
Stop crying!

601
01:07:20,444 --> 01:07:24,943
Now it's getting serious.
You've killed someone, little sister.

602
01:07:25,027 --> 01:07:27,277
No! No!

603
01:07:33,651 --> 01:07:35,722
We must drag him down
the stairs to the door.

604
01:07:35,878 --> 01:07:36,966
Yes, mademoiselle.

605
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:40,097
Pull the other arm. That'll work best.

606
01:07:40,443 --> 01:07:44,277
We'll put him in the car
and dump him in the sea somewhere.

607
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:47,651
If he is ever found,
they will think that he drowned.

608
01:07:47,735 --> 01:07:51,128
- That's a great idea, mademoiselle
- Thank you.

609
01:08:20,693 --> 01:08:23,348
I knew I'd see you again.

610
01:08:24,984 --> 01:08:27,177
It wasn't a dream.
You were really here.

611
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:29,721
And you made me happy.

612
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:31,930
I was looking for you.

613
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:34,861
I knew that our first encounter
was only the beginning.

614
01:08:35,187 --> 01:08:36,029
Do you understand?

615
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:39,629
I want to rescue you.
I will get you out of here.

616
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:40,993
Oh, yes, please.

617
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:43,618
I can't stand this place any more.

618
01:08:44,942 --> 01:08:46,361
Do it before it's too late.

619
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:48,518
You'll recover. I know it.

620
01:08:49,026 --> 01:08:50,517
You'll recover with me.

621
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:54,729
They'll be here in a minute.
I must get out of here.

622
01:08:55,609 --> 01:08:56,679
Trust me.

623
01:08:57,776 --> 01:08:59,608
My name is Joe. Joe.

624
01:09:00,508 --> 01:09:01,345
And I love you.

625
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,955
Just a second. Thank God.

626
01:09:16,594 --> 01:09:17,587
Is she still in chains?

627
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:18,805
I've taken them off her.

628
01:09:33,608 --> 01:09:35,385
Good evening.

629
01:09:36,978 --> 01:09:38,775
- Doc?
- Yes?

630
01:09:38,858 --> 01:09:42,399
How about a little shag?

631
01:09:42,483 --> 01:09:44,954
For me, patients are sexless.

632
01:09:45,254 --> 01:09:48,967
I'm offering you my bum
for your pleasure anyway.

633
01:09:49,047 --> 01:09:49,779
Good girl.

634
01:09:50,173 --> 01:09:51,879
That's where you'll get your injection.

635
01:09:52,748 --> 01:09:54,742
Oh, is that it?

636
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:02,779
This is so good.

637
01:12:16,382 --> 01:12:17,088
Edna?

638
01:12:49,219 --> 01:12:50,001
Edna!

639
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:06,001
Help!

640
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:07,495
Edna!

641
01:14:07,857 --> 01:14:12,354
I want to get out of here!
Let me out! Please let me out!

642
01:14:13,604 --> 01:14:16,935
Open the door! Please!

643
01:15:04,478 --> 01:15:05,275
You're dead.

644
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:11,275
You're dead.

645
01:15:13,687 --> 01:15:15,144
No!

646
01:15:21,103 --> 01:15:22,436
No!

647
01:15:46,103 --> 01:15:48,079
And they fucked happily ever after.

648
01:15:50,811 --> 01:15:52,936
- Excuse me, may I?
- Sure.

649
01:15:53,019 --> 01:15:55,044
- Thank you.
- Would you like to hear another one?

650
01:15:55,852 --> 01:15:58,988
- Everything went as arranged.
- I'm very glad.

651
01:15:59,068 --> 01:16:00,464
So am I, mademoiselle.

652
01:16:00,652 --> 01:16:03,255
...A piece of ice is an ice floe.

653
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:06,769
The gentleman wants to leave today.

654
01:16:06,851 --> 01:16:09,143
- Was he happy with everything?
- I think so.

655
01:16:09,227 --> 01:16:11,519
- Another one?
- No, we must go now.

656
01:16:11,602 --> 01:16:16,053
- Milly is turning 21 at midnight.
- Little Milly's turning 21?

657
01:16:25,893 --> 01:16:28,198
Milly? It's me, Joe.

658
01:16:36,977 --> 01:16:39,694
Joe, it is you...yes?

659
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:42,126
- What happened?
- It was horrible.

660
01:16:43,107 --> 01:16:45,137
I...I was having hallucinations.

661
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:48,207
- There was a dead man.
- Calm down.

662
01:16:48,765 --> 01:16:50,802
Milly, those were no hallucinations.

663
01:16:50,882 --> 01:16:51,953
The guy is alive.

664
01:16:52,032 --> 01:16:54,441
I saw him when I
sneaked into the building.

665
01:16:54,742 --> 01:16:57,978
I saw him drive away,
and then I found you unconscious.

666
01:16:59,091 --> 01:17:00,529
I didn't imagine it?

667
01:17:01,434 --> 01:17:03,841
The man died when we
were in bed together.

668
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,779
That was a few days ago.

669
01:17:06,434 --> 01:17:09,257
He wasn't dead that night, either.
I swear he wasn't.

670
01:17:09,645 --> 01:17:12,170
He left with your sister
and the other woman.

671
01:17:12,376 --> 01:17:14,145
The man looked very happy.

672
01:17:14,832 --> 01:17:16,338
Your sister gave him money.

673
01:17:17,214 --> 01:17:20,559
I had suspected that.
Yes, I had sensed it.

674
01:17:20,642 --> 01:17:24,640
I didn't want to admit to myself
that she could be so wrong and evil.

675
01:17:25,328 --> 01:17:28,571
I'll make sure that this nightmare
is over once and for all

676
01:17:28,651 --> 01:17:31,065
Forget your sister and
what she did to you,

677
01:17:31,471 --> 01:17:33,509
and forget your room in this house.

678
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,679
You must trust me.

679
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:38,254
I don't have to go back into that room?

680
01:17:40,225 --> 01:17:43,642
- Oh, Joe. Are you really flesh and blood?
- Yes.

681
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:47,851
- And you're really here?
- Yes, I'm here, and I love you.

682
01:18:11,891 --> 01:18:13,392
Come on.

683
01:18:43,599 --> 01:18:44,729
Joe.

684
01:22:36,429 --> 01:22:38,345
Yes. Yes!

685
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:04,269
You've made it, darling. It's midnight.

686
01:23:04,349 --> 01:23:06,864
- That calls for champagne.
- Indeed.

687
01:23:10,095 --> 01:23:13,012
- Are you happy, mademoiselle?
- Yes, I am.

688
01:23:13,095 --> 01:23:16,477
- You deserve it, mademoiselle
- Thank you.

689
01:23:20,012 --> 01:23:21,845
Here we go.

690
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:27,329
And now the third one.

691
01:23:29,095 --> 01:23:30,018
Right.

692
01:23:30,553 --> 01:23:34,303
- What the hell? Let's go for it.
- Yes, I want some.

693
01:23:34,386 --> 01:23:35,082
There you go.

694
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,348
The champagne is served.

695
01:23:37,428 --> 01:23:38,932
Excellent!

696
01:23:39,012 --> 01:23:43,136
Long may she live, our charming Milly
Let's drink to her birthday.

697
01:24:03,969 --> 01:24:05,568
No, you're biting me!

698
01:24:06,094 --> 01:24:09,136
- Just you wait! I'll show you!
- No, I'm ticklish!

699
01:24:10,428 --> 01:24:12,577
Mademoiselle, play with my body.

700
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:20,428
- Hold me, I'm scared.
- Don't be scared. I'm with you.

701
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:22,304
All this will be over soon.

702
01:24:23,761 --> 01:24:29,073
- I can hear their car. Hold me.
- It's all right, Milly. Leave it to me.

703
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:50,247
Oh, Joe, what are you doing?
Are you planning to leave?

704
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:52,806
- She's coming with me.
- She can't.

705
01:24:52,885 --> 01:24:58,717
Yes, she can. Milly is an adult now.
She wants to be free of her family's love.

706
01:24:59,517 --> 01:25:01,604
Milly, that's not possible. You're sick.

707
01:25:02,047 --> 01:25:03,510
I don't think so.

708
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:05,859
Vacate the house within three days,

709
01:25:06,109 --> 01:25:08,884
or I'll inform the police
of your activities.

710
01:25:09,686 --> 01:25:11,913
Please hand me the keys to Milly's car.

711
01:25:24,885 --> 01:25:25,713
Charles!

712
01:25:26,744 --> 01:25:27,769
What should I do?

713
01:25:29,888 --> 01:25:32,000
He wants to go away with Milly.

714
01:25:32,944 --> 01:25:35,304
He wants me to give him the car keys.

715
01:25:35,384 --> 01:25:36,950
Should I give them to him?

716
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:39,019
Yes.

717
01:25:39,275 --> 01:25:40,400
You don't have a choice.

718
01:25:51,048 --> 01:25:51,923
Come on.

719
01:26:14,346 --> 01:26:16,589
Charles, I don't care. I've got you.

720
01:26:17,217 --> 01:26:18,721
I'll go and pack a few things.

721
01:26:19,165 --> 01:26:20,777
I want to leave with you immediately.

722
01:26:26,342 --> 01:26:29,053
Charles! Where are you going?

723
01:26:30,759 --> 01:26:31,534
Charles!

724
01:26:33,269 --> 01:26:35,601
You can't just leave me behind like this.

725
01:26:36,076 --> 01:26:38,676
No! Don't go away!

726
01:26:39,707 --> 01:26:41,257
You bastard!
