"My friend the squirrel
was there this morning.

2
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,877
"He gave me a wink.

3
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,319
"A Glance ...

4
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,637
"I said see you tomorrow."

5
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,552
See you tomorrow.

6
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,908
Agostino, my coffee, quickly!

7
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,359
Agostino!

8
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,431
Pilar! My coffee!

9
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,239
You're serving?

10
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,072
It's her little girl's communion.

11
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,111
You've given her a day off?

12
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,198
A week...
Portugal's a long way.

13
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,073
I won't pay
for you to do their job.

14
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,794
It won't kill me this once.

15
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,719
And I like
being alone in my kitchen.

16
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,276
Everyone has their place...
you're Madame Pujol...don't forget it.

17
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,313
I wake up every morning  and repeat:

18
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,592
I am Madame Pujol ...
I am Madame Pujol ... "

19
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,559
Did your meeting with the German
buyer go well?

20
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,159
Success with them means entertainment

21
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,228
I took him to dinner in Lille
then to the 'Bada-Boom'.

22
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,837
With the pretty girls... will you take me there?

23
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,152
The 'Bada-Boom'?
-Yes.

24
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,557
Don't be ridiculous!
It's not a place for you.

25
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,752
It's not my place in the kitchen
it's not my place at the 'Bada-Boom' ...

26
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,839
Where is my place?
Stop asking stupid questions.

27
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,240
You didn't drink too much?
Let me alone.

28
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,034
You know what the doctor said.
I know!

29
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,717
You're getting more and more jumpy.

30
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,400
It's not easy running an
umbrella factory with 300 workers

31
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,070
Every day fighting the unions,
not to mention the tax department!

32
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,032
Papa said the same thing.

33
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,793
In his time it was a piece of cake.

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,070
Fortunately I've been able to fix ...

35
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,953
the mess he created.

36
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,111
That's true.
You brought your energy.

37
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,107
I brought a dowry
of my Papa's factory

38
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,354
I've got to listen to the news.

39
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,792
 In the provinces strike orders
have been issued by the unions.

40
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,390
We'll go to our guest
Communist MP Maurice ...

41
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,955
Aagh! Why him?

42
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,357
- While employers won't want
to include measures

43
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,235
favoring workers,
we'll fight ...

44
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,556
Fuck the workers! ...

45
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,799
.. buggering up my factory...

46
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,194
.... arsehole!

47
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,673
[Michèle Torr :"Take me dancing tonight."]

48
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,991
Oh, his drops!

49
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,111
Office of Monsieur Pujol,
...yes?.

50
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,673
 Mademoiselle Nadège,

51
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,838
Madame Pujol here.
Oh, hello, Madame Pujol.

52
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,158
My husband got home late last
night from the 'Bada-Boom' with the German

53
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,749
and this morning
he forgot to take his drops.

54
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,918
So if you'd tell him to drop back home,
as soon as he gets in.

55
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,878
I couldn't do that ...

56
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,719
You know the state he gets
in when he doesn't take them

57
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,196
Can I count on you?
I'll tell him.

58
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,670
Thanks. Goodbye.

59
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,996
A good deed done.

60
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,672
Good morning, sir.
What else?

61
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,632
I'd like a word with you.

62
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,956
You already on a
cigarette break?

63
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,912
Excuse us, Monsieur Pujol.

64
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,516
'Morning Nadège.
Your wife called.

65
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,551
What does she want?
"Your drops."

66
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,910
Aagh... she pisses me off!

67
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,998
No touching.
What?

68
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,077
What's this story about a German?

69
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,794
I'll explain.
No need. Keep that for your wife.

70
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,231
You're not gonna make a scene.
Tomorrow night ...

71
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,590
You'll go back to
the 'Bada-Boom'.

72
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,677
It's closed on Thursdays.

73
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,115
Mama, are you there?

74
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,999
Joel! Hello darling.

75
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,634
Happy birthday... I just picked it for you.
Oh, thank you.

76
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,400
How thoughtful.
You're up early.

77
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,790
I dropped the children at school.
Are they well?

78
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,713
Yes, but they're upset 
their father's away.

79
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,831
Give me a hand.
You've heard from him?

80
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,038
Jean-Charles finally phoned me
from Toronto.

81
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,838
Things going well?

82
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,548
Certainly...
I think we'll separate.

83
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,916
What?

84
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,152
He travels all the time,
we never see him.

85
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,557
I feel he's not
interested in me any more.

86
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,916
You should go with him on his trips.

87
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,116
And who'd look after the kids?

88
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,920
Me.
No way.

89
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,712
You're too busy.

90
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,833
It's me who'll take charge
of the children's education.

91
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,519
How sad...

92
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,314
...to separate 
from Jean-Charles, so soon.

93
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,078
Yes, I know.

94
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,192
But the idea that
he's deceiving me is unbearable.

95
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,834
You've thought about the children?

96
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,951
No, I'm thinking about myself.

97
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,155
Even among the most united couples,
there are empty times.

98
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,191
And then... they go away!

99
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,790
Or don't go away.
You know about that.

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,309
How long 've you been
sleeping apart from Papa?

101
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,715
I don't want to
talk about that.

102
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,549
When did he last behave like a husband
with you?

103
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,638
D'you think
I'd go into that!

104
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,359
There's more to life than sex,
little girl.

105
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,238
At your age, perhaps.

106
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,075
Your father works so hard!
In the evening he's tired.

107
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,548
Maybe he's deceiving you.

108
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,916
I forbid you
to criticize your father.

109
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,559
I'm not criticizing him,

110
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,268
It's you.
You've just accepted everything... everything!

111
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,995
You pretend not to see,
but he does just as he wants.

112
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,549
I've always been impervious
to gossip.

113
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,992
And then I have my grandchildren,
my garden, my poems ...

114
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,590
But are you happy, Mama?

115
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,551
Of course I'm happy.

116
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,950
I decided that...
once and for all.

117
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,799
But me, I don't want
this pathetic life.

118
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,390
I'd rather divorce.

119
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,950
How are you going to live, 
if you divorce.

120
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,913
I'll ask Papa for
a position at the factory.

121
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,752
That's not a bad idea.

122
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,791
You need to know it's what you want.

123
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,917
Me... at least, I know.

124
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,151
The worst thing for me would be
to become like you: "une potiche"... a trophy wife.

125
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,715
Joel!!!

126
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,155
You do it on purpose, don't you?

127
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,920
Don't park outside the entrance!

128
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,680
I stopped by for
Mama's birthday.

129
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,075
Who's birth...
Forgot?

130
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,072
That bitch Nadège forgot.

131
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,512
She's got other things to think about think.
Buy whatever you want

132
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,875
I'll pay you back.

133
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,310
Papa, you never change.

134
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,193
Tonight try to
be in a better mood.

135
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,038
I need to talk to you.

136
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,190
You know what she wants?
Divorce.

137
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,073
She's trading in Jean-Charles for someone else?
No!

138
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,271
She wants to work with her beloved father 
at the factory.

139
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,675
No-way-in-the-world-and-the-kids-good...

140
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,791
Gotta get my drops.

141
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,998
Laurent's not here?
He'll be here tonight.

142
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,236
He's got good news for us.

143
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,874
I'm wary of good news...
...especially concerning your son.

144
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,878
I think he wants to get married.
Great...eh?

145
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,877
Supporting a new family ...

146
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,674
But he's not asking you for anything.
That'll come.

147
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,555
The girl who's got her hooks into him
knows what she's at.

148
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,830
I reassure you,
her family is respectable.

149
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,713
She's the daughter of the Cathedral Square baker,


150
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,190
Floriane Marquiset.
Robert!

151
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,470
My God! But ...

152
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,477
Name of God, dammit!

153
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,990
It seems she's nice.
She's studied piano.

154
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,599
She studied the piano?

155
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,910
Would you've preferred the clarinet?

156
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,675
It's beyond belief for him
to marry Floriane Marquiset.

157
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,236
A Pujol with a Marquiset,
..... it'd be a disgrace.

158
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,069
You're being way too snobbish.
Wait 'til you meet her.

159
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,952
I'll never meet her.

160
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,549
And Laurent will not marry
Marquiset's daughter!

161
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,194
You understand?
If you want my opinion ...

162
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,311
Your "opinion"?
You have an opinion?

163
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,319
All I ask of you
is to share mine.

164
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,235
Be nice,
Just keep to your little poems.

165
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,717
Joel is right.
I'm just a trophy wife.

166
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,480
I lay there in a corner ...

167
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,398
I'm just part of the decor.

168
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,229
Are you challenging me too?

169
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,477
Name me one woman as indulged as you are.

170
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,797
With regard to household appliances,
I'm queen.

171
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,560
You have everything,
you have to agree.

172
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,877
Now the phone.
What a life!

173
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,599
Hello?

174
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,238
Oh ...can't be true!

175
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,953
Dammit!

176
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,673
Oh, damn!

177
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,558
I'm coming.
What's still going? I'm coming.

178
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,593
It never stops.
They're striking at workshop 4.

179
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,949
A strike?

180
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,835
It'll cost me millions.

181
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,679
What'll you do?
What'll I do...fight!

182
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,036
The ... But Robert ...

183
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,428
Be careful though. 
I'll go mad...

184
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,518
A strike!

185
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,438
A strike ...

186
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,668
"The rose in the morning

187
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,154
"Opens at noon

188
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,390
"Ephemeral destiny

189
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,469
"Died at midnight."

190
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,029
How's Papa?

191
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,158
Always in a bad mood
with these strikes.

192
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,193
You think it'll get better tonight?
Hopefully.

193
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,676
I'm sure he'll be charming...
being my birthday.

194
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,397
Are you happy the way your studies are going?
I've had a gut-full.

195
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,034
Political Science just isn't my thing.

196
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,913
What is your thing?
I dunno, Mama.

197
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,997
Are you still taking drawing courses?

198
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,395
No time...
... and what's the point?

199
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,238
What a shame, you were gifted.

200
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,795
I wish we had
an artist in the family.

201
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,395
You know what would make me happy?
What?

202
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,639
Come to work at the plant.
Not interested in the plant.

203
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,512
I wouldn't ever want
to work with Papa.

204
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,269
To end with the boss syndrome...
hated by everyone ...

205
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,994
Your grandfather
was adored by everyone.

206
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,636
Mama, paternalism,
It's over, old-fashioned.

207
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,195
Today's man must be a bastard,

208
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,914
orders, unbridled capitalism.

209
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,954
Tell me, when did
you meet this Floriane?

210
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,593
It's been six months.

211
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,836
We met on the train
when I came at Christmas.

212
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,473
That's romantic.

213
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,274
You're sure you're in love?
Yes, Mama.

214
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,630
She's crazy about me.

215
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,513
So much the better.
That makes for happiness.

216
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,475
One Sunday, after Mass
we stopped by her mother's bakery

217
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,796
and got a house special... a Bombe Glacée.

218
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,077
I recognised the beautiful Madame Marquiset
behind her counter,

219
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,748
always so well dressed.

220
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,393
She died
electrocuted by a hairdryer.

221
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,591
You thinking about getting married?

222
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,074
That's what she wants.

223
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,912
When'll we meet her?

224
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,958
Once she's finished
her exams in Paris.

225
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,718
How nice!

226
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,918
Grandma, look what I did
for your birthday.

227
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,509
Fabián, you were supposed 
to to wait for dessert.

228
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,274
- Let him.
It's so nice.

229
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,192
Thank you, Fabián.

230
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,914
When's Papa coming?
I dunno.

231
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,429
His schedule
is very mysterious.

232
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,871
What is it, exactly?
Terrorists

233
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,588
with machine guns.
It's fun.

234
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,074
What imagination!

235
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,392
Grandma, I'll do
an imitation of Coluche.

236
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,229
No, Stanislaus,
not that horrible Coluche here.

237
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,710
Yet it's funny.  No, it's vulgar

238
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,279
Paris would like it.

239
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,354
It'd do you good to travel.
Your Jean-Charles never takes you anywhere?

240
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,591
Please Laurent, not now.

241
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,559
That's Papa. I'll get the door.
He's got his key.

242
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,110
I'm coming, Papa. I'm coming.

243
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,073
Nadège? What're you doing here?
I must see Madame Pujol. It's very urgent.

244
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,236
She's is in the lounge.

245
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,988
Mademoiselle Nadège?
Madame, it's terrible.

246
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,236
Terrible?...
... Papa?

247
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,910
Yes. Monsieur Pujol ...
He had an attack?

248
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,712
No. He's locked in.

249
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,592
Locked in?
Yes.

250
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,711
He fought
with the foreman.

251
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,514
The workers have locked him
in his office.

252
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,917
I was sure there was something...
he was so on edge this morning!

253
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,957
Do they have
machine guns?

254
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,431
Stanislaus, Flavian
go upstairs.

255
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,951
You must call the commissioner,
to send a mediator.

256
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,434
We must get the riot squad.

257
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,832
We won't get anywhere with tear gas.

258
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,079
These workers have got outside the law.
We must act with diplomacy.

259
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,952
Obviously.
You side with the left.

260
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,720
Beside you,
everyone is left.

261
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,990
That's enough, calm down.
Mademoiselle,

262
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,151
what do they want
exactly?

263
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,352
They require new
health care.

264
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,591
This is not too much to ask.

265
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,958
The toilets are long-standing grievance.
They're Turkish-style!

266
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,838
It's all a political pretext.

267
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,396
They demand everything now:
Increase in staff...

268
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,154
a Christmas bonus ...

269
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,239
Remove surveillance.

270
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,550
Obviously, that's a lot.

271
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,392
It's that filthy Babin
who's behind it.

272
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,519
He stirs up revolt.

273
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,676
You heard him
on the radio?

274
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,792
That man makes my flesh crawl.

275
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,912
He'll be OK if he takes his drops.
He always forgets.

276
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,715
If I wasn't there ...
...rather... if you weren't there ...

277
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,071
....if we weren't there.
Don't apologize.

278
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,118
Well I'll go ...

279
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,794
Where are you going?

280
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,679
I'm his son.
They can take me hostage in his place.

281
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,229
Anyway.
I appreciate this.

282
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,714
I'm off.

283
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,555
Come on.

284
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,357
They're letting him go?
They talked with him.

285
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,398
It's Hubert
One of the worst.

286
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,670
I hope they'll
come to an agreement.

287
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,836
More and more are coming.

288
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,632
They're waving banners.

289
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,559
They wrote
on the wall:

290
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,593
"Pujol equals...oh!... Hitler."

291
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,269
They're exaggerating.

292
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,233
Besides the little bit
on the face ...

293
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,351
They're getting more worked up.

294
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,788
I'm scared.
Me too.

295
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,878
Nadège, lock the door.

296
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,912
Madame! Madame!

297
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,918
They're approaching the house.
Calm down.

298
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,715
Marie Antoinette found herself
in the same situation.

299
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,912
She still finished
under the guillotine.

300
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,951
What are they shouting?

301
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,912
Pujol ... Fed up ...

302
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,439
Pujol, fed ...

303
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,790
PUJOL, fed up!

304
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,831
PUJOL, fed up!

305
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,032
PUJOL, fed up!
PUJOL, fed up!

306
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,316
What are you doing here?

307
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,033
A moment of relaxation.

308
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,391
Some of the claims
aren't that unjustified.

309
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,149
Model secretary
turns into rabid unionist.

310
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,396
It won't last long.

311
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,359
I'm not turning into anything, 
but salaried staff've gotta to take a stand.

312
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,956
You don't know what's what,
you're the boss's daughter.

313
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,475
It's better than the boss's chick.
I forbid you ...

314
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,112
Who is it?
I'll go.

315
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,437
If it's the workers, don't open.
Trust me.

316
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,069
Who's there?

317
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,236
Laurent? Already?

318
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,152
You're not hurt, at least.

319
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,833
Assaulting my brother!

320
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,156
They're madmen.
No, you weren't there.

321
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,715
It wasn't the workers. papa.
Papa?

322
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,239
Robert?

323
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,910
The workers helped me
to see Papa.

324
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,432
I tried to reason with
him to make concessions.

325
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,235
He jumped on me screaming 
that I was a moron.

326
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,111
Luckily, the picket line
hemmed him in.

327
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,914
In this case,
it's better I go.

328
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,076
Mama,
they'll laugh at you.

329
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,556
I don't want your father's death 
on my conscience.

330
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,911
You want me with you?
No, darling.

331
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,076
It's better I go alone.

332
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,956
It's the boss's wife!

333
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,150
Yes?
Monsieur Deputy-Mayor, good evening.

334
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,279
Madame Pujol?

335
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,829
Can I come in?
Yes, of course.

336
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,712
Yes ...

337
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,714
I'm sorry
to receive you like this.

338
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,753
I'm not here
for a society event.

339
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,757
Good...then sit down.

340
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,192
To my left or my right.
Wherever you want.

341
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,676
What can I do for you,
Madame Pujol?

342
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,997
Monsieur Deputy-Mayor,
I came to ask you

343
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,550
to use your influence
to release my husband.

344
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,679
A dialogue needs to be opened 
with the union delegates.

345
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,630
My husband refuses.

346
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,230
I think it would be much better
to negotiate in a friendly manner.

347
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,189
"Friendly manner"?
One worker was attacked!

348
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,078
My husband is impulsive.

349
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,639
His left fist
alone?

350
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,190
Why are you being so aggressive?

351
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,034
I don't see why
I should help you.

352
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,990
You didn't always say that,
if you know what I mean.

353
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,550
Don't bring up the past.

354
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,157
Would our moment of madness be
incompatible with your image?

355
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,710
Or, for that matter, with the image
a perfect wife.

356
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,510
Without you, perhaps I would be.

357
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,320
Don't try to blame me.

358
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,278
After all,

359
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,670
youthful indiscretions
do happen.

360
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,796
You stinker!

361
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,992
It was the same for you
as for me.

362
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,869
You were a girl, boss's wife
and I was a worker.

363
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,793
I betrayed my class.  And I my husband.

364
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,393
Which is worse?

365
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,149
I remember
I was returning from a wedding.

366
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,509
Monsieur! Monsieur!

367
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,314
I'd punctured a tire on the road.

368
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,438
By chance we crossed paths.

369
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,519
- It was my usual route.
I'll help a neighbour

370
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,912
even if I disagree
with their politics.

371
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,996
Hello.

372
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,959
You should have seen
the state of your dress.

373
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,910
Hello.

374
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,037
All stained with grease,

375
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,317
the jack in hand.

376
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,473
I wore a dress in organza
with a pink cape.

377
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,468
I changed your wheel
and you made me smile,

378
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,150
abandoning for a moment
the arrogance of your caste.

379
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,868
Grandpa was a boilermaker.

380
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,078
You refused the tip I offered.

381
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,714
But I accepted a cigarette.

382
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,317
We went to have a smoke together,
in the shade of a walnut tree.

383
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,273
As we went
into the brush.

384
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,677
You must have thought
me an easy woman.

385
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,677
No, Suzanne.

386
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,634
The very next day
you resumed your distance

387
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,355
and firmly drew
the curtain on our adventure.

388
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,630
I was married, a mother.

389
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,910
I had a social status to maintain.

390
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,318
So many times I feared
you'd brag about it.

391
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,230
I can hold my tongue when the honor
of a woman is at stake.

392
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,476
Thank you.
Good.

393
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,359
You want your husband back?

394
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,755
Yes.
But if I get his release

395
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,315
I'll need a return match.

396
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,112
A return match?

397
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,029
Sir, I daren't understand....
....at our age?

398
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,958
No, you misunderstand.

399
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,357
It's no longer a horny truck-driver
facing you.

400
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,597
I'm confused. Forgive me.
No, forget it...

401
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,314
In other circumstances ...
Oh yes?

402
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,839
Let's get off the subject.

403
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,511
I'm thinking about the role you might
play within the factory.

404
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,630
Meaning...?

405
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,276
If reforms are not
applied in the immediate future,

406
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,313
the company will be closed


407
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,875
and 300 workers unemployed.

408
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,469
That's a lot.
Yes, Suzanne.

409
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,278
So? What did the doctor say?
I don't know.

410
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,993
He's still with Papa.

411
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,316
Does he know how
he was released?

412
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,875
Better not tell him.

413
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,674
How humiliating for him!
Freed by his worst enemy.

414
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,509
If the riot squad had been on the job,
we wouldn't have needed him

415
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,073
Don't be simple.

416
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,989
Even the communists have a heart.
That's what destroys a man.

417
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,800
His gaze wasn't the same.

418
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,439
Don't worry, he'll recover OK.

419
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,240
And if I made him
my special broth?

420
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,276
Why not.

421
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,674
You need rest, darling.       
But it's not that serious.

422
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,718
You're not
safe from another attack,

423
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,115
and you may have
a pulmonary endema.

424
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,438
You must spend one week
in hospital for tests.

425
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,269
But the factory?
The factory...the factory... it'll fold without you?

426
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,994
I'll leave you.
Here's the prescription.

427
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,159
Monsieur Pujol, I expect you
at the hospital this week.

428
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,429
That's it!

429
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,153
Thank you, doctor.
See you soon.

430
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,432
Have you talked to Laurent
about the Marquiset girl?

431
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,195
Did you tell him to forget her?

432
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,635
You don't understand...he's in love.

433
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,195
You're forcing me to reveal
something unpleasant

434
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,316
You give me no choice.

435
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,559
I have reason to believe
Floriane is partly my daughter.

436
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,438
What do you mean
"partly your daughter"?

437
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,310
Her mother told me.
Her mother's no longer of this world ...

438
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,438
So Madame Marquiset
was your mistress?

439
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,477
Straightaway... out come the big words!

440
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,073
What a fine husband!

441
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,197
Your reaction's a little late.

442
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,510
How was I supposed to know?

443
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,910
It's true that we were....
....discrete.

444
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,798
She was married.

445
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,753
She wasn't arousing
her husband's suspicions.

446
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,319
Exactly.  It's your son's fault.

447
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,278
Of all the girls in the world, that mental defective

448
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,717
had to go and find Mademoiselle Marquiset.

449
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,112
This trumps
the birthday gift that you forgot!

450
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,590
You want me to beg your pardon?

451
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,989
No. You disgust me.

452
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,069
Under these circumstances, you'll agree
that marriage is unthinkable.

453
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,959
They're already sleeping together.
Omigod!

454
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,749
Your banging the Marquiset woman
won't get you into heaven.

455
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,753
Why, f'Godsake?
It's so long ago.

456
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,355
But because ...

457
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,870
it's the straw
that broke the trophy wife's back!

458
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,991
Is everything OK, ma'am?
Yes, OK.

459
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,997
I made my special broth.

460
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,033
That's nice.
It'll do him good.

461
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,510
Cuckoo!

462
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,352
What are you doing here?

463
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,830
I'm here

464
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,830
I'm here
to give you my little specialty.

465
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,275
Yes.
That can't hurt me.

466
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,159
I was talking about 
my special broth.

467
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,430
Mademoiselle Nadège is really
a model secretary.

468
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,200
She made some broth
for your father.

469
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,312
She'll get it in her face.

470
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,398
He's here.
Have him come in.

471
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,433
Who?
The one who freed your father.

472
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,516
That man here?

473
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,716
It is you who ...
- That's me.

474
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,150
But it's the devil!

475
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,508
Hello.

476
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,712
Welcome, Monsieur Deputy.
And thank you again.

477
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,592
The union delegates

478
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,796
feel they have taken the first step.

479
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,316
They require
an immediate response.

480
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,509
It's just that my husband

481
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,557
isn't well this morning.

482
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,556
Tomorrow

483
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,677
he may receive visits.

484
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,319
You don't give a damn about me?

485
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,549
It's the truth...

486
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,155
True, he's very weak.

487
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,628
You want a certificate?

488
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,871
I've done my part of the bargain.

489
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,553
If I plead his case,

490
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,392
it's up to the workers to decide.

491
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,596
So in the absence of negotiations,

492
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,115
I predict a restoration
of the strike.

493
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,679
 As for me, I'll predict

494
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,434
my foot up your arse!
Monsieur Pujol!

495
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,159
He doesn't look sick.

496
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,072
What are you doing to me?

497
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,596
Isn't enough
having humiliated me?

498
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,552
Come off it, Papa ...

499
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,432
Shut up, arsehole!

500
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,313
Papa, be reasonable.
You'll strain your heart.

501
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,795
What have you done to me?

502
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,151
I only promised
Monsieur the Deputy-Mayor that

503
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,750
in exchange for your release
you'd consider some requests

504
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,558
...about staff.

505
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,835
That I'm for.

506
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,069
Me too.

507
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,840
For the brainwashing ...

508
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,512
Robert, you do nothing but fight.
You've got to negotiate.

509
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,516
Tell the delegates

510
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,115
that if they want
paid holidays,

511
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,231
they've got to
return to work.

512
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,591
If they want to earn more,
it'll require more work.

513
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,711
You thought I was finished, washed up.

514
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,798
My family was ready
to sell off the factory.

515
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,996
Once
the picket lines are removed,

516
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,677
I'll show you what 
a boss is who has two of them!

517
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,395
- Let me tell you

518
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,519
the Works
has decided to review your accounts.

519
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,830
Whadda you mean?

520
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,834
That your Mercedes is listed
as a company car.

521
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,359
Your apartment, your servants,

522
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,556
your home, your boat,

523
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,711
made out to be
company

524
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,474
expenses.

525
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,829
Papa!

526
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,274
Heart attack, as I predicted.

527
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,590
Raise his head.

528
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,354
Press firmly.

529
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,990
My father... a heart-attack.
Send an ambulance.

530
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,800
This is where is anger leads to.

531
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,679
He'll go to hospital now.

532
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,717
What about the factory?

533
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,394
Your father should
be replaced

534
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,029
by someone with power of attorney.  He transferred it.

535
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,510
In this case ...
No. Sorry.

536
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,996
The management of a factory,
Not for me.

537
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,836
Me?

538
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,559
She's worse than Papa.

539
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,439
But then who?
Jean-Charles.

540
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,636
Oh no, not him.

541
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,919
Why not you, Madame Pujol?

542
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,875
You're joking?
It'd be above board.

543
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,435
The founder's daughter,
the boss's wife.

544
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,914
But I don't know anything about it.

545
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,031
You won't really be
Plant Manager.

546
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,834
Just sit in
Papa's chair.

547
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,031
You won't be given any
responsibilities.

548
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,276
Still, I don't know if I ...

549
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,948
Suzanne, do what you're told.

550
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,957
Do what you're told.

551
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,196
Better you than someone else.

552
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,709
We've no choice.

553
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,388
If it's you who's asking me ...

554
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,070
I'ill do nothing to cause you concern.
That's the way.

555
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,236
So you agree?

556
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,510
In the interest of the factory, yes.

557
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,038
It's okay, I'll be fine.

558
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,396
I'm trusting on you
to keep me posted.

559
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,431
Count on me, boss.

560
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,153
Should I take your place, Madame Pujal?

561
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,072
Yes. You do that
very well.

562
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,993
No, Nadège.
I'm going with Papa.

563
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,479
It would have been easier

564
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,075
if you'd been
successor to your father.

565
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,350
You're going with history.

566
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,074
Women everywhere
are taking power.

567
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,838
Go, go home.

568
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,074
You have to speak to Monsieur Babin.

569
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,438
In what state of mind
will you meet the committee?

570
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,918
Conciliation. Provided
they don't ask for too much.

571
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,951
When the workers
demand too much,

572
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,720
it's that the boss
doesn't give enough.

573
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,229
Good. We must prepare
a little script,

574
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,149
so what you
say'll be without stuttering.

575
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,839
That's a good idea.

576
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,719
Me, I'd start with:

577
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,311
"Gentlemen, I come to you
in a spirit of understanding ... "

578
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,120
"Gentlemen"?
It's cold, it's snobbish.

579
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,551
I 'd say "my friends".
I wouldn't recommend that.

580
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,352
These aren't your friends.

581
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,953
Maybe they'll become so.

582
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,839
That'd take action,
not empty words.

583
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,753
Good. Go on.

584
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,037
"In a spirit
of understanding.

585
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,748
"I am just a woman,
but ... "

586
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,589
I can't say that.
It's obvious, isn't it?

587
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,189
I don't apologize
for being a woman.

588
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,358
It's not that ...
You're a misogynist.

589
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,597
We support
women's rights.

590
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,758
I can't say
"I am a woman."

591
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,191
I'll say:
"Yes, I am a woman."

592
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,312
Because whether you like it or not,
I'm a woman.

593
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,876
But I like it.
I like it very much, Suzanne.

594
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,034
They're waiting for you.

595
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,190
Already?

596
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,630
If we want
work to resume,

597
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,875
let's go.

598
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,915
How do they seem?
Not very prepossessing.

599
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,680
The less they're kept waiting, 
the better it'll be.

600
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,713
I'd like to get myself ready.
You're fine.

601
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,708
I know what I am.
They can wait.

602
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,553
No, really.

603
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,470
Does the factory say anything to you?

604
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,999
Should it?

605
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,634
When you had the luck to be your father's son

606
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,478
and when you've done Political Science ...

607
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,558
I'm "my father's son?
You are the Pujol son.

608
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,711
It doesn't interest me, all that.

609
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,115
The money, possessions,
benefits.

610
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,709
I'm against the exploitation of man.


611
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,394
Have you told your father that?  
Sort of.

612
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,635
What'd he say?

613
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,630
I'd be eaten

614
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,871
by others.
Typical!

615
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,877
Politically...are you engaged?

616
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,680
Politics, protests,
mean very little for me.

617
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,111
Everything is political commitment.
Don't wear yourself out.

618
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,831
What interests you?
You really want to know?

619
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,390
Yes.

620
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,030
Painting, art history,
Kandinsky ...

621
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,554
Ah yes!

622
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,348
Kandinsky, yes.

623
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,352
He was a true revolutionary.

624
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,034
You see that do you care
about politics.

625
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,196
Che Guevara, Georges Marchais,

626
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,759
Kandinsky ...

627
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,032
The politics of art.

628
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,953
I enjoy interacting
ideas with youth.

629
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,997
We should have a drink,

630
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,071
one day, together.

631
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,471
Yes.

632
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,118
What's that?
It's not like you?

633
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,630
It's not too much, Mama?
But why?

634
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,435
You won't present yourslf to the factory
in this outfit!

635
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,438
It's a provocation.
But I wanted to honor the workers.

636
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,358
And I put on all my jewelery.

637
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,313
Just for them... they deserve it.

638
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,670
Let's hope they enjoy them.

639
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,074
Let's go.

640
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,598
It's the dress you ...
Did you recognize it?

641
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,631
I hadn't forgotten.

642
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,718
The committee's
in the union meeting-room.

643
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,115
I've got stage fright.
I'll leave you...

644
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,390
...Miss Nadège will accompany you.

645
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,999
You're abandoning me?

646
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,478
The committee'd take a dim view...
I'm involved in the meeting.

647
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,796
Are you sure?
It's OK... go on.

648
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,628
Call me when you're done.
It's gonna be alright.

649
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,993
You won't leave me, will you?
No, madame.

650
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,433
Is my dress too much?
No, no.

651
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,629
That's fine.

652
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,673
Those men will be in for an eyeful.

653
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,915
How many are there?

654
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,032
Ten, I think.
Hope they're nice.

655
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,314
Gentlemen.

656
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,151
Good morning, gentlemen.
Hello Madame Pujol.

657
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,112
Sit down, guys.

658
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,556
My dear friends,

659
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,917
as you know,
my husband was hospitalized.

660
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,838
I'm standing in for him

661
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,355
until the end of his convalescence.

662
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,670
I am delighted to meet you

663
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,911
to get acquainted,

664
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,756
so we can chat ...

665
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,991
As you are aware,

666
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,915
your husband is precipitating the factory
into a catastrophic situation.

667
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,276
If we're on strike today,
it's not for fun.

668
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,476
We love our work.

669
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,033
We're fed up

670
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,840
I can here you quite well, André ...

671
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,109
No need

672
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,749
to get so angry.
Moreover,

673
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,389
I'm pleased to see
the progress you've made.

674
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,635
My father who took you on
as an apprentice

675
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,440
'd be proud to know you're
still here.

676
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,797
So what are
your concerns, my friend?

677
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,918
Madame Pujol
I'll be very clear.

678
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,111
We will not resume work

679
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,517
until the following claims
have been implemented.

680
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,280
1. Award of the Christmas bonus
to all employees

681
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,910
effective retroactively
January 1.

682
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,549
2. The fifth week
of paid leave.

683
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,956
3. Reorganization
of working time

684
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,430
and standardization of 40 hours

685
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,110
with extra hours
additional 25%

686
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,911
pursuant to Article 1 ...

687
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,473
As Papa said:

688
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,153
"There is no need

689
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,868
"To load the mule
for it to reach its destination. "

690
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,112
In any case,
I agree with you.

691
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,918
Things aren't good here any more.

692
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:57,148
It's time we once again had
the desire to work in fraternity and solidarity.

693
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,071
Concretely, what does that mean?

694
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,232
I swear on the heads
my children and my father

695
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,158
to examine your demands

696
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,470
with the most sincere attention

697
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,994
to improve

698
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,992
the situation in our factory.

699
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,798
As you know,
I am the wife

700
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,995
of Monsieur Pujol.

701
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,516
So he's my boss too.
So I can understand you.

702
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,957
Except that I'm
not about to strike.

703
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,193
Congratulations, boss.

704
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,151
- Mama? Mama?

705
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,070
So?

706
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,113
How did it go?

707
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,598
They go back to work tomorrow.
That's great!

708
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,678
I knew you could do it.
So you've given in on everything?

709
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,110
No. We negotiated.

710
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,437
You know, I really thought
about the situation.

711
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,757
I want to ask a sacrifice of you both.

712
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,230
I want you to be
at my side.

713
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,074
We are
at your side, Mama.

714
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,191
To work with me.

715
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,271
Joel, I want to propose

716
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,556
you help me with the management.

717
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,999
At the factory, with you?

718
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,835
I know you want to work with 
your father. I'm making the proposal.

719
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,110
Thank you, Mama!

720
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,151
You gonna mess my hair!
And I'm going out tonight.

721
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,796
I'm sure it will make things better between 
you and Jean-Charles.

722
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,350
And I'll do what?
I've got my Political Science classes. 

723
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,637
The experience 'd be good for you.


724
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,438
It doesn't interest me.

725
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,148
We'll find you an
artistic position.

726
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,518
And Floriane in Paris? I can't leave her.
I'd forgotten about that.

727
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,269
On weekends, we'll
have concerts at the factory.

728
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,758
Music doesn't do any harm,
especially to the workers.

729
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,558
So... to us!

730
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,711
To the Pujol-Michonneau factory.

731
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,713
To the Pujol-Michonneau factory!

[Baccara: "Do you speak French?"]

733

Who's the bourgeois bimbo
with the yokel?

734
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,833
Hey! Isn't it
that woman at Pujol's ...right?

735
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,554
Pujol? Our Pujol?

736
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,999
What are you smiling at?

737
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,113
Imagine Robert's face
if he saw me here, and with you.

738
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,592
The poor man.

739
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,870
Thank you for your help
at the factory.

740
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,753
I couldn't have done it alone.
It was nothing.

741
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,713
You know what surprises me the most?
No.

742
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,993
Is to celebrate the end of the strike,
here with you, at the 'Bada-Boom'.

743
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,760
I know this isn't
my sort of place,

744
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,712
but I've dreamt
of coming.

He brings his clients here.

746
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,033
Tonight, Suzanne
I'm the one who's your client.

[Once Upon a Time: "Come take a walk in the rain."]

748

Thank you.

750
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,872
Couldn't we start again from scratch?

751

Alas ...

752
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,354
You're the woman of my life
Suzanne.

753
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,313
And if we had
our life together?

754
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,351
It's impossible.

755
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,676
You're forgetting about your mistress.

756
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,599
Who told you about that?
That was a dirty trick.

757
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,839
It is called 'politics'... a demanding rival.

758
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,837
You know, Suzanne,

759
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,237
the old activist in me
begins to falter.

760
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,908
This revolution
I've fought for...

761
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,634
...I sometimes wonder
if I'll ever see it.

762
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,957
I'm still fighting
so generations to come

763

'll know a better world.

764
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,397
But I've a right to happiness, 
haven't I?.

765
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,033
Would you get it from me?

766
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,152
I've got a heavy name to wear:
Michonneau-Pujol.

767
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,550
But you'll change.

768
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,711
How will you introduce me?

769
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,992
Comrade Suzanne?
I can already hear the jeers.

770
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,037
I'll explain to them.

771
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,635
That you also love justice.

772
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,836
You'll share our beliefs.

We'll see a brighter future... together.

774
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,358
You'll lose your mayoral sash
and your seat as a deputy.

775

And I'm a married woman.

776
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,919
But you no longer love that man.

777
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,311
After so much time together,
links get forged,

778
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,630
invisible... but solid.

779
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,917
Of you two, it's Robert
who needs me most.

780
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,789
Oh, Suzanne!
I'm losing you again.

781
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,753
But no, no.
We can go on seeing each other....

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,117
....go out together,
dine face to face....

783
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,118
stay good friends.

784
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,797
That's reasonable.

785
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,631
It's our age.

786
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,238
Oh, Suzanne!

The demand for umbrellas in India

790
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,555
is up 14% per year.

791
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,036
By increasing our sales by 25%
we'd get ...

792
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,118
43.70% of the market.
Exactly.

793
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,914
Not to mention the climate forecasts


794
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,270
which predict an increase
in rain.

795
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,317
Where it falls,
there we are!

796

So if I count
one umbrella for every two households,

797

knowing that there are 110 million people
that's ...

798
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,838
22 million brollies.
Yes, 22 million.

799
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,836
It would be a big market.
The Japanese are already established.

800
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,389
Set all that out clearly for me

801
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,832
and do me a summary
for the sales manager.

802
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,077
And for my daughter too.
Ah? Okay.

803
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,953
What time does my husband arrive?
Ten past eleven.

804
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,436
Make sure I don't
have any appointments.

805
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,718
What's Laurent
going to show us?

806
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,348
Good morning, madame.

807
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,350
Hello, darling.

808
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,755
Good morning, my friends.
Good morning Madame Pujol.

809
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,996
How are you all?
Very well.

810
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,476
Call me Suzanne.
So?

811
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,353
We've finished the sketches
for the new collection

812
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,552
which could be called
The Rainbow Collection.

813
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,478
What a lovely idea!

814
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,114
One, two, three.

815
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,034
Oh! This one's very pretty.

816
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,878
I love these colours.

817
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,270
What d'you think, Nadège?
A bit garish.

818
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,318
But it's the fashion.
It's so original.

819
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,039
Look, Maman. A surprise.

820
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,992
The Kandinsky line.

821
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,879
Oh! It's daring.
That's the high end.

822
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,672
At the same time 
revolutionary.

823
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,916
With acknowlegements to Monsieur Babin.

824
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,997
On another tack, we've begun sketching

825
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,431
for the waxed line
But we haven't got far yet.

826
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,599
Your father 'll be happy and 
proud of your initiatives.

827
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,596
Hopefully.

828
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,912
They are amazing.
It surprised me, anyway.

829
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,913
Mama, can I talk to you?
Can it wait till this afternoon?

830
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,156
I want to see you
before Papa arrives.

831
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,076
Madame Pujol's office.

832
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,032
I'll be there in 5 minutes.

833
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,232
You're not expected 'til tomorrow.

834
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,749
Yes, yes. Okay, I'm coming.

835
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,398
I have a report that Jean-Charles did for me
that's absolutely wonderful.

836
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,068
Feeling better with him!
I told you so.

837
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,319
This report gives us ideas
on the future of the factory.

838
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,873
Among other things,

839
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,753
reduce staff and relocation to Tunisia

840
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,793
to increase
our profits by 35%.

841
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,116
Can you imagine?
I'll read it tonight.

842
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,793
Have you had any results?

843
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,554
Yes. I hope I'm not
pregnant again.

844
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,234
You told me ...
Are you sure it's his?

845
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,549
What do you take me for?

846
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,835
Excuse me.

847
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,832
You should thank Jean-Charles,

848
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,356
But the priority,
is to restore a harmonious social climate

849
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,391
within the factory.

850
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,598
But we must also
look ahead and modernize.

851
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,276
But modernise without layoffs.

852
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,631
When'll you stop
listening to your communist?

853
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:06,197
The deputy mayor has nothing to do
with my management of the plant.

854
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,271
I happened to see him

855
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,074
and he was opposed
to my initiatives.

856
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,390
Then read this report.

857
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,517
I'll read it... I promise.

858
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,830
I remember how my papa
was loved by his workers.

859
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,193
He led the plant
for over 40 years

860
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,075
and never a single day
stop working, even in 1936.

861
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,071
Workers
retiring,

862
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,319
were given slippers,
an numbered umbrella 

863
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,559
and his autographed photo.

864
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,837
Alas, now we're in 1977.

865
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,111
I haven't forgotten.

866
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,670
Hello, Monsieur Pujol.
Hello, Nadège.

867
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,189
How are you?
Very good.

868
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,837
I've missed you.
Me too, Robert.

869
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,552
One second, please.
I have something to ask you.

870
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,833
About the problem of structure...
the first stand ...

871
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,799
Ah, you do it for me.
- Stop.

872
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,515
They might surprise us.
They're eating.

873
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,917
No. There was a meeting
in the boardroom

874
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,078
on new development strategies.

875
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,236
"Development"?
My arse...yes!

876
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,670
Why you haven't you told me 
about this?

877
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,394
And my mail?
A postcard!

878
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,559
I didn't have my favorite little secretary
 in my bag.

879
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,070
Enough of this now!
Aren't you happy to see me?

880
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,669
Not like this.
I am no longer the same.

881
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,077
What are you doing, Nadège?
I changed.

882
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,551
I am a new woman
thanks to the woman in charge.

883
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,472
You're having it off with her too?

884
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,312
She, she respects me.

885
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,312
Come and finish
what we started.

886
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,875
I'm aroused!
I've made my decision.

887
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,753
If we're to continue
you've  got to leave your wife for me.

888
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,479
Leave Suzanne?
You're mad?

889
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,875
I've always cheated.
It suits her.

890
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,435
I don't want to live
in the shade.

891
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,677
I won't be tropohy wife number 2.


892
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,472
Nadège!

893
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,233
Suzanne!

894
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,711
You're back?
Just got in.

895
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,948
I wanted to celebrate your return.

896
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,037
I wanted to give you
a surprise.

897
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,358
And I brought a gift from
Greece for the umbrella queen .

898
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,279
You thought of me?
You've changed the decor?

899
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,311
I added
a little color.

900
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,671
It's beautiful!
I knew it would please you.

901
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,395
You're spoiled, Madame Pujol.
He's not mean to me.

902
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,670
Are they
real diamonds?

903
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,394
Here, I thought of you too.
Really?

904
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,439
Turkish delight?

905
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,511
Turkish delight? I love it.

906
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,955
Thanks from my diet.
Leave us please, Nadège.

907
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,434
Very good.

908
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,795
If you can assist
a man in trouble

909
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,077
without becoming skeptical
as to his quality,

910
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,151
if you know how to be beautiful
without being boring,

911
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,555
if you can be strong
without being impatient

912
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,751
experienced
without ageing,

913
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,394
friendly and smiling
even to a savage

914
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,835
if you know how to type,
shorthand, phone,

915
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,435
if you can give birth
during lunchtime

916
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,952
then better than architect,
engineer or minister,

917
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,475
forever protected by the peaks
where it shines,

918
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,033
thou shalt be secretary,

919
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,474
my daughter.

920
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,392
She's completely crazy.

921
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,239
But no.
Me, I like her.

922
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,670
You saw her new hairstyle?
No.

923
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,348
Give her a compliment.
You know me ...

924
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,755
You could force yourself.


925
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,234
I can't put a finger on it,

926
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,238
I don't know what you've done,

927
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,556
but I think you're better than before.

928
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,519
Kiss me?
I am your husband.

929
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,837
You'll have spent 30 years
keeping that in mind.

930
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,470
Like when I was pissed off
during the cruise.

931
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,399
But it was good for you.
You're fit,

932
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,870
tanned ...
I've got energy to spare.

933
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,514
Holidays over
for the guys too.

934
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,951
What holidays?
Last 3 months at the factory.

935
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,196
It hasn't been a holiday.

936
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,516
We even caught up with the strike days.
No kidding!

937
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,877
You received the reports?
Absolutely.

938
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,389
You've looked after everything
I was concerned about.

939
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,477
No, Robert, I assure you.

940
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,955
After the bad times
things have

941
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,196
gone well,
and even very well.

942
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,311
Still, after a strike.

943
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,149
You sat in my chair,
you put on your innocent air,

944
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,432
you've generously
accepted all the changes...

945
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,755
You've been remarkable.

946
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,673
The "Madame CEO" plaque will come off the door

947
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,792
and Madame will return to her
domestic activities.

948
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,558
I'm afraid not, Robert.

949
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,916
Who's the boss here, for God's sake?

950
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,957
Me.

951
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,037
An brief analysis of the situation.....

952
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,233
I represent an employer with a smile,
fair, warm.

953
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,955
I even managed to persuade
your children to join the factory.

954
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,513
Why I should leave?

955
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,435
I have majority control of the
shares, you poor boob.

956
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,070
Do you?

957
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,874
I checked things out
during your cruise.

958
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,355
Papa left me 15%
of the shares.

959
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,312
My sister inherited some.

960
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,557
Add to that the 20%
of Laurent and Joel,

961
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,591
more small shareholders.

962
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,950
In total,
I've got 55% under my belt.

963
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,799
You don't even have that 45%.
Suzanne!

964
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,709
But I'll defend
your interests like a lioness!

965
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,229
You'll be able to live
for yourself!

966
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,034
Golf, fishing,
hunting, bridge ...

967
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,516
You won't miss anything!
So that's me now, the trophy wife?

968
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,709
Sort of.

969
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,990
But you'll soon get the hang of it.

970
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:00,950
Come in.

971
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,919
Papa? You're back?

972
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,559
Hello.

973
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,029
That sounds like you're going.

974
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,993
Your tricks won't work.

975
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,555
I haven't had the last word.

976
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,189
Laurent has had nothing to do
with all this.

977
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,472
He runs the design department of
Pujol umbrellas ...

978
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,678
I don't give a fuck!
I want my place back!

979
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,394
He's done a great job...
remarkable!

980
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,319
Forget it, Maman...
papa won't change.

981
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,990
I'll miss my train.
Don't be late on our account.

982
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,714
Hi to Floriane and kisses from me.

983
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,593
Hang in there.

984
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,109
"Floriane"?

985
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,715
The Marquiset girl.
He'll see her in Paris.

986
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,157
They seem
to get along wonderfully.

987
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,759
You're crazy.

988
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,236
You've forgotten what I told you?
It still gives me a pain in the gut.

989
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,271
They can no longer see each other.

990
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,751
They're brother and sister.     
You don't say!

991
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,475

You're so respectable!

992
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,430
It bores me

993
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:09,117
to tell it like that ...
Don't get angry.

994
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,270
Go ahead, speak.

995
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,990
Laurent and Floriane can marry
with impunity.

996
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,958
But I'm telling you ...

997
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,077
They are not brother and sister.
Huh?

998
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,230
Think about it!

999
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,552
No! Laurent ...

1000
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,713
Yes.

1001
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,114
You're lying.

1002
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,918
I'll have to go.

1003
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,190
Put yourself in my shoes.

1004
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,876
I was young, quite cute
completely neglected

1005
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,839
by an unfaithful husband.
I am avenged.

1006
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,798
I regret nothing.

1007
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,672
And I fixed your mistake.

1008
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,434
Who...who've you deceived me with?

1009
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,877
There are limits....
Just calm down.

1010
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,634
My factory, my wife, my son ...

1011
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,389
It's the end of the lunch break.
It was good to see you again.

1012
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,870
We still have
things to discuss.

1013
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,230
I must get back to work.

1014
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,238
There's a quiche
for you in the fridge.

1015
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,193
I'm not hungry.
Come on, don't sulk.

1016
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,198
I put the TV
in your bedroom.

1017
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,551
In the afternoon?
You can watch "Madame Today."

1018
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,995
 Women's work,
you are for it?

1019
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,198
 It gives an impression
of equality with men.

1020
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,317
 The husband should earn
enough money

1021
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,869
 so his wife
could stay at home.

1022
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,553
 It's our job.

1023
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,872
 This is not a bad idea.
It brings money.

1024
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,908
 She may not have
a salary like yours?

1025
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,357
 It should fullfill them.
If they stay at home

1026
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,754
 After this break.

1027
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,959
Oh, Joel!

1028
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,436
My darling!
I'm glad to see you.

1029
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,355
My! you're beautiful.

1030
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,309
It seems
you work at the plant.

1031
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,750
Mama trusts me.

1032
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,713
More reproaches!
You're all against me?

1033
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,512
But no.
We missed you.

1034
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,757
I'm flattened, Joel.
Your mother's finished me off.

1035
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,474
I know
She's become another woman.

1036
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:26,310
With her it's all about
"Participation" and "Self-Management."

1037
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,593
Jean-Charles is very concerned
about the future of the factory.

1038
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,839
But she got things through
that Babin refused you.

1039
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,640
Yes... that's it, it's Babin.
She's his toy.

1040
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,269
He manipulates.

1041
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,555
He's humping her?

1042
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,314
Oh, Daddy!
I'd rather not know.

1043
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,074
In my opinion, it's a not new situation

1044
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,833
I found this.

1045
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,911
The bitch!

1046
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,998
So it was him.
"Him" What?

1047
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,350
She'll pay for this.

1048
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,953
Hello. I want to talk
Monsieur Babin.

1049
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,038
You have an appointment?
I'm Monsieur Pujol.

1050
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,878
Robert Pujol.

1051
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,953
Monsieur Babin, hello.
Monsieur Pujol is back.

1052
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,873
Back, yes.
And I need your help.

1053
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,277
I have a report on measures
planned by my wife.

1054
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,193
To undo anything
you did.

1055
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,913
What have I done?

1056
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,310
The wildcat strike,
my confinement,

1057
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,956
all that has been conducted
masterfully.

1058
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,476
Then you arrange
to make the report public about

1059
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,712
who wants to reduce
staff and relocate.

1060
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:52,469
I will not tell you
your job, Babin.

1061
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,033
And I want my job.

1062
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,397
Better you convince your board.

1063
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,556
Especially your workers.

1064
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,314
You are a mass manipulator
Babin.

1065
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,511
And with
money to put on the table ...

1066
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,435
D'you take me for a clown
who favors employers?

1067
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,319
You're a two-faced man
my dear.

1068
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,595
What do you imply?
What were you doing with my wife

1069
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,234
at the Bada-Boom?
What?

1070
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,870
Don't make out innocent.
And expect more.

1071
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,709
You were seen with Madame Pujol
in the cafeteria of the Sofitel.

1072
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,238
We met to talk about
working conditions at the factory.

1073
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,029
With all those precautions
to not be recognized?

1074
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,350
We wanted to avoid
talk.

1075
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,672
What would
your constituents

1076
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,598
and the Central Committee do

1077
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,952
if they found
in the local rag

1078
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,550
a photo of
incorruptible member

1079
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,150
trying to break out the champagne
with Madame Pujol.

1080
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,430
Why create a scandal that

1081
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,949
will explode in everyone's face??

1082
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,993
Why?
Because I am a man betrayed

1083
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,760
and I don't care about the scandal.
Listen,

1084
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,872
Nothing has happened
between your wife and me.

1085
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,548
And 25 years ago?

1086
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,319
- My God!

1087
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,033
That's me.

1088
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,189
Suzanne loves me, then.

1089
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,471
It may cost you

1090
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,912
if I reveal that your adventure
produced a brat,

1091
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,792
my son Laurent.

1092
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,513
Laurent?

1093
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,711
Your son?

1094
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,920
My son?
Alas, yes.

1095
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,918
You sure?
Oh, I wasn't there, was I?

1096
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,229
Life is strange.

1097
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,749
We believe ourselves a hardened old fighter...


1098
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,554
and find we're a young papa.

1099
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,562
Your blackmailing has made
me the happiest of men.

1100
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,708
Anyway, if you
don't organise this strike for me,

1101
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:07,436
Your career is shattered.
Yes. Yes, Pujol.

1102
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,797
Our main
competitors, the Chinese.

1103
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,151
are very interested ...
Madame Pujol?

1104
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,755
My mother's doing an interview.

1105
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,679
It makes me happy to see you.
Me too.

1106
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,232
What youth, what enthusiasm!
Are you alright, Mr. Babin?

1107
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,476
That hair, that smile,
the look ...

1108
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,715
Monsieur Deputy-Mayor?

1109
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:33,316
Would you tell them
how the region is proud

1110
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,039
to have a woman like me ...

1111
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,708
I won't be part of
your personality

1112
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,552
worship.

1113
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,876
Excuse him, he's a communist.

1114
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,793
It makes me happy
see you, you.

1115
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,830
Me too ...

1116
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,274
I'm all yours.

1117
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,394
Could we see
her alone?

1118
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,431
Let's go to my office.

1119
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,757
I'd rather do it in my car.
In your car?

1120
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,029
It's uncomfortable.

1121
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,748
Follow me.

1122
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,195
You'll look after these gentlemen?
Yes.

1123
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,868
Be careful.
Babin's a bit weird.

1124
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,792
Yes, I'm coming, coming.

1125
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,198
Your husband came to see me.

1126
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,234
Is it true, Suzanne
that your son is mine?

1127
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,557
That my son
is not his.

1128
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,069
Is this gossip
behind my back....

1129
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,397
What is this nonsense...
The truth.

1130
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,079
Tell me the truth.

1131
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,034
One word can make me
the happiest of men.

1132
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,913
Is Laurent my son?

1133
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,309
I'd wish you that pleasure, 
Monsieur deputy mayor...but...

1134
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,954
If we look
at the dates ...

1135
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,879
my photo
in your locket.

1136
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,832
You've got my medallion?

1137
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:38,750
I have been looking for months.
Your husband nicked it from you.

1138
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,715
Tell me, ....Laurent?.

1139
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,715
No, Maurice,
It's not you.

1140
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,319
Really?

1141
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,109
So...finally, he's Pujol's.

1142
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,471
No. He's neither yours nor his.

1143
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,114
Whose is he then?

1144
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:02,829
I've every reason to believe
he's the son of Monsieur Balestra.

1145
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,553
The notary?

1146
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:09,477
He was a clerk at the time.

1147
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,797
Hard to understand 
when you see him today.

1148
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,310
I was often in his study
discussing Papa's estate.

1149
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,119
He was young, charming.

1150
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:24,233
In his office there was this big leather sofa.

1151
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:29,156
Everything suggests that Laurent
is the son of Monsieur Balestra.

1152
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:33,319
Although, if I were to rely only
on appearances,

1153
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,431
he's the image of Gunnar,

1154
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,638
this cheerful Swede who gave
tennis lessons

1155
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,917
for children,
a tall blond... pretty hefty.

1156
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,719
There've been many?

1157
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,520
No... no others in May '52.

1158
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,349
Poor Pujol married
a bourgeois nymphomaniac.

1159
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,876
You can't judge me
by my youthful indescretions.

1160
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,832
You've benefited.

1161
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,640
I'd put you
on a pedestal.

1162
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,518
I happened to come down.

1163
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,274
I've only had brief adventures.

1164
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,274
That's ancient history.
I've other concerns now.

1165
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,353
Exactly...
what's this here?

1166
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,149
This is the report by Jean-Charles.
I really must read it.

1167
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,597
She'll be angry.
You think I'm going to believe that?

1168
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,757
I'm a man killed twice over,
Suzanne.

1169
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,919
After the revelations of your husband
I thought, as in a dream

1170
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,758
I'd become a father

1171
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,198
and your companion. How
could I have fooled myself so much?

1172
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,749
You never stopped
being just the same:

1173
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,714
'Wifey', locked up
in his world of lies.

1174
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,433
And I thought to myself...
a tryst,

1175
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,995
in memory of our meeting!

1176
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,792
Serves me right.

1177
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,228
I beg you kindly
get out of my car.

1178
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,476
The factory's over 5 kilometres

1179
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,948
And I've got high heels.

1180
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,192
This is where our journey ends.

1181
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,516
Farewell, Suzanne. Goodbye.

1182
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,591
Hey!

1183
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,397
Thank you, sir.
You've saved my life.

1184
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,876
How am I going to go?
Oops, my skirt!

1185
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,789
You travel this way often?

1186
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,389
It happens. Why?

1187
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,394
It's pretty, isn't it?

1188
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,438
Very pretty.

1189
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,829
NO TO OUTSOURCING!
NO TO OUTSOURCING!

1190
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,594
 Madame Pujol promised
continual dialogue.

1191
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,239
 It's always the same.

1192
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,955
We trust the bosses,
and then before long... go whistle for it!

1193
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,156
 I condemn the pernicious use


1194
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,874
of this report
which I strongly condemn

1195
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,911
and do not want to use.

1196
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,355
Grandma's beautiful.

1197
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,272
 Many believed in her.

1198
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:53,439
She continues the politics
of her husband.

1199
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:57,514
We must return to a report
supported by the unions.

1200
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,990
 I met
the Board of Directors

1201
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,191
to find a solution.

1202
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,200
Hah!
Don't worry, Mama.

1203
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,391
Everyone supports you.

1204
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,558
So why the strike?
It's the principle.

1205
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,354
Your father's got
shareholders against me.

1206
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,358
I reassure you,
they'll be on our side.

1207
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,312
Fortunately you're there.

1208
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,353
How'd I have got by
without my son?

1209
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,791
Thank you, Laurent.
This is normal.

1210
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,149
Poor Floriane,

1211
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,830
I've kept you from her.
I've learned a lot from you.

1212
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,838
How do I look?
You're perfect, as usual.

1213
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,519
So let's go.

1214
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,829
Hello, my friends.

1215
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,833
Following the incidents
caused by the publication

1216
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,429
of this report, that I've been accused
of commissioning,

1217
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,719
a meeting of this Board
has been called.

1218
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,191
I hope we can discuss this in a fraternal spirit.

1219
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,558
Monsieur Pujol, you wish to speak?

1220
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,915
Yes, Madame Chair.

1221
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,873
I would like
in these circumstances of crisis

1222
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,475
to propose a vote
at the meeting:

1223
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,439
For or against the continuation

1224
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,830
of your plant management,
madame,

1225
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,757
knowing that I am prepared
to take over the reins

1226
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,797
as soon as possible.

1227
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,359
Things are clear.

1228
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,114
The situation calls
for some urgency.

1229
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,193
Good. To a vote then.
Mademoiselle Nadège,

1230
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,477
would you record the votes?
Naturally.

1231
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,958
Starting on my left.

1232
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,077
Do you think I should direct

1233
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,995
the factory management?
Yes, Mama. I'll give my 10%.

1234
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,832
On top of my my 15%

1235
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,399
that's 25%.

1236
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,749
Mademoiselle Genevieve Micheneau?

1237
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,599
I'll keep my confidence in you, Suzanne

1238
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,593
and I give you my 15%.
Thank you, my dear sister.

1239
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,717
Monsieur Pujol?

1240
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,997
I vote against your direction.
It's 45%.

1241
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,151
Okay.

1242
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,719
Gentlemen?

1243
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,599
Despite the destabilization
you have suffered,

1244
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,516
we recognize the value
your work in recent months.

1245
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,193
And then,

1246
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,351
we submit our 5%.

1247
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,194
Madame Pujol, 45 per cent.
Monsieur Pujol 45 per cent.

1248
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,112
Leaving only my daughter, Joelle,

1249
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,193
whom I have wisely
advised and assisted

1250
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,556
during these last few months.

1251
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,636
I give my 10% ...

1252
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,796
To Robert Pujol, my father.

1253
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,193
Thank you, my daughter.

1254
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,793
The bitch!

1255
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,798
What a bitch!

1256
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,670
Laurent, you have a moment?

1257
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,275
I have very important things to say to you.

1258
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,471
We have nothing to say.
I'm going.

1259
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:02,669
Listen, Laurent

1260
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:06,549
I'm getting older and tireder

1261
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,955
and I'm not in great shape.

1262
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,390
I put my energy and passion

1263
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,830
in developing this factory.

1264
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,470
I know that during my absence
You have been remarkable.

1265
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:22,157
I want you to work here,
to one day take over my estate.

1266
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,073
If you're trying to soften me up.
It's too late.

1267
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,748
It is never too late.

1268
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,757
Especially after
what you just did.

1269
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,515
I've only reclaimed my position 
to make it better for you.

1270
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,228
Your methods disgust me.

1271
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,716
You'll do anything,
even crush your own wife.

1272
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,952
He's warped you!

1273
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,070
That Babin.

1274
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,880
Monsieur Babin has nothing
to do with this.

1275
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,435
Much more than you think.

1276
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:53,519
So you agree
to remain at the plant

1277
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,958
to work with your father?
My father?

1278
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:01,038
When you have been
a father for me?

1279
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,029
To think that's it's thanks to me 
that you're here.

1280
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,755
I let you have
a strategic position.

1281
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,472
That is how you thank me.
What ingratitude!

1282
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,194
Papa would've offered me
the same position.

1283
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,958
You're very naive
my daughter.

1284
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:24,789
If you knew what he said when
I asked him to involve you.

1285
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,194
Don't be cruel.

1286
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:31,036
But allow me to regret
your lack of female solidarity.

1287
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:35,032
There is no solidarity,
but of competence.

1288
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,516
You're your father's daughter.
He's happy to use

1289
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,557
Jean-Charles' report.

1290
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,832
I beg you, Mama
don't get angry.

1291
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,832
When you made me out to be a dummy 
who accepted everything!

1292
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,310
But you were happy about it.

1293
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,475
That's what I thought.  What are you going to do?

1294
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,989
What you don't dare to do:
Divorce.

1295
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,115
You can't do that.

1296
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,750
So your mother's to stay
as the servant-trophy-wife?

1297
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,916
I'm entitled to my freedom.

1298
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,909
But why ...

1299
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:16,949
Why should I fight you
when I'm your mother?

1300
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,673
You want the truth, Mama?
Sure.

1301
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,749
I voted against you
because of Jean-Charles.

1302
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,916
What d'you mean?

1303
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:31,111
Papa promised to give him
my position for the 10%.

1304
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,310
You'll give up your position?
Yes.

1305
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:40,191
That way, Jean-Charles
will stop travelling and stay here with me.

1306
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,318
I'm no longer able
to live alone.

1307
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,074
I'm pregnant, Mama.

1308
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,708
I'm going on maternity leave
and I'll leave my job.

1309
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,269
It is monstrous.

1310
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,268
You don't have to sacrifice yourself,
 and your work, for your husband.

1311
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,232
And the pill does exist.

1312
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,069
Abortion, too, today.
Jean-Charles is against it.

1313
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:10,232
But it's your body,
darling.

1314
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,079
It's up to you.

1315
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,395
I made my decision, Mama.

1316
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,830
I want to keep this child.

1317
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,194
Very good.

1318
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,029
I can only rejoice for you.

1319
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,912
I ask one thing:

1320
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,594
Don't get divorced.

1321
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,912
Papa wouldn't support it
and me neither.

1322
01:20:04,913 --> 01:20:06,913
Some months later

1323
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,833
What are you doing?
Nothing.

1324
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,238
Oh, the little rascals.

1325
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,115
 Jean-Charles assured me

1326
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,833
that labor's good in Tunisia .

1327
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,952
There may be workers
for almost nothing.

1328
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,674
We think it'd be
a good idea.

1329
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,913
Suzanne, don't forget
to call the Prefect...

1330
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,475
....Christmas for the kids at the factory.

1331
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,359
I'll ask Mademoiselle Nadège.

1332
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,994
I'll be busy for
the next few days.

1333
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,912
What do you have to do?

1334
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,479
Haven't I told you?

1335
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,990
I am running for election
on an anti-Babin platform.

1336
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,795
Are you crazy?

1337
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,873
No. Just a woman of the 80s.

1338
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,475
Mama, we're still in 1978.

1339
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:10,236
You've knocked me for living in
the past. Now I'm taking the lead!

1340
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,438
Hello, monsieur.

1341
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,914
I'm Suzanne Pujol.

1342
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,032
Delighted.
I am running for election.

1343
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:34,068
When I was little, my father
took us to a farm.

1344
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,794
There was one
called Rose.

1345
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,513
"Rose"?

1346
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:42,349
I have one called Plum
and the other Falbala.

1347
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,595
"Falbala"?

1348
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,956
Is that fermented milk?

1349
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,151
It's milk that's at 37 degrees

1350
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,989
that we mix it with
rennet, and it's is drained.

1351
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,192
Then you put them ...
That's it.

1352
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,954
Chabichou cheese with nettles.

1353
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,276
It is a kind of
Saint-Paulin.

1354
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,995
If I'm elected, I'll support
it at the National Assembly.

1355
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,760
We really need it.

1356
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,315
To you, to us!
Chabichou, it's crazy.

1357
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,033
In Chabrechou!

1358
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,355
Wait. I'm your candidate.

1359
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,397
Look, miss.
Thank you.

1360
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,552
Hello, Laurent.
Vote for me.

1361
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,955
Madame Pujol
I'm glad to see you.

1362
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:28,232
Nadège, how are you?
Oh, it's difficult.

1363
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,431
Everything is back as before.

1364
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,717
Vote for me.
I will improve things.

1365
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,992
I intend to do.
I wanted to tell you one thing.

1366
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,710
What you're doing... it amazes me.
Thank you, Nadège.

1367
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:45,033
I see that a woman can
succeed without a man.

1368
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:48,238
I'm Madame Pujol.
I'm running for election.

1369
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,671
I'm for reconciliation
and well-being.

1370
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,916
I'm an independent.

1371
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,637
You spoke to the priest?
Yes.

1372
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,400
He'll vote for us.
That's good.

1373
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,160
He's very influential.
That's true.

1374
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,515
Do I finally
get to meet Floriane?

1375
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:09,235
No. She's not here.
She doesn't come on weekends?

1376
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,429
It's...over.

1377
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:13,513
My God!
You told me nothing.

1378
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,955
Not because of me, I hope.

1379
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,113
In a way.

1380
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,993
You're the the most important woman
 in my life.

1381
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,555
You're exaggerating.
I'm just your maman.

1382
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:25,669
You haven't introduced me to

1383
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,832
that nice young man
who helps us produce the leaflets.

1384
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,274
It's Jean-François.

1385
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,517
He just came along 
and offered to help.

1386
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,073
He adores you too.

1387
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:39,632
I can understand why people vote
for us seeing this handsome boy.

1388
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,075
You have a family resemblance.

1389
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,953
He's Monsieur Balestra the notary's son
.

1390
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,595
Your father will be pleased.
About what?

1391
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,633
That you've broken up
with Floriane...

1392
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,877
His snobbishness about his son with a pastrycook ...

1393
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,997
Here, Jacqueline.

1394
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,029
March 12,
Vote for Madame Pujol.

1395
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,959
You never go out,
but there, it's worth it.

1396
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,150
Ah, Nadège.
Hello. Going OK?

1397
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,798
You want to get rid of Babin?
Now's the time.

1398
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,235
Vote Babin. March 12.

1399
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:17,350
Your father, okay?
Have him come March 12.

1400
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,516
Hello. Feeling well?

1401
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,029
Remember
March 12, vote Babin.

1402
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,838
Very good cheese.
March 12, at the polls.

1403
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,672
Thank you. Hello to your wife.

1404
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,118
What's this?

1405
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,237
Ah, that Pujol woman.

1406
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,873
Pass out leaflets, the leaflets!
Babin ...Vote Babin!

1407
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,237
Hello, sir.
I consider everyone.

1408
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,756
She's had a facelift.
She had to go on a diet.

1409
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,918
Hello.
Hello, Madame Pujol.

1410
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,793
Hello.
Good luck.

1411
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:02,189
Madame Pujol, you recognize me?
No.

1412
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:05,193
I worked 40 years
for your dad.

1413
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,470
He loved me very much.

1414
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,358
Oh yeah?
You know,

1415
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,715
I had 11 children.

1416
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,032
11 children!
They've all worked at the factory.

1417
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:18,592
Thank you for what you did
for me and my family.

1418
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:19,909
But it's nothing.

1419
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,036
Goodbye.

1420
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:23,231
March 12.
I'm counting on you.

1421
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:25,072
Vote Suzanne Pujol.

1422
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:36,149
Is that you, bitch, spreading
propaganda in my factory?

1423
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:39,033
I'd never do
such a thing...

1424
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,629
to go against
your interests!

1425
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,593
If I find out that you're 
the eye of Moscow

1426
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,869
you'll be fired.

1427
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,834
The tribunal will be delighted
to accept my secrets

1428
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,190
about the factory's operations.

1429
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,912
I'm not disturbing you, Suzanne?

1430
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,594
No. I'm finishing reading
this report.

1431
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,831
It's crazy:
They want to scrap

1432
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,798
the Saint-Amand-les-Eaux road

1433
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,552
Can I sleep with you?

1434
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,639
What's got into you?

1435
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,839
Listen, I'm still working...
...and you and I are divorcing.

1436
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:24,231
It will complicate things.

1437
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,790
You're such a pet.
Why don't you go to the 'Bada-Boom'?

1438
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,913
It's closed on Thursdays.

1439
01:26:30,914 --> 01:26:34,114
Just a kiss, then go to sleep.


1440
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:53,468
What are you thinking?
About us.

1441
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,792
An old story.
No.

1442
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:02,193
Remember our honeymoon?

1443
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:07,830
I remember a wild beach
in the depths of Brittany.

1444
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,557
It was a deserted cove.

1445
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,789
The sun was setting.

1446
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,035
The sea was cool.

1447
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:23,514
She seemed so hot
in your arms.

1448
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,314
It seemed so blue
in your eyes.

1449
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:30,069
We were young, beautiful,
heedless.

1450
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,996
We loved each other.

1451
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,039
Why divorce
after all these years?

1452
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,674
What's the point?

1453
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,550
So you'll look at me
differently.

1454
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,513
I do look at you differently.

1455
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:52,517
Tell me something, Robert?
Will you vote for me?

1456
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:00,114
Joëlle Hersant.
Voted.

1457
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,949
Hubert Barbin.
Voted.

1458
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,309
Madame Pilar Sanchez.

1459
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:07,909
Voted.

1460
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,350
Madame Gilberte Pacot.

1461
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,632
André Ferron.
Voted.

1462
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,229
Monsieur Babin!
So how did it go?

1463
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,312
Maurice Babin.

1464
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,278
Voted.

1465
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:24,949
Monsieur Babin

1466
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:29,199
what are your predictions?
Listen, I'm confident.

1467
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,870
Geneviève Michonneau.

1468
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,595
Mademoiselle Dumoulin Nadège.

1469
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,198
Robert Pujol.
Voted.

1470
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:42,475
Going well?
Yes. An upset.

1471
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,272
An upset?

1472
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,471
Madame Joelle Pujol de Morette.

1473
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,630
Voted.

1474
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:55,473
I hope that you will win.
Thank you.

1475
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,390
Hello, Madame Pujol.

1476
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,874
Hello.

1477
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:06,275
Suzanne Pujol.
Voted.

1478
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,474
Your predictions?
No comment.

1479
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,878
Final results are in, mother.

1480
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,511
Leave me alone for a moment?

1481
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:34,914
Sure.

1482
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,960
Hello?

1483
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,234
Good evening, Madame Pujol.

1484
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,074
You've got the result?

1485
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,315
Yes

1486
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,393
Why?
You've not stuffed the ballot boxes.

1487
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,950
Seriously,
you're not too disappointed?

1488
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,633
Not as much as your husband.

1489
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,440
You think so?

1490
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:03,878
Your real opponent
it was not me but him.

1491
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,916
Maybe.

1492
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,872
We can stay friends?

1493
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:13,557
Your new position 'll
make us meet often.

1494
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,273
Of course

1495
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,596
Mostly face-to-face.

1496
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,438
I look forward to it.

1497
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,390
Maman,

1498
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,716
people are beginning to arrive.

1499
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:27,675
Excuse me, I must go.
See you soon, Madame Deputy.

1500
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,348
Very soon, Monsieur Le ...
...Monsieur Mayor.

1501
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,309
Please.

1502
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:54,279
Good evening, everybody.
Thank you for being here.

1503
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:58,877
I ask you kindly
welcome our new parliamentary deputy,

1504
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,270
Suzanne Pujol!

1505
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,398
Good evening.

1506
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,710
SUZANNE! SUZANNE! SUZANNE!

1507
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:15,873
My friends, let me first
thank you

1508
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,833
for electing me in the first round.

1509
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:23,277
I also want to offer,
in all fraternity ...

1510
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,796
We won! We won!

1511
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,031
Yes, we won.

1512
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:32,033
I also want to offer
in all brotherhood

1513
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:35,596
all my respect to our mayor, 
Maurice Babin


1514
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:39,071
and all my friends too.

1515
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:42,270
In this moving victory night

1516
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,870
I can only have but an emotional thought
for my father

1517
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:49,829
who would have been so proud of his daughter.

1518
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:53,755
And it is in his memory
I solemnly declare that I want

1519
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:56,030
me, Suzanne Pujol
born a Michonneau,

1520
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:59,955
to continue Papa's work,
as a benefactor of this city.

1521
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,998
She's divorced the boss?
No.

1522
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,710
I do not care.
She's my boss.

1523
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:09,748
She offered me the job as her
parliamentary assistant... I'm going to Paris!

1524
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,912
My dream today
on becoming your Deputy

1525
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,236
would be to open a huge umbrella

1526
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,675
and keep you
close to me,

1527
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:20,593
to shelter you, to pamper you.

1528
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,951
Because you are all
children, my children.

1529
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,833
Maman! Maman! Maman!
Maman! Maman! Maman!

1530
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,834
That's what I want to be
for you: A mother!

1531
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,395
For 30 years,
I was content

1532
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,870
to keep house for Monsieur Pujol.

1533
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,718
A few months were enough

1534
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,190
to put his factory in order.

1535
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,914
So... so why not try with France?

1536
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:56,072
After centuries
of oppression and slavery,

1537
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,675
women must
regain power.

1538
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:00,512
It's time to return

1539
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:04,355
to the age of matriarchy
and blessed time of the Amazons.

1540
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,310
And I took Mama
for a trophy wife.

1541
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:15,669
If she was, she wasn't a stupid one.

1542
