1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
King's Dream 

2
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,170
I am going to obey the will of the heavens to save the people of the Three Kingdoms.

3
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:36,560
I will take Pyeongyang and receive king Bojang's surrender.

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,120
I will end the tyranny of the treacherous subjects of Goguryeo and

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,300
{\a6}[June, 668]

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,480
I will end the tyranny of the treacherous subjects of Goguryeo and

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,950
save the people of Goguryeo.

8
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,880
Loyal servants of Silla!

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:58,100
I will unite your loyalty to conquer Goguryeo.

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:06,550
I will achieve the cause of unification which I inherited from the former king.

11
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:16,830
I, Kim Yusin, and the officials will support your great cause.

12
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,790
I am appointing you as the supreme commander.

13
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:27,400
Lead our soldiers in conquering Goguryeo.

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:37,020
I swear to conquer Goguryeo and unify the Three Kingdoms.

15
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,640
We swear loyalty to the cause.

16
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:50,030
In lunar June, 668, king Munmu appointed Kim Yusin as the commander and

17
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,560
ordered an attack on Goguryeo with 37 court officials as commanders.

18
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,440
Your Majesty...

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,320
If Goguryeo falls,

20
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:16,580
the Three Kingdoms will become colonies of Tang.

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:34,900
You must fight the Silla-Tang army and protect the Three Kingdoms.

22
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,190
I will remember what you said.

23
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,500
Namsaeng...

24
00:02:48,810 --> 00:03:03,940
You three brothers must unite and protect His Majesty and the court.

25
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:15,310
Unite and defeat the Silla-Tang army.

26
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:26,050
Make Goguryeo the center of the world.

27
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,060
I give you my word.

28
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,320
Heavens...

29
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:56,020
Take my life and protect Goguryeo instead.

30
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,520
Mangniji!

31
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,010
- Father!
- Mangniji!

32
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,270
Father!

33
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,330
- Father!
- Father!

34
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,420
Mangniji!

35
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,150
Yeongae Somun raised a coup and assassinated king Yeongryu.

36
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:27,780
He took the position of mangniji and controlled the court for 24 years.

37
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,960
He died 2 years before the attack in May, 666.

38
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:42,400
He left a will for his three sons to unite and lead the court,

39
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,770
but that wasn't the reality.

40
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,500
Namsaeng took over Yeongae Somun's position,

41
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,860
but Namgeon and Namsan weren't happy that he had all the power.

42
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,360
While Namsaeng was patrolling the border area, they drove him out.

43
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,510
Namsaeng barely escaped Goguryeo and wanted to regain his power.

44
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:15,230
He surrendered to emperor Gaozong and asked for reinforcements.

45
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,560
Despite the struggle for power by the three brothers, King Bojang was

46
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,580
still a king who was like a scarecrow.

47
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:32,180
Goguryeo was showing signs of falling.

48
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,580
Goguryeo is in trouble because of the fight by the three brothers.

49
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,040
The oldest son surrendered to me.

50
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,890
This is a perfect chance to conquer Goguryeo.

51
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:55,860
I am appointing the duke of Ying as the supreme commander.

52
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,150
Conquer Goguryeo and achieve our long-cherished ambitions.

53
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:06,200
I attacked Goguryeo with the former emperor.

54
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:13,070
It was a great regret for me that we weren't able to conquer Goguryeo then.

55
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:21,820
I am honored to have another chance.

56
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,680
Has the king of Silla replied to my request to rush an attack?

57
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,120
He appointed Kim Yusin as the commander of the army.

58
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,330
He is going to Hanseongju with 200,000 soldiers.

59
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,800
He will advance to Pyeongyang with the soldiers in Ungjin.

60
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,080
Kim Yusin is in command...

61
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:54,940
If Silla gains control of the army again, my cause to conquer Goguryeo will be ruined.

62
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:04,500
I will not let Kim Yusin take command, so don't worry.

63
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,480
I will believe in you.

64
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,660
Conquer Goguryeo and make our wish finally come true.

65
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,240
Tang camp near Hanseongju

66
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:27,850
The emperor is sending the duke of Ying as the supreme commander.

67
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,780
We should advance to Pyeongyang around the same time.

68
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:38,570
The Silla army wil advance under the command of the daegakgan.

69
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:49,030
The emperor was concerned about Yusin being the commander.

70
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:55,840
He is the greatest general of Silla. Why should he be concerned?

71
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,880
I have respect for Yusin.

72
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:06,320
But the duke of Ying led in the attack on Liaodong before.

73
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:15,690
If they fight over command of the Silla-Tang army,

74
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,120
we will end up fighting amongst ourselves and there will be trouble.

75
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,660
What?

76
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,410
Are you saying the daegakgan shouldn't be in command?

77
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,140
I will not give such an order.

78
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,530
I don't care how high a reputation the duke of Ying has.

79
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,210
The daegakgan is the only person who can conquer Goguryeo.

80
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:44,220
If Yusin insists on command of the Silla-Tang army,

81
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,690
the emperor ordered that we attack Goguryeo by ourselves.

82
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,270
What?

83
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:56,180
He gave such an order?

84
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,420
Your Majesty, it makes some sense.

85
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:07,120
If the Silla and Tang armies fight over command,

86
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,380
there could be more trouble like before.

87
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,540
You should consider that.

88
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,940
Yusin, did you hear?

89
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,260
According to a vision in Goguryeo, an 80-year-old general will cause

90
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,120
the fall of Goguryeo 900 years after it is founded.

91
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,460
The is the 900th year.

92
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:38,550
You will be eighty soon. It looks like the prophecy will come true.

93
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,400
Since Yeongae Somun gained control,

94
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,380
the court and nobility were busy trying to please him.

95
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,720
They tried hard to stay on his good side.

96
00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:01,130
He united public opinion and the country seemed strong.

97
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,570
But royal authority was lost and

98
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,580
the custom of giving advice for the country disappeared.

99
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,810
After Yeongae Somun died, public opinion was divided and

100
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,850
the three sons fought over power.

101
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,730
Namsaeng asked the emperor of Tang for help to regain power.

102
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:32,870
He is going to help Tang make an attack on Goguryeo.

103
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,950
If royal authority is lost and treacherous subjects take power,

104
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:49,580
a country will fall just like that no matter how powerful it is.

105
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:01,030
Will Li Shiji concede command of the allied forces?

106
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:07,700
The daegakgan has to be in command for a victory.

107
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:13,410
Nobody could command the army better.

108
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,640
Li Shiji has a high reputation.

109
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,200
He will not concede command easily.

110
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,800
If he doesn't, we will just gain command with power

111
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,150
like we did with Su Dingfang.

112
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,170
What are you worried about. Right?

113
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,380
I will take the lead and dampen their spirits.

114
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,880
His Majesty isn't letting it show,

115
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,980
but I heard he is concerned there might be trouble over this matter.

116
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,840
Your Majesty, the daegakgan is here to see you.

117
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:17,190
I wanted to talk to you.

118
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:24,250
I heard you are concerned over the command of the Silla-Tang army.

119
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,240
Don't worry.

120
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:32,910
Nobody can conquer Goguryeo except for you.

121
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,580
No matter what the emperor of Tang says,

122
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,070
you are the only person who can lead the army.

123
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:50,020
I would like to step down from the position of commander.

124
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,770
Why are you saying that?

125
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:01,670
Goguryeo might be divided now and public sentiments might have turned,

126
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:09,100
but it is a country that was powerful for centuries.

127
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,950
If I fight over command with Li Shiji at this point in time,

128
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:24,090
the fight amongst ourselves could annihilate the Silla-Tang army.

129
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:30,310
I will return to Seorabeol and pray for a victory.

130
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,630
Please consider my wishes.

131
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,370
You made a difficult decision to lessen my burden.

132
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:58,740
I don't know how to repay your great loyalty.

133
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,030
Thank you.

134
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,230
I'm taking a step back now,

135
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:17,620
but after Goguryeo is conquered and we have to fight the Tang army,

136
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,770
I will take the lead.

137
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:31,280
I will order you even if you refuse.

138
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:47,300
We know you gave up command for a victory.

139
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:57,350
We will respect your intentions and be sure to conquer Goguryeo.

140
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,560
Loyal generals of Silla.

141
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:07,090
I beg you not to fight to achieve merit.

142
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:14,810
Fight without fear to achieve the cause of unification.

143
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,830
I do not doubt your loyalty.

144
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:28,380
Your names and merits will be engraved on the foundation of unification.

145
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,390
The Tang army has advanced to Yeongnyusan with Namsaeng in the lead.

146
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,580
The Silla army will join the Tang army in Pyeongyang.

147
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,620
What will we do?

148
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,940
Your Majesty, don't worry.

149
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,720
Li Shiji is a weak 80-year-old man and

150
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,530
the Silla army is like a tiger without teeth without Kim Yusin.

151
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:02,030
If we attack the Silla-Tang army first, we should be able to defeat them.

152
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,000
I will take your advice.

153
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,640
Namsan, lead the elite soldiers.

154
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,010
Go to Sacheonseong and defeat the Silla army.

155
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,940
You must not let them join the Tang army.

156
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,170
I will obey your command.

157
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,760
Do not retreat!

158
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,990
Noe Eumsin!

159
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:25,930
I will kill you and get revenge for the innocent people of Bukhansanseong.

160
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,960
Shoot arrows!

161
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,300
Attack!

162
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,360
Namsan is fleeing! After him!

163
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:55,260
You should have fought with your soldiers. Why did you return by yourself?

164
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,770
The Silla army was too strong.

165
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,250
Quiet!

166
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,380
You should have fought to your death.

167
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:09,460
Why did you return defeated? You are disgracing father and me.

168
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,280
That's enough.

169
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,540
There are victories and defeats in every battle. Don't blame him too much.

170
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:24,380
We need a plan to defend against the Silla-Tang army.

171
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,090
Return to your quarters and reflect.

172
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,640
If we can keep the gate closed for 3 months before winter,

173
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,850
they won't be able to withstand the cold.

174
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:52,590
I will not let the Silla-Tang army take our capital.

175
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,650
Tang camp at Yeongnyusan

176
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:10,900
I heard the Silla army defeated Namsan's soldiers at Sacheon.

177
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:18,490
Today's victory should have dampened their spirits a bit.

178
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,110
We should use the energy of this victory and

179
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,470
take the Goguryeo palace right away.

180
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,400
The Silla army will take the lead and break down the gate.

181
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,770
When I tried to conquer Liaodong

182
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,070
I attacked Ansiseong because our army was greater in number.

183
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:45,310
We were defeated and I still can't forget the humiliation.

184
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:53,660
The fortresses of Goguryeo are impregnable and can't be take just with more soldiers.

185
00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:02,140
Pyeongyangseong will be difficult to take even with 1 million soldiers.

186
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,700
Is there another way to take Pyeongyang?

187
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,050
He is going to continue to surround Pyeongyangseong and

188
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:15,800
wait for them to get exhausted and surrender.

189
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
It will be winter in 3 months.

190
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,780
We will run out of military rations.

191
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,410
We should attack swiftly.

192
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,700
He is right.

193
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,750
There is plenty of water in the capital and they have rations for a year.

194
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,300
They will not come out of the fortress to fight.

195
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,770
What?

196
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,570
Did you forget that I am in command?

197
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:45,860
I made my decision. Just follow my orders!

198
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:57,060
Why do you look worried?

199
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,690
Are you upset that you didn't go to Goguryeo?

200
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:13,990
I might be here in Seorabeol, but if the soldiers I trained conquer Goguryeo,

201
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,270
it will be a victory for me, too.

202
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,640
Then what is wrong?

203
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,000
I am concerned that Li Shiji won't attack swiftly and

204
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,050
fail by using a strategy of surrounding Pyeongyang.

205
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:40,450
If the battle lasts long, the people will suffer from providing military rations and

206
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:46,110
the people of Goguryeo will suffer because of the battle.

207
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,550
It will just be the people who suffer.

208
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:58,430
The duke of Ying fought many battles. I'm sure he will fight wisely.

209
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:06,720
He suffered a huge defeat when he recklessly tried to attack Ansiseong.

210
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,740
He will be careful this time.

211
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,470
Then our attack will go to waste.

212
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,030
Father.

213
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,080
Come in.

214
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,310
Did you want to see me?

215
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,530
Yes.

216
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:38,120
Wonsul, take this letter to your uncle in Pyeongyang.

217
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,580
It is urgent, so go quickly.

218
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,200
Yes, father.

219
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,390
Silla camp near Pyeongyangseong

220
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,790
Yusin said we had to attack swiftly.

221
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:02,600
That old man is being stubborn. What will we do?

222
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,280
How about attacking on our own?

223
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,140
The Tang army is in command.

224
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,200
If we attack, we will be punished for disobeying military law.

225
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,660
The Silla commanders will be dismissed

226
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,770
and the soldiers will becomes shields for the Tang soldiers.

227
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,680
He is right.

228
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,570
It won't do us any good to upset the duke of Ying.

229
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,950
Uncle!

230
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,670
Uncle.

231
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,290
Wonsul, what brings you here?

232
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,890
Father said to give you this letter.

233
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:49,250
I am giving an order as the commander of the Silla army.

234
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,950
You must take Goguryeo before winter comes.

235
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,760
If Li Shiji uses a long-term strategy of surrounding Pyeongyang,

236
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,150
collude with someone in the Goguryeo palace.

237
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:07,810
Have them open the gate and attack.

238
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,520
May Buddha have mercy.

239
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,660
Buddhist priest.

240
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,830
You're...

241
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,830
Sh.

242
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:41,060
You want me to advise His Majesty to surrender?

243
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:48,440
The Silla-Tang army will not retreat until he surrenders.

244
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,480
Even if winter comes, Silla will continue to send military rations.

245
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,560
The Silla-Tang army will not retreat.

246
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,000
What will you do?

247
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,500
Are you going to watch Pyeongyang turn into ashes and

248
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,780
let the people of Goguryeo be slaughtered by the Silla-Tang army?

249
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:18,880
Or will you advise the king to surrender to prevent unnecessary sacrifices?

250
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:31,000
Even if His Majesty wanted to surrender, the mangniji won't let him.

251
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:37,180
If you open the gate for us when the Silla-Tang army attacks,

252
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,090
we will kill the mangniji.

253
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:47,860
Please do this to save innocent lives.

254
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:59,740
You want me to surrender to prevent innocent people from dying?

255
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:06,950
If you make a decision, Namsan will relay your wishes to the Silla-Tang army.

256
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:19,400
Kung Chumo founded Goguryeo. Am I to ruin Goguryeo after 900 years?

257
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,310
If the gate opens, our death squad will charge through.

258
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,670
We will head right to the palace and kill the treacherous subjects.

259
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:41,860
You should lead the army in defeating the Goguryeo army.

260
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,620
Will the king of Goguryeo surrender?

261
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,730
We don't know, but Buddhist priest Sinseong promised to

262
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,690
communicate secretly with us.

263
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,530
The gate will definitely open.

264
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,340
Supreme commander!

265
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,120
Namsan is surrendering.

266
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,680
Namsan, what brings you here?

267
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,200
I am here with His Majesty's order to surrender.

268
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,730
The king of Goguryeo decided to surrender?

269
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,940
Yes.

270
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,400
He sent me to tell you.

271
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,830
I'm glad you came.

272
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,480
This happened to Goguryeo because of you!

273
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,750
If you didn't surrender to the emperor of Tang and ask for his help,

274
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,540
this wouldn't have happened!

275
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,820
What?

276
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:55,480
This happened because you and Namgeon committed treason and tried to kill me.

277
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,870
Why are you blaming me?

278
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,740
Stop it!

279
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:07,110
This happened because brothers fought over power and

280
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,510
caused division in court and public sentiments turned.

281
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,950
Why don't you know that yet? You're still trying to blame each other?

282
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,280
Take them both away.

283
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,440
Yes, sir.

284
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:33,530
It has been confirmed that the king of Goguryeo is going to surrender.

285
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:40,170
We should let the Silla army take the lead and advance to the palace.

286
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:53,090
Is it true that you sent Namsan to surrender?

287
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,720
Yes.

288
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,550
I ordered him to go.

289
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:06,110
How can a king give an order that would lead to the fall of the country?

290
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:13,120
Ever since I took the throne, I was the puppet for the mangniji for 2 years.

291
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,740
Even after he died, I'm being controlled by his sons.

292
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,390
How can I call myself the king?

293
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:31,320
Rather than being controlled by treacherous subjects,

294
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:38,100
I decided to prevent the deaths of innocent people.

295
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,580
What?

296
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,670
Go ahead and kill me.

297
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:51,430
Kill me and take the throne.

298
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,370
Your position is higher than the throne anyway.

299
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,100
You can't do this.

300
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,470
You tried to sell our country to the Silla-Tang army.

301
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,890
You are no longer the king of this country.

302
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:16,820
I will discuss with the court what to do with you.

303
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:21,450
Keep him confined and watch him.

304
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,760
Yes, sir.

305
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:11,610
The mangniji ordered me to pray at a temple.

306
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,360
Open the gate.

307
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,320
I didn't receive such an order.

308
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,160
Are you doubting a Buddhist priest?

309
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,120
Open the gate right now.

310
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,220
I will confirm with the mangniji first. Wait here.

311
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,690
Open the gate!

312
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,980
They are Silla spies!

313
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,240
Let's go.

314
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,360
It's the enemy!

315
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,460
It's the enemy!

316
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,890
Let Heumsun and his soldiers fight here. You have to advance to the palace.

317
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,150
Okay.

318
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:43,620
I will signal Heumsun. Yangdo, advance to the palace.

319
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,620
Advance to the palace!

320
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,650
The death squad opened the gate.

321
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,830
Give the order to attack.

322
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,590
Attack!

323
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,460
What?

324
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,610
The Silla-Tang army invaded the palace?

325
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,940
The south gate is open.

326
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,250
I'll kill them all.

327
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,590
You!

328
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,750
Do not retreat!

329
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,770
That is the mangniji, Namgeon.

330
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,790
Capture the traitor alive!

331
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,700
Heavens...

332
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:34,250
Are you really abandoning Goguryeo?

333
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:56,200
Why are you trying to take your life?

334
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:04,070
You cannot die until His Majesty has questioned you for your crime.

335
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:22,130
Hurray!

336
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,330
Hurray!

337
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,020
Hurray!

338
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,220
Hurray!

339
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,350
Your Majesty, the Silla-Tang army has taken Pyeongyangseong and

340
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,210
the mangniji, Namgeon, has been captured alive.

341
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,290
Is this true?

342
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:08,560
You should hurry to Pyeongyang and receive the king of Goguryeo's surrender.

343
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,400
I will go to Pyeongyang to receive his surrender.

344
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,970
Goguryeo palace

345
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:42,080
I, Bojang, surrender the royal seal of Goguryeo to the king of Silla and

346
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:52,660
the emperor of Tang.

347
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,080
Please be generous and accept my surrender.

348
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:14,710
Bojang, you weren't able to eliminate treacherous subjects and

349
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,380
made the people suffer because of battle.

350
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,670
It is a crime that can't be washed away.

351
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:33,830
But you made it known you wanted to surrender and

352
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,500
prevented the deaths of innocent people.

353
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:46,050
I will accept your surrender and pardon you of your crimes.

354
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:58,240
I am truly grateful for your benevolence.

355
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:11,090
I will pray that you have a peaceful reign.

356
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,430
In September, 668, king Bojang, the last king of Goguryeo,

357
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:30,010
surrendered to the Silla-Tang army and Goguryeo fell.

358
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:39,830
Goguryeo fought the powerful countries of the Central Plain for centuries and

359
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:46,310
even defended itself against the powerful Tang empire,

360
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:52,320
but after Yeongae Somun died and his sons fought for power,

361
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,090
the court was divided and public sentiments turned.

362
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:05,160
In the end, Pyeongyang was taken by the Silla-Tang army and Goguryeo fell.

363
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,010
Silla palace

364
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:21,620
We were able to conquer Goguryeo because the daegakgan humbled himself

365
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,340
for the cause of the Silla-Tang alliance.

366
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:30,070
I am promoting his title to daedaegakgan.

367
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:38,780
I am giving him a special privilege. He will not have to bow to me.

368
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:49,820
I am honored that you are rewarding an old man for his efforts.

369
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:55,670
I will reward the commanders and soldiers with new titles and awards

370
00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:00,350
depending on their merits.

371
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:07,720
I will pardon people and cancel the debts of the people.

372
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:13,790
The court will help me in achieving a peaceful reign.

373
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:27,270
You gave Yusin the special privilege of not having to bow to you.

374
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:35,060
Are you discriminating against your uncles? It's making me jealous.

375
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:43,090
I could give him the throne and have no regrets.

376
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,810
Now I know what my father meant when he said

377
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:54,920
he would rather lose the throne than lose uncle.

378
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:07,120
Crown prince, when you take the throne, remember the daedaegakgan's advice.

379
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,770
Yes, father.

380
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:16,280
It would be nice if the former king was alive to see this.

381
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:23,240
I am sure he will be very proud.

382
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,730
Yes, he will.

383
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:30,840
You achieved a great accomplishment.

384
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:40,770
Your Majesty, only the foundation for unification is set now.

385
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,550
The Three Kingdoms have to stand up to the emperor of Tang together.

386
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:49,080
Only when we do that and Silla embraces the Three Kingdoms will

387
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:55,300
the cause the former king sought be truly achieved.

388
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,440
I will not surrender to the emperor of Tang.

389
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:09,200
That is the wish of the former king and the true cause of unification.

390
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,360
The king of Baekje surrendered and so did the king of Goguryeo.

391
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,140
All I need now is surrender from the king of Silla and

392
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,590
I can declare the Three Kingdoms as colonies of Tang.

393
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:36,340
From my experience with the Silla army, the generals and soldiers are very loyal.

394
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,660
If you go to battle to conquer Silla,

395
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:47,570
the Goguryeo and Baekje rebels will also join them.

396
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:50,850
You should establish a governing office in Pyeongyang and annihilate

397
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:57,940
the Goguryeo rebels first before conquering Silla.

398
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,650
I think you are right.

399
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:10,050
Xue Rengui, I will give you 20,000 soldiers. Go to Pyeongyang and rule Goguryeo.

400
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:13,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

401
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,630
Duke of Ying!

402
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:27,750
Why is the emperor betraying the cause of the alliance to let

403
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,470
the Three Kingdoms carry out their own politics?

404
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:33,850
Why is establishing a governing office Pyeongyang?

405
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:43,650
The only way for Silla to survive is to serve up the Three Kingdoms.

406
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:45,970
What are you talking about?

407
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:51,320
If the king of Silla insists on the cause of the alliance

408
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:54,150
and wants to keep the Three Kingdoms,

409
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:59,920
the emperor will have to order his army to conquer Silla.

410
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:11,650
You should decide whether you want to be a servant of Tang or Silla.

411
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:31,190
The emperor of Tang established a governing office in Pyeongyang and

412
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:34,350
had 20,000 soldiers stationed there.

413
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:41,160
According to the letter sent by Inmun, after he suppresses the Goguryeo rebels,

414
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,610
he will attack Silla.

415
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:57,730
If I declare war against Tang, would that be betraying father's will?

416
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,160
The emperor of Tang is showing his true intentions to

417
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,000
make the Three Kingdoms colonies of Tang.

418
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:11,740
Even the former king would have declared war against Tang.

419
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:26,750
I am declaring the cause of the Silla-Tang army again.

420
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,650
The politics of the Three Kingdoms are for the people of the Three Kingdoms.

421
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:35,920
As the ruler of the Three Kingdoms,

422
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:43,400
I am going to embrace the land and people of Goguryeo and Baekje.

423
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,410
I will break off the alliance with Tang.

424
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:51,850
I will station soldiers in Sabi and Pyeongyang and

425
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,420
drive out the Tang army from the Three Kingdoms.

426
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:01,250
I will not let anyone or anything endanger the Three Kingdoms.

427
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:05,820
In order to protect the people of the Three Kingdoms,

428
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,500
I declare war against Tang.

429
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:17,040
We will obey your command and fight the Tang army.

430
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:32,530
Glory to a righteous battle for unification of the Three Kingdoms!

431
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,470
Glory!
