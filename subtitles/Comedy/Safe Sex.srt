1
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:31,435
I'm going to talk to Parker
about my promotion today.

2
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:37,015
In the worst-case scenario,
you're like two weeks ahead of me...

3
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:40,284
... you get a gorgeous little
apartment in the Marais.

4
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,687
What if I don't want
to live in the Marais?

5
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,317
We could live
somewhere else, then.

6
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,777
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

7
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,404
We could go to Detroit.

8
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:52,488
Detroit?

9
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:54,699
Yeah, you could
meet my mom and dad.

10
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:59,037
You can meet my sister.
She owns a bakery...

11
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,080
... and she will make you fat.

12
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:16,220
I have six hours before I have
to go back to the hospital.

13
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:20,767
You want to go back
into bed with me?

14
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:23,645
I do.

15
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,774
But I got back-to-back
meetings all morning.

16
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,360
Too bad for you.

17
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:31,861
Yeah, I know.

18
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,609
But I got to get in.

19
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:36,407
There's probably already 25 people
lined up outside the door, waiting.

20
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:46,576
I love when you speak French.

21
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:03,518
Satcom check.

22
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,604
Echo Nine Three
Victor Echo Two.

23
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,564
Ops Center.

24
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:10,817
This is safe house 7-R.
We're open for business.

25
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,901
Confirmed.

26
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,653
Any reservations?

27
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:14,904
Nothing in the registry.

28
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,155
Walk-ins?

29
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,158
Not expected.
Reconfirm in three hours.

30
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:20,585
Understood.

31
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,878
Matt?
Your cell, really?

32
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:41,806
Relax, I've got an
encryption packet.

33
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,891
You know me, I never relax.

34
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,060
Watch the cholesterol, old man.

35
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:47,478
You sound like Miriam.

36
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,230
So, what's new in Cape Town?

37
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,398
Nothing, nothing.

38
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,109
I updated my Surveillance Target
Analysis. It's complete now.

39
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,486
Yeah, that's an exit report.
It's not due until you leave.

40
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,531
Exactly... exactly.
And when is that?

41
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,320
- How long has it been?
- Twelve months.

42
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,202
Well, talk to me in another four.

43
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,705
David, I'm dying here.

44
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,749
What's happening
with the post in Paris?

45
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:10,001
One slot, 37 applicants.

46
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:12,420
Every one of them with more
field experience than you.

47
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,380
How am I supposed
to get more experience?

48
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,549
I'm staring at four walls all day.

49
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:19,260
I got passed up on Rome,
then Berlin.

50
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,887
You said yourself,
my evaluation was excellent.

51
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,764
Just put it in front of Whitford.

52
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:25,349
I know he'll see that
I'm ready to go, I'm all in.

53
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:28,144
Matt, I know this has been hard...

54
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,229
... but it's the way the system works.

55
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,875
Look, I'll talk to Whitford about
Paris, but I can't promise anything.

56
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:36,085
Look, I've got to go.

57
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,839
Don't worry,
I'm looking after you, okay?

58
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,533
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

59
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,086
This is not a negotiation.

60
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,408
It's 10 million.

61
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:28,237
You'll get the file, and if the money
is not in the account by 3:00 pm...

62
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,857
... I'll take it to another buyer.

63
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,252
How do we know that
you won't do that anyway?

64
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,363
You don't.

65
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,481
Here you are, sir.

66
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:00,403
Alec, how are you?

67
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:08,995
Petrus, 1972.

68
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:10,930
You look good.

69
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,124
I do, don't I?

70
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,879
So, how are things at MI6?

71
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:22,049
The usual. Same bureaucratic
bullshit and appalling remuneration.

72
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,343
- Life of a government man.
- Mmm-hmm.

73
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:29,557
So...

74
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:37,189
The original file.
Dates, transactions, names.

75
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:38,941
A bargain at triple the price.

76
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:40,902
Take a look.

77
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:42,945
Hmm.

78
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:49,210
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

79
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,698
Tobin...

80
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,842
... what's in that box
is going to make...

81
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,462
... the world a smaller place
for you, for both of us.

82
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,466
I got your account.

83
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,093
You get your cut
24 hours after transaction.

84
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:07,720
Some of our old bosses
aren't going to be happy...

85
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,639
... these files are out in the open.

86
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,450
Do I make you nervous?

87
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,686
- Always.
- Good.

88
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,125
You want her?

89
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,673
Please listen to me.

90
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,167
I had nothing to do with this.

91
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,102
Stop.

92
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:52,927
Let's go.

93
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:05,390
Tobin, you have to believe me.
I knew nothing about any of that.

94
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,566
Did you know if anybody
was following you?

95
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,378
No, I don't think anybody
was following me.

96
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,588
I swear on my life,
Tobin, I had absolutely...

97
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,841
Slow down.

98
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,555
We're going by foot.

99
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,599
Head towards the square.

100
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,001
Move, move, move!

101
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,136
We're heading west.

102
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:43,597
Holland Street.
Move, move.

103
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,550
Excuse me, sir.
Thank you.

104
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,566
My name is Tobin Frost.

105
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,206
Linklater.

106
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,961
When?

107
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,505
Lock down the consulate.

108
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,133
Get me a team in the Situation
Room in five minutes.

109
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,894
I want everything we got
on Tobin Frost.

110
00:14:02,928 --> 00:14:03,819
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,141
- Is it him?
- Yep.

112
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,643
- Whitford know?
- I'm on my way there now.

113
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:22,880
Sir, place your finger in there
until I tell you to stop.

114
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,240
Thank you.

115
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,953
So how long has he been
playing in your backyard?

116
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,872
We're working to get you
that answer right now.

117
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:32,956
Meaning you don't know.

118
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,658
No, meaning we're looking into it.

119
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:37,252
The guy goes rogue,
he spends nine years...

120
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,046
... selling out the Agency
to all takers.

121
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,273
To Russia, China, Iran,
you name it.

122
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,008
The guy is just not
going to prance...

123
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:45,177
... into an American consulate
without good reason.

124
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,873
All right, listen up.

125
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,308
Everybody off the phone.

126
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,105
Tobin Frost has just
waltzed his way...

127
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,749
... into a US Consulate
in Cape Town, South Africa.

128
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,776
Now this man,
without question...

129
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,986
... is one of the most notorious
traders that we've got.

130
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:04,988
Errington, call up
his background profile.

131
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,744
Tobin Frost was recruited
into the Agency in 1984.

132
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:13,872
He tested off the charts in aptitude
for psychological field work.

133
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,668
His first assignment was
in Lebanon, in January, 1985.

134
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,129
Three months later,
he captured and flipped...

135
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,505
... a high-ranking
Hezbollah leader.

136
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:23,715
Over the next several years...

137
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,511
... Frost successfully questioned and
recruited many high-value individuals.

138
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,514
He became known as an expert
manipulator of human assets...

139
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,434
... and he literally rewrote
Agency interrogation protocols.

140
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,018
Frost served in many
active theaters...

141
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,938
... including Libya
from 1995 to 1998...

142
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,690
... Jordan, 1998 to 2000.

143
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,358
During his tenure in Jordan...

144
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,418
... Frost was suspected of leaking
information to Mossad...

145
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:45,329
... but nothing was confirmed.

146
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,948
Ten years ago, Frost went off
the reservation completely.

147
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,992
He currently has no allegiances...

148
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,703
... and is wanted for espionage
on four continents.

149
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,582
His last known sighting
is Hamburg, Germany, in 2011.

150
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,918
You know, Harlan, we should
interrogate Frost now.

151
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,420
Sweat him for everything he's got.

152
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,505
Once he's stateside,
we have fewer options.

153
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,632
I have an interrogator in Yemen,
can be there in eight hours.

154
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,926
I already have a team in Jo'burg
that can be there in two.

155
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,915
We'll take Frost to the safe house,
interrogate him there.

156
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,805
My people are fully
capable of handling this.

157
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,682
This is Tobin Frost.

158
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,395
We'll go with Jo'burg.

159
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,357
Okay.

160
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,806
You must turn around.

161
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:34,745
Help.
Help.

162
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,083
Accident.

163
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,221
Housekeeping.

164
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,423
We have a last-minute reservation.

165
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,099
ETA for check-in?

166
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,727
Sometime tonight.
Freeark Insurance.

167
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,803
Got it.

168
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,528
- Hello.
- Hey.

169
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,612
Hey, where are you?

170
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,156
Parker just handed me
his oversight papers to finish...

171
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,825
... and his daughter Chloe's got the
measles, can you believe that?

172
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,619
How long are you
gonna be out for?

173
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,038
I don't know... I don't know.

174
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,748
Okay. Well, look,
I'm gonna dive into this...

175
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,459
... and then hopefully I can
meet up with you later, okay?

176
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,794
Yeah, that sounds good.

177
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,003
Hey, hey...

178
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,315
I love you.

179
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,883
I love you, too.

180
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,302
- Bye.
- Bye.

181
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,428
Extraction team is in the air, sir.

182
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:51,071
They should be on the
ground within the hour.

183
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,574
I want that team in and out of
the city in less than 12 hours.

184
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:54,992
We're not even
supposed to have...

185
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,660
- ... a presence in Cape Town.
- Yes, sir.

186
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:01,832
Any communications about Frost's
whereabouts are strictly need-to-know.

187
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,676
Sir, the extraction team is
en route to the consulate now.

188
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,183
Who's reaching out to 7-R?

189
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,435
Richards, ma'am.

190
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,936
I want the housekeeper briefed.

191
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,022
High-priority target is coming in.
I want the house quiet.

192
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,416
Under no circumstances
should there be...

193
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,125
... any communication
until the team has left.

194
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,401
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,141
Yeah?

196
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,309
Do you have a room?

197
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:03,644
- Account?
- Daniel Kiefer.

198
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,563
Freeark Insurance.
K-I-E-F-E-R.

199
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:10,942
Kiefer. Freeark Insurance.
K-I-E-F-E-R.

200
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,027
You are a go.

201
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,071
You're good to go.

202
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,189
- Hi, I'm Weston.
- Guest room?

203
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,883
It's right around the corner.
Two rights and a left.

204
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,548
All the way back.

205
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,992
That's Tobin Frost.

206
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,470
Stay with him.
Let's go download our gear.

207
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:04,554
Yes, sir.

208
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,269
Linen closet?

209
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,446
Down the hall.
Just right at the end there.

210
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,192
Kill all the surveillance
cameras in this room.

211
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,286
My name is Daniel Kiefer.

212
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,107
We were at The Farm together.

213
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,011
Technically,
you were a year ahead.

214
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,434
I'm here to make you
aware of your rights.

215
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,812
You're being held under
a National Security Directive...

216
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,606
... which means you have none,
but you know that.

217
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:13,690
Six-hundreds.

218
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,611
The towels,
you need six-hundreds.

219
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:21,198
Those are 350, 375-gram weight.

220
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,868
You're gonna need six-hundreds.

221
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:33,376
I want to know the reasons
for you being in Cape Town.

222
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:38,298
I want you to name your
resources, contacts, assets...

223
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,800
... everybody you've done
business with...

224
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,468
... traded intel with,
sold secrets to...

225
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,262
... in the nine years since
you betrayed your country.

226
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,308
Absolutely.
Anything you want, Daniel.

227
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,651
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
lasted 20 seconds.

228
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,945
They had six-hundreds.

229
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,490
Is this legal?

230
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,100
Bring him down.

231
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,526
Bring him up.

232
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,809
How long was that?

233
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,235
All right, take him down.

234
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,171
Bring him up!

235
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,063
Get me a knife.

236
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:06,104
Miller?

237
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,164
Get in there with Frost.

238
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,666
Sir, all the security cameras
are down.

239
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,909
- Reboot. I wanna see what's out there.
- Copy that.

240
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,003
Let's go, boys!

241
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,214
Go, go, go, go!

242
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:26,850
Let's go, move!

243
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,766
Velez, take this corner.

244
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,294
Ericksson, get the back elevator.

245
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,776
Pope, what do you got?

246
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:49,155
Sir, I see approximately 12
heavily armed men in perimeter two.

247
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,825
Okay, gents!
Work fore to aft.

248
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,868
Two-by-twos.
Perimeter two.

249
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,293
- Greer?
- Sir!

250
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,879
- Ericksson?
- Yes, sir.

251
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,206
Velez?

252
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:08,809
Velez?

253
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:10,585
I'm good!

254
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,680
Let's go, fellas.

255
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,033
- Incoming!
- Grenade!

256
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,293
Greer!

257
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,013
Step-slide!
Start walking back!

258
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,682
Velez!
Three-round bursts!

259
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,474
Velez, where's Greer?

260
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:15,909
He's over there, sir.

261
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:17,619
Go, son.

262
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,222
This ain't a test.
This is the real thing.

263
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:34,777
What are you gonna do?

264
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,446
You don't wanna try me.

265
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,022
- Magazine!
- Let's go.

266
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,947
Velez, stay there!

267
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:55,949
Listen to me, stay there!

268
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,580
Son of a bitch!

269
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,006
Miller!

270
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,010
Miller!

271
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,888
Hey!
Get in here!

272
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,685
Hey, hey.
Take these.

273
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:25,186
Go watch him.

274
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:43,910
Hey, they're here for me,
but they want me alive.

275
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,098
You, they'll kill.

276
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,120
You got one in the chamber?

277
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,176
It's okay.

278
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,996
I remember my first posting.
Rio de Janeiro.

279
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,849
A house like this.
Beautiful women.

280
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,351
Not one single visitor, but
I remember rule number one.

281
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,617
You are responsible
for your houseguest.

282
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,721
I'm your houseguest.

283
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,763
The clock is ticking.
They gave you the keys.

284
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:21,101
- Do your duty, son.
- Shut up. Let me think.

285
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,390
You want to be the guy
that lost Tobin Frost?

286
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,423
Tick-took, tick-took,
tick-took, tick-took.

287
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,623
Where is Frost?

288
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:25,857
We're leaving.

289
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,793
Where is he?

290
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,638
Stay here, stay here!
Wait! Don't move!

291
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,310
Hey, hey, hey!

292
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:17,900
Go!

293
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:22,447
Get in the trunk.

294
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,232
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, get in.

295
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,534
- The trunk?
- Get in the trunk now!

296
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:49,624
No!

297
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:11,996
- Ops Center.
- Echo Three Victor Echo Nine.

298
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,039
Go ahead.

299
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,600
This is Weston. 7-R's been hit.
Everyone's dead.

300
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,835
I need you to repeat that, please.
Say again.

301
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,947
Kiefer, his team, everyone,
they're all dead.

302
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,182
Stand by.

303
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:25,510
Transferring.

304
00:31:27,111 --> 00:31:28,438
It's the house.

305
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:31,766
- Linklater.
- This is Weston.

306
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,309
The safe house
has been breached.

307
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,145
What's your location?

308
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:40,917
I'm eastbound on Albert Road.
I'm just passing Woodstock.

309
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,754
I want eyes on this.
Real-time sat feed.

310
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:47,015
What's the location of the guest?

311
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:48,900
We escaped.

312
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:50,952
Clarify.
Do you have the guest?

313
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,228
Yes, we escaped!

314
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,747
Look, I can make it
to the consulate.

315
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:56,082
There's no chance for SDR.

316
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,375
I think I might have
picked up a tail.

317
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,869
We can't have a gun battle
in front of the consulate.

318
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,413
Diplomatic catastrophe.

319
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,006
Where's that satellite feed?

320
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,417
Denied by National Recon.
War theater use only.

321
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,886
Buy us some time.

322
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,115
Do not go to the consulate.

323
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:15,601
Follow protocol Alpha Zero.

324
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,512
Secure the guest
and stay off the grid.

325
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:22,625
Reconnect at 1800 hours.
I repeat, stay off the grid.

326
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,777
Copy, copy, copy.

327
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,963
All right, Cape Town police
have responded to the house.

328
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:40,439
- Confirmed.
- I want the site secured.

329
00:35:40,522 --> 00:35:42,992
- I'm hearing nine dead.
- Initiating damage control.

330
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,727
I'm on it.
Reaching out to NIA now.

331
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,772
The locals are going to
have that house locked off.

332
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:51,817
Check all the traffic cameras,
police reports.

333
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,529
Find out why Frost wanted to go
in that consulate to begin with...

334
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:57,298
... and who in the hell else
might be after him.

335
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,219
We need to get Weston and
Frost out of South Africa.

336
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,955
Now, do we have any tactical teams?
Anything in play?

337
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,486
Yeah, I have assets in Egypt,
but they're in deep.

338
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,835
If I pull them out, that would
compromise two years' worth of work.

339
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,462
I can scramble a team
from Europe or Asia...

340
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:13,556
... but it's going to take
at least 18 hours.

341
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,068
At this point,
Weston is all we got.

342
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:24,934
I need to find out who this
Matt Weston is, right now.

343
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:28,104
Matthew James Weston.

344
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:32,066
Born 02-24-82 to Terry
and Madeline Weston...

345
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,943
... in Port Washington, New York.

346
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,487
An assault arrest, one month after,
both parents and a younger sister...

347
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,197
... were killed in a traffic accident...

348
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,659
... in which his father's blood
alcohol was twice the legal limit.

349
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:45,329
Yale, degree in Economics,
recruited out of Yale law.

350
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:48,624
High marks in analytics
and linguistics at The Farm.

351
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:51,110
Excellent in tradecraft skills.

352
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:54,438
His girlfriend, Ana Moreau,
is a French national.

353
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:58,551
He reported them as having
"close and continuing contact."

354
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:01,512
She's a second year resident in the
oncology department at Groote Schuur.

355
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:02,555
Get in that car.

356
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,765
She accepted a position
with Hotel-Dieu Hospital...

357
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:06,517
... in Paris, starts in two weeks.

358
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,311
No known political affiliations.
She's clean.

359
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,939
I want you to post a car
outside their apartment.

360
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,424
Use back channels.

361
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,503
And get NSA to cross-check
their telephone records...

362
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:18,287
- ... and their e-mails, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

363
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,753
You know, it would be easier
if I knew where we were going.

364
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:36,706
You just drive, all right?
Just drive, middle lane.

365
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,057
All right.

366
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,528
Hey, what are you doing?
Middle lane.

367
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:47,667
- Just drive around.
- All right. I'm driving.

368
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,356
Nice to know who you're talking to.
What's your name?

369
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:56,609
You crushed my windpipe.

370
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:58,594
Well, you locked me
in the trunk.

371
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,441
Come on, you're not NOC.
You're here under your real name.

372
00:38:04,455 --> 00:38:06,494
- What is it?
- Weston, Matt.

373
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:07,504
All right.

374
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,080
How long you been
a safe house keeper?

375
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:11,123
Twelve months.

376
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:12,374
Happy birthday.

377
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,004
Cape Town,
that's low-level detail.

378
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,857
You should have been
out of here by now.

379
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,926
Maybe I requested
the assignment.

380
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:26,397
Or maybe Langley doesn't
trust you with anything else.

381
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:30,743
So what's your plan?

382
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:34,230
Oh, let me guess.
Follow protocol.

383
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,482
Protocol states that
if your house is crashed...

384
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:39,360
... you do an SDR to make sure
no one's following you.

385
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:43,456
Activate your GPS in your Go-Bag,
select another safe house.

386
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,743
You think I'm going to
let you just take me in?

387
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:49,428
I think you need to shut up.

388
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:53,357
I think you need to consider how your
house was attacked in the first place.

389
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,792
Have you done that, Matt?

390
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:00,840
They followed Kiefer. They
followed him from the consulate...

391
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,107
... and that's how they
found the safe house.

392
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:03,717
Come on, you don't really
believe that, do you?

393
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:06,804
How did they know I was near
the consulate in the first place?

394
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:10,641
Hmm.

395
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,061
But I like this, you know.
You and me, figuring shit out.

396
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:16,764
Like the Hardy Boys.

397
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,193
That house was a secure location.

398
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:22,611
Whoever crashed it...

399
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:26,716
... didn't stop by a gas station and ask
for directions to the nearest safe house.

400
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,243
They were invited.
Someone told them, Matthew.

401
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,579
Think about it.
Someone you know.

402
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:34,515
So you better ask yourself,
can you trust your landlord?

403
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,342
Go ahead, you're not
going to get in my head.

404
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,636
I already am in your head.

405
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,546
They're going to
isolate you, Matt.

406
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:41,922
They're going to be real
nice to you at first.

407
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:44,717
They're going to put their arm
around you and tell you things like...

408
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,803
... "You did a decent job, son.
We'll take it from here."

409
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,305
That's when you know
you're screwed.

410
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,391
Forget about me.
They're going to focus on you.

411
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,685
They're going to try and make
a connection between you and I.

412
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:56,729
So that if this all goes wrong...

413
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,397
... they'll have something
to fall back on...

414
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,858
... in their little Senate hearings.

415
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:06,497
I'm not your only enemy tonight.

416
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:10,743
So, it's someone in-house.

417
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,995
It's the only way this thing
could have happened.

418
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,505
We were completely
buttoned up.

419
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,918
I want a list of everyone
who knew about this.

420
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,702
Backgrounds, affiliations...

421
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,213
... particularly any
connections with Frost.

422
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,841
Every movement right up
until this operation.

423
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,652
Your extraction team,
how long had they been together?

424
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:32,473
My team had been together
six months. Why?

425
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,434
Well, I'm just trying to
get my head around this.

426
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,188
That will do, thank you.

427
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,713
- Hello.
- Hey.

428
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:31,700
- Baby, where are you?
- I'm all right. I'm okay.

429
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:33,927
I'm okay.

430
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:38,432
I'm sorry I didn't call you back,
I saw your missed calls.

431
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:41,618
- You must be worried sick.
- Is everything okay?

432
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,314
I'm good, I'm good.
Listen, um...

433
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,024
... this sounds so crazy.

434
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,526
We had some threats
against the clinic last night...

435
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:53,672
... so Parker and I, we stayed all night
trying to get to the bottom of it, and...

436
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:56,834
... and I'm sorry that I didn't call
you back. I should have, right away.

437
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:58,660
I was so worried.

438
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:00,045
I know.

439
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:06,126
Can you do me a favor? Can you go
over to the window for a second?

440
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,236
Why?

441
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:09,838
Can you just take a quick
look out the window?

442
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:11,965
I want you to see if there's
anyone out there, any...

443
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:14,134
... any cars that don't belong,
anything?

444
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:16,011
Anyone hangin' around out front?

445
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:19,289
There's a police car.

446
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,685
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry about this.

447
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:26,647
I know this is a lot, but we felt
like it would be best...

448
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,316
... if we didn't go home as a
precaution, and I agree with him.

449
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,110
I know there's nothing to worry
about, but I agree with him.

450
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,527
I think you should just go
to Dena's for a little while.

451
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,306
Just for a few hours,
and I'll call you in a little bit.

452
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,868
And we'll get together, okay?

453
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:48,961
Okay, I'll go.

454
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:55,704
Okay. I love you.
I'll talk to you soon, all right?

455
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:58,053
Don't worry.
Okay, bye.

456
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:23,162
She know what you do
for a living?

457
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:32,671
The girl on the phone.
It was a girl, wasn't it?

458
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:36,542
Maybe it was a guy, I don't know.

459
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:38,035
I don't judge.

460
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:45,736
You can't expect to have
a real relationship...

461
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:47,286
... in our line of work, Matthew.

462
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,206
Don't worry.
She's not going to leave you.

463
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:55,027
See, what happens is,
you try to protect her with lies...

464
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,695
... and then it starts to add up.

465
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:01,033
At the safe house, you said that
they'd kill me to get to you.

466
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:02,576
After a while, even the truth...

467
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:04,912
- Why?
- ... starts to sound like a lie.

468
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:08,003
You have something.
You got something that they want.

469
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,458
- What is it?
- Is she a local?

470
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:10,542
What is it?
Don't worry about her.

471
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:11,927
Oh, it is a girl.

472
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:28,560
You'll keep covering your tracks,
she'll keep believing...

473
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:31,272
... because she wants to,
because she needs to.

474
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:36,585
That's why we exist.
You and me, that's our job.

475
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:43,825
To take advantage of that.
People's desire to believe.

476
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:45,744
To trust.

477
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:57,756
She's not going
to leave you, Matthew.

478
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:02,269
You're going to leave her.

479
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:10,202
I'm not you.

480
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,470
Correct, sir.
We verified it.

481
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:52,653
That is your boy.
You take it.

482
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,107
Everybody, stand by.

483
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,876
Matty, it's me.

484
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:02,354
How are you holding up?

485
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:04,673
I'm all right.

486
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:13,073
Matt, we can't get another
team in for at least 12 hours.

487
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:15,275
Sorry.

488
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:19,338
We've cleared a new safe house
for you outside the city.

489
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:23,731
There's a Go-Bag
located at locker number 256...

490
00:47:23,814 --> 00:47:25,927
... Green Point Stadium
Metrorail station.

491
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:31,558
- The combination is 2-5-1-22.
- 2-5-1-22.

492
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:35,270
Now, the bag's got a GPS in it.
It'll direct you to the safe house.

493
00:47:35,604 --> 00:47:38,198
But you got to be careful,
it's an active location.

494
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:40,084
So, approach with caution.

495
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,781
Matt?

496
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:51,064
Do... do you know
how they found Frost?

497
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:52,554
Do you know
who led them to us?

498
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:56,792
We're working on that.

499
00:47:57,751 --> 00:47:59,386
We're counting on you, Matt.

500
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:02,564
Get Frost to that safe house and
you can write your own ticket.

501
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:05,642
I will.

502
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,596
I will.

503
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:20,565
Left at the light.

504
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,484
To the stadium?

505
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:24,077
Yeah.

506
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:49,761
Hey, scarf.
How much for a scarf?

507
00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:53,540
- Only fifty rand.
- Thanks.

508
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:57,185
Cuff your hands together.

509
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:58,353
- Together?
- Yeah.

510
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:09,264
Out.

511
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:16,059
Are you sure you don't want
to just walk away from this?

512
00:49:16,063 --> 00:49:18,498
- Can't do that.
- Yes, you can. You should.

513
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,030
Move. Go.
Across the street.

514
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:41,012
Going to the game.
I like games.

515
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,315
- Metrorail, straight ahead.
- Straight ahead.

516
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:54,509
Right over there.

517
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:15,700
Let's go.

518
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:41,540
Help! Help!
He's trying to kidnap me!

519
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:42,624
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

520
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,960
He's trying to kidnap me!
Help!

521
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:46,211
He's got a gun!

522
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:50,549
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun right there!

523
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,469
I'm undercover.
I'm undercover!

524
00:50:54,553 --> 00:50:56,721
Calm down, sir.
Everybody, calm down!

525
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:08,567
Get down!
Get down!

526
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:12,028
All right!
Okay! Okay!

527
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:30,338
Get him up.
Get up.

528
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:32,023
Ow, ow, ow!

529
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:39,848
I'm an American citizen. I don't
know what he wanted from me.

530
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,018
Just calm down.

531
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:10,587
Hey, hey, hey. I'm a police officer.
I'm from America.

532
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,048
I arrested this man.
His name is Tobin Frost.

533
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:16,017
- Where did you take him?
- He's in the infirmary.

534
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:23,433
There, there, there!
Is that it?

535
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:27,395
Top left, second screen from the top!
Look, look, the infirmary.

536
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:32,150
Right.
Go back.

537
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:44,104
Third-tier infirmary, now!
Move!

538
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,347
Third-tier infirmary.
Go, now!

539
00:52:48,308 --> 00:52:49,209
Do you see?

540
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:23,576
Don't move.

541
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:38,751
Frost!

542
00:54:41,571 --> 00:54:42,572
Frost!

543
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:46,309
Frost!

544
00:54:46,618 --> 00:54:47,660
Hey!

545
00:54:49,245 --> 00:54:50,663
Stop!
Stop!

546
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:54,042
Get out the way!

547
00:54:54,534 --> 00:54:55,476
Stop!

548
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:03,426
No!
Stop!

549
00:55:20,193 --> 00:55:21,136
Medic!

550
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:48,163
Drop the gun.

551
00:55:49,097 --> 00:55:52,100
- Drop it.
- I'm responsible for you.

552
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,405
You're responsible for yourself.

553
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:02,343
Get on your knees.

554
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:15,832
Are you going to kill me?

555
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:29,888
I only kill professionals.

556
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:51,367
Height, approximately six feet.

557
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:54,078
Anglo, wearing a stadium
security jacket.

558
00:56:54,162 --> 00:56:57,415
The suspect was last seen entering
Green Point Stadium Metrorail...

559
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:59,626
... stadium concourse.

560
00:57:09,636 --> 00:57:12,763
Sir, we have a thread on what Frost
might be doing in Cape Town.

561
00:57:14,307 --> 00:57:15,808
Uh, can you... can you bring up...

562
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:19,771
Alec Wade.
Fifteen-year NOC at MI6.

563
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:23,107
Sabotage, counter-ambush,
counter-IED tactics...

564
00:57:23,191 --> 00:57:25,234
... until he blew up an op
in Lisbon four years ago...

565
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:26,778
... and was put on a desk,
pushing papers.

566
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,113
Cape Town Police found him
shot through the head...

567
00:57:29,197 --> 00:57:32,033
... high-powered rifle,
14 blocks from the consulate.

568
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,492
Witnesses placed someone
fitting Frost's description...

569
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:35,995
... in the car at the time
of the shooting.

570
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,456
And we think, what?
That they were working together?

571
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:41,559
They ran joint operations
in Hamburg in the mid-'80s.

572
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:44,771
Frost's last sighting
was in Hamburg, 2011.

573
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:47,231
And what are the Brits
saying about Wade?

574
00:57:47,254 --> 00:57:48,967
Officially, they're saying nothing.

575
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,093
Unofficially?

576
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:52,428
He's been the subject of a
five-month internal investigation.

577
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:55,306
- They think he's been trading intel.
- Hmm.

578
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,475
So what the hell
did Wade leak to Frost...

579
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:00,628
... that was so important it was
worth killing six of our men?

580
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:07,919
I want more details from MI6.
Call in every chit you got.

581
00:58:08,102 --> 00:58:08,945
Yes, sir.

582
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,322
And David, I want an
internal investigation...

583
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:13,817
... into Daniel Kiefer and his team.

584
00:58:58,161 --> 00:59:00,388
I've got Weston calling in
for David Barlow.

585
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:06,845
- I lost him.
- Frost?

586
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:08,321
Yeah, he's gone.

587
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:10,965
After I picked up the GPS,
he created a diversion...

588
00:59:11,049 --> 00:59:12,717
... took out a couple of cops
at the stadium.

589
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,177
Any idea where he's headed?

590
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,636
Not exactly, but I will.

591
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,056
This is Linklater.
You said he took out two cops?

592
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:19,849
Matt, you're on speaker.

593
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:24,312
Yes, ma'am.
At the Green Point Stadium.

594
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:26,731
... involvement in
a possible kidnapping.

595
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:29,776
The suspect is being described
as a white male of medium build.

596
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:32,153
Stadium police is reporting
you shot a cop.

597
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,322
I returned fire in self-defense.

598
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:37,425
The fact of the matter is,
Frost is on the loose.

599
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:39,410
I've spent the last
14 hours with him.

600
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:41,829
He might have said or done
something that could lead me to him.

601
00:59:41,913 --> 00:59:45,683
You are to stand down,
proceed to the consulate...

602
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:48,160
... and present yourself for exfil
and debrief. Acknowledge.

603
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:50,513
By the time I'm debriefed,
Frost will be gone.

604
00:59:50,546 --> 00:59:53,369
I've spent 12 months researching
every square inch of this town.

605
00:59:53,422 --> 00:59:56,094
I will find Frost
and I'll deliver him.

606
00:59:56,177 --> 00:59:58,696
Weston, this is
Harlan Whitford, son.

607
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,286
Now, you've done a fine job,
but we'll take it from here.

608
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:11,993
Understood.

609
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:34,298
Hello.

610
01:00:34,382 --> 01:00:35,800
Sir, I respectfully request that...

611
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,398
... that exchange not
make it onto his files.

612
01:00:37,455 --> 01:00:39,762
He's either incompetent or
he's working with somebody else.

613
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:41,347
Do not make this about Weston.

614
01:00:41,514 --> 01:00:42,890
It was your guys that lost Frost.

615
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:44,642
It was your team that folded
at the safe house.

616
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:47,895
I want both of you on an
airplane to Cape Town.

617
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:52,667
Frost is trying to get out of
the country. Go find his ass.

618
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,434
There you go, baby.

619
01:01:32,899 --> 01:01:34,375
One ticket to Jo'burg.

620
01:01:43,576 --> 01:01:44,577
Thank you.

621
01:02:19,654 --> 01:02:23,400
Police had detained American
NGO worker Matthew Weston...

622
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:26,160
... as a possible suspect
in the shooting.

623
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:28,871
Weston had been
detained earlier today...

624
01:02:28,955 --> 01:02:33,542
... but managed to escape while being
questioned by stadium security officials...

625
01:02:33,668 --> 01:02:36,312
... about his involvement
in the shootings.

626
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,882
The suspect has been described
as a white male of medium build...

627
01:02:39,966 --> 01:02:43,177
... possibly wearing a stadium
security outfit.

628
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:48,900
Baby.

629
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:52,895
Are you all right?

630
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:11,781
I lied to you.

631
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:18,104
About everything.
The NGO, Parker.

632
01:03:19,255 --> 01:03:20,356
My job.

633
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:23,067
My family.

634
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,972
So, who do you work for?

635
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,662
The government.

636
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:38,499
CIA.

637
01:03:38,891 --> 01:03:40,292
No, I don't...

638
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:42,194
I don't do anything.

639
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:46,365
I sit around in an apartment all day.
I answer the phone.

640
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:01,222
I need you to leave.

641
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:04,992
I need you to do that for me.
Okay?

642
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:12,141
Here.

643
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:16,095
This is a ticket to Jo'burg.

644
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:18,300
When you get there,
you go straight to the airport.

645
01:04:18,314 --> 01:04:19,940
There's a 6:00 am flight to Paris.

646
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:21,717
Take this.

647
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:23,986
You take this.
If anyone stops you...

648
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:26,906
If anyone stops you...
If anybody stops you...

649
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,532
Who do you think I am?

650
01:04:28,816 --> 01:04:30,768
- Stop, stop.
- Fuck you!

651
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:33,562
Hey, stop.
Stop it.

652
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:44,015
We broke up a week ago.
You haven't seen me since, okay?

653
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,640
I'm sorry.

654
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:02,416
Just leave.
Please?

655
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,781
- Do you love me?
- Very much.

656
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:11,967
Go... go.

657
01:05:18,499 --> 01:05:19,625
Go.

658
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:45,443
Attention, all passengers...

659
01:05:45,526 --> 01:05:50,197
... Platform 20 for Langa Township
departing in five minutes.

660
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:55,369
Langa Township,
departing in five minutes.

661
01:06:19,602 --> 01:06:22,883
Sir. Someone just logged into our
system using Weston's password...

662
01:06:22,897 --> 01:06:24,965
... accessing his stored files.

663
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,103
It's him.
What the hell is he doing?

664
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:30,946
I'm not sure.

665
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,439
I want to see what he's looking at.

666
01:06:36,452 --> 01:06:37,700
He's pulled an old report...

667
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:40,840
... on surveillance targets living
in the Langa Township area.

668
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:46,421
It's a profile of Carlos Villar,
a Nicaraguan national.

669
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:49,115
He's a known document forger.

670
01:06:49,298 --> 01:06:51,175
Get me a copy
of Weston's report.

671
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:52,101
Yes, sir.

672
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,136
Logged off, sir.
He's gone.

673
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:56,388
An Internet café on Long Street.

674
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:25,404
Like a black Dorian Gray.

675
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,503
That's right.
How you doing, brother?

676
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:30,272
- Come in.
- Yes, sir.

677
01:07:35,778 --> 01:07:36,779
Illana?

678
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:38,472
Hi.

679
01:07:38,556 --> 01:07:39,857
We have a guest.

680
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:45,062
- Illana, good to meet you.
- Joseph, my daughter.

681
01:07:45,563 --> 01:07:47,439
- How are you?
- Hello.

682
01:07:47,523 --> 01:07:48,524
My son-in-law.

683
01:07:51,402 --> 01:07:52,945
May I offer you some tea?

684
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,197
No, we're going upstairs.

685
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:09,336
I remembered.

686
01:08:11,422 --> 01:08:12,881
You even let it breathe.

687
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:21,757
"Too long a sacrifice can
make a stone of the heart."

688
01:08:24,685 --> 01:08:26,895
"O when may it suffice?"

689
01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:30,190
"That is Heaven's part."

690
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:37,382
In the old days, a cheap bottle
of Flor de Cana...

691
01:08:37,455 --> 01:08:41,535
- ... kept us happy all night.
- Mmm. Tastes change.

692
01:08:45,581 --> 01:08:46,982
People change.

693
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:54,173
People don't change.

694
01:08:55,424 --> 01:08:57,176
We grow old.

695
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:59,878
And some of us adapt.

696
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:03,757
And learn how to enjoy
simple pleasures of life...

697
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,670
... like a family, a home.

698
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,289
And for you...

699
01:09:10,731 --> 01:09:12,983
... what's in that glass right now,
for you...

700
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:15,444
... is as good
as it's ever going to be.

701
01:09:18,072 --> 01:09:20,458
One day you'll understand.

702
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:24,887
You got more past
than future, you learn.

703
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:28,640
What is this?
An intervention?

704
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,340
I thought you were dead.

705
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:53,597
So, what brings you to my home
in the middle of the night...

706
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:54,900
... after all these years?

707
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:10,466
Ooh.

708
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:17,898
Papa?

709
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:20,601
- Uh-huh?
- We're going.

710
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:23,871
- Okay, be careful.
- Okay, Papa.

711
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:45,534
What are you going
to do with this?

712
01:10:46,452 --> 01:10:48,312
Make some money.

713
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:49,788
Let me borrow your glasses.

714
01:10:57,296 --> 01:10:58,589
That's it.
Listen.

715
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:03,257
I'm going to need a new passport,
photo ID, driver's license...

716
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,804
... the whole shebang.
Can you do that for me?

717
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:07,956
Yeah.

718
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,143
You sure?

719
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:13,395
Yes.

720
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:22,738
Weston never showed
at the consulate.

721
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:25,240
And he was just
accessing our secure server...

722
01:11:25,324 --> 01:11:28,118
... searching for someone
to create an alias package.

723
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:32,664
He's trying to leave the country.

724
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,875
Or he's going after Frost.

725
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:38,112
Look at what happened
at the soccer stadium.

726
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:40,756
This guy let Frost escape.

727
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:45,769
I think Weston's turned.

728
01:11:46,053 --> 01:11:47,638
I know this boy.

729
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:51,125
He's been looking for
a chance to prove himself.

730
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:53,560
He's trying to bring in Frost.

731
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:58,857
Come on, David.
You're not seeing the evidence.

732
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:12,246
Not my best work...

733
01:12:12,354 --> 01:12:15,749
... but given the pressure
of time, it's passable.

734
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:19,419
It's good. I'll wire you the money
as soon as I get out of town.

735
01:12:19,503 --> 01:12:24,091
Tobin, don't do this.
It's different.

736
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:27,553
You don't need the trouble,
you don't need the money.

737
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:29,371
You can give it...

738
01:12:49,616 --> 01:12:50,576
Carlos!

739
01:12:50,659 --> 01:12:52,077
Illana!

740
01:12:52,286 --> 01:12:53,412
Carlos!

741
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:54,621
Illana!

742
01:12:58,876 --> 01:12:59,918
Carlos.

743
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:03,005
Carlos!

744
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:13,373
Go.

745
01:13:14,308 --> 01:13:15,375
Go!

746
01:13:28,322 --> 01:13:29,423
He's on the roof!

747
01:14:29,925 --> 01:14:30,926
Go, go!

748
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,272
Get in the car!

749
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:30,570
They think they can
come at me like this.

750
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:32,689
Have to do it a whole lot
better than that.

751
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:39,554
Shit!

752
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:54,653
Matt, how'd you find me?

753
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:56,638
It wasn't that hard.

754
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:15,182
Let's go.

755
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:43,969
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

756
01:19:56,876 --> 01:19:58,662
Who do you work for?

757
01:20:18,064 --> 01:20:19,165
Who sent you?

758
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:23,695
Who sent you?
Who sent you?

759
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:26,323
Who?

760
01:20:26,848 --> 01:20:27,833
Vargas.

761
01:20:28,383 --> 01:20:29,384
Vargas.

762
01:20:29,801 --> 01:20:32,412
Who's Vargas?
Who's Vargas?

763
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:37,609
You want to die?

764
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:43,056
Who's Vargas?

765
01:20:47,469 --> 01:20:48,520
Matt.

766
01:20:55,894 --> 01:20:57,145
CIA.

767
01:20:59,606 --> 01:21:02,984
CIA... CIA!

768
01:21:32,514 --> 01:21:33,556
Report?

769
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,775
There was a shootout
in the Langa Township.

770
01:21:36,101 --> 01:21:39,104
Two crime scenes. One at the
residence of Carlos Villar.

771
01:21:39,187 --> 01:21:40,730
He's a document forger.

772
01:21:40,814 --> 01:21:42,399
The other in a nearby tenement.

773
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:44,918
- And where was Frost last seen?
- Tenement.

774
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:48,388
Have fun at Villar's.
We'll meet up later.

775
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:10,618
You were right about Ana.

776
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:14,331
That's her name.

777
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:18,393
Sorry to hear that.

778
01:22:20,728 --> 01:22:25,200
Most case officers get
married three, four times.

779
01:22:27,527 --> 01:22:28,595
You?

780
01:22:31,906 --> 01:22:33,033
Once.

781
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:47,714
You're falling apart over here.

782
01:22:55,555 --> 01:22:58,124
Don't kill innocent people,
Matthew.

783
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:01,945
What?

784
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:12,355
Air traffic controller,
a tiny airstrip in Bermuda.

785
01:23:12,739 --> 01:23:16,242
George Edwart Cox,
I remember that name.

786
01:23:16,326 --> 01:23:18,203
Edwart, with a "T".

787
01:23:19,287 --> 01:23:24,103
My inside officer said that he was
organizing arms shipments...

788
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:27,662
... but he was just an air traffic
controller. He was just a guy.

789
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:30,515
I put a bullet in his skull.

790
01:23:33,927 --> 01:23:37,238
Black Ops came in, they replaced
him with one of their own...

791
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:39,516
... and crashed a Gulf stream
in the ocean that night.

792
01:23:39,599 --> 01:23:43,311
The thing was, the family
that was on the plane...

793
01:23:44,437 --> 01:23:47,815
... the husband,
he was a whistleblower.

794
01:23:48,983 --> 01:23:51,694
The whole thing was about...

795
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:55,323
... stopping him from
testifying about wet works...

796
01:23:56,449 --> 01:23:58,576
... to a congressional hearing.

797
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:04,566
- Is that why you left?
- No.

798
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:10,021
I went back to work the next day
like nothing ever happened.

799
01:24:13,383 --> 01:24:16,453
You practice anything a long
time, you get good at it.

800
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:19,823
You tell a hundred lies a day,
it sounds like the truth.

801
01:24:20,306 --> 01:24:22,442
Everyone betrays everyone.

802
01:24:25,395 --> 01:24:27,430
That's a shitty excuse.

803
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:32,243
Yeah, I used to be
innocent like you.

804
01:24:32,527 --> 01:24:35,321
Wrap myself up in the flag...

805
01:24:42,704 --> 01:24:44,364
I'm going to take you in.

806
01:24:53,298 --> 01:24:54,641
Good for you.

807
01:25:49,062 --> 01:25:50,046
Barlow.

808
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:52,106
Witnesses identified
a pair of men...

809
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,983
... fitting Weston
and Frost's description...

810
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:56,110
... leaving this location together.

811
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:57,487
So he pulled it off.

812
01:25:57,570 --> 01:26:00,448
Weston is aiding
and abetting a fugitive.

813
01:26:00,782 --> 01:26:01,949
You're wrong.

814
01:26:02,033 --> 01:26:04,619
If he's with Frost, he's taking
him to the safe house.

815
01:26:04,702 --> 01:26:06,496
That's where we got to be.

816
01:26:06,954 --> 01:26:08,639
Fine... fine.

817
01:26:08,706 --> 01:26:11,117
Meet me at the crossroads
at Old Malmesbury Road.

818
01:26:38,486 --> 01:26:39,562
Who are you?

819
01:26:40,738 --> 01:26:41,989
You Weston?

820
01:26:43,558 --> 01:26:45,143
Give me the shotgun.

821
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:46,711
What the hell is this?

822
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:48,079
Who are you?

823
01:26:48,579 --> 01:26:50,873
I'm Keller.
Safe house keeper.

824
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,627
Authorization Index, Bravo
Four Seven Oscar Whiskey Six.

825
01:26:55,253 --> 01:26:57,630
Inside.
Let's go.

826
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:08,475
To the left.

827
01:27:11,602 --> 01:27:12,854
Slowly.

828
01:27:13,463 --> 01:27:15,325
I don't know who trained you,
man, but this sure as hell...

829
01:27:15,348 --> 01:27:17,300
- ... ain't protocol.
- Where's the guest room?

830
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:20,486
That's the thing,
we don't really have one.

831
01:27:21,529 --> 01:27:24,449
In there.
In there.

832
01:27:28,369 --> 01:27:31,164
Cuff him, to the pipe.

833
01:27:38,755 --> 01:27:39,964
Out.
Over there.

834
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:41,483
All right.

835
01:27:44,369 --> 01:27:45,611
Control room.

836
01:27:47,138 --> 01:27:49,712
Whatever you say, man.
It's your rodeo.

837
01:28:01,027 --> 01:28:02,670
Call it in.
Let me hear it.

838
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:13,790
Landlord.

839
01:28:13,873 --> 01:28:15,517
My guest is here.

840
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,043
Account?

841
01:28:17,126 --> 01:28:18,336
Abaresque Limited.

842
01:28:20,046 --> 01:28:22,440
- With a guest?
- Yeah, package delivered.

843
01:28:24,091 --> 01:28:27,008
Confirmed.
Pickup scheduled.

844
01:28:27,762 --> 01:28:29,472
They're on the way.

845
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:34,073
Can we at least
put the gun down now?

846
01:28:42,777 --> 01:28:44,879
Thanks, Clayton.
Bye.

847
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:48,708
It's a microchip.

848
01:28:49,492 --> 01:28:50,543
What?

849
01:28:51,652 --> 01:28:54,513
That was my guy from MI6.
Wade got his hands on a microchip.

850
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,041
- And what was on it?
- Only Wade knew.

851
01:28:57,124 --> 01:28:59,869
But I think it's safe to assume
that's why he hooked up with Frost.

852
01:28:59,902 --> 01:29:01,204
To sell it.

853
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,023
Let's get moving.

854
01:29:36,956 --> 01:29:38,357
Long day, huh?

855
01:29:44,422 --> 01:29:47,274
I can only imagine.
Tobin Frost.

856
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:50,428
That man's a legend.

857
01:29:51,262 --> 01:29:52,800
I hope you picked up something.

858
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:54,899
You ain't gonna find
a better education.

859
01:30:04,358 --> 01:30:07,120
This is the most
excitement I've seen.

860
01:30:07,403 --> 01:30:09,906
You're the first guest
I've had in 10 months.

861
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:12,980
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, right?

862
01:30:13,034 --> 01:30:14,827
You got a city posting.

863
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:18,915
Yeah, nightlife, beaches.

864
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:21,467
Little ladies running
around everywhere.

865
01:30:23,878 --> 01:30:24,912
Yeah.

866
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:28,908
I'm jealous.

867
01:30:35,348 --> 01:30:36,641
You got coffee?

868
01:30:36,724 --> 01:30:39,518
- Yeah, it's in the cupboard.
- Where?

869
01:30:39,602 --> 01:30:41,562
- Want me to get it?
- I got it.

870
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:03,080
Why are you in Cape Town?

871
01:34:06,142 --> 01:34:08,769
Tell me now.
Why?

872
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:16,536
What is it?

873
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:19,631
A dirt list, laundry list.

874
01:34:20,614 --> 01:34:24,785
Israeli Intelligence, five years ago,
compiled blackmail intel.

875
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:29,690
Corrupt agents,
German Intelligence, MI6...

876
01:34:29,874 --> 01:34:30,916
CIA?

877
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,710
Yes.

878
01:34:33,919 --> 01:34:35,546
We got to get away.

879
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:38,800
We got to get out of here.

880
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:49,201
Ah... shit.

881
01:35:05,618 --> 01:35:07,870
Don't, don't, don't.

882
01:35:14,126 --> 01:35:17,171
No, don't leave me here, please.

883
01:35:17,296 --> 01:35:18,881
Don't do it.

884
01:36:04,009 --> 01:36:05,094
Matt?

885
01:36:08,138 --> 01:36:09,190
Hey.

886
01:36:12,184 --> 01:36:13,486
How are you doing?

887
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,527
I'm proud of you.

888
01:36:24,655 --> 01:36:26,415
And what you pulled off.

889
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:31,554
You're going to make
a hell of a case officer.

890
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:36,050
Where is Frost?

891
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:37,960
He's gone.

892
01:36:40,587 --> 01:36:45,134
Place is a wreck.
Blood everywhere.

893
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:47,594
Was he injured or...

894
01:36:51,682 --> 01:36:54,235
I guess you know
he killed Keller.

895
01:36:55,436 --> 01:36:56,662
No.

896
01:36:58,731 --> 01:37:00,357
I killed Keller.

897
01:37:08,824 --> 01:37:10,876
Frost killed Keller.

898
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,156
He killed Linklater, too.

899
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:22,704
Did he talk about anything?
Anything he was after?

900
01:37:24,131 --> 01:37:25,691
Anything he might have had?

901
01:37:27,009 --> 01:37:28,360
The file.

902
01:37:29,178 --> 01:37:30,554
The file?

903
01:37:32,348 --> 01:37:34,183
The file that you're on.

904
01:37:39,563 --> 01:37:43,108
Along with a lot of other people.
Important people.

905
01:37:55,454 --> 01:37:56,555
Listen to me.

906
01:37:57,414 --> 01:37:59,666
What would you do...

907
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:02,378
... if someone is watching
your every move?

908
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:06,423
Some maybe you're not proud of.

909
01:38:06,507 --> 01:38:09,768
And you will have some
you're not proud of, believe me.

910
01:38:10,152 --> 01:38:12,596
And then tries to
use it against you?

911
01:38:15,182 --> 01:38:17,351
You do what you have to do.

912
01:38:18,227 --> 01:38:20,346
You do what you have to do.

913
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:28,838
Where is the file?

914
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:40,082
Matt, the file.
Where is the file?

915
01:38:42,751 --> 01:38:44,128
You're a dead man.

916
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:46,563
Yeah, a long time now.

917
01:38:46,713 --> 01:38:47,982
Frost is here.

918
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:52,206
Let's go.

919
01:41:15,445 --> 01:41:16,630
We got him.

920
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:20,392
A hell of a job.

921
01:41:55,986 --> 01:41:57,362
You smell that, huh?

922
01:41:57,904 --> 01:42:00,616
Pinotage. It's a good grape.
Great wine.

923
01:42:00,699 --> 01:42:04,745
Local grape.
Pinotage is great...

924
01:42:12,419 --> 01:42:14,838
I don't want you losing this one.

925
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:18,300
It's worth a lot of money.

926
01:42:21,595 --> 01:42:24,000
You're a good boy, Matty.

927
01:42:26,433 --> 01:42:28,001
You know what you are.

928
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:32,514
Hey.

929
01:42:33,815 --> 01:42:35,834
I know what you're not.

930
01:42:39,905 --> 01:42:41,874
You're better than me.

931
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:50,724
No, it's okay,
just be better than me.

932
01:42:55,337 --> 01:42:57,089
You promise me.

933
01:42:58,507 --> 01:42:59,558
Yeah.

934
01:43:05,389 --> 01:43:07,683
Well, let's...

935
01:43:10,018 --> 01:43:11,228
Let's go.

936
01:43:13,105 --> 01:43:16,208
I just got to get up.
I need to get up.

937
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:19,845
Stay.

938
01:43:22,698 --> 01:43:23,665
Stay.

939
01:43:26,952 --> 01:43:27,903
Hey...

940
01:44:44,613 --> 01:44:47,416
That's exactly as it happened.

941
01:44:52,788 --> 01:44:54,428
Well, obviously
this situation needs...

942
01:44:54,481 --> 01:44:56,833
... to be handled with
a certain amount of finesse.

943
01:44:57,334 --> 01:44:58,960
Has anybody else
seen this report?

944
01:44:59,044 --> 01:45:00,962
No, sir.
Not yet.

945
01:45:02,297 --> 01:45:03,924
Matt, I'm sure this comes
as no surprise...

946
01:45:04,007 --> 01:45:08,637
... but parts of this report are going to
have to be altered for national security.

947
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:11,389
Which parts, sir?

948
01:45:11,473 --> 01:45:12,891
Well...

949
01:45:13,475 --> 01:45:15,519
David Barlow can't
be held responsible...

950
01:45:15,602 --> 01:45:17,479
... for what happened
to the safe house.

951
01:45:18,313 --> 01:45:20,599
We just don't need the scandal.

952
01:45:20,982 --> 01:45:23,485
But, sir, you and I both know
that that's just not the truth.

953
01:45:23,568 --> 01:45:26,154
People don't want
the truth any more, Matt.

954
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:29,115
It's too messy.
Keeps them up nights.

955
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:35,664
I'll tell you what I am
willing to do, though.

956
01:45:36,498 --> 01:45:39,584
I think the Agency has grossly
underestimated you...

957
01:45:39,668 --> 01:45:43,697
... and I'm recommending you
for a senior case officer position.

958
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,482
Provided you still want it.

959
01:45:46,299 --> 01:45:49,127
That's a generous offer, sir.

960
01:45:50,053 --> 01:45:53,565
There's just one thing
you need to clarify for me.

961
01:45:53,949 --> 01:45:54,941
Of course.

962
01:45:56,226 --> 01:45:59,229
Frost may have been
carrying some vital intel.

963
01:45:59,512 --> 01:46:00,647
A file.

964
01:46:01,231 --> 01:46:04,100
I'm not seeing that
anywhere in this report.

965
01:46:11,533 --> 01:46:13,406
What was on the file, sir?

966
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:16,121
Something that, quite frankly,
could be very damaging...

967
01:46:16,204 --> 01:46:18,440
... to the Agency and to our allies.

968
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:25,839
I don't see why Frost would even
mention something like that to me.

969
01:46:31,094 --> 01:46:33,513
No, I suppose he wouldn't,
would he?

970
01:46:37,893 --> 01:46:41,246
You realize, though,
that if that file did leak...

971
01:46:42,689 --> 01:46:45,016
... what would happen
to the person responsible?

972
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,982
That person would
be arrested, sir.

973
01:46:47,085 --> 01:46:48,920
He'd be risking everything.

974
01:46:49,821 --> 01:46:53,658
He'd have enemies in every
intelligence agency in the world.

975
01:46:55,285 --> 01:46:58,530
In the eyes of the CIA,
he'd be just like Tobin Frost.

976
01:47:02,667 --> 01:47:05,357
Frost didn't say anything
about a file, sir.

977
01:47:10,842 --> 01:47:12,177
All right, son.

978
01:47:13,303 --> 01:47:14,888
Take a few days off.

979
01:47:14,971 --> 01:47:16,932
We'll get you started next week.

980
01:47:18,767 --> 01:47:20,101
Thank you.

981
01:47:22,312 --> 01:47:25,473
And uh... think about our
conversation, would you?

982
01:47:25,723 --> 01:47:26,725
Will do.

983
01:47:27,208 --> 01:47:29,069
I'll take it from here, sir.

984
01:47:54,678 --> 01:47:55,929
... and other media outlets...

985
01:47:56,012 --> 01:47:58,848
... received a controversial file
from an anonymous source.

986
01:47:59,057 --> 01:48:01,109
The international intelligence
community is still reeling...

987
01:48:01,222 --> 01:48:03,895
... from the release of so many
highly classified documents...

988
01:48:03,979 --> 01:48:07,482
... and the revelations of widespread
corruption and criminal activity...

989
01:48:07,565 --> 01:48:09,776
- ... at the CIA, the BND, and MI6.
- ... is in an uproar over the lack...

990
01:48:09,859 --> 01:48:11,736
... of oversight given to
British Intelligence...

991
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:14,155
... demanding accountability
of the rogue agents.

992
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:15,991
Officials at MI6
are fully cooperating.

993
01:48:16,074 --> 01:48:17,617
Chancellor Merkel insists
that the BND...

994
01:48:17,701 --> 01:48:19,536
... has already identified
the corrupt agents...

995
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:21,413
... and contained
the intelligence breach.

996
01:48:21,496 --> 01:48:23,081
She has ensured her
international counterparts...

997
01:48:23,164 --> 01:48:25,166
Indictments are now
expected within the week...

998
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:27,794
... and Congress has demanded that
Deputy Director Harlan Whitford...

999
01:48:27,877 --> 01:48:29,796
... testify before
a Senate subcommittee...

1000
01:48:29,879 --> 01:48:31,548
... in an effort to determine
how many people...

1001
01:48:31,631 --> 01:48:33,425
... at the CIA are involved in this...

1002
01:48:33,508 --> 01:48:36,922
... and just how far up
the corruption reaches.
