00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,600
NEW YORK, NEW YORK

2
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,680
Advertising and promotional
expenditures.. .

3
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,080
...of _2,845,OOO...

4
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,600
.. .were reported.

5
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,560
These expenditures were primarily.. .

6
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,120
...by ''primarily,'' l mean about
96 percent of these expenditures...

7
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,240
...were for Richter's
two main retail brands.

8
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,560
These brands made up
over 85 percent...

9
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,480
...of the company profits
in the last fiscal year.

10
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,360
An increase of some 14 percent
from the previous year.

11
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:44,200
This increase is based on sales
of _1 6,800,OOO.

12
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:47,560
Total sales were up only _200,OOO...

13
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,840
...in the last fiscal year.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,440
Even with an increase
in advertising expenditures...

15
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,000
...of _872,OOO.

16
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,280
So while the sales...

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,880
...of Whiz Bam and Cherry Poppie Balls
are up.. .

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,840
...sales for their retail brand,
Chocorama--

19
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,920
Yeah, Smith.

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,560
Gumball.

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,880
Would you repeat that?

22
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,840
Gumball.

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,280
Okay, let's wrap it up for today,
gentlemen. Thank you.

24
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,880
Gumball!

25
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,720
Will you take a look at this for me?

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,880
Here we go.

27
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,520
To him who accepts the challenge.

28
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,640
-Know what he's talking about?
-To him who risks all...

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,440
.. .comes the satisfaction of victory.. .

30
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,360
...and a sense of physical
well-being in return for--

31
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,840
l want you to get this.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,800
ln return for hardship...

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,560
.. .exhaustion, discomfort.

34
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,160
Ponos. Thank you very much.

35
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,560
-Hi, Sam.
-Bannon.

36
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,960
lt's on. We're go.

37
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,840
Look, l've been giving this matter
a lot of thought...

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,960
...and look, you don't
have anything to lose.

39
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,320
l mean, to you this thing is just a stunt.

40
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,520
l've got a posítíon at thís uníversíty.
l've got a shot at tenure.

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,840
All l have to do is stay out of trouble
a couple more years.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,160
l can't risk that.

43
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,880
lt's not a risk.

44
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,720
lt's a challenge.

45
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,800
Hey, get out of the way! What's
the matter with you? Are you deaf?

46
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,160
l can't eat with all this noise going on.

47
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,640
Come on. Let's take him.

48
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,440
Car 3_. come ín.

49
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,880
This is car 34, over.

50
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah. we got a telegram for you clowns.

51
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,560
Does ''gumball'' mean anythíng to you?

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,080
Negative, 1 O-4.

53
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,520
Let's go.

54
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,280
-Beside the point.
-l've got chicken in the oven.

55
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,600
Hi, Oscar.
The kids' clothes are all laid out.

56
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,160
Okay, don't worry.
Just have a good time.

57
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,880
-l will.
-Bye, Oscar. See you.

58
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,520
-Have a good time.
-Kids, be good. Listen to your daddy.

59
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
You'd think she was planning
the D-day invasion...

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,920
...instead of a weekend in the country.

61
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,000
Attentíon. please. All passengers... .

62
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,320
Excuse me. Thank you.

63
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,880
Hi. Smoking.

64
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,640
Be careful. Be careful.

65
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,120
Andy, you know how often my wife
tried to get me to get rid of this car?

66
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,120
Well, that's German machinery for you.

67
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,680
The car outlasted her.

68
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,400
Sedately, Barney.. .

69
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,760
...as befits our years and station in life.

70
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,640
Of course.

71
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,160
Ace Preston. Mr. Guts hímself.
ís ín the whíte car revvíng up.

72
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,840
He wíll attempt the death-defyíng
Russían T-bone.

73
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:06,600
There he goes.
and where he stops nobody knows.

74
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,240
Ladíes and gentlemen.
Ace Preston on the hígh speed.

75
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,120
Go. Ace. go.

76
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,000
Ladíes and gentlemen... .

77
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,280
-What do you say, buddy?
-l didn't have time to change.

78
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,560
-Aren't you excited about this thing?
-No, l'll be glad when it's over.

79
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,920
Well, l don't expect to live forever.

80
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:35,560
Don't worry, kid, you won't.

81
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,880
Excuse me, may l give you a flower?
l am a stranger in this country.

82
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,600
And l've never seen
such a beautiful woman in all my life.

83
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,200
You see, l would like to know,
maybe you could inform me of a--

84
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,800
Here we are, old buddy.
New York, New York. The Big Apple.

85
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,400
l feel ready. l'm pumping up.

86
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,360
l've been pumped up.

87
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,040
Yeah.

88
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,560
Franco.

89
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,440
-Fine, thank you, and you?
-Good.

90
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,560
-How's the bambino?
-She's full of gas. She's wait for you.

91
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,200
Hey, you make a good Italian.

92
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,360
Lieutenant Roscoe?
Mike Pakowsky, N.Y.P.D.

93
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,960
-How are you?
-The car's outside.

94
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
l'll take you downtown now.

95
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,000
l got a brother-in-law in L.A.

96
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,120
Two marties and a double Man.

97
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,320
Gumball.

98
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,200
They're coming in now.
All of them.

99
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,440
l'm gonna stay here on the stakeout.

100
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,600
lt's 9:05.
l'll check in again at 10.

101
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,200
Graves.

102
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,360
ln through that way.

103
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,640
Right through that door
there's a banquet room.

104
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,440
Thank you.

105
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,600
-lt's just a misunderstanding.
-That's what you call it.

106
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,360
l call it a lie.

107
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,040
-lt's after 9:30. That's the deadline.
-Shall we close it up, Mr. Bannon?

108
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,120
Yeah. Put Fred on the door.
l want that room sealed.

109
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,640
Ladies, gentlemen.. .

110
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,720
...you have been selected because
you have the necessary skills.

111
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,080
You are here because you have
the determination to succeed.

112
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,640
Now, it won't be as easy as last year.

113
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,840
There are some who will use
any means to try and stop us.

114
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,040
Some of you won't make it.

115
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,000
For those of you who do...

116
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,920
...there will be no glory, no headlines.

117
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
But...

118
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,520
...just a few magic hours
flat-out against the red line...

119
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,720
.. .with no catalytic converter.. .

120
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,600
...and no 55-mile-an-hour speed limit.

121
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,680
Ladies and gentlemen...

122
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,520
...the Gumball Rally has begun.

123
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,600
For those of you who've never
done this before...

124
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,720
...l think l better go over the rules.

125
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,520
The first thing to remember
is that there are no rules.

126
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,560
The first vehicle to reach the parking lot
at the Q_een Mary in Long Beach...

127
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,640
...is the winner, the unofficial winner.

128
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,960
Because this is an unofficial race.

129
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,240
And so it follows that none of us
are really in this race.

130
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,080
We don't want any civilian involvement.
No accidents, please.

131
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,600
Remember, it's 2900 miles.

132
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,120
That, 34 hours and 1 1 minutes,
is the record.

133
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,840
Set last year by our dear friend
Mr. Bannon.

134
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,040
Now l know we all ought
to get some rest tonight.

135
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,680
But may l?

136
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,240
l'd like to propose a toast.

137
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,960
To internal combustion.. .

138
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,560
...and wind in the face.

139
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,880
You know, l think Roscoe's got a grudge
against you, Smitty, from last year.

140
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,360
Hey, why do l always get blamed
for everything anyway?

141
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,960
Because you're a schemer.

142
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,840
lt's gonna be a lot different
from last year anyway, you know.

143
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,440
Yeah, l noticed.

144
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,040
-You brought a real ringer with you.
-A what?

145
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,680
Well, you know, your friend Franco.

146
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,600
What do you mean?
What's he ever won?

147
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,680
Le Mans, Grand Prix de Monaco,
what does that mean?

148
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,760
He's coming along
because he's a real nice guy.

149
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,520
lt's like trying to kill
a butterfly with a hammer.

150
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:45,640
Oh, stop, will you?
You make me feel ashamed of myself.

151
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:49,960
Oh, Smitty, don't worry.
Sam and l will do our best.

152
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,960
But isn't it funny, though,
sometimes in life when your best...

153
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,560
...just isn't quite good enough,
you know?

154
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,520
-You're still bitter?
-No. No, l'm not.

155
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,920
-Oh, yes, you are.
-No. l'm....

156
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,800
l'm gonna win, that's all.

157
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,240
Don't get overconfident.

158
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,000
Let's flip to see
who takes care of Roscoe.

159
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,920
Oh, yeah, right.

160
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,960
-Tails.
-Wrong.

161
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,840
Oh, no. Why do l always get him?

162
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,240
Take care of him
the morning of the race.

163
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,600
Mr. McAllister, Mr. Donahue.

164
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,880
Here you are, sir.

165
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,440
Barney, l'm hungry.

166
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
-Sorry, sweetheart.
-Bull's-eye.

167
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,360
Hit the trunk, old buddy.

168
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,720
Lookie here. Extra uniforms.
All of them for along the way.

169
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,560
Look at this. Police decals.

170
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,920
All you gotta do
is stick them on the doors.

171
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,800
Hey, give me a hand with the lights.

172
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,400
Give it a try.

173
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,600
Can you imagine?

174
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,000
Do you believe that?

175
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,760
You guys, listen to this.
Look, l been figuring...

176
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,640
...with 200 gallons of gas back here...

177
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,880
...we don't have to make
one damn stop, not one.

178
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,840
-Ever seen anything like this?
-No, nice.

179
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,040
Wait till you hear it run, man.

180
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,160
l got that computer information en route.

181
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,080
The weather and the traffic
and the road conditions.

182
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,680
What's the matter, Jose?

183
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,360
Nothing, Mr. Bannon. l'm okay.

184
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,840
Hey, don't let all this stuff
get you down.

185
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,160
Hey, l'm fine. What do l care?

186
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,560
l mean, if l wanted to go, l could go.

187
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,640
l mean, it's a free country, right?

188
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,520
l mean, this whole race is unofficial,
so l'm as unofficial as you are.

189
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,400
See, if l wanted to go, l'd go.

190
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,400
lf l had a car.

191
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,040
lt's my girlfriend, you see.

192
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,680
She tells me yesterday,
''No more dates on the subway. ''

193
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,680
l tell you something.
In this country, you ain't nothing...

194
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,480
...if you got no wheels.

195
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,280
Oh, l don't know.
You been on the roads lately?

196
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,680
The age of the motorcar is over.

197
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,120
-Hey, is it okay if l take a few hours off?
-Sure.

198
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,680
Okay, kill it. Kill it.

199
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,280
Hurry up. l'm gonna have to redo
everything you've done.

200
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,040
Gee, Mike, what'd you think
this was, a vintage-car event?

201
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,520
Well, Smitty, some things
get meaner as they get older.

202
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,080
Well, it's real cute. Very fast.

203
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,000
Very uncomfortable.

204
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,720
That's good, though. It's macho.
That's good for you.

205
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,080
That old Smitty. You know,
we've been competing in everything:

206
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,960
Sports, school, girls.

207
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,880
Twenty years of competition
can sometimes get out of hand.

208
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,640
Why didn't he buy
the rest of the Ferrari team?

209
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,400
l'm not so sure he didn't.
Hey, where is that Italian flash anyway?

210
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,640
Franco? Hasn't showed up all day.

211
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,280
-He's probably resting up.
-Yeah, getting his plugs cleaned.

212
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,520
l must go now, my darling.

213
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,440
Will you write?

214
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,000
lf l can.

215
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,840
l mean, l never met anyone
who's gone to Borneo.

216
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,600
lt is not a pleasure trip.

217
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,160
Be careful, Franco.

218
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,640
l cannot do the work l must
and also be careful.

219
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,200
-Then be lucky.
-That's better.

220
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,240
This is Red Fox to Barracuda.

221
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,760
Red Fox to Barracuda.

222
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,880
Now, l figure they're gonna leave late
tonight or early tomorrow morning.

223
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,400
As soon as l see them go.
l'll let you know.

224
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,160
And l want roadblocks on every brídge
and tunnel goíng west. Do you copy?

225
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,880
Now, as the contract reads,
no driving after 6 p.m.

226
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,160
Not to exceed 55 miles per hour.

227
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,120
-You're bonded?
-Of course.

228
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,960
Mr. Blakely is a connoisseur
of fine automobiles.

229
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,520
But for California driving,
he's especially fond of this one.

230
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,400
Minga.

231
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,160
You may go.

232
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,880
Sure.

233
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,520
Gently, gently.

234
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,200
Drive carefully.

235
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,840
Jesus. It's a hit.

236
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,160
We still haven't got the food.
What are we gonna eat?

237
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,480
Franco, where you been? Your mother
called. She's been looking for you.

238
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,240
Now you make jokes on my mother?

239
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,120
No, no, about your mother,
not on your mother, Franco.

240
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,680
l wouldn't get on your mother.

241
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:30,480
Just like in Monte Carlo. Jokes.

242
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,080
You insult me, you insult my family,
you insult my country...

243
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,920
...my honor, my dignity you insult!

244
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,360
l warned you!

245
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:42,120
But you wouldn't listen!

246
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,840
No more jokes.

247
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,840
You see this?

248
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,480
No more jokes!

249
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,520
Very good, Franco.

250
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,080
-You like?
-Yeah, it's very nice.

251
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,600
Where is the--? The professore.

252
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,160
Professore in the pee-pee.

253
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,920
Are you always like this?

254
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,160
Franco is ready.
The race can begin.

255
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,760
Here we go, Andy.

256
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,160
Porsche, two.

257
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,880
-Good for you.
-Six for the Dodge.

258
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,240
-All right.
-Cobra, four.

259
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,200
Three, Ferrari.

260
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,920
Jaguar, 10.

261
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,360
Take your number there.

262
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,160
Number one.

263
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,640
Number eight. Who's holding eight?

264
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,160
lt's Lapchik, the lone eagle.

265
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:54,360
Those are your starting positions.
Jose will start every vehicle.

266
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,640
You got something to do.

267
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,000
You're starting times will be
registered here and in Long Beach.

268
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,680
And your elapsed time will all be verified.

269
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,080
So that's it. Let's get some rest.

270
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,360
lt's done, brother.

271
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,160
Go.

272
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,080
Okay. Get ready.

273
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,640
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines.

274
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,920
And now, my friend...

275
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:06,680
...the first rule of Italian driving.

276
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,080
What's behind me is not important.

277
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,200
Buddy, here's to us,
and that we get there first.

278
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,960
Give New York one of those
famous rebel yells of yours...

279
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,560
...when we hit the street.

280
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,880
You know, just to start my blood.

281
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,280
Camaro, 6:OO. Go.

282
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,600
-Porsche, 6 and 10.
-Go.

283
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,440
-lt's going down.
-Off.

284
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,600
What's the matter with you?
Where are you?

285
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,920
-Cobra, 6:OO and 30 seconds.
-Go.

286
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,720
They're not gonna do it again.

287
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,440
Mercedes, 6 and 40. Go.

288
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,920
You animal.

289
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,760
51 st Street.

290
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,320
Bravo. Times Square.

291
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,720
lt's gonna be a nice day.

292
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,880
Good morning.

293
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,400
Good morning to you.

294
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,440
Miserable son of a bitch.
Hey, fella, can you loan me a dime?

295
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,840
-Drop your pants.
-Look, l'm a cop on the job.

296
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,160
l'm Robin Hood.

297
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,320
-Drop them.
-Okay.

298
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,080
-Real easy, fella.
-Drop them.

299
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,840
lt's okay, it's okay.

300
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,920
Okay, just stay calm.

301
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,240
Honk if you're horny.

302
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,880
Hit it.

303
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,120
Hit it.

304
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,680
Put your foot in it.

305
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,880
-You can't go back. It's one-way.
-What do you want me to do?

306
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,400
-Will you calm down?
-You should've checked the route.

307
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,000
l mean, wait, you blaming me?

308
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:46,440
Damn it. This is one-way too.

309
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:49,160
l am only going one way.

310
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,320
Wake up. meatheads.

311
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,320
Another great day ís startíng
ín New York Cíty. the Bíg Apple.

312
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,320
Get up. get ready. the Gíants won
7-zíp. belíeve ít or not.

313
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,120
The Age of Aquaríus ís really on us.

314

You wanna go fast?

316
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,240
No, that's all right.
We got plenty of time.

317
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,840
Hey! Watch where you're going!

318
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,200
Now we take a left over here, right?
But we gotta go left.

319
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,800
Look out, Joe! You're gonna ruin the car.
What's the matter with you?

320
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,040
Will you take it easy for God sakes?

321
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,960
Joey, slow down a minute.

322
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,520
-Wait a minute. Make a left.
-l'm not lost, so shut up.

323
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,680
Hey, did you know
there's a hole back there?

324
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:42,680
No shit.

325
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,520
And a hungry smile.

326
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,320
Can you look hungry?
This is Uncle Bruce.

327
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:52,760
Hussy, get hungry. Hungry,
_1 50-a-night hungry, for me.

328
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,520
You know the feeling.
Good, good, l like that. l love that.

329
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,320
l love that look. Fan. Hungry fans.
Click. Thank you. Thank you.

330
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,080
That's the end of the session.
It's been all right.

331
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,200
Hey, baby. How do you like it?

332
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,280
Oh, terrific. You stole it, right?

333
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Come on, l'm in a rush. Come on, get in.

334
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,240
Let me have that, here.

335
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,760
-So how do you like it, huh?
-This is real class.

336
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,720
l mean, real class.

337
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,320
Come on, turn it on.

338
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,640
-What, is this the switch?
-That's it.

339
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,200
Hey, maybe we should wait.

340
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,560
Christ, if this thing works....

341
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,240
Some city you got here.

342
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,320
l didn't know what size.
l said, better too big than too little.

343
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,280
-Did you get any?
-We didn't put it up.

344
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,000
-We were waiting to hear from you.
-They snipped my radio.

345
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,480
-How about your car?
-The wheels fell off.

346
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Oh, those guys sound mean.

347
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,960
-Take me to the airport.
-Now?

348
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,320
Hey, you gotta learn
to roll with the punches, Roscoe.

349
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,040
Harold, how you been?

350
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,840
Hey, that's Crazy Harold.

351
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:41,280
How long do we have to drive anyway?

352
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,760
lf we're lucky, about 35 hours.

353
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,200
-Where we going, Cuba?
-No, Long Beach, California.

354
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:50,960
-Stop.
-No, l can't.

355
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:53,440
No, no, stop.
You pull over to the side and stop.

356
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,520
-Let me out.
-l forgot to tell you something.

357
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,320
-l'm in a race, and l can't go back.
-l don't care.

358
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,960
-l'm getting out.
-You gotta stay.

359
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:02,800
-Just pull over, or l'm jumping.
-No, wait a minute.

360
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,880
Close that door.

361
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,360
Take it easy, now. Just take it easy.
We'll get there.

362
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,880
From the garage to the Jersey Turnpike,
six minutes, 58 seconds.

363
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,960
-That's 1 5 seconds better than last year.
-Terrific.

364
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,000
You got the snooper working?

365
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,440
-Get a weather report on the CB.
-You got it.

366
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,480
All you truckers out there.

367

We got a líttle líght snow
comíng ín from Pennsylvanía.

368
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,040
Roll on, yellow Camaro.

369
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,240
Exact change, 25 cents.

370
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,160
Well, we're heading south.
We got plenty of open road.

371
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,520
-You're a spastic.
-l was also all-state in basketball.

372
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,360
-That's it. No more quarters.
-Get out of the car.

373
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,880
-You got a quarter?
-Get out of the car.

374
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,160
Get that tin can out of the way.

375
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,160
-Where do you think it is?
-Under the car.

376
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,720
-What?
-Under the car.

377
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,560
lf l was a quarter, where would l be?
Where did it go?

378
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:29,600
Pull on through. Park in section D.

379
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,160
How about explaining that last move?

380
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,640
-What's a Smokey the Bear?
-Highway patrol.

381
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:45,880
-Plain brown wrapper?
-City policeman.

382
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,800
Unmarked car? Police car.

383
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,000
-County Mountie?
-County sheriff.

384
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:55,480
-And a local yokel?
-City policeman.

385
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,200
You're so smart. Next time out l'll
make sure you get a driver's license.

386
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,400
Well, happy hunting, Roscoe.
Sorry about the pants.

387
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,240
And you call yourself New York's finest.

388
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Well, l got you all out of New York.
See you later, Sir Roscoe.

389
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,240
Taxi.

390
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,440
-The crusade is straight ahead.
-Taxi.

391
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,440
Now, our crew is going ahead in a plane.

392
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,760
They got spare parts,
everything we're gonna need.

393
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,320
Now, l've got all these stops here
marked and coordinated.

394
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,240
Beautiful.

395
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,960
-What the hell are you doing?
-She is magnificent.

396
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,400
Look, this is a race, man.

397
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,520
Some things are more important
than winning.

398
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,760
Maybe the float's stuck.

399
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,720
Maybe it's humidity.

400
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,880
England is humid.

401
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,320
l feel like Moses
at the parting of the Red Sea.

402
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,800
-Hey, man, this is no good.
-What's the matter, huh?

403
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,840
Well, take a look. It's too easy.

404
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,560
Yeah. Yeah, it's too easy
until somebody nails us.

405
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:35,120
This is Flying Lasagna
coming into the oven, do you copy?

406
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,160
The oven ís hot.

407
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,560
See that gas station? Let's pull off there.

408
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,520
Let's get ready. One man take them--

409
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,320
-Brilliant. Brilliant.
-Thank you.

410
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,840
-Preston?
-What do you want?

411
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,160
l gotta take a leak.

412
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,200
No, l won't stop
so you can take a piss.

413
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,680
-There's a bottle in the back.
-l can't do that.

414
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,640
-l'm not gonna stop till we need gas.
-l can't hold it, buddy.

415
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:57,760
l'm telling you, use the bottle.

416
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,840
l tried this once going 60.
Didn't work then.

417
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,200
Well, if you're coordinated,
once you start, you won' t stop.

418
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,400
Hey. Come on.

419
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,040
Stop.

420
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:16,200
l'm getting this all over my hands.

421
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:22,080
My hands are wet.

422
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:24,080
You're a dumb son of a bitch
sometimes.

423
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,280
l don't know why
l hang around with you.

424
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,160
l wouldn't have done this to you.

425
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,880
Those dirty son of a bitches.
l hope there's tough justice in Illinois.

426
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:50,360
l wanna nail them, sheriff,
and this ought to do it.

427
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:53,040
-Then what?
-Then l'm gonna turn them over to you.

428
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,840
You can throw away the key. You'll be
doing this country a favor, that's what.

429
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,240
Now we can start running.

430
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,640
How's our time?

431
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,760
Right on schedule.

432
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,000
l wonder what old Roscoe
is doing now.

433
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:13,120
Developing an ulcer.

434
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,480
Steady, huh?

435
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:55,000
She is happy.

436
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:05,680
They're coming.

437
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,720
Goddamn, was that Roscoe?

438
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,880
l wonder if he set us up.

439
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,000
Oh, terrific.

440
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,720
l got them now. Jeez, l'd love to see
the look on their faces.

441
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,560
-How fast are you going?
-Just 100.

442
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:49,840
-Well, let's hit it, avantí.
-Thank you, my dear friend.

443
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:54,520
-Jesus, we're going over 100 knots.
-Well, come on. Step it up, buddy.

444
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,320
-Hey, what's the matter?
-Sir, we can't catch them.

445
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,800
He must be going 180 miles per hour.

446
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,680
We don't even have a fixed-wing airplane
that can catch that.

447
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,280
Now what?

448
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,520
Take me to the airport.

449
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:39,160
lt's a handsome design.

450
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,280
l wish it ran.

451
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,640
l'm gonna tell you.
This thing handles like a pig.

452
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,880
lt'll get better.
Wait till we use up some gas.

453
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:47,800
This thing's a bear to handle.

454
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,480
-What the hell, Harry?
-l don't know, did we break anything?

455
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:55,440
-Maybe we better stop.
-Are you kidding?

456
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,320
-l think it's all right.
-Roll on.

457
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:08,200
What's wrong with him?
l think he's having a nightmare.

458
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:11,320
Oh, Jesus Christ.

459
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,880
-Fire. Fire.
-You can't outrun it, you asshole.

460
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:15,400
Pull that thing off the road.

461
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,200
l hope you learn from this experience.

462
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,200
l made this drive once before
in 1 946 in a Mercury coupe.

463
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,840
-ls that so?
-But it's different now.

464
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,320
-Yes, newer roads, older bodies.
-Yeah, too much, too late.

465
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,560
But if l have to die, Andy,
l want to die trying.

466
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:56,720
Good.

467
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,880
Would you say that man Lapchik
has a certainjoíe de vívre?

468
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,320
l'd say he's possessed
of a severe case of masochism.

469
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,280
l think it was a meteor,
that's what it was.

470
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,800
-You okay, huh? You okay?
-Yeah, l think so.

471
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,000
Who's that guy?

472
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:57,040
-Keep your eye on the road.
-Just getting my rhythm up.

473
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:59,000
Keep up the speed, will you?

474
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:01,440
l am keeping up the speed.
It's so boring out here...

475
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:02,800
...my mind's drifting.

476
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,000
This is America, Gibson.
America's not boring.

477
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,120
Yeah, well, motel signs, café signs,
one-way signs, ''do not enter'' signs...

478
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,000
...and every other kind of sign,
it all looks the same to me.

479
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:15,840
Now, back there we saw a reptile farm.
That's more right down my alley.

480
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,480
Get my hands on a boa contractor.

481
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:21,600
The word is ''constrictor. ''
And don't slow down. Move it.

482
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,040
-Why did l pick him for a mechanic?
-Because l'm the best, that's why.

483
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:29,240
Oh, what in the name of farm corn
did he come from?

484
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,880
l told you to keep your eyes on the road.

485
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:37,040
How am l supposed to keep my eyes
on the road, have a good time...

486
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:39,600
...think about my girlfriend
and do all that? Tell me.

487
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,440
You're a product of too much inbreeding.

488
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,120
Watch out, P.D.

489
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,560
Hit it. You got yours.

490
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:49,320
lt's those damn fake cops.

491
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,040
-Will you move it now?
-Damn it if you can't take a joke.

492
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:55,960
l wanna go home.

493
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:59,520
You say you wanna be a movie star,
that you wanna be somebody.

494
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,200
l mean, you take acting classes,
you take dance classes, you work hard.

495
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,760
Where the hell do you think
you're gonna be discovered?

496
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,120
Standing on a corner in Queens?

497
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,480
l mean, baby, listen, now...

498
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:15,400
...in Hollywood.

499
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,320
-Do you really think so?
-Baby, l really like you.

500
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,000
You should try to be nice to me.

501
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,320
You know, you should try to understand.

502
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,520
l do.

503
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,840
What are you doing?

504
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,120
What are you doing?

505
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:51,640
Don't grab the wheel.

506
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,000
Brake!

507
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:05,400
Hey, you!

508
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:07,760
Jesus Christ.

509
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:11,000
Whitey, Whitey, you okay, boy?
Talk to me.

510
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:18,760
Hello out there. thís ís Hoosíer.

511
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,320
Rollíng on to Derby Cíty.

512
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,960
Got Smokeys all over _O

...as you ríde the cloverleaf
ínto the Buckeye. hear?

514
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:28,640
You can put the hammer down
and watch out for two líttle beavers.. .

515
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,000
.. .ín a black speedboat
comíng your way. as they are broken.

516
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:34,320
They got ears. Do you copy?

517
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,960
That damn Smith.
He's the one who links up all this mess.

518
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:41,360
He's a damned overaged
juvenile delinquent, and l want him.

519
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:43,520
l wanna suspend his license
in perpetuity.

520
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:44,720
Who's Smith?

521
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,840
The thorn in my side, captain.
The cloud over my head.

522
00:47:56,199 --> 00:47:58,320
Baker spotted them
about five miles back.

523
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,680
They should be here soon.
They're flyíng.

524
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:15,280
They must be doing over 1 60.
l never saw anything so damn fast.

525
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,400
l got them. Get everybody in position.

526
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,240
Come on, let's go get them.

527
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,040
See this truck up here?

528
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,160
Pull in behind it and blow the horn.

529
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,040
Fantastic.

530
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:54,400
l thought you'd like that.

531
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,640
Bravo, bravo!

532
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,120
Maybe they stopped.

533
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,400
Send a car up the road.

534
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:54,760
-What's up?
-Any speeders pass you back there?

535
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,240
-Nobody passed me within 1 5 miles.
-Okay, get out of here.

536
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,040
What happened? Somebody rob a bank?

537
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:02,960
None of your damn business.
Just move it out.

538
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,880
There's no sign of them anywhere.

539
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,800
Well, they couldn't just
have vanished into thin air.

540
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:27,400
l'll be a son of a--

541
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,800
Where are you going?

542
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,440
Follow me.

543
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,840
Open it up.

544
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,520
Open it!

545
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:34,280
Are you happy?

546
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:40,640
Get it out of here.

547
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,920
lt's so easy on these interstates.

548
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,680
Can you imagine making this trip
at 55 miles an hour?

549
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,600
-Fifty-five miles an hour is unsafe.
-lt's boring.

550
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,720
That's why it's unsafe.

551
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,680
lt's fast enough to kill you, but it's slow
enough to make you think you're safe.

552
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,000
What time have you got?

553
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,880
-Six o'clock.
-Great. Twelve hours.

554
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:20,960
One-third of the trip.

555
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,840
l think it's terminal.

556
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,920
Thís ís Casey Kasem
on American Top 40.

557
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,080
ln Colorado Spríngs.. .

558
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:02,200

.. .where the temperature
ís now 3$ degrees and droppíng.

560
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,520
Hey, hey, fella. What's the matter?
You cold or something?

561
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:28,640
Hey, hey.

562
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,960
Hey, hey. Take it easy, okay?
Everything's gonna be okay.

563
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:35,320
Stay calm, okay? Stay calm. Okay?

564
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,480
Okay, Dr Pepper?

565
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,520
-Okay.
-Chop-chop. Let's go, huh?

566
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:49,240
Okay, let's make it. Hey, my man.

567
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,320
Boy, attaboy.

568
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,280
-There's those damn fake cops.
-They see us?

569
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,000
Let's not wait around to find out.

570
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:05,840
Yeah, it's Oklahoma.

571
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,720
Land of the red man.
Land of the cowboy.

572
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,360
Land of the cow and the dog.

573
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:15,520
Sailing, Ace.
You're sailing, buddy.

574
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:17,960
-l don't believe it.
-What?

575
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,240
lt's those guys.

576
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,920
l think they're gonna pull
the same stunt.

577
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:24,840
-They must think you're stupid.
-Yeah--

578
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,040
Boy, that car moves.

579
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,560
Well, put it on 140.
If he catches us, l'll eat my Airedale.

580
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,320
Hey, that's a real sheriff, man.

581
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,000
That is a real sheriff.

582
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,280
l'll get you, you mother--

583
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,320
He lost his engine.

584
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,440
Go get them, fellas. Get them.
Go get them. He went that way.

585
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:28,000
Catch up to them. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

586
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,000
l thought you said you could drive.

587
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:40,120
What the hell you talking about?
There was oil there on the road.

588
00:55:57,719 --> 00:55:59,840
Fill it up, please.

589
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,600
Shut it off. Shut if off.

590
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,400
-Hello.
-Hello.

591
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,720
-Where are you going?
-Los Angeles.

592
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,680
-Driving all night?
-Yes.

593
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,360
-Alone?
-Yes.

594
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:21,960
-You like me?
-Yes.

595
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,680
Excuse, one moment. Don't go away.

596
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:30,200
l have a small problem.

597
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,880
-A small problem, huh?
-Oh, yeah, l'm sure you do. Forget it--

598
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:35,200
She's very sweet.

599
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,800
-She's got breasts like ripe melons.
-Forget it, will you? Come on. Let's go.

600
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,720
She's beautiful. She wants me now.
l cannot deny her.

601
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,160
That's impossible.

602
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,560
She's so sweet.
We can make up the time.

603
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:47,880
lmpossible. Forget it.

604
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:56,080
-Get in the car, will you?
-No. No, no. l don't get into the car, no.

605
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,640
Okay.

606
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,400
l'll see you later.

607
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,640
Arrívedercí. my q_ien8.

608
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:18,280
-l hate beer.
-Yeah, you hate everything.

609
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,640
-l'm getting real bored lately.
-What you're getting is real boring lately.

610
00:57:25,639 --> 00:57:27,800
-Did you see that one?
-Foreign job.

611
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,360
-Yeah, and it had two girls in it.
-Let's go. Go, go.

612
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,680
We got a terrific stretch of road
the next 25 miles.

613
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,480
Don't do anything weird, Joe.
The last time they locked us up.

614
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:46,520
Don't worry about it.
These dollies are ready.

615
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,040
Hey, they're kind of cute.

616
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:03,240
-Oh, you gotta be kidding.
-Yeah.

617
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,400
Maybe l'll just tease them a little bit
and have some fun.

618
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,080
-Howdy, ma'am.
-Howdy, mister.

619
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,800
Hey, where do you wind this thing up?

620
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,320
-Hey, you old enough to drink?
-l'm old enough to do a lot of things.

621
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,400
Did l tell you? Did l tell you? Hey,
slow that thing down. It's gonna break.

622
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:38,240
-What do you want to do, play doctor?
-Oh, l'm in love. l'm in love.

623
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:42,440
Sweetheart, if you catch me...

624
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:44,440
...you can have me.

625
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,960
Are you kidding?

626
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,600
Go. Go.

627
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,120
Go. This is a dream come true.
Get on them.

628
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,800
-Go.
-That was really dumb.

629
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,200
Oh, they'll never catch up with us.

630
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,880
Drive, Earl. Drive.

631
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,480
Well, goddamn,
Franco's gonna miss all the fun.

632
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:21,480
Goddamn.

633
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,960
-Where's Franco?
-We must have lost him somewhere.

634
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,680
lt's a difficult thing to think about
at 2:OO in the morning.

635
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:36,880
Well, l guess l can ease up now.

636
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,560
Feeling better?

637
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,080
Oh, my God.

638
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,560
Well?

639
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:18,880
Andy, l need an inspiration.

640
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:24,280
-Yes, it's that time of morning.
-Something to make the blood hot.

641
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,800
What would you say
to a bit of Henry Y?

642
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,520
Oh, you're a mind reader.

643
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,080
Once more into the breach, dear friends,
OnCe MOle.

644
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,680
Follow your spirit,
and on this charge cry:

645
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:55,400
''God for Harry,
England and St. George! ''

646
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:02,240
Christ.

647
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,440
l hope Lapchik the mad Hungarian
sees that.

648
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,320
He came off right here.
He's gotta be down there.

649
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,880
Man, he's gotta be down there.

650
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,200
Hey. Hey, fella, you all right?

651
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,320
They're gonna be leaving Nevada
on Interstate 1 5.

652
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,520
That's the way they're gonna be coming.
Through this junction.

653
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,840
-We haven't had too much luck before.
-Yeah, but they were forewarned.

654
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,760
They've got CB radios.
They can listen to everything we say.

655
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,200
There was no way around it.

656
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,280
l can't understand how, but they did it.

657
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,440
This time, this time,
it's gonna be planned.

658
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,800
-Really planned.
-Boy, you really want them bad.

659
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,000
Gentlemen, this is Roscoe's last stand.

660
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:24,000
Don't let go of the accelerator.

661
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:30,240
For you, you lovely American animal.

662
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,960
Remember Franco.

663
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,200
Quickest man l know.

664
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,200
Bye. Bye.

665
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:44,360
What the hell?

666
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:46,120
She can drive, huh?

667
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,920
Yeah. Bannon and Graves
got by last night.

668
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:51,760
Well, let them have
their brief moment of glory.

669
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,000
Yeah. We'll be in Nevada pretty soon.

670
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:56,400
Nevada. Las Vegas.

671
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:01,200
City le sens_ale. The dancing girls
with the bouncing boom-booms.

672
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:04,320
Oh, shut up, will you, with that.

673
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:15,640
-Look at that piece there.
-What's that car?

674
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,600
-That's a Rolls Royce.
-Ain't she sweet.

675
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,600
She looks lonely.

676
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,600
l love it, l love it.

677
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:29,880
Hey, come on, Angie, come on. Let's go.

678
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:31,760
Come on, let's get her.

679
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:40,720
Come on, cut that cleaning crap.
Get in the car.

680
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,000
-l wanna get a Coke.
-Get your ass in the car. Come on, Angie.

681
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,200
Angie.

682
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,680
l ain't gonna hurt you.

683
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,640
-Angie.
-Let's look at your bicentennial flag.

684
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:46,160
Come on, baby, it's gonna be
you, you, me and all my friends.

685
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:52,680
Hey, send her out.

686
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,640
Oh, jeez.

687
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,600
Hey, come on out, we won't hurt you.

688
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,640
-Come on.
-Get out.

689
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,400
l'm gonna get you, faggot.

690
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:09,800
Go.

691
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,880
You watch that bike.

692
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:13,800
l'm warning you, you little--

693
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,160
Look what you did.

694
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:21,000
You got some nerve to go out
and get some Coca-Cola.

695
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,400
Come on, go, go. Let's get them.

696
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:27,520
Those pigs.

697
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,240
Oh, shit, they coming after us.

698
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,680
Oh, you know
what's gonna happen now?

699
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,080
They gonna rape you,
and they gonna kill me.

700
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:40,120
Really? Maybe they'll kill me
and rape you.

701
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,440
-Do something.
-What?

702
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:46,720
-l don't know.
-Christ, l hate this country.

703
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,080
Oh, shit. Hey, old buddy.

704
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,760
Wake up, man. Lookie here.

705
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,400
-What now?
-Oh, Jesus.

706
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:36,520
Turn back 6 yards, then punt.

707
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,320
You know, you fellows were doing
just about 90.

708
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,000
Really?

709
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:08,000
Okay, okay, okay. Cut, cut, cut.

710
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:09,920
Hey. Hey, man. Was it me?

711
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:12,880
The line was supposed to be:

712
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,840
''Let me explain. ''

713
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,480
Oh, damn.

714
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,160
Sure is a funny-looking police car.

715
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:23,800
Say.. .

716
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,600
.. .what police department
you fellas from anyway?

717
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,320
-None.
-lmpersonating an officer, huh?

718
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:31,520
-Turn around. Stand easy against the car.
-Hey.

719
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,200
Oh, come on.

720
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,400
We-- We're on film right now.

721
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,560
What do you mean, you're on film?

722
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,720
What, are you making a movie?

723
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,680
Yeah, sure. l mean, the camera's right
up there on that mountaintop.

724
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,160
Well, nobody informed me about that.

725
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:49,360
Well, that's obvious.

726
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,840
l mean, you think we'd be riding
in this rinky-dink police car...

727
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,080
...with chocolate cookies on
the dashboard if it weren't for a movie?

728
01:08:56,239 --> 01:09:00,160
l wouldn't know anything about that.
All l know is the law's still the law.

729
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,880
Listen, officer, you--
l mean, absolutely, you're right.

730
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:05,440
l mean, we were speeding, but--

731
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,160
Oh, hey, wait a minute. This is perfect.

732
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:12,800
You could help us.

733
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:15,400
Help you? Help you do what?

734
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,080
Sure.

735
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:19,880
Sure, the whole mise en scène...

736
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:22,720
...that leads into the exposition,
and the dénouement...

737
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,280
-...and the intention. It's perfect--
-Wait a minute.

738
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:26,800
Let me get this straight.

739
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,560
Are you trying to tell me that...

740
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,600
...you want me to be in your movie?

741
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:34,280
Well, l mean...

742
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:36,840
...that is, if you've got
five minutes, and...

743
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,440
...you know, if you'd like to be
in a Hollywood film, sure.

744
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,400
l don't know, l--

745
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,040
Avila, call Clint and see
if they're ready, okay?

746
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:48,760
-And tell them that we have Officer....
-Williams.

747
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,240
Officer Williams here,
and we'd like to use him.

748
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,680
God, you sure got
a good-looking smile.

749
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,600
Okay. Hey, old buddy...

750
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,800
...they wanna see his face.

751
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,280
Officer Williams, step down here
by your car for me.

752
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:04,400
-For just a second, would you, please?
-Sure.

753
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,840
Stand over here or something. Pose.
You know, something like that, huh?

754
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,280
-Yeah.
-All right.

755
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:11,680
-This is preliminary stuff for the camera.
-Sure.

756
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,280
-Focus, stuff like that.
-Sure.

757
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:14,600
-How's that?
-Okay?

758
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,800
Yeah, fine.
Just turn the chin around a little.

759
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,400
-Yeah.
-No, no-- Just a--

760
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,480
Just give me the chin
a little bit this way.

761
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,240
-That--
-Oh, l see what you mean.

762
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:25,120
Yeah, you got it.

763
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,840
God, you got a great profile.

764
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,360
Hey, old buddy, they got it
and they say it's A-okay.

765
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,680
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

766
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,480
Listen, this is what we're gonna do.

767
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,840
Avila and l are gonna get in the car
and go down about two miles, okay?

768
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,200
We're gonna turn around
and come barrel-assing...

769
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,560
...back through this way.

770
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,680
-Then you get in your--
-l get in my car and chase you.

771
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,800
You got it, that's it. Perfect.

772
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,480
Hey, wait a minute.
Don't l gotta put on some makeup?

773
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,440
Makeup?

774
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:56,040
Hey, does Charlie Bronson wear makeup?

775
01:10:56,199 --> 01:10:57,960
Charlie who?

776
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,160
Bronson.

777
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:03,440
Oh, yeah. That little guy. Right.

778
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,880
-All right, buddy. Let's go, they're rolling.
-Oh, okay.

779
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:12,040
Scene 14, take two, hand mark.

780
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,720
Come on, now.
Let me see those pearly whites. Smile.

781
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,920
That's it. Action.

782
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,040
God, can't you turn off the heater?

783
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:07,680
Either the engine gets hot,
or we get hot.

784
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:09,720
Well, l'm gonna have a stroke.

785
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,480
You're gonna have a stroke?
l should be so lucky.

786
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,080
Because if you don't stop
playing that music--

787
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:19,840
l can't stand you!

788
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,320
l swear to God, l'm gonna kill you!

789
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:33,920
l liked Joe.

790
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:35,400
He was sweet.

791
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:41,680
Aren't you gonna talk to me anymore?

792
01:13:44,359 --> 01:13:47,160
You gotta admit,
he was a good mechanic.

793
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,320
He fixed the car faster than we could.

794
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:52,160
Furthermore.. .

795
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:54,200
...we didn't lose much time.

796
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:56,240
We made time, as a matter of fact.

797
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,360
lt was love at first sight.

798
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,600
Are you crazy?
Love at first sight?

799
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:08,000
Out there? The middle of the night?
The middle of a field under the stars?

800
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,280
A girl can't always find
the perfect spot.

801
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,360
l think Roscoe's gonna give it
one more try before L.A.

802
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,200
l didn't hear anything on the radio.

803
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,720
-Maybe he's getting smart.
-Howdy.

804
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,280
Howdy.

805
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:13,480
Couldn't help but overhear
your conversation.

806
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,600
Wrong, thank you.

807
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,080
-l'm gonna get back on the road.
-No, no.

808
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:20,560
Too many police cars
go down the road this morning.

809
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,200
-See where they went?
-Nope...

810
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:24,720
...but l could find out.

811
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,760
Well, you got a deal.

812
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,600
You guys seem to need a rabbit.

813
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,960
-Are you volunteering?
-Oh, listen, listen.

814
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:38,520
l play, but l-- l play for pay.

815
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:42,960
You want the road cleared out,
it's gonna cost you _500 cash...

816
01:15:43,119 --> 01:15:44,360
...paid in advance.

817
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,040
Five hundred dollars, paid in advance?

818
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:48,400
Could be worth it.

819
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,960
Yeah, well...

820
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:52,320
.. .suit yourselves, okay?

821
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:28,480
What the hell's
the matter with him?

822
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,600
Don't make babies like this anymore.

823
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,360
Give me six for the lead time, okay?

824
01:16:50,199 --> 01:16:52,800
That's the ugliest car l ever saw.

825
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,200
Looks like a jukebox.

826
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,840
Well, they got them,
right behind me yet.

827
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,560
-Ferrari and a Cobra.
-How far back?

828
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:09,960
l don't wanna talk about that.
Let's have the money, huh?

829
01:17:10,119 --> 01:17:11,960
That's it, that's it.

830
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:13,560
There, that's good.

831
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:17,760
Thanks.. .

832
01:17:19,079 --> 01:17:21,440
-.. .lieutenant.
-Get out of here.

833
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:30,800
-Want one of those?
-No, thanks.

834
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,640
You know...

835
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:35,920
...l smell something.
You smell something?

836
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:38,400
Yeah, a weasel in a rabbit suit.

837
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,600
Old Roscoe, huh?

838
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,080
Maybe we're being too cynical.

839
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,760
-We should be more positive, trusting.
-Oh, get out of here, will you?

840
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:47,840
Let's go.

841
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,040
Sam.

842
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,600
We're 27 minutes ahead
of last year's schedule.

843
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,680
But Franco's driving again.

844
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,440
Well, with a little bit of luck
and some pure Yankee style....

845
01:18:15,319 --> 01:18:17,560
All right, you two,
on the hill with the other car.

846
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,200
All right, everybody, hear this.

847
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:21,760
lt's plan B. Move out.

848
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,200
Come on, now, move out. Get moving.

849
01:18:24,359 --> 01:18:25,920
Number one, move it. Go in.

850
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:29,920
Come on, you guys. Let's hustle it here.
Come on!

851
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:32,360
Take it out of here.

852
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,680
How inadequate.

853
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,680
Fifty-five miles an hour, Roscoe.

854
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,040
No.

855
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,160
Why?

856
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,080
Why me?

857
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,040
You're an asshole, Roscoe, that's why.

858
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,960
Well, good morning to you too.

859
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,200
How can you fall asleep?

860
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:10,000
lt was easy, you said, ''Relax.''
And the car is comfortable.

861
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:12,880
Comfortable? It's a _40,OOO car.
Of course it's comfortable.

862
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:16,000
When we get to Hollywood,
if you like it so much, l'll buy you one.

863
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,920
-What's the matter with you?
-Hollywood.

864
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:20,200
Nothing's the matter.
You're so goddamn stupid.

865
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:23,280
You think you'll walk the streets
of Hollywood, meet a producer--

866
01:20:23,439 --> 01:20:26,000
-What are you talking about?
-He'll make you a movie star.

867
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:27,560
You told me that if l went--

868
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,520
l told you a lot of things
because you were freaking out on me.

869
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,280
-All l wanted was for you to like me.
-l like you.

870
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:35,680
-For you to be-- You like me?
-Yes, l like you.

871
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,280
l been thinking all night...

872
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:39,880
...and l'll tell you what.
You ain't right for me.

873
01:20:40,039 --> 01:20:41,440
You're a goddamn hustler.

874
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,040
-That's what you are.
-You wanna know who l am?

875
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:46,320
l'm the girl who's gonna
punch you in the nose.

876
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:48,360
You don't understand
anything about me!

877
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,560
What's that? What the hell is that?
Look at that.

878
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,240
-Oh, what is this?
-Slow down.

879
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,040
Why does it always happen to me?

880
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:57,920
Believe this?
Wait, l'm trying to drive.

881
01:20:58,079 --> 01:20:59,560
-Slow down.
-l can't. You crazy?

882
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,920
-How am l gonna slow down?
-Would you just--?

883
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:04,000
l can't see. Look at--

884
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:08,320
What the hell was that?
What the hell was that?

885
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,520
Oh, my God.

886
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,120
Oh, this is cute.

887
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:15,080
Oh, my God.

888
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:17,200
Look what happened.

889
01:21:45,319 --> 01:21:49,120
Hello, smart boy.

890
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:55,840
You know what we do
to finks and traitors?

891
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,080
-lt was a joke, man--
-A joke?

892
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,000
-Sorry, man--
-You're sorry, huh?

893
01:22:01,159 --> 01:22:03,600
-Listen--
-lt's too late to do anything about it!

894
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,920
l am going to mark you
with the gumball gun.

895
01:22:07,079 --> 01:22:08,600
No.

896
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,120
Now you are marked...

897
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:18,960
...for life!

898
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:44,240
Vitamin C?

899
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,320
Just for good luck.

900
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:50,880
You really think we got a chance?

901
01:23:18,199 --> 01:23:19,360
Hey, Roscoe.

902
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,880
--Las Vegas. now arrívíng... .

903
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:22,800
-Don't ask, Clancy.
-What happened?

904
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,560
Look, l'm tired. All l wanna do
is go home. They beat me.

905
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,800
-You understand?
-Didn't you nail any of them?

906
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,240
-Look, just don't ask me.
-Jesus, Roscoe, all that--

907
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:32,760
-Clancy!
-Roscoe.. .

908
01:23:34,119 --> 01:23:35,760
...you look terrible.

909
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:40,320
Well ít's one of those
Los Angeles days. Gene.

910
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:43,480
We're hoveríng over the Cívíc Center.
We can see traffíc backíng up.

911
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,640
We got a síg alert workíng
on Santa Moníca.. .

912
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,560
.. .and the Pasadena ís jammed as usual.

913
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:51,760
Golden State's movíng. but just barely.
And the Long Beach ís a sea of cars.

914
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,080
Should contínue to be líke thís
for another hour.

915
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,800
Be advísed. take surface streets
wherever possíble.. .

916
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,120
.. .and try to stay calm and composed.

917
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,560
There must be another way.

918
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,960
God, oh, God.

919
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,520
Christ.

920
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:13,440
The engine is too hot.

921
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,560
l guess we're just a little bit
too smart for them, old buddy.

922
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,440
That's right, my friend.
Smooth sailing to Long Beach.

923
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,640
Yep, l think l'll have me a cigar.

924
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:26,600
My wife's pregnant.

925
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,000
-Come on, give me a hand, will you?
-Bug off, jerk.

926
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:32,720
Oh, no.

927
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:40,720
Avila, no way.
l don't wanna hear it, Avila.

928
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,800
To serve and to protect, huh?

929
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:48,960
Officer. Right here.

930
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:52,200
Hold it. Hold it, officer.

931
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,320
Oh, God, thank you, officer.

932
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,760
Help! My wife is pregnant.

933
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:01,000
She's gonna have the baby.
Her water just broke.

934
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:03,040
l tried to get these--
They won't help me.

935
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,960
They haven't helped.
Come on. Help me.

936
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:08,520
You assholes!

937
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:11,520
Jesus, l'm grateful.

938
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:14,680
-They don't even care.
-Okay, now.

939
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:19,960
Just be cool, be calm.
We'll take care of everything.

940
01:25:20,119 --> 01:25:23,280
-Don't-- Please don't bite my hand.
-Yeah, you!

941
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:25,520
Wait! Wait! Wait a minute.

942
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:29,920
We can use the river.
There's an access road to the right.

943
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:32,360
lt runs all the way to Long Beach.

944
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:50,880
-No, no. West, west.
-West?

945
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:52,560
West.

946
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:05,680
Look at that.

947
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:08,160
Look at that. That's Bannon.

948
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,080
What the hell? Get off of here.

949
01:26:12,359 --> 01:26:13,880
Get off.

950
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:16,520
Where's the next one?

951
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,560
On your left.

952
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,240
Okay.

953
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:25,000
Look out, you damn fool.

954
01:26:25,159 --> 01:26:27,080
-Right out of there.
-You're not allowed down there.

955
01:26:27,239 --> 01:26:28,800
Up yours.

956
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,680
You can't go down there. Stop.

957
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:33,320
Don't slow down, hit it.

958
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,080
l never raced in a river before.

959
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,160
Okay, the lights are set
for 32 miles per hour.

960
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:48,360
-Right.
-Just keep going on Sepulveda.

961
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:50,080
Okay, hang on.

962
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:01,720
Smile.

963
01:27:02,439 --> 01:27:04,000
What are we going now?

964
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:06,240
Thirty-two miles an hour.

965
01:27:07,239 --> 01:27:10,360
Looks like we've
got some water coming up.

966
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:14,080
-l don't see anything.
-How deep is it here?

967
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,320
Here goes.

968
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:19,200
Hold it. Keep the rims high.
Don't slow it up.

969
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,040
l can't see anything.

970
01:27:29,399 --> 01:27:32,160
Come on. Come on.
Take him. Take him.

971
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,960
Watch out for the slick places.

972
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,120
Let's go. Let's go.

973
01:27:58,359 --> 01:27:59,880
Okay, okay, okay. Let's go.

974
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:04,160
There's a real big drain coming up.

975
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,120
Really hustle.

976
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:22,040
All right, now, now.

977
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:23,800
Now.

978
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,880
You got him. You got him.

979
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,600
Where do we turn?

980
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,000
Turn into it! Into it, into it.

981
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:38,680
Turn coming up. Turn coming up.

982
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,840
Where's Franco now?

983
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,160
Damn it!

984
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,760
What do you say, Franco?

985
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:55,960
Block him on this turn.

986
01:28:56,119 --> 01:28:57,920
Stay on him, Sam.

987
01:28:58,119 --> 01:29:00,000
-Ride him. Ride him.
-Watch out.

988
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,440
Hang on. Hang on, now.

989
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,440
Change your gear.
Move, now. Move, move, move.

990
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,560
l tell you what
the trouble is with you, Ace.

991
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:14,240
You don't have a sense of humor.
This is rigged for fun.

992
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:16,720
-Don't talk to me.
-Well, come on, buddy, cheer up.

993
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,080
We're just about there.

994
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:19,960
Just about smell
the Q_een Mary's butt.

995
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,560
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

996
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:38,240
Now this is style.
We'll come whipping in on two wheels.

997
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,840
Hey, l've seen you do it 100 times.
l practiced.

998
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,600
Think l can get in the show?

999
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,040
l think you're making a mistake.

1000
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:50,000
No, l got this under control.

1001
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,320
Damn. Almost had it.

1002
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:05,960
What do you think l did wrong?

1003
01:30:06,119 --> 01:30:07,520
l think l'm gonna be sick.

1004
01:30:08,119 --> 01:30:09,280
lt's a wreck or something.

1005
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:12,280
lt always happens when l'm in a hurry.

1006
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:17,560
Oh, my God.

1007
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,960
You wrecked my car, you jerk.

1008
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:22,000
You dumb jerk, look at my car.

1009
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:24,760
What do you think you're doing?
You got a driver's license?

1010
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,760
You people see what he did to my car?

1011
01:30:27,079 --> 01:30:28,400
l don't care. l have no money.

1012
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,760
lf you wanna put me in jail,
it's okay with me, l can use the sleep.

1013
01:30:36,439 --> 01:30:39,440
l was just about to get
the car repainted anyway.

1014
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:42,360
Oh, this is my girlfriend, Angie,
from New York.

1015
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,440
Are you sure everything's okay,
Mr. Blakely?

1016
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:51,040
You wouldn't happen to be
an actress, would you, Miss...?

1017
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:53,560
Blanche. Why, yes. How'd you guess?

1018
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:56,920
Well, you have what we call...

1019
01:30:57,479 --> 01:30:59,200
.. .pleSenCe.

1020
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:04,280
Well, if it bothers you,
l can put on my jacket.

1021
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:06,240
Why don't we go inside.

1022
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:08,040
l have to do a lot of entertaining.

1023
01:31:08,199 --> 01:31:11,200
l'm in the movie business,
and it's part of the game.

1024
01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:12,800
Go, baby!

1025
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:21,120
What's the matter--?
What's the matter with you?

1026
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:25,600
Am l clear?

1027
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,960
Yes, you're clear.

1028
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:33,600
Cut them off, cut them off.

1029
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:37,880
Good going.

1030
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,200
Just make it to that parking lot.

1031
01:31:44,359 --> 01:31:45,680
lt's only two miles.

1032
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,680
No problem. Relax, relax.

1033
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:51,080
Clear on your right.

1034
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,480
There it is.

1035
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:06,400
Let's hope
Emergency Plan Alpha works.

1036
01:32:07,039 --> 01:32:09,680
Emergency Plan Alpha?

1037
01:32:16,199 --> 01:32:17,640
Go.

1038
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,520
Get them, damn it, quick.
Oh, that's a cheap move.

1039
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:25,440
Terrific.

1040
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:27,840
Take them.

1041
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:32,240
On the right. On the right.

1042
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:34,080
l got it, l got it, l got it.

1043
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:48,960
Get him now.

1044
01:32:58,640 --> 01:32:59,840
Okay.

1045
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,480
What are you doing?

1046
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,000
What are you doing?

1047
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:10,320
l've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?

1048
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:12,720
-Hey.
-lt worked. It worked.

1049
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,200
lt's a trap. Get out of here.

1050
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:16,280
Oh, no. Jesus.

1051
01:33:16,439 --> 01:33:18,960
-l'll come back.
-Wait, Franco.

1052
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:29,960
Franco.

1053
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:34,120
Franco, wait. Franco.

1054
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:58,320
Thirty-three hours and 57 minutes.
A new record. How's that, Mike?

1055
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:00,960
Great going, Sam.
l thought you were in traffic.

1056
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:03,080
Smith was going down.

1057
01:34:13,079 --> 01:34:15,760
Hey, two more.
Alice and Jane and the cops.

1058
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,360
l wanna thank my mother, my friends.
l wanna thank my loved ones, you--

1059
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,720
Hey, listen, listen. l wanna thank
you guys for me and Mr. Guts.

1060
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,320
lf you hadn't picked us up, we'd have
still been on the freeways of America.

1061
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:36,640
What do you say we celebrate, huh?

1062
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,280
Get over here.

1063
01:34:50,439 --> 01:34:53,800
Hey. Shut up. Shut up.

1064
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:09,440
What can l say?
It just.... Just makes me sick.

1065
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,320
-Angie.
-Where did he come from?

1066
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:16,680
Angie, baby.

1067
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,640
Oh, baby.

1068
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:25,880
Hey, Roscoe.

1069
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:28,600
Roscoe.

1070
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,000
Come on, have a drink.

1071
01:35:36,359 --> 01:35:38,920
Don't add insult to injury, Bannon.

1072
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,880
Maybe next year.

1073
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:42,720
There isn't gonna be any next year.

1074
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,760
l'm retiring. You're not gonna
have Roscoe to kick around anymore.

1075
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:49,400
Wouldn't be the same without you.

1076
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,400
Someday, Bannon, you and Smith.

1077
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:59,080
Well, you know, l was thinking
about retiring too.

1078
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,880
No, really.

1079
01:36:28,279 --> 01:36:30,000
lt's a raid.

1080
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,040
Get those trucks over here.

1081
01:36:43,319 --> 01:36:46,760
Hustle, hustle, hustle. Out of the way.
Come on, come on.

1082
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,000
Okay, come on, move them out.
That's the ticket. Do that.

1083
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,560
What's going on here?

1084
01:36:59,159 --> 01:37:02,360
Well, as of 1 1 :OO,
you are illegally parked.

1085
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:08,320
That's according to California
Vehicle Code number 22658. 22658.

1086
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:16,720
-l want your name.
-Get on, man.

1087
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:22,320
At any rate, the fines will be levied,
and they will be hauled away.

1088
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:24,800
