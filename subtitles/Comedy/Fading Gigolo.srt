1
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,084
<i>You know, my
grandfather started the shop,</i>

2
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,730
<i>my father had it,
and now I have to close it.</i>

3
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,085
This is the end
of an era, my friend.

4
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,605
Let me tell you.

5
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,250
Nowadays, only...

6
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,563
rare people buy rare books.

7
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,523
You'll get back on your feet.

8
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,086
Hey, I have a very
funny story to tell you.

9
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,130
- Mm-hmm.
- Today I was at my dermatologist's

10
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,771
for a little procedure,
nothing serious.

11
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,888
You know, I'm talking
to her for a while.

12
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,327
- Mm-hmm.
- She tells me she was with her girlfriend,

13
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,448
and they-- they were
discussing things.

14
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,931
And they came to the conclusion

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,641
that they both wanted
to have a menage.

16
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,643
This is what she tells me.

17
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,768
And I-- I'm flabbergasted.

18
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,126
I say, "A menage a trois?"

19
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,168
And she said, "Yeah."
This is what she wants.

20
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,481
- This came out of nowhere.
- Out of nowhere.

21
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,564
The-- apparently,
she and her girlfriend

22
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,167
want to experience,
you know, a threesome.

23
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,210
And-- and she asked me,
do I know anybody?

24
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,090
And I-- I said--
I said, "Yeah.

25
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,844
"I know somebody,
but it'll cost you

26
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,331
a thousand bucks."

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,041
And-- And you know,
the truth is,

28
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,522
I was thinking of you.

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,364
- Me?
- Why not?

30
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,681
You-- You were always
great with women.

31
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,364
And, you know,
she's attractive.

32
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,965
She's round
and curvaceous--

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,964
I saw a photograph
of her friend in a thong.

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,890
And her friend
is a crippler, and she's--

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,604
Are you on drugs?

36
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,682
Apart from my Zoloft, no.

37
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,082
Well, why would I ever
entertain something like that?

38
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,491
How many-- How many days

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,050
you working now
at the flower shop?

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,565
- Two.
- Two, okay, so you're living

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,324
hand to mouth. Jesus.

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,210
Who bailed you out when you couldn't
make the rent money last month?

43
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,486
Yeah, but I paid you back.

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,967
Yes, you paid me back,
but basically you're out of work.

45
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,201
And you're closing shop.

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,611
And I'm closing shop.
Exactly.

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,011
Of course,
I would, you know,

48
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,570
get a little taste of this.

49
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,688
I mean, I-- I saw myself

50
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,411
getting a small fee.

51
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,642
How long do you know me?

52
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,449
Long? I've known you
since you were a kid,

53
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,171
since you broke into
this bookstore and tried to rob it.

54
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,246
Papa Mo, I'm sorry
you lost your job.

55
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,443
Your mother still has her job,
so thank God for that.

56
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,602
<i>Papa Mo, what does
this word mean?</i>

57
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,923
E-n-s-o-r-c-e-l-l-e-d.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,968
"Ensorcelled" is, you know,

59
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,684
like "enchanted,"
like when a--

60
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,081
a sorceress casts
a spell on you.

61
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,810
Don't you go getting
yourself enchanted

62
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,081
while mama's away at work.

63
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,049
This is how she talks
to the man who put her

64
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,565
through bartender school.

65
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,325
- Mm-hmm.
- There's lice in my class, Papa Mo.

66
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,607
- I think I got lice.
- Lice?

67
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,449
My hair itches.

68
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,488
Oh my God.

69
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,568
No, no, no! Don't touch,
don't touch anything.

70
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,450
Nothing in the house.
Don't touch a thing.

71
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,602
Now I'ma have to bring your ass
back to the lice lady.

72
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,284
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Murray.</i>

73
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,084
<i>It's Dr. Parker.</i>

74
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,128
Dr. Parker, is something wrong?

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,851
<i>Were you serious?
Knowing someone?</i>

76
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,729
Oh. Oh.

77
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,529
<i>My husband's got
a lot of money, Murray,</i>

78
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,329
<i>- and I'd like to--</i>
- Hang on a second.

79
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,644
Excuse me.
Let me take this in my office.

80
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,529
Maybe I should
try your guy out first.

81
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,807
Alone. Just me and him.

82
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,127
You know, kind of like
an out-of-town tryout.

83
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,969
<i>Exactly, like a sneak preview.</i>

84
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,889
Yeah. Is he clean?

85
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,724
<i>Yes, of course he's clean.</i>

86
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,404
I mean, I don't want to get AIDS.

87
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,204
<i>- AIDS?</i>
- Or gonorrhea.

88
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,362
<i>Gonorrhea?
Jesus, what are you talking about?</i>

89
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,920
<i>He's a nice kid.
I know him personally.</i>

90
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,281
- And he would tell you?
- Yes, he would.

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,205
You know, as far as I know.

92
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,770
And he's got protection?

93
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,081
<i>Sure, he's got protection.
The guy's a pro.</i>

94
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,371
I'm a little crazed.
I just came from an AIDS benefit.

95
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,283
So...

96
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,971
- We're really going to do this?
<i>- We're definitely going to do it.</i>

97
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,445
I mean, I'm not going to be there.

98
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,211
<i>- Okay.</i>
- You know, I just have to,

99
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,169
you know, check out his availability,

100
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,807
because, you know,
he's highly in demand.

101
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,087
Lover boy.
What are you doing in that closet?

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,365
Checking for lice.

103
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,808
- He's always checking for something.
- Oh my god.

104
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,845
You need a young,

105
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,571
slick, leading man type.

106
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,404
This is exactly my point.

107
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,482
I am not a beautiful man.

108
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,370
Did I say you were beautiful?
But you have a different quality.

109
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,442
You have a certain kind of sex appeal.

110
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,841
- Thank you.
- Is Mick Jagger a beautiful man?

111
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,288
The guy opens his mouth to sing.
It's a horror.

112
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,125
But he's hot. Mick is hot.
And that's what you have.

113
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,531
Let me ask you a question.

114
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,444
You look good
without your clothes, right?

115
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,409
How do you know?

116
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,290
Because some guys just look better
when they're naked.

117
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,964
I figured you're one.

118
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,849
What does that have to do
with Mick Jagger?

119
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,769
He's rich and he's famous.

120
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,285
Yes, but you're sexy.

121
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,767
- Says who?
- Says me.

122
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,683
You're a sick man.
You need help.

123
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,450
I go for help twice a week.

124
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,568
You need a guy like...

125
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,967
Tom Ford or George Clooney.

126
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,482
You're not that.
You're a-- you're a--

127
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,244
a man's man in a certain way.

128
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,646
You're-- you know,

129
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,449
you're not afraid to get dirty.

130
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,682
You get your hands dirty.
You're working with plants.

131
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,889
Earth. You're with
wires and plumbing

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,844
and drain pipes
and bowls, you know.

133
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,809
You do disgusting work.
You're not afraid--

134
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,690
Hey. You're disgusting
in a very positive way.

135
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,922
Thank you.
That's always nice to hear.

136
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,405
You know, women--

137
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,483
women have always liked you.
All kinds of women.

138
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,925
You do great with them.

139
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,566
Blondes, brunettes,
redheads, Asian women.

140
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,887
- Pregnant women.
- Not for money.

141
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,450
Hey. Am I saying "for money"?

142
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,449
You're going to make
somebody happy here.

143
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,851
Listen, I'm not a young man.

144
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,445
- You understand?
- You're not young.

145
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,010
But you're an experienced lover.

146
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,043
Why shouldn't you get paid for it?

147
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
Am I your friend?

148
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,124
You're more than a friend.

149
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,925
And you wanto to turn me into a ho?

150
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,365
Would I-- Would I steer you wrong?

151
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,601
So what's the split?

152
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,569
Okay. Now, now we can discuss things.

153
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,926
I didn't say I was interested.

154
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,326
I want to know, what would it be?

155
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,483
Well, you know,
an agent gets 10% usually.

156
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,443
A manager will take 15%.

157
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,807
The guys in the art galleries get 50%.

158
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,526
- They split 50-50.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,682
I'd say 60/40 would be nice.

160
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,286
You know, favoring you.
Favoring you.

161
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,081
All right, let me think about it.

162
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,167
As soon as we get
the lice out of his head,

163
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,691
I'll take you on the carousel.

164
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,165
Can I go on The Twister?

165
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,805
Yeah, we'll do it all.

166
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,649
You know,
I just want to get him de-loused.

167
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,205
- I got a question, Uncle Mo.
- What?

168
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,687
Why do all these people have--

169
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,848
- What?
- Curlies and beards?

170
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,803
Yeah, and sideburns.

171
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,729
For warmth.
It's for warmth.

172
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,402
- Unbelievable.
- I was merging!

173
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,482
I was merging right straight
across the street.

174
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,086
What are you, blind, cowboy?
There's a stop sign right there!

175
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,606
What's the matter with you people?

176
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,725
...In the car with
a herniated disc.

177
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,041
If anything happens to her,
let me tell you something,

178
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,685
There's going to be
a big problem here.

179
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,002
- I don't want any trouble.
- You got to be kidding me!

180
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,851
What happened?

181
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,566
- Watch your tzitzit!
- Thanks, Dovi!

182
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,761
Are you all right, honey?

183
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,968
If anything happens
to my wife, you're--

184
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,768
I'm very sorry--

185
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,923
Take it easy? This guy just
rammed right into me and my wife.

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,607
- Look at the dent.
- I see the dent. It's a bad dent.

187
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,762
I'm not excited!
Get off my back!

188
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,968
Where's the police?

189
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,486
Jesus Christ!

190
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,961
Speak English!
You're in Brooklyn!

191
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,442
We speak English!

192
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,967
You're not in the old country no more!

193
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,281
This is Brooklyn!

194
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,645
Miss, could you back?

195
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,164
Mommy, what's wrong?

196
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,564
Who were those guys?

197
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,206
Shabbes goys.

198
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,891
Hey. Is it my imagination,

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,082
or do I know you from someplace?

200
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,646
Have I met you before?

201
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,529
You bought my husband's s'farim.

202
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,568
Exactly. Exactly.

203
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,284
I bought your husband's books.

204
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,165
Of course.
He died 2 years ago.

205
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,924
Right. A heart attack.

206
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,731
Oh, Jesus.
He was a wonderful rabbi.

207
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,001
A great man.

208
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,208
Hey-- hey!
I went to the shiva.

209
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,931
I-- he had a wonderful
collection of books.

210
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,361
I knew--
I knew I knew you.

211
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,522
I-- what's--

212
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,170
What's the story on his hair?

213
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,050
He's got lice or--
how big is a louse?

214
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,963
The size of a sesame seed.

215
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,764
- You see?
- Oh, Jesus.

216
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,245
You know, I brought gloves.

217
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,601
Because I'm not going
to touch these kids.

218
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,648
- I'm not going to touch it.
- Don't worry.

219
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,960
They don't usually go for men.

220
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,042
I'm going to wear
the gloves anyhow, you know.

221
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,691
The blood. Too acidic.

222
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,841
Hasidic?

223
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,045
How do you do?

224
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,811
Hello. Nice to meet you.

225
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,441
These are for you.

226
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,205
How sweet.
What is that?

227
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,005
The arrangement?
It's Japanese.

228
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,764
My friend, Niho,

229
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,842
told me how to make it.

230
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,529
Please come in.
Make yourself at home.

231
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,170
Thank you.

232
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,411
- So...
- It's a beautiful day.

233
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,050
Yes.

234
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,128
Shame to be inside.

235
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,929
We have a balcony.

236
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,088
Nice.

237
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,771
- So you're a doctor.
- Dermatologist.

238
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,362
- You have good skin.
- My mother had good skin.

239
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,920
Even in her 80s, barely a wrinkle.

240
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,690
You couldn't tell her age.

241
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,046
You were close?

242
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,724
Mm-hmm.

243
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,410
That's unusual.

244
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,250
I've never done this before.

245
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,370
- First time.
- Yes.

246
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,726
- Mm-hmm.
- Well--

247
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,406
- I understand.
- Yeah.

248
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,450
- You do this often.
- No. I mean--

249
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,807
So this is kind of a part-time thing.

250
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,810
Yes, you could say that.

251
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,090
I-- I think I should--

252
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,242
- Let me get you-- you want this?
- Yeah.

253
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,402
- Same, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,482
Watch.

255
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,329
I'm married.
Did you know that?

256
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,489
Uh-huh.
Is that your husband?

257
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,967
Claude.
He's a mountain climber.

258
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,970
Huh. A good-looking man.

259
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,326
Yes.

260
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,208
Do you like the music?
I could change it.

261
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,044
No, it's perfect.

262
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,805
- It's instrumental.
- Ah, that's better.

263
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,164
Do you want me
to take my clothes off?

264
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,322
No, no, not yet.

265
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,331
Okay, just... maybe after.

266
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,489
This is so...

267
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,602
high school.

268
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,527
Oh, I, I, I--

269
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,406
Oh, I--

270
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,605
I didn't go all the way
in high school.

271
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,526
It's slow. It's fine.

272
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,483
Relax.

273
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,449
Mortality is a very iffy thing.

274
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,689
I mean, you're here one day,
and then something happens,

275
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,127
and the next day you're gone.

276
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,562
And the world goes on without you.

277
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,129
It's a--

278
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,171
You know...

279
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,926
actually...

280
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,329
when something terrible happens,

281
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,925
you know, like a--

282
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,451
an earthquake, maybe,

283
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,731
or-- a pogrom,

284
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,404
I think it's not

285
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,007
a bad idea sometimes

286
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,731
for a person to reach out.

287
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,202
- To a rabbi?
- Sure, a rabbi's good.

288
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,328
A rabbi's good.

289
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,283
But...

290
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,801
I think it's very nice sometimes

291
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,248
to reach out beyond the rabbi.

292
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,483
I mean, something more.

293
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,967
Venture further out.

294
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,207
I don't care.

295
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,602
Fuck you.

296
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,925
Fuck you, Claude!

297
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,321
So how long were you up there?
Two hours?

298
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,169
Right. Around.

299
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,009
But I'm not sure I understand you.

300
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,691
Are we charging,
you know, by the hour?

301
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,205
What, you're asking me?

302
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,766
No. What I assumed,
naturally, was that it was,

303
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,763
you know, we be charging per--

304
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,961
you know, per shot.

305
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,644
How many times did you do it with her?

306
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,449
- More than once?
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,251
Really? I'm very impressed.

308
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,048
Viagra?

309
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,969
Oh, no.

310
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,926
I-- I don't believe this.

311
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,570
You don't even open the envelope.

312
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,081
- Hey, she's your doctor.
- Yeah, she's my doctor,

313
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,844
but you know, in today's world,

314
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,804
she could turn out to be
a psychopathic ax murderer.

315
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,531
Well, thanks for telling me.

316
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,210
Wait one second. I'm counting.

317
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,481
I-- I don't understand this.

318
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,131
Where'd you get the extra 500 bucks?

319
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,009
- Tip.
- A tip?

320
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,889
- She tipped you?
- Yeah.

321
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,570
She must've really liked you.

322
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,921
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

323
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,565
You know, I hate to bring this

324
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,451
to your attention,
but the general protocol,

325
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,888
certainly among waitresses
is they'll pool their tips,

326
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,401
and they split them.

327
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,761
- Take two.
- Two.

328
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,362
Perfect.
I think that's appropriate division.

329
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,683
1,500 for you
and 1,000 for me.

330
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,969
Very nice day's work, let me tell you.

331
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,405
I-- this, you know,

332
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,249
This makes it official.

333
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,600
I'm your ho.

334
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,042
Hey, it's the oldest profession.

335
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,290
Thanks, honey.

336
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,209
You know, I picked out
the fabric myself.

337
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,520
Oh, that's beautiful.

338
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,763
I think I was high on acid
at the time.

339
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,127
Oh, feel it.
It's great.

340
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,322
Yeah, yeah, it's--

341
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,126
Yeah, it's stuffed with
turkey feathers or something.

342
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,441
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

343
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,443
Wait, calm yourselves.

344
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,923
Oh, a gigolo?
It's in the music business.

345
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,287
They, you know,
there's the music and lyrics--

346
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,209
- Oh yeah.
- And the gigolo parts.

347
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,004
It's me, Fior.
Is Murray home yet?

348
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,367
I can't get through to him.
He hasn't been picking up.

349
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,529
No, no no no.
There's no problem.

350
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,369
All right,
just tell him that I called.

351
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,801
Thanks. Bye.

352
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,002
Waiting for someone?

353
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,320
No.

354
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,004
Would you like some company?

355
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,730
- For how long?
- An hour or two.

356
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,526
Whatever you like.

357
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,571
Le professione
del vechio del mondo.

358
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,047
I don't understand.

359
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,766
I think you do.

360
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,090
Shimshon. How are you?

361
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,248
Good. You going
to play baseball, Dovi?

362
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,648
Yeah.

363
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,529
Go, Twisters.

364
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,965
Tell your mother I said hi.

365
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,082
Okay, I will.

366
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,363
Short men always pursued me.

367
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,364
My brothers, who are really tall,
would get so upset.

368
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,761
"Why can't you find a tall man?"

369
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,884
Like it's easy.

370
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,047
Good skin?

371
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,283
Soft. Silky.

372
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,731
Sense of humor?

373
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,650
Well...

374
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,802
Too much honey,
get away from me.

375
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,526
A man needs to be funny, no?

376
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,290
A man needs to be a man,
not a woman.

377
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,686
Not a pretty boy.

378
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,131
Perfect.

379
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,685
A beautiful son of a bitch,

380
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,643
He tells you that he loves you,

381
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,161
but he's really
thinking something else.

382
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,965
I don't think we got that far.

383
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,606
So, if this--

384
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,411
does he have a name?

385
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,970
Fioravante.

386
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,481
I like it. Sexy.

387
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,489
Mm-hmm.

388
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,523
So...

389
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,325
If this Fioravante...

390
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,205
was an ice cream cone,

391
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,201
what flavor would you
say that he was?

392
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,924
Pistachio.

393
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,571
Perfect.

394
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,523
Yeah.

395
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,401
Maybe I should try him, hmm?

396
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,091
No? Why not?

397
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,686
Hmm?

398
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,562
Pistachio.

399
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,166
Hey, we're in demand.

400
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,844
Why don't you just announce it?

401
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,002
Yeah, that's a pretty
nice-looking lady.

402
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,684
We got another customer.
Maybe more.

403
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,126
- Really. How?
- Yeah, how?

404
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,089
Word of mouth.
Hi, God bless you, girls.

405
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,851
Keep--
she likes tall guys.

406
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,371
You know, I mean,
you got to see her.

407
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,051
You're not going to believe it.
You can't be blase about this.

408
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,360
She is...

409
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,090
well-constructed, anatomically.

410
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,811
I mean, I'm talking about,
like, a miracle of physics.

411
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,211
I don't know what keeps her up.

412
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,611
Is this Dr. Parker's friend?

413
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,444
Dr. Parker's wealthy friend.

414
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,124
Shh!

415
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,043
Dr. Parker's rich friend.
Do me a favor.

416
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,844
Think of it as a performance.

417
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,842
- Uh-huh.
- You know?

418
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,003
Because that's what they want.
They want you to play act anyhow.

419
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,770
And the billing?

420
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,644
Above the titling.

421
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,484
I'm going to give you
a prepared envelope,

422
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,766
and we'll put something in it.

423
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,081
And then if they give you
a gratuity or something,

424
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,249
I'll give you
a second envelope for that.

425
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,170
I know what you're thinking,
but it seems right to charge.

426
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,480
It doesn't always feel right.

427
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,325
Yeah, only because
you never did it before.

428
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,801
It's like anything else.
A butcher, first day on the job,

429
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,764
he's got to cut up a cow.
There's blood, there's bones.

430
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,360
You know, so it's got to be awful.

431
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,801
But he becomes eventually a butcher.

432
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,211
These are vulnerable people.

433
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,726
Well, what, do you feel guilty?

434
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,608
A bit.

435
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,042
- Well, that's okay.
- I don't have a problem with the money.

436
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,770
- It's just--
- Yeah, I know. I know.

437
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,450
It's the morality.
I understand.

438
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,803
Because it's a commercial venture.
But-- But don't think of it that way.

439
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,723
Think of it that
you're boosting the ego.

440
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,565
You're helping their self-esteem.

441
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,846
Yeah, maybe that dilutes it.

442
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,200
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

443
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,850
It dilutes it, because--

444
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,167
take a bartender.
I hate bartenders.

445
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,806
Do you know why?
Because they thrive

446
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,651
on other people's misery.

447
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,240
But-- but I can't cast aspersions.

448
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,924
You got to make a living in this life.

449
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,526
Come on, let's have a drink.
You look depressed.

450
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,803
- Okay.
- Okay. Here, this is Grey Goose.

451
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,369
It does not leave
a trace on your breath.

452
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,131
- L'chaim.
- Okay.

453
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,844
I love it. I love it. Smooth.

454
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,883
- Smooth. Mm-hmm.
- So.

455
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,088
Can I tell you
what I've been thinking?

456
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,686
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm thinking that you need a name.

457
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,131
Yeah, like what kind of name?

458
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,804
You need a name
because you're a brand.

459
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,769
You're a product now.
You know. A stud's name.

460
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,882
Like Spanish Jack

461
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,163
or Johnny Barracuda or something.

462
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,487
Big dick.
You know, something filthy.

463
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,644
Call me Virgil.
Virgil Howard.

464
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,326
You know something?
Virgil was a guide.

465
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,329
And that's--
that's exactly what you do.

466
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,925
Virgil Howard.

467
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,729
We should put that on a marquee.

468
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,446
- What about your name?
- Why do I need a name?

469
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,444
Hey. If you're a pimp,
you got to have a name.

470
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,010
I don't think of myself as a pimp.

471
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,043
That's what you are.

472
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,931
Technically I'm a pimp.
Because--

473
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,490
I always leave that part out.

474
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,131
What about "Bookmaster Mo?"

475
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,043
- You like that?
- "Iceberg."

476
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,367
Iceberg's good. I like Iceberg.

477
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,324
What about "Dan Bongo?"

478
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,006
I like that.
I'll be "Dan Bongo."

479
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,320
It's nice to meet you, Dan.

480
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,890
Hey, Virgil and Dan.

481
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,445
Be the best you can.

482
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,760
I'll drink to that.

483
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,645
Is it you?

484
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,927
- Virgil.
- Virgil?

485
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,048
Virgil Howard.

486
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,726
I thought it was Fioravante.

487
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,406
- Once.
- Oh, I see.

488
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,323
A new day, a new name.

489
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,644
All of us have so many people
inside of us bursting to get out.

490
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,445
Buenas noches.

491
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,331
Hola.

492
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,243
You look good.

493
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,402
You look like a man.

494
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,209
Not too pretty.

495
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,248
Gracias.

496
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,362
Do you have any idea

497
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,240
what goes on inside a woman's head?

498
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,685
If I did, I wouldn't be here.

499
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,922
<i>Funny.</i>

500
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,242
You're funny.
I like that.

501
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,410
A woman is meant to be looked at.

502
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,405
Or else she'll just fade away.

503
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,609
Let's see what you can do.

504
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,203
<i>I just loved when
the shorts were short.</i>

505
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,169
<i>Dr. J, he had it all.</i>

506
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,168
The 'fro, the butt, the hands.

507
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,447
How tall are you, Virgil?

508
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,364
Me? I'm 6'1".

509
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,086
No, no, no, let's do this again.

510
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,680
How tall are you, Virgil?

511
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,803
6'6".

512
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,803
You like basketball?

513
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,082
When the ball is shared, yeah.

514
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,089
You're my kind of man.

515
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,929
You play?

516
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,963
A little.

517
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,451
What position?

518
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,921
Forward.

519
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,441
- Power forward?
- Mm-hmm.

520
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,042
You need to be in shape,
aerobicamente.

521
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,810
I don't get tired easily.

522
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,486
Oh, I don't get tired easily, either.

523
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,730
Excuse me.

524
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,604
- Hello?
Hey, babe, it's me.

525
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,721
- Si.
<i>- Is he there?</i>

526
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,001
Yes. Now what?

527
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,969
Yeah, he's here.
We're in the middle of the--

528
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,445
<i>I got to talk to you.</i>

529
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,166
Oh.

530
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,447
What, you're having second thoughts?

531
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,289
I'm having difficulty sharing.

532
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,686
<i>I mean, you gave me his number.</i>

533
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,082
<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

534
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,328
Oh, okay. Yes.

535
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,890
Not without you.

536
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,769
I promise, I promise.

537
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,006
- Okay, babe.
<i>- I love you.</i>

538
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,082
I love you, too.

539
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,244
Oh, fuck.

540
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,566
You know, I like it rough.

541
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,087
I like a man to be a man.

542
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,005
Got it?

543
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,360
Mm-hmm.

544
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,365
Sometimes I even like to be the man.

545
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,240
To strap on my gun.

546
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,004
Hmm?

547
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,851
Embrace the mystery.

548
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,089
I'll try.

549
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,051
<i>We're all just human.</i>

550
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,168
<i>We're all flesh and blood.</i>

551
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,080
<i>You know, I'm reminded of the story
of Simon Ben Lakish,</i>

552
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,925
<i>the great Jewish gladiator,</i>

553
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,968
<i>who came upon Rabbi Yochman</i>

554
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,650
<i>bathing in the Jordan</i>

555
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,161
<i>and became so excited</i>

556
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,884
he ran, he pounced on him.

557
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,167
I mean, he was all over him,
like a Greek.

558
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,045
Yes, but the rabbi
offered him his sister instead,

559
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,050
who was more beautiful
than Yochman himself.

560
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,849
Yes, but my point is that
everybody needs contact.

561
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,849
They need love.
They need affection.

562
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,485
- They need physical--
- Prayer.

563
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,961
Prayer. Sure.
Prayer, prayer, prayer.

564
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,246
Passion. Passion.

565
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,845
We need passione.

566
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,009
You know, if the blinds are drawn,

567
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,011
you know,
you got to pull the shade up.

568
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,363
Are you talking about a psychiatrist?

569
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,164
Psychiatrist, psychologist.

570
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,290
Uh, podiatrist. You know.

571
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,251
A massage therapist.
Some people do yoga.

572
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,169
Do you know such a person?

573
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,924
I do, as a matter of fact.

574
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,405
A healer.

575
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,529
Is he Jewish?

576
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,689
Jewish?
Yeah, yeah, he's Sephardic.

577
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,731
The-- his family
was expelled from Spain.

578
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,490
It was a terrible story,
the Inquisition.

579
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,211
A terrible thing.
On the run, always.

580
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,607
Fleeing, like Robin Hood.

581
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,802
Robin hood? Who is he?

582
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,570
Robin Hood.
You don't know Robin Hood?

583
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,129
Robin hood, an Anglo-Saxon
in the woods, with the sword,

584
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,043
and the bow and arrow.

585
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,730
Is he expensive?

586
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,561
It's what you call the sliding scale.

587
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,691
See you later.

588
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,371
Okay. See you later, okay?

589
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,649
We're going to be back
in just a little bit, okay?

590
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,002
<i> Make me sway <i>

591
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,448
<i> Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore <i>

592
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,522
<i> Hold me close <i>

593
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,648
<i> Sway me more <i>

594
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,563
No, you have to sit in the front.

595
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,404
Oh.

596
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,010
<i> Stand with me, sway with ease <i>

597
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,482

you have a way with me <i>

598
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,088
<i> Stay with me, sway with me <i>

599

<i> Only you have the magic technique <i>

602
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,249
<i> When we sway I go weak <i>

603
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,528
<i> I can hear the sound of violins <i>

604

<i> Long before it begins <i>

605
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,642
<i> Make me thrill

606
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,683
<i> Sway me smooth <i>

607
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,201
<i> Sway me now <i>

608
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,727
You get out of Brooklyn much?

609
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,526
I go to Queens sometimes
to visit my husband's grave.

610
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,366
<i> Other dancers may be on the floor <i>

611

Is this his private office?

619
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,928
Oh yes, don't worry.
This is completely private.

620
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,204
Hello.

621
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,041
This is Avigal.
Avigal, this is Virgil.

622
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,970
That's Avigal.
Virgil, Avigal.

623
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,965
- How do you do?
- I don't shake hands.

624
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,691
Oh, right, I forgot.

625
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,048
I'm sorry.
It's not allowed.

626
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,408
Um, well, so, you know...

627
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,409
- Yeah. Come in. Come in.
- Why don't you--

628
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,283
Are you Jewish?

629
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,528
Uh, Sephardic.

630
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,328
Donde hay amor, hay dolor.

631
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,890
Is that Ladino?

632
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,689
Yes.

633
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,762
What does that mean?

634
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,089
Where there is love,
there is pain.

635
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,321
True.

636
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,561
I should...
I should go.

637
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,325
Yeah, that seems
like a good idea.

638
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,363
How-- you'll be how long, you think?

639
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,922
I don't know.
Hour, hour and a half.

640
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,331
All right, so what I'll do is...

641
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,044
I'll-- maybe I'll walk around.

642
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,963
Or maybe I'll get
a cup of coffee downstairs.

643
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,889
And, you know,

644
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,450
so I'm just going to go.

645
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,443
- Okay.
- All right.

646
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,080
I'll just leave you two.

647
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,321
It's dark in here.

648
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,529
Would you like a glass of water?

649
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,802
No thanks.

650
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,769
Is that part of the therapy?

651
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,491
When you're ready.

652
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,280
So you're a...

653
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,089
a widow, huh?

654
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,367
Yes.

655
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,209
How long were you married?

656
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,561
18 years.

657
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,091
Children?

658
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,130
6.

659
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,964
Yeah, 6.

660
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,327
I would've had more,
but it took me a while

661
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,767
to get pregnant.

662
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,808
Really.

663
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,689
Well.

664
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,847
Why don't you...

665
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,640
make yourself comfortable?

666
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,245
Take your time, and...

667
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,610
I'll wait in the loo.

668
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,968
Get undressed,
and you tell me when you're ready.

669
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,322
Are you all right?

670
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,681
Mm-hmm.

671
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,609
May I take the sheet off?

672
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,086
Mm-hmm.

673
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,250
You know that guy?

674
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,845
What guy?

675
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,685
The little guy with the glasses.

676
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,649
He's been there over an hour.

677
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,842
Maybe he's trying to get a tan.

678
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,890
And who are you?

679
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,281
Shomrim. What is that?

680
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,368
Neighborhood patrol.

681
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,445
Sometimes we go beyond.

682
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,491
Here.

683
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,331
Drink some water.

684
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,444
Thank you.

685
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,409
Okay? You all right?

686
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,530
Yes.

687
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,331
It's just...

688
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,846
No one-- no one has...

689
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,290
for so long.

690
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,640
No one has...

691
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,611
Since-- Since your husband.

692
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,684
No, not him.

693
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,246
Touched me.

694
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,330
No one has touched me.

695
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,125
No, no. You get up front.

696
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,364
Thank you.

697
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,571
Fior, how're you doing?

698
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,370
All right.

699
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,044
What'll it be?

700
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,930
The usual.

701
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,929
Heavy on the potatoes.

702
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,769
Two eggs, scrambled soft.

703
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,042
Whole wheat toast, egg cream.

704
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,645
Vanilla!

705
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,684
So...

706
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,650
Denny tells me
you're a good plumber.

707
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,403
Yeah, I do a little.

708
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,245
That's good. I got a job.

709
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,961
I could maybe use someone
who could do a little...

710
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,605
plumbing.

711
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,041
You got a card?

712
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,327
No.

713
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,681
Write.

714
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,442
Thanks. I'll be in touch.

715
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,010
Hey, there.

716
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,406
Hey.

717
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,211
The world's a mysterious place.

718
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,766
Mm-hmm.

719
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,171
You didn't see us over there?

720
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,850
I was listening to the music.

721
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,691
Mm-hmm.

722
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,962
I'm with my husband.

723
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,963
Claude?

724
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,690
You remembered.

725
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,962
Tell him I said hi.

726
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,805
Oh, he's the jealous type.

727
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,130
It's my birthday.

728
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,567
Happy birthday.

729
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,171
<i>The number you have
reached is not in service.</i>

730
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,129
<i>Please check the number
and dial again.</i>

731
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,924
<i>Thank you.</i>

732
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,242
- Avigal.
- Dovi.

733
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,731
You look very nice.

734
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,040
Thank you.

735
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,122
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

736
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,971
Ah. The city? What for?

737
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,208
Doctor's appointment.

738
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,770
You need a lift? I--

739
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,569
I can give you a lift in the patrol.

740
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,086
No thank you.
I'll take the train.

741
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,889
It's okay.
I'll read my book.

742
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,566
You know, every time I speak with you,

743
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,246
it feels like you're always in a rush.

744
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,651
Maybe it's a coincidence.

745
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,444
Could be.

746
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,807
Makes me think you don't like me.

747
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,730
No, it's not that, it's just--

748
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,451
A widow needs time.

749
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,729
Time for what?

750
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,808
Time.

751
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,882
I'm sorry, it's just...

752
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,162
it's been two years.

753
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,566
I grew up right there, Avigal.

754
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,364
Every day, I saw you.

755
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,041
We never talked, but I saw you.

756
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,406
I know I'm not from a Rebbish home,

757
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,888
Avigal, but I'm-- I'm a good person.

758
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,844
Not right now.

759
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,803
If not now, when?

760
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,406
I have to go, Dovi.
Sorry, I can't be late.

761
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,010
See, you're always in a rush.

762
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,771
Make sure you're home before dark.

763
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,486
Why? It's not Shabbos.

764
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,640
Did you attend yeshiva?

765
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,285
Me?

766
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,887
No. No.

767
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,883
How long do you have?

768
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,962
An hour.

769
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,765
An hour and a half.

770
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,721
You know, I didn't expect
to see you again so soon.

771
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,282
I had a doctor's appointment.

772
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,646
Oh.

773
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,361
You like to read?

774
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,441
Mm-hmm.

775
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,165
Have you read that one?

776
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,009
I'm not supposed to.

777
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,283
But you did, right?

778
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,248
I had to get rid of all my books
when I got married.

779
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,251
Well, men have never
wanted women to read.

780
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,051
Who's this? Your mother?

781
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,810
Mm-hmm.

782
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,360
She's pretty.

783
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,005
What was she like?

784
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,208
Like?

785
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,680
She was just a woman

786
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,446
who never got the breaks.

787
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,530
Here we go.

788
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,323
- Here, let me.
- I was going to--

789
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,482
Debone it?
I don't mind.

790
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,404
It's kosher.

791
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,885
I'll get the...

792
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,166
You show me how you do it.

793
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,481
Hold down the fish with your fork.

794
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,121
Take your spoon, no rough edges.

795
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,611
Tease the spoon

796
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,162
under the flesh, gently.

797
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,164
Lifting the flesh away
from the skeleton

798
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,363
until you have a whole filet.

799
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,843
Then flip it over.

800
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,486
Then grab the tail that is still
attached to the skeleton.

801
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,490
And like a zipper, pull it off.

802
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,923
What about the head?

803
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,810
It's kosher.

804
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,042
It reminds you to look forward.

805
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,850
A real fish-eater eats the cheeks.

806
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,490
They're the delicacy.

807
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,366
Hmm?

808
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,323
For me?

809
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,444
Il boccone del re.

810
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,970
That's "the king's bite."

811
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,686
I knew you weren't a Virgil.

812
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,564
Fioravante.
What does that mean?

813
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,846
Flower.

814
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,527
What kind of flower?

815
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,728
Rudbeckia maxima.

816
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,963
That's a cabbage leaf coneflower.

817
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,931
A big six-foot plant
with big blue-green leaves

818
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,968
and bright yellow flowers.

819
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,889
And a big schnoz?

820
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,281
It's just a showpiece.

821
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,408
It doesn't really work.

822
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,968
When I was in...

823
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,407
sixth grade,

824
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,522
I used to sit next to this girl.

825
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,364
She was Jewish.

826
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,681
Good.

827
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,526
She had beautiful thick brown hair.

828
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,446
And I would only
look at her straight on

829
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,291
because I had seen my nose
in a three-way mirror.

830
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,606
You're a good cook.

831
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,842
Thank you.

832
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,844
For a man.

833
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,127
Hmm.

834
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,568
Do you have any family?

835
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,921
Not anymore.

836
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,047
And you're not lonely?

837
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,929
You get used to it.

838
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,883
So this is what you do?

839
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,486
I guess so.

840
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,685
You bring magic to the lonely.

841
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,571
That's one way to put it.

842
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,120
And you get paid for it.

843
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,291
Sometimes.

844
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,204
I don't have much time left.

845
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,123
Festina lente.

846
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,244
Hurry slowly, Avigal.

847
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,526
I like when you say my name.

848
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,648
Rudbeckia maxima.

849
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,125
You're going down, Papa Mo.

850
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,242
I'm killing you.
We should be playing for money.

851
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,322
You're not going
to get me out, old man.

852
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,811
Okay, you only missed it by a foot.

853
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,167
Turn around. More, more, more.

854
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,561
Okay, ready?

855
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,687
Strike two.

856
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,808
- You like baseball?
- Yeah.

857
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,922
The Spanish guys teach me.

858
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,527
Not like I'm so great or anything,
but you know, I could play a little.

859
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,329
Last game, we lost 20 to 3.

860
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,609
Would've been worse,
but they got this mercy rule thing.

861
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,408
What do you think?
Money laundering?

862
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,970
Organ traffic?

863
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,644
What?

864
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,051
Avigal?

865
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,289
That she should be
involved in such a thing.

866
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,880
Organ traffic,
where do you get that stuff?

867
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,411
- I read it--
- Stop talking.

868
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,567
Okay, you guys.

869
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,603
This is going to be my spitter.

870
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,046
- Yeah!
- Way to go, Cefus!

871
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,650
Aah!

872
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,885
Shh. Listen to me.

873
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,280
Haitian Day parade...

874
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,243
five bottle rockets
I took right to the chest.

875
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,203
Did I cry? Did I make a sound?

876
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,800
Not a peep. I took it.
Like a Sabra, I took it.

877
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,201
Don't forget your envelope.

878
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,730
You know, it's like candy,

879
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,963
Having sex with you.

880
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,761
You have one piece,
and you always want another.

881
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,491
Do you have a girlfriend?

882
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,040
I bet you don't say much.

883
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,964
Get them into bed.
Make them happy.

884
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,247
And then what?

885
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,166
The Portuguese have a word for it.

886
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,730
"Saudade."

887
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,561
Yeah. A longing for something
that doesn't exist.

888
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,323
I'm ready.

889
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,765
Let's do the menage.

890
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,888
Call Bongo.

891
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,042
Bongo? Oh yeah.

892
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,565
Murray.

893
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,648
Dan Bongo.

894
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,768
Have a piece of dark chocolate.

895
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,285
It's good for you.

896
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,481
You know, you're top shelf.

897
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,409
Hard to reach.

898
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,289
That's what makes you so good.

899
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,127
- Hi.
- Hello.

900
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:34,608
Gather round.
These are your kids?

901
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,048
We're going to divide up
into two teams

902
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,884
and play baseball, okay?

903
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,203
What do you think?

904
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,009
We don't play baseball.

905
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,082
We're very serious people.
We have to study.

906
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,606
Dovi plays.
Go, Twisters.

907
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,250
It's a waste of time.

908
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,771
Sometimes wasting time

909
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,241
is healthy for the body.
It's good.

910
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,210
I don't understand
the concept of competition.

911
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,886
He doesn't understand the concept.

912
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,689
You're overanalyzing.

913
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,683
- Blacks against whites.
- No, no.

914
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,286
That's not going to happen.

915
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,850
Not a good idea.
That's amazing.

916
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,765
This is why fascism
gets a toehold all the time.

917
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,042
You be on his side.
I want to break this up.

918
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,846
I want to get a little
Rainbow Coalition here, guys, okay?

919
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,163
Which one of these chosen people
do you want to play with?

920
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,410
I couldn't wait to see you again.

921
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,245
Ever see what's his name play?
Kevin Youkilis?

922
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,970
The Red Sox?
You know, he's got a...

923
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,850
You know, kind of a shifty thing here.

924
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,000
Here.

925
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,969
For me?

926
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,769
Yeah.

927
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,043
Lower your head.
Bend over.

928
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,930
Put your-- put your head up.

929
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,731
Down there. Ease up.
That's right. That's right.

930
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,002
Okay, now, I'll throw a couple to you.

931
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,129
Bend over.
You look like a question mark.

932
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,965
All right.

933
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,082
- Ready?
- Aim low!

934
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,924
De la rosa sale el espino.

935
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,681
Del espino sale la rosa.

936
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,009
From the rose comes the thorn,

937
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,084
from the thorn comes the rose.

938
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,925
You're beautiful.

939
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,082
You're really beautiful.

940
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,684
- Avigal--
- Shh.

941
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,570
You see me.

942
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,201
I don't have to be someone else.

943
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,601
That's enough.

944
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,526
Kiss me.

945
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,120
Let me look at you first.

946
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:47,884
The mishna warns a married woman
never to appear outside her home

947
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,406
with her hair visible.

948
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,962
Your husband, Avigal,

949
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,929
is gone.

950
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,484
Well, is he coming or not?

951
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,369
I'm so excited.

952
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,010
<i>Absolutely.</i>

953
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,242
Yeah, we're completely ready.

954
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,681
And the menage is on.

955
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,762
<i>Hey, I only wish I was there.</i>

956
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,531
Oh, Mr. Bongo.

957
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,045
You're nasty.

958
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,606
<i>I'm-- I am, but you're
the one who suggested it.</i>

959
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,769
Tell me. Have you ever...

960
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,530
done it before? You know...

961
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,364
<i>menage a trois?</i>

962
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,331
Yeah, in 1977, during a blackout.

963
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,528
We-- nobody could see anything.

964
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,967
But it was still very pleasant.

965
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,850
<i>You're naughty.</i>

966
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,123
Hey, you do remember that

967
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,409
a threesome is 2,000 bucks.

968
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,564
What is this?

969
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,483
I think you've got the wrong guy.

970
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,523
I've already been circumcised.

971
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,011
Come on, come on, come on.

972
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,690
Enough talk. In, in, in.

973
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,610
Get in. In. Good.

974
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,124
What'd I do? Break the dietary laws?

975
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,049
He's loose! He's moving!

976
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,009
He's on the loose!
He's on the run!

977
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,127
Get him, get him!

978
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,084
A number of rabbis
have questions for you.

979
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,889
Serious questions.

980
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,485
We have your consent, right?

981
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,325
I don't know what's going on.

982
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,926
I want to speak
to my lawyer, Sol Hirsch.

983
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,604
If it was up to me,
I'd tie you to a stone

984
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,047
and leave you
on the side of the road.

985
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,640
David had five smooth stones.

986
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,688
[speaks Yiddish]

987
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,524
I got this.

988
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,931
Hey, look, that's not funny.

989
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,971
I-- I have no idea
what crime I've committed.

990
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,003
Crime?

991
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,241
There's a certain woman

992
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,403
in our community, a widow,
a very special woman.

993
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,280
I've never seen her smile,
not like this.

994
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,646
But what you're doing...

995
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,803
it's not right.

996
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,042
- I'm coming!
- Come on, hurry up!

997
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,208
Youkilis!

998
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,243
Watch this!

999
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,124
Whoo!

1000
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,645
Tell Murray to be careful.

1001
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,324
Dovi is looking for him.

1002
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,210
<i>Dovi? Who's that?</i>

1003
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,523
<i>He's the man in charge
of the neighborhood patrol.</i>

1004
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,529
<i>We grew up together.</i>

1005
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,880
Does he like you?

1006
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,169
I don't know.

1007
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,971
Yes, very much.

1008
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,361
Why? Are you jealous?

1009
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,251
A little.

1010
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,125
Good.

1011
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,567
<i>I'm sorry I put you in this position.</i>

1012
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,083
Don't be.

1013
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,766
Will you be okay?

1014
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,969
I wish to know you more.

1015
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,890
But I'm happy
you're a little bit in my life.

1016
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,045
Me too.

1017
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,567
<i>Here comes high--</i>

1018
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,805
- Hello?
<i>- Hey.</i>

1019
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,922
- Hey, Fior.
<i>- Is Murray home yet?</i>

1020
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,081
<i>I can't get through to him.</i>

1021
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,806
He just ran out to get me some milk.
He should be back in a minute.

1022
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,484
- Everything all right?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

1023
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,489
You should see
this couch he bought me.

1024
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,045
Things are really looking up.

1025
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,168
<i>Yeah. They really are.</i>

1026
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,770
- Everything okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1027
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,120
<i>Let me know when he calls.</i>

1028
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,322
Okay. Bye-bye.

1029
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,570
Mom.

1030
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,085
My butt hurts.

1031
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,891
Mm-hmm, that's what I told you
about not eating your vegetables.

1032
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,325
No vegetables, no poop.

1033
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,171
I know, Mom.
Sometimes I'm stubborn.

1034
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:01,090
I know.

1035
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,481
Yeah, what's up, Fior?

1036
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,722
<i>You haven't heard
from Murray, have you?</i>

1037
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,041
No, why, is he in trouble?

1038
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,770
Shit, overheated.

1039
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,046
Does he need representation?

1040
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,770
- Can you deal with this?
- I'll try, man.

1041
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,205
<i>Yeah, well, he's disappeared.</i>

1042
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,442
<i>I think it's, like,
an orthodox thing or something.</i>

1043
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,284
- Satmar or Lubovitch?
- Satmar.

1044
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,805
Ay, those people are serious.

1045
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,002
You know, they wear
those big furry hats.

1046
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,731
I'll make a couple of phone calls.

1047
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,926
Well, what should I do?

1048
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,684
<i>You fill me in
and then wait by the phone.</i>

1049
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,649
<i>I know you want to help,
but if this is sit-down,</i>

1050
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:32,007
I'm sorry, you're not invited.

1051
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,566
- Who's this?
<i>- Othella. Who are you?</i>

1052
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,250
Who am I? Nobody.

1053
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:48,166
<i>I'm trying to reach Mo.
Is this (917) 292-1413?</i>

1054
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,567
<i>- Is Mo there?</i>
- She's looking to talk with you.

1055
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,126
<i>What's going on?
I don't want to know what's going on.</i>

1056
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,440
but don't hurt him.

1057
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,841
Okay? You touch him,
you touch one hair on his body,

1058
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,445
you're going to have to answer to me.

1059
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,000
I will pull a Michael Corleone on you.

1060
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,048
Michael Corleone?
Who's that?

1061
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,724
- Is that a threat?
<i>- Yeah, it's a threat!</i>

1062
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,251
The Godfather.

1063
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,771
Never heard of him.

1064
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,922
- Everything all right, Mom?
- Everything is fine.

1065
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,646
She doesn't sound Jewish.

1066
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,606
- Othella?
<i>- Murray?</i>

1067
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,920
- Yes.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

1068
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:19,848
No, no, no. It was--

1069
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,083
<i>It was an old friend
that I ran into from yeshiva.</i>

1070
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,407
<i>- An old yeshiva friend--</i>
- Mm-hmm. I don't believe you.

1071
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,367
<i>Why would I be lying?</i>

1072
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,687
- She thinks I'm lying.
- You are lying.

1073
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,206
<i>- Are you on your way home?</i>
- No no no.

1074
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,651
Something's come up,

1075
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,122
and I'm going to be home later.

1076
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,611
<i>When?</i>

1077
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,687
When am I coming home?

1078
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,285
If you're coming home.

1079
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,006
Come on, come on.

1080
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,969
Get him out, get him out.

1081
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,008
Why are you taking me here?

1082
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,407
Wh-- what holiday is this?

1083
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,801
Sol. Am I glad to see you.

1084
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,127
- How did you hear?
- Well, I got a call.

1085
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,969
Fior filled me in.

1086
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,809
You put him on the game
and you don't tell me?

1087
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,803
You don't what I went through
to get here today.

1088
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,042
My car died. So I hopped
on the Brighton Beach express.

1089
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,485
Transferred to the 48.

1090
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,682
Under Jewish law,
you're entitled to counsel.

1091
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,000
Pro bono, of course.

1092
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,481
Yeah, you'll pay me by the hour.

1093
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,521
Is anybody here?

1094
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,402
Take off your clothes.

1095
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,244
And your socks.

1096
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,687
Black socks are disgusting.

1097
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,566
Come. She's so soft,
like a stuffed animal.

1098
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,529
Come, touch her.
Touch her.

1099
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,409
We are gathered here

1100
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,689
with our brethren

1101
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,521
and one who has wandered
far from his tribe

1102
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,483
to commence this Din Torah.

1103
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,241
You the accused,
state your name.

1104
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,449
My name?

1105
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,965
Murray.

1106
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,522
Murray what?

1107
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,529
Schwartz.

1108
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,926
Can I put my laundry down?

1109
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,446
Gesundheit.

1110
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:48,445
Murray Schwartz,
are you proud to be a Jew?

1111
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,841
I'm proud,

1112
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,645
and I'm also scared.

1113
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,769
Do you celebrate
the Holy Shabbos?

1114
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,604
I-- I would love to,

1115
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,251
but, you know,
a guy's gotta make a living.

1116
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,567
When King Solomon ruled the world,

1117
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,570
if you broke the law,

1118
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:10,571
committed adultery,
murder, incest,

1119
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,041
- Transvestism--
- idolatry--

1120
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,447
- Bestiality--
- Pimpdom--

1121
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,403
You were finished!

1122
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,971
Ver gerharget!

1123
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,247
Stoned by the mob.

1124
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,249
It's really rarely, rarely enforced.

1125
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,606
Maybe once every 70 years.

1126
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,451
I mean, otherwise
we're accused of barbarism.

1127
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,646
Aah!

1128
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,768
You're completely
blonde down there.

1129
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,247
Yeah, that's why I make
Anthony do the highlights,

1130
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,523
- So that it matches.
- I can't believe we're doing this.

1131
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,490
This was your idea.
You called Bongo.

1132
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,881
I did. Mm-hmm.

1133
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,690
I'm sorry, I just...

1134
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,922
What's the matter, baby?

1135
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,609
I can't.

1136
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,611
Preoccupied?

1137
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:16,167
These things happen.
I'm psychic.

1138
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,567
Maybe it's the money.

1139
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,449
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe the money's blocking him.

1140
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,484
Listen, we can do it for free
if that's going to make you feel better.

1141
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,284
- Mm-hmm.
- No, it's not.

1142
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,128
- You don't like us anymore?
- No.

1143
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,607
He's in love.

1144
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,967
You think, like real love?

1145
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,969
Yeah.

1146
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,931
Look at him.

1147
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,440
That's beautiful.

1148
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,727
I'm so happy for you.

1149
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,404
Yeah.

1150
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,131
<i>Has this man
ever studied his oral law?</i>

1151
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,770
<i>I have, and I find it</i>

1152
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,330
<i>a dialectical taffy-pull.</i>

1153
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,084
<i>I mean, I have been
taught since I was a kid</i>

1154
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,128
that sex is filthy and forbidden,

1155
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,282
and I think that's
the way it should be.

1156
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,771
And in my opinion,

1157
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,922
the filthier
and the more forbidden it is,

1158
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,490
the more exciting it is.

1159
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,807
I don't think this is
the group to push that point.

1160
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,486
- I'm not a scholar--
- Enough already!

1161
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,886
Was there fornication?

1162
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,123
The question is,
was there fornication?

1163
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,281
Was there fornication?

1164
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,290
There was no fornication!

1165
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,364
May I speak on my own behalf?

1166
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,368
Please, proceed.

1167
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,044
There was a breach of modesty.

1168
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,531
I was alone with a man.

1169
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:58,127
He saw my head uncovered.

1170
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,089
You took off your sheytil?

1171
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,326
Yes.

1172
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,004
And your body.

1173
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,890
Did he see it uncovered?

1174
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,886
He placed his hands on my back.

1175
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,684
It was bare?

1176
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,886
Yes.

1177
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,650
<i>You did that knowing full well</i>

1178
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,650
<i>that what you were doing
was a violation?</i>

1179
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,721
<i>I did.</i>

1180
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,571
And you allowed yourself
to be touched?

1181
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,083
Yes.

1182
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,043
And what, may I ask,

1183
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,441
happened next?

1184
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,570
I cried.

1185
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,927
From shame?

1186
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,771
No.

1187
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,240
From loneliness.

1188
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,569
I got jealous.

1189
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,202
It's hard for a man
to understand a woman,

1190
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,248
you know?

1191
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,005
What goes on, you know, the--

1192
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,366
the feelings.

1193
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,205
I know, I know, I'm boring.

1194
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,651
But if a man can't get a woman

1195
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,286
out of his guts...

1196
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,445
if he can't get her out of his heart,

1197
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,602
it means something.

1198
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,761
Right?

1199
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,489
I'm in love with you, okay?

1200
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,041
All right?

1201
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,083
I know, I know, maybe
you don't love me, but--

1202
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,764
Just be quiet.

1203
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,123
I never said I didn't love you.

1204
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,288
Really?

1205
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,323
Oof.

1206
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,805
Who is it?

1207
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,529
I've come to say goodbye.

1208
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,371
You didn't have to do that.

1209
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,642
I wanted to.

1210
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,369
What are you going to do?

1211
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,163
I don't know.

1212
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,441
Something.

1213
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,764
Donde hay amor,

1214
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,046
hay dolor.

1215
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,131
It's true.

1216
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,049
Goodbye, Fioravante.

1217
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,480
Goodbye, Avigal.

1218
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,682
Take care of her.

1219
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,569
Don't worry, I will.

1220
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,330
You're not really Jewish, are you?

1221
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,885
I'm not sure.

1222
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,410
Huh.

1223
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,282
Then we add the chocolate syrup.

1224
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,082
- Thank you.
- Enjoy. You're welcome.

1225
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:18,091
So, you're leaving, right?

1226
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:19,403
Yep.

1227
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,091
I'm gonna miss you.

1228
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,046
Me too.

1229
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,407
I mean, I don't know what to say.

1230
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,689
There's nothing to say.
You just water it.

1231
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,287
I'm done.
The show's closed.

1232
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,970
So first the bookstore,

1233
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,248
then Virgil and Bongo--

1234
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:41,844
although that was probably,

1235
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,366
in retrospect, a crazy idea.

1236
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:47,205
Who knows?

1237
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,770
You're definitely going, right?

1238
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,410
That's right.

1239
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,006
So that's funny,
because when you're friendly

1240
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,043
with somebody for a long time,

1241
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,920
what happens is,
you develop a, you know,

1242
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,326
like, a shorthand or something,

1243
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:03,171
a close communication.

1244
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,851
You-- You understand one another

1245
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,770
in a...

1246
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:13,483
You go and look up
the little Tunisian girlfriend?

1247
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,489
I don't know.
I mean, I--

1248
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,967
It's funny, I can only
speak to her in present tense.

1249
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,881
Well, maybe if you
spoke to her properly,

1250
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,803
you'd find that you didn't like her.

1251
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,005
That's a possibility.

1252
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,210
You know, I have a theory

1253
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:30,210
that sometimes when
you don't understand

1254
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,606
what the other person is saying,

1255
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,650
very often that's
a tremendous advantage.

1256
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,006
Yeah.

1257
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,483
"Cherries in the Snow."

1258
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,131
- Ca vous plait.
- Oui.

1259
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,168
- Merci.
- D'accord.

1260
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,566
Ah, tu parles Francais?

1261
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,968
Mmm, petit peu.

1262
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:57,123
A gentleman.
That's very nice.

1263
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,242
Are you from around here?

1264
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,330
Yeah. Why do you ask?

1265
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,081
Just being neighborly,
and I'm thinking,

1266
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,124
if you ever need a plumber,

1267
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,885
this is the guy.
He's great. A fantastic plumber.

1268
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,843
Oh yeah?
Well, that's good to know

1269
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,291
'cause they're hard to come by.

1270
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,330
- Absolutely.
- Mm-hmm.

1271
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,811
What's your name?

1272
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,645
Fioravante.

1273
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:25,529
That's lovely.
Is that yours?

1274
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,001
He-- he got that for me.
He gave me that.

1275
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,208
Mmm.

1276
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,409
You don't look like
a plumber, really.

1277
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,729
That's because
he also does electrical.

1278
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,285
- Oh. Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

1279
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,323
And you come together,
in a package?

1280
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,926
You know, he's shy.
So I handle the dialogue--

1281
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,764
He's shy?
He doesn't look shy.

1282
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,962
- I'm not shy.
- No, actually you're right.

1283
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:51,004
The truth of the matter
is that he's not shy.

1284
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,730
I'm the shy one of the two.

1285
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,325
You are flirting with me.

1286
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,731
- No.
- Yes.

1287
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,360
I am. I am.
You can tell, right?

1288
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,568
Oh yeah.
I can tell.

1289
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,205
Um, hey, sweetheart,

1290
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:09,126
can I... can I give you
our card just in case

1291
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,288
you need any plumbing work

1292
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,920
or any electrical wiring.

1293
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,405
"Virgil and Bongo."

1294
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,528
<i>Yeah, ask in the
neighborhood about us.</i>

1295
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,090
You know, we don't bite.
No problem.

1296
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:22,926
Okay. I will.

1297
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,529
<i>Au-re-wah-wah.</i>

1298
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,886
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1299
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,490
<i>Yes, definitely.</i>

1300
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,405
Wow.

1301
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:50,163
This definitely could be the beginning
of a very beautiful relationship...

1302
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,685
between the three of us.

1303
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,322
But...

1304
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,561
you know...

1305
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,211
when is it that you're leaving?
