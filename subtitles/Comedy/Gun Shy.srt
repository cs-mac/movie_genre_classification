1
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:35,221
I have given my life for 18 years.
They will catch me if I go on.

2
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:40,350
You have kept me this crap in the gap 14 months!

3
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:42,548
I can not handle it.

4
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:46,586
Set me as though retirement,
, but that stuff I can not take care of.

5
00:01:46,832 --> 00:01:49,027
I'm afraid too.

6
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:51,109
Lonny, the task is finished.

7
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:54,304
Lonny, it's over.

8
00:01:55,632 --> 00:02:01,070
Lonny,
Am I going crazy?

9
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:03,832
I do not think so.

10
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:07,911
I want a sea view and it is not unreasonable.

11
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:11,663
Check this out.

12
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,468
It's like a castle.
-Waiting for you to retire.

13
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:19,061
I am ready to retire.
-No way.

14
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,502
I am ready. I seem to like it.

15
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:25,307
I was a wonder boy and the hero
litkimme and beer together.

16
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,231
Now I want a sea view!
-Sorry!

17
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:31,469
I have been a good subject for 18 years.
Do not you think?

18
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:34,027
This was prepared 14 months.

19
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:36,706
Now the train starts, and you say, you can not.

20
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:39,824
I'm scared.
I'm not ashamed to admit.

21
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:44,622
Yes you were.
How does it feel to be in a tray?

22
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:50,628
How are you, friend?
This evening, just enjoyed.

23
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,981
Sit. I'll give you something to drink.

24
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:58,425
No!

25
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:13,268
Get me out of this task, Lonny.

26
00:03:15,752 --> 00:03:19,791
<i> Final boarding call </ i>
<i> flight to New York in 2057. </ I>

27
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:24,260
Wait a minute! It is my my flight!

28
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:26,503
Oh, Jesus Christ!

29
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:32,464
Can not be true.

30
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,748
Let me out!

31
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:26,344
It is enough. Thank you.
-Please.

32
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:28,463
What do you want?

33
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:36,982
Do you have a fear of flying?
No, I love flying.

34
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,824
You seem a little...
-That is correct.

35
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:47,145
Is everything all right?

36
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:51,464
It is, plain abdominal pain.
Must be the stress.

37
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:54,590
The work is very stressful.
-What do you do?

38
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:56,908
I work...

39
00:04:59,952 --> 00:05:03,069
What are you doing?
-I'm a psychiatrist.

40
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:07,784
Really?

41
00:05:38,592 --> 00:05:42,551
's A simple touch: Mafia to use
Colombian money.

42
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:45,027
That 90-day waiting period?

43
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:48,184
Await Colombians for so long?

44
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:51,111
They are not known for their patience.

45
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:53,109
Depending on the credit.

46
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:57,265
Fulvio Nesstraat draftsman? He is the only
muskelimies.

47
00:05:57,472 --> 00:06:00,032
Sala murderers Jeffrey Dahmer.

48
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:04,225
Diagram illustrates Minettin daughter,
may therefore play a role.

49
00:06:04,392 --> 00:06:06,303
Where the money is going on?

50
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:10,147
Vaillarin family
cartel is one of the richest.

51
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:13,861
I would say that this is
more than half a billion.

52
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:19,106
Difficult choice. Is the aim
arrest or Vaillarin the money?

53
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:23,385
Both. Collect the current
commitments and evidence.

54
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:25,862
You should already begin.

55
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:28,347
Lucy goes on watch.
-I.

56
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:30,707
You do not budge a long time.

57
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:35,070
Take the C-10's son.
Jesus Christ with you.

58
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:39,027
Chris, you apply for Juniper's Dave?
-I'm sorry!

59
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:45,503
Perhaps you want to hear the single,
who is familiar with the entire operation.

60
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,664
Vaillarin 'money can not be accessed.

61
00:06:48,912 --> 00:06:52,825
Money exchange current commitments
15-90 day intervals.

62
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:58,465
With such large sums moving,
people start dying like flies.

63
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:03,752
And if you have missed:
bad guys know.

64
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:05,664
Someone revealed to us.

65
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:09,262
We were in a tray,
Uzis stuffed up the ass!

66
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,743
I was like a game bird
Martha Stewart's kitchen!

67
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:16,951
The bad guys were shot.
-Warren Ganza is still at large.

68
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:20,741
Warren lacks credibility and contacts

69
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:23,904
All the players are now up to you, Charlie.

70
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:28,390
Okay, I'm involved in,
, but without a team.

71
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:32,665
No kyttäystä, no sirens
and no one will see it yourself!

72
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:40,064
I do not want to get this
other than a sea view.

73
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:47,581
He will not survive piece of the action.
-You do not know him.

74
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:50,300
Worst-case, he shines.

75
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:53,509
And we have no other options.

76
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:56,983
I know that he is a legend
drugs agency.

77
00:07:57,232 --> 00:08:00,827
He ruined  Miami-operation.
One of the men was killed.

78
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:05,588
Let him go on, but the
we must have an emergency plan.

79
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,585
Yes he will take until we can strike.

80
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:11,061
He does it by instinct.

81
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:16,350
Charles Mayo?
-Mayo.

82
00:08:16,592 --> 00:08:20,790
Mayo. I'm Dave Juniper.
I was assigned to taustatueksesi -

83
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:25,861
and I just want to say,
that you are one of my heroes.

84
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:29,707
Who are the other heroes?
-Keith Richards.

85
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:33,910
Remember,
I do not want to see you ever again.

86
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:56,865
Warren Ganza is still at large.

87
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:08,704
Not again!

88
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:27,501
I want to talk about my work.
Now this is confidential?

89
00:09:29,832 --> 00:09:31,868
This is new to me -

90
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:36,105
but I want to say,
I did not find any inner child -

91
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:40,305
I do not want to hear,
I am disappointed with my mother.

92
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:43,982
I do not give a shit,
if the mother was not perfect.

93
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:49,911
I do not know the reason, but I said to just
: "Mother, Mother."

94
00:09:50,112 --> 00:09:52,501
Over and over again.

95
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:58,229
I do not know...

96
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:01,741
Wipe your eyes.

97
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:12,111
Charles, time is running out,
but come back tomorrow.

98
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,109
We have just started.

99
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:18,191
Two hours ago. I can not go.
-I pay anything.

100
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:21,464
I stay, yes, but the
group therapy starting point.

101
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:24,789
I can not send more patients home.

102
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:29,870
Thank you.

103
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:34,663
Charles, you could stay in
group therapy.

104
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:38,871
No, no, no.
I'm not really able to share.

105
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:42,707
You need to share
more than anyone to feel.

106
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:45,512
City is a new,
situation untenable.

107
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:50,382
You suffer from a sense of alienation and a post-traumatic disorder.

108
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:52,981
You need support.

109
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:58,230
It is known
that is contrary to my nature -

110
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:01,270
have to face that.

111
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:05,141
Feigned innocence marginalized by necessity.

112
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:10,426
I asked him simple stuff thing:
"I would leave without buying the Mövenpick."

113
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:16,150
It tastes like chemicals. But he
offered as a dessert at the Mövenpick.

114
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:21,512
As a rule, when it's quiet,
meeting or dinner.

115
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:26,502
All of a sudden I feel the pressure to rise.

116
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:30,904
I can get punishment for good deeds,
rewarded me evil.

117
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:35,344
I was chairman for four years, and all of a sudden
Kramer got it Pallin.

118
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:38,106
I am indifferent.
-... the need to shout.

119
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:40,507
The bad guys always win.

120
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:45,541
It is humiliating!
-Am I not a man?

121
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:50,866
I got a huge need
to do something completely inappropriate.

122
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:53,103
Then I say to myself:

123
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:57,106
"If you extract your needs,
it will destroy your life."

124
00:11:57,272 --> 00:12:00,867
But it will only increase the pressure.
-What do you do then?

125
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:04,502
First, put my tongue between your teeth.

126
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:06,509
This.

127
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,668
Then stick my hand up to the chin.

128
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:19,908
But it hurts,
so then bite my hand.

129
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:25,551
Does it work?
-So far has worked.

130
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,181
Each knows how wants to live
-

131
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:32,431
and it is said that people get the
what you deserve. I do not think so.

132
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:35,186
Is that a fact or your own perception?

133
00:12:35,392 --> 00:12:38,304
I hate it when you talk to me
patronizing tone.

134
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:40,542
If we were living in hell -

135
00:12:40,752 --> 00:12:44,028
and I would say that it is hot,
I would be negative?

136
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:46,985
Not a negative
-You said it.

137
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:50,309
I do, I asked, only
whether it is your own perception.

138
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:55,672
All is based on the observation. Life,
ego. It's how I express myself.

139
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:58,904
Wherever I look,
the bad guys win.

140
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,905
Next week it is the theme of the session.

141
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,586
So am I now a burden?

142
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:08,262
You are not a burden,
but we have only 20 minutes -

143
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:13,187
and I would like to tell
Charles's recent problems.

144
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:27,028
I really hate watermelons.

145
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:33,029
The biggest problem due to my work.

146
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:35,023
Exactly where else.

147
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:40,987
The work has always been tough.
Still, I thought that everything was under control.

148
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:45,748
But the latest job ...
What does it do?

149
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,381
Cheemo Partell sang to me -

150
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:51,703
ass shot my partner and threw the window.

151
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:58,306
I was thrown into a serving table,
of watermelon. Etova odor.

152
00:13:58,512 --> 00:14:04,109
Cheemo then began to hum
ysimillisen and put in front of my face.

153
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:09,147
Just as he was ampumaisillaan,
guard and the team will be firing on all.

154
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:15,431
After that, I have been a little nervous.

155
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:19,428
But the worst of nightmares, that I see.

156
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:26,270
Fulvio Nesstraat whom
should be slots, it is psychoactive.

157
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:31,870
When I close my eyes, I see him,
even though I do not know what he looks like.

158
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:35,428
His gaze bores through me.

159
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:39,426
He knows what I think.
He ​​knows that I'm lying.

160
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:40,871
You're lying.

161
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:45,942
Did you think you could steal from me?
-I have not stolen, Fulvio.

162
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:50,862
Admit it, Larry.
Then you feel better.

163
00:14:51,032 --> 00:14:53,592
I swear on my children's life...
-Shut up!

164
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:59,110
Let me ask you something.
What do you think of Arabs?

165
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:05,189
L...
I do not really understand them.

166
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:08,151
The entire Middle should be from the bomb.

167
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:12,670
Typical bigoted reaction to the culture, you do not know anything.

168
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:18,190
Saudi Arabia can be left on the table
million, even though the two days.

169
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:21,390
Believe that they're honest people.

170
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:26,148
Not any more than the Americans,
but they will respect the law.

171
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:29,827
Muslim countries
thief cut off the hand.

172
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:33,223
I did not take it.
-Hand on the table!

173
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,950
No matter what it was.

174
00:15:35,112 --> 00:15:39,071
If we do not respect the property of
and the law, we are just animals.

175
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:41,700
Place the hand on the table.

176
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:47,381
This is fucking your newspaper!
Leave a neighbor alone.

177
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:52,145
Is the sports section?
-It is, it is.

178
00:15:52,312 --> 00:15:55,861
Did tiling the kitchen?
-It looks good.

179
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:59,184
Good.
Ask Barbara to play.

180
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:01,183
Change your clothes.

181
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:07,268
Did you go shopping for a new magazine?
No, it was behind a dumpster.

182
00:16:07,472 --> 00:16:10,908
're Lying.
I can see it in your eyes.

183
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:16,872
Am I a liar, Fulvio?

184
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:21,987
Crawled behind a dumpster looking for
your paper and you say liar.

185
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:26,302
I do not.

186
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:29,384
I'm not saying you are a liar.

187
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:31,907
You have a big heart.

188
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:35,821
Saved a hell of a thief
Journal of the loss of a hand.

189
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:46,868
Larry, will you in town?
I get a ride? The car is a workshop.

190
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,751
Charles, what do you say?

191
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:59,830
I'm getting dizzy
thick carpet.

192
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:02,347
I was buying.
-It's not imagoosi.

193
00:17:02,592 --> 00:17:05,743
Estuvio hates this.
Come on, talk.

194
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:12,548
Cheemon death was a shock.
-The situation was bad.

195
00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:15,107
Are we doing more and more business?
-Sure.

196
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:19,026
I heard that the FBI was involved.
No, it was Warren Ganza.

197
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:22,781
He wanted to division,
came in and shot all of them.

198
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:25,750
No negotiations.
Just mercilessly.

199
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,550
Is he the problem?

200
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:32,945
I told you that my family is no longer
not ready to Colombia kind of rodeo.

201
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:37,191
My father  trust me,
, therefore, I need to look good.

202
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:41,141
We're here to invest and the idea that you look great.

203
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:44,708
Warren Ganza is my problem and
Let's get him.

204
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:50,386
He drinks in 1 982 Margeaux'ta
tuna with. What show-off.

205
00:17:50,552 --> 00:17:53,624
Taste finger potatoes,
salmon and sour cream.

206
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,581
It is not the language to stand on!
-I want a simple coffee.

207
00:17:57,752 --> 00:18:00,585
Taste finger potatoes.
-No potatoes.

208
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:03,260
Coffee, milk and two sugars
.

209
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:06,862
If you are importing potatoes, I'll kill them both.
Coffee hot.

210
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:12,704
Shut up.
Jason, this is a business meeting.

211
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:16,825
It's not about the strange friendship between
and vegetables.

212
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:21,708
We meet a few hard type.
-Yeah. The same as I do.

213
00:18:21,872 --> 00:18:25,865
Have not  Scarsdale pojuja,
has also the city is ours.

214
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:28,751
They are two of the toughest mobster.

215
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:32,188
Do not like the yuppie,
a stondis.

216
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:37,227
Stay tonight for business
do not tilaile all the food.

217
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:40,066
Right.
I'm just trying to be a good host.

218
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:44,385
I like fun. What's wrong with that?
-Overrated.

219
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,550
Calm down.

220
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,902
You do not understand.
I do not think I can do it.

221
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:53,069
He sees it in my eyes.
-Cancel an appointment.

222
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:56,543
Do you think that
I can just reschedule?

223
00:18:56,792 --> 00:19:01,183
Take a deep breath and try to calm down.
You have a anxiety attack.

224
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:04,822
I'll give stronger pills,
it takes nervousness.

225
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:09,463
Take a pill an hour before the meeting.
Only one, you do not simahda.

226
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:12,704
And call this  gastroenterologist.

227
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:17,821
There is no harm
therapy for more than a continuous flatulence.

228
00:19:20,432 --> 00:19:22,662
Can not be true.

229
00:19:22,872 --> 00:19:24,669
Where is it?

230
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:27,824
Where is it a good, happy feeling?

231
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:37,144
One pill is enough, Doctor.

232
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:43,870
Nerves are still tight as a violin string.

233
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:43,991
There is one thing,
I would like to do.

234
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:46,660
I would like to enter into relations with Poland.

235
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:50,581
I like their cuisine, and if they dress nicely...

236
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:54,865
Their faces are soft.
Interesting people.

237
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:56,784
Charlie, I suppose.

238
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:00,147
Hello. I'm Jason Cane.

239
00:21:00,312 --> 00:21:02,542
Did you find it difficult to find here?
-No.

240
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:05,545
They are crazy about me.
This is gonna be great.

241
00:21:05,752 --> 00:21:08,789
You are already familiar with Fidel and Estuvion.

242
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:13,546
Charlie, this is Fulvio.

243
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:19,631
's Great.
Place the party started.

244
00:21:19,832 --> 00:21:21,743
Bring bubbly.

245
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:24,341
I'd take with mineral water.

246
00:21:24,512 --> 00:21:26,468
The same for me.

247
00:21:26,672 --> 00:21:28,583
Yoo-hoo.

248
00:21:29,512 --> 00:21:32,948
Do you have a beef stock?
-I'll see what I can do.

249
00:21:34,472 --> 00:21:38,306
The first major event.
Let's make it important.

250
00:21:38,512 --> 00:21:40,104
Start with.

251
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:42,069
Babes!

252
00:21:45,992 --> 00:21:48,586
What the hell is this?

253
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,544
All out now.

254
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:53,621
This is too much.

255
00:21:57,112 --> 00:22:00,707
What do you think about?
Shut up and listen!

256
00:22:01,712 --> 00:22:05,227
I do not know, why do you think
that you can behave like a nerd -

257
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:07,986
but your behavior makes me nervous.

258
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:13,266
We came here just to go through the
agreement, then we go home.

259
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:15,747
Are these your kids?

260
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:18,711
Yes, my child.
-Beautiful are.

261
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:21,830
Why have not you shown me
on their photos?

262
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:25,422
It's just retarded.
-Enchanting children.

263
00:22:26,632 --> 00:22:29,704
Such a face can change a man's life.

264
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,743
Who's that girl?

265
00:22:32,992 --> 00:22:36,951
He is Esmeralda.
Just looking mother.

266
00:22:37,192 --> 00:22:39,103
Ryhmäkuvakin is found.

267
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:46,302
Fidel, I understand why you wanted to
women. You have a wonderful family.

268
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:50,027
I was just trying to organize a joy.

269
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:52,985
I'm quite the nerd.
I apologize.

270
00:22:53,232 --> 00:22:56,781
's All right, Jason.
I was too tight.

271
00:22:56,992 --> 00:23:00,701
I am very sensitive to
kokadiilerin stereotypes.

272
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:05,781
It prevents me from relaamasta.
My wife tells me to loosen up.

273
00:23:06,032 --> 00:23:08,227
Fuck. Let's party started.

274
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:13,102
No, let's first
is business, and then celebrated. Is that okay?

275
00:23:14,232 --> 00:23:18,384
I'll go through the plan.
Is the stock market prediction familiar?

276
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:22,983
It is the case here as well.
I'll wash your money in such a way that...

277
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:45,145
How do I break down?

278
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:50,420
Minettit be
15% of investments and 50% of the profits.

279
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:55,103
What Minettit do it justice?
-Arrange the framework.

280
00:23:57,672 --> 00:24:00,061
Charlie, what do you think?

281
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:04,223
I want a sea view.

282
00:24:08,552 --> 00:24:12,625
What are you agonize over?
Let's do it.

283
00:24:12,832 --> 00:24:15,904
Celebrations start.
I have not danced in years.

284
00:24:16,152 --> 00:24:18,268
Babes, please come back!

285
00:24:18,512 --> 00:24:20,389
Now is celebrated.

286
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:26,502
Do you think
that the eyes are the window to the soul?

287
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:31,505
I have a good read of people's eyes.

288
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:34,629
It's nice.

289
00:25:36,832 --> 00:25:41,667
Right now, I read your eyes.
-What's the show?

290
00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:46,950
They show
that you are sleepy.

291
00:25:49,832 --> 00:25:54,860
But I can not make out,
you have taken too much medication -

292
00:25:55,112 --> 00:26:01,187
been working too hard or are you sick and tired.

293
00:26:03,112 --> 00:26:05,945
Maybe you have a weird sleeping sickness.

294
00:26:06,152 --> 00:26:08,950
Narkolepsu It's a miracle or something.

295
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:17,664
I'll kill, if you see strange sight.
I just wanted you to know.

296
00:26:33,432 --> 00:26:35,821
I wish I could sleep like that.

297
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:43,625
Oh fucking hell...

298
00:27:09,992 --> 00:27:12,950
You might have a bit of slow play.

299
00:27:13,112 --> 00:27:17,151
Must be the prostate.
You need more sex.

300
00:27:17,312 --> 00:27:19,223
Kysyinkö you something?

301
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:24,592
Do not be jealous just because
käärmeesi no longer slither.

302
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:29,461
Damn how incredible.

303
00:27:29,632 --> 00:27:34,547
Can not even go to the bathroom without having to pee
contest.

304
00:27:34,752 --> 00:27:37,186
You won the competition wee...

305
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:41,380
I won the shooting competition.

306
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,986
This guy is an animal, Charlie!
-But it is billions.

307
00:27:47,192 --> 00:27:52,585
He shot Estuviolta Pallin off!
Thank God you did not hit the egg!

308
00:27:52,832 --> 00:27:57,747
This is not good imagolleni. -
I am afraid that the shit out of me.

309
00:27:58,952 --> 00:28:01,625
Afraid he to you, Charlie?

310
00:28:02,992 --> 00:28:05,426
I thought you were not afraid of anybody.

311
00:28:15,512 --> 00:28:19,391
Fulvio, piittaan fuck that,

Juniper, what did I say?
Do you want to get me killed?

315
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,744
I do not want to see you.
Do you know why?

316
00:30:19,912 --> 00:30:23,951
If I see you, they, too, will see you
and then I'm gone.

317
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:27,867
You can not follow me anymore.
-I have to.

318
00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:31,911
No, you just need to report.
When you do, do not worry.

319
00:30:32,112 --> 00:30:36,981
You will spend the day at this park and
flirttaat with the girls.

320
00:30:37,232 --> 00:30:40,383
Lllalla you take the pounding in the bar opposite the hotel.

I'll bring you a daily report.
They did not notice anything.

322
00:30:44,952 --> 00:30:47,546
I do not tell you that you have a bad
tail.

323
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:51,501
I'm not bad.
-You. I did not want to offend.

324
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:55,381
But I do not want to see you, see
turns.

325
00:31:04,392 --> 00:31:06,747

Substance
bowels need to get hold of even if you feel the pressure.

328
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:37,267
What's that scar?
-Previous enemas.

329
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,508
How many you do a day?

00:31:39,752 --> 00:31:45,270
Depends on the season.
Same shit, different assholes.

331
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:49,630
Now, I can no longer be contained.
-I have not counted the still water.

332
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:51,982
Think about the fun stuff.

00:32:16,672 --> 00:32:18,708
Relax. I'll tell you one thing.

338
00:32:18,952 --> 00:32:23,025
One patient was afraid of this, so that
began to engage in meditation...

339
00:32:23,472 --> 00:32:26,748
Tell us how you went to the meeting.
-Well.

340
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:29,910
Is not enough. Tell your details.

341
00:32:30,072 --> 00:32:32,745
You got the job,
because we can not lose money.

342
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:34,664
Look, Daddy...
-Stop.

00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:40,028
Do not call me  isukiksi.
Do not the father, <i> padre </ i> hy, <i> pater </ i> y the.

344
00:32:40,232 --> 00:32:42,871
Do not talk as if you were upper-law in accordance.

345
00:32:43,112 --> 00:32:47,549
My only son killed himself.
-I'm sorry...

346
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:50,351
Do you know my son?

347
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:53,271
He was <i> Finocchi. </ I>

348
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,827
Do you know what it is? Faggot!

349
00:32:55,992 --> 00:33:02,227
One night he told me that
is gay. Knight of the brown hole.

350
00:33:02,392 --> 00:33:06,988
Do you know how I felt?
I threw him out of the house.

351
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:14,500
I rejected him.
I loved her more than life.

352
00:33:14,712 --> 00:33:20,548
Funeral, I cried like a child
Only one dared to come near me.

353
00:33:20,752 --> 00:33:24,108
He laid his head on my shoulder and
together, we did mourn.

354
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:31,151
I felt a deep sense of connection  Leon,
kampaajapoikaystävään my son!

355
00:33:35,912 --> 00:33:38,267
A beautiful son was dead -

356
00:33:38,512 --> 00:33:44,508
and I sit here with psycho killer,
who took my daughter to marry mad.

357
00:33:44,712 --> 00:33:50,230
I love Gloria, and I will not
Annakin you take care of it the money thing?

358
00:33:51,992 --> 00:33:55,462
I was mistaken for a soft as a rotten peach.

359
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,909
What do you know about the financial doctrine?
You are a goon.

360
00:33:59,712 --> 00:34:03,261
But you get the chance.
-I appreciate it, don Carmine.

361

363
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:14,225
Can you imagine your children?

364
00:34:15,432 --> 00:34:18,583
They pelästyttäisivät Adolf Hitler!

365
00:34:18,832 --> 00:34:22,984
Be merciful to Earth.
Forget the kids. Get a bit of money.

366
00:34:23,152 --> 00:34:27,384
And keep  maintaining peace with my girl.
-Thank you, Don Carmine.

367
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:33,108
Are you okay?

368
00:34:33,312 --> 00:34:37,146
You are the last days of the patient.
I offer you a ride.

369
00:34:37,312 --> 00:34:42,466
No, thank you. We'll get there.
-Look, I'll take you home.

370
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:44,668
Put ​​some pants on.

371
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:54,350
How are you?
-Well.

372
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:57,544
And you're talkative.
What she ordered for you?

373
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:01,632
I do not know.

374
00:35:03,592 --> 00:35:07,187
What the hell did you do?
-These destroy the gut once and for all.

375
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,668
You are insane woman.
Let me out?

376
00:35:10,832 --> 00:35:13,869
Just because I support the alternative treatments?

377
00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:18,024
I support the option for run.
-Good reflexes.

378
00:35:18,272 --> 00:35:20,866
You do not clearly known drugs.

-Yeah.

382
00:35:30,232 --> 00:35:32,507
But attractive?
-Very.

383
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:34,828

386
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,430
Fear.

387
00:35:45,592 --> 00:35:48,823
I see in your eyes,
that fear will eat you alive.

388
00:35:49,032 --> 00:35:53,469
If you can not get it under control,

Good. You are the road to recovery.

392
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:06,788
The worst part is that my life guided by
idiots that are looked down upon.

393
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:09,710
I would give anything to ohjatakseni it yourself.

394
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:12,824
Why do you feel you do not have
Lord of your life?

395
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:14,744
How many people is their boss?

Fear. They may fear that we will lose our position in

Strange to hear from the mouth of the police.
You have a real shield.

403
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:48,025
I'm undercover.
If it turns out my life is in danger.

404
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:53,710
What is the way to overcome fear?

Do not know what you want?

Fortunately, I know:

How did you know?
-I'm good at it.

413
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:39,670
What the hell is this?

414
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:43,268
Chill out. This is an adventure.
-I do not like adventure.

Thank you.

421
00:38:14,152 --> 00:38:17,940
Look, what if I take you out to eat
?

422
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:22,469
We made it yes eat.
First you have to be foreplay.

423
00:38:22,672 --> 00:38:27,826
I like foreplay.
-Here is our sex toys.

424
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:30,785
Is this foreplay?
-Definitely.

425
00:38:31,552 --> 00:38:34,988
First, mix the cow shit in the mud.

Then you take this and the phallic apparatus costed
tökit holes on wet ground -

and I tossed the seeds.

428
00:38:44,312 --> 00:38:48,351
Are you kidding me?
-I. Up the sleeves and a shovel in your hand.

429
00:39:56,072 --> 00:40:00,987
I just drew this
and turned the knob.

430
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:04,622
Something has probably failed.

431
00:40:07,632 --> 00:40:09,907
No!

432
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:09,145
Lso wop.
You can not even grow tomatoes.

433
00:41:09,352 --> 00:41:13,550
Leave me in peace, Gloria.
This is important to me.

434
00:41:13,752 --> 00:41:17,984
You do not have to play anything.

00:41:42,112 --> 00:41:47,311
but if it does something psychosis,
go to the ground, the bullets are flying.

441
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:50,066
Keep your mouth shut and pray for the best.

442
00:41:56,232 --> 00:42:00,066

Is it 10 million? -2.

447
00:42:23,512 --> 00:42:27,391
Agreement was 10 million.
-I changed it.

448
00:42:30,392 --> 00:42:34,385
I want to see what you can do.
We can also take them away.

449
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:37,351
From now it is right speech?

450
00:42:45,592 --> 00:42:51,189
Two million is a big money game.
Let's play and see what happens.

451
00:42:51,352 --> 00:42:54,105
Two million is .

Stop! It is routine.

455
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,751
FSA reviews the new company headquarters within 90 days.

456
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:16,631
They are accountants.
I'll take care of this.

457
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,545
I got this.

458
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:30,148
I'm going to talk to them.
-No. They want in..

459
00:43:30,312 --> 00:43:34,783
Ask them inside.
Ladies and gentlemen, put your guns away.

460
00:43:36,712 --> 00:43:40,751
Ask them inside.
They are nothing more than accountants.

461
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:45,029
Can you get weapons from?

462
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:47,581
Ask them inside.

463
00:43:50,512 --> 00:43:52,980
Take control of them here, Myrna.

464
00:44:00,032 --> 00:44:01,988
Good morning, gentlemen.

465
00:44:02,192 --> 00:44:04,308
FSA.

466
00:44:04,472 --> 00:44:08,624
a routine check.
-Great. Jason, that was the book.

467
00:44:14,472 --> 00:44:16,702
Bank guarantees and forms.

468
00:44:18,952 --> 00:44:20,988
You want some cola?
No, thank you.

469
00:44:21,232 --> 00:44:25,350
Papers that you do not have enough cash.

470
00:44:25,552 --> 00:44:29,830
But here it seems to be.
Can you explain?

471
00:44:30,072 --> 00:44:33,701
We just international shops.
Is a document?

472
00:44:36,152 --> 00:44:38,950
This. Sorry.

473
00:44:45,952 --> 00:44:51,185
I have a lot to tell you.
The first store was creepy.

474
00:44:51,392 --> 00:44:56,546
FSA showed up to the door.
I thought was a thing of the past, but...

475
00:44:56,752 --> 00:45:02,509
Strange that I would really like to talk about
wonderful woman, whom I met.

476
00:45:03,872 --> 00:45:07,148
I met an amazing woman.
-Who is he?

477
00:45:07,352 --> 00:45:09,070
Did you get hives?

478
00:45:09,232 --> 00:45:13,623
I met Judy's doctor.
He ​​gave me an enema.

479
00:45:15,872 --> 00:45:19,911
That, too, is access to the estate.
-I'm serious. She is gorgeous.

480
00:45:20,112 --> 00:45:25,266
He took out on a date, and
for the first time in months I had a lot of fun.

481
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,908
How does it feel?
-The great thing, Charlie.

482
00:45:29,112 --> 00:45:34,470
Does he know what you do?
No, but I will tell you yes.

483
00:46:17,712 --> 00:46:20,431
Hey, Charlie.
Now, explaining accounts.

484
00:46:20,632 --> 00:46:24,591
No speech, no promises.
I do not care, I love the mother of the boy.

485
00:46:24,832 --> 00:46:28,381
I want money right now!
-I do not have any.

486
00:46:28,632 --> 00:46:31,590
Shut up!
I know how much money is...

487
00:46:36,352 --> 00:46:39,822
Warren Ganza.
The rat showed up.

488
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:43,667
Like I said, he wanted
division.

489
00:46:43,872 --> 00:46:48,582
It would now go to Warren from over.
Who's that?

490
00:46:48,752 --> 00:46:51,061
I'll explain later. Come on.

491
00:46:54,592 --> 00:46:59,347
Charlie . He is an FBI agent.
Did you kill her?

492
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:03,661
Yes, he was in Warren.

493
00:47:03,912 --> 00:47:06,142
The car is here.

494
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:19,305
Probably wondering why
I happened to spot when you came Ganza.

495
00:47:19,512 --> 00:47:24,427
I thought that you were going to shoot me
Warren and do not want to get in time.

496
00:47:25,752 --> 00:47:27,788
You are funny guy.

497
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:34,311
I was becoming a Police
hotel to provide you with a pounding -

498
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:38,704
and say, well you handled them
inspectors.

499
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:44,071
Really. I can well understand why
Cheemo appreciated you.

500
00:47:46,672 --> 00:47:48,708
Thank you.

501
00:47:56,312 --> 00:48:02,262
Have you ever been to New York?
-A couple of times in transit.

502
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,186
Meininki has changed the former.

503
00:48:09,392 --> 00:48:12,384
Have you been in ltaly?

504
00:48:16,472 --> 00:48:19,669
It is the most beautiful place in the world.

505
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:26,107
I, I have not been there.
But I have a lot of pictures.

506
00:48:31,072 --> 00:48:34,030
I changed the time machine in Rome.

507
00:48:34,992 --> 00:48:37,062
Really?

508
00:48:37,232 --> 00:48:41,703
It must have been great.
-Airport was good.

509
00:48:41,872 --> 00:48:45,421
I went shopping for snacks.
It was all in Italian.

510
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,982
Waited for a man behind.
He ​​said, "<i> Cris cris. </ I>"

511
00:48:49,232 --> 00:48:53,862
He's got a bag of potato chips,
so I said, "<i> Cris cris. </ I>"

512
00:48:54,112 --> 00:48:57,627
I, too, got some chips.
<i> Cris cris. </ I> Potato Chips.

513
00:48:57,792 --> 00:48:59,430
It will keep in mind.

514
00:48:59,592 --> 00:49:03,471
It is written cris cris,
but pronounced air aces.

515
00:49:03,632 --> 00:49:06,385
As with all the roman languages.

516
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:11,262
I pronounced i, respectively,
final consonant is dropped off.

517
00:49:11,472 --> 00:49:16,751
Did you buy souvenirs?
-I bought, fine leather goods.

518
00:49:16,992 --> 00:49:21,986
You change the disc already. You can continue your job.
Warren Ganza is dead, the danger over.

519
00:49:22,232 --> 00:49:24,188
He killed  Juniper!

520
00:49:24,392 --> 00:49:27,543
It's tough to lose a colleague.
It belongs to the work.

521
00:49:27,752 --> 00:49:32,382
We have to catch the killers.
-What about those who kill me?

522
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:48,902
Juniper's fate touched everyone.

523
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:54,628
I want you to know,
that the entire department is here for you.

524
00:50:00,392 --> 00:50:04,590
How are you doing?
-I do very well, Dexter.

525
00:50:04,792 --> 00:50:10,105
I'm going to throw myself off the roof.
What is the view from there?

526
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:17,990
It's tough to lose comrade.
Good, the humor is still there.

527
00:50:26,712 --> 00:50:28,782
Hey, you.

528
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:31,301
What's up?
-Good.

529
00:50:31,512 --> 00:50:36,632
Look, Judy,
I need to talk to you about an important matter.

530
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:40,626
's Take a walk at the same time.
A beautiful day.

531
00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:31,385
And that's why I do not sleep, I eat
medications and bowel tricks.

532
00:51:33,072 --> 00:51:35,711
For the first time, you do not say anything.

533
00:51:35,912 --> 00:51:39,905
What do you think?
-I could tell you a parable.

534
00:51:40,152 --> 00:51:46,227
Buddhist monk passes through the mountains and all of a sudden
tiger starts to chase.

535
00:51:46,432 --> 00:51:51,347
Cliff's edge a monk sees,
the bottom there are five tigers.

536
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:58,782
Hanging on a bush in which he relies,
when you realize strawberries. He smiles.

537
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:03,389
He says:
"It's a perfect strawberry."

538
00:52:03,632 --> 00:52:06,510
He picks it up and eats it.

539
00:52:06,712 --> 00:52:09,306
So what?
-That's all.

540
00:52:09,512 --> 00:52:13,824
That's all? The monk is getting into the
tigers jaw and eat strawberries?

541
00:52:13,992 --> 00:52:16,108
What the hell does that mean?

542
00:52:16,272 --> 00:52:21,187
It means that the
must live every second of life.

543
00:52:21,392 --> 00:52:25,624
All living when are alive.
-Not if you fear gnawing.

544
00:52:25,832 --> 00:52:29,871
You are close to the tiger's jaw,
twice the gods have saved -

545
00:52:30,072 --> 00:52:33,382
but you are the luckiest man in the world
?

546
00:52:33,632 --> 00:52:36,942
You will not, enter the calming and
paskot your pants.

547
00:52:59,952 --> 00:53:01,544
Ahoy!

548
00:53:01,752 --> 00:53:06,667
Are you gentlemen ready to celebrate the
stock prices a little cruise?

549
00:53:06,872 --> 00:53:11,900
It is a little chilly.
-Jason gets really warm you feel.

550
00:53:12,112 --> 00:53:15,627
Come aboard, gentlemen.
Come on now.

551
00:53:46,992 --> 00:53:48,903
Champagne, ladies and gentlemen?

552
00:53:52,752 --> 00:53:55,471
Okay. Proudly declare
-

553
00:53:55,712 --> 00:54:01,867
the Transcontinental acquired lnvestments
800 000 soijapapuosaketta.

554
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:05,860
I would like to propose a toast to us,
soijapapupohatoille.

555
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:07,670
Beans?

556
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:12,262
You bought the beans  two million?
After all, you're joking.

557
00:54:12,472 --> 00:54:16,181
I do not. We currently have a
2% soijapapumarkkinoista.

558
00:54:16,352 --> 00:54:17,831
Are you crazy?

559
00:54:18,032 --> 00:54:21,741
I tell my father that I bought the whole
amount of beans?

560
00:54:21,952 --> 00:54:25,627
I would immediately run out of the hair and become a monk!

561
00:54:25,792 --> 00:54:29,148
They are soy beans.
They are made of tofu.

562
00:54:29,312 --> 00:54:33,430
Let soybean, green, brown,
kindergarten or even Heinz beans!

563
00:54:33,632 --> 00:54:36,942
Do not even hint at all,
that my father is pavunpoimija!

564
00:54:38,352 --> 00:54:40,741
I want the money back tomorrow!

565
00:54:40,952 --> 00:54:45,184
Then we suffer a loss.
We will lose at least half.

566
00:54:45,392 --> 00:54:49,431
Fidel, he is right.
-Charlie, not on my side.

567
00:54:49,632 --> 00:54:53,784
Put ​​that jerk thing to handle.
-We do not wash your money for free.

568
00:54:53,992 --> 00:54:58,110
Do you want macaroni war
300 000 Dollars?

569
00:54:58,272 --> 00:55:02,982
Kolumbialaispaskat  What about you?
You will begin to immediately brandish Uzeja.

570
00:55:03,232 --> 00:55:06,429
Let's get this right now.
-Come on.

571
00:55:11,152 --> 00:55:13,461
Stop that machismo!

572
00:55:13,712 --> 00:55:18,263
I do not care who has the biggest!
I came here to make money!

573
00:55:18,512 --> 00:55:21,902
Fidel, do not make fun of your family.
It was a misunderstanding.

574
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,108
Do not you think?
-I swear it.

575
00:55:24,312 --> 00:55:28,863
I did not realize that the Colombian
beans are a sensitive issue.

576
00:55:29,072 --> 00:55:34,100
Enough of this, Jason.
Fidel, it was a misunderstanding.

577
00:55:34,312 --> 00:55:36,428
Look what that shit does!

578
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:39,988
Pallin You shot him!
-Stop.

579
00:55:40,192 --> 00:55:45,107
Yes, we came up with something.
-I did not take my dad beans!

580
00:55:45,312 --> 00:55:49,305
We'll figure something out.
Are we doing more and more business?

581
00:55:50,272 --> 00:55:52,911
First thing you should we get rid of the beans.

582
00:55:53,112 --> 00:55:56,946
Father, it is a sensitive issue.
We do not eat beans.

583
00:55:57,112 --> 00:56:00,468
Do you even  bean salad?
-Jason, shut up.

584
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:05,785
No one is infringing your family.
Heivataan beans.

585
00:56:11,912 --> 00:56:17,782
He has to leave my husband alone.
They lost balls, broken ends.

586
00:56:18,992 --> 00:56:23,190
Fulvio, you need to curb your anger.

587
00:56:24,192 --> 00:56:27,025
We have to earn money.

588
00:56:40,872 --> 00:56:44,706
We have a big problem.
No, no different from us.

589
00:56:44,872 --> 00:56:47,989
Yuppie bought the beans and Fidel injured it.

590
00:56:48,232 --> 00:56:49,870
Why?

591
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:52,870
As Mexicans eating beans.

592
00:56:53,032 --> 00:56:56,104
Same as the negro should be
watermelon shares.

593
00:56:56,312 --> 00:57:00,191
I was able to buy a
oliiviöljyosakkeita.

594
00:57:00,392 --> 00:57:03,031
You the choice you did it yourself.

595
00:57:03,272 --> 00:57:05,911
Peruuko Vaillar due to some error?

596
00:57:06,072 --> 00:57:09,348
We'll take care of this.
-Let's end this thing.

597
00:57:10,312 --> 00:57:13,145
We have 2 million.
-They are rich.

598
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:17,943
2 million is peanuts.
-By Colombian and keep the money.

599
00:57:18,192 --> 00:57:20,228
Let's arrest now.

600
00:57:20,472 --> 00:57:23,270
Charlie must finish the job together,
export our money.

601
00:57:23,512 --> 00:57:27,107
Fulvio is a maniac.
I can not keep job together.

602
00:57:27,272 --> 00:57:30,947
What do you think?
-Go on.

603
00:57:31,152 --> 00:57:34,269
What do you think, Joey?
-Go on.

604
00:57:34,472 --> 00:57:37,270
There is only one little problem.

605
00:57:37,512 --> 00:57:41,061
You cover your losses if
Jason lost market?

606
00:57:41,272 --> 00:57:43,103
Not really.
-No way.

607
00:57:43,352 --> 00:57:45,388
Course.
-It's what I thought.

608
00:57:55,352 --> 00:57:57,388
I come, I come!

609
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:02,589
Luxury News. Can I come in?
-Sure.

610
00:58:04,712 --> 00:58:07,909
A nice roommate, Charlie.
You will travel in style.

611
00:58:09,912 --> 00:58:15,032
Thank you. What news did you have?
-Jason heivasi beans.

612
00:58:15,632 --> 00:58:19,227
How much was a loss?
-Just 20 per cent.

613
00:58:19,912 --> 00:58:24,064
The flamboyant gambling
know how to move your money.

614
00:58:24,272 --> 00:58:28,424
Losses he moved to the other customers. -Unbelievable.

615
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:34,542
When the options become due,
those guys jumping from the windows.

616
00:58:38,072 --> 00:58:40,791
Now this is like a palace, Charlie.

617
00:58:43,632 --> 00:58:46,704
I'm just saying that it is a little Fidel...

618
00:58:46,952 --> 00:58:51,582
He is the best thank us.
I had to suffer because of it papufriikin.

619
00:58:51,832 --> 00:58:57,862
I hope he knows it.
Fidelia is not easy to please.

620
00:58:58,112 --> 00:59:02,105
Say more. When the wind turns,
he will get a scene.

621
00:59:02,352 --> 00:59:07,585
He can not control himself.
-That's right. Jealous man off.

622
00:59:07,832 --> 00:59:13,828
We have to be really quiet,
in order to Fidel's self-control does not disappoint.

623
00:59:14,072 --> 00:59:17,462
I think we have succeeded in
very well.

624
00:59:17,672 --> 00:59:19,424
Mostly  -

625
00:59:19,632 --> 00:59:23,511
But he still remembers,
that ravaged his bodyguard.

626
00:59:25,352 --> 00:59:27,991
A little bit.

627
00:59:28,192 --> 00:59:32,629
Did I
I could not let her make fun of the prostate.

628
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:39,914
Like the temple. -When you get back to life,
is a well-deserved retirement.

629
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,830
Is this what you want?

630
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,750
Let's go upstairs.

631
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,512
What do you do?

632
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,518
There is
who wants to kill me.

633
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,635
His or her partner is here.

634
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,636
How do you ..?
-A little concerned.

635
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,479
What is it?
-They need more than that.

636
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,196
You think I'm paranoid?
The Colombians are there.

637
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,197
Charlie, this is crazy.

638
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,198
Yes, it would, if I were to
the common man -

639
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,916
but it is quite different.
If something goes wrong, I'm dead.

640
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,271
All the time something goes wrong,
but always gonna be.

641
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,995
But it is not always constant, and
kill me.

642
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,829
Your fear is like a magnet:
positions all with you.

643
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,077
Right. They then later point.

644
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,709
Guard while one bullet.
-As always.

645
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,555
Guess what.

646
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,789
You...

647
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,512
Let's go eat.
I'm starved.

648
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:35,117
Is that Charlie?
-Amazing!

649
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:39,393
Were you show?
And we chose the same restaurant.

650
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,353
Destiny interwoven.
Jason. -Judy.

651
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,596
Lady Judy. Sit down. -No.

652
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,157
I insist.
Everyone, this is Judy.

653
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:54,309
There is no room.
-You're kidding me. Ken, two more!

654
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,555
What's the matter?
-Guy group therapy is here.

655
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,070
Remember: the gods love to you.

656
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,193
Here is a walnut-kurpitsaraviolia,
which is bound to taste.

657
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,030
There are two further doses of ravioli.
-And a bowl of strawberries to my friend.

658
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,672
What was the Best in Show?
-Moorish villa.

659
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,552
A very romantic.

660
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:35,278
Full Marrakesh above, hashish-smoking
and seven veil dance.

661
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,152
Something like that.

662
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,591
I like the modern.
Other like classical music.

663
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:45,828
There is no reason to believe that any new
is the shit.

664
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,999
Everything new is shit. -He hates everything
less than 2000 years old.

665
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,875
Sicilian house of your own.
-Masterpiece.

666
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,595
Is the ruins of Agrigento photography.

667
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:02,271
They are lempiraunioni .
Charlie. The girl is a treasure.

668
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,029
I have a weakness to Rococo.
-The whole show is great.

669
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,676
The best of all.
Housing market to Disney World.

670
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,870
Let him go! Please help!

671
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,310
Get off me!

672
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,994
Please help!
Do you completely barmy?

673
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,192
I have to Elliot's friend.
He ​​explains it all.

674
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,550
I will pay the bill.

675
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,275
You'd better leave now.

676
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,719
Sorry for the interruption. He is my friend.
Liver to his bill and other expenses.

677
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,072
What was that?

678
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:50,474
He called down daamilleni
obscenities in front of his wife. I had no choice.

679
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:55,117
Let's go have a drink.
The girls are doing fine.

680
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,152
Tobacco?

681
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:15,079
Fidel . Jason and Fulvio
have a new plan.

682
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,756
The above was a bit too much.
-They nest in 2 million as liked.

683
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,751
And we nielimme victory.

684
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,032
What had in mind?
-Buy market.

685
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,317
If we have a majority, we can control the prices of
.

686
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,115
What would it cost?
-About 40 million.

687
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,632
Should I invest 40 million?

688
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,553
What kind of business issues do they have?

689
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,234
They wash money.
-What do you mean?

690
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,477
Kolumbialaishomot represent drug cartel.

691
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,156
Invest in the billions,
boyfriend arranged.

692
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,669
True thrill.

693
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,440
Fulvio really screw up the whole thing.
-Why?

694
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:01,919
He is in control of it. There is no intelligence to
and self-control that.

695
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,271
He pretends .
-Should trust him.

696
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,199
Fulvio would trust?
He ​​is a loser.

697
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,269
Want a gardener as the grandfather Heendâ
and can not even grow tomatoes.

698
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,790
Who is the Italian he could such a thing?

699
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,310
That says it all.
Where is the toilet?

700
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,556
I think they have a crisis.
-It would appear so.

701
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,990
Invest 20,
if panette the rest.

702
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,954
Fidel, they take care of their money in a deal
not need to be washed.

703
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,151
All money needs to be washed.

704
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:40,959
And if this is a lucrative trade,
I made a reasonable offer to pay half.

705
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:46,513
Do I look like Santa Claus?
Where can I get the rest of the 20 million?

706
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,669
Let's talk about the issue.
-Ahead. Let's talk.

707
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,275
Am I more and more popular among the gods?
-You're still alive.

708
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,597
So, since knocked Elliott.

709
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,872
This.

710
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,554
What is this?
-Do not ask.

711
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,315
It will probably good for me.

712
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,670
Kuolonenkeleistä What do you think?
-Normal guys.

713
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:22,396
Fulvio Are you normal?
He ​​shot Estuviolta Pallin out of it.

714
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:27,315
Fulvio seemed unhappy.
-I will. Did you talk to my wife?

715
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:33,436
He, too, seemed unhappy.
-Did he say Fulvio sensitive topic?

716
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,755
Tomatoes. -What's in
fruits and vegetables have?

717
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:55,199
What do you need me for?
-You explain the deal.

718
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,596
I do not explain it to your donillesi.
Yes, explain.

719
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:05,595
Why did he invest 20 million
relying on an unknown word?

720
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,836
People like you.

721
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,510
Fulvio says
that you're a smart guy.

722
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:17,113
I do not know whether
clever to ask me to invest 20 million.

723
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,033
You tell me.
-It's not smart, sir.

724
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,352
He's only joking.
-Low, Fulvio. Go on, Charlie.

725
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,439
When you invest a sum of
always take a big risk.

726
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,316
If one-third ownership provides the ability to control prices
-

727
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,317
why not do it?

728
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,995
On Wall Street on a daily basis.
-Shut up!

729
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,636
Tell risks, Charlie.
-The first acquisition of 40 million -

730
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,877
and to ensure that the
little things let you down -

731
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,958
livistä and no one with the money.

732
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,431
Manipulating the market for the audit secret -

733
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:56,673
which is impossible,
when you buy a third.

734
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,271
Inspectors noses sniffing,
also feature perästämme shit smell.

735
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:06,912
I like you, Charlie.
You do not try to fool me.

736
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:11,238
I think about it.
I'll call you then.

737
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,914
Keep your phone switched on.

738
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:18,753
That's how you help me?
You ruined the whole deal!

739
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,110
Wait until he plays.

740
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,675
Told me everything,
what's going wrong!

741
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:29,073
I wanted to win the trust.
-You would have to curry!

742
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,714
Nearly simply referred to go away!

743
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,390
Käänteispsykologiaa,
I do not seem eager.

744
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,358
I would be eager to withdraw from it!

745
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,592
I can no longer be a cliché!
I want money-

746
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,429
so that I can stop this mafia flick of life!

747
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,352
Do not you like to be a villain?
-I hate it!

748
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,513
Jesus, Fulvio.
I never would have...

749
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,638
You are so good
to beat up people.

750
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:02,799
You do not know me.
No one knows me.

751
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,395
I'm sorry.
I know how you feel.

752
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,875
How could you know?

753
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,470
You'll all be successful.

754
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:24,075
Dexter, I do not know.
I would like to own my money on the line.

755
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,999
20 million would be quite a high price.

756
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:32,558
We just need to show the money.
They look like theirs, I'll shoot them.

757
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,031
Leave it to a few millimeters in there and exported to the rest of the
.

758
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:39,795
One-day work
$ 18 million.

759
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,278
Sure that my son-in-law
shot in the side.

760
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:52,230
Why are agreeing to another diiliin?
Do you give them 20 million?

761
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,991
I give them 20 million,
, but I'll show them the money.

762
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:02,354
Then I'll kill Fulvio
Nesstraat and the money from him.

763
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,512
What about Charlie?

764
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,790
Our approach him too.

765
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,309
Remember who brought him on board.

766
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,479
Do not see it.
-They pay for your sufferings.

767
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,915
My life is shit, Charlie.

768
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,915
Maybe that's why I always
ready to beat up someone.

769
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:30,272
All the time I look only
that I get an excuse to kill.

770
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,239
Why?
-I do not know.

771
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,198
Maybe I have low self-esteem.

772
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:41,036
Even my grandmother
treated me like a dog shit.

773
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:45,358
Consider: Italian grandma treats
<i> cute bambino </ i> like a plague.

774
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,552
Fulvio, all of which are
unsure of themselves.

775
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,632
Not you.
You do not even blink an eye.

776
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,435
I threatened
gun at you and you took a nap.

777
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,110
You're trying to just get a feel
improving.

778
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,548
If only one change.
Life could be wonderful.

779
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:11,553
I, too, could be.
I want to be wonderful.

780
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,234
So, don Carmine?

781
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,716
He is involved.

782
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:35,038
Where did you guessed it?
-I trust your intuition.

783
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:40,836
They bring 40 million in cash.
Is not it time to arrest?

784
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:45,318
Vaillareilla is in the billions.
40 million of them pocket money.

785
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,954
We can also grab Fidel Vaillarin.

786
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:54,230
Pedro Vaillarilla of 1 2 sons.
He ​​is not taking care hinttaripojastaan.

787
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,192
Is Fidel gay?

788
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:03,118
I did not know.
-Charlie, you're doing a great job.

789
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:06,551
All amazing deals have been documented.

790
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,713
Vaillarin We close the taps and activities.

791
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:14,674
That's never been done
none of the cartel.

792
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,916
He just knocked you up?

793
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:29,556
Sheer carnage.
I never thought that I would experience such a thing.

794
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,880
Elliott, I'm really sorry.
I thought that result in death.

795
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,992
What I did I do?

796
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:42,716
Charlie. Elliott does not talk about it,
what happened in the restaurant.

797
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,956
What is this?

798
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:49,039
I no longer restrained myself at work.
-What happened?

799
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:54,189
I was at the meeting, and intimated,
that the marketing of the boss is the stiff.

800
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,958
And?

801
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:59,152
Questioned his expertise.

802
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:04,275
Then I jumped on the table and yelled,
that he was a crazy nigger fuck -

803
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:08,871
valid for work only
little bureaucrat. I got fired.

804
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,991
I do not care,
that I lost my job and wife.

805
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,834
Did your wife  you?
-Yesterday evening.

806
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:21,431
The worst part is when you have one of the assistant,
which makes the minutes of the meeting...

807
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,791
She is wonderful.
Has a face like an angel.

808
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,276
Good-natured man.

809
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:33,713
But when he heard that word,
he is African American, -

810
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,472
saw the pain on his face.
I did not want to offend him.

811
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:44,117
I lost everything because
I could not control myself.

812
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,592
Jesus,
this worthless piece of shit I have not.

813
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,030
Elliott, you is not shit.

814
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,358
Allow Elliott, a moment to calm down.
Charlie, you is a big deal.

815
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,358
It's tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

816
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,916
What are you going to do?
-I'm trying to survive.

817
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,838
's It?

818
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:11,909
Let me ask: if you know that
turning out to be a fateful meeting -

819
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:15,237
what do you do?
-I am quiet and I'm trying to survive.

820
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:20,713
One way it should be.
-Defeat can not be avoided.

821
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:26,631
I'm sorry, but I have a
expenditure, which I can not cancel.

822
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,876
It's okay.

823
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,909
Since this is my last night alive
, you going to have a drink?

824
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,839
Blank yes would be nice.

825
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,150
Good evening, doctor.

826
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:46,310
Is Jerry Feinstein meeting?
-Who is Jerry Feinstein?

827
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,795
He was the model.

828
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,788
Wall Street bailuhirmu.
All know him.

829
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:00,879
Lonny, Jason Cane,
the Wall Street type...

830
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,397
Guess what.
The right name is Jerry Feinstein.

831
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,549
I consider whether there is anything about him.

832
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,949
DRUG POSSESSION
arrested Dexter Helvenshaw

833
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,276
<i> Plaza Hotel. Good evening. </ I>
-Charles Mayo, thank you.

834
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:57,270
<i> This is a message box </ i>
<i> number 1601. </ I>

835
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,040
me.
Now is the devil to pay.

836
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:03,397
Meet
63 and 5 on the street corner.

837
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,115
I would like to propose a toast, ladies and gentlemen
-

838
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,158
those men,
that we had before.

839
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,595
I'm pretty much the same.

840
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:16,833
15 years ago, I went to work
dressed like Don Johnson.

841
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,112
I survived it all,
I was king, I was not afraid.

842
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,828
You kokkelipäissäsi.

843
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,554
Maybe a little bit. I was 25 years old.

844
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,793
I was like James Bond in Monte Carlo
playing baccarat with its...

845
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,515
Ernst Blofeld with.
-The one with the cat.

846
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:39,033
I've only played in Vegas
Hong Kong triad types.

847
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,869
It was incredible.
Huumeporhot knew how to celebrate.

848
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:46,072
Do not do?
-Not the ones that I know.

849
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,393
They are just as bad as we do.
-Are the bad guys unhappy?

850
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,636
Depressing.

851
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,512
Lonnya did you see?

852
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,435
He ​​räpläsi computer and just rushed out.

853
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,553
You are constantly in danger.
The pay is lousy.

854
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,190
You have no privacy.
Why do you do it?

855
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,790
Something to inspire you.
-You said your job miserable.

856
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,471
It has not always been terrible.
Sometimes it was just insane.

857
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:34,958
As drugs.
-Almost as if it would have been stoned.

858
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:41,958
The joint work was at the time of companionship.
But the best part was the risk ropes.

859
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,833
If mokaisi, would die for sure.

860
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,840
<i> Me. </ I>
<i> Now is the devil to pay. </ I>

861
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,476
<i> See you </ i>
<i> 63.ja 5 on the street corner. </ i>

862
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:05,232
I love this.
When I grow up I want to be like Charles.

863
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,749
Describe a little bit crazy.

864
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:11,999
This is a risk.
There you are your own boss.

865
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,276
You are alone with a thug.

866
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:18,359
Every time you meet, you do not know,
what he knows, and you do not.

867
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,519
Lonny, Charlie asked me to get.
He ​​could not make it.

868
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:32,878
How do you know what to do?
-Hop.

869
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:37,756
This is followed by instinct.
It's a strange, magical sixth sense.

870
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,879
If it is wrong, is a thing of the past.

871
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,799
What happened, when the
Cheemo killed by your colleagues?

872
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,358
I still have not figured out how to
Cheemo got to know about me.

873
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:55,992
I could not live like that. -
It can not be understood unless experienced it.

874
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,919
You do not have to live like that.
Tell me more.

875
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:05,639
When you're a thug with a double,
talking about just ordinary stuff.

876
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:09,509
"Did you look at the yesterday's game?"
"Did you see what tits?"

877
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,553
What is Charlie doing?
-He's gonna be fine.

878
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:17,595
But it is not harmless.
Konnillakin is a good instinct.

879
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:22,191
It's not even about lying.
Pressure is enormous. You can say:

880
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:26,399
"The sky is blue," and as you know they are lying
, blow your cover.

881
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,479
I do not understand him.
-You're not the only one.

882
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:36,789
The hardest part is when you have to ask.
Question about a quick death.

883
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,313
Did  Charlie, from the phone?
-No.

884
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:43,557
Talking to?
-He wanted to meet with us immediately.

885
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,276
If they are friendly, speak up.
Be familiar, but do not be too.

886
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:54,157
Do not talk about your gold cellulite
nor the neighbor's house fronts.

887
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:58,592
I've been here for four weeks without seeing a single match in
.

888
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,439
Do you have connections to lipunmyyjiin?

889
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:10,838
It's like a constant job interview.

890
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:15,079
It is well-behaved,
pretending. All goes smoothly.

891
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,512
Then considers the wrong direction
and cease to exist.

892
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,392
Howard, Charlie here.
I call service.

893
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,750
Charlie, what is man?

894
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:29,396
Lose its first, and then I think of courage?

895
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:33,235
I do not know. But it is difficult to
get them back.

896
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:37,877
Trick stash is empty.
-You have to believe in change.

897
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,796
I'll see you soon.

898
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,316
As soon as you see the money,
take the gun out, but do not shoot.

899
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,798
I split from him prick, and then I'll blow your head off.

900
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,831
It is difficult to restrain myself.

901
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,868
I know.
His pain is my gift to you.

902
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:14,594
FBI agent Clemmensen.
-The Helvenshaw drug agency.

903
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,917
The mission is ruined
villain like the police.

904
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,510
I'm in danger, and I ask for help.
-Yes, sir.

905
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,958
Incredibly good timing
to make a deal just today.

906
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:05,234
Player to Tokyo in the morning and I heard something top secret.

907
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,078
What is it?

908
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:11,432
The Japanese have a new program,
that outperforms Microsoft.

909
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:15,428
They have been working on it for years.
-And now it's ready.

910
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,637
Katsumi announce soon.
-The Father loves it.

911
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,549
And also the fact that I placed the
40 million.

912
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:26,998
You do not even beer money.
-Life is a game. Here is the money.

913
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:31,955
I checked prices on the way.
A week later, the money has doubled.

914
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:35,908
Fantastic!
I can not wait to tell the father.

915
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:41,240
Good. Here is my money.
Show yours.

916
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,750
<i> Forget about the plan. Let's make a deal. </ I>
-What do you do?

917
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,438
What the hell?

918
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,551
Shit!

919
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,316
Easy Buddy.

920
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:37,877
Agent Mayo, are you okay?
Charlie, Do you need help?

921
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,550
Are you a cop?

922
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,431
I liked you as a friend.

923
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:52,916
I'm your friend.
We met in poor conditions.

924
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:57,352
Agent Mayo, do you need help?
-I do not expose me before.

925
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,359
What is this?

926
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:09,833
He is the agent of Dexter Helvenshaw.
He ​​has arranged all this.

927
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,355
True.
-What the hell is he doing?

928
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,835
He wants you to shoot me -

929
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:19,716
then he shoots you, take your money and end up in
hero. Or what, Dex?

930
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,837
Exactly.

931
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,118
Asshole...

932
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,988
Are you alive, my precious?

933
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:56,836
Ribs would crack.
-I'll take you to safety.

934
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,837
Hands up, Charlie.

935
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:07,032
Put ​​your hands up!
Jason, take a bag and go over there.

936
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,796
I'll see you, you bastard.

937
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:17,637
He cheated  you, Fulvio,
, and now you're gonna die.

938
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,071
Do not be sweet revenge
before the end of the year?

939
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:30,272
Jesus, Fulvio,
I think I'd shoot me.

940
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:37,793
FBI! Guns and off the ground!
-I called and asked for help.

941
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,560
I'm an agent Mayo!
-He killed his boss.

942
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,995
Hands on the head. Who is she?

943
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:47,273
Fulvio Nesstraat Minettin family.
The Colombians are there.

944
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,314
Who is she?
Data sources. 'll Question him.

945
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,389
I raise my gun.

946
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:13,275
Do you need help?
No, I was just a scratch. Let's go.

947
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,392
A little bit more, my dear.

948
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,075
I can not, Fidel.
Save yourself.

949
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,874
I do not ever!
Estuvio, honey. Look at me.

950
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:39,514
When we get out of here,
I promise that I will leave my family.

951
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,509
We need to design clothes.
-So.

952
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:54,069
Fidel, do we have to?
-It's the only way out.

953
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:59,871
What do we do now?

954
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:05,433
Use the money in shares and sold when the price is doubled.

955
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:09,076

-Viiyytän him a couple of days.

-I'll take the badge.

959
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,230
What do you say, dear?

960
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:01,797
Somebody up there likes me.

Shit!

962
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:35,838
They must have gone through the back.
-Really? You could open a suitcase.

963
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,875
Did you see him?

964
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,992
Give me something Fulvio leg.

965
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,952
How did you do it?

966
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:56,988
Do you think that only you
gain access to the drugs?

967
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:06,358
Do not they have the FBI agents?
-Friends in a group.

968
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,869
Do not arrest us all?
-No.

969
