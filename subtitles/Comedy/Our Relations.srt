1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,040
25.000

2
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,920
- l'm sorry.
- No, Betty, this is yours.

3
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,040
What's going on here? Silly.

4
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,080
Pass the sugar, lover.

5
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,720
- Hand me the bread, Momma.
- Yes, Poppa.

6
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,440
- There we are.
- Thank you.

7
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,640
That's strawberry jam in there.

8
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,800
How about some celery?
Would you like some celery?

9
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,840
Thank you.

10
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,560
Are you starting this all over again?

11
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,760
(Both) That's the best cup of tea
you ever made.

12
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,880
- Shakespeare.
- Longfellow.

13
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,040
- Needles.
- Pins. (Laughs)

14
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,480
- lsn't that cute?
- (Clock chiming)

15
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,160
Oh, Daphne, look at the time.
Hurry or we'll be late for our bridge party.

16
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Honey, excuse us
but Mrs Adelquist will be calling for us.

17
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,920
- Have a good time.
- See you before you go.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,080
Oh, lover.

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,800
(Doorbell)

20
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,120
That's Mrs Adelquist. Let her in, darling,
we'll be right down. Come on, Betty.

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,320
- Come in, Mrs Adeltwist.
- Special delivery for Mr Hardy.

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,360
Sign, please.

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,640
- (Door closes)
- Come in, Mrs Adelquist.

24
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,600
lt wasn't Mrs Twiddlepast.

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,280
Not Twiddlepast, Adelquick, er, Adelquist.

26
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,480
Never mind who it was, who was it?

27
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,680
- lt was a letter for you.
- Oh!

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,760
lt's from my mother.

29
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,480
- What's she say?
- l'll find out when l get my glasses.

30
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,480
(Loud crunching)

31
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
''My dear son Ollie,

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,520
''l was cleaning up the attic and in going
through a lot of rubbish l came acr...''

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,360
Don't be rude.

34
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,520
Now look what you've done.

35
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,560
Take some hot water and clean those off!

36
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,120
(Crack)

37
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,800
My eyes are getting worse every day.
This letter is just a blur. Hurry up.

38
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,560
Thank you.

39
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,600
Now, that's better.

40
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,760
''My dear son Ollie,

41
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,160
''l was cleaning up the attic
and in going through a lot of rubbish

42
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,520
''l came across this picture of you and Stan
and your twin brothers, Bert and Alf

43
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,920
''so l thought you would like to have it.
Lovingly, Mother.''

44
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,920
- lsn't that swell?
- Can you imagine that?

45
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,680
Our very own twin brothers.

46
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,720
l wonder where they are.

47
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,640
Cha cha cha.

48
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,200
(Laughs) Seems like only yesterday.

49
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,360
(Stan) Which is you?
(Ollie) That's me there.

50
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,480
- Look at me.
- But that isn't you, that's Alf.

51
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Let me have your glasses.

52
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,640
(Nasally) You mean to tell me
l don't know which is me?

53
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,000
That's me, right there.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,040
How do you know that's you?

55
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,080
- l'm the oldest, you can...
- Sit down.

56
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,520
There's some more writing.
Give me my glasses.

57
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,280
No wonder l couldn't tell which was you!

58
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,480
Here, you read it!

59
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,520
''Dear Ollie, l forgot to tell you
that after you and Stan left home

60
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,840
''your twin brothers Alf and Bert turned out
to be bad lads and ran away to sea,

61
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,200
''and l did hear they joined a mutiny on board
one night and they both got hanged.''

62
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,240
Oh, isn't that terrible?

63
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,040
''Let this be a lesson to you. Mother.''

64
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,440
- Hm.
- lsn't that calamitous?

65
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,280
What a disgrace to our parents.
lf poor Father ever...

66
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,920
- Where are you going?
- To show Bubbles.

67
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,200
- (Chokes) Come here.
- What?

68
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,040
- Are you crazy?
- Uh-uh.

69
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,040
lf our wives find out we had some low-down
brothers like that they'd divorce us.

70
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,360
We'd lose our prestige in town and be
ostracised by the rest of the community.

71
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,520
- Well, why would they...?!
- Oh! Shh.

72
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,640
Why would they do that?
Everybody has a black sheep in their closet.

73
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,640
Nevertheless,

74
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,800
don't you tell a soul about this
because if you do we'll be sunk.

75
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,920
Then maybe we'd better burn the evidence.

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,240
(Both) Then nobody will ever know.

77
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,720
-Shakespeare.
- Long... Not now!

78
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,880
- Have you got a match?
- Yes.

79
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,360
Shh.

80
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,880
We'll burn our past behind us.

81
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,600
- (Daphne) Come along, Betty!
- Oh! Here.

82
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,640
(Daphne) We'll be right down,
Mrs Adelquist!

83
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,200
- Oh! Hello, dear!
- Where's Mrs Adelquist?

84
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,600
- (Doorbell)
- We have to go now.

85
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,200
l'm sorry, dear. Goodbye.

86
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,720
Goodbye, lover.

87
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,800
(Daphne) Come along, girls,
we're going to be late!

88
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,240
- Goodbye!
- (Door closes)

89
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,440
(Ship's horn)

90
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,200
Stand by your line!

91
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,360
Hey, mate - get busy
and unload the livestock.

92
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,680
- We sail in the morning with the tide.
- Aye, sir!

93
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,560
- Did you get paid, Bert?
- l sure did.

94
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,720
Once we've eaten
we'll go and have a swell time.

95
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
- (Man) And come back broke as usual.
- Oh, l don't know.

96
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,480
- Aren't you going ashore, Finn?
- Once l've read the paper.

97
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,400
Any news?

98
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,720
l was reading about a man
who started with nothing

99
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,680
- and in two years had a million dollars.
- A million dollars.

100
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,800
- How?
- Careful saving and wise investment.

101
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,600
What l've been preaching
to you two for years!

102
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,240
lf you'd listened
you'd be worth a million dollars.

103
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,920
He's right. When we first
came on this ship 15 years ago

104
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,480
if we'd had as much sense then as now
we'd have let him save our money

105
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,320
and now we'd be sitting on
the fat of the land. Right, Finn?

106
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,760
- Right.
- lt's all right but it's too late now.

107
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,440
lt's never too late. You were paid today
and now is the time to start.

108
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,880
Why not let me hold it for you?

109
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,120
You make the money, l'll invest it

110
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
and you'll be millionaires
before you can say ''Jack Robinson''.

111
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,960
What do you say?

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,680
That sounds swell to me.
What about you, Alf?

113
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,400
lt's OK with me, Bert. How about you, Finn?

114
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,320
- lt's a knockout!
- l think it's good too.

115
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,360
Here's my money.

116
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,840
Have you seen my money?
l put it in here a minute ago.

117
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,840
Remember, you were...

118
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,880
lsn't that swell?
We're going to be millionaires.

119
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,360
Say, who's this fella Jack Robinson?

120
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,840
- l don't know.
- l never heard of him.

121
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,280
40...50...7 4 bucks.

122
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,280
Boys, l'm proud of you.
That's what l call determination!

123
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,880
- We're full of it.
- You'll need some pin money to spend.

124
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,320
After all, it's all right to be careful
but we've got to have our little fling,

125
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,440
just to break the monotony. (Laughs)

126
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,280
(Sighs)

127
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,640
- There's a dollar between you.
- A dollar?!

128
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,120
We can't do much flinging on a dollar!

129
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, you'll soon be millionaires.

130
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
He's right, Bert.

131
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,240
- (lnaudible)
- Oh, yes...

132
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,480
what about a receipt for our money?

133
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,720
You're right, l'm glad to see
you've got good business sense.

134
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,760
A receipt. (Coughs)

135
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,640
''lOU $7 4.''

136
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,240
Just to make this binding...
you two boys sign there.

137
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,600
- ''Bertie...Hardy.''
- ''Alfie Laurel.''

138
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,560
Semi-comma.

139
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,200
Thanks.

140
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,320
Now everything is on the up and up.

141
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,400
- lsn't that swell?
- One thing l want you to promise.

142
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,400
- What?
- Don't come and ask any of it back.

143
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,760
You listen to this - when we make
an agreement, it is an agreement.

144
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,360
Yeah, we want you to promise us
you won't give it back.

145
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,560
- l promise.
- Get me some coffee.

146
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,000
- All right.
- Now we'll get somewhere!

147
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,080
l'll get ready to go ashore.

148
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,320
- Any orders, sir?
- Huh? Er, yeah, yeah.

149
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,880
- Send those mugs Bert and Alf up here.
- Aye, sir.

150
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,880
Hey, you swabs, the mate said
the Captain wants to see you right away!

151
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,880
OK, we'll be right up.

152
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,560
Come on, sailor.

153
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,680
- Goodbye, Finn.
- Goodbye.

154
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,760
Oh, wait a minute! l've taken a room
at Mrs MacGregor's on Tudor Avenue.

155
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,120
lf you run short of money, drop in.

156
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,160
- OK, thanks.
- Goodbye.

157
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,200
Bye.

158
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,920
Barnum was right.

159
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,280
Now, listen, this is what
l want to see you about.

160
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,600
l'm expecting a small package
to be delivered to me here but l can't wait.

161
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,520
l want you to stay here, get this package
and bring it to Denker's Beer Garden.

162
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,680
- l'll meet you there about four bells.
- Aye, sir.

163
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,680
- You know where Denker's is?
- Aye, sir. lt's on Fifth and Eighth.

164
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,040
Between Sixth and Seventh on Ninth.
lt's just across from...

165
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,680
- You know where it is.
- Aye, sir.

166
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,000
l hope l can rely on you to do this for me.

167
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,600
Captain, you can trust us insipidly.

168
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,000
l hope so because
it's a very important package.

169
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,080
What's in the package, Cappy?

170
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,000
None of your business what's in it!
Go on, get out of here!

171
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,400
And don't call me Cappy!

172
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,000
- Can you tell us where...?
- Shh!

173
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,960
Pardon us, officer,
but where is Denker's Beer Garden?

174
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,200
Just around the corner there.

175
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,040
Thank you.

176
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,080
- Pardon me, officer.
- Me too.

177
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,120
That's all right.

178
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,960
(Till bell rings)

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,440
Lil, looks like the fleet's in.

180
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,240
l'm having beer. What's yours?

181
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,160
We gotta take it easy,
we've only got a dollar.

182
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,480
l know. What are you gonna have?

183
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,640
Suppose we share the same beer?
We won't spend so much money.

184
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,680
That's a good idea.

185
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,800
Garcon! Garcon!

186
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,760
What do you mean, ''garcon''?
lt's Grogan. What'll you have?

187
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,000
Why, l'd like a nice...

188
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,160
large, cold...

189
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,200
flagon of beer.

190
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,400
- What's yours?
- Two clean straws that haven't been used.

191
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,520
l wonder what's in that package.

192
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,280
Didn't you hear what the Captain said?
That's none of your business.

193
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,040
Always prying into other people's affairs!

194
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,520
(Whistles appreciatively)

195
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,480
lsn't that a pip?

196
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,720
(Whistles) lt certainly is.

197
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,640
That must have cost more than $5.

198
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,360
What do you mean $5?
lf it cost a penny it cost $50!

199
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,760
Huh!

200
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,480
That'll be a quarter.

201
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,600
A quarter?! What for?

202
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,040
Ten cents for the beer
and 15 cents for the straws.

203
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,520
15 cents for the straws?!

204
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,680
You don't think
we're giving 'em away, do you?

205
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,760
Waiter, could you exchange this
for a couple of spoons?

206
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,520
Give me those straws,
l'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

207
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Oh, l'm sorry. Just a little accident.

208
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
That's all right. Accidents will happen.

209
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,120
(Giggles)

210
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,400
lf l've spoiled your drink
may l buy you another?

211
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,360
We don't mind if you do. Won't you join us?

212
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,160
Oh!

213
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,200
We don't mind if we do.

214
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,840
Thank you. Come, Alfie.

215
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,000
My name is Mr Hardy
and this is my very good friend Mr Laurel.

216
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,680
l'm glad to know you.
This is my very good friend Lily.

217
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,040
- How do you do, Lily?
- How do you do?

218
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,320
And my name is, er, Alice.

219
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,480
Alice.

220
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,920
My mother's name was Alice.

221
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,760
(lnhales)

222
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,160
(Sighs)

223
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,640
Your mother's name wasn't Alice.

224
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,240
That was her second name
on my father's side.

225
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,800
Hey, Joe, meet a couple of pals of ours -
Mr Laurel and Mr Hardy.

226
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,720
l met 'em. So what?

227
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,760
Two more beers for the ladies.

228
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,880
- No more beer for us.
- Oh, you must have something...Alice.

229
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,840
lf you insist l'll have an absinthe frappe.

230
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,920
l think l'll have the same.

231
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,240
You couldn't split one, could you?

232
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,320
What about something to eat?

233
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,880
- What's ready?
- A quarter pound steak's just coming.

234
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,800
- OK.
- And you?

235
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,400
A Lobster Newburg, mock turtle soup,
a New York cut steak - well-done,

236
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,040
lyonnaise potatoes,
broccoli with hollandaise sauce on the side,

237
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,280
lettuce with Roquefort cheese dressing,
coffee - demitasse - and that's all.

238
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,200
Don't you want any dessert?

239
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,480
- That's sweet of you. Crepe suzette.
- (Lily) Make that two.

240
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,960
(Crack)

241
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,840
Excuse me just a moment.

242
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,840
(lnaudible)

243
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,320
Er, will you pardon us? My friend
wishes to speak to me in private.

244
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,480
- Go right ahead.
- We'll be right back.

245
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,840
Let's go in there, we can talk
and nobody will hear us.

246
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,600
(Grunts)

247
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,520
What is it?

248
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,440
What about them ordering all that food?
We've only got 75 cents.

249
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,600
l've got it all figured out.

250
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,560
We'll go and see Finn
and get our money back.

251
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,880
He won't give us it. We told him...

252
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,560
Oh, yes he will. l know how to handle him.

253
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,440
Besides, it's our money
and we'll do what we like with it.

254
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,040
l thought we were going to start saving.

255
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,520
We can start saving on the next trip.

256
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,160
We've got a chance to have a swell time
so we might as well take advantage of it.

257
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,000
l guess you're right.
We can be millionaires anytime.

258
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
Any old time. Now let's go back to the girls.

259
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,440
(Telephone ringing)

260
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,000
- Hello?
- Hello.

261
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,800
- Who is it?
- lt's me.

262
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,560
- What do you want?
- Nothing, what do you want?

263
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,280
- Nothing, you rang.
- l didn't do anything of the kind.

264
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,400
- You did...
- Put that back and get out of here.

265
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,440
(Ringing)

266
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,080
(Slurring) Hey! Would you chaps mind
stepping out a minute? That call is for me.

267
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,200
Hey! Stay where you are, l'll get it,
it'll only take a second.

268
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,840
l'm sorry to disturb you boys
but this call is from the wife.

269
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,840
You know, l have to tell her
l'm bringing home the milk.

270
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,200
Would you rather we stepped out?

271
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,200
No, stay where you are, l'll just be a second.

272
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,240
(Ringing)

273
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,000
Hello! (Grunts)

274
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,600
- l lost... Where is it? Where'd you...?
- Right here, sir.

275
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,320
- You won't talk long?
- l won't.

276
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,680
Listen, l'm bringing home the...

277
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,760
Pardon me, will ya?

278
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,960
Just a minute! lt's a little...
l don't know, it's so crowded.

279
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,920
Here, could you...?

280
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,600
lt's just... Hello?
Just a minute now. l'll get this.

281
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,360
Hello?! l'm calling about...

282
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,280
Er...l think somebody took the phone.
Wait a minute.

283
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,880
Hello, Sarah. Yes. How much?

284
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,320
Just a minute. Hello!

285
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,040
Boys, just a minute. Listen.

286
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,880
Just... l'll pull the wire.

287
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,760
l'll... Oh, l lost it! Where's the thing?

288
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,320
Where you got that thing? Do you got it?
Are you hurt?

289
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,600
- l'll get it.
- Hello?

290
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,160
(Yells)

291
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,320
Just a minute, something's on my foot.
Can you hold the wire?

292
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,200
Wait a minute, l can't find the...

293
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
Whoa! Hello?!

294
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,320
Hello? Can you...?

295
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,040
(All) Ohh!

296
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,320
- What's the big idea?
- Sorry, sir, just a little accident.

297
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,520
Yeah, well, you'll pay for this.

298
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,840
Just put it on the check, please.

299
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,960
- Don't worry, it'll be on there.
- Come, Alf.

300
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,160
Joe, come and give me a hand with this!

301
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,120
- Did you get in a fight?
- No, just a little conference.

302
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,560
- Nothing serious, l hope?
- Oh, no.

303
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,920
We've just decided that if you don't mind,
we'll change our clothes

304
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,000
and take you out for a good time.

305
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,000
- That's OK with me.
- Me too! Don't be long.

306
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,320
- We won't.
- Don't go away cos we're coming back.

307
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,280
- You bet we won't.
- We'll be back in a jiffy.

308
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,160
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- Shh.

309
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,080
We're going to change our clothes
and get some more money.

310
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,760
- More money?
- Yeah, you see we didn't have enough.

311
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,880
Yes, sir, and while we're gone, see that
the little ladies have everything they desire.

312
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,560
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

313
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,880
Now, don't go away, will you?
We won't be long.

314
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,320
Come on, don't dilly-dally!

315
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,640
You're always fiddling around.

316
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,120
Just a minute, you think l'd let you
get away from here without paying that bill?

317
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,040
You give me that dough
or l'll beat you both up or have you pinched.

318
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,400
Or maybe both!

319
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,360
Can't you make up your mind?

320
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,880
My good man, don't you understand?
lt's simple.

321
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,600
- We'll get our money and come back.
- See?

322
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,800
No, you ain't leaving here until you pay
or leave me something for security.

323
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,000
Why don't you leave him the ring?

324
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,800
We'll get our money from Finn
and the Captain won't be any the wiser.

325
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,680
- Splendid.
- We've figured out a plan.

326
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,480
You'll like this.

327
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
How about that for security?

328
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,200
(Whistles appreciatively)

329
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,520
(Whistles) lsn't that a daisy?

330
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,440
- lt's all right with me.
- Now remember.

331
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,600
When we come back and pay you
we get that ring back, right?

332
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
- Right.
- Right.

333
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,160
(Knock at door)

334
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,840
(Knock at door)

335
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,680
Who is it?

336
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,360
- lt's us.
- Hello, boys, come on in.

337
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,240
- How are you, Finn?
- What's on your mind?

338
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,200
We hate to disturb you
but we've come to ask a little favour.

339
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,080
What do you want?

340
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,360
We've just had the good fortune to meet
two charming and refined young ladies.

341
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,400
Yeah, Alice and Lily.

342
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,320
So what?

343
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,240
lf you don't mind, we'd like to cancel
our little financial arrangement.

344
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,520
We decided to put off being millionaires
till the next trip.

345
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,160
lf it's your money you want,
l am not interested.

346
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,640
- You won't give us our money back?
- l will not.

347
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,880
But it's ours - besides, we don't get paid
till we get to Singapore.

348
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,360
Not one penny will you get.

349
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,760
l made a gentlemen's agreement with you
to protect you from yourselves.

350
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,440
- Should l go back on my word?
- We wouldn't mind, would we?

351
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,040
- We won't hold it against you!
- Go ahead.

352
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,120
Get out of here!

353
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,640
Well, if that's the way you feel about it
we'll be forced to assert our prerogative

354
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,320
and search this room.

355
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,920
Go ahead and search, what do l care?

356
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,120
You'll be sorry, putting us to all this trouble.

357
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,400
lt's no use looking here, you can search
till Doomsday and you'll never find it.

358
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,920
Does that mean it isn't in this room?

359
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,080
l wouldn't say yes and l wouldn't say no.

360
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,920
- You know what we can do?
- What?

361
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,040
- We can...
- Shh.

362
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,760
We can steal his clothes and pawn them
and get enough money to pay the bill.

363
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,600
We'll give you one more chance.
Do we get our money or not?

364
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,840
Absolutely not.

365
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,240
No! Oh!

366
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,960
(Finn grunting)

367
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,280
Hey, come back! Hey, stop!

368
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,080
Come on, you know
we've got to meet the wives.

369
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,680
Stay here - asking the pawnbroker
if he had any second hand ice-cream cones!

370
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,160
(Parps)

371
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,360
(Parps)

372
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,280
How much did you get?

373
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,600
- Two dollars.
- Well, we can't pay the bill with that.

374
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,520
- The girls are still...
- Don't worry, l'll take charge of this matter.

375
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,400
Come on.

376
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,120
Maybe we better talk to Finn from
a distance. He was pretty mad when we left.

377
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,000
Good idea.

378
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,200
(Whistles)

379
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
(Both) Oh, Finn!

380
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,960
- Maybe he's asleep.
- l'll wake him up.

381
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,800
(Clack)

382
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,040
Ow!

383
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,800
- We're back!
- Where's my clothes?

384
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,400
- We pawned them!
- What?!

385
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,360
lf you don't give us our money
we won't give you the ticket!

386
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,920
Yeah, and the ship'll sail
and you'll be left behind.

387
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,760
All right, give me the ticket
and l'll give you your money.

388
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,800
- You cross your heart?
- You don't doubt me, do you?

389
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,600
(Both) Yes!

390
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,640
Oh-ho!

391
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,640
We'll be right up!

392
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,120
Here's the ticket and
there's the two dollars to get your suit.

393
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,560
- Now give us our money.
- l have to go and get it.

394
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,640
- Where is it?
- Sewn in the lining of my coat you pawned.

395
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,560
Why didn't you tell us before?
Having us run about on a wild goose chase!

396
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,760
- Give me the ticket, l'll go and get it!
- Oh, no. Once bitten, twice shy!

397
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,560
- Give us the ticket...
- l've got it figured out. Take off your clothes.

398
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,840
- What for?
- One suit l'll wear there,

399
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,760
the other suit l'll pawn to pay the interest.

400
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,600
Oh, no you don't. Give me the ticket!

401
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,680
Don't you come near me or l'll swallow it
and you'll lose your money.

402
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,880
- Give me that!
- (Muffled)

403
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,800
No, don't swallow it, don't swallow it.

404
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,040
Take off your clothes and put them
down there. Put them down.

405
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,200
And no monkey tricks!

406
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,920
Well, here's another nice mess
you've gotten me into.

407
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,960
(Whimpering)

408
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,360
l wonder what those girls will think.

409
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,280
(Ollie) Hey, Finn!

410
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,880
- Are you coming back?
- l wouldn't say yes and l wouldn't say no.

411
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,400
Oh, and if l see Alice and Lily
l'll give them your love.

412
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,480
Maybe l'll give them a kiss for you.
(Chuckles)

413
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,000
- l wonder how much longer they'll be.
- l don't know.

414
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,520
(Both) Are you sure this is
where they said to meet?

415
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,680
- Shakespeare.
- Longfellow.

416
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,920
- What goes up the chimney?
- Smoke.

417
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
They make me sick...

418
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,640
- Darling!
- Hello, sweetie!

419
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,880
- l'm sorry we were late.
- Oh, we just got here.

420
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
What have you boys been doing?

421
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,600
- Ollie, tell 'em where we went.
- Stan took me to a Punch and Judy show.

422
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,960
- First one since l was a kid.
- How about some food? l'm famished.

423
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,280
Oh, that's a good idea. Why not go in here?

424
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,920
Oh, not in there, we know a better place.

425
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,600
- We'll go in here.
- But dear...

426
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,160
l said we'll go in here. Come along, Betty.

427
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,200
Oh, this is a nice table. Sit here, Betty.

428
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,960
- Let's go in the garden, it's cooler.
- All right, dear.

429
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,120
(Ollie) How's this table?

430
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,560
- (Daphne) Nice.
- Better than being inside.

431
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,920
Of all the nerve!

432
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,960
You got here at last, huh?

433
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,240
What do you mean? We weren't coming in
in the first place, were we?

434
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,320
l wasn't.
What are you gonna have, Momma?

435
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,200
A ham sandwich, mustard on the side
and a glass of beer.

436
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,280
- What would you like, Bubbles?
- Now, don't rush me, lover.

437
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,480
l think l'll have a nice Welsh rarebit.

438
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,520
- One Welsh rarebit.
- With cheese.

439
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,080
- What's yours?
- Er, l think l'll...

440
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,440
l know what you guys are gonna have.

441
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,920
He's an awfully fresh waiter.

442
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,120
Poppa, what did he mean,
''You got here at last''?

443
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,040
l don't know, Momma.

444
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,920
(Both) We never met him before in our lives.

445
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,080
- Shakespeare.
- Longfellow.

446
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,280
- What goes up the chimney?
- Santa Claus.

447
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,320
Silly.

448
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,000
The Welsh rarebit'll be right up.

449
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,000
lsn't that the way with men?

450
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,680
We've known them all afternoon
and they pick up with some strangers!

451
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,200
They're not gonna get away with it.
Come on, Lily.

452
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,480
l don't think much of your taste,
ditching us for these old frumps.

453
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,640
Pardon? Do you know who you're talking to?

454
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,600
Aw, sit down, old lady, before you fall apart.

455
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,120
Cutie, that wasn't very nice of you
to walk out and leave us sitting here.

456
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,400
l beg your pardon, madam,
just what do you mean?

457
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,080
What are you looking so innocent about?

458
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,040
- l'm not so innocent.
- You bet you're not!

459
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,200
And you oughta be ashamed of yourself!

460
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,960
No wonder you didn't want to come in here.
Thank goodness l found you out.

461
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,240
Ow! But l tell you, this is a frame-up!

462
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,840
We've never met these women, have we?!

463
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,760
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, you've never met us? Joe!

464
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,960
- Yeah?
- Who are these men?

465
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,840
Last time they called themselves
Mr Laurel and Mr Hardy.

466
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,440
Pay the check and let's get out of here!

467
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,280
Yes, pay it, we've been waiting two hours!

468
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,320
Bye-bye, babyface.

469
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,280
So you went to
a Punch and Judy show, huh?

470
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,240
Here's your bill.

471
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,400
15 dollars and 60 cents for this?!

472
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,080
No, 60 cents for this
and 15 dollars for before.

473
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,520
- l should...!
- Oh, pay the check!

474
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,600
- But...!
- Pay the check!

475
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,200
- l'll pay.
- You better pay the check.

476
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,440
Thanks. And here's the ring
you left for security.

477
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,760
Oh, so you're buying rings now.
l suppose that's part of the frame-up too?

478
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,120
Betty, l've had enough! And as for you,
you can see my lawyer in the morning.

479
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,200
Oh, lover, l don't see how you could
ever have done this to me.

480
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,840
l never was so humiliated in all my life.

481
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,880
- Glass of beer, please.
- OK.

482
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,640
(Betty sobbing)

483
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
(Till bell rings)

484
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,920
Well, well, well, fancy meeting you here.
Which is Alice and which is Lily?

485
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,880
- ''Alice and Lily''?
- Are you sure you know these gentlemen?

486
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,240
They're buddies of mine.
Where did you get the swell clothes?

487
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,960
- ''Clothes''?!
- Last time l saw them they had none on.

488
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,240
They had no clothes on?! Who is this man?

489
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,400
- He's an absolute stranger to us, isn't he?
- He certainly is.

490
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,720
Who am l? Er, you.

491
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,280
Stranger, eh?
Oh, trying to make out they don't know me!

492
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,720
Well, you take a look at that.

493
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,600
(Daphne) Oh!

494
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,400
(Betty) Oh! Ohh!

495
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,440
(Both) Oh!

496
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,040
That settles it.
Betty, we'll keep this as evidence.

497
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,360
- Momma, let me explain...
- Never speak to me again, Casanova!

498
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,280
- Come on, Betty!
- Goodbye, lover.

499
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,760
- Do you realise what you've done?
- l don't care.

500
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,320
You should've introduced me.
They weren't so hot anyway.

501
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,640
Where did you pick them up?
Did you win them on a punchboard?

502
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,200
- Do you know what l oughta do?
- What?

503
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,560
l oughta bend every bone in your head.

504
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,760
- ls that so?
- Yes.

505
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,840
Hm.

506
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,360
Uh-oh. Take a look through that.

507
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,080
Ow!

508
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,880
(Laughs)

509
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,320
Uh-oh. Well, l'll be seeing you.

510
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,480
Don't go. Sit down.

511
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,240
(Gulps)

512
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,120
(Wheezes)

513
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,160
- (Crackles)
- (Yells)

514
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,640
(Gasps)

515
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,360
One Welsh rarebit.

516
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,400
(Smashes)

517
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,880
- Who done this?
- (Both) He did!

518
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,600
- Hey!
- Eh? What?!

519
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,760
l'll get you for this! l'll get you for this!

520
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,440
(Smashing and banging outside)

521
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,000
- Who was that fella?
- How should l know?

522
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,960
- When did you meet the two girls?
- When did l meet the girls?

523
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,160
You must know them,
they knew us when we came in.

524
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,440
What are you talking about?

525
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,200
You can confide in me, l can keep a secret.

526
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Will you get this through that thick skull

527
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,760
that l don't know those girls
and they don't know me!

528
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,120
- ls that the truth?
- Certainly.

529
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:17,600
Well, we should go and tell Momma and
Bubbles they've done us a terrible wrong.

530
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,480
We'll do nothing of the kind.

531
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,320
- l'm going to teach them a lesson.
- How do you mean?

532
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,800
We're going to stay out all night

533
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,040
and we're not going home
until they come to us and apologise.

534
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,920
Good idea. We'll give 'em
enough rope to hang ourselves.

535
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,800
Hello buddies, what's the trouble now?

536
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,640
Oh, we just had an argument with the wives.

537
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,520
Yes, we're going to teach them a lesson,
aren't we, Ollie?

538
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,360
Yes, and we're going to stay out all night.

539
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,000
- Yeah, till nine o'clock.
- That's funny, l'm in the doghouse too.

540
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,320
Well, we're all in the same boat.

541
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,720
Say, let's all make a night of it.

542
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,880
That's a very potent suggestion.

543
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,640
(Both) All for one and one for all.

544
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,640
- All...
- Shakespeare.

545
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,680
- Longfellow.
- Washington.

546
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,400
- What goes down the flue?
- A good slug of liquor.

547
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,880
- Right!
- Bartender!

548
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,560
No more drinks. You've had too much
and you two guys haven't had enough.

549
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,520
- What do you mean?
- No lip or l'll throw you all out.

550
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,320
Look through there.

551
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,440
Oh-oh!

552
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,120
(Bell tolling)

553
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,480
(Snoring)

554
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,640
What time is it?

555
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,480
Four bells, and all is still wet.

556
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,760
Looks like Finn isn't coming back.

557
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,000
l told you that an hour ago,

558
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,760
but you had to give me the argument about
''everything comes to him who waits''.

559
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,880
- What should we do?
- That's entirely up to you.

560
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,720
You thought of a way to get us into
this mess, now think of a way to get us out.

561
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,960
The only way l can see
is to go and get the waiter,

562
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,480
take him to the ship, have the Captain
pay the bill and get his ring back,

563
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,840
then we'll pay the Captain on the next trip.

564
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,880
- He might be a bit mad...
- That's a very, very, very good idea.

565
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,760
But how are we going to get to the waiter?

566
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,160
We can't go out dressed like this,
we wouldn't get to first base.

567
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,200
- Never thought of that.
- Hm.

568
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,920
Well...

569
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,840
- Say, you know what?
- What?

570
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,840
Why don't we dress up
like those guys in Singapore?

571
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,880
What guys in Singapore?

572
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,640
The fellas that look like Eskimos.
The guys that walk around with rugs.

573
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,440
- Eskimos.
- Yeah, we borrow these quilts

574
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,640
and put some towels round our heads
and nobody'd be any the wiser.

575
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,440
- We could go and get the waiter...
- Hm.

576
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,760
That sounds screwy to me.

577
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,440
But any old port in a storm.

578
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,720
- lt might be a good idea.
- You've gotta be right once in your life.

579
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:29,480
l'm looking for two sailors from the
Periwinkle, a little fellow and a big fat one.

580
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,320
The two guys with the pearl ring?

581
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,440
How did you know they had a pearl ring?

582
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,240
l saw it. They gave it to me as security
and l gave it back when they paid.

583
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,800
- Where are they?
- They were with a drunk, l threw 'em out.

584
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,200
They're probably in another joint -
er, beer parlour.

585
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,600
Thanks very much!

586
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,120
Now, let me do the talking.

587
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,480
- Good evening, Mr Grogan.
- Good evening.

588
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,480
- lt's possible you don't recognise us but...
- Oh, yes l do.

589
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,040
What was the last thing l said to you?
Didn't l tell you to get out?

590
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,680
No, the last thing you said was, ''Right!''
Didn't he?

591
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,920
Quit clowning. What do you want?

592
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,200
We've figured out a plan
so we can get our ring back.

593
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,040
- Yeah, you see...
- Oh, what are you two talking about?

594
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,640
The ring - the ring we left as security.

595
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,120
Yes, and l gave you back when you paid.

596
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,360
- You didn't give anything to us!
- We never paid.

597
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,440
Are you saying l'm a thief
and l stole that ring?

598
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,760
That's the way it appears to us.

599
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,960
- You'd better give that...
- Shh.

600
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,920
Look through that.

601
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Just a moment.

602
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,880
Ow!

603
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,400
Oh-oh!

604
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,800
What?!

605
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,800
(Sighs)

606
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,360
(Clink, groan, thud)

607
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,640

My goodness, don't tell me!

Thank you very much!

624
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,040
- What's the matter?
- That was Mrs Adelquist.

625
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,520
Stan and Oliver have been arrested

- Do you speak Arabic?
- Oh, no, sir.

633
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,360
We're a couple of Singapore Eskimos.

634
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,400
Oh.

635

- l'm sorry.
- (Man) What's the idea?!

636
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,120
Hey, Mr Clerk, we'd like to see Judge Polk.

637
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,520
- lt's very important.

- Come this way.
- Thank you.

643
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,760
Did you see that?

644

- l wonder who they are.
- l don't know.

645

They're a couple of vacation killers.

646
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,040
- ''Vacation killers''?
- Yeah.

647
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,640
A guy goes to jail for a swell vacation.

648
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,480
These welfare workers get him out.
They make me sick.

649
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,760
Huh, first time l ever saw a welfare worker.

650
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,080
- Me too.
- Funny-looking dames.

651
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,040
l don't know, l liked that big fat blonde.
(Chuckles)

652
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,440
- The little one wasn't so bad.
- Cute.

653
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,720
And you see it really is our fault,

654
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,400
and if you're not too harsh on them
l think they'll behave in future.

655
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,440
l know my lover will.

656
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,200
What do you mean?
He's just as much to blame as Poppa was!

657
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,600
- He's not!
- l think he started it!

658
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,920
Now, now, now, don't worry,
everything's going to be all right.

659
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,800
lf you'll step into that room,
l'll have a heart-to-heart talk with them.

660
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,880
Oh, judge, you're so sweet.

661

662

Laurel and Hardy! Step this way.

663
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,200

664
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,680
(Laughing)

665
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,240
Where on earth have you fellows been?

666
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,520
And how in the world
did you get in those outfits?

667
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,760
- Well, it was like this, we...
- Tell me later, l've got to open court.

668
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,840
l don't know what you boys have done
but l'm going to overlook it this time.

669
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,280
But you've got to stop
this gallivanting around.

670
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,960
- There's a time and place for everything.
- Yes, sir.

671
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,200
You've got two lovely girls,
why don't you appreciate them?

672
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,120
Will you do that?

673
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,720
Whatever you say goes, judge.
We're in your hands.

674
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,760
That's fine.

675
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,600
Girls...

676
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,000
l've just had a talk with the boys

677
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,920
and l suggest that you all get together.

678
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:39,760
Come on, boys, give them a great big kiss,
and let bygones be bygones.

679
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,320
Get off of him!

680
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,360
That's splendid. Well, see you later.

681
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,880
- Do we have to come back here?
- Not if you behave.

682
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,800
But my advice is to stay out of beer gardens.

683
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,400
lf you want to have a good time go to a
high-class place where there's less trouble.

684
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,560
Now, don't forget.

685
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,200

686
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,240
Not now, some other time.

Here, we brought you some clothes.

As soon as you're dressed

and go to a high-class place
for a good time.

691
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,400
lf you promise never to get into
any more trouble, we'll forget this.

- He can't do that!
- No, sir!

And take that hat off! Go on.

765
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,080
lt must be Bert - l'll go and see.

766
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,760
- What's happened?
- Where's the manager?

767
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,760
What manager?

768
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,360
Beat it, beat it!

769
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,640
He slipped the ring in his pal's pocket.

770
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,400
- Here's the manager.
- So, trying to get away, eh?!

771
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,480
- l'll get you!
- This man's a lunatic! He's trying to rob us!

772
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,880
- Rob you?! You dirty crook!
- You'll have to settle this outside!

773
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,280
This is gonna be settled here and now!
Go on, get out of my way!

774
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,960
- Give me my ring!
- Take him out!

775
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,600
- l'll get you!
- Take him! Get him out of here!

776
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,640
Look, come on and stand up!

777
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,960
Eh? Will you get... Just...

778
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,360
What?

779
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,720
- The trouble with him is he's drunk.
- That's about right!

780
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,560
- Take him. Get him.
- (Captain) l'll get you!

781
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,360
- lt's a good thing we sent for the manager.
- lt was.

782
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,400
Give me the ring back, it'll be safer with me.

783
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,440
What do you mean?
You didn't give me the ring.

784
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,520
l did, l slipped it in your pocket
when l told you to beat it.

785
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,440
l haven't got the ring.

786
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,120
(Ollie) Are you trying
to hold it back from me?

787
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,960
Can you imagine that?
My pal trying to double-cross me!

788
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,600
Excuse me, gentlemen, it's not my business
but l saw him put the ring in your pocket.

789
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,040
What do you mean? l haven't got it!

790
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,600
Pardon me for butting in
but may l speak to you alone?

791
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,080
Why, sure. Pardon me.

792
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,120
- Would you like us to scare it out of him?
- How?

793
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,800
We can make out we're tough guys
and take him for a ride.

794
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,720
- (Chuckles)
- What did he say?

795
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:56,200
These gentlemen have invited us for a ride.
Would you like to go along?

796
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,560
l'd love to but what about the ring?

797
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,000
Oh, just forget that. l was only kidding!
l've got it right there.

798
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,040
You had me worried.

799
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,960
lf you're going for a ride
would you drop me off at home?

800
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,400
- Sure, we'll be glad to drop you off.
- Thanks, pal.

801
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,320
- Come on, boys, let's go.
- (Stan) Gotcha.

802
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,800
- Call a cab.
- Taxi!

803
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,440
l hope it doesn't rain.

804
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,080
(Police siren)

805
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,440
Oh! There they go!

806
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,440
(Siren wailing)

807
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,720
Hm.

808
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,800
- Did you get rid of him?
- Who?

809
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,080
- The Captain.
- l haven't seen him. Have you?

810
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,640
What? You told me to beat it
and he's been chasing me.

811
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:13,600
- You mean the Captain is in here?
- You saw him, he's as mad as a firefly.

812
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,560
We've got to get out of here!

813
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,080
Oh, there you are! l've been looking for you.

814
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,200
- What happened to your face?
- You know what!

815
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,040
Don't think you can put mustard on my head
and burn my nose!

816
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,720
- What's he talking about?
- Before it was two to one.

817
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,000
Now it's three to two, that makes it even.

818
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,200
You must be barmy. We haven't...

819
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,960
Barmy, am l? At 'em, boys!

820
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,040
You go that way and cut off their retreat.
Come on!

821
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,800
Fooled you, didn't l?

822
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,280
Up aloft after them! Come on!

823
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,440
(Crowd chattering excitedly)

824
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,840
(Stan whimpers)

825
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,680
(Creaking)

826
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,880
Whoa!

827
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,560
(Screaming)

828
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,520
(Whimpering)

829
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,080
There they go!

830
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,000
Come on, now!

831
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,880
(Honking horn)

832
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,880
That's the boss.

833
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,600
Good job getting rid of the cops. Stand by.

834
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:25,000
- This way, gentlemen.
- Say, you forgot to drop our friend off.

835
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,600
Oh, he's asleep. We'll do that later.

836
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,880
- Hello, boss.
- Hello, Tiny.

837
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,560
Hello, boss.

838
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,720
Boys, meet some friends of mine.

839
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,880
- How do you do?
- How are you?

840
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,240
This lug refuses to give up
a valuable pearl ring.

841
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,560
- No, he's got the ring...
- Shh!

842
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,320
One of you has it
and you'd better cough it up.

843
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,320
(Both) l haven't got it!

844
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,400
- Shakespeare.
- Not now!

845
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,640
All right, you crooks,
we'll give you the works.

846
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,280
Go to it, Tiny. You know where to find us.

847
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,040
- All right, boss.
- What about our ride?

848
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,240
- Just a minute...!
- Sit down.

849
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,240
- But l wanna talk to these men.
- Sit down!

850
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,640
- All right, boys, mix up the cement.
- Sure, Tiny.

851
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:21,360
- What are you gonna do?
- Put your feet in cement.

852
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,440
And if you don't talk,
we're gonna throw you off the dock!

853
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,360
Why don't you give 'em the ring?

854
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,760
(Whimpering) l haven't got the ring! You
told me you had it when were in the bar!

855
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:38,000
l can't remember you giving it to me
in there and... Oh!

856
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,440
- (Whimpering)
- Hey, hey!

857
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,320
You go that way.

858
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Where in tarnation did they go?

859
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,040
They gave us the slip.

860
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,160
- We'd better get back to the ship.
- That's them there!

861
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,680
- (Ollie) Oh-o-o!
- (Stan yelping)

862
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,720
(Siren wailing)

863
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,680
Good and hard now, Tiny.

864
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,000
- (Tiny) Take 'em out.
- OK.

865
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,560
- (Stan whimpering hysterically)
- Oh! Be careful!

866
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,760
Oh! Ohh!

867
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,640
Ohh...

868
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,240
- No!
- You can't do this to us!

869
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,280
- (Shrieking)
- Oh-ho.

870
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:41,760
Stop that crying!
Now this is your last chance.

871
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,040
Tell us where that ring is or over you go.

872
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,400
(Whimpering) We don't know, do we?

873
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,840
How can we tell you if we don't remember?

874
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,680
- Maybe this'll help!
- (Both) Oh!

875
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,400
(Laughing)

876
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,960
(Yelling)

877
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,440
(Stan whimpering hysterically)

878
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,720
Take this thing off of my head!

879
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,720
(Stan wailing)

880
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,680
(Yelling)

881
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,320
(Whimpering hysterically)

882
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,200
(Ollie) Oh!

883
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,920
(Both yelling)

884
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,000
(Police siren wailing)

885
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,520
(Siren slows, stops)

886
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,440
- Help!
- Help!

887
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:39,440
- There they are!
- Help!

888
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,360
- Come on.
- Help!

889
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,760
Now you swabs,
give me that ring or l'll drown you!

890
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,960
(Both) We don't know where it is!

891
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,920
- Shakespeare.
- Not now!

892
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,920
Let 'em go.

893
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,640
- Pull 'em up again.
- Give me another, this is my last one.

894
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,680
Here's a boxful.

895
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,360
Er...

896
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,360
- Where did that come from?
- Never mind.

897
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,960
We'll give it back to the Captain.

898
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,840
Oh, Captain, there's your ring.

899
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,760
Thanks very much.

900
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,480
(Howls)

901
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,840
(Both yelling)

902
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,000
- What's that?
- Somebody's fallen overboard!

903
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,040
Help me pull them up!

904
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,880
(Yelling)

905
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:24,320
- Did you see what l saw?
- You know who they are?

906
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,640
- Our twins, Stan and Ollie!
- What are they doing?

907
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,960
l don't know! Come on, get 'em up!

908
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,680
Well, well, well, hello, Ollie!

909
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,440
Hello, Bert. Gee, it's great to see you.

910
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,200
- Hello, Stan.
- Hello, Alf.

911
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,760
What are you doing here?
Mother told us you were dead.

912
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,520
We just arrived today on the Periwinkle.

913
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,040
That explains it all - they've been
mistaken for us and us for them.

914
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:07,720
Why, certainly! (Laughs)

915
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:12,920
- Let's go and explain it to the wives.
- You look good, Stan, but you've altered.

916
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,160
You've altered too
but you haven't changed a bit, has he?

917
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,640
Come on, Bert.

918
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,920
