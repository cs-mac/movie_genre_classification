1
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,346
Now, easy, boy.

2
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,143
Steady. Wait, whoa!

3
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:14,412
Fucking wings!
What's going on?

4
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,560
Fucking white horse!

5
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:31,093
lt's not bad, dude.

6
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,392
Don't give up your day job.

7
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:43,274
ls he Milli or Vanilli?

8
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:46,771
You are a genius.

9
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,027
-Hey, Andy.
-Yo, Eddie!

10
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:09,226
Drinks on the house!

11
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,025
Hey, baby!

12
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:45,299
Hollywood.

13
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:09,721
Hold it!

14
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:02,913
Hold it!

15
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:10,221
-Thank you.
-No problem.

16
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:16,089
l'm in love.
You're a fox, baby.

17
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,926
Not just a fox,
but the fox of foxes!

18
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:23,461
lf l was a hound dog,
you wouldn't stand a chance.

19
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:27,573
l'd be snapping at you
day and night.

20
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:29,599
l'm a snapper.

21
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,908
Edward Dash?

22
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:34,809
-That's me.
-Take a seat.

23
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:38,008
Well, Mr. Dash...

24
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:42,178
...for your probation, you owe us
1 00 hours of community service.

25
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,517
Let's see what we've got.

26
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:51,756
The L.A. Housing Facility
needs help with bricklaying.

27
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:54,161
No laying bricks or stuff like that.

28
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:56,602
l don't do that lifting shit.

29
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:58,931
-Graffiti removal?
-You heard what l said?

30
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,701
Does that preclude you
from doing anything strenuous?

31
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,378
Yes, it precludes me.

32
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:10,480
We do have a few
less strenuous activities.

33
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,176
But they involve helping
the disadvantaged...

34
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:15,514
...and there are certain requirements.

35
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:19,989
l can have a degree here in 24 hours.
From Harvard!

36
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,684
A degree isn't necessary.

37
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:24,797
lt's a matter of
patience and kindness.

38
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:27,331
What they're looking for
is a ''people person.''

39
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,502
That's me.

40
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,228
Are you telling me
you are a ''people person''?

41
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,907
That's what l'm telling you.

42
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:39,673
How about spending some time...

43
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,782
...with a voluntary patient
from the Rivington Clinic?

44
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:43,814
No lifting?

45
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:45,508
The Rivington is a sanitarium.

46
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,985
Your job would be
to accompany the individual...

47
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,658
...to various therapeutic
and cultural pursuits.

48
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:55,693
l guess that means taking a patient
to the ballet or museum.

49
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,559
Museum?
l know a great one of those.

50
00:05:58,766 --> 00:05:58,833
I can handIe this.

51
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,630
I can handIe this.

52
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,369
George, you've been ready for months
to go back into the world.

53
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,131
But you have to feel ready.

54
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:08,831
Do you feel ready, George?

55
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:10,510
l don't know.

56
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:12,071
He's not ready.

57
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,972
You're scared, aren't you?

58
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:16,513
You're scared a girl will ask
to see your mickey.

59
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:18,275
That's enough, Brad.
Let him talk.

60
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:20,113
No, no, that's not it.

61
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:23,615
He's just scared of lying.
lsn't that right, Pinoc?

62
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,025
And then his nose starts growing.
l hate when that happens.

63
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:32,932
Are you afraid you might
start to lie again, George?

64
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,565
What's a pathological liar
going to say? ''Now l'm going to lie''?

65
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:42,036
Yesterday, you couldn't wait to go.
Do you remember?

66
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:44,973
You said, ''l'm a-ready, Teddy-o!''

67
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:47,473
What did you say yesterday?

68
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:49,112
l'm a-ready, Teddy-o.

69
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:55,578
Hit the deck! lncoming!

70
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:57,914
Why are you afraid, George?

71
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:01,026
Why can't l just stay here?

72
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:03,128
Why do l have to go?
l like it here.

73
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:05,490
-l feel safe here.
-American 357.

74
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,724
Why can't l stay?

75
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:09,164
Definitely U.S. Air.
Excellent airline.

76
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,065
Flight 202 from Baltimore.

77
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:14,935
There's a nice
young man coming here...

78
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:18,669
...to take you to find you
an apartment and a job.

79
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,143
You're looking forward to that,
aren't you?

80
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,516
He's afraid he'll see his girlfriend
and won't be able to get it up.

81
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:33,159
-No, l'm not.
-ls that it, George?

82
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:35,790
Anyway, she dumped me.

83
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:39,692
She dumped you because
you said you were a brain surgeon!

84
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,424
l did not say that.

85
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:42,602
What'd you tell her?

86
00:07:42,803 --> 00:07:44,270
A commando in the Navy Seals.

87
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:49,369
Why do you feel
you always had to lie to her?

88
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:56,349
She wouldn't have looked at me twice
if l said l was a Volvo salesman.

89
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,814
Excuse me, sir.
l hate to bother you.

90
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,181
l know you're busy with the therapy.

91
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:02,879
l need to clear something up.

92
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:05,724
You're not the governor of California?

93
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:09,958
Did you fellows know he's been lying?
l have egg on my face.

94
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:25,401
Hello?

95
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:28,207
Can you help me find Nurse Fletcher?

96
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,345
The dailies were great.
l don't understand.

97
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,646
They said the dailies were great.
l don't understand.

98
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:35,844
Your brother?

99
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,049
This would be a marvelous time
to extract the present...

100
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,227
...for George.

101
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:43,727
Very well, Mr. Spock.
Gentlemen, set your phasers on stun.

102
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:50,067
George, on behalf of my entire crew,
Spock, Bones, Scotty...

103
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:52,535
...we'd like to present you with a gift.

104
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,208
Something we picked up on Rigel lV.

105
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,776
lt's our way of saying good luck
out there in the world.

106
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:01,709
Show them what you're made of.
Live long...

107
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,905
...and prosper.

108
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:06,245
Go where no man has gone before!

109
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:08,445
Phil, will you shut up!
l think he gets it.

110
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:11,921
-l was simply saying....
-l'm very touched.

111
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,221
l must say, l didn't expect....

112
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:19,664
-A hat.
-An Honest...

113
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,391
...Abe hat.

114
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,400
lt's to house your mickey
after a busy day of lying.

115
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,436
l know it's insulting to you.

116
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,437
But the fellows did craft it.

117
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:31,611
l'm not insulted by this.
Far from it.

118
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:33,507
l'm going to wear this hat.

119
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:36,046
l've earned it.

120
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,842
l'll treasure it.

121
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:39,979
l'm not afraid anymore, Teddy.

122
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:41,718
l'm ready for my new life.

123
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:43,150
Then say it, George!

124
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:45,325
l'm a-ready, Teddy. Go!

125
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,722
Have you ever worked with
the mentally challenged, Mr. Dash?

126
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:51,796
Well, my sister's a loony.

127
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,791
What sort of work do you do?

128
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:56,469
A little bit of this,
little bit of that.

129
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,607
Look!
There he is, with the hat.

130
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:03,840
Can l have your Heath bars?

131
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:07,741
Wait, l got a lot of stuff to do,
you know?

132
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:09,245
Places to go,
people to meet.

133
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,418
You needn't worry about George.

134
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:13,416
He's not a lunatic.

135
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:15,020
Come on.

136
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,182
That must be him.

137
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:19,950
lf he starts having fits...

138
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,358
...l'll be across the street.
l don't want to be around that.

139
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:26,533
Mr. Dash, l hope
you'll be patient with George.

140
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:29,828
-He looks like a nice man.
-l'll say hello and bring him here.

141
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:31,595
See you in a minute.

142
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:33,536
Eddie.

143
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,671
Eddie, hi.

144
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,013
Playing games already, Eddie?

145
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,278
This is Eddie, isn't it?

146
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:47,685
-George, this is Eddie Dash.
-l knew it! Hello, Eddie.

147
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:52,115
Don't you kiss me no more.
l'm going to kick your ass.

148
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,594
He's going to kick my ass!

149
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:57,863
Funny.

150
00:10:58,065 --> 00:11:01,000
-l want you to meet the guys.
-Don't touch me.

151
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,470
Come on.

152
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:09,003
He's not a lunatic?

153
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:11,877
-Don't touch me!
-Motherfu--

154
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,804
Hi, everybody.
This is Eddie, my new best friend.

155
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:18,974
Eddie, this is Teddy
and Phil and Tim.

156
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:21,416
Appreciate it,
but we got to go, you see.

157
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:24,750
My car's out front.
Come on, let's go!

158
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,723
Eddie says we have to go now.
l better get going.

159
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:29,759
So long, everybody.
Goodbye, nurse.

160
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:31,056
Goodbye, George.

161
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:33,199
lf you need anything, just call.

162
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,233
-See you later.
-Write me!

163
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,913
l can't tell you how wonderful
it feels to be out on my own again.

164
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:53,484
l'm not sorry about
my time at the clinic...

165
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:56,383
...because they did me
a world of good.

166
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,458
l don't regret any of that.
l wish l could tell you sometime.

167
00:12:00,661 --> 00:12:03,459
But l mean reading articles,
seeing newspapers...

168
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:06,758
...watching life and the world
and everything on television--

169
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:09,595
l'm just anxious
to be a part of it again.

170
00:12:10,738 --> 00:12:13,104
l understand they put basil
on everything now.

171
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:14,672
l'm very fond of basil.

172
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,708
Basil is an herb
whose time has truly come.

173
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:20,642
l'm not letting you talk at all.

174
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:23,578
lt just occurred to me.
l'm hogging the conversation.

175
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,685
l don't give you
a chance to get in there.

176
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:28,377
Jabber, jabber, jabber....

177
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:30,887
l'm trying to make a good impression.

178
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:34,083
When l want to make a good
impression, l talk and talk.

179
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,786
-Jabber, jabber, jabber.
-Shut the fuck up!

180
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:38,259
Sorry.

181
00:12:40,868 --> 00:12:42,631
There it is!

182
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:45,167
-What?
-The museum!

183
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:47,966
This is going to be fun.

184
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:51,167
You'll have a good day
and take care of your life.

185
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:54,444
Aren't you coming with me?

186
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,344
l'd love to,
but l got a church group thing.

187
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:01,613
Eddie, you can't just leave me here.

188
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,986
Please, l circled the want ads.
l thought you would help me find--

189
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:08,091
Culture. There it is!

190
00:13:08,295 --> 00:13:10,263
Culture's all you want.
Right there!

191
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:16,431
l haven't been on my own
for over 3 years.

192
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:21,233
You're not alone. They got everything
from Dolly Parton to the Pope.

193
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:26,704
Eddie, just give me a minute
to get used to the idea, okay?

194
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,175
Ready?

195
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,553
No, l'm terrified!

196
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:37,189
Don't be terrified.

197
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:38,483
Hey, George!

198
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,824
Got any money?

199
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:42,727
l'm okay for money.

200
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,921
Give me $50 and l'll go in with you.

201
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:48,762
Me and you.

202
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:51,028
-l don't like it here.
-Wait a minute.

203
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:53,263
-Did they only give you $50?
-No, they--

204
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:55,601
Hi. How are you doing?

205
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,308
George!

206
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:05,815
Damn you! You see what you did
to my friend, you big, green fuck?

207
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:18,690
-My cigar!
-l'm so sorry.

208
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,628
You killed my cigar.

209
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,570
-Let me help you.
-You broke my cigar!

210
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:27,329
lt's my fault.
l shouldn't have been running.

211
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,668
Abe, it's you!

212
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:31,376
l'm not Abe.

213
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:35,981
What do you do, disappear,
then come back to kill me, Abe?

214
00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:37,946
You're mistaking me for someone else.

215
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:40,814
You mean, because of the hat.
l'm not Abe.

216
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:44,548
You're not Abe Fielding?
What is this, a joke?

217
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,524
l'm not joking at all.
l think maybe you had a bad fall.

218
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:53,693
Shit!

219
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:56,666
You know,
a lot of people would say...

220
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,498
...it's rude
to bet thousands of dollars...

221
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:01,435
...then skip town without a trace.

222
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:03,007
You're making a mistake.

223
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:05,603
l got some of it.

224
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,743
What is that?

225
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,380
-Payoff of the bet.
-What bet?

226
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:10,550
You won the bet. Dallas won.

227
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:13,686
l'm not Abe.
You think Abe won a bet from you.

228
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:17,288
-l'm in the clergy.
-Really? What church?

229
00:15:18,258 --> 00:15:20,522
You want to give it
to someone named Abe. l'm not Abe.

230
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:21,955
Holy shit!

231
00:15:22,663 --> 00:15:23,755
That's what l thought.

232
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,329
You think it's me, but--

233
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:27,727
l can't take that money.

234
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:29,061
Abe!

235
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:31,965
This is my best friend, Eddie.
He'll tell you.

236
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:33,935
You want to know about Abe?

237
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,905
You ask me, because
Abe and l are best friends.

238
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:41,748
Not Abe Fielding.
Big joke on me, right?

239
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:44,509
8:00, Shorefront Cafe.
l'll have your money.

240
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:45,980
Abe will be there.

241
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:49,314
He's making a terrible mistake.
He might have a concussion.

242
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:51,889
l hope he has it tonight.

243
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,099
l don't want to do this.

244
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:10,572
Look, the guy wants
to give you money.

245
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:12,677
No, he wants to give
Abe Fielding money.

246
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,077
l'm doing all this for you.
What are you doing for me?

247
00:16:16,283 --> 00:16:18,911
But you want me to lie,
the worst thing l could do.

248
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:22,418
What good is telling the truth
if you got nothing to say?

249
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:25,148
-l have things to say.
-Yeah, about basil.

250
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,725
l know l'm not the most
dynamic person.

251
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:30,419
My ass is more dynamic, okay?

252
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,091
You just be quiet.
Let me do all the talking.

253
00:16:36,303 --> 00:16:39,761
-That way, you ain't lying.
-l'd feel more comfortable like that.

254
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:43,999
Monsieur Fielding!

255
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,872
How good it is to see you!

256
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,273
lt has been too long.

257
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:49,278
lt's been too long.
Since he's eaten!

258
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:50,814
l'll move some people.

259
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:53,483
You a twin or something?

260
00:16:54,454 --> 00:16:56,217
How nice to see you again!

261
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,319
May l take your hat?

262
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,324
How nice!

263
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:06,795
Mr. Fielding! Long time no see.

264
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:10,632
You can at least say hello.

265
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:14,235
-l don't want to lie, Eddie.
-''Hello'' is not a lie.

266
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,636
You don't want to be around
when l lie.

267
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:21,507
All hell breaks loose.
Believe me, l become another person.

268
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:24,741
When l start to lie,
even l don't know who l am.

269
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:28,649
Monsieur Fielding,
how are you this evening?

270
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:33,115
Well, if l were Mr. Fielding...

271
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:35,989
...l guess you could say l was fine.

272
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:39,498
This way, sir.

273
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,791
May l bring the usual?

274
00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:45,199
Two usuals.
You know, we're expecting a friend.

275
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:49,273
A little old fat guy, kind of ugly.
He owes us a lot of money.

276
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:51,273
l think he's at the bar.

277
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,341
Thank you.

278
00:17:59,686 --> 00:18:02,348
Eddie, we have to get out of here.
This is crazy.

279
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:05,320
You think l'm doing this for me?
Don't make me laugh.

280
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:09,086
l'm doing it for Mom.
You know, my mother.

281
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,287
Wish l had a picture to show you.

282
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:13,728
She's got what they call
a heart thing.

283
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:16,596
The doctors, they call it
a bum heart.

284
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:20,364
l was going to use the money
that we get to get it fixed.

285
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:23,042
l'm sorry to hear that.
l'd like to help you.

286
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:26,474
But you know, Eddie,
l told you l mustn't lie.

287
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,548
Okay, forget l asked you.
Just forget it!

288
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:33,413
You can send her flowers
when she's in the hospital.

289
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,884
Nice note saying, ''Die, bitch.''

290
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:40,625
Abe, how are you? l didn't know
you were bringing a friend.

291
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:42,226
l'm Al Sandrow.

292
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,958
So...

293
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:47,927
...not that it's any
of my business, Abe...

294
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:51,104
...where's a guy like you
disappear to for 5 months?

295
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:53,831
That's kind of a long story, Al.

296
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,565
l'm asking Abe.

297
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,643
Something wrong, Abe?

298
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,450
He's worried about my mother.
Mama's at death's door.

299
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:08,417
Listen, shithead,
nobody's talking to you, okay?

300
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,445
Eddie, Eddie.

301
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:12,181
l was just trying to tell you--

302
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:14,986
Don't tell me nothing.
l'm asking Abe!

303
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:17,693
l don't like this.
lt's not polite.

304
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,133
Maybe he can't talk about it,
but l can.

305
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,325
Butt out, shithead!
l'm talking to--

306
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,332
l don't like it
when you call my friend a shithead.

307
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,442
lf you do it one more time,
l'll cut your fucking balls off!

308
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:32,336
Which l'm very good at.

309
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:35,271
-Okay?
-Yeah, sure, Abe.

310
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:36,847
Say ''okay.''

311
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:50,993
-You trying to tell me something?
-No, no! Okay, Abe.

312
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:53,523
l don't want to be unreasonable.

313
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,999
l know you came to give us
thousands of dollars--

314
00:19:57,204 --> 00:19:58,728
Listen to me.

315
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,768
But!

316
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,770
Don't call my friend
a shithead again, okay?

317
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:08,744
Now you can talk!

318
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:10,576
Shithead's okay.

319
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:13,981
Do you have any idea
what this man has done for me?

320
00:20:16,189 --> 00:20:17,816
lt was nothing.

321
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:21,016
Pulling me out of
that explosion was nothing?

322
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:22,058
What explosion?

323
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,662
ln the lift at Lady Tushingham's.

324
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:27,197
Look at him.
Look what it did to his brain.

325
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,561
Did you see that? Look at this.

326
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:32,428
Hello? Anybody home?

327
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,009
Don't worry, he's got
a titanium plate in there.

328
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:40,771
When l hit him in the head,
it actually feels good.

329
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:42,073
What the fuck?

330
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:48,482
Just don't call my friend
a shithead again, okay?

331
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:51,353
-Okay with you, Al?
-Okay with Al.

332
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:55,650
Maybe l had you pegged wrong,
but don't ever call him....

333
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,900
l'm sorry. l didn't know.

334
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:04,093
So what happened in the lift?

335
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,134
What's a lift?

336
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:06,703
What happened in the lift?

337
00:21:07,174 --> 00:21:10,666
Lady Tushingham, you mean?
l'm glad you asked.

338
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:13,710
This is a wonderful story, Al.

339
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,877
l can't wait to tell you.

340
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,916
There we were, Eddie and me,
in England, mind you...

341
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,985
...at this swellegant party--

342
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:25,090
--lords, ladies, everything--

343
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:27,157
--not far from Buckingham Palace.

344
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,763
And Lady Tushingham
walks up to me, and she says:

345
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:34,790
''l challenge you to pull this finger.''

346
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:39,970
''l challenge you...

347
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,230
...to pull this finger.''

348
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:43,636
You say it.

349
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:47,773
''l challenge you to pull this finger.''

350
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:52,012
You're going to love this.

351
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:56,787
What are you going to do?

352
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,515
What do you figure?
What could happen, right?

353
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:01,455
So l pull her finger.

354
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:03,686
She cuts one.

355
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,969
A rocket to Mars doesn't have
this kind of thrust.

356
00:22:11,238 --> 00:22:12,671
And her husband...

357
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,034
...was lighting his cigar
next to her.

358
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,471
The place went crazy!

359
00:22:17,677 --> 00:22:19,611
They weren't calling you
shithead then.

360
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:20,643
Them?

361
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:24,283
They probably were.
lf you want to call me shithead...

362
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:27,510
...and give me some money and say,
''Abe won this.

363
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,985
Here, shithead.''
You know, l'd say...

364
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,214
...''Thank you, Al.''

365
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:35,726
Where the hell have you been?

366
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:37,794
Where have l been?
Where have you been?

367
00:22:37,998 --> 00:22:38,828
That's the question.

368
00:22:39,032 --> 00:22:40,659
Honey, Abe!

369
00:22:41,134 --> 00:22:43,227
Oh, my God!

370
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:47,098
Hey, get your ass over here.
Give me a wet one!

371
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:53,475
This is Fred and Ethel Mertz.

372
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:56,110
Sit down.
Get a load off.

373
00:22:56,316 --> 00:22:59,285
Bartender, some drinks
over here for my friends.

374
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:02,785
-Were you expecting somebody else?
-We were expecting you.

375
00:23:02,989 --> 00:23:06,982
He wanted to start. l said,
''We're waiting till you guys arrive.''

376
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:10,856
So, what did we hear?
That you were in South America?

377
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:12,361
El Salvador.

378
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:15,391
My God, what were you doing there?

379
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,900
Dropping live oxen from 30,000 feet...

380
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:19,901
...on the guerrilla forces.

381
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,271
Live oxen?

382
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:24,234
Why live oxen?

383
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,436
Because it hurts like hell
when they land on you!

384
00:23:29,215 --> 00:23:30,773
He was just kidding about...

385
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:33,976
...dropping oxen from 30,000 feet
out of the plane.

386
00:23:34,187 --> 00:23:35,347
Oh, sure.

387
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:39,114
As if you weren't with me in the
cockpit when the missile went through.

388
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,020
l forgot.

389
00:23:43,229 --> 00:23:44,287
lt slipped my mind.

390
00:23:44,497 --> 00:23:47,125
l can never tell when you're serious.

391
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,872
l'm in a plane...

392
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:56,940
...with a dead pilot...

393
00:23:57,143 --> 00:24:00,476
...and the cockpit thermometer
says 30,000 feet...

394
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,614
...and you think l'm making jokes?

395
00:24:05,118 --> 00:24:06,278
What's the matter with him?

396
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,976
ls he pulling my leg?

397
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:23,999
So what happened to
Lady Tushingham?

398
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:26,936
Will you fuck Lady Tushingham?!

399
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,973
What's the matter with you?
l'm telling you the real stuff!

400
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:32,838
40,000 feet. A terrorist
burst through the door...

401
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:35,344
...put the gun to my head
and he says....

402
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:42,618
How'd you like that, Al?

403
00:24:43,556 --> 00:24:44,682
Holy shit!

404
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:47,485
Do you understand what l'm saying?!

405
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,352
Jesus!

406
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,695
What was l to do?
Then they tore out their knives.

407
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,836
And started swearing--

408
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:33,733
We don't know what
they're saying.

409
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,840
And Eddie says, ''Talk English.''

410
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:38,476
Good thing we didn't
know the language.

411
00:25:38,678 --> 00:25:40,805
''You don't talk English,
we're going home.''

412
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:46,274
That really is an amazing story.

413
00:25:46,986 --> 00:25:51,514
We talked about the money
that Al owed Abe.

414
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:54,784
You know what l mean?
Didn't we talk about that?

415
00:25:54,994 --> 00:25:57,724
We were talking about
all the money...

416
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,890
...that maybe Abe won gambling
from this fat man.

417
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:06,061
l'm not the fat man
like you're not the shithead, okay?

418
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:09,002
l'm not trying to offend,
but l'm not a shithead.

419
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:10,836
But you're definitely pudgy.
What?

420
00:26:11,044 --> 00:26:13,171
Al's a little sensitive
about his tummy.

421
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:15,939
lt's been 20 years since he had a tum--

422
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:17,377
Oh, my God!

423
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,527
lt's ruined.

424
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,793
Abe, it's your wife.

425
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,058
My what?

426
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:36,360
You're right.

427
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:38,031
lt's Elaine!

428
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,272
Eddie, l'm married.

429
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,599
Congratulations.

430
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,503
What am l going to do?

431
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:45,476
You son of a bitch!

432
00:26:48,281 --> 00:26:49,111
Hello, darling.

433
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:51,612
You are not my husband.

434
00:26:52,452 --> 00:26:53,885
l think l could explain--

435
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:57,523
You are an inconsiderate child.

436
00:26:58,024 --> 00:27:00,891
You are an insect.
You are a piece of dust.

437
00:27:01,094 --> 00:27:04,586
How dare you humiliate me this way
in front of our friends.

438
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:09,097
l'm very disappointed in you, Gail.
You could've told me he was back.

439
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,269
l didn't even know he was gone.

440
00:27:11,471 --> 00:27:13,462
Oh, like hell you didn't.

441
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,607
What have you got to say for yourself?

442
00:27:15,808 --> 00:27:17,105
l missed you, dear.

443
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:18,969
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

444
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,840
You've got some explaining to do.

445
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:22,378
The money!

446
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,492
You're the most beautiful woman
l've ever seen.

447
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:40,325
l can't think of a single reason
for us to stay together.

448
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:44,833
l can think of one darn good reason.
How about the kids?

449
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,838
ls it fair to them to make them
the innocent victims of this?

450
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,270
What kids?

451
00:27:50,476 --> 00:27:51,966
We don't have kids?

452
00:27:53,112 --> 00:27:54,010
Bear with me.

453
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,377
l'm a little--
l had a cocktail at the restaurant.

454
00:27:57,584 --> 00:27:57,650
You are really starting
to drive me crazy.

455
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,380
You are really starting
to drive me crazy.

456
00:28:00,587 --> 00:28:04,023
Honestly, l think you've made
an awfully big mistake.

457
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,385
The big mistake was marrying you.

458
00:28:06,593 --> 00:28:09,619
l mean a mistake that
you think l'm someone else...

459
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:11,194
...than who l really am.

460
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:16,061
What you are is a lying bastard.
Get your hand off my knee.

461
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,434
l don't think l lie
that much anymore.

462
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:21,539
l lied a bit tonight,
but l was under a lot of pressure.

463
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,335
Considering that this was
my first night out.

464
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:28,537
Otherwise, l think l've made
a lot of progress. l really do.

465
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:31,007
Just what did you catch this time?

466
00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:33,048
l didn't catch anything.

467
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,916
You went fishing for 5 months
and you didn't catch anything?

468
00:28:37,123 --> 00:28:38,750
l guess l used the wrong bait.

469
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:43,019
Used the wrong bait? Will you please
not insult my intelligence?

470
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:46,721
l happen to know you were with
Angela Davenport the entire time.

471
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,026
Will you close the door, please?

472
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:53,869
And don't deny it.

473
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:57,474
Don't even try, because l got it
right from the horse's mouth.

474
00:28:57,677 --> 00:29:01,408
-You mean Angela told you?
-No, Angela's husband told me.

475
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,081
Oh, gee.

476
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,719
What on earth have you got
in that foolish-looking little bag?

477
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,682
My raincoat and rubbers.

478
00:29:10,556 --> 00:29:12,387
He also told me
when he found you...

479
00:29:12,592 --> 00:29:16,153
...he would cut you up
into infinitesimally small pieces.

480
00:29:16,362 --> 00:29:18,557
Too bad he was bluffing.

481
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:23,833
l've been murdered.

482
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,673
Oh, my God.

483
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,547
Oh, little doggie.

484
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:37,579
Cute little doggie.

485
00:29:39,786 --> 00:29:40,946
Nice doggie.

486
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,047
Yes, sit.

487
00:29:47,393 --> 00:29:48,621
Be a good boy.

488
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:51,827
Nice doggie.

489
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:07,807
Sit! Be a good doggie.

490
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:11,846
l think something terrible
may have happened.

491
00:30:14,387 --> 00:30:15,411
What?

492
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:17,613
l have to--
l have to--

493
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:27,726
l'm honor breast,
to tell you the tittie hooth.

494
00:30:27,934 --> 00:30:30,698
Angela didn't forewarn you
about her implants...

495
00:30:30,903 --> 00:30:31,767
...did she?

496
00:30:32,572 --> 00:30:33,971
Honest truth.

497
00:30:34,173 --> 00:30:38,405
Did you find out in bed?
Or did they rattle when you danced?

498
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:44,379
You know, it's very difficult for me
to be honest with you...

499
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:46,211
...at a time like this.

500
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,352
Give it a whirl, Abe.

501
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:55,456
l like, l want to....

502
00:30:56,929 --> 00:30:58,294
Want to say something to me?

503
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:02,298
Yes. l want to be completely
honest and get this off your chest.

504
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,060
l mean, get this on your breast.

505
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,737
l mean, my breast.

506
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:08,964
-Get this off my chest.
-Well, give it a try.

507
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:12,542
Give it your best shot.
The truth, Abe. Let's hear it.

508
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:19,012
l am not your husband.
l am a Volvo salesman.

509
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:31,463
You are really beginning to fray
the edges of my patience.

510
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:44,902
l've never been to Yosemite.

511
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:14,199
Oh, man.

512
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,337
l'm landing in tall cotton.
Hey, baby!

513
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:21,069
Holy shit, this is great!

514
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,272
They don't have this much acreage
in the projects.

515
00:32:41,968 --> 00:32:43,401
Oh, man!

516
00:32:43,936 --> 00:32:45,528
Are you kidding me?

517
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:48,936
Holy shit!

518
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,102
Kiss my ass!

519
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:03,587
Coochie-coochie?

520
00:33:05,658 --> 00:33:07,057
Come here, little puppy.

521
00:33:08,294 --> 00:33:09,989
Come here.
Suck your dick?

522
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:16,663
ls this 1 1 45 Stone Ranch?

523
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,393
Got some candy for you.

524
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:21,098
Goddamn it, you bit my--

525
00:33:21,307 --> 00:33:22,365
Nice baby.

526
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:24,042
Good fellow.

527
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:33,216
Holy shit!

528
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:45,125
How you doing, Abe?

529
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:47,192
What, you eating breakfast?

530
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,365
Hey, another chair?

531
00:33:50,136 --> 00:33:51,330
This yours?

532
00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:56,374
You don't need this.

533
00:34:22,034 --> 00:34:24,764
-l knew you'd find me.
-Don't touch me, Abe.

534
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:28,668
-Just a little, let me hold your hand.
-Don't touch me!

535
00:34:28,874 --> 00:34:29,704
How did you find me?

536
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:32,469
You're in the phone book
under Abe Fielding.

537
00:34:32,678 --> 00:34:33,838
That was smart!

538
00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:38,074
-Can l call you Abe?
-You know my name is George.

539
00:34:38,484 --> 00:34:40,816
George, right.
Your name is George.

540
00:34:42,054 --> 00:34:43,885
Yo, Abe.
l mean, George.

541
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,651
-How many acres we got here?
-None.

542
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,986
None? lt looks like
more than that to me.

543
00:34:49,195 --> 00:34:52,392
That's because you think
l'm Abe Fielding, but l'm not.

544
00:34:52,598 --> 00:34:54,429
l don't even know Abe Fielding.

545
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:58,934
But l think he was cut up into pieces
by somebody's jealous husband.

546
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,696
What the hell you talking about?

547
00:35:00,906 --> 00:35:04,171
You don't believe me.
l'm not Abe Fielding.

548
00:35:04,377 --> 00:35:06,345
You're at the Pearly Gates.
Don't choose hell.

549
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:07,671
What will you say?

550
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,646
That l don't have a place to stay
and l'm staying with you for a while.

551
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:13,216
Maybe you'll ask her for me.

552
00:35:13,686 --> 00:35:14,778
Hello, dear.

553
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:17,587
Mrs. Honeybun.

554
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,089
Eddie wants to know if he can
live with us for a while.

555
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:24,524
You know, just for a little while.

556
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,722
Till my mom gets better.
Couple years, tops.

557
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,703
No? What do you mean, no?

558
00:35:33,906 --> 00:35:35,134
Come on, Peaches.

559
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:36,964
Peaches?

560
00:35:37,476 --> 00:35:39,876
Abe has something to say.
Just hear him out.

561
00:35:40,546 --> 00:35:41,444
All right.

562
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:43,545
What is it?

563
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:52,617
Eddie isn't who you think he is.

564
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:54,925
Who is he?

565
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:59,761
Did you ever hear of a prizefighter
by the name of Joe Frazier?

566
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:02,828
You mean the ''Thriller from Manila''?

567
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:04,299
That's it.

568
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:05,629
The Thriller from Manila!

569
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:11,571
Right after that fight with Ali in the
Philippines, Joe Frazier got malaria.

570
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,406
And he lost a lot of weight.

571
00:36:16,482 --> 00:36:20,350
l mean, a lot of weight.
He even shrunk a little bit.

572
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:24,122
Even after they got it under control...

573
00:36:24,323 --> 00:36:27,190
...he thought if anyone
ever saw him like that...

574
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,793
...his career as a prizefighter
would be over.

575
00:36:29,995 --> 00:36:32,691
No one would ever give him
a shot at the title.

576
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:37,395
He decided he'd better change
his name and his identity...

577
00:36:37,603 --> 00:36:40,902
...till he could sort of
work his way back into shape.

578
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:43,575
lt's been a rough road back,
right, champ?

579
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:45,004
l'm not complaining.

580
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:47,805
l just want another crack
at the title.

581
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:50,004
Save them.
Save them, pal.

582
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:52,241
l'll help you, Joe.
l mean...

583
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:53,383
...Eddie.

584
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,952
Sorry, champ.
l won't slip again.

585
00:36:57,823 --> 00:36:59,347
You know, Elaine...

586
00:36:59,558 --> 00:37:03,654
...he's the best friend l got.
He just needs a place where he can...

587
00:37:03,863 --> 00:37:06,388
...lick his wounds for a while...

588
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:11,931
...and put about maybe
50, 60 pounds back on.

589
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,979
That is an amazing story.

590
00:37:24,316 --> 00:37:28,184
l was very rude to you a minute ago.
l'm awfully sorry.

591
00:37:28,654 --> 00:37:30,815
l want you to stay.
Really. Please do.

592
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:32,854
l feel so exposed.

593
00:37:33,058 --> 00:37:37,324
Please, let me see if l can get
the guest bedroom made up.

594
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:39,925
l'll be right back.

595
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,360
Shit, man!

596
00:37:49,074 --> 00:37:50,268
Before l met you...

597
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,240
...the term ''bullshit artist''
was an empty phrase.

598
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:56,778
But working with you
has made me a better liar.

599
00:37:57,183 --> 00:38:00,675
You're just describing everything
l don't want to be.

600
00:38:18,037 --> 00:38:20,938
This is a Rolex.
This is money.

601
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,604
Full of rings! My God!

602
00:38:25,544 --> 00:38:28,377
What are you doing in here?
You said you were...

603
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:31,379
...taking a walk.
l was looking all over for you.

604
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:34,144
l was looking around in
some of Fielding's stuff.

605
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,288
l was doing a little research,
you know what l mean?

606
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:40,287
Like this pipe.
You put this pipe in your mouth...

607
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:42,050
...and you'll feel like Fielding.

608
00:38:42,328 --> 00:38:44,489
And a dash of his cologne.

609
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,062
Put on some of this.

610
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:48,495
Smell like Abe.
Before you do the thing.

611
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,032
Before l do what thing?

612
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:52,329
The woman hasn't seen you
in five months.

613
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,664
She's expecting something.

614
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,171
You got to give her
what she expects.

615
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,206
A little padumph, padumph.

616
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:02,774
l can't do ''padumph.''

617
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:06,475
-That would be under false pretenses.
-What false pretenses?

618
00:39:06,685 --> 00:39:09,415
She thinks you're her husband.
She'll turn the TV on.

619
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:19,294
What are you going to say to her?

620
00:39:19,498 --> 00:39:23,298
Well, l'll say, ''Oh, gosh, Elaine.

621
00:39:23,636 --> 00:39:25,968
-You look lovely tonight.''
-Hold it.

622
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:29,868
That's what Boy Scouts say
on a trip, trying to sell cookies.

623
00:39:30,075 --> 00:39:32,873
-l'm not going to be crude.
-Nobody's talking crude.

624
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:35,569
l'm talking you be suave, debonair.

625
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:37,414
You got to be Cary Grant.

626
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:38,583
Cary Grant?

627
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:42,777
What, Cary Grant, on a date, he wants
to do his thing and he says to her....

628
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,117
No, no. l hope not.

629
00:39:45,324 --> 00:39:47,087
No! Cary Grant's smooth, debonair.

630
00:39:47,293 --> 00:39:50,160
He says something like,
''Judy, Judy, Judy...

631
00:39:50,362 --> 00:39:52,023
...you want to padumph, padumph?''

632
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:53,926
That's what he would say?

633
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:56,397
Either that or,
''You want to fuck?''

634
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:01,497
-This is your night.
-l can't do it.

635
00:40:01,707 --> 00:40:03,402
Let's see.

636
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,043
-l'm nervous.
-This woman has a thing for you.

637
00:40:06,245 --> 00:40:07,872
l saw it in her eyes.

638
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,071
Put some of this on.
There you go.

639
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:12,011
Not bad, is it?

640
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:13,507
Look.

641
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:17,815
You go in there
and you think ''Cary Grant.''

642
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:20,250
-Come on.
-Judy, Judy.

643
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:29,229
Man couldn't get laid in
a woman's prison with a pound of pot.

644
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:32,666
AII right, girIs.
Now, this is your Iast chance.

645
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:35,669
If one piece of candy
gets past you...

646
00:40:35,874 --> 00:40:39,332
...and into the packing room
unwrapped, you're fired!

647
00:40:39,878 --> 00:40:42,346
-Let her roII!
-What are you doing?

648
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:44,845
Judy, Judy.

649
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:48,109
Could l interest you
in a little padumph, padumph?

650
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,288
Who are you talking to?

651
00:40:52,591 --> 00:40:53,853
You.

652
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:57,585
l want to know if you'd like
to have a little padumph.

653
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,194
Elaine, do you know how long
it's been since l've done the thing?

654
00:41:04,403 --> 00:41:05,631
Are you for real?

655
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:07,763
You--

656
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,372
Who could that be?

657
00:41:14,713 --> 00:41:17,409
Look, Abe, there's a car
coming up the driveway.

658
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:21,245
l don't know who else but you'd
come barreling up at this hour.

659
00:41:21,754 --> 00:41:24,188
My God. lt must be Abe.

660
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,790
Will you please not do that anymore?

661
00:41:26,992 --> 00:41:29,426
l'm sorry.
l mean it must be me.

662
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:38,866
Would you go see who it is?
l'll be down in a minute.

663
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,452
There's someone at the front door.

664
00:41:55,654 --> 00:41:56,746
So?

665
00:41:57,623 --> 00:41:59,488
l'd like you to come with me.

666
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,618
What's this stuff?

667
00:42:02,828 --> 00:42:05,160
This is stuff that
l'm taking to get cleaned.

668
00:42:05,364 --> 00:42:08,265
Yeah, looks pretty dirty.

669
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,180
l'd like you to answer it.
Would you?

670
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,112
Hey, you're the maestro.

671
00:42:34,393 --> 00:42:35,223
Well!

672
00:42:35,461 --> 00:42:38,225
lf it ain't Mr. ''Finger on the Bell.''

673
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,422
How dare you!
Open this door. Open it!

674
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:43,857
Just who the hell are you?

675
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:46,902
l demand to know, and l mean now,
mister. Right now!

676
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,300
Who the hell are you?

677
00:42:49,341 --> 00:42:50,831
Elaine, you all right?

678
00:42:51,043 --> 00:42:55,036
l'm Abe Fielding's
best friend, asshole.

679
00:42:55,247 --> 00:42:58,444
You think you can come in
and talk to me like l'm shit?

680
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:01,778
You wouldn't know Abe Fielding
if you were talking to him.

681
00:43:01,987 --> 00:43:03,079
Wait a minute. You Abe Fielding?

682
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:04,755
No, l'm not. Elaine!

683
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,859
My name is Rupert Dibbs.
l run Abe Fielding's business.

684
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:10,193
Dibbsy!

685
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:11,956
Abe?

686
00:43:12,397 --> 00:43:15,195
You old duffer! How's the boy?

687
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,526
My God, you're back!

688
00:43:16,735 --> 00:43:18,862
Long time no see, pal.

689
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:21,835
l bet you thought
that was Fielding for a while.

690
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,507
lt's kind of dark in here.

691
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:26,542
You know how l knew
it wasn't Abe Fielding?

692
00:43:26,745 --> 00:43:29,077
Because l'm Abe Fielding!

693
00:43:29,615 --> 00:43:30,707
Remember?

694
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:33,281
-How you doing, you old duffer?
-Fine!

695
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:35,111
Hey, Dibbsy.

696
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,344
-Give me a wet one.
-A what?

697
00:43:36,555 --> 00:43:37,852
Come on, come on!

698
00:43:40,926 --> 00:43:43,451
-Have you lost your mind?
-Look at that tie.

699
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,425
Not even a phone call in 5 months.

700
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:47,462
l'm not saying you didn't deserve--

701
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:49,356
Everybody deserves a vacation.

702
00:43:49,568 --> 00:43:51,593
No lectures, no lectures.

703
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:54,569
But how am l supposed to run
a business--

704
00:43:54,773 --> 00:43:57,071
-Brandy still your drink?
-l don't drink.

705
00:43:57,276 --> 00:43:59,005
Still can't get him to drink.

706
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:01,236
-This is my best friend, Eddie.
-Elaine!

707
00:44:01,446 --> 00:44:02,913
-No, Eddie.
-Rupert.

708
00:44:03,115 --> 00:44:05,913
-What are you doing here?
-l have some papers...

709
00:44:06,118 --> 00:44:09,246
...that need power of attorney.
But you can sign them.

710
00:44:09,454 --> 00:44:11,081
l just need your signature.

711
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:12,951
-You want my ''Fielding''?
-Sure.

712
00:44:13,158 --> 00:44:16,491
-You bet!
-l want it right there, and there.

713
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:18,760
How are you fixed for cash?

714
00:44:19,598 --> 00:44:20,587
We're a little short.

715
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:23,762
-We?
-We got some things to do downtown.

716
00:44:24,603 --> 00:44:26,161
l understand.

717
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:29,605
There you go.
l think that should take care of it.

718
00:44:30,676 --> 00:44:34,442
Abe, why don't you tell him
about the credit cards you lost?

719
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:39,615
-l don't know what l did with them.
-This should take care of that.

720
00:44:39,818 --> 00:44:41,615
Look at that!
Dibbsy to the rescue.

721
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,788
Just like the old days.
What a guy!

722
00:44:44,189 --> 00:44:45,554
Looking in the pink.

723
00:44:45,757 --> 00:44:48,920
-That's my color, pal.
-You back for a while?

724
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:51,459
You better ask the little lady
about that.

725
00:44:51,663 --> 00:44:53,858
Going to be sticking
around for a while.

726
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:57,229
Credit cards. Money!

727
00:44:57,703 --> 00:44:59,136
Pussy!

728
00:44:59,471 --> 00:45:01,962
-You bet your boots.
-Elaine, you look great.

729
00:45:02,174 --> 00:45:03,698
l'll see you soon, Abe.

730
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,002
-Welcome home.
-Nice to see you again.

731
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:08,971
lt was a pleasure.
Maybe l'll see you again.

732
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:11,445
You can bank on it.

733
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,783
Who is that bum?
Why don't you get rid of him?

734
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,025
You know, Dibbsy,
you're my business manager...

735
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:24,059
...and l respect you for that...

736
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:27,790
...but don't ever call my friend
a shithead again!

737
00:45:28,033 --> 00:45:29,364
l said no such thi--

738
00:45:30,469 --> 00:45:31,697
Okay?

739
00:45:35,874 --> 00:45:38,001
Okay, good night.

740
00:45:38,443 --> 00:45:39,740
See you soon.

741
00:45:41,346 --> 00:45:43,109
Hey, Dibbsy!

742
00:45:47,052 --> 00:45:51,079
-Ready to turn in, sweetheart?
-That was so rude!

743
00:45:51,356 --> 00:45:52,823
What do you mean?

744
00:45:53,025 --> 00:45:56,324
l can't believe you'd talk
to Rupert that way.

745
00:45:56,528 --> 00:46:00,259
-After everything he's done for you!
-l didn't mean to be rude.

746
00:46:00,465 --> 00:46:02,956
-l was just--
-Stop. Don't try and explain.

747
00:46:03,168 --> 00:46:06,001
l'm going to bed alone.

748
00:46:44,509 --> 00:46:45,567
What?

749
00:46:46,478 --> 00:46:48,446
Can l say just one thing to you?

750
00:46:48,647 --> 00:46:51,115
-What?
-Goodbye forever, dear.

751
00:46:56,421 --> 00:46:59,322
-Where are you going?
-l can't stay in this house.

752
00:46:59,524 --> 00:47:01,151
l mustn't be here alone with you.

753
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,351
What's the problem?
Eddie's coming back.

754
00:47:03,562 --> 00:47:04,586
-Look at me!
-l can't.

755
00:47:04,796 --> 00:47:07,026
lf l do, l'm a goner.
l'll never leave.

756
00:47:07,232 --> 00:47:09,723
You remind me of a girl
l was in love with.

757
00:47:09,935 --> 00:47:11,903
l thought l was in love
till l met you.

758
00:47:12,104 --> 00:47:14,436
l got her to love me by lying,
and l must not!

759
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,540
-l mustn't do that again!
-Look at me!

760
00:47:17,743 --> 00:47:19,836
-Are you leaving me?
-l'm not Abe!

761
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,036
l'm not married to you!
l'm George!

762
00:47:22,247 --> 00:47:24,511
l'm a Volvo salesman
for Horst Mueller!

763
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,278
Look at me!

764
00:47:26,485 --> 00:47:27,577
-Taxi!
-Wait, wait.

765
00:47:28,353 --> 00:47:29,786
Just give me a kiss goodbye.

766
00:47:29,988 --> 00:47:32,286
-A kiss?
-One little kiss.

767
00:47:38,463 --> 00:47:39,452
Taxi!

768
00:47:44,436 --> 00:47:48,167
George, if what you say is true,
l find that admirable.

769
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,931
You were honest with her.

770
00:47:50,142 --> 00:47:52,906
You left the woman you loved
rather than lie to her.

771
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:54,476
How do you feel?

772
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:55,839
Who took my red?

773
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:57,207
l'm asking you--

774
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,976
l'll answer you,
but who took my red?

775
00:48:04,589 --> 00:48:09,185
l can't believe l had the red at
the exact moment that you wanted it.

776
00:48:10,395 --> 00:48:11,453
l should be stripped...

777
00:48:11,663 --> 00:48:15,565
...and have scalding soup ladled
over my genitals by Dolly Parton.

778
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,667
Philip, put a clam on it, will you?

779
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:18,858
Sorry.

780
00:48:19,371 --> 00:48:22,807
George, how does it feel
to be an honest person?

781
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,739
Where's my green?

782
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,741
Did you pump up your mickey
before you showed it to her?

783
00:48:28,013 --> 00:48:28,980
Who has the green?

784
00:48:29,181 --> 00:48:33,515
Sometimes a patient's first day away
from the clinic can be stressful.

785
00:48:33,718 --> 00:48:36,152
ls it possible
there was no Mrs. Fielding?

786
00:48:36,354 --> 00:48:37,719
Wait a minute!

787
00:48:37,923 --> 00:48:41,689
Maybe he is Abe Fielding,
and he was lying to us about that too.

788
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,593
What do you think?

789
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,863
Just a theory.

790
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,532
Poor Mrs. Fielding.

791
00:48:49,734 --> 00:48:51,167
l bet she's crying her eyes out.

792
00:48:57,342 --> 00:48:59,173
That's enough. Stop it!

793
00:48:59,377 --> 00:49:03,643
l'm not saying that you don't have
some limited acting ability.

794
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:08,479
Limited acting ability?
Listen, bud, these are real tears here.

795
00:49:08,687 --> 00:49:12,748
When l hired you, you told me
you were a professional actress.

796
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:14,425
l am! Sort of.

797
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:19,222
All right, l'm basically a vocalist,
but l am studying acting.

798
00:49:19,431 --> 00:49:23,060
l'm told by my teacher
that l'm remarkably naturalistic.

799
00:49:23,268 --> 00:49:26,760
That's not quite what you told me
two Abe Fieldings ago, is it?

800
00:49:26,972 --> 00:49:29,941
Excuse me, they both believed
l was Mrs. Abe Fielding.

801
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:34,407
And let me also add this.
l think that my accent was impeccable.

802
00:49:34,613 --> 00:49:38,105
Despite your impeccable accent,
they both chose to leave.

803
00:49:38,316 --> 00:49:39,943
That's not my fault.

804
00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:43,814
You can't take any nut and
convince him he's Abe Fielding.

805
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,421
That was not the job!

806
00:49:45,624 --> 00:49:48,354
l don't care if they think
they are Abe Fielding.

807
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,394
The job was simply to entice him.

808
00:49:52,597 --> 00:49:57,000
To make them want to be Abe Fielding.
But they're running from you.

809
00:49:57,202 --> 00:50:00,000
l will not be handled.

810
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,833
l told you that when l took the job.

811
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:06,101
And if that's changed,
l don't want the job anyway.

812
00:50:06,311 --> 00:50:07,608
Well, that is just fine!

813
00:50:07,812 --> 00:50:10,713
Give my regards to
the unemployment office...

814
00:50:10,916 --> 00:50:13,646
...Miss Mimi Kravitz,
''professional actress.''

815
00:50:13,852 --> 00:50:16,116
You'll be spending
a lot of time there.

816
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:22,255
You've got an unerring instinct
for the jugular.

817
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,553
l'd like that last Fielding back.

818
00:50:24,763 --> 00:50:26,492
The liar.

819
00:50:26,698 --> 00:50:28,165
The liar is perfect.

820
00:50:28,366 --> 00:50:32,962
Not him. Come on,
l felt kind of sorry for that guy.

821
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:35,639
Why on earth would you
feel sorry for him?

822
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,139
Nothing bad will happen to him.
Would you like a cappuccino?

823
00:50:39,344 --> 00:50:42,507
All right.
But not that poor chump.

824
00:50:42,714 --> 00:50:44,477
l think he was a little soft on me.

825
00:50:44,683 --> 00:50:46,412
Why wouldn't he be soft on you?

826
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:48,182
You're a beautiful girl.

827
00:50:50,956 --> 00:50:51,786
Sit down.

828
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:03,189
What say you take another crack
at that role?

829
00:51:03,401 --> 00:51:05,369
He won't come back
without his friend.

830
00:51:05,971 --> 00:51:07,268
Don't worry about him.

831
00:51:07,472 --> 00:51:09,269
His friend is mine for bail money.

832
00:51:09,474 --> 00:51:10,532
He's in jail?

833
00:51:10,742 --> 00:51:11,766
l had him arrested.

834
00:51:11,977 --> 00:51:14,138
The schmuck stole Abe's credit cards.

835
00:51:14,346 --> 00:51:14,379
Bail money? You want me to work
your rinky-dink scam for bail money?

836
00:51:14,379 --> 00:51:18,713
Bail money? You want me to work
your rinky-dink scam for bail money?

837
00:51:19,684 --> 00:51:22,278
No one is trying
to get you to run anything.

838
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:26,145
l just want you to bring
your friend back for one week.

839
00:51:26,358 --> 00:51:30,886
Unless you want to stay in here,
l suggest you do as l ask.

840
00:51:31,096 --> 00:51:34,122
Tell me, is this a sink or a toilet?

841
00:51:34,332 --> 00:51:35,924
Stick your head in and find out.

842
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:39,900
Let me explain something.
l don't work with amateurs.

843
00:51:40,105 --> 00:51:41,663
Like singers and actors.

844
00:51:41,873 --> 00:51:45,001
There's only one singer involved,
and that's Mimi Kravitz.

845
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:48,304
The rest of these people
happen to be damn fine actors.

846
00:51:48,513 --> 00:51:49,980
l cast them myself.

847
00:51:50,515 --> 00:51:54,542
That's Jerome Handy as ''Al the Bookie.''

848
00:51:54,753 --> 00:51:59,247
Did you see his Man of La Mancha
last season at the Pasadena Playhouse?

849
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:00,819
l'm afraid l missed that.

850
00:52:01,026 --> 00:52:02,891
lt was super.

851
00:52:03,094 --> 00:52:06,222
You've never run a professional scam
in your life, have you?

852
00:52:06,431 --> 00:52:10,731
No, of course not.
l'm a legitimate businessman.

853
00:52:10,935 --> 00:52:12,527
l run Abe's business.

854
00:52:12,737 --> 00:52:13,829
l thought so.

855
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:17,372
A professional would
never use amateurs.

856
00:52:17,575 --> 00:52:18,906
They crack out of turn.

857
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,771
l don't know what that means.

858
00:52:21,046 --> 00:52:23,537
lt means that
l'm a professional con man.

859
00:52:23,748 --> 00:52:26,512
This is what l do for a living.

860
00:52:26,718 --> 00:52:29,346
What you got here
is not a professional con.

861
00:52:29,587 --> 00:52:30,884
What l got here...

862
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,819
...is $1 0,000.

863
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:38,528
And it's for you if you just bring
your friend back for one week.

864
00:52:39,864 --> 00:52:41,388
You have to tell me more.

865
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,089
l will, in due time--

866
00:52:43,301 --> 00:52:44,893
Excuse me!

867
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,835
Oh, please!

868
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,171
Just take five grand now
as a down payment, okay?

869
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,278
l don't usually work with amateurs.

870
00:52:57,816 --> 00:53:00,478
But you've caught me
at the right time.

871
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,423
-Wish me luck!
-Wait a minute.

872
00:53:08,626 --> 00:53:09,490
What?

873
00:53:09,694 --> 00:53:12,686
Nothing. l've just got to
pave the way for you.

874
00:53:12,897 --> 00:53:16,355
-What do you mean?
-l talked to a psychiatrist.

875
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:20,368
You've got to take it slow
and easy with this ''George'' shit.

876
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,904
She still thinks you're Abe.

877
00:53:23,808 --> 00:53:25,605
All right? She's in denial.

878
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:30,179
She's got what they call,
medically speaking, a bum head.

879
00:53:30,882 --> 00:53:32,281
Oh, dear!

880
00:53:32,484 --> 00:53:36,511
After l talk to her,
you can come up and do your stuff, okay?

881
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:38,747
Don't be long.

882
00:53:43,128 --> 00:53:45,028
Am l interrupting?

883
00:53:45,897 --> 00:53:47,660
lt's the ''Thriller from Manila!''

884
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:49,565
That's me.

885
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,897
Fourteen rounds, you know.

886
00:53:54,506 --> 00:53:56,531
l was scared to go fifteen.

887
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:58,974
Did Dibbs tell you l'm in?

888
00:53:59,177 --> 00:54:01,509
Yes, he told me.

889
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,879
Zeppo, could you leave us
for a minute?

890
00:54:06,084 --> 00:54:07,881
Yeah, l'll take over from here.

891
00:54:09,487 --> 00:54:10,385
What do you want?

892
00:54:10,588 --> 00:54:13,352
To tell you l think
the guy's in love with you.

893
00:54:13,558 --> 00:54:14,650
He's downstairs.

894
00:54:29,073 --> 00:54:31,701
Hey, Duane, give the man a break!

895
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,002
Come on.

896
00:54:33,878 --> 00:54:36,711
l'll let you hump my leg.
Come on, baby.

897
00:54:36,915 --> 00:54:39,008
lt's all right.
You can come out now.

898
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,351
Good boy!

899
00:54:45,456 --> 00:54:47,356
Guess who's here?

900
00:54:48,526 --> 00:54:50,153
Honey!

901
00:54:50,562 --> 00:54:51,927
l'm home!

902
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:54,863
And l'm ready for love!

903
00:54:56,801 --> 00:54:59,429
Honey, it's me.

904
00:55:01,573 --> 00:55:05,031
Remember me from in the car
downstairs a little while ago?

905
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:08,468
l made a joke, Eddie.
Am l interrupting something?

906
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,649
No, we're just talking and--
Never mind.

907
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,216
You two keep talking.
Get together.

908
00:55:14,419 --> 00:55:16,046
-See you later.
-You're damn right.

909
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:24,093
So, long time no see.

910
00:55:24,295 --> 00:55:25,660
What are you doing here?

911
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,594
l brought you some candy
and some flowers...

912
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,064
...and to tell you
that you and l had something.

913
00:55:31,269 --> 00:55:33,897
l saw it in your eyes,
and Eddie saw it too.

914
00:55:34,105 --> 00:55:34,969
Don't deny it.

915
00:55:35,173 --> 00:55:37,334
What are you saying?
That you'd like to stay?

916
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:40,375
Would l like to stay here with you?

917
00:55:40,578 --> 00:55:42,603
Are you kidding?

918
00:55:44,315 --> 00:55:46,476
lf l could stay here with you,
l'd climb--

919
00:55:46,684 --> 00:55:48,743
l would swim--

920
00:55:48,953 --> 00:55:50,818
l would make myself into a--

921
00:55:51,022 --> 00:55:52,990
l would stay forever if you'd let me.

922
00:55:53,191 --> 00:55:55,751
Let's just see if we can
get along, okay, doll?

923
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,018
For a week or so.

924
00:55:57,228 --> 00:56:00,994
l want much more than that.
l want to know all about you.

925
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:03,497
l'd like you to know
all about me too.

926
00:56:03,701 --> 00:56:06,932
We might just find out
we have a lot in common.

927
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:09,435
What could we have in common?

928
00:56:10,808 --> 00:56:14,835
-l love basil. You like basil?
-lt doesn't sweep me off my feet.

929
00:56:15,046 --> 00:56:17,071
My favorite color's brown.

930
00:56:17,282 --> 00:56:19,273
l get Reader's Digest.
l love yodeling.

931
00:56:19,484 --> 00:56:22,817
My favorite food is
Wiener schnitzel.

932
00:56:23,021 --> 00:56:24,750
Do you like Wiener schnitzel?

933
00:56:24,956 --> 00:56:25,923
You do!

934
00:56:26,124 --> 00:56:28,251
l hit a bone! l hit a nerve!

935
00:56:28,459 --> 00:56:30,689
l hit something.
l can see it in your eyes.

936
00:56:30,895 --> 00:56:33,955
l'm going to win you over.
l'm going to romance you.

937
00:56:34,165 --> 00:56:35,962
l'll wine you and l'll dine you.

938
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:40,297
One day, you're going to feel about me
the way l feel about you.

939
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,214
You look really familiar.

940
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,178
How you doing, legs?

941
00:56:57,588 --> 00:56:58,885
The name is Gloria...

942
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,114
...not ''legs.''

943
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,781
You!

944
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,557
l've been dreaming about you.

945
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:04,625
Why are you here?

946
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:07,855
l'm here to see Dibbs.
l got an important appointment.

947
00:57:08,566 --> 00:57:09,533
Yeah, right.

948
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:12,967
This report--

949
00:57:14,939 --> 00:57:15,837
How's the boy?

950
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,133
l'm glad you could make it.
This can wait.

951
00:57:18,343 --> 00:57:20,038
Ever been to a brewery before?

952
00:57:20,244 --> 00:57:21,438
How about a little tour?

953
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:24,843
That'd be great.
Listen, you busy Saturday night?

954
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,411
Maybe, maybe not.

955
00:57:28,953 --> 00:57:30,420
That's nice.
l like that.

956
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:32,486
l'll see you Saturday night, okay?

957
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,988
-You paying?
-That's cute.

958
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,786
Fine thing.

959
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:45,129
When Abe Fielding, Sr., died, everyone
assumed l'd inherit the brewery.

960
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,826
lt turns out he has a son.

961
00:57:47,038 --> 00:57:49,097
-Can we talk about Gloria?
-Later.

962
00:57:49,307 --> 00:57:50,501
So as l was saying...

963
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:54,144
...we finally track down
this Abe Jr. 1 0 minutes after...

964
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,973
...an ugly accident during
a Dance of Death.

965
00:57:57,181 --> 00:57:58,876
The guy had gone off to Tibet.

966
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:01,677
-Could we talk about Gloria?
-Do you mind?

967
00:58:01,886 --> 00:58:04,946
Anyway, the only way to keep
the estate out of probate...

968
00:58:05,156 --> 00:58:07,647
...was to convince someone
to be Abe Jr.

969
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,419
We found George in the loony bin.
A liar. Get it?

970
00:58:10,628 --> 00:58:14,496
We doctored up a photo, hired a
couple of actors, and here we are.

971
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,633
Does she always look that good?

972
00:58:16,834 --> 00:58:20,861
Sorry, I think I'II find out
for myseIf Saturday night.

973
00:58:45,596 --> 00:58:47,860
Maybe we could go
and do a little padumph.

974
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,556
-Padumph?
-Yeah.

975
00:58:50,201 --> 00:58:53,136
-l've done that before.
-l think you'll enjoy it.

976
00:58:57,809 --> 00:58:59,140
See that guy over there?

977
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,474
He's one of the best sax players
l've ever heard.

978
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,738
What's his name?

979
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:10,019
Eddie Dash, right?

980
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,752
Yeah, amazing.

981
00:59:16,828 --> 00:59:18,159
Ladies and gentlemen...

982
00:59:18,663 --> 00:59:21,257
...we have someone very special
here tonight.

983
00:59:21,466 --> 00:59:24,435
One of the greatest
sax players around.

984
00:59:24,635 --> 00:59:27,229
The one and only Mr. Eddie Dash!

985
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:34,809
They got the wrong--

986
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:36,036
Come on, man.

987
00:59:36,647 --> 00:59:37,841
Oh, God, no!

988
00:59:43,521 --> 00:59:44,510
Just go.

989
00:59:44,722 --> 00:59:46,189
Just go?

990
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,262
What will it be?

991
00:59:59,937 --> 01:00:01,598
lt really doesn't matter.

992
01:00:02,406 --> 01:00:03,668
The guy's a pro.

993
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:47,008
lt's interpretation.

994
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:51,388
Everybody!

995
01:01:04,135 --> 01:01:05,227
Oh, my God.

996
01:01:19,817 --> 01:01:21,216
You know a lot of people here.

997
01:01:21,419 --> 01:01:23,580
l used to come here all the time.

998
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:26,517
This is us, honey.

999
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,089
This is your table.

1000
01:01:34,498 --> 01:01:36,796
Would you excuse me for a minute?

1001
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,066
Here's the music.

1002
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,440
Good evening, honey.

1003
01:01:58,756 --> 01:01:59,654
You know...

1004
01:02:00,691 --> 01:02:02,716
...as we look towards the east...

1005
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,758
...and see a united DeutschIand...

1006
01:02:04,962 --> 01:02:07,192
...it behooves us to stop and think...

1007
01:02:07,398 --> 01:02:09,332
...about what walls can do.

1008
01:02:09,533 --> 01:02:11,660
Walls between nations.

1009
01:02:13,004 --> 01:02:14,904
Walls between peoples.

1010
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:20,704
Walls between you and me, Elaine.

1011
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,313
But if that darned wall
in Berlin town can come down...

1012
01:02:26,517 --> 01:02:28,508
...then maybe it's not
too much to expect...

1013
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:31,517
...the wall between us
to come down too.

1014
01:02:31,722 --> 01:02:32,984
Who knows?

1015
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:34,817
Maybe it just takes a dance.

1016
01:02:35,893 --> 01:02:36,723
Or a glance.

1017
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:40,319
Or a chance...

1018
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:43,866
...to sing a song.

1019
01:02:44,835 --> 01:02:46,166
l call this...

1020
01:02:47,171 --> 01:02:48,138
...''Yodelaine.''

1021
01:02:51,409 --> 01:02:52,967
Get off the stage!

1022
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,374
Yo-deI...

1023
01:02:59,617 --> 01:03:00,879
...EIaine

1024
01:03:01,085 --> 01:03:03,212
My heart's afIame

1025
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,926
YodeIaine

1026
01:03:10,127 --> 01:03:12,027
I'm not insane

1027
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,738
YodeIaine

1028
01:03:23,274 --> 01:03:25,037
You screwed my brain

1029
01:03:30,114 --> 01:03:31,877
My EIaine

1030
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:33,508
I Iove you

1031
01:03:57,608 --> 01:03:59,166
Oh, my God!

1032
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,803
lt's Mimi Kravitz!

1033
01:04:38,315 --> 01:04:40,647
Don't tell anybody about this.

1034
01:04:56,867 --> 01:04:58,630
I'm in the mood for Iove

1035
01:04:58,836 --> 01:04:59,666
Damn!

1036
01:05:13,417 --> 01:05:15,612
Hey, what are you doing up there?

1037
01:05:16,487 --> 01:05:17,954
l know you're
in the swing of things...

1038
01:05:18,155 --> 01:05:20,020
...but we got business
to take care of.

1039
01:05:20,224 --> 01:05:21,054
What business?

1040
01:05:21,258 --> 01:05:24,386
We got to check him into the dentist
as Abe Fielding.

1041
01:05:24,595 --> 01:05:27,564
-Why?
-Dibbs wants to see his dental charts.

1042
01:05:36,674 --> 01:05:36,740
Mr. Fielding?

1043
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:37,866
Mr. Fielding?

1044
01:05:38,075 --> 01:05:40,441
Are you still feeling the effects?

1045
01:05:40,644 --> 01:05:43,112
Can you say something, Mr. Fielding?

1046
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,781
Don't call...

1047
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:46,643
...my friend a shithead.

1048
01:05:48,285 --> 01:05:49,809
Of course he has.

1049
01:05:50,554 --> 01:05:51,680
Well, okay.

1050
01:05:52,089 --> 01:05:53,818
Now, Mr. Fielding...

1051
01:05:54,725 --> 01:05:56,784
...you just have one cavity.

1052
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:59,827
So all you will hear
is the sound of the drill.

1053
01:06:02,433 --> 01:06:03,593
Tragic.

1054
01:06:04,401 --> 01:06:05,698
Were there any survivors?

1055
01:06:05,903 --> 01:06:08,064
No one. The thing blew up!

1056
01:06:08,272 --> 01:06:09,170
How awful.

1057
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:13,972
Says here that the bodies were
charred beyond recognition.

1058
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:15,372
Oh, my God!

1059
01:06:16,914 --> 01:06:19,041
At least they'll know
who they're burying.

1060
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,081
How will they know?

1061
01:06:21,285 --> 01:06:25,449
From the dental records.
They'll check the dental records.

1062
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:27,482
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1063
01:06:36,433 --> 01:06:38,458
Abe Fielding.
What cubicle is he in?

1064
01:06:38,669 --> 01:06:40,364
-Who?
-You don't know him?

1065
01:06:41,705 --> 01:06:43,070
lt's not what you think.

1066
01:06:43,274 --> 01:06:45,504
Then why does Dibbs want
the dental charts?

1067
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:46,835
l'll make a deal with George.

1068
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:51,037
He'll hang out till the end of the week,
and then l get my money.

1069
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,211
But getting killed
was not part of the deal.

1070
01:06:59,423 --> 01:07:02,153
Dibbs would never kill anyone.
lt's not in him.

1071
01:07:04,495 --> 01:07:05,359
Excuse me.

1072
01:07:07,965 --> 01:07:10,263
Sweetheart, we're getting
out of here.

1073
01:07:11,135 --> 01:07:12,159
We got to go.

1074
01:07:13,971 --> 01:07:15,871
Dibbs wants you dead, all right?

1075
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:17,506
Get this.
Listen carefully.

1076
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:19,175
He wants you dead...

1077
01:07:19,376 --> 01:07:23,335
...so he can bury you as Fielding
and inherit the company.

1078
01:07:28,185 --> 01:07:29,846
You must all leave!

1079
01:07:30,621 --> 01:07:32,213
No, she leaves...

1080
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:34,186
...l leave, he stays.

1081
01:07:34,391 --> 01:07:37,690
No, no. l leave,
you leave, he leaves.

1082
01:07:37,895 --> 01:07:39,624
No, he must stay!

1083
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:41,024
He has a cavity.

1084
01:07:41,532 --> 01:07:42,521
You leave!

1085
01:07:44,768 --> 01:07:46,235
Show us the cavity.

1086
01:07:54,745 --> 01:07:57,145
Oh, you got a rise,
Mr. Fielding!

1087
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:00,380
Ride 'em, cowboy!

1088
01:08:04,888 --> 01:08:06,549
Of all the gall!

1089
01:08:08,859 --> 01:08:12,625
Did l ever say that anything bad
was going to happen to him?

1090
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:16,129
You never said it to me.
He never said it to me.

1091
01:08:16,834 --> 01:08:19,860
Why did we take him to all
those doctors and dentists?

1092
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:20,900
Wait a minute.

1093
01:08:21,105 --> 01:08:23,801
lt was to establish that he was
Abe Fielding, right?

1094
01:08:24,008 --> 01:08:26,374
Yes, that is right.
And that is because...

1095
01:08:26,577 --> 01:08:29,637
...there are certain financial
transactions l can't make...

1096
01:08:29,847 --> 01:08:32,281
-...unless Abe Fielding is alive.
-He's right.

1097
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:34,747
l want to tell you something.

1098
01:08:34,952 --> 01:08:36,078
Quite frankly, l expected...

1099
01:08:36,286 --> 01:08:38,447
...more support out of you,
more gratitude.

1100
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:41,955
For the money l'm paying,
l could've hired a real actress.

1101
01:08:42,226 --> 01:08:43,659
That's it.
That's the button.

1102
01:08:43,861 --> 01:08:46,022
You pushed it.
l'm out of here! Sayonara!

1103
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:48,323
-l'm going back to my old job.
-What's that?

1104
01:08:48,532 --> 01:08:51,865
Yodeling in a hillbilly nightclub?
Just what does that pay?

1105
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:54,594
The man is just
trying to reassure you.

1106
01:08:54,805 --> 01:08:55,897
By the way...

1107
01:08:56,106 --> 01:08:58,597
...what business is it of yours
what happens to him?

1108
01:08:59,076 --> 01:09:00,839
l'm making it my business, okay?

1109
01:09:02,046 --> 01:09:04,879
Have we fallen in love
with the lunatic?

1110
01:09:05,149 --> 01:09:08,016
No, the lady's not
in love with him.

1111
01:09:08,218 --> 01:09:10,948
She don't want to get involved
in a murder rap thing.

1112
01:09:11,155 --> 01:09:12,019
Murder.

1113
01:09:12,589 --> 01:09:13,749
Wait for me in the car.

1114
01:09:13,957 --> 01:09:17,017
You got his guarantee that
there ain't going to be no hit.

1115
01:09:17,227 --> 01:09:18,660
There better not be.

1116
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,865
Actresses, you know.

1117
01:09:25,069 --> 01:09:27,162
Can't live with them
and can't kill them.

1118
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:29,202
Everything's okay, right?

1119
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,265
l mean, it looks cool to me.

1120
01:09:31,475 --> 01:09:33,067
Well, not quite.

1121
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:34,634
Sit down.

1122
01:09:37,781 --> 01:09:40,341
There's one more thing
l need you to do.

1123
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,850
-Yeah, what?
-l need you to dispose of the lunatic.

1124
01:09:45,122 --> 01:09:46,248
lce George?

1125
01:09:47,825 --> 01:09:49,816
l need Abe Fielding
dead and buried.

1126
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:53,219
lce George.

1127
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:58,265
Now, please. Don't tell me that
you're above this sort of thing.

1128
01:09:59,169 --> 01:10:03,162
l never iced anyone in my life.
l'm a con man, not a hit man.

1129
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:06,471
l think you have
two qualities that are--

1130
01:10:06,677 --> 01:10:07,871
Don't touch me.

1131
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:09,936
First, you love money.

1132
01:10:10,647 --> 01:10:11,807
And second...

1133
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:15,746
...you have absolutely no
moral character. What do you say?

1134
01:10:21,892 --> 01:10:24,690
-How much money we talking?
-Name your price.

1135
01:10:24,895 --> 01:10:25,725
Look, Eddie.

1136
01:10:27,397 --> 01:10:29,695
Write down any figure
you consider reasonable.

1137
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,267
l'll pay you that amount in cash.
Go on, knock yourself out.

1138
01:10:42,146 --> 01:10:43,875
Come on, we got to go.
We're late.

1139
01:10:44,081 --> 01:10:45,343
l want to kiss her goodbye.

1140
01:10:45,549 --> 01:10:49,041
-She can't know about this.
-l won't wake her. Just one kiss.

1141
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:58,026
Look at that face. lsn't she cute?

1142
01:10:58,228 --> 01:10:59,525
Don't wake her up.

1143
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:00,697
-Let's go.
-What's that?

1144
01:11:00,898 --> 01:11:03,196
-This is your gun.
-l could never shoot--

1145
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,596
Holy shit!

1146
01:11:14,278 --> 01:11:15,905
What happened? You all right?

1147
01:11:16,113 --> 01:11:17,080
Sorry, honey.

1148
01:11:17,281 --> 01:11:18,475
Fucking lunatic!

1149
01:11:30,127 --> 01:11:32,994
-I've never been in the woods before.
-What?

1150
01:11:33,197 --> 01:11:35,665
The woods! I've never been
in the woods before.

1151
01:11:35,866 --> 01:11:39,495
The most important thing you
need to know is, if you see...

1152
01:11:39,703 --> 01:11:43,696
...anything that Iooks Iike poison ivy,
don't wipe your ass with it.

1153
01:11:49,046 --> 01:11:50,445
You old duck hunter!

1154
01:11:51,582 --> 01:11:53,311
-How's it going?
-Fine. You?

1155
01:11:53,617 --> 01:11:55,551
Wouldn't miss it for the world!

1156
01:11:55,752 --> 01:11:59,085
Damn ducks! What the hell
we need those ducks for?

1157
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,955
What a day to kill a duck.

1158
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,528
Maybe after the hunt
we can shoot billiards.

1159
01:12:05,729 --> 01:12:07,196
What do you say?
Here.

1160
01:12:07,397 --> 01:12:09,422
l picked this out for you myself.

1161
01:12:09,967 --> 01:12:11,764
This is your hunting jacket.

1162
01:12:11,969 --> 01:12:13,095
That is great!

1163
01:12:15,505 --> 01:12:17,598
-Thanks, Dibbsy.
-lt looks wonderful.

1164
01:12:17,808 --> 01:12:18,866
You know who you look like?

1165
01:12:19,076 --> 01:12:19,906
Ernest Hemingway.

1166
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:21,270
-Honest?
-Doesn't he?

1167
01:12:23,046 --> 01:12:24,809
Look, l hate to rush.

1168
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:28,177
Something unexpected came up.
l can't go with you.

1169
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:30,785
-Why not?
-Business. That's life.

1170
01:12:30,988 --> 01:12:32,649
Emergency at the plant.

1171
01:12:32,856 --> 01:12:35,586
The ducks won't wait.
They don't care about business.

1172
01:12:35,792 --> 01:12:36,918
Come on. Let's go.

1173
01:12:37,127 --> 01:12:38,856
Did you shoot all these yourself?

1174
01:12:39,062 --> 01:12:41,929
You did.
And all the Fieldings before you.

1175
01:12:42,366 --> 01:12:44,926
-Ducks for dinner tonight!
-Happy hunting!

1176
01:12:45,135 --> 01:12:48,104
Wait in the truck.
l got to go to the bathroom.

1177
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,039
-Happy hunting!
-l got to talk to you.

1178
01:12:52,943 --> 01:12:56,777
You were supposed to come with us.
What the fuck's going on?

1179
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:00,143
Relax, will you?
Just get him in the duck blind.

1180
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:01,681
Blast a couple of ducks...

1181
01:13:01,885 --> 01:13:03,614
...and then you yell,
''Look out!

1182
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:06,584
There's a bear! Run for your life!''
Then you blast him.

1183
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:08,519
There are no bears
in a duck blind.

1184
01:13:08,725 --> 01:13:11,057
lt doesn't matter if
there are bears or not!

1185
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:14,628
Just yell, ''There's a bear!''
lt'll all be over before he knows it.

1186
01:13:16,466 --> 01:13:18,024
l want the other half
of my money...

1187
01:13:18,235 --> 01:13:20,999
...before people find out
we're not burying Fielding.

1188
01:13:21,204 --> 01:13:22,535
There's no chance of that.

1189
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:24,707
l have all the documents
l need to prove...

1190
01:13:24,908 --> 01:13:26,876
...that he is Abe Fielding.

1191
01:13:27,244 --> 01:13:29,405
You don't have to worry about it.

1192
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,678
Come on!

1193
01:13:32,115 --> 01:13:34,015
This is a nice jacket
he gave me.

1194
01:13:34,217 --> 01:13:36,617
lt must've cost him a pretty penny.

1195
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:39,414
You got to put the collar up.
You got to be cool.

1196
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:40,453
How do you mean?

1197
01:13:40,657 --> 01:13:42,716
Classy.
l like that.

1198
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,049
-CooI?
-CooI.

1199
01:13:44,394 --> 01:13:45,918
CooI, man. Like you?

1200
01:13:46,129 --> 01:13:46,959
I Iook Iike Eddie.

1201
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,895
-Very nice.
-Ducks!

1202
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:07,717
Not now.

1203
01:14:07,918 --> 01:14:09,112
Take it easy.

1204
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:13,520
Easy.

1205
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:18,561
Keep flying! Go home!
There's people down here with guns!

1206
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:19,826
Get out of here!

1207
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:21,930
Go back to your families!
Get out!

1208
01:14:22,132 --> 01:14:23,360
Get out! Get out!

1209
01:14:23,567 --> 01:14:24,693
Why'd you do that?

1210
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:27,766
To keep an innocent creature
from being killed.

1211
01:14:27,971 --> 01:14:30,565
To save you from a lifetime
of heartache and guilt.

1212
01:14:30,774 --> 01:14:32,935
-They're just ducks!
-They're not just ducks!

1213
01:14:33,276 --> 01:14:35,437
They're alive!
They're like you and me!

1214
01:14:35,645 --> 01:14:36,771
They're not like you and me.

1215
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:39,574
They fly around
and they shit on people.

1216
01:14:41,218 --> 01:14:44,585
Be kind to your web-footed friends

1217
01:14:45,956 --> 01:14:47,583
Cause a duck couId be--

1218
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:51,058
Could you freeze on the
''web-footed friends'' shit?

1219
01:14:51,261 --> 01:14:54,162
Sorry, l couldn't help
think about those poor ducks.

1220
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:56,628
-What was that?
-What was what?

1221
01:14:57,267 --> 01:14:58,256
l heard something.

1222
01:15:00,003 --> 01:15:01,493
-Bird?
-lt was a bear!

1223
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:02,865
A bear!

1224
01:15:05,108 --> 01:15:05,938
Where?

1225
01:15:06,209 --> 01:15:07,642
l'm going to get it.

1226
01:15:08,512 --> 01:15:09,638
Do you see it?

1227
01:15:10,447 --> 01:15:12,642
-No, but it's a bear.
-Where is it now?

1228
01:15:12,849 --> 01:15:15,943
-lt's a brown bear.
-A big brown bear?

1229
01:15:18,755 --> 01:15:19,585
You were right.

1230
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:20,654
l see it.

1231
01:15:20,857 --> 01:15:22,347
You put one of these....

1232
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:23,617
Oh, my God.

1233
01:15:25,662 --> 01:15:26,959
He's huge!

1234
01:15:27,164 --> 01:15:29,394
He's a great giant bear!

1235
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:33,801
Don't worry.

1236
01:15:35,272 --> 01:15:36,102
Don't worry.

1237
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:37,403
Sit.

1238
01:15:37,607 --> 01:15:38,574
Sit, baby.

1239
01:15:40,644 --> 01:15:42,168
He's going to rip off your dick!

1240
01:15:42,379 --> 01:15:43,471
Hello there.

1241
01:15:44,481 --> 01:15:45,778
Say, you're...

1242
01:15:45,982 --> 01:15:47,609
...a big fellow, aren't you?

1243
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,344
lf you understand what l'm saying...

1244
01:15:51,621 --> 01:15:53,521
...raise your left hand.
Good.

1245
01:15:53,723 --> 01:15:55,987
Now both of them.
Very good!

1246
01:15:56,193 --> 01:15:57,785
What the fuck are you doing?

1247
01:15:59,463 --> 01:16:01,124
We want to express...

1248
01:16:02,365 --> 01:16:04,128
...love for you.

1249
01:16:05,535 --> 01:16:07,628
Eddie and l come in peace.

1250
01:16:09,372 --> 01:16:12,899
Well, l see what you mean.
You make a good point.

1251
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:18,839
We saw your friends mounted on the wall
at the lodge we just came from.

1252
01:16:19,049 --> 01:16:20,038
Tell you the truth...

1253
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:23,219
...Eddie and l found it disgusting.
Didn't we?

1254
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:25,217
Get the fuck out of the way!

1255
01:16:25,422 --> 01:16:26,787
l'm going to shoot it!

1256
01:16:27,757 --> 01:16:28,883
Don't shoot.

1257
01:16:29,092 --> 01:16:30,286
Don't shoot!

1258
01:16:41,271 --> 01:16:42,533
Well, kids...

1259
01:16:43,874 --> 01:16:48,140
...it's time to ring down the curtain
on this little production of ours.

1260
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:52,004
l think we made a hit, don't you?

1261
01:16:52,782 --> 01:16:57,549
Leticia, l prophesy a big career
for you. l mean that.

1262
01:16:57,754 --> 01:17:00,621
The memorial service will be
in the Fielding chapel...

1263
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:03,088
...which is just adjoining
the brewery.

1264
01:17:04,027 --> 01:17:05,255
Brewery!

1265
01:17:05,629 --> 01:17:08,530
l will be expecting
the three of you to attend.

1266
01:17:08,865 --> 01:17:11,425
Just think of it as a curtain call.

1267
01:17:11,635 --> 01:17:13,830
So you're saying that
we're burying him...

1268
01:17:14,037 --> 01:17:16,403
...as Fielding, even though
he wasn't Fielding.

1269
01:17:16,606 --> 01:17:18,972
Yes, l feel
it's the least we can do.

1270
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:22,612
You know, the poor guy
had no family, no friends.

1271
01:17:22,812 --> 01:17:26,509
lt's a terrible tragedy,
but accidents happen.

1272
01:17:27,784 --> 01:17:29,217
Don't they, Eddie?

1273
01:17:30,453 --> 01:17:31,750
lt was an accident.

1274
01:17:31,955 --> 01:17:33,013
Of course it was.

1275
01:17:33,223 --> 01:17:37,159
No one is saying it wasn't.
Nobody blames you.

1276
01:17:37,827 --> 01:17:38,919
How do we play this?

1277
01:17:39,129 --> 01:17:40,619
Like we knew him as Abe?

1278
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:43,890
Of course, Jerome.
That's the whole point, isn't it?

1279
01:17:45,402 --> 01:17:47,199
Play it sad, but not morose.

1280
01:17:47,938 --> 01:17:49,803
Upset, but, please, no tears.

1281
01:17:51,074 --> 01:17:53,338
Poor guy. l feel awful.

1282
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:55,374
Well, you use that, Eleanor.

1283
01:17:55,579 --> 01:17:59,071
Save it for later and use it.
That's called ''method acting.''

1284
01:17:59,282 --> 01:18:02,274
Look, everybody, l just want
to express my gratitude...

1285
01:18:02,485 --> 01:18:04,715
...to a very talented ensemble...

1286
01:18:04,921 --> 01:18:08,220
...of thespians.
Bravo! Bravissimo!

1287
01:18:36,386 --> 01:18:39,116
For Pete's sake!
lf we knew you were Abe...

1288
01:18:39,322 --> 01:18:41,313
...we might have been able
to help you!

1289
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:50,024
Now, that is a beautiful suit.

1290
01:18:50,233 --> 01:18:53,794
And that tie matches perfectly.
But you need a handkerchief.

1291
01:18:54,004 --> 01:18:56,837
-Can l get a handkerchief?
-Enough is enough!

1292
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,338
Sit down in the pew,
shut up and be good.

1293
01:18:59,542 --> 01:19:01,305
l always said you were full of shit.

1294
01:19:08,318 --> 01:19:10,013
We hardly knew you.

1295
01:19:11,254 --> 01:19:12,551
We knew your dad, though.

1296
01:19:12,889 --> 01:19:14,880
Many of us remember
putting to rest...

1297
01:19:15,091 --> 01:19:19,960
...rather, preserving the great man
right here, not so long ago.

1298
01:19:20,397 --> 01:19:24,731
And now father and son can freeze
in peace together.

1299
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:31,469
Abe's best friend,
Mr. Eddie Dash, is here.

1300
01:19:31,675 --> 01:19:33,199
He's going to say a few words.

1301
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:36,106
Eddie, come and say a few words.

1302
01:19:39,049 --> 01:19:40,175
-Mr. Dibbs?
-What?

1303
01:19:40,383 --> 01:19:43,284
There's an extremely urgent
phone call for you.

1304
01:19:48,124 --> 01:19:49,250
Hey, hands off!

1305
01:19:54,364 --> 01:19:57,390
Abe was a nice man.

1306
01:19:57,734 --> 01:20:00,635
Yes, he was.
Good man, Abe.

1307
01:20:02,806 --> 01:20:04,000
He liked basil.

1308
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:06,441
He loved basil.

1309
01:20:06,643 --> 01:20:10,044
He used to say basil was
a herb whose time had come.

1310
01:20:14,718 --> 01:20:16,083
Unfortunately, Abe...

1311
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:18,878
...it was you whose time had come.

1312
01:20:19,422 --> 01:20:21,982
We used to smoke basil together.

1313
01:20:22,292 --> 01:20:24,988
And you know,
we'd get a natural high.

1314
01:20:25,462 --> 01:20:26,929
Smoked a lot too.

1315
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:30,957
And he loved to yodel.
Yodeling and magic...

1316
01:20:31,167 --> 01:20:32,293
...that was his thing.

1317
01:20:32,502 --> 01:20:35,266
He always said
if he could combine the two...

1318
01:20:35,472 --> 01:20:40,239
...he would yodel from his grave.
l know that's impossible.

1319
01:20:55,525 --> 01:20:56,651
lt's a miracle!

1320
01:21:22,285 --> 01:21:23,115
Hi, everybody.

1321
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:26,646
l'm very touched that
you all came to my funeral.

1322
01:21:26,856 --> 01:21:28,255
l know this must be a--

1323
01:21:28,825 --> 01:21:29,655
Honey!

1324
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:34,830
What happened?
What's the matter, sweetheart?

1325
01:21:35,031 --> 01:21:36,328
What the hell is going on?

1326
01:21:36,533 --> 01:21:38,967
-You tell me.
-Did we rehearse this scene?

1327
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:51,977
What are you doing?

1328
01:21:52,182 --> 01:21:54,673
Have you completely lost
your tiny mind?

1329
01:21:54,884 --> 01:21:58,342
-You forget, we're playing my game now.
-Really?

1330
01:21:58,555 --> 01:22:01,524
l've got news for you.
l'm the one holding all the cards.

1331
01:22:01,724 --> 01:22:03,214
l can prove you're a murderer.

1332
01:22:03,426 --> 01:22:05,951
l've got the whole ugly
business on tape.

1333
01:22:06,162 --> 01:22:08,289
Au contraire.
There was no murder.

1334
01:22:08,498 --> 01:22:11,763
But there was a conspiracy to murder,
which l have on tape.

1335
01:22:14,103 --> 01:22:16,094
Honey, can you hear me?

1336
01:22:18,508 --> 01:22:21,443
-Everything's going to be all right.
-Eddie shot you.

1337
01:22:21,644 --> 01:22:24,772
That was part of the plan.
He was supposed to tell you.

1338
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:26,972
We worked it out
on the way to the lodge.

1339
01:22:27,617 --> 01:22:31,018
This is our first meeting...
our second meeting....

1340
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:34,722
Here's something for you.
Johnny Mathis.

1341
01:22:34,924 --> 01:22:36,516
To help you make it
through the night.

1342
01:22:39,729 --> 01:22:40,889
And this file...

1343
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:44,395
...proves that my man
is Abe Fielding.

1344
01:22:44,601 --> 01:22:46,466
Your man is dead!

1345
01:22:46,669 --> 01:22:48,569
Wrong again, Dibbsy.

1346
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:53,873
What does that mean?
What does ''bogazine'' mean?

1347
01:22:59,682 --> 01:23:01,445
We got to get out of here!

1348
01:23:03,753 --> 01:23:05,778
But l saw him lying in the morgue!

1349
01:23:05,989 --> 01:23:07,320
Eddie's got connections.

1350
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:09,856
The morgue attendant
owed him a favor. Right?

1351
01:23:10,059 --> 01:23:11,151
That's right.

1352
01:23:11,628 --> 01:23:13,152
Hello, everybody.

1353
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,230
l know you must be confused
about what's going on.

1354
01:23:16,699 --> 01:23:20,601
The important thing is that
l'm back at the brewery...

1355
01:23:20,803 --> 01:23:24,239
...and you're all in
for a five-percent raise.

1356
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:28,601
Don't listen.
He's full of shit!

1357
01:23:33,249 --> 01:23:34,238
You all right?

1358
01:23:34,617 --> 01:23:35,447
Get me up!

1359
01:23:35,652 --> 01:23:37,210
Get me up right now!

1360
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,183
You can't say we didn't try.

1361
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:40,886
Cut him loose.

1362
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:42,717
That man is an impostor!

1363
01:23:44,627 --> 01:23:46,254
Cut me out of this!

1364
01:23:46,529 --> 01:23:47,894
He's not Abe Fielding.

1365
01:23:48,097 --> 01:23:51,931
l knew Abe Fielding.
Abe Fielding was a friend of mine.

1366
01:23:52,135 --> 01:23:55,002
And this man is not Abe Fielding.

1367
01:23:55,204 --> 01:23:58,071
But, Mr. Dibbs,
you just eulogized him. You said:

1368
01:23:58,274 --> 01:24:00,868
-...''Abe, we hardly knew you--''
-Shut up. Sit down.

1369
01:24:01,678 --> 01:24:02,508
You! You!

1370
01:24:03,379 --> 01:24:07,406
Did you or did you not treat
this man in your lunatic asylum?

1371
01:24:07,617 --> 01:24:10,142
Sanitarium! You told us
he was Abe Fielding.

1372
01:24:10,353 --> 01:24:11,615
Right, but he's not!

1373
01:24:11,821 --> 01:24:15,086
l challenge anyone to say
that he's Abe Fielding.

1374
01:24:15,291 --> 01:24:18,419
He's Abe Fielding!
l've been his bookie for years.

1375
01:24:18,895 --> 01:24:19,862
Shut up!

1376
01:24:20,063 --> 01:24:23,055
He's one of our best friends.
lsn't that right, honey?

1377
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:24,790
-Not now, you idiot!
-Wait.

1378
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:26,491
l don't remember this scene.

1379
01:24:26,703 --> 01:24:29,763
Ladies and gentlemen,
these people are merely actors.

1380
01:24:29,973 --> 01:24:30,962
Merely actors?

1381
01:24:31,174 --> 01:24:32,971
And not very good ones at that.

1382
01:24:33,176 --> 01:24:35,770
They're playing roles.
They're being paid.

1383
01:24:41,484 --> 01:24:43,349
Point of order!

1384
01:24:46,089 --> 01:24:46,919
Help.

1385
01:24:48,658 --> 01:24:51,752
Ronald Reagan was merely an actor!

1386
01:24:56,833 --> 01:24:58,528
All right. Fine!

1387
01:24:59,769 --> 01:25:01,361
Are you the Equity deputy?

1388
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:04,666
l don't know what to say.

1389
01:25:04,874 --> 01:25:07,672
l feel like such a fool.
l'm sorry. l am.

1390
01:25:07,877 --> 01:25:09,504
l lost, you won.

1391
01:25:09,712 --> 01:25:11,145
Come on!

1392
01:25:11,347 --> 01:25:15,374
Let's bury the hatchet over
a stein of Fielding in my-- your office.

1393
01:25:15,585 --> 01:25:17,485
-No, l don't--
-Don't be a spoilsport!

1394
01:25:17,687 --> 01:25:21,179
-We don't have time.
-Abe or George, whatever....

1395
01:25:21,858 --> 01:25:22,847
Listen, George--

1396
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:28,494
Run! Run!

1397
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:33,062
He's going to kill him!

1398
01:25:33,302 --> 01:25:34,929
Bring the casket down here quick!

1399
01:25:35,138 --> 01:25:36,332
Come on, this way!

1400
01:25:43,179 --> 01:25:44,476
Onward!

1401
01:26:27,757 --> 01:26:29,019
This is my brewery.

1402
01:26:29,225 --> 01:26:31,785
l earned it!
You wanted to be in beer?

1403
01:26:31,994 --> 01:26:33,188
Welcome to the business.

1404
01:26:33,596 --> 01:26:37,327
Dibbsy, l won't tell the police
you tried to kill me!

1405
01:26:37,533 --> 01:26:38,693
The name is Mr. Dibbs!

1406
01:26:42,538 --> 01:26:43,402
Help!

1407
01:26:48,911 --> 01:26:50,401
Eddie, l'm down here!

1408
01:26:53,483 --> 01:26:54,814
Oh, God!

1409
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:23,776
Get the valve!

1410
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:50,799
Will somebody please tell me
what's going on?

1411
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:04,746
Boy, that was good beer!

1412
01:28:05,621 --> 01:28:06,883
Oh, honey!

1413
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,686
Where's Dibbsy?

1414
01:28:12,695 --> 01:28:13,855
Guard!

1415
01:28:14,697 --> 01:28:15,857
Get him out.

1416
01:28:20,603 --> 01:28:21,729
He's not Fielding.

1417
01:28:21,938 --> 01:28:24,133
He's a liar.
The man's a liar.

1418
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:29,372
lf you lie about this, you'll be
lying for the rest of your life!

1419
01:28:29,812 --> 01:28:31,074
Liar!

1420
01:28:37,086 --> 01:28:41,352
lf l don't tell the truth right now,
will you ever believe me again?

Don't do anything stupid!

1424
01:28:55,004 --> 01:28:56,733
We're pissing in tall cotton.

1425
01:28:59,675 --> 01:29:01,233
Sorry, everybody.

1426
01:29:02,245 --> 01:29:03,769
l want to tell you something.

1427
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:07,147
Mr. Dibbs was telling the truth
a little while ago.

1428
01:29:08,651 --> 01:29:10,516
l am a pathological liar.

1429
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:14,212
l spent the last three years
of my life in a sanitarium.

1430
01:29:14,423 --> 01:29:15,890
Shit, l'm broke.

1431
01:29:16,592 --> 01:29:21,359
l'm a Volvo dealer,
and my name happens to be George.

1432
01:29:21,564 --> 01:29:25,728
-This Fielding's a beaut.
-George. Get used to George.

1433
01:29:25,935 --> 01:29:28,961
George Washington,
as a matter of fact.

1434
01:29:30,006 --> 01:29:33,203
Hey, everybody!
Take the rest of the day off.

1435
01:29:33,843 --> 01:29:37,074
And forget about that five-percent
raise when you come back.

1436
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,548
lt'll be a ten-percent raise.

1437
01:29:57,466 --> 01:30:00,663
Stop fucking around!
Okay, smile.

1438
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:03,998
A little more. Great!

1439
01:30:15,418 --> 01:30:16,942
Can l have that card?

1440
01:30:17,153 --> 01:30:19,246
Thank you.
And l need your lipstick.

1441
01:30:19,689 --> 01:30:22,920
l don't want to take a picture
with no lipstick!

1442
01:30:23,592 --> 01:30:24,854
You'll like this one.

1443
01:30:25,061 --> 01:30:26,551
l don't want no lipstick.

1444
01:30:26,762 --> 01:30:30,357
They'll put me in a magazine.
They'll take pictures.

1445
01:30:35,271 --> 01:30:36,898
Hey, what are you doing?

1446
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,273
l don't like to be touched!

1447
01:30:39,475 --> 01:30:41,500
Just keep your hands off!

1448
01:30:42,011 --> 01:30:43,706
What's wrong with you?

1449
