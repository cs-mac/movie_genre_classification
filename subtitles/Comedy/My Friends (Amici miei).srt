I have to tell her, no?

- Yes!

also like to know why.

- Couldn't it be one of our nuns?

No. She wasn't wearing
either a uniform...

Hello, Miss? I'm Perozzi, room 31.

Someone with a beige dress, curly
hair and three roses will ask about me.

> That visits are forbidden,
and I can't see anybody.

250
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:50,406
<Melandri: What do you think?
- Pretty! Pretty! Long thighs, like an antelope.

- Well, she has a defect
though... - Sure! - What is it?

(NECCHI LAUGHS) Melandri: That's
a pig, besides being a torturer.

255
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:11,890

position to harass his poor patients.

which usually involves
the rest of us too...

261
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,728
...because when Melandri falls in love
he becomes an unbearable dead weight.

00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:32,796
- Macaroni pie! Delicious!
- Ah!

263
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:38,056
Aren't you joining us? It's
awfully good, Necchi's wife made it.

264
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:39,385
Of course not!

265
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:44,912
Shall we play target-shooting spitting
at the ceiling? You'll get distracted.

266
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,972
- But not while we're eating.
- Melandri: No, thanks.

267
00:18:48,824 --> 00:18:53,439
- Sorry guys, I can't make it.
- No! I'm the one who can't make it!

268
00:18:53,644 --> 00:18:56,560
We can't go on living with a corpse.

269
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:59,069
- I want to go to a different hospital, or at least to a different ward!
- Quiet!

270
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:01,952
- I'd better stay with the leper than with an arsehole.
- Calm down!

271
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:02,839
Sit down!

272
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:09,896
Here is a typical threesome:
he, she and the other man.

273
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:12,782
Well, he is a piece of shit
who deserves to be cheated on.

274
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,753
- She...
- A piece of pussy pie.

275
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:18,519
- Well, yes!
- As regards the other man I've been wondering, for a long time:

276
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,978
why does he always give in so soon?

277
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:25,414
Because she is too
beautiful, unreachable.

278
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:28,939
And he is an important man, with a
strong personality, the charismatic type.

279
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:32,095
- What can I hope for?
<Count: Nothing.

280
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,929
Nothing, I agree.

281
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,005
In fact, if you weren't a jerk but
a horse, I'd bet on you at 1 to 200.

282
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:39,867
And I would win...

283
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,540
...because Melandri has an advantage:

284
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,811
the shrink.

285
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:49,478
- Who?
- The headshrinker, the psychoanalyst.

286
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:54,163
And if a woman goes to the psychoanalyst,
there's something missing in her life.

287
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:59,085
And what does a woman miss in
her life 99 times out of 100?

288
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:01,183
Love!

hump! - Me? - Yes.

441
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:57,561
- You're wrong...
- You've touched my hump...

442
00:29:57,639 --> 00:29:59,261
...to pass school tests.
- I assure you th...

443
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:00,890
- I felt you, you know?
- But...

444
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:04,288
Lady: Now she plays the angel! Study
instead of touching people's humps!

445
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,667
<Mrs. 1: She seemed so respectable!
- Mr. 1: Come on, sit down.

446
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:09,343
<Mrs. 2: That's absurd!
<Mr. 2: They're all the same!

447
00:30:09,418 --> 00:30:11,213
<Mrs. 3: Oh, my goodness!
- Thanks!

448
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,708
[And since I was a hunchback, I
remained a hunchback till I got home...]

449
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:17,252
Perozzi: Hi! [... but I
hadn't considered my son.]

450
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:19,421
[I never remember if he teaches
in Milan on the odd days...]

451
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:21,700
[...and here in Florence on
the even days, or vice versa.]

452
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:25,166
[On which Sunday he stays
with me or goes to his mother.]

453
00:30:25,235 --> 00:30:28,449
[In any case, he always shows
up when I'm not expecting him.]

454
00:30:28,731 --> 00:30:29,436
Dad!

455
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:34,294
- Don't worry, Luciano.
- How couldn't I, with a dad like you?

456
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:37,655
[He didn't fall for it for a moment.]

457
00:30:37,726 --> 00:30:40,371
[Because he is intelligent, no doubt,]

458
00:30:40,442 --> 00:30:42,536
[but he lacks sense of humour.]

459
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:45,491
And don't think you can do
to me what you did to mum.

460
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:47,189
You made her go crazy.

461
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,981
<But when will you grow up, dad,
and stop acting like an idiot?

462
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:57,644
[I wondered if the idiot was
me, who saw life like a game...]

463
00:30:57,854 --> 00:31:01,214
[...or if it was him, who
saw it like a prison.]

464
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:03,312
[Or if we were both idiots.]

465
00:31:04,304 --> 00:31:06,977
[Perozzi: Necchi, on the other
hand, found out his right arm...]

466
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:09,660
[...still hurt when he
made specific movements...]

467
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,717
[...above all when he had to stick
stamps on the football pools coupons.]

468
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,682
<Necchi: Ouch! The professor told me:

469
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:18,552
...''Total recovery. You can make any
movement but don't press your thumbs''.

470
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:22,626
And I have to press and drag
my thumb. How unlucky of me!

471
00:31:22,803 --> 00:31:25,139
Leave it to me. And we'll hire
someone else for Saturdays.

472
00:31:25,314 --> 00:31:26,530
I can't do it. It hurts.

473
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:32,916
- Crisis, guys!
- Yes, the lira collapsed!

474
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:35,457
Not that! Judas is in a serious crisis!

475
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:36,882
- Necchi: Oh! Is he?
- Hell yes!

476
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:40,683
No way! They used to dance ''My foolish
heart'' and dine in the candle light...

477
00:31:40,962 --> 00:31:41,801
- They did...
- Then?

478
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,789
...but since he wanted to feed
her, his beard caught fire.

479
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:46,049
- And then?
- They broke up!

480
00:31:46,223 --> 00:31:48,251
Actually his beard has
nothing to do with it.

481
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,143
They say they can't
keep on being in hiding.

482
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:53,648
Their screams almost
broke down the walls.

483
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:59,353
They'd like to tell the world: ''I
love Molly Pucci! I love Cippa Lippa!''.

484
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:03,328
(LAUGHS) The milkman's boy
passing by goes like: '' Prr!''.

485
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:05,972
(RlSA) - Oh, here's
the bill. - What's that?

486
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,963
You said you would buy
the Universal Encyclopaedia?

487
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:10,423
But if you changed your
mind I'll tear it up.

488
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:13,105
- Wait! If you're in need...
- I'm always in need.

489
00:32:14,362 --> 00:32:15,443
But I'm not a beggar!

490
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:17,687
After all, don't worry.

491
00:32:17,756 --> 00:32:20,469
I am about to make a
large business deal.

492
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:25,895
One hundred thousand? Are you crazy?

493
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,510
We're talking the whole leg
here, not the little finger!

494
00:32:28,754 --> 00:32:31,293
- And it's the right leg too.
- Usurer: So what? I know full well.

495
00:32:31,537 --> 00:32:35,572
Look. The plaster reaches
up to the knee. It's blocked.

496
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:38,357
- Count: Here, up to the ankle.
- Usurer: But it can be unblocked.

497
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:40,493
- Count: How, it can be unblocked?
- Usurer: It can just be unblocked!

498
00:32:40,566 --> 00:32:43,482
Count: What do you care! It's already
been estimated by the insurance.

499
00:32:43,655 --> 00:32:46,774
With such a leg you'll
get at least L. 800.000.

500
00:32:47,185 --> 00:32:50,747
Here is the assessment. Give me L.
200.000 cash, and the leg is yours.

501
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:53,695
- And what's the use of it?
- Then I'll go to another usurer.

502
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,850
[Perozzi: In the end he sold the rights
on his leg to a greengrocer from Candeli...]

503
00:32:56,927 --> 00:33:00,074
[...who gave him 650 lbs. of
potatoes and a 1959 Oldsmobile...]

504
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:02,459
[...which even a
car-wrecker would refuse...]

505
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:05,038
[...but which made Mascetti
self-confident, instead...]

506
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:07,850
[...as he thought he could
widen his sphere of activity.]

507
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:14,404
[Perozzi: No news from
Melandri, instead...]

508
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:18,372
[till one day Mascetti asked us to reach
him in Pescia as quickly as possible.]

509
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:19,904
- Too late.
- Perozzi: Why?

510
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:22,986
<Necchi: Why is it too late? -
Because he got in long ago. - Who?

511
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:24,415
Melandri.

512
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,348
- Perozzi: Melandri?
- Necchi: There where?

513
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:28,518
- He got in to the villa of Nazi... Of the professor.
- Oh!

514
00:33:28,596 --> 00:33:30,690
- I came to sell him an encyclopaedia.
- And then?

515
00:33:30,768 --> 00:33:33,307
And then I saw Melandri's car arrive...

516
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,944
...I hid here and saw him
get off in a black suit...

517
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,722
...with a collared coat and a bow tie...

518
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:42,708
Fulminating God! He went to
tell her husband! And then?

519
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,308
I called you at once because he's going
to ruin himself. We have to do something.

520
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,366
- Necchi: What can we do?
- Perozzi: Calm down, guys!

521
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:51,773
- Necchi: Calm down my arse!
- You know her husband, don't you?

522
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:53,941
You know he's a beast.
Then let him settle that.

523
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:56,457
He'll peel off his skin and
make a lampshade out of it.

524
00:33:56,938 --> 00:34:00,327
[Perozzi: It was an error of judgement.]

525
00:34:00,536 --> 00:34:05,286
If this was a sophisticated
comedy instead of a drama...

526
00:34:05,662 --> 00:34:08,509
...at this point the protagonist
would tell the antagonist:

527
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:11,361
...''Professor, I came to ask
your wife's hand in marriage''.

528
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:12,141
Is that all?

529
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:16,824
<Yes. No! Let me add that in front of you
there's a man who's ready for anything.

530
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:19,403
- Also to take the beast?
- Sorry?

531
00:34:19,986 --> 00:34:21,269
That thing there.

532
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:26,055
<He's Birillo, Donatella's
dog. She loves him a lot.

533
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:27,989
Of course I'll take him.

534
00:34:28,845 --> 00:34:32,542
He eats a kilo of sliced meat a day,
plus one and a half kilos of rice...

535
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:36,235
... and he needs to be walked out
at five o'clock every morning.

536
00:34:36,414 --> 00:34:38,653
Those are careless details!

537
00:34:39,062 --> 00:34:41,870
Let's discuss serious things,
instead. Important things.

538
00:34:43,067 --> 00:34:45,441
<Melandri: Let's speak of the children.
- Let's speak of them.

539
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:48,557
Since you're so
comprehensive and polite...

540
00:34:49,448 --> 00:34:51,041
...I appeal to your good heart...

541
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:55,214
...so that Donatella can see
her creatures. Regularly.

542
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:58,575
At least once every two weeks.

543
00:34:59,427 --> 00:35:00,351
No?

544
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:05,020
- Here, I knew it.
- Sassaroli: No, you misunderstood me.

545
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:09,167
I said no, because I'm the one who will
come to see the creatures at your place.

546
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:12,831
Maybe not once every two weeks,
but we'll come to an agreement.

547
00:35:12,971 --> 00:35:13,878
Then, you...

548
00:35:15,143 --> 00:35:15,847
Of course.

549
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:22,572
See, this is a whole chain of affections
that neither I or you can break.

550
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:25,723
You love my wife.

551
00:35:26,276 --> 00:35:28,613
My wife loves Birillo.

552
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,141
<Birillo adores the children.

553
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:36,691
<The children are attached to the governess.
- The governess?

554
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:41,313
German. She signed a two-year
contract. She's very strict. In uniform.

555
00:35:42,671 --> 00:35:47,720
I mean, who takes Donatella
takes the whole package.

556
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:51,503
[Perozzi: We had really lost him
and we didn't look for him anymore.]

557
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:53,536
[We preferred to remember
him as when he was alive.]

558
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,151
[So, we only received third-hand
and fourth-hand news of him...]

559
00:36:56,328 --> 00:36:58,596
[...occasional, casual, and
more and more tragic.]

560
00:37:14,827 --> 00:37:15,734
But where are you going?

561
00:37:16,082 --> 00:37:17,366
Come here! Come here!

562
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:18,727
Come here!

563
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:22,151
[Perozzi: But on a rainy night]

564
00:37:22,294 --> 00:37:24,186
[...the lost sheep returned to the fold.]

565
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:25,849
Good evening all.

566
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:30,539
It's been a while, huh?

567
00:37:31,696 --> 00:37:34,573
- How are you? Are you well? -
Perozzi: We are. - Necchi: So and so.

568
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,511
What bad weather!

569
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:38,682
I'm so cold...

570
00:37:39,164 --> 00:37:41,877
- How about a punch? Shall I heat up...
- No, I'm fine thanks.

571
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:46,421
- How about a game?
- Come on! We've just started. We'll play in couples.

572
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:49,508
- You and Mascetti vs. me and Perozzi.
- Good. This way you'll get warm.

573
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:52,329
Pick your usual cue and
go for the opening shot.

574
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:54,836
Here's the cue ball.
Shoot well, alright?

575
00:37:55,932 --> 00:37:57,891
So guys. How are you?

576
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,107
How are you?

577
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,823
- Well.
- Good!

578
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:06,284
How's the lady? And the
children? And the doggie?

579
00:38:06,454 --> 00:38:09,370
- Very well. <Count: Very well my
arse! What kind of opening is that?

580
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:11,943
You got down a ton of pins!

581
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:13,539
My hand shakes.

582
00:38:23,154 --> 00:38:24,844
Let's stop acting, guys.

583
00:38:25,123 --> 00:38:26,310
I can't take it anymore.

584
00:38:27,397 --> 00:38:29,221
I want to kill that filthy beast!

585
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:31,775
- The dog?
- Not the dog! The husband!

586
00:38:32,964 --> 00:38:35,368
Fuck him and his pewter coasters.

587
00:38:35,611 --> 00:38:38,256
<Perozzi: The coasters?
- Yes. The ones he has, while I don't.

588
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:41,276
And everything's like that. He comes
and goes, eats and sleeps at my place.

589
00:38:42,026 --> 00:38:44,054
And he's always blaming
me, he makes comparisons.

590
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,743
I'm always on trial, I'm depressed.

591
00:38:50,105 --> 00:38:52,847
The other night he even fucked
the maid! (PEROZZI LAUGHS)

592
00:38:52,922 --> 00:38:53,598
- Wow!
- Yes!

593
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,686
- What a fellow.
- I'd have never conceived that.

594
00:38:56,995 --> 00:38:59,437
Because he's
inconceivable! He's a devil.

595
00:39:01,747 --> 00:39:03,504
Guys, help me.

596
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:06,765
Tomorrow he'll come for a
visit. Join us for dinner.

597
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:10,571
I won't make it alone, but the four of
us together, like in the good old days...

598
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,877
One says a joke, another
makes a remark... Come on!

599
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:16,231
We've ruined so many people!
Together we'll make meatballs of them!

600
00:39:16,411 --> 00:39:17,453
(PEROZZI LAUGHS)

601

# Beautiful daughter of
love... # (EVERYBODY SINGS)

602
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:47,772
> Daughter: Bravo, dad!
Count: Great! Beautiful voice.

603
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:50,486
Dinner's ready! Take seats.

604
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:52,118
- Please...
- Necchi: Good!

605
00:39:52,187 --> 00:39:53,943
- To my left.
- Necchi: Thanks.

606
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,410
- That's your seat.
- Count: Thanks, madam.

607
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,747
- Please - You're very
kind. - This is my seat.

608
00:39:59,383 --> 00:40:00,936
Count: Well? Wasn't dinner ready?

609
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,590
> Melandri: Just moment! The jacket!
- Necchi: It was about time!

610
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:04,943
Count: Finally!

611
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,333
- Sassaroli: Isn't the maid here?
- We hired a new one part-time.

612
00:40:08,887 --> 00:40:11,629
- She sleeps at her place. -
Perozzi: Wine? - Donatella: Yes.

613
00:40:12,688 --> 00:40:15,874
- Watch out for the drops!
- Oh! Too late!

614
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,232
- Why don't you get pewter coasters?
- That's true.

615
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:21,373
- Perozzi: You know them, don't you?

616
00:40:21,446 --> 00:40:23,241
- Count: They're so handy!
- Please!

617
00:40:23,313 --> 00:40:27,927
No pewter coasters allowed in this
house. Am I correct, architect?

618
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:32,845
Surgeon, why don't you get a piece
of the pie before it gets cold.

619
00:40:34,955 --> 00:40:37,088
Why, is that a pie?

620
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:39,904
(Restraining himself) Yessir!

621
00:40:40,013 --> 00:40:42,821
Well, the architect is
right. The pie's all pied.

622
00:40:43,169 --> 00:40:45,544
It couldn't be more pied than
that! It seems an abortion!

623
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,850
My friend, in this house
substance matters more than form.

624
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:52,401
Sassaroli: Speaking of which...

625
00:40:52,945 --> 00:40:54,296
Two kilos and a half less.

626
00:40:55,185 --> 00:40:56,807
- What are you talking about?
- The children.

627
00:40:57,697 --> 00:41:00,207
<I have weighed them
as soon as I've arrived.

628
00:41:00,786 --> 00:41:02,851
And you too, Donatella, you're worn out.

629
00:41:03,162 --> 00:41:05,672
- Worn out?
- You look five years older!

630
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:08,855
- But what...
- Sassaroli: I mean, don't you go out, don't you do sports?

631
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:11,679
- Don't you ride?
- She rides, she rides... Tell him!

632
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:13,033
Every two weeks.

633
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:14,932
- That's not like riding at all.
- Perozzi: It's even worse.

634
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,885
- Not enough time for the handling!
- You should ride more often, Rambaldo.

635
00:41:18,063 --> 00:41:21,490
And the children look pale
too. Don't you take them to ski?

636
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:26,140
Ski, you said? Ski, the seaside,
the horses! The pewter coasters!

637
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,448
What are they like?

638
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,496
Here, to get a new pair of shoes
for the school is already a problem!

639
00:41:31,674 --> 00:41:33,768
I always do my best!
But it's never enough!

640
00:41:34,084 --> 00:41:37,376
- But love! Cippa Lippa! I don't...
- You!

641
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:38,963
Me what?

642
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,968
I do the impossible!
Why are you blaming me?

643
00:41:43,249 --> 00:41:46,463
You're no longer as extraordinary
as when we spoke on the phone.

644
00:41:46,847 --> 00:41:48,912
- Of course! We were the ones on the phone!
- Shut up!

645
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:52,649
- And then, you bit off more than you could chew!
- Stop it!

646
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:58,143
Stop making such a scene!
Now go and wash your face!

647
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:01,779
And don't get back unless
you're calm. Forward, march!

648
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:11,043
(Everyone hums) Sassaroli: And
you let her treat you that way?

649
00:42:11,116 --> 00:42:13,384
- Sassaroli: In front of all!
- Count: Cippa Lippa!

650
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:15,215
- Sassaroli: In front of the children.
- Cippa Lippa!

651
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:16,304
Speaking of the children,

652
00:42:17,497 --> 00:42:19,563
why are you still up?

653
00:42:20,213 --> 00:42:22,240
Off to bed, jump to it!

654
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,350
- Daughter # 1: Yes, daddy!
- Daughter # 2: Bye, daddy!

655
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:26,594
<Daughter # 1: Good night, daddy.
(The governess speaks German)

656
00:42:26,662 --> 00:42:30,861
But what kind of family is this? What
kind of head of the family are you?

657
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:33,074
Necchi: He's not so wrong.

658
00:42:33,586 --> 00:42:35,613
Daddy, I'm going to break your head!

659
00:42:35,962 --> 00:42:37,989
Count: Put it down! (EVERYONE SHOUTS)

660
00:42:38,576 --> 00:42:40,574
- Melandri: Let go of me!
- Perozzi: Stop it!

661
00:42:40,646 --> 00:42:42,741
- Sassaroli: Knife!
- It isn't sharp, it's for the fish.

662
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:44,209
- Where's the fish?
- Perozzi: It's frozen.

663
00:42:44,278 --> 00:42:47,261
Cheat! You palmed me off with
a crazy woman, a megalomaniac.

664
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:49,737
You met her at the psychiatrist's!
What were you expecting?

665
00:42:49,811 --> 00:42:50,718
And what do you want from me?

666
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,112
Let go of me! (MELANDRI WEEPS)

667
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,686
- Perozzi: It's over. Now relieve yourself.
- Come on! Don't do that. Cippa Lippa.

668
00:43:01,895 --> 00:43:04,704
- Sassaroli: Give him some water.
- Melandri: No! Whisky.

669
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:06,677
Ungrateful!

670
00:43:08,412 --> 00:43:10,883
She's so ungrateful.

671
00:43:11,365 --> 00:43:13,160
I couldn't do more for her.

672
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:16,183
I've even started to freelance again.

673
00:43:16,966 --> 00:43:19,611
- I've designed five family vaults.
- Count: Wow!

674
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:22,394
<I've sacrificed myself!
- Come on now!

675
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:27,752
- Don't think about it. Shall we go out?
- No.

676
00:43:27,963 --> 00:43:29,517
Do you want us to walk you out to pee?

677
00:43:30,645 --> 00:43:31,552
- No.
- No!

678
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:38,145
What could we do for you? I
know! Let's go to the station.

679
00:43:38,214 --> 00:43:40,173
- Necchi: Yes! Good idea!
- Count: Yes, he needs that.

680
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:40,887
To do what?

681
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,861
It's none of your business.
Just help us convince Melandri.

682
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:48,830
That's easy! Dear Melandri,
listen to your doctor.

683
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,999
- Diagnosis: You can't go on with such a woman.
- No.

684
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,386
- Cure: Break up!
- But how?

685
00:44:00,413 --> 00:44:03,492
- Just leave. Sneak out.
- Of course.

686
00:44:04,146 --> 00:44:06,212
- Where's your coat?
- Upstairs.

687
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:08,351
- Nevermind. Let's go.
<Count: Be careful.

688
00:44:08,423 --> 00:44:09,099
- Shh!
- Shh!

689
00:44:10,392 --> 00:44:11,540
- Shh!
- Necchi: Alright!

690
00:44:11,614 --> 00:44:12,762
- Come on!
- Shh!

691
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:16,496
- But how shall I face her?
- What do you care?

692
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,974
- What shall I tell her?
- Nothing. Just leave and disappear.

693
00:44:19,047 --> 00:44:22,195
- But how will they make it?
- She will find another jerk, being so beautiful!

694
00:44:22,408 --> 00:44:24,164
- Will she?
- Don't make us waste time.

695
00:44:26,888 --> 00:44:28,151
But I...

696
00:44:28,178 --> 00:44:29,433
- But I love her!
- Shh!

697
00:44:29,604 --> 00:44:32,963
- Quiet! - That's a trifle.
- And then it won't last forever.

698
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,865
I suffered terribly too, for
almost three quarters of an hour.

699
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:39,650
- Go ahead, come on!
- Go quietly downstairs!

700
00:44:39,855 --> 00:44:42,432
Let's go! (BIRILLO BARKS)

Nobody move! I'll take care of him!

704
00:44:58,455 --> 00:44:59,402
But are you crazy?

705
00:45:02,393 --> 00:45:03,136
But dad!

706
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,256
But are you always leaving?
He's always in my way!

707

Count: Come on guys, the train
to Empoli leaves from platform 3.

Sassaroli: But whose idea was it?

Melandri: It feels so good to
be with you, among men, guys!

Yes.

- Sassaroli: Back to the ward. All's delayed.
- Nurse: Why?

718
00:45:47,741 --> 00:45:51,235
Unlace! Unlace! Because I have a
more urgent case. This one can wait.

him. - Yes, otherwise he'll never come.

Sister! I need professor Sassaroli to
come down. Every minute is precious.

721

Excuse me, which of the three
phones is tarapia tapioco

722
00:46:06,443 --> 00:46:08,471
...so I can warn the
supercazzola? Which one?

723
00:46:09,532 --> 00:46:10,372
You haven't understood me.

724
00:46:10,449 --> 00:46:12,582
I said, which of the three
phones has got a prefix?

725
00:46:12,655 --> 00:46:13,842
- Ah! That one.
- Thanks.

as if it were antani, the stretcher,

727
00:46:18,086 --> 00:46:21,098
even for two, unhooded towards
left? You can't? What a pity!

728
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:26,265
- Hello, Titti? But where the hell were you?
- Sassaroli: Enough! There's no time for that!

729
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,995
Let me speak to her!

730

Speak to whom! Wasn't it a gypsy's joke?

- Once I have found her... Let me speak to her.
- Come on! It's late!

732
00:46:54,066 --> 00:46:55,658
What a pig! Stop!

733
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:57,997
What the hell!

734
00:47:02,246 --> 00:47:03,124
Who farted?

735
00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:07,231
Perozzi: Come on guys,
my heart is sickly!

736
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,491
- And it's freezing cold!
- We'd better freeze than choke.

737
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:17,481
- Air! Air! What have you eaten?
- Me? The same as you. Ask him!

738
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:19,418
Me? I was cleaning up my teeth!

739
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:21,995
Perozzi: If it was gasoline, it
would be enough to reach Copenhagen!

740
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:29,459
So what? Shall we move? I
haven't smelled anything.

741
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:38,747
[Perozzi: The demolition of the small
towns is an invention of Necchi's.]

742
00:47:38,834 --> 00:47:41,953
[In those types of inventions,
he's better than Guglielmo Marconi.]

743
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,805
> Necchi: This one will
do. Did you bring the stuff?

744
00:47:44,876 --> 00:47:46,970
> Melandri: As always.
Come on, guys! Help me.

745
00:47:47,048 --> 00:47:49,857
> Sassaroli: Give me the tripod!
- Necchi: Here it is, engineer!

746
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,458
Melandri: It will pass through here!

747
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:53,459
- Shall I get the tools?
- Yes, surveyor.

748
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:54,815
Necchi: I'm ready, engineer!

749
00:47:54,889 --> 00:47:58,654
Goniometre, theodolite, levels and
shafts! This side, all pulled down.

750
00:47:58,996 --> 00:48:02,626
- A crossover to the south! -
The map. - Sassaroli: Objective.

751
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:04,352
Two hills need razing.

752
00:48:04,427 --> 00:48:06,426
<Necchi: The map needs
adding a slide rule.

753
00:48:06,498 --> 00:48:08,969
Excuse me! Decametre
unhooded towards right. Here!

754
00:48:09,043 --> 00:48:11,688
<Melandri: Is the level ready?
<Necchi: Let's use the theodolite.

755
00:48:11,759 --> 00:48:13,998
<Melandri: Hurry with those
shafts! <Necchi: Yes, engineer!

756
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:15,863
<Sassaroli: Measurement!
- Give it back to me.

757
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:17,833
<Let's set the shafts.
- How long?

758
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,311
- Eight meters and
ten. - 117. - 117.

759
00:48:21,806 --> 00:48:24,615
- Count: Shall I start? - Yes. Mark
the houses to be demolished. - Good.

760
00:48:24,691 --> 00:48:26,864
- Necchi: Alright.
- Man: But what are they doing?

761
00:48:26,931 --> 00:48:28,350
<Necchi: 114!
<Sassaroli: 114!

762
00:48:28,425 --> 00:48:30,288
Zack and zack! Here, all down.

763
00:48:30,597 --> 00:48:33,174
<Melandri: And no
bulldozers or dynamite. TNT!

764
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:35,822
- Go away. We're working.
- Perozzi: Move away!

765
00:48:35,892 --> 00:48:39,387
- Count: Calm Down. Zack, zack, zack, zack.
- Perozzi: Please!

766
00:48:40,169 --> 00:48:41,008
That's enough!

767
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:44,745
The church is set, too. Sorry counsellor,
we got orders from the District.

768
00:48:45,295 --> 00:48:46,376
Perozzi: Allow me...

769
00:48:46,449 --> 00:48:48,756
Count: Take care of the future homeless.

770
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:51,634
<Tents, food, antibiotics,
blankets and above all umbrellas.

771
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,303
- Let's go!
- Necchi: Load completed.

772
00:48:53,373 --> 00:48:56,086
Count: But why do I always
have to sit in the middle?

773
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,750
> Perozzi: Look at the priest!

774
00:48:58,397 --> 00:48:59,748
Priest: But what's going on?

775
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:02,941
Don't you know, reverend? The Broom
Highway will pass through here.

776
00:49:03,013 --> 00:49:04,335
That way...

777
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,620
...and there will be a junction to
the eastern road. District's orders.

778
00:49:08,138 --> 00:49:09,828
Oh, my good Lord!

779
00:49:14,078 --> 00:49:16,588
Priest: Quick! Play the bells, faithful!

780
00:49:18,864 --> 00:49:20,389
(BELLS RING)

781
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:27,005
<Necchi: There! Look at that one!
<Melandri: Which one?

782
00:49:27,113 --> 00:49:30,095
<Necchi: The one who's bending
over. My god! What a knockout!

783
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:36,612
Alright, I'm looking,
however we're like savages.

784
00:49:37,092 --> 00:49:39,119
<We're looking at those women
as if they were objects...

785
00:49:39,196 --> 00:49:40,721
- like at the zoo!
- Are you telling me!

786
00:49:40,995 --> 00:49:43,331
My lover is a feminist.

787
00:49:43,677 --> 00:49:48,117
I've tried many times to convince myself
there's no difference between us...

788
00:49:48,429 --> 00:49:51,817
...speaking with her
of social problems...

789
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:55,318
- of haemorrhoids, of varicose veins.
- Professor, be serious for once!

790
00:49:55,794 --> 00:49:58,874
I said to myself so many times:
''Mascetti, we are the same''.

791
00:49:59,053 --> 00:50:03,494
And in fact, brains are all the same.

792
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:09,266
Then you look down to her breasts and
think: '' No, we're not the same''.

793
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,474
If they only were on the
back, those two big things!

794
00:50:13,784 --> 00:50:15,338
With those little nipples!

795
00:50:18,095 --> 00:50:20,672
- Like the one with the horsetail.
- Necchi: Where is she?

796
00:50:20,743 --> 00:50:23,320
<Sassaroli: On the left.
<Count: Stiff ass, let me pass!

797
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,035
- Mascetti: Shall we go eat? -
Count: Uh huh! - Perozzi: Alright.

798
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,683
Melandri: Shall we go to the Ramaiolo's
here or up to Biagio's, the pistoiese?

799
00:50:28,753 --> 00:50:31,533
As if I can make it to Pistoia!
I'll go to the Ramaiolo's.

800
00:50:31,604 --> 00:50:33,699
<Sassaroli: Just a moment, guys.
<Necchi: What?

801
00:50:33,777 --> 00:50:36,354
<Everybody: Oh, sure! One, two, three!

802
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,962
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

803
00:50:39,343 --> 00:50:41,680
Sassaroli: We're deciding
who's going to pay for you.

804
00:50:41,753 --> 00:50:42,835
- What was it, Necchi?
- Three.

805
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:44,703
Four and four is
eight, nine ten, eleven.

806
00:50:44,944 --> 00:50:49,289
Pay for me? But I'm a guest.

807
00:50:49,662 --> 00:50:52,954
- Everybody's guest. Let's go for a
collection. - Count: A collection? - Yes.

808
00:50:53,973 --> 00:50:55,932
Or "subscription", if you prefer so.

809
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:58,313
I'm not a beggar, understand?

810
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:02,217
Before I was 21, I had a waiter
dress me up and undress me.

811
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:06,084
Count Mascetti spent a three
and a half year honeymoon...

812
00:51:06,226 --> 00:51:08,833
...with his wife and a 6
feet tall bear on the leash.

813
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:12,738
Eighteen years ago, Count
Mascetti would have invited out...

814
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:14,636
...not only a bunch
of tramps like you...

815
00:51:14,712 --> 00:51:16,372
...but also all the workers there under.

816
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:19,320
And if the factory owner hadn't
agreed, I would have bought it.

817
00:51:19,498 --> 00:51:22,346
Is it clear? And now you want
to make a collection! Arsehole!

818
00:51:23,673 --> 00:51:26,077
I won't accept a crust
of cheese from you.

819
00:51:26,966 --> 00:51:29,060
I'll wait in the car. Eat well!

820
00:51:29,681 --> 00:51:32,973
- Perozzi: He's really angry!
- Sassaroli: Whatever, let's go.

821
00:51:34,569 --> 00:51:36,499
Sassaroli: After the noodles
with the duck sauce...

822
00:51:36,572 --> 00:51:40,095
- ...I'll have a skewer of liver the aretina way.
- Yes, but with fennels.

823
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:42,680
Perozzi: I'll have
grilled mushrooms, instead.

824
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:44,574
Melandri: I have seen someone
deliver huge mushrooms.

825
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:46,513
Then I'll have them as a start...

826
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:50,890
[Perozzi: He wasn't lying.
Mascetti ate up two fortunes:]

827
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:54,218
[...his own and his wife's.
Pride is all that's left to him.]

828
00:51:54,392 --> 00:51:57,645
[It's difficult to help him. He only
accepts tokens and some hospitality.]

829
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,084
[Because hospitality is
a rule among gentlemen.]

830
00:52:00,264 --> 00:52:02,436
[Moreover, he has a
personal idea of that...]

831
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,879
[...like two years ago,
when he lost his house.]

(DOOR KNOCKING)> Carmen: Mr.
Mascetti, may I? <Come in.

833
00:52:08,139 --> 00:52:12,376
Good morning. There's a telephone notice for
you. You should to call them back urgently.

834
00:52:13,536 --> 00:52:14,926
Oh, brioche and cappuccino!

835
00:52:14,995 --> 00:52:18,075
- A notice for me? Who can it be from?
- The public dormitory of Gavinana.

836
00:52:18,152 --> 00:52:19,407
Oh, the holidaymakers!

837
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:22,965
<Who knows what's happened?
I owe you a call, okay?

838
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:26,632
Oh! There have to be two cups. But
don't worry, I'll get the other one.

839
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:45,066
- Wanna know what your friend did?
- What.

840
00:52:45,272 --> 00:52:48,284
- He brought a whore to our house!
- A whore! He can't pay for a whore!

841
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:49,751
<Titti: Where is the bath?

842
00:52:51,314 --> 00:52:52,868
<Necchi: Sorry?
- The bath.

843
00:52:53,351 --> 00:52:56,845
Oh! I'll tell you at once. It's
not easy to explain. I have to...

844
00:52:56,983 --> 00:52:58,334
Down the corridor!

845
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,561
- How would you call someone like her?
- Her name is Titti.

846
00:53:01,633 --> 00:53:04,240
She's colonel Ambrosio's daughter.

847
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,838
She's been Mascetti's
lover for six months.

848
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:11,128

Public dormitory of Gavinana?

853
00:53:18,469 --> 00:53:22,099
I'm Count Mascetti. My wife should be
there. Could you put me through to her?

854
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:25,323
[Perozzi: He called his wife and
daughter '' the holidaymakers''...]

855
00:53:25,393 --> 00:53:28,067
[... because he had sent them
to his wife's hometown in May...]

856

[...and he still hadn't found
the money to bring them back.]

It's snowed, Lello, almost two feet.

858
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,777
What? You almost give me a heart
attack to tell me it snowed?

859
00:53:36,153 --> 00:53:39,001
That's good! So you and the
child will have some fun.

860
00:53:39,072 --> 00:53:40,829
> Alice: Yes right.
- Build a snowman with a pipe.

861

- How about the shoes and the
rest? > What about shoes now?

862
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:46,158
We only have summer shoes!

863
00:53:46,234 --> 00:53:48,435
But it's not only the shoes!
It's everything, Lello.

864
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:50,507
And how long will
Batacchi host us for free?

865

- Come on, it's only been two months.
> He hasn't been paid since July.

866
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:56,144
Come on! It's just a room
with the use of kitchen.

867
00:53:56,349 --> 00:54:00,616
Who uses the kitchen anymore! Lello,
the child can't make it as well...

> Alright, I'll get there and
fix everything. Don't worry.

869
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,304
Yes, but when will that be?

870
00:54:05,582 --> 00:54:09,781
Let me organize myself. I can't tell
you at once. Let's see how things go.

871
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,597
> Alright.

872
00:54:11,182 --> 00:54:12,804
In any case, I'll call you back.

873
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:15,049
Please, be strong. Understand?

874
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,185
And tell the child:
''Dad said to be strong''.

875
00:54:17,258 --> 00:54:19,700
> Yes, she's a good child. Have no worries...
- Talk to you later. Bye!

876
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,782
- What happened?
- That friend of yours. He said his wife...

877
00:54:23,232 --> 00:54:24,825
Did he? I'm going to fix that.

878
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,736
Thanks for your exquisite hospitality.

879
00:54:42,376 --> 00:54:44,442
- Necchi: Well? What about you?
- Count: The suitcase.

880
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:47,391
You don't understand!
This house is still yours.

881
00:54:47,502 --> 00:54:48,380
- Is it?
- Yep!

882
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,788
In my house I can have
guests. Here I can't.

883
00:54:50,862 --> 00:54:51,981
Then, this isn't my house.

884
00:54:52,118 --> 00:54:54,628
Stop being silly,
otherwise I'll get offended.

885
00:54:55,478 --> 00:54:58,423
- If it was up to me...
- Give me the suitcase.

886
00:54:58,737 --> 00:55:01,748
...but it's up to Carmen. Her
mentality is old-fashioned.

887
00:55:01,826 --> 00:55:05,591
Old-fashioned? That's shopkeeper's mentality!
And yours too. You're two tobacconists.

888
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:10,065
Anyways, never mind. We're still
friends, but each one to his house.

889
00:55:10,379 --> 00:55:12,378
[Perozzi: He meant my house, of course.]

890
00:55:14,486 --> 00:55:15,094
Dad!

891
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:18,795
<There's a naked woman in
my bed. Who the hell is she?

892
00:55:20,223 --> 00:55:21,478
I think it's Mascetti.

893
00:55:21,648 --> 00:55:24,525
Mascetti's a man. Will
you enlighten me, please?

894
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:28,943
You weren't there, she didn't know
where to go, I thought it was natural...

895
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,012
Everything is natural for you.

896
00:55:31,186 --> 00:55:32,808
However, I'll stay in a hotel.

897
00:55:32,985 --> 00:55:36,277
When you also find it natural
to free my room, let me know.

898
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,340
- Good night!
- Perozzi: Bye.

899
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:44,047
> Count: If you don't tell me what you
did at once, I throw the vitriol at you!

900
00:55:44,356 --> 00:55:48,188
> Titti: Drama is out of fashion!
You are the only man for me!

901
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:51,175
> Count: Titti, I can stand many
things, but don't fool me around!

902
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,757
> Titti: Who's fooling you
around? I am too busy for that.

903
00:55:53,826 --> 00:55:55,719
> Count: And don't read magazines
while I'm arguing with you!

904
00:55:55,795 --> 00:56:00,236
> I called you seven times. Where were you? Whore!
- I went riding.

905
00:56:00,547 --> 00:56:03,327
- Whom did you ride? Bitch!
- Perozzi: You'll wake up the whole building.

906
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,445
Sorry. But if she doesn't tell me
what she did from 4 to 8 o'clock...

907
00:56:06,589 --> 00:56:08,317
...I'll dismantle her! Where were you?

908
00:56:08,626 --> 00:56:11,338
- At school.
- But you said you went riding!

909
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,693
So what? I went to school then riding.

910
00:56:12,767 --> 00:56:15,141
- At 7 pm horses are sleeping!
<Perozzi: Shh! - Sorry.

911
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,668
<Maybe she went riding
first and then to school.

912
00:56:16,738 --> 00:56:18,832
I didn't go to school, nor riding!

913
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:21,652
You didn't? Then I'll kick
your arse and so you'll learn!

914
00:56:21,728 --> 00:56:22,847
Ugly faggot!

915
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,708
- Damn you! <Titti: Take this,
arsehole! <Perozzi: No! No!

916
00:56:26,887 --> 00:56:29,397
- Are you crazy?! Here!
- Titti: Ah!

917
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:31,909
<Count: Imbecile! <Perozzi:
No! Not Luciano's pipes!

918
00:56:31,978 --> 00:56:34,758
- He cares for them so much...
- She's hysterical! <Titti: Faggot!

919
00:56:35,373 --> 00:56:37,912
<Count: I'm going to kill you, you know?
- Titti: ... Here!

920
00:56:38,122 --> 00:56:42,766
- Ouch! Ouch! No! Not Luciano's file!
- Count: Okay, I'll forgive you!

921
00:56:44,062 --> 00:56:47,007
<Titti: I can come and go, go
out and back, I'll do what I want.

922
00:56:47,151 --> 00:56:48,367
> And see whom I want!

923
00:56:48,644 --> 00:56:51,492
- Again! > Count: Then why did
you swear I'm the only man for you?

924
00:56:51,564 --> 00:56:53,088
> Titti: Because it's true, silly!

925
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,344
> Count: Don't offend me! Or I'll...>
Titti: You what? > Count: I'll...

926
00:56:57,504 --> 00:56:59,463
> Count: Come here!
> Titti: Let go of me!

927
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:09,211
Hello, Melandri? Could
Mascetti stay at your place?

928
00:57:09,486 --> 00:57:11,213
In about fifteen minutes. Yes.

929
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:14,744
Because I'll kick both out in a minute.

930
00:57:17,089 --> 00:57:18,373
Perozzi: Bye, Titti.

931
00:57:21,433 --> 00:57:23,229
- Hey, how are you?
- Well.

932
00:57:26,797 --> 00:57:27,433
A litre.

933
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,415
A litre of gasoline.

934
00:57:34,094 --> 00:57:36,122
<Perozzi: Maybe it'll do.
Are you going very far?

935
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:39,896
Yes. Far enough to throw myself
from the bridge: myself, this car...

936
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:43,868
- ...my worries and all.
- Titti: Everything but me.

937
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:47,434
- What's wrong with you?
- Everything. Look!

938
00:57:48,995 --> 00:57:51,572
Debts, bills, protests, fines.

939
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,488
They even want me to pay
the taxes! Understand?

940
00:57:56,802 --> 00:57:59,003
And I still don't know if
she's betrayed me or not.

941
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:01,683
- She swore you're the only man for her.
- Yeah.

942
00:58:02,233 --> 00:58:04,810
Not to mention the
holidaymakers at Gavinana's.

943
00:58:05,797 --> 00:58:06,839
Poor things!

944
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,055
Those two poor saints.

945
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,581
Actually I'm the poor
thing here. I'm an arsehole.

946
00:58:15,878 --> 00:58:18,146
I've made such a mess of my life...

947
00:58:18,424 --> 00:58:20,692
Come on arsehole! I have
a class at three o'clock.

948
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:24,631
I got to go back to work too.

949
00:58:25,314 --> 00:58:29,147
- So, what is it you wanted? Can I help with a bill?
- No! No! No!

950
00:58:29,523 --> 00:58:31,280
You know I don't want any help!

951
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:35,462
You can repay me. What is it you
wanted? Why did you have me come down?

952
00:58:36,753 --> 00:58:39,330
- To know if I could count on a friend.
- And?

953
00:58:39,774 --> 00:58:42,245
Push the car, or the engine won't start.

954
00:58:44,832 --> 00:58:46,492
[Perozzi: Here is Mascetti.]

955
00:58:46,665 --> 00:58:49,069
[Penniless but a gentleman.
Cynical but passionate.]

956
00:58:49,278 --> 00:58:52,464
[Selfish but generous. Never
takes advantage. A real friend.]

957
00:58:52,842 --> 00:58:54,396
(ENGINE BURSTS)

958
00:59:44,606 --> 00:59:47,212
Excuse me, the girl who got in a
little while ago... what's her room?

959
00:59:47,287 --> 00:59:48,406
- Room 18.
- Thanks.

960
00:59:52,412 --> 00:59:54,237
<Doorman: Excuse me, tell me...
- What?

961
00:59:54,313 --> 00:59:57,972
Antani also for the manager,
the unhooded supercazzola.

962
00:59:58,047 --> 00:59:59,437
- What?
- To the right. For two.

963
00:59:59,982 --> 01:00:00,897
Aw!

964
01:00:09,248 --> 01:00:10,464
Titti: What do you want? Idiot!

965
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:13,859
Didn't I swear you were the only
man for me? Now what do you want?

966
01:00:19,058 --> 01:00:21,732
- I thought she would betray me with a man...
- Shh!

967
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,328
...not with a blonde girl!

968
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,437
- But what was she like?
- Beautiful!

969
01:00:25,779 --> 01:00:26,995
Better than Titti.

970
01:00:27,068 --> 01:00:29,984
Yes, because that coward
also chooses them beautiful.

971
01:00:32,533 --> 01:00:33,952
But I'll be honest.

972
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:37,513
- When I saw all those breasts and arses...
- Shh!

973
01:00:37,726 --> 01:00:38,363
...and thighs, right then, I felt sick.

974
01:00:43,089 --> 01:00:45,802
Her depravation, her vice. It was...

975
01:00:46,484 --> 01:00:47,603
To be honest,

976
01:00:48,385 --> 01:00:49,669
it made me sick.

977
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:57,985
- Did it?
- Everybody: Yes, yes!

978
01:00:59,246 --> 01:01:02,055
But where's the limit
between vice and normality?

979
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:06,032
<Everything is so uncertain. But one thing
for sure, I would have plunged into it.

980
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:07,865
- Me too!
- And you, Melandri?

981
01:01:10,312 --> 01:01:13,874
To be honest, considering that
similar occasions aren't so frequent...

982
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:18,692
...and a man's pride forces him to show
his virility to two women together...

983
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,474
...well, I would have plunged into it.
- See!

984
01:01:22,124 --> 01:01:24,933
- Then, I'm a jerk.
- Melandri: More or less.

985
01:01:25,077 --> 01:01:27,210
But maybe if you run you'll
still find them there.

986
01:01:31,832 --> 01:01:35,462
- No! Enough! It's over! Don't even mention...
- Necchi: Shh!

987
01:01:35,769 --> 01:01:37,323
(In a low voice) don't even mention it.

988
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,184
I'll rent a house, even
if it takes a bank robbery.

989
01:01:40,453 --> 01:01:43,098
The two holidaymakers have
to stop suffering, understand?

990
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:45,743
- And if you see me...
- Necchi: Shh!

991
01:01:45,816 --> 01:01:48,761
(in a low voice) with Titti again, spit on my face.
- Necchi: Okay.

992
01:01:48,837 --> 01:01:51,685
Where's the paper? Thanks.
Let's see what's for rent.

993
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:54,128
[Perozzi: A house for Mascetti.
Easier said than done!]

994
01:01:54,268 --> 01:01:55,928
[Even a pit was too expensive for him.]

995
01:01:56,101 --> 01:01:58,814
[And how could we help
him, given his character?]

996
01:01:58,952 --> 01:02:00,439
[We had to do it secretly.]

997
01:02:00,548 --> 01:02:02,304
[There was a basement he liked...]

998
01:02:02,381 --> 01:02:04,273
[...but that also was too much for him.]

999
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:05,633
[We made agreements
with the landlord...]

1000
01:02:05,707 --> 01:02:08,352
[...to give him the two thirds
of the rent under the counter.]

1001
01:02:08,796 --> 01:02:11,509
[He provided the furniture
himself.] Count: The dining room.

1002
01:02:13,107 --> 01:02:14,969
There's also room for
a guest, just in case.

1003
01:02:17,214 --> 01:02:18,401
The beds.

1004
01:02:18,945 --> 01:02:20,132
One, two, three.

1005
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:21,965
<There's also a deckchair.

1006
01:02:22,441 --> 01:02:23,472
A table...

1007
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,442
...and a closet. Beautiful,
ample, comfortable.

1008
01:02:27,261 --> 01:02:28,786
Here is the built-in wardrobe...

1009
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:31,671
...with the wall hooks, for
when we have something to hang.

1010
01:02:33,574 --> 01:02:34,414
A little kitchen...

1011
01:02:36,392 --> 01:02:37,511
...with a hand-washer.

1012
01:02:38,394 --> 01:02:39,745
And finally, excuse me...

1013
01:02:40,567 --> 01:02:41,242
...excuse me...

1014
01:02:43,112 --> 01:02:43,856
...the bath.

1015
01:02:45,658 --> 01:02:47,791
There's a separate toilet.
Outside, in the courtyard.

1016
01:02:50,139 --> 01:02:53,392
It's functional. Conventional
furnishing is out of fashion.

1017
01:02:53,804 --> 01:02:56,382
It's the modern style. Apparently
there's nothing, but there is everything.

1018
01:02:56,927 --> 01:02:59,572
Count: Apparently there's
everything, but there is nothing.

1019
01:02:59,744 --> 01:03:01,917
<Daughter: There's a heating system!

1020
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:03,915
That's the sewer system
of the whole building.

1021
01:03:04,055 --> 01:03:06,700

Me? How can you still be in the gang!

1323
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:26,231
[Perozzi: At the end of that day...]

1324
01:22:26,301 --> 01:22:29,728
[which was devoted to the contacts with the net,
the suppliers, the inside men, the distributors...]

1325
01:22:29,967 --> 01:22:31,965
[...we went for our booty.]

1326
01:22:32,173 --> 01:22:34,133
[Mr. Pettinelli had prepared it...]

1327
01:22:34,278 --> 01:22:37,492
[...he supplies dyestuff, paper shit...]

1328
01:22:37,706 --> 01:22:40,486
[...in short, things to have fun with.]

1329
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:45,001
<Pettinelli: Good evening. -
Hi. Is the stuff ready? - Yes.

1330
01:22:45,072 --> 01:22:46,098
Shh!

1331
01:22:55,933 --> 01:22:56,812
- Hi!
- Hi!

1332
01:23:00,652 --> 01:23:03,460
Melandri: The police!
There's a police car!

1333
01:23:08,357 --> 01:23:09,747
To the right! Headlights off!

1334
01:23:09,816 --> 01:23:12,529
- And the password must disappear!
- Good, Righi!

1335
01:23:12,599 --> 01:23:14,424
- Swallow!
- Necchi: Well!

1336
01:23:18,573 --> 01:23:20,330
Why me? He's the one who wrote it down!

1337
01:23:20,508 --> 01:23:24,071
I already have a chewing-gum in my mouth.
And since when should I eat leftovers?

1338
01:23:26,822 --> 01:23:27,723
For you.

1339
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:29,583
For you.

1340
01:23:30,318 --> 01:23:31,303
For you.

1341
01:23:31,404 --> 01:23:32,438
<For me.

1342
01:23:32,558 --> 01:23:33,665
<For you.

1343
01:23:33,814 --> 01:23:35,044
<For you.

1344
01:23:35,273 --> 01:23:37,357
<For you. For me.

1345
01:23:37,785 --> 01:23:39,204
The last million...

1346
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,563
...is for me...

1347
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:45,351
...because I'm the boss. Is it all right?

1348
01:23:45,558 --> 01:23:47,585
- How about a coffee? Righi?
- No!

1349
01:23:47,765 --> 01:23:49,357
Then, I declare the meeting closed.

1350
01:23:50,785 --> 01:23:54,753
Perozzi: # Beautiful daughter
of love. Plon plon plon. #

1351
01:23:55,504 --> 01:23:57,463
<Necchi: Twenty thousand per score?

1352
01:23:57,676 --> 01:23:59,163
At least tell me how I went.

1353
01:23:59,339 --> 01:24:01,878
How did the noob go?

1354
01:24:02,021 --> 01:24:03,845
Not bad, for a first timer.

1355
01:24:04,057 --> 01:24:06,528
What? How dare you say ''not bad''?

1356
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:09,886
<Perozzi: Something against Fox's Paw?

1357
01:24:10,201 --> 01:24:12,537
Do you call him Fox's
Paw? (RIGHI LAUGHS)

1358
01:24:12,713 --> 01:24:13,552
Yes, why?

1359
01:24:13,901 --> 01:24:16,411
Righi, what have I
done to you? I love you.

1360
01:24:16,548 --> 01:24:17,938
Don't make me speak, please!

1361
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:21,054
<Melandri: If you've got
something to say, spit it out.

1362
01:24:21,911 --> 01:24:22,818
What has he done?

1363
01:24:23,473 --> 01:24:25,229
Nevermind. Forget it.

1364
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:29,404
My friend, in this
field money is easy...

1365
01:24:30,058 --> 01:24:32,771
...but to behave well is difficult,
and we pay for our mistakes.

1366
01:24:33,113 --> 01:24:36,095
So? Shall we keep him or kill him?

1367
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:40,200
Let's ask the boss. The
decision is only up to him.

1368
01:24:44,483 --> 01:24:46,414
(SUDDEN BRAKING) Perozzi: Hood off!

1369
01:24:48,964 --> 01:24:49,774
Then, boss?

1370
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:58,058
Sassaroli: Better alive.
One more gun is better.

1371
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,887
The Marseillaise are back.

1372
01:25:00,199 --> 01:25:01,724
Damn it! I knew it.

1373
01:25:01,794 --> 01:25:03,657
Right when we were
starting with the province.

1374
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:04,984
They don't joke.

1375
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:06,164
Sassaroli: Guys...

1376
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:10,273
...hold on. Starting tomorrow,
the province is ours.

1377
01:25:11,095 --> 01:25:14,078
<This is the good time
to definitely slash them.

1378
01:25:14,421 --> 01:25:15,097
But who?

1379
01:25:15,507 --> 01:25:18,626
Perozzi: Didn't you
hear? The Marseillaise!

1380
01:25:18,698 --> 01:25:20,117
Our enemies. They're tough ones.

1381
01:25:20,192 --> 01:25:22,393
- Like marble. <Melandri: Merciless.

1382
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,060
- For you. To repay you for the danger.
- Okay, boss.

1383
01:25:26,437 --> 01:25:28,638
- For you and for you.
- Count: No problem, boss.

1384
01:25:29,798 --> 01:25:30,541
<And for you...

1385
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:33,087
...this!

1386
01:25:34,176 --> 01:25:35,363
Try to deserve it.

1387
01:25:35,941 --> 01:25:40,421
Next time you'll also get part of
the booty, if you're still alive.

(SASSAROLI LAUGHS)

1389
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,881
- Good luck! -
Perozzi: Hood on! - Yes.

1390
01:25:57,054 --> 01:25:58,878
No, Titti, not even tonight.

1391
01:25:59,124 --> 01:26:01,460
Nope. Why? Because I'm busy, no?

1392
01:26:01,602 --> 01:26:03,398
Yes, yes, I have to beat the province.

1393
01:26:03,775 --> 01:26:05,869
I don't know. I don't know till when.

1394

busy, he's busy, alright?

In the river! No, not that one...

- Count: I know...

same, one white, one black.

accomplished! 85 millions.

- Righi: At last.

up the Marseillaise.

only one to stay down?

Necchi: You've seen
how dangerous they are!

Perozzi: And then, we are
lost souls, hardened criminals.

...at your age.
- Drugs kill.

Necchi: Our inside men
also sell it to the minor.

1424
01:28:37,571 --> 01:28:38,690
I don't care.

1425
01:28:38,759 --> 01:28:40,486
They give it to school children.

1426
01:28:40,558 --> 01:28:43,608
My conscience is clear.
I just obey the orders.

1427
01:28:44,122 --> 01:28:46,294
Nothing more. And then,
you say it's drugs...

1428
01:28:48,263 --> 01:28:50,328
Maybe... But to me, it's sugar!

Yes, he's right.

1430

That's the way to be: disgusting,
cynical. Like this old fart here.

five of us to share the cake.

You deserved your piece.

1435
01:29:13,415 --> 01:29:16,629
Well, it was about time! You've
shared the cake for 25 days now...

1436
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:19,928
...and I haven't seen anything.
You shared 312 million...

1437
01:29:20,203 --> 01:29:21,661
...and I didn't even get a cent!

1438

they've tricked us!

What a pity, right when
you would get your share.

The other days there was
and today there isn't!

Yet I've always risked
my life like all of you.

(Altered) Like you, like him,
this idiot, this imbecile!

The other times you got the
millions, then take them out now!

- I want your share!
- But why?

1449
01:29:48,987 --> 01:29:53,534
Why do you treat me so,
why? Me, who have always...

1450
01:29:53,705 --> 01:29:56,688
...felt a certain passion for
you. I don't even know why.

1451
01:29:56,862 --> 01:29:59,778
You don't know why? He looks
exactly like your poor dad.

Two drops of water!

1454
01:30:03,956 --> 01:30:08,021
Yes! That's why: he's my
poor father's portrait!

1455
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:13,053
Daddy, if I had met you earlier
I wouldn't have come so down!

1456
01:30:13,426 --> 01:30:15,424
- Piss off!
- Don't treat me so, dad!

1457

- Necchi: That's not the way to treat your son.
- Count: Dad!

Righi: I'm not your dad! Let go of me.

1459
01:30:19,298 --> 01:30:21,905
Do you think I want a stupid
child like you? Go away!

Count: Oh! Dad, you hit my balls!

1461
01:30:23,643 --> 01:30:25,535
And now, here! Find another!

1462
01:30:32,265 --> 01:30:33,654
We'll never find someone like him!

force us to kill you!

- Melandri: You can't break these chains!

1466
01:30:47,335 --> 01:30:48,146
But where are you going?

1467
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:51,405
- Where the fuck are you going?
- Shh!

1468
