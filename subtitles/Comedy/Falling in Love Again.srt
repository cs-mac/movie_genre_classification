-Aren't you cold?

00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,126
-Sharpens the mind.

4
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,429
-Even if contemporary people
deny it,

5
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:17,366
even if they ridicule
Christianity,

6
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:21,668
modern culture was built
on this moral law.

7
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,867
And our hunger for
the certainty of this law,

8
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,875
for a spiritual anchor,

9
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:32,884
for an immutable, eternal truth
is proof... of it's existence.

10
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,884
Especially now,

11
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,388
after a few decades of
relativistic situational ethics,

12
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,891
our society is tired
of constant change.

13
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,892
And as we approach
the millennium...

-Transformations are
a basic staple of mythology.

15
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:52,903
Transformations from human form
to animal forms and vice-versa;

16
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,408
of gods into humans
and humans into gods;

17
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:02,447
of wind into blood,

18
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,948
flesh into water,

19
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,450
ugliness into beauty.

20
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:11,455
The human need for change,
progress, movement,

21
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,458
is reflected
in the ancient stories,

22
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:18,963
which are told over and over
again in different forms.

Okay, uh, Chapter 12
for Thursday. Thanks.

26
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,810
l was wondering if you could
help me with something.

27
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,074
-Of course, Professor Bergin.
What with?

28
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,583
-Uh, well, I have to prepare
a speech on very short notice.

29
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,084
-What speech?

30
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,587
-Well, it's just
the keynote address

31
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,089
to the lnternational
Theologians' Conference

32
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,091
in Chicago.

33
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,594
-Professor Bergin...

34
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,095
That's wonderful!

35
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,097
-Yeah, it is!

36
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,394
So...

37
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,233
Let's do something exciting
tonight, huh?

38
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:04,241
-Yeah, something really crazy.

39
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,038
-Okay...
-Hey, remember, Martin,

Calvinists are not supposed
to have sex standing up.

to dancing.

-Camille. Martin.
-Reverend.

43

-If you have time, I'd like
to meet with you later today.

44
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,722
Four o'clock in my office?
-Sure, Reverend.

45
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,852
-And don't book anything
immediately after.

46
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,228
I'd like for us
not to be disturbed.

47
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:37,340
-Hugh really is brilliant,
you know, Bob?

48
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,910
Bob?

00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,381
Bob?

Ah no...

Oh no!

Bob, come!

Bob? We went over this,
remember?

54
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,557
"Come" means "come here".

55
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,328
Oh, Tillie.

00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,336
-I'm 47.

57
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,339
-Yeah, that's great.
But have you seen my dog?

58
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,342
-Ah yes, he walked by here
about half an hour ago.

59
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,343
I remember because
it was the first time

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,345
I'd seen him without you.

61
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,349
He was charging along like he
had an appointment or something.

62
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,850
Thatta way.
-Thank you.

63
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,854
-Don't you love it the way dogs
sometimes get this look

64
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,458
like they got a hectic schedule
to follow? Busy, busy!

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,262
-Bob...

66
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,964
-Are you all right?

67
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,072
-My dog just died.

68
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,107
-Oh. I'm sorry.

69
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,301
-I loved him so much.

70
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,537
It's pathetic, really.

71
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,911
-No. No, it's not pathetic.

72
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,577
It's, uh... Animals love you
in a way people can't.

73
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,591
So uncomplicated,
really, you know?

74
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:23,066
Whether you're successful
or not, or ugly or beautiful...

-Yeah. Thanks.

-Oh... It's okay, it's okay.

How did he die?

79
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,445
-I don't know.

80
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,574
I don't get it.

81
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,277
He... he wasn't that old...

00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:47,590
He just snuck away and...

83

I found him in an alley.

84
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,623
And you know what?
I realized that...

85
00:08:53,766 --> 00:09:00,433
I loved him more than anything,
anyone, I'm suppose to love.

86

Oh, dear...

-So?
-And I've lost mine.

-Martin, this is the era
of the individual, remember?

124
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,120
You've got to stop worrying

00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,748
about other people's opinion
of you.

126

Okay? Let's go.

127
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,074
-But if I do take their offer,

128
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,336
we'll need someone else
to fill the role

of chaplain.

130

An appropriate successor
would concern me... greatly.

131
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,709
-Well, chaplain certainly is
a very exciting position,

132
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,719
especially in these times.

133
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,721
I'm sure you'll have
lots of takers.

134
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,689
-It's not takers we need,
it's givers.

135
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:19,059
-It was just a manner
of speaking.

136
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,758
-And of course, whoever took
the position would have

137
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,269
to be beyond reproach, for
the more conservative element

138
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,305
of our college constituancy.

139
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,032
We have to remember
that not long ago,

140
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,609
we were still debating
whether or not

141
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,609
Christians could use
rock 'n' roll

142
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,647
to convey a godly message.

143
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,118
-Remember when old Mrs. Lindow
said that...

144
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,018
all rock 'n' roll led
to sexual intercourse,

145
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,022
because the music...

146
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,128
no, it was the rhythm
of the music matched

147
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,163
the rhythm of the contractions
of an orgasm.

148
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,348
-lt's easy to laugh,

149
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,477
but we have to remember that
Mrs. Lindow is as much a member

150
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,750
of God's flock as anyone else.

151
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,052
-Yeah.

152
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,101
-All I'm trying to say is
that...

153
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,671
the chaplainship of the college
could well go to a man

154
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,104
and woman, together.

155
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,609
And as one of our star
theologians, Martin,

156
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,043
you're more than qualified.

157
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,910
And Camille, your book
on Christian ethics,

158
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,243
your student counselling
last year

159
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,717
and your general behaviour
as a fine Christian woman

160
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:52,813
make you a credit to the college
and to the faith. But...

161
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,927
if we were to hire
a man-and-woman team,

162
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,926
they could not be suspected
to be...

163
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:03,228
to be indulging in the physical
pleasures of marriage

164
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,270
without actually being
married...

165
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,433
even if their sexual relations

166
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,342
were very much in the closet,
as it were.

167
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,313
-Well, we're both...

168
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,850
very committed to each other.

169
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,825
Well, you want to skip
the restaurant, then?

170
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,327
-Well, in fact,
I should get some grading done.

171
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,829
-Yeah. I don't really know

172
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,332
what I'm going to speak about
yet anyway.

173
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,333
-No?

174
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,335
-You sure you're going
to be okay about Bob?

175
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,838
-Sure.

176
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,340
-Okay.

177
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,875
Bye, then.

178
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,880
-Bye.

179
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,328
-Easy, easy. What is this?!

180
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,333
[ background chatter]

181
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,619
-Excuse me.

182
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,623
[ a woman ]: Okay, next!

183
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,127
-I'm sorry,
I'm looking for, uh...

184
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,469
-What do you do?

185
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,903
-Uh, I teach mythology.

186
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,736
-That's new. And?

187
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,741
-And I'm just looking
for someone.

188
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,277
-And what happens?

189
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,239
-This is funny.

190
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,010
I'm not an acting person.

191
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,285
I have her laundry, you see?
Petra Soft?

192
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:52,159
-Oh, I see,
you have her laundry.

193
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,993
Uh... she's right over there.

194
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,192
-Thanks.

195
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,462
-Timothy?

196
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,401
Are you gonna look at these?

197
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,598
We don't wanna have
to call them back.

198
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,107
-Honey, I'll be with you
when I'm free.

199
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:09,146
Right now, however,
I am... occupied.

200
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,809
-Right. You're occupied...

201
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,021
Okay, next!

202
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,035
-Okay, Tim, can we bring in
a third one?

203
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:16,375
-Unfortunately, I only have
two hands available, you know?

204
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,380
-Does that mean "no"?
-Uh-huh.

205
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,882
-Excuse me...

206
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,542
Can I talk to you for a moment?

207
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,952
-Oh, yeah. Uh... Tim,
could we call it a night?

208
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,955
-Uh, Petra,
before we call it a night,

209
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,185
I have an idea I'd like to try,

210
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,422
and my idea is...

211
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,499
Uh... Okay, it's a night.
It's a night, go.

212
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,036
-Hello.
-Hi.

213
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,470
-Uh... A funny thing happened.

214
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,473
l don't know if you've checked
your laundry yet,

215
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,737
but I think we did a switcheroo

216
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,745
by mistake.
-A switcheroo, yeah.

217
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:53,647
I did realize that. How are you?

218
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:57,881
Are you feeling better?
-Oh, yeah, yeah. Much better.

219
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,321
I... I wanted to thank you...

220
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,154
[ all ]: Ah...

221
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,159
[ Timothy ]: Shit!
[ Tory ]: Timothy!

222
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,025
[ Timothy ]: Marcus!
[ Tory ]: Don't panic, everyone.

223
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,463
Perhaps the electricity is
a little too much to ask for...

224
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,297
[ Timothy ]: Why do I have
to do everything myself?!

225
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,837
-Come back to my trailer.
I've got your stuff there.

226
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,875
-Don't worry, honey,
I'm getting it fixed.

227
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,240
-''Don't worry, honey''...

228
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,008
That's what you said just before
the tent went up in flames!

229
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,140
-One small fire and
I'm responsible every time

230
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,150
some little problem...

231
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,187
Just keep your hair
on your head!

232
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,482
-Thanks, I will.

233
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,585
-So my name's Petra, by the way.
-Yeah, I saw that on your card.

234
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,597
And mine is Camille Bak...
Camille.

235
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,600
-Camille. That's nice.
I like it.

236
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,603
It's like 'come here'.
It's nice.

237
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,139
[ loud growling ]

238
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,940
-Hey, Petra!

239
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,382
-Shut up, Jim.

240
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,613
So your accent,
is that from Quebec?

241
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,723
-Yeah, originally from Quebec.

242
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:10,123
But my father was a minister,
so I moved around a lot.

243
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,822
-Well, this is my house.

244
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,179
-Oh, well...

245
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,579
This is really... nifty.

246
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,583
-Yeah, I like it.

247
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,587
I wanna do that wall in some
kind of fun-fur and slate

248
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,851
or something,
but slate's really expensive.

249
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,857
-Yeah. Well...

250
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,859
here's your laundry.

251
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,725
-Oh, right.

252
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,668
So, uh, can you join me
for a scotch?

253
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:56,831
-Oh, l'm not much of a drinker,
really.

254
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,040
-And some music.
'Cause without music,

255
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,274
life would be a mistake.

256
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,416
-So, I have a confession
to make.

257
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,322
I wore one of your tops.

258
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,622
You know, the one
with the zipper?

259
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,129
-Really?

260
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,165
-A school teacher
at a Christian college

261
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,633
has to get her kicks somehow.

262
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,638
It did make me feel a little...

263
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,607
racy, for a while.

264
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,305
-I'm sure it looked great
on you.

265
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,181
Your man must've liked it.

266
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,582
-What man?

267
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,758
-Oh... I just thought, you know,

268
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,089
someone as beautiful as you are
would, uh...

269
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:54,756
-Oh, well...

270
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,834
-You have an exquisite mouth,
you know.

271
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,740
-I do?

272
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,825
-I have a confession
to make too, actually.

273
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:28,263
I did the, uh, switcheroo
on purpose.

274
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,766
-Why?

275
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:35,032
-I wanted to see you again.

276
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,040
-Why?

277
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,668
-I don't know. You moved me.

278
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,146
-Because I was so pathetic,
I suppose?

279
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:51,551
-No. No, I can't explain.

280
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,988
Um... I'm sorry if
that's embarrassing.

281
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,457
-No. No, I mean, I...

282
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:02,628
I think you were... really...
very tender,

283
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,702
at the Laundromat.

284
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,429
You touched me.

285
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,834
-I wanted to.

286
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,848
Camille, I'd love to see you
in the moonlight

287
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,547
with your head thrown back
and your body on fire.

288
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,555
-Okay.

289
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,361
That was uncalled for.

290
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,763
-True. But if you wait
for what's called for,

291
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,530
usually nothing happens, so...
-Well, I am clearly

292
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,764
a bit out of my element here.

293
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,273
Can I have my... my laundry?

294
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,274
-No. No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

295
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,276
Sit down. I was just...

296
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,779
-I must be fun to shock
or something.

297
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,941
-It's true, you are, but I...

298
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,984
-Well, I'm nobody's fool.
-No.

299
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,921
No, no, no. Of course you're
not. I'm the fool. I'm sorry.

300
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,855
I...
-Can I have my laundry?

301
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,358
-So you're a school teacher,
huh?

302
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,395
-My laundry. Please.

303
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,302
Thank you.

304
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,878
[ Tory ]: lf the foundation
money comes through,

305
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:27,109
we might be all right.
We might be able to squeeze by.

306
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,981
But what do you mean,
good authority?

307
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,883
Did you talk to the foundation
yourself?

308
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,389
'Cause if the money doesn't come
through this time, I don't--

309
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,586
Timothy...
-That is the problem here.

310
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,788
-I swear to God,
I've just about had it.

311
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,162
If I'd known it was gonna be
like this, I would've--

312
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,735
-What? What, gone back
to your racoon act?

313
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,498
-Don't start that.
It was a good idea.

314
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,471
-Yeah, racoons.

315
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,975
-How was I suppose to know
they were so selfish?

316
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,708
-You know, I think maybe
it's this fuse here.

317
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,106
-How did you find me?

318
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,508
-There aren't 20 Christian
colleges

319
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:12,013
with someone named Camille
teaching here.

320
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,516
Listen, I wanted to, uh...

321
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,916
apologize for being
so aggressive

322
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:17,851
last night.

323
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,219
l don't know anyone here,

324
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,053
and I just...

325
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,065
-Come.

326
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,586
-Let's go.

327
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,702
You look great.
-Thanks.

328
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,168
[ laughing ]

329
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:50,103
-That's good! Most impressive!

330
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,608
So, we've covered abortion,
church and state,

331
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,612
predestination, drug abuse,
prostitution...

332
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,615
Ah yes, homosexuality.

333
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,719
How do approach
the homosexuality problem,

334
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:05,050
Camille?

335
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:11,924
-Well, uh... I'm not really sure
I'd consider it a problem.

336
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,554
-Honey, what you said at Tom's.
Camille said that

337
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,691
it's important to love
the sinner but hate the sin,

338
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:21,202
so that, uh... you're allowed
to feel the desire

339
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,706
but not act on that desire.

340
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:27,208
-Well, in heteros...
in retrospect, sorry,

341
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:32,146
I've come to think that there's
a lot of room for multiplicity

342
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,251
in God's creation.

343
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,549
-You are aware that
that is contrary to doctrine

344
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,555
in this matter?

345
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,717
-God... God cannot be so cruel

346
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,763
as to decree that people
like... like that...

347
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,367
can never, ever be contented.

348
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:54,232
I mean, one's devotions

349
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,703
are not entirely chosen.

350
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,367
-But the Bible. I mean, there
isn't one condoning passage

351
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,705
in the entire Bible.
Not to mention

352
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,711
that every other holy book
of every major religion

353
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,679
opposes homosexuality.

354
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,785
-I know, yes.

355
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,183
-As a chaplain,
how would you counsel

356
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,516
a young Christian
who came to you

357
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,522
and said that he was struggling

358
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,593
with his desires
for another man?

359
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,094
-Well, I...

360
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,095
I would try to determine
whether sh...

361
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,632
he is reacting out of, uh...

362
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:31,106
Uh, it's a very controversial
issue, as you well know,

363
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:34,609
and I don't claim to have it
all worked out.

364
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,611
I don't know.

365
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:40,115
-But you do acknowledge
that this institution

366
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,185
and the book upon which
this institution is based

367
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,225
characterize homosexual acts
as unnatural and sinful.

368
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,259
And as chaplain, you'd have
to support this doctrine.

369
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,760
-Of course.

370
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,363
-Camille?

371
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,292
-Yes.

372
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,405
-Are you okay?

373
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,015
-Yeah. Yes, l'm fine.

374
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,983
-The reverend wants to see you
in his office.

375
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,989
-I don't really want to talk
to him right now. It's just...

376
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,286
-I know what's going on,
you know.

377
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,192
-You do?

378
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:32,592
-It's okay. I understand...
I think.

379
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,635
-You do?

380
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,966
-Camille, you've been saying
the same thing

381
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,631
about a million different ways.

382
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:41,905
The buying of the top,

383
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,412
talking about orgasms
in front of a reverend,

384
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:48,849
and now this almost-sabotage
of the interview...

385
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:52,422
-What am I saying?

386
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,422
-That this pressure for us
to get married

387
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,426
just forthe sake of a job
feels like a sham.

388
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,928
You don't want to be
this career Christian

389
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:04,626
who just does what she's told.
And you know what?

390
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,963
-What?

391
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,470
-Maybe it's a blessing
in disguise.

392
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,571
We've been together
for almost three years.

393
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,809
Maybe we're just being cowards.

394
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,853
-You think so?

395
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,751
-Yes.

396
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,591
I love you, Camille Baker.

397
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:34,596
Oh, I love you more
than anything.

398
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,962
Any job, anything.

399
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,331
And maybe you can...

400
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,133
imagine more intoxicating
options...

401
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,242
but it's okay.

402
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,435
It's what imaginations are for.

403
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:51,213
-Oh, Martin...

404
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,390
-Let's not wait any longer.

405
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:06,019
Just marry me, whether we take
this job or not, okay?

406
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:10,123
I-I still have to think, Martin.
I...

407
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:20,129
-All right, take five everyone!

408
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,164
-I'll be back in a second.

409
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,376
-What were you doing
at the school?

410
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,569
Are you stalking me
or something?

411
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:38,739
-I'm sorry if I threw you
by showing up.

412
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,283
I mean, to interrupt
you and your man.

413
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,254
-That's what I came
to talk to you about.

414
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,255
Petra, uh...

415
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:52,328
What happened this morning...
was an aberration.

416
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:55,261
-Of course.

417
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:59,426
-So, don't think that I'm a...

418
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,401
-Oh, I won't, I won't.

419
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,006
-I'm sorry I lied.

420
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,007
I think I was just flattered
by your attention but I'm not...

421
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,940
I'm not really like that.

422
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,979
-Okay.

423
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:16,416
Well... it was nice meeting you.

424
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,523
-Well, I mean, we could,
you know...

425
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,490
-What? We could... could what?

426
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,618
-Well, don't people like you
just have friends,

427
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,196
sometimes?

428
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:30,027
-Yes, people like me do.

429
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,964
-And...

430
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,003
why couldn't I be one?

431
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,775
-I'm attracted to you, Camille.

432
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,877
-It's okay, but...

433
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,501
It's okay.

434
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,511
We're not animals.

435
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:48,414
We don't always have to act
on our attractions. I mean...

436
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:56,425
-What would we do... as friends?

437
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,586
-Have fun.
-Fun.

438
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,722
Sounds like a buddy movie.
-Yes, exactly.

439
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:06,633
Like Thelma and Louise.

440
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,467
But without the guns.

441
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,632
-Oh, well, no guns...

442
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,176
I don't know, I don't know.

443
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,150
-Well... I don't have
any classes

444
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,651
this afternoon.

445
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,653
-Oh.

446
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,282
I had something planned.

447
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,692
Uh... I suppose you could
tag along.

448
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,162
-What?

449
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,791
-Will you accept
to be surprised?

450
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,526
-Hey, Petra!
-Yeah.

451
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,127
-You must be kidding.
-Huh-huh. You'll love it.

452
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,296
You'll love it, Camille!

453
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,374
It's fucking mind-blowing,
I promise you.

454
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,477
I've done it like
three million times.

455
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,478
You have to try it.
-Can I see your rating, please?

456
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,013
-Oh, yeah. Here.

457
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:30,785
-Okay. I'll need a number,
in case there's a problem.

458
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,786
-What kind of problem?

459
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,289
-Don't worry, it's just
a formality.

460
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,792
-Thanks.

461
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,793
-You have to try it, Camille.

462
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,795
How will you know
if you don't try it?

463
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,333
-Well, I haven't tried shooting
myself in the head either...

464
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,805
Just one question, Petra...

465
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,807
Why?
-Why?

466
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,809
-Why?
-Why? Because...

467
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,210
Because fear is what you pay
for adventure, Camille.

468
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,113
-Petra...

469
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,119
If you wanna do this, like,
the wind is perfect right now.

470
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,120
But night's falling,
you better hurry.

471
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,623
-Exactly. You hear him?
-What?

472
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:11,751
You think I should kill myself
because it's getting dark?

473
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:15,059
-Don't be such a wuss.

474
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,134
-Okay.

475
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:23,605
Okay, Petra, this is all very
poetic and everything but...

476
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,902
no, really, I'll watch.

477
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,530
-Woooo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

478
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:27,294
You have to ride with the wind,
not against. Do you feel it?

479
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,339
-l feel it and I hate it!

480
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,308
-Look at that!

481
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,023
-Oh, dear...

482
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:52,219
-Sorry. Whoa!

483
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:53,887
Hang on.

484
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,905
Shit!

485
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,872
Camille, you're really
throwing me off.

486
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,844
Wake up, Camille!

487
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:16,618
Wake up!

488
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,597
Oh, gosh...

489
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,075
Oh, God, are you okay?
-Oh...

490
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,076
-What?
-I hit my knee on something.

491
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,078
-What, your knee, is it fucked?
-I don't know.

492
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,080
-Oh, shit! Where's the guy?

493
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,082
We should get you
to a hospital, okay?

494
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,084
-No, no, no, it's okay.

495
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:53,086
-Oh, I shouldn't have
pushed you to do it.

496
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:55,589
I'm such a fucking
steamroller sometimes.

497
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,591
I haven't done it that many
times. I'm so...

498
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,253
I'm sorry.
-lt's okay.

499
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,093
lt's okay. lt's okay.

500
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,574
But I did it, didn't l?

501
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,111
[ They laugh. ]

502
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,117
How does it feel?
-It hurts.

503
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:25,187
-It helps to swear.

504
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,125
-It hurts like a fuck.

505
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,063
-You know, you probably strained
some other muscles.

506
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,100
Here, roll over.

507
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,604
Good.

508
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,953
-Hmm, it's very, uh...

509
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,080
healing.

510
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,763
-So, what do you teach?

511
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,266
-Mythology.

512
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:15,769
-What, like Zeus
and Cupid and stuff?

513
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:17,771
-And stuff, yes.

514
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,933
They're beautiful
stories.

515
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:24,673
-So tell me a story.

516
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:29,809
-Cupid, for instance,
was a god who fell in love

517
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,615
with a beautiful mortal, Psyche.

518
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,758
Now, this was a big taboo,

519
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:41,797
you see, because, uh...
gods and mortals

520
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,127
were not allowed to mix.

521
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:47,601
So, uh,

522
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:53,108
Cupid stole her away
to a secret palace...

523
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,575
-Where they made fabulous love.

524
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,010
-Mm-hm.

525
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:03,553
But Cupid wouldn't let Psyche
see him.

526
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,087
They only made love in the dark.

527
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,217
Until, uh...

528
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,598
until...

529
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,273
This makes me nervous.

530
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,569
-Me too.

531
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,610
I think it's supposed to.

532
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:34,081
So then what happens?

533
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:37,085
-Then, uh...

534
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,086
[ doorbell ringing ]

535
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,589
Shit! God... Sorry.

536
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,124
-The boyfriend.

537
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,797
[ Camille ]: Hello?

538
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:50,491
-Hello. Camille, it's Reverend
DeBoer. Can I come up?

539
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,159
-Uh... Okay...

540
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,202
Oh, you-you're gonna have to,
uh...

541
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,972
-I am not gonna climb out
the window.

542
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,978
What's the problem?

543
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:08,380
We're just buddies, right?
You haven't done anything wrong.

544
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:17,827
-Sorry, Reverend.
Please, come up.

545
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:23,524
Okay, uh... Sorry.

546
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:28,495
I met you at the Laundromat

547
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,504
and we just switched laundry.
You know?

548
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,006
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

549
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,109
-Coming!

550
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,508
Oh... Hi, Reverend.

551
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,547
-Good evening.
-Come in.

552
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:45,216
This is Petra.
Um, l met her at the Laundromat,

553
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,755
quite... randomly,

554
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:50,018
and we switched

555
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,152
laundry by mistake.
Just one of those things,

556
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:57,700
you know? And she just came back
to return mine.

557
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:00,598
And this is Reverend DeBoer,

558
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,035
the chaplain at the college...

559
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:06,540
where l teach.

560
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,669
-Enchanted.

561
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,747
-How do you do?

562
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:14,077
-Um...

563
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:17,186
Well, Petra,

564
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,482
thank you for returning
my clothes and, uh...

565
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:23,423
it was nice meeting you.

566
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,107
-Well, I hope that you can make
some time for me in the future?

567
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,143
-Yes, uh...

568
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,045
Reverend?

569
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,185
Reverend...

570
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,414
Reverend, I'm sorry.

571
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,149
I'm sorry.

572
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,157
She's just a street kid,

573
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:59,888
quite disturbed, really.

574
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:04,399
And I can't seem
to get herto leave.

575
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,028
I flattered myself to think

576
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,037
that I could teach her
something.

577
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:14,371
-Well, you do what you have to,
Camille, but we have to talk.

578
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,969
-Sure. I'll come around
tomorrow.

579
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,418
Petra?

580
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,663
I love you.

581
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,187
Why don't you just tell them
you're sick?

582
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,723
-I'm not,
and l gave them my word.

583
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,730
-I like this new, uh... you,
though.

584
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,101
See you Monday.
-Goodbye.

585
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:48,708
[ knocking ]

586
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,472
-Ahem!

587
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:55,710
Ahem... Petra, uh...

588
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:57,717
I think I should tell you

589
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,152
we may have to
leave here very soon.

590
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,883
-Why?
-Well, unfortunately,

591
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:05,324
I think they are going
to call in the loan,

592
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,053
and then they will want to take

593
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:11,462
the trucks and the equipment
and before I let that happen,

594
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:15,765
I will make very sure
that we, uh, run away.

595
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:22,339
Maybe very soon. I don't know.

596
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:33,113
Petra...

597
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,724
you're not thinking
of jumping ship, are you?

598
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,723
Because, uh...

599
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,624
Well, because, uh...

600
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:43,129
-No, No.

601
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,666
Of course not.

602
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:49,169
-Are you very serious
about this girl?

603
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:55,141
-Oh, I don't know.

604
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:58,577
I think she might, you know,
just be experimenting.

605
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,013
I don't know.

606
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,950
You know, all good things go
eventually.

607
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:09,525
-Yes, but, uh...

608
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:12,025
but for you, Petra,

609
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:14,220
what does it mean for you?

610
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,071
Oh...

611
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,935
Come here.

612
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,476
It's okay.

613
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:54,094
-You knew we didn't get it.
Why didn't you tell me?

614
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,102
I've been counting on
that stupid grant.

615
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,104
-I didn't want you to worry.

616
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,106
-All this change,
change, change!

617
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,801
I'm not cut out for it!

618
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,504
A little house in the suburbs
is sounding pretty good, right?

619
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,547
-Is that a fact?

620
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:12,519
-You know, Timothy, sometimes
I have this dream of just...

621
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:19,891
picking up and running away
from this circus.

622
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:22,190
-Oh, grow up, Tory.

623
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,107
-I couldn't help it.

624
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:42,376
It's like something that is...

625
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:45,885
stronger than I am and...

626
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,922
I...

627
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:58,933
-It helps to put names
to our feelings.

628
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,072
Naming things gives us power
over them.

629
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:09,508
-Yeah.

630
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:12,876
Maybe it gives others
power over me, too.

631
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:18,043
-You have nothing to fear
from me, Camille.

632
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:24,024
-It's not that I've been unhappy
with Martin.

633
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,526
It's just that I'm...

634
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:29,529
I'm happier with...

635
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,530
Oh, God...

636
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:36,297
Why did I get into this? Why?

637
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,203
-Our community has been remiss

638
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:44,711
for many years.

639
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:49,079
It takes long to change.

640
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,319
But yes, I think
we have been guilty

641
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,186
of homophobic cruelty

642
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:58,987
and excluded people like you

643
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:00,925
in the past.

644
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:06,558
-People like me.

645
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:09,569
-But what I'd really like to do

646
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,570
right now...

647

-Circumstance?

-Circumstance is a festival

for the Modern Circus
in San Francisco

658

It was just fun.

I mean, the pressure of
the promotion, my proposal...

-I'm trying to say something--
-It was wonderful.

-And there was a...

789
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:01,625
a beautiful talk by...

790
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:06,173
by some guy from Sweden,
just at the end, about silence.

791
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:10,039
And he said this contemporary
obsession to voice everything

792
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:13,011
sometimes does more damage
than good,

793
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:17,050
and that the only real dialogue
is with God.

794
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:21,588
And it felt... true.

795
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:30,292
-But... I rememberyou saying

796
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:35,062
that when you hide one thing,
you hide many.

797
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:37,068
-He was saying that sometimes,

798
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:39,571
it's selfish to give yourself
the relief of saying something

799
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:42,370
when the consequences
far outweigh the relief.

800
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:49,677
See?

801
01:19:56,491 --> 01:20:00,359
Anyway, I'll help you
take care of Bob.

802
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:02,395
-You said that.

803
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,369
Martin, listen...

804
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:12,405
-No. No, you listen.

805
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:16,107
This is what I know.

806
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:19,372
I love you.

807
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:23,848
For we have something,
you and me, don't we?

808
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:27,986
-Of course we do. Yes.

809
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:30,990
-I can understand everything.

810
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:33,492
I mean, I'm not such a bad deal.

811
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:35,493
-No, you're not a bad deal.

812
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,530
-These things pass.

-What things?

814
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:46,004
-These... passing things.

815
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:49,008
Just think, please.

816
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:53,012
Please, just think
before you speak.

817
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:55,048
Okay?

818
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:05,655
You are what you say you are,
Camille.

819
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:09,662
Just be careful when you say it.

820
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:22,300
-I'm sorry.

821
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:18,783
[ Petra ]: Camille, it's me.

822
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:22,219
I hope you're okay.
Listen, we're leaving tonight.

823
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:24,825
I thought maybe you wanted to...

824
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:30,293
Oh God, I don't know
what I thought.

825
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:32,832
Just call me. Please.

826
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:36,836
-Coffee?

827
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:26,987
-We're off, gentlemen.

828
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,460
-...I said, ''Why don't
you prove it, scumbag?

829
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:44,470
Give me one good reason why
I should believe your bullshit.''

830
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:46,471
And he had nothing to say.

831
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:49,008
The guy dropped right down
to his knees.

832
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:54,881
-Oh, shit! Hang on,
I dropped the hang strap.

833
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:03,986
Oh, shit... Hey, guys?

834
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:05,615
Come here!

835
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,092
-What?
-Come here!

836
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:11,164
There's a body.

837
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:12,698
-Oh, Jesus!

838
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:13,858
Hey...

839
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:17,165
This is the woman that was
gliding with Petra

840
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:18,966
the other day.

841
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:20,665
-I can't tell
if she's breathing.

842
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:23,208
-We should call an ambulance.
-I'll get to a phone.

843
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:51,703
-I'll go back and get the stuff
from the truck.

844
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:53,170
-Yeah.

845
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:55,333
[ phone ringing ]

846
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:57,205
-Hello?...

847
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:02,781
Well...

848
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:04,316
Where?

849
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:09,856
[ tires screeching ]

850
01:27:22,804 --> 01:27:25,068
[ siren wailing ]

851
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:28,733
Where is she?
-She's in here.

852
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:30,707
-What happened?
-I don't know.

853
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:32,710
We just found her.
I think she was drunk.

854
01:27:32,847 --> 01:27:34,712
-How is she?

855
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:36,714
-She... hypothermia.
I don't know.

856
01:27:36,851 --> 01:27:38,716
-Well, can't we get her
into town?

857
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:40,718
-The ambulance is supposed
to get here any minute.

858
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:43,722
-Can we at least put her
in your truck or something?

859
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:46,326
-No. They said, "Don't move her.
Just keep her warm."

860
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:48,326
-The best thing to do

861
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:50,328
for a hypothermia victim...

862
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:52,365
[ The voice becomes an echo. ]

863
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:50,881
[ whispering ]:
Please, please, fate...

864
01:28:51,025 --> 01:28:53,255
God, Zeus...

865
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:55,259
Science...

866
01:28:55,396 --> 01:28:57,455
Anybody...

867
01:28:57,598 --> 01:28:59,623
Okay...

868
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:06,705
I promise to love her

869
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:09,537
and I promise to cherish her...

870
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:15,213
And to follow her

871
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:19,878
and to lead her anywhere...

872
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:24,885
-Yes...

873
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:26,960
-Oh!

874
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:58,510
"Hallelujah"

875
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:03,219
"Hallelujah"

876
01:31:04,892 --> 01:31:07,019
"Hallelujah"

01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:12,125
"Hallelujah"

"Hallelujah"

"Hallelujah"
