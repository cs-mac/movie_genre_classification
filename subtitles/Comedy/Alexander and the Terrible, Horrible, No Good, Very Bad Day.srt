1
00:00:44,176 --> 00:00:47,512
<i>My parents say there's no
such thing as a bad day.</i>

2
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:49,848
<i>That it's all
how you look at it.</i>

3
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,586
<i>What can I tell you? Parents.</i>

4
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,692
<i>Here is what I know.</i>

5
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,422
<i>They're wrong.</i>

6
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:01,693
<i>My name is Alexander, and
I'm the expert in bad days.</i>

7
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:05,830
<i>This guy knows what I'm talking about.
That's not coming off.</i>

8
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:09,767
<i>Did I mention my dad
is a relentless optimist?</i>

9
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:11,269
We're in the home stretch.

10
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,437
<i>And look at Mom.</i>

11
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:15,511
<i>She's not fooling anyone
with that "Mom smile."</i>

12
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,412
<i>Believe it or not,
by the time we got home...</i>

13
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:23,677
<i>this van was in better
shape than we were.</i>

14
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,653
<i>There's my sister Emily,
the actress.</i>

15
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,657
<i>Always ready to take a bow.</i>

16
00:01:32,658 --> 00:01:37,863
<i>Anthony, my brother, a total winner
with a great sense of style.</i>

17
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:40,665
<i>And baby Trevor.</i>

18
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:44,335
<i>Sorry, pal.
Definitely not coming off.</i>

19
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:48,873
<i>Bottom line, today was an epic disaster.
The worst day possible.</i>

20
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,309
<i>Everyone in my
family would agree.</i>

21
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,579
<i>But what they don't know,
is it was all my fault.</i>

22
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,549
<i>And it wasn't over yet.</i>

23
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:31,249
You overslept, bud.

24
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,549
Don't blow my didgeridoo!

25
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,520
What's it for, then?

26
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:51,604
<i>You're invited!
Philip Parker turning 12.</i>

27
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:53,872
Tomorrow night?

28
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,406
No!

29
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:57,942
He's the trick
to... Good morning!

30
00:02:57,943 --> 00:02:59,844
Oh! There she is!

31
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:02,814
You are going to
be so impressed.

32
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,816
I made what is known as...

33
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,818
the crustless quiche,
the frittata.

34
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:08,808
Wow. What is this?

35
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:11,955
Two months ago, you couldn't
even grill cheese, and now...

36
00:03:11,956 --> 00:03:14,359
Oh, that looks so good.

37
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,362
- Oh.
- Egg and cheese.

38
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,830
- Excellent.
- Thank you.

39
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:22,466
So, what are you
gentlemen up to today?

40
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:23,734
Well, let's see.

41
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:25,737
Em has a dentist appointment
this morning...

42
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:26,937
Right, right.

43
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:29,374
And then the two of us are
going to Mommy and Me Yoga.

44
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,775
- Oh, with Summer?
- Yes.

45
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:32,043
Will you tell her I still exist?

46
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,679
I will. And then
when he takes his nap,

47
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,314
I'm gonna send out some resumes.

48
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:37,815
Good.

49
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:39,917
What a to-do to die today
at a minute or two to two.

50
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:41,985
A thing distinctly hard to
say but harder still to do.

51
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:43,488
We'll beat a tattoo
at a minute or two

52
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,822
and a rat-tat-tat-
tat-tat-tattoo...

53
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:45,990
and the dragon will come
to the beat of the drum

54
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:47,324
at a minute or
two to two today...

55
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:48,559
at a minute or two to two.

56
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,328
- I need to pee.
- You have gum in your hair.

57
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,430
A big black bug bit
a big black bear...

58
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:53,565
No!

59
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:04,609
Anthony! Alexander!
Accelerate. Come on!

60
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,610
One minute!

61
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,887
Hey, if it ain't broke, right?

62
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,121
Guess what?

63
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,790
Philip Parker's having his
birthday party tomorrow night.

64
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,857
That's when you're having
your birthday party.

65
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,859
I know! And I just
got the invitation.

66
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,727
He's going all-out, Dad.

67
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:25,629
He's getting
an energy drink bar,

68
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,066
a Korean taco truck,
a live band.

69
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,266
That sounds legit.

70
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:31,402
I think he's having black
lights and a karaoke machine.

71
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:32,837
Oh, I love karaoke parties.

72
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:34,940
Look, can I compete
with all of that?

73
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,508
Oh, come on, your
birthday's gonna be great.

74
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:41,813
It's gonna be fun. We're gonna have pizza.
I'm gonna make a cake.

75
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,681
Maybe some volleyball
in the pool.

76
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:46,451
Philip Parker's having a fog
machine and we're having pizza?

77
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,785
- Don't worry.
- You're drinking coffee?

78
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:49,953
- What about my party?
- Since when did you start drinking coffee?

79
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:51,490
I'm not a morning person.

80
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:54,525
- Can you check his diaper?
- Oh.

81
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:55,760
You just dropped Bumble Bee.

82
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:57,695
- You drop Bumble Bee?
- I think he might be wet.

83
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:59,731
No. Bumble Bee.
There you go.

84
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,797
Wish I could be there, bro,

85
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:02,032
but I got prom tomorrow night.

86
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,400
I thought that was next week.

87
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:04,835
It is what it is.

88
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,938
I'll probably be wiped out
from my <i>Peter Pan</i> premiere...

89
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,472
but I'll be happy to sing for
you and all of your friends.

90
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:09,941
Oh! No, no, no.

91
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:10,942
<i>♪ Think of
a wonderful thought... ♪</i>

92
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,710
Oh, probably
Mrs. Gibson. Okay.

93
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,379
Honey, Dad's taking
Emily to the dentist.

94
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,981
I've got Anthony.
So you're in carpool.

95
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,383
- Take a frittata. It's a crustless quiche.
- There you go.

96
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:20,717
What did you do to your hair?

97
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:21,986
Oh, nothing.

98
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:24,430
Say hi to Mrs. Gibson!
Remember your manners.

99
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,599
Hi, Becky!

100
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,608
Hey, Alexander.

101
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:47,845
Oh, are you okay?

102
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:51,948
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Let's go, kids.

106

<i>Lord of the Flies?</i>

107
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,835
Pretty scary, right?

108
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:14,472
<i>Lord of the Flies</i> is
beautiful, Alexander.

109
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:15,972
It's a deep and
meaningful allegory

110
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:17,975
about our own
messed-up society.

111
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,210
Yeah, totally.

112
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,912
That's what I
meant with "scary."

113
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,549
The society stuff. Crazy.

114
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,909
Hey, check out this app.

115
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:28,852
He puts your face on
some bikini model's body.

116
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:31,823
- It's really gross and sexist.
- This is gonna be hilarious.

117
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,491
- What are you doing?
- Wait, hold on!

118
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:35,071
- No, no, no.
- I'm not done.

119
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:36,793
Hey, babe.

120
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:43,234
Is everything okay? Your
last text was so cold.

121
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:46,038
No, I said, "See you at school"?

122
00:06:47,382 --> 00:06:49,172
Yeah. I'm your
girlfriend, Anthony.

123
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:50,641
You really should end your texts

124
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:52,844
with "x-o-x-o"
or "I heart you."

125
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,147
You can make a heart with the
less-than sign and a three.

126
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:58,482
Yeah, I'll try to remember.

127
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,184
So, a bunch of the
girls were talking,

128
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:01,719
and they're all going in limos.

129
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,720
We are getting a limo
tomorrow, right?

130
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:06,123
No, I am taking my driver's
test tomorrow, babe.

131
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:07,991
The first thing I wanna
do as a licensed driver

132
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,893
is chauffeur you to the prom.

133
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:11,368
It'll be romantic and stuff.

134
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:15,732
Oh. Well, I do want
it to be romantic.

135
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:17,667
It will be.

136
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:19,804
Oh. Also, I have it from a
very good source who says...

137
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,506
we're being crowned
Duke and Duchess

138
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,174
at the Royal Court
tomorrow night at prom.

139
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:25,177
- That's so tight!
- I know.

140
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,044
- Isn't it like the best thing ever?
- This is the worst thing ever.

141
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,614
These look so real.

142
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,215
I can't believe Elliot
text-bombed the whole school.

143
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:34,251
Don't worry about it, man.
Elliot's an idiot.

144
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:35,989
No one's even
gonna look at these.

145
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,729
Hey, Paul.

146
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,929
Philip, my man.

147
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,266
Nice boobs, Alexander.

148
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:53,136
Since when are you friends
with Philip Parker?

149
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:55,239
We go to the same
psychopharmacologist.

150
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,309
He's got ADHD, too.
He's super nice.

151
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,576
No, he's not.

152
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:00,878
He's throwing a huge
party tomorrow,

153
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,746
and it's not even
his actual birthday.

154
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,582
His is next week.

155
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,850
You realize it's just gonna
be you and me at my party.

156
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:09,322
- Actually, it might just be you.
- What?

157
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,189
You've gotta come.
You're my best friend.

158
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,326
Okay, but personally, I think
you should just postpone.

159
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:19,095
Philip's popular and
everybody's gonna be there.

160
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:20,931
Plus, his party
sounds pretty dope.

161
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:23,734
Dude, last year your dad
tap-danced with a cane.

162
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:26,304
Another bad party could
ruin your rep forever.

163
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,306
Your dad's a nice guy,
but trust me...

164
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,044
you do not want your entire
social life in his hands.

165
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:33,911
Whoo!

166
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:35,178
Great job!

167
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,047
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

168
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:40,283
Breathe. You gave birth.
You can do this.

169
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:42,887
Two. One.

170
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:47,797
Take your baby back to the womb.
They love it there.

171
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,663
I think that it's so
cool when a guy can

172
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:55,296
step up to be
a full-time fommy.

173
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,634
A what?

174
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:58,802
A father-mommy.

175
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:00,638
Oh! Okay.

176
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,807
Um, yeah, I guess I'm sort
of a fommy by default.

177
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:06,978
I was in aerospace, and I got
transitioned out of my job.

178
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,045
Oh, I'm sorry.

179
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:09,814
No, that's okay.
I get to spend

180
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,815
more time with this little guy.

181
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:12,984
Excuse me.

182
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,784
Hello?

183
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:16,255
Yes, this is Ben Cooper.

184
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:18,955
Tomorrow?

185
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:20,259
Yes, that's good.

186
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,060
Okay, I'll see you then.

187
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,296
I look forward to it,
Greg. Bye-bye.

188
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,064
Good news?

189
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:28,666
Yeah! I landed
an interview.

190
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,066
Hey! That's great.

191
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,134
What do you think of that?

192
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,802
What do you think of that?

193
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:35,840
Fommy just landed an interview.

194
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:36,841
Fommy.

195
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:39,810
Did you hear him say that?

196
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:40,945
Yes!

197
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:43,947
He just said Fommy!
You just said my name!

198
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:46,683
Guys, he just said Fommy.
Did you hear him say Fommy?

199
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:47,951
I'm Fommy. Fommy!

200
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:49,153
That was so cool.

201
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:51,354
It's so adorable!

202
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:53,824
I am Fommy, and he said it.

203
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,893
So, with our celebrity readings,

204
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:57,994
our great grassroots
marketing campaign...

205
00:09:57,995 --> 00:09:59,363
Thank you, Julie...

206
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:00,965
and the positive reviews
we have coming in...

207
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:04,368
we are poised for
a really strong roll-out.

208
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,422
Tomorrow, we are
going to ask America...

209
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:09,239
"Who is ready to
jump on the potty?"

210
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,744
And I'm confident our sales are
going to leap over expectations.

211
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,278
I know I would have
appreciated this book

212
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,348
when I was
potty-training my kids!

213
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:18,917
That's Alexander, my son.

214
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:21,284
Thank you, guys!

215
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:23,391
Thank you for all
your support with this.

216
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,392
Oh, man.

217
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:30,460
I hope that was thorough
enough for you, Nina.

218
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:32,863
Well, I'm going
to need you to make

219
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:35,066
an incredible effort
on "the Potty" tomorrow.

220
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,466
On "the Potty."

221
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:39,036
- What?
- You can count on me.

222
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:42,873
Good. Because if this goes well,
I'm going to make you VP.

223
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:44,274
Really?

224
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:46,042
Have you run Children's
Lit and Young Adult.

225
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:47,811
Oh! Thank you!

226
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:49,879
Thank you.

227
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,782
I'm going to need you

228
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,185
every second of every
minute of every day.

229
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,387
- Got it.
- 24/7, 365.

230
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:57,888
That's a lot of numbers.

231
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:59,255
Is that a joke?

232
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:00,825
I have four kids
that I'll just have

233
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,859
to carve out
a little time to see.

234
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,428
Right, right, of course.
Of course you will.

235
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:07,498
Isn't that one of your darling
little babies right there?

236
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:09,432
Yeah, it is.

237
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,502
So you're seeing him right now.

238
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:12,737
All right, country reports.

239
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:16,507
As you all know, this is your
big project this semester.

240
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,907
- So, what I think...
- Mr. Rogue?

241
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:19,442
Yeah, Alexander.

242
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:21,045
I would like to take Australia.

243
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,204
I know a ton about it.

244
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:25,048
And I have my own didgeridoo.

245
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:27,218
Yeah, I'm sure
there a lot of students

246
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,326
here who want Australia.
Am I right?

247
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,028
So to be fair, this semester...

248
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:40,931
I'm going to let the globe
decide what country.

249
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:42,066
We'll start with you, Alexander.

250
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,768
You ready?
Here we go.

251
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,069
Australia. Australia. Australia.

252
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,070
What will it be?

253
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,939
Djibouti.

254
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,143
Look at that, the Horn of Africa!
All right, Djibouti!

255
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,244
Dji... what?

256
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,083
Who's gonna be next here?
Philip Parker. Here we go.

257
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,484
Australia.

258
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:02,353
So, like, Arnold
Schwarzenegger and stuff?

259
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,921
That's Austria, not Australia.

260
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:05,321
- Can we switch?
- No.

261
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:07,494
Okay, Albert Morio.

262
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,897
Lebanon.
That's good.

263
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:17,203
- Partner up, everybody!
- Get your aprons on. Guys.

264
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:20,237
Becky...

265
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,239
do you want to partner?

266
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,110
Okay. You can
take lab notes.

267
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,246
.5 milligrams of boron.

268
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:31,288
Boron... Boring!

269
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,856
So, Becky, I'm having a
birthday party tomorrow night.

270
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:42,125
It was only gonna
be guys, but I can...

271
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:45,495
Oh, thanks, but I'm going to Philip
Parker's party tomorrow night.

272
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,398
I think everyone is.

273
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,367
He has a frozen yogurt
machine and a trampoline.

274
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:52,168
So do we!

275
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:55,406
We have a frozen yogurt
machine and a trampoline.

276
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,041
- Oh, my God!
- Well, yeah...

277
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,274
My lab book!

278
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:00,345
Put it out!

279
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:05,381
Put it out!

280
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:16,427
Who's responsible for this?

281
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,568
Alexander!

282
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:26,436
Hey, Alexander! Hold up.

283
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:28,205
Hey, hold up!

284
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:30,173
I'm leaving for a conference

285
00:13:30,174 --> 00:13:32,308
and nobody signed up
to take Melvin home.

286
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:35,079
I can't leave him
alone all weekend.

287
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,647
So, what do you want me to do?

288
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:39,438
Well, you'll make a furry
friend a little less lonely.

289
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,044
Unbelievable.

290
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:13,951
Cool, we're hosting
a guinea pig.

291
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,955
All right!

292
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:18,254
Sorry we're late.

293
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,090
We had a little diaper
trauma at Trader Joe's.

294
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:22,191
Hello!

295
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:23,661
- Hi!
- Hi, Mom.

296
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,629
There's my big boy. Hi!

297
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,101
There you are.
Hi, big guy.

298
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:32,635
- What is that?
- Melvin.

299
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:33,970
We're hosting
Melvin this weekend.

300
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:34,971
Oh, boy.

301
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,643
Alexander, would you grab
that and wash it off, please?

302
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:41,644
He needs Bumble Bee
like he needs air.

303
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:42,479
I know, honey pie.

304
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,148
And after that,
the pig goes upstairs.

305
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:46,484
Shh, it's okay.

306
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,353
Bumble Bee's just getting a bath.
It will be right back.

307
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:52,089
Alexander,
we could use Bumble Bee.

308
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,425
Bumble Bee is coming right back,

309
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,996
right back,
right back any second.

310
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:00,531
Oh! Dad, don't!

311
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,133
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

312
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:06,274
What was that?

313
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:15,745
Honey, Bumble Bee's gone.

314
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:17,715
<i>Peter Pan</i> is
going to be awesome.

315
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:22,252
Today, Mr. Brand said that I am the
most poised and elegant Peter Pan...

316
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:24,088
he's ever had the privilege
of working with.

317
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,724
No way! Wow. When is that, again?
Just remind me.

318
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,459
Mom, hello! It's
tomorrow afternoon!

319
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,726
Of course.

320
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:31,595
Please be on time and
don't be embarrassing.

321
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:34,431
- Best behavior.
- Honey, please don't embarrass our daughter.

322
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:36,100
- Dad, that includes you.
- I know.

323
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,567
I'll be there,
honey, don't worry.

324
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:39,570
Guess who's getting crowned
Duke at the prom tomorrow.

325
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,305
Really?
Congratulations.

326
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:44,707
Yeah, it's not official, but
Celia heard from a good source.

327
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,042
It's kind of crazy.

328
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,744
I'm dating the hottest
girl in school...

329
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:50,080
I'm getting crowned at prom, and
once I get my license tomorrow...

330
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,292
I kind of have
everything I've ever wanted.

331
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,185
- Hashtag blessed, you know.
- Wait.

332
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:57,186
Once you get your
license tomorrow?

333
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:58,589
I'm taking my test after school.

334
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,656
Dad already said it was cool.

335
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:01,258
You said it was cool?

336
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:03,594
I said it was doable. Not cool.
I said it was doable.

337
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,728
Okay.

338
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:06,596
It will be fine.
We'll make it.

339
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:08,599
Okay, guys, I have some news.

340
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,701
Nina said that if the book
launch goes well tomorrow...

341
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:14,571
you could be looking at the new
Vice President of Lone Hill Press.

342
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:15,572
Honey, wow!

343
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:17,340
That's big.

344
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:19,576
Yeah, it would be a lot
more hours at work...

345
00:16:19,577 --> 00:16:21,345
I already feel like I
live there some days,

346
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:23,047
but the raise would be nice.

347
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,115
Awesome. I have
some news as well.

348
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:29,753
I got a call today. I have an
interview for a game design firm.

349
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:31,254
They're looking for engineers.

350
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:33,123
- Wait, video games? Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

351
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:35,492
Your aerospace engineering dad
might be designing video games.

352
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,360
- That's so cool.
- I know. I know.

353
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:39,062
Oh!

354
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:42,221
The best news of all... Guess
who spoke his first word today?

355
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:45,134
Trevor.

356
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:46,403
- No!
- Yes.

357
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:47,470
What did you say?

358
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:48,839
What was it?

359
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,374
He said fommy.

360
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,742
- He said fommy?
- Yeah.

361
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:54,244
- What's that?
- Father-mommy.

362
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:56,113
I didn't know that was a word.

363
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:58,181
Wow, we all had
pretty big wins today.

364
00:16:58,182 --> 00:16:59,582
- Yeah.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

365
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,651
I had a crap day.

366
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,086
What is that smell?

367
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:05,322
It's Vegemite. It's from
Australia, and back off!

368
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:06,289
Hey, hey, hey!

369
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,624
Easy. You're gonna have
a good day tomorrow.

370
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,794
It's your birthday. You have friends
coming over, it's gonna be a great party.

371
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:14,097
Actually, you can forget it,
because I'm canceling my party.

372
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:15,531
- What are you talking about?
- Why?

373
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:17,500
Nobody's coming.

374
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:19,502
They're all going to Philip
Parker's party tomorrow night.

375
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:20,537
Who is this Philip Parker?

376
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:23,874
He's a really cool kid
with a hot tub and ADHD.

377
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,143
- I'm gonna call his mom...
- No!

378
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:29,212
No, no, no. We're gonna
forget about Philip Parker.

379
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:31,481
Whoever comes to the party comes.
It's gonna be great.

380
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:33,416
Trust me, nobody is coming.

381
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,419
Elliot Gibson
texted pictures of me

382
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,153
in a butt thong to
everyone at school.

383
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:39,823
My best friend is suddenly
best friends with Philip...

384
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:42,692
because they go to the same
dumb psychopharmacologist.

385
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:44,595
I didn't get Australia
for my school report...

386
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,563
and I burned
down the science lab

387
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:48,297
with Becky Gibson's lab notes.

388
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:50,566
- What did you do?
- You burned down the science lab?

389
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,568
Dude, big deal. So things
didn't go your way today.

390
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:54,137
Go my way?

391
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:55,572
It was a totally
wrecked bad day.

392
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:57,406
And it's not just today!

393
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:59,476
It is every single day.
Every day!

394
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:02,512
You don't even care because
your lives are all so perfect!

395
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:03,846
No, we care.
We care, honey.

396
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:05,749
- What?
- Sweetie.

397
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,416
Where's Bumble Bee?

398
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:10,319
Alexander murdered it, so now
he's going to cry all night.

399
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,721
- Can't you just get him a new one?
- No.

400
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:13,723
It's only Bumble Bee.
It's the only one he likes.

401
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:14,857
It's gotta be Bumble Bee.

402
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:16,293
I can't deal with this.

403
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:18,562
I'm going to
rehearse in the car.

404
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:21,331
Maybe this is the time to
wean him from the pacifier.

405
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:22,566
Honey, easy for you to say.

406
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,371
You're not here
with him all day.

407
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:30,374
<i>♪ Think of a wonderful thought

408

00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,876

412
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,734
Anthony?

413
00:18:57,734 --> 00:19:00,403
I feel like no one
understands me.

414
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:03,507
I do. I get you.

415
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:04,510
You do?

416
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,280
Yeah. Come on,
you're amazing.

417
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,949
Really?

418
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,283
You think I'm amazing?

419
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:16,390
Honestly, I love you so much.

420
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,492
I love you, too.

421
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:23,861
I love you more.

422
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:27,463
No, I love you more.

423
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:30,400
And don't get me started on
that cute little butt of yours.

424
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:31,471
What?

425
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:34,537
What?

426
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:35,706
Why are you
"what" -ing me?

427
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,574
What's your problem?

428
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,742
- Excuse me?
- <i>You know what? You're so annoying.</i>

429
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:41,979
Why can't you just chill out?
For one second?

430
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,412
You're exhausting.

431
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:44,986
Are you kidding?

432
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,690
Sorry, Celia.
That was my idiot brother.

433
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,991
Celia?

434
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:56,997
Seriously?

435
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,155
Now she won't pick up!

436
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,933
I'm worried about Alexander.

437
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:07,574
I mean, of all the years for
everyone to bail on his birthday.

438
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:13,277
He's been so moody since I
had Trevor and started work.

439
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,810
Don't worry
about it. He's 12.

440
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:16,313
Everybody's moody at that age.

441
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:17,581
How's he already 12?

442
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:19,850
I know. Just happened.

443
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,952
That's the problem. Everything
is just happening so fast.

444
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:24,320
Yeah.

445
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:25,322
This house is
like a train station.

446
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:26,992
Everyone's coming and going...

447
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:30,835
and Trevor's first
word was "Fommy."

448
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:34,364
- Maybe I misheard that.
- I don't think you did.

449
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:36,365
Honey, come on.

450
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:39,870
I got the kids covered.
I got the house covered.

451
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,904
You're killing it at work.

452
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:43,484
Things have never been better.

453
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:45,075
Oh, please.

454
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:46,509
- Never been better?
- It's true.

455
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,412
Ben...

456
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,940
you've been unemployed
for the past seven months.

457
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:52,982
Aren't you stressed out?

458
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:54,951
Yeah. A little bit.

459
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:57,487
Why aren't you
freaking out more?

460
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:59,456
What good would freaking out do?

461
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,721
Then I'd just be freaked
out and unemployed.

462
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,866
Tomorrow I'm gonna
nail that interview.

463
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:10,866
Big day tomorrow.

464
00:21:20,444 --> 00:21:21,946
It's 12:01, Melvin.

465
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:24,086
It's my birthday.

466
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,856
You ever feel
alone in the world?

467
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:34,426
I just wish they understood!

468
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,528
I just wish they knew
what it felt like...

469
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:41,938
to have a terrible, horrible,
no good, very bad day!

470
00:22:29,513 --> 00:22:30,829
Shouldn't you guys be up?

471
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,649
Who hit snooze?

472
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,717
- What time is it?
- Who hit snooze?

473
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:35,652
- It's morning. It's morning.
- Okay, okay. Go, go, go.

474
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:38,488
- I have to take a shower.
- All right. Okay, okay.

475
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:41,194
All right, okay.
All right.

476
00:22:44,194 --> 00:22:46,194
Does anyone know
where the diapers are?

477
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:50,733
I'm in here!

478
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,538
Hey, honey?

479
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:56,906
Wow! You look terrible.
Are you okay?

480
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:59,976
No, I'm not okay. Peter Pan
can't have a cold, Dad.

481
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:00,977
Okay.

482
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:05,583
Oh, come...

483
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,184
Harsh.

484
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:12,133
Bro, I gotta take a shower. I gotta get
to school. Celia won't call me back.

485
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:15,624
No! No way, not today!

486
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,860
Get out, dude.

487
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:17,861
Get out!

488
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:20,097
Why today?
This is the worst day! No!

489
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:27,504
I am so late. Emily?

490
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:29,139
I'm coming in
for a razor, honey.

491
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,906
- Mom!
- Mom!

492
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:32,209
Mom, get out!

493
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,477
I'm sorry!

494
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:36,181
Sorry. Sorry.
I'll wear pants!

495
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:39,657
Mother!

496
00:23:47,646 --> 00:23:49,593
- Good morning.
- Speak for yourself.

497
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,893
Oh.

498
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:52,162
- Dad?
- Yeah!

499
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,831
Trevor's peeing!
Where's his diaper?

500
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:56,499
I'm looking!

501
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,703
Oh!

502
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:01,270
Hey! There's the
birthday boy.

503
00:24:01,271 --> 00:24:03,606
Okay, come here.

504
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:06,742
Okay, you know what? I want
you to have a great day.

505
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:08,812
You are
the captain of your ship.

506
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:10,881
Steer your ship with positivity.

507
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,115
Oh! Come on!

508
00:24:13,116 --> 00:24:15,050
What is wrong with you people?

509
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:16,085
Anthony!

510
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:17,220
Dad, are you okay?

511
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:18,421
Look, you're older already.

512
00:24:18,422 --> 00:24:22,092
I'm sorry, honey, I have to run.
I have a huge event...

513
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,692
and my foot is killing me.
I'm already late.

514
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:24,928
Ben, put a diaper on it.

515
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:26,062
We'll celebrate tonight, okay?

516
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:27,305
I'm trying.

517
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:46,018
Emily!

518
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,621
Emily? Emily!

519
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:52,255
You left the light on
in my car all night.

520
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:53,291
The battery's dead.

521
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:55,725
I'm the one who had to rehearse

522
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:56,726
in a cold car, and now I'm sick!

523
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:58,827
Peter Pan!

524
00:24:58,828 --> 00:25:00,797
- What happened to your head?
- Ben, we gotta go!

525
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:01,964
It's a zit.
Is it that bad?

526
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:03,165
You should put
a Band-Aid on that.

527
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:06,135
Ben! We have got to go! You are my ride.
Let's go, people.

528
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:08,872
Alexander, into the car.
We have got to go!

529
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:11,576
Everybody, out of the house!
Broom it out!

530
00:25:12,623 --> 00:25:15,045
Get out of your comfort zone.
Push it. Push it.

531
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,947
You miss Bumble Bee, don't you?

532
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,114
Why is Anthony driving?

533
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:19,583
I feel sick enough as it is.

534
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:20,683
I need practice for
my driver's test today.

535
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:23,689
Okay! Then can we at least
change the music, please?

536
00:25:27,157 --> 00:25:28,924
That's good. Leave that!

537
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:30,960
You like that?
Yeah! That's good.

538
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:32,328
Wonderful.

539
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:33,762
I can't believe I'm sick.

540
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:36,833
I cannot believe that
this guy is 12 years old.

541
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:37,901
Thanks, Dad.

542
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:39,835
This is not gonna work for me.

543
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:42,939
You're gonna have to get around
there, make a left on Brookwood.

544
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,841
- There's no room.
- Get aggressive!

545
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:46,742
We have places to be.
You're doing great.

546
00:25:46,743 --> 00:25:48,778
Mom, do you mind?
Please.

547
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,748
What? Because
of this morning?

548
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:53,749
It's not the first time
I've seen your penis, Anthony!

549
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,785
- Mom saw your penis?
- Yep!

550
00:25:55,786 --> 00:25:57,220
I've seen yours too, Alexander.

551
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:58,954
I've seen every
penis in this car!

552
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:00,656
Every penis.

553
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:01,657
Come on!

554
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:03,626
Excuse me, sir!

555
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:06,395
Excuse me, sir,
in the ironic Mini Cooper!

556
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:08,364
You're gonna have
to put down the latte...

557
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:10,733
and move or I am gonna
come and do it for you!

558
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:12,734
Sir, I am gonna
come... Thank you, son.

559
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:16,172
Easy, hon.

560
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:17,874
Nice and slow.
Nice and slow, sweets.

561
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,243
Gently, gently.

562
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:21,787
There you go, honey.

563
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:31,054
Move, move, move.

564
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:32,221
Go, go, go.

565
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:33,757
It's okay, baby.

566
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,258
Mom's gotta go.
Have a good day.

567
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:36,726
Do you have lunch money?

568
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:37,993
- Yes?
- Got it.

569
00:26:37,994 --> 00:26:39,095
Love you.

570
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:40,798
Mom!

571
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,732
This is not gonna work.
This is not gonna work!

572
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:46,702
Let's go! Fold in.
Woodwinds, make a window!

573
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:48,672
Come on! Let's go, kids!

574
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,173
The bell is ringing!
Go, march, march!

575
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:54,143
Move it on in there.
Fold in. Hustle!

576
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:56,381
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Okay, come on!

577
00:26:57,381 --> 00:26:59,152
This day is so cursed.

578
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:02,052
Everybody move out of the way.

579
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,106
Just move out of the way.
Make a window!

580
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:08,290
- Go. Here.
- All right.

581
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:10,261
Goodbye.
Take your stuff.

582
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:13,129
Have a good day, honey!

583
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,130
Here we go, boys.

584
00:27:19,002 --> 00:27:20,403
Celia!

585
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:22,172
Celia, wait up!
What's wrong?

586
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,074
You haven't answered your
phone since last night.

587
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:27,043
Why do you care? I thought
I was so exhausting.

588
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:28,344
I wasn't talking to you.

589
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:29,979
I was talking to
my idiot brother.

590
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,413
- Whatever.
- I tried calling you back!

591
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:33,749
I really didn't feel
like talking to you.

592
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,451
I just don't think
you understand...

593
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:39,322
the emotional responsibilities that
come from having a girlfriend.

594
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,060
Wait, are you
breaking up with me?

595
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:44,827
What about tonight?

596
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:45,986
I don't even wanna go.

597
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:52,802
Sorry. Morning!

598
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:53,803
Good morning!

599
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,873
Try calling again!

600
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:58,807
Sorry I'm late.
I had a little car trouble.

601
00:27:58,808 --> 00:28:00,479
My husband had to drop me off.

602
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,979
- What happened?
- This happened!

603
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,181
And not just
the cover. No.

604
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:09,152
15 times throughout the book.

605
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:11,887
But it must be some horrible
mistake at the printer!

606
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:15,124
I don't know, Cooper. You're the
one who did the final proof!

607
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:17,059
We can't have that
in a children's book!

608
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,262
We just pulled the plug on publication.
So, that's good.

609
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:24,334
But we have
an even bigger problem.

610
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,803
Celebrity readings.
Dick Van Dyke!

611
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:28,555
I've been calling all morning,
but I can't get through.

612
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:29,139
Oh no.

613
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,207
I will get down there. I will fix this.
I will take care of this!

614
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,208
He won't read it.

615
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:34,810
You can count on me!

616
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:36,212
You can count on me!

617
00:28:36,213 --> 00:28:39,982
Oh, Abby, great. I need to borrow your car.
It's a work emergency.

618
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:43,118
I ride a bike, actually. It's good
exercise and good for the planet.

619
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,354
Just tell me where it is!

620
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:47,990
Dude, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

621
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:49,959
Have you heard
about Philip Parker?

622
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,493
I don't wanna hear anything
more about his amazing party.

623
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:52,494
No. It's canceled.

624
00:28:53,396 --> 00:28:54,463
What?

625
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:56,231
Yeah! He woke up
with chicken pox.

626
00:28:56,232 --> 00:28:57,566
He texted me this picture.

627
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:59,371
These things are everywhere.

628
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,570
Oh!

629
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:03,240
They're even in his butt crack.

630
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,508
So, his party's not on?

631
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:07,376
No! So everyone's
coming to yours again!

632
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:09,379
- Really?
- Great, right?

633
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,980
His pox is your gain.

634
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:14,083
Oh.

635
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:15,818
I gotta go. I gotta go.

636
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:17,252
Becky!

637
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:19,956
Becky, Becky.
Wait, wait up.

638
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:21,490
Hi!

639
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:24,259
I am really sorry about burning
your binder yesterday.

640
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,461
Today's a new day, and I thought
that we could go ahead...

641
00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:28,252
and sail our ships
with positivity!

642
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:31,133
Wow, okay.

643
00:29:31,134 --> 00:29:33,836
Anyway, Philip
Parker has chicken pox.

644
00:29:33,837 --> 00:29:35,537
But my party's still on.

645
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:38,509
So if you want to swing by,
it's gonna be pretty cool.

646
00:29:39,455 --> 00:29:40,876
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

647
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:45,114
I actually feel bad Philip's gonna
miss such a sweet party, but...

648
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:47,517
what can you do
when you got the pox?

649
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:49,552
Okay, maybe.

650
00:29:49,553 --> 00:29:52,488
Fantastic! Maybe
I'll see you later then.

651
00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:54,960
Okay. See you.

652
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
See you!

653
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:03,436
No.

654
00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:07,938
Should I put more over here?

655
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,876
Hey, birthday boy!

656
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:15,178
<i>Nothing goofy, Dad.</i>

657
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,579
- What? Alexander?
- <i>Yeah...</i>

658
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,516
and we're gonna need enough food,
cake and drinks for 50 kids.

659
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:22,819
- <i>Everyone's coming.</i>
- Okay, okay. Hold on. Now hold on.

660
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:24,120
What are you talking about?

661
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,055
<i>Philip Parker has chicken pox.</i>

662
00:30:26,056 --> 00:30:27,589
- The party's on!
<i>- Hey!</i>

663
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,358
That's fantastic.
I mean, for you.

664
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,394
<i>Yeah. And guess what? Elliot got
busted for text-bombing the school.</i>

665
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:35,597
So I took your advice and steered
my ship with positivity.

666
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:37,967
And now Becky Gibson
might be coming, too.

667
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:39,335
<i>So no magic tricks.</i>

668
00:30:39,336 --> 00:30:41,437
No tap dancing, nothing dorky.

669
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:42,878
- <i>You got it.</i>
- I'm turning 12.

670
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,241
Got it. 12-year-old
cool straight up.

671
00:30:46,242 --> 00:30:47,943
- Do it right now.
- It's just allergies.

672
00:30:47,944 --> 00:30:49,077
Really?

673
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:50,078
Hey, Em. What's up?

674
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:52,481
They're making me
miss dress rehearsal

675
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:54,150
to lay down in the infirmary.

676
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:56,085
Oh! And Anthony
called me.

677
00:30:56,086 --> 00:30:58,086
Celia broke up with him.

678
00:30:58,087 --> 00:30:59,956
They're going to prom tonight.

679
00:30:59,957 --> 00:31:01,976
Apparently not anymore.

680
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:20,977
Can I be excused?

681
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:21,978
Yes.

682
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:29,518
What?

683
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,220
Listen...

684
00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:32,956
I am sorry about last night.
You have to believe me.

685
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,223
I would never say
those things about you.

686
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:38,995
And tonight, I'm going
to make it up to you.

687
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:40,496
X-O-X-O.

688
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:41,497
I heart you.

689
00:31:45,102 --> 00:31:47,734
Look, I just want everything
to be perfect tonight.

690
00:31:49,138 --> 00:31:50,506
Please...

691
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:52,408
be my date for the prom.

692
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,242
This isn't <i>Gossip Girl,</i> you two.

693
00:31:54,243 --> 00:31:55,454
Get back inside, Celia.

694
00:31:57,013 --> 00:31:58,190
See you tonight.

695
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,463
Yes!

696
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:18,650
Let's go,
<i>Wreck-It Ralph.</i>

697
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:21,170
Principal's office now!

698
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:23,038
Are you sure I can't just
drop him off with you?

699
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,539
<i>Honey, there's no way.
Not today.</i>

700
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,308
<i>What happened to the babysitter?</i>

701
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:28,076
Oh, she had to cancel again.

702
00:32:28,077 --> 00:32:30,179
You know what? It's okay.
I'll just take him with me.

703
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,614
<i>You're taking
Trevor to the interview?</i>

704
00:32:31,615 --> 00:32:32,714
Yeah, I'll be fine.

705
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:34,549
<i>How's he doing
without Bumble Bee?</i>

706
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,451
Um, he is...

707
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:38,587
He is hanging in there.
He's doing okay.

708
00:32:38,588 --> 00:32:40,757
<i>Okay, honey. I gotta go.
I gotta go. Good luck!</i>

709
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,092
Thanks, you too, hon.

710
00:32:44,098 --> 00:32:45,362
Hey, Anthony, what's up?

711
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,496
<i>Dad, I broke a trophy case
and got suspended.</i>

712
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:49,065
- What?
- <i>You have to come and pick me up.</i>

713
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,600
No! You gotta
be kidding me.

714
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,701
<i>They say you
need to come get me.</i>

715
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:53,769
No, no. You're gonna have
to wait at the Principal's

716
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,337
office till I'm
done with my interview.

717
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:56,439
<i>Fine, I'll be here.</i>

718
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,708
Okay, bye.

719
00:33:14,124 --> 00:33:16,758
On your left!
I'm on your right!

720
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,230
On your right.
On your left.

721
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,297
Are you okay?

722
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:22,632
I'm good. I got it!

723
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,374
I'm good. Don't worry!

724
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:31,473
Excuse me.

725
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:33,409
Mr. Van Dyke.
Mr. Van Dyke!

726
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,778
I have been trying to reach you
because I'm here to save you.

727
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:37,747
I'm from the publishing company.

728
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:40,115
Let me start again.
I'm not crazy.

729
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:41,217
Please welcome
legendary performer...

730
00:33:41,218 --> 00:33:42,485
- No, no.
- That's my cue.

731
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:44,386
We'll have a little
chat later, all right?

732
00:33:44,387 --> 00:33:46,354
This is not something we
should leave until afterwards.

733
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:47,722
We wanna have a chat right now, Mr.
Van Dyke!

734
00:33:47,723 --> 00:33:50,229
Please welcome
Mr. Dick Van Dyke!

735
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:53,401
Please!

736
00:33:57,332 --> 00:33:58,701
I insist that you get him.

737
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:00,502
And I insist you
stay right there.

738
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:01,537
- Hi, kids!
- Sir!

739
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:02,805
And hi, moms and dads.

740
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:04,841
There was a misprint!
Just two minutes!

741
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,143
If you guys don't know who
I am, ask your parents.

742
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:08,176
And if they don't know...

743
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:09,651
have them ask their parents.

744
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:13,415
We're gonna have
a great time today.

745
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:15,484
- I'm gonna read to you.
- You're not gonna want to say-!

746
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:17,720
I'm gonna read from
a very special book.

747
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:18,788
You ready?

748
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:20,622
Get out of my way.
I need him. Sir!

749
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:24,192
"Today's the day.
You're growing up!

750
00:34:24,193 --> 00:34:25,560
"I'm here to help you...

751
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:26,895
take that dump!"

752
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:28,564
Please don't, sir!

753
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:30,501
"Take that dump in the pool!

754
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,501
"Take that dump on the bed!

755
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:38,143
"But, don't take a dump on
your, on your brother's head.

756
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,843
"You can take
a dump like a frog.

757
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:43,678
"I'll take a big
dump like a dog!"

758
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,314
No! It's "jump"!

759
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:48,317
It's just jump, sir.
Not dump.

760
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:49,417
Would you excuse
me for a moment?

761
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:50,585
I never agreed to
do this kind of...

762
00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:51,854
There was a misprint.

763
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:54,790
Jump like a frog.
One little letter.

764
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,826
It was a mistake! It was meant to be jump!
I'm so sorry.

765
00:34:56,827 --> 00:35:00,143
There she is, right there, with
the bad hair! She's behind this.

766
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:11,841
Okay, we got this.
We got this, right?

767
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:14,343
You good?
You cool? You ready?

768
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:16,612
You ready to nail this?
All right.

769
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:21,864
Oh, wow!

770
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,364
Hey, man,
guys are ready for you.

771
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:38,436
- Let's go.
- Oh, great, thank you.

772
00:35:39,636 --> 00:35:41,671
At first we thought
it was a little weird

773
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:42,772
that you even
applied for this job...

774
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:46,709
because we're
pretty young and you're...

775
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,776
Older.

776
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:48,877
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

777
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:50,513
Kind of decrepit.

778
00:35:50,514 --> 00:35:51,948
But then we took
a look at your resume,

779
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,317
and your experience is awesome.

780
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,384
You're part of the space
station design team.

781
00:35:56,385 --> 00:35:59,488
You have a Ph.D. in orbital mechanics.
I mean, for real?

782
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:00,826
For real.

783
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:03,826
Sorry.

784
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:06,662
Hey, you.

785
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:08,931
He's a little
out of sorts today.

786
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:13,669
It's so hard to find the
Bumble Bee pacifier.

787
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,772
It would blow your mind.
Anyway...

788
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:18,406
Here you go.

789
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:20,343
He's just gonna
play for a while.

790
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,279
And, kids are crazy.

791
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,413
They're fun.

792
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:25,547
Yeah.

793
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:27,316
So, what were we talking about?

794
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:28,951
We're thinking about
launching this game.

795
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:32,288
We want it to be a space station
simulation strategy game.

796
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:35,323
We want it to be authentic
and completely immersive.

797
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:37,259
That sounds really exciting.

798
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,660
That's in my wheelhouse.

799
00:36:38,661 --> 00:36:40,363
Great!
We wanna hear some ideas.

800
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,464
I guess my first idea would
be modular evolution.

801
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:43,799
Cool.

802
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,268
Space stations are not static.
They grow over time.

803
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:49,605
So you would want to start with
perhaps a small space station...

804
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:51,973
and grow it into an
enormous space station.

805
00:36:51,974 --> 00:36:54,410
And I think players
should have that opportunity.

806
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:56,345
They could add greenhouses.

807
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:57,747
They could add labs.

808
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,485
They could grow
a space station...

809
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:01,984
as big as their imagination.

810
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:04,587
- Your kid.
- Oh!

811
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:06,321
You know what, that'll be fine.

812
00:37:06,322 --> 00:37:08,591
Because we can get daycare,
so that won't be an issue.

813
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:09,991
No, no, no.

814
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:11,098
Your kid right now...

815
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:13,487
his face is all green.

816
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,866
Oh! Wow, Trev.

817
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:20,003
Trevor. I know.

818
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:22,404
That's not for eating.

819
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:23,738
Yoshi, what's up, man?

820
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:25,674
<i>Good news to report or what?</i>

821
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:28,544
Actually, we have a Skype
call we gotta take.

822
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:29,914
But we will call you back.

823
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:33,582
Okay. You'll call me back?

824
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:35,417
- Yeah.
- All right.

825
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:37,352
Great.
All right, we'll head out.

826
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:38,757
You ready to go?

827
00:37:41,757 --> 00:37:43,625
Anthony,

828
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:46,361
of all the days for you to get
sent home, it had to be today?

829
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:47,663
Dad, it was a freak accident!

830
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:48,900
Don't!

831
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,402
What happened to Trevor?

832
00:37:54,737 --> 00:37:56,001
That's real mature, Dad.

833
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,044
Hey, Salamander.

834
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:03,650
Hey, Dad!

835
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,718
Whoa! What
happened to Trevor?

836
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:12,053
He ate a delicious
green marker for lunch.

837
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:14,055
- Why are you here?
- Shut up.

838
00:38:14,056 --> 00:38:16,359
Em, I thought you had to stay
to get ready for your play.

839
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,926
I need drugs.

840
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:19,895
Real drugs. The nurse will
only give me baby aspirin.

841
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:21,397
What happened to Trevor?

842
00:38:21,398 --> 00:38:22,665
Emily, we're not gonna pump you

843
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:23,899
full of medicine.
You're not a cyclist.

844
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,968
I'm not asking for steroids.
I need cough syrup, something.

845
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:29,571
Wait, Dad!
How was your interview?

846
00:38:29,572 --> 00:38:31,406
It was not a good fit.

847
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:33,075
But, you know?
We'll see what happens.

848
00:38:33,076 --> 00:38:34,142
It was fine.

849
00:38:34,143 --> 00:38:35,410
Try again next time.

850
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:36,578
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Brand.

851
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:38,747
I know she's not 100%, but...

852
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:40,950
as they say,
the show must go on.

853
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,818
So, if you could get her back here
by 3:00 for hair and makeup...

854
00:38:43,018 --> 00:38:44,621
that would be tremendous.

855
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:46,589
Em, you look terrible.

856
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,424
Maybe you should have
your understudy do it?

857
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:51,695
No! Nobody wears those tights but me.
Pharmacy, pronto!

858
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:54,731
Nobody wears the tights but her.

859
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:03,105
<i>Any available cashier
to register two.</i>

860
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:04,839
Extra strength or regular?

861
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,575
What do you think?

862
00:39:06,576 --> 00:39:08,109
Excuse me. Do you have
a Bumble Bee pacifier?

863
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,645
Does it have to be Bumble Bee?

864
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:10,812
It has to be the Bumble Bee.

865
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:12,046
Yes, because this
ain't gonna last.

866
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:13,047
Thank you.

867
00:39:13,414 --> 00:39:14,783
Hey, how'd the reading go?

868
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:16,100
<i>It could've gone better.</i>

869
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,453
<i>Honey, I'm sure it was great.</i>

870
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:20,055
Well...

871
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:24,526
<i>Well, you know what, I'm sure
it was not that bad, really.</i>

872
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:27,830
That girl with
the awful hair, I think.

873
00:39:27,831 --> 00:39:31,567
No, no. I thought, maybe...
No, it's bad.

874
00:39:31,568 --> 00:39:32,868
<i>It was bad.
It was lose-my-job bad.</i>

875
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:34,169
Really?

876
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,138
Anthony, come on!
No, please. Stop it.

877
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:38,741
- No, I'm just...
- Stop it!

878
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:40,475
What are you doing?
Why is Anthony with you?

879
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:41,910
He was suspended from school...

880
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:43,812
<i>for destroying school property.</i>

881
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:45,747
- What? What happened?
- <i>It's fine.</i>

882
00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:47,116
It was an accident. I'll
tell you about it later.

883
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:49,718
Okay, so, Em is getting
her cough syrup.

884
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,453
I'm taking Anthony
to his driver's test.

885
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:53,087
And, good news!

886
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,491
50 kids are coming over tonight.
The party is on!

887
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:56,725
<i>Boy, this is...</i>

888
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:59,160
- Maybe I should meet you. I'm not far.
- <i>It's fine!</i>

889
00:39:59,161 --> 00:40:01,997
Hon, I'm totally... Hold on.

890
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:03,899
No, we don't have one.

891
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,848
Daddy wishes he
could swear right now.

892
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,870
Hey, question.

893
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:09,671
Permanent marker,
do you know if it's poisonous?

894
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:11,239
Because he might
have ingested some.

895
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,508
What?

896
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:13,810
- <i>Ben!</i>
- Honey, honey...

897
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,176
- <i>I'm coming!</i>
- No, no, no! I'm good.

898
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:16,756
Tell Trevor Mama's on her way!

899
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,685
Nobody's home.

900
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:24,686
Call 'em, dude.

901
00:40:30,772 --> 00:40:33,194
Anthony, are you sure
you're up for this today?

902
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:35,631
Dad, it's now or never.
I promised Celia.

903
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:38,933
All right. Well, anything worth
doing is worth doing well.

904
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:40,934
Try not to kill anybody.

905
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:44,942
Hello. Yeah.

906
00:40:45,942 --> 00:40:48,944
I'm not gonna be back for a
while, so, the gate's open.

907
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:50,678
Just go in,
start setting everything up.

908
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,080
<i>Are you sure you
guys can handle this?</i>

909
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:53,816
Yeah, yeah, no problem.
We'll be ready to party.

910
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:54,950
<i>Okay.</i>

911
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:56,118
- Okay, great.
- <i>See you later.</i>

912
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,752
Thanks.

913
00:40:57,753 --> 00:41:00,089
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

914
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,091
Emily, just the recommended
dosage, please.

915
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,959
That stuff's pretty strong.

916
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,093
Hi, guys.

917
00:41:05,094 --> 00:41:06,562
Hey, there's Mama.

918
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:07,830
Why is my baby green?

919
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:08,964
Well, things went
a little awry today.

920
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:10,064
Honey.

921
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:11,066
- Look who it is.
- Ben, he's green.

922
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:12,267
- I know.
- What is this?

923
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:15,236
It's marker. It's fine. How did it go?
How was the reading?

924
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:16,738
It was awful.
I think I pretty much

925
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:18,107
flushed my career
down the potty.

926
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,241
Why, what happened?

927
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:20,927
Never mind.
Can I have the wipes?

928
00:41:23,012 --> 00:41:24,846
- Dad!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

929
00:41:24,847 --> 00:41:26,848
I told you this day was cursed.

930
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:27,884
Sorry.

931
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,151
<i>Cooper. Anthony Cooper.</i>

932
00:41:30,152 --> 00:41:31,252
- All right, wish me luck.
- Good luck, baby.

933
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:33,721
- Here you go.
- <i>Anthony Cooper.</i>

934
00:41:33,722 --> 00:41:35,591
Wait, Anthony!

935
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:37,125
Please don't do it today.
You're gonna fail.

936
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:38,227
Alexander...

937
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:39,727
give your brother
some space, please.

938
00:41:39,728 --> 00:41:40,995
Yeah, the next time
you see this face,

939
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:41,997
it's gonna be on
my driver's license.

940
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:43,198
It's not coming off.

941
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,600
Just hurry up!
I need to get to my play.

942
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:45,634
What kind of a person...

943
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:46,836
It's not poisonous.

944
00:41:47,836 --> 00:41:49,882
I don't think it's poisonous.

945
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:00,249
Hi, I'm Anthony.
I'm really excited...

946
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,384
There are only two things
you need to know.

947
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:04,752
My name is Ms. Suggs and I'll
be your driving examiner.

948
00:42:04,753 --> 00:42:07,689
Now, you may be the big man
on campus out there...

949
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,585
but in this minivan,
I'm the B.M.O.C.

950
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:11,326
You get me?

951
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:15,032
Now put your hands at 10 and 2,
and show me what you can do.

952
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:18,768
Hi, Mom, how you doing?

953
00:42:19,768 --> 00:42:21,770
How's your day going so far?

954
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:23,772
- Okay, I'm just gonna...
- What?

955
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:25,908
Just make this little call.

956
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:26,909
Okay.

957
00:42:30,146 --> 00:42:31,880
Yeah, it's...

958
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,151
Cooper!
Where are you?

959
00:42:36,152 --> 00:42:38,319
<i>My family had
a little situation, so...</i>

960
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,189
Really? That's funny.

961
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,192
Because we're having a little
bit of a situation here!

962
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,928
<i>The phones are going crazy.</i>

963
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:47,930
What happened at that reading?

964
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:49,665
Well, it was
a really good crowd.

965
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:51,299
It was a big, big crowd.
Big turnout.

966
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,337
And the parents seemed
to have a lot to say.

967
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:57,805
- They responded.
- <i>Did they?</i>

968
00:42:57,806 --> 00:43:01,377
Did they respond to Dick Van
Dyke asking their toddlers...

969
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:04,078
if they could take
a dump like a dog?

970
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,080
<i>I thought I could count on you.</i>

971
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:08,417
We'll discuss this later.

972
00:43:08,418 --> 00:43:10,682
I look forward to...
I look forward to that.

973
00:43:17,427 --> 00:43:21,164
Tell me something, Anthony.
Are you a senior citizen?

974
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:23,966
No, ma'am.

975
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:26,234
Well, then why are you driving 15
miles an hour in a 25 mile zone?

976
00:43:26,235 --> 00:43:27,672
Come on, speed it up.

977
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:32,110
That's right.
That is right. Boy.

978
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,052
Change lanes.

979
00:43:43,052 --> 00:43:45,105
Now, I want you to
take a right up here.

980
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:52,996
All right. Okay.

981
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:01,236
Celia's calling.

982
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:03,872
It's my girlfriend. Probably
wants to talk prom plans.

983
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:08,276
Tonight's the prom. Well,
I'll just ignore that.

984
00:44:08,277 --> 00:44:11,014
It seems like she's very
anxious to talk to you.

985
00:44:12,014 --> 00:44:13,781
No. No, no. I'm driving.

986
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:15,984
I would never answer
the phone when I'm driving.

987
00:44:15,985 --> 00:44:17,085
No.

988
00:44:17,086 --> 00:44:18,120
No matter what circumstance.

989
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:20,823
But, you know, proms
don't happen every day.

990
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,025
That's true.

991
00:44:22,686 --> 00:44:25,160
You sure? It'll just be super quick.
It's not...

992
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:28,964
What's important to
you is important to me.

993
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:29,965
Right?

994
00:44:32,276 --> 00:44:34,803
Hey, Celia. I can't really
talk right now, but...

995
00:44:34,804 --> 00:44:37,772
- Put the phone down!
- What?

996
00:44:37,773 --> 00:44:40,109
Put the mobile device down now!

997
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,277
Hey, eyes on the road!

998
00:44:42,277 --> 00:44:43,280
No, no!

999
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:48,157
You're gonna kill us!

1000
00:44:55,157 --> 00:44:56,368
What is wrong with you?

1001
00:44:58,327 --> 00:44:59,794
What are you doing?

1002
00:44:59,795 --> 00:45:03,237
What are you... What are you doing?
You fool!

1003
00:45:08,237 --> 00:45:10,071
You tricked me!

1004
00:45:10,072 --> 00:45:12,073
Get outta this car.

1005
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:13,442
- You get out of this car.
- You're evil!

1006
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:15,042
You prom creep!

1007
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:17,078
- I don't think he passed.
- Get out!

1008
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:18,894
Get out!

1009
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:40,268
This is your fault.

1010
00:45:40,269 --> 00:45:42,069
If you hadn't caused a fight
between me and Celia...

1011
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,105
I would've never
picked up that call...

1012
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:44,473
- and failed my test.
- No, no, no.

1013
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:46,508
Anthony, you are not passing
the blame on this one.

1014
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:49,111
I told you today might not be
a good day to take the test.

1015
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:50,379
Dad, I had to take
the test today.

1016
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,513
No, you didn't have
to take the test today.

1017
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:53,281
It is all Alexander's fault.

1018
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,317
If he hadn't dropped Trevor's
paci down the disposal...

1019
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:57,821
I never would have rehearsed
in a cold car and gotten sick.

1020
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,355
That's also your fault.

1021
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,055
If you hadn't left the battery
on in my car all night...

1022
00:46:01,056 --> 00:46:02,223
I wouldn't have
been late to work...

1023
00:46:02,224 --> 00:46:03,959
and Dick Van Dyke
wouldn't be mad at me.

1024
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,227
Chim Chiminey wants to kill me!
Can you imagine?

1025
00:46:06,228 --> 00:46:09,198
Mom, Trevor was crying! Where
was I supposed to rehearse?

1026
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,533
How were you able to hit every
parking meter on that street?

1027
00:46:12,534 --> 00:46:14,303
When I was in the bathroom this
morning, Mom saw me naked!

1028
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,305
I don't think you
left a speck of paint!

1029
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,607
Her fault!
She's an evil woman.

1030
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:21,343
Boom, boom, boom,
one right after the other.

1031
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:22,478
Stop, you guys!

1032
00:46:23,478 --> 00:46:25,315
Okay, stop!

1033
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:28,149
It was my fault.

1034
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,352
I'm to blame for all of it.
For everything.

1035
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:32,955
Yeah, see? I told you.

1036
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,488
No, hold on, hold on.

1037
00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:36,959
Alexander, what are you saying?

1038
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,859
Okay, look.

1039
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,395
Last night I made
myself a birthday sundae

1040
00:46:40,396 --> 00:46:42,064
and I made a wish on a candle...

1041
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:45,366
and I think I cursed
this day for all of you.

1042
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:47,134
- You did what?
- I'm sorry.

1043
00:46:47,135 --> 00:46:48,403
I just wanted you guys
to know what it was like...

1044
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:51,305
to have a massively
horrible, terrible day.

1045
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:53,174
So I wished it...

1046
00:46:53,175 --> 00:46:55,142
and now you're all having one.

1047
00:46:55,143 --> 00:46:56,812
Alexander, as
incredible as it would be...

1048
00:46:57,012 --> 00:46:59,113
for you to have that kind
of supernatural ability...

1049
00:46:59,114 --> 00:47:00,348
I don't think you can
actually curse a day, buddy.

1050
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:02,551
Yeah, sweetie,
this isn't your fault.

1051
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:03,819
We just bit off more than
we could chew today...

1052
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:05,187
and it isn't going our way.

1053
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:06,767
No, look, I did curse the day.

1054
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:09,424
I don't know how,
but I did, and it worked.

1055
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:11,192
And now Emily's
gonna miss her play...

1056
00:47:11,193 --> 00:47:14,596
and Anthony's not gonna be able
to drive Celia to the prom.

1057
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:17,165
He's been waiting all year to make
out with her in the back of the van.

1058
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,033
Okay, we don't
need to hear that.

1059
00:47:19,034 --> 00:47:20,204
Okay, I'm sorry.

1060
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:22,940
I'm really sorry.

1061
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,341
Just forget my party.

1062
00:47:26,342 --> 00:47:28,112
It'll be a disaster anyway.

1063
00:47:30,112 --> 00:47:31,218
Apology not accepted.

1064
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:35,651
Look...

1065
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:40,087
this day is not ruined, because
this day is not over yet.

1066
00:47:40,088 --> 00:47:41,390
Dad, you're so right.

1067
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:44,625
I may be sick, but there's no
way I'm missing opening night.

1068
00:47:44,626 --> 00:47:46,261
I may have wrecked the van...

1069
00:47:46,262 --> 00:47:48,997
but I'm not missing prom with Celia.
I can't.

1070
00:47:48,998 --> 00:47:53,502
Look, we are not going to let
this day get the better of us.

1071
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:54,703
It's like last week at Target

1072
00:47:54,704 --> 00:47:56,971
when Dad lost
Trevor for 45 minutes.

1073
00:47:56,972 --> 00:47:57,807
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1074
00:47:58,007 --> 00:47:59,942
And the store manager
wanted to call the cops...

1075
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,977
but Dad said, "No!"

1076
00:48:01,978 --> 00:48:03,511
- We found him.
- "We are gonna keep looking."

1077
00:48:03,512 --> 00:48:04,578
We will keep
looking for my baby?

1078
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:05,980
"We will find my baby."

1079
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:07,249
They sealed the doors.
It was fine.

1080
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,250
- What's wrong with you?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1081
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:11,085
Okay, guys, okay.

1082
00:48:11,086 --> 00:48:12,386
It's past 3:00, so if we're
gonna go, we gotta do this now.

1083
00:48:12,387 --> 00:48:13,988
Are we ready, Coopers?

1084
00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:15,991
All right! Clap those hands
if you believe in fairies!

1085
00:48:15,992 --> 00:48:17,526
Emily, are you okay?

1086
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:20,962
Mom! Positivism.
Let's do this thing.

1087
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:22,363
Get in there, get in there.

1088
00:48:22,364 --> 00:48:24,735
- Buckle, buckle!
- Buckle, buckle!

1089
00:48:25,735 --> 00:48:28,270
Go, go, go, go, go!

1090
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:30,973
It seems we may have accidentally
given your tux away.

1091
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:32,073
Well, get it back.

1092
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:34,142
Sir, I cannot
un-tux a client.

1093
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:36,278
My sister's Peter Pan and we've
got 10 minutes till curtain.

1094
00:48:36,279 --> 00:48:38,148
You better
un-tux something.

1095
00:48:40,148 --> 00:48:43,019
There is one option. You might
be able to pull it off.

1096
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:45,967
All right, fire up.
Come on, let's go.

1097
00:49:00,436 --> 00:49:01,770
Coopers on the move!

1098
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:03,171
We got it.

1099
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:04,804
All right.
Anthony, find a seat.

1100
00:49:06,108 --> 00:49:07,274
Break a leg, Em.

1101
00:49:07,275 --> 00:49:08,442
I'm here!

1102
00:49:08,443 --> 00:49:09,477
Get some more of this.

1103
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:11,413
Honey? Hon, hon.

1104
00:49:11,414 --> 00:49:14,052
Em. Em. Sweetie, I think
you've had plenty of that.

1105
00:49:16,052 --> 00:49:17,319
It's okay, honey.

1106
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,187
- Peter Pan is here, everybody!
- Excuse me, people.

Excuse me, everyone.

All right.

1112
00:49:29,197 --> 00:49:30,333
I love your outfit.

Okay.

1114
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:36,071
I said 3:00.

1115
00:49:36,072 --> 00:49:38,205
You have no idea the kind
of day we are having.

1116
00:49:38,206 --> 00:49:39,406
It's a miracle we're here.

1117
00:49:39,407 --> 00:49:41,410
Well, you're late, which is
not professional behavior.

1118
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,210
No! And it's not professional...

1119
00:49:43,211 --> 00:49:45,212
because this is an eighth grade
production of <i>Peter Pan.</i>

1120
00:49:45,213 --> 00:49:48,149
And if you could take
one look at our minivan...

1121
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,051
Mr. Brand,
I am not somebody

that you wanna
mess with right now.

1123
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,522
So grab her some green
tights and a harness...

1124
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:56,191
and fire up her Tinker Bell!

go for your hair.

Yeah.

What sort of story?

1138
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,801
The best sort.

1139
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:43,337
One filled with magic and
fairies and savage pirates...

1140

- Hello! How are you?
- What's wrong with her?

1145
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,283
It must be the cough syrup.

You did?

1199
00:53:30,306 --> 00:53:33,622
No, I'm not surprised. I thought
it was a killer interview also.

1200
00:53:36,811 --> 00:53:39,848
You wanna meet? Okay.

1201
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,850
Well, now actually
isn't a really good time.

1202
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,817
No. No, no, no.

1203

- Go, go, go!
- Drinks at Nagamaki?

1204
00:53:45,387 --> 00:53:46,921
- Go!
- Could you hold on a second, Greg?

1205
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:48,989
Alexander, I appreciate
what you're trying to do...

1206
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,692
but our plate is full.

1207
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:52,826
We got too much going
on tonight, kiddo.

1208
00:53:52,827 --> 00:53:54,995

1209
00:53:54,996 --> 00:53:56,404
just go for it!

1210
00:54:01,296 --> 00:54:02,770
Greg, we're gonna go for it.

at Nagamaki later, okay?

1212
00:54:05,007 --> 00:54:09,678
Okay. Good. I look forward to it.
Thanks. Bye-bye.

1214
00:54:10,746 --> 00:54:13,348
Okay. I reek.

1215
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:16,451
You do. Oh, look. Wait.

1216
00:54:16,452 --> 00:54:18,852
This looks like your size.

1217
00:54:18,853 --> 00:54:20,988
I'm not going to
wear a pirate blouse.

1218
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:23,632
Pirate or puke, your choice.

1219
00:54:30,632 --> 00:54:33,033
It's okay, Em.

1220
00:54:33,034 --> 00:54:36,608
It took a lot of courage to fly
out on that stage tonight.

1221
00:54:39,608 --> 00:54:42,477
Do you have any idea
how proud we are of you?

1222
00:54:42,478 --> 00:54:45,846
You've always just
put yourself out there.

1223
00:54:45,847 --> 00:54:48,482
You are fearless.

1224
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:50,584
You're willing to show the
world who you really are.

1225
00:54:50,585 --> 00:54:52,757
That's amazing.

1226
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,890
But if you're ever about to
take the stage on Broadway...

1227
00:54:56,891 --> 00:54:59,993
and you decide to drink a bottle
of cough syrup, give me a call.

1228
00:54:59,994 --> 00:55:01,763
Let me talk you out of it.

1229
00:55:01,764 --> 00:55:04,605
Ladies, care to
do some pillaging?

1230
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:11,166
Okay. All right.

1231
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:39,933
All right,
how did I end up blue?

1232
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:41,169
Celia's gonna love it.

1233
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:42,803
It's totally retro.

1234
00:55:42,804 --> 00:55:43,837
Just own it, kiddo.

1235
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:46,677
You look ridiculous.

1236
00:55:49,677 --> 00:55:51,684
Go get your Duchess, Duke.

1237
00:55:55,684 --> 00:55:57,086
My little boy...

1238
00:55:58,086 --> 00:55:59,956
in a tuxedo, going to prom...

1239
00:56:00,956 --> 00:56:03,425
in sneakers.

1240
00:56:13,202 --> 00:56:15,970
Wow. You look amazing.

1241
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:19,009
What are you wearing?
You look like Willy Wonka.

1242
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,641
I'm trying something different.

1243
00:56:26,614 --> 00:56:27,614
What's going on?

1244
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:30,852
Oh...

1245
00:56:30,853 --> 00:56:33,824
Yeah, I kind of
failed my driver's test.

1246
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:35,942
Oops.

1247
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,311
You look beautiful, Celia.

1248
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:56,611
'Course I do.

1249
00:56:56,612 --> 00:56:58,680
Yeah, that's a sick dress.

1250
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:01,049
I hope this isn't too
much wind for you, Celia.

1251
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,592
It's actually helping
with the vomit smell.

1252
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,803
So is everybody hungry?

1253
00:57:11,025 --> 00:57:12,893
- I am.
- I am.

1254
00:57:12,894 --> 00:57:14,562
They're coming to dinner?

1255
00:57:14,563 --> 00:57:17,037
Don't worry. They're not
gonna sit at our table.

1256
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:19,802
- How about some music?
- Yes. Yes.

1257
00:57:20,802 --> 00:57:22,636
Oh.

1258
00:57:22,637 --> 00:57:24,512
No surprise, the radio's broken.

1259
00:57:58,072 --> 00:58:00,757
This is just something that
we do for fun sometimes.

1260
00:58:04,612 --> 00:58:06,820
Figured it'd make you laugh.

1261
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,555
We're going to Nagamaki!

1262
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:15,223
What? Are you
kidding me?

1263
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:17,258
- Nagamaki!
- They cook it on the table.

1264
00:58:17,259 --> 00:58:18,959
They cook it right on the table.

1265
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,162
Like a fondue, but not.

1266
00:58:21,163 --> 00:58:23,848
Supposed to be a very authentic
Japanese restaurant.

1267
00:58:35,576 --> 00:58:36,944
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

1268
00:58:36,945 --> 00:58:38,614
Thank you.

1269
00:58:39,614 --> 00:58:41,883
<i>Konnichiwa.</i>
Welcome to Nagamaki!

1270
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:42,818
Table for two, please.

1271
00:58:43,018 --> 00:58:44,054
Right this way.

1272
00:58:46,054 --> 00:58:47,121
There they are.

1273
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:49,823
You okay?

1274
00:58:49,824 --> 00:58:52,093
Yeah.

1275
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:54,962
Honey, come on. Ben, you're
the smartest guy I know.

1276
00:58:54,963 --> 00:58:58,016
You're literally a rocket scientist.
You've got these guys.

1277
00:58:58,867 --> 00:59:00,237
Is it better tucked in?

1278
00:59:02,237 --> 00:59:04,105
You hesitated.
Here we go.

1279
00:59:04,106 --> 00:59:05,772
- Go get them, buccaneer.
- Thanks. Bye.

1280
00:59:05,773 --> 00:59:08,146
- Good luck.
- Good luck, good luck.

1281
00:59:11,146 --> 00:59:12,949
Hey, fellas.

1282
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:16,954
Is that a pirate's blouse?

1283
00:59:18,954 --> 00:59:19,954
Yaar!

1284
00:59:23,891 --> 00:59:25,392
Yes, it be!

1285
00:59:25,393 --> 00:59:27,060
Yaar-some!

1286
00:59:27,061 --> 00:59:28,764
Climb aboard, matey!

1287
00:59:29,764 --> 00:59:30,864
How's he doing?

1288
00:59:30,865 --> 00:59:32,232
He looks like he's having fun.

1289
00:59:32,233 --> 00:59:33,301
He does?

1290
00:59:33,302 --> 00:59:34,736
They look impressed.

1291
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,038
Oh, good.

1292
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:39,207
That is exactly what I am talking about.
You have multi-players...

1293
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,908
<i>Survivor-</i> style.

1294
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:42,310
It's <i>Survivor</i> on
a space station.

1295
00:59:42,311 --> 00:59:43,745
That's so cool. Multi-player.
What do you think?

1296
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,178
- Yoshi's gonna flip.
- It would be sick.

1297
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:46,948
To Ben.

1298
00:59:46,949 --> 00:59:48,116
The space pirates.

1299
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:49,907
- Space pirate.
- Space pirates.

1300
00:59:56,858 --> 00:59:58,543
Are you sure you're not adopted?

1301
01:00:00,047 --> 01:00:02,363
You should try a shrimp.
They're really good.

1302
01:00:02,364 --> 01:00:04,297
I'm allergic to shrimp.

1303
01:00:04,298 --> 01:00:06,930
You should know what your
girlfriend's allergic to.

1304
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:08,769
Yeah, sorry.

1305
01:00:10,172 --> 01:00:12,839
X-O-X-O?

1306
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:16,109
Anthony, I just can't believe, on the
most important night of our lives...

1307
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:18,379
you brought me to a place where
I have to watch my food...

1308
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,047
get cooked in front of me.

1309
01:00:20,048 --> 01:00:21,943
Who goes to Nagamaki
before the prom?

1310
01:00:22,717 --> 01:00:24,151
It's so amazing, okay?

1311
01:00:24,152 --> 01:00:26,721
Look! It's Hope and Dale
and Heather and Dave!

1312
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:28,756
Hey, guys.

1313
01:00:28,757 --> 01:00:30,425
Hey, Celia.
What's up, Anthony?

1314
01:00:31,994 --> 01:00:33,727
O-M-G!
You look beautiful.

1315
01:00:33,728 --> 01:00:35,163
- Love it.
- Thanks.

1316
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:36,997
Don't you guys
just love this place?

1317
01:00:36,998 --> 01:00:38,799
Totally.
I die for it.

1318
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,736
Oh, my God, me too.
I'll catch you guys later?

1319
01:00:41,737 --> 01:00:42,773
Okay.

1320
01:00:45,773 --> 01:00:48,010
Space pirate!
Space pirate! Space pirate!

1321
01:00:55,016 --> 01:00:56,286
Sake bomb!

1322
01:00:58,286 --> 01:01:00,497
It sounds like it
couldn't be going better.

1323
01:01:01,489 --> 01:01:03,128
Chef Ananda! Shrimp me.

1324
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:07,931
Oh!

1325
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:09,997
You ready?

1326
01:01:09,998 --> 01:01:11,304
Yeah, I'm ready.

1327
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:16,304
One! That was one.

1328
01:01:17,172 --> 01:01:18,305
Yeah!

1329
01:01:18,306 --> 01:01:19,941
Fire it up!

1330
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:21,743
Three!

1331
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:22,776
Four!

1332
01:01:22,777 --> 01:01:24,111
Keep it going.

1333
01:01:24,112 --> 01:01:25,112
Five!

1334
01:01:26,047 --> 01:01:27,217
Six!

1335
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,217
Seven!

1336
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,320
Eight!

1337
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,523
Nine!

1338
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:35,791
Ten!

1339
01:01:48,804 --> 01:01:49,804
Mom, Dad's on fire!

1340
01:01:50,005 --> 01:01:51,205
I hope so!

1341
01:01:51,206 --> 01:01:52,838
No, no, no.
He's really on fire!

1342
01:01:54,943 --> 01:01:56,810
Drop and roll, Ben.
Drop and roll.

1343
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:58,379
Drop and roll!

1344
01:01:58,380 --> 01:01:59,513
Stop, drop and roll, honey.

1345
01:01:59,514 --> 01:02:00,514
Dad?

1346
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,244
I still have me arms!

1347
01:02:35,951 --> 01:02:37,423
Thank you for your time.

1348
01:02:42,423 --> 01:02:47,227
Nice job, you really nailed it.
Really nailed it, Ben!

1349
01:02:47,228 --> 01:02:50,898
You know who you are? You're the
flaming pirate of Nagamaki!

1350
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:54,502
- Thank you!
- Whoa!

1351
01:02:54,503 --> 01:02:56,971
- Dad!
- Hey, guys.

1352
01:02:56,972 --> 01:02:58,272
Are you okay?

1353
01:02:58,273 --> 01:03:01,475
Yeah! I'm good.

1354
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:03,878
I'm fine.

1355
01:03:06,547 --> 01:03:07,885
It's all good.

1356
01:03:09,885 --> 01:03:10,885
It's all good.

1357
01:03:13,554 --> 01:03:14,721
Dad...

1358
01:03:14,722 --> 01:03:18,292
you don't always have to steer
your ship with positivity!

1359
01:03:18,293 --> 01:03:20,861
You keep us up and we
really appreciate it.

1360
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:23,132
But some days are just bad.

1361
01:03:24,132 --> 01:03:25,534
Nothing can fix it.

1362
01:03:26,534 --> 01:03:27,534
Trust me.

1363
01:03:28,302 --> 01:03:30,337
I would know.

1364
01:03:30,338 --> 01:03:32,311
At least we're all together now.

1365
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:38,581
It's my job to
take care of you guys.

1366
01:03:40,581 --> 01:03:43,049
And, make sure you
don't have bad days.

1367
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:46,254
- And when you do, it's on me!
- Ben.

1368
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,321
I think that you just...

1369
01:03:48,322 --> 01:03:52,929
got to have the bad days so you
can love the good days even more.

1370
01:03:54,929 --> 01:03:56,351
This day has been terrible!

1371
01:03:58,132 --> 01:03:59,135
Terrible day.

1372
01:04:00,135 --> 01:04:01,241
Yeah! A horrible day!

1373
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:04,907
A no-good...

1374
01:04:05,907 --> 01:04:07,077
Very bad day!

1375
01:04:12,947 --> 01:04:14,250
You know what I think?

1376
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:18,051
I think this day sucks!

1377
01:04:18,052 --> 01:04:19,120
Yes! It does.

1378
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:20,121
Thank you!

1379
01:04:22,056 --> 01:04:23,591
I love you guys.

1380
01:04:23,592 --> 01:04:24,592
Come here.

1381
01:04:28,563 --> 01:04:30,230
Can't breathe!

1382
01:04:30,231 --> 01:04:32,033
- You sure?
- Yeah, totally. Come with us.

1383
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,201
Okay, cool. All right, so, good news.
They have room...

1384
01:04:35,202 --> 01:04:37,045
and they said we
could go with them.

1385
01:04:40,474 --> 01:04:41,978
I don't know.

1386
01:04:42,978 --> 01:04:44,663
What do you mean,
you don't know?

1387
01:04:45,012 --> 01:04:48,381
We're not going in some busted-up
minivan with your crazy family.

1388
01:04:50,518 --> 01:04:52,045
You know what, go without me.

1389
01:04:53,088 --> 01:04:54,388
Excuse me?

1390
01:04:54,389 --> 01:04:57,258
You want me to go
to the prom without you?

1391
01:04:57,259 --> 01:04:59,727
Yes. That's what I want.

1392
01:04:59,728 --> 01:05:02,129
I'm sticking with
my family tonight.

1393
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:04,666
You're choosing them over me?

1394
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:07,567
Yes, Celia. I am.

1395
01:05:07,568 --> 01:05:09,403
Because they're my family.

1396
01:05:09,404 --> 01:05:12,207
And if they're crazy, then I
guess it makes me crazy, too.

1397
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:14,610
Have fun at the prom, Duchess.

1398
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:17,413
What are you doing?

1399
01:05:18,413 --> 01:05:20,282
Forget it.

1400
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:23,317
So, what? No prom?

1401
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:26,187
It's junior prom.
The real one's next year.

1402
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:28,522
What about Celia?

1403
01:05:28,523 --> 01:05:31,393
I realized there's more
important things than Celia.

1404
01:05:32,393 --> 01:05:34,595
- You sure?
- Very.

1405
01:05:34,596 --> 01:05:35,763
Good to have you onboard.

1406
01:05:35,764 --> 01:05:36,764
Thanks, Dad.

1407
01:05:40,168 --> 01:05:41,502
What was that for?

1408
01:05:41,503 --> 01:05:43,398
I didn't wish you
happy birthday yet.

1409

How did he get in there?

1414
01:06:37,224 --> 01:06:38,496
It's okay.

1415
01:06:41,496 --> 01:06:42,769
Dad, be careful.

1416
01:06:48,769 --> 01:06:50,770
There it goes.

01:06:50,771 --> 01:06:52,772
It's okay.

1419
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:00,121
Wow.

1420
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:07,964
Guys, there is
a kangaroo out there.

1421
01:07:09,657 --> 01:07:11,192
And an emu.

1422
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,259
And a cockatoo.

1423
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,529
And a wallaby.

1424
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:17,497
Wow,
you really know your animals.

1425
01:07:17,498 --> 01:07:19,732
Yeah, they're all Australian.
What's going on?

1426
01:07:19,733 --> 01:07:22,470
I don't think they were meant to
be presented in quite this way.

1427
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,337
- No.
- Hi!

1428
01:07:24,338 --> 01:07:26,172
You must be the Coopers.

1429
01:07:26,173 --> 01:07:29,276
Hey, yeah! This was supposed
to be a petting zoo?

1430
01:07:29,277 --> 01:07:31,812
A confined
Australian petting zoo.

1431
01:07:31,813 --> 01:07:34,448
Yeah, it is. One of the pens was
open and the kangaroo got out.

1432
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:36,216
Oh, yeah, the kangaroo.

1433
01:07:36,217 --> 01:07:38,533
There was also a
crocodile in our entry hall.

1434
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,754
So sorry about that.

1435
01:07:40,755 --> 01:07:43,124
We had him in the pool,
and we got distracted.

1436
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:45,426
You don't have to worry about it.
I'll put him back in the pen.

1437
01:07:45,427 --> 01:07:46,826
Okay, you got him
from here on out?

1438
01:07:46,827 --> 01:07:48,696
- Yeah!
- Okay, great. Thanks.

1439
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,430
We got you,
Mr. Cooper.

1440
01:07:50,431 --> 01:07:51,832
- It'll be fine, right?
- Yeah.

1441
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:53,299
- I don't think he's gonna get out again.
- No.

1442
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,535
You guys did all of this for me?

1443
01:07:55,536 --> 01:07:59,277
Yeah! Your mom and I thought you
might enjoy a night in the Outback.

1444
01:08:03,277 --> 01:08:04,845
You can pet him if you want.

1445
01:08:04,846 --> 01:08:05,846
His name's Winston.

1446
01:08:06,614 --> 01:08:07,856
Hello, Winston.

1447
01:08:14,856 --> 01:08:17,191
This is amazing.

1448
01:08:17,192 --> 01:08:19,859
Okay, guys? We've got
guests coming any minute.

1449
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,528
So here's what we have to do.

1450
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:24,264
Emily, you're on music.
Anthony, fire up the barbie.

1451
01:08:24,265 --> 01:08:25,899
Mom, snacks.

1452
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,568
Alexander, why don't
you help Mom keep

1453
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:29,303
Trevor away from
anything that will eat him?

1454
01:08:29,304 --> 01:08:31,272
Baby safety. 10-4.

1455
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,739
I think we're all good now.

1456
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:33,874
Super Coopers!

1457
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:34,908
Super Coopers!

1458
01:08:34,909 --> 01:08:36,743
Lenny! Get back here.

1459
01:08:36,744 --> 01:08:38,511
Lenny! Someone get him!

1460
01:08:38,512 --> 01:08:40,246
- I am on it!
- Ben!

1461
01:08:40,247 --> 01:08:41,614
Lenny!

1462
01:08:41,615 --> 01:08:42,750
- Ben!
- Dad?

1463
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:43,751
Lenny!

1464
01:08:53,627 --> 01:08:54,627
Okay!

1465
01:09:06,474 --> 01:09:07,914
That was pretty good!

1466
01:09:13,914 --> 01:09:15,385
Where are you?

1467
01:09:17,385 --> 01:09:18,532
Where are you?

1468
01:09:30,532 --> 01:09:31,532
Hey!

1469
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:33,867
Hey there...

1470
01:09:33,868 --> 01:09:35,404
party kangaroo.

1471
01:09:36,404 --> 01:09:37,770
I'm Ben...

1472
01:09:37,771 --> 01:09:41,375
and I want you to join me...

1473
01:09:41,376 --> 01:09:42,677
back at the party.

1474
01:09:46,948 --> 01:09:48,249
Yeah!

1475
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,582
Nice work, Mr. Cooper.

1476
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:50,684
Thank you, Dwayne.

1477
01:09:50,685 --> 01:09:52,826
Come here, Lenny.
Here we go.

1478
01:09:57,826 --> 01:09:59,762
What's up, man?

1479
01:10:01,762 --> 01:10:02,762
Pretty cool?

1480
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:05,299
This party's
gonna be killer, dude.

1481
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,934
Hey, guys!

1482
01:10:06,935 --> 01:10:08,792
Your dad is hardcore!

1483
01:10:30,792 --> 01:10:32,399
Dude, did you see that?

1484
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,965
- Hey! Hey!
- G'day.

1485
01:10:38,966 --> 01:10:40,800
You must be my
Australian cowboys.

1486
01:10:40,801 --> 01:10:42,702
- We sure are.
- Awesome!

1487
01:10:42,703 --> 01:10:45,873
Wow! You guys
are in good shape.

1488
01:10:54,381 --> 01:10:55,592
Hey, Nina, how are you?

1489
01:10:57,484 --> 01:10:59,486
It's the video game guys!

1490
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:03,323
- Yeah.
- No, it's a great time to talk.

1491
01:11:03,324 --> 01:11:05,640
No. Just a little bit
of the hair was singed.

1492
01:11:06,027 --> 01:11:07,661
- Really?
- I know.

1493
01:11:07,662 --> 01:11:08,761
- Really?
- I know.

1494
01:11:08,762 --> 01:11:10,368
That was a lot of shrimp.

1495
01:11:13,368 --> 01:11:14,773
Dude!

1496
01:11:18,773 --> 01:11:19,773
Hey, you came!

1497
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:21,542
Happy birthday!

1498
01:11:24,045 --> 01:11:25,411
This looks amazing!

1499
01:11:25,412 --> 01:11:26,412
Yeah, thanks.

1500
01:11:29,384 --> 01:11:32,786
Look, this has been
a really, really crazy day.

1501
01:11:32,787 --> 01:11:34,921
Looks like it turned
out pretty good to me.

1502
01:11:34,922 --> 01:11:35,922
Yeah.

1503
01:11:37,652 --> 01:11:39,126
Have a good weekend, Nina...

1504
01:11:39,127 --> 01:11:40,827
Have a good weekend, Greg.

1505
01:11:40,828 --> 01:11:42,429
- and thank you for everything.
- Thank you for your call.

1506
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:43,935
Thanks.

1507
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:48,514
How are you?
How was that call?

1508
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,705
It was great.
I got the job!

1509
01:11:51,706 --> 01:11:53,607
- You got the job?
- Yeah.

1510
01:11:53,608 --> 01:11:54,875
It's fantastic!

1511
01:11:54,876 --> 01:11:56,844
They thought I was fun!

1512
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:58,077
Even after you
singed your arms...

1513
01:11:58,078 --> 01:11:59,645
Even after
the thing and the thing.

1514
01:11:59,646 --> 01:12:00,880
"I still have me arms"?

1515
01:12:00,881 --> 01:12:03,417
I was a fiery pirate!
They loved it!

1516
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,120
Wow!

1517
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,054
You know what the best thing is?

1518
01:12:08,055 --> 01:12:09,889
As long as I'm
getting the work done...

1519
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,724
I can make my own hours.

1520
01:12:11,725 --> 01:12:12,826
I'll be able to still do carpool

1521
01:12:12,827 --> 01:12:14,462
and see the kids all the time.

1522
01:12:15,462 --> 01:12:17,598
Wow, I am so happy for you.

1523
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:20,634
What about you? What about your call?
How did it go?

1524
01:12:20,635 --> 01:12:22,870
Dick Van Dyke's
reading went viral.

1525
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:24,772
500,000 hits today.

1526
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,105
You're kidding me.

1527
01:12:26,106 --> 01:12:27,809
Nina says the book
is gonna be huge.

1528
01:12:28,009 --> 01:12:29,576
That is fantastic, sweetie!

1529
01:12:29,577 --> 01:12:30,611
Yeah...

1530
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:31,612
it's great!

1531
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:45,759
I cannot believe we
pulled this party off.

1532
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,864
We really turned
this day around.

1533
01:12:55,502 --> 01:12:56,877
What's that?

1534
01:13:02,877 --> 01:13:03,930
What are they doing?

1535
01:13:07,782 --> 01:13:09,649
That's the Thunder
from Down Under.

1536
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:11,617
They're supposed to be
authentic Australian cowboys.

1537
01:13:11,618 --> 01:13:12,920
They're not.

1538
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,455
No, no, no!

1539
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:16,089
Guys? Guys, PG!

1540
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:17,858
PG! Keep it PG!

1541
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:19,194
Please!

1542
01:13:20,194 --> 01:13:21,707
Oh, no.

1543
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:57,771
Go, Alex!
Go, Alex! Go, Alex! Go, Alex!

1544
