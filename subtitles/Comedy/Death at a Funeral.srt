1
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:25,548
Just straight through there
and to the left, please.

2
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:46,664
Okay.

3
00:03:53,477 --> 00:03:55,809
Would you like to, umm ...

4
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:15,532
Who's this?

5
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,324
Pardon me?

6
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:19,799
That's not my father.

7
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,765
Oh, shit, we've taken the wrong one.

8
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:29,005
Really sorry about that, sir.
We'll go back and get him.

9
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:38,316
Jesus.

10
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:06,612
They brought the wrong coffin.

11
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:08,542
You're joking.

12
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,715
Can you believe that?
It's a good job I checked.

13
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,918
Could have been having a service
for some random member of the public.

14
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:18,757
What kind of Mickey Mouse business are
these people running, anyway?

15
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:19,989
My God!

16
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:22,931
There's just so much to worry about,
you know. And Mum's in a state.

17
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,662
Robert's clearly not gonna do anything
to help, assuming he gets here at all.

18
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:27,101
Plus, this eulogy's just awful.

19
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:30,929
- I'm sure it's not awful, Daniel.
- Yeah, it is. It is.

20
00:05:31,142 --> 00:05:33,372
Everyone's going to be thinking,
"Why isn't Robert doing the eulogy?

21
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:35,605
"He's such a great writer."
Maybe I should just let him do it.

22
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,773
You are every bit as good a writer
as your brother, Daniel, if not better.

23
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:41,750
You've just got to let somebody else
read your novel.

24
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:44,310
Yeah, everything's going to be okay.

25
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:47,380
Once the funeral's over,
we've just got to focus

26
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:51,121
on moving out of here
and starting our own lives properly.

27
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,259
You did call them, didn't you, Daniel?

28
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:03,532
- You did put the deposit on the flat?
- Yeah, I'll sort it out, I promise.

29
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:11,413
God, I hate funerals. Don't you?
Really, they're just so depressing.

30
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:13,973
I don't know,
it's just the death and everything.

31
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:17,885
Do you know what I mean?
Do you agree, Justin? Justin?

32
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:19,889
Yeah, they're all right.

33
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:24,291
All right? Sorry, how could you
possibly think that they're all right?

34
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:27,728
Why are you even coming to this?
Anyway, you don't even know Daniel.

35
00:06:27,798 --> 00:06:29,231
I do know Daniel.
I met him a couple of times.

36
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,234
A couple of times.
But he's not a friend, is he?

37
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:32,599
No, not a friend.

38
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,399
Sorry, if you're going to smoke,

39
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:35,871
would you please put that
out of the window?

40
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,068
I'd really rather not get your cancer,
thank you very much.

41
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:42,135
I've got enough of my own problems
to be worrying about.

42
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:43,612
Yeah? Like what?

43
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:48,584
Like the discoloration on my wrist
that I keep telling you about. Look at it.

44
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:52,247
It's fucked. I'm fucked.

45
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:56,884
Why are you even coming?

46
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:00,720
It's because of Martha, isn't it?

47
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,397
Justin.

48
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,069
- Are you okay?
- Not too bad, thanks, Martha.

49
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:14,703
- I'm a bit nervous.
- About seeing my dad?

50
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:18,646
I just don't think I've ever been
so openly hated by anyone before.

51
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:21,810
He just hates everyone.
You mustn't take it to heart.

52
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:25,879
- You need to relax with him.
- I can't help it. He puts me on edge.

53
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:28,254
He's going to be more concerned
that his sister's husband's just died.

54
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:30,088
He's not going to be focused on you.

55
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:34,188
Anyway, I'm sure when I tell him that
we're getting married then, you know,

56
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:35,960
he'll start to learn to accept you.

57
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,297
- You sure about that?
- Of course.

58
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:41,395
I don't really see Victor
as the accepting type.

59
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:49,344
We're on our way to a funeral,
you wanker! Don't you have any respect?

60
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:54,914
Okay. Calm down.
It's all right, it's all right. Breathe.

61
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:57,683
In through your nose, okay?

62
00:07:57,922 --> 00:07:59,549
Deep breaths. You all right?

63
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:01,887
- Yeah.
- Fucking tosser.

64
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:13,293
Okay, I'm going to go down.

65
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,167
Hopefully they've brought
the right coffin this time.

66
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:17,104
- I'll come with you.
- No, it's okay. I can do it.

67
00:08:17,174 --> 00:08:19,836
Oh, no, I know you can. I'm just going
to come check on the seating.

68
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,935
Make sure there's enough room
for Uncle Alfie.

69
00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:24,640
Oh, shit. Shit! Shit!

70
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:28,209
Hello?

71
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:31,220
Hello, mate, how are you? All right?

72
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:32,721
Yeah.

73
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,759
Of course I remember Uncle Alfie. Yeah.

74
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:39,262
Absolutely fine. Yeah, yeah.
No, not a problem at all.

75
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,232
No. Of course I don't mind. All right.

76
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,269
Yeah, don't worry. All right.
No, it's fine, I promise.

77
00:08:46,337 --> 00:08:48,931
All right, we'll see you soon. Okay, bye.

78
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:50,200
Shit!

79
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:08,421
So, is this your father, sir?

80
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:14,155
Yes, it is, yes.

81
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:29,369
Hey, Mum. You all right?

82
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:32,142
I just don't know
what I'm going to do without him.

83
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:34,446
- What have I got to live for now?
- Mum, don't be silly.

84
00:09:34,518 --> 00:09:38,750
You've got your friends, family.
You've got me and Jane and Robert.

85
00:09:38,822 --> 00:09:40,255
Where is Robert?
Have you heard from him?

86
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:43,293
His plane was just landed at 10:00,
but he'll be here, don't worry.

87
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,851
Now, if there's anything I can do, Sandra.

88
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:49,660
Don't put your hand there, dear.
You'll leave smudge marks.

89
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:08,517
All right.
No, I'll get them to you this evening.

90
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:11,554
No, no can do this afternoon.
I've got a funeral.

91
00:10:11,622 --> 00:10:14,090
Yeah, my uncle died. Yeah, tragic.

92
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:16,956
No, I'm telling you, mate,
this is really powerful stuff.

93
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:19,655
Yeah, you really only need to take half.

94
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:22,297
No, trust me, they're going to blow
your fucking head off.

95
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:26,025
All right, I got to go. Sister's here.
I'll take them with me

96
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:29,561
and drop them by after the funeral.
Okay, catch you later. Bye.

97
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:44,954
Yeah, hang on.

98
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:52,389
Hi. How's it going?

99
00:10:52,463 --> 00:10:54,090
Troy, you're not ready.
Come on, we're gonna be late.

100
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:57,258
Just need to put on my trousers
and I'm done. You guys okay?

101
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:59,632
Simon's a bit freaked out.
We just had some arsehole driver

102
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:01,933
- almost ram us off the road.
- Really? Fucking bastards.

103
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:05,065
Make yourselves comfy.
I'll be two minutes.

104
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:08,305
- What are these pills all over the place?
- Troy's studying to be a pharmacist.

105
00:11:09,613 --> 00:11:12,173
- Are you okay?
- I'm a bit shaky.

106
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,817
Not much, just a...

107
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:16,718
Just a bit.

108
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:20,017
Here, have one of these.

109
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:24,126
- It'll calm you down.
- Are you sure?

110
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:28,221
Absolutely. It's just Valium.
I used to take them all the time.

111
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:30,789
It'll make you feel better, honestly.

112
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:32,631
Come on, open wide.

113
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:42,106
Ready.

114
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:48,548
Thank you.

115
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:55,888
Hello?

116
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,597
- Hello?
- Robert?

117
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:03,663
Robert.

118
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,131
- Hi, Mum.
- Oh, darling.

119
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:08,364
How are you, sweetheart?

120
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:12,475
- Hey.
- Hey.

121
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:14,773
- Hey, how are you doing? Yeah?
- Okay. Okay. I'm okay.

122
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:17,541
- Okay. Hi.
- Hi, Robert.

123
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:19,206
- How are you?
- Good. Good. How are you?

124
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:20,944
- Great.
- How was the flight?

125
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:23,350
Great. There was a lot of turbulence,
which was a bit worrying.

126
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,479
But, I mean,
I guess that's the thing about first class.

127
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:27,217
It doesn't matter how much you pay
for the ticket,

128
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,590
if the plane crashes,
you're all gonna end up dead.

129
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:33,057
Sorry.

130
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:36,129
No, no, I'll... Don't worry.

131
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:41,501
Oh, shit.

132
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:55,942
That's him.

133
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:59,586
Jesus, Howard, you didn't say he was
going to be in a fucking wheelchair.

134
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:17,063
Uncle Alfie. Hello.
We're here to take you to the funeral.

135
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,973
Where the fuck have you been?
You're late.

136
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:47,528
This is bloody grim, isn't it?

137
00:13:47,604 --> 00:13:51,199
- It's not supposed to be fun, Robert.
- I know, but Jesus.

138
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:54,669
I feel like my heart has been

139
00:13:55,112 --> 00:13:58,775
- wrenched out of my ribcage. It's awful.
- Well, that's grief for you.

140
00:13:59,016 --> 00:14:01,075
This is why I prefer not to have
close relationships with people.

141
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:03,619
There's too much emotion involved.

142
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:09,492
Well, I'm just glad that
you're gonna be here with Mum.

143
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,155
Well, yeah. Well, not for long,
'cause Jane and I are moving out.

144
00:14:14,464 --> 00:14:18,423
- Well, what about Mum?
- I was thinking maybe she'd like to

145
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:21,664
come to New York with you for a bit.

146
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:24,103
Well, don't be ridiculous.
I can't take her to New York.

147
00:14:24,174 --> 00:14:26,039
What am I gonna do with her,
take her to parties?

148
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:28,634
But we've already decided.
We're putting a deposit on a flat.

149
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:30,077
And I'm gonna need the money.

150
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:33,378
- What money?
- The money for all this, for the funeral.

151
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,145
You agreed to pay for half.

152
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:36,913
- Did I?
- Yeah.

153
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:39,622
- Oh, right.
- Yeah, so...

154
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:43,149
Yeah, well, I don't have it on me, Daniel.

155
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:45,717
I can get it to you in a few months.

156
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,855
In a few months? Robert, I need it now.
I need the money now.

157
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:49,865
Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen, is it?
'Cause I'm totally skint.

158
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:52,026
What do you mean you're skint?

159
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:54,263
You're a successful novelist.
You live in New York.

160
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:56,329
You've got a penthouse apartment
in New York. What do you mean?

161
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:58,397
Yeah, and do you have any idea
how much it costs for the upkeep?

162
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:01,842
Besides which, I've just had to lay out
a fortune for the flight over here.

163
00:15:01,912 --> 00:15:04,676
Do you know how much they're charging
for first class nowadays?

164
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,875
It's a fucking disgrace!

165
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:12,288
- So, poor old Uncle Eddie, eh?
- Yeah.

166
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:13,548
Yes.

167
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:16,286
Did you ever meet Uncle Eddie, Simon?

168
00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:18,090
Simon?

169
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:21,253
Was there a dog in here just now?

170
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:22,795
What?

171
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:26,629
I'm sure there was a dog in here.

172
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:29,465
What the hell are you talking about?

173
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,419
There's just nowhere to park.

174
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:53,187
- This is ridiculous.
- How about over there?

175
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:55,458
That guy's coming out over there.

176
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:56,692
- Oh, right.
- Take it, take it!

177
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,029
All right!

178
00:15:58,101 --> 00:15:59,090
What are you doing?

179
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:02,972
Are you mental?

180
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:08,039
Sorry.

181
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:10,939
Excuse me? Hi, sorry. Oh, hi, Martha.

182
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:15,610
- I was just about to park there, actually.
- Yeah, well, are you a relative, Howard?

183
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:18,120
- No, I'm not, but...
- Hey, Martha.

184
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:21,022
Who's that?

185
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,197
- What's happening?
- Did you see that?

186
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:32,462
She barely even looked at me.

187
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:34,094
I said, what's happening? Are we there?

188
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:36,264
Oh, my God,
we've got Uncle Alfie in the car.

189
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:39,775
I cannot believe I forgot to say
we've got Uncle Alfie in the car.

190
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:44,107
- All right! Keep your hair on!
- What the hell's going on?

191
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:45,170
Ow!!

192
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:47,182
She barely even looked.

193
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:59,758
It's very green here, isn't it? It's very...

194
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,423
- It's green!
- Simon.

195
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:06,596
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- What do you mean?

196
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,334
All this talking about phantom dogs
and things being green. What's going on?

197
00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:13,165
I don't know.

198
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:19,507
Wow!

199
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,417
Martha,

200
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:29,114
- is Simon normally like this?
- Of course he's not normally like this.

201
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:31,126
Something's not right.

202
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:33,891
Hello.

203
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:43,970
Oh, I think it must be the Valium.

204
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,632
- Valium?
- Yeah.

205
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,909
I gave him a Valium from your flat.

206
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:51,447
I think he's just not used to it.

207
00:17:52,215 --> 00:17:53,580
Oh, right.

208
00:17:57,387 --> 00:17:59,651
Do you want to get any closer?

209
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:01,054
You're going the wrong way.

210
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:02,113
Ow!

211
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:03,819
Stop the car, Howard.
I need to speak to Martha.

212
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:07,088
- What?
- I need to speak to her. I need to speak
to Martha.

213
00:18:07,197 --> 00:18:10,223
What about Alfie?
I need help with Uncle Alfie.

214
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,360
- We're gonna be late!
- Ow! Could you please stop doing that?

215
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:24,670
Thank you very much for coming.
It's lovely to see you. It won't be long.

216
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:28,313
It's weird being back here.
I feel so out of it.

217
00:18:28,385 --> 00:18:31,286
Well, it's because you're living
in a different country, you lose touch.

218
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:35,916
Who are these people, anyway?
I don't even recognize any of them.

219
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:38,324
Who the hell's that guy?

220
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:41,127
I have no idea. It's probably
a friend of Dad's from work or something.

221
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:44,964
So listen, you're telling me
that I have to pay for this entire funeral?

222
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:49,563
- I can't draw money out of thin air, Daniel.
- Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

223
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:53,302
- Daniel, how's everything going?
- Fine, thanks, Reverend Davidson.

224
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:55,537
We're just waiting for everyone to arrive,
then we can get started.

225
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,273
Great. Thank you.

226
00:18:57,948 --> 00:19:01,042
- Have you met my brother Robert?
- The writer, of course.

227
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:04,652
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've read several of your novels.

228
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:07,690
- Really?
- You must be very proud of your brother.

229
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:11,249
- Yes, very proud.
- And will you be making the eulogy today?

230
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:13,922
No, Daniel will be doing the eulogy.

231
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:16,460
Great.

232
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,826
I'll just make sure I have everything I need.

233
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,004
Listen, I think you should do the eulogy.

234
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:28,670
Everyone's expecting you to do it,
and I'll just make a mess of it, anyway.

235
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:30,372
Don't be silly. You'll be...

236
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:32,940
You'll be fine.

237
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:37,482
- All these can go through now.
- How's my little sister?

238
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:41,456
Just very sad.
He was a wonderful husband, wasn't he?

239
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:45,483
- So attentive. So devoted.
- Can I get you a cup of tea, Sandra?

240
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:49,521
Tea can do many things, Jane,
but it can't bring back the dead.

241
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:57,067
"My father was an exceptional man..."

242
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,166
"My father...
My father was an exceptional man."

243
00:20:00,243 --> 00:20:02,905
Daniel, have you called yet
about the deposit?

244
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:04,674
- No, I haven't yet, no.
- Why don't you give me the number,

245
00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:06,181
and I could do it?

246
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:09,241
Jane, don't make it obvious, but you see
that guy standing by the table?

247
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,584
See? Do you recognize him at all?
He's really staring at me.

248
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:15,750
Are you listening to me at all?
We have to put the deposit on that flat

249
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:18,919
- before it's too late. You understand?
- I know.

250
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:20,360
All right.

251
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:33,532
- Come on, get on with it.
- I am.

252
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:36,772
You'll break it.

253
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:38,981
Hurry up, we're late.

254
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:41,145
Oh, God!

255
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:45,280
"My father was an exceptional man."

256
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:49,282
My God, that Katie's grown up a bit,
hasn't she?

257
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,758
- What?
- Katie.

258
00:20:50,827 --> 00:20:53,853
She was like a little girl when I left,
and now she's...

259
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:57,559
She's fit.
I might go and have a chat with her.

260
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:59,795
Yeah, why don't you do that?

261
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:04,003
"My father was an exceptional man."

262
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:05,939
Hello there.

263
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:07,271
Hello.

264
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:11,611
I was really sorry to hear
about your father.

265
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:12,670
Mmm.

266
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:16,845
He always talked about you,
said you were a good son.

267
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:18,418
Thank you.

268
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:22,318
Did he ever mention me? Peter.

269
00:21:22,826 --> 00:21:25,522
Peter? No, I don't think so.
Were you friends with Dad?

270
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:26,584
Mmm-hmm.

271
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:30,855
Well, okay. Nice to meet you,
and thank you for coming.

272
00:21:36,306 --> 00:21:38,706
Come on.
Put your back into it.

273
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:40,242
Jesus!

274
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:45,941
- Push the bloody thing!
- I am pushing.

275
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:50,114
"My father was an exceptional man.
He was born..."

276
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:53,280
Daniel, I really think we should be
calling everyone in now

277
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:55,119
- to start the service.
- Sure.

278
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:57,716
Really, I'm only supposed to be here
until 3:00.

279
00:21:57,794 --> 00:22:00,228
Sure. Do you mind though if we wait
just five minutes for my Uncle Alfie?

280
00:22:00,296 --> 00:22:01,786
We really shouldn't start without him,
if possible.

281
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:04,026
Of course, of course.

282
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:10,595
I'll go...

283
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:19,407
Look.

284
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:21,946
Isn't it beautiful?

285
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:25,653
Martha, could I have a word? Excuse me.

286
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:29,018
- What? What is it?
- Okay, I have to tell you something.

287
00:22:29,092 --> 00:22:32,493
And I warn you in advance,
you're not gonna like it.

288
00:22:33,096 --> 00:22:34,723
Good to see you.
Thank you for coming as well.

289
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,824
- Daniel. Hello, Robert.
- Hello, Uncle Victor.

290
00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:40,893
- Uncle Victor, how are you?
- Well...

291
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:44,006
- Sad day.
- Yeah.

292
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:47,543
- So, how are things in New York?
- Great. Really good, yeah.

293
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,046
What's all this nonsense I hear about
you not doing the eulogy?

294
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:54,880
- That's right. Daniel's gonna do the eulogy.
- Well, that's a damn shame.

295
00:22:54,951 --> 00:22:57,249
I mean, I'm sure Daniel will be fine,

296
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,653
but after all,
you are the writer in the family.

297
00:23:01,124 --> 00:23:03,592
Will you just excuse me a second?

298
00:23:04,394 --> 00:23:06,988
So, any new books coming out?

299
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:09,531
- I'll just get my things together.
- Sure.

300
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:11,123
You all right?

301
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:14,466
Every single bloody person
wants Robert to do the eulogy.

302
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:17,768
He was my father, too, wasn't he? I'm just
as entitled to do the bloody eulogy.

303
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:20,605
Yes, of course you are. Of course you are.

304
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:23,771
And it's going to be the best bloody eulogy
anybody's ever heard.

305
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:27,578
Did you hear? Apparently,
Robert won't be doing the eulogy.

306
00:23:31,688 --> 00:23:34,623
- What did you just say?
- I said the Valium you gave to Simon

307
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:37,455
wasn't actually Valium.

308
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:40,894
It's an hallucinogenic concoction.

309
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:44,559
You know, stuff like acid, mescaline,
a little ketamine.

310
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:45,931
This isn't funny, Troy.

311
00:23:46,002 --> 00:23:48,971
I'm not being funny.
Look at him. He's off his tits!

312
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:53,734
You absolute little twat!

313
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:55,970
What the hell are you doing
leaving this stuff around your flat?

314
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:57,342
I didn't know someone was gonna take it,
did I?

315
00:23:57,413 --> 00:23:59,472
Who just goes into someone else's flat
and takes random pills?

316
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:01,608
They were in a Valium bottle.

317
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:04,682
Fuck, Troy!

318
00:24:04,754 --> 00:24:07,552
What the hell am I meant to do?
Should I tell him?

319
00:24:07,624 --> 00:24:11,116
No! Don't do that.
It'll just freak him out completely.

320
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:13,219
I think we should just keep
a very close eye on him.

321
00:24:13,296 --> 00:24:14,786
Make sure he doesn't get out of control.

322
00:24:14,864 --> 00:24:18,356
And don't let him spend too long
talking to one person.

323
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:20,124
Shit.

324
00:24:36,386 --> 00:24:38,286
Hey, Dad, how are you doing?

325
00:24:38,354 --> 00:24:39,821
- You're late.
- Hey, Dad.

326
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:44,019
- Hi, Troy. You missing university today?
- Yeah, not to worry, though. I'll catch up.

327
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:48,792
I know, I'm not worried about you.
I see you've brought your friend along.

328
00:24:48,865 --> 00:24:53,234
His name's Simon. Simon. And of course
I brought him along, he's my boyfriend.

329
00:24:53,303 --> 00:24:56,101
Martha. So good to see you.

330
00:24:56,172 --> 00:24:59,266
I'm so sorry, Aunt Sandra.
We're gonna miss Uncle Edward terribly.

331
00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:01,071
- Thank you.
- He was a great guy.

332
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:03,112
Yes. Yes, he was. Thank you, Troy.

333
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:06,239
Simon, this is my...

334
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:08,876
I'm so sorry about the death.

335
00:25:11,454 --> 00:25:14,480
I'm so sorry.

336
00:25:15,124 --> 00:25:17,422
- Thank you.
- And everything.

337
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:19,051
Come on, Simon.

338
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:35,306
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

339
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:39,678
I can't leave, can I? Aunt Sandra'll
never speak to me again. Oh, shit!

340
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:43,677
Hey, Martha.

341
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:04,173
- Hey, you look nice.
- I'm dressed for a funeral.

342
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,140
Yeah, but still.

343
00:26:06,743 --> 00:26:10,076
So, I heard about the engagement.
What's that about?

344
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,210
Who told you that?
I haven't even told my dad.

345
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:15,308
Is that the guy you're gonna marry?

346
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:18,616
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life with him?

347
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:20,549
Yep, that's him.

348
00:26:25,995 --> 00:26:29,795
- Simon?
- Martha. Martha.

349
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:31,925
You're slow. Come on!

350
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:38,741
- Any chance of a hand, Justin?
- Hey, lift it, lift it!

351
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:41,633
Lift it. Lift it. You got to lift it.

352
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:46,080
Hi, Daniel. Actually, there's something
I really wanted to talk to you about

353
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:47,980
- when you have a moment.
- Okay, that's great.

354
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:49,075
Do you mind if we do it later, though?

355
00:26:49,152 --> 00:26:50,813
'Cause my Uncle Alfie's just arrived and I...

356
00:26:51,054 --> 00:26:52,351
Sure.

357
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:54,983
Up!

358
00:26:56,225 --> 00:26:57,522
Come on!

359
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:00,694
Thank you, Justin.
Thank you so much, mate.

360
00:27:00,763 --> 00:27:02,492
Hope it wasn't too much hassle.

361
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:05,193
- How are you, Uncle Alfie?
- Terrible.

362
00:27:19,148 --> 00:27:23,482
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you could all kindly take your seats.

363
00:27:23,553 --> 00:27:26,021
We're about to begin the service.

364
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:32,460
Simon, please.

365
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:37,227
Move. Move.
Don't start yet. Don't start. Move.

366
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,605
Jesus, Howard, you stink!

367
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:31,515
Family and friends.

368
00:28:31,721 --> 00:28:35,521
Maybe, that's because you left me
to deal with Uncle Alfie on my own.

369
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:39,186
- Not to mention taking all the credit.
- Howard, can you please be quiet?

370
00:28:39,262 --> 00:28:42,595
And I'd like to start
with a favorite passage of Edward's

371
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:44,462
from the King James Bible.

372
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:48,300
It's the First Book of Samuel, Chapter 18.

373
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:55,234
Actually, Martha, just so you know,
we had Uncle Alfie in the car with us,

374
00:28:55,311 --> 00:28:57,939
and you took my parking space,
and I had to push him

375
00:28:58,014 --> 00:29:02,007
about half a mile up a hill, by myself,
and we almost missed the service.

376
00:29:02,084 --> 00:29:03,415
That was my parking space.

377
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:05,351
Listen, Howard, if you don't stop
poking me on the shoulder,

378
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:07,685
I am going to take you
outside and kick the living shit out of you.

379
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:09,190
- Do you understand me?
- What is going on?

380
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:10,589
She stole my parking space.

381
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,957
What do you mean
she stole your parking space?

382
00:29:12,028 --> 00:29:14,496
This is a funeral. Behave yourself.

383
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:21,430
"Then Jonathan and David
made a covenant,

384
00:29:21,504 --> 00:29:24,473
"because he loved him as his own soul.

385
00:29:25,475 --> 00:29:29,002
"And it came to pass
that the soul of Jonathan

386
00:29:29,078 --> 00:29:34,209
"was knit with the soul of David.
And Jonathan stripped himself

387
00:29:34,283 --> 00:29:38,379
"of the robe that was upon him
and gave it to David,

388
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:42,354
"and his garments, even to his sword,

389
00:29:42,725 --> 00:29:44,989
"and to his bow,

390
00:29:45,228 --> 00:29:47,492
"and to his girdle."

391
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,564
And now, we'll have a few words
from Edward's son,

392
00:29:55,638 --> 00:29:56,935
Daniel.

393
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,449
Hi, everyone.

394
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:15,082
Thanks to so many of you for coming.

395
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:18,919
I never realized Dad was so popular.

396
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:21,986
In fact, it seems like he's got more friends
now that he's dead

397
00:30:22,064 --> 00:30:23,793
than when he was alive.

398
00:30:38,814 --> 00:30:41,180
"My father was an exceptional man.

399
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:45,050
"He was born in 1938,
just a year before the war.

400
00:30:45,121 --> 00:30:47,715
"I'll never forget the time
when Dad took us to

401
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:52,318
"the place where he grew up,
just near a town called Crawley in Sussex.

402
00:30:53,095 --> 00:30:57,395
"It's changed a lot over the years, what
with the expansion of Gatwick airport,

403
00:30:57,466 --> 00:31:00,264
"and it's actually become
something of a commuter town now,

404
00:31:00,336 --> 00:31:03,669
"partly because of its proximity to London.

405
00:31:05,107 --> 00:31:09,009
"But at the time when my dad was young,
it was really quite pastoral.

406
00:31:09,078 --> 00:31:11,103
"Lots of fields

407
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:15,539
"and greenery, and Dad would roam
around the countryside for hours

408
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:18,485
"with his close boyhood friend, Bob.

409
00:31:18,554 --> 00:31:22,650
"He told me how they spent
their summer days riding their bikes..."

410
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:26,358
- Did you just see that?
- "...through the local cornfields..."

411
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:29,921
- The coffin, it just moved.
- "...and swimming in the lake.

412
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:31,330
"Dad's..."

413
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:34,300
I'm telling you, I saw it move.

414
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:39,402
"Dad's first job was working
after school as an apprentice,

415
00:31:41,544 --> 00:31:45,310
- "for an electrician named Mr. Thomson."
- There! It happened again!

416
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:48,817
- Simon, settle down.
- I'm telling you, the coffin is moving!

417
00:31:48,884 --> 00:31:51,045
Simon, just calm down.

418
00:31:51,754 --> 00:31:55,952
Please, God, the coffin is moving,
I tell you!

419
00:31:57,026 --> 00:32:00,393
- There's someone alive in there!
- Simon, where are you going?

420
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,690
What the hell is wrong with you all?

421
00:32:03,766 --> 00:32:05,961
- Don't you look at me like that!
- Simon.

422
00:32:06,035 --> 00:32:09,596
Can't you see? Open your eyes!

423
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:14,371
There's someone moving around in there!
Can't you see?

424
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:16,206
- Simon!
- What are you doing?

425
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:19,247
Simon, stop that! Simon, don't touch that!

426
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:20,805
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to let you out!

427
00:32:20,883 --> 00:32:22,441
What are you doing?

428
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,544
Oh, God!

429
00:32:32,294 --> 00:32:34,854
Mum, it's all right, it's all right.

430
00:32:40,803 --> 00:32:42,236
It's okay.

431
00:32:43,873 --> 00:32:46,865
Put the kettle on. All right, Mum, all right.

432
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:49,410
All right. Help me.

433
00:32:51,947 --> 00:32:55,348
That was unbelievable, wasn't it? All right.

434
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:59,249
If you'd all like to have
some lovely tea and cake,

435
00:32:59,488 --> 00:33:02,116
we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

436
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:08,160
- What the fuck was that about?
- Daniel, I am so sorry.

437
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,425
- I'm so sorry.
- The coffin was moving.

438
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:13,525
Just go back inside and I'll explain later.
I am so sorry.

439
00:33:13,602 --> 00:33:18,039
- There was a definite scratching sound.
- Sorry. Oh, God, please, please.

440
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:20,900
- Are you all right?
- No.

441
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:23,410
No, I haven't made the call
about the deposit yet.

442
00:33:26,148 --> 00:33:27,513
I'll kill him!

443
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:30,381
- Just calm down.
- I'm going to kill him!

444
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:32,315
- Dad, leave it.
- Leave it?

445
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:34,481
- He's completely wrecked the funeral!
- It wasn't his fault.

446
00:33:34,557 --> 00:33:36,525
What do you mean it wasn't his fault?

447
00:33:36,592 --> 00:33:38,856
Your Aunt Sandra is in tatters.

448
00:33:38,928 --> 00:33:41,761
I want him out of here right this minute.
Is that clear?

449
00:33:41,831 --> 00:33:46,063
Tell me you will have nothing to do
with that ridiculous man ever again.

450
00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:47,466
I'm sorry.

451
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:50,198
No, I can't do that.

452
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:51,864
Why not?

453
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:55,339
Because we're moving in together.

454
00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:57,072
Dear God.

455
00:33:57,146 --> 00:34:00,115
Have you completely lost your senses?

456
00:34:00,182 --> 00:34:01,581
He isn't actually like this.

457
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,983
He had some drugs
and they made him act all weird.

458
00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:08,319
Drugs? What drugs?

459
00:34:12,962 --> 00:34:16,420
He took some Valium
and he had a bad reaction.

460
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:21,636
- Valium?
- Yeah.

461
00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:30,642
We'll talk about this later.

462
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:40,146
- Simon.
- Martha.

463
00:34:40,222 --> 00:34:41,587
Yeah, okay. Come and sit down.

464
00:34:42,091 --> 00:34:44,685
Thank you, Janet, I appreciate that.
That's for sure.

465
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,388
- All right, mate?
- Hey. Hello, mate.

466
00:34:47,863 --> 00:34:49,160
That was awful. Wasn't it?

467
00:34:49,231 --> 00:34:51,324
Landing in front of your mum like that
like a dead trout.

468
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,267
- Yeah, Howard, please. Come on.
- Yeah, sorry.

469
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:58,363
It's just... You just never know
when it's gonna happen to you.

470
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,070
That's all. It's like with me, I've got...
It's like a weird patch of skin.

471
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:05,807
I've had that a couple of weeks.
I've absolutely no idea what that is.

472
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:08,509
Why don't you show it to my Uncle Victor?
You know, he's a doctor.

473
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:09,881
Yes.

474
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:13,116
Hello.

475
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:15,818
I swear I saw it moving.

476
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:19,892
I saw it moving. No one else saw.
No one else saw.

477
00:35:19,962 --> 00:35:22,795
I swear I saw it moving.
I must be going mad.

478
00:35:22,865 --> 00:35:25,527
Why are my hands so big?

479
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:29,298
Simon, listen to me.
I need to tell you something.

480
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,103
You know I gave you some Valium earlier?

481
00:35:34,877 --> 00:35:37,505
- Yes.
- Well,

482
00:35:38,047 --> 00:35:44,213
it turns out
that it wasn't actually Valium at all.

483
00:35:45,688 --> 00:35:47,246
Mmm-hmm.

484
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:50,882
- Can you hear me?
- Hello?

485
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,251
- Do you think we can start again now?
- I believe we can, yes.

486
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:55,957
- How are you feeling, Sandra?
- Much better, thank you.

487
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,924
Hello, Doctor.

488
00:35:59,001 --> 00:36:01,765
I've got this skin discoloration.
I've had it for a couple of weeks now.

489
00:36:01,837 --> 00:36:02,895
It's just not going anywhere.

490
00:36:02,972 --> 00:36:05,702
Now, I know it's just a small patch,
but it's weird.

491
00:36:05,774 --> 00:36:06,832
It does look weird, doesn't it?

492
00:36:06,909 --> 00:36:09,173
Victor, I'm going back now.

493
00:36:09,478 --> 00:36:11,241
You should probably go
and see a dermatologist.

494
00:36:11,313 --> 00:36:13,042
Why, what do you think it is?

495
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:15,675
Looks like some kind of pigment mutation.

496
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:16,809
A pigment mutation?

497
00:36:16,886 --> 00:36:20,686
Could be an allergic reaction
to shellfish, nuts.

498
00:36:20,756 --> 00:36:22,417
Nuts? What kind of nuts?

499
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:25,460
I don't know. Peanuts, almonds.
Excuse me.

500
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:32,931
Do you see now?

501
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:35,263
Yes.

502
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,040
Hallucinogenic.

503
00:36:45,848 --> 00:36:49,409
Now, my advice is to relax
and just go with the flow.

504
00:36:49,485 --> 00:36:51,680
You know, try and enjoy it.

505
00:36:51,754 --> 00:36:53,187
You!

506
00:36:54,456 --> 00:36:55,514
Simon!

507
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:59,960
- How long does it last?
- I don't know, about eight hours.

508
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:03,559
- Eight hours of this?
- Simon, let go!

509
00:37:03,632 --> 00:37:04,860
You!

510
00:37:06,035 --> 00:37:09,300
- Simon?
- Oh, my God, I'm going to be sick!

511
00:37:09,371 --> 00:37:10,633
No.

512
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:15,740
Simon, come back. Simon.

513
00:37:16,912 --> 00:37:19,403
- Hey, listen, Martha...
- Simon!

514
00:37:20,749 --> 00:37:23,684
Excuse me, sorry, he's going to be sick.
Excuse me.

515
00:37:23,752 --> 00:37:26,380
Sorry, mind out, mind out.
He's gonna be sick.

516
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:29,387
Come up here. Quick.

517
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:36,527
Do you want me... Simon?

518
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:42,099
Simon, are you okay?

519
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:44,500
Simon?

520
00:37:45,074 --> 00:37:47,042
Simon, let me in.

521
00:37:49,611 --> 00:37:51,476
- Simon.
- Martha.

522
00:37:52,214 --> 00:37:55,445
Did you happen to see a pill bottle? Shit!

523
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:57,007
- Simon?
- Right.

524
00:37:57,086 --> 00:37:59,384
- Are you okay? Simon?
- Keep it together.

525
00:37:59,455 --> 00:38:01,855
Keep it together. You can do this.

526
00:38:01,991 --> 00:38:04,289
- Simon.
- You're Simon Smith.

527
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:07,722
You're a solicitor.

528
00:38:07,796 --> 00:38:09,661
You're a solicitor.

529
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:12,957
Eight hours. It's no problem.

530
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:15,196
- Please, open the door.
- Eight hours he said.

531
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,898
- Simon?
- Where's my watch?

532
00:38:18,741 --> 00:38:21,266
- Please open the door.
- It's already been...

533
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:24,871
- I took Valium.
- Simon, open the door.

534
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:28,042
- Seven hours to go.
- Simon?

535
00:38:28,117 --> 00:38:31,052
God, Jesus, fuck!

536
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,246
Fuck!

537
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:34,846
It's nothing to worry about. It's fine.

538
00:38:34,923 --> 00:38:36,413
Jesus fuck!

539
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:39,050
Grief does strange things to people,
doesn't it?

540
00:38:39,128 --> 00:38:41,153
Yeah. Yeah.

541
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,562
If you remember, I had something
I wanted to talk to you about.

542
00:38:43,632 --> 00:38:45,190
Oh, yes, yes.

543
00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:47,201
- Is there someplace quiet we can go?
- Sure.

544
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:17,365
- Are you writing a book?
- Yes.

545
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:19,594
- Like your brother.
- Well, different from my brother, but...

546
00:39:19,668 --> 00:39:21,693
- He's a great writer, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.

547
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,260
So, anyway?

548
00:39:23,338 --> 00:39:27,866
Yes, actually, I have some photos
I wanted to show you.

549
00:39:28,043 --> 00:39:29,340
Okay.

550
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:31,546
- May I?
- Sure.

551
00:39:34,116 --> 00:39:38,018
We became quite close, your father and I,
in the last few months.

552
00:39:38,087 --> 00:39:39,952
Ended up spending
quite a lot of time together.

553
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:41,250
Right.

554
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,250
Here's me and your father
in Regent's Park.

555
00:39:44,326 --> 00:39:45,486
Oh, yeah.

556
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:49,327
Here we are on top
of one of those London buses.

557
00:39:49,398 --> 00:39:51,195
It's a terrible picture of me.

558
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:55,327
- So, where did you and my dad meet?
- Just around.

559
00:39:59,174 --> 00:40:00,334
Hello?

560
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:02,171
Simon.

561
00:40:03,645 --> 00:40:04,669
Are you all right?

562
00:40:04,746 --> 00:40:07,476
Wow. Yes.

563
00:40:08,016 --> 00:40:13,613
Yes, yes. Keep coming.
You, join the others.

564
00:40:14,223 --> 00:40:17,920
Join the others. Oh, you.

565
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:25,389
Oh, here, yes. Here we are
at a fancy costume party in Kensington.

566
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:29,096
That's your dad dressed up
as a Roman centurion.

567
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,309
Sorry, in what capacity
were you actually friends with my dad?

568
00:40:39,381 --> 00:40:42,873
I mean, I don't mean to be...
But he never mentioned you to me.

569
00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:47,615
And yet you have all these pictures
where you're going around like you're...

570
00:41:17,085 --> 00:41:20,282
Oh, God. Oh, my God. No.

571
00:41:23,325 --> 00:41:25,793
Now, I know this must come
as quite a shock to you.

572
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:28,386
I'm sure he would have told you himself,

573
00:41:28,463 --> 00:41:31,330
but I guess he wasn't sure
how you'd react.

574
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,061
- Does my mother know about this?
- No.

575
00:41:33,135 --> 00:41:34,363
- No.
- No, no.

576
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:37,462
And there's really no reason
why she should find out.

577
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:40,269
Just as long as I get what's owed to me.

578
00:41:40,776 --> 00:41:41,868
What?

579
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:45,169
Well, I think I deserve something.

580
00:41:46,081 --> 00:41:48,709
I mean, your father and I were lovers.

581
00:41:49,585 --> 00:41:52,645
No, he left me absolutely nothing
in his will.

582
00:41:53,789 --> 00:41:56,019
How do you think that makes me feel?

583
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:59,083
I'll tell you how that makes me feel.
Cheap.

584
00:41:59,761 --> 00:42:01,422
Like a cheap slut.

585
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:04,722
Don't you think I deserve something?

586
00:42:04,933 --> 00:42:06,560
What do you want?

587
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:11,005
Well, I think about £15,000 should do it.

588
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,364
£15,000?

589
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:17,308
- I'm supposed to be buying a flat.
- Well, that's up to you.

590
00:42:17,379 --> 00:42:19,142
Hang on, you hang on a minute.

591
00:42:19,214 --> 00:42:20,977
You think you can come in here
and show me

592
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:24,314
a few pictures of you and my dad on a bus
and that counts as proof?

593
00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:26,980
That's not fucking proof of anything.

594
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,657
What is that?

595
00:42:30,192 --> 00:42:31,659
Oh, Jesus!

596
00:42:32,394 --> 00:42:35,989
Now, I don't want to,
but I will go out there

597
00:42:36,064 --> 00:42:38,362
and I will show these photographs
to every single person.

598
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,867
Do you really want me to do that?

599
00:42:44,306 --> 00:42:47,036
You wait here. Wait here.

600
00:42:50,812 --> 00:42:54,270
Daniel, I was just telling George here
how when we were boys together,

601
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:58,649
your dad used to love to
make us all go skinny-dipping.

602
00:43:02,557 --> 00:43:04,286
I think she's fine.

603
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:18,068
Simon, open the door.

604
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:21,806
Anything I can do to help?

605
00:43:21,877 --> 00:43:24,903
- Not really, thanks.
- You got it all under control?

606
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,777
Simon?

607
00:43:27,749 --> 00:43:30,445
So what are you doing next weekend?
I've got a couple of tickets...

608
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:32,453
Look, Justin,
I've got a lot on my plate right now,

609
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:33,647
and I just can't deal with your shit.

610
00:43:33,722 --> 00:43:37,658
Now, can you please just go away?
Please?

611
00:43:40,962 --> 00:43:42,589
Simon?

612
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:49,299
- Hi, Robert. Can I talk to you for a second?
- Not now.

613
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:51,896
- Just give me five minutes.
- It's important. It's ever so important.

614
00:43:51,973 --> 00:43:53,907
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

615
00:43:54,376 --> 00:43:56,537
- What are you doing?
- Robert, listen.

616
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:05,949
You know that guy from before
that we didn't recognize? That little guy,

617
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:08,956
you know, the short guy, yeah?
I've just been with him in the study.

618
00:44:09,324 --> 00:44:13,454
- Yeah?
- And he showed me these pictures.

619
00:44:14,262 --> 00:44:16,162
- Yeah? Right.
- Of him and dad.

620
00:44:17,499 --> 00:44:21,094
- Of him and dad together.
- Right.

621
00:44:21,436 --> 00:44:23,199
Of him and Dad together
at parties in Kensington.

622
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:24,738
Look, Daniel, is this going anywhere?

623
00:44:24,806 --> 00:44:29,402
- For God's sake, he was shagging dad!
- Fuck off!

624
00:44:33,315 --> 00:44:35,340
- Are you shitting me?
- No, I'm not shitting you, I'm telling you.

625
00:44:35,417 --> 00:44:37,908
He showed me the pictures. I feel sick.

626
00:44:37,986 --> 00:44:42,047
So, wait, wait, what are you saying?
That Dad was a gay?

627
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:43,722
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

628
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,888
- And he was cheating on Mum?
- Well, evidently.

629
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:51,621
- With that little...
- Yes.

630
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:55,166
I know it's a bombshell, but the concern
right now is that he wants money.

631
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:56,534
- What do you mean he wants money?
- He wants money.

632
00:44:56,605 --> 00:44:58,800
- He wants £15,000.
- Tell him to go and fuck himself!

633
00:44:58,874 --> 00:45:00,774
No, you don't understand.
He's got the pictures.

634
00:45:00,842 --> 00:45:02,969
And if we don't give him the money,
he's gonna tell everybody here

635
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:04,511
the most intimate details of their sex life.

636
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:06,604
I don't wanna hear
the most intimate details of their sex life.

637
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:09,275
Exactly. So what are we gonna do?

638
00:45:10,218 --> 00:45:13,210
- Oh, shit.
- Think, then.

639
00:45:14,556 --> 00:45:16,547
Okay, all right.

640
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:23,964
This is a total fucking waste of time.
I don't know why I even bothered.

641
00:45:24,032 --> 00:45:26,262
I got dressed up and everything,
you know?

642
00:45:26,334 --> 00:45:28,302
I mean, how could she be more interested
in that idiot up there

643
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,201
than she is in me?

644
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:32,172
I'm telling you, Howard.
This world is severely fucked up.

645
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,764
- Sounds really serious, doesn't it?
- What?

646
00:45:33,842 --> 00:45:35,935
Pigment mutation.

647
00:45:38,146 --> 00:45:41,081
Oh, will you taste this?
I think it's got almonds in it.

648
00:45:41,149 --> 00:45:43,276
- So?
- So? Daniel's uncle said I'm allergic

649
00:45:43,351 --> 00:45:44,682
- to almonds.
- Well, don't eat it.

650
00:45:44,753 --> 00:45:46,778
Go on, please. Be a mate. Taste it.
Tell me what you think.

651
00:45:46,855 --> 00:45:48,755
- No.
- Go on, try it.

652
00:45:48,824 --> 00:45:50,815
- I don't want to.
- Please. Come on, do me a favor.

653
00:45:50,892 --> 00:45:54,020
- Can't you just do me a favor?
- Please fuck off!

654
00:45:56,465 --> 00:45:58,433
You haven't seen a pill bottle lying around,
have you?

655
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,161
Like a Valium pill bottle?

656
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:02,635
- No.
- Shit. Shit. Shit.

657
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,282
Shouldn't be long now.

658
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,954
- Shall we go inside?
- In a minute.

659
00:46:35,637 --> 00:46:37,264
Doctor, you know you...

660
00:46:48,717 --> 00:46:53,814
Hello. Sorry about... Well, you know.

661
00:46:54,055 --> 00:46:56,023
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sorry.

662
00:46:56,491 --> 00:46:59,927
Oh, God, it must be terrible
losing a husband.

663
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:02,793
Still, you're still so young. Relatively.

664
00:47:04,766 --> 00:47:09,760
Do you think you'll marry again?
Probably too soon to say, isn't it?

665
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:13,467
God, it's just terrible, isn't it,
that people die? Awful.

666
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:16,534
There was a guy that I know,
he got stabbed to death.

667
00:47:16,611 --> 00:47:20,069
And he called this guy's mother a moose.
The guy just...

668
00:47:20,148 --> 00:47:24,414
Just stabbed him right in the neck,
hit like a major artery.

669
00:47:24,486 --> 00:47:28,183
And there was blood, just...
You honestly would not believe how much

670
00:47:28,256 --> 00:47:32,522
just spurting absolutely everywhere.
And ridiculous thing is

671
00:47:32,594 --> 00:47:34,585
that the guy that did it told the police later

672
00:47:34,663 --> 00:47:37,427
he didn't even know what a moose was.

673
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:44,604
Has that cake got almonds in it?
It's not important, doesn't matter.

674
00:47:48,043 --> 00:47:53,140
- Excuse me.
- Mmm. Nice talk.

675
00:48:03,725 --> 00:48:04,885
I just don't think
Mum can handle it.

676
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,018
Let me rephrase the question.

677
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:08,426
What do you mean, you think it's best
if I pay him the money?

678
00:48:08,797 --> 00:48:10,526
You've been living off Mum and Dad
for long enough.

679
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:12,590
- You must have some money saved.
- I haven't been living...

680
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:16,501
- I've paid for this entire funeral, Robert.
- Now, wait a second.

681
00:48:16,571 --> 00:48:18,596
How do you know
this guy isn't bullshitting?

682
00:48:22,877 --> 00:48:24,242
Oh, my God!

683
00:48:27,082 --> 00:48:30,984
- Simon?
- Simon.

684
00:48:32,854 --> 00:48:38,258
- Simon? Simon?
- Simon. Simon.

685
00:48:40,528 --> 00:48:44,521
- Simon.
- Simon.

686
00:48:45,533 --> 00:48:48,991
- Si?
- Mon.

687
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,580
I think we're just about ready
to resume the service, so...

688
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:02,378
Would you mind giving us five minutes?

689
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:04,213
- Of course.
- Thanks.

690
00:49:07,288 --> 00:49:10,382
Hey, Danny, what is going on?

691
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:12,858
Listen, I'm really, really sorry,
but I'm afraid our moving out plans

692
00:49:12,927 --> 00:49:15,088
are gonna have to be
put on hold just for a little while.

693
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:17,154
- What do you mean? Why?
- I haven't got time to explain right now,

694
00:49:17,232 --> 00:49:19,291
but you know I wouldn't do this
unless I had a really good reason.

695
00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:22,928
- No. What's the reason?
- I can't explain right now. Okay.

696
00:49:32,213 --> 00:49:34,113
So you're the blackmailing prick.

697
00:49:35,483 --> 00:49:37,610
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing with that?

698
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:39,779
This is my manuscript.
This is not ready to be read by anyone.

699
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:43,153
Well, you shouldn't leave it lying around,
Daniel, if you don't want people to read it.

700
00:49:43,224 --> 00:49:46,455
- This is my office!
- Guys, can we just get to the point?

701
00:49:46,628 --> 00:49:48,255
Fine by me.

702
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,130
Fine. If I write you this check, okay,
that's the end of it. Yes?

703
00:49:54,202 --> 00:49:57,365
You give us the photos, then you stay out
of our lives forever, that's the deal, yeah?

704
00:49:57,439 --> 00:49:58,804
That's the deal.

705
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,357
- Is that your first attempt?
- What?

706
00:50:18,426 --> 00:50:22,522
- The novel. That's your first novel, isn't it?
- Yeah. So?

707
00:50:22,697 --> 00:50:24,164
No, nothing.

708
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:28,200
I tried writing once.
It didn't work for me, either.

709
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:33,069
I think it's like a gift.
You either have it or you don't.

710
00:50:34,442 --> 00:50:38,640
It must be hard for you though, Daniel,
living up to your brother's reputation.

711
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:42,080
You know, always living
in the shadow of a sibling like that.

712
00:50:42,684 --> 00:50:49,089
By the way, I read your latest novel.
Wow. Really good stuff.

713
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:51,553
Thanks.

714
00:50:53,361 --> 00:50:55,158
Right, that's it.

715
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:57,691
Daniel, what the hell are you doing?

716
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:00,929
There's no way I'm giving this twat
a single penny of my money.

717
00:51:01,069 --> 00:51:04,937
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No. Why should I? Why should I?

718
00:51:05,006 --> 00:51:07,566
He comes in here on the day of
our father's funeral, tries to blackmail us,

719
00:51:07,642 --> 00:51:09,872
and then he slags off my novel.
Who does he think he is?

720
00:51:09,978 --> 00:51:12,310
- He has the photos.
- Let him show the photos, I don't care.

721
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:15,577
- Daniel, it'll...
- No, Robert, I give up, okay? I give up.

722
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:19,381
I can't take anymore. If that's what
he's gonna do, then fine. Let him do it.

723
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,119
- Fine.
- Fine.

724
00:51:24,859 --> 00:51:30,388
- What? Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Please, get out of my way.

725
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:33,491
- Let's just discuss this a minute.
- There is nothing to discuss.

726
00:51:34,903 --> 00:51:38,498
- Get out of my way! Get off!
- We can talk about this.

727
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:43,906
Get up, Daniel! Daniel!

728
00:51:44,112 --> 00:51:45,101
Listen...

729
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,575
What are you doing, Robert?
What are you doing?

730
00:51:47,649 --> 00:51:49,708
- Just get some rope or something.
- Rope? What do you mean rope?

731
00:51:49,784 --> 00:51:50,978
I haven't got any rope.

732
00:51:51,052 --> 00:51:54,317
Get some cord or something.
There, from the curtain.

733
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,749
- Okay, here you go.
- Grab his legs.

734
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:03,362
Oh, God, Jesus Christ, Robert,
this is a really bad idea.

735
00:52:03,865 --> 00:52:09,633
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

736
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:48,475
- Fucking men.
- Tell me about it.

737
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:53,172
- Daniel, get that tie. Just get that tie.
- Why?

738
00:52:53,314 --> 00:52:55,111
What am I supposed to do with a tie?

739
00:52:55,183 --> 00:52:56,673
Do you want everybody to know
our dad is a poof?

740
00:52:56,751 --> 00:52:58,844
- Of course I don't.
- Stuff it in his mouth, then.

741
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,548
- This is ridiculous.
- Daniel, you know that cake...

742
00:53:01,623 --> 00:53:04,023
Jesus Christ, Howard.
Shut the fucking door!

743
00:53:04,092 --> 00:53:06,151
What's going on? Who's that?

744
00:53:06,227 --> 00:53:08,058
- He's having a fit.
- It's a seizure.

745
00:53:08,129 --> 00:53:11,064
Oh, God, really? I've just found
some Valium. Would that help?

746
00:53:11,165 --> 00:53:13,861
- Yeah, brilliant. Bring them here.
- How many?

747
00:53:13,935 --> 00:53:16,563
- I don't know, a handful.
- Really? Okay.

748
00:53:20,074 --> 00:53:21,905
Are they all in? Dropped one.

749
00:53:21,976 --> 00:53:26,072
Here. Open his mouth.
It's okay. It's all right.

750
00:53:27,015 --> 00:53:28,880
- You haven't seen a little brown pill bottle.
- Shut the door!

751
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,475
Jesus Christ, Howard!
I told you to lock the fucking door!

752
00:53:31,552 --> 00:53:33,713
- You said, "Shut the fucking door."
- What's going on?

753
00:53:33,788 --> 00:53:37,155
- Oh, he's having a fit.
- A fit? Then why is he all tied up?

754
00:53:47,669 --> 00:53:50,661
Hello. Hello.

755
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:52,338
Hang on, he's blackmailing you
over what?

756
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:54,875
- It's not important right now.
- What do you mean it's not important?

757
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:55,932
- It's personal.
- Well, why?

758
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:58,001
He said it's personal. That's enough.

759
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,206
Just trust us, okay?
This is not a good guy, you know.

760
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:01,976
- We can explain later.
- So, what are we gonna do with him?

761
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,883
- I don't know. What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

762
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:06,420
What do you mean you don't know?

763
00:54:06,487 --> 00:54:08,079
How long are we gonna keep him
tied up for?

764
00:54:08,156 --> 00:54:10,886
How long's the Valium gonna last?

765
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:12,119
- What?
- Valium?

766
00:54:12,193 --> 00:54:14,559
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, I found those Valium.

767
00:54:14,629 --> 00:54:17,325
We gave him a few to calm him down.
Thank you.

768
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:19,364
I think he's all right.

769
00:54:19,434 --> 00:54:22,164
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

770
00:54:24,238 --> 00:54:27,469
- What is it?
- Oh, fuck!

771
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:30,171
What?

772
00:54:33,247 --> 00:54:38,275
- What? What?
- The thing is, it's not actually Valium.

773
00:54:38,353 --> 00:54:42,050
It's acid, mostly. A little ketamine.
Simon took one these by mistake,

774
00:54:42,123 --> 00:54:44,489
- that's why he's been off his box.
- What are you doing with this stuff?

775
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,652
- They're for a friend!
- Hang on a minute.

776
00:54:46,728 --> 00:54:50,494
You're telling us that Martha's boyfriend,
who knocked over our father's coffin,

777
00:54:50,565 --> 00:54:51,930
had just one of these things?

778
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,331
- And you gave him how many?
- Five.

779
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:55,301
- Oh, Howard.
- What do you mean, "Oh, Howard"?

780
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,305
- You cannot blame me for this!
- Poor bastard.

781
00:54:58,439 --> 00:54:59,428
We should call an ambulance.

782
00:54:59,507 --> 00:55:00,769
You can't do that. I'll be screwed!

783
00:55:00,842 --> 00:55:04,778
He's right. They're gonna turn up and find
that he's been force fed with hard drugs.

784
00:55:04,946 --> 00:55:06,208
Well, what's gonna happen?
Is he gonna die?

785
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,269
Hmm?

786
00:55:07,515 --> 00:55:10,313
No. Shouldn't think so.

787
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:13,186
Daniel?

788
00:55:16,157 --> 00:55:17,681
Robert?

789
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,054
Be out in a minute, Mum.

790
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:21,287
Daniel.

791
00:55:21,362 --> 00:55:25,025
- We need to go outside.
- You two stay here and look after him.

792
00:55:27,068 --> 00:55:28,433
Hang on, look after him?

793
00:55:28,503 --> 00:55:30,437
What do you mean look after him?
What are we supposed to do?

794
00:55:30,505 --> 00:55:33,736
Just make sure he doesn't escape.
Lock the door behind us.

795
00:55:34,809 --> 00:55:37,004
- Daniel?
- Hey, Mum. How's it going?

796
00:55:37,078 --> 00:55:38,272
Reverend Davidson needs to speak to you.

797
00:55:38,346 --> 00:55:40,814
We were wondering if we might be able
to resume the service now.

798
00:55:40,882 --> 00:55:42,975
Really, I'm only meant to be here
until 3:00.

799
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:46,043
- That's great, but we need to have a chat.
- Would you give us another five minutes?

800
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,247
- Sure.
- Is there a problem?

801
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:51,083
Christ.

802
00:55:54,028 --> 00:55:56,553
Why didn't you just pay him
the fucking money?

803
00:55:58,166 --> 00:55:59,633
It's your fault.

804
00:56:03,104 --> 00:56:04,537
Where's my tea?

805
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:11,069
- What's your problem?
- Women.

806
00:56:12,914 --> 00:56:18,375
Women, women, women.
Let me tell you something about women.

807
00:56:18,453 --> 00:56:22,412
When I was a young man, I used to go out
with the most beautiful woman

808
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:27,154
in the village. I mean, she'd walk into
the room and everyone's eyes would turn.

809
00:56:27,228 --> 00:56:29,196
Everyone wanted to fuck her.

810
00:56:29,263 --> 00:56:32,255
And of course she liked the attention,
because...

811
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:35,425
I need a shit.

812
00:56:41,008 --> 00:56:44,034
Shit, I can't believe
you gave him five!

813
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:45,511
Don't blame me for this.

814
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,571
Even if they were Valium,
you should never have given him five.

815
00:56:47,648 --> 00:56:49,240
- Don't you know anything?
- No, not about giving people...

816
00:56:56,257 --> 00:56:59,749
- Hello?
- I need the toilet.

817
00:57:01,262 --> 00:57:04,663
- Can you use the one upstairs?
- I'm in a wheelchair, you fucking idiot!

818
00:57:04,732 --> 00:57:09,260
How am I supposed to get up the stairs?
Open the door.

819
00:57:09,537 --> 00:57:11,437
Hang on a minute.

820
00:57:11,506 --> 00:57:13,337
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

821
00:57:13,407 --> 00:57:14,533
We'll stick him behind the couch.

822
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:19,571
- Come on, quickly.
- Just looking for the key.

823
00:57:19,814 --> 00:57:22,647
Quick! Shut up!

824
00:57:25,653 --> 00:57:27,917
- Hurry up!
- Got it!

825
00:57:33,261 --> 00:57:37,129
- Hello.
- What the hell is wrong with you people?

826
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:40,593
I'm about to shit in my trousers. Come on!

827
00:57:43,638 --> 00:57:46,664
- Hey.
- Oh, Justin, what do you want?

828
00:57:46,741 --> 00:57:48,368
I just wanna talk to you.

829
00:57:48,442 --> 00:57:50,410
Please don't make me
go through this again.

830
00:57:50,478 --> 00:57:53,003
What are you so afraid of, Martha?

831
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,412
I know you feel the same way.
You can't fight what we had together.

832
00:57:55,483 --> 00:57:57,542
Justin, it was one night!
It was a massive mistake.

833
00:57:57,618 --> 00:58:01,179
I was drunk out of my mind.
You could have been a donkey!

834
00:58:01,322 --> 00:58:06,259
- What's this guy got that I don't have?
- Okay. Well for one thing, he's responsible.

835
00:58:06,327 --> 00:58:10,923
He's thoughtful. He's intelligent.
He's stable. Is that enough for you?

836
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:26,407
Will you stop making out
that this is all my fault.

837
00:58:26,478 --> 00:58:27,968
I'm not the one who attacked the guy
and tied him up.

838
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,640
- Someone had to look out for Mum.
- I've been looking out for Mum

839
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,183
ever since you disappeared off
to New York

840
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:34,219
to gallivant around
with your celebrity friends.

841
00:58:34,286 --> 00:58:38,655
You really are unbelievable.
You just can't get over it, can you?

842
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:41,192
- Get over what?
- You're burning with jealousy

843
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,525
because you've just spent three years
working on a novel,

844
00:58:44,596 --> 00:58:46,826
- and you won't even let anyone see it.
- Why should I? Why should I?

845
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:47,923
What're you gonna do?

846
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,766
- Are you gonna wait until you're dead...
- Rather than just a hack writing pulp...

847
00:58:51,837 --> 00:58:55,102
...and hope it's published posthumously?
...crap, self-righteously. Least my novel...

848
00:58:55,174 --> 00:58:57,404
- You're a pompous arsehole!
- And you are the most selfish...

849
00:58:57,476 --> 00:58:58,738
Daniel?

850
00:59:00,312 --> 00:59:03,179
Daniel, what is going on?
This is your father's funeral.

851
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:07,582
- Not now, Jane. Jane, not now. Not now.
- Why are you acting like this?

852
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:14,316
It's the flat, isn't it? It's the flat.
You don't want to go, do you?

853
00:59:14,393 --> 00:59:17,260
- You don't want to leave.
- Just tell her, Daniel.

854
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:19,490
Just tell me what?

855
00:59:23,969 --> 00:59:28,030
Jane, you remember that short man
that I pointed out to you earlier?

856
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,095
- Remember the short...
- Yeah.

857
00:59:29,174 --> 00:59:31,404
Well, it turns out that
he was having an affair with Dad,

858
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:33,501
and now he's blackmailing us
into giving him £15,000,

859
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:36,343
otherwise he's gonna show everyone
pictures of them doing stuff.

860
00:59:36,915 --> 00:59:38,644
- Sex stuff.
- Yeah.

861
00:59:40,686 --> 00:59:44,122
- Is this some sort of a sick joke?
- No, of course it's not a sick joke.

862
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,351
Your dad was a gay?

863
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:53,591
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I am.

864
00:59:53,999 --> 00:59:56,297
It's touch and go. Hurry up.

865
00:59:56,368 --> 00:59:58,495
- Quick, quick, quick!
- Give me that. Here.

866
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,868
- Lift, lift. Help me, help me.
- All right. I am helping you.

867
01:00:00,939 --> 01:00:02,770
- Put your arms around me then.
- Lift me.

868
01:00:03,342 --> 01:00:06,675
Jesus Christ! Fucking hell!
You weigh a ton.

869
01:00:06,745 --> 01:00:08,940
- You got me? You got me?
- Yes, I've got you. Of course I've got you.

870
01:00:09,014 --> 01:00:10,413
- Quickly, quickly.
- All right.

871
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:13,076
- I'm trying to see where the toilet is.
- Now get the trousers down.

872
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:18,145
- Fuck. No. You do it, I'll hold you.
- How can I do it? I'm handicapped!

873
01:00:18,223 --> 01:00:20,987
- Get them down. Get them down.
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

874
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:24,654
- Quick! Quick!
- I am! Right. Okay.

875
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:30,760
Underpants. Move! Move!
Quick! Quick! It's touch and go!

876
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:34,033
- Fuck! They're all down!
- It's touch and go. Am I there?

877
01:00:34,106 --> 01:00:36,040
- I don't know. Yes!
- Am I there?

878
01:00:36,108 --> 01:00:38,542
- Am I there? Are you sure?
- Yes. Sit down! Yes!

879
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:43,206
Just sit down. Sit down.
Fuck, hang on, hang on.

880
01:00:43,282 --> 01:00:46,115
That's better.

881
01:00:55,727 --> 01:00:58,321
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Jesus, how much noise do you wanna...

882
01:00:58,397 --> 01:01:01,423
- Oh, God!
- Fucking hell! Fuck! Poo!

883
01:01:03,669 --> 01:01:05,762
Fucking hell!

884
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:12,399
Howard.

885
01:01:12,945 --> 01:01:14,378
Fuck! Fuck!

886
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:17,104
- Fucking get it off!
- Howard.

887
01:01:17,182 --> 01:01:20,583
- Something, please, get it off! Get it off!
- Howard!

888
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:25,884
- What? What?
- You've missed a bit.

889
01:01:30,862 --> 01:01:37,131
Oh, fuck! It's in my mouth!
Fucking hell! I'm gonna be sick!

890
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:42,729
You'll have a lot more to worry about
than shit in your mouth if we get caught!

891
01:01:43,008 --> 01:01:45,442
- It's in my mouth!
- It's gone. Leave the tap on!

892
01:01:47,212 --> 01:01:50,079
I'm gonna be sick! I'm gonna be sick!
Please! Please!

893
01:02:03,495 --> 01:02:06,931
Check him. Touch him or something.
Check him.

894
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:10,097
You all right, mate?

895
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:12,696
Try it again.

896
01:02:14,806 --> 01:02:18,799
- Mate? Mate?
- Wake him up.

897
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:23,043
- Mate? What's his name?
- I don't know.

898
01:02:24,516 --> 01:02:25,949
Try Philip.

899
01:02:34,593 --> 01:02:37,653
- Philip?
- Shake him.

900
01:02:42,334 --> 01:02:45,030
Philip? Wake up, mate.
You all right?

901
01:02:46,571 --> 01:02:47,560
Philip?

902
01:02:51,943 --> 01:02:57,540
Maybe it's not Philip.
Maybe it's something else. Pinch him.

903
01:02:57,616 --> 01:02:59,243
Please, just pinch him.

904
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:04,447
Mate?

905
01:03:07,793 --> 01:03:10,125
Shit, I don't think he's breathing.

906
01:03:11,797 --> 01:03:12,821
What?

907
01:03:12,898 --> 01:03:15,992
No, he must be breathing,
he must be breathing.

908
01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:29,573
Shit!

909
01:03:30,649 --> 01:03:32,810
- Is he all right?
- No.

910
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,312
He's fucking dead.

911
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,858
That's it, then, isn't it? We're just gonna
have to give him our money.

912
01:03:43,929 --> 01:03:46,329
Well, it's not gonna be
quite as simple as that.

913
01:03:46,398 --> 01:03:47,422
Well, why not?

914
01:03:47,499 --> 01:03:50,491
Daniel refused to pay,
so now we're completely fucked.

915
01:03:50,569 --> 01:03:52,662
- Just shut up. Just shut up.
- What happened?

916
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:09,619
Hi. Sorry. Thanks.

917
01:04:12,757 --> 01:04:15,123
Hi. Sorry, can I?

918
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:20,991
Can I just come through? Thank you.

919
01:04:29,975 --> 01:04:32,273
What the hell are you grinning at, Howard?

920
01:04:34,779 --> 01:04:39,307
Wonder if I could ask you two
to pop into the study for a second?

921
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:46,279
- Back soon.
- Yeah, okay.

922
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,293
It's Howard.

923
01:04:59,037 --> 01:05:02,097
Hey, Jesus, what's this? What's this?

924
01:05:03,542 --> 01:05:05,203
- Call Uncle Victor.
- There's no point.

925
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:07,768
- What do you mean there's no point?
- Look at him. He's stone dead.

926
01:05:12,551 --> 01:05:16,248
- What the hell did you do to him?
- We didn't do anything.

927
01:05:16,321 --> 01:05:19,757
- He hit his head on the corner.
- He hit his head on the corner?

928
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:23,419
He hit his head. That's what happened.
Why, what do you think happened?

929
01:05:23,495 --> 01:05:26,191
This is really, really bad.
This is really, really, really bad.

930
01:05:26,264 --> 01:05:27,492
What are we gonna do?

931
01:05:27,566 --> 01:05:29,693
- Actually, I've really got to go.
- You are not going anywhere.

932
01:05:29,768 --> 01:05:31,827
Listen, I cannot go to prison.

933
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:34,394
Do you have any idea what they do
to blokes like me in prison?

934
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,268
- I cannot go to prison.
- Howard, just calm down.

935
01:05:47,452 --> 01:05:51,752
Now, nobody here knows who this guy is,
right? They don't even know his name.

936
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:54,018
They probably didn't even notice him.

937
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:55,323
They didn't notice him?
He's four fucking feet tall!

938
01:05:56,495 --> 01:05:59,896
All right, so we just get rid of the body.
It's like he came and left.

939
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:03,692
Let's get rid of the body?
What are you talking about?

940
01:06:03,769 --> 01:06:06,738
Look at us. What do we know about
getting rid of bodies?

941
01:06:06,805 --> 01:06:09,797
What are you gonna do? Are you gonna
throw him out with the rubbish?

942
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:14,270
Did any of you happen to notice
the size of Uncle Eddie's coffin?

943
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:20,451
Are you suggesting that we bury him
with my father?

944
01:06:21,253 --> 01:06:24,154
Why not? I mean,
it's not like he's gonna know, is he?

945
01:06:25,424 --> 01:06:27,221
That's not the point.

946
01:06:30,128 --> 01:06:33,564
You have to admit it makes sense, Daniel.
Coffin's there.

947
01:06:33,632 --> 01:06:37,033
Hole in the ground's there.
He'll be gone. Finished. End of story.

948
01:06:37,102 --> 01:06:40,367
Unless you've got a better suggestion.

949
01:06:50,983 --> 01:06:52,245
No, I mean, come on, look.

950
01:06:52,317 --> 01:06:55,616
I mean, you gotta do whatever it is
in life that fires you up the most.

951
01:06:55,687 --> 01:06:59,680
Yes, but maybe I don't consider life
anymore as being about me, me, me.

952
01:06:59,758 --> 01:07:03,319
Maybe I've discovered there's something
outside of myself that I care about,

953
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:05,556
and maybe you should too, Justin.

954
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:09,396
Hey, well, that's a bit harsh,
'cause, look, I mean, I care about you.

955
01:07:09,468 --> 01:07:11,459
No, Justin, you care about you.

956
01:07:11,536 --> 01:07:14,471
You care about me in relation to
how I affect you. There's a difference.

957
01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:15,733
Uh-uh.

958
01:07:15,807 --> 01:07:19,140
No, that's not true, Martha.

959
01:07:19,511 --> 01:07:22,969
Justin, I don't know
what else I need to tell you.

960
01:07:23,882 --> 01:07:25,941
- I love you, Martha.
- No, Justin, you don't.

961
01:07:31,156 --> 01:07:33,090
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Simon!

962
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:35,419
Simon!

963
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:38,721
Simon! Simon,
what the hell are you doing?

964
01:07:38,797 --> 01:07:40,924
Get back in here
and put your clothes on this instant!

965
01:07:40,999 --> 01:07:44,400
- I saw you kissing him.
- I wasn't kissing him, I promise you.

966
01:07:44,469 --> 01:07:46,903
What are you doing?
We're at a bloody funeral!

967
01:07:46,972 --> 01:07:49,338
- I'll jump.
- Simon, don't be silly.

968
01:07:49,408 --> 01:07:52,275
- I'm gonna jump right now, I swear to you!
- Don't be silly, Simon.

969
01:07:52,344 --> 01:07:55,711
Don't be silly.
Remember, you've got drugs in you.

970
01:07:55,781 --> 01:08:00,844
Just calm down. Simon, look at me.
Justin, will you get the fuck out of here?

971
01:08:01,053 --> 01:08:04,580
- Simon, please...
- No, I'm going to do it. I'm going...

972
01:08:05,557 --> 01:08:06,581
- Simon, look at me.
- I swear I am!

973
01:08:06,658 --> 01:08:09,718
Simon. Please, just calm down.
Simon, please.

974
01:08:09,795 --> 01:08:11,558
I'm gonna jump. I'm gonna jump.

975
01:08:12,064 --> 01:08:16,023
I'm going to jump. I'm going to jump.
I'm going to jump!

976
01:08:17,069 --> 01:08:19,833
- This is impossible. We cannot do it.
- Just shut up.

977
01:08:19,905 --> 01:08:21,065
Howard? Is that you?

978
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:24,002
- Shit!
- Howard, are you in there?

979
01:08:24,076 --> 01:08:25,065
Yeah.

980
01:08:25,944 --> 01:08:30,506
Quick, get him in the bathroom.
You've gotta move the table.

981
01:08:31,249 --> 01:08:32,443
Howard?

982
01:08:38,423 --> 01:08:40,118
- Oh, shit!
- What's that?

983
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,994
Howard, what the fuck
is Uncle Alfie doing on the toilet?

984
01:08:44,062 --> 01:08:46,223
- I forgot.
- How could you forget?

985
01:08:46,298 --> 01:08:49,563
- What is wrong with you?
- Open the bloody door.

986
01:08:50,902 --> 01:08:52,267
- What is it?
- Hey, Daniel.

987
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:53,736
- Where's Howard?
- I'm here.

988
01:08:53,805 --> 01:08:57,400
Howard, come see this.
Simon's totally fucking lost it.

989
01:09:00,378 --> 01:09:02,039
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

990
01:09:02,114 --> 01:09:05,379
Listen, Simon's on the roof.
He's totally fucking starkers,

991
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:07,941
- and he's threatening to jump.
- Oh, Christ!

992
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:10,249
- Where are you going?
- I have to go out there.

993
01:09:10,322 --> 01:09:13,553
- If he jumps, I'm fucked!
- Wait here.

994
01:09:15,293 --> 01:09:16,760
Come on, hurry up.

995
01:09:23,301 --> 01:09:25,235
Simon,
you are not going to jump.

996
01:09:25,303 --> 01:09:28,033
No, I'm not listening to you.

997
01:09:28,106 --> 01:09:30,574
Simon, get back in here.

998
01:09:31,543 --> 01:09:34,034
Simon, come inside,
we'll have a cup of tea.

999
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:38,642
- No!
- Simon! Simon!

1000
01:09:40,585 --> 01:09:43,247
Simon? Simon?

1001
01:09:45,657 --> 01:09:46,919
Simon?

1002
01:09:53,465 --> 01:09:54,591
Simon!

1003
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:56,930
Martha! What the hell are you doing?

1004
01:09:57,702 --> 01:09:58,691
Simon!

1005
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,664
Stay there.

1006
01:10:04,476 --> 01:10:05,500
Martha!

1007
01:10:06,645 --> 01:10:07,669
Get down from there!

1008
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:12,383
- What's happening?
- I think I can get rid of this guy,

1009
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:15,112
but I need you to stay outside
and make sure nobody comes in.

1010
01:10:15,187 --> 01:10:16,176
Okay.

1011
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,244
Martha!

1012
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:25,555
- Who is it?
- It's Daniel. Let me in.

1013
01:10:25,797 --> 01:10:27,822
Everyone's in the garden.
Quick, we have to move the body now!

1014
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:28,922
Brilliant.

1015
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:36,467
Okay. Quick. Quick.

1016
01:10:36,541 --> 01:10:38,532
Howard, Howard, stay here.
Make sure no one comes in.

1017
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:40,737
Okay, okay.

1018
01:10:43,048 --> 01:10:45,642
Hello, Reverend. Hi. Hi.

1019
01:10:46,651 --> 01:10:48,676
How is God today?

1020
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,391
- God, he's a funny one, isn't he?
- Excuse me.

1021
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:59,054
Yeah, okay. I'm sorry.

1022
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:03,161
Daniel, we have to do this right.

1023
01:11:08,106 --> 01:11:11,098
I just wanted to ask you about religion
and how I could become a priest

1024
01:11:11,176 --> 01:11:13,144
if I wanted to, because I've seen you today
and you're amazing.

1025
01:11:13,211 --> 01:11:14,838
I'm delighted to hear that.

1026
01:11:15,847 --> 01:11:18,475
Oh, God, we can't leave him like that.

1027
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:25,921
You know, in a strange way, maybe
this is what Dad would have wanted.

1028
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:28,084
For God's sake, Robert,
can you not take anything seriously?

1029
01:11:28,627 --> 01:11:32,256
On Sundays, is it true

1030
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:36,198
that wine is sweeter?

1031
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:40,703
- Or not?
- Listen, we'll deal with this later on.

1032
01:11:40,772 --> 01:11:43,240
- I need to get to the phone.
- Yeah, but...

1033
01:11:45,744 --> 01:11:47,302
Why do you say
I can't take anything seriously?

1034
01:11:47,379 --> 01:11:50,041
I'll tell you why. Because you disappear
halfway around the world

1035
01:11:50,115 --> 01:11:51,946
without hardly ever coming back
to see your parents.

1036
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:54,577
Because you spend your last remaining
money on a first-class plane ticket

1037
01:11:54,653 --> 01:11:56,621
when you know you were
supposed to give me half for the funeral.

1038
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:58,679
And because you live your life
like you're on a fairground ride,

1039
01:11:58,757 --> 01:12:00,315
and because you have never, ever, ever

1040
01:12:00,392 --> 01:12:02,724
given a shit about anybody
except yourself.

1041
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:06,326
No one's doing anything about this
disturbed young man on the roof.

1042
01:12:06,398 --> 01:12:10,164
I have a confession to make.
I have these thoughts about

1043
01:12:10,235 --> 01:12:14,171
- pushing a pen up my bum!
- I beg your pardon?

1044
01:12:15,173 --> 01:12:20,475
Simon, this is really dangerous.
Please.

1045
01:12:21,079 --> 01:12:25,106
- I saw you.
- Stay there.

1046
01:12:40,832 --> 01:12:45,633
You know, I'll never be good enough.

1047
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:51,437
Not for your dad, not for you. I'll never be
rich enough. I'll never be cool enough.

1048
01:12:51,509 --> 01:12:54,273
Simon, stop talking this nonsense
and just come inside.

1049
01:12:54,346 --> 01:12:56,439
No, you go back inside!

1050
01:12:56,514 --> 01:12:58,505
- Come with me.
- No. Why?

1051
01:13:02,854 --> 01:13:05,288
Because we're gonna have a baby.

1052
01:13:09,194 --> 01:13:10,456
What?

1053
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:14,759
We're gonna have a child together.

1054
01:13:19,537 --> 01:13:20,731
You're pregnant?

1055
01:13:20,805 --> 01:13:23,740
And I won't be able to do it without you.

1056
01:13:50,702 --> 01:13:53,102
- What's that? Excuse me.
- I don't know. Go look.

1057
01:13:59,444 --> 01:14:00,911
Bye, Dad.

1058
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:15,282
We're gonna have a baby!

1059
01:14:17,295 --> 01:14:19,525
Jesus Christ!

1060
01:14:25,437 --> 01:14:27,632
Hey, everyone, Simon's off the roof!

1061
01:14:29,207 --> 01:14:30,799
I'm going to kill him.

1062
01:14:44,088 --> 01:14:47,285
- Hey, has he gone?
- Yeah.

1063
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,690
Thank God.

1064
01:14:51,763 --> 01:14:53,492
Careful, careful.

1065
01:14:56,601 --> 01:14:59,161
- Thank you.
- Martha.

1066
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:01,602
Martha, will you open this door?

1067
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:09,973
Thank God you're safe. You idiot!
What were you thinking?

1068
01:15:10,048 --> 01:15:12,346
I want you to stay away
from my daughter.

1069
01:15:12,417 --> 01:15:14,214
- Look, Dad...
- Martha, stay out of this.

1070
01:15:14,285 --> 01:15:16,913
- Dad, we're getting married.
- You're what?

1071
01:15:16,988 --> 01:15:19,752
We're getting married.

1072
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:25,318
Martha, you don't have to marry this man
just because you're pregnant.

1073
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:29,196
- We can deal with this, Martha.
- I'm marrying him because I love him.

1074
01:15:29,701 --> 01:15:31,430
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.

1075
01:15:31,503 --> 01:15:33,164
This is my life, and this is my choice,

1076
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:36,730
and I'm sorry if you don't like it,
but that's just tough.

1077
01:15:38,343 --> 01:15:42,541
And I will tell you something else.
If you don't sort out your attitude,

1078
01:15:42,614 --> 01:15:46,380
you're gonna end up
a very lonely, bitter old man.

1079
01:15:47,552 --> 01:15:49,520
- Simon.
- All right.

1080
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:54,350
Dad!

1081
01:15:57,262 --> 01:16:00,527
Oh, darling,
we really must start again now.

1082
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:03,624
- Daniel, have you seen Uncle Alfie?
- Shit!

1083
01:16:17,682 --> 01:16:20,173
- What the hell is going on in there?
- I'm so sorry.

1084
01:16:20,251 --> 01:16:22,981
Never mind that. What about that
dead body you were dragging over here?

1085
01:16:23,054 --> 01:16:24,919
- What dead body?
- Oh, don't fuck with me!

1086
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:27,389
- I saw a dead body!
- Uncle Alfie must have dropped off.

1087
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:31,861
Get me the hell off of this fucking toilet!

1088
01:16:32,397 --> 01:16:33,694
Here they come.

1089
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:45,202
Did you hear that? She's having a kid.

1090
01:16:45,276 --> 01:16:47,301
I never would've done anything
if I'd known she was having a kid.

1091
01:16:47,378 --> 01:16:48,436
I thought you were in love with her.

1092
01:16:48,513 --> 01:16:51,277
Yeah, but can you imagine me
bringing up a kid?

1093
01:16:51,349 --> 01:16:53,010
- No.
- Exactly.

1094
01:16:53,084 --> 01:16:55,518
- How's your skin thing?
- Oh, that. Probably nothing.

1095
01:16:55,587 --> 01:16:59,523
To be honest, I'm more concerned about
having had Uncle Alfie's shit in my mouth.

1096
01:17:10,935 --> 01:17:13,529
The door opened, I saw him.
He was dead.

1097
01:17:13,605 --> 01:17:17,803
Why won't you listen?
I tell you, I saw the guy. He was dead.

1098
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:20,343
I know you did, Uncle Alfie.
We all did.

1099
01:17:20,411 --> 01:17:22,606
No, no, no, in the bathroom.

1100
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,772
The door opened. I saw...

1101
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:26,476
I can't believe what a nightmare
today has been.

1102
01:17:26,551 --> 01:17:28,746
- It's been sort of exciting, hasn't it?
- What?

1103
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:31,482
- For a funeral, I mean, it's been...
- Listen, about the flat,

1104
01:17:31,556 --> 01:17:35,515
- I promise that I will make the call. I will.
- We'll work it out.

1105
01:17:37,362 --> 01:17:39,091
Right, we're really going to have to
whiz through this now.

1106
01:17:39,163 --> 01:17:40,289
Sure, let's go.

1107
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:42,356
- Do you want to have the casket open...
- No. No.

1108
01:17:42,433 --> 01:17:43,491
Fine. That's fine.

1109
01:17:43,568 --> 01:17:46,662
Right. Sit down, everybody.
As quick as you can. We're ready to go.

1110
01:17:47,138 --> 01:17:50,869
Come along. Come on, come on.
Come on. Right.

1111
01:17:52,176 --> 01:17:56,169
Quickly! Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1112
01:17:57,181 --> 01:18:00,014
Come on, come on, come on!

1113
01:18:01,653 --> 01:18:04,554
Well, I'd like to apologize on behalf
of the family for all of the distractions.

1114
01:18:04,622 --> 01:18:07,090
I hope that everyone is settled
and ready to continue with the service,

1115
01:18:07,158 --> 01:18:08,853
and Daniel would like to say
a few words about his father.

1116
01:18:08,926 --> 01:18:11,156
Off you go, Daniel. Quickly.

1117
01:18:27,845 --> 01:18:31,747
"My father was an exceptional man."

1118
01:18:52,136 --> 01:18:55,628
"My father was an exceptional man.

1119
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:09,342
"He was born in 1938, just a year before
the war, and I'll never forget the..."

1120
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:15,959
- What the hell is going on?
- There's someone in there!

1121
01:19:16,027 --> 01:19:17,756
I knew it!

1122
01:19:26,938 --> 01:19:30,032
What the hell are you doing
in my dad's coffin?

1123
01:19:32,543 --> 01:19:35,637
- Edward!
- No! No!

1124
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,347
No!

1125
01:19:37,415 --> 01:19:40,077
Edward! Edward!

1126
01:19:45,289 --> 01:19:47,154
No!

1127
01:20:00,204 --> 01:20:03,640
You little bastard!
He's been shagging you, you bastard.

1128
01:20:06,577 --> 01:20:08,010
Oh, dear God!

1129
01:20:08,346 --> 01:20:11,042
My father was an exceptional man!

1130
01:20:35,473 --> 01:20:40,172
He may not have been a perfect man,
but he was a good man.

1131
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:43,578
And he loved us.

1132
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:51,254
All I wanted to do today was to give him
a dignified send-off.

1133
01:20:51,322 --> 01:20:53,347
Is that really so much to ask?

1134
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:00,886
So...

1135
01:21:03,768 --> 01:21:05,030
Maybe...

1136
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:13,103
Maybe he had some things he liked to do.
Life isn't simple. It's complicated.

1137
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:22,482
We're all just thrown in here together
in a world full of chaos and confusion,

1138
01:21:23,788 --> 01:21:28,657
a world full of questions and no answers.
Death always lingering around the corner.

1139
01:21:28,726 --> 01:21:30,318
And we do our best.

1140
01:21:32,964 --> 01:21:37,094
We can only do our best,
and my dad did his best.

1141
01:21:50,014 --> 01:21:52,482
He always tried to tell me that
you have to go for what you want in life,

1142
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:54,142
because you never know
how long you're gonna be here.

1143
01:21:54,218 --> 01:21:58,985
And whether you succeed or you fail,

1144
01:21:59,056 --> 01:22:01,854
the most important thing is to have tried.

1145
01:22:04,328 --> 01:22:06,296
A parent can only guide you
in the right direction.

1146
01:22:06,364 --> 01:22:09,197
In the end, you have to learn for yourself.

1147
01:22:14,438 --> 01:22:16,633
You have to grow up yourself.

1148
01:22:22,546 --> 01:22:24,639
So when you all leave here today,

1149
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:29,917
I would like you to remember my father
for who he really was,

1150
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:34,682
a decent, loving man.

1151
01:22:39,363 --> 01:22:43,493
If only we could be as giving
and as generous and as

1152
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:49,802
understanding as my father was,
then the world would be a far better place.

1153
01:23:29,647 --> 01:23:32,616
Hey. How's Mum doing?

1154
01:23:34,618 --> 01:23:36,381
She'll survive.

1155
01:23:39,824 --> 01:23:42,987
On the positive side,
now she knows why it's been so long

1156
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,789
since she and Dad had sex.

1157
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,692
I asked her to come to New York with me
for a while.

1158
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:56,606
Give you and Jane a chance
to breathe a bit, you know.

1159
01:23:57,241 --> 01:24:01,143
- Get your flat.
- Wow.

1160
01:24:01,746 --> 01:24:02,735
Wow.

1161
01:24:04,648 --> 01:24:09,881
That was a pretty good speech you gave,
by the way. It was really...

1162
01:24:14,859 --> 01:24:18,590
- impressive.
- Thanks.

1163
01:24:23,701 --> 01:24:28,536
Maybe when you've got time, you
wouldn't mind taking a look at my novel.

1164
01:24:29,073 --> 01:24:32,065
I'd love to, yeah.

1165
01:24:35,513 --> 01:24:37,413
- Hey.
- Hey.

1166
01:24:39,383 --> 01:24:41,544
I'm exhausted, actually.

1167
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:45,111
Uncle Alfie keeps going on
about the body in the bathroom.

1168
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:47,419
- I think it's best if he stays here tonight.
- Yeah.

1169
01:24:47,491 --> 01:24:50,619
- Do you think he'll be okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, he'll be fine.

1170
01:24:50,694 --> 01:24:53,492
I found him a couple of Valium,
put him to bed.

1171
01:24:57,034 --> 01:24:59,867
Everything's so fucking green!

1172
01:25:21,258 --> 01:25:22,919
And keep rolling.

1173
01:25:23,761 --> 01:25:25,490
What was that?

1174
01:25:32,736 --> 01:25:34,397
Cut, print, check it.

1175
01:25:41,112 --> 01:25:45,845
- That is so low. That's so low.
- What? Come on! You said cut!

1176
01:25:46,484 --> 01:25:49,942
Daniel, have... Oh, you bastard!

1177
01:25:50,888 --> 01:25:52,355
- Jane Asher!
- Sorry.

1178
01:25:55,025 --> 01:25:57,892
Do that... Do that again, sorry.
Do that again, sorry.

1179
01:26:01,398 --> 01:26:04,367
Cut. Check it.
Very nice, though, guys.

1180
01:26:08,606 --> 01:26:10,574
Print. Check it.

1181
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:16,373
Cut! Cut. Print it.

1182
01:26:18,549 --> 01:26:20,608
That was very good.

1183
01:26:22,553 --> 01:26:24,783
Anything else
you wanna do, Peter?

1184
01:26:25,256 --> 01:26:26,450
That's a cut.

1185
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:28,683
Check it.
