1
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:31,407
Can you believe that? A musical version
of "Sweet Bird of Youth."

2
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:34,679
- Who are they kidding?
- Thank God, you wanted to leave.

3
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:38,483
Can you believe Madeline Ashton?
Talk about waking the dead.

4
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,081
l gotta get a drink.

Wow!

00:04:56,954 --> 00:04:59,684
Oh, boy!

38
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,225
Whoo!

39
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:04,556
Whoo!

40
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:10,130
Wrinkled, wrinkled little star,

41
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,931
hope they never
see the scars.

42
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,304
Your guests are here,
Miss Ashton.

43
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:25,075
A Miss Helen Sharp
with a gentleman.

44
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:28,448
- Ahh. How´s she look?
- Who?

45
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,919
Helen, you idiot.

46
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:33,684
l don´t know.
Smart, l guess, sort of classy.

47
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:36,555
Classy? Really?
Compared to whom?

48
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,859
Oh, shit.

49
00:05:57,848 --> 00:05:59,475
Mad!

50
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,110
Hel!

51
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:07,623
- l don´t believe it.
- How are you?

52
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:09,750
- lt´s been so long.
- l know.

53
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,762
Don´t you dare say how long.

54
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,958
Mad, l´d like you to meet...

55
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:18,001
Dr. Ernest Menville, my fiance.

56
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:20,798
You were just wonderful.

57
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:23,669
Ernest Menville? Dr. Ernest Menville,
the plastic surgeon?

58
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:28,007
- Yes. You were so terrific!
- Ernest is quite a fan.

59
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:30,842
- l´ve read all about you.
- That dance number. Boy, oh, boy.

60
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:34,406
- l can´t believe l´m meeting you.
- He never mentioned a Madeline thing.

61
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:39,513
- We´re both huge fans.
- l´m sure he doesn´t have a... thing.

62
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,650
Do you?

63
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:48,255
Well, l´m so happy
for you... both.

64
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:52,325
What ever happened to that,
um, writing thing?

65
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:56,463
- Oh, well, um, l´m still trying.
- Helen, don´t be modest.

66
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,000
- She´s a brilliant writer, Mrs. Ashton.
- Miss.

67
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:03,444
Tell me, Doctor,

68
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:06,972
do you think that
l´m starting to need you?

69
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:09,617
Ahem.

70
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:12,177
So...

71
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:15,725
have you two set a date?

72
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:18,159
- Yes... we have.
- No, actually--

73
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:23,598
We see
the upper eyelid skin incision...

74
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:27,103
from the medial canthus
to the lateral orbital margin.

75
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:30,265
There are two fat compartments
in the upper eyelid, three in the lower.

76
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,002
Oops. Look at all this bleeding.

77
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:37,376
Needle-tip cautery. Quickly, please.

78
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:46,287
For heaven´s sake,
Helen, it was a dinner.

79
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:49,052
The woman wanted
my professional opinion.

80
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:52,357
Ernest, you don´t know Madeline
the way l do.

81
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:56,126
She wants you.
She wants you because you´re mine.

82
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,634
l´ve lost men to her before.

83
00:07:58,702 --> 00:08:02,729
She just turns on that flash
and that glitter and they´re gone.

84
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:05,866
That´s why l wanted you to meet her
before we got married.

85
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:10,744
l just had to see if you could pass
the Madeline Ashton test.

86
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:14,409
Please...
Please, don´t fail.

87
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:18,477
l couldn´t
take it again.

88
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:21,149
l don´t know
what l´d do.

89
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:25,457
Do you know how
silly you´re sounding?

90
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:28,822
Oh, darling,

91
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:33,461
l have absolutely no interest
in Madeline Ashton.

92
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:56,218
Mrs. Helen Sharp? lt´s your landlord.
Open the door, please.

93
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:59,230
l know you´re in there!

94
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,131
l have your final
eviction notice.

95
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,260
lf you don´t come out,

96
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:08,636
- l´m going to break the door.
- What are you doing here?

97
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:12,074
l have the police. lf you don´t open,
we´re going to break the door.

98
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:17,047
- Well, speak!
- l´m going to charge you for it too.

99
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:21,883
- Lady, let´s go.
- You heard what he said.

100
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:30,685
You´re in trouble.

101
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:35,028
Come on. Open it!

102
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,312
Lady, listen.
You have the right to remain silent.

103
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:55,819
lf you give up the right
to remain silent--

104
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,982
Are you nuts?

105
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:01,389
Come on.
Get her outta here!

106
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,621
So...

107
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:08,791
What about you, Helen?

108
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:12,735
We haven´t heard from you
in a while.

109
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:15,967
ls there anything...

110
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,977
you´d like to...
talk about... with the group?

111
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,720
Yes.

112
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,925
l would like
to talk about...

113
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:40,260
Madeline...

114
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,697
Ashton.

115
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,997
Stop! Stop it!
Stop!

116
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:46,867
No! No!

117
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,977
ls this where we are, Helen?

118
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,414
Six months of therapy.
You´re not one pound lighter.

119
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:01,384
And we are still talking
about Madeline Ashton!

120
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:05,219
- You think l enjoy talking about her?
- Do you think l enjoy it?

121
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,282
ls that what you think?
You better think again!

122
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,024
Oh, Helen,
for you to have a life,

123
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:16,499
for any of us
to have a life,

124
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,661
you have got to forget
about her.

125
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,137
You have to erase her
from your mind.

126
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:24,903
- You have to completely eliminate any--
- What?

127
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:28,003
You have to completely
eliminate--

128
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,571
You´re right.

129
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,014
What?

130
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,884
You´re absolutely right.

131
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,073
Yes?

132
00:12:56,141 --> 00:13:00,043
l have a delivery for Madeline Ashton
and Dr. Ernest Menville.

133
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,546
Good morning, madam.

134
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:41,518
You look
absolutely marvelous.

135
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:43,986
Hey, wait a minute.

136
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,591
Aren´t you forgetting something?

137
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:50,753
- lt´s only Thursday. l´m supposed to--
- Never mind.

138
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,889
l think l need you
to say it every morning.

139
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:56,126
Very well.

140
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,761
Oh, madam,
you look younger every day.

141
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:02,534
Thank you, Rose.
Thank you very much.

142
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:04,734
lt´s so sweet--
What is this?

143
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:09,144
Your tickets for
Helen Sharp´s book party.

144
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:12,012
They just came.

145
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:15,383
Helen Sharp´s book party!

146
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,423
- "Forever Young"?
- l like that title.

147
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:24,856
Oh, forever young!
Right.

148
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,956
And eternally fat!

149
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:32,697
Oh, clever little witch.
She sent seating assignments.

150
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:36,540
l find it very hard
to believe...

151
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:40,476
that he got up early
and made his side of the bed.

152
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:44,879
- No, madam.
- So where did he sleep?

153
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,043
Again?

154
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:53,380
The beaver has always
been of interest to man.

155
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,758
lt is the second largest
rodent in the world.

156
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,134
Dr. Menville?

157
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:12,540
Dr. Menville?

158
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,844
ls this an angel
l see before me?

159
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:22,512
- Dr. Menville, you´re so cute.
- Thank you, Rose.

160
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:31,351
Oh!

161
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,991
More vodka.

162
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:37,466
An outstanding characteristic
of a beaver...

163
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:42,564
is the large, flat tail.

164
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:51,673
- ls it up yet?
- Yes, sir.

165
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,548
lt´s in the bath.

166
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:59,215
Your beeper was beeping.
lt´s Mr. Franklin again.

167
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,629
Rose!
Oh, it´s you.

168
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:15,400
Fine, dear, thank you.
Like a rock.

169
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,601
You´re dressed.
Special occasion?

170
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,610
- Work.
- Ghoul!

171
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,670
Dr. Menville,
thank God.

172
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:26,410
- l´m sorry to call at the last minute.
- Yes.

173
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,945
He´s completely prepped. Our top staff
have been summoned and are waiting.

174
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:33,456
Good, l´m sure he´ll be fine.
Just calm down.

175
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,858
Calm? l am calm.
Everyone is calm here.

176
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:39,453
- Who is it?
- Fernando Rivas, the actor.

177
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:43,763
He drowned in his hot tub.
Very bloated, very swollen.

178
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:46,963
He was making love
to his new fiancee.

179
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:50,166
Eighteen years old,
from Cuba.

180
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,006
He´s got this expression of happiness
that is completely inappropriate.

181
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:57,310
Thank you, Mr. Franklin, we´ll see
if we can´t give him a little character,

182
00:16:57,382 --> 00:17:00,044
- a little depth.
- Depth?

183
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:04,646
Oh, no, Dr. Menville, you can´t
give him any character or depth.

184
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,783
People have
to recognize him.

185
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,727
- Good afternoon, Miss Ashton.
- 3:00 with Anna.

186
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:13,855
Yes, l know.
You may go down.

187
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:24,107
Miss Ashton, how are you?
So good to see you!

188
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:28,236
Listen, l´ve got a really
important party tonight.

189
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,578
Really important.
You understand?

190
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,245
You will be the best one!

191
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,948
l have to be
better than that.

192
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,150
l am sorry,
but the plasma separation...

193
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,853
is a very traumatic
process to the body!

194
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,419
Our policy
clearly prohibits...

195
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,466
more than one
in a six-month period.

196
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:51,058
So? lt´s been nearly
that long already.

197
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:55,596
Miss Ashton, you had one
three weeks ago.

198
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:59,235
- How about a nice collagen buff?
- "A collagen buff"?

199
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,542
You might as well ask me
to wash with soap and water!

200
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,417
Tonight is
very important to me.

201
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:11,353
- l could do your makeup myself.
- Makeup is pointless!

202
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,119
lt does nothing anymore.

203
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,456
Are you listening to me?
Do you even care?

204
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,827
You stand there with your 22-year-old
skin and your tits like rocks...

205
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,765
and laugh at me.

206
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:31,637
Mmm.

207
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:36,044
l could pay you extra.

208
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:39,811
Something...
on a personal basis.

209
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:42,717
You know what l mean?
How about that?

210
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:45,756
Money is no object.
lt means nothing to me.

211
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,258
Ahem.

212
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:52,057
l´m sorry, Mr. Chagall.
l´m really, really sorry.

213
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,963
Anna, don´t talk,
just go away.

214
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,467
Leave us alone, mmm?

215
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:00,663
- l don´t want to look at you anymore.
- Oh, okay.

216
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,866
Thank you so much.

217
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,404
Please.

218
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,981
- l suppose l should apologize.
- Oh, no, no.

219
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,714
l am very sensitive
to your torment.

220
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,087
- Excuse me?
- But unfortunately we are mere mortals.

221
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:25,528
We are restricted by the...
laws of nature.

222
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,623
Well, what more
could one expect?

223
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,601
Mmm, mmm,
that depends.

224
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:37,108
l could not help but overhear your
little joke about money being no object.

225
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:40,076
- That was no joke!
- l see.

226
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,813
l wonder, Miss Ashton,

227
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:48,979
if perhaps you have
ever heard of...

228
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,124
Lisle Von Rhuman?

229
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,751
Ah... no.

230
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,762
No, of course you haven´t.
Very few have.

231
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,957
Only a select group.

232
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:03,933
She may be able to help you.

233
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,831
Here is her address.

234
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:11,307
She accepts callers day...
and night.

235
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,809
Eh...

236
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:17,177
lt is a very, very select group,
you understand?

237
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,682
Sure.

238
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:25,955
l´m glad this happened,
Miss Ashton.

239
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:30,358
We shall be seeing
more of you, l think.

240
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:32,521
Yes, l think so.

241
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,791
Weirdo.

242
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:50,891
Could you just
not breathe?

243
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:03,974
Jesus, what´d she do?
Hire extras?

244
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:06,016
Good evening.

245
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:11,654
Evian, please.
No ice.

246
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,290
- Dr. Menville?
- Yes.

247
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,226
- Ernest Menville?
- Yes.

248
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:22,561
- Hi, l´m Vivian Adams.
- Hi, h-h-have we met?

249
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:25,067
Long ago. l never had
a chance to thank you...

250
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:30,335
for the spectacular job
you did with my Aunt Esther.

251
00:21:30,407 --> 00:21:32,841
Oh, well,
thank you very much.

252
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,640
Her color, her tone.

253
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:39,740
- You even brought out her cheekbones.
- Well, that´s my job.

254
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:42,513
lt was almost a shame
to bury her.

255
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:44,850
lt´s so sweet of you
to say that.

256
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:47,823
Can l ask you
what your secret is?

257
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:50,019
Spray paint.

258
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:55,991
You see, you can´t just use
regular makeup on dead skin.

259
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,000
The pores are too dry.

260
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:01,060
You´ve gotta use a palette
and grind the stuff in.

261
00:22:01,138 --> 00:22:04,574
One day l´m in the hardware store and
l think, "What about mannequin paint?"

262
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:09,477
lt´s got its own chemical adhesive,
comes in a variety of flesh--

263
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:13,477
Excuse me!

264
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,595
Have you seen her yet?

265
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:35,833
What a joke. She´s not even here.

266
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:41,705
- Oh, look over there.
- Wh--

267
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:46,409
Oh, looks as though
she´s lost a few pounds!

268
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:55,353
- We´re leaving.
- Nonsense. Let´s go talk to her.

269
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:59,590
No. l´ll talk to her.

270
00:23:01,065 --> 00:23:05,661
l just want you to know
that l am at your disposal.

271
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:09,069
You can call me day or night.

272
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:11,801
l did give you all my numbers?

273
00:23:25,222 --> 00:23:26,553
Mad?

274
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:29,457
Hel!

275
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,091
l don´t believe it!

276
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:44,471
Helen, darling, 12 years!
12 long years!

277
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,908
And look at you,
you have a... waist.

278
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:51,141
Oh, you haven´t changed.

279
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:54,343
Gosh, l´m glad you came.
l didn´t know if you would.

280
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:56,886
l spoke to my P.R. woman
and she said,

281
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:59,889
"Madeline Ashton goes
to the opening of an envelope."

282
00:23:59,957 --> 00:24:02,721
Those people can be so cruel.

283
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:06,092
l fired her.
Well, l almost fired her.

284
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:08,461
Well, that was
sweet of you, dear.

285
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,591
- Would you mind?
- Not at all.

286
00:24:10,668 --> 00:24:15,298
- So, how´s it been?
- Heaven, it´s absolute heaven.

287
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:18,307
- Ernest is a dream.
- l´m so happy for you both.

288
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,242
l often thought to myself
"l don´t deserve this"...

289
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:24,406
because it came
at your expense.

290
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:28,042
And that thought
made me feel... terrible.

291
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:31,383
Listen, that was a long time ago.

292
00:24:31,455 --> 00:24:35,721
You didn´t steal him.
He went to you.

293
00:24:35,793 --> 00:24:38,887
lt wasn´t you.
lt was him.

294
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:41,864
l want you to know something.

295
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:47,393
l have never ever blamed you.
Never!

296
00:24:55,913 --> 00:25:00,247
- Do you believe how she looks?
- How old is she?

297
00:25:00,317 --> 00:25:02,945
- Fifty.
- Fifty?

298
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,420
You´ve gotta be kidding.

299
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:09,016
l wonder what
her secret is.

300
00:25:31,148 --> 00:25:35,778
- Life has turned out as quite a party.
- You used to hate parties.

301
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:39,050
That was when l was old.
You should see me now.

302
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:42,524
l didn´t know
you were so unhappy.

303
00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:48,854
Never could lie to you.

304
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:55,504
l know about the kind of...
work you´re doing now.

305
00:25:55,572 --> 00:25:57,733
lt´s not work.

306
00:25:57,808 --> 00:26:01,972
l would sell my soul
to be able to operate again.

307
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:06,540
- Oh, Helen, l´ve wasted my life.
- No, Ernest.

308
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:09,450
She´s wasted you.

309
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,512
She married
a brilliant surgeon...

310
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:15,387
and turned him
into an undertaker.

311
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:18,394
l want you
to know something.

312
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:22,091
l have never blamed you
for leaving me.

313
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,329
l always knew it was her.

314
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:28,269
She´s a woman.

315
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:31,967
A woman, Ernest.

316
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:34,340
From Newark, for God´s sakes.

317
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:39,747
l will never forgive her
for what she´s done to you.

318
00:26:41,452 --> 00:26:43,477
Never.

319
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:18,052
Dakota!

320
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:20,682
Oh!

321
00:27:20,757 --> 00:27:22,691
Oh!

322
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:26,926
- What´s wrong?
- Nothing.

323
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:29,056
l didn´t know
you were coming over.

324
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:31,693
- Oh, my God, you´re not alone.
- Of course l am.

325
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:34,566
- l´m completely alone.
- Dakota?

326
00:27:34,638 --> 00:27:37,801
Actually, completely
isn´t quite what l meant.

327
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:41,641
- How dare you make me feel cheap!
- Madeline, l forgot.

328
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:44,704
- She´s here to-- She´s here to fix--
- Who is she?

329
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:47,648
- l´m trying to tell you--
- Who is the little piece of meat?

330
00:27:47,718 --> 00:27:50,983
She´s a friend of, of,
the guy who was here to--

331
00:27:51,054 --> 00:27:54,990
- Jesus, at least lie quickly!
- l am trying to.

332
00:27:55,058 --> 00:28:00,724
Look, you gotta believe me.
This is perfectly innocent.

333
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:16,679
Hey, hey, hey.

334
00:28:16,747 --> 00:28:19,079
l´m sick of this shit,
you know that?

335
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:21,811
- l am doing you a favor here.
- Doing me a favor?

336
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:25,184
- l gave you--
- Yeah, you gave, l gave. Big deal!

337
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:27,951
Somebody told me we look
ridiculous together.

338
00:28:28,025 --> 00:28:30,459
How do you think
that makes me feel?

339
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,859
You never think
about my feelings.

340
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,297
Go find someone
your own age, Madeline!

341
00:29:42,332 --> 00:29:46,132
Madeline! l need to speak
to Madeline at once!

342
00:29:47,271 --> 00:29:49,501
No.

343
00:29:52,576 --> 00:29:56,842
Madeline. l need to speak
to Madeline at once!

344
00:29:56,913 --> 00:29:58,972
Yeah.

345
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,530
Geez.

346
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,589
- Good evening. l hope it´s not too--
- Not at all, Miss Ashton.

347
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:06,359
Miss Von Rhuman´s expecting you.

348
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:09,630
She is?

349
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:20,873
Wait here, please.

350
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:50,165
Follow me, please.

351
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:21,364
Excuse me.

352
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:25,939
l hoped you´d come.

353
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:30,415
Make some room for my friend,
for Christ´s sake!

354
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:35,113
But...

355
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:37,713
keep your ass handy.

356
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:51,837
May l say that
l´ve always thought yours...

357
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:56,865
to be one of the most
beautiful faces...

358
00:32:56,943 --> 00:33:00,470
ever to grace
the silver screen.

359
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:01,809
Oh.

360
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:04,076
And that husband of yours,

361
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,211
l can only say that
his reputation is unsurpassed.

362
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:10,222
Oh.

363
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:14,818
l just arrived in town.
l follow the spring.

364
00:33:14,894 --> 00:33:17,294
l haven´t seen an autumn
or winter in years.

365
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:22,793
We are creatures
of the spring, you and l.

366
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:27,465
Uh-huh. l´m not really
quite sure why l came.

367
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,873
You´re scared as hell...
of yourself,

368
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:35,674
of the body you thought
you once knew.

369
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:38,273
l beg your pardon?

370
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:42,877
l am the one
who understands.

371
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:46,756
l am the one
who knows your secret.

372
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:51,123
Who is it?

373
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:57,859
Madeline.
l need to speak to Madeline.

374
00:33:57,937 --> 00:34:00,167
She´s not here.

375
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,403
Ah, thank God!

376
00:34:07,947 --> 00:34:11,815
How did you get in?
l didn´t hear the gate.

377
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:16,683
l didn´t want you to hear.

378
00:34:16,756 --> 00:34:18,883
Ernest, ask me to go.

379
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:21,825
Ask me to leave
this house immediately!

380
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:24,693
- You just got here.
- l know, l know.

381
00:34:24,764 --> 00:34:28,393
But it just took me a glimpse
and l was back where l started.

382
00:34:28,468 --> 00:34:30,732
Where´s that?

383
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:34,136
- Don´t pretend you´re not aware of it.
- Of what?

384
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:38,610
You´re a powerful
sexual being, Ernest.

385
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:40,407
l am?

386
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,277
Yes, you are.

387
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:45,476
lf l never told you before,
it´s because...

388
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:48,988
l wasn´t the sort of girl
that could say the word...

389
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:52,616
"sexual" without blushing.

390
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:57,886
Well, l can now.

391
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,625
Sexual.

392
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:05,929
Sensual.

393
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:09,668
Sexy.

394
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,908
Sex.

395
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,949
Sex.

396
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:19,041
Sex!

397
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:27,485
So warm, so full of life.

398
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,724
And already
it ebbs away from you.

399
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,926
This is life´s
ultimate cruelty.

400
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:38,664
lt offers us the taste
of youth and vitality...

401
00:35:38,738 --> 00:35:42,765
and then makes us
witness our own decay.

402
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,442
Well, it is
the natural law.

403
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:48,980
Screw the natural law!

404
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:45,093
What is that?

405
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:49,403
What you came for.

406
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:52,467
A touch of magic...

407
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:56,845
in this world
obsessed with science.

408
00:36:58,685 --> 00:37:01,119
A tonic.

409
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:05,053
A potion.

410
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:08,761
What does it do?

411
00:37:08,828 --> 00:37:12,320
How old would you guess l am?

412
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:18,328
l wouldn´t--

413
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:21,168
Come on.
Don´t try to flatter me.

414
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,731
Thirty eight.

415
00:37:24,777 --> 00:37:26,836
Oh, twenty eight.
Twenty... three?

416
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:30,610
l am seventy-one years old.

417
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:34,016
That´s what it does.

418
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:37,545
lt stops the aging process
dead in its tracks...

419
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:39,853
and forces it into retreat.

420
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:44,693
Drink that potion and you´ll
never grow even one day older.

421
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:50,100
Don´t drink it...
and continue to watch yourself rot.

422
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:52,937
How much is it?

423
00:37:55,508 --> 00:37:59,444
The sordid topic of coin...

424
00:37:59,512 --> 00:38:02,242
l´m afraid is not so simple.

425
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:06,684
The cost, you see,
it´s different for everyone.

426
00:38:06,753 --> 00:38:10,052
Well, for me, how much?

427
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:30,435
Well, thank you very much.
l think l should be going.

428
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,740
Sit!

429
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:50,491
Hold out your hand.

430
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,462
What are you, nuts?

431
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,689
Watch.

432
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:28,925
Check okay?

433
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:30,928
Fine.

434
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:33,624
But you must make me a promise.

435
00:39:33,698 --> 00:39:36,565
The secret that we share
must never become public.

436
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:39,263
You may continue your career
for ten years,

437
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:42,568
ten years of perfect,
unchanged beauty.

438
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:47,340
But at the end of that time,
before people become suspicious,

439
00:39:47,412 --> 00:39:50,313
you have to disappear
from public view forever.

440
00:39:50,382 --> 00:39:52,577
You can retire.

441
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:55,882
You can stage
your own phony death...

442
00:39:55,954 --> 00:39:58,514
or...

443
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,117
as one of my clients
simply said,

444
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:05,095
"l vant to be alone, yah."

445
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:08,098
No! She´s not!

446
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:11,201
Wow!

447
00:40:37,496 --> 00:40:40,090
Bottoms up.

448
00:40:53,211 --> 00:40:57,307
- Now, a warning.
- Now, a warning?

449
00:40:57,382 --> 00:41:00,874
Take care of yourself.

450
00:41:00,952 --> 00:41:06,720
You and your body are going
to be together a long time.

451
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:09,487
Be good to it.

452
00:41:11,196 --> 00:41:15,098
Siempre viva.
Live forever.

453
00:41:56,107 --> 00:42:00,237
l can´t believe--
Did you--

454
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:03,110
Oh... l´m a girl!

455
00:42:03,181 --> 00:42:06,480
Shh.

456
00:42:06,551 --> 00:42:09,884
Ernest, oh, we gotta stop.

457
00:42:09,955 --> 00:42:12,446
l know we-- l know we--

458
00:42:12,524 --> 00:42:14,890
Really, Ernest. Oh.

459
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,451
Ernest, don´t be angry with me.

460
00:42:17,529 --> 00:42:20,896
l´m fighting this as hard
as l can, but just--

461
00:42:20,966 --> 00:42:22,627
Look at you!

462
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,834
She´s already destroyed
your career.

463
00:42:27,906 --> 00:42:30,500
Now she´s breaking
your heart,

464
00:42:30,575 --> 00:42:33,305
stealing your pride,

465
00:42:33,378 --> 00:42:35,744
flaunting her lovers...

466
00:42:35,814 --> 00:42:39,181
- all over town.
- You know about that?

467
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,845
Everyone does.

468
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:46,516
At the party,
people spoke of nothing else.

469
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:49,389
How can you love me, Helen?

470
00:42:49,461 --> 00:42:53,830
l´ve been so weak for so long.

471
00:42:53,898 --> 00:42:57,527
l should´ve divorced Madeline
a long time ago.

472
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:03,830
By God, that is exactly
what l am going to do!

473
00:43:03,908 --> 00:43:06,103
The first thing
tomorrow morning,

474
00:43:06,177 --> 00:43:09,613
l am gonna go downtown and obtain
a divorce from Madeline Ashton.

475
00:43:09,681 --> 00:43:13,617
- Ernest?
- Monday. At the very least Tuesday.

476
00:43:13,685 --> 00:43:17,519
Divorce?
ln California?

477
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:21,491
That´s exactly what
she wants you to do.

478
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,891
You have no talent
for poverty.

479
00:43:30,301 --> 00:43:33,065
You can´t let her
get away with that.

480
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:37,565
Then there´s nothing
l can do.

481
00:43:39,444 --> 00:43:42,072
Oh, yes, there is.

482
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,685
Listen to me, Ernest.

483
00:43:48,753 --> 00:43:53,315
l´ve thought this through carefully,
and it´s the only way.

484
00:43:53,391 --> 00:43:57,122
Tonight, while she´s asleep,
you´ll sneak downstairs quietly,

485
00:43:57,195 --> 00:44:01,859
and take one of each kind
of wine glass from the shelf.

486
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:04,367
Then you´ll take
this Narconal...

487
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:06,836
and lightly coat
each glass.

488
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:10,966
As you know, Narconal is a very
powerful alcohol-base tranquilizer,

489
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:13,010
so you won´t need much.

490
00:44:13,078 --> 00:44:15,740
Tomorrow, l´ll call Madeline
to say good-bye.

491
00:44:15,814 --> 00:44:20,751
- l´ll get her to invite me to dinner.
- Why don´t you come to dinner?

492
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:24,812
Then, at dinner,
we propose a toast.

493
00:44:24,889 --> 00:44:27,153
No matter which glass
she drinks from,

494
00:44:27,225 --> 00:44:31,389
Narconal will be
on the glass.

495
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:34,899
You and l work together.
First, we finish dinner.

496
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:38,333
Then we load her in the car,
take her to the top of Mulholland Drive,

497
00:44:38,403 --> 00:44:43,568
call the police and report we´ve seen a
drunk woman swerving close to the edge.

498
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:47,202
Some drunk woman up here on Mulholland´s
swerving dangerously close to the edge.

499
00:44:47,278 --> 00:44:50,941
We´ll sit her up
in the driver´s seat...

500
00:44:51,015 --> 00:44:52,880
and make it look like
she´s had...

501
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:56,910
just a little bit
too much to drink.

502
00:44:56,988 --> 00:44:59,218
We drop the car into gear,

503
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:03,792
wedge her foot
down on the accelerator,

504
00:45:05,363 --> 00:45:08,389
clamp her hands
on the steering wheel...

505
00:45:08,466 --> 00:45:11,367
and send her on her way.

506
00:45:22,313 --> 00:45:25,214
By the time
they perform the autopsy,

507
00:45:25,283 --> 00:45:27,945
the Narconal will be
completely dissolved,

508
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:30,783
leaving only traces
of alcohol.

509
00:45:30,855 --> 00:45:35,292
She´ll be classified
as just another drunk driver.

510
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:40,889
- They´ll check her blood alcohol...
- Point four-0. She had it coming.

511
00:45:40,965 --> 00:45:43,433
...and think
nothing more of it.

512
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:48,200
The case is closed.
Madeline is dead.

513
00:45:48,273 --> 00:45:51,834
And we´re free!

514
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,708
What are we saying?

515
00:46:01,052 --> 00:46:04,988
- We can´t go through with this, Helen.
- lt´s the only way.

516
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:07,320
After she´s gone,

517
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:10,725
you can start your life
all over again.

518
00:46:10,795 --> 00:46:14,128
l can start my life
all over again.

519
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:18,636
Oh, we´ll be so happy!

520
00:46:21,272 --> 00:46:24,400
She´s killing you.

521
00:46:26,144 --> 00:46:30,046
So... it would be
self-defense.

522
00:46:30,114 --> 00:46:33,606
Self-defense.

523
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:07,687
My God, it´s back!

524
00:48:17,242 --> 00:48:19,506
We have to talk.

525
00:48:19,578 --> 00:48:22,945
- Have another drink and go to bed.
- You´d like that.

526
00:48:23,014 --> 00:48:26,177
You´d like to see me drink
myself into an early grave.

527
00:48:26,251 --> 00:48:28,651
That is not going
to happen, by God!

528
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,986
- You are not going to take my money!
- What are you talking about?

529
00:48:33,058 --> 00:48:36,289
When was the last time
you worked, Madeline? A real job?

530
00:48:36,361 --> 00:48:40,730
Anything you had left, you owed me
a long time ago. Your face owed me.

531
00:48:40,799 --> 00:48:43,290
You´ve changed your hair?

532
00:48:45,637 --> 00:48:47,730
What an eye.

533
00:48:47,806 --> 00:48:49,740
Don´t wait up.

534
00:48:51,977 --> 00:48:54,275
Cheap.

535
00:48:57,182 --> 00:48:59,616
What did you say?

536
00:48:59,684 --> 00:49:02,152
l called you cheap.
That´s what l think of you.

537
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,688
Who do you think
you´re talking to?

538
00:49:04,756 --> 00:49:07,418
You´re a cheap,
tacky little tramp.

539
00:49:07,492 --> 00:49:09,790
Who do you think
you are?

540
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:13,262
- Nothing like the woman l married.
- You´re nothing!

541
00:49:13,331 --> 00:49:16,823
- You´re a broad!
- You´re a tragic, boozy, flaccid clown.

542
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:20,735
- Watch it, Madeline.
- That´s it. Flaccid.

543
00:49:20,805 --> 00:49:22,830
- Watch what you say.
- Flaccid.

544
00:49:22,907 --> 00:49:25,501
l don´t have to take
this any longer!

545
00:49:25,577 --> 00:49:28,478
You´ll take everything l have to give!
You always have.

546
00:49:28,546 --> 00:49:30,980
You´re not even a man anymore.
And l need a man!

547
00:49:31,049 --> 00:49:35,179
A real man, not some drunken,
broken-down flaccid undertaker...

548
00:49:35,253 --> 00:49:38,416
who is just as dead below
the waist as his clients are.

549
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:41,254
Hey, l might have more fun
with one of your clients!

550
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:44,762
At least l´d know l´d be
getting something stiff--

551
00:50:01,713 --> 00:50:04,682
Did you think that l was just going
to take it forever, Madeline?

552
00:50:04,749 --> 00:50:06,239
Did you?

553
00:50:06,317 --> 00:50:09,514
You cruel, vicious,
loathsome bitch!

554
00:50:13,992 --> 00:50:17,223
Please? Please?

555
00:50:19,898 --> 00:50:23,061
Oh, God! Oh!

556
00:50:23,134 --> 00:50:27,161
- Madeline, l´m so sorry.
- Oh, help me! Help me!

557
00:50:29,741 --> 00:50:32,039
Hurry!

558
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,271
Help me!
Hurry up, you wimp!

559
00:50:58,336 --> 00:51:00,327
Oh, boy.

560
00:51:06,578 --> 00:51:10,241
Oh, oh.

561
00:51:10,315 --> 00:51:13,182
Oh.

562
00:51:14,953 --> 00:51:17,945
Oh, boy!

563
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:47,516
Oh, boy!

564
00:51:58,329 --> 00:52:00,524
Suite 1110, please.

565
00:52:00,598 --> 00:52:03,431
Helen, it´s me, Ernest Menville!
l did it!

566
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:05,799
l didn´t think l´d be able to,
but l did it!

567
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,998
l pushed her down the stairs.
She is absolutely stone cold.

568
00:52:09,073 --> 00:52:12,531
She was saying the most
monstrous things and she´s dead.

569
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:15,204
l just had this feeling inside
of me that l couldn´t contain.

570
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,010
We´re free, Helen.
But l´m afraid l´m gonna burn in hell.

571
00:52:18,082 --> 00:52:20,949
Her neck is broken and
there´s no pulse and she´s dead.

572
00:52:21,019 --> 00:52:24,648
Exactly which part of the plan
were you unclear on?

573
00:52:24,722 --> 00:52:28,283
- We went over it three times, Ernest.
- You don´t understand.

574
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:32,193
- Ernest, we went over it three times.
- You don´t understand.

575
00:52:32,263 --> 00:52:34,527
lt just happened.
lt was an accident.

576
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:36,897
lt´s better than an accident. At least
it´s gonna look like an accident.

577
00:52:36,968 --> 00:52:39,300
- Have you called the police?
- No, l called you first.

578
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:42,771
Ernest, you...
poor, sweet thing.

579
00:52:42,841 --> 00:52:47,301
lf the police check the phone records,
don´t you think it´ll look unusual...

580
00:52:47,378 --> 00:52:51,508
- that you called me before them?
- Oh, my God.

581
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,074
- You´re right.
- Of course l´m right!

582
00:52:54,152 --> 00:52:56,086
- Should l call them right now?
- No.

583
00:52:56,154 --> 00:52:59,749
We have to decide what
you´re going to say first.

584
00:53:00,992 --> 00:53:03,517
- Well?
- l´m thinking.

585
00:53:04,696 --> 00:53:06,823
Okay, l´ve got it.
Where´s the body?

586
00:53:06,898 --> 00:53:10,664
- At the foot of the stairs.
- Good. Don´t move her.

587
00:53:10,735 --> 00:53:13,260
- Soon as we hang up, call the police.
- Okay.

588
00:53:13,338 --> 00:53:17,069
Tell them you were on the phone with me
when you heard a terrible scream.

589
00:53:17,141 --> 00:53:20,110
You turned around and saw Madeline
fall down the stairs.

590
00:53:20,178 --> 00:53:22,271
- Right. Perfect.
- Stick to that story.

591
00:53:22,347 --> 00:53:25,510
lf they check the phone records,
it´ll confirm what you told them.

592
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:28,347
- Got it.
- What about the time of death?

593
00:53:28,419 --> 00:53:32,048
- Could they prove the call came after?
- No, no.

594
00:53:32,123 --> 00:53:35,217
lt´s very difficult to determine
time of death within a few hours.

595
00:53:35,293 --> 00:53:39,059
- lt´s not an exact science.
- Ernest? Ernest!

596
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:43,726
Ernest, you pushed me
down the stairs!

597
00:53:49,107 --> 00:53:51,541
Stay away from me!

598
00:53:51,609 --> 00:53:54,237
You bet l will!
Animal! Psycho!

599
00:53:54,312 --> 00:53:57,304
- Don´t come near me.
- Wife pusher!

600
00:53:57,382 --> 00:54:02,046
Don´t come near me,
follow me or talk to me.

601
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,985
l don´t intend to.

602
00:54:04,055 --> 00:54:06,956
l just have to make
a telephone call.

603
00:54:10,428 --> 00:54:14,296
l just have to make
a telephone call.

604
00:54:14,365 --> 00:54:16,526
9-1-1, right?

605
00:54:19,771 --> 00:54:23,605
You´re in the shit house now, pal!

606
00:54:24,642 --> 00:54:26,803
Madeline, look at yourself!

607
00:54:26,878 --> 00:54:29,745
- Huh?
- Look at yourself!

608
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:35,916
Ernest!

609
00:54:35,987 --> 00:54:38,956
My ass!

610
00:54:39,023 --> 00:54:42,481
l can see...
my ass!

611
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:47,520
- Something´s wrong with your neck too.
- l would say so.

612
00:54:47,598 --> 00:54:52,331
l would friggin´ well say so!

613
00:54:53,705 --> 00:54:56,765
Oh!
Are you okay, honey?

614
00:54:56,841 --> 00:54:59,639
Yeah. Oh.

615
00:55:03,414 --> 00:55:07,316
Ernest...

616
00:55:07,385 --> 00:55:09,683
what´s wrong with me?

617
00:55:09,754 --> 00:55:12,985
lt´s a dislocated neck.
That´s what it is.

618
00:55:13,057 --> 00:55:16,652
lt could happen. l´ve never seen
it happen, but it could happen.

619
00:55:16,728 --> 00:55:20,164
Yeah, so? Fix it.

620
00:55:20,231 --> 00:55:23,029
- How?
- l don´t know. Just do it!

621
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:26,070
l wouldn´t know where
to begin, Madeline.

622
00:55:26,137 --> 00:55:28,128
For God´s sake!

623
00:55:34,012 --> 00:55:36,037
Ah!

624
00:55:36,114 --> 00:55:38,548
Oh!

625
00:55:43,121 --> 00:55:46,989
Honey, l think
l need a doctor.

626
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:54,220
- What´s the matter with this guy?
- She´s at death´s door!

627
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:56,219
Doctor, she´s at death´s door.

628
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:59,315
Why don´t you let me
be the judge of that?

629
00:55:59,392 --> 00:56:01,417
What seems to be the problem?

630
00:56:01,494 --> 00:56:03,928
l fell down the stairs.

631
00:56:03,997 --> 00:56:06,761
Whoopsie.
Anything broken?

632
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:09,700
l don´t think so. l mean,
it would hurt, wouldn´t it?

633
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:12,363
l should think so, yeah.

634
00:56:12,438 --> 00:56:16,875
Maybe my wrist,
but my neck feels sort of sore.

635
00:56:16,943 --> 00:56:19,503
Let´s have a little look at you.
Which wrist is it?

636
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:21,638
Right.

637
00:56:21,714 --> 00:56:24,512
- Does it hurt when l do this?
- No.

638
00:56:24,584 --> 00:56:27,576
- How about this?
- Nope.

639
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:32,922
- Ah, okay, this?
- Hmm, no, uh-uh.

640
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:37,328
- This doesn´t hurt?
- Uh-uh. No.

641
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:40,230
Are you telling me
it doesn´t hurt when l do this?

642
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,962
lt doesn´t hurt.
l told you that.

643
00:56:43,036 --> 00:56:46,528
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

644
00:56:46,606 --> 00:56:49,871
Okay, what´s this you´re talking
about with your neck?

645
00:56:49,943 --> 00:56:53,276
lt hurts when l kinda
turn it, you know?

646
00:56:53,346 --> 00:56:56,110
Maybe you just--

647
00:56:56,182 --> 00:56:59,913
Okay, right.
l see. Gotcha.

648
00:56:59,986 --> 00:57:04,252
- What about shock? Should we check?
- lt could be shock.

649
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:06,588
lt could be shock.

650
00:57:21,374 --> 00:57:23,672
What is--

651
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:35,717
What? What is it?
What´s the matter?

652
00:57:35,788 --> 00:57:38,450
lt´s, uh,
it´s interesting.

653
00:57:38,524 --> 00:57:41,084
lt´s okeydokey.

654
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,425
l think that
just about covers it.

655
00:57:44,497 --> 00:57:48,194
- Might l have a little sip of that?
- Of course.

656
00:57:50,603 --> 00:57:54,369
Well, l´ll tell you what.
We, this, uh, odd thing.

657
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,603
Your wrist,
as far as l can tell,

658
00:57:57,677 --> 00:58:01,078
it´s fractured in three places.

659
00:58:01,147 --> 00:58:03,581
And you´ve shattered,
uh, two, uh, vertebrae.

660
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:07,177
l can´t really be certain
without an X ray.

661
00:58:07,253 --> 00:58:11,952
But the bone protrusion through
the skin, that´s not a good sign.

662
00:58:12,025 --> 00:58:14,721
And, uh... your body temperature
is below 80...

663
00:58:14,794 --> 00:58:17,854
and, your, your, your...

664
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:20,228
your heart´s stopped beating.

665
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,701
What the hell does that mean?

666
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:26,136
Exactly! Exactly what--

667
00:58:26,205 --> 00:58:29,470
l think...
l´m gonna get a second opinion.

668
00:58:29,542 --> 00:58:31,305
Doctor?

669
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:34,107
Well, could be worse.

670
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:37,047
- l´m gonna examine you myself.
- No.

671
00:58:37,116 --> 00:58:39,380
- Sit still.
- Don´t touch me.

672
00:58:39,452 --> 00:58:43,411
- My God, he´s right.
- He is not right. Don´t be ridiculous.

673
00:58:43,489 --> 00:58:45,582
- This is incredible.
- What would it mean if he were right?

674
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:50,186
You´re in violation
of every natural law that l know.

675
00:58:50,263 --> 00:58:52,288
l, l, l,
l violated what law?

676
00:58:52,365 --> 00:58:54,458
ln violation of every
natural law that l know!

677
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:59,369
You´re sitting there,
you´re talking to me, but you´re dead!

678
00:58:59,439 --> 00:59:01,634
l´m gonna get help!

679
00:59:06,405 --> 00:59:08,805
l need a doctor!
Room 147!

680
00:59:08,874 --> 00:59:13,243
Hey! Hey!

681
00:59:13,312 --> 00:59:18,909
Respiratory therapist
to E.R. Therapist to the E.R.

682
00:59:18,984 --> 00:59:22,681
Where are all the doctors?

683
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,324
No, no, no!
Not that lab!

684
00:59:31,397 --> 00:59:34,366
Everyone clear.

685
00:59:34,433 --> 00:59:37,527
- What do we have now?
- No pulse!

686
00:59:43,842 --> 00:59:46,743
Where is she?

687
00:59:51,216 --> 00:59:54,242
l´m terribly sorry, sir.
l know how difficult this must be.

688
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,049
You don´t understand.
She didn´t--

689
00:59:57,122 --> 00:59:59,249
This is very hard to explain.

690
00:59:59,324 --> 01:00:02,259
l know it is.
How can anyone explain it?

691
01:00:02,327 --> 01:00:05,455
- Where did you put my wife?
- Don´t worry about that now.

692
01:00:05,531 --> 01:00:07,931
Just give yourself
some time to grieve.

693
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,266
- Where did you put my wife?
- She´s dead. She´s in the morgue.

694
01:00:12,337 --> 01:00:16,137
The morgue!
She´ll be furious.

695
01:01:25,077 --> 01:01:28,444
- Help!
- Yes, it´s me, darling.

696
01:01:28,514 --> 01:01:31,813
Oh, Ernest!

697
01:01:31,884 --> 01:01:36,014
l fainted and l woke up
and it was all dark.

698
01:01:36,088 --> 01:01:38,886
l kept yelling
and yelling and yelling.

699
01:01:38,957 --> 01:01:41,755
Nobody heard me.
Nobody did anything.

700
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:44,227
Then l didn´t know where
l was and l got scared.

701
01:01:44,296 --> 01:01:47,788
lt´s okay.
lt´s all right.

702
01:01:47,866 --> 01:01:51,734
Ernest, l´m in the morgue.

703
01:01:51,803 --> 01:01:54,033
- Why am l in the morgue?
- Shh! lt´s okay. lt´s okay!

704
01:01:54,106 --> 01:01:56,540
Listen! l understand now.
lt´s incredible!

705
01:01:56,608 --> 01:01:59,668
lt´s physically impossible,
but now l understand it.

706
01:01:59,745 --> 01:02:03,841
- They think l´m dead, Ernest.
- Yes! But you´re not!

707
01:02:03,916 --> 01:02:06,714
ln the whole of recorded
medical history,

708
01:02:06,785 --> 01:02:10,016
this has never happened
to another single human.

709
01:02:10,088 --> 01:02:13,888
Yeah, so, why did it have
to happen to me?

710
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:17,190
- Do you know what you are, darling?
- Uh-uh.

711
01:02:17,262 --> 01:02:21,392
You´re a sign.
You´re an omen, a burning bush!

712
01:02:21,466 --> 01:02:24,162
- l am?
- Of course you are.

713
01:02:24,236 --> 01:02:27,103
We´re being told that
we belong together.

714
01:02:27,172 --> 01:02:30,801
And l´m being called.
l´m being challenged.

715
01:02:30,876 --> 01:02:34,175
Don´t you see, Madeline?
lt´s a miracle!

716
01:03:09,681 --> 01:03:14,846
Oh, my God!

717
01:03:39,311 --> 01:03:43,372
Shit!

718
01:04:00,032 --> 01:04:02,000
Oh!

719
01:04:29,227 --> 01:04:31,354
Formaldehyde.

720
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:34,695
What in God´s name?

721
01:05:05,363 --> 01:05:07,331
Darn it.

722
01:05:12,604 --> 01:05:14,538
lt´s just not the right balance.

723
01:05:14,606 --> 01:05:17,632
- How´s it goin´, Ern?
- l don´t wanna rush things, Madeline.

724
01:05:17,709 --> 01:05:21,338
Who keeps calling?

725
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:23,881
- Huh?
- Who is that?

726
01:05:23,949 --> 01:05:27,009
l can´t have these interruptions!

727
01:05:29,821 --> 01:05:33,484
l´m gonna need you
to hold very still.

728
01:05:33,558 --> 01:05:36,026
Oh!

729
01:05:36,094 --> 01:05:39,359
- What?
- Madeline!

730
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:42,832
- l asked you to sit still.
- Mmm, what´s the matter?

731
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:45,893
- l need more turpentine now.
- Are we almost done?

732
01:05:45,971 --> 01:05:49,532
The highlights of your eyes
are unbalanced. Want people to stare?

733
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:54,408
l can´t use kerosene
because it´ll affect the skin.

734
01:05:56,581 --> 01:05:59,948
Where is she?

735
01:06:03,321 --> 01:06:07,348
Oh, my gosh, Helen!
What are you doin´ here?

736
01:06:07,425 --> 01:06:09,916
What´s that on your hands?
Blood?

737
01:06:09,995 --> 01:06:12,190
- Paint!
- Paint?

738
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:14,232
What would you be doing that
you have paint on your hands?

739
01:06:14,299 --> 01:06:16,665
- Painting.
- Ernest.

740
01:06:16,735 --> 01:06:19,898
Are you doing something funny
with Madeline?

741
01:06:19,971 --> 01:06:23,304
- Define funny.
- Oh, come on, Ernest. Cough her up!

742
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:25,673
Shh, shh, shh,
listen, Helen.

743
01:06:25,744 --> 01:06:28,110
- We should go outside and talk.
- Why are you whispering?

744
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:32,617
- She´s resting and in a foul mood.
- Are you nuts?

745
01:06:32,684 --> 01:06:35,482
- She´s resting!
- She´s not resting.

746
01:06:35,554 --> 01:06:40,014
She´s dead, Ernest, just like we wanted,
just like we plotted together.

747
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:43,959
Remember? You may have done it alone,
but l can´t walk away now.

748
01:06:44,029 --> 01:06:46,896
- Not after you put us both in jeopardy!
- Shh!

749
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:51,459
We have to bury her in Death Valley
and be done with her once and for all.

750
01:06:51,536 --> 01:06:55,028
- You have to listen to me.
- Stop waffling. She deserved it.

751
01:06:55,106 --> 01:06:59,634
She was a home wrecker.
She was a man-eater.

752
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:02,612
And she was a bad... actress.

753
01:07:02,681 --> 01:07:08,085
- Would you please listen to me!
- Oh, stop it!

754
01:07:08,153 --> 01:07:10,678
Madeline is not ready
to be buried yet.

755
01:07:10,755 --> 01:07:13,280
- She´s upstairs resting peacefully.
- Oh, fine!

756
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:15,588
lf she´s not dead,
you tell her to come here.

757
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:18,128
Tell her to come here,
walk right up to me...

758
01:07:18,196 --> 01:07:20,756
- and kiss me on the--
- Kiss you on the what?

759
01:07:22,467 --> 01:07:27,063
- Mad?
- Hel.

760
01:07:27,138 --> 01:07:30,039
- Darling.
- What have you two...

761
01:07:30,108 --> 01:07:34,204
been plotting down here
or should l say, what else?

762
01:07:34,279 --> 01:07:39,512
Are you angry, dear?
Are you very angry?

763
01:07:39,584 --> 01:07:44,248
- lt´s alive.
- Madeline?

764
01:07:44,322 --> 01:07:48,725
Oh, boy! Helen, l think you
should leave right away.

765
01:07:48,793 --> 01:07:52,695
l see a very bad
situation developing here.

766
01:07:52,764 --> 01:07:56,359
Dear? Madeline?

767
01:08:06,311 --> 01:08:08,404
l just want you
to know one thing, Hel.

768
01:08:09,981 --> 01:08:11,915
You brought
this on yourself.

769
01:08:11,983 --> 01:08:16,920
Madeline!

770
01:08:16,988 --> 01:08:21,288
Oh, my God!

771
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,557
- What have you done?
- What have l done? Defended myself.

772
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,894
You plotter, coconspirator!

773
01:08:27,966 --> 01:08:31,333
- She´s dead!
- She is?

774
01:08:31,403 --> 01:08:35,931
These are the moments
that make life worth living.

775
01:08:36,007 --> 01:08:39,238
My God, Madeline, that was horrible.
lt was brutal.

776
01:08:39,311 --> 01:08:42,337
lt was stupid!
The police, Madeline! The police!

777
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:45,440
What are they gonna do? Put me
in the gas chamber? Big deal.

778
01:08:45,517 --> 01:08:48,611
Life in prison? Know what that
means to a person in your condition?

779
01:08:48,687 --> 01:08:53,818
- So negative. Let me enjoy the moment.
- What about the neighbors?

780
01:08:53,892 --> 01:08:58,454
Neighbors? ln 12 years in Los Angeles,
have you ever seen a neighbor?

781
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:01,590
Oh! l gotta think!
l gotta think!

782
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:03,657
One of us has
to stay rational.

783
01:09:03,735 --> 01:09:08,229
l am completely rational.
We´re going to bury her.

784
01:09:08,306 --> 01:09:10,797
ln Death Valley.
You and l.

785
01:09:10,875 --> 01:09:13,309
l most certainly will not!

786
01:09:13,378 --> 01:09:18,509
Oh, no? Pretty strong words
for a murderer on the run,

787
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:22,075
which is exactly
what you are, Ernest.

788
01:09:24,322 --> 01:09:27,689
What if the police should receive
an anonymous phone call about you...

789
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:32,560
and find me on the floor
not breathing, no pulse?

790
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:35,963
Ain´t nobody can play dead
like me, Ernest.

791
01:09:36,034 --> 01:09:40,937
What will you tell them? You´re going
to be very popular in prison.

792
01:09:41,006 --> 01:09:43,907
- Prison?
- Prison.

793
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:48,173
Do you know what they do to soft,
bald, overweight Republicans...

794
01:09:48,246 --> 01:09:51,682
in prison, Ernest?

795
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:53,757
l´ll get the shovels, dear.

796
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:01,193
And she even paid
for the hardware.

797
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:05,292
Don´t you just love it?

798
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:08,497
Oh!

799
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,400
- Are you just gonna sit there?
- What?

800
01:10:12,476 --> 01:10:15,445
- l won´t be your accomplice by myself.
- l´ll help.

801
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,912
- l´m happy to help.
- Help me stretch this out. Get the end.

802
01:10:17,981 --> 01:10:21,849
- l´m very happy to help.
- Put the body right here.

803
01:10:21,919 --> 01:10:24,649
Today really shaped up
in a hurry, didn´t it?

804
01:10:24,722 --> 01:10:28,089
Did you ever notice how some days
can start out so shitty--

805
01:10:31,095 --> 01:10:34,223
...and then suddenly something wonderful
happens and your whole outlook...

806
01:10:34,298 --> 01:10:39,668
just suddenly... changes.

807
01:10:39,737 --> 01:10:43,264
That... was totally uncalled-for.

808
01:10:57,621 --> 01:11:02,752
Look at me, Ernest, just look at me.
l´m soaking wet.

809
01:11:02,826 --> 01:11:07,422
And there seems to be something wrong
with your, uh, blouse.

810
01:11:09,066 --> 01:11:13,196
l have a hole in my stomach!

811
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:16,034
Oh!

812
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:19,166
l have a hole
in my stomach!

813
01:11:19,243 --> 01:11:23,407
Yeah, and you´re still alive.

814
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:27,280
- lt´s another miracle!
- No, it isn´t.

815
01:11:34,057 --> 01:11:37,424
Ha! Ah-ha!
You took the potion!

816
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:39,689
- How do you know about that?
- Oh!

817
01:11:39,763 --> 01:11:43,426
- You took the potion too.
- Well, l hardly needed it.

818
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:47,368
So that´s why you look
the way you do and you are dead.

819
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:51,100
- When did you take it?
- October 26, 1985. Way before you!

820
01:11:51,175 --> 01:11:53,541
- What are you talking about?
- The potion!

821
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:55,578
- How much did you pay?
- Everything l had.

822
01:11:55,646 --> 01:11:57,705
- And that was cheap!
- You took a potion?

823
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:01,717
- Beauty book, my butt!
- Wait a second.

824
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:04,549
l don´t think this is
a miracle at all!

825
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:07,988
You´re a fraud, a walking lie
and l can see right through you!

826
01:12:08,058 --> 01:12:13,325
Speaking of which,
as a friend, some advice.

827
01:12:13,397 --> 01:12:17,128
l would stay out of
a bathing suit for a while.

828
01:12:17,201 --> 01:12:19,567
At least, a two piece.

829
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:21,831
Or if l--

830
01:12:31,315 --> 01:12:35,684
Damn. l just fixed this.

831
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:46,662
En garde.

832
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:48,527
- Bitch.
- Girls, girls!

833
01:12:48,599 --> 01:12:53,536
Let´s just calm down. l´m sure we can
settle this peacefully-- Whoa!

834
01:12:53,604 --> 01:12:56,937
You should learn not to compete with me.
l always win.

835
01:12:57,007 --> 01:12:59,237
Yah! Yah!

836
01:12:59,309 --> 01:13:02,278
You may have always won,
but you never played fair.

837
01:13:02,346 --> 01:13:05,440
Oh!

838
01:13:05,515 --> 01:13:08,382
Who cares how l played?
l won!

839
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:10,920
l´ll just be upstairs.

840
01:13:10,988 --> 01:13:15,391
That´s ´cause you could raise
your legs higher than anyone.

841
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:20,089
But look at you now! You couldn´t
raise an eyebrow without surgery!

842
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:22,597
l´ve raised a lot more
than an eyebrow in my day.

843
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:25,294
You skinny, phony,
hollow bitch!

844
01:13:25,369 --> 01:13:27,462
You´ve lost
your one and only talent.

845
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:31,029
Which was one more talent
than you had, you former fatso!

846
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:40,076
- Aaah!
- Yes! No! Oh, damn!

847
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:43,244
This is pointless!
Wait a minute, this is ridiculous!

848
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,584
We can´t even hurt each other!
We can´t even inflict pain!

849
01:13:45,656 --> 01:13:47,886
Pain!

850
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:51,655
l´ll tell ya about pain!
Bobby O´Brien!

851
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:55,323
Scott Hunter! Ernest Menville!
That´s pain!

852
01:13:55,399 --> 01:13:58,197
l loved every one of them
and they loved me.

853
01:13:58,268 --> 01:14:01,431
l will not speak to you till
you put your head on straight.

854
01:14:04,675 --> 01:14:07,200
They were all l had and
you took them away from me.

855
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:10,007
Not because you loved them,
not because you cared...

856
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,810
but just to hurt me on purpose.

857
01:14:12,883 --> 01:14:14,874
- That is not true!
- Liar!

858
01:14:14,952 --> 01:14:17,546
- You attacked me first!
- Me?

859
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:20,351
Do you think
l was blind, deaf?

860
01:14:20,424 --> 01:14:25,452
l couldn´t hear what you and your
snotty friends were saying about me?

861
01:14:25,529 --> 01:14:29,932
- You thought l was cheap.
- Oh, please. You´re insane.

862
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,458
Then how come you never invited me
to one of those parties at your parents?

863
01:14:33,537 --> 01:14:36,768
Because we didn´t think
you´d feel comfortable.

864
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,105
- lt wasn´t usual for-- Stop that!
- l´m trying.

865
01:14:40,177 --> 01:14:44,238
- lt wasn´t usual for us to have--
- Trash in the house!

866
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:47,579
You´re avoiding the issue. You stole
my boyfriends to hurt me on purpose!

867
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:49,585
- l did not!
- Admit it!

868
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:53,316
No, you admit it.
You look me in the eye...

869
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:59,124
and you admit
you thought l was cheap.

870
01:15:11,742 --> 01:15:17,203
Okay, l thought you were cheap.

871
01:15:22,252 --> 01:15:26,018
Well,

872
01:15:26,089 --> 01:15:28,649
l hurt you on purpose.

873
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:33,526
and l´m... really sorry.

874
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,222
l´m sorry too.

875
01:15:41,592 --> 01:15:43,856
Ern, darling.

876
01:15:43,928 --> 01:15:47,921
Helen and l want to apologize
for that little thing downstairs.

877
01:15:47,999 --> 01:15:52,368
- We´ve got it out of our systems now.
- Yeah, thank God.

878
01:15:52,436 --> 01:15:55,769
lt was so awful hating you
and envying you at the same time.

879
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,172
You envied me?
l envied you!

880
01:15:58,242 --> 01:16:00,506
- You did not!
- l did too.

881
01:16:00,578 --> 01:16:03,240
- Specifically, what part did you envy?
- Your grade point for one.

882
01:16:03,314 --> 01:16:06,215
Excuse me. Excuse me!

883
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:14,453
l just wanted to tell you both
that l´ve come to a decision that´s...

884
01:16:14,525 --> 01:16:18,825
very important
and long overdue.

885
01:16:18,896 --> 01:16:21,330
- l´m leaving.
- You´re what? Leaving? No.

886
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:24,425
- We need you.
- l promised Hel you would fix her.

887
01:16:24,502 --> 01:16:26,834
And Maddie needs work too.

888
01:16:26,904 --> 01:16:31,398
- You can go first.
- Oh, that´s so sweet of you!

889
01:16:31,475 --> 01:16:33,500
Thank you. Ern?

890
01:16:33,578 --> 01:16:38,675
Come on. What do you say?
For old times sake.

891
01:16:38,749 --> 01:16:40,774
Please!

892
01:16:44,722 --> 01:16:49,625
On one condition.
When l´m done, l go.

893
01:16:51,529 --> 01:16:55,329
You don´t look for me.
You don´t ask about me.

894
01:16:55,399 --> 01:16:57,390
You don´t even think
about me ever again.

895
01:16:57,468 --> 01:17:01,802
l have no problem with that.
Do you?

896
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:05,205
Not anymore.

897
01:17:19,357 --> 01:17:22,053
- Oh!
- Oh! lt´s amazing!

898
01:17:22,126 --> 01:17:24,959
- Oh!
- Not a blemish! Not a pore!

899
01:17:25,029 --> 01:17:29,659
Oh! Say what you will about Ernest,
but the man is a genius.

900
01:17:29,734 --> 01:17:32,032
He is. He´s a genius.

901
01:17:32,103 --> 01:17:34,936
- Wait. You´ve got a little thing.
- Ooh!

902
01:17:35,006 --> 01:17:37,474
Probably shouldn´t have done that.
Ha-ha!

903
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:40,032
- l think it´s still... wet.
- Can Ernest fix this?

904
01:17:40,111 --> 01:17:42,102
- Yeah, l´ll get him before he leaves.
- But wait a minute.

905
01:17:42,179 --> 01:17:43,669
What if this
happens again?

906
01:17:43,748 --> 01:17:46,216
What if it fades? Chips?
What if it rains?

907
01:17:46,284 --> 01:17:48,411
- Will he come back for touch-ups?
- Even if he does,

908
01:17:48,486 --> 01:17:50,477
he´s not gonna live forever.

909
01:17:50,554 --> 01:17:53,352
- That´s not good.
- What are we gonna do?

910
01:17:53,424 --> 01:17:55,892
- He´ll have to take the potion.
- Yeah!

911
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,928
We´ll take him to Lisle´s.
She´ll talk him into it.

912
01:17:57,995 --> 01:18:00,725
He won´t go to Lisle´s. You heard him.
He´s made up his mind about leaving.

913
01:18:00,798 --> 01:18:04,290
That´s true.
We have to respect that.

914
01:18:04,368 --> 01:18:07,895
l know. We´ll drug him.

915
01:18:07,972 --> 01:18:10,532
Ern, darling.

916
01:18:10,608 --> 01:18:13,133
My taxi here?

917
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:16,873
We thought you might
like some breakfast.

918
01:18:20,918 --> 01:18:24,547
You know,
l was just thinking.

919
01:18:24,622 --> 01:18:28,183
l was questioning myself.
l was wondering why...

920
01:18:28,259 --> 01:18:31,023
l didn´t pack this thing
five years ago,

921
01:18:31,095 --> 01:18:34,587
six years ago, ten years ago,
instead of sticking around here...

922
01:18:34,665 --> 01:18:38,658
and suffering
every indignity and humiliation.

923
01:18:38,736 --> 01:18:42,502
l´ll tell ya why.
Because l made a promise...

924
01:18:42,573 --> 01:18:44,564
and that meant
everything to me.

925
01:18:44,642 --> 01:18:48,408
Yes, it´s all very noble
to keep your word.

926
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:50,845
Ernest? Your drink?

927
01:18:50,915 --> 01:18:54,214
Do you know what they call someone who
sticks by their word no matter what?

928
01:18:54,285 --> 01:18:57,345
- At the cost of all else? Do you know?
- No.

929
01:18:57,421 --> 01:19:01,448
An idiot. From now on l´m gonna be
the kind of idiot l wanna be.

930
01:19:01,525 --> 01:19:04,426
An idiot with a modicum of pride,
because you know what?

931
01:19:04,495 --> 01:19:08,158
l finally realized something.
l´ve lived up to my promise.

932
01:19:08,232 --> 01:19:11,668
Till death do us part.

933
01:19:11,736 --> 01:19:15,900
Well, you girls are dead.

934
01:19:15,973 --> 01:19:18,965
And l´m parting.

935
01:19:19,043 --> 01:19:21,273
Cheers.

936
01:19:22,847 --> 01:19:25,543
You know something else?

937
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:33,916
l drink too much.

938
01:19:36,494 --> 01:19:38,462
What?

939
01:20:17,668 --> 01:20:23,163
l´m glad to see you´re
awake, Dr. Menville.

940
01:20:29,713 --> 01:20:32,614
l hope you don´t mind...

941
01:20:32,683 --> 01:20:36,676
that Harry and Dick
had to dress you.

942
01:20:36,754 --> 01:20:41,589
You were improperly
attired for the occasion.

943
01:20:41,659 --> 01:20:43,820
What occasion?

944
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:48,496
l´m throwing a party upstairs.

945
01:20:48,566 --> 01:20:52,195
l throw one every spring
for my clients.

946
01:20:52,269 --> 01:20:55,033
All right.

947
01:20:55,105 --> 01:20:57,096
Okay.

948
01:21:03,514 --> 01:21:06,108
- What do you want with me?
- To you...

949
01:21:06,183 --> 01:21:11,348
l would like to give
a present.

950
01:21:11,422 --> 01:21:14,289
The gift of life...

951
01:21:14,358 --> 01:21:18,852
and youth forever.

952
01:21:25,069 --> 01:21:29,529
l saw your wife
and friend.

953
01:21:29,607 --> 01:21:31,734
You did
brilliant work.

954
01:21:31,809 --> 01:21:33,743
Show me your hand.

955
01:21:37,147 --> 01:21:40,344
Come on.
l won´t bite.

956
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:46,520
What are you doing?

957
01:21:47,925 --> 01:21:50,985
l´m loving you.

958
01:22:41,946 --> 01:22:44,847
My God!

959
01:22:47,451 --> 01:22:49,976
Oh, thank you.

960
01:22:54,124 --> 01:22:58,322
But don´t be modest.
That´s what you do.

961
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:01,489
This is what
you´ve always done.

962
01:23:01,565 --> 01:23:05,524
Stopped time in people´s
faces and in their hands.

963
01:23:05,603 --> 01:23:08,731
You are like
Don Quixote,

964
01:23:08,806 --> 01:23:13,106
tilting at
nature´s windmill.

965
01:23:13,177 --> 01:23:16,237
Drink it.

966
01:23:16,313 --> 01:23:19,282
Go on.

967
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:24,413
lt is the completion
of your life´s work.

968
01:23:24,488 --> 01:23:27,719
You gave
other people youth...

969
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:30,487
and wasted your own.

970
01:23:30,561 --> 01:23:32,859
Drink!

971
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:36,093
You´ll be able to work again...
forever.

972
01:23:36,166 --> 01:23:38,828
Drink.

973
01:23:38,902 --> 01:23:41,496
Drink!
Dr. Menville!

974
01:23:41,572 --> 01:23:46,441
You owe yourself
another chance. Drink!

975
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:49,673
Make the right choice!
The only choice!

976
01:23:49,747 --> 01:23:53,012
Drink!
Siempre viva!

977
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:55,779
Live forever!

978
01:23:55,853 --> 01:23:59,118
Then what?

979
01:23:59,189 --> 01:24:01,953
What?

980
01:24:02,026 --> 01:24:04,961
- Then what happens?
- What?

981
01:24:05,029 --> 01:24:08,897
l don´t wanna
live forever.

982
01:24:08,966 --> 01:24:13,062
lt sounds good, but what am l gonna do?
What if l get bored?

983
01:24:13,137 --> 01:24:15,867
- What?
- What if l get lonely?

984
01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:18,066
Who am l gonna hang around with,
Madeline and Helen?

985
01:24:18,142 --> 01:24:20,235
What if something happens to me?
What if l get maimed?

986
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:23,336
What if l get shot?
What if somebody pushes me down--

987
01:24:23,414 --> 01:24:25,974
What if l fall down a flight
of stairs or something?

988
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:29,542
- But you never grow old.
- But everybody else will.

989
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,884
l´ll have to watch
everyone around me die.

990
01:24:33,457 --> 01:24:35,448
l don´t think
this is right.

991
01:24:35,526 --> 01:24:38,222
This is not a dream.
This is a nightmare.

992
01:24:38,295 --> 01:24:40,627
You people all
have to be stopped.

993
01:24:40,698 --> 01:24:43,360
Dick, Tom, Harry.

994
01:24:44,735 --> 01:24:47,101
Get the potion from him!

995
01:24:52,743 --> 01:24:56,611
- Get him! Get him!
- Relax. He won´t go far.

996
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,852
Not at his age.

997
01:25:40,961 --> 01:25:46,797
Welcome, everyone.
Lisle will be down in a few minutes.

998
01:25:51,572 --> 01:25:56,236
First, l must remind all of you
who staged your own deaths...

999
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:59,143
of our very strict
policy against...

1000
01:25:59,213 --> 01:26:03,047
popping up in public
to grab a few headlines.

1001
01:26:04,751 --> 01:26:08,744
l won´t name names.
You know who you are.

1002
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:14,491
l was just trying to have some fun.
That´s all.

1003
01:26:15,729 --> 01:26:17,720
Look!
There´s Ernest!

1004
01:26:19,433 --> 01:26:22,334
Oh, my God!
He still looks like hell.

1005
01:26:22,402 --> 01:26:24,427
l don´t think she gave him
the good stuff.

1006
01:26:24,504 --> 01:26:27,234
Look!

1007
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,673
He´s still got it!

1008
01:26:31,578 --> 01:26:32,977
Let´s go.

1009
01:26:33,046 --> 01:26:35,412
Oh, everybody
gather round.

1010
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:37,416
Lisle will be with us
in a very few seconds.

1011
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:40,248
Gentlemen, please,
seal the room.

1012
01:27:03,277 --> 01:27:05,768
He´s going up.

1013
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:07,711
ldiot!

1014
01:27:25,732 --> 01:27:27,791
Aaah!

1015
01:27:55,162 --> 01:27:57,255
Oh, boy!

1016
01:28:48,315 --> 01:28:50,647
Ernest!

1017
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:59,425
Ernest!

1018
01:28:59,493 --> 01:29:02,360
- Helen!
- Grab it!

1019
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:07,793
- l--
- Ernest!

1020
01:29:07,868 --> 01:29:09,995
Ernest! Grab it!

1021
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:13,005
Grab it!

1022
01:29:13,073 --> 01:29:15,564
Grab it!
Grab it!

1023
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:24,241
Ernest! Do you still have the potion?
Do you still have it?

1024
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:27,047
Find it! Find it!

1025
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,453
lt´s the only way
you´ll survive if you fall.

1026
01:29:30,524 --> 01:29:32,924
Drink it!
Drink it or you´ll die!

1027
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:36,895
- Oh!
- After you fall,

1028
01:29:36,963 --> 01:29:39,955
you can put yourself
back together again.

1029
01:29:41,768 --> 01:29:44,965
Drink it!

1030
01:29:45,038 --> 01:29:47,836
- Drink it. Drink it!
- Drink it!

1031
01:29:49,876 --> 01:29:52,436
Drink it! Drink it!

1032
01:29:54,614 --> 01:29:57,174
You have to!

1033
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:59,878
We need you!

1034
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:07,021
l´m sorry, dears.

1035
01:30:07,094 --> 01:30:09,790
You´re on your own.

1036
01:30:49,269 --> 01:30:51,203
So...

1037
01:30:51,271 --> 01:30:53,762
are you gonna be
done soon or what?

1038
01:30:55,509 --> 01:31:00,503
Oh, yes!
l´m gonna be done very soon.

1039
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:08,346
That was pretty neat.

1040
01:31:41,755 --> 01:31:44,883
lt´d be better for both of you
to get him back.

1041
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:49,019
- Yes?
- Nothing. lt´s too late. He got away.

1042
01:31:49,095 --> 01:31:51,359
- Damn!
- l said we should go to the airport!

1043
01:31:51,431 --> 01:31:54,093
- You said no such thing.
- l knew he wasn´t coming back here.

1044
01:31:54,167 --> 01:31:57,364
- You have all the answers, don´t you?
- Ohh! Look!

1045
01:31:57,437 --> 01:32:00,406
- l´m peeling already!
- Oh!

1046
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:04,034
- Me too!
- Who´s gonna fix this?

1047
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:06,908
- We´re in trouble. Ernest is gone.
- Uh-huh.

1048
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:11,076
We can´t go back to Lisle´s.
She told us to take care of our bodies.

1049
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:14,848
- And look at us! We´re dead!
- Yeah!

1050
01:32:14,921 --> 01:32:17,651
This is so embarrassing.

1051
01:32:17,724 --> 01:32:22,218
You know what this is? This is simply
a question of, uh, maintenance!

1052
01:32:22,295 --> 01:32:26,698
Yeah, this is upkeep. We just have
to be very careful with ourselves.

1053
01:32:26,766 --> 01:32:29,098
We have to take
care of each other.

1054
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:33,196
l´ll paint your ass;
you paint mine.

1055
01:32:33,273 --> 01:32:35,434
- Who could have imagined?
- Yeah.

1056
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:38,238
- You and me... together.
- Yeah, l know.

1057
01:32:38,311 --> 01:32:41,212
Depending on each other.

1058
01:32:41,281 --> 01:32:44,341
Painting each
other´s asses.

1059
01:32:44,417 --> 01:32:47,716
- Day and night.
- Oh, yeah. Forever.

1060
01:32:47,787 --> 01:32:50,943
Forever.

1061
01:32:58,017 --> 01:33:01,384
We´re gathered here today
to honor the passing...

1062
01:33:01,454 --> 01:33:05,652
of a man of courage
and of vision.

1063
01:33:05,725 --> 01:33:10,628
Now, Dr. Ernest Menville
always felt life begins at 50.

1064
01:33:10,696 --> 01:33:14,063
And since we know so little
of Ernest before that age,

1065
01:33:14,133 --> 01:33:16,761
perhaps in his case,
it´s really true.

1066
01:33:16,836 --> 01:33:21,330
Because it wasn´t until 50
he met his lovely wife, Claire,

1067
01:33:21,407 --> 01:33:25,104
that he had two sons
and four daughters...

1068
01:33:25,177 --> 01:33:28,544
and then like a
biblical patriarch...

1069
01:33:28,614 --> 01:33:31,378
began to spread
his message of hope...

1070
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:36,012
to his adopted children
all around the world.

1071
01:33:36,088 --> 01:33:40,718
A brilliant academic
as well as a rugged outdoorsman,

1072
01:33:40,793 --> 01:33:44,729
Dr. Menville pursued with vigor
a variety of pursuits...

1073
01:33:44,797 --> 01:33:48,563
not just to attain
some personal ambition...

1074
01:33:48,634 --> 01:33:52,331
but to enhance
the world for us...

1075
01:33:52,405 --> 01:33:56,967
and make it a better place
than he found it.

1076
01:33:57,043 --> 01:33:59,568
Oh, and that he did.

1077
01:33:59,645 --> 01:34:02,580
The Menville Marriage
Counseling Clinic,

1078
01:34:02,648 --> 01:34:06,049
the Menville Center
for the Study of Women,

1079
01:34:06,118 --> 01:34:11,681
and of course, Ernest´s AA chapter
will carry on long after his death.

1080
01:34:22,068 --> 01:34:26,004
...was for him
a delightful adventure.

1081
01:34:26,072 --> 01:34:30,532
Who among us never knew
Ernest the prankster? Hmm?

1082
01:34:30,609 --> 01:34:33,009
Ernest the storyteller?

1083
01:34:33,079 --> 01:34:38,642
We´ve all heard his tall tales about
the living dead in Beverly Hills.

1084
01:34:38,718 --> 01:34:44,156
- Ah, but you see--
- Oh, what?

1085
01:34:44,223 --> 01:34:48,751
- You´re not crying, are you?
- l´m not crying.

1086
01:34:48,828 --> 01:34:52,628
l have...
something in my eye.

1087
01:34:56,535 --> 01:34:59,333
- Oh!
- Yech!

1088
01:34:59,405 --> 01:35:02,670
Oh! Do you have
that number 9 acrylic?

1089
01:35:02,742 --> 01:35:05,267
Look. l put it in your bag.

1090
01:35:05,344 --> 01:35:07,471
- Oh!
- l must have dropped it somewhere.

1091
01:35:07,546 --> 01:35:11,073
- No. l put it in your bag!
- Well.

1092
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:13,983
Who could drop a big can of
spray paint for God´s sake?

1093
01:35:14,053 --> 01:35:17,614
l had it
when we left the car, okay?

1094
01:35:17,690 --> 01:35:20,318
Let´s get the hell
outta here.

1095
01:35:20,393 --> 01:35:25,558
l, for one, honestly believe
this teacher, this benefactor,

1096
01:35:25,631 --> 01:35:30,625
this man,
had in his own way...

1097
01:35:30,703 --> 01:35:35,106
learned the secret
of eternal life.

1098
01:35:37,276 --> 01:35:43,181
And it´s here, among us,
in the hearts of his friends.

1099
01:35:43,249 --> 01:35:48,152
And the secret
of eternal youth right here...

1100
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:53,214
in the lives of his children
and his grandchildren.

1101
01:35:53,292 --> 01:35:57,592
lt is my opinion
that our beloved Ernest...

1102
01:35:57,663 --> 01:36:01,429
is one man
who will indeed...

1103
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:06,130
live forever.

1104
01:36:06,205 --> 01:36:09,732
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

1105
01:36:09,809 --> 01:36:12,505
What´d you do
with that spray paint can?

1106
01:36:12,578 --> 01:36:16,014
Come on. Get off that. Let me see what
kind of a mess you´ve made of yourself.

1107
01:36:18,818 --> 01:36:20,809
Oh, yeah,
you´re all runny.

1108
01:36:20,886 --> 01:36:25,016
- l must look ridiculous.
- No, l don´t think anyone will notice.

1109
01:36:25,091 --> 01:36:28,151
But l think you´re gonna need
a little bondo on the chin, babe.

1110
01:36:28,227 --> 01:36:30,821
- l gotta get to the hardware store.
- Oh, now, come on!

1111
01:36:30,896 --> 01:36:33,091
How could you have lost
an entire can of spray paint?

1112
01:36:33,165 --> 01:36:36,191
Why do l have to carry everything?
You get to carry a baby purse.

1113
01:36:36,268 --> 01:36:38,668
- Where did you see it last?
- lf l knew, l´d know where it was.

1114
01:36:38,737 --> 01:36:41,763
- An entire can of spray paint.
- Get off it!

1115
01:36:41,841 --> 01:36:44,366
Has that ever worked? When you ask me
where l last saw something?

1116
01:36:44,443 --> 01:36:47,344
Yes. When you lost
your index finger.

1117
01:36:47,413 --> 01:36:50,871
- l didn´t lose it. lt broke off.
- That´s because you crack--

1118
01:36:53,185 --> 01:36:56,586
Help me! My legs aren´t working!
Help me!

1119
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,864
Do you remember
where you parked the car?
