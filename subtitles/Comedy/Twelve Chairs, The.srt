JEFFREY: Five thousand.

166
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,983
I'll wire a check
to your account as usual.

167
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,184
Five thousand dollars!
Five thousand dollars!

168
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,282
Five thousand dollars.

169
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,691
I'll give him the deluxe
mental hospital tour.

170
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,526
My man!
Kid around,
makes 'em feel good.

171
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,657
We're pals. I love you.
You're the prisoners.
No, you're the guards.

172
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,327
Now you got it.

173
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,962
Okay, it's all in good fun.

174
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,040
Here's some games here.
And there's...

175
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,266

He was in my chair.

178
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,547
Games. Games.

179
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,280
Here's some games.
Games that wanna get out.

180
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:02,117
See? More games.
Games, they vegetize you.

181
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,052
See?

182
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,654
If you play the games,
you're voluntarily
taking a tranquilizer.

183
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,062
I guess they gave you
some chemical restraints.

184
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,328
Drugs!

185
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,735
What'd they give you?
Thorazine? Haldol?
How much? How much?

186
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,068
Learn your drugs.
Know your doses.
It's elementary.

187
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,633
I need to make
a telephone call.
A telephone call?

188
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,576
That's communication
with the outside world.

189
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,046
Doctor's discretion. No.

190
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,878
If all of these nuts
could just make phone calls,

191
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,784
it could spread insanity,
oozing through
telephone cables,

192
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:34,552
oozing to the ears
of all these poor,
sane people, infecting them.

193
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,389
Wackos everywhere.
A plague of madness.

194
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,189
In fact, very few, Jim...

195
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,231
Jim, very few of us here
are actually mentally ill.

196
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,198
I'm not saying
you're not mentally ill.

197
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,827
For all I know
you're crazy as a loon.

198
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,496
But that's not
why you're here.

199
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,631
That's not why you're here!
That's not why you're here!

200
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,303
You're here
because of the system.

201
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,715
There's the television.
It's all right there.

202
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:00,874
All right there.

203
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,783
Look, listen, kneel, pray.
The commercials!

204
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,188
We're not productive anymore.
Don't make things anymore.

205
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:12,024
It's all automated.
What are we for then?
We're consumers, Jim.

206
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,988
Okay, okay.
Buy a lot of stuff,
you're a good citizen.

207
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,159
But if you don't buy
a lot of stuff,
what are you then?

208
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,635
What? You're mentally ill!

209
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,932
Fact, Jim. Fact.

210
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,006
If you don't buy things:
toilet paper, new cars,

211
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,270
electrically operated
sexual devices,

212
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,436
stereo systems with
brain-implanted headphones,

213

built-in radar devices,

215
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:37,215
Take it easy, Jeffrey.
Be calm.

216
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,849

attractive woman.

(EXCLAIMS)

218
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,228
If you want to watch
a particular television
program, like All My Children,

219
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,563
you can go to the charge nurse
and tell her the day,

220
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,261
the time the show you
wanna see is on.

221
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,464
But you have to tell her
before the show is
scheduled to be on.

222
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,803
There was this guy
and he was always requesting
shows that had already played.

223
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,106
Yes. No. You have
to tell her before.

224
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,702
He couldn't quite
grasp the idea

225
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,942
that the charge nurse
couldn't make it be yesterday.

226
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,347
She couldn't turn back time!
Thank you, Einstein.

227
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,877
Now he, he was nuts.
He was a fruitcake, Jim.

228
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,946
Okay, that's it, Jeffrey.

229
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,991
You're going to get a shot.

230
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,390
I warned you.

231
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,964
Right. Right, right, right.
I got a little carried away

232
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,694
explaining the inner workings
of the institution to Jim.

00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,088
It's a condition of
mental divergence.

239
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,457
I find myself
on the planet Ogo.

240
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,453
Part of an intellectual elite

preparing to subjugate
the barbarian hordes on Pluto.

242
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:04,203
But even though
this is a totally convincing
reality for me in every way,

243
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,103
nevertheless, Ogo is actually
a construct of my psyche.

244
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,671

245
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:17,347

certain unnamed realities

that plague my life here.

00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,689
When I stop going there,

248
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,093
I will be well.

make a telephone call.

everything out?

to know that they sent me
to the wrong time.

01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:52,577
It's important you surrender
instead of their catching
you running.

1166
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:54,443
Wouldn't it be great
if I was crazy?

1167
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,346
The world would be okay.
I wouldn't have to
live underground.

1168
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:57,406
Gimme the gun.
I lost the gun.

1169
01:17:57,472 --> 01:18:00,111
Where is the gun?
I could live right here.

You got water, air, stars.

1171
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,089
I'm gonna attract
their attention...

1172
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:08,150

They're gonna tell you to
put your hands on your head.

01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:36,887
Then I said something
about cooperating, and he said
he would do that. So, I...

1181
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,289
I got in the car.

1182
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,584
Thanks. And when I...

1183
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:46,664
I started honking the horn.
Then when I got out,
he was gone.

1184
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:49,463
I'll tell you somethin'.
You lucked out.

1185
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:52,732
For a while, we thought
you were a body they found
down state, mutilated.

He wouldn't do that.
This the man he attacked?

I wanna be clear
about this, okay?

1188
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:05,476
This man and the other one
were severely beating us.

a psychiatrist and all.

1193
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:18,656
Why is it that kidnap victims

1194
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:22,133
always try to tell us
about the guys
who grabbed 'em?

1195

And they try to
make us understand

1196
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:28,396
how kind these bastards
really were?

1197
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:31,868
It's a normal reaction

He's sick. Okay?

1199

He thinks he comes

With the kidnapping
of the Baltimore woman,

three animal rights activists
bound and gagged

in their Second Avenue
headquarters.

1219

Do they really believe
he's going to show up here?
Please.

1220
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:51,479
And in Fresno, California,
the cornfield that was jammed
with spectators...

He's dead, isn't he,
that little boy?

1222
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:56,955
He's fine. It was just a prank
he and his friends pulled.

to rescue Ricky Neuman
from an abandoned mineshaft

1224

ended abruptly
when playmates confessed

1225
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,900
that Neuman's disappearance
was merely a prank.

1226
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:09,699
And that, in fact,
the missing child was hiding
in a nearby barn.

You know the difference
between what's real
and what's not.

Hello.

01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:36,465
Dr. Railly, Jim Halperin,
Philly P.D. Sorry to call you
so early this mornin'.

1313
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:37,805
You found him?

1314
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,403
Is he okay?

1315
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:42,470
No, no, au contraire, Doctor.

1316
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:44,346
No sign of your good friend,
the kidnapper.

1317
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:46,578
However, the plot
does thicken.

1318
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:48,986
I've got a ballistics
report on my desk.

1319
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:52,114
It says the bullet
you claim you removed
from Mr. Cole's thigh

1320
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,920
is, in fact, an antique.

1321
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:59,227
HALPERIN: And all indications
are it was fired sometime
prior to the 1920s.

1322
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:01,264
How 'bout l take
a spin down there?

1323
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:02,425
This can't be.

1324
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,025
Maybe we can grab
a bite to eat.

1325
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:07,437
Maybe you could revise
or amplify your statement.

1326
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:09,066
Dr. Railly?

1327
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:37,193
No!

1328
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:45,404
You can't trick us, you know.
