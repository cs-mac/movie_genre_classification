1
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,170
Yeah, baby!

2
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,020
Hi, I'm Dixie. Dixie Normous.

3
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,320
I may just be a small town FBI-agent, slash single mother.

4
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,200
But I'm still tough...and sexy.

5
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,450
Well, Miss Normous...

6
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,120
Shall we shag now or shag later?

7
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,330
Oh Austin...behave.

8
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,590
Hey Powers!

9
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,380
You better watch your freaking self.

10
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,640
Because this is one doctor who does make house calls.

11
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,270
Right, Mini-Me?

12
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,810
Hey, assholes!

13
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,030
I'm right over here, I'm Mine-Me. Come and get me!

14
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,620
- And cut!
- That's a cut everybody.

15
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,880
So, Austin, what did you think of the opening credits?

16
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,800
Well, I can't believe Sir Steven Spielberg, the grooviest -

17
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,050
- film maker in history of cinema, -

18
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,100
- is making a movie about my life.

19
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,020
Very shagadelic baby, yeah!

20
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,520
Having said that, I do have some thoughts.

21
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,940
Really? My friend here thinks it's fine the way it is.

22
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,860
Well no offense Sir Stevie, but you gotta have Mojo baby, yeah!

23
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,910
Hit it!

24
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,400
Ladies and Gentlemen.

25
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,810
Sir Quincy Jones.

26
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,740
This is where the movie get its Mojo, baby.

27
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,680
Alright, everybody. Music video, take 2.

28
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,180
It's Britney Spears!

29
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,730
Oops. I did it again, baby.

30
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,910
Welcome back Herr Doctor.

31
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,030
How was space?

32
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,200
Space was cool, wasn't it Mini-Me?

33
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,790
Doctor Evil, while you were in space.

34
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,630
I created a way for us to make huge sums of legitimate money.

35
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,800
And still maintain the ethics in the business practices -

36
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,010
- of an evil organization.

37
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:58,060
- I have turned us into a talent agency. The Hollywood Talent Agency.
- Really?

38
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,230
By charging A-list clients 9 % rather that the traditional 10 %.

39
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,020
We've been able to sign such stars -

40
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,020
- such as George Clooney, -

41
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,650
- Julia Roberts.

42
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,230
And Leo DiCaprio.

43
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,320
Leo!

44
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,860
And the best part of the whole scheme is, -

45
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,410
- we all get our own assistance.

46
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,330
Hi, I'm Number 3.

47
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,540
I'm really excited to be a part of the team, here in HTA.

48
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,500
Very impressive, Number 2, -

49
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,630
- but I finally have the perfect plan.

50
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,840
In the 70s, there lived a Dutch metallurgical heathenish, -

51
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,140
- by the name of Johann Van Der Smut.

52
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,220
He loved gold so much he even lost his genitaliens in an
unfortunate smelting accident.

53
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,640
Hence the name...Goldmember.

54
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,320
He invented a cold fusion power unit for a..."Tractorbeam".

55
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,610
"Tractorbeam"

56
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,490
Powerful enough to pull a meteor to Earth.

57
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,080
The meteor was called..."Midas 22".

58
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,660
It's made of solid gold...is he sleeping?

59
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,630
Well, that's okay. I guess Mini-Me won't get any, CHOCOLATE!

60
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,470
You want down Mini-Me? Use your words like a big boy clone.

61
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,350
He's okay!

62
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,850
Here's the chocolate. It's from Brugge. That's in Belgium, that's where daddy's from.

63
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,690
Check out Mini-Me.

64
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,450
He's gone mental on candied chocolate.

65
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,580
It's like freakin' catnip for clothes.

66
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,290
- Your chair, Dr. Evil.
- Thank you.

67
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,140
Thanks, scedadum, right.

68
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,810
You know, when you have kids, I think your gonna find out
that all kids are different, ey?

69
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,480
For example: Mini-Me loves chocolate.

70
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,110
Scotty don't!

71
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,820
Well, I love chocolate fine. I just...

72
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,650
Scotty don't!

73
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,450
Oh yeah, very familiar, hang on, let me do what I do. Would you stop...

74
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,030
How about I what?

75
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,740
What do you...

76
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,540
I don't even...

77
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,710
Honestly, isn't this...

78
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,330
How about you don't, ladies and gentlemen, Scotty don't.

79
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,210
Dr. Evil, perhaps it's time, that you finish unveiling your plan.

80
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,670
Yes, thank you Number 2.

81
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,590
Ladies and gentlemen, my plan is...

82
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,430
Scotty don't.

83
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,510
Oh, come on, you're such a lame ass!

84
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,990
You know what? This is causing me serious psychological harm!

85
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,610
I don't know. Who am I?

86
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,910
Fine. You know what? I would love some chocolate.

87
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,990
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

88
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,380
Heel Mini-Me!

89
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,550
Come on!

90
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,470
You okay, Mini-Me?

91
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,600
Did I pull too hard? I don't want to hurt you.

92
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,100
- Dr. Evil.
- Yo?

93
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,020
What does Goldmember's plan have to do with us?

94
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,770
Our earlier attempts of the tractorbeam went through several preparations.

95
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,770
Preparation A through G were a complete failure.

96
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,940
But now ladies and gentlemen, we finally have a working tractorbeam.

97
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,780
Which we shall call "Preparation H".

98
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,370
What?

99
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,000
Why don't you just call it "Operation Ass-creamy", ass?

100
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,630
I'm sorry did you want some ice-cream?

101
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,840
Yes, I'd love some chocolate ass-cream.

102
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,590
Perhaps later.

103
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,930
Dr. Evil, I love your plan.

104
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,180
Ja, Herr Doctor, it's a really good plan.

105
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,680
Yes, Frau, on the whole, I think Preparation H fells good.

106
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,640
What is it now?

107
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,940
No, nothing. You know what? I agree...

108
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,360
Preparation H does feel good.

109
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,730
On the hole.

110
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,200
Well, I'm glad wir sprechen sie the same lingity.

111
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,990
Ladies and gentlemen. Using my time machine I shall travel back to 1975.

112
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,830
Pick up Goldmember and bring him back to the future.

113
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,620
And the best part of this plan is...

114
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,960
No one can stop me.

115
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,510
Not even...Austin Powers.

116
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,350
Not so fast.

117
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,520
You're sorrounded Dr. Evil.

118
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,070
Shit!

119
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,030
Dr. Evil, the world court sentences you to 400 years.

120
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,910
Do you have anything to say?

121
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,120
No, but I think Mini-Me does.

122
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,340
Looks like two eggs and a hankie.

123
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,010
The criminal genius known as, Dr. Evil and his clone -

124
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,010
- were sentenced today at the world organization.

125
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,560
For his efforts, Austin Powers, -

126
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,890
- the son of England's most famous spy, Nigel Powers.

127
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,560
Will be knighted by The Queen at Buckingham Palace.

128
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,860
Arise, Sir Austin Powers.

129
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

130
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,160
Your father must be very proud of you.

131
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,530
Oh, yeah.

132
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,990
Come on dad, stand up and take a bow.

133
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,410
"Daddy wasn't there" Peace!

134
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,240
I am a sexy beast.

135
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,380
It's Austin Powers, you're so funny.

136
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,670
Also very sexy.

137
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,340
Can I have an autograph?

138
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,640
Of course, your name is?

139
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,890
Fook Mi.

140
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,020
Oh behave, baby. Now your name is?

141
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,150
Fook Mi.

142
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,110
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

143
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,150
Fook Mi, like this.

144
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,490
Oh I see.

145
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
Your name is Fook Mi.

146
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,450
You want a drink?

147
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:59,580
Yes of course, but I have private bar in the back, that you are more than welcome to use...

148
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,210
Here you go.

149
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,920
Fook Mi! That was fast!

150
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,500
Fook Yu.

151
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,050
Oh, you're going the right way for a smack-bottom and I don't care who knows it!

152
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,170
Austin.

153
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,430
This is my twin sister, her name, Fook Yu. Fook Yu...Fook Mi.

154
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,940
Twins...twins

155
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,440
Twins. Yes. We're going to see the twins.

156
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,530
I also think Austin Powers is very sexy.

157
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,200
We think you're very great.

158
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,120
We make you sleepy?

159
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,880
Well, you make me many things, but sleepy is not one of them.

160
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:52,920
- We give you top secret massage.
- Yes, top secret massage, baby!

161
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,680
Sorry about that, I swear to God, that never happens.

162
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,480
Yes, hold on a tick.

163
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,820
Okay, now where were we, baby?

164
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,450
Ah, Austin. I'm sorry to interrupt.

165
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,870
Twins, Basil. Twins.

166
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,870
Austin, it's your father.

167
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,670
- What?
- He's been kidnapped.

168
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:34,840
Very heavy, man. Oh, so that's why my father wasn't at the knighting ceremony.

169
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,840
Well, no actually.

170
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,180
He was kidnapped after you were knighted.

171
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,180
He was last seen on his yatch.

172
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,980
Oh, yes. The "HMS Shag-at-sea".
- Exactly, just take a look.

173
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,440
Gentlemen fall in.

174
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,110
Austin, these men were signed to guard you father.

175
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,530
Okay, chaps, chins up, trousers down.

176
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,910
I think we may have found a clue.

177
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,750
Gold blimey! All your privates have had their privates painted gold. How bizarre.

178
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,290
Imagine, guilded tally-wackers, golden wedding-tackle, fourteen-carat trousers snakes...

179
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,170
- That's enough.
- Okay.

180
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,380
Basil, there is only one person in the world, -

181
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,220
- who truly understand the psychology of a mad man...

182
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,390
- Dr. Evil.
- Dr. Evil.

183
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,620
I've been expecting you, Mr. Powers.

184
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,870
My father is missing.

185
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,710
Yes, I've heard. How ironic.

186
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,760
You finally caught me, yet now you need me more that ever.

187
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,390
But then again, you've always needed me, haven't you Mr. Powers?

188
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,470
Remember when I told you, we are not so different you and I?

189
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,770
We are not so different you and I.

190
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,230
- See, I did say that.
- Very clever.

191
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,110
Now who has my father?

192
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,440
Oh, oh...someone have some daddy issues.

193
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,200
Nothing could be my father from the truth.

194
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,200
- You said my father.
- No, I didn't.

195
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,410
Didn't, did not.

196
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,750
For me this is a dad issue.

197
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,130
Daddy love me.

198
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,720
It seems the knighting ceremony wasn't the only time your... -

199
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,010
- daddy let you down.

200
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,020
Remember that day at the academy? Think!

201
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,810
It was graduation.

202
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,820
Yeah, baby, yeah. Do I make you horny, baby?

203
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,870
That, that's the spot. Right there.

204
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,330
Have you ever heard of knocking, man?

205
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,380
- Right!
- We were just getting started.

206
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,470
Don't forget, Mr. Powers, may tell you about the brief oral exam.

207
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:28,470
When I have the bit, it's mostly oral, and not too...brief, baby.

208
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,980
You know, brief and oral exam.

209
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,950
It looks like Master Evil is the top-contender for this year's International Man of Mystery.

210
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,820
He's number one in the class.

211
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,910
Hey, everybody, I'm Number 1.

212
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,420
Hello, I'm Number 2.

213
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,790
Nice to meet you Number 2.

214
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,050
But, now I'm going to be named this year's International Man of Mystery.

215
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,560
Who throws a cup cake? Honestly?

216
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:27,450
And now it's time for award of greatest honour. This year's International Man of Mystery is...

217
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,080
- Austin Powers!
- Well done Austin.

218
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,050
It has always been my dream to win this award just like my dad.

219
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,140
Glad he could be here.

220
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,480
Stand up, dad. Take a bow.

221
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,940
Dad?

222
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,960
I had the best grades in the class, and I didn't get diddly squat.

223
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,760
- Here we go.
- Tell me Mr. Powers.

224
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:30,220
What did you find on those sailors? A golden surprise? Perhaps?

225
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:37,100
How did...yes...all the sailors had their meat and two vege painted gold.

226
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,360
Yes, it's the distinctive calling card of a criminal master mind.

227
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,520
The abli named...

228
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,240
Goldmember.

229
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,870
How can I find this Goldmember?

230
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,700
Quid pro quo, Mr Powers.

231
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,370
Yes, squid pro row.

232
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,800
I'll give you Goldmember. You give me a transfer to a regular prison.

233
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,760
So that I could be with my beloved Mini-Me.

234
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,890
Okay. I'll get you a transfer to a regular prison. Now where's Goldmember?

235
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,720
Not where Mr. Powers, -

236
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,390
- but when.

237
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,980
1975 'Studio 69' Disco. New York City. Corner 69 and 8th.

238
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,730
You go now, Mr. Powers. Fly fly.

239
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,450
I'll get it.

240
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,380
Instead of hiding your father in some remote location. Goldmember's hiding in 1975.

241
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,300
So our engineers has crafted this vehicle, -

242
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,140
- to time travel to the 70s.

243
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:01,730
- Smashing, Basil. A pimp mobile.
- Yes, yes, I knew it would tickle your fancy.

244
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,860
What can I say? Look. Cough...

245
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,900
Here we go, 1975.

246
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,200
Good luck, Austin.

247
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,200
1975, yeah baby, yeah!

248
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,120
Good evening, everybody. And welcome to Studio 69.

249
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,540
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen, Goldmember.

250
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,510
Everybody, I'm from Holland! Isn't that wierd?

251
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,890
Well. If it isn't Austin Powers.

252
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:26,930
I'm sorry?

253
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,350
You got a lot of nerve, jagging your jive white ass in here.

254
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,270
I don't belive we have met.

255
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,360
It's me Foxxy. Foxxy Cleopatra.

256
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,280
Long time no see.

257
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,700
Stop!

258
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,280
We can't be seen talking to each other. You dig?

259
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,370
I'm using this cat as a distration.

260
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,790
I get it, yes, very clever.

261
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,750
First things first.

262
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,010
Eight years and no phonecall? Nobody stands up Foxxy Cleopatra!

263
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,260
Where have you been?

264
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,640
Listen Foxxy. I just want you to know I never intended to hurt you, baby.

265
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:13,190
Well, all I know is. Momma only got a taste of honey.
But she wanted the whole beehive.

266
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:21,610
- Oh, beehive!
- You always knew how to make me smile.

267
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:26,200
Well you know it's a gift really, I...what am I doing?

268
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,870
Foxxy, what are you doing i Goldmember's club?

269
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,250
I'm undercover.

270
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,830
About a year ago, my partner at the bureau was killed.

271
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,670
And that jive-ass turkey, Goldmember is the prime suspect.

272
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,430
Your father is in the back room -

273
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,800
- under heavy guard.

274
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,640
Thanks Foxxy.

275
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Austin, good luck.

276
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,700
Dad!

277
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,240
Hello son. Just overpowering my guards.

278
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,870
I'm here to rescue you. Come quickly!

279
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:16,040
I got a better idea. Why don't you rescue me in about...what seven or eight minuts?

280
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,800
Knock it off.

281
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,300
I don't wanna see my dad on the job. Come on let's go.

282
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,640
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry girls. I gotta...

283
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,180
What's wrong with your neck?

284
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,060
I took a Viagra, it got stuck in my throat and I've had a stiff neck for hours.

285
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,740
Listen, dad, if you are gonna talk about naughty things infront of these American girls.

286
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,150
Then at least speak english-english.

287
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,990
All right, my son.

288
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,020
God, that was good times, son.

289
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,330
Welcome to 1975, Austin Powers and fassia.

290
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,630
Excuse me, while I change, the hola boogie has made me sweaty.

291
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,380
You see Mr. Powers.

292
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,220
I love gold.

293
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,970
The look of it, the taste of it, the smell of it, the texture...

294
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,520
I love gold so much -

295
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,020
- that I even lost my genitalier -

296
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,190
- in an unfortunate smelting accident.

297
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,110
Hence the name...Goldmember.

298
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,870
We're both swingers, you see?

299
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,250
You have a toite body.

300
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,420
Yesh, I see that from your toite bands.

301
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,800
Yesh, you are toite like a toiger!

302
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,170
Would you like a shmoke and a pancake?

303
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:27,800
A what?

304
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,300
A shmoke and a pancake?

305
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,350
You, know. flapjack and a cigarette?

306
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,930
Hm? All right. Shigar and a waffle? No?

307
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,140
Pipe and a crepe? No?

308
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,350
Bong and a blintz?

309
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,270
Oh, well. Then there is no pleasing you.

310
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,690
That's not right.

311
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,240
Uh, hello, what have we here?

312
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,950
That's a keeper, yesh. Put it in the skin-box, please.

313
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm peeling.

314
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,410
Oh, that's just disgusting.

315
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,250
Quickly, quickly, thank you.

316
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,410
Save me for myself.

317
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,790
You're insane Goldmember!

318
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,090
"And that's the away, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it."

319
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,260
K.C. and the Sunshine Band.

320
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,140
Alright, Goldmember. Don't play the laughing boy.

321
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,010
There are only two things, I can't stand in this world:

322
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,730
People who are intolerant of other people's cultures.

323
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,850
And the Dutch.

324
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,770
What?

325
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,780
Take the fassia away.

326
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,660
Dutch-hater. And now it is time to say goodbye.

327
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,780
Dr. Evil's orders.

328
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,620
"Which for you is bad news, bears."

329
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,830
Walter Matthau.

330
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,670
Sha-zam! Up yours jive-turkey.

331
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:45,960
Traitor!

332
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,340
Here's the gun, point it at him.

333
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,760
2002!

334
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,930
- They're taking my father to the time machine.
- You say what-machine?

335
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,550
Come on now.

336
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,640
This way, sugar!

337
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,110
That was close Foxxy, I owe you one.

338
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,490
Austin, I found this in Goldmember's office.

339
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,330
- It's a microfilm, maybe a clue.
- Smashing.

340
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,540
I wanna go to the future with you.

341
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,160
We can catch Goldmember together. I owe it to my partner.

342
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,250
I should warn you Foxxy, 2002 is very different.

343
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,040
Well, the future better get ready for me.

344
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,380
Because I'm Foxxy Cleopatra.

345
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,420
And I'm a whole lotta woman!

346
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,720
2002, here we come!

347
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,480
All visitations limited five minuts.

348
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,320
No spitting in the visitors room.

349
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,490
Herr Doctor. I have some news.

350
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,080
It's your son.

351
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,580
- He wants to take over the family business.
- Scotty does?

352
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,670
- He's gotten so evil he's even started losing his hair.
- I know, it's sweet.

353
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,840
Oh, he just wants to make you proud, Herr Doctor.

354
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,630
After all it's hard on the boy not having a father.

355
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:20,390
You know. First you were frozen, then you were in space, now you're in jail.

356
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,520
Don't tell me he feels neglected.

357
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,520
I was adopted by freakin' Belgians.

358
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,350
You were adopted?

359
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,480
I never met my birth parents.

360
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,440
There was a car accident.

361
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,360
I'm told that it was a beautiful Belgium day.

362
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:40,950
The smell of waffles and brussels sprout filled the summer air...until...

363
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,660
My birthmother was incinerated.

364
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,000
I only survived because of her smoking carcass -

365
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,130
- formed a protective coocoon of slaughtered human effluence.

366
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,470
A Belgium man and his 15-year old love slave with wet feet -

367
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:59,050
- was looting the accident scene, they come across a bloodsoaked baby...moi!

368
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,970
They raised me to be evil. You know, that old chestnut.

369
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,310
Ja.

370
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,310
But nothing compares to this.

371
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,810
Being inside the belly of the beast, night after night all alone...

372
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,440
Daddy's all pant up, let's freak.

373
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,420
Times up!

374
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,010
Visitings hours are over. Get to the line.

375
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,010
Cuffs up!

376
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,260
Move it!

377
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,310
Hi there. How are you sleeping? Good?

378
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,990
Gentlemen, listen up, ya'll.

379
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,450
Here's the new plan.

380
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,070
You're gonna start a riot.

381
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,040
And we're gonna walk out the front door.

382
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:13,130
Hey man, I know guys on crack that makes more sense than you.

383
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,670
Really?

384
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,590
Then let me put it to you this way, 'coz...

385
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:45,340
Alright, listen up! Tonight 8 PM you're gonna start a riot.

386
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,470
Yes, Dr. Evil!

387
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,470
Attention all guards. There is a riot in progress.

388
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,060
Seal all exits!

389
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,310
Attention, Dr. Evil and his clone are trying to escape.

390
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,570
All guards report to cell block A immediately...

391
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,880
There you are. Good morning, sunshine.

392
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,960
Good morning.

393
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,250
How did you sleep?

394
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,380
- Great!
- Me too.

395
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,130
If these lips could talk.

396
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,340
Oh, hello.

397
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,640
You have the right to remain sexy, sugar.

398
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,060
Oh, I hope there's a search involved.

399
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,350
You got mail.

400
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,480
So, what does this thing do?

401
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,860
Well, it's called the Internet.

402
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,150
It complete revolutionize the way we live and access vital information.

403
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,740
For example, have a look at this.

404
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,830
- Now that's vital information!
- I know it's amazing.

405
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:07,260
- Oh, Basil, what's happening, baby?
- A lot is happening Foxxy.

406
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,300
Dr. Evil has escaped.

407
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:14,970
The good news is one of our agents has managed to infiltrate
Dr. Evil's organization.

408
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,190
Excellent, Basil we have been tried for years, to get a mole inside Dr. Evil's lair.

409
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,230
- We now have that mole.
- Yes.

410
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,530
Ah, and here he is.

411
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,150
So, you're the...

412
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,660
Mo...mo...mo...

413
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,710
Most...most...most excellent agent we've ever seen.

414
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,380
Yes, the most excellent agent we've ever seen. Thank you.

415
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,250
Thank you.

416
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,630
Now I wasn't able to get the exact location.

417
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,590
But I did learn that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair outside Tokyo, Japan.

418
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,810
By the way I realize that I have a large mole on my face.

419
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,980
Where? What? Where's that mole? I didn't see one.

420
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,280
I also realize the ironi, that I am myself...a mole.

421
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,070
No one would make that connection.

422
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,330
Anyway...well done, old chap. Jolly good work.

423
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,540
Nice to mole you...meet you!

424
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,170
- Nice to meet you, Mole! Don't say mole.
- Stop!

425
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,340
- I said mole.
- Stop!

426
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,470
- Bye
- Mole!

427
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,350
Mole!

428
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,640
Mole!

429
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,190
Oh, shut up!

430
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,980
Moley, moley, moley, moley, moley!

431
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,210
Up periscope.

432
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,380
Ladies and gentlemen.

433
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,340
Welcome to my new submarine lair.

434
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,510
It's long and hard, and full of seamen.

435
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,310
Nothing?

436
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,020
No?

437
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,110
Not even a titter?

438
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,980
Tough sub.

439
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:33,780
- Dr. Evil, You look very toit! Yesh, toit like a toiger! Yesh Yesh Yesh!
- Really?

440
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,160
Yesh, you look like a "macho-man".

441
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,700
Village People.

442
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,660
You know, Goldmember?

443
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,790
I don't think that's something one dude should say to another dude!

444
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,620
Yeah! A little creepy!

445
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,920
Ooh yesh! Yesh yesh yesh yesh! This is a keeper!

446
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,140
Alright... you're not going to put that skin in your mouth, are you?

447
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,890
You did... ok... that's just gross!

448
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,640
Yesh, salty! Yesh that was good!

449
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,100
Ladies and gentlemen.

450
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,440
As you know.

451
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,780
We've been designing a "tractorbeam".

452
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,070
Code name Preparation H.

453
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,700
It's powerful enough to pull the meteor..."Midas 22".

454
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,240
Into a collision course with the Earth, -

455
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,910
- upon entering the atmosphere the hot ball of magma.

456
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,420
Will strike and melt the polar icecaps, causing a global flood.

457
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,010
But enough of my technical mumbo-jumbo.

458
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,670
Allow me to demonstrate.

459
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:39,970
Lower the globe.

460
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,310
Lower the globe!

461
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,350
Av, av...

462
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,640
Scheisse.

463
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,020
Well, congratulations numb nuts... -

464
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,030
- you've succeeded in turning me into a frickin' Jack in the box!

465
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,070
Get it off. Get it off! It's dark. It's dark.

466
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,160
I'm okay, I'm okay.

467
00:42:59,051 --> 00:43:00,551
Release the meteor.

468
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:02,391
Release the meteor!

469
00:43:08,101 --> 00:43:09,231
No way!

470
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:11,061
Right in the kanickies!

471
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:12,311
God dammit!

472
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:15,361
Guys!

473
00:43:16,151 --> 00:43:17,491
Way to go a-hole!

474
00:43:17,951 --> 00:43:21,781
All right hold on, let me try to find my balls for God's sakes!

475
00:43:21,781 --> 00:43:25,541
One, two... and three, okay. I'm okay!

476
00:43:26,701 --> 00:43:30,501
Dr. Evil, we still have the ultimate insurances policy.

477
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:34,631
May I present to you the very sexual, the very toite.

478
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:38,341
Austin Powers fassia.

479
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:39,931
His what?

480
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:41,641
His fassia Dr. Evil.

481
00:43:41,931 --> 00:43:42,931
His ferder?

482
00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:47,521
- What's a ferder?
-His fassia! You know, the fassia.

483
00:43:47,981 --> 00:43:51,351
Yeah Goldmember, I dont speak freaky-deaky dutch.

484
00:43:51,811 --> 00:43:53,111
Okay perv boy?

485
00:43:53,111 --> 00:43:55,271
Fassia, his dad, dad is fassia.

486
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:58,651
Oh his dad, oh his FATHER.

487
00:43:58,941 --> 00:44:00,201
Yes, that's the right accent.

488
00:44:00,531 --> 00:44:01,411
Isn't that wierd.

489
00:44:01,951 --> 00:44:03,571
Father, father.

490
00:44:04,321 --> 00:44:08,161
- Ah, Nigel Powers.
- Hello, hello.

491
00:44:11,921 --> 00:44:13,001
Bring him to me!

492
00:44:13,001 --> 00:44:15,211
Easy peasy lemon squeezy!

493
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:19,721
Put the guns down. Is this the first day on the job or something?

494
00:44:19,721 --> 00:44:23,341
Look, this is how it goes... You attack me one at a time.

495
00:44:23,681 --> 00:44:26,561
And I knock you out in a single punch. Okay, go!

496
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:28,471
Oh, he's good.

497
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:31,391
Do you know who I am?

498
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:36,061
Have you any idea how many anonymous henchmen I've killed over the years?

499
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:38,691
And look at you. You haven't even got a name tag.

500
00:44:38,691 --> 00:44:39,991
You got no chance!

501
00:44:40,781 --> 00:44:41,821
Why don't you just fall down?

502
00:44:45,531 --> 00:44:48,951
Alright, Dr. Evil give yourself up, while you still got a chance.

503
00:44:51,081 --> 00:44:54,001
Okay, okay. You got me.

504
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:58,381
Nigel Powers, meet...Mini-Me.

505
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:00,761
Oh, blimey. I though I smelled cabbage.

506
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:02,881
Take hime away!

507
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:07,051
Dr. Evil, can I paint his yoo-hoo gold?

508
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:09,351
It's kindda my thing, you know?

509
00:45:15,941 --> 00:45:19,151
How about no, you crazy Dutch bastard!

510
00:45:21,611 --> 00:45:25,701
Attention henchmen. It's health week. Don't forget your physical. Dr. Evil's orders.

511
00:45:30,871 --> 00:45:33,081
You know, I think it's a shame the way they treat you.

512
00:45:33,871 --> 00:45:35,871
Just because you're one-eight their size.

513
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:39,461
Doesn't mean you deserve one-eight of their respect.

514
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:45,801
Mini fella. I'm...I'm curious.

515
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:50,561
Is everything in proportion.

516
00:45:52,101 --> 00:45:53,351
You know your bobby dangler, -

517
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:55,021
your general, two colonels.

518
00:45:55,021 --> 00:45:57,311
Your giggle stick, master of ceremonies.

519
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:00,401
Yeah, don't be shy, let's have a look.

520
00:46:06,611 --> 00:46:09,201
My word! You're a tripod.

521
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:15,291
What do you feed that thing? It's like a baby's arm holding an apple.

522
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,331
The good news is. If you ever get tired.

523
00:46:19,631 --> 00:46:21,091
You can use it as a kick-stand.

524
00:46:26,631 --> 00:46:29,761
I think we both know who the real brain is behind this operation.

525
00:46:45,781 --> 00:46:48,241
Tokyo, a go go, baby, yeah!

526
00:46:50,781 --> 00:46:51,991
What's kicking, Basil?

527
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:53,741
A lot's kicking, Foxxy.

528
00:46:54,371 --> 00:46:55,121
Austin?

529
00:46:55,121 --> 00:46:59,541
One of Dr. Evil's henchmen has been spotted at the Asahi Sumo Arena.

530
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:02,501
- See there immediately.
- Thanks, Basil.

531
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:13,641
Ah, Jesus Christ, this diaper is making my nuts rub together.

532
00:47:14,141 --> 00:47:16,141
It's gonna start a fire!

533
00:47:17,181 --> 00:47:18,561
That's Fat Bastard!

534
00:47:35,371 --> 00:47:37,411
Do you know what my favorite Helen Hunt movie is?

535
00:47:37,911 --> 00:47:38,711
TWISTER!

536
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:53,051
- That's not right.
- Sure ain't.

537
00:47:53,511 --> 00:47:57,061
Are we done here? I've gotta take a crap.

538
00:47:59,481 --> 00:48:02,271
Wait a tic. Something doesn't smell right.

539
00:48:03,021 --> 00:48:04,901
And I think it's Fat Bastard.

540
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,291
You okay, Austin?

541
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:25,961
Sound as a pound, love.

542
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:31,091
I didn't have any corn!

543
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:50,281
Hey diaper-lady! Here's my diaper.

544
00:48:52,201 --> 00:48:54,361
I think I might have pinched one off to soon.

545
00:48:57,911 --> 00:48:59,871
I left a rosebud in there for you.

546
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,221
You really are a fat bastard!

547
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:15,641
You know, that hurts my feelings. I'm trying to go on a diet, you know.

548
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:18,811
The zoan. You know curbs are the enemy.

549
00:49:22,481 --> 00:49:26,401
Oh...who's your friend?

550
00:49:27,861 --> 00:49:29,981
Oh, I liked to have a go with that filly.

551
00:49:31,321 --> 00:49:32,651
Do you find me sexy?

552
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,821
Look at my titties!

553
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:37,741
Shut your mouth!

554
00:49:40,741 --> 00:49:42,041
Alright, that's enough!

555
00:49:42,661 --> 00:49:46,171
- Okay, you got me, put it there, would you?
- Okay.

556
00:49:51,801 --> 00:49:52,801
Come here, you!

557
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:56,341
Oh, my titties!

558
00:49:56,931 --> 00:49:58,601
You give me a nipple!

559
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:05,481
I've got you now!

560
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:08,441
Come here you!

561
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:18,451
Prepare for the ultimate wire-fighting manoeuvre!

562
00:50:19,871 --> 00:50:23,581
I just hope my wire-fighting team is ready!

563
00:50:43,021 --> 00:50:47,231
- Cranky!
- Oh, great, isn't this magical?

564
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:49,151
One of my wires broke.

565
00:50:56,781 --> 00:50:57,991
Your under arrest, sugar!

566
00:51:00,701 --> 00:51:04,041
Okay, Fat Bastard, who's the Japanese cat you make a exchange with?

567
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:08,371
All right. His name is Roboto.

568
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:11,171
He owns Roboto Industries.

569
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:15,801
He's designing some contraption for Dr. Evil...I don't know...

570
00:51:16,091 --> 00:51:17,421
- The tractorbeam.
- The tractorbeam.

571
00:51:17,761 --> 00:51:18,511
That's it!

572
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:21,971
Listen, do you honestly think that crime can pay?

573
00:51:22,721 --> 00:51:25,271
Well, to be honest with you, I've been trying to go legit.

574
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:29,311
I really take my sumo wrestling seriously, you know.

575
00:51:30,481 --> 00:51:32,651
But when you are an overweight child.

576
00:51:33,731 --> 00:51:36,651
In this society that demands perfection.

577
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:42,491
Like your sense of right, wrong, fair and unfair.

578
00:51:44,531 --> 00:51:47,251
We'll always be tragically scud.

579
00:51:53,381 --> 00:51:55,381
Did you just soil yourself?

580
00:51:56,131 --> 00:51:57,171
Maybe.

581
00:51:58,471 --> 00:52:01,841
It did sound a little wet, didn't it, right in the end, uhh...

582
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:03,761
Let's have a smell, alright.

583
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:06,811
Wafting, wafting.

584
00:52:06,811 --> 00:52:09,941
Well, everyone likes there own brand, don't they? This is magic!

585
00:52:10,691 --> 00:52:11,981
Alright, analysis.

586
00:52:13,061 --> 00:52:15,191
Smells like carrots and throw up.

587
00:52:16,151 --> 00:52:17,901
That could gag a maggot!

588
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:22,321
Smells like hot, sick arse and a dead carcass.

589
00:52:23,661 --> 00:52:26,291
Even stink would say that that stinks!

590
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:28,791
You know when you go to the apartment building, -

591
00:52:29,251 --> 00:52:31,751
- and you smell others people's cookin' on each floor, -

592
00:52:31,751 --> 00:52:33,211
- and you go: "What are they cookin'".

593
00:52:33,211 --> 00:52:35,041
That, plus crap!

594
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:46,351
- Hey pa!
- Hey Scotty! How you been sport...

595
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:49,771
I got you a present.

596
00:52:50,231 --> 00:52:51,101
Really?

597
00:52:51,641 --> 00:52:52,391
Open the tank.

598
00:52:52,391 --> 00:52:53,351
Open the tank!

599
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:04,161
Are those sharks with laserbeams attached to their heads?

600
00:53:08,911 --> 00:53:09,831
Cool!

601
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:14,251
You mean I actually have fricken' sharks with fricken' laser beams
attached to their fricken' heads?

602
00:53:15,631 --> 00:53:17,251
You're the best evil son an evil dad could ever ask for.

603
00:53:21,471 --> 00:53:22,301
I love you, dad.

604
00:53:26,141 --> 00:53:27,141
I love you, son.

605
00:53:29,011 --> 00:53:29,681
Starting moment...

606
00:53:30,471 --> 00:53:32,481
Scotty! Come here.

607
00:53:33,941 --> 00:53:35,941
Pop a squat, right next to daddy!

608
00:53:38,571 --> 00:53:42,071
Mini-Me, move down the bench.

609
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:46,411
There's a power struggle.

610
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:54,081
Scotty's on fire!

611
00:53:56,381 --> 00:53:58,171
Alright, it's getting crowded in here.

612
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:00,301
Everyone out, everyone out, come on!

613
00:54:00,881 --> 00:54:01,631
Not you, Scotty.

614
00:54:01,841 --> 00:54:02,671
Not you, Number 2.

615
00:54:02,671 --> 00:54:03,471
Not you, Frau.

616
00:54:03,471 --> 00:54:04,421
Not you, Goldmember.

617
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:06,131
Not you guys back there.

618
00:54:06,471 --> 00:54:08,141
Not you henchman holding wrench.

619
00:54:08,801 --> 00:54:12,681
Not you henchman arbitrarily turning knobs making it seam like your doing something.

620
00:54:25,821 --> 00:54:27,111
This is uncomfortable!

621
00:54:28,241 --> 00:54:29,911
The tiny one can't take a hint.

622
00:54:31,871 --> 00:54:34,041
He doesn't understand, He's small.

623
00:54:52,261 --> 00:54:54,181
Hello Foxxy. Austin.

624
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:57,691
We've comfirmed what Fat Bastard told you about Roboto is accurate.

625
00:54:57,981 --> 00:55:01,111
He was hired by Dr. Evil to contruct Preparation H.

626
00:55:01,861 --> 00:55:05,241
So Roboto had the technology to build Goldmember's tractorbeam.

627
00:55:05,741 --> 00:55:07,741
Which means Roboto will lead us to Goldmember.

628
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:09,871
Which means Goldmember will lead us to my father.

629
00:55:31,721 --> 00:55:33,851
- You speak Japanese?
- A little.

630
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:36,981
Well you might be a cunning linguist, but I'm a master debator.

631
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:42,561
I'm looking for my father. He was kidnapped.

632
00:55:48,151 --> 00:55:49,571
Please eat what?

633
00:55:50,201 --> 00:55:55,831
Wait. He said: "Please eat some shitake mushrooms."

634
00:55:56,501 --> 00:56:07,051
Tell me. What do you know about...s...my father's where...about...s.

635
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:15,311
You're ass is happy?

636
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:17,061
No!

637
00:56:19,351 --> 00:56:22,691
He said: "Your assignment is an unhappy one".

638
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:28,611
Nice potty-mouth, dirtbag.

639
00:56:34,911 --> 00:56:38,081
Yes. Quite off topic, thank you very much.

640
00:56:38,371 --> 00:56:40,161
Why don't I just speak in English?

641
00:56:41,871 --> 00:56:43,671
That would be a good idea, now wouldn't it?

642
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:45,791
That way I wouldn't miss-read the subtitles -

643
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:48,211
- making you it seem like you're saying that are dirty.

644
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:52,591
I'm sorry to hear about your father. But I can't help you.

645
00:56:54,641 --> 00:56:55,301
Please excuse me.

646
00:56:55,761 --> 00:56:56,641
I have another appointment.

647
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:03,811
By the way...

648
00:57:09,691 --> 00:57:11,151
Mr. Roboto is lying to us.

649
00:57:11,741 --> 00:57:12,951
Tell me something I don't know.

650
00:57:12,951 --> 00:57:14,361
I open-mouth kissed a horse once.

651
00:57:14,911 --> 00:57:16,491
- Say-what?
- That's something you don't know.

652
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:19,621
My spider-senses tells me that my father is still in this building.

653
00:57:20,201 --> 00:57:22,541
You keep a look out. I'm gonna try to sneak in.

654
00:59:33,841 --> 00:59:34,671
Sha-zam!

655
00:59:35,881 --> 00:59:36,591
Come on, sugar.

656
00:59:42,431 --> 00:59:43,851
There is Goldmember and Roboto.

657
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:48,101
Yesh. Very impressive put Preparation H into my stooping transporten.

658
00:59:52,401 --> 00:59:54,321
You need this to tone the tractorbeam.

659
00:59:54,731 --> 00:59:55,731
It's a gold key.

660
00:59:58,701 --> 00:59:59,451
Smarty pants.

661
01:00:00,241 --> 01:00:00,951
Let's spread out.

662
01:00:06,791 --> 01:00:07,871
Hands up, Goldmember!

663
01:00:08,161 --> 01:00:09,291
It's payback time.

664
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:12,041
Sure you can kill me.

665
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:15,841
But then, what happens to Austin Powers' fassia?

666
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:25,391
Dad!

667
01:00:25,391 --> 01:00:28,931
Yesh! And now he's going to have an unfortunate smelting accident.

668
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:40,991
Don't worry dad! I'm here to rescue you.

669
01:00:42,031 --> 01:00:45,371
May I point out, that last time around you fell into to an obvious trap.

670
01:00:45,371 --> 01:00:48,001
Now your're trying to save me instead of stopping Goldmember.

671
01:00:48,001 --> 01:00:50,621
Please, I'm not gonna let Goldmember get away!

672
01:00:51,211 --> 01:00:52,921
Austin, Goldmember is getting away.

673
01:00:59,421 --> 01:01:02,681
Hello, hello, aren't you gonna introduce us Austin?

674
01:01:03,391 --> 01:01:04,141
Foxxy, this is...

675
01:01:04,141 --> 01:01:05,681
Powers. Nigel Powers.

676
01:01:06,721 --> 01:01:08,561
Is that Eau de Fleuratia your wearing?

677
01:01:08,851 --> 01:01:09,601
Yes, it is.

678
01:01:10,431 --> 01:01:11,811
That's how a woman should smell.

679
01:01:12,561 --> 01:01:14,061
Especially one as beautiful as you.

680
01:01:14,401 --> 01:01:18,281
My my...even in the face of danger you live up to your reputation.

681
01:01:21,191 --> 01:01:22,031
Get on with it!

682
01:01:26,701 --> 01:01:27,741
I got an idea.

683
01:01:33,081 --> 01:01:34,631
Your spycar is a mini.

684
01:01:34,631 --> 01:01:35,831
It's not the size mate.

685
01:01:36,591 --> 01:01:37,671
It's how you use it.

686
01:02:01,241 --> 01:02:03,151
You know I would have found my way out, very well.

687
01:02:03,401 --> 01:02:05,111
What? I saved your life!

688
01:02:05,111 --> 01:02:05,571
Listen.

689
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:06,701
Should have been doing your job!

690
01:02:06,701 --> 01:02:07,911
Oh, your welcome, mate.

691
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:09,621
Shut up and turn around, please!

692
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:40,981
Run! It's Godzilla!

693
01:02:40,981 --> 01:02:42,191
It looks like Godzilla.

694
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,571
But due to International Copyright Laws...it's not.

695
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:47,111
Still we should run, like it is Godzilla!

696
01:02:47,531 --> 01:02:48,161
Though it isn't.

697
01:02:54,331 --> 01:02:55,211
There is Goldmember.

698
01:03:02,301 --> 01:03:06,011
Greater-greater one-niner, this is Goldie-van. Over.

699
01:03:06,341 --> 01:03:10,141
10-4 there, Goldie-van this is Rubber-ducky, what's your ten-twenty? Over.

700
01:03:10,641 --> 01:03:16,481
I've got Preparation H in rear and smoke
in the barrel of my backdoor... Viva las convoy. Over.

701
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:20,231
Yee-haa. Copy that you son-of-a-bitch powder of monkeynuts.

702
01:03:21,441 --> 01:03:25,321
Open wide there Rubber-ducky, I'm entering your mouth now. Over.

703
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:34,911
Great, Goldmember got away.

704
01:03:35,501 --> 01:03:36,041
Now what?

705
01:03:36,331 --> 01:03:39,421
I think it's obvious, we should take Dr. Evil's lair by force.

706
01:03:39,421 --> 01:03:41,671
- You can be my backup, son.
- Backup?

707
01:03:42,131 --> 01:03:43,671
Well that's fairly condescending.

708
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:46,381
Do you think Dr. Evil's is gonna expect an attack?

709
01:03:46,381 --> 01:03:48,131
We should infiltrate his lair.

710
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:51,051
It's aint my first rodeo, cowboy.

711
01:03:51,051 --> 01:03:54,931
We need commandos, scuba...gadgets for god-sake.

712
01:03:55,351 --> 01:03:56,931
Well, I don't like to use gadgets.

713
01:03:57,851 --> 01:04:00,021
Outside the bedroom, I thank you...

714
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:07,361
You know. I think being frozen, damaged your brain.

715
01:04:08,451 --> 01:04:10,281
Really? And how would you know?

716
01:04:10,991 --> 01:04:15,831
This is the most time we ever spent together, since...ever!

717
01:04:16,411 --> 01:04:17,701
What are you saying, son?

718
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:21,331
What boy learned to drive a car with machineguns on it?

719
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,791
Or had a helicopter you could fit in a nutsack?

720
01:04:25,001 --> 01:04:27,051
What about you Swedish nanny, Helga?

721
01:04:28,421 --> 01:04:29,761
Oh, yes, Helga!

722
01:04:29,761 --> 01:04:31,551
Let's say I didn't hire her for the cooking.

723
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:34,971
She stayed on, until you were 24.

724
01:04:36,851 --> 01:04:38,231
We were mates you and I.

725
01:04:38,481 --> 01:04:39,731
I didn't need a friend.

726
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:41,731
I needed a father.

727
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:44,861
You know I have risked my life trying to save you.

728
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:47,281
And you still don't give me any respect.

729
01:04:47,571 --> 01:04:49,441
Respect? Come on.

730
01:04:49,781 --> 01:04:52,111
If you got an issue, here's your tissue.

731
01:04:59,871 --> 01:05:02,291
That is not funny.

732
01:05:02,921 --> 01:05:06,131
Well, I suppose we better go our seperate ways then?

733
01:05:08,301 --> 01:05:09,261
Fine.

734
01:05:12,761 --> 01:05:13,801
Fine.

735
01:05:25,441 --> 01:05:28,651
So. I've been assigned to welcome you to the Ministry of Defense.

736
01:05:28,651 --> 01:05:31,651
I have a letter from my director personally thanking you for switching sides.

737
01:05:38,911 --> 01:05:42,501
I...can't wait to inform Austin of your defection.

738
01:05:47,671 --> 01:05:48,961
Oh. Hello Basil.

739
01:05:49,711 --> 01:05:51,051
Yes, Austin should be here any second.

740
01:05:53,181 --> 01:05:54,681
Yes, I'm in Austin's hotel room right now.

741
01:06:04,101 --> 01:06:05,101
Assasin!

742
01:06:09,151 --> 01:06:10,441
Try to kill me will ya?

743
01:06:13,861 --> 01:06:15,611
Oh. You wanna be friends, huh?

744
01:06:17,281 --> 01:06:18,411
Wait a tick.

745
01:06:23,081 --> 01:06:24,621
I'm not falling for that again!

746
01:06:34,471 --> 01:06:35,681
But, at least he didn't mention it.

747
01:06:36,721 --> 01:06:37,891
Yes, I realize he can't talk.

748
01:06:39,391 --> 01:06:41,221
Listen I think Dr. Evil treated him badly.

749
01:06:41,221 --> 01:06:42,811
And that's why he has decided to help us.

750
01:06:49,191 --> 01:06:50,731
Come back here, you little bugger.

751
01:06:56,821 --> 01:06:59,121
Oh, yes. I'm sure Austin and Mini-Me, will get along famously.

752
01:07:01,201 --> 01:07:03,411
I guarantee nothing will happen to Mini-Me in my watch.

753
01:07:08,581 --> 01:07:10,841
Come here you bugger, I got ya.

754
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:17,051
Oh, I think he and Austin will be united -

755
01:07:17,051 --> 01:07:19,551
- in their commitment to the mission of stopping Dr. Evil.

756
01:07:25,231 --> 01:07:26,771
Austin. There you are.

757
01:07:27,061 --> 01:07:28,151
I have come to tell you the good news.

758
01:07:32,941 --> 01:07:33,821
Mini-Me has...

759
01:07:35,691 --> 01:07:36,451
- switched sides.

760
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:41,951
Sorry about that, old chap.

761
01:07:44,871 --> 01:07:45,791
Welcome aboard.

762
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:48,501
My mole-stake.

763
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:50,041
What was that?

764
01:07:51,211 --> 01:07:53,301
Listen. Just get it out of you system.

765
01:07:53,301 --> 01:07:55,091
- No I'm fine.
- I insist.

766
01:07:55,091 --> 01:07:56,471
We could work together better if you just...

767
01:07:56,471 --> 01:07:57,261
Mole!

768
01:07:57,261 --> 01:07:58,431
Bloody mole!

769
01:07:58,431 --> 01:08:00,301
We are not supposed to talk about the bloody mole, -

770
01:08:00,301 --> 01:08:02,641
- but there's a bloody mole winking me in the face!

771
01:08:02,641 --> 01:08:04,561
I'm gonna chop it off, and cut it off.

772
01:08:04,561 --> 01:08:06,481
And make some guacamole!

773
01:08:09,061 --> 01:08:09,981
- Better?
- Yeah.

774
01:08:25,621 --> 01:08:28,001
So you decided to join us, huh, Mini-Me?

775
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:30,961
And welcome to the good side, my mini-brother.

776
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:33,211
And thank you for the map for Dr. Evil's sub.

777
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:36,761
What's this?

778
01:08:36,761 --> 01:08:39,631
It says: "Dr. Evil's tractorbeam is now complete" -

779
01:08:39,631 --> 01:08:42,931
- "there is not much time. Dr. Evil must pay!"

780
01:08:47,641 --> 01:08:48,771
"You are so beautiful."

781
01:08:49,641 --> 01:08:51,231
"Are you a clone of an angel?"

782
01:08:52,271 --> 01:08:54,271
That is so sweet!

783
01:08:54,771 --> 01:08:56,571
But no my mini-man, I'm not.

784
01:08:59,531 --> 01:09:01,741
"Are you sure you don't have a little clone in you?"

785
01:09:03,201 --> 01:09:03,991
Yeah I'm sure.

786
01:09:04,741 --> 01:09:05,581
"Would you like to...?"

787
01:09:09,661 --> 01:09:10,791
Holy bugger!

788
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:13,131
That is so not funny.

789
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:16,501
Okay, everyone prepare to dive.

790
01:09:16,801 --> 01:09:18,801
This spycar is also a submarine.

791
01:09:34,691 --> 01:09:36,571
Get me the World Organization.

792
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:40,571
What is it, Dr. Evil?

793
01:09:40,861 --> 01:09:45,871
Gentlemen. In a matter of hours a meteor will crash into Earth causing a global flood.

794
01:09:45,871 --> 01:09:48,541
That is of course unless you pay me.

795
01:09:50,371 --> 01:09:57,091
1 billion-gezillion-fefillion...-

796
01:09:57,751 --> 01:09:59,961
- million...yen.

797
01:09:59,961 --> 01:10:01,261
I think you're bluffing.

798
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:05,591
Well perhaps you would like a demonstration? Number 2 the key, please.

799
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:30,081
Sir, Dr. Evil is not bluffing.

800
01:10:30,371 --> 01:10:32,121
One of our satellites is falling out of orbit.

801
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:33,081
Which one?

802
01:10:33,371 --> 01:10:34,751
It's the one that looks like a pair of...

803
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:38,211
Melons! Big juicy melons!

804
01:10:38,671 --> 01:10:40,131
Are they nice and ferm?

805
01:10:40,841 --> 01:10:41,841
Well, what do you think?

806
01:10:42,591 --> 01:10:43,421
Look at that!

807
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:45,221
It looks like a set of giant...

808
01:10:47,341 --> 01:10:49,811
Hey, A and N you're late. How're we doin..

809
01:10:51,221 --> 01:10:55,941
Go Titans! Check it out. Those remind me of...

810
01:10:56,351 --> 01:10:57,191
Boobs!

811
01:10:57,901 --> 01:10:58,691
Boobs, Ozzy?

812
01:10:58,981 --> 01:11:01,821
These film makers is just *BEEP* boobs!

813
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:03,491
What do you mean, dad?

814
01:11:03,491 --> 01:11:07,661
Well they use the same *BEEP* jokes, as they did in the last Austin Powers movie.

815
01:11:08,161 --> 01:11:09,531
What *BEEP* joke?

816
01:11:09,871 --> 01:11:13,331
You know the *BEEP* joke about the long smooth rocket that looks likes some guy's...

817
01:11:13,331 --> 01:11:13,911
Johnson!

818
01:11:14,831 --> 01:11:16,371
- Yes, sir?
- Any sign of that satellite?

819
01:11:17,291 --> 01:11:18,751
No, sir. It's gone.

820
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:21,921
Gentlemen, you have my demands, peace out!

821
01:11:57,371 --> 01:12:00,631
Cool, baby. You look very switched on.

822
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:02,381
Thank you, Austin.

823
01:12:06,261 --> 01:12:09,341
No Mini-Me! Off! Bad! No humping!

824
01:12:12,101 --> 01:12:14,681
Dr. Evil. In light of success of the device.

825
01:12:14,971 --> 01:12:17,311
It is japanese custom that I recieve a bonus.

826
01:12:18,981 --> 01:12:19,981
A bonus?

827
01:12:20,651 --> 01:12:22,311
That's good. Yeah.

828
01:12:23,901 --> 01:12:25,361
Throw me a freakin' bonus here!

829
01:12:29,241 --> 01:12:31,871
I haven't laughed that hard since I was a little girl, thank you!

830
01:12:33,531 --> 01:12:35,541
Oh, you're nok joking.

831
01:12:36,161 --> 01:12:38,371
No! In fact if you don't give me the bonus...

832
01:12:38,371 --> 01:12:40,461
- Hey guys!
- Hey Scotty, how are you, sport?

833
01:12:48,841 --> 01:12:50,631
- Why don't you let me take care of this?
- Okay.

834
01:13:03,691 --> 01:13:04,771
That's the evil laugh.

835
01:13:08,071 --> 01:13:08,691
Scotty!

836
01:13:09,991 --> 01:13:11,071
Scotty!

837
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:15,621
Scotty. Take it down a notch.

838
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:19,251
It's creepin' a bit.

839
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,501
Let's go.

840
01:13:25,841 --> 01:13:26,921
We will need a disguise.

841
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:30,091
There's only one uniform.

842
01:13:31,171 --> 01:13:33,261
One of us has to go, on the other one's shoulders.

843
01:13:47,191 --> 01:13:48,361
Hey there buddy how's it going?

844
01:13:48,361 --> 01:13:49,361
Good to see, ya.

845
01:13:50,241 --> 01:13:52,031
Yeah, yeah...hi!

846
01:13:57,371 --> 01:13:58,491
Hello. You alright?

847
01:13:58,831 --> 01:14:00,751
Yes it's a good hat. Very good hat.

848
01:14:02,921 --> 01:14:04,121
Come on Mini-Me, let's go.

849
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:07,791
Hold it right there, mister.

850
01:14:10,961 --> 01:14:12,971
Did you really think that you could get away with this?

851
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:15,971
I did actually, yes.

852
01:14:16,601 --> 01:14:18,681
Every new recruit must have a physical.

853
01:14:19,641 --> 01:14:20,811
Now get in here sailor.

854
01:14:21,601 --> 01:14:23,731
I'm going to need an urine sample.

855
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:27,271
Okay.

856
01:14:34,861 --> 01:14:35,741
Okay, then.

857
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:53,881
Hello.

858
01:15:00,851 --> 01:15:02,351
And here we go.

859
01:15:10,441 --> 01:15:11,441
- Terrific.
- Yes.

860
01:15:13,361 --> 01:15:18,571
Alright sailor. Go behind that screen and strip down to your skippies.

861
01:15:19,371 --> 01:15:21,491
Alright then, I'll just go to that screen.

862
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:25,251
Which is over there.

863
01:15:30,001 --> 01:15:31,211
Right behind that screen.

864
01:15:36,301 --> 01:15:38,091
Come on, hurry the map.

865
01:15:39,011 --> 01:15:39,971
Okay, what's on the map.

866
01:15:43,101 --> 01:15:45,061
I'm going to need an urine sample.

867
01:15:45,891 --> 01:15:47,441
Which way to the main chamber?

868
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:08,921
Okay. So...sure.

869
01:16:21,221 --> 01:16:22,141
Excuse me, doctor?

870
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:23,931
It's difficult in public, isn't it?

871
01:16:32,651 --> 01:16:35,111
Mini-Me, our shadows, we're casting a shadow.

872
01:16:35,111 --> 01:16:36,151
What's wrong, sailor?

873
01:16:37,281 --> 01:16:38,611
You should check that guy out!

874
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:46,951
What the hell is going on here?

875
01:16:50,371 --> 01:16:50,921
Hands up.

876
01:16:53,751 --> 01:16:55,091
You heard me, I said hands up!

877
01:16:55,751 --> 01:16:57,191
Both of you!

878
01:17:09,521 --> 01:17:10,311
Come with me!

879
01:17:10,641 --> 01:17:11,731
Mini-Me, the map. Go!

880
01:17:14,941 --> 01:17:16,611
Okay, you got me.

881
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:30,041
Are you alright, little man?

882
01:17:34,501 --> 01:17:35,171
Right on!

883
01:17:52,691 --> 01:17:53,981
Mr. Powers.

884
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:59,441
Before I kill you. Perhaps you would like to see the genius of my plan.

885
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:03,031
Key, please.

886
01:18:07,531 --> 01:18:10,451
What the? Who? But how? Where?

887
01:18:13,171 --> 01:18:14,001
Looking for this?

888
01:18:16,961 --> 01:18:17,791
Mini-Me?

889
01:18:18,131 --> 01:18:20,421
Alright, everybody, drop your guns.

890
01:18:20,421 --> 01:18:22,801
Because Foxxy Cleopatra is in the sub.

891
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:25,761
Smashing, Foxxy! Yeah!

892
01:18:31,021 --> 01:18:32,231
Alright, Dr. Evil.

893
01:18:33,021 --> 01:18:34,731
It has finally come down to this.

894
01:18:36,151 --> 01:18:39,401
You, me and the gun.

895
01:18:42,361 --> 01:18:43,821
What are you going to do now, Austin?

896
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:47,491
Dad?

897
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:49,831
What are you doing here?

898
01:18:50,951 --> 01:18:53,411
I gotta finish this off once and for all.

899
01:18:55,671 --> 01:18:57,081
I'm afraid you can't do that.

900
01:18:58,591 --> 01:19:00,001
I have to protect my son.

901
01:19:00,551 --> 01:19:01,671
Dad, I'm fine.

902
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:03,921
I'm not talking about you.

903
01:19:05,681 --> 01:19:07,801
I'm talking about...him.

904
01:19:11,811 --> 01:19:12,601
What?

905
01:19:13,731 --> 01:19:15,351
Dr. Evil is not your son.

906
01:19:15,351 --> 01:19:16,401
I am.

907
01:19:17,481 --> 01:19:19,041
You both are.

908
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:22,281
What?

909
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:26,111
It was our first...family holiday together.

910
01:19:27,411 --> 01:19:29,071
Just as I was finishing a case.

911
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,701
Your mother brought the two of you to Belgium.

912
01:19:35,661 --> 01:19:36,831
I stopped to have a tinkle.

913
01:19:37,711 --> 01:19:38,421
When the car...

914
01:19:49,721 --> 01:19:53,811
But, my parents died in a car accident.

915
01:19:54,271 --> 01:19:55,981
It was no accident.

916
01:19:56,771 --> 01:19:58,401
t was an assasination attempt.

917
01:19:59,271 --> 01:20:00,981
I though only Austin survived.

918
01:20:01,821 --> 01:20:03,731
I should have told you the truth earlier.

919
01:20:04,071 --> 01:20:07,821
But those Belgians, they made you so damn...evil.

920
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:13,041
Of course they share border with Dutch.

921
01:20:14,371 --> 01:20:17,211
Very interesting story, Mr. Powers.

922
01:20:18,211 --> 01:20:21,171
Of course, I'm gonna have to wait until I see all the facts.

923
01:20:21,591 --> 01:20:22,671
Daddy!

924
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:27,171
Daddy is here, Ducky.

925
01:20:28,721 --> 01:20:30,511
Ducky, ducky?

926
01:20:30,511 --> 01:20:32,141
Ducky remember, Ducky...?

927
01:20:32,141 --> 01:20:33,601
Dad, what's going on?

928
01:20:37,681 --> 01:20:39,021
What are you going to do Austin?

929
01:20:53,031 --> 01:20:53,951
Austin!

930
01:20:54,741 --> 01:20:56,621
Are you sure you can trust, Dr. Evil?

931
01:20:58,081 --> 01:20:59,621
He ain't heavy.

932
01:21:01,211 --> 01:21:03,751
He's my brother, baby, yeah!

933
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:08,421
I should have told you this so long ago, son.

934
01:21:10,221 --> 01:21:11,471
I'm very proud of you.

935
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:14,641
Can you forgive me?

936
01:21:15,311 --> 01:21:16,271
I forgive you dad.

937
01:21:41,421 --> 01:21:44,041
I'm Ducky! I'm Ducky!

938
01:21:57,641 --> 01:21:59,641
Oh, come on!

939
01:22:00,391 --> 01:22:02,521
I mean first I'm not evil enough for you.

940
01:22:03,101 --> 01:22:04,811
And now you're gonna turn good?

941
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:06,521
Listen, Scott.

942
01:22:07,191 --> 01:22:08,611
You can spend your whole life -

943
01:22:08,611 --> 01:22:11,821
- trying to win your parents acceptance. Believe me!

944
01:22:12,821 --> 01:22:15,951
But at the end of the day you just gotta do it for yourself, baby.

945
01:22:17,991 --> 01:22:18,831
Hey, Austin...

946
01:22:20,251 --> 01:22:21,001
What?

947
01:22:21,831 --> 01:22:22,621
I hate you.

948
01:22:23,871 --> 01:22:24,881
I hate you!

949
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:26,631
I hate you!

950
01:22:27,711 --> 01:22:30,051
I don't even know you, but I hate you too.

951
01:22:30,761 --> 01:22:32,671
And I especially hate you!

952
01:22:35,511 --> 01:22:36,261
You'll pay.

953
01:22:37,391 --> 01:22:38,721
You'll all pay!

954
01:22:43,021 --> 01:22:46,481
I'd like to point out that no one else in my gene pool runs like a girl.

955
01:22:47,401 --> 01:22:49,651
Not so fast, smarty pants!

956
01:22:50,571 --> 01:22:51,651
Dr. Evil!

957
01:22:52,281 --> 01:22:54,361
You might not want to destroy the world.

958
01:22:54,361 --> 01:22:56,571
But I do!

959
01:22:58,411 --> 01:23:01,161
Preparation H goes ahead as planned.

960
01:23:01,451 --> 01:23:03,211
I got to flood the Earth!

961
01:23:04,501 --> 01:23:05,671
Think again, Goldmember.

962
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:08,211
Huh, Foxxy Cleopatra.

963
01:23:08,631 --> 01:23:10,631
It's a shame I had to kill your partner.

964
01:23:11,131 --> 01:23:14,681
- Too bad for you.
- Too bad for me?

965
01:23:15,471 --> 01:23:17,091
How about too bad for you?

966
01:23:17,761 --> 01:23:18,721
Oh no!

967
01:23:25,691 --> 01:23:27,311
Luckily I keep a spare.

968
01:23:35,701 --> 01:23:38,911
Look everyone! My winky was a key!

969
01:23:39,371 --> 01:23:40,911
Oh dear, bloody Dutchman.

970
01:23:48,001 --> 01:23:49,211
Foxxy, I'm coming!

971
01:23:50,171 --> 01:23:53,711
Don't do anything stupid or the shooting begins.

972
01:23:53,711 --> 01:23:57,381
Austin, take Ducky I'll stay here and be your backup.

973
01:23:57,971 --> 01:23:59,091
Ducky, what do we do?

974
01:23:59,891 --> 01:24:02,641
I'm not really a "hands-on-evil-genius".

975
01:24:03,101 --> 01:24:05,101
Think you were always the smart one.

976
01:24:05,731 --> 01:24:09,731
I could re-write the output capacity to the tractorbeam -

977
01:24:09,731 --> 01:24:11,691
- from one of the conduit boxes up there.

978
01:24:12,321 --> 01:24:13,071
Come on, let's go.

979
01:24:19,701 --> 01:24:21,411
Yesh! The shooting begins.

980
01:24:25,661 --> 01:24:26,751
Let me shoot!

981
01:24:32,631 --> 01:24:35,881
You know, Dr. Evil. I used to think you were crazy.

982
01:24:36,341 --> 01:24:37,011
I know.

983
01:24:37,341 --> 01:24:40,051
But now I can see your nuts. I thank you.

984
01:24:58,611 --> 01:24:59,401
Hurry!

985
01:25:03,451 --> 01:25:06,201
Fassia, fassia, fassia, fassia, fassia.

986
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:08,501
Fassia can you here me?

987
01:25:08,751 --> 01:25:09,961
Fassia, fassia...

988
01:25:20,801 --> 01:25:22,341
Well done, Austin!

989
01:25:22,801 --> 01:25:24,511
You saved the world again.

990
01:25:27,271 --> 01:25:27,891
Thank you.

991
01:25:30,231 --> 01:25:32,521
Austin, you did it.

992
01:25:32,521 --> 01:25:33,441
We did it!

993
01:25:33,731 --> 01:25:35,071
Yeah, baby!

994
01:25:37,941 --> 01:25:39,991
No? Just trying it on.

995
01:25:42,491 --> 01:25:45,531
Goldmember, you're under arrest, sugar.

996
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:55,291
Hey assholes! Do I have time for a last smoke and a pancake or what?

997
01:25:59,971 --> 01:26:03,301
I'm from Holland! Isn't that wierd?

998
01:26:08,141 --> 01:26:10,021
Yes, well done!

999
01:26:36,381 --> 01:26:37,961
Hey Powers!

1000
01:26:41,011 --> 01:26:42,261
Fat Bastard?

1001
01:26:43,181 --> 01:26:44,591
But you are not fat anymore.

1002
01:26:45,091 --> 01:26:46,641
I'm on the subway diet.

1003
01:26:48,681 --> 01:26:50,681
I've lost a 180 pounds.

1004
01:26:51,141 --> 01:26:52,601
Congratulations, baby.

1005
01:26:52,601 --> 01:26:53,731
Thank you.

1006
01:26:53,731 --> 01:26:56,401
I do have a little bit of excess skin though.

1007
01:26:58,481 --> 01:27:01,531
But unfortunately my neck does look like a vagina.

1008
01:27:16,421 --> 01:27:17,001
Austin.

1009
01:27:18,421 --> 01:27:20,631
Thank you, for eveything.

1010
01:27:29,601 --> 01:27:30,761
Sha-zam!

1011
01:27:43,111 --> 01:27:45,071
I'm gonna get you, Austin Powers.

1012
01:28:08,051 --> 01:28:11,761
MORE TO COME...

1013
01:28:18,061 --> 01:28:20,021
Well they are using the same *BEEP* joke -

1014
01:28:20,021 --> 01:28:23,861
- as they used in the last Austin Powers film...movie...oh I'm sorry.

1015
01:28:24,441 --> 01:28:25,821
Well they are using the...the...what...

1016
01:28:26,111 --> 01:28:27,911
Well they are using the same joke, as they...

1017
01:28:30,531 --> 01:28:31,161
W...what do you mean?

1018
01:28:32,951 --> 01:28:33,911
Boobs, Ozzy?

1019
01:28:34,621 --> 01:28:35,331
Stop...

1020
01:28:38,081 --> 01:28:40,501
Oh, don't start this Kelly, don't you worry about...

1021
01:28:43,841 --> 01:28:44,461
On the mark!

1022
01:28:44,461 --> 01:28:45,091
On the mark?

1023
01:28:46,011 --> 01:28:48,381
I don't like that noise I'm getting all turned on.

1024
01:28:49,181 --> 01:28:51,221
My testeron is going dancing...

1025
01:28:52,851 --> 01:28:53,721
Get off me!

1026
01:28:58,771 --> 01:29:00,691
Is...is it true what they say about you?

1027
01:29:04,941 --> 01:29:10,241
Kickstand? Really? Can I give you my cellphone number?

1028
01:29:11,571 --> 01:29:12,411
Please?

1029
01:29:15,161 --> 01:29:17,661
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Burt Bacharach.

1030
01:30:02,421 --> 01:30:04,841
