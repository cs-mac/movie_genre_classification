1
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:51,965
Aaaaaargh!

2
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,797
This is Andy Barclay. Eight
years ago, he started the scandal

3
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:04,917
that nearly crippled this company,

4
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:10,883
claiming his Good Guy doll Chucky
Was possessed by...Charles Lee Ray,

5
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:13,441
the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.

6
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,762
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:22,924
after all the lawsuits
and negative publicity,

8
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:26,323
When the company is finally
getting back on its feet again,

9
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:30,246
Where is the Wisdom in putting
the Good Guy back on the market?

10
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:33,996
Mr Sullivan,
before any of this happened,

11
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:37,323
the Good Guy outsold
all our other toys two to one.

12
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:40,643
Even now, interest in
the marketplace is at its peak.

13
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:44,999
The factory is running again.
We should be in stores by next Week.

14
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:49,802
We cannot let the fantasies
of one disturbed boy

15
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:51,838
influence company policy.

16
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:56,836
What if the doll somehow affects
another child in a negative Way?

17
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:59,879
You could have
a public relations nightmare.

18
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:04,079
You know, one of the hardest
things about this business

19
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,925
is that it is a business.

20
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:09,765
It doesn't matter What We're selling,

21
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:14,927
Whether it's cars, nuclear Weapons,
or, yes, even toys.

22
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:17,845
The bottom line is the bottom line.

23
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:23,085
And What are children, after all,
but consumer trainees?

24
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:28,080
Andy Barclay is ancient history.

25
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:33,526
No one remembers him. Nobody cares.

26
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:39,637
I have made up my mind.

27
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,598
We're moving ahead.

28
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:43,319
Thank you.

29
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,597
(Woman) OK.
(Man) All right.

30
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:47,524
Mr Sullivan.

31
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:50,365
If there's nothing I can say
to convince you,

32
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:54,002
then I must go on record With
my position: I'm against this.

33
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,198
Your position is
crystal clear, Miles,

34
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:59,397
and you can be sure I Won't forget.

35
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:03,520
Just a minute, folks!
We have a little surprise.

36
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,876
The guys at the factory
sent this over.

37
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:09,681
It's the first one :
the Good Guy of the 90's!

38
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:29,764
Well, if there's nothing else,
I'll get going.

39
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:32,766
Fine.

40
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:35,162
(Man) It's just
my Wife's expecting me.

41
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:38,677
I  It's our anniversary.
I  Fine, Petzold.

42
00:06:38,727 --> 00:06:42,959
Well, I guess I could review
the Larabie report after dinner.

43
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:46,238
I  Good night, Mr Sullivan.
I  Good night.

44
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:16,646
Ahh.

45
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,479
'Despite a downdraught,

46
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:44,760
'stocks Were able to post a rally
thanks to a couple of factors...'

47
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,846
'In a moment...'

48
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:17,003
Uh, Where is it?

49
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:31,916
Phew!

50
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,875
Ahh!

51
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:30,286
(Doll) Hi, my name is Larry.
(Doll 2) Hi, my name is Paulie.

52
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:33,125
I  Hey, Wanna play?
I  Hey, Wanna play?

53
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,920
I  I like to be hugged.
I  I like to be hugged.

54
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:39,960
I  Hi, my name is Larry.
I  Hi, my name is Paulie.

55
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,082
Don't fuck With the Chuck!

56
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:16,563
Oh, my God.

57
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:31,366
Ahh!

58
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:33,159
Bull'sI eye!

59
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:50,836
Ahh!

60
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:15,760
Just like the good old days.

61
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:20,358
Nothing like a strangulation
to get the circulation going.

62
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:33,556
You're my only ticket
out of here, Andy.

63
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:37,282
I got to get out
of this goddamn body.

64
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:40,478
Where are you, you little shit?

65
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:49,838
(Boy) Left! Left!

66
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:55,763
InWard, hut!

67
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:10,477
(Woman) Come on. You can do it!

68
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:13,246
Come on. You can do it,
Jackson, hurry up.

69
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,800
Yeah! Move. Yes!

70
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:17,839
Come on. Let's go. Yeah! Come on.

71
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:20,401
Get moving!
Go to the end of the line!

72
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:32,526
(Man) I see that
for the past eight years

73
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,603
you've been in foster homes.

74
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:36,922
Mind if I ask Why?

75
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:40,879
They took me away from my mother.

76
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:44,363
She's, uh, under special care.

77
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:46,682
I know that.

78
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:50,322
I meant how come you never
got settled anyWhere?

79
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:55,364
Adjustment problems.

80
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:57,284
I can read, Barclay.

81
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:59,283
I'm asking you.

82
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:06,000
I never felt comfortable
With those people.

83
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:08,641
They Weren't family,
they Were strangers.

84
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,476
All right, listen up, Barclay.

85
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:18,805
I'm Willing to cut you slack
because you've had it so rough,

86
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:21,361
but you're a troublemaker.

87
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,875
And I got a real problem
With troublemakers.

88
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:26,361
They don't fit into the system.

89
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:28,523
So here's my advice.

90
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:32,559
Grow up, you're not a kid any more.

91
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,758
It's time to forget
these fantasies of killer dolls.

92
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:39,005
Yes, sir.

93
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:43,722
"When I Was a child,
I thought as a child.

94
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:49,637
"But When I became a man,
I put away childish things."

95
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,882
I Corinthians.

96
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:54,395
Look alive, Barclay, on your feet!

97
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:57,439
At Kent, We take bed Wetters
and turn them into men.

98
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:15,040
Oh, yes. Yes. Ooh, yes!

99
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:18,557
We're seeing some skin now,
aren't We?

100
00:16:21,887 --> 00:16:23,878
Presto! You're bald.

101
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,760
Always feels a little Weird at first.

102
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:37,246
Next.

103
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:42,479
(TV) 'I'll get us out of this.'

104
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:44,961
'Move it. Sit down.'

105
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:47,880
Kiss it goodbye.

106
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:56,399
You know, the Romans invented
the military cut.

107
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:58,915
-You know Why?
-Why?

108
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,685
To keep their hair short

109
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:04,686
so their enemies couldn't grab
ahold of it in battle

110
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:07,844
and slit their throat.

111
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:11,562
(Chuckling) Now, hold still.

112
00:17:11,607 --> 00:17:14,883
(TV) 'Ah, look out, there. Look out.'

113
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:20,760
Oh, shit.

114
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:27,279
(Boy on TV) 'We're back,
and We're better than ever.'

115
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,477
'No one Will play With me.'

116
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:32,837
Uh-oh. There's a friend in need.

117
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:37,077
'Hey, cheer up!'

118
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:39,846
-Who are you?
-I'm a Good Guy.

119
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,719
I've just come from the clubhouse,
and I'll be your friend.'

120
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,405
'You Will?.'

121
00:17:57,447 --> 00:17:59,039
Wow!

122
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:00,645
'Sure I Will.'

123
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:02,245
(Both) 'Hidey ho!'

124
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:04,357
'So, all aboard for high flying fun

125
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:06,762
'With me, your friend till the end,

126
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:09,605
'the Good Guy doll from Play Pal.'

127
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:13,118
(Boy) Come on, man!

128
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,524
(Thud)

129
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:56,325
Are you OK?

130
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,358
The bastards! Fucking bastards!

131
00:18:58,407 --> 00:18:59,476
What happened?

132
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:03,679
Shelton, that's What happened.
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.

133
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,524
Thank you. I'm fine.

134
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:07,922
I'm Andy.

135
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:12,597
You must be new. Otherwise you'd know
there's no individuality here.

136
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:14,444
Certainly no first names.

137
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,524
Yeah, right, I forgot. Barclay.

138
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,082
Whitehurst.
Harold Aubrey for the record.

139
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:26,644
So, uh, Who's this Shelton?

140
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:29,440
Cadet Lieutenant Colonel
Brett C Shelton.

141
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:33,605
He's God around here.
Don't expect any mercy from him.

142
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:34,636
Welcome to hell, Barclay.

143
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:47,316
-All present and accounted for.
-Thank you, Major Ellis.

144
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:20,887
You're a new boy, huh?

145
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:22,838
Yeah.

146
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:25,845
-How you doing?
-Pretty good.

147
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:31,999
Who said you could look at me?

148
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:34,163
Do you know Who I am?!

149
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:35,640
Shelton?

150
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:39,316
That's Lieutenant Colonel
Shelton to you, asshole!

151
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:40,641
(Barclay) Lieutenant Colonel Shelton.

152
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:45,317
No. Lieutenant Colonel Shelton...

153
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:49,119
..sir.

154
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:52,917
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton, sir.

155
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:55,800
What's your name, dipWeed?

156
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:57,724
Barclay.

157
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:01,358
-Sir.
-Louder.

158
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:03,284
-Sir!
-Louder!

159
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:04,646
SIR!

160
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:15,396
That's much better, new boy.
That's much better.

161
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:21,516
(Shelton) Shit, Whitehurst.

162
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:25,722
You are Without a doubt

163
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:28,486
the most pathetic thing
I have ever seen!

164
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:31,165
Wouldn't you agree?

165
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,846
I asked you a question, nimrod!

166
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,038
No, sir! I don't agree, sir!

167
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:42,397
Are you contradicting me,
you sorryI ass sack of shit?!

168
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:44,597
You asshole.

169
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:52,004
What did you say?

170
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:54,925
I said, you asshole, sir!

171
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:03,758
You think you're pretty funny.

172
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:06,526
Yes, I do, sir.

173
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:10,963
Why don't you drop
and give me 25 right now.

174
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:14,920
25 What, sir?
25 push ups, De Silva.

175
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:22,721
One, sir. two, sir...

176
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:27,761
Now, you Women might think that
because you're so much more delicate,

177
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:31,436
you deserve some sort
of special treatment,

178
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:35,799
and once a month We're just
going to get on out of your Way.

179
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:38,042
Well, you can forget it.

180
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:41,363
The same rules apply for everybody.

181
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:43,682
(De Silva) 18, sir. 1g, sir.

182
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:48,596
(Shelton) Only the fittest survive.
(De Silva) 22, sir. 23, sir.

183
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:49,796
OneI handed.

184
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:57,520

How you doing, Tyler?

187
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:28,883
Sorry. Nothing from your dad today.
Maybe tomorrow.

188
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:34,122
Listen, he's busy flying jets,
defending the country.

189
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:37,364
He'll Write When he can.
I know.

190
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:40,243
Hey!

191
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:42,357
I got a job for you.

192
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:49,757
Would you give this
to the new kid for me? Barclay.

193
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:51,843
Yes, sir.

194
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:53,878
Thattaboy.

195
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:55,326
Oop!

196
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:05,805
ow! Watch it, kid! AnyWay,
how could you be so stupid?

197
00:24:15,727 --> 00:24:17,877
Hey, look out!

198
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:05,238
A Good Guy.

199
00:25:09,247 --> 00:25:11,238
Ah!

200
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:14,518
Who the fuck are you?

201
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:17,479
I thought you guys
only said three sentences.

202
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:20,121
I'm new and improved.

203
00:25:21,527 --> 00:25:24,041
I never saw a doll like you before.

204
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:29,684
All right, kid, fun's over.
Where the hell's Andy?

205
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:31,683
Andy?

206
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:36,118
Can't you read?
He Was supposed to get this package.

207
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:40,365
Tampering With the mail
is a federal offence.

208
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:43,319
Sorry. Is he your best friend?

209
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:48,566
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.

210
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:51,837
Wait a minute.

211
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,481
I got a new body,

212
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:59,281
and I ain't told anyone
about my little secret yet.

213
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:05,799
So, uh, What's your name, kid?

214
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:08,315
Tyler. What's yours?

215
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:12,318
Chucky. But, uh...

216
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:16,360
my real name is Charles Lee Ray.

217
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:46,844
Hey, Whitehurst.
What am I doing Wrong?

218
00:26:56,647 --> 00:26:58,638
Is there anything you can't do?

219
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:02,316
Yeah. I can't seem to get
thrown out of this place.

220
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,437
Barclay, meet De Silva.

221
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:07,160
-Hi.
-Hi.

222
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:10,119
So, um, Want to show me?

223
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:12,476
Yeah, sure.
OK.

224
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:27,564
No. Put the elbow,
yeah, like that.

225
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:34,798
And like this.

226
00:27:39,247 --> 00:27:41,442
No. Keep both eyes open.

227
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:46,116
Keep your sights on the target.

228
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:50,076
Now hold your breath.

229
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,516
SqueeZe the trigger,
don't pull it.

230
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,998
You're not concentrating.

231
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:05,601
It Was really great
What you did for us back there.

232
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:07,444
Shelton's a major dick.

233
00:28:07,487 --> 00:28:09,478
Tell me about it.

234
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:19,439
(Tyler) Can't We play hide and seek?

235
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:21,125
(Chucky) Hold still.

236
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,476
(Tyler) What do you call this game?

237
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:27,918
Hide the soul. Trust me.
You're gonna love it.

238
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:30,117
Whatever you say, Charles.

239
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:34,836
Ade due damballa!

240
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:38,357
Give me the power, I beg of you!

241
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:50,996
Leveau mercier du bois chailiotte!

242
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:54,244
Secoise entienne me pois de...

243
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:57,438
(Man) Divide the troops in half.

244
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,806
Shit!

245
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:01,441
Charles, stop sWearing.

246
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:05,799
Per soldier, We're gonna need
the Springfield OI 3s

247
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:08,998
marked for both the red team
and the blue team.

248
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:11,686
What are you doing, Tyler?

249
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:13,558
We're playing hide the soul.

250
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,796
I'll catch up With you.
I'll load the paint.

251
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:24,080
We don't play With dolls,
do We, Tyler? Dolls are for girls.

252
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:26,402
But Charles is my new best friend.

253
00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:30,725
Tyler, you know better than to
talk back to a superior officer.

254
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:32,723
Yes, sir.
Clean that up.

255
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:34,678
I'll take care of this.

256
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:40,517
I'll be back!

257
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:52,521
Left! Left! Left, right, left!

258
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:57,766
Left! Left!
Get that Weapon up, Barclay!

259
00:29:57,807 --> 00:30:00,116
Platoon, halt!

260
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:02,397
Left face!

261
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:05,523
New boy, fall out!

262
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:14,437
Fall out!

263
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:20,078
(Shelton) Shoulder arms!

264
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:24,365
Forward! Arms!

265
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:28,678
Right shoulder! Arms!

266
00:30:31,087 --> 00:30:33,078
Left shoulder! Arms!

267
00:30:35,207 --> 00:30:36,879
(Man) Right shoulder! Huh!

268
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:41,482
Left shoulder. Huh!

269
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,559
Forward! Huh!

270
00:30:49,367 --> 00:30:50,766
Left shoulder. Huh!

271
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:54,561
Arms. Forward!

272
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,359
Right shoulder. Huh!

273
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,119
Barclay!

274
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:15,483
It's not a baton, Barclay.

275
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:22,077
You look like a goddamn
majorette over here.

276
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,798
I'm not used to guns, sir.

277
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:32,439
Does this look like
a gun to you, Barclay?

278
00:31:32,487 --> 00:31:36,480
It's a rifle! Major Ellis?

279
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,757
Show the new boy the difference!

280
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,758
This is my rifle, this is my gun.

281
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:44,844
This is for shooting,
and this is for fun.

282
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:51,364
A soldier's rifle
is his best friend.

283
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:55,083
Remember that.

284
00:32:07,287 --> 00:32:09,755
Stop!

285
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,166
Shit!

286
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:23,596
(Chucky) Help! Please, mister!

287
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:25,524
Please, somebody!

288
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:28,798
Jesus!
(Chucky) I'm stuck! Mister!

289
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,323
I'm in here!

290
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,403
(Man) Hold on. I'm coming!

291
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:38,556
Where are you?

292
00:32:39,847 --> 00:32:41,644
I'm coming.

293
00:32:48,527 --> 00:32:50,597
Yell or something! Make a noise!

294
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:59,358
Where are you?

295
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,164
What the...?

296
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:13,759
Oh, my God.

297
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:15,479
No! Stop!

298
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:25,323
Stop! Ah!

299
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,281
Ahh!

300
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:41,278
(Shelton) Fall out.

301
00:33:48,687 --> 00:33:50,484
You get back there.

302
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:07,486
Better finish unpacking. Shelton's
notorious for surprise inspections.

303
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:13,244
What are you doing?

304
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:16,723
What does it look like?
I'm polishing Shelton's shoes.

305
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:19,327
He makes you polish his shoes?

306
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:22,677
No, I offered out of
the kindness of my heart(!)

307
00:34:27,287 --> 00:34:31,041
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane
With that doll today?

308
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:33,043
No. What doll?.

309
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:35,237
He Was carrying a Good Guy doll

310
00:34:35,287 --> 00:34:38,245
just before the accident
With the garbage truck.

311
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:40,437
Good Guys, I remember those.

312
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:43,284
Yeah, me, too.

313
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:52,678
Uh, lights out in a few minutes.
I'm going to go get Washed up.

314
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:09,723
Barclay, Sergeant Clark Wondered
if you got that package.

315
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:12,361
-What package?
-You got a package in the mail.

316
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:15,444
Tyler Was bringing it.
Didn't you get it?

317
00:35:15,487 --> 00:35:16,681
No.

318
00:35:19,727 --> 00:35:21,718
Who sent me a package?

319
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,401
ow!

320
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:43,202
Hey, long time no see, pal.

321
00:36:43,247 --> 00:36:46,205
No, you're dead. We killed you!

322
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:51,401
You know What they say, you just
can't keep a Good Guy down.

323
00:36:57,007 --> 00:37:00,124
Andy, how you've grown.

324
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:03,443
You're not gonna kill me.
You need my body.

325
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,284
Wrong again, Wimp.

326
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:09,798
I got fresh meat lined up and you
Won't spoil it, not this time.

327
00:37:11,007 --> 00:37:12,122
Tyler.

328
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:16,479
Yeah, just think.
Chucky's gonna be a bro.

329
00:37:17,847 --> 00:37:20,156
I'm not gonna let you
get away With this.

330
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:23,558
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.

331
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:44,036
What's the matter, Barclay, huh?
You homesick?

332
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:46,078
You miss your mommy?

333
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:49,884
What the fuck is this?

334
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:52,202
Sorry about your shoe.
I'll polish it.

335
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:54,602
Just give me back the doll.

336
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,445
No, no, you listen to me.

337
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:59,842
You tell Whitehurst
he's off the hook.

338
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:02,037
I got myself another slave.

339
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:06,915
And clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.

340
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,764
What about the doll?.

341
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:14,045
My kid sister's birthday
is coming up.

342
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:16,681
I think she's gonna love it,
don't you?

343
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:02,484
Oh, shit.

344
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:33,284
Andy.

345
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:36,484
What the fuck?

346
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:41,039
No, stop!

347
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:42,839
What the fuck are you doing?

348
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,764
You Wouldn't believe me.

349
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:48,843
Where's the doll, Barclay?

350
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:51,605
Where's the fucking doll?.

351
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:53,285
-You took it.
-No!

352
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:55,318
What's going on?

353
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:57,562
Somebody sure as hell took it.

354
00:41:10,087 --> 00:41:13,841
It's almost midnight, Colonel.
Is this really necessary?

355
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:15,923
I'm Weeding out a thief, sir.

356
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:19,437
You've told me it's important
to uphold the honour code.

357
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:22,843
I'm trying to impress that
upon the men, sir.

358
00:41:25,087 --> 00:41:27,237
All right, Shelton, make your point.

359
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:30,040
But I Want everybody back inside
at O1OO hours.

360
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,884
Yes, sir.

361
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:40,042
When We get through With Barclay,
he'll be living in a World of shit.

362
00:41:40,087 --> 00:41:42,647
We've got an hour
so let's make it count.

363
00:41:42,687 --> 00:41:44,678
Yes, sir.

364
00:41:45,687 --> 00:41:48,645
(Ellis) All right, ladies,
get those Weapons in the air.

365
00:41:48,687 --> 00:41:50,643
I Want to see 'em high!

366
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:52,405
Higher!

367
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,602
I think I'm gonna throw up.

368
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:01,079
(Boy) You're dead, new boy.
(Second boy) Fucking geek.

369
00:42:31,087 --> 00:42:34,796
"Dear Charles, you're it.
Come and find me, your best friend."

370
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:36,565
Shit.

371
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,439
(Tyler) Charles.

372
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:52,758
Come and find me!

373
00:42:52,807 --> 00:42:55,526
God damn it.

374
00:42:55,567 --> 00:42:57,319
Platoon!

375
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:58,561
Double time!

376
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:02,079
Get those knees up, ladies!

377
00:43:02,127 --> 00:43:05,358
-Where do the kids sleep?
-Above the portico, Why?

378
00:43:05,407 --> 00:43:09,036
(Ellis) You're Wearing combat
boots, not ballet slippers.

379
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,601
Come on, move!
Barclay?

380
00:43:11,647 --> 00:43:15,879
(Ellis) It can get Worse than this!
Get the lead out. Move it!

381
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:20,079
Faster, faster. Let's go, girls.
Keep those knees in the sky!

382
00:43:25,087 --> 00:43:27,123
You son of a bitch!

383
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:33,362
Hell of a punch there, Barclay.

384
00:43:33,407 --> 00:43:35,602
Let's see What kind
of tough guy you are.

385
00:43:37,487 --> 00:43:39,478
Get your head around.

386
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:20,084
Tyler, come out, come out,
Wherever you are!

387
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:25,886
(Chucky) OllyI olly oxenI free!

388
00:44:25,927 --> 00:44:29,044
Get out here,
you little son of a bitch.

389
00:44:39,687 --> 00:44:42,520
(Ellis) Three!
(Soldiers) Three!

390
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:45,479
(Soldiers) Four!
(Ellis) You're pissing me off!

391
00:44:45,527 --> 00:44:49,679
All right, Barclay, I'm curious.
What are you trying to prove?

392
00:44:49,727 --> 00:44:53,037
-Forget it.
-No, really, I Want to know.

393
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:57,046
All right. The doll's alive.
He's after Tyler.

394
00:44:57,087 --> 00:45:01,126
Right. Forget it.
I hope he can handle himself.

395
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,927
(De Silva, Whispering) Shut up.

396
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:20,325
(Girl) I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

397
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:22,483
(De Silva) Stay here and keep Watch.

398
00:45:22,527 --> 00:45:24,916
I live for this.
So go, go!

399
00:45:33,927 --> 00:45:36,964
You know, I don't see
What you see in that guy, anyWay.

400
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:39,885
I don't know, he's different
from everybody else.

401
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:42,885
Oh, please.
He's kind of cute, too.

402
00:45:44,127 --> 00:45:45,560
OK.

403
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:51,125
Foster homes.
No Wonder he's so quiet.

404
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:52,885
(Thump)

405
00:45:52,927 --> 00:45:54,883
What Was that?

406
00:46:15,727 --> 00:46:19,322
So you took the doll?. Shelton
Will have you courtI martialled.

407
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:21,881
We're playing.
What are you guys doing?

408
00:46:21,927 --> 00:46:25,920
We couldn't sleep.
Oh! Oh, he is so cute.

409
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:29,676
(Tyler)He Was mine first!
Give him back! Give him back!

410
00:46:29,727 --> 00:46:32,480
Shh! You guys, please be quiet.

411
00:46:32,527 --> 00:46:35,087
Will you go stand guard?
Yes, sir(!)

412
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,080
So What's his name?

413
00:46:38,127 --> 00:46:40,880
Ask him yourself.
All right.

414
00:46:40,927 --> 00:46:43,043
What is your name, little doll?.

415
00:46:43,087 --> 00:46:46,875
Hi, I'm Chucky.
I'm your friend to the end.

416
00:46:46,927 --> 00:46:48,724
HideyI ho! Ha ha!

417
00:46:49,327 --> 00:46:50,760
I love it.

418
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,684
His real name is Charles Lee Ray.

419
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,321
Oh, is that so?
Give me your lipstick.

420
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:58,325
-What for?
-Just give it to me.

421
00:46:58,367 --> 00:47:01,086
What are you doing?
You'll see.

422
00:47:01,127 --> 00:47:02,401
Wait. Stop.

423
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:04,677
Here you go, baby!
You're messing him up!

424
00:47:04,727 --> 00:47:06,638
You're so cute.

425
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:08,405
(Tyler) Don't do that!

426
00:47:08,447 --> 00:47:11,917
Don't. He looks stupid.
He looks like a Wuss.

427
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:13,923
No, he looks sWeet.

428
00:47:15,527 --> 00:47:17,518
You guys, someone's coming.

429
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,083
Come on, let's go.

430
00:47:20,127 --> 00:47:22,960
(Tyler) Stop! What about Charles?

431
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:28,884
Bleurgh!

432
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:31,284
This means War.

433
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:34,998
What the hell?.

434
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:52,283
I like to be hugged.

435
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:30,526
Oh, you got to be fucking kidding me!

436
00:50:01,887 --> 00:50:06,881
A man lives through two tours in Nam,
then one night he just drops dead.

437
00:50:06,927 --> 00:50:08,918
Doesn't make any sense.

438
00:50:21,327 --> 00:50:23,124
(Shelton) At ease!

439
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:26,762
We Will now take a moment of silence
to honour Colonel Cochrane.

440
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:31,076
He Was a fine man,
and he Will be sorely missed.

441
00:50:31,127 --> 00:50:33,402
Bow your heads for prayer.

442
00:50:37,527 --> 00:50:39,119
(Man) Take two!

443
00:50:55,007 --> 00:50:58,477
It's getting shaggy, Carlson.
I Want to see you on Friday.

444
00:50:58,527 --> 00:51:00,483
Yes, sir.

445
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:03,121
Monday, Fabricio.
Yes, sir.

446
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:06,324
My man.

447
00:51:14,327 --> 00:51:16,124
Tuesday.

448
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:24,685
Look at you, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.

449
00:51:24,727 --> 00:51:27,082
When's the last time you had a trim?

450
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:29,083
two Weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.

451
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,324
You think?! I Want to see you
right after breakfast. Got it?

452
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:34,358
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.

453
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:36,682
And What are you looking at, new boy?

454
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,319
Wednesday.

455
00:51:46,727 --> 00:51:50,436
Barclay, What are you doing?
You can't get up during mess.

456
00:52:01,007 --> 00:52:02,599
Major.

457
00:52:03,527 --> 00:52:04,676
At ease!

458
00:52:16,327 --> 00:52:18,477
-Tyler.
-Hi, Barclay. What's up?

459
00:52:18,527 --> 00:52:20,722
I gotta talk to you about Chucky.

460
00:52:20,767 --> 00:52:22,485
You mean Charles.

461
00:52:22,527 --> 00:52:24,324
Have you seen him?

462
00:52:25,327 --> 00:52:28,683
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.

463
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:32,003
He'll lay low till you're alone,
then he'll come after you.

464
00:52:32,047 --> 00:52:33,958
He's just playing.
Listen.

465
00:52:34,007 --> 00:52:39,240
No matter What he says or What he
promises you, stay away from him.

466
00:52:39,287 --> 00:52:41,005
He's bad.

467
00:52:41,047 --> 00:52:44,722
Charles isn't bad. He's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.

468
00:52:44,767 --> 00:52:47,725
He lies, Tyler.
Believe me, he's bad news.

469
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:51,806
He's hurt a lot of people.
Colonel Cochrane Was one of them.

470
00:52:51,847 --> 00:52:56,125
You're jealous because he's my
best friend instead of yours.

471
00:53:00,127 --> 00:53:03,119
Look. You better keep this.

472
00:53:05,927 --> 00:53:08,885
Whitehurst,
you are Without a doubt

473
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:13,079
the sorriest excuse for a soldier
to ever disgrace these Walls.

474
00:53:14,127 --> 00:53:17,722
Face it, you're not
cut out for this life.

475
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:21,282
Do yourself a favour
and get the hell out of Kent.

476
00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:24,683
If I had any choice
in the matter, I Would, sir.

477
00:53:24,727 --> 00:53:25,716
SmartI ass.

478
00:53:26,527 --> 00:53:28,916
Presto. You're bald.

479
00:54:03,847 --> 00:54:05,405
What the hell?.

480
00:54:08,687 --> 00:54:10,678
How did you get in there?

481
00:54:16,727 --> 00:54:19,560
That haircut ain't regulation,
soldier.

482
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:23,719
When's the last time
you had a trim, huh?

483
00:54:32,527 --> 00:54:34,518
Kiss it goodbye.

484
00:55:03,407 --> 00:55:06,001
Presto. You're dead.

485
00:55:11,607 --> 00:55:14,167
It's definitely you.

486
00:55:26,727 --> 00:55:29,036
I just forgot my...

487
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:34,526
Boo!

488
00:55:38,007 --> 00:55:42,603
The annual War games have been a
tradition at Kent for over 5O years.

489
00:55:42,647 --> 00:55:47,084
Colonel Cochrane believed
in the value of tradition.

490
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:49,436
He not only Would have
Wanted us to go on,

491
00:55:49,487 --> 00:55:51,318
he'd have ordered us to go on.

492
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:57,761
Therefore, the War games
Will proceed as scheduled.

493
00:55:57,807 --> 00:55:59,638
(Soldiers yell)

494
00:56:00,687 --> 00:56:04,441
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton
Will command the blue team.

495
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:06,717
Major Rollins Will
head up the reds.

496
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:11,716
The objective is simple:
to capture the other team's flag,

497
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:14,520
bring it back here safely to base.

498
00:56:14,567 --> 00:56:16,125
Rollins.

499
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:21,275
You Will pick up your Weapons
in the armoury before moving out.

500
00:56:23,287 --> 00:56:27,485
You Will be using
the standard issue Springfield OI 3.

501
00:56:29,047 --> 00:56:31,038
Your ammo.

502
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,286
Shelton.

503
00:56:43,687 --> 00:56:48,078
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.

504
00:56:49,207 --> 00:56:52,882
Commanders,
take charge of your teams.

505
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:58,236
May the best team Win.

506
00:56:58,287 --> 00:57:00,881
Good luck, men and Women.

507
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:05,678
Nice of you to join us.

508
00:57:07,727 --> 00:57:10,639
Looks like Botnick's
in a pretty bad mood today.

509
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:14,043
-What's Wrong?
-Nothing.

510
00:57:14,087 --> 00:57:15,918
Nothing's Wrong.

511
00:57:17,607 --> 00:57:20,519
Nothing's Wrong. I'm fine.
Nothing's Wrong.

512
00:57:33,687 --> 00:57:36,360
This ought to slow the pricks down.

513
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:52,642
(Man) Left! Left! Left!

514
00:57:52,687 --> 00:57:56,680
(Man) # Here We go again
(All) # Here We go again

515
00:57:56,727 --> 00:58:00,436
(Man) # Same old stuff again
(All) # Same old stuff again

516
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:04,196
(Man) # Marching down the avenue
(All) # Marching down the avenue

517
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,317
(Man) # two more miles,
We'll be through

518
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:08,437
(All) # two more miles,
We'll be through

519
00:58:08,487 --> 00:58:12,765
(Man) # I'll be getting rid of you
(All) # I'll be getting rid of you

520
00:58:12,807 --> 00:58:16,402
(Man) # Same old ugly stuff
(All) # Same old ugly stuff

521
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:20,156
(Man) # Here We go again
(All) # Here We go again

522
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:23,916
(Man) # Marching down the avenue
(All) # Marching down the avenue

523
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,037
(Man) # One more mile,
We'll be through

524
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:28,760
(All) # One more mile,
We'll be through

525
00:58:28,807 --> 00:58:33,278
(Man) # I'll be getting rid of you
(All) # I'll be getting rid of you #

526
00:58:33,327 --> 00:58:35,318
What's going on, Whitehurst?

527
00:58:37,087 --> 00:58:41,046
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.

528
00:58:41,087 --> 00:58:44,443
Don't Wimp out on me now.
I need your help.

529
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:46,284
That kid needs your help.

530
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:49,876
I didn't see anything, OK?
I didn't see anything at all.

531
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:53,886
(Man) # Your left, right, your left
(All) # Your left, right, your left #

532
00:59:10,087 --> 00:59:13,124
Ellis, let's make sure
the perimeters are secured.

533
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:15,840
She checks all the Windows,

534
00:59:15,887 --> 00:59:19,766
and then the babysitter
hears this thump, thump.

535
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:20,956
Thumping.

536
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:25,159
Like something's being dragged
across the floor upstairs.

537
00:59:25,207 --> 00:59:28,563
And suddenly she thinks,
"I haven't checked on the children."

538
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:33,635
So she hurries to the top of the
stairs, and When she gets there,

539
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:39,717
she sees her boyfriend,
completely dismembered,

540
00:59:39,767 --> 00:59:44,045
dragging himself
across the floor by his chin.

541
00:59:44,087 --> 00:59:51,004
Thump. Slide. Thump. Slide.

542
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:54,119
Thump. Slide.
(Girl) That is gross.

543
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:59,924
Hey, you guys,
I got a better story and it's true.

544
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:05,360
It's about this mental institution,
and it's a few miles away from here.

545
01:00:06,487 --> 01:00:08,762
Hey!

546
01:00:10,087 --> 01:00:12,282
Hope it Wasn't something I said.

547
01:00:12,327 --> 01:00:14,921
No. I'm sorry.

548
01:00:21,047 --> 01:00:24,278
De Silva, Where do you think
the red team's camped out?

549
01:00:24,327 --> 01:00:27,717
Could be anyWhere.
Shelton'll find them. He always does.

550
01:00:29,687 --> 01:00:33,077
By the Way,
you can call me Kirsten.

551
01:00:33,127 --> 01:00:36,278
-What?
-Kirsten.

552
01:00:36,327 --> 01:00:40,878
It's my first name. Do you have one?

553
01:00:40,927 --> 01:00:43,077
Andy. Oh.

554
01:00:43,127 --> 01:00:46,199
Come on, Andy,
I Want to show you something.

555
01:00:55,087 --> 01:00:57,157
Pretty cool, huh?

556
01:00:57,207 --> 01:00:59,198
Yeah.

557
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:04,803
(Barclay) I forgot those places
exist. People just go to have fun.

558
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:07,077
(Crackling) Listen!

559
01:01:07,127 --> 01:01:09,118
Somebody's out there.

560
01:01:11,087 --> 01:01:14,204
It's probably just a chipmunk
or something.

561
01:01:16,087 --> 01:01:19,318
-Nothing scares you, does it?
-No.

562
01:01:25,927 --> 01:01:29,806
Man, I really gotta
get out of this body!

563
01:01:38,927 --> 01:01:40,121
I'm going after Tyler.

564
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:42,476
Are you craZy?
You'll never find them.

565
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:45,917
Want to bet?
I sWiped this from Shelton's tent.

566
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:50,040
He sent out a reconnaissance mission
right before We pitched camp.

567
01:01:50,087 --> 01:01:52,726
The red team
is somewhere around here.

568
01:01:54,207 --> 01:01:56,402
That kid's a sitting duck,
Whitehurst.

569
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:58,881
Are you With me or not?

570
01:02:01,527 --> 01:02:03,518
I'm sorry, I can't.

571
01:02:26,687 --> 01:02:29,918
(Ellis) Up and at 'em, ladies,
We're moving out!

572
01:02:32,087 --> 01:02:36,046
I Want this camp to be
a ghost town in five minutes!

573
01:02:36,087 --> 01:02:38,476
I thought We Weren't going
until dawn.

574
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:41,519
Someone stole the map so
We're making our move now.

575
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:43,603
Get going, Hanley.

576
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:47,519
Whitehurst.

577
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:51,116
You Wouldn't know anything
about a missing map, Would you?

578
01:02:54,367 --> 01:02:58,042
Where the hell's Barclay? Whitehurst!

579
01:03:00,087 --> 01:03:03,841
Colonel Shelton, you'd better
have a look in here, sir.

580
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:09,276
What is it, Ellis?

581
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,397
Barclay's gone awOL, sir.

582
01:03:13,087 --> 01:03:15,681
He stole the map.

583
01:03:15,727 --> 01:03:19,083
That little fucking traitor's
doubling for the reds!

584
01:03:36,127 --> 01:03:38,197
Where's Tyler?

585
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,920
He Went awOL
With some guy named Charles.

586
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:50,517
Where's Andy?

587
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:52,558
Whitehurst, Where is he?

588
01:03:52,607 --> 01:03:54,598
(Ellis) Platoon, halt!

589
01:03:55,687 --> 01:03:59,566
All right. De Silva, you're
going to take the right flank.

590
01:03:59,607 --> 01:04:03,646
Siegel, you take the left. Check in
on the radio every five minutes.

591
01:04:03,687 --> 01:04:04,676
Move it.

592
01:04:04,727 --> 01:04:08,481
The rest Will spread out
and meet Ellis at Split Rock.

593
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:10,324
Move out!

594
01:04:11,607 --> 01:04:13,518
Whitehurst, move!

595
01:04:22,087 --> 01:04:25,523
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friends for?

596
01:04:30,127 --> 01:04:32,118
Duck.

597
01:04:34,887 --> 01:04:41,122
That Was a close one.
Now We can play hide the soul.

598
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:44,842
I'm tired. I don't Want to play
that dumb game any more.

599
01:04:44,887 --> 01:04:47,321
You're a fucking drag,
you know that?

600
01:04:47,367 --> 01:04:48,880
Watch your mouth, Charles.

601
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:50,406
Stop calling me that!

602
01:04:51,727 --> 01:04:53,285
What's the knife for?

603
01:04:53,327 --> 01:04:58,003
A good soldier
is always prepared, Tyler.

604
01:04:58,047 --> 01:05:00,880
Barclay Was right.
You're not a Good Guy.

605
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:05,842
Sorry, kid, you got me. I'm bad.

606
01:05:05,887 --> 01:05:08,959
Now, assume the position.

607
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:15,362
(Tyler) No!
(Chucky) Ahh!

608
01:05:17,887 --> 01:05:19,957
Get back here!

609
01:05:20,007 --> 01:05:22,475
Barclay! Barclay!

610
01:05:28,487 --> 01:05:29,886
Tyler!

611
01:05:32,687 --> 01:05:35,485
Barclay, you fucking traitor,
give me my map!

612
01:05:35,527 --> 01:05:36,801
Listen...

613
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:39,407
You got any idea What We do
to traitors?

614
01:05:39,447 --> 01:05:43,235
Tyler's in trouble.
Come on, Whitehurst, back me up.

615
01:05:45,087 --> 01:05:48,363
-Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
-Yes, sir.

616
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:50,796
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?

617
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:53,838
De Silva, do you copy?

618
01:05:57,087 --> 01:05:59,726
(Ellis on radio) 'De Silva, come in.'

619
01:06:02,607 --> 01:06:04,438
Ahh! Ahh!

620
01:06:05,607 --> 01:06:07,598
Siegel's on his Way back, sir.

621
01:06:07,647 --> 01:06:10,320
-No Word yet from De Silva.
-Keep trying.

622
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:13,245
Help! Help!
Tyler!

623
01:06:13,287 --> 01:06:15,960
Barclay!
Are you OK, Tyler?

624
01:06:16,007 --> 01:06:18,885
Well, looks like We got
ourselves a little Pow.

625
01:06:18,927 --> 01:06:22,317
Barclay, you Were right.
Charles is bad. He tried to hurt me.

626
01:06:22,367 --> 01:06:23,720
Who the hell's Charles?

627
01:06:23,767 --> 01:06:26,884
(Chucky on radio)
'Come in, Barclay. Come in.'

628
01:06:26,927 --> 01:06:31,079
Who the hell is that?
It's Charles.

629
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:37,478
Who is this?
(Chucky) 'Put Barclay on, jarhead.'

630
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:39,882
It's the reds.
They're up to something.

631
01:06:39,927 --> 01:06:41,883
What do you Want?

632
01:06:41,927 --> 01:06:46,443
'I Want the kid. Bring him to the
old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.'

633
01:06:46,487 --> 01:06:49,320
(De Silva) 'Andy, don't do it!'
De Silva!

634
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:50,766
You hear that, Barclay?

635
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:53,446
(Barclay) 'Don't touch her,
you son of a bitch.'

636
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:56,445
Bring me the kid or I'll Waste her.

637
01:06:59,087 --> 01:07:02,716
Red team, red team.
Come in, red team.

638
01:07:02,767 --> 01:07:05,076
(Rollins) 'This is red team. Over.'

639
01:07:05,127 --> 01:07:08,005
(Chucky) We got a situation
up at the old Jeep.

640
01:07:08,047 --> 01:07:12,279
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.

641
01:07:12,327 --> 01:07:15,797
(Chucky) I hope they like
the taste of lead.

642
01:07:15,847 --> 01:07:19,044
Now just sit back
and Watch the sparks fly.

643
01:07:25,647 --> 01:07:28,639
All right, you two go on
up ahead, draw 'em out.

644
01:07:28,687 --> 01:07:30,245
We'll circle around.

645
01:07:30,287 --> 01:07:33,085
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.

646
01:07:33,127 --> 01:07:35,880
Relax, Barclay. It's only paint.

647
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:37,918
All right. Let's do it.

648
01:07:48,127 --> 01:07:51,483
-I'm scared, Barclay.
-Yeah, me too.

649
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:01,439
All right, kid. Get over here!

650
01:08:01,487 --> 01:08:03,239
No.

651
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:05,403
Don't fuck With me!

652
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:08,086
I'll blow all of you to pieces!

653
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:17,441
Beat it.

654
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:31,798
Now, just get down and shut up!

655
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,844

656
01:08:47,847 --> 01:08:48,916

658
01:08:55,847 --> 01:08:57,838
De Silva, Where the hell is

659
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:02,477
Hi, soldier.

660
01:09:05,487 --> 01:09:07,159
Fuck me.

661
01:09:19,207 --> 01:09:21,038

Stay down!
They're using live rounds!

663
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:42,362
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

01:09:42,407 --> 01:09:45,001
Hold your fire!
(Chucky laughing)

665
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:58,398
Oh, God, he's not breathing.
Get away from him!

666
01:09:58,447 --> 01:10:00,324
You did this, didn't you?

667
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:02,597
You sick son of a bitch!

668
01:10:02,647 --> 01:10:04,478
I'm going to kill you!

669
01:10:04,527 --> 01:10:08,645
Stop it! Get off of him!
He didn't do it! Stop it!

670
01:10:08,687 --> 01:10:12,396
Sayonara, suckers.

671

672
01:10:14,487 --> 01:10:17,638
Stop it! He didn't do it!

Mister, you got to help me.
What's Wrong? What's the matter?

690
01:11:47,167 --> 01:11:49,237
Charles. He's after me.

691
01:11:49,287 --> 01:11:51,517
-Who's Charles?
-He's a Good Guy.

692

-He Wants to play hide the soul.
-OK, slow down!

693
01:11:54,327 --> 01:11:58,684
Are you from Kent?

I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.

No, he isn't. He Wants to hurt me.

701
01:12:21,727 --> 01:12:23,604
