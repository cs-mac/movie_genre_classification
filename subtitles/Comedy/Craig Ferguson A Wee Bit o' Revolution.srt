2
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:01,226
Wow.

3
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,355
I can't believe
we're already saying goodbye.

4
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,734
It's been great getting to know you,
Pee-wee Herman.

5
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:13,321
Earth sure is a great planet.

6
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,575
Your art, music, pizza.

7
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:21,538
You sure took to our customs fast.

8
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:23,874
Thanks for showing them to me.

9
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,795
I've loved these last two weeks.

10
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,715
I wish I didn't have to go.

11
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:33,134
Me, too.

12
00:02:33,843 --> 00:02:37,096
Come with me, back to my planet.

13
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,182
Meet my family and friends.

14
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:42,018
Live with me.

15
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:43,435
I can't.

16
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,689
I need to stay here
with the people of Earth.

17
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:49,984
I'm going to miss my new best friend.

18
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:54,405
I'll never forget you, Pee-wee.

19
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:57,533
I'll always remember you, too, Yul.

20
00:02:58,201 --> 00:02:59,911
Look.

21
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:02,163
I made us both friendship bracelets.

22
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:07,710
Pee-wee, they're beautiful.

23
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:09,628
Let's put them on.

24
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:22,892
I guess this is...

25
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:25,770
<i>arrivederci</i> then, right?

26
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:27,396
Right.

27
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:31,358
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Pee-wee Herman.

28
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:34,196
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Yul.

29
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:57,219
I want to go, but I can't leave home!

30
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,722
I can't leave home!
I can't leave home!

31
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:03,976
I want to go, but I can't leave home!

32
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:06,436
I can't leave home! I can't leave home!

33
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:07,771
I can't leave home.

34
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:11,483
I can't leave home!
I can't leave home!

35
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,861
Morning!

36
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,747
Ooh!

37
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:11,711
Ooh!

38
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:13,129
Apple-y!

39
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,507
- Good morning, Pee-wee!
- Morning, Mr. Murgatroyd!

40
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:22,389
- Pee-wee!
- Hi, kids!

41
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:34,317
Ooh! Ooh!

42
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:54,255
Hello!

43
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:58,092
Breakfast bar!

44
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:00,594
Scone, French toast, American toast...

45
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:06,225
Green grapes, sausages,
bacon, cinnamon toast!

46
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:09,978
Buh-bye!

47
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:24,368
Good morning, Pee-wee!

48
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:30,999
Good morning, Mrs. Rose!

49
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,085
Oh, look at you.

50
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,670
You're cute as a peanut!

51
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:37,631
Ow!

52
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,218
Have you heard about
those new corduroy pillows?

53
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:43,762
Corduroy pillows? No.

54
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:46,348
I'm surprised,
'cause they're making head lines!

55
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:49,518
Get it? "Head lines!"

56
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:51,019
Oh!

57
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:54,148
- Hold on. Hey, Ruby!
- Morning, Pee-wee.

58
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:57,110
- Last stop, Nana's Yarn Barn!
- Oh!

59
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:06,702
You're the sweetest boy in Fairville,
Pee-wee.

60
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:10,332
- Me?
- Is there anything sweeter than you?

61
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:13,293
Uh... a Root Beer Barrel?

62
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:16,421
That's right!

63
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:19,341
I know they're in here somewhere.

64
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,052
There it is.

65
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:25,305
No.
What was I looking for?

66
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:27,974
Oh...

67
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:32,812
Root Beer Barrels are my favorite!

68
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:36,065
Boop!

69
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:44,157
Ah!

70
00:07:44,824 --> 00:07:48,077
Well, listen, you seem really busy.
Let me let you let me run.

71
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:50,580
- Bye, Mrs. Rose!
- Bye-bye, Pee-wee.

72
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,960
- Pee-wee!
- Yo, Billy!

73
00:07:57,212 --> 00:07:59,672
- Hey, Pee-wee!
- Hey, Ben!

74
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:03,635
- Morning, Pee-wee!
- Kevin!

75
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:06,096
Pee-wee!

76
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,723
I'm so glad I bumped into you.

77
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:10,059
I've got an amazing deal
I want to tell you about.

78
00:08:10,142 --> 00:08:11,727
You're gonna have to tell me later, Marvin.

79
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,145
I'm on my way to work.

80
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:16,482
Just a moment of your time.
Come on, Pee-wee.

81
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:21,278
Tell me, Pee-wee, where do you
picture yourself on vacation?

82
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:22,863
Mexico?

83
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:24,281
Or Morocco?

84
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:25,949
Mexico?

85
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:27,826
Morocco?

86
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,954
What is this?
A travel agency or a millinery?

87
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,291
Sorry, Marvin, I'm not interested.

88
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,501
Come on, Pee-wee.

89
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:37,002
Don't you ever wonder

90
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:39,796
- what life is like outside Fairville?
- Nope!

91
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:44,468
Marvin, you know I don't want
to go anywhere or try anything new.

92
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:45,636
Bye!

93
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:05,030
Phew!

94
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:10,245
Emily, you scared me there for a moment.

95
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,747
I know I have overdue books.

96
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,707
I'm gonna return them soon, I promise.

97
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,294
- I don't care about silly overdue books.
- Oh?

98
00:09:17,377 --> 00:09:20,380
But I do have something special
I wanted to give to you.

99
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:23,216
Hmm.

100
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,471
The new <i>Scuba Cop?</i>

101
00:09:27,554 --> 00:09:29,013
<i>The Emerald Sharks?</i>

102
00:09:29,097 --> 00:09:31,766
And the sharks are hammerheads?

103
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:34,769
These are the exact type of sharks
that Scuba Cop hates the most!

104
00:09:34,852 --> 00:09:38,482
I haven't received your RSVP
for the Book Club tomorrow night.

105
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:40,525
I was thinking that, maybe afterwards,
you and I might...

106
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:43,445
Whoa, whoa!
Emily, let me stop you right there.

107
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:45,155
The fact is...

108
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:47,574
I neglected to RSVP my regrets.

109
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:49,951
I have rehearsal that night. NA.

110
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:52,621
- NA?
- Not available.

111
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:53,705
Sorry.

112
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:55,540
Well, what time is your rehearsal?

113
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:57,250
Oh, uh, TBD.

114
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:59,877
- TBD?
- To be decided.

115
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:04,090
LATT, Em. IHTBG.

116
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:08,094
- What?
- LATT, IHTBG.

117
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:09,638
- IHT...
- "Look at the time."

118
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:11,723
"I have to be going."

119
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:13,766
You understand.

120
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:20,232
Yay! Work time!

121
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:30,660
Two eggs, fried, extra hash browns,
side of sausage. Enjoy!

122
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:33,538
Looks fantastic as always, Beverly.

123
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,625
Dan's Diner.
Dan speaking.

124
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,762
French toast is up, Bev!

125
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:52,890
Denver omelet.
Easy on the cheese.

126
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:55,685
Easy on the cheese-y, coming right up-y!

127
00:10:58,312 --> 00:10:59,980
Boop.

128
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:05,444
Dudley! Sylvester! Clovis!
What are you guys doing here?

129
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:08,239
Pee-wee, we need to talk to you
about band rehearsal.

130
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:11,909
Well, it is unusual to be discussing
Renegades business at my workplace,

131
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,160
but, sure, what's up?

132
00:11:13,244 --> 00:11:16,789
My promotion at the grocery store means
I'm gonna be working a lot more hours.

133
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:18,290
Nights.

134
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:22,002
Yeah, and my girlfriend's making me take
ballroom dancing with her

135
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,713
four times a week.

136
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:24,881
Nights.

137
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:28,427
My office just pressured me into joining
their nighttime bowling league.

138
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,553
Nights.

139
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:32,138
But the Renegades rehearse at night.

140
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:35,308
Hello? How's that gonna work
if all you guys are so busy at night?

141
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:36,560
It's not.

142
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:38,604
The Renegades are breaking up.

143
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:40,647
What?

144
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:43,983
- No!
- Things are changing.

145
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,612
None of us have enough time
to be in a band anymore.

146
00:11:46,695 --> 00:11:47,696
I do!

147
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,573
That's because you're stuck in a rut,
Pee-wee.

148
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:51,199
We want to move on to other things.

149
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:53,159
What am I supposed to move on to?

150
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:55,161
What am I supposed to do
with my flutophone?

151
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:57,080
Why don't you think about a solo career?

152
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:58,873
Why don't you?

153
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:10,552
Good luck, you guys.

154
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:15,432
Good luck with all your stupid, important
reasons for breaking up the Renegades!

155
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,751
- Nice seeing you, Dan.
- Bye, Dan!

156
00:12:42,877 --> 00:12:46,255
Pee-wee, I gotta say,
your French toast is perfection!

157
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:47,465
Thanks.

158
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:51,385
Same with your pancakes, Herman.
They drive me crazy!

159
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:53,596
Not that long a drive, Ernie, but thanks.

160
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,098
I'm taking this biscuit with me.

161
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:57,183
I love it.

162
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:58,852
Why don't you marry it?

163
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:02,480
Listen, you guys, you seem really busy.
Let me let you let me run, okay?

164
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:03,981
All right? Buh-bye!

165
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:05,149
- Thanks for coming.
- Later!

166
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,693
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

167
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:10,154
Hey, sport, can you watch over the diner?

168
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:12,448
I gotta go meet a couple pals at the lodge.

169
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:15,785
Sure, Dan. I'll be right here.
Where else would I go?

170
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:18,412
Gonna be right here.
Just like always.

171
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:20,915
Have fun with your pals!

172
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:23,042
Attaboy!

173
00:13:57,411 --> 00:13:59,580
Sharks pulling off a jewel heist?

174
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:00,956
It could happen,

175
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,251
but not if Scuba Cop happens to be
swimming around!

176
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:24,354
Cool.

177
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,025
Double cool.

178
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:34,782
Triple cool.

179
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,495
Uh, hi! What can I get you?

180
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,915
- Milkshake, please.
- Flavor?

181
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,709
Let's say chocolate.

182
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,420
Sure. Three, two, one.

183
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:50,006
Chocolate.

184
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:05,647
Boop!

185
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:09,400
Ooh!

186
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:17,366
Ooh!

187
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:24,457
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

188
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,375
La!

189
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:05,582
Boop! Think fast!

190
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:17,135
Wow!

191
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:19,179
Thanks, appreciate that.

192
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:23,350
Mmm.

193
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,271
Mmm!

194
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:30,315
Mmm!

195
00:16:34,737 --> 00:16:36,947
Wow, man!

196
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:39,033
This milkshake is outrageous.

197
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:41,035
- I really mean it.
- Probably...

198
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:42,452
top five, all-time.

199
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:44,997
Thanks, my specialty.

200
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:47,124
You know what would go great
with a milkshake of this caliber?

201
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,417
A Root Beer Barrel!

202
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:52,755
Only the best candy in the world!

203
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:53,881
It really is!

204
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:55,340
Distant second?

205
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:58,010
Charleston Chew. Third?

206
00:16:58,135 --> 00:16:59,720
Tie between two candies.

207
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:00,846
Rolos and Skittles!

208
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,057
Shut up!

209
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,641
Shut up!

210
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:05,184
Shut up.

211
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:10,899
Well, all right,
Mr. Master Milkshake Maker,

212
00:17:10,982 --> 00:17:12,901
what do you say you show me around
this little burg of yours?

213
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:16,362
Me? A tour of Fairville?
I'd love to!

214
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:19,116
Oh, I can't.
I gotta watch over the diner.

215
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:21,409
- I promised Dan and Beverly...
- "Promised Dan and Beverly"?

216
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:24,162
Will you listen to yourself?
You sound like a little baby.

217
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,205
We'll only be gone ten minutes.

218
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:28,833
Chillax, man.
Live a little.

219
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,418
What?

220
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,671
Live a little.

221
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:36,758
Live a little.

222
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:51,022
I have kind of limited experience
on a motorcycle.

223
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:52,398
Shh!

224
00:17:53,316 --> 00:17:56,069
- You hear that?
- What?

225
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:59,489
It's the old highway callin'.
Get on.

226
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:22,221
Wicked-awesome view, dude!

227
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:25,516
- And it's right in your backyard.
- I'm glad you like it.

228
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,353
It roughly corresponds
to the model scale HO-187.

229
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:31,313
Wow, this is a whole new world for me.

230
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:33,232
A miniature world!

231
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,819
A miniature world.

232
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:40,156
I mean, look at the detail.
It's breathtaking.

233
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,033
You got a real gift, man.

234
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:43,159
Thank you.

235
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:45,870
Hey, how about that tour of Fairville?

236
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:50,415
Right over there, that's Dan's Diner,
where we met.

237
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:53,585
And there, Fairville Public Library.

238
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:55,254
Fairville High.

239
00:18:55,337 --> 00:18:57,256
Tire Repair of Fairville.

240
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,050
Fairville Fire Department.

241
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,467
Barber of Fairville.

242
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:01,802
And this right here,

243
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:05,681
this little building is where Fairville's
premier music group, the Renega...

244
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:09,643
- What's wrong? What's that building?
- Nothing.

245
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:11,979
It's just some stupid building

246
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:15,440
where my stupid band used to rehearse
before we broke up!

247
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:17,110
Let me get that right out of there.

248
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:20,947
Stupid! Stupid!

249
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:28,830
You okay?

250
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:31,250
Yeah, sure. I'm fine.

251
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,002
Hey! What's that?

252
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,047
Is that your house?

253
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,799
I didn't notice you had a tree house.

254
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:40,884
Oh, I don't.

255
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:44,012
That's the only detail
of this entire model that doesn't exist...

256
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:45,055
yet.

257
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:46,681
That's funny.

258
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:48,683
You know, I always wanted
a tree house, too.

259
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,476
That is funny!

260
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:54,273
Say...

261
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:57,901
What do you say you and me
get a picture of us

262
00:19:57,984 --> 00:19:59,778
at the site of your future tree house?

263
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:03,198
You ready?
Three, two, one.

264
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:04,950
Root Beer Barrels!

265
00:20:07,744 --> 00:20:09,370
You know, I never caught your name.

266
00:20:09,454 --> 00:20:12,832
Oh, it's Pee-wee. Pee-wee Herman.
And you are?

267
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,918
Good one.

268
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:17,045
Uh... what?

269
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,132
Wait...

270
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:21,341
you don't know who I am?

271
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:23,468
How could I?
Why would I?

272
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:25,305
I'm Joe...

273
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:26,472
Manganiello.

274
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:29,058
Well, pleasure to meet you,
Joe Man...

275
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:30,810
Manganiello.

276
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:32,436
Sorry, trick ear.
One more time.

277
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:33,729
Manganiello.

278
00:20:35,773 --> 00:20:36,941
I'm an actor.

279
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:39,693
I'm told show business
can be very competitive,

280
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:42,696
so hang on to your dreams
and who knows?

281
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,573
I wish you luck, Joe Man...

282
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:47,618
- Certainly you've heard of <i>True Blood?</i>
- Uh-uh.

283
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:51,122
<i>- Magic Mike?</i>
- Hmm, you'd think so, but no.

284
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:53,124
Man, you're so real.

285
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:55,084
That's what I like about you, Pee-wee.
You're normal.

286
00:20:56,585 --> 00:20:59,005
Your miniature world is awesome.

287
00:21:01,382 --> 00:21:03,676
Hey, what's on the other side
of those railroad tracks?

288
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:05,136
Beyond Fairville?

289
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:07,305
I don't know, I've never been there.

290
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:08,348
Never?

291
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:12,143
May I tell you something
I've never told anyone?

292
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:14,687
Sure.

293
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,813
What is it?

294
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,440
Once upon a time, I won a contest.

295
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:21,235
A trip to Salt Lake City, Utah.

296
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:25,572
But I never made it to Salt Lake City.

297
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:27,616
Or Utah.

298
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,286
Long story short...

299
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,789
I came back with a metal plate in my head.

300
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:38,128
- That explains why you don't travel.
- Hmm...

301
00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:41,548
Do you ever get worried
that life's just passing you by?

302
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:42,924
Ha!

303
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:46,511
What could possibly be going on out there
that I haven't tried already in Fairville?

304
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:48,889
- You ever been in a fight?
- No.

305
00:21:49,597 --> 00:21:51,766
- You ever broken a rule?
- No!

306
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,268
You ever had two women fight over you?

307
00:21:53,352 --> 00:21:54,519
Uh...

308
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:56,063
Have I? No.

309
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,650
Breaking rules and breaking hearts,
that's what life's all about.

310
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:02,236
I believe in fate.

311
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,945
And I think I know why you and I met.

312
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:08,616
You're gonna leave Fairville...

313
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,036
and you're gonna take a holiday.

314
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,038
I got your reason right here.

315
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:15,332
What is it? What?

316
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,047
I want you to be at my birthday party.

317
00:22:23,715 --> 00:22:25,217
New York City!

318
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,509
How would I ever...

319
00:22:26,593 --> 00:22:29,263
I couldn't possibly...

320
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:31,348
This is all happening so fast.

321
00:22:31,473 --> 00:22:33,141
See you in five days, brother.

322
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:35,685
"Five days"?
"Brother"?

323
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:38,355
- I've never even been on an airplane.
- No!

324
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:40,524
The only thing you're gonna
learn about yourself on a plane

325
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:44,279
is that you like the honey-roasted peanuts
better than the plain-salted.

326
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:46,697
If you're really hungry,

327
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:49,451
the open road is a smorgasbord
of life experience.

328
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:54,456
A few days on the open road
is worth a lifetime in Fairville.

329
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:56,124
The way I see it, Pee-wee Herman,

330
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:58,834
you got a choice to make.

331
00:22:58,918 --> 00:23:00,586
Stick around here...

332
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,508
...or live a little.

333
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:14,183
Stick around here...

334
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,726
or live a little.

335
00:23:16,936 --> 00:23:18,104
What should I do?

336
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,065
I wish I had some kind of sign.

337
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:26,362
Whoa, that's a big apple.

338
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,739
Big Apple!

339
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:30,616
That's it! Bingo!

340
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:34,078
- Can I get anybody more water?
- Where's my order?

341
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,579
Where's the food?

342
00:23:35,663 --> 00:23:36,831
I'm starving!

343
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:39,501
Bev, my lunch break is practically over!

344
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,961
Me hungry!

345
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,756
Shoot! Heck! Darn!

346
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:46,781

347
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,554
Pee-wee, where have you been?

348
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,515
I'm leaving town.

349
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,353
I won't be at work tomorrow
or the next day or the day after that.

350
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,939
I'm taking a holiday.

351
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:27,924
Come on, Little Connie.
We're going to New York City!

352

A traffic light!

367
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,358
Just like I've seen in
<i>National Geographic!</i>

368
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:34,075
I hope I'm not tempting fate
by saying this out loud,

369
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:38,622
but my very first holiday
is off to a perfect start!

370
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,212
Uh-oh, those nice women are in trouble!

371
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,510
Hitchhikers!
Hop in!

372
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,679
Where you headed?

373
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,641
- Hello...
- Drive, pip-squeak.

374
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:58,808
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

375
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,395
Time is of the essence, Daddy-o.
Put the pedal to the metal!

376
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,938
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my...
Ow!

377
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,482
Floor it, worm!

378
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,361
Hey!

379
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:11,196
Watch where you're going, maniac!

380
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:15,701
Why are the cops after us?
Are you guys witches?

381
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:18,621
Never ask a wimp to do a lady's job.

382
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:20,706
- Ooh!
- Faster, granny!

383
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:26,003
Please, don't make me
wreck Little Connie!

384
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,717
This is one moving violation
after another!

385
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:38,474
Ladies, hold on to your switchblades!

386
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:53,739
- Congrats, twerp.
- You're a criminal.

387
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:27,357
We just fed you.

388
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,403
Listen, ladies, it's been real
and it's been fun.

389
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:34,406
But has it been real fun? Mmm-mmm.

390
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:35,615
Nope.

391
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:38,034
Come on, let me go.

392
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:40,912
I gotta get to New York City,
to my friend's birthday party.

393
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:45,417
I don't care if your friend
is the Queen of England

394
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,378
and she's throwing her
100th birthday party

395
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:51,339
in the Statue of Liberty's underpants!

396
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,260
You're not leaving this motel room.

397
00:27:56,803 --> 00:27:58,346
Hey, Pepper.

398
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:00,223
He seems okay.

399
00:28:01,808 --> 00:28:03,518
Maybe we can trust him.

400
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:05,895
No way!
He'll go and squeal to the cops.

401
00:28:06,646 --> 00:28:08,690
- But I...
- Pipe down, squirrel!

402
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:11,693
My name's not Squirrel.
It's Pee-wee.

403
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:20,953
What's so funny?

404
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:25,666
We never introduced ourselves.

405
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:28,127
I'm Pepper.

406
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:32,172
Freckles.

407
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:38,053
My name's Bella. Nickname...

408
00:28:41,515 --> 00:28:42,558
Pee-wee.

409
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:44,727
Your name's Pee-wee?

410
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:47,146
Yeah, Pee-wee.

411
00:28:48,856 --> 00:28:50,566
I've never met another one.

412
00:28:51,317 --> 00:28:52,901
Me neither.

413
00:28:54,487 --> 00:28:57,531
Uh... Pee-wee and Pee-wee.

414
00:28:57,615 --> 00:28:58,949
Touching.

415
00:28:59,032 --> 00:29:00,701
Gets me right here.

416
00:29:01,952 --> 00:29:03,912
Can someone get me a tissue?

417
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:08,417
Police! We have you surrounded!
Open up!

418
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:15,800
Oh, thank goodness you're here, officers!

419
00:29:15,883 --> 00:29:17,134
Ladies, you're under arrest.

420
00:29:17,217 --> 00:29:18,552
Mmm-hmm.

421
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:20,638
For being too hot!

422
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,892
Fooled ya, girls!

423
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:27,187
I got these hunks out of the yellow pages.

424
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,647
Pillow fight!

425
00:29:59,052 --> 00:30:02,430
<i>"Pee-wee,</i>
<i>we will always have our name.</i>

Great, Little Connie's gone.

429
00:30:16,737 --> 00:30:17,863
Perfect!

430
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:20,407
It's all good.
No worries.

431
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,325
- Same difference!
- Pardon me.

432
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:23,493
Sir?

433
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:26,079
Everything okay?

434
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:28,373
My car's been stolen.

435
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:30,543
That's terrible.

436
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,211
Well...

437
00:30:33,045 --> 00:30:35,631
I'm heading east.
Need a lift?

438
00:30:36,173 --> 00:30:38,050
You are a life-saver!

439
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:43,472
I'm no hero.
Just a traveling salesman.

440
00:30:44,014 --> 00:30:46,684
- Hey, don't forget your coffee.
- Mmm-hmm.

441
00:30:46,768 --> 00:30:47,769
I...

442
00:30:47,852 --> 00:30:49,478
I thought you might say that.

443
00:30:50,187 --> 00:30:51,606
Ah!

444
00:30:51,689 --> 00:30:52,899
Magnet!

445
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:54,483
Good one! You got me!

446
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:56,402
One of my top sellers.

447
00:30:56,485 --> 00:30:57,570
Oh!

448
00:30:57,653 --> 00:30:58,821
And...

449
00:30:59,948 --> 00:31:02,199
got this bag of groceries.

450
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:06,203
Come on, let's hit the road.

451
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:07,538
Right on.

452
00:31:15,797 --> 00:31:18,591
There's a bag of groceries on your roof!

453
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:24,096
Gotcha!

454
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:28,476
Bingo.

455
00:31:31,103 --> 00:31:34,064
Ew! Snake farm, yuck.

456
00:31:34,148 --> 00:31:36,275
Ugh, I hate snakes.

457
00:31:36,358 --> 00:31:39,571
One of the area's
most popular attractions!

458
00:31:39,655 --> 00:31:42,282
And, it just so happens, our next stop.

459
00:31:42,908 --> 00:31:45,744
I supply their gift shop.

460
00:31:46,787 --> 00:31:47,788
These...

461
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:50,749
are what I call "the classics."

462
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,835
The big-sellers.

463
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:57,047
You're looking at some of the most
sought-after retail items in the world.

464
00:31:57,673 --> 00:32:00,717
Please do not touch the merchandise,

465
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:02,803
however tempted you may be.

466
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:05,555
- I won't, I promise.
- Okay.

467
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:07,390
- Hey, what's that over there?
- Hmm?

468
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:16,149
I think that's a...

469
00:32:16,232 --> 00:32:17,985
- tumbleweed.
- Oh!

470
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:19,736
Forgot that word.

471
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:22,489
Ooh, pecan logs.

472
00:32:22,572 --> 00:32:24,074
Mmm!

473
00:32:24,157 --> 00:32:25,408
Here.

474
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:29,454
A solar-powered calculator
the size of a business card.

475
00:32:29,538 --> 00:32:30,706
Complimentary.

476
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:31,999
Ooh, thanks.

477
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:36,294
Want anything else?
I'm feeling generous.

478
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:40,674
Top Secret Disguise Kit?

479
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:42,342
Wise choice!

480
00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:44,219
It's yours.

481
00:32:44,302 --> 00:32:46,222
You never know when
you're gonna need one of those.

482
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,321
Ah, they sell themselves.

483
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:06,200
Ew! Snake farm.

484
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:08,828
Yuck. Ugh!

485
00:33:08,912 --> 00:33:10,621
Have I mentioned I hate snakes?

486
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:12,123
Ah, Pee-wee.

487
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:12,017
Blech!

488
00:34:12,101 --> 00:34:13,226
Yuck.

489
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,895
Ugh!

490
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,861
I think I'll just wait out here.

491
00:34:22,945 --> 00:34:24,155
Come on.

492
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:28,450
By the time we leave this place,
I bet you'll be a snake lover, Pee-wee.

493
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,785
Bet me!

494
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,120
Come on.

495
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:38,585
Baby rattlers are the most dangerous,
because their venom is the strongest.

496
00:34:47,636 --> 00:34:49,763
That's stupid.

497
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:53,350
Come on, I can't wait
for you to see this place.

498
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:56,353
They got a snake in here
as big as that bus.

499
00:34:58,189 --> 00:35:02,443
Clay and Jimmy, behold the Cuatro Fuego.

500
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:07,365
Light four flames at the same time.

501
00:35:11,494 --> 00:35:13,412
What do you think, honey?

502
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:14,622
We'll take four boxes.

503
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:16,875
- Deal.
- Deal.

504
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:34,350
Lame.

505
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:36,519
Yawn.

506
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:37,645
Stupid.

507
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:41,107
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, as always.

508
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:44,236
How you liking the Snake Farm, Pee-wee?

509
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:46,071
I thought it would be a little scarier.

510
00:35:46,154 --> 00:35:47,822
You want scary, huh?

511
00:35:48,823 --> 00:35:51,659
If you're really looking to see
something scary...

512
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:53,828
who's he gotta see, Jimmy?

513
00:35:53,912 --> 00:35:55,413
The Monster.

514
00:35:56,748 --> 00:35:58,875
That is, if you're brave enough.

515
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:00,835
I think I could handle it.

516
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:02,461
Well, let's go.

517
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,847
You'll have to sign this release form
before you go in.

We take no responsibility
for any damage that occurs to you,

519
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:18,478

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,691
Including death.

521
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:25,485
Now, initial here.

522
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:29,282
Here.

523
00:36:31,033 --> 00:36:32,326
And here.

524
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:35,037
Here.

525
00:36:36,538 --> 00:36:38,040
Here and here.

526
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,167
Here.

527
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:44,797
And here.

528
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:48,050
Here.

529
00:36:48,134 --> 00:36:49,426
Here.

530
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:50,594
Here. Oh, oh, oh...

531
00:36:50,677 --> 00:36:52,721
I forgot this. Here.

532
00:36:53,973 --> 00:36:55,015
And here.

533
00:36:58,978 --> 00:37:00,062
Okay, I'm ready.

534
00:37:00,146 --> 00:37:04,275
- Let's go, let's get this over with.
- Okay, be my guest.

535
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:31,303
That's it?

536
00:37:31,386 --> 00:37:32,929
Rip-off.

537
00:38:22,897 --> 00:38:25,441
Uh-oh.

538
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:27,818
Getting dark.

539
00:38:30,988 --> 00:38:36,618
Sure would be nice
to see some sort of sign of civilizat...

540
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:47,755
Hello, there.

541
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:49,882
Sorry, I don't mean to trespass.

542
00:38:49,965 --> 00:38:51,717
Trespass?

543
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,929
No such thing in the heartland, stranger.

544
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:57,598
They call me Farmer Brown.

545
00:38:57,681 --> 00:38:59,975
They call me Pee-wee Herman.
Pleased to meet you.

546
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:02,561
What brings you to my farm, Pee-wee?

547
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:03,729
Well...

548
00:39:03,812 --> 00:39:05,398
Say no more.

549
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:07,983
You've got yourself a place to stay.

550
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:09,860
Thanks, Mr. Br...

551
00:39:10,861 --> 00:39:13,197
I mean, Farmer Brown.

552
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,080
- Hungry, by any chance?
- Ooh, I'm starving.

553
00:39:21,163 --> 00:39:23,791
Pee-wee, meet my daughters.

554
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:27,253
Meatloaf?

555
00:39:27,336 --> 00:39:29,464
I'm Linda. Freckled and furious.

556
00:39:29,546 --> 00:39:31,967
Howdy.

557
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,551
Ambrosia salad.

558
00:39:33,635 --> 00:39:36,263
Louise. Perky and fun.

559
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,350
Tomato soup.

560
00:39:40,434 --> 00:39:43,770
Donna. Gregarious and wily.

561
00:39:43,853 --> 00:39:44,854
Mmm.

562
00:39:45,522 --> 00:39:46,815
Green bean casserole.

563
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:49,318
Diane. Petite and polite.

564
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:50,652
Mmm.

565
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:52,529
Waxed beans.

566
00:39:52,612 --> 00:39:54,906
Janice. Tall and studious.

567
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:57,993
The way she said "waxed."

568
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:00,620
Mashed potatoes.

569
00:40:00,703 --> 00:40:03,623
Betty. Smart and coy.

570
00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:05,917
That looks delicious.

571
00:40:06,502 --> 00:40:07,961
Biscuits and gravy.

572
00:40:08,044 --> 00:40:09,463
Pam. Thrifty and thoughtful.

573
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:10,755
Yum.

574
00:40:12,382 --> 00:40:14,092
Melon balls.

575
00:40:14,176 --> 00:40:17,346
Judy. Tan and demure.

576
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:22,559

00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:28,606
That's it? Just nine?

579
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:32,486
Uh, where should I sit?

580
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:33,945
By me.

581
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:37,408
Slow down, girls.
Pee-wee'll sit next to me.

582
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:38,868
Aw!

583
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:51,172
Would you like to say a few words,
Pee-wee?

584
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:52,256
Oh, sure.

585
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,674
Uh...

586
00:40:53,757 --> 00:40:55,092
Encyclopedia...

587
00:40:56,135 --> 00:40:57,220
pimple...

588
00:40:57,303 --> 00:40:58,929
and hairball.

589
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:02,058
Amen.

590
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:03,434
Amen.

591
00:41:06,145 --> 00:41:07,313
Mmm.

592
00:41:07,397 --> 00:41:09,648
Dinner sure was delicious, girls.

593
00:41:09,732 --> 00:41:11,817
Thank you, Pee-wee.

594
00:41:13,861 --> 00:41:16,697
Ladies, it's getting late.

595
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,032
Bedtime.

596
00:41:18,115 --> 00:41:19,658
Aw!

597
00:41:31,045 --> 00:41:33,548
They are my prized jewels, Pee-wee.

598
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:36,967
You are a lucky man, Farmer Brown.

599
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:43,600
- I better be hittin' the hay.
- Just one thing, Pee-wee.

600
00:41:44,684 --> 00:41:47,729
Stay away
from my daughters tonight!

601
00:41:47,812 --> 00:41:49,565
I will.

602
00:41:49,648 --> 00:41:50,690
I really will.

603
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:08,333
Milk and cookies?

604
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:11,462
I'm kind of still full
from dinner, but thanks.

605
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,516
Can I come in?
I have extra blankets.

606
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,477
It's 80 degrees in here.

607
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,479
- Is that a yes?
- No.

608
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:29,647
But thanks.

609
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,994
Remember me? Linda? I've got blankets.

610
00:42:44,077 --> 00:42:46,121
I'm saving myself for marriage.

611
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,624
Let me in!

612
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:51,793
- I wanna snuggle!
- I promised your dad, no.

613
00:42:59,885 --> 00:43:01,346
- Catch me!
- No.

614
00:43:02,054 --> 00:43:05,057
What are you doing here?
I was here first.

615
00:43:05,141 --> 00:43:07,101
Hi, Pee-wee.

616
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:15,276
Boo!

617
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:24,452
Why, hello.

618
00:43:24,536 --> 00:43:26,287
Fancy meeting you here.

619
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:28,498
What up?

620
00:44:22,886 --> 00:44:24,179
Rise and shine.

621
00:44:25,013 --> 00:44:26,098
Well, come on.

622
00:44:26,181 --> 00:44:27,849
I got a surprise.

623
00:44:32,688 --> 00:44:34,774
Good morning, Pee-wee.

624
00:44:45,826 --> 00:44:47,620
Excuse me, where are we going?

625
00:44:47,745 --> 00:44:49,705
Oh, that's the surprise.

626
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:53,542
To the wedding chapel where my daughter
is getting married today.

627
00:44:53,626 --> 00:44:55,252
Oh, congratulations.

628
00:44:55,335 --> 00:44:57,504
Who's your lucky new son-in-law?

629
00:44:57,588 --> 00:45:00,841
Well, he's riding in the truck with me.

630
00:45:00,924 --> 00:45:02,301
I don't see him.

631
00:45:02,384 --> 00:45:03,677
It's you.

632
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:13,271
All the girls sure like you.
Every one of 'em.

633
00:45:13,354 --> 00:45:17,275
You know, all breakfast,
it was "Pee-wee-this" and "Pee-wee-that."

634
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:20,862
Which one of 'em
are you thinkin' about marryin'?

635
00:45:20,945 --> 00:45:22,071
What about Pam?

636
00:45:22,155 --> 00:45:24,157
She's great at impressions.

637
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,161
- Gee, I don't...
- Did you know Judy is a flautist?

638
00:45:28,244 --> 00:45:31,539
And don't get Linda started on submarines.

639
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:35,251
So, well, who's it gonna be?

640
00:45:36,252 --> 00:45:38,045
Geez Louise.

641
00:45:38,129 --> 00:45:39,172
Louise!

642
00:45:39,255 --> 00:45:42,342
Congratulations, he picked you!

643
00:45:44,135 --> 00:45:46,638
Yahoo! I'm getting married!

644
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:47,722
Louise!

645
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,061
We're gathered here today

646
00:45:54,145 --> 00:45:57,732
to honor the deep love
between these two soul mates.

647
00:45:59,275 --> 00:46:01,778
Louise Bobbie J. Brown,

648
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:06,324
do you take Pee-wee Aloysius Herman
to be your lawful wedded husband?

649
00:46:08,242 --> 00:46:09,202
I do.

650
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:13,289
And Pee-wee Aloysius Herman,

651
00:46:13,373 --> 00:46:17,419
do you take Louise Bobbie James Brown
to be your lawful wedded wife?

652
00:46:17,503 --> 00:46:18,504
I...

653
00:46:20,798 --> 00:46:21,799
I...

654
00:46:23,258 --> 00:46:25,386
I...

655
00:46:26,053 --> 00:46:28,514
Uh... I...

656
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:33,268
What?

657
00:46:33,352 --> 00:46:34,937
Oh, I hear nature calling.

658
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,398
I've gotta use the restroom.
I'll be right back.

659
00:46:38,816 --> 00:46:40,776
Excuse me, won't you?

660
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,587
Drat!

661
00:47:15,937 --> 00:47:18,272
Well, howdy, cowboy.

662
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:19,356
Howdy, partners.

663
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,819
Excuse the intrusion
to this most joyous occasion.

664
00:47:22,903 --> 00:47:26,573
Hey, Peanut, you think these two kids
are made for each other?

665
00:47:26,656 --> 00:47:28,867
Nay!

666
00:47:28,951 --> 00:47:29,993
All right, then.

667
00:47:30,076 --> 00:47:31,787
Well, then, let's get going.

668
00:47:33,872 --> 00:47:35,290
Come on, girl.

669
00:47:35,373 --> 00:47:37,083
Have a good day, cowboy.

670
00:48:07,823 --> 00:48:09,908
Ooh, ooh! Look at you.

671
00:48:10,951 --> 00:48:12,661
You? You're coming with us.

672
00:48:12,744 --> 00:48:14,830
- This your lucky day.
- Ooh!

673
00:48:16,915 --> 00:48:19,042
Right, and that's how we three met.

674
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:20,752
Best friends since beauty school.

675
00:48:20,836 --> 00:48:22,504
That's a lot of hairdos ago.

676
00:48:22,587 --> 00:48:23,588
- Okay.
- You tell him.

677
00:48:23,672 --> 00:48:26,132
What about you, Wanda?
How'd you get involved?

678
00:48:26,215 --> 00:48:27,717
I had the bus.

679
00:48:29,846 --> 00:48:31,388
And look at us all now.

680
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:35,100
Four friends on our way to represent
Freewheelin' Hair Mobile Salon

681
00:48:35,184 --> 00:48:37,269
at the National Hair Competition.

682
00:48:37,353 --> 00:48:40,773
And if we win, we get to go to
the International Hair Competition.

683
00:48:40,857 --> 00:48:42,859
- What do you mean "if"?
- Well, I mean...

684
00:48:42,942 --> 00:48:45,235
- Wanda, pull over.
- Pulling over.

685
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:46,403
Demo.

686
00:48:46,487 --> 00:48:51,158
My friends, let's show Pee-wee
what's definitely gonna make us win.

687
00:48:55,955 --> 00:48:57,247
Ooh, wow!

688
00:48:57,331 --> 00:48:59,124
Hairy. Whoa!

689
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:00,209
Big.

690
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:02,378
Who doesn't like giant hair?

691
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:04,505
You haven't even heard our theme.

692
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:05,965
Patriotism.

693
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:16,517
The United States of America.

694
00:49:23,148 --> 00:49:24,191
Wow!

695
00:49:24,274 --> 00:49:26,360
It's way bigger than I thought.

696
00:49:27,194 --> 00:49:28,696
I'm not gonna make it.

697
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:30,781
The party's in two days.

698
00:49:30,865 --> 00:49:32,825
Look where I am.

699
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:34,869
Look where I need to be.

700
00:49:35,536 --> 00:49:36,747
I won't get there in time.

701
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:39,165
What's wrong, baby?

702
00:49:39,249 --> 00:49:41,877
I might as well give up
and go back to Fairville.

703
00:49:43,795 --> 00:49:46,673
My friend won't even notice
I'm not at his party.

704
00:49:46,757 --> 00:49:48,216
Oh, I bet he will.

705
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:51,177
I would notice if Brook or Lane or Wanda
didn't show up to my party.

706
00:49:51,261 --> 00:49:52,721
Pee-wee,

707
00:49:52,804 --> 00:49:55,557
the hair-spray that holds
Freewheelin' Hair together,

708
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,142
upright and pert,

709
00:49:57,225 --> 00:49:58,936
is our friendship.

710
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:01,146
We endorse friendship.

711
00:50:01,229 --> 00:50:02,773
To friendship.

712
00:50:07,527 --> 00:50:08,570
Come on.

713
00:50:11,197 --> 00:50:12,198
Thanks, you guys.

714
00:50:12,282 --> 00:50:14,367
I just know that you're gonna make it
to New York City

715
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:17,328
in time for your friend's party, Pee-wee.
I can feel it.

716
00:50:18,997 --> 00:50:21,125
And you know what, Pee-wee?

717
00:50:21,249 --> 00:50:24,586
You are going to look fabulous.

718
00:50:24,669 --> 00:50:27,839
Ooh... Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

719
00:50:27,923 --> 00:50:30,258
Ooh, probably.

720
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:32,052
Ooh, ooh, I think I probably know, too.

721
00:50:32,136 --> 00:50:33,804
Makeover!

722
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:42,562
- We're here, girl.
- We're actually here.

723
00:50:43,982 --> 00:50:45,191
Here I come!

724
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:52,031
Helicopter-y.

725
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:56,202
Have fun at the party, Pee-wee.

726
00:50:56,285 --> 00:50:59,914
Hey, good luck in the contest.
I really hope you guys win.

727
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:01,666
- Aw!
- Thank you.

728
00:51:01,749 --> 00:51:03,668
And thanks for the makeover!

729
00:51:06,212 --> 00:51:07,172
Mwuah!

730
00:51:07,254 --> 00:51:08,714
- Bye, Pee-wee.
- Bye, Pee-wee.

731
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:09,882
Good luck.

732
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:12,593
How much longer
do I have to wait for my car?

733
00:51:12,677 --> 00:51:15,013
I'm in the prime of my life here.

734
00:51:15,554 --> 00:51:16,597
You!

735
00:51:16,681 --> 00:51:19,184
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

736
00:51:22,854 --> 00:51:24,480
Come over here.

737
00:51:27,025 --> 00:51:29,735
Is that helicopter on your head
operational?

738
00:51:50,756 --> 00:51:52,009
Ooh, dog-do.

739
00:51:54,053 --> 00:51:55,595
You're funny!

740
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,264
Amusing.

741
00:51:57,973 --> 00:52:00,100
Bet you'll get a kick out of this.

742
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,853
Easy there, sport.

743
00:52:02,936 --> 00:52:05,689
There's only four of these babies
in existence.

744
00:52:05,772 --> 00:52:06,773
Here.

745
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:10,819
Whoo!

746
00:52:13,113 --> 00:52:15,365
Whoa!

747
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:16,783
What is this thing?

748
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,285
It's a flying car, darling.

749
00:52:18,994 --> 00:52:20,954
I'm flying her back to New York City.

750
00:52:21,038 --> 00:52:22,539
That's where I'm going.

751
00:52:22,622 --> 00:52:25,292
I knew you weren't from here.
You stick out.

752
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:28,170
You've got cosmopolitan
written all over you.

753
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:32,465
Unless you object to being in Manhattan
in five hours...

754
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,177
...be my co-pilot.

755
00:52:35,261 --> 00:52:37,345
- Get in!
- Yes, ma'am!

756
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:47,480
Ooh!

757
00:52:55,614 --> 00:52:57,866
Oh, breathtaking view, is it not?

758
00:53:00,161 --> 00:53:01,662
Welcome to the skies.

759
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:03,623
The name's Penny King.

760
00:53:03,706 --> 00:53:05,125
Pee-wee Herman.

761
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:07,294
How'd you get your hands on a flying car,
Miss King?

762
00:53:07,376 --> 00:53:10,922
I'm the heiress
to the King Doorbell fortune.

763
00:53:11,005 --> 00:53:14,259
Every time you ring, I hear ka-ching.

764
00:53:15,635 --> 00:53:17,053
Do you live in Manhattan?

765
00:53:17,137 --> 00:53:19,264
Oh, this will be my first visit.

766
00:53:19,347 --> 00:53:22,225
Fascinating.
Tell me everything.

767
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:26,187
Well, I'm out on the road.
So I could live a little.

768
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:28,356
Live a little?

769
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:30,233
I say live a lot.

770
00:53:30,317 --> 00:53:31,567
Live it up.

771
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:34,695
People like us crave fun and excitement.

772
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:38,658
Which do you prefer,
salted or honey roasted?

773
00:53:38,741 --> 00:53:40,285
Oh, I don't know.

774
00:53:40,368 --> 00:53:41,410
I can't decide.

775
00:53:41,494 --> 00:53:45,539
Well, why decide, baby?
Take 'em both.

776
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:48,668
- Sandwich?
- Oh.

777
00:53:49,336 --> 00:53:50,711
Ooh!

778
00:53:55,133 --> 00:53:56,968
Pee-wee!

779
00:53:57,051 --> 00:53:58,886
You're eating the garnish.

780
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:02,265
I never thought of that.
You're a trendsetter.

781
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,070
Engine failure.
That can't be good, right?

782
00:54:15,154 --> 00:54:17,572
Oh, don't sweat it, kid.

783
00:54:17,656 --> 00:54:18,782
Here.

784
00:54:19,867 --> 00:54:21,869
<i>Au revoir,</i> Pee-wee.

785
00:54:23,787 --> 00:54:27,416
<i>C'est la vie!</i> Live it up!

786
00:54:44,058 --> 00:54:45,893
It's all good.

787
00:54:45,976 --> 00:54:47,519
It's all good!

788
00:54:47,602 --> 00:54:49,188
It's all good.

789
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:50,564
It's not all good.

790
00:54:50,647 --> 00:54:52,316
It's not all good.

791
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:44,827
Welcome back to life.

792
00:55:47,538 --> 00:55:49,291
They call me Grizzly Bear Daniels.

793
00:55:49,374 --> 00:55:52,419
- They call me Pee-wee Herman.
- Where are we?

794
00:55:53,044 --> 00:55:55,797
The woods.
In the mountains.

795
00:55:56,798 --> 00:55:58,216
I gotta be on my way.

796
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,135
- How do you get out of here?
- You don't!

797
00:56:00,969 --> 00:56:02,929
Not without a seasoned guide.

798
00:56:04,222 --> 00:56:08,226
Someone who knows these woods
like the back of their weathered hand.

799
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,061
Someone who's lived with nature

800
00:56:10,145 --> 00:56:15,191
since they decided to live alone,
off the grid as a hermit,

801
00:56:15,275 --> 00:56:18,694
and leave the dog-eat-dog world
of certified public accounting.

802
00:56:19,946 --> 00:56:21,865
Is it you you're talking about?

803
00:56:27,704 --> 00:56:29,039
Come on.

804
00:56:29,123 --> 00:56:30,124
Follow me.

805
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:32,751
I'm your only way out.

806
00:56:43,804 --> 00:56:46,640
Where are we going? It seems
like we're going deeper into the woods.

807
00:56:50,227 --> 00:56:52,396
What was that?

808
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,231
Bigfoot!

809
00:56:54,315 --> 00:56:56,484
Nah, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

810
00:56:56,567 --> 00:56:59,278
What do you think,
I'm a crazy man living in the woods?

811
00:56:59,362 --> 00:57:01,405
I don't know.
Are you?

812
00:57:06,952 --> 00:57:08,662
Welcome to my cave.

813
00:57:09,913 --> 00:57:11,040
"Cave"?

814
00:57:12,749 --> 00:57:14,377
Did you say "cave"?

815
00:57:22,009 --> 00:57:24,678
Oh, my.

816
00:57:24,761 --> 00:57:27,348
What a beautiful abode.

817
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,226
Rustic.

818
00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:33,355
Who's your decorator?
Davy Crockett?

819
00:57:33,438 --> 00:57:35,148
Well, listen,
I love what you've done with it.

820
00:57:35,232 --> 00:57:36,858
I simply love it!

821
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:39,570
So, I'm gonna let you let me run, okay?

822
00:57:39,652 --> 00:57:41,905
You just got here.

823
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:45,742
Sit it.

824
00:57:50,163 --> 00:57:52,082
Don't move a muscle.

825
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:57,254
I'm gonna slip into something
a little more comfortable.

Where we headed?

834
00:58:33,582 --> 00:58:35,833
Our village is two miles away.

835
00:58:35,918 --> 00:58:37,753
We'll be there in five hours.

836
00:58:41,507 --> 00:58:44,885
What's up with you guys?
Abe, Ezekiel, you time traveling?

837
00:58:44,969 --> 00:58:46,720
No, no.
We are Amish.

838
00:58:46,804 --> 00:58:48,389
- Gesundheit.
- No, Amish.

839
00:58:48,473 --> 00:58:49,474
Gesundheit.

840
00:58:49,557 --> 00:58:51,643
- No, Amish.
- Gesundheit!

841
00:58:51,725 --> 00:58:52,810
No, no. Amish.

842
00:58:52,893 --> 00:58:54,687
- Gesundheit.
- No, no...

843
00:58:58,357 --> 00:59:00,318
We Amish people
live a simple life.

844
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:01,486
Gesundheit.

845
00:59:01,569 --> 00:59:04,572
With no reliance on modern technology.

846
00:59:04,656 --> 00:59:06,616
- Wow! You don't even have cars?
- Nope.

847
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:08,117
- What about lawn mowers?
- No.

848
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,452
Manual only.

849
00:59:09,535 --> 00:59:11,412
- How about hair dryers?
- Nope.

850
00:59:11,496 --> 00:59:13,289
- How do you dry your hair?
- The wind.

851
00:59:13,372 --> 00:59:14,915
- Air.
- Oh.

852
00:59:14,999 --> 00:59:17,001
- How about electric butter churns?
- No.

853
00:59:17,084 --> 00:59:18,836
We churn by hand.

854
00:59:18,919 --> 00:59:20,754
Stop it! Shut up!

855
00:59:21,673 --> 00:59:23,215
Whoa!

856
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:27,720
Wow!

857
00:59:27,845 --> 00:59:29,013
Cool village.

858
00:59:29,805 --> 00:59:31,307
Amish-y.

859
00:59:32,642 --> 00:59:35,978
So, Abe, Zeke, what do you guys
do for fun around here?

860
00:59:36,061 --> 00:59:37,146
- We work.
- Yeah.

861
00:59:37,229 --> 00:59:39,315
Whoa, slow down.
Hold on there.

862
00:59:40,191 --> 00:59:42,276
What do you like to do for fu-un?

863
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,613
Uh... Oh, check this one out.

864
01:01:51,866 --> 01:01:54,076
Yay! Yay! Thank you!

865
01:01:56,954 --> 01:01:58,080
Thank you.

866
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:03,420
My goodness,

867
01:02:03,504 --> 01:02:08,550
there's not been this much excitement
since Yoder's horse learned how to count.

868
01:02:08,634 --> 01:02:13,347
You know, being here with all of you,
I feel something.

869
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:14,765
Peace.

870
01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:15,850
Serenity.

871
01:02:16,809 --> 01:02:19,687
I feel at home here with all you Amishes.

872
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,271
Oh, that's wonderful, Brother Pee-wee.

873
01:02:21,355 --> 01:02:23,816
Now, I'd like to introduce you
to some other guests

874
01:02:23,899 --> 01:02:25,526
- we're having dinner with tonight.
- Oh.

875
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:27,611
Ruth, Miriam, Orpah,

876
01:02:27,695 --> 01:02:30,489
I would like you to meet Pee-wee Herman.

877
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:33,408
Wait a minute.

878
01:02:33,492 --> 01:02:35,285
These women are... Ow!

879
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:37,538
Out-of-towners.

880
01:02:37,621 --> 01:02:39,122
That's right.

881
01:02:39,206 --> 01:02:40,833
We're out-of-towners.

882
01:02:40,916 --> 01:02:42,334
No, they're... Ow!

883
01:02:42,417 --> 01:02:46,213
Owl hunters.

884
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:48,173
It's our hobby.

885
01:02:48,256 --> 01:02:49,966
No, these women are...

886
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:51,802
Fudge!

887
01:02:51,886 --> 01:02:52,969
Fudge makers.

888
01:02:53,053 --> 01:02:54,513
From way back.

889
01:02:54,596 --> 01:02:57,391
They're from an Amish village in...

890
01:02:57,474 --> 01:02:59,100
Oh, where did you say it was?

891
01:02:59,184 --> 01:03:00,310
- Las Vegas.
- Yes.

892
01:03:00,394 --> 01:03:01,395
Interesting.

893
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:05,106
I've never heard of an Amish community
in Las Vegas.

894
01:03:07,068 --> 01:03:10,071
Wow! I love this scrapple!

895
01:03:10,154 --> 01:03:12,741
I'm digging this corn soup! Mmm!

896
01:03:12,824 --> 01:03:16,912
This bologna and chow-chow
is worth the price of admission.

897
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:19,997
So, Brother Pee-wee,
will you be spending the night here?

898
01:03:20,081 --> 01:03:23,919
Well, I guess I could leave
early in the morning for New York.

899
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:28,047
We can take you into the city
on horse and buggy tomorrow morning.

900
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:30,216
If they have a horse and buggy
tomorrow morning.

901
01:03:31,634 --> 01:03:32,844
Time for bed.

902
01:03:32,928 --> 01:03:35,096
But it's 6:00 p.m.

903
01:03:35,764 --> 01:03:37,306
We should've been in bed an hour ago.

904
01:03:40,643 --> 01:03:42,979
We need to go to bed, everybody.

905
01:03:47,567 --> 01:03:48,693
Shut up.

906
01:03:48,777 --> 01:03:50,570
- You shut up.
- Both of you, shut up.

907
01:03:58,369 --> 01:04:00,496
Fancy meeting you here.

908
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:05,627
I don't know what you got
up your sleeve, kid,

909
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:10,799
but if I were you, I'd get off that buggy.

910
01:04:11,424 --> 01:04:12,467
No.

911
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:22,019
You kidnapped me, stole my car,
and left me tied to a chair.

912
01:04:22,102 --> 01:04:23,353
I should be calling the police.

913
01:04:23,437 --> 01:04:26,315
Amish don't have police,

914
01:04:26,398 --> 01:04:27,817
or phones.

915
01:04:28,651 --> 01:04:29,944
Pee-wee,

916
01:04:30,027 --> 01:04:32,989
I beg you, please don't blow our cover.

917
01:04:34,114 --> 01:04:37,367
Me, Pepper, and Frecks will drop you
in New York City on our way to Canada.

918
01:04:37,451 --> 01:04:39,453
Why would I go anywhere with you?

919
01:04:39,536 --> 01:04:41,622
You and your friends
are nothing but trouble.

920
01:04:41,705 --> 01:04:44,207
Now you're stealing
their horse and buggy?

921
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:46,335
What is wrong with you guys?

922
01:04:46,418 --> 01:04:48,253
Don't you care about anything?

923
01:04:50,088 --> 01:04:53,009
You know what?
You're right.

924
01:04:53,926 --> 01:04:56,720
And when you're right, you're right.

925
01:05:02,643 --> 01:05:04,394
"Dear the Amish...

926
01:05:06,396 --> 01:05:10,484
Sorry, we are stealing
your horse and buggy,

927
01:05:10,567 --> 01:05:14,071
but  we are leaving you
enough dough

928
01:05:14,154 --> 01:05:17,324
to buy a fleet of horses and buggies."

929
01:05:23,164 --> 01:05:25,166
You happy, wimp?

930
01:05:27,418 --> 01:05:30,171
Come on!
What's it gonna be, Herman?

931
01:05:30,254 --> 01:05:32,173
You joining us or not?

932
01:05:35,176 --> 01:05:36,219
Pee-wee.

933
01:05:38,262 --> 01:05:40,348
It's your big holiday.

934
01:05:42,308 --> 01:05:43,852
Come on.

935
01:05:49,983 --> 01:05:51,317
What are we waiting for?

936
01:05:53,403 --> 01:05:55,739
I was wrong about you, kid.

937
01:05:55,822 --> 01:05:57,657
Freckles, saddle up the hay-burner.
Pee-wee?

938
01:05:57,741 --> 01:06:00,035
- Yeah?
- Herman.

939
01:06:00,118 --> 01:06:01,745
Hop up here in front.

940
01:06:07,751 --> 01:06:09,293
Take the reins.

941
01:06:11,796 --> 01:06:13,172
Giddyup.

942
01:06:17,928 --> 01:06:20,931
Yee-haw! Yee-haw!

943
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:51,670
Ladies, it's been real and it's been fun.

944
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,381
And it's been real fun.

945
01:06:54,465 --> 01:06:56,634
Grab Manhattan by the horns, dude.

946
01:06:57,969 --> 01:07:01,013
You're badass, Herman.
You got my respect, rebel.

947
01:07:01,806 --> 01:07:03,057
Thanks.

948
01:07:09,188 --> 01:07:10,731
- I...
- Here.

949
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:13,651
No, keep it.

950
01:07:13,734 --> 01:07:17,071
It's yours.
It's got your name on it.

951
01:07:18,238 --> 01:07:19,657
Pee-wee's your name, too.

952
01:07:22,576 --> 01:07:24,078
It's our name.

953
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:33,879
Four days ago, you were the guy
who was going to New York.

954
01:07:33,963 --> 01:07:35,173
And look at you now.

955
01:07:36,382 --> 01:07:37,592
Here you are.

956
01:07:37,676 --> 01:07:39,385
You made it, baby.

957
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:44,016
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Pee-wee.

958
01:07:45,809 --> 01:07:47,477
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Pee-wee.

959
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:02,450
Can someone
get me a tissue?

960
01:08:02,534 --> 01:08:03,827
- No, I mean it.
- Oh...

961
01:08:11,584 --> 01:08:12,669
- Bye, Pee-wee.
- Bye, Pee-wee.

962
01:08:12,752 --> 01:08:14,420
- Bye, Pee-wee.
- Bye.

963
01:08:14,504 --> 01:08:15,797
Have fun.

964
01:08:18,424 --> 01:08:20,635
- Step out with your hands up!
- Damn it.

965
01:08:21,678 --> 01:08:22,804
You'll never catch me, copper!

966
01:08:22,888 --> 01:08:23,930
Hey, stay right there.

967
01:08:24,014 --> 01:08:25,057
- Hey, come back here!
- No.

968
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,267
I am not going back to the...

969
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:28,643
- No.
- Ow!

970
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:33,314

Halfway to hell.

Always eat your vegetables.

I hate vegetables!

Eat those Brussels sprouts!

1063
01:14:11,949 --> 01:14:13,368
I command you.

1064
01:14:13,451 --> 01:14:15,786
I am the President of the United States.

Why don't you?

1070
01:14:33,472 --> 01:14:36,100
We suspect that you've stolen
the palace jewels.

1071
01:14:36,225 --> 01:14:37,935
Where are they?
Hand them over.

1072
01:14:38,018 --> 01:14:41,313
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've never seen those jewels.

1073

if you make it to the party.

1077

- Yes, he will.

You're a nobody.
From Nowhere-ville.

1079

It's Fairville.

1080

Nobody will notice or care!

1081
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:03,961
Not Joe, not Fairville...

1082

around the world to be here.

1093

There is only one person that I wanted

I was just informed that,
for safety reasons...

1141
01:18:24,498 --> 01:18:27,292
they won't be able to get you
out of this well for another two days.

1142
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:28,585
Oh...

1143
01:18:29,711 --> 01:18:32,088
So, I guess I'll be...

1144
01:18:32,172 --> 01:18:34,591
Missing my party, yeah.

1145
01:18:36,718 --> 01:18:38,846
I did everything you said, Joe!

1146
01:18:38,928 --> 01:18:41,306
I broke rules, I broke hearts.

1147
01:18:41,389 --> 01:18:42,557
I lived a little.

1148
01:18:42,641 --> 01:18:46,645
I wanted to find out who I was.
Well, I found out, all right!

1149
01:18:46,728 --> 01:18:51,025
I'm a stupid little baby
crying at the bottom of this crappy well!

1150
01:18:53,444 --> 01:18:55,822
Come on, Pee-wee.
You can do it.

1151
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:57,824
They'll get you out, sport.

1152
01:18:57,907 --> 01:19:00,702
You probably didn't even notice
I wasn't at your party!

1153
01:19:00,785 --> 01:19:02,161
Are you kidding?

1154
01:19:03,287 --> 01:19:06,040
Pee-wee, can I tell you something?

1155
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,961
Ten minutes ago,
I was bawling my eyes out.

1156
01:19:11,045 --> 01:19:12,839
You were? Why?

1157
01:19:12,922 --> 01:19:14,340
Because...

1158
01:19:15,466 --> 01:19:17,510
I thought you weren't coming to my party.

1159
01:19:17,968 --> 01:19:19,512
Really?

1160
01:19:20,054 --> 01:19:21,347
Mmm-hmm.

1161
01:19:23,265 --> 01:19:26,060
I'm getting you out of here, Pee-wee.
Just hang on.

1162
01:19:26,143 --> 01:19:27,395
I'll be right back.

1163
01:19:27,478 --> 01:19:28,646
- Captain...
- Yeah.

1164
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:31,440
I can't wait two days.
I need Pee-wee out of that well now.

1165
01:19:31,524 --> 01:19:32,817
No, it's too dangerous.

1166
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:34,527
Gotta make sure the well
doesn't collapse on him.

1167
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:35,862
Collapse on him?

1168
01:19:35,945 --> 01:19:38,072
Darn it, Captain, how could
something like this even happen?

1169
01:19:38,155 --> 01:19:40,282
Why wasn't there something
covering the well?

1170
01:19:40,366 --> 01:19:42,660
You're right, Mr. Manganiello.
That's the problem.

1171
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,580
This metal plate should've
been covering the well.

1172
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:49,166
Metal plate?

1173
01:19:50,793 --> 01:19:52,002
Wait...

1174
01:19:53,128 --> 01:19:54,129
I've got it.

1175
01:19:56,507 --> 01:19:58,468
Heads up, Pee-wee!

1176
01:20:04,641 --> 01:20:05,642
Ow!

1177
01:20:16,194 --> 01:20:17,279
Hold on, Pee-wee.

1178
01:20:17,362 --> 01:20:18,864
My God!

1179
01:20:18,948 --> 01:20:20,449
- Come on.
- Come on.

1180
01:20:20,532 --> 01:20:22,659
- Just a little further!
- My brain!

1181
01:20:31,794 --> 01:20:33,003
I gotcha!

1182
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,047
Pee-wee!

1183
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:37,132
Come on!

1184
01:20:38,508 --> 01:20:40,343
- Joe!
- Pee-wee!

1185
01:20:40,427 --> 01:20:41,720
Happy birthday!

1186
01:20:43,054 --> 01:20:45,599
<i>The boy in the well is free!</i>

1187
01:20:55,025 --> 01:20:56,777
What do you say we get to my party?

1188
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,111
What party?

1189
01:21:11,292 --> 01:21:14,004
Wait, I thought you lived
in the penthouse.

1190
01:21:14,086 --> 01:21:15,630
Oh, I do.

1191
01:21:15,713 --> 01:21:17,548
Aren't we going to your party?

1192
01:21:17,632 --> 01:21:19,592
Pee-wee, we are the party.

1193
01:21:27,058 --> 01:21:29,560
Holy fudge!

1194
01:21:29,644 --> 01:21:32,897
- A giant miniature world!
- Yep!

1195
01:21:32,981 --> 01:21:35,066
A giant miniature world.

1196
01:21:35,149 --> 01:21:38,444
I made it all myself.
From my imagination.

1197
01:21:39,487 --> 01:21:41,614
Dinosaur world!

1198
01:21:41,698 --> 01:21:44,283
- Cool volcano!
- That lava's cotton candy.

1199
01:21:45,326 --> 01:21:48,538
Hey, you and I hit it off
the minute we met, remember?

1200
01:21:50,373 --> 01:21:51,499
You inspired me.

1201
01:21:52,792 --> 01:21:55,879
This is Glitter Mountain. Look!
I covered it with pixies.

1202
01:21:59,298 --> 01:22:01,217
Oh, hey, looky here.

1203
01:22:02,468 --> 01:22:05,429
Wow! You even have Fairville!

1204
01:22:05,513 --> 01:22:07,891
Dan's Diner.
The town square.

1205
01:22:07,974 --> 01:22:09,809
My house!

1206
01:22:09,893 --> 01:22:15,148
Look, a miniature of my miniature!

1207
01:22:15,232 --> 01:22:17,317
I knew you'd notice that.

1208
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:19,778
And... the best part.

1209
01:22:32,541 --> 01:22:34,043
My tree house!

1210
01:22:37,588 --> 01:22:39,464
Look, Joe.

1211
01:22:39,548 --> 01:22:41,717
I made this present for you.

1212
01:22:44,011 --> 01:22:45,554
Happy birthday.

1213
01:22:45,637 --> 01:22:47,848
A friendship bracelet.

1214
01:22:47,932 --> 01:22:49,058
Right.

1215
01:22:55,773 --> 01:22:56,899
And look.

1216
01:22:58,358 --> 01:22:59,568
It's just like mine!

1217
01:22:59,651 --> 01:23:01,653
Yeah!

1218
01:23:04,615 --> 01:23:07,118
- You know what would make this perfect?
- Yep.

1219
01:23:14,332 --> 01:23:15,333
Boop!

1220
01:23:16,501 --> 01:23:17,502
Boop!

1221
01:23:20,256 --> 01:23:21,800
To friendship.

1222
01:23:28,264 --> 01:23:29,641
Ah!

1223
01:23:45,782 --> 01:23:46,992
Here you go, fellas.

1224
01:23:47,075 --> 01:23:48,743
- Thanks, Bev. Yum!
- Thanks, Bev.

1225
01:23:49,744 --> 01:23:51,329
What's this stuff on my plate?

1226
01:23:51,412 --> 01:23:53,123
Look, it's on my plate, too.

1227
01:23:53,206 --> 01:23:56,168
Let's ask the chef.
Hey, Pee-wee!

1228
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:57,418
Yes, Beverly?

1229
01:23:57,502 --> 01:24:00,088
What is this on these gentlemen's plates?

1230
01:24:00,172 --> 01:24:02,215
- Fish sticks.
- No, there.

1231
01:24:02,298 --> 01:24:04,258
- Oh. You mean the garnish.
- Garnish?

1232
01:24:04,342 --> 01:24:06,344
Yes, garnish.

1233
01:24:06,427 --> 01:24:11,224
A decoration or embellishment
of a prepared food-plate or drink

1234
01:24:11,307 --> 01:24:13,476
to augment the visual impact on the plate.

1235
01:24:13,559 --> 01:24:14,602
Can you eat it?

1236
01:24:14,686 --> 01:24:16,354
My garnish tastes like an orange.

1237
01:24:16,437 --> 01:24:17,522
It is an orange.

1238
01:24:17,605 --> 01:24:19,273
Yes, your meal
will come with garnish.

1239
01:24:19,357 --> 01:24:20,650
Welcome back, Pee-wee!

1240
01:24:20,733 --> 01:24:23,528
I can't put my finger on it, but there's
something different about you.

1241
01:24:23,611 --> 01:24:25,738
- He's worldly now.
- Right, Pee-wee?

1242
01:24:25,822 --> 01:24:27,200
Pee-wee!

1243
01:24:27,282 --> 01:24:29,910
Pee-wee, why don't you stop by
and jam with us tonight?

1244
01:24:29,994 --> 01:24:31,704
Why don't you?

1245
01:24:31,787 --> 01:24:34,040
- This adding machine... hmm?
- Dan, check this out.

1246
01:24:34,123 --> 01:24:36,083
Solar-powered calculator.

1247
01:24:36,167 --> 01:24:37,168
Solar?

1248
01:24:37,251 --> 01:24:39,128
Yep, from the Latin, <i>solaris,</i>

1249
01:24:39,212 --> 01:24:42,715
meaning, "Derives its power
from the sun or <i>sol."</i>

1250
01:24:42,798 --> 01:24:43,799
Hmm?

1251
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,261
It works!

1252
01:24:47,344 --> 01:24:50,223
And this thing is just the size
of a business card!

1253
01:24:50,305 --> 01:24:51,765
Ain't that a miracle?

1254
01:27:51,793 --> 01:28:42,993
