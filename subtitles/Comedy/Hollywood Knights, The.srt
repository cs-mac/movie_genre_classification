1
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,360
Boxers!

2
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,840
Not one step further.

3
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,120
The keeper
of the lmperial Seal.

4
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,600
Just the man l was looking for.

5
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,680
A woman.

6
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,000
You Chinese are
very progressive.

7
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,000
A gift from an old friend.

8
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,680
Wu Chow.

9
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,080
He wanted me to send
his regards.

10
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,680
Father!

11
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,480
Father.

12
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,760
The seal.
You must get it back.

13
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,040
l promise.

14
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,720
Give this... to your brother.

15
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,080
What are you reading?

16
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,600
Oh.
"Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy."

17
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,880
lt's incredible.

18
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,960
Roy's just taken out
the Mummy's entire army

19
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,400
of zombie confederate soldiers,
and he only had one bullet.

20
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,080
That's impossible.

21
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,360
Oh, no, it's not.

22
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,960
Roy figured out
the physics of the canyon

23
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,400
and then ricocheted a bullet
off the canyon wall.

24
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,400
Nailed each zombie
through the heart.

25
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,640
What about the Shanghai Kid?

26
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,400
He was captured
and knocked out on page 10

27
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,040
while he was polishing
Roy's pearl handles.

28
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,160
Don't you worry.

29
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,160
Roy's about to save him from
becoming a human sacrifice.

30
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,920
Those stories are all lies.

31
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No. See?

32
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,280
lt says right here
on the back.

33
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,400
"Author Sage McCallister bases
all his stories

34
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,240
on firsthand accounts."

35
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,640
Sorry, sheriff.
No princess.

36
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,680
Every day you meet
the noon stage.

37
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,080
Every day it's the same story.

38
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,840
She's not coming back.

39
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,960
Pei Pei's married to her work
in San Francisco.

40
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,400
Modern woman.

41
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,640
Sheriff, you got a parcel.

42
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,760
Hey, maybe it's from her!

43
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,200
No. lt's from my sister
in China.

44
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,840
l know.

45
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,280
l know.
l must go.

46
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,600
Stay here and be a good horsey
for the new sheriff.

47
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,840
Uh, sheriff,
that stage is headed east.

48
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,480
lsn't China kind of west
of here?

49
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,120
l'm not going to China.
l'm going to New York.

50
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,600
Roy invested my money.

51
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,120
ls it true that he lives in a
penthouse at the top of the Ritz

52
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,800
surrounded by dozens
of beautiful women

53
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,440
at his every beck and call?

54
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,880
That's the old Roy.

55
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,160
He's married, settled down.

56
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,880
Trust me, he's changed.

57
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,880
So there we were.
Completely outnumbered.

58
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,600
He didn't have to tell me
we didn't stand a chance.

59
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,800
So l send the Shanghai Kid
and the princess out the back.

60
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,320
Poor Shanghai Kid.
He was so frightened.

61
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,600
He forgot to thank me
for saving his life.

62
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,360
l'm used to that.

63
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,160
Now, l returned to the front,
and l counted to three...

64
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,280
and l burst out of the mission.

65
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,120
Pearl handles blazing.
Lead flying everywhere.

66
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,080
And not a single bullet
touched me.

67
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,400
-No!
-Yeah.

68
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,520
What happened
to the emperor's gold?

69
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
Well, we divided it up.

70
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,840
l insisted on giving my share
to the lndians.

71
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,000
The savages?

72
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,600
Please don't ever call
those noble people savages.

73
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,840
lf being proud of your body

74
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,280
and wanting to ride around naked
all day makes you a savage,

75
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,160
then, by God,
you're drinking with a savage.

76
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,240
And that is what you call
a French toast.

77
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,800
You are so sophisticated,
Mr. O'Bannon.

78
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,720
Whoo!

79
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,880
Who's up for some more bubbly?

80
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,320
Reach for the sky, Roy.

81
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,440
Say that again.

82
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,600
Reach for the sky, Roy.

83
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,120
Chon Wang!

84
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,920
You sly son of a gun!

85
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,880
-Look at you!
-Look at you!

86
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,920
-What brings you to New York?
-My share of the gold.

87
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,200
Refresh my memory.
What gold?

88
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,280
The emperor's gold.

89
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,800
Okay, now, that gold is in

90
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,560
what the Wall Street pros call
a long-term investment.

91
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,480
We can't touch it
because it's building.

92
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,480
l need it tonight.

93
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,400
You just got here.
Let's celebrate.

94
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,360
No. l don't have time.

95
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,680
-You just got to the big city.
-My father's been killed.

96
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,000
Chon, l'm...

97
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,920
You need the money to get back
for the funeral?

98
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,120
No. l must go to England.
The ship leaves tonight.

99
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,640
Your father died in England?

100
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,320
China. My sister followed
the murderer to London.

101
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,800
Wait. Murderer.
l'm a little bit mixed up.

102
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
Let me see if l can get
the facts straight.

103
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,840
You have a sister? You never
told me you had a sister.

104
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,160
ls she pretty or does she look
like you? Be honest.

105
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,480
Roy, l need my money!

106
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,400
l don't like
that tone of voice.

107
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,400
You think after all we've been
through l'd stiff you?

108
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
l'm doing pretty well
for myself.

109
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,080
Yeah.

110
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,000
-l'm sorry, Roy.
-That's okay.

111
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,000
You're going through
a really tough time right now.

112
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,200
You got to be more trusting
of people, okay?

113
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,920
Look at me.
lt's Roy.

114
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,040
The couple at table 5
is ready to order.

115
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,200
Do you work here?

116
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,480
No, l don't work here.

117
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,880
lt looks like these guys
are wearing a similar jacket.

118
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,320
Roy, here's your cut
of the tips.

119
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,440
lt's the craziest thing.

120
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,040
l guess because
l come in here so much

121
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,480
they're mistaking me
for a waiter.

122
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,080
-lt's embarrassing.
-You lost the gold.

123
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,360
-Not all of it.
-Where's the rest?

124
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,160
l have one word for you.
Zeppelin.

125
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,880
l need my money now!

126
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,680
-Easy, easy.

127
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,840
Will you do anything
for this money?

128
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,720
Yes.
l must leave tonight.

129
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,480
Okay.
Take this key.

130
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,400
Go to the room.
Get cleaned up.

131
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,960
Your old pal Roy's got a plan.

132
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,080
Go! Come on!

133
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,040
Howdy, big boy.

134
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,960
What?

135
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,600
There's a woman in there!
She wants me to sleep with her.

136
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,720
Of course she does.

137
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,880
l told her the Great Wall
ain't the only big thing

138
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,880
coming out of China.

139
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,400
-Why did you say that?
-So you could get the money.

140
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
l will not sleep with women
for money!

141
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,440
Why?

142
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,560
l'm gonna sleep with her
for money.

143
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,800
Chon, just go in there
and do your business

144
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,880
and think about your sister
in England.

145
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,320
-What?
-Roy!

146
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,120
-Duty calls.
-Roy!

147
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,360
Good evening, Mr. Mayor.

148
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,720
Where are they?

149
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,880
Who?

150
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,560
My daughters.

151
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,680
10th floor.

152
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,840
Roy?
Roy, you got trouble.

153
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,400
Roy!

154
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,920
l got to check on something.
l'll be right back.

155
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,800
Chon, new plan.
We got to go.

156
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,560
-Chon, what are you doing?!

157
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,840
l'm fixing her back.

158
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,280
Put her down,
you decadent Philistine.

159
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,520
Hey, Chon, come on!
Let's go!

160
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

161
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,560
Come on!

162
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,240
l don't understand.
What's going on?

163
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,520
l don't have time to explain.

164
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,960
All you have to know is there
are bad men after us...

165
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,360
but l'm in the right.

166
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,720
-Roy.
-You gotta trust me on this.

167
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,800
Okay, look.

168
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,680
l'm in a transitional phase
in my life.

169
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
-But...
-But what?

170
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,480
You want to know the truth?

171
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,480
l'm a little lost right now.

172
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,480
l see you.
You've got a sense of purpose.

173
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,200
But look at me.
l'm a 30-year-old waiter/gigolo.

174
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,480
Where's the future in that?

175
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
So what's the plan?

176
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,600
You were always
my compass, Chon.

177
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,840
The plan.
You ask me the right questions.

178
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,840
The plan?

179
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,520
The plan, l think,
is to find the right woman.

180
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,920
Raise a lot of children
and teach them values.

181
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,640
No, Roy.
The plan to get out of here.

182
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,400
Okay, the plan.
Here we go.

183
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,920
-Cops! Cops!
-They can help us.

184
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,200
No, no.
Chon, not these cops.

185
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,120
These are dirty cops.
They take advantage of people.

186
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,440
Now, if they stop us, remember,
l'm not Roy O'Bannon.

187
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,920
Who are you?

188
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,120
l'm your friend Smoky Desperado
from the West.

189
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,400
And who am l?

190
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,440
You. You're Benihana.

191
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,560
-Benihana.
-Yeah.

192
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,000
You teach crippled children yoga
here in the city.

193
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,960
-You go first.
-No! Why me?

194
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,360
Because you blend in, okay?

195
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,240
Now, go!
Don't let them see you!

196
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,960
Benihana.

197
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,400
Hey! Hey!

198
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,240
Chon!

199
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,760
Come on.
Stop wasting time.

200
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,120
You!

201
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,360
Chon, l found our ticket
out of here.

202
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,120
We're on our way.

203
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,240
Looks like old Roy
came through again.

204
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,200
Just like old times, Chon.

205
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,960
Check over there!

206
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,960
-Over to the alley!
-That way!

207
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,800
Yeah, just like old times.

208
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,560
Will you forget about the gold
for a second?

209
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,280
You're gonna have more money
than you ever dreamed of

210
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,040
when that first zeppelin
takes off.

211
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,080
Why do l always believe you?

212
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,880
What do you mean?

213
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,400
You're lucky l didn't invest

214
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,320
in that ridiculous
automobile idea.

215
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,160
Yeah, that's gonna make
a lot of money.

216
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,480
What's that?

217
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,000
Doghouse.
l'm in the doghouse.

218
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,560
Oh, come on, Chon.

219
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,520
Look, l'm sorry l lied.

220
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,000
l just didn't want to
disappoint you.

221
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,240
That's exactly what l mean.

222
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,840
l can't take that look.

223
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,480
l learned it from my father.

224
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,600
That's how he used to look
at me.

225
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,280
What did your dad do?
Was he an lmperial Guard?

226
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,360
No.

227
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,160
Much more important.

228
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,640
He was the keeper
of the lmperial Seal.

229
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,080
That's what l love
about China.

230
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,880
Everybody's job description
sounds so damn cool.

231
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,840
The seal has been symbol
of the emperor's power

232
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,040
since Genghis Khan.

233
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,280
lt has been passed down
from one emperor to another.

234
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,720
My family have been watching
over it for 12 generations.

235
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,320
12 generations?

236
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,280
My father and l used to
skip stones across the moat

237
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,400
and talk about a day
l would follow his footsteps.

238
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,680
l was his only son.

239
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,200
lf l'd have been there,
l could have protected him.

240
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,560
lt's not your fault.
You were 3,000 miles away.

241
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,400
What's with that little box?

242
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,040
My sister sent it to me
from my father.

243
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,760
-There's a message inside.
-What's it say?

244
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,440
lt's a puzzle box.
l don't know how to open yet.

245
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,400
What do you mean?

246
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,920
Get a hammer and smash it open
so you can see what it says.

247
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,120
l must have patience.

248
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,440
By the time
l'm able to open it...

249
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,840
l will be ready to read
the message.

250
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,040
Come on, Confucius.

251
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,240
That's the corniest thing
l've ever heard.

252
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,960
Let me see this.

253
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,320
You know what?

254
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,280
We're gonna go to England.

255
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
We're gonna find
your dad's killer.

256
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,240
We're gonna get
that seal back.

257
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,720
There's no reward
for this, Roy.

258
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,000
Who said anything
about a reward?

259
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,400
l'm talking about friendship,
loyalty, honor.

260
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,920
Okay?

261
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,280
Thank you, Roy.

262
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,880
And l hear England is ass soup.

263
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,120
A lot of pretty girls there.

264
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,360
First order of business,
my Lords...

265
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,040
is a report from our esteemed
friend Lord Rathbone...

266
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,880
who recently returned from
a diplomatic mission to China.

267
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,240
Fellow Lords...

268
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,000
l'm afraid l bring disturbing
news from the Orient.

269
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,720
The opium wars
have ravaged the land.

270
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,120
The emperor's enemies
are organizing.

271
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,680
The most vicious
are the Boxers.

272
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,560
A godless band of rebels
who murder without discretion.

273
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,200
China is not well.

274
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,680
l have brought back an envoy
who should give us some insight

275
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,160
into the inscrutable mind
of the Chinese.

276
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,840
ls he mad?

277
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,720
Given to Her Majesty
Queen Victoria by the emperor

278
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,480
in recognition of her
50 glorious years on the throne.

279
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,800
Outrageousness!

280
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,760
Long live the queen.

281
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,400
Jack the Ripper
strikes again!

282
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,080
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it.

283
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,720
Howdy, partner.

284
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,680
The English are not
very friendly.

285
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,120
They're just sore losers.

286
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,600
What did they lose?

287
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,960
A little thing called
the American Revolution, Chon.

288
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,960
Never heard of it.

289
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,320
l'll give you the highlights.

290
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,240
They came over
with about a million men.

291
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,200
We had a bunch of farmers
with pitchforks

292
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
and beat 'em like a drum.

293
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,320
Hey! l'm walking here!

294
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,600
You're driving on the wrong side
of the road!

295
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,240
Bunch of amateurs.
These people don't get it.

296
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,000
Hello, ladies.

297
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,640
Look at you.

298
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,880
What? l'm not supposed to
notice a pretty lady?

299
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,320
l thought you wanted to
settle down and have a family.

300
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,560
l do, Chon.
l just hope l can.

301
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Why not?

302
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,160
Sometimes l worry that
all the damn horseback riding

303
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,480
l did out in the West,

304
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,400
bouncing up and down on the
hard saddles might have made it

305
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,640
so my salmon don't swim upstream
the way they're supposed to.

306
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
What?

307
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,840
l might be shooting blanks.

308
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Oh.

309
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,000
Don't say anything.

310
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,920
Roy, it's okay.

311
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,440
Some people are not meant
to have a family.

312
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,240
l've always had such a special
connection with children.

313
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,520
The little ankle biters.

314
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Hey, watch it,
you little punk!

315
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,440
Pardon me, guv.

316
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,960
You gents lost your way?

317
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,400
Yeah. We're looking
for my sister.

318
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,120
She's staying
at 32 Oxford Street.

319
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,200
l know it well, guv.
Me old man used to live there.

320
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,160
Can you show us the way?

321
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,080
Well, memory's
a little dodgy.

322
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,480
But l'm sure for a bob
l could get you there.

323
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,160
What do you take us for?
Okies from Muskogee?

324
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,200
Go sell your bullshit
someplace else.

325
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,160
We're not buying.

326
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,800
Thanks for the tip, guv.

327
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,080
Hey! l stole that watch
from my uncle!

328
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,360
What?

329
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
This way.

330
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,760
Come here,
you little rubbish eater!

331
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,840
What did l tell you about
poaching on our turf, Charlie?

332
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,960
l'm on the straight
and narrow. Honest.

333
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,000
What's this, then?

334
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,400
After l'm through
beating you...

335
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,280
you're gonna wish you never
ran away from the workhouse!

336
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,880
Leave the boy alone.

337
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,680
Bloody tourists!
Get your noses out of it!

338
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,440
Do whatever you want
to the kid...

339
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,160
but that's my watch.

340
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,480
Well, there's a load of us
and only two of you.

341
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,280
So piss off!

342
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,520
Easy, fellas.
You've lost one war this way.

343
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,440
Don't make
the same mistake twice.

344
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,720
Come on!
After him!

345
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,960
Hey!

346
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,480
There he is!
Get him!

347
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,040
We've got him now.
Move in, lads.

348
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,240
Boys, boys, wait, wait!

349
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,520
Come on! Get him!

350
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,560
Up the bloody ladder!

351
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,200
Hey! Hey!

352
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,520
Watch it!

353
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,560
Hey.

354
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,560
Come here, you!

355
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,360
Cool.

356
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,520
Move it!

357
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,320
You!

358
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,600
Did you see that?

359
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,240
lt's okay.

360
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
Okay?!

361
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,040
l call that one
my kung pao chicken.

362
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,760
l clotheslined the sucker.

363
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,800
Come on, get back!

364
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,000
Clear away!

365
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,720
Make way!

366
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,200
l think you gentlemen should
accompany me back to the yard.

367
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,760
This isn't a yard!
lt's a jail!

368
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
Roy, calm down.

369
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,480
Unbelievable.

370
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,400
Wait!
Someone's coming!

371
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,440
-Let me handle this.
-l'm gonna handle it.

372
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,960
The English aren't like you.

373
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,120
They don't get all emotional.
Touchy-feely.

374
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,240
Do me a favor.

375
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,680
Park the kung fu.
Let me do the talking.

376
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,560
Come here.
Let me give you a hug.

377
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,400
l've been after that
Fleet Street gang for two years.

378
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,320
Then you two come along
and bring them down

379
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,200
in a single afternoon.
Brilliant!

380
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,800
Now, um...

381
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,160
Oh, that's my watch!

382
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,840
Yes. A street urchin
turned it in.

383
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
The little punk better not
have scuffed it.

384
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,880
-l hope your luck picks up.
-What do you mean?

385
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,840
l deduced from your watch
that you'd hit a rough patch.

386
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,520
He has.
How do you know?

387
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,040
lt's an investigative technique
l've developed.

388
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,240
l can deduce intimate details
about an individual

389
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,680
through a close scrutiny
of their personal effects.

390
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,520
What else can you tell?

391
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,200
The owner of this watch
is a bad gambler

392
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,640
and a lousy shot.

393
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,280
Although he's cheated death
several times...

394
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,760
he spends most of his life
wandering in a rather pathetic

395
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,560
and futile search
for purpose and respect.

396
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,680
Oh, yes.

397
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,600
He has a penchant
for loose women.

398
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,360
Wow. That's amazing.

399
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,360
l'm sure it's a very popular
party trick

400
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,160
at birthdays
for small children...

401
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,040
but it doesn't quite play
with adults.

402
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,520
Just to set
the record straight.

403
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,160
Roy O'Bannon is not attracted
to loose women.

404
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,880
Loose women
are attracted to me.

405
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,000
-You're Roy O'Bannon?
-Yeah.

406
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,960
The famous Western folk hero?

407
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,120
Have you heard of me?

408
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,480
Have l heard of you?

409
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,760
l've only read "Roy O'Bannon
vs. The Mummy" five times.

410
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,000
lt's fascinating.

411
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,760
l want you to meet
the Shanghai Kid.

412
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Oh, yes.

413
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,360
The faithful Chinese sidekick.

414
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,800
l'm not a sidekick.
Those stories are all lies.

415
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,720
Come on, don't be bitter.

416
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,160
l can't help what
Sage McCallister writes.

417
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,840
lf there's anything l can do,
l'm at your service.

418
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,760
We're looking for my sister.
She's staying at this address.

419
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,640
Can you take us there?

420
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,560
Oh, dear.

421
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,000
l think you'd better come
with me.

422
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,760
Lin.

423
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,240
Wang.

424
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,600
lf you don't mind,
l'll just wait outside.

425
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,320
lntroduce me.

426
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Oh. This is Lin,
my baby sister.

427
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Roy O'Bannon.

428
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,320
Pleasure.

429
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,640
You never told me your sister
was such a...

430
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,680
beautiful lotus blossom.

431
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,840
What'd she say?

432
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,080
No, no, no.

433
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
No talking about me
in your native tongue.

434
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,480
Why are you in jail?

435
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,320
l followed the man
who murdered Father.

436
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,560
And?

437
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,080
l found out where he live.

438
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,920
l snuck inside his house
and tried to kill him.

439
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,920
lt's my duty to find
Father's killer.

440
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,560
No, it is mine!
l'm the one who promised Father.

441
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,920
But l'm his only son.

442
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,240
When you abandoned us
for America...

443
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,920
Father said he had no son.

444
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,320
What?

445
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,000
Whoa. Time out.

446
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,640
Time out. Come here.

447
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,160
The detective's a fan.

448
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,040
Why don't l play
the celebrity card?

449
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,680
We'll get her out that way.

450
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,920
-Okay?
-Okay.

451
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,480
Don't worry.
l'll get you out.

452
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,600
Everything's gonna be okay.

453
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,800
ln fact, l'm gonna give you
my good-luck playing cards.

454
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,840
Just ignore the naked ladies.

455
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Wang!

456
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,320
Have you opened Father's box?

457
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,960
Not yet.

458
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,240
She tried to assassinate
Lord Rathbone

459
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,640
whilst he was taking
afternoon tea.

460
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
He's 10th in line
to the throne...

461
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,680
Her Majesty's
favorite cousin...

462
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,800
and the finest swordsman
in England.

463
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,680
So, of course,
the press had a field day.

464
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,760
The story actually knocked Jack
the Ripper off the front page.

465
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,560
Artie, Lin is not a killer.

466
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,360
She's just a really,
really, really hot...

467
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,240
confused Chinese girl.

468
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,440
Maybe if l agreed to sign
a few autographs

469
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,480
and talk to some of my fans
here in England...

470
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,920
do some type of charity event,
can we get her out that way?

471
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,880
l'm afraid
that's out of the question.

472
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,320
What will happen
to my sister?

473
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,000
She'll go to trial,
probably be locked away

474
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,720
in an institution
for the criminally insane.

475
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,400
The tabloids have already
dubbed her "Loony Lin."

476
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,400
l thought it was rather catchy.

477
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,040
At the time.

478
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,160
Do you have any notion
what would happen

479
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,520
if we were to be seen
together?

480
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,280
Since your return, l have yet to
lay eyes on the lmperial Seal.

481
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,480
l'm hosting a jubilee ball
at my country estate tomorrow.

482
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,800
Be at the stables
at midnight.

483
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,880
As requested,
a token of my esteem.

484
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,200
This is where you get out.

485
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,760
l hope there will be
more trust between us

486
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,800
when l'm emperor
and you are the new king.

487
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,880
Wow. Buckingham Palace.
Look at that, Chon.

488
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,040
That's where the queen lives.

489
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,160
Hey, look at this guy.

490
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,880
He's a royal guard.
He has a very important job.

491
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,120
l used to be just like him.

492
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,760
No, they're nothing like you.

493
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,360
They're a tourist attraction.

494
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,320
You can make faces at them,
insult them...

495
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,600
and they can't move a muscle.

496
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,120
-Here. Watch this.
-Roy...

497
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,440
No, it's okay.

498
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,880
Hey, buddy,
your shoes are untied.

499
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,440
That is the biggest damn beaver
l have ever seen.

500
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,440
Roy, stop it.

501
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,400
The queen!

502
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,400
Look! The queen!

503
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,080
She's mooning us!

504
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,680
He almost went for that.

505
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,880
My friend and l just came over
from America.

506
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,520
You might have heard of it.
We run your jerkwater country.

507
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,640
Come on, you gonna take that
from a colonial?

508
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Roy, stop it.

509
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,760
l bet you are one hell
of a damn poker player.

510
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,960
No hard feelings.

511
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,160
They can't do that!

512
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,520
You're not allowed to do that!

513
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,600
Shouldn't have touched him.

514
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,600
You scram, you little punk.

515
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,160
l've got friends
at Scotland Yard.

516
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,600
l'll give you up
in a heartbeat.

517
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,080
You get your watch back?

518
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,480
Don't worry about my watch.
Go on.

519
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,680
lt's a knockoff.

520
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,120
What are you talking about?

521
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,840
My uncle stole this watch
from President Lincoln.

522
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,800
lt's a priceless
family heirloom.

523
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,800
Not according
to the pawnbroker.

524
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,200
You should not steal.

525
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,400
lf l don't steal,
l don't eat.

526
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,320
Who showed you how to do
all that kicking and punching?

527
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,160
My father.

528
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,160
Have you ever heard of those?
They're parents.

529
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,960
You don't 'cause you're
a little orphan.

530
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,440
Now, go on.
You're cramping our style.

531
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,800
Oh, this country blows.

532
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,800
You need a place to stay?

533
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,160
Come on in
and warm your dogs.

534
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,920
You can
get into a lot of trouble

535
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,760
breaking into
a place like this.

536
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,480
That being said, well done.

537
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,360
You just ate
the last chocolate.

538
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,520
Course l did.

539
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,520
You gotta look out
for number one.

540
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,120
l could really
get used to this.

541
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,480
Living the life
of a country gentleman.

542
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,360
Maybe doing
a little painting.

543
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,120
Let Lin play in the garden
with the children.

544
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,520
Vera, Chuck, and Dave.

545
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,960
Who's Lin?

546
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,520
Lin's the most beautiful woman
l've ever met.

547
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,640
She's gonna be the savior
of the house of O'Bannon.

548
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,400
Chon, check out the threads.

549
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,240
All l'm missing is the
loyal hound curled at my feet.

550
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,640
We are wasting time.
We must find Rathbone.

551
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,960
What do you think
l've been doing?

552
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,920
Sitting here drinking
expensive hooch?

553
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,960
Refill.

554
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,240
l've been working on a plan.

555
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,360
Now -- Whoa.
Don't slosh the brandy.

556
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,720
-lt messes with the bouquet.
-Sod off.

557
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,680
l'm trying to teach you
a skill set.

558
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,240
Help get you off the street.

559
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,200
-Bartenders make big bucks.
-Roy!

560
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,920
The plan.

561
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,640
Thank you, Chon.

562
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,760
lf we find the seal...

563
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,760
we can prove Rathbone
killed your dad.

564
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,440
lt's the old Hail Mary play.

565
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,680
l also have a version
where we dig a tunnel.

566
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,640
Hey!

567
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,800
Bloody catapult.
Jesus Christ!

568
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,040
-You don't need a catapult!
-Who asked you?

569
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,120
You don't interrupt grown-ups
when they're talking.

570
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,960
"Lord Nelson Rathbone requests
the pleasure of your company

571
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,080
at the jubilee ball

572
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,800
in honor of Her Majesty's
50th year on the throne."

573
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,240
Sounds good.

574
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,160
lt doesn't address security.

575
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,840
They're not gonna let
Chon and l

576
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,280
waltz into the castle.

577
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,720
All you need is
a proper disguise.

578
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,920
l do like a good disguise.

579
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,760
l look like a fool.

580
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,600
What?! You're a maharaja.
That's lndian royalty.

581
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,760
-But l'm Chinese.
-lt's the same thing.

582
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,840
Bob your head a little bit.

583
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,520
Gives you more
of a lndia-royalty flavor.

584
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,440
That's good.
Good show, good show.

585
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,640
Good show, good show.

586
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,120
-Cheerio, cheerio.
-Cheerio, cheerio.

587
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,880
What do we do
when we see Rathbone?

588
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,840
Kill him.

589
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,760
No, okay? No!

590
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,520
You're gonna be civil,
'cause we don't have the seal.

591
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,280
No seal. No Lin.
No family honor. Okay?

592
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,640
Be cool.
Okay, we look great.

593
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,120
Let's enjoy this party.

594
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,160
-Whoa. What are you doing?
-l'm going inside.

595
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,760
-The place is haunted.
-You're the harness man.

596
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,160
You get back at the carriage.

597
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,280
You wait in case we need
to make a quick getaway.

598
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,320
Go on.
Man your post.

599
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,880
You don't always get
what you want.

600
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,320
Why are you so mean
to that boy?

601
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,920
l see a lot of myself
in that kid.

602
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,120
lt's kind of freaking me out.
Come on.

603
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,800
Your name, please, sir.

604
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,800
So l can announce you.

605
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,240
Sherlock... Holmes.

606
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,080
Sherlock Holmes.

607
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,520
Which province do you represent,
Your Highness?

608
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,920
Nevada.

609
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,640
May l present
Major General Sherlock Holmes

610
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,560
and His Highness,
the maharaja of Nevada.

611
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,960
How are the security
arrangements?

612
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,080
Oh, everything seems to be
going swimmingly, my Lord.

613
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,280
And if l may say so...

614
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,880
it is an honor to guard
Your Lordship tonight.

615
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,280
l speak for all of us
at Scotland Yard

616
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,200
when l say that no matter how
far you are from the throne...

617
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,760
you'll always be number one
in our hearts.

618
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,120
Okay, here's the plan.

619
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,640
We're gonna get
a little chow.

620
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,360
Then we're gonna
sneak out of here.

621
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,760
-Start looking for that seal.
-Okay.

622
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,880
-Spotted Dick, sir?
-What?

623
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,600
Spotted Dick.

624
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,080
Can you believe this guy?

625
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,160
l'm trying to get
something to eat.

626
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,040
He's asking me
if l got the clap.

627
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,920
l think
he's offering you food.

628
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,840
Oh. Spotted Dick.

629
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,320
Oh, no.
l think l'll pass.

630
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,760
l'm not really
a dessert man.

631
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,000
Perhaps my friend might like
some Spotted Dick.

632
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,840
l might try
one of these sausages.

633
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,560
A little smoky Joe.

634
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,320
This is good!

635
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
l thought the food here
was supposed to suck.

636
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,560
The haggis is fresh
from Scotland, sir.

637
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,240
lt's made from
the finest sheeps' bladders.

638
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,160
l'm gonna get some whiskey
and wash my mouth out.

639
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,880
You should try the quail.

640
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
l shot them myself
this morning.

641
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,200
How do you do, Your Lordship?

642
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,880
Very well, thank you.

643
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,120
l'm not acquainted
with the Nevada province.

644
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,640
But l haven't been to lndia
since '81.

645
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,040
l spent most of my time
in the Orient.

646
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,600
l hear you've just returned
from China.

647
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,680
You are well-informed,
maharaja.

648
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,880
lt is my dream
that the Chinese people

649
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,160
will follow lndia's example and
one day embrace British rule.

650
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,720
The Chinese are very proud.

651
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,080
They place family and honor
above all else.

652
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,480
Well, l'm sure
we can break them of that.

653
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,800
lf you'll excuse me,
l have a matter to attend to.

654
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,120
Until we meet again.

655
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,960
Patience.
l'm proud of you, Chon.

656
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,400
We must find the seal.

657
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,000
What do you see?

658
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,960
Shh, shh, shh!

659
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,600
He just pulled a fancy
dragon key out of his desk.

660
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,080
That was my father's!

661
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,560
l must avenge his honor.

662
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,960
Hey, slow down, tiger.
Slow down.

663
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,400
Quit going all Chinese on me.

664
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,160
Where is he?

665
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,840
Damn it. Remember
your puzzle box. Patience.

666
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,120
Okay, there are no windows.

667
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,120
We just came in
through the only doorway.

668
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,800
That leaves one explanation.

669
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,560
Remember in "Roy O'Bannon
vs. The Mummy"

670
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,760
how the zombie king got away

671
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,560
when l chased him
into the pharaoh's tomb?

672
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,240
There's a secret passageway
behind the sphinx.

673
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,560
There's gotta be a lever
or a button over here.

674
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,560
Help me lift some stuff up.

675
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,880
Roy!

676
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,240
The painting.
lt's looking at me.

677
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,480
-Look!
-Oh, yeah.

678
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,560
Looks like it's looking at me.
That's great.

679
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,720
No, real eyes.
Moving!

680
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,040
That kid got to you,
didn't he?

681
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,320
Unbelievable!
We're not in a haunted house.

682
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,360
That's a technique
that an artist uses.

683
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,280
"Ubiquitous gaze" or "pursuant
eyes" is the technical term.

684
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,240
lt's unnerving, though.
l'll give you that.

685
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,960
Roy.
Now, those eyes. Look!

686
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,400
Whatever you say, Chon.

687
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,000
Let's see what you got here,
Rathbone.

688
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,320
Roy!

689
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,440
What, Chon?
Are the statues moving now?

690
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,600
Roy!

691
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,360
l can't hear myself think
with you shouting at me.

692
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,560
Chon?

693
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,560
Chon? Chon?

694
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,040
This is ridiculous.

695
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,640
lf you want to act
like a child and play games...

696
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,120
then find someone else...

697
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,520
'cause l take
this stuff seriously.

698
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,280
l'm here to work.
l'm on a mission.

699
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,120
Chon?

700
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,880
Okay, Chon.

701
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,920
Okay, you little
Chinese otter.

702
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,240
Let's play.

703
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,400
Chon, demons!

704
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,280
She's gonna fight
my battles for me.

705
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,960
Come on.
Let's go.

706
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,480
What? What are you doing?

707
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,000
lt's kinky.
l like it.

708
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,160
Wow! Look at this.

709
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,120
Wait. There's something
different about this room.

710
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,880
Hey.

711
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,680
Let's go!

712
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,640
-Wang!
-Chon, for God's sakes.

713
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,840
-Now he shows up.
-l found it.

714
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,720
Wait. Do you want to hear?

715
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,160
The seal's gone.

716
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,680
Lin.

717
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,360
Roy!

718
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,240
Are we gonna come back?

719
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,000
Roy!

720
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,640
Must you keep doing that?

721
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,720
l was taught
not to be seen or heard.

722
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,240
The seal.

723
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,960
l am a man of my word.

724
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,040
l remember watching
my brother play with this

725
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,520
like a baby rattle.

726
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,640
When l'd try to touch it,
the dowager empress beat me.

727
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,600
No doubt
your deprived childhood

728
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,840
made you into the man
you are today.

729
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,960
Wu Chow.

730
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,560
Wu who?

731
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,800
He is the emperor's
bastard brother.

732
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,240
He was banished
from the Forbidden City

733
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,040
for trying to steal
the lmperial Seal.

734
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,360
Our father caught him.

735
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,280
He vowed to return to claim
the emperor's throne.

736
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,960
This guy?

737
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,440
l'll assume everything
has been arranged as discussed.

738
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,320
You have nothing to worry about.
lt's all in place.

739
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,320
That diamond is as big
as a damn monkey's paw.

740
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,840
-Look at that.
-Roy.

741
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,480
Don't even think about it.

742
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,160
l'm just admiring
the craftsmanship, Chon.

743
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,480
So for now,
our business is completed.

744
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,080
Where's Lin?!

745
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,800
Hey! Hey!

746
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,000
Gotcha!

747
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,920
Just looking out
for number one.

748
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,800
No!

749
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,920
The kid got the seal!

750
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,320
Chon!

751
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,240
lt's stuck.

752
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,080
Lin!

753
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,920
Go! You can do it!

754
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,200
She's got it.

755
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,280
She's got it!

756
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,720
Roy! Come on!

757
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,080
Chon, what in our history
together

758
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,520
makes you think l'm capable
of something like that?

759
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,120
-Roy!
-l can't do that!

760
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,040
Hurry up!

761
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,000
Wait.

762
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,720
There's a better way.

763
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,880
Slow down!

764
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,320
l'm a bat out of hell!

765
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,040
Yee-haw!

766
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,400
Besides, l don't know
where the brake is.

767
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,440
What?!

768
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,760
Look out!

769
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,360
So, what now, buddy?

770
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,680
Relax, relax.
Smooth sailing from here.

771
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,560
Yes, these are the men
who attacked me.

772
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,720
l'm afraid the assailants have
temporarily eluded us, my Lord.

773
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,640
Perhaps you could explain
to me

774
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,640
how Loony Lin
managed to escape

775
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,240
from the confines of
Scotland Yard under the watch

776
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:57,600
of the most respected
police force in the world.

777
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,640
Yes, of course.
lt's absolutely fascinating.

778
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,720
She picked the lock

779
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,040
using a deck of rather
risque playing cards.

780
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,240
Then scaled the walls
with a mop, a fork...

781
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,600
and various pilfered
undergarments.

782
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,280
You've got to hand it
to the Chinese.

783
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,840
They're awfully ingenious,
Lord, aren't they?

784
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,400
Does your incompetence know
no bounds?!

785
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,480
Where am l?

786
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,720
Lin!

787
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,840
l don't even know these women.

788
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,520
Lin, what are you doing here?

789
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,280
Oh, Lord.

790
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,080
Do you want to try
the position on page 3 7?

791
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,160
Come here, you little minx.

792
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,840
What?

793
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,800
-You okay?
-No, l'm not okay.

794
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,120
l've just been violated
by a barnyard animal.

795
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,520
Who would leave a pile of stones
in the middle of the field?

796
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,520
l don't know, Chon.
These people are nuts.

797
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,360
Come on.

798
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,560
-Can l tell you something?
-What?

799
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,880
This is a hell
of a damn adventure we're on.

800
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,080
l'm having
an absolute ball with you.

801
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,760
Me too.

802
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,120
Here we go.

803
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,960
Get your thumb out, maharaja.

804
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,440
-Why?
-Get over here.

805
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,120
Excuse me!

806
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,240
-Lin!
-Lin!

807
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,400
My shoulder's getting
a little tight.

808
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,920
This is your first time
in England, isn't it?

809
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,680
How do you know your way around?
lt's incredible.

810
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,080
l always had a good sense
of direction.

811
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,960
You can say that again.

812
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,200
l wish we could say the same
about you-know-who.

813
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,920
l once sent him over
a mountain range.

814
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,320
He was lost forever.

815
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,880
One time, l sent him
over the Great Wall.

816
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,560
-He was lost for three days.
-Three days?!

817
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,760
Oh, gosh, we got a lot
in common.

818
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,160
l've never met
anybody like you, Roy.

819
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,000
-Really?
-Yeah.

820
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,600
Hey, can l tell you something
without you getting offended?

821
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,920
What?

822
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
You have a great body.

823
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,880
There. l said it.
lt's out in the open.

824
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,600
-You must work out.
-Me?

825
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,800
Excuse me.

826
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,240
Chon, what are you doing?

827
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,600
l don't like the backseat.

828
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,840
Makes me sick. Dizzy.

829
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,160
Whitechapel.

830
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,560
This looks like
a nice enough neighborhood.

831
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,080
-What is Puss 'n' Boots?
-lt's a boardinghouse.

832
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,400
Some of the sailors on the ship
coming over recommended it.

833
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,120
Come on. Come on!

834
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,640
l won't let my sister
stay here.

835
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,760
What are we supposed to do?
Check in to the Savoy?

836
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,560
We'll get arrested
before we get to our room.

837
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,240
l don't mind this place.

838
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,760
See?
She's a little open-minded.

839
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,200
l know this sounds crazy
'cause l just met her...

840
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,960
but l think l'm falling for her.

841
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,200
l think she's the one.

842
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,920
Roy, she's my baby sister.

843
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,960
l know she is.
Thank God!

844
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,360
That's the only chance
l've got.

845
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,320
l'm getting ready
to launch a little thing

846
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,080
called
"Operation Sweep Her Off Her Feet."

847
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,120
You're in a position
to talk me up.

848
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,480
Can l count on you?

849
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,520
Please, buddy, l've never
asked you for anything.

850
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,880
Sure, Roy.
l'll tell her the truth.

851
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,240
Don't get hung up on the truth.

852
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,760
Feel free to smooth out
your old pal's rough edges.

853
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,760
l love you, buddy.

854
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,920
Lin. Come.

855
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,720
Sit.

856
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,680
Hello, love.

857
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,080
Fancy a tumble?

858
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,200
Oh!
Where were you two days ago?

859
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,360
l would have bedded you
in a second.

860
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,000
Now you're looking
at a changed man.

861
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,960
l'm sort of saving myself
for someone special.

862
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,800
l'll give you a discount.

863
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,160
That's the most romantic thing
any woman's ever said to me.

864
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,320
You better go.

865
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,440
You better go
before we lose control. Go!

866
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,600
lf you change your mind...

867
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,680
Roy!

868
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,960
Our father would talk about
the right man for you.

869
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,880
He must be strong,
courageous...

870
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,400
and a good father.

871
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,760
-Like Roy.
-We got her, Chon.

872
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,520
Not like Roy.

873
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,280
You don't know him like l do.

874
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,120
He has many bad habits.

875
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,280
Such as?

876
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,960
He drinks, smokes,
and he gambles.

877
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,560
Chon, where are you
going with this?

878
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,480
He sleeps with women for money.

879
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,760
What are you --

880
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,600
Roy don't do that.
l can see inside him.

881
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,040
He has a good heart.

882
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,160
That's right.

883
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,480
His salmon don't swim
upstream.

884
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,800
He shoots blanks.

885
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,480
Lin, he cannot be trusted.

886
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,880
How could you say that?
You're his friend.

887
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,320
Yeah, sort of.

888
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,760
Roy is the type of a friend

889
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,080
you'd never introduce
to your other friends

890
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,840
or bring home to your family.

891
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,520
He never speak the truth.
You know what l call him?

892
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,320
Not Roy O'Bannon.
Roy O'Baloney.

893
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,440
l don't care.

894
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,520
Lin, l forbid it.

895
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,440
You are not my father.

896
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,800
Roy, there you are.

897
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,320
-Hi.
-Mm-hmm.

898
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,360
You need anything, buddy?

899
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,400
A whole lot of
"leave me alone."

900
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,120
What's wrong?

901
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,280
Nothing.

902
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,200
l woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

903
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,280
l feel a little pain in my back
like someone put a knife there.

904
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,040
l'm okay.

905
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,880
Don't worry about me.

906
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,520
Roy!

907
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,560
That actually reminds me
of a trick.

908
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,520
You ever seen this one?!

909
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,680
Or this one?!

910
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,240
You think you're so cool
with your karate

911
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,800
and your childlike reflexes.

912
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,480
Roy, you okay?

913
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,120
Look at you.

914
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,000
Do you really call me
Roy Baloney?

915
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,640
Roy, you don't understand.

916
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,440
You just smashed
my puzzle box.

917
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,440
l'll never figure out
my message.

918
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,280
-Roy...
-Go.

919
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,960
You're dead to me.

920
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,320
l don't know a Chon Wang.

921
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,720
What?

922
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,920
Hi, Roy.

923
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,640
Who loves you, baby?

924
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,280
-Nice try, Chon.
-Roy...

925
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,960
l'm sorry.

926
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,680
You do that again,
and you're a dead man.

927
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,040
Pillow fight!

928
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,120
l am Roy Baloney!

929
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,160
Yes!

930
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,200
l'm full of it!

931
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,520
You are!

932
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,360
Roy?

933
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,880
-Roy?

934
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:28,840
Lin!

935
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,440
lt was his idea.

936
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,920
-Chon!
-Clothes!

937
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,800
Nice night for a walk.

938
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,120
Lin!

939
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,600
-Lin!
-There you are!

940
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,640
What are you doing?

941
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,240
Don't you know there's
a serial killer on the loose?

942
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,000
Forget it.

943
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,440
Who the hell are these guys?

944
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,400
Boxers.

945
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,840
What do they want with us?

946
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,040
They're with me.

947
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,640
l think we need to have
a little chat.

948
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,800
Chon Wang --

949
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,520
the man who can fight
an emperor.

950
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,160
The emperor should never have
his burial knife.

951
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,800
l see.

952
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,200
You're still
my brother's lapdog.

953
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,040
l'm here not for him.

954
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,800
l'm here for my father.

955
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,680
Of course you are.

956
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:20,080
lt was my dagger
that plunged into his heart.

957
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,080
lt's still crusted
with his blood.

958
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,000
l know the boy has the seal.

959
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,200
Where is he?

960
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,280
We don't know.

961
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,200
That's the truth --
we don't know.

962
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,040
Mmm...

963
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,360
What are you --
What are you doing?

964
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,640
Stop! Put her down!

965
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,160
Put her down!
Put her down!

966
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,920
Or what, Mr. O'Bannon?

967
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,240
Are you gonna kick my ass?

968
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:53,440
l've read all about
your ridiculous exploits.

969
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,880
l mean, just...

970
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,040
how does it feel to kill
a mummy with your bare hands?

971
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,240
Only a nation
of uneducated rednecks

972
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,840
would be amused
by such cowboy drivel.

973
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy.

974
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,120
What's with
the personal attacks?

975
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,800
You don't see me
making any comments

976
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,120
about your pasty complexion
or your snotty accent

977
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,080
or even your filthy,
smutty sex books.

978
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,080
Yeah, l saw your book.
lt disgusted me.

979
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,920
Oh, why is it always the head
with you people?!

980
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,120
Hold it! Stop! Hold it!

981
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,240
Just hold it!

982
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,120
What are we doing here?
Guys, look at this.

983
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,720
We're acting like animals...
over what?

984
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,960
Some seal?

985
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,520
The seal represents
imperial power.

986
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,840
l will use it to unite
the emperor's enemies

987
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,760
and storm the Forbidden City.

988
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,200
What's in it for you?

989
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,400
You're looking
at the future king of England.

990
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,280
You're, like, 20th in line
to the throne.

991
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,560
10th.

992
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,680
But my friend
is about to change all that

993
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,000
by simple...
process of elimination.

994
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,960
lt's called a machine gun.

995
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:05,200
The first of its kind --
it fires 200 rounds a minute.

996
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,480
Testament to British ingenuity.

997
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,240
Oh, so you steal the seal,

998
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,320
and then you knock off
nine royals?

999
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,480
You got the short end
of that stick, my friend.

1000
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,800
Dump them in the river.

1001
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,960
Where are you taking her?

1002
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,840
To make history.

1003
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,000
l can already see
the headlines --

1004
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:33,080
"Nation mourns as Loony Lin
massacres royal family."

1005
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:50,640
l need your assurance
that you will find the seal.

1006
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,280
Don't concern yourself.

1007
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,280
My men are scouring the city.

1008
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:59,200
You better pray they find it...
or our agreement is over,

1009
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:03,480
and you will never get
the crown.

1010
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,560
Chon, l got a confession
to make.

1011
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,720
You are in love
with my sister.

1012
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,720
Well, that, but...

1013
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,400
l didn't lose all the money
on the zeppelins.

1014
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,800
No?

1015
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,000
Nah. l blew most of it
on the Roy O'Bannon novels.

1016
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,480
l wrote them.

1017
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,080
No, Sage McCallister
wrote them.

1018
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,200
That's what l'm saying, buddy.
l'm Sage McCallister.

1019
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,440
You wrote those lies?!

1020
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,320
l've always had
low self-esteem.

1021
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,800
How many books did you print?

1022
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,960
l self-published
probably a million copies.

1023
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,880
We were actually second
to the Bible that year.

1024
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,760
Oh, you --

1025
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,880
l guess l'm just about
the worst friend

1026
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,000
a guy could ask for.

1027
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,520
No, you're a good friend.

1028
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,640
Thank you.

1029
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,960
lf you really love Lin,
l won't stand in the way.

1030
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,080
Really?

1031
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:05,200
But if you break her heart...
l'll break your legs.

1032
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,360
That's fair.

1033
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,920
Well,
friends to the end, Chon...

1034
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,600
and this is the end.

1035
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,480
Chon, you got a plan?

1036
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,960
You wouldn't happen to have
a plan, would you?

1037
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,040
Yes.

1038
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,840
-Anything l can do?
-No.

1039
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,600
Good. l'll let you do
the heavy lifting, then.

1040
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,760
Chon, hurry.

1041
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,000
Chon!

1042
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,080
Chon! Chon, hurry!

1043
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,280
Hurry!

1044
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,960
Hurry! Chon, hurry!

1045
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,000
Roy!

1046
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,120
Coming!

1047
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,720
Chon!

1048
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,720
The water's so dirty!

1049
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,840
No! No! lt's dirty! No!

1050
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,760
Just go ahead and drown me.
l don't care anymore.

1051
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:41,800
Roy!

1052
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,000
You look ridiculous.

1053
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,080
l think we look good.

1054
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,240
l really must protest
this intrusion.

1055
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:52,320
Every bobby in London is out
scouring the streets

1056
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,280
for you two.

1057
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,720
Have you been drinking?

1058
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:58,000
l always drink when my
employment's been terminated.

1059
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,080
They fired you?

1060
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,000
Lord Rathbone saw to that.

1061
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,040
l'm sorry.

1062
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,480
lt's of no consequence.

1063
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,800
l never wanted to be
an inspector in the first place.

1064
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,200
lt was my father's idea.

1065
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,360
l always wanted to be
a writer.

1066
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,480
Yeah.

1067
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,240
Artie, we need your help.

1068
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,800
Rathbone has taken Lin.

1069
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,280
He's gonna kill
the royal family

1070
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,720
and he's gonna assume
the throne.

1071
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,160
Do you have any evidence

1072
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,120
to support these
preposterous allegations?

1073
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,760
We have this.
lt's the boy's.

1074
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,480
Use your technique.
Tell us where he is.

1075
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,720
Paraffin wax --
most interesting.

1076
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,160
He's at a church.

1077
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,960
The little punk's hiding
in a church.

1078
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,480
No, no, no.

1079
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,400
lt's not candle wax.

1080
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,560
l have it.

1081
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,920
-Don't worry. You'll get it.
-What are you doing?

1082
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,840
-He's picking the lock.
-Well, hurry up!

1083
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,040
Chon, please! Please.
lt's a very meticulous process.

1084
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,400
Let Artie do his job.
lt's almost an art form.

1085
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,480
lt takes the precision
of a surgeon.

1086
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,720
You have to be so precise.

1087
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,000
Maybe if we jam
another one in there.

1088
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,760
That works, too.

1089
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,960
Lacks a certain finesse.

1090
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,440
All right, all right.
Let's split up.

1091
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,520
What the...

1092
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,400
l am gonna break your neck.

1093
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,240
Come here.

1094
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,560
Looky here.

1095
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,640
-Come on, where is it?
-What?

1096
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,280
You know
what l'm talking about.

1097
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,720
Don't give me that "what."

1098
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:16,640
What do we got here?

1099
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,320
Oh, yes.

1100
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,600
You don't mind
if l take this back, do you?

1101
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,160
Go on.
Get out of here.

1102
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,120
Go!

1103
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,120
Roy?

1104
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,360
l got it.

1105
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,920
Give me the seal.

1106
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,920
Give me the seal!

1107
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,240
All right, spread out!

1108
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,400
Through there!

1109
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,000
Let's go.

1110
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,720
The gig's up.

1111
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,640
So, what are we gonna do?

1112
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,560
Come on, think!

1113
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,800
l'm not going
to an English prison.

1114
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,600
With my feathery blond hair
and Chon's athletic build,

1115
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,520
they'll try to make us
the belle of the ball.

1116
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,560
Forget it.
l'm not going back.

1117
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,920
Well, at least we'll get
a good view of the fireworks

1118
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,200
from Scotland Yard.

1119
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,080
-Fireworks?
-Yeah.

1120
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,480
At midnight, they're launching
this huge display

1121
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,240
from a flotilla of barges
on the Thames.

1122
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,120
lt's the official kickoff
to the Queen's Jubilee.

1123
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,000
ls the royal family
gonna be there?

1124
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:46,360
They're gonna be viewing
the spectacle from a balcony

1125
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,840
overlooking the river.

1126
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,800
He's got a machine gun
on the barge.

1127
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,560
Yes.

1128
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,080
You gents lost your way?

1129
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,640
Kid, tell me
you got a way out.

1130
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,240
Nice move, kid.

1131
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,640
So why did you come back?

1132
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,200
Why did you give up the seal?

1133
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,360
'Cause l'm a fool.

1134
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,600
Guess l'm a fool, too.

1135
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,720
Well, put her there, fool.

1136
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,000
l never got your name.

1137
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:37,120
Name's Chaplin...

1138
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,160
Charlie Chaplin.

1139
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,600
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

1140
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,720
Excuse me, please!

1141
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,560
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

1142
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,040
You warn the royal family.

1143
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,080
l'll save Lin.

1144
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,960
How on earth are you gonna
do that?

1145
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,000
You okay?

1146
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,200
l just saved you!

1147
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,320
You were late!

1148
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,320
What?!

1149
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,960
Nelson?

1150
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,240
Why are you hiding yourself
back there?

1151
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,440
l shouldn't like to impede
your view, Your Highness.

1152
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,280
Nonsense.
You arranged all this.

1153
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,160
You should have
a front-row view.

1154
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:57,600
l regret that, uh,
respectfully l must decline.

1155
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:00,240
l need to keep a good eye
on proceedings.

1156
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,080
Nelson,
you've outdone yourself.

1157
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,520
Wait till you see the finale.

1158
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,240
Hey!

1159
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,160
Hey!

1160
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,800
This is hopeless.

1161
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,720
We're not gonna get past
the guards.

1162
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,320
Well, not with that attitude
we won't.

1163
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,240
Come on, Artie.
There's got to be a way.

1164
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,200
There's always --

1165
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,360
Lin!

1166
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,000
Yee-haw! Yeah!

1167
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,720
Yee-haw!

1168
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,120
Yee-haw!

1169
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,680
We got to jump it!

1170
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:24,320
Wu Chow!

1171
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,440
Hold it right there,
Rathboner.

1172
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:46,600
l'm guessing
by your hasty retreat

1173
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,000
that you're still
20th in line for the throne.

1174
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,240
10th.

1175
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,560
lnspector Doyle,
arrest this man.

1176
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,080
He's got a gun!

1177
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:00,840
Come on!

1178
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,040
-Oh!
-You okay?

1179
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,320
What happened?

1180
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,680
Rathbone nailed Artie
with a little sissy gun.

1181
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,960
l'll look after him.
You two go.

1182
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,720
Go!

1183
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,760
For Father.

1184
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,680
For Father.

1185
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,400
For Old Man Wang.

1186
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:31,400
Oh, my lucky playing cards.

1187
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:41,240
Be careful.

1188
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,000
Tell Rathbone to be careful.

1189
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,960
Roy, let's go.

1190
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,560
You're gonna need
a bigger gun!

1191
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,080
You see him?

1192
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,480
No.

1193
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,360
Show your face, Rathbone!

1194
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,800
l'm gonna tear this guy apart.

1195
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,160
Roy, you go this way.
l'll go that way.

1196
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:22,800
Split up? l don't know
if that's a good idea.

1197
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:23,960
lt's okay.

1198
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,720
He's not up here.

1199
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,880
Roy, keep going.

1200
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,320
Aw, come on, Roy.

1201
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,000
Hey, uh, Rathbone...

1202
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,200
l was just thinking
of a title for my new book...

1203
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,800
"Roy O'Bannon
vs. Little Lord Sissy."

1204
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:08,360
But what about "Roy O'Bannon vs.
The Man Who Would Be Queen"?

1205
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,800
No sign of him, Chon.

1206
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,960
The coast is clear up here.

1207
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:21,840
Roy! Look out!

1208
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:25,360
Roy!

1209
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:26,640
Oops.

1210
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,840
Come on up.

1211
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,960
l'll show you
how your father died.

1212
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,480
Lord, help me.

1213
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,040
Just let me know you're there.
Love me. Hate me.

1214
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,320
But let me know
you're up there!

1215
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,560
Hey, l can see our hotel
from here.

1216
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,760
Come along.

1217
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,480
l'm waiting.

1218
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,640
Come on, Roy. Okay.

1219
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:43,720
Roy O'Bannon
will not go quietly.

1220
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,080
You hear that, England?!

1221
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,840
Throw whatever
you want at me --

1222
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,720
your terrible weather,
your perverted killers,

1223
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,680
your Spotted Dick!

1224
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,560
Roy, you're about to die.

1225
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:31,000
You're on the minute hand
of a clock.

1226
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:34,440
My life is flashing
before my eyes.

1227
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:37,360
Wait a minute.
l don't remember her.

1228
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,280
One more.

1229
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,000
One more.

1230
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,880
How disappointing.

1231
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:42,920
One more.

1232
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:56,560
You killed my friend.

1233
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,840
You killed my father!

1234
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,800
Roy!

1235
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:27,200
l thought you were dead!
Oh!

1236
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,680
You think
some tea-drinking psycho

1237
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,640
can take out Roy O'Bannon?

1238
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,720
Easy there, cowboy.

1239
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,640
You got any ideas?

1240
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,520
-We jump!
-Jump?!

1241
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,320
You mean fall?!

1242
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,080
Aim for the flag!

1243
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,680
Aw, shit.

1244
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,560
l got to tell you something.

1245
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:25,680
What?

1246
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:28,520
You're the best sidekick
l could ever ask for.

1247
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:31,640
Thank you, Roy.
l feel the same about you.

1248
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,120
On three.

1249
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,280
One...

1250
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,680
Two...

1251
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:37,440
-Three!
-Three!

1252
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,640
Roy. Roy!

1253
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,520
Howdy.

1254
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:16,000
ln recognition
of outstanding bravery,

1255
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,120
l dub you Sir Chon Wang.

1256
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,240
For uncommon valor,

1257
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:29,600
l dub you Sir Roy O'Bannon.

1258
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,400
And for steadfast dedication
to justice,

1259
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,560
l dub you
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

1260
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:48,360
Arise.

1261
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,800
Who loves you, baby?

1262
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,160
Madam.

1263
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:27,400
Artie, l bet Scotland Yard's
dying to get you back now.

1264
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,560
My official
crime-fighting days are over.

1265
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:30,720
The queen has asked me

1266
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,000
to accompany the lmperial Seal
back to China.

1267
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,440
What a week.
Unbelievable.

1268
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,360
She couldn't have picked
a better man, right, Chon?

1269
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:37,440
Yeah.

1270
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,400
And the voyage is gonna give me
time to work on my new novel.

1271
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,600
lt features a new kind
of detective,

1272
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:45,520
and he's gonna solve crimes
using deductive reasoning.

1273
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,120
Give me a name.
What's his name?

1274
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:48,600
Actually, Roy,
l was rather hoping

1275
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:51,240
to call him Sherlock Holmes,
if that's all right with you.

1276
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,160
l'd be insulted
if you didn't use it.

1277
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,000
-Ta.
-See you, Artie.

1278
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,160
That was very nice
of you, Roy.

1279
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:09,400
l would've kept the name
if l thought it was any good.

1280
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:11,000
lt's a horrible name
for a detective --

1281
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,160
Sherlock Holmes. Holmes?

1282
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,440
Will you stop playing with that?
l'm gonna smash it.

1283
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:17,720
l just want to see it
for a second.

1284
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,720
-Just let me see it.
-No, you're gonna break it.

1285
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:23,640
lt's just a rock
with some gibberish on it.

1286
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,160
That's Chinese.

1287
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,920
"Family is forever, my son.

1288
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,720
l'm proud
you cast your own stone."

1289
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:35,520
That's a good message.

1290
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:45,320
l'd like to cast
my own stone, Chon.

1291
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:53,600
-Hi.
-Hi.

1292
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:01,560
l told you -- the house
of O'Bannon will prevail.

1293
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,280
Chon, l got a business
proposition for you.

1294
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,160
No more zeppelins.

1295
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:12,920
No, no, this is much better
than zeppelins --

1296
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,760
a new thing they're starting
out in California

1297
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,200
called moving pictures.

1298
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:17,240
Pass.

1299
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,800
Hold it. Hold it.
Hear me out.

1300
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,120
l really think these movies
could play to your strength.

1301
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:22,080
There's no sound,

1302
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:24,160
so we don't have to worry
about the language problem.

1303
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:27,840
And l think the kung fu stuff
could be huge.

1304
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,000
People are dying
for a good action picture.

1305
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,600
What do you think?

1306
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:34,480
Chon Wang, movie star?

1307
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,920
lt could work.

1308
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:39,120
l feel bad about ditching
that Chaplin kid,

1309
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,440
but we're gonna be running
and gunning in Hollywood,

1310
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:43,880
and he'd just cramp our style.

1311
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,000
lt's such a tough town.

1312
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:03,720
Bloody tourists!

1313
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,240
Action!

1314
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:22,960
You have to say "cut."

1315
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,240
You just keep looking!

1316
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,720
Come here, you little minx.

1317
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:36,960
Cut.

1318
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,400
That was good.

1319
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:40,080
That was a good one, huh?

1320
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:44,880
Maybe on this one
l should lick you...you think?

1321
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,920
Like, after you lick me --
that could be kind of good.

1322
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,720
And, Jackie...

1323
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,840
Jackie?

1324
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:52,720
Thank you. Hi, Owen.

1325
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:53,880
Hello. How are you?

1326
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:56,280
Okay, and l'm not
Roy O'Bannon.

1327
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,400
Who are you?

1328
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,720
Damn it, Chon,
l think she's the one.

1329
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,320
l know it's crazy.
We just met, but she's the one.

1330
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:06,080
No, Roy,
she's my babysitter.

1331
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,680
Your babys--

1332
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,280
What?

1333
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,760
Baby what?

1334
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:13,920
Baby sister.

1335
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,480
Baby sister?

1336
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,720
Not babysitter.
Baby sister.

1337
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:30,960
You okay?

1338
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,520
Action!

1339
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:37,800
What happened?

1340
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:40,400
Roy is the type of a friend
you never introduce

1341
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,080
to your other friends
or bring into your family.

1342
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:46,600
He's -- Look at his eyes.
They're brown -- full of shit.

1343
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:48,360
Always...

1344
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:50,280
Just bullshit all the time.

1345
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,840
Yeah, have you ever heard
of those?

1346
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:54,280
They're parents.
We have parents that love us.

1347
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:56,680
You don't,
'cause you're a little orphan.

1348
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:01,480
You don't --
We've got par-- Yeah, parents.

1349
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:03,880
Have you ever heard of those?
We've got parents that love us.

1350
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,600
But you don't,
'cause you're a little orphan.

1351
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,600
Oh, go on.

1352
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,880
So mean.

1353
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:16,040
Chon Wang, movie star?

1354
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:17,320
lt could work.

1355
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:20,040
lt could work.
You could do your own stunts.

1356
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:21,800
What? My own stunts?

1357
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,240
Whoa! Whoa!

1358
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:33,800
Stay here and be a good horsey
for the new sheriff.

1359
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,640
That hurt.

1360
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,720
You're supposed to catch me!

1361
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:56,880
Roy, catch.

1362
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:05,960
-Jesus.
-That's my fault.

1363
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:07,360
Wait a second.

1364
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,760
This nut is killing
your street women?

1365
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,680
Who did that?

1366
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:16,720
Jackie Chan.

1367
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:17,720
Me?

1368
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,000
That's right.

1369
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,280
-That was the...
-First time.

1370
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:24,200
-The best take.
-l'm sorry.

1371
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:25,520
Hurry up!

1372
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,160
Are you crazy?!
l can't do that!

1373
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:29,600
This isn't Chinatown!
l can't sail through the air!

1374
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:31,520
-l'm not gonna break my neck!
-Roy!

1375
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:32,800
What in our history together

1376
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,280
makes you think l'm capable
of something like that?

1377
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:36,240
lt's getting bigger!

1378
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:37,360
There's got to be
a better way.

1379
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:38,200
Roy!

1380
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,640
Roy!
