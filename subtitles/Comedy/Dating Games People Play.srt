<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Forget Dating, Give Me The Ring! Team </i>

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,550
<i>I'm okay.
I was really okay. </i>

3
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,080
<i> I usually didn't waver for most things. </i>

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,310
<i> I wasn't really afraid of anything either. </i>

5
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,650
<i> There was no door that wouldn't open with my strength anywhere in the world, </i>

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,470
<i> until I met that girl. </i>

7
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,930
Joo Jang Mi!

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,390
<i> Episode 7
Even though it's not okay, it's okay </i>

9
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,380
Will you really be okay?

10
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,500
- I'll be okay.
- You probably won't be okay.

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,180
It's okay so give it to me.

12
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,080
What is it that you're being like this?

13
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,680
I captured the angle really well, right?

14
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,380
Yes, really.

15
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,670
That's why I said not looking would be better.

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,720
<i> What are you doing right now? </i>

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,950
<i> I'm a fool. </i>

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,710
<i>♬  When I see you, my heart pounds and my lips dry up ♬</i>

19
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,960
<i>♬  Your face flickers before me today ♬</i>

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,750
<i>♬  I can't take it anymore ♬</i>

21
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,740
<i>♬  Starting from tomorrow, we will live happily together ♬</i>

22
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,870
<i> Hey... we... </i>

23
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,940
<i> Be quiet. Your aunt is watching us. </i>

24
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,960
<i> I thought you were kicking me away. </i>

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,040
<i> Because you really</i>

26
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,140
<i> didn't look okay.</i>

27
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,140
<i>♬ Just imagine ♬</i>

28
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,740
<i>♬ I know you want it ♬</i>

29
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,190
Oh, so hot.

30
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,340
<i>♬ The way you talk always mysteriously stays near my ears ♬</i>

31
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,880
<i>♬ My face grows red (and my heart gets excited) ♬</i>

32
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,450
<i>♬ Inside the square bus ♬</i>

33
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,680
<i>♬ I faintly hear a well-known song ♬</i>

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,780
<i>♬ At some point (falling into you) ♬</i>

35
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,420
<i>♬ What’s there to think about? ♬</i>

36
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,090
<i>♬ Wanna walk together now? (boy) ♬</i>

37
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,370
<i>♬ You know but pretend you don’t, I fall in love ♬</i>

38
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,580
<i>♬ Wanna take the subway or walking in the rain ♬</i>

39
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,810
<i>♬ Between the clouds, ♬</i>

40
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,850
<i>♬ as if it’s slippery and slowly ♬</i>

41
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,010
<i>♬ We are already walking ♬</i>

42
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,250
I must be crazy.

43
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,710
Oh, so hot.

44
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,920
<i>♬ Walking in that lane ♬</i>

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,920
<i> What do you mean? </i>

46
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,630
That is love.

47
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,480
Just because it's a different way doesn't mean it isn't love.

48
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,420
Right?

49
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,750
Is that person still putting her neck out for your son's marriage?

50
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,660
Marriage is just one out of many different ways.

51
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,300
Right?

52
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,080
You are a bit old now so why don't you use a person?

53
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,130
Do you need something?

54
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,880
Give me a glass of water.

55
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,270
You know Kang Se Ah...

56
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,510
is there really hope between her and Gi Tae?

57
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,710
You liked Joo Jang Mi.

58
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,440
No, well...

59
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,690
Our Director Lee is trying to date Kang Se Ah

60
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,050
so they're a bit close-

61
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,850
I understand what you're saying.

62
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,410
The villain's role is always my part.

63
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,560
Se Ah.

64
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,120
Hyung, are these mushrooms or truffles?

65
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,950
Don't touch it, you bastard.

66
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,180
- Do you know how much one kilogram of this is?
- I don't know.

67
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,580
Five million won, five million.

68
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,390
Okay.

69
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,670
She's really diligent. She's driving me crazy.

70
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,520
Oh, you're here?

71
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,890
I missed you so much!!

72
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,970
Did you eat breakfast?

73
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,110
Why is this girl like this?

74
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,150
Should we eat something?

75
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,700
Get away from me.

76
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,840
You... I helped you...

77
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,800
Let's sit near the window.

78
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,080
Hey.

79
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,260
I think we need to straighten out what happened yesterday.

80
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,340
I'll straighten it out for you.

81
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,720
The reason why I chose you...

82
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,730
it was because I thought that we would never have useless things like feelings

83
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,130
that formed for each other.

84
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,920
The reason why we are doing this together is just one thing.

85
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,950
Um, that...

86
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,310
so that I could be by myself.

87
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,670
So... that... that...

88
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:54,390
I was hoping you wouldn't approach me if I don't need you

89
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,880
and I wanted to tell you to refrain from touching me uncomfortably.

90
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,840
Did I do it for me? It was all because of you.

91
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,870
I did it to help you.

92
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,200
Linking my arms with you just a moment ago was because your aunt was outside too.

93
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,720
Oh.

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,480
I'm crazy.

95
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,810
Because of this type of guy, my precious lips...

96
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,530
and on top of that in front of Han Yeo Reum.

97
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,860
I know. You were a bit too much.

98
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,290
She kisses anyone anywhere.

99
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,440
- No...
- That's what I'm saying.

100
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,870
It seemed far past necessary. She was probably just carried away by her feelings and-

101
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,500
Hey!

102
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,410
I was just-

103
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,080
I know. I found out roughly enough what type of person Joo Jang Mi is.

104
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,790
Like a fool she likes anyone, gets carried away, and can't even throw them away.

105
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,890
She's someone that ends up kissing a man who doesn't mean anything to her and isn't fun,

106
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,430
like a fool.

107
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,680
What do I not have?

108
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,580
But I like fool-like Joo Jang Mi.

109
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,560
Starting from today, for a month, we are having a truffle festival at Bon Weekend.

110
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,360
There's a special menu prepared with truffles by the chef so try eating it.

111
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,430
- Just a moment ago, that was a confession, right?
- No.

112
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,620
I think it's a confession.

113
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,230
Is there a confession where a girl is called a fool?

114
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,800
<i> Han Yeo Reum
Come at night~! </i>

115
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,750
I should leave. Bye then.

116
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,310
Don't you think the cost of your ingredients are excessive?

117
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,520
It's not even a high dining restaurant but yet you use the best quality truffles? That's excessive.

118
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,600
Our chef is a bit greedy when it comes to his cooking.

119
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,800
Are you sure you aren't harboring rat-like bastards in your kitchen?

120
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,430
Control your employees well.

121
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,660
I feel like I'm doing something bad.

122
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,890
I'm not bad though. I'm just thrilling.

123
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,970
It feels like I'm really secretly meeting a woman who's about to get married. Its fun.

124
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,950
Anyways, for right now, it's going to be hard to meet up.

125
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,760
If they find out it was fake then Gong Gi Tae they said he has to get married to someone he doesn't even like.

126
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,500
I don't really care though.

127
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,170
Because you were thinking of Gong Gi Tae, isn't that why you said to meet at night?

128
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,260
No. Because I want to make something good for you, I told you to come at night.

129
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,570
What is this?

130
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,810
The world's one and only egg custard.

131
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,620
Wait. The most important thing.

132
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,960
The smell is weird!

133
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,100
But it's good!

134
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,470
These are those famous truffles.

135
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,840
Yea, punk! I'm being serious.

136
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,640
The best quality truffles.

137
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,390
Wait a second.

138
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,420
Could it be Gi Tae's aunt?

139
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,400
Let's go!

140
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,800
My boss? He doesn't have time to care.

141
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,820
He doesn't care that I bought such expensive stuff.

142
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,600
Truffles!

143
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,060
Truffles!!

144
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,840
I never once thought of you as my employee. I always considered you as my person.

145
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,030
A person that I trust 100%. My person.

146
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:47,350
But... your response is to step on my trust like dog poop?

147
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,200
- I'm sorry.
- He stepped on $5000.

148
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,340
I kept wondering who it was that entered the kitchen secretly, I guess the bastard was you.

149
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,590
Tell me the truth. The one who has been pilfering the food ingredients is you, right?

150
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,900
Pilfering the ingredients? That wasn't me.

151
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,340
Hey, what do you mean its not you!

152
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,300
In order to seduce a girl, you used the kitchen however you wanted!

153
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,860
But, yea, it's true that I do cook secretly.

154
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,450
I'll honestly admit to what I did.

155
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:18,630
But I only used left over ingredients and the ones that were past their expiration dates.

156
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,780
I used the truffles because I was curious...

157
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,380
but besides that I really didn't touch anything else!

158
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:31,030
It's sad. I really didn't want to look at this.

159
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:36,420
CCTV. If you did something wrong, say it now. I'll forgive you.

160
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,980
I'll take responsibility for my wrongs.

161
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:46,150
Those kids nowadays. Even if they do wrong, they're so brazen about it!

162
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,790
Why don't you just fire him?

163
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,770
But why were you there at that time?

164
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,810
I... um... I... left something here.

165
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:58,000
I forgot my cellphone here.

166
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,040
Ah, right! I forgot I put something on top of the stove. I'll be going now.

167
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,330
Ah, you scared me!

168
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,040
You said you came to get your cellphone?

169
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,900
Yea, why?

170
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,760
When you came in here, you were talking on the phone.

171
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,580
How could you talk on the phone without your cellphone?

172
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,530
What the hell, bastard? Are you investigating me right now?

173
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,130
Where are you going? Aren't you coming back here?

174
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,540
I'm going to get $5000.

175
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,880
Hyeon Hee!

176
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,510
I thought about it a lot but I think it's best if I leave.

177
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:45,240
Even if you guys did break up, you once thought of Hoon Dong oppa as a man you were going to marry.

178
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,210
How could I continue to face you?

179
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,560
Why can't you face me? You can just look straight at me! Don't worry about it! I'm fine.

180
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,440
When I see you, I think of Hoon Dong Oppa.

181
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,190
You were really sincere with Lee Hoon Dong?

182
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,130
I'm sorry unnie.

183
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,400
What should I do?

184
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,170
I'm really sorry.

185
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,330
Hyeon Hee is outside.

186
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,940
Hyeon Hee sincerely likes you.

187
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,560
I thought it was best for Hyeon Hee if she didn't get involved with a guy like you but..

188
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,600
Hyeon Hee says she is dying to see you.

189
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,250
So please go meet her.

190
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,640
Are you okay with that?

191
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,820
With me and Hyeon Hee seeing each other?

192
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,070
Instead, meet her with a sincere heart.

193
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,940
Don't hurt her like you did with me.

194
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,890
How could you do this to me?

195
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:20,610
Lee Hoon Dong, we are done! Just accept it!

196
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,910
Because we're over, you do this?

197
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:30,580
In my restaurant, behind my back, you and Yeo Reum were lovey-dovey.

198
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,810
That must have been really fun.

199
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,910
Sorry, I didn't mean to do it like that.

200
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,510
But where's Han Yeo Reum?... You fired him!?

201
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,970
Are you worrying about that bastard in front of me right now?!

202
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,600
Han Yeo Reum did nothing wrong! It was because I had a situation...

203
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,040
Wow, you sure are an amazing woman!

204
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,730
During the day, you talk about marrying a Plastic Surgeon who happens to be my closet friend.

205
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,050
At night, you enjoy time with a younger flower boy who happens to be

206
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:04,660
<i>the part time employee who gets paid by me. On top of that it happens to be in my restaurant where you hide and secretly</i>

207
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,160
- date?
- I'm sorry,

208
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,940
but what you see isn't everything.

209
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,560
-To be honest...
- Don't say anymore.

210
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,580
My heart will just get hurt.

211
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,610
Wait!

212
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,200
Where are you going?

213
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,150
Sorry, Ms. Nam Hyeon Hee. I had someone else in my heart and I messed with you.

214
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,850
I'm trash.

215
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,130
Oppa.

216
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,840
Hey, Lee Hoon Dong!

217
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,400
Having two girls in one heart is a terrible thing to do.

218
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,130
And, two-timing.

219
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:51,460
Even if I were to die and come back alive, I can't comfortably two time with someone who is friends with Jang Mi.

220
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,010
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,030
Hey, Lee Hoon Dong!

222
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,230
What did I tell you?

223
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,640
I didn't want to do it.

224
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,630
Hyeon Hee...

225
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,850
I hate you, unnie.

226
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,720
Ugh, I'm going crazy!

227
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,620
I don't care at all!

228
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,820
You don't care at all?

229
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,680
Marriage and dating aren't different things.

230
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,600
There's no point in caring about a guy like Han Yeo Reum. Even if they date, at the most, it'll only last for about two months.

231
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,480
So I just leave them alone.

232
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,840
You really like Joo Jang Mi, right?

233
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,130
- It's heartbreaking. Just heartbreaking.
- What do you mean heartbreaking? Me?

234
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,920
Hey, I've met you for a while.

235
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,250
You're acting that cool and unaffected because you want to keep Joo Jang Mi next to you.

236
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,310
What is Joo Jang Mi? Is she that great?

237
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,360
I'm not acting cool, I am cool.

238
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,100
You say at the most two months but I know just by looking at you how you fuss about Han Yeo Reum.

239
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,460
You seem to care a lot.

240
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,350
I really don't care!

241
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,880
Your mother is already snooping around and really cares.

242
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,940
- My mother did?
- We talked on the phone earlier.

243
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,970
She asked a lot about Han Yeo Reum so

244
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:12,270
- I was going to show her what those two were exactly doing that was caught on the CCTV.
- You can't!

245
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,410
That's what I was going to do but didn't.

246
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,310
Please I beg you. Keep your mouth shut around my mom.

247
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,580
Aigoo, you like Joo Jang Mi to that extent?

248
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,440
Are you okay?

249
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,710
I'm fine.

250
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,110
Go ahead and go.

251
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,850
Joo Jang Mi.

252
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,670
What happened?

253
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,860
Don't worry, I didn't get fired.

254
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,530
That..

255
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,420
But I've been kicked to the streets instead.

256
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,850
The price of the truffles that we ate turns out to be all of my fortune.

257
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,040
Did you pay it back with deposit money?

258
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,290
Sorry..because of me..

259
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,900
If you are sorry, will you let me sleep at your place?

260
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,050
<i> Ah..You like Joo Jang Mi that much? </i>

261
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,600
No...no..

262
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,930
Never.

263
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:05,562
<i>You...really like Joo Jang Mi, huh?</i>

264
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:20,422
Oh, you are home. I kept ringing the bell. Didn't you hear it?

265
00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:34,882
Do me a favor.

266
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:38,092
Come in.

267
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:43,092
Hello, hyungnim.

268
00:21:47,552 --> 00:21:49,342
What is this!?

269
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:52,062
Let Han Yeo Reum sleep here.

270
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:54,512
What?

271
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:57,662
Wow..the house is nice.

272
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:07,142
Why...

273
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:14,792
Ah..hyung.

274
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:19,612
Hey! Gong Gi Tae, are really going to be like this? Think about what I've done for you.

275
00:22:19,612 --> 00:22:22,262
What have you done for me? For bothering me? For annoying me?

276
00:22:22,262 --> 00:22:25,572
- Or pissing me off?
- For helping you with your fake marriage.

277
00:22:25,572 --> 00:22:29,322
And I wasted my precious lips too!

278
00:22:32,982 --> 00:22:38,692
What was the purpose of the fake marriage? I definitely told you it was so that I can live alone!

279
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:49,232
What did I tell you? Even a needle's tip wouldn't go through him.

280
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:52,412
That jerk!

281
00:23:01,032 --> 00:23:02,952
<i>Kang Se Ah</i>

282
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:10,412
-What?
-You're still mad, huh?

283
00:23:10,412 --> 00:23:12,522
You're home, right? I'm going to drop by for a bit.

284
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:14,282
Don't come. I want to be alone.

285
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:17,182
You're alone? That's good,

286
00:23:17,182 --> 00:23:20,192
He says he's alone, mother.

287
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:23,392
-My mom?
- She made cucumber kimchi to give to you

288
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,342
but she hesitated because she was worried that it might bother you if you were with Joo Jang Mi.

289
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:31,242
Even if your mom cares for you, she cares for you too much.

290
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:34,342
It's a waste so I brought her with me.

291
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:42,012
Joo Jang Mi..Han Yeo Reum..

292
00:23:48,202 --> 00:23:50,992
Do you have anywhere you can go?

293
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,842
For the time being, I'll just go to the sauna.

294
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:57,292
I feel so sorry. What do I do?

295
00:23:57,292 --> 00:24:00,312
- I'll try to get the $5000 as fast as I can.
- It's fine.

296
00:24:00,312 --> 00:24:01,702
If I accept that money, I'm not cool.

297
00:24:01,702 --> 00:24:03,162
It's all because of me.

298
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:06,292
It's because of me that Gi Tae hyung is making it difficult for you. Anyways,

299
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:10,272
Kang Se Ah finding out about the secret was because of me, so let's call it even.

300
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,772
Hey, why are you guys still here?

301
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:17,592
Hey, Han Yeo Reum did it for our sake!

302
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:21,312
We were just about to leave. Let's go.

303
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:24,502
What are you doing?

304
00:24:24,502 --> 00:24:27,312
-Mother is coming, mother.
-Go in! Go in!

305
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:34,502
Ah, great.

306
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:39,342
You've arrived, mother?

307
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:42,342
Ah.

308
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:46,122
You weren't alone?

309
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:48,822
I meant that I didn't want to be disturbed.

310
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:54,742
Anyways, thanks for coming out together.

311
00:24:54,742 --> 00:24:55,772
I came to see her off.

312
00:24:55,772 --> 00:24:58,302
You're not supposed to do that to someone who came to see you.

313
00:24:58,302 --> 00:25:01,502
What were you thinking of bringing Se Ah over. You think I don't know you're intentions?

314
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:06,652
If mother had intentions, it would be to make sure her son is living well and eating well.

315
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:08,912
What's that?

316
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:13,722
I'm sorry, but take it back. Since it'll just be thrown away without being eaten.

317
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:18,312
-Gong Gi Tae..
- It's so wasteful, why throw it away?

318
00:25:18,312 --> 00:25:23,772
Don't worry. I will clean everything off and eat it all.

319
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:31,762
If you were going to bring side dishes you could have told me. Why did you come with Se Ah?

320
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:35,932
That's because I've been friends with Se Ah for some time.

321
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:38,352
Not because you hate me?

322
00:25:40,002 --> 00:25:43,752
You're against me, right?

323
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:51,492
If you're going to be against me like this,

324
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:57,442
our Gi Tae may have to live alone forever.

325
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:02,952
You dare..to threaten me?

326
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:07,352
I'm just worried. The Gong family might end.

327
00:26:08,142 --> 00:26:13,662
Don't worry. I'm not against you, it's a misconception.

328
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:18,432
Then that's a relief. I want to be closer to you.

329
00:26:18,432 --> 00:26:21,792
Going shopping, eating good food,

330
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:25,262
leaving the manner-less Gong Gi Tae out, let us girls have a date sometime.

331
00:26:25,262 --> 00:26:27,422
Ugh, don't.

332
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:29,302
Let's go.

333
00:26:29,302 --> 00:26:32,282
Bye, Mother-in-law.

334
00:26:32,282 --> 00:26:34,242
Go ahead and go.

335
00:26:40,462 --> 00:26:45,912
I'll make sure you will live alone for the rest of your life but just live with him for a few days.

336
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:52,182
If mother sees Han Yeo Reum and I walking down the street together.

337
00:26:52,182 --> 00:26:56,632
It seems she's been keeping an eye on us. How are you going to explain that to her?

338
00:26:57,822 --> 00:26:59,252
Huh?

339
00:27:04,262 --> 00:27:06,702
Whoa..this is nice.

340
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:10,442
- Ugh, that Gong Gi Tae, really?
- Touching anything in this house is forbidden!

341
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:14,682
Ah..Nemo. Nemo-ah, hi! Unnie is here again.

342
00:27:17,362 --> 00:27:20,382
Woah, the bathroom is so cool!

343
00:27:20,382 --> 00:27:22,712
Bathroom is forbidden!

344
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:27,182
I'm hungry, do you want to order something to eat? I'll buy.

345
00:27:27,182 --> 00:27:29,852
Delivery food is not allowed.

346
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:32,662
Ah, my belly.

347
00:27:32,662 --> 00:27:35,902
This..ramen. I'm really good at making ramen.

348
00:27:35,902 --> 00:27:39,062
Searching is forbidden. Eating is forbidden!

349
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:41,882
Don't make the house smell.

350
00:27:41,882 --> 00:27:46,772
- Then what can I do?
- The time that is given to you is from 11 PM to 7 AM, 8 hours total.

351
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:49,632
Where you are allowed is from here...

352
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:53,642
to here. You will only sleep here.

353
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:58,472
Why are you so strict? Why are you making someone be wary of what they do?

354
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:05,592
Oh this is nice. Can't I sleep here?

355
00:28:05,592 --> 00:28:09,842
Please, I wish you would have some sense!

356
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:11,502
Hey!

357
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,622
You're okay, right?

358
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:23,852
You..you still haven't left?

359
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:27,012
Get along nicely.

360
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:30,512
I'm leaving.

361
00:28:30,512 --> 00:28:32,602
I'm really going.

362
00:28:32,602 --> 00:28:34,652
I'm going.

363
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:43,942
Sleep!

364
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,162
Guitar is also forbidden.

365
00:28:53,712 --> 00:28:57,922
Sleep well, hyung.

366
00:28:59,122 --> 00:29:01,852
- I'm sorry you had to see that Se Ah.
- No, it's fine.

367
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:03,612
I'm used to this type of situation.

368
00:29:03,612 --> 00:29:08,762
When we were in our 20's, every time Gong Gi Tae dated other girls, I experienced similiar situations.

369
00:29:08,762 --> 00:29:11,462
Even though we're just friends,

370
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:15,482
girls would be really jealous and wary of me.

371
00:29:15,482 --> 00:29:17,742
I see.

372
00:29:17,742 --> 00:29:21,012
But where did all those many girls disappear to?

373
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:24,312
Next to Gi Tae, only Se Ah is left.

374
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:26,122
Because we're friends.

375
00:29:27,472 --> 00:29:29,202
How has your father been?

376
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:32,572
-My father?
-What happened three years ago,

377
00:29:32,572 --> 00:29:36,572
maybe he has not gotten over the issue yet. I was just wondering.

378
00:29:36,572 --> 00:29:40,452
Not at all. Although the marriage was broken, he still likes Gi Tae.

379
00:29:40,452 --> 00:29:43,902
He wants to scout him to our hospital.

380
00:29:43,902 --> 00:29:47,162
Oh, really? I'm thankful then.

381
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:52,382
Anyways, he wanted to meet Gi Tae again

382
00:29:52,382 --> 00:29:54,972
But..

383
00:29:54,972 --> 00:29:57,452
Joo Jang Mi is stuck in my mind.

384
00:29:57,452 --> 00:30:01,482
I'm worried that she might misunderstand. Gi Tae will probably refuse too

385
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:03,482
because Joo Jang Mi doesn't let go, either.

386
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:07,422
That problem, I can help.

387
00:31:02,682 --> 00:31:04,212
What the?!

388
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:07,582
It's me. Han Yeo Reum.

389
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:08,992
Why are you sleeping here?!

390
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,982
It's was too cold this morning.

391
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:13,382
Get out this instant!

392
00:31:13,382 --> 00:31:15,632
Why are you getting mad?

393
00:31:44,442 --> 00:31:46,282
What are you doing there?

394
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:48,212
You told me eating was prohibited.

395
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:49,442
At least I can feast with my eyes.

396
00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:51,652
I told you to get out.

397
00:31:51,652 --> 00:31:54,742
I thought you meant to get out of the bed.

398
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:56,602
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you? To make me angry.

399
00:31:56,602 --> 00:31:57,952
Me?

400
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,822
You? Why would I?

401
00:31:59,822 --> 00:32:02,362
Hey, is there really no other place for you to go?

402
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:05,122
You don't have relatives or friends?

403
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:10,972
All my friends are girls. I lost contact with my relatives. I never had a dad and my mom ran away.

404
00:32:16,962 --> 00:32:20,352
Do you think you can act pitiful so you can rely on me?

405
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:23,942
You didn't fall for it. Joo Jang Mi did.

406
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:30,252
If you aren't going to eat the egg, I'll eat it.

407
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:33,852
Be sure to clean up.

408
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:37,222
Are you going to work already? Let's go together, hyung.

409
00:32:45,902 --> 00:32:48,472
You won't even give me a ride?

410
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:57,952
He's cuter than he looks.

411
00:32:59,672 --> 00:33:03,212
That jerk... because he took the blankets...

412
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:09,762
In other words, the cartilage called the nasal septum is bent in the shape of a 'C.'

413
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:14,912
If we correct this, we can...

414
00:33:22,682 --> 00:33:25,922
I think I should go home for today. Cancel the afternoon appointments, please.

415
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:29,082
Yes, Doctor. Go home quickly and rest.

416
00:33:29,082 --> 00:33:31,752
Oh, right. There'll be electric maintenance work done today, right?

417
00:33:31,752 --> 00:33:34,562
Yes, from 8 PM today until tomorrow morning,

418
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:37,732
the entrance will be blocked and all the phone lines will be out.

419
00:33:37,732 --> 00:33:39,572
It just so happens that the electric generator is also being fixed.

420
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:42,952
Please make sure to take out the fat, ketamine, and the botox and filler products

421
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:44,792
that have to be refrigerated.
-Yes.

422
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:47,722
Doctor, are you alright?

423
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:49,062
I'm fine.

424
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:50,632
Yes.

425
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:55,202
Yes. This is Gong Gi Tae's Plastic Surgery Clinic.

426
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:58,482
I'm sorry, but the doctor can't see any patients today.

427
00:33:58,482 --> 00:33:59,992
<i>He has a cold...</i>

428
00:33:59,992 --> 00:34:03,092
Yes. I understand.

429
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:10,972
Is he in bad health? He couldn't drink alcohol very well either.

430
00:34:10,972 --> 00:34:12,502
Ah, this...

431
00:34:12,502 --> 00:34:15,322
Jang Mi's dad. Jang Mi's dad.

432
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:18,722
Ah, why are you waking up a person who earned money until dawn.

433
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:21,092
Did you earn it by yourself?

434
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,252
We earned it together. With me.

435
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:26,242
Go and buy some chicken from the market.

436
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:27,742
The freshest and healthiest ones.

437
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:30,582
Why?

438
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:33,782
Because I'm planning on feeding a brood hen for our son-in-law.

439
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:38,052
It sure is difficult to get our daughter married.

440
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:39,762
Ah, go away.

441
00:34:39,762 --> 00:34:42,342
This man.

442
00:34:54,412 --> 00:34:56,402
Ah, chicken and ginseng stew!

443
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:58,332
You knew that I was getting off work early today, didn't you?

444
00:34:58,332 --> 00:35:00,152
Hey. Go give this to son-in-law Gong.

445
00:35:00,152 --> 00:35:02,162
Mom!

446
00:35:02,162 --> 00:35:04,862
Do you really think I can get married to that person?

447
00:35:04,862 --> 00:35:06,762
He's on another level than me.

448
00:35:06,762 --> 00:35:10,982
I gave birth to you with beauty from another level.

449
00:35:12,452 --> 00:35:14,312
It can't be that

450
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,342
his parents are against the marriage, right?

451
00:35:16,342 --> 00:35:17,902
Not yet.

452
00:35:17,902 --> 00:35:19,282
But soon they will. It's obvious.

453
00:35:19,282 --> 00:35:22,392
It hasn't even happened yet, so why are you worried about that already. Be quiet!

454
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:25,632
Just go and deliver the chicken and ginseng stew. Don't leave someone who's sick on their own.

455
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:26,682
Is Gong Gi Tae sick?

456
00:35:26,682 --> 00:35:28,862
You don't even know that?

457
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:30,432
Hurry and go!

458
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,502
Ugh, but I'm tired.

459
00:35:32,502 --> 00:35:33,712
Do you want me to go?

460
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:37,122
Ah, fine. I'll go. I'll just go.

461
00:35:40,652 --> 00:35:43,652
My chicken and ginseng stew... it's mine.

462
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,202
<i>Gong Gi Tae's Mother</i>

463
00:35:57,912 --> 00:35:58,782
Yes, mother?

464
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,442
You said you wanted to get closer with me?

465
00:36:00,442 --> 00:36:02,442
Yes?

466
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:05,202
Ah, yes, yes.

467
00:36:05,202 --> 00:36:06,632
Do you have time right now?

468
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:09,082
Right now?

469
00:36:11,452 --> 00:36:14,132
-Welcome.
-Yes.

470
00:36:22,372 --> 00:36:24,022
What kind of fashion is that.

471
00:36:24,022 --> 00:36:29,072
Ah, I heard Gong Gi Tae was sick so I was on my way to deliver some chicken and ginseng stew.

472
00:36:29,072 --> 00:36:31,342
Whatever, go put that away.

473
00:36:31,342 --> 00:36:32,922
Yeah.

474
00:36:32,922 --> 00:36:34,542
-Go try this on.

475
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:36,882
-Excuse me?
-You told my sister that

476
00:36:36,882 --> 00:36:39,752
you wanted to go shopping with the girls and have a date.

477
00:36:39,752 --> 00:36:42,452
Ah...

478
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:45,092
Before the chicken and ginseng stew gets cold...

479
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:47,102
Gi Tae said he would join us in the evening.

480
00:36:47,102 --> 00:36:48,552
Here.

481
00:36:51,982 --> 00:36:54,092
Dinner?

482
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:57,012
I'm tired.

483
00:36:57,012 --> 00:36:58,022
I want to be alone with Jang Mi.

484
00:36:58,022 --> 00:36:59,792
Joo Jang Mi is going to be there too.

485
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:02,062
We're meeting for Joo Jang Mi.

486
00:37:02,062 --> 00:37:04,842
-What?
-It seemed like she was upset with me.

487
00:37:04,842 --> 00:37:07,482
So I was going to buy you two some dinner at a nice restaurant.

488
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:10,492
Let's meet at the French Restaurant.

489
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:17,782
What is she plotting now?

490
00:37:29,402 --> 00:37:30,212
Yeah, it's me.

491
00:37:30,212 --> 00:37:34,382
Save me! They're taking me somewhere nice so they're making me try on this and that.

492
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:36,412
Because I wouldn't look appropriate with my clothes.

493
00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:39,472
Why are they like this so suddenly?

494
00:37:39,472 --> 00:37:43,402
I think mother really likes me.

495
00:37:44,282 --> 00:37:45,642
Don't be intimidated.

496
00:37:45,642 --> 00:37:47,732
That's definitely not it.

497
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:52,282
I'm don't know what this is. But for now, accept everything that they buy for you.

498
00:37:52,282 --> 00:37:55,672
No, no. Buy everything you want.

499
00:37:55,672 --> 00:38:01,142
What is it... the wasteful, mindless chick concept.

500
00:38:03,702 --> 00:38:08,292
You're sick but still wicked.

501
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:09,352
Are you done yet?

502
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:11,062
What's taking you so long?

503
00:38:11,062 --> 00:38:12,992
Yes, I'm coming out now, Aunt.

504
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,072
-Hang up for now
-Fighting.

505
00:38:15,072 --> 00:38:16,672
Okay.

506
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:19,512
I'm going to go crazy.

507
00:38:19,512 --> 00:38:22,352
Try spinning for me.

508
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:28,352
It won't do. Let's pick something else.

509
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:34,712
Shall we try this on?

510
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:35,702
Ah, Aunt, this is the one.

511
00:38:35,702 --> 00:38:37,072
Too mature.

512
00:38:37,072 --> 00:38:39,112
Mature.

513
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:41,902
-This is nice.
-Wow, so pretty!

514
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:45,222
You look like a chameleon. This is too green.

515
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:47,452
Let's go.

516
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,652
Yes, Aunt.

517
00:39:02,242 --> 00:39:05,082
I'm going to die.

518
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:08,262
Almost there.

519
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:12,152
This?

520
00:39:19,372 --> 00:39:20,552
Are you kidding me?

521
00:39:20,552 --> 00:39:22,172
Ah, so pretty

522
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:24,752
I don't like that one the most.

523
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:29,472
Spin around.

524
00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:31,082
I like it.

525
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:33,472
-This one is okay.
-Okay?

526
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:35,182
Make her style luxurious.

527
00:39:35,182 --> 00:39:36,942
Make her makeup fancy.

528
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:39,262
The nail art is very important.

529
00:39:39,262 --> 00:39:40,762
The atmosphere is good.

530
00:39:40,762 --> 00:39:45,682
Then, I hope you go to your own stations and work hard.

531
00:39:45,682 --> 00:39:48,042
Be precise with the concealer.

532
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:49,292
Put some curls to make her hair look fuller.

533
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:51,192
Oh, the purple is nice.

534
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:52,662
It's cute, I guess.

535
00:39:52,662 --> 00:39:53,942
<i>-Ugh!
-But this is NG too. *No Good</i>

536
00:39:53,942 --> 00:39:55,352
Take it out, take it out immediately.

537
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,242
It doesn't suit her, it doesn't suit her.

538
00:39:57,242 --> 00:40:00,022
Be precise, precise.

539
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,572
Make her curls thicker.

540
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:28,002
<i>♬  we will live happily together ♬</i>

541
00:40:34,302 --> 00:40:36,362
Again! Back to the chic style!

542
00:40:36,362 --> 00:40:38,682
Stop! Aunt, please stop!

543
00:40:38,682 --> 00:40:42,142
Where's the good place? Even if you don't know, let's just go.

544
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:43,812
No, no! Again, again!

545
00:40:43,812 --> 00:40:45,682
I'm not going to pay!

546
00:40:45,682 --> 00:40:48,342
Oh god.

547
00:40:48,342 --> 00:40:49,982
Come in.

548
00:40:58,352 --> 00:41:00,862
I'm tired.

549
00:41:00,862 --> 00:41:02,932
This is heaven, Aunt.

550
00:41:02,932 --> 00:41:05,732
What are you talking about? We have to go to a better place.

551
00:41:05,732 --> 00:41:10,042
If you wait here, Gi Tae and Madame Shin will come to pick you up.

552
00:41:10,672 --> 00:41:13,852
Is there a traffic jam? Why... aren't they coming?

553
00:41:13,852 --> 00:41:17,202
I'll call Gong Gi Tae.

554
00:41:19,052 --> 00:41:23,462
A girl shouldn't call and ask when are they coming, or come faster.

555
00:41:23,462 --> 00:41:27,832
Then they don't have charm.

556
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:29,152
Ah, ok.

557
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:30,982
Sleep.

558
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:33,532
Uh hoo.

559
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:48,812
Jang Mi.

560
00:41:48,812 --> 00:41:51,242
Joo Jang Mi.

561
00:42:06,932 --> 00:42:11,002
I'm sorry Jang Mi, I didn't want to go this far either.

562
00:42:11,652 --> 00:42:13,942
Sorry Jang Mi!

563
00:42:17,392 --> 00:42:19,462
She fell asleep?

564
00:42:19,462 --> 00:42:22,782
I was wondering how to hold on to her longer, but thankfully.

565
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:25,142
But how could you leave her alone?

566
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:29,092
What if she wakes up? What would Gi Tae know...

567
00:42:29,092 --> 00:42:30,782
Don't worry.

568
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:33,362
I stole Joo Jang Mi's phone.

569
00:42:34,442 --> 00:42:37,352
Here, you keep it.

570
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:03,792
Why are you here?

571
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:07,112
My father will come soon too, he wants to see you.

572
00:43:07,112 --> 00:43:09,092
- What?
- And it also seems,

573
00:43:09,092 --> 00:43:11,802
that your mother needs my father.

574
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:14,112
What are you trying to do?

575
00:43:14,112 --> 00:43:15,592
What are you trying to do by using our parents?

576
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:17,682
I also feel uncomfortable involving them.

577
00:43:17,682 --> 00:43:23,232
How about allowing them to speak to each other, and we slowly leave?

578
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:32,562
If you come with me, I'll give you a present.

579
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:43,342
They'll arrive soon.

580
00:43:43,342 --> 00:43:45,952
Decide quickly.

581
00:43:45,952 --> 00:43:51,012
If you don't want your mother seeing what's in here.

582
00:43:57,162 --> 00:43:59,542
Am I too late?

583
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:03,102
No, you arrived right on time.

584
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:03,892
Where's your father?

585
00:44:04,437 --> 00:44:08,917
He said he's going to be a little late because an urgent surgery came up.

586
00:44:10,277 --> 00:44:14,137
What about Jang Mi? You ordered aunt to hold on to Jang Mi, didn't you?

587
00:44:14,137 --> 00:44:17,987
As she wanted, she went shopping with the girls and got her hair done.

588
00:44:17,987 --> 00:44:21,407
She's having a good time, so don't worry too much.

589
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:45,287
There's a call coming mother.

590
00:44:45,287 --> 00:44:47,167
Pick it up.

591
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:48,867
Ok, I'll go outside for a second...

592
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:50,797
Can I see this?

593
00:44:53,697 --> 00:44:55,537
- What are are you trying to do?
- It's Jang Mi's phone, isn't it?

594
00:44:55,537 --> 00:44:56,977
Why do you have Jang Mi's phone?

595
00:44:56,977 --> 00:44:59,737
Let go, it's a misunderstanding.

596
00:44:59,737 --> 00:45:03,307
Where is Joo Jang Mi? Where is she?

597
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:13,827
What is this?

598
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:20,067
What happened?

599
00:45:24,687 --> 00:45:27,107
Aunt?

600
00:45:27,857 --> 00:45:30,067
Aunt!

601
00:45:31,677 --> 00:45:33,917
Where did she go?

602
00:45:35,087 --> 00:45:36,567
My phone.

603
00:45:41,427 --> 00:45:43,467
My phone!

604
00:45:47,597 --> 00:45:50,777
What the?

605
00:46:06,817 --> 00:46:10,887
Aunt, your prank is a bit too harsh.

606
00:46:10,887 --> 00:46:13,617
Aunt where are you?

607
00:46:16,177 --> 00:46:19,407
Gong Gi Tae, it's you isn't it? Come out!

608
00:46:19,407 --> 00:46:22,537
I know you're there!

609
00:46:22,537 --> 00:46:24,357
Hey!

610
00:46:26,607 --> 00:46:29,057
What's going on?

611
00:46:29,057 --> 00:46:32,327
Is there really nobody here?

612
00:46:35,457 --> 00:46:37,457
Ugh!

613
00:46:37,457 --> 00:46:42,477
Excuse me! There's a person trapped here!

614
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:47,677
Why am I alone here?

615
00:46:49,277 --> 00:46:51,367
Phone!

616
00:47:07,137 --> 00:47:10,207
Where is it?

617
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:12,417
Ah!

618
00:47:15,807 --> 00:47:18,157
Ouch, my shoulder!

619
00:47:18,157 --> 00:47:20,137
What do I do?

620
00:47:23,637 --> 00:47:26,027
Oh, no...

621
00:47:30,137 --> 00:47:31,807
Hospital?

622
00:47:32,627 --> 00:47:37,817
You're saying Jang Mi is there alone?

623
00:47:40,427 --> 00:47:42,967
<i>Today from the evening at 8 o'clock to tomorrow morning, </i>

624
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:45,717
<i>the entrances closes, electricity, and phones are all out.</i>

625
00:47:45,717 --> 00:47:48,827
Now you kidnap and imprison her there?

626
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:52,697
Kidnap? Imprisonment? Don't overdo it.

627
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:55,847
And people are watching, lower your voice.

628
00:47:55,847 --> 00:47:57,207
Do you even know embarrassment?!

629
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:01,397
Don't get angry at her, I asked her to.

630
00:48:04,057 --> 00:48:05,307
I'm really sorry.

631
00:48:05,307 --> 00:48:07,877
It's not your fault, Se Ah. It's okay.

632
00:48:07,877 --> 00:48:10,757
I'm really sorry to Joo Jang Mi too.

633
00:48:10,757 --> 00:48:11,807
It's ok.

634
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:14,987
I'm not ok!

635
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:17,347
You can't leave her alone.

636
00:48:17,347 --> 00:48:19,807
You can never leave her alone!

637
00:48:36,777 --> 00:48:39,217
<i>♬ Even if you ♬</i>

638
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:40,897
<i>To be honest, I...
♬  Smile for me ♬</i>

639
00:48:40,897 --> 00:48:45,867
<i>when I was 5 years old, I almost died alone at home.
♬ You can't hide your dejection ♬</i>

640
00:48:49,017 --> 00:48:50,767
<i>So I can't be by myself.</i>

641
00:48:50,767 --> 00:48:54,157
<i> When I think about what happened back then... my heart still</i>

642
00:48:54,157 --> 00:48:56,617
<i>feels like it's ripping apart. 
♬ All I do is, ♬</i>

643
00:49:01,337 --> 00:49:05,467
<i>Is there no one there?!
♬ watch you turn away ♬</i>

644

<i>♬  I already know about our love ♬</i>

645
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:12,197
There's a person here!

646
00:49:12,197 --> 00:49:18,927
<i>♬  I guess this will be the last time ♬</i>

647

00:49:33,067 --> 00:49:36,957
<i>Please understand...

650
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:41,277
<i>How our Jang Mi's heart is.

<i>♬  Even if I forget my feelings for you ♬
-Hey you crazy bastard!</i>

652
00:49:47,507 --> 00:49:55,167
<i>♬  Because we shared a precious love ♬</i>

653
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:02,987
The store is closed.

654
00:50:03,537 --> 00:50:05,167
Didn't you hear that they were doing the electrical maintenance work tonight?

655
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:06,187
How long has it been since the lights went out?

656
00:50:06,187 --> 00:50:09,247
Since 8pm..? I think it's been around 30 minutes.

657
00:50:10,457 --> 00:50:12,357
Why? What is the matter?

658
00:50:13,117 --> 00:50:15,297
-Jang Mi got locked up at the clinic.
-What?

659
00:50:50,537 --> 00:50:51,947
Joo Jang Mi!

660
00:50:52,637 --> 00:50:54,177
Joo Jang Mi!

661
00:51:11,137 --> 00:51:12,907
Joo Jang Mi!

662
00:51:31,847 --> 00:51:33,517
Joo Jang Mi!

663
00:51:34,817 --> 00:51:36,727
Gong GI Tae.

664
00:51:40,277 --> 00:51:43,297
Are you stupid? Why are you here?

665
00:51:43,297 --> 00:51:45,367
Aunt told me to wait here.

666
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:48,277
If you're dumb, have some common sense at least!

667
00:51:48,277 --> 00:51:50,267
and what is with the chicken and ginseng stew?

668
00:51:50,267 --> 00:51:52,487
Why are you yelling?

669
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:57,767
Do you know how much I suffered because of you?

670
00:52:14,307 --> 00:52:17,147
Do you know how scared I was?

671
00:52:17,147 --> 00:52:19,867
It is okay. It is okay.

672
00:52:35,297 --> 00:52:37,277
What a pity that it's wasted.

673
00:52:38,237 --> 00:52:41,097
Mom sent this thinking of you.

674
00:52:43,587 --> 00:52:46,017
I will go wash up.

675
00:53:01,537 --> 00:53:06,157
There's a lot left. It should be enough for three people to eat heartily.

676
00:53:06,157 --> 00:53:09,237
Are you Jesus? Are you going to create a miracle?

677
00:53:09,237 --> 00:53:12,317
Sure I can. As soon as you allow me to cook.

678
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:14,167
Do whatever you want.

679
00:53:50,637 --> 00:53:51,627
What are you doing?

680
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:53,447
Here. I made Samgyepasta.

681
00:53:53,447 --> 00:53:56,217
Did you make it with my Mom's Samgyetang (chicken soup)?

682
00:53:57,407 --> 00:54:01,857
Pasta is what you make when you can't cook but still want to make yourself look good.

683
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,367
It's good.

684
00:54:10,367 --> 00:54:11,957
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

685
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,977
You should try it as well.

686
00:54:15,467 --> 00:54:17,227
I don't have an appetite.

687
00:54:18,707 --> 00:54:21,057
I'm telling you to try it. Open.

688
00:54:33,977 --> 00:54:35,497
It's good, right?

689
00:54:35,497 --> 00:54:37,577
It's probably the samgyetang's broth that's good.

690
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:39,827
He's right. I didn't do anything.

691
00:54:39,827 --> 00:54:41,987
It's all thanks to your mother's cooking.

692
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:47,067
I feel sorry toward Mother.

693
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:49,307
I don't deserve to receive things like this.

694
00:54:50,317 --> 00:54:55,697
It's okay. If it weren't for you, when would my mom ever get to dream of a doctor son-in-law?

695
00:54:55,697 --> 00:55:00,957
Let's just say that you let my mom and dad have a sweet dream.

696
00:55:00,957 --> 00:55:05,197
Well, although it's a very short midsummer night's dream (sounds like Han Yeo Reum).

697
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:07,577
Did you call me?

698
00:55:08,757 --> 00:55:11,497
That guy doesn't even know when or when not to butt in.

699
00:55:11,497 --> 00:55:13,997
Let's drink. There was wine.

700
00:55:13,997 --> 00:55:15,527
-Call. (good)
-Call.

701
00:55:15,527 --> 00:55:16,547
These people...

702
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:20,767
Hey, hey! I'm sick! Where are you going to have a drinking party?

703
00:55:21,697 --> 00:55:23,377
Where is it...

704
00:55:23,377 --> 00:55:26,967
Hey! Hey! I told you not to touch it.

705
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:29,007
<i>♬ The way you talk always mysteriously stays near my ears ♬</i>

706
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:37,567
-Cheers!
-One shot! One shot! One shot!

707
00:55:38,097 --> 00:55:39,927
One shot. Aigoo..

708
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:43,787
-Eat it. Eat it. I don't want to eat.
-Open.

709
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:45,777
-Why?
-Open.

710
00:55:55,077 --> 00:55:57,537
I'll feed you just for today. Ah~

711
00:55:58,687 --> 00:56:00,157
It's good, right?

712
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:02,087
Bread.

713
00:56:03,847 --> 00:56:06,237
Open.

714
00:56:08,017 --> 00:56:12,047
<i>♬ Your eyes nose and lips
Your hands that used to touch me ♬</i>

715
00:56:12,047 --> 00:56:18,377
<i>♬ Little finger nails and all ♬</i>

716
00:56:18,377 --> 00:56:22,007
<i>♬ I can still feel you. ♬</i>

717
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:27,547
<i>♬ Like a flame which went out ♬</i>

718
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:31,157
This song.

719
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:36,267
You thought you just do like this, right? That isn't right.

720
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,907
Do it once for us.

721
00:56:57,967 --> 00:57:00,207
<i>You can't leave that girl alone.</i>

722
00:57:00,207 --> 00:57:03,007
<i>You can't EVER leave her by herself!</i>

723
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:22,287
<i> Being alone suits you better. </i>

724
00:57:22,287 --> 00:57:24,837
<i> 3 years ago
 I like being alone. </i>

725
00:57:28,367 --> 00:57:30,107
<i> I am sorry. </i>

726
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:38,417
<i> I think I can breathe now. </i>

727
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:41,707
<i> While preparing for the wedding, </i>

728
00:57:41,707 --> 00:57:44,277
<i>my breath felt shorter and shorter each day. </i>

729
00:57:45,197 --> 00:57:47,957
<i> This isn't right. </i>

730
00:57:47,957 --> 00:57:50,327
<i> This isn't how I usually do things. </i>

731
00:57:50,327 --> 00:57:53,297
<i> The truth is that I was very hurt. </i>

732
00:57:53,297 --> 00:57:56,167
<i> Thank you for telling me first. </i>

733
00:57:56,167 --> 00:58:00,667
<i> We're okay, right? </i>

734
00:58:00,667 --> 00:58:02,787
<i> Of course we are. </i>

735
00:58:16,757 --> 00:58:19,577
What should I do, Gong Gi Tae?

736
00:58:25,057 --> 00:58:27,237
I'm not okay.

737
00:59:05,327 --> 00:59:07,427
What is this, seriously?

738
00:59:10,157 --> 00:59:13,767
I'm a sick person. I am sick.

739
00:59:36,517 --> 00:59:38,857
<i> -Are you okay?
- Are you okay, Doctor? </i>

740
00:59:38,857 --> 00:59:40,857
<i> You are okay, right? </i>

741
01:00:03,037 --> 01:00:04,937
No.

742
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:09,577
I am not okay.

743
01:00:13,797 --> 01:00:16,707
<i>♬  When I see you, my heart pounds♬</i>

744
01:00:16,707 --> 01:00:19,077
<i>♬  And my lips dry up ♬</i>

745
01:00:19,077 --> 01:00:24,477
<i>♬  I couldn’t sleep last night because of the butterflies ♬</i>

746
01:00:24,477 --> 01:00:26,827
<i>♬  Why am I like this?♬</i>

747
01:00:26,827 --> 01:00:31,227
<i> Preview 
♬  My face is getting hot ♬</i>

748
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:32,307
<i> Did you guys kiss? </i>

749
01:00:32,307 --> 01:00:35,067
<i> Starting from today, we are in love. </i>

750
01:00:35,067 --> 01:00:37,967
<i>Your family got it for her, right? Thanks, hyung.</i>

751
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,297
<i> Mom!</i>

752
01:00:39,297 --> 01:00:42,877
<i> How can you have a formal meeting between our families without even telling us?</i>

753
01:00:42,877 --> 01:00:45,667
<i> If you can do it, do it once. </i>

754
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:49,177
<i>-Jang Mi? Jang Mi?
-I think mother-in-law has some special power. </i>

755
01:00:49,177 --> 01:00:51,047
<i> Gong Gi Tae, where are you now? </i>

756
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,817
<i>He just went inside to take a shower.</i>

757
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:57,207
<i> I will definitely wear this dress and get married. </i>
