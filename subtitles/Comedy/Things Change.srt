1
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,166
May I help you?

2
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:58,194
A friend of ours would like
to speak to you this evening.

3
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,730
I just shine shoes.

4
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,003
There'll be shoes there.

5
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,156
Two weeks ago, a man named Aaronberg
was shot to death...

6
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,168
the corner of Racine and Belden.

7
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,466
This is public knowledge.

8
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,065
Two people saw the crime,
and this was also in the papers.

9
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,168
This is public knowledge.

10
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,772
What I am going to tell you now
is not public knowledge.

11
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,817
Do you understand?

12
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,180
Good. The act was committed
by a person unknown...

13
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,988
a man in a gray overcoat.

14
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,462
Unfortunately, a friend of ours
has been mistakenly identified...

15
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,192
as the man who did the murder.

16
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,665
Show him the picture.

17
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:52,402
This is the man who has been
mistakenly accused.

18
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,681
Do you understand?

19
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,332
To prevent a grave injustice
from being done...

20
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,833
to protect an innocent man...

21
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,336
someone must confess
to the crime...

22
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,372
someone who looks like...

23
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,509
This person would plead guilty
to murder...

24
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,809
and would unfortunately spend a term
of three to five years in prison.

25
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,220
To such a person,
we are prepared to pay...

26
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,152
this amount of money
per year...

27
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,960
for each year he spent
in prison.

28
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,661
You could say
you were in prison now.

29
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,931
You must have a dream.
Do you have a dream?

30
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,041
What is that dream?

31
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,313
A boat.

32
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,977
A boat.

33
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,045
A fishing boat.

34
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,387
Your dream is a fishing boat?

35
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,757
In Sicily.

36
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,353
In three years...

37
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,661
you could have that fishing boat.

38
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,531
You could earn yourself
that boat.

39
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,867
If you stay in your shoe store...

40
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:29,135
what will you have in three years?

41
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,438
What will you have in three years?

42
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,746
What do you have now?

43
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,283
Will you do it for me?

44
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,572
You've just made a grave mistake.

45
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,234
All right.

46
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,140
Shine 'em up, Joe.

47
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,841
Get me Marty in Detroit. Tell him
I want to see him as soon as possible.

48
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,681
- And get me whats-his-name downtown.
- Yes, sir.

49
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,483
Watch out for the socks.
These are cashmere socks.

50
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,850
Yes.

51
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,093
Mr. Silver, get me downtown...

52
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,298
and tell them I need a guy
for that project...

53
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,102
we were discussing.

54
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,667
- He'll know what I mean.
- Yes, sir.

55
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,679
Come on, boy.

56
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,307
We want to get you back
to your shoe shine stand.

57
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,510
Yes, this is Mr. Silver
in Chicago.

58
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,650
That's right.

59
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,623
No, I have the number on his boat,
but I was told I could find him here.

60
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,961
I'll hold.

61
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,057
A man comes into my house,
what does he want?

62
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,864
I tell him, "Whatever you want."
A fellow's dying.

63
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,905
Fifty bucks a week, says,
"Buy me a boat."

64
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,965
Fine.
I'll buy him a pushcart.

65
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,569
Buy him an organ with a monkey,
and he can put a bandana on his head.

66
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,614
Son of a bitch immigrant said
he wanted a boat. I'll give him a boat.

67
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,383
I do it.

68
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,924
Just a minute.

69
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,288
It won't be necessary.

70
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,696
Thank you.

71
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,470
This is a Sicilian coin.

72
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,032
- The Sicilian people say...
- Mr. Green.

73
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,079
- "A big man..."
- Excuse me.

74
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,915
"A big man knows the value
of a small coin."

75
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,783
My friendship is a small coin...

76
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,255
but it is all I have
to offer you.

77
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,522
Thank you.

78
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,836
The papers, please.

79
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,940
Sign here.

80
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,503
This is your confession.

81
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,313
Good. And now...

82
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,264
We need your fingerprints.

83
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,603
Pick up the gun and close it.

84
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,492
To my new friend.

85
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,517
- You done good on that thing.
- Thanks, Frank.

86
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,058
Marcotti. What, are you
gettin' ambitious?

87
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,151
- Just doin' a job.
- Willie.

88
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,991
- Thanks, Frank.
- Guys.

89
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,690
Thank you.

90
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,290
Jerry, we got a...
What is this?

91
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,734
Jerry somethin'-or-other works here?
I thought we sent him to the farm team.

92
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:55,137
- Why's that, Frank?
- Seems he can't follow orders.

93
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,074
Can't follow orders?
Is the guy a team player or what?

94
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,170
- No, it would seem not.
- That's a shame, Frank.

95
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:05,013
- Yes, I agree.
- No pain, no pals, no prospects.

96
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:09,111
- What kind of guy is that?
- A word to the wise is sufficient.

97
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,715
What's happening on the South Side.
Lead off with the shipping thing.

98
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,726
Here are the figures
on the shipping.

99
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,525
Glad to hear from you too, Jerry.
Maybe when you get off probation...

100
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,531
Do you think
you can get this clean?

101
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,227
What does a guy get
who can't toe the line?

102
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,362
- Probation.
- Right.

103
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,099
Frankie.

104
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,514
- What's up?
- I have a little errand for you.

105
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,676
I want you to get the right guy
for this and take care of it for me.

106
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,900
Hey, Cinderella.

107
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,936
Come here.

108
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,181
Come here.
I want you to get me in the area.

109
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,688
Jerry's gonna handle it.
He's a very good man.

110
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:54,055
- What did you tell him?
- To stick to this guy the whole weekend.

111
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,492
- He won't let him out of his sight.
- Don't screw this up.

112
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,587
He's good.
He'll handle it.

113
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,953
Mr. Green?

114
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,118
All right.
Listen and learn something.

115
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,489
- Now you do this one right.
- I'm doin' it right.

116
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,429
I'm gettin' off probation.

117
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,798
Just do this,
and then we'll see.

118
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,529
Why did you kill him?

119
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,001
He was a no-good son of a bitch.

120
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,040
And?

121
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,098
- He...
- You owed him money.

122
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:21,408
Yeah, yeah.
Owe him some money.

123
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,541
- How much did you owe him?
- Fifteen hundred dollars.

124
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,312
That's right.

125
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,411
What did you do with the money?

126
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,718
I lose it at the racetrack.

127
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,856
What time was it you killed him?
Hold it. You know that one.

128
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,399
How many times did you shoot him?

129
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,401
Three times.

130
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,233
Don't get it too pat.
Three or four.

131
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,466
I shoot him three or four times.

132
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,270
Son of a bitch.

133
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,137
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,148
You're a natural.

135
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,275
You got the thing cold.

136
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,488
We're not gonna do no more?

137
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,928
No, you know it.

138
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,125
You know it.

139
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,831
Hey, this is ridiculous.

140
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:25,365
You're goin' to jail for three years.

141
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,105
What do you want to do?

142
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,374
We'll do something, huh?

143
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,475
What?

144
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,280
What do you...

145
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,617
Want to get a couple of broads?

146
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,782
- Do you want to see a show?
- No.

147
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,884
Hey, I'll get you tickets
to something.

148
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,452
They're telling me
I should not leave this room.

149
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,123
They?

150
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,364
There is no "they."
I am "they."

151
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,929
What do you want to do?

152
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,907
Can we...

153
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,603
Can we take a walk
down by the beach?

154
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,976
It'd be okay?

155
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,345
Okay?

156
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,223
I'll show you what's okay.

157
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,178
Have a nice day.

158
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,248
Take care, now.

159
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,221
- You like to travel?
- Sure.

160
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,267
- Okay, good.
- I like.

161
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,927
Good.

162
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,706
Glad to hear it.
Here to make you happy.

163
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,866
Anything to please.
That's me.

164
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,446
Two days, understand?

165
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,005
A little fun, a little memory,
then back to Chicago.

166
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,881
Back to Chicago. I shoot
the son of a bitch in the heart.

167
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,546
When I say it, out here,
do it.

168
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,090
- You the boss.
- I am the boss.

169
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,649
You keep that clear,
we're gonna get on fine.

170
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,487
Hey, how you doin'?
What are you doin' here?

171
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,619
How are you? I'm doin' fine.
How should I be doin'?

172
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,493
You know. Heard you mucked up
back there last month.

173
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,033
- What does that mean?
- Heard they slapped your wrists.

174
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,500
- What wrists?
- Heard you had to stay after school.

175
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,162
Couldn't obey orders.

176
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,831
Stay after school?

177
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,240
Are you joking me? Does this look
like staying after school?

178
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,480
Who is he?

179
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,582
If you don't know,
then maybe you shouldn't know.

180
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,330
- Are you staying at the hotel?
- Yeah, we're staying at the hotel.

181
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,993
- Someone picking you up?
- I think they're sending someone down...

182
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,661
Get in the car.

183
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,635
Hey, you know, I heard you got
in some deep powder back there.

184
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,195
I heard they put you on probation.

185
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,742
You can't believe
everything you hear.

186
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,676
Sometimes they put out
a story, you know.

187
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,941
And so you're...

188
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,506
What, so you're...

189
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,950
What I am is what you see.

190
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,955
And so your guy,
he's big back there.

191
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,756
Babe, this is the guy...

192
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:40,457
behind the guy behind the guy.

193
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,365
But what I got to tell you is...

194
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,272
I cannot talk about it.

195
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,207
- I understand.
- He wants to have a quiet weekend.

196
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,211
- I understand.
- But of this, bit of that. No fuss.

197
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,951
- Billy. Thanks, pal.
- I'll walk you in.

198
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,658
- Thanks, pal. I'll take it from here.
- No problem.

199
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,320
Hey.

200
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,760
Right this way.

201
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,993
I'm trying to keep a low profile
here, you understand?

202
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:56,336
- We like to go in quiet.
- Could we get some attention here?

203
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,841
May I help you?

204
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:12,415
Yes. I'll have to get
right back to you.

205
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,925
Good morning, gentlemen.
How good to have you with us.

206
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,961
Shall we go up to the room?

207
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,111
We're going upstairs.

208
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,174
We'll be going to the Criterion Floor.

209
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,977
Welcome to the Galaxy, gentlemen.

210
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,719
- Tell them our guests are coming.
- Yes, sir.

211
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,962
Anything you might need in Lake Tahoe,
sir, I'd be honored if you'd ask for me.

212
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,623
Billy Drake.

213
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,536
- Who is he?
- From Chicago.

214
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,731
Yes, sir.

215
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,206
I understand.

216
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,334
Absolutely.

217
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,878
I understand.
Yes, sir.

218
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,073
I understand completely.

219
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,672
Ah, here they are now.

220
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,544
Hi.

221
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,418
Welcome to
the Criterion Floor, Mr...

222
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,983
Johnson.

223
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,552
Look, it's a good idea...

224
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,794
It's very important that nobody know
that Mr. Johnson is here.

225
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,201
I understand. I am your butler.
My name is Randy.

226
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:36,604
And I'll be at your disposal
24 hours a day.

227
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:48,280
See to the bedrooms, if you would.
And turn on the music, please.

228
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:55,720
Any help with travel arrangements,
special dietary preparation...

229
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,285
cleaning, mending,
shoe shine, shopping...

230
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:01,594
or any other aid that you require,
don't hesitate to ring.

231
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,760
The manager has informed me
that all the staff have been advised...

232
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,361
that any wish expressed by you
or Mr. Johnson...

233
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,738
No, no, no. Nobody is to know
that Mr. Johnson is here.

234
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,334
Believe me, I understand.

235
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,345
Your privacy will be respected.

236
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,905
We're here for two days' quiet.
A little low-profile relaxation.

237
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,747
I completely understand.

238
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,481
We at the Galaxy understand
and appreciate your position.

239
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,489
Believe me.

240
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,458
The Criterion Floor in concept
and execution exists only...

241
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,620
to cater to your special needs.

242
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,306
Secretarial or legal services.
I am a notary, should you require it.

243
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,311
Where are the bags?

244
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,939
We lost our bags
on a connection.

245
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,415
Our stores and shops are yours.
Whatever you require...

246
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,418
go down or ring
and they'll have it sent up.

247
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,954
- That's very kind of you, but...
- Credit in the casino.

248
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,456
Whatever you require
in financial services.

249
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:03,051
We have a 24-hour access
to a ticker tape of the major markets.

250
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,327
Allow me.

251
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,469
Tickets to the show, Jackie Shore,
tonight in the Constellation Room...

252
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,945
or tickets for
any other show in town.

253
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,608
The sights and sounds of Lake Tahoe.

254
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,949
And here's my card. I'm at that number
or they'll beep me there...

255
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,750
at any time, any time at all.

256
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:35,589
Oh, Mr. Johnson,
any questions about the room?

257
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,527
I believe we have anticipated
your tobacco requirements...

258
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,657
but if there's anything we've left out,
don't hesitate to let me know.

259
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:02,351
It is a pleasure and an honor
having you as a guest of the Galaxy...

260
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,115
and of the Criterion Floor.

261
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,317
My name is Randy, and whatever I can do
to make your stay more enjoyable...

262
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,792
it will be my honor
and pleasure to serve you.

263
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,694
The concierge desk and our kitchen
are at your disposal...

264
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,130
and should you wish to shop,
our shops and stores...

265
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,397
are open to you on a private basis
24 hours a day.

266
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,497
And whatever services you should desire,
there is, of course, no bill.

267
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,872
Your money's no good in this hotel.

268
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,851
Mr. Johnson...

269
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,119
you have beautiful hands.

270
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,890
Yes, and a lovely treatment
of the hands, if I may say so, sir.

271
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:49,730
An excellent choice.
Clean without being austere.

272
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,001
Mr. Johnson, it's been a pleasure.

273
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,476
It's always a pleasure to clothe
a man of your physique.

274
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,818
You honor it, sir,
with your custom.

275
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,768
Yes, yes, yes.

276
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,895
Okay.
Wanna pass, huh?

277
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,496
Clothes don't make the man.
I make the man.

278
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,099
You understand me?
Just because we got new clothes...

279
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,441
- Something to drink, gentlemen?
- Scotch, please.

280
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,345
Nothing for me.
I'm here to gamble.

281
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,712
Here we go.

282
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:52,324
Give me 5 on the 9, 5 on the 19,
and 5 for you, dealer.

283
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,524
Round and round she goes.

284
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,397
No more bets.
Where she stops, nobody knows.

285
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:01,337
Good luck. And the number is...

286
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,676
- You got to put money in it.
- <i>Now taking reservations for the shows.</i>

287
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,182
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Give me $20.

288
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,080
- So we're gonna have 2 wonderful days.
- I understand.

289
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,483
- We aren't gonna go crazy.
- Two days, we go back to Chicago.

290
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,579
- That's absolutely right.
- 10:00 Monday morning...

291
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:22,786
28th district,
I wear the gray overcoat.

292
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:27,127
I see the son of a bitch
and three shots in the heart.

293
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,189
So how do you feel?
Tight but aggressive?

294
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,064
- Okay.
- May I help you, gentlemen?

295
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,070
Yeah. Give me $20.

296
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,599
- Everything all right, gentlemen?
- No, we're just, uh...

297
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,076
Whatever credit these gentlemen require,
there's no limit.

298
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,047
- And I mean no limit.
- Twenty dollars.

299
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,383
Yeah.
No, no, I think...

300
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,615
I'm making a joke here.
Just give me a thousand.

301
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,248
Give me a thousand bucks.
Tab it.

302
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,326
Would you like a table for the late
show, Jackie Shore, Constellation Room?

303
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,887
- In the back.
- One thousand dollars.

304
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,130
- Thanks.
- Mr. Shipp, may I have a moment?

305
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,669
Excuse me.

306
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,471
If you got the name,
go get the game.

307
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,442
Let's gamble.

308
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,909
Okay.

309
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,912
No, hey, this is for show.

310
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,914
Play what you got
in your pockets.

311
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,452
And if there's anything at all
that I can do for you...

312
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,647
- Thanks.
- I'll tell you, Jerry...

313
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,747
I never win nothing.

314
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,419
- Maybe we can fix that.
- Jerry.

315
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,292
Not even you can fix
something like this.

316
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,093
- Not even me, huh?
- Not even you.

317
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,691
Not even someone like me?

318
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,236
Put it in.

319
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,541
Hey, wait a second!

320
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,368
There is something
you could do for me.

321
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:51,381
I'd like to give Mr. Johnson
a little treat.

322
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,111
- Absolutely, sir.
- Could we arrange for him...

323
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,881
as a lark,
to win a little, you know?

324
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,388
- To win?
- Just a little.

325
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,720
- To win at the casino.
- Just a little... $50, $100.

326
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:04,387
As a thrill, you know?
Can you do that?

327
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,158
- Well...
- Whatever it is, I'll make it up.

328
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,928
- You're saying you'll pay it back?
- That's what I'm saying.

329
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,506
Broke so soon?

330
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,635
The slots are cold.
Let's try something else.

331
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,638
Twelve.

332
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,917
Twelve.

333
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:11,306
- This table open?
- Yes, sir, it is.

334
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:14,024
Okay. You got black, you got red,
you got numbers.

335
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,498
- What do you want to bet?
- I'll take black.

336
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:20,162
Take a number. Pick a number.

337
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:23,264
You pick a number, it hits,
it pays 35 to 1.

338
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,309
Put five bucks on a number.

339
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:28,004
- We're partners.
- No, it's yours.

340
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,446
We're partners.
Whatever happens, we're 50/50, okay?

341
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,143
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

342
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,277
You know what number
I always play?

343
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,915
My flight number.
What flight did we come in on?

344
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,425
- Twelve, wasn't it?
- Yeah, yeah.

345
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,757
I think you're right.
I think it was number 12.

346
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,863
- I got to talk to you.
- Not now.

347
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,436
Twelve.
The number is twelve.

348
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:01,842
- I win.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,809
Did you see what my friend did?

350
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,817
Bravo, Mr. Johnson. Good play.

351
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,410
We got to lose the lighting guy.
He's napping up there.

352
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,752
I'm not saying it's hurting
the show. It's not.

353
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,451
Have you seen the show?

354
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,323
- Have you seen the show, Mr...
- And here's your winnings, sir.

355
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,853
- Have you seen the show?
- No, I can't say that I have.

356
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,400
What do you mean, you haven't seen it?
How long have you been here?

357
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,696
Place your bets.

358
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,373
One thousand dollars
on number 12.

359
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,343
- There's a bit I do, working the crowd.
- This is not the time, Jackie.

360
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,313
I want to make a point here.
You've got a beautiful, fine show...

361
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,316
well thought-out,
but if you don't have the support...

362
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,353
- This is my theme: Support.
- Twelve again.

363
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,547
I win again!

364
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,749
Yes, sir, you did.

365
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,761
How much we win?

366
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,495
Thirty-five thousand dollars.

367
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,609
We fly number 12,
we play number 12.

368
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,877
That's a lot of money.

369
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:14,042
What number do you want
to play now?

370
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,112
That's enough.

371
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,023
Come on.
I'll buy you a car.

372
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:26,325
- Sir...
- Yeah, hold on a second.

373
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,638
- What's happening?
- That guy just won a couple bucks.

374
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,106
Hey, what we do with this money?

375
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,339
Gino, we got to give it back.

376
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,243
Why?
I win this.

377
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,181
Yeah, but...

378
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,049
- I win this money.
- Yeah, but listen, listen.

379
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:53,955
It's a thing of hospitality.

380
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,825
We're...
We're guests in their hotel.

381
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,022
Sure, we could take the money.

382
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,692
It's not a question of the money.

383
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,634
It's just for the sake of...

384
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,066
honor.

385
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,506
To be an honorable guest.

386
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,067
It's not the money?

387
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,807
It's honor?

388
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,345
Would you move back, please?

389
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,546
- What happened?
- That guy just won 35 grand.

390
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,224
Excuse me, sir.
I have to talk to you.

391
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,693
- In a minute.
- I have to talk to you.

392
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,697
How this game work?

393
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,633
Well, we pay a hundred to one.

394
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,400
What that means is, if you bet a dollar
and your number wins...

395
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,407
you win $100.

396
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,808
- How much I can bet?
- Just as advertised, sir...

397
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,177
the Wheel of Fortune,
the pride of the Galaxy...

398
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,910
never refused a bet
of any size.

399
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,215
If I bet $35,000, how much I win?

400
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,551
If you bet $35,000...

401
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:02,457
you'd win $3,500,000.

402
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:06,290
I bet $35,000.

403
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,093
Put on number 12.

404
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,736
Thirty-five thousand dollars
on number 12.

405
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,240
Do me a favor, honey.
Put $1,000 on number 12.

406
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:22,177
A hundred on 1, a hundred on 2,
500 on 12 and a hundred on 21.

407
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,373
- Lord hates a coward.
- Bet for me.

408
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,643
- Five hundred on twelve.
- Twenty on 12.

409
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,719
- Another 50.
- Thank you, and bets are closed.

410
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,723
- One dollar on 12.
- All right. Thank you.

411
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,157
And bets are closed.

412
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:43,261
And round and round she goes.

413
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,565
Where she stops, nobody knows.
Good luck to you all.

414
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:50,300
- Please, please.
- Come on, baby. Come home to Papa.

415
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:57,078
One time, baby. This is it.

416
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,776
Come to Papa, baby. Come on.

417
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,986
And the number is...

418
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,630
seventy-four.

419
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,037
The number is 74.
I'm sorry.

420
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:26,372
The number is 74.
No winners on 74.

421
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,311
No winners.
No winners on 74.

422
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,811
Hell of a bet, son.

423
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,525
I'm sorry you lost
all that money, sir.

424
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,657
Things change.

425
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,338
Your drink, sir.

426
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:01,872
Thank you.

427
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,393
I'll tell you what's crazy, folks.
The longer I'm married...

428
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,801
the more I'm losing
my single instincts.

429
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,841
I was at a party in Hollywood...
big show business party...

430
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,842
beautiful blonde starlet
comes up to me.

431
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,674
She says, " My husband's away
for the weekend. How about a lift home?"

432
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,874
I said, "If you knew he would be away,
you should've made travel arrangements."

433
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,319
I have a theory criminals want
to get caught.

434
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,618
The <i>Reporter</i> said 18 of the 20
suspects arrested are known...

435
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,659
to have organized crime ties.

436
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,991
If they don't want to get caught, don't
wear the ties. See what I'm saying?

437
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,804
- How's your drink?
- Good. Good.

438
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,118
You handled yourself
very graciously back there.

439
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:25,629
When you are in Rome,
you do like the Romans do.

440
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,333
I saw a guy today down at the tables.

441
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:37,841
Shoots 35 grand in one roll,
craps out. He says, "Things change."

442
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:41,241
And one thing that does not change,
ladies and gentlemen, is friendship.

443
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,406
And I want to say hi to a good friend
of ours from Chicago, Mr. Johnson.

444
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:48,350
Would you please stand up, Mr. Johnson?
Ladies and gentlemen, let him know.

445
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:51,411
Mr. Johnson?
Mr. Johnson?

446
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,586
Come on, folks. Give it up.
Give it up!

447
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:02,655
Mr. Johnson. Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Johnson from Chicago.

448
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,734
Give it up one time
for Mr. Johnson.

449
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,000
Folks, take it from a man who knows,
there is nothing like friendship.

450
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,099
'Cause if there was,
somebody would have invented it already.

451
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,077
- Check five and thirteen, please.
- <i>One minute to curtain.</i>

452
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,047
- Hey, have you got a minute?
- <i>Stop me if you got a problem.</i>

453
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:21,949
Why am I getting this again?
I walked out of my light.

454
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,987
- What is your guy doing up there?
- I can't talk about this now.

455
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,750
Your lighting guy,
what is this, your wife's cousin?

456
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,758
Now it's Jackie. Great.
What?

457
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:32,091
Did I do something to you
in a previous life? What is this?

458
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:35,724
- <i>Roger, microphone check.</i>
- Hey, Mr. Johnson!

459
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,965
- Mr. Johnson, what a nice surprise.
- Yeah, very surprised.

460
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,132
I hope you guys enjoyed the show,
and good of you to play along.

461
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:47,837
Really very supportive, and I
appreciate that. You looked great.

462
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:50,972
I thought I told you I didn't want any
publicity. We don't want any notice.

463
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,346
<i>Thirty seconds to curtain, please.</i>

464
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:56,853
Hey, guys, look, if I jumped wrong...
if you don't want any notice.

465
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,821
Yeah, bear with me here.

466
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,188
- <i>On your cue, go black.</i>
- On stage, please.

467
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,894
Maybe a little notice.
Cherry, Grace!

468
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,694
- <i>This is curtain, ladies and gentlemen.</i>
- I'd like you to meet Mr. Johnson.

469
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,701
- <i>And now...</i>
- Let's go, girls.

470
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,432
<i>The one, the only, the greatest revue</i>
<i>in the great state of Nevada...</i>

471
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,839
<i>ladies and gentlemen, the Galaxy Hotel</i>
<i>is proud to present...</i>

472
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,400
<i>the Fertile Crescent.</i>

473
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,820
Do you mind if we come in?

474
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:55,335
I always wondered
where I was meant to be.

475
00:41:55,412 --> 00:42:00,008
It's good to work, Jerry,
but it is also good to play.

476
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:07,252
"The Ant and the Grasshopper."

477
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:13,795
Once upon a time, there was
an ant and a grasshopper.

478
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,630
All summer long,
the ant worked hard.

479
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,364
The grasshopper,
he played the violin.

480
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,372
He dance.

481
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:25,670
Winter come.

482
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,810
The ant grow fat.

483
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,144
The grasshopper is cold.

484
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:37,644
The grasshopper
eat the ant.

485
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,298
Return to me.

486
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,147
My darling, I adore you.

487
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,885
Only you...

488
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,158
in my heart.

489
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,033
You guys like the water?

490
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,299
What do you have in mind?

491
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,936
We have a little cabin,
up on Falling Leaf...

492
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,209
and we're going fishing
for a few days.

493
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,874
Would you...

494
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,411
We wanted to know if you want
to come there and go fishing with us?

495
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,259
Really, fishing.
For fish.

496
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,023
Tomorrow, when we get off.

497
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:56,555
- We have to be back in Chicago.
- Well, you know, anytime.

498
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,536
- Anytime you come in.
- Anytime you're in Tahoe.

499
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:04,131
Anytime. Six months, a year.

500
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,644
Well, actually, it might be
a lot longer than that.

501
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:18,882
We're gonna be gone
for quite a while...

502
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,890
dear girls.

503
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:31,162
Good morning, good morning,
good morning.

504
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,169
Where is everybody?

505
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,152
- <i>Good morning.</i>
- Good morning.

506
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,056
Would you be so kind
as to send up some coffee.

507
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:33,392
- <i>Right away. Coffee.</i>
- Lovely. Thank you very much.

508
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,897
<i>Not at all.</i>

509
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,897
Gino, wake up
and smell the coffee.

510
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:52,580
This is the kind of day.

511
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,885
Listen and learn something.

512
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:59,320
This is the kind of day.

513
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,805
- You rub too hard, then...
- You take off the polish.

514
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,275
So, the trick is...

515
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,812
Not too hard and not too soft.

516
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,408
And you can't make
the shoes shine unless...

517
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:28,917
They're clean.

518
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:40,922
If everyone knew everything,
there wouldn't be no schools, eh?

519
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:45,025
- Yes.
- Shine shoes like anything else.

520
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,127
It seems so simple now.

521
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:50,731
- Eh, yes and no.
- I'm really sorry, Mr. Johnson.

522
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,744
Don't you be sorry.
Live and learn.

523
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,439
Where have you been?

524
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,846
I put my shoes outside,
they come back dull.

525
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,078
You're gonna come back dull.

526
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:09,282
I told you, don't go anywhere.
Anywhere. Do you hear me?

527
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,294
Anywhere without me.
We're gonna go back today.

528
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:15,297
- I just go down the hall.
- We're going back to Chicago today.

529
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,299
- Why?
- You can't obey orders.

530
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:21,599
Get your stuff. We're outta here.
We're going back to Chicago.

531
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,606
- I can't go back.
- Who the hell do you think you are?

532
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,234
I stepped out of channels.
I put myself out for you.

533
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,244
What did you do for me?
What did I say?

534
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,713
Stick by my side.
One thing, and you couldn't do it.

535
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:34,182
I was your friend,
but you weren't my friend.

536
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:36,651
The hell with you. Go back to Sicily.
Go back to prison.

537
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,245
- We're going to Chicago.
- I can't go back to Chicago.

538
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:43,623
- Why can't you go back to Chicago?
- I no gotta my shoes.

539
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,069
Thank you.

540
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:05,575
Catch me ever doing another favor.

541
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,447
- You mad at me.
- Mad at you? Yeah.

542
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,043
If I come back without you,
they'd kill me. Think that's a joke?

543
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,351
I no gotta answer.
I give my word.

544
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,085
Can we get some coffee in here?

545
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,557
I'm on the corner, 4:00 p.m.

546
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:23,498
He's driving big black car, Lincoln.
He come on the street.

547
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,263
I'm on the street,
I shoot the son of a bitch.

548
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:27,769
Fine.

549
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,141
Yeah. What do you want
to do today?

550
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,678
We go see those nice girls, eh?

551
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:39,876
Yeah, don't take that "we go fishing"
line too seriously, okay?

552
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,884
Everything's for sale
in this town.

553
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,250
Everybody loves ya
when you got the dough.

554
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,881
No. They like us.

555
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:50,893
Yeah, they liked us real good. Everybody
likes you when you're someone else.

556
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,230
Hey, we got one day left.

557
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:57,665
We got one day worth of a good time,
then we go home.

558
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,793
Come in.
I'll get dressed.

559
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:03,135
Let's get outta here,
and you stick by my side.

560
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:06,937
Uh, Jer, there're two friends
of ours, Kenny and Harry...

561
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,774
they wanted to know if perhaps
they could take just a little bit of...

562
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:11,780
Thank you, Billy.

563
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,654
Mr. Johnson.

564
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:31,830
Joseph Vincent sends you greetings
and welcome to Lake Tahoe.

565
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,268
He extends to you this invitation:

566
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,136
To be his guest at his estate
for luncheon today...

567
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,539
if this is convenient
within your plans.

568
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,704
Well, you know,
we have a lot of...

569
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:51,120
If this would be convenient, 1:00 p.m.,
we'll pick you up downstairs.

570
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,622
We'll be waiting in the lobby.

571
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:14,239
We're in some very deep shit.

572
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,057
Okay, now,
look, look, look.

573
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:32,323
Whatever he asks you, say...
no.

574
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:35,832
Whatever he...
You're on vacation.

575
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,493
You don't... You're on...
You don't wanna talk no business.

576
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,661
You don't wanna hear no...

577
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:45,333
So when we get there,
like, if he asks who you are...

578
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:49,106
just let me handle it.

579
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,170
Whatever it is, I'll...

580
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,760
Approved list, the vehicles.

581
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,771
I'm on top of it.

582
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,010
You got a load
of vegetables, 4:00.

583
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,545
- From where?
- Reno.

584
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,739
Stop 'em at the gate
and call me.

585
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,783
- Eggs.
- Anna?

586
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:31,420
Put it in the pantry.

587
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:52,441
Hey, I need to see
about the Chevy.

588
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,179
A dealer from the state line.

589
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:59,215
This is the swing-shift broad?

590
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,615
She used to date with this
whatchamacallit, the big guy.

591
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,847
- Who's this?
- You know, the big guy.

592
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,889
Oh, right, right. So?

593
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,120
Now she's torn between two guys.

594
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:12,286
- And she's hiding the sausage with both?
- She's the one.

595
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:15,661
- And she's the one that stabbed him?
- The same one.

596
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,791
She knocked the other guy's teeth out,
she stabbed him...

597
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,836
and she also knocked
the other guy's teeth out.

598
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:23,737
- I can't believe this.
- It's true. He had caps.

599
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,243
Hey, Jerry, what's a good price
for a '56 Chevy?

600
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,570
Yeah.

601
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,629
It's good to know one's family.

602
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,866
A good man...

603
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:30,933
A good man takes pride in knowing
those who are connected to him.

604
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,440
Would you agree?

605
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,406
I got a big family.

606
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:42,315
And no matter how big that family is,
still we remember all of their names.

607
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,912
From the little one.

608
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,121
So tell me some names.

609
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,622
Names of my family?

610
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:00,261
Is Bruno Gaddo...

611
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:03,864
and little Bruno Gaddo.

612
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:07,304
I don't know them.

613
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,710
See what I mean?
What brings you here?

614
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:21,487
- I no here for talk business.
- We'll talk business later.

615
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:26,018
But now I must know.
What brings you to this occasion?

616
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,663
What a lovely old coin. Is there
anything you can tell me about it?

617
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:10,832
A big man, he know the value
of a small coin.

618
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,973
It's always good to make
a new friend.

619
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:19,207
I haven't heard that
in 35 years.

620
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:57,002
That's a beautiful boat...

621
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,049
and you got beautiful shoes.

622
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:02,141
Even the best shoes wear out.

623
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:05,346
No, you take care...

624
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,356
they last a long time.

625
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:10,258
You watch close.

626
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,961
You look for the crack.

627
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:15,889
And then?

628
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,527
Then you look more close.

629
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,369
Show me your boat.

630
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,998
Best part of the day, isn't it?

631
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:59,136
- You tired, Don Giuseppe?
- You know how it becomes...

632
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,642
the pressures.

633
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:05,506
Gino, stay with me tonight.

634
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,086
Will you stay?

635
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:17,086
You give me your home.
What I can give to you?

636
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,488
This is not an old coin.
It's a new coin.

637
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:55,497
But it, too, is a symbol...

638
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:01,203
and should you ever need
my friendship...

639
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:04,439
you take this coin...

640
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,635
you put it into a telephone...

641
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,644
and you call this number.

642
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:13,849
Whatever you may wish...

643
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:19,345
if it is within the power
of your friend...

644
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:21,481
that wish will be granted.

645
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:55,681
Gino, you got grass stains
on your pants.

646
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,283
Your mama gonna kill you.

647
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:01,353
Have Mr. Johnson's things cleaned,
brought to his room.

648
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,763
We'll talk tonight, after dinner.

649
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:07,234
Mr. Johnson is staying
with us tonight.

650
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:10,932
As much as we'd like to accept
your hospitality...

651
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:15,443
I put him on probation.

652
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:22,275
We're having some people tonight.
Perhaps you know some of them.

653
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:26,789
We'll have some dinner.
We'll talk about shoes.

654
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,882
Tomorrow we go fishing.

655
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,450
Whatever you need,
you talk to my people.

656
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:35,895
Whatever Mr. Johnson requires,
see that he has it.

657
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,900
Otherwise,
see that he is not disturbed.

658
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:43,405
We're going out tomorrow.
We'll take the boat out.

659
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:47,671
I'll show you some fighting fish.
You like northern pike, Gino?

660
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:50,144
First, we're gonna catch 'em,
then we're gonna cook 'em.

661
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,443
Come on, we're goin' over
to the hotel.

662
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,271
So...

663
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,775
how big is your guy?

664
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:30,352
I mean, I never seen the Don pal up that
close with someone like that before.

665
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:38,126
Unless it's something
I shouldn't know.

666
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:46,228
What are they,
friends from the old country?

667
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,088
And how are you
and Mr. Johnson today, sir?

668
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:09,886
You know, we don't gotta do this.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee.

669
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,792
- Somebody check out Mr. Johnson.
- Check out Mr. Johnson.

670
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:17,697
Front, check out Mr. Johnson.
Let's show some service here, can we?

671
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:24,799
What are you doin'?
What the hell are you doin'?

672
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:27,968
I told you no,
we wanna keep a low profile.

673
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,978
What are you crawlin' all over us
the whole time?

674
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:34,005
You don't know who... What? Mr. Johnson?
You don't know Mr. Johnson.

675
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,610
You what? Do you know
what we're doing here?

676
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,177
- I thought...
- What?

677
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,847
I thought you were here
for the meeting.

678
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:44,620
- What meeting?
- Check in, Mr. Green, from Chicago.

679
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:49,256
Mr. Green, good to have you with us
again. Welcome back to the Galaxy.

680
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,391
What time are we due
atJoe Vincent's house?

681
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,526
8:00. You just have time
to change.

682
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,764
- Did you bring the present?
- Yeah.

683
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:01,076
We'll be back from the meeting
by 10:00 and get some sleep.

684
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,305
You look lovely.

685
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,313
Check us in.
I'll be at the tables.

686
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,543
Mr. Green's party is here.

687
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,347
- Do you have the two cars?
- Yes, sir.

688
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:12,353
Have you arranged for
a line of credit in the casino?

689
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,548
- Yes, sir.
- I don't want him showing I.D.

690
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,558
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

691
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,061
Oh, heck.

692
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:56,756
1968396 Chevelle,
sort of a light green.

693
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,666
It's my brother's car.
Oh, it was a cherry car.

694
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:02,670
Had a four-barrel on this sucker.
It was the size of a basketball.

695
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,298
You'd punch it down,
and you'd see the hood cave in.

696
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:07,274
We used to get tanked up,
go to Ridgely, West Virginia.

697
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,277
This place called the Hog Trough.

698
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:16,242
Sorry I'm late. Got a couple things
I want to go over with you guys.

699
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,755
Number one is the cutoff time,
which is 8:15...

700
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:22,484
after which point,
nobody gets in.

701
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,459
They're at the gate after 8:15,
they're an Indian.

702
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:30,261
The second thing is, nobody is anyone
unless I introduce you to 'em.

703
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,028
Listen closely to me now.

704
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:37,198
Better you should have to apologize to
someone what you said to him than, huh?

705
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:40,765
You know what I'm talking about.
Like that time with the guy at the lake.

706
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,665
- Come on.
- What? What for?

707
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,602
- We're going home.
- We don't gotta go until tomorrow.

708
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:12,607
We're cutting short our trip. We got
45 minutes to make our plane to Chicago.

709
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:15,473
- We gonna stay here one more day.
- Forget it.

710
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:18,513
If the guy is wrong, what do you do?
You send him scuba divin'.

711
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,072
That's what you do.
Now go solve my problem for me.

712
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,584
The rest of you guys,
come with me.

713
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:44,035
Oh, Lord, are we in trouble.
Get dressed. Come on.

714
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:04,285
- What?
- I forget my lucky quarter.

715
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,453
Are you nuts? Come on.

716
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:17,398
- How was the weather in Chicago?
- Sleet, rain.

717
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,805
Nothing changes.

718
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:23,311
- Smooth flight?
- Excellent flight, thanks. No problems.

719
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,906
- Hotel treating you well?
- Just fine. How you feeling?

720
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,783
Oh, fine. Never better. You'll find
the food here better than the hotel.

721
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:34,584
- That's what I expected.
- Of course, Max...

722
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:38,491
the same could probably be said
of your place in Chicago.

723
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:40,324
And you don't have to bring
your lunch next time.

724
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:44,457
And now, I want you to meet
my companion, Miss Bates.

725
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:47,969
Miss Bates,
you're an adornment to my home.

726
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:51,336
I have another one. Token of respect
from your friends in Chicago.

727
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:55,810
- A set of dueling pistols.
- Thank you. This is a magnificent gift.

728
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:58,472
- 1827?
- If you say so.

729
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:03,085
Joe, though we are involved in business,
we in the midwest...

730
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:07,179
are never unmindful that our business
is fathered on friendship...

731
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:10,350
and we are honored to be invited
to the home of such a friend.

732
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:13,725
May peace and prosperity
grace your door forever.

733
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:15,991
Thank you, Max.
Thank you very much.

734
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:19,330
- Mr. Silver.
- Thank you for inviting me.

735
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:22,565
It's my pleasure.
Please treat my house as your own.

736
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:25,869
Tonight, there's somebody
I want you to meet.

737
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:27,909
It's a friend of ours.

738
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,945
Oh, there he is now.

739
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:32,572
Seven and one-half.

740
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:35,276
You got a big head.

741
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,686
Max, come here.
There's something I'd like to show you.

742
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:41,450
Thanks for the gift.

743
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:46,228
Did you have a good nap?
Everybody treat you...

744
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:50,595
- Joe! Good to see ya!
- Excuse me. Willie, good of you to come.

745
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,258
- It's been too long.
- Yes, it has.

746
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:54,495
- I brought you a little something.
- Willie, that's magnificent.

747
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,504
Nothing's too good for you, Joe.

748
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:59,370
- We'll talk later.
- Mr. Bagwell.

749
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,433
Ken, good to see you.

750
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:04,968
I think you know
who most of these people are.

751
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:07,277
- It's a life full of business, huh?
- Don Giuseppe...

752
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:09,374
we was planning
to go fishing tomorrow.

753
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:10,976
Don Giuseppe!

754
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:12,486
Giovanni!

755
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:25,398
If I can't stay until tomorrow,
if I gotta go...

756
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:28,335
Joe Vincent.
It's an honor to be in your house.

757
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:30,395
- Howard!
- How you doing?

758
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,566
Fine. Listen, that's a long trip
for you to make.

759
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:36,407
No trip is too far
to pay my respects to you.

760
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,448
I gotta have just a minute
of your time.

761
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:40,948
- All right.
- We...

762
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:43,541
Come over here.
I got a question for you.

763
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:47,020
We'll talk later.
After they've gone, hmm?

764
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51,120
- What is it, Max?
- Look at this. I'm ashamed of you.

765
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:52,626
- I've seen that.
- You have?

766
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:55,562
- Sure, it's my book.
- It came from your library.

767
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:39,907
Come on, come on, come on.

768
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:48,105
We're gonna walk away from here nice
and quiet, like nothing's happening.

769
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,345
And... Will you take off that hat.

770
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,123
Don't drop out on me now.

771
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:01,221
Just a nice stroll
in the evening air.

772
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:03,288
What are we gonna do?

773
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,959
We're gonna find ourselves a car.
We're fine.

774
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,936
Everything is gonna be okay.

775
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:10,938
I no get to say good-bye.

776
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,032
Just keep your nerve.

777
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,543
Don't lose your nerve
on me here.

778
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,815
Just a couple of mice.

779
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:30,350
Come on.

780
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:44,104
Okay.

781
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:52,812
I'm gonna hot-wire the car.
How do you hot-wire the car?

782
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,872
You...

783
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,884
You cross the...

784
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:00,054
Okay.

785
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:11,491
Now, the keystone to the security
system is the infrareds.

786
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:14,001
We have the dogs, and we have them
out on the perimeter...

787
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:16,697
but after that thing last year,
I said...

788
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:19,900
"Why keep them if you can't
believe in them?"

789
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:22,739
In a moment, I'll take you down
and show you.

790
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:26,110
And also, our feeling is...
don't show the guy what to look for.

791
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:28,149
Make them look for everything...

792
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,151
which, in this case, you gotta do.

793
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:34,520
Make 'em wonder about everything,
the point being...

794
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,991
it's not gonna be some dog barking
that he hears.

795
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,255
We got him on the infrareds.

796
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:42,991
The last thing he's gonna hear
is gonna be his heart exploding.

797
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:51,038
Yeah, the key to the security system
is definitely the infrareds.

798
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:54,701
Now look at this car over here.
It's a 1935 Cadillac.

799
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:57,803
They just don't make 'em
like this anymore. I swear.

800
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,384
Hey, what's the matter with ya?
We're going home.

801
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,584
I know where we're going.

802
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:20,100
- What? What?
- We're out of gas.

803
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:27,170
Guy's the head of the Vegas mob.
He can't keep gas in his car.

804
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:29,676
What the hell kind of a country
is this?

805
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:43,191
- You got any money?
- No.

806
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:46,284
- Great. Give me a dollar.
- Okay.

807
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:52,063
Man, I'm running on empty.
It's a good thing we're going home.

808
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:55,797
- We was gonna go fishing tomorrow.
- Who?

809
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,271
- Me and Don Giuseppe.
- You were gonna go fishing?

810
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:01,434
Don Giuseppe found out who you were,
then you were going fishing as the bait.

811
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:05,037
It's okay. We're gonna make it.
You be thankful you're alive.

812
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:07,514
Anybody talks to you on the plane,
you don't say nothin'.

813
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,845
You don't even speak English.

814
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:11,852
We get back to Chicago.
This never happened.

815
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:15,681
Five dollars, please.

816
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:19,694
- I just asked you for a dollar.
- Well, I'm sorry, I didn't hear.

817
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:22,287
Okay, look, it s a misunderstanding.
We got a plane to catch.

818
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:27,733
- But you owe me four bucks.
- Yeah, we're gonna send it to you.

819
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:30,067
I'd love to help you. Can't.

820
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:35,671
Look, I don't want any trouble.
Do you know who this is?

821
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:39,009
I don't know, and I don't care.
You owe me four dollars.

822
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:42,175
Look, I didn't ask for the gas,
and I don't got time for this chat, pal.

823
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,843
- We're sending you the money.
- No.

824
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:45,853
I think not, mister.

825
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:51,490
Why don't you just wait here
until we work this out.

826
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,585
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm calling the cops.

827
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,926
I gotta catch a plane.
Gimme the keys.

828
01:13:55,998 --> 01:14:00,264
You took the gas, you can't pay for it.
That's called theft.

829
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:01,768
Oh, hell.

830
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:06,270
Please, gimme a break.
Gimme a break.

831
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,741
We're gonna catch a plane.

832
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:10,745
Treat a working man like this?

833
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,213
You didn't work for that gas.
I worked for that gas.

834
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:17,082
- Yeah, let me speak to the sheriff.
- Look, man. Look, man, please.

835
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:21,088
We have to catch the plane.
Just give me back the key.

836
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:31,930
I'm holding for the sheriff.

837
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,232
Throw your ass in jail,
trying to defraud me.

838
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,239
What are we gonna do now?

839
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:42,374
We drive home.

840
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:47,347
Look, look, look, a plane ticket
to Chicago. I give you the ticket.

841
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:51,045
I trade you the ticket
for a full tank of gas.

842
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,577
You're going to give me a ticket
to Chicago for a tank of gas?

843
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,022
You give us a full tank of gas,
and we get out of here.

844
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,870
Where's my jacket?

845
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:30,024
I have no idea who some people think
they are. I swear that I don't.

846
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:35,553
- Just when things were going so well.
- Yeah, let me speak to the sheriff.

847
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:39,499
The sheriff.
This is Jack at the gas station.

848
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:41,502
I'll hold.

849
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:44,004
The car's probably stolen too.

850
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:58,647
- You want a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

851
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:02,622
Hello, Sheriff. Yeah, this is Jack,
down at the gas station.

852
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:04,886
I got a couple of fellas
down here who...

853
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,087
Take the money.

854
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:09,126
Hold on.

855
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,170
Never mind. It's all right.

856
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:27,981
We go now.

857
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:31,385
Your key.

858
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,690
- Come on.
- Here's your change. Thank you.

859
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,046
What is this place like?

860
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:42,852
You eat, you sleep,
you got a job.

861
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:47,088
You go and do your job.
You don't, you stay in your cell.

862
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:51,995
And we'll have people there for you.

863
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:54,092
Sure, there's people there.

864
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:56,501
Yeah, there's lots of people there.

865
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:00,708
I can handle this.

866
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:06,244
Don't tell me you can handle it.

867
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:08,976
You never know
till they close that door...

868
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:11,383
and then you find out.

869
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:15,355
And then I find out.

870
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:17,358
That's right.

871
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,620
Then I get out...

872
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,529
and you come and see me
in my boat.

873
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:27,534
Yeah, I'll come see you
in your boat.

874
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:30,730
Sun come up and we fish.
Sun go down, we drink.

875
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,909
We talk about old times.

876
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:37,740
We talk about number 12.

877
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:39,906
Yeah, okay.

878
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:46,284
It's not such a long time.

879
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:51,959
What's the big deal?

880
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:55,988
That's right.

881
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:40,563
Well?

882
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:46,765
What do you think time it is?

883
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,443
5:00, 5:15.

884
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,371
Well, we got about five hours.

885
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:55,416
What do you wanna do?

886
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:17,235
I wish you didn't have to go.

887
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:27,281
- Don't go.
- I gotta go.

888
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:29,510
You know I gotta go.

889
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:32,018
- No, you could...
- A deal, it's a deal.

890
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,520
The hell with the deal.

891
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:36,648
The deal is they're buying three years
of your life for pocket change.

892
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:40,491
You come out of there an old man,
a bunch of money don't mean shit.

893
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:45,629
- What "eh"?
- I got a deal.

894
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,759
Three years in prison.

895
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:51,772
I get out, I go back, I buy my boat.

896
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:55,576
You buy your boat.

897
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:58,943
Know what your money's gonna buy in
three years? It won't buy a toothbrush.

898
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:02,006
What do you...
Three years of your life.

899
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:05,382
You... No, this is not a deal,
it's a hustle.

900
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:08,684
They hustled you.
Three years for three days.

901
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,021
I give my word.

902
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:24,127
You walk. You could walk.

903
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:26,298
I go in the bathroom,
I slip in the tub.

904
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:28,399
- Jerry...
- You walk, who's gonna know?

905
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:31,001
Who's gonna know?
Who's gonna find you? No one.

906
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:33,809
Who's gonna look for you?
Go on, go on.

907
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:36,950
Go on, get outta here.

908
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,849
Get out of here.
Get the hell out of here.

909
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,890
Get outta here!

910
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:30,295
What the hell do you want?

911
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:35,332
We have a good time
in Lake Tahoe, eh?

912
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:38,641
We drink champagne
with the girls.

913
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:41,978
The guy on stage say,
"Mr. Johnson, take a bow."

914
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:44,644
They'd break their word to you.

915
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:49,213
Maybe yes and maybe no.
What they do, no matter.

916
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:51,224
I give my word.

917
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,895
I give <i>my</i> word.

918
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:05,439
I gonna miss you.

919
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:12,479
You stupid son of a bitch.

920
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,481
You gonna miss me too?

921
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,585
I ain't missing no dummy
don't know when to run.

922
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:23,382
- You know what I mean?
- No.

923
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:27,459
Yeah. I'll miss you
all my life.

924
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:29,622
Get outta here, you stupid lame.

925
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:34,296
Where you going?

926
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,498
I gonna shave.

927
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:33,383
- What?
- Can I come in?

928
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:34,887
Yeah, yeah.

929
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:39,919
- What are you doing here?
- Come to walk you guys over.

930
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:42,929
- We got till 10:00.
- They want you there at 8:00.

931
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:51,461
So what have you guys
been doing in here three days?

932
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:53,131
Playing gin.

933
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:07,152
The guy's here to take us over.
We're going over early.

934
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:23,529
Where we goin'?

935
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:27,534
I thought we'd take a walk by the lake,
give him some air in his lungs.

936
01:28:45,086 --> 01:28:48,055
- You guys have a nice weekend?
- Yeah.

937
01:28:48,122 --> 01:28:53,355
- Does he know his confession?
- Yeah. Frankie, what's going on?

938
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:56,022
I told you.
We're taking a walk.

939
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:10,910
Hey, we gotta get to court.

940
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:15,741
He ain't goin' to court.

941
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:29,654
He knows his stuff.

942
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:32,165
He's gonna keep his word.

943
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:39,829
Jerry, the thing was, our guy needed
two days to get out of town.

944
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:42,171
This doesn't work.
The whole thing was...

945
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:46,577
set this guy up, get his prints
on the gun, get a confession.

946
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:50,708
Later, he gets remorse,
the murder he did. He kills himself.

947
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:54,312
We stick the confession
in his pocket. Life goes on.

948
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,946
It's cleaner this way.

949
01:29:58,326 --> 01:30:02,285
The Don said, tell him to be at
the 28th district, 10:00, Monday.

950
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:07,323
That's right. He said tell him to be at
the 28th. He didn't say take him there.

951
01:30:08,636 --> 01:30:11,070
Nobody told me
this was gonna be the thing.

952
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:15,505
He had a deal.

953
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:19,008
Things change.

954
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,688
You son of a bitch.
What the...

955
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:31,088
Who are you, all of you?
Make a deal with the man.

956
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:33,753
You set the guy up,
promise him this, do the thing.

957
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:35,489
He does it, stands up.

958
01:30:35,563 --> 01:30:37,497
- Hey, Jerry!
- Come on, come on.

959
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:40,500
You're telling me the things
you promised this guy, lied to him.

960
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:42,798
You're gonna turn around
and kill him?

961
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:47,034
I'm not gonna kill him.
You're gonna kill him.

962
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:51,636
You're gonna kill him, pal.

963
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:55,341
You wanted to square yourself,
get off probation.

964
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:57,782
What do you think the thing is,
sitting in a hotel three days...

965
01:30:57,852 --> 01:31:00,377
order room service,
that's gonna get you back in?

966
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:04,118
That's not the job.
This is the job.

967
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:09,159
You come up to his head,
you shoot him right above the eye.

968
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:11,926
Put the gun in his hand,
let it fall.

969
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:15,998
You got two minutes.

970
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:21,074
Hey, man, you can't make me
do this.

971
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:26,011
Hey, I'm not making you do anything.
You turn it down, you turn it down.

972
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,675
You can't handle it,
I handle it.

973
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:33,612
What?

974
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:39,285
- Something happened.
- What?

975
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:43,983
We got a different situation.

976
01:32:45,826 --> 01:32:48,260
I don't even know how to say it.

977
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:02,508
I see.

978
01:33:04,111 --> 01:33:08,047
Didn't I tell you to run?
I told you to run.

979
01:33:08,115 --> 01:33:10,242
I threw you out of the hotel,
and you came back.

980
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:12,650
I told you to go.
I told you.

981
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:16,178
- Why didn't you go?
- I gave my word.

982
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:22,089
You gave your word.
You gave your word.

983
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:26,429
- Hey, Jerry!
- Hey, fantastic! You gave your word.

984
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,468
- Hey, Jerry.
- I said I'm gonna do it.

985
01:33:28,536 --> 01:33:31,801
I gave my word.
Everybody gave their goddamn word.

986
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,043
Oh, God.

987
01:33:39,013 --> 01:33:41,208
Hey, what are you gonna do?

988
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:44,274
What are you gonna do?
You gonna shoot me?

989
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:46,684
You gonna shoot me?

990
01:33:46,754 --> 01:33:50,781
Shoot yourself, shoot yourself.
You're dead.

991
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:57,558
Great. Now I'm dead.

992
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,897
You're dead. We're all dead.

993
01:34:09,877 --> 01:34:12,311
You got the keys to the car?

994
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:18,074
I only...
I just keep...

995
01:34:24,425 --> 01:34:26,859
What? What?

996
01:34:27,928 --> 01:34:30,192
I gotta make a phone call.

997
01:34:30,264 --> 01:34:32,198
What phone call?

998
01:34:37,905 --> 01:34:39,839
What phone call?

999
01:34:41,642 --> 01:34:45,237
Don Giuseppe say,
"If you ever need my friendship..."

1000
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:51,448
Are you nuts?

1001
01:35:01,662 --> 01:35:05,120
Yes, I make a collect call
to Mr. Joseph Vincent...

1002
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,463
from Gino Gaddo in Chicago.

1003
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:09,901
- Great.
- Gino Gaddo...

1004
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:15,237
collect to Mr. Joseph Vincent
at this number, and thank you.

1005
01:35:32,793 --> 01:35:37,730
The defendant, having pled guilty
to murder in the first degree...

1006
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:41,734
and in the absence
of extenuating circumstances...

1007
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:46,565
we have no alternative
but to sentence the defendant...

1008
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,336
to the maximum allowed by law.

1009
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:53,676
The term of imprisonment
of 20 years to life.

1010
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:04,356
Do you have anything
you want to say?

1011
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:09,354
The car comes on the corner
at 4:00 p.m.

1012
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:13,196
I shot the son of a bitch
three times in the heart.
