1
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,773
First, you need to know
something about them.

2
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,275
The beautiful ones.

3
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,944
The flawless four.

4
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,613
Everyone wanted to be them.

5
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,158
You know them.
They went to your school too.

6
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,286
They totally ruled.

7
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,538
The one in green, that's Courtney.

8
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:43,125
She was the leader.
She was like Satan in heels.

9
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,837
The blonde, Marcie Fox,
a legend in her own little mind.

10
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,964
Known to herself as Foxy.

11
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:54,178
The leggy one with the pigtails
is Julie, doomed to be popular
because of that face

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,807
and because she was best friends
with the one in the pink.

13
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,477
That's Liz Purr.

14
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,146
She was special.

15
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,900
Everybody loved Liz,

16
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:12,154
not just because she was beautiful
and popular and rich and smart.

17
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,824
She was all of those things,
but more than anything,

18
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,910
she was sweet.

19
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,997
Courtney ruled with terror,
but Liz ruled with kindness.

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,042
She was like the Princess Di
of Reagan High,

21
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,212
and that pissed Courtney off.

22
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,006
Liz Purr was just...

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,803
Well, she was perfect.

24
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:40,057
I used to dream about what
it would be like to be her:

25
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,726
Elizabeth Purr.

26
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,356
It's a shame about
what happened to Liz.

27
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,943
That was no way to wake up
on your 17th birthday.

28
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,226
Ah!
She is gonna die!

29
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:28,564
It's so much better than last year.
I wish my friends did that for me.

30
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:32,067
Yeah, right. You'd have us killed.
Brutally maimed, my dear.

31
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,360
What're we gonna do to her?

32
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,238
We'll stuff her pretty face
with pancakes,

33
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,409
then tie her to the flagpole
in her bra and undies
and watch the fun begin.

34
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,371
Whoo!
She is gonna die! Ha, ha, ha.

35
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,759
Polaroid.

36
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,762
Hey, birthday girl, rise and shine!

37
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,099
Who's doing the honors?
Me.

38
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,768
Aren't we anxious?

39
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,312
One is for witch,

40
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,397
two is for bitch...

41
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,274
Pop it, Marcie!

42
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,901
Surprise!

43
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,278
Oh, my God.

44
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,614
What happened to her?
What's in her throat?

45
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,657
Courtney?

46
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:35,047
Oh, my God.

47
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,343
This is a joke, right?
This is a total joke.
Say it's a joke.

48
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,054
- It was supposed to be for fun.
- Oh, my God!

49
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,516
This isn't happening.
I just didn't want her to scream.

50
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,060
Oh, God.
Oh, God, Liz!

51
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,688
I thought a jawbreaker
would be funny.

52
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,483
You gagged her
with a jawbreaker?

53
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,305
We have to call someone
right now.

54
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,850
No way.
Why not? It was an accident.

55
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,979
Oh, my God,
did you hear that?

56
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,315
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Sick?

57
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,736
That's it. Liz is sick.

58
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,822
Courtney, she is dead.
Does school know that? Don't think so.

59
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,993
What? You cannot just call
in sick for her.
We have to tell somebody.

60
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,496
Liz is--
Dead. Liz is dead.

61
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,832
Do you have any idea
what that means?

62
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,377
You're a shoo-in for prom queen?
That is so not funny.

63
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,546
Our best friend is dead.

64
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,506
People won't be pleased.

65
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,718
But they'll understand.
No. You understand.

66
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,511
I am not getting fucked

67
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,265
because I was sweet enough
to play a clever prank
for my friend's birthday.

68
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,393
Just give me the phone.

69
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,648
Okay, who's got
the motherly voice?

70
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,445
No. No way.
I want nothing
to do with this.

71
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,530
Okay.

72
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,700
Wait, Courtney--
Shh.

73
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,371
Ms. Sherwood, please.

74
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,251
Hi, Ms. Sherwood,
this is Mrs. Purr,
Elizabeth's mother.

75
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,672
I'm sorry, but Elizabeth
won't be to school today.

76
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,217
Oh, I know,
she's had a lot of absences,

77
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,387
but the poor dear woke up
with a blistering fever.

78
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,557
Can you send one of her friends
with her assignments?

79
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,060
Thank you ever so much.

80
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,479
Have a nice day. Bye.

81
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,816
That was really good.

82
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:05,984
What do you mean?

83
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:10,197
The way you imitated Liz's mom.
I'm just saying you're in control.

84
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,242
Oh. I know.

85
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:23,210
Okay, reality check.
Liz is in the trunk
of this car, and she is dead.

86
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,629
That is a sad,
fucked up thing.

87
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,842
But you will walk into
that school and strut
your shit down the hallway

88
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,594
like everything is
peachy fucking keen.

89
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,221
Get it?

90
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,098
Julie?

91
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,933
Whatever.

92
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,880
All right, bitches, out.

93
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,341
Move it, move it!

94
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,551
That means you too, gusher.

95
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,348
Come on.

96
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,228
Hi, Julie.

97
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,314
Oh. Hi, Fern.

98
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,650
No, no, no,
space cadet.

99
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,528
Drinking fountain
down the hall.

100
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,157
I don't think I can
do this.

101
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:39,161
It's just a day,
like any other day.

102
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,789
Now, what would we do
on any other day?

103
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,375
Pre-lunch touchups?

104
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,543
That's right, Marcie.

105
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,172
Take a long, hard look
in the mirror, girls.

106
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:53,759
It's beauty time.

107
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,855
Hello, girls. Having a smoke?
A toke? Some dope?

108
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,359
No loitering in the
girl's room.
Trouble brews in this room.

109
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,028
Not so fast.
Elizabeth is out today.

110
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:17,199
Which one of you will stop by
my office to pick up
her assignments for her?

111
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,368
Miss Shane?
With pleasure, Ms. Sherwood.

112
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,788
Excellent. Make it by 3.
I have a pet to groom.

113
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,249
Okay.
And Miss Shane,

114
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:30,587
please cover your bosoms.
This is a learning institution,
not a brothel.

115
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,131
Do it yourself.

116
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,967
Be nice, girls.

117
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,223
"Be nice, girls."

118
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,641
Nice is not enough.

119
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,978
lf I was friends with
every Pam, Beth and Sherry
because they're nice,

120
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,439
I'd have Noah's fucking Ark
in my phone book.

121
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,109
Oh.

122
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,487
Remember, everything
is peachy keen.

123
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,990
Peachy fucking keen.

124
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,952
I know this a bit out of our realm
of comprehension.

125
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:07,082
The delusion, the derangement,
the descent into madness.

126
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,628
She says it herself,
"What's done cannot be undone."

127
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,299
I know this may be hard to understand.

128
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:20,637
It's not like your lives today, what with
your acne mask and corn dogs.

129
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,894
Planet head.
It's nothing to laugh about.

130
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:32,107
There was nothing fun and fancy free
for Shakespeare's tragic characters.

131
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:37,321
In the Dark Ages,
knowledge of female anatomy

132
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,823
was divulged through autopsy

133
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,618
and execution.

134
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,787
Women deemed
Hey, baby.

135
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,831
criminal or demented were
put to death,

136
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,710
both on and off their menstrual flow.

137
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:57,966
Then we crack the egg ever so gently,
but with ample force.

138
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,979
Cool, you got a stillborn.

139
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,190
Oh, nasty.

140
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,198
I say we just put her back in bed.

141
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,825
We can't put her back in bed.

142
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,995
Why not?
She's got a jawbreaker in her throat.

143
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,832
Ah. We can get it out.
I've got eyelash curlers.

144
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:34,003
It's perfect. She was up late,
watching TV, sucking on a jawbreaker.

145
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:38,382
Maybe she was practicing,
if you know what I mean,
ha-ha, and swallowed.

146
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,554
Wait a minute.
What?

147
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,098
Rape.

148
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,018
They'll check to see if she was raped.

149
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,187
Maybe Liz had a friend over.

150
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,481
You know,
mummy and Daddy's last night away.

151
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,110
Maybe he's from school, maybe not.
But definitely into kink.

152
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,529
He got a little rough, went too far.

153
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,699
There's a fine line
between pleasure and pain.

154
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:08,412
She screamed for help,
but her screams were muffled
by the huge candy ball.

155
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:13,417
She tried, but there was nothing.
Only sugary, sweet death.

156
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,880
Oh, my God. That, like,
totally gave me the chills.

157
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,467
Nobody's gonna believe that.
There is no proof.

158
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,969
They will because
it's their worst nightmare.

159
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:28,599
Elizabeth Purr,
the very picture of teenage
perfection, obliterated by perversion?

160
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,893
You are sick, Courtney.

161
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,730
Shit! I was supposed
to pick up Liz's homework.

162
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,359
What if Ms. Sherwood took it?
We kill her.

163
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,654
Heh. Did you see her face?

164
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,783
It doesn't matter
that I have to get there.

165
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,744
Yes? Yes?

166
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,789
Ms. Sherwood?

167
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,750
Oh. Hello, Fern.

168
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,836
I wanted to know
if you were gonna chaperone

169
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,963
the botany club's garden party.

170
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,677
Yes, I am. Of course,
I wouldn't miss that for the world.

171
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:10,349
Ahem. You know, Fern, do you know
a senior named Elizabeth Purr?

172
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,934
You mean the meow?

173
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,644
Excuse me?

174
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,856
Liz is the cat's meow.

175
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:24,363
Heh. I'm sure she is. In any case,
the poor thing is sick with the flu.

176
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,700
Somebody has to take her
her assignments
and Miss Shane tardy.

177
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,118
I could do it.

178
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,287
You will?
It'd be an honor.

179
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,790
Oh, thank you so much.

180
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,834
Thank you.

181
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,753
Fern! Uh-- Ahem.

182
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,880
I didn't give her the address.

183
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,218
Ms. Sherwood, wait!

184
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,721
Ms. Sherwood.

185
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,181
Ms. Sherwood.

186
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,646
Miss Shane.
I forgot to pick up Liz's homework.

187
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:02,109
Right, you were tardy.
But, thankfully, Fern Mayo
stopped by my office.

188
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,736
She's on her way right now.

189
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,155
Mayonnaise?
Liz hates her.

190
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,825
Hate is a very ugly word, Miss Fox.

191
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,661
Fern Mayo is a dependable
young woman.

192
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:16,874
She may not be pretty like you,
but she gives as well as receives.

193
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:21,378
We could learn a thing or two
from the Fern Mayos of the world,
couldn't we?

194
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,509
We have to get there before Mayo.

195
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,193
That is no 1 05 pounds.

196
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,443
God, she's so stiff.

197
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,529
No more aerobics for this girl. Ugh!

198
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,282
Panties on or off?
Rip them.

199
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:29,298
Let's see. lf I were being choked,
I'd claw the sheets to smithereens.

200
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,885
Should we shred them?
No time.

201
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,481
Hi, Liz.

202
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:51,653
Hi, Liz. My name's Fern Mayo.

203
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,156
Like hold the mayo?

204
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,910
You don't know me,

205
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,870
but I know you.

206
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,122
Help me get her legs. Ugh!

207
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,999
What're you doing to me?

208
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,168
Oh, my God.
What're you doing to me?

209
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:10,005
I'm so sorry.
It's from last year's prank.

210
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,676
It's one of those cards.
You push a button, record a greeting.

211
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,011
You open it--
What're you doing to me?

212
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,846
Oh, my God. Stop it!

213
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,433
It's like she's in here with us. Alive.

214
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,852
Don't touch anything.
Let's just do this and get out.

215
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,855
I love your hair.

216
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,401
I love the way it shines.

217
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,039
What?
She looked at me.

218
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,377
I swear to God,
she looked at me.

219
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,088
Her eyes are open.
She has to look somewhere.

220
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:55,426
My God, Marcie, she's dead. Relax.

221
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,405
Liz?

222
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,075
How's that?

223
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,369
Very natural.
Thank you.

224
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,587
Liz?

225
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,507
Jules?

226
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,386
I need your seal
of approval here.

227
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,601
Now come over here
and check it out.

228
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,395
- Does it look real?
- I can't do this. No!

229
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,689
Liz?
Did you hear that?

230
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,650
You're being paranoid.
Will you relax?

231
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,778
I killed Liz, the teen dream.

232
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,113
Deal with it.

233
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,782
I have to get out of here.

234
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,325
What?

235
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,785
What's wrong?

236
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,120
You don't understand.
I'm not doing this.

237
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:09,291
- I don't want anything to do with this.
- It's a little late for that.

238
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:13,504
Courtney, please. I want to go to the
police, tell them it was an accident.

239
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,172
We didn't mean to kill her.

240
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,841
The police will come
when her parents find the body.

241
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,593
She was raped.

242
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,263
You can't just say that
because she's in bed
with her legs spread.

243
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,808
I can't believe this!
I am looking after us.

244
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,477
I am saving your ass,
and you shit on me.

245
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,229
Go to hell, Courtney.

246
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,441
Fern?

247
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,822
You're Fern Mayo, right?

248
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,493
I'm Courtney.
I don't think we've officially met,

249
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,705
what with the cruel politics
of high school and all.

250
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,125
Hi.
May I introduce Marcie Fox?

251
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,876
Foxy.

252
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,673
Fern, I need you to be
completely honest with us.

253
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:01,510
And I know you will be, because
you're an honest kind of gal.

254
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,973
Tell us, did you hear anything?
And let's not lie.

255
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,100
I have this gift. I can smell a lie.

256
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,977
Leave her alone,
Courtney.

257
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,772
Fern is a big girl, Julie.
She can speak for herself.

258
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,233
Fern, come on,
I'm gonna take you home.

259
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,568
Homework.

260
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,530
What?
I was sent with Liz's homework.

261
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,575
Isn't that nice? Heh, heh.
And you heard us?

262
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,036
It's okay.
Fern.

263
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,871
No one's gonna hurt you.

264
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,540
I don't know.
She doesn't know.

265
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,210
We're all girlfriends here.
It's just between us.

266
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:36,879
What do you know?

267
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,882
She doesn't know anything.

268
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,301
Come on, Fern.
Say what you heard.

269
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,763
Come on, Fern. Say it!
What did you hear?

270
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,727
Marcie, get her!

271
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,323
Let her go.

272
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,242
- Have a little scare, dear?
- Boo!

273
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:12,831
I'll come clean with you, Fern,
because once our bloated boo-boo
floats to the surface,

274
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,460
it'll all become clear
in that little head of yours, anyway.

275
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:19,755
And we wouldn't want you
to do anything rash, would we?

276
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,549
No. Uh-uh.
You knew Liz Purr, right?

277
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,052
I know of her.

278
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,764
Knew of her. Past tense.
She's dead, Fern. She died.

279
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:32,476
But we've got a bit of a problem
because you know we did it.

280
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:36,980
You heard us. That gives you
a little something called power.

281
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,651
The power to tell. And you're
the kind of girl that tells.

282
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,111
A tattletale.

283
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,697
A rat.

284
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,952
I know you.
I know all about you.

285
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,997
You're the one in the corner
that the geeks won't dance with
because they're at home

286
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:58,293
fucking old pervs in cyberspace,
thinking they're doing some hot babe.

287
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,588
There's nothing to hide, Fern.
You're nothing.

288
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,632
We're everything.

289
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:06,385
You're the shadow, we're the sun.

290
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,722
But I'm here to offer you
something you never dreamed of.

291
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:14,518
Something that you were
never meant to be, but will be.

292
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,311
Because today, Fern, my dear,

293
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:20,190
fate has decided that you are cool.

294
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:23,110
We're gonna make you...

295
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,154
one of us.

296
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,157
Beautiful, popular,

297
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,325
loved, feared.

298
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,494
All you've ever dreamed of.

299
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:39,168
lf, and only if, you never,
ever tell anyone what you heard.

300
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,045
Think of it.

301
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,921
This is sick, Courtney.

302
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,841
You don't own someone
by making them beautiful.

303
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,843
A makeover can't hide the truth.

304
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:51,430
Liz is gone, Fern.

305
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,184
Take her place.

306
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,853
You know you want it.

307
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:01,273
Think about boys.
Think about prom.

308
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,734
They'll be lining up
for you.

309
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,527
Not with oil.
But with drive.

310
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:10,032
- Watch the eyes come alive.
- You as me, as us.

311
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,241
A dash of magenta.

312
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,951
Lashes bold, black.

313
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,704
- X-rated gloss.
- Lips full.

314
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,208
- Hair frames the portrait.
- Some gilded.

315
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:23,587
Color, the secret to not growing old.
We cut, layer and curl.

316
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,341
- For a look that is you.
- For the hair of a dead girl.

317
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:28,926
We use model glue.

318
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,886
- Lips full and dark.
- Lush.

319
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:34,306
A fine line that traces
a deep, crimson heart.

320
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:38,644
- Rest now, sweetness.
- Till the day all shall see

321
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,896
the beauty we molded

322
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:44,441
from sheer misery.

323
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,460
Elizabeth!

324
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,545
Honey, we're home.

325
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,206
Stand straight.

326
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,333
- Stop shaking.
- I'm sorry.

327
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,710
I still can't get over myself.

328
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,045
Oh, fresh meat!

329
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:31,632
To think, my 2nd-grade teacher said
I had no artistic potential.

330
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
It's like a dream.

331
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:37,012
I made you and I'm God.
That's all you need to know.

332
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:39,807
No.

333
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:43,394
Oh, my God, Julie is sitting
with the body-art rejects.

334
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:46,730
- Is she tweaking?
- It's a beautiful thing.

335
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:50,401
To make someone fall so far, so fast.

336
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,404
Look what the kitty dragged in.
Meow.

337
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:56,573
You look really great, Fern.

338
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,075
Thank you.

339
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:02,371
I thought you should know
that Liz's parents came home
this morning.

340
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:03,914
So?

341
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,959
So I think we should
tell someone
what happened.

342
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:10,129
There's nothing to tell.
I made cocksure of that last night.

343
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:12,881
What does that mean?

344
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,384
Girls, why don't you run ahead?

345
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:20,889
Listen, bitch, one word
and you're over. I mean that.

346
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,975
I'm not scared of you anymore.

347
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:25,352
We saw you.
We all know you did it.

348
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:28,731
No one will ever believe you.
Ask Fern.

349
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,982
Ask Marcie.

350
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,901
We saw everything.

351
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,070
Fucking liar.

352
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,281
One word and you perish.

353
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,241
I promise you that.

354
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:40,576
Toodles.

355
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,127
Fern, no!

356
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,087
What are you doing?

357
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,299
God. Tuna munch?
But my mom always--

358
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,427
We never eat at lunch.
Do you understand me?

359
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:00,554
For some damn good reason we did,

360
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,807
we would never, ever eat
out of a brown paper bag.

361
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,436
I don't care if there's
a four-star culinary masterpiece in it.

362
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,022
Get rid of it.
Sorry.

363
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,692
lf I get a zit because of this--
I'm sorry.

364
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,155
I'd better never have kids.
I have zero patience. Ha, ha, ha.

365
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:24,161
Don't think we're anorexic, we're not.
That's for the Karen Carpenter table.

366
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,954
We're not stupid. We eat.

367
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:29,833
And we eat well.
We just don't eat in public.

368
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:33,837
Well, at school, at least.
We don't want people
judging us by what we eat.

369
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,840
It gives them ammo,
and the only ones with ammo are us.

370
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,134
Food's cool and all.
You need it to live.

371
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:43,222
But the mere act of eating
invokes thoughts of digestion,

372
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:48,060
flatulation, defecation, even,
shall we say, complexion defection.

373
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,729
I wouldn't be caught dead
eating a greasy pizza.

374
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:54,566
Not even in front of the
uItra-special students,
the deaf, dumb and the blind.

375
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:58,654
because they're associating that
greasy pizza with your shiny face.

376
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:01,990
A zit, a blackhead,
a cluster of pores.

377
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:04,326
It's another vexing stress
we don't need.

378
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,745
Life is hard enough
without added anxiety.

379
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:09,748
So are introductions
in order?

380
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,542
Dane, this is--
Violette.

381
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,919
Hm. Pretty name.

382
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,214
You're a transfer or what?
Dane, let's not perplex her.

383
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:21,385
She's had a trying morning
with the trauma of
changing schools and all.

384
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:25,889
Reagan's a whole new battlefield,
and we were on the subject of...

385
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:28,684
strategy.

386
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,022
But come by a little later.

387
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:36,191
I don't know about you,
but I could do with some kink.

388
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,235
You got it, baby.

389
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,114
Nice meeting you--
Violette.

390
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,366
Yeah, that. See you, Foxy.

391
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,202
Sit on it, Dane.
Heh, heh, heh.

392
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,288
Violette?

393
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Mm-hm.

394
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:52,541
I like it.

395
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:56,587
It's called thinking on your toes,
a must if you're going
to rule the school.

396
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:59,423
I was thinking, Fern.
It's a plant, right?

397
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:03,218
I don't know about you,
but I would much rather be a flower.

398
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:04,720
A rose? Too obvious.

399
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:07,556
Never send a rose unless
dyed black as a warning.

400
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:09,308
And if one is sent to you,

401
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,436
destroy it, along with the sender.
Emotionally, of course.

402
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,396
It's not like we kill people.

403
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,610
On purpose.

404
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,031
Anyway,

405
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:27,242
you're extra fancy. You're Violette.

406
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,912
My Violette.

407
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:55,688
May I help you?
I'm Detective Vera Cruz.

408
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:59,191
I need some information
about one of your students:
Elizabeth Purr.

409
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:03,445
Oh, my.

410
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,121
Julie!

411
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:15,457
What are you doing
waiting for the bus?

412
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,127
Don't ask.
What happened to your friends?

413
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:21,296
I don't want to talk about it, Zach.

414
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:25,134
Well, can I give you a lift?
Okay.

415
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,393
Cool car.
Thanks.

416
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,605
You shined today.
You've got the look,
the walk.

417
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,858
But popularity is fleeting.
Trends change.

418
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:42,985
People change.
It's all about details.

419
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,654
Pay attention to details.
Look at my nails.

420
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:49,992
In junior high, I wore
only pink. Now it makes
me puke. So I change.

421
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:53,203
See? It's called Demented.
Seriously, the color's
called Demented.

422
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,122
Mine? Decayed.

423
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:58,208
Like Julie. Our friendship
with her is decayed. Rot.

424
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:01,420
Julie is over.
Done, null and void.

425
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:04,673
In two weeks, no one will know her.
Including you.

426
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:07,468
From now on, you don't know her.
Never knew her.

427
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:10,929
She's like Fern Mayo. A bad dream.
Get it?

428
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,160
Well, thanks for the lift.

429
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,536
It's no problem.

430
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,372
Okay.

431
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:47,049
So do you wanna, maybe,
call me sometime?

432
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:50,052
Yeah. I would love to.
Yeah?

433
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:05,859
Well, bye.
Okay.

434
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,414
Mayo, please. It's a residence.

435
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:13,385
Hello?

436
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:18,057
Fern? Hi, it's me, Julie.

437
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:20,309
Oh, hi, Julie.

438
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,895
I know you're not
supposed to talk to me.

439
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,813
No, no. It's okay.

440
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:28,275
This must be really weird for you.
Yeah.

441
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:32,154
I mean, knowing about
what happened to Liz

442
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,490
and everything else.

443
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:36,867
Yeah.

444
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:40,996
Fern, do you remember 4th grade?

445
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:44,500
Fourth grade?
Yeah, we used to have sleepovers.

446
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:48,462
Remember my Holly Hobbie oven?
Your parents wouldn't
let you have one.

447
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,382
They were afraid you were gonna
electrocute yourself.

448
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:54,843
We used to bake cakes together.

449
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:57,680
God, they were the worst cakes.

450
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:06,855
I'm scared, Fern.

451
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:10,693
I'm really scared.

452
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:17,032
It's just weird
how time erases things.

453
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:20,869
Time doesn't erase things.
People erase things.

454
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,664
Yeah.

455
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:25,708
People erase people.

456
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:29,420
Can you hold on for a second?

457
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,759
Hello?
Never answer after one ring.

458
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,637
What were you thinking, Violette?
Hi, Courtney.

459
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,848
Are you on the other line?

460
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:44,059
No.
Good. When I call, you listen.

461
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:49,064
I don't care if your little sister
locks herself in the kitchen freezer,
Courtney Shane is priority one.

462
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:50,733
Get it?

463
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:23,891
I brought you something sweet.

464
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:25,976
Hm.

465
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:28,937
What is it?
It's called a Big Stick.

466
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,231
A Big Stick?
Uh-huh.

467
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:32,816
You want it?

468
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,485
I want you.

469
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:38,447
And I want you to suck
the Big Stick.

470
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:43,118
God, you're a little sick.
I said I could do with a little kink.

471
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:45,996
Now suck it and see
or get the hell out.

472
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,627
Do you like it?

473
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:53,295
It's okay.

474
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:58,467
Okay? There's nothing kinky
about "okay," now, is there?

475
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:02,721
Now I said, do you like it?

476
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:08,143
Yeah. Yeah, I like it.
Heh, heh, heh.

477
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:11,855
You're good at that.
I'm good at a lot of things.

478
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:14,566
I should have known.
You are on the wrestling team.

479
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,318
Hey, fuck you.

480
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,654
Hey.

481
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:22,491
Now, right about now,
I could get really hot.

482
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:25,452
Oh, yeah.
And I mean...

483
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,037
hot.

484
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:30,165
You know what I like to do
when I get hot?

485
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:33,085
Oh, yeah, baby.

486
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:34,753
I want to, Dane.

487
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:37,589
I want to real bad.

488
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:39,758
The problem is
I've forgotten how.

489
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:46,015
What?
But if you could just show me...

490
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:49,268
Oh. Mm.

491
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:57,901
How's that?
That's good.

492
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,914
I better get that.

493
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:12,708
Don't go.

494
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:15,419
Don't come.

495
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,054
Are you Courtney Shane?

496
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:27,306
Maybe.

497
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:30,768
Dad, don't be a dick.

498
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:32,561
What did you say?

499
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:35,731
You gonna launch
into another lecture
on the ugliness of profanity?

500
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,651
I just wish
you could hear yourself.
You sound uneducated.

501
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:41,737
Dad.
And you know what?

502
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,740
It reflects on your parents.
Parent.

503
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:47,242
That's right.
I've gotta be the mom and the dad.

504
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:48,744
Whatever.

505
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:51,246
I was watching Oprah today.

506
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,958
That must be the mom in you.
You know what the topic was?

507
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:59,797
Let me guess. "Club Kids"?
No, it was "Is Your Child a Follower?"

508
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,133
I'm done. Can I go?
And you know what?

509
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:07,054
I was deeply concerned because,
yes, Oprah, my child is a follower.

510
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:10,766
You are so lame.
You don't even have any friends.

511
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:13,143
Whatever happened to
my sweet little Brownie?

512
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,938
Don't.
My Girl Scout?

513
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,649
You remember the Tiffany concert?
Ho-ho-ho.

514
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:21,026
You loved Tiffany.

515
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:24,446
Oh, my God.

516
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:29,660
Thank God!

517
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:45,194
Nice to meet you, Courtney.

518
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:48,155
I'm Detective Cruz.
You can call me Vera.

519
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:50,574
Okay. Vera.

520
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:53,869
So you're Liz's best bud, huh?
Yes.

521
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:57,206
You went to school that day?
Of course.

522
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:59,208
Did you try calling her?
Why?

523
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:02,086
lf your close friend is not at school,
she should be.

524
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:03,462
Depends.

525
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:07,549
Okay. Let me ask you this.
Did you call in sick for Liz?

526
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:09,968
Did I what?
Did you call in sick for Liz?

527
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:11,387
Of course not.

528
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:13,263
Did it shock you?
What?

529
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,057
Her death.
Not personally.

530
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:19,103
What, trying to get used to the idea?
Yeah. I guess you could say that.

531
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:21,897
Do you know who was
with Liz that night?

532
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:24,650
Uh-uh.
Come on, who was the lucky guy?

533
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:25,901
What do you mean?

534
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:28,237
Who was she fucking?!
No one.

535
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:34,159
You ever seen
one of these before?

536
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:36,412
No.
No.

537
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:38,247
Yes.

538
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:42,251
Take a lot of licks
to get one of these down.

539
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,836
Wanna give it a whirl?

540
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,588
No, thank you.

541
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,384
Mm.

542
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:51,677
It's hard.

543
00:41:53,763 --> 00:41:54,763
Like a rock.

544
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,100
T minus ten, nine, eight...

545
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:59,977
Jawbreaker.

546
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:03,772
The name says it all.

547
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:06,650
It'll break your jaw.

548
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,794
Pretty fucked up name for candy,
don't you think?

549
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:34,636
Good morning, Reagan High.

550
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:39,266
It is with deep dismay
and sincere regret

551
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:42,770
that I inform you
that Elizabeth Purr

552
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:46,523
a well-known senior
at Reagan High School

553
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:49,318
was found dead in her home,

554
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:54,406
apparently suffering
from acute asphyxiation.

555
00:42:55,283 --> 00:42:58,827
There will be a memorial service
held for Elizabeth

556
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:03,999
tomorrow at 2:00
at Cloverdale Lawn Rest Home.

557
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:05,542
And students,

558
00:43:05,835 --> 00:43:09,088
Mr. Murk, our guidance counselor,
will be available

559
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:13,092
for those of you
suffering from distress.

560
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:16,095
My thoughts are with you.

561
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:42,413
Just tragic.
A beautiful, charismatic
girl like Elizabeth Purr

562
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:46,834
just struck down
by the hand of fate.
I still can't believe it.

563
00:43:47,335 --> 00:43:49,461
You said her mama
called in sick for her.

564
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:51,422
Yes, sick.

565
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:53,632
She said Elizabeth had the flu.

566
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,884
Her mama said she
didn't make that call.

567
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:58,053
Oh, no.

568
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:03,475
It could have been anybody.
It could've been a sex-crazed maniac.

569
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:07,396
lf I had anything to do with her demise,
I don't know what I'll do.

570
00:44:07,647 --> 00:44:09,565
It'll be all right.

571
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:11,942
A neighbor said she saw

572
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:16,488
a girl with schoolbooks come up
to the house at 3:30 that day.

573
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:18,741
Yes. Miss Shane.

574
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,744
I sent Miss Shane home
with her assignments.

575
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:23,370
Was it Courtney Shane?

576
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,247
Yes. No.

577
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:28,375
Miss Shane was tardy, as usual,

578
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:33,172
and Fern Mayo was in my office,
so I sent Miss Mayo home
with the assignments.

579
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:35,257
She is such a nice girl.

580
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:37,509
Mayo?
Yes.

581
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:39,762
Is that M-A-Y-O?

582
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:41,805
Fern Mayo.

583
00:44:42,098 --> 00:44:46,894
Come to think of it,
Miss Mayo has been
absent for several days.

584
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:50,773
You don't think that
Miss Mayo could have...?

585
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:57,279
No. Miss Mayo is as sweet
as the days are long.

586
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,616
It's a crazy world, Ms. Sherwood.

587
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:04,787
Some of the sweetest candies
are as sour as death inside.

588
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:13,504
- Hey! You're Violette, right?
- Mm-hm.

589
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:15,631
I'm Brenda,
Chad's girlfriend.

590
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:19,802
I don't think we've met.
Oh, God,
I just love your hair!

591
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:22,763
Mm, hi.

592
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:26,225
We heard
you were the last person
to see Liz Purr alive.

593
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:29,228
That is so cool.
Heh, heh.

594
00:45:29,854 --> 00:45:31,647
Well, bye.

595
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:36,652
Oh, look, you have groupies.
I know. Aren't they cute?

596
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,656
Now about boys. You need one.
Only one?

597
00:45:40,865 --> 00:45:43,158
One's enough to start.
We don't want to baffle her.

598
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:44,827
So what turns
you on?

599
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:46,870
Marcie likes a nice,

600
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:50,249
round ass, don't you, Marcie?

601
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:53,210
Good morning, Vera.
Miss Shane.

602
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:58,507
I like cheekbones. You know,
a boy with a little Bowie going on.

603
00:45:58,717 --> 00:45:59,842
What do you like?

604
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:03,721
I've always been partial to--
Darling, spare us the details.

605
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:05,681
Meet your teen dream.

606
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:09,143
Violette, this is Zach Tartak.

607
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,353
That's him?
You don't think he's cute?

608
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:13,480
Most girls go crazy over him.

609
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,483
He's in drama so we can't
guarantee hetero status.

610
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:19,361
But it doesn't matter.
He is beyond fine.

611
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:23,198
l.e., uItra-pretty.
Unapproachable. Always in rehearsal.

612
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:25,617
When he's not rehearsing,
he's with the drama crowd.

613
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:29,038
Can you say "freak"? Ha, ha, ha.
Freak.

614
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:33,208
So the only sure way to meet him
is to star in the school play.

615
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:35,544
No. No, no, no.
Relax.

616
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:37,880
It's high school, not Broadway.

617
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:43,927
Do you
smell something?

618
00:46:44,846 --> 00:46:45,888
Hi, Fern.

619
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:48,432
I don't know a Fern.

620
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:50,267
There is no Fern.

621
00:46:50,518 --> 00:46:53,228
It's Violette.
What?

622
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:56,065
My name's Violette.

623
00:46:56,274 --> 00:46:57,775
Learn it.
Live it.

624
00:46:58,068 --> 00:46:59,401
Love it.
Love it.

625
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:01,945
Ladies.

626
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:18,087
Hey.
Hey.

627
00:47:18,254 --> 00:47:20,547
Sorry I'm late.
It's okay.

628
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,591
This just hasn't been my day,
you know?

629
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:26,345
Yeah, I know. lf you want to be
alone tonight, I understand.

630
00:47:26,596 --> 00:47:30,099
I know that's what I would want.
No, it's okay.

631
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:38,273
Liz was the only one
that meant anything to me.

632
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,319
With Courtney and Marcie,
it was all games.

633
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:44,279
It was total bullshit.

634
00:47:46,157 --> 00:47:49,118
Imagine what it looked like
from the outside.

635
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:51,120
God.

636
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:54,289
It was a total sideshow, Zach.

637
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:59,586
You ever get the feeling that
maybe this is one of those things

638
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:02,965
that shouldn't even be happening?
What do you mean?

639
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:07,177
It just seemed to me
like you were the kind of girl

640
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:09,722
that didn't give the time
of day to anybody.

641
00:48:10,015 --> 00:48:14,393
But when I saw you that day
waiting for the bus,
it was like I knew.

642
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:17,396
You were alone and weren't
with them anymore.

643
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:21,316
I mean, I would've never thought
to approach you.

644
00:48:21,484 --> 00:48:23,152
I've seen you.

645
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:25,821
I've seen you see me.
Heh, heh, heh.

646
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:28,699
I just wouldn't have gone there.
There's no way.

647
00:48:30,243 --> 00:48:31,535
Why not?

648
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:36,206
I mean, I liked you.

649
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:39,168
Yeah?

650
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:41,879
Come on.
I want to show you something.

651
00:48:43,673 --> 00:48:44,715
Come on.

652
00:49:06,237 --> 00:49:08,947
It's so beautiful up here.

653
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,701
This is where I come when
I don't want anyone to find me.

654
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:16,246
Now I can find you.

655
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:26,298
It's really hard to track you down, Fern.
Violette.

656
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:29,218
My name's Violette.
Fern was a childhood name,

657
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:33,055
but now, as a senior,
Violette seems more appropriate.

658
00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:36,058
Can we keep that between us?

659
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,102
Of course.

660
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,400
Now, Ms. Sherwood says you took
Liz's assignments to her home.

661
00:49:45,568 --> 00:49:50,489
Would you tell me about that?
Liz and I never officially met.

662
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:53,909
Well, we kind of met.

663
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:57,621
I had a term paper due.

664
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:01,583
And I was late for class.

665
00:50:05,505 --> 00:50:09,008
It was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

666
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:10,759
So you two
became friends?

667
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:14,096
We had a class together.
Algebra. I sat behind her.

668
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:18,600
She's got this shiny hair, you know?

669
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:20,936
It smells like apples.

670
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,148
I'd sit there,
staring at her from behind.

671
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:28,110
She has this cluster of beauty marks
on the back of her neck.

672
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,029
And I know this sounds weird,

673
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,533
but they were in
the most fascinating patterns.

674
00:50:35,326 --> 00:50:38,746
Like a puzzle waiting
to be solved, a Rubik's cube,

675
00:50:38,955 --> 00:50:41,040
an uncharted constellation.

676
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:46,003
So that's what I'd do. I'd sit there,
stare at the back of her neck,

677
00:50:46,254 --> 00:50:48,297
playing connect-the-dots.

678
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:54,803
I've found salmon swimming upstream
on the back of that neck.

679
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:57,056
Spider webs,

680
00:50:57,557 --> 00:50:58,766
sea monkeys even.

681
00:51:00,268 --> 00:51:02,895
And the bell would ring
and she'd be the first one out.

682
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:05,647
And I'd be stuck there,
sitting with all these

683
00:51:05,815 --> 00:51:09,234
salmon and sea monkeys
dancing in my head. Heh.

684
00:51:11,488 --> 00:51:12,905
Very interesting.

685
00:51:14,032 --> 00:51:16,575
So I guess Liz
was a hero to you, huh?

686
00:51:16,826 --> 00:51:20,662
I mean, wouldn't it bother you
to lose such a close friend?

687
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:25,334
This is high school, Detective Cruz.
What is a friend, anyway?

688
00:51:26,544 --> 00:51:30,214
A friend is someone who tells
the truth no matter what.

689
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:33,717
A true friend never lies.

690
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:39,098
Look. Liz was sweet.
I did her a favor.

691
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,517
Can I go now, please?

692
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:43,602
Sure, Violette.

693
00:51:55,031 --> 00:52:00,035
This is high school, Detective Cruz.
What is a friend, anyway?

694
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:03,205
Liz is the cat's meow. Meow!

695
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:05,916
I killed Liz.
I killed the teen dream.

696
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:09,211
Deal with it.
We're gonna make you one of us.

697
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:10,879
You're Violette.

698
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:12,214
My Violette.

699
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:16,135
A friend is someone who tells
the truth, no matter what.

700
00:52:27,939 --> 00:52:29,356
Detective Cruz?

701
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:33,736
I don't know if I should be
talking about this.

702
00:52:34,487 --> 00:52:37,990
About what?
Liz was a private person, you know?

703
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:41,076
But I want to help.

704
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,454
Well, that's why I'm here.

705
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:47,583
I just don't know how to say this.

706
00:52:49,627 --> 00:52:50,919
Liz had this craving.

707
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:52,963
Craving for what?

708
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:55,883
For men.

709
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:57,926
Strange men.

710
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:01,430
No one knew,
not even Marcie or Julie.

711
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:04,641
It was her thing. I respected that.

712
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:06,977
And what was her thing?

713
00:53:10,106 --> 00:53:12,274
Sex.
Sex?

714
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:15,319
Yeah. With strangers.

715
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:20,282
She wasn't into the boys at school.
It wasn't about boys.

716
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:23,327
She liked the real thing.

717
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:26,705
Real, live, strange men.

718
00:54:01,157 --> 00:54:03,325
She'd have her way with them.

719
00:54:03,993 --> 00:54:06,495
They'd be gone by dawn.
In and out.

720
00:54:08,164 --> 00:54:09,999
Never to be heard from again.

721
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,752
That's the way she liked it.
It wasn't like in high school

722
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:19,008
where you sleep with a guy and
the entire school knows the trim
of your bikini wax the next day.

723
00:54:19,676 --> 00:54:21,677
You know which bars
she frequented?

724
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:24,638
Yeah.

725
00:54:25,515 --> 00:54:27,683
I have a pretty good idea.

726
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:03,510
Hi, Brenda.
That seat's saved.

727
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,637
But I always sit here.

728
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:08,390
You do?

729
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:23,155
I'm sorry. This stall is reserved.
What?

730
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:25,282
Haven't you met Violette?

731
00:55:25,575 --> 00:55:28,077
It's all about Violette.

732
00:55:28,661 --> 00:55:31,080
Have you guys seen the new girl?

733
00:55:31,414 --> 00:55:32,456
Who is she, anyway?

734
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:35,084
- I don't know.
- No one does.

735
00:55:35,418 --> 00:55:37,920
She have a last name?
She's doing the Madonna thing.

736
00:55:38,129 --> 00:55:40,798
I heard she toured with Madonna.
Supposedly she's a model.

737
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:43,258
Totally bicoastal.
Or just plain bi.

738
00:55:43,468 --> 00:55:46,136
Hot. Heh, heh.
I know. Right?

739
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:47,763
Zach?

740
00:55:48,431 --> 00:55:51,809
Hi.
Nice to meet you. I'm Violette.

741
00:55:52,435 --> 00:55:53,602
Yeah, I know.

742
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:56,313
I saw you in Grease,

743
00:55:56,564 --> 00:55:57,648
twice.

744
00:55:58,149 --> 00:55:59,274
You did, huh?

745
00:55:59,442 --> 00:56:02,444
What can I say?
You rocked my world.

746
00:56:02,862 --> 00:56:05,572
I rocked your world?
It beats football.

747
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:09,576
Not that I have a problem with football.
I mean, I am head cheerleader.

748
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:11,120
Head cheerleader

749
00:56:11,287 --> 00:56:14,123
and star of the school play.
Well, that's a first.

750
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:16,583
Is it?
Yeah, it is.

751
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:19,670
Let me tell you something.
Sports and drama,

752
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:22,006
it's like plaids and stripes.

753
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,466
They don't mix.

754
00:56:24,968 --> 00:56:27,720
Well, the rules have been changed,

755
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:29,513
haven't they?

756
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:44,319
Your ass is much
too precious for vinyl.

757
00:56:45,196 --> 00:56:46,822
Thank you.

758
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:09,136
Hi, girls.

759
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:13,515
What's wrong with this picture?

760
00:57:37,707 --> 00:57:40,209
Is this spot mine? Heh, heh, heh.
Yeah.

761
00:57:43,588 --> 00:57:46,548
I really like it here.
Yep.

762
00:57:46,716 --> 00:57:49,176
It's really great to have someone
to disappear with.

763
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:52,054
Yeah.
Someplace to go.

764
00:57:55,725 --> 00:57:57,893
You know a girl named Violette?

765
00:57:59,187 --> 00:58:02,731
Yeah.
Yeah? She just got cast in the play.

766
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:04,400
What?

767
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:08,320
Well, you know, she's new.
I guess.

768
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:11,573
It's weird, though. She told me
she saw me twice in Grease.

769
00:58:11,825 --> 00:58:14,410
She said that I rocked her world.

770
00:58:14,577 --> 00:58:17,079
It doesn't quite
all add up to me though.

771
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:21,917
Do you know a girl named Fern?
Fern Mayo?

772
00:58:22,168 --> 00:58:23,210
Uh-uh.

773
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:25,337
Come on.
The girl, she's a little geeky?

774
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:28,465
She does errands for Ms. Sherwood.
Okay. I think I know.

775
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:32,761
Well, Fern Mayo is Violette.
What do you mean?

776
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:37,016
She's Courtney's creation.

777
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:39,518
Why would Courtney give her
the time of day?

778
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:42,730
You don't want to know.
I do. Please tell me.

779
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:49,236
Liz Purr is part of it.

780
00:58:51,364 --> 00:58:52,948
Jesus, Julie. What is it?

781
00:58:53,658 --> 00:58:55,034
Okay.

782
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:59,455
Do you know how girls
sometimes kidnap their girlfriends
on their birthdays?

783
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:01,749
Well, we do that.
Okay.

784
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,877
Well, Courtney had
a stroke of genius.

785
00:59:11,676 --> 00:59:15,304
It was totally disgusting.
Courtney put her back
in the bed

786
00:59:15,555 --> 00:59:19,308
and tried to make it
like she was raped.
Well, tried to.

787
00:59:19,517 --> 00:59:21,018
That's when Fern showed up.

788
00:59:21,853 --> 00:59:23,145
Fern?

789
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:28,192
Take her place.

790
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,987
So what're you gonna do?

791
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:33,614
I don't know.

792
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:35,908
You gotta do something.
I know.

793
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:39,661
You can't pretend nothing happened--
I know that.

794
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:42,998
You gotta tell somebody.

795
00:59:45,543 --> 00:59:48,504
I'm taking Dane to the prom.
Surprise.

796
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:52,007
Aren't we cocky? Too bad
you don't have the cock part down.

797
00:59:52,175 --> 00:59:54,385
Well, at least
I'm not jocking it. Heh.

798
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:57,388
Dane may be a jock,

799
00:59:58,515 --> 01:00:01,392
but let's face it.
He was born to be prom king.

800
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:03,852
What he does after prom
is his problem.

801
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:07,856
He could get married, coach
Little League. I could give a shit.

802
01:00:09,567 --> 01:00:11,193
He's a yearbook photo,

803
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:14,446
a piece of nostalgia that
won't stand the test of time.

804
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:18,200
So where's the cherry bomb?
Rehearsal.

805
01:00:18,618 --> 01:00:21,829
Ah. Good. Julie can kiss
drama boy goodbye.

806
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:26,417
I think Violette is out of control.
I mean, the car, the parking place.

807
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:30,879
Oh, honey. It's like when
people first get money.
They're called nouveau riche.

808
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:33,215
They drape themselves
in fur and jewels.

809
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:36,468
They're pathetic,
but they don't know any better.

810
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,888
Yeah, but Violette--
Violette is the same.

811
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:44,226
For once in her pathetic life,
people are giving her the time of day.

812
01:00:44,436 --> 01:00:46,729
The little whore is milking it
for all she's worth.

813
01:00:49,232 --> 01:00:50,566
What the hell?

814
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:03,287
- You stupid cow!
- What?

815
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,955
- Courtney!
- Get off.

816
01:01:05,248 --> 01:01:08,000
Who the heck do you think you are?
Angelyne?

817
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:14,256
What the fuck
are you doing?

818
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:17,176
Exactly what you taught me.

819
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:19,595
I taught you
to disrespect us?

820
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:21,096
You taught me to rule.

821
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:25,434
That's right. Rule, bitch!
But don't forget who made you.

822
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:28,395
I'm sorry. Sometimes I'm
at the mercy of the crowd.

823
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:31,940
I can't help it, Courtney.
They love to hate me.

824
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:36,653
Don't fool yourself. Deep down,
they know who you are, Fern.

825
01:01:38,114 --> 01:01:39,948
I'm Violette.

826
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:42,785
You're whatever the fuck
I want you to be.

827
01:01:42,994 --> 01:01:44,536
Courtney.

828
01:01:45,288 --> 01:01:46,955
Pretty little Courtney.

829
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:49,792
Let's stop pretending, shall we?

830
01:01:49,959 --> 01:01:53,045
You once spoke of ammo.
Ammunition, if I'm correct.

831
01:01:53,296 --> 01:01:55,547
I don't know why,
but it really struck me.

832
01:01:55,715 --> 01:01:57,925
In the last few weeks,
it's all come clear.

833
01:01:58,093 --> 01:02:01,512
And on a clear day, baby,
you can see tomorrow.

834
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:03,347
Excuse me?

835
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:06,141
I've got the power.

836
01:02:06,976 --> 01:02:10,312
Her name's sweet Liz, remember?
Your bloated boo-boo?

837
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,358
I'll fucking shred you, you whore!
And I'll tell a secret.

838
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:18,362
Do tell. But don't be surprised
when they laugh in your face.

839
01:02:18,571 --> 01:02:20,489
Cruz has a suspect in custody.

840
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:22,741
It ain't me.

841
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:28,205
I know the truth. I know
what really happened, Courtney.

842
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:36,505
I made you, and I can
break you just as easily.

843
01:02:36,756 --> 01:02:40,884
Good idea.
Kill me like you did Liz.

844
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:43,971
Courtney?

845
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,693
Julie, you're doing
the right thing.

846
01:02:57,986 --> 01:03:00,988
I know, I know.
Everything's gonna be
okay, right?

847
01:03:01,197 --> 01:03:03,032
Right.
Right.

848
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:07,202
But I'm guiIty too.
Courtney will say I was there.

849
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:10,914
I didn't stop them or tell the police.
That's why we need evidence.

850
01:03:11,207 --> 01:03:14,918
That would be great.
But Courtney destroyed everything.
There's nothing.

851
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,588
What about the Polaroid?
Didn't you say there
was a camera?

852
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:20,716
Yes. She took a picture.
Yeah? And who has it?

853
01:03:21,009 --> 01:03:23,052
I don't know.
What do you mean?

854
01:03:23,261 --> 01:03:27,014
I don't know! It was chaos.
We popped the trunk.

855
01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:38,442
She dropped it.
She dropped the camera.

856
01:03:51,581 --> 01:03:54,291
Okay, it was right about here.

857
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,340
It's gone.

858
01:04:03,843 --> 01:04:06,178
Look, Julie,
is there anything else?

859
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:11,350
There's nothing.

860
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:14,311
At this point,
it's my word against hers.

861
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:17,648
Looks like that's gonna
have to be good enough.

862
01:04:28,493 --> 01:04:31,829
I understand you have something
about the Liz Purr murder.

863
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:36,125
I wanted to tell you
that we have a suspect
in custody.

864
01:04:36,835 --> 01:04:40,295
We found the man leaving
Liz's house that morning.
lf his semen matches--

865
01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:41,964
What're you talking about?

866
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:46,176
Julie, Liz wasn't as innocent
as she appeared to be.

867
01:04:46,469 --> 01:04:47,720
Bullshit! It's not true.

868
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:50,639
I know it's difficult
for you to understand--

869
01:04:53,351 --> 01:04:55,019
Excuse me.

870
01:04:57,355 --> 01:04:58,981
This isn't happening.

871
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:01,150
Liz was a virgin.

872
01:05:01,317 --> 01:05:04,111
Someone had sex in that bed
after Liz died.

873
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,531
It was just the four of you, right?
Yeah.

874
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:08,991
Wait a minute.

875
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,869
Unless someone went back.

876
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:14,496
Oh, my God.

877
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:17,041
What?
She said it herself.

878
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,336
They'll believe it because
it's their worst nightmare.

879
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:23,756
Elizabeth Purr, the picture
of teenage perfection

880
01:05:23,923 --> 01:05:26,050
obliterated by perversion.

881
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:27,926
What are you saying?

882
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:30,679
Courtney found some poor guy
to have sex in Liz's bed

883
01:05:30,847 --> 01:05:33,265
to make it look like murder.
What?

884
01:05:33,516 --> 01:05:35,351
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

885
01:05:35,643 --> 01:05:38,729
Where are we going?
We are gonna bring that bitch down.

886
01:05:46,613 --> 01:05:48,322
Violette?

887
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:51,450
Oh, my God.
What the hell is this?

888
01:06:23,191 --> 01:06:25,275
Well, there you are.

889
01:06:25,985 --> 01:06:27,695
You had quite a fall, my dear.

890
01:06:27,862 --> 01:06:31,740
What happened?
You fainted out in the quad.

891
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:35,744
I want you to take it easy, Fern.

892
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:38,455
What did you say?

893
01:06:38,623 --> 01:06:43,252
Your name is Fern Mayo, correct?
No. No, it's not.

894
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:47,214
Well, that's what it says right here.
Get me out of here.

895
01:06:47,716 --> 01:06:48,799
There she is!

896
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:57,599
This is crazy.

897
01:06:57,851 --> 01:07:00,936
Fern Mayo! Fern fucking Mayo!

898
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:03,272
I thought you looked familiar!

899
01:07:03,523 --> 01:07:05,816
Take off your mask, Fern!

900
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:09,153
Shut up!

901
01:07:24,085 --> 01:07:25,461
It's over, bitch.

902
01:07:55,575 --> 01:07:57,659
What the hell is this?

903
01:08:02,665 --> 01:08:04,041
Fern?

904
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:07,044
Oh, my God.
Fern, are you okay?

905
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:10,005
Fern, it's me, Julie.

906
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:12,299
I'm not Fern.

907
01:08:16,846 --> 01:08:19,181
Oh, my God.
It's okay, Fern.

908
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:22,893
Go away. Please just go away.
It's okay.

909
01:08:23,603 --> 01:08:25,604
How can you look at me?

910
01:08:25,855 --> 01:08:27,523
I'm shit.

911
01:08:28,024 --> 01:08:30,901
I'm reprehensible.
No, you're not.

912
01:08:31,194 --> 01:08:32,695
I'm nothing.

913
01:08:32,946 --> 01:08:36,198
Before all this, I was something.
Not much, but something.

914
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:38,117
You were a good person, Fern.

915
01:08:38,618 --> 01:08:40,703
A lot of good that did me.

916
01:08:40,912 --> 01:08:44,206
I'm nothing. I'm shit.
I'm a nobody.

917
01:08:44,457 --> 01:08:46,625
I don't blame you
for what you did.

918
01:08:46,876 --> 01:08:51,714
I know what it's like to be scared.
That day at Liz's house,
we were terrified.

919
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:54,842
It's not like you had a choice.

920
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:58,554
I'm so sorry, Julie. I'm so sorry.

921
01:08:58,722 --> 01:09:01,473
It's okay. I know.

922
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:04,059
What a fucking tearjerker!

923
01:09:04,352 --> 01:09:07,563
Look. It's like
Terms of Endearment,
part three.

924
01:09:07,772 --> 01:09:12,276
Only this time, the boyfriend's gay.
Yeah. And the rest of the cast sucks!

925
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:16,739
Who the fuck are you?
What?

926
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,408
They charged some poor guy
with murder?

927
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:21,285
What have you done, Courtney?

928
01:09:21,578 --> 01:09:23,412
What have you done?

929
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:25,748
Just what I had to do, dear.

930
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:29,418
What?
Destroy another life, Courtney?

931
01:09:29,669 --> 01:09:33,297
Life's a bitch, then you die.
No, honey, you're the bitch.

932
01:09:33,465 --> 01:09:36,592
Oh. So aggressive, Julie.

933
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:38,427
It kind of turns me on.

934
01:09:38,678 --> 01:09:39,970
I'm sure Fern likes it.

935
01:09:41,973 --> 01:09:44,933
Come on, Marce.
This train wreck's getting old.

936
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:48,437
It's over, Courtney.

937
01:09:48,688 --> 01:09:51,106
I am petrified.

938
01:09:52,525 --> 01:09:55,277
See you at prom tonight, Julie.

939
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:01,784
Some poor, nameless son of a bitch
thought he got lucky.

940
01:10:02,035 --> 01:10:05,454
Boy, was he wrong, huh?
How could she do that?

941
01:10:05,705 --> 01:10:09,208
She's so evil.
And she's only in high school.

942
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:15,714
What are we gonna do?
We make her pay for what she did.

943
01:10:15,965 --> 01:10:17,841
We could go to prom.

944
01:10:18,134 --> 01:10:20,302
You're not serious, are you?

945
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:24,306
Gee, great idea. And on the way,
let's pick up some pig's blood.

946
01:10:24,474 --> 01:10:27,226
- That's real cute.
- Can you take me home?

947
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:28,996
It's a shame Julie
couldn't make it tonight.

948
01:11:29,247 --> 01:11:31,498
Isnt her boyfriend
in drama?

949
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:34,918
I bet they couldn't decide
who got to wear the dress.
Ha, ha, ha.

950
01:11:35,211 --> 01:11:36,795
You are evil.

951
01:11:37,047 --> 01:11:40,215
Oh, listen to the queen
of the damned over here.

952
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:08,160
Come in.

953
01:12:11,414 --> 01:12:13,582
Hi, honey.
Hi, Mom.

954
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:17,586
Mrs. Purr came by today
and brought some things over

955
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:20,089
of Liz's that she thought
you might like to have.

956
01:12:20,298 --> 01:12:22,508
Thank you.
Yeah.

957
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:28,597
Good night, babe.
Good night, Mom.

958
01:12:53,623 --> 01:12:58,002
I killed Liz. I killed the teen dream.
Deal with it.

959
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:28,907
To prom queens.

960
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:32,202
To prom queens.
Heh, heh, heh.

961
01:13:58,355 --> 01:14:00,189
Oh, my God!

962
01:14:02,025 --> 01:14:04,401
How original.

963
01:14:04,652 --> 01:14:07,905
Nothing like a little girlfriend
to spice up an evening.

964
01:14:08,073 --> 01:14:10,282
How about some
public affection, girls?

965
01:14:10,867 --> 01:14:14,203
It's like, how low
could you possibly get?
Heh, heh, heh.

966
01:14:14,371 --> 01:14:17,247
Carpet munchers!
Ha, ha, ha.

967
01:14:17,415 --> 01:14:20,793
Do you hear something?
No. Do you hear something?

968
01:14:21,294 --> 01:14:23,045
No, I don't.

969
01:14:32,972 --> 01:14:35,391
Well, if it isn't
the beautiful people.

970
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:38,936
Courtney, I've been
meaning to tell you.
You are to die. To die!

971
01:14:39,104 --> 01:14:40,396
Thank you.

972
01:14:41,106 --> 01:14:43,440
I am so bored tonight.

973
01:14:44,609 --> 01:14:47,403
I think it's time
for a little room service.

974
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:49,238
Marcie.

975
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:54,326
Reality check. There's a certain
announcement that needs to be made.

976
01:14:54,577 --> 01:14:56,578
Give it up for
the prom queen.

977
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:59,999
Oh, my God, Courtney.
I am so sorry.

978
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:05,421
It's okay. We can't all
be up to speed, can we, girls?

979
01:15:34,284 --> 01:15:36,160
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

980
01:15:36,327 --> 01:15:40,039
Ahem. That was wonderful, wasn't it?

981
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:46,128
Welcome to Reagan High's
senior prom!

982
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,136
You always were such
a spirited group.

983
01:15:56,473 --> 01:15:57,514
Eat me!

984
01:15:58,683 --> 01:16:00,893
All right, all right then.

985
01:16:01,311 --> 01:16:05,481
The moment that we have
all been waiting for.

986
01:16:06,316 --> 01:16:08,275
The announcement

987
01:16:08,485 --> 01:16:11,820
of Reagan High's
prom king and queen!

988
01:16:21,915 --> 01:16:26,335
I love this part.
This is my most exciting part.

989
01:16:27,295 --> 01:16:28,837
I'm nervous. Heh, heh.

990
01:16:33,093 --> 01:16:37,179
Our prom king this year is...

991
01:16:38,932 --> 01:16:40,557
Dane Sanders!

992
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:50,359
Yeah! Yeah, baby!

993
01:17:02,872 --> 01:17:06,583
Dane was always
the most spirited of the bunch.

994
01:17:09,212 --> 01:17:10,212
All right.

995
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:15,384
Now the cherry on the cake

996
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:18,345
of a delicious year.

997
01:17:18,763 --> 01:17:23,225
I'm so pleased to announce
that the prom queen

998
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:28,397
to reign over our kingdom
this year is...

999
01:17:41,911 --> 01:17:43,746
You'll be pleased.

1000
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:47,583
Courtney Shane!

1001
01:18:11,816 --> 01:18:14,526
Reagan High's queen!

1002
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:43,430
We love you, Courtney!

1003
01:18:44,224 --> 01:18:48,227
Thank you so much, Ms. Sherwood.
Ha, ha, ha.

1004
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:50,145
Thank you, senior class.

1005
01:18:50,313 --> 01:18:54,191
You don't know how much it means
to me. It's a dream come true.

1006
01:18:58,655 --> 01:19:00,989
Thank you, everyone.
I love you--

1007
01:19:01,157 --> 01:19:04,952
I killed Liz.
I killed the teen dream. Deal with it.

1008
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:11,166
I killed Liz. I killed the teen dream.
Deal with it.

1009
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:13,168
What?

1010
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:15,212
Heh, heh.

1011
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:18,716
I killed Liz. I killed
the teen dream. Deal with it.

1012
01:19:23,346 --> 01:19:24,722
Thank you so--

1013
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,267
Ms. Sherwood, fix it.

1014
01:19:29,019 --> 01:19:33,605
What is going on here? I do not
appreciate a prank at a time like this!

1015
01:19:33,857 --> 01:19:35,524
That's her voice.

1016
01:19:35,692 --> 01:19:37,776
That's her!

1017
01:19:41,531 --> 01:19:42,531
I killed Liz.

1018
01:19:42,699 --> 01:19:47,745
Dane?

1019
01:19:54,669 --> 01:19:56,337
Dane!

1020
01:20:02,385 --> 01:20:05,095
I've been a very,
very naughty boy.

1021
01:20:05,388 --> 01:20:07,014
Have you?

1022
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:09,183
Would you like
to do the honors?

1023
01:20:12,645 --> 01:20:15,564
That bitch!

1024
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:24,156
- It's gotta be true.
- She'll pay for this.

1025
01:20:31,414 --> 01:20:33,540
Eat shit.

1026
01:20:35,377 --> 01:20:37,252
- Skanky slut!
- You should be ashamed.

1027
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:39,046
Get off the stage!

1028
01:20:39,923 --> 01:20:41,924
Off the stage!

1029
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:04,154
Do you hear me? You are dead!

1030
01:21:16,126 --> 01:21:17,668
Motherfucker!

1031
01:21:46,823 --> 01:21:49,908
Julie!
Smile pretty, Courtney.

1032
01:21:51,828 --> 01:21:52,870
Eh.

1033
01:21:59,669 --> 01:22:02,004
This is high school, Detective Cruz.

1034
01:22:02,255 --> 01:22:04,381
What is a friend, anyway?
