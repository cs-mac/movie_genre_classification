1
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:47,047
1957 was a big year.

2
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:49,760
The Russians put that Sputnik
into outer space.

3
00:00:50,012 --> 00:00:52,731
The Dodgers played their last game
at Ebbets Field...

4
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:54,325
... and said goodbye to Brooklyn.

5
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:58,087
That guy, he shot Frank Costello
in the head and missed.

6
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:02,325
The Gallo brothers whacked
Albert Anastasia in that barbershop.

7
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:04,290
It was total chaos.

8
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:07,968
With Anastasia out, Vito Genovese
figures he's the big boss.

9
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:09,327
But Carlo Gambino...

10
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:11,688
... and Joe Bananas had other ideas.

11
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:13,411
So they called a meeting.

12
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:15,285
A big meeting.

13
00:01:24,892 --> 00:01:28,601
It was the first time the whole
Commission would meet face to face.

14
00:01:28,852 --> 00:01:31,605
Bosses and wiseguys were coming
from all over the country...

15
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:33,729
... and all the
New York families too

16
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:36,406
Maybe 50 bosses,
the whole wiseguy world...

17
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:39,371
... all coming to this
little town upstate.

18
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:52,003
My father went with Dom Manetta
and Tommy D. Fat Tommy.

19
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:53,810
He was running the family then.

20
00:01:54,052 --> 00:01:57,681
Some asshole thought it would be
a good idea to have this meeting...

21
00:01:57,932 --> 00:02:01,004
... at Joe Barbara's farm,
up in the country, nice and quiet.

22
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:02,571
Get away from the car.

23
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:08,563
Want to be a fucking rib eye?
Get away from the car!

24
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:13,124
Turns out the cops were
watching Joe Barbara like a hawk...

25
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:17,445
... and some deputy sheriff notices
all the traffic and calls the feds.

26
00:02:29,812 --> 00:02:31,450
The meeting never even
got started.

27
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:33,045
The feds moved in...

28
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:36,406
... and bingo, the bosses,
they moved out.

29
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:59,082
My father and Dominic, they hid out
in the field with some hay or corn.

30
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:00,407
Along comes a farmer.

31
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:03,684
Dominic bullshits him
while my father holds out...

32
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:07,561
... this .44 cannon he used to carry,
and hijacked the tractor.

33
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:11,492
The story is they drove it
to Bensonhurst...

34
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:15,122
... but my father told me they
only got as far as Poughkeepsie.

35
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,207
Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of it...

36
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,522
...capo di tutti capi,
"boss of all bosses"...

37
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:27,890
... and that was the last time the
Commission tried to meet, until now.

38
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:39,651
I don't like it.
What do we gotta meet for?

39
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:42,725
Let everybody else worry about
their own business.

40
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:47,124
The '57 meeting was about how we were
gonna divide this country.

41
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:50,331
This meeting is how we're
gonna survive.

42
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:55,247
You got made guys
informing for the feds.

43
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:56,607
Bosses are going to jail.

44
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,847
People are getting whacked
without permission.

45
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:02,128
And on top of everything else...

46
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:03,851
...you got these Chinese...

47
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:06,527
...and these crazy Russians
to deal with.

48
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:08,410
Everything's changing.

49
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:11,128
We gotta change with the times.

50
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:13,323
We gonna get a fucking Website?

51
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:14,846
When your papa died...

52
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:20,888
...I made him a promise
that I'd always look out for you.

53
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:25,246
I want you to come to
that meeting with me.

54
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:26,687
Capisci?

55
00:04:35,372 --> 00:04:39,445
Listen. His guy, Primo Sindone,
you watch out for him.

56
00:04:39,732 --> 00:04:41,324
He's a scumbag.

57
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:43,170
Keep your eye on him, okay?

58
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:49,529
Let me get a toothpick.
I'll be back.

59
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:19,889
I just kept telling him
that I needed room...

60
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:21,167
...to grow...

61
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:26,563
...and to find myself as a person.

62
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:29,366
You know?
Not just as a woman...

63
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:32,121
...but as an independent entity.

64
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,083
Then I told him I needed to get
in touch with my uniqueness...

65
00:05:36,332 --> 00:05:38,448
...but he could not handle that.

66
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:41,567
He said that I was
driving him away.

67
00:05:41,852 --> 00:05:44,730
He said I was driving him away.

68
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,331
Do you think I was
driving him away, Dr. Sobel?

69
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:53,011
Caroline, things end.

70
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:57,488
It's part of life. It's how we deal
with the ending that's important.

71
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,881
I just cannot believe...

72
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:01,771
...that it's over between
me and Steve, you know?

73
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,128
I mean, maybe there's still hope.

74
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:06,728
He took a restraining
order against you.

75
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:09,247
To be honest,
that's usually not a good sign.

76
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:11,530
But what should I do?

77
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:17,481
The first thing that I think
you should do...

78
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:21,566
...is to stop whining about this
pathetic loser, for Christ sakes!

79
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:23,370
You are a tragedy queen!

80
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:26,206
Steve doesn't like me.
Steve doesn't respect me.

81
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,443
Who gives a shit?
Get a fucking life!

82
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,570
Dr. Sobel?

83
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:39,528
I was reflecting on your situation.

84
00:06:39,772 --> 00:06:41,808
It's interesting what
you were saying.

85
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,451
I want you to think about it.

86
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:45,890
And I'm going to think about it.

87
00:06:46,132 --> 00:06:47,451
We'll both think about it...

88
00:06:49,572 --> 00:06:52,325
...and continue next week
when I get back from vacation.

89
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:57,731
Caroline, what are you feeling?

90
00:06:57,972 --> 00:07:00,440
You're just like Steve.
You just want to...

91
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:02,011
You just want to...

92
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:03,890
...get rid of me
and throw me out.

93
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,645
You know that's not true.

94
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:06,847
Yes, it's true.

95
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:08,445
I'll see you next week...

96
00:07:08,692 --> 00:07:11,081
...whereas Steve never wants
to see you again.

97
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:21,487
Please, Mr. Vitti.

98
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,529
I don't know nothing.
They don't believe me...

99
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:26,411
...because once I said Joe
hit Dukey and he didn't.

100
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:29,325
I didn't know because Little Joe
looked like...

101
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:30,846
Shut the fuck up!

102
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:34,365
You know me, right?

103
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:35,522
You're Mr. Vitti.

104
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:37,649
You know what I'll
do to you if you lie?

105
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:40,851
You'll crack me on the head
with that pipe.

106
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:43,367
It's a rhetorical question,
you idiot.

107
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:46,080
I'll ask you only once:
Who killed Dominic?

108
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,845
- Who killed Dominic?
- I don't know!

109
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,048
- Who killed Dominic?
- I don't know!

110
00:07:50,332 --> 00:07:51,208
I swear to God...

111
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:52,521
Don't fucking lie!

112
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,922
You little motherfucker!
Who killed Dom?

113
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:06,843
He don't know nothing.
Forget it.

114
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,130
That was relatively painless.

115
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:16,282
Shut the fuck up!

116
00:08:17,132 --> 00:08:18,326
That hurt.

117
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:22,011
We're not going anywhere.

118
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,130
We've sat here for 10 minutes.
I hate being late.

119
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,090
I hate walking into
that house late.

120
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:28,162
Dad, relax.

121
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:31,529
You're like this because you're
mad we have to go to Grandpa's.

122
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,251
Please don't analyze me.

123
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:36,723
I can't be analyzed by somebody who,
until recently, believed in Santa.

124
00:08:36,972 --> 00:08:39,611
here is one Dr. Sobel
in this family. Just one.

125
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:43,404
But there's two.
There's you and there's Grandpa.

126
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:46,767
You know what?
Let's talk about something else.

127
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:50,763
You gonna read
Grandpa's new book?

128
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:54,327
Mom says you won't
because you're jealous.

129
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:58,651
Does your mother talk about anything
else, or is it just me, 24 hours a day?

130
00:08:58,892 --> 00:08:59,802
Shit!

131
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:03,284
This is your mother's fault.
She knows where I am every second.

132
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:08,847
Get in!

133
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:11,686
If I point to you,
make believe your neck hurts.

134
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,567
What are you, a moron?

135
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:15,410
I'm sorry.
This was my fault.

136
00:09:15,652 --> 00:09:16,641
Did you see anything?

137
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:18,371
- I was talking to my son.
- Bullshit!

138
00:09:18,612 --> 00:09:19,681
That's all right, sir.

139
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:22,241
It's our fault for
being in front of you.

140
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:23,811
No, really.
Listen to me.

141
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:26,805
I'm responsible.
Here's my insurance information.

142
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:28,041
It's okay.
Forget it.

143
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:30,044
Forget...?
Your rear end's screwed up.

144
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:33,162
No, it was like that before.

145
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:36,683
Let's call the police
and file a report.

146
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:38,890
Fuck the police.

147
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:40,248
Hear me?

148
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,890
Okay.
Fuck them.

149
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:46,085
You're right.
Fuck them.

150
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:49,563
Especially those mounted cops
who leave big piles all over...

151
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:52,042
...and you just step in it
up to your shins.

152
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:53,765
Let me give you my card...

153
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:56,526
...in case you look at it
and change your mind.

154
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:57,842
You a doctor?

155
00:09:58,652 --> 00:09:59,880
I'm a psychiatrist.

156
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,042
A shrink.

157
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:03,050
I talked to a shrink one time.

158
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,567
When I got sent upstate on a...

159
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:07,086
...fishing trip.

160
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:09,524
Jelly!
Let's go! Come on.

161
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:11,447
I gotta go.

162
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:13,525
I'll see you.

163
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:19,607
Pings and knocks.

164
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,763
Cheap gas.
What are you gonna do?

165
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:24,327
- Right.
- Take it easy, Doc!

166
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:39,845
Neurotics only!

167
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:43,880
Oh, you must have been
a beautiful baby

168
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:46,401
'Cause baby, look at you now

169
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:48,051
Thank God for Prozac

170
00:10:48,452 --> 00:10:51,842
Baby, look at you now

171
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:57,606
You're not coming?
This is my wedding!

172
00:10:57,852 --> 00:11:00,685
We understand it's
a special day for you, Benny...

173
00:11:00,932 --> 00:11:03,241
...but we can't just
pick up and leave town...

174
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:05,403
...every time you decide
to get married.

175
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:07,643
Every time?
his is a once in a lifetime...

176
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:10,008
once in a lifetime thing, Mom.

177
00:11:10,412 --> 00:11:12,972
Dad, you're not coming
to my wedding?

178
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:16,124
We want to, but I have
three book signings next weekend.

179
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:18,567
I can't piss off
these big bookstores.

180
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:22,089
If I cancel, they stick me on the
bottom shelves. That's how they are.

181
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:23,481
That's the word on the street.

182
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:25,927
Barnes is okay, but Noble is
a vindictive prick.

183
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:27,651
Ben.
The language.

184
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:29,041
I'm sorry, but listen.

185
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:31,283
I have been alone for eight years.

186
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,804
I finally found somebody that
I want to spend my life with.

187
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:37,247
At least meet her
before we get married.

188
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:39,050
You are gonna be her family.

189
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:41,123
I think she should
know that up front.

190
00:11:41,372 --> 00:11:42,805
You're being very hostile.

191
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:44,681
I was joking.

192
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:46,731
I'm going to see the mayor.

193
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,610
The mayor is here?

194
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:50,846
What's wrong?

195
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:52,571
Nothing.
Everything's fine.

196
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:54,126
How's your practice?

197
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:56,368
Excellent.
I have interesting patients.

198
00:11:56,612 --> 00:11:59,365
Very interesting.
Fascinating, actually.

199
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:02,001
Dad has a patient who
dreams he shits trout.

200
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:04,806
Thanks, Mike.

201
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,489
The Manetta family is bound
to ask questions.

202
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:12,642
They think we put
the hit out on Dominic.

203
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,883
Forget Dominic.
They were after Paul.

204
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:17,447
It's a miracle you survived.
I just thank God.

205
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:19,490
Yeah, thank God, all right.

206
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:22,610
If it wasn't because I had to
go back for that toothpick...

207
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:24,843
...I'd be lying dead with Dominic,
God forbid.

208
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,326
May he rest in peace.

209
00:12:26,572 --> 00:12:27,925
This is about the big meeting.

210
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:30,402
Primo Sindone wants to
run the whole show.

211
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:32,051
Primo knows the rules.

212
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:35,762
He couldn't come after them unless
he had permission from the families.

213
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:39,129
If they did, we're headed for
one big war, I can tell you that.

214
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:42,170
Find out what you can.
We got two weeks.

215
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:45,051
God forbid the other
New York bosses are against us.

216
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:50,411
I want to know that
before I go into that meeting.

217
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:51,482
Sure.

218
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:53,723
You all right?
You don't look too good.

219
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:56,766
What's the matter?

220
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,166
I'm a little choked up.
I'm going to get some air.

221
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,561
- Easy.
- Take some air.

222
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:14,001
You all right?

223
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:16,081
What?

224
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:19,682
I feel like shit.

225
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,526
This whole thing is like
one big fucking headache.

226
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:25,002
You having one of them "migraines"?

227
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:32,564
- Let's go.
- What's the matter?

228
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,131
- Just drive.
- What happened?

229
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:48,690
Good news, Mr. Evans.
Your heart is just fine.

230
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,247
"Just fine"?

231
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:53,450
But I had eight heart attacks
in the last three weeks.

232
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:56,286
Based on everything,
I'd say you had an anxiety attack.

233
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:57,567
A what?

234
00:13:57,812 --> 00:13:59,370
An anxiety attack.
A panic attack.

235
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:00,601
I'll give you Xanax.

236
00:14:00,852 --> 00:14:02,490
Anxiety?
What are you saying?

237
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:04,006
It's a common thing.

238
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:05,765
Hey, look at me.

239
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,242
Do I look like a guy who panics?

240
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:13,085
- Do I look like a guy who panics?
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.

241
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:16,523
Where'd you go to medical school?
I got a fucking heart attack.

242
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,330
Not according to your EKG.

243
00:14:30,372 --> 00:14:33,045
Jelly, I need you to do
something for me as a friend.

244
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:34,088
Yeah, anything.

245
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,290
- Find me a doctor.
- We just come from the doctor.

246
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:39,727
Not that kind of doctor.
Like a head doctor.

247
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:42,122
You gonna change your face,
like Sonny Black?

248
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:44,283
Don't get his nose.
He looks like a pig.

249
00:14:44,532 --> 00:14:47,729
Not a plastic surgeon.
I gotta spell everything out for you?

250
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:49,371
It saves time.

251
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:54,608
I mean, like a head doctor.
Like a psychiatrist.

252
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:59,448
This is like one of them psychic,
ESPN...

253
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:01,962
...ESPN things, you know?

254
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:05,569
I just ran into a psychiatrist.
Actually, he ran into me.

255
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:07,081
Was he any good?

256
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:11,132
He seemed like a smart guy.
He had a business card.

257
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:14,364
A business card?
That's a real fucking achievement.

258
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:20,845
What do you need a shrink for?

259
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:22,889
It's not for me.
It's for my friend.

260
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:25,447
I'm gonna ask the shrink
some questions...

261
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,410
...and get some answers
for my friend.

262
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:31,440
Nobody can know. God forbid somebody
hears I been talking to a shrink.

263
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:33,091
It could be interpreted wrong.

264
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:34,327
Know what I mean?

265
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:36,444
No one will ever know.

266
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:39,126
- Could I just ask one question?
- Go ahead.

267
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:40,761
his friend...

268
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:42,488
...is it me?

269
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:46,047
Yeah, it's you.

270
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:52,248
Carl, I'm detecting a pattern.
You settle too easily for things.

271
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,563
You're right.
I do.

272
00:15:56,052 --> 00:15:57,644
See, you just did it again.

273
00:15:58,012 --> 00:16:00,606
I suggested something,
and you immediately agreed.

274
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:02,925
You're right.
I did.

275
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,400
Why do you do this?

276
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:06,051
I don't know.

277
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:09,365
I think it's your fear
of rejection or disapproval.

278
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:11,762
You don't have to
worry about that.

279
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,764
Be your own man.
Stand your ground.

280
00:16:14,012 --> 00:16:16,480
You don't have to
let people roll over you.

281
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:17,528
Dr. Sobel?

282
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:18,807
We're in session.

283
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:20,963
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

284
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:24,409
You're the guy I hit last night.

285
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:26,483
Bingo.
Get out of here.

286
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:29,207
Upsy-daisy.
Got a coat, nutbar?

287
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:30,441
- What...?
- He's leaving.

288
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:33,365
He's not going till
he's done with his session.

289
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:35,682
- I'll give you $ 100 to leave.
- Don't take it.

290
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:37,126
- Make it 150.
- Listen.

291
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,327
300.

292
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,570
He ain't that fucking crazy.

293
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:42,885
You were right.
I stood my ground.

294
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,202
- His was the wrong time.
- I got him up from 150.

295
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:47,124
- I'm proud.
- I feel like a new man.

296
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:48,487
I'm so happy.

297
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:51,724
I know you're upset about the car,
but you can't come in here.

298
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:53,883
This is a patient's private session.

299
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,088
You know me?

300
00:16:58,332 --> 00:16:59,731
- Yes.
- No, you don't.

301
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,490
You seen my picture
in the paper?

302
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:06,881
- Yes.
- No, you didn't.

303
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:08,804
I don't even get the paper.

304
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:15,765
Jelly, wait outside.

305
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:18,048
Sit down.

306
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:25,445
You ain't got no bugs in here?

307
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:26,442
Bugs?

308
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,523
Bugs.
Recording equipment.

309
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:31,811
No, I don't record.
I take notes.

310
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:36,724
I tried to give him the insurance
information several times.

311
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,041
Several times.

312
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:39,407
He wouldn't take it.

313
00:17:39,652 --> 00:17:40,846
Please don't kill me.

314
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:44,046
I was just gonna ask
if you like Tony Bennett.

315
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:47,083
I'm a big Tony Bennett fan.

316
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:48,848
Me too.

317
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:50,923
I like all Italian singers.

318
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:54,247
Mr. Vitti,
I know it's not your fault...

319
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:57,131
...but shouldn't we take this up
with our insurance companies?

320
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:59,522
That ain't it.
I don't care about the car.

321
00:17:59,772 --> 00:18:01,683
I got a friend of mine...

322
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:05,720
He's got problems, and he'll
have to probably see a shrink.

323
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:07,610
So I'll ask you
a couple of questions.

324
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:09,686
Go ahead, then.

325
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:13,483
What do we do?
What, we sit?

326
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:15,370
Whatever makes you comfortable.

327
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:16,647
I'll sit over here.

328
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:20,131
- I'll sit here.
- That's your...

329
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:22,482
If you're comfortable,
it's fine.

330
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:30,126
So who starts?

331
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:33,648
Tell me why you think
you need therapy.

332
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:37,483
I don't need therapy.
I told you that. It's for my friend.

333
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,404
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't hear me?

334
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,448
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:44,480
You're supposed to be good at listening.
You can't remember what I said?

336
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:45,801
So sorry.

337
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:49,362
I ain't thrilled with the
level of service up to this point.

338
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:51,409
That was my fault.
I apologize.

339
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,888
Why don't we start over?

340
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,887
Why don't you just tell me
about your friend?

341
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:03,288
This friend, you know,
he's a very powerful guy.

342
00:19:03,772 --> 00:19:05,251
Never had trouble
with nothing.

343
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,687
All of a sudden,
he's falling apart...

344
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:10,685
...he cries for no reason,
he can't sleep...

345
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:12,570
...he can't be with his friends.

346
00:19:12,812 --> 00:19:15,087
All of a sudden,
he gets nervous around them.

347
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:16,765
He wants to get away from them.

348
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:19,890
And these are guys he knows
this whole life, you know?

349
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:21,963
And then he has these attacks.

350
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:26,130
He can't breathe,
he gets dizzy...

351
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:28,530
...chest pains, you know...

352
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:31,326
He thinks he's going to
die or something.

353
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:32,641
Panic attacks.

354
00:19:32,892 --> 00:19:34,610
What's with you guys
and panic attacks?

355
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:36,251
Who said "panic"?

356
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:37,561
Who said "panic"?

357
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:38,767
Not panic.

358
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,446
Dizzy, chest-breathing,
constricting...

359
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:43,371
...attacks.

360
00:19:43,612 --> 00:19:47,082
This guy, he just wants to know
what he can do to make it stop.

361
00:19:51,252 --> 00:19:53,402
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

362
00:19:54,452 --> 00:19:56,488
I think your friend...

363
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:58,481
...is you.

364
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:09,649
You got a gift, my friend.

365
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:11,530
You got a gift.

366
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:16,245
You saw that there was something
I was trying to do...

367
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:18,926
...and figured it out.
That's why you are who you are.

368
00:20:19,572 --> 00:20:21,210
God bless you.
You got a fucking gift.

369
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:22,521
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

370
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:25,002
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

371
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:27,641
Go on.

372
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:29,485
- What?
- Go on.

373
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:31,481
I think...

374
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:33,841
...medication could help.

375
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:35,286
Drugs?

376
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:37,170
Can't do drugs.
I don't do drugs.

377
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:40,727
If you want to get to
the root of the problem...

378
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:42,690
...you'll want to get
some form of therapy.

379
00:20:42,932 --> 00:20:44,763
Like what?
With you or something?

380
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:47,971
Me?
No, I don't think you want...

381
00:20:48,972 --> 00:20:50,769
My roster of patients is full.

382
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:54,448
I'm full right now.
Plus, I'm leaving on a short vacation.

383
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:55,568
Where you going?

384
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:58,122
- I don't share that with patients.
- Where?

385
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:00,840
Sheraton Bal Harbour Hotel
in Miami Beach.

386
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:02,491
That wasn't so hard, was it?

387
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:04,131
No, it wasn't.

388
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:09,601
You know, it's a funny
kind of a thing...

389
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,889
...but I feel better after
I got all that off my chest.

390
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:14,611
I feel like a load...

391
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:16,683
A load is off my shoulders.

392
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:18,761
You're good.

393
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,727
Doc, thank you.

394
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:23,405
- I didn't do anything.
- You did.

395
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:24,801
- I did nothing.
- You did too.

396
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:27,247
The load, gone.
Where is it?

397
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:28,720
Don't know.

398
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:31,051
You're good.

399
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,250
You're good, Doc.

400
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:35,449
I'll be getting in touch with you.

401
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:37,887
- Don't, please.
- One more thing.

402
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:42,564
If I talk to you, and you turn me
into a fag, I'll kill you. Understand?

403
00:21:43,932 --> 00:21:46,287
Could we define "fag"?
Because some feelings...

404
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:48,648
- I go fag, you die. Got it?
- Got it.

405
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:49,802
Simple.

406
00:21:50,932 --> 00:21:52,047
You're good, Doc.

407
00:21:52,532 --> 00:21:53,726
You're good.

408
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:57,166
See you, Doc.

409
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:12,924
We take on Manetta,
what does Vitti do? Nothing.

410
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:15,527
- Why doesn't he move?
- Fuck him.

411
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:18,491
You say "fuck him,"
but he's planning something big.

412
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:19,721
The shit's coming down.

413
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,530
Then let it come down.

414
00:22:21,892 --> 00:22:23,530
Let me tell you,
Vitti's a tough guy...

415
00:22:23,772 --> 00:22:27,287
...but a lot of tough guys get fed to
the crabs off Red Hook.

416
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,884
Vitti. That name has been
haunting me since I was a kid.

417
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,851
Growing up, he was the smart guy.
I was the dope.

418
00:22:34,092 --> 00:22:37,004
My father was a nickel-and-dime
shitheel. His had it all.

419
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:39,322
Vito Genovese blew it at Apalachin...

420
00:22:39,572 --> 00:22:42,405
...because he forgot to kill
Gambino before the meeting.

421
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,450
I won't make that same mistake.
I want Paul Vitti dead!

422
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:49,162
You hear me? I want him dead.
Not breathing now. Dead!

423
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:52,402
Like the pants?

424
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,764
They look great.
He's some tailor.

425
00:22:55,012 --> 00:22:56,491
I'll tell you. Look good.

426
00:22:56,732 --> 00:22:57,528
I like them.

427
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:05,481
Don't leave any food in your room.
I won't come home to a science fair.

428
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:07,085
I didn't.

429
00:23:07,572 --> 00:23:09,403
Dad, one thing, though.

430
00:23:10,412 --> 00:23:11,731
- "I go fag, you die."
- That's it!

431
00:23:11,972 --> 00:23:13,485
I'm sealing the vent
in your room.

432
00:23:13,732 --> 00:23:15,324
You cannot listen to my sessions!

433
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:18,006
It's so cool.
Was that really Paul Vitti?

434
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:21,324
I didn't ask to see his
Mafia decoder ring, but yes.

435
00:23:21,572 --> 00:23:24,848
- Are you going to treat him?
- Of course not. Are you crazy?

436
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:28,770
You cannot tell anybody
that he was here. Understand?

437
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:30,650
Should I take it off the Internet?

438
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:31,881
I'm kidding.

439
00:23:39,692 --> 00:23:43,685
Despite the heat and the popularity of
more exotic Caribbean destinations...

440
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:46,890
... Florida 's hospitality industry
reports booming business...

441
00:23:47,132 --> 00:23:48,804
... from Orlando to the Keys.

442
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,326
Judging from the mob...

443
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:51,721
... around the pool here...

444
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,851
... there's nothing "off" about the
off-season in Miami Beach this summer.

445
00:23:56,092 --> 00:24:00,210
On a personal note,
this is my last report for WVBF.

446
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:03,091
I'm marrying a wonderful man
and moving to New York.

447
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:04,930
Thanks for everything, Miami.

448
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:08,847
For the last time, this is
Laura MacNamara for WVBF.

449
00:24:10,612 --> 00:24:11,488
Catch!

450
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:15,291
We're clear!
Nice, Laura.

451
00:24:23,452 --> 00:24:26,250
Everybody! This is him!
This is the guy!

452
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,441
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

453
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:31,728
- Michael, say hi.
- Hi, Laura.

454
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:34,088
Hi, Michael.
How are you?

455
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:36,684
You want to go
look at the camera?

456
00:24:36,932 --> 00:24:39,002
Why would I want to go
look at the camera?

457
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:43,249
- Is it okay?
- Yeah, go ahead.

458
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:46,529
Don't worry if you break anything.
I'm out of here.

459
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:51,049
- You think he likes me?
- He's crazy about you. No, he is.

460
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,248
I love you.
I'm so glad to be with you.

461
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:55,762
Do you really?
And do you really love me?

462
00:24:56,012 --> 00:24:57,889
Of course.
What's the matter?

463
00:24:58,652 --> 00:25:00,404
- I'm nervous.
- Why?

464
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,371
Because I'm going to be
a stepmom to a grown kid...

465
00:25:03,612 --> 00:25:04,840
...and we're getting married.

466
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:06,810
So what are you worried about?

467
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:08,610
What if you get tired of me?

468
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:11,571
A lot of couples are very happy,
and then they marry...

469
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:13,962
...and completely lose interest
in each other.

470
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:15,890
That won't happen to us.

471
00:25:30,692 --> 00:25:32,250
Is everything okay, Paul?

472
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:34,926
Will you stop talking?
I'm trying to do this here.

473
00:25:36,332 --> 00:25:39,290
- You seem distracted.
- I am. I got things on my mind.

474
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:41,568
- Would you stop talking?
- I'm sorry.

475
00:25:41,812 --> 00:25:42,801
Lie down.

476
00:25:46,132 --> 00:25:47,326
Thinking about your wife?

477
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:50,928
I wasn't thinking about my wife.
What are you talking about?

478
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:02,525
Now I am thinking about my wife.

479
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:05,286
Sheila, why can't you
keep your mouth shut?

480
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:06,408
Sorry.

481
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,800
Dr. Sobel.

482
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:20,560
Mom?

483
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,481
It's me.

484
00:26:25,732 --> 00:26:28,292
Mr. Vitti wants to see you.
I got your robe.

485
00:26:30,252 --> 00:26:34,484
I got news for you, you two-bit prick,
son-of-a-bitch rat bastard...

486
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:37,610
...you did nothing for me!
Whatever you did, it didn't take.

487
00:26:37,852 --> 00:26:40,002
I'm still fucked up.
You did nothing for me!

488
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:43,403
I did nothing for you?
I saw you for five minutes.

489
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:44,846
What do you expect?

490
00:26:45,092 --> 00:26:48,243
I can't work miracles.
Let me tell you something else.

491
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:50,722
I don't like it when someone
breaks in...

492
00:26:50,972 --> 00:26:52,883
...and kidnaps me
in the middle of the night!

493
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:54,611
I have a family.
I have a life.

494
00:26:54,852 --> 00:26:56,410
And I have a serious practice.

495
00:26:56,652 --> 00:26:59,086
And I don't have time
for your bullshit!

496
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:01,923
That got away from me
at the end there.

497
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:06,484
I couldn't get it up last night.

498
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:08,767
Do you mean sexually?

499
00:27:08,972 --> 00:27:10,724
No, for the big
Michigan State game.

500
00:27:10,972 --> 00:27:13,167
Of course, sexually!
What's the matter with you?

501
00:27:13,492 --> 00:27:14,686
Can I get this straight?

502
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:18,129
You flew 1,500 miles,
you dragged me out of bed...

503
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:20,368
...because you couldn't get
an erection?

504
00:27:20,612 --> 00:27:22,603
Don't that prove I'm motivated?

505
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:24,564
You can take a pill for that.

506
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:25,642
That's a cheat.

507
00:27:25,892 --> 00:27:28,247
You start with the pills,
next it's hydraulics.

508
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:31,290
A hard-on should be gotten
legitimately or not at all.

509
00:27:31,532 --> 00:27:33,170
I think Mark Twain said that.

510
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,488
Are you gonna help me or not?

511
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,688
I don't believe this.
All right.

512
00:27:40,412 --> 00:27:41,606
Has this happened before?

513
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:43,331
The dead-dick thing?

514
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,846
Never.
Well, one time. Last night.

515
00:27:47,772 --> 00:27:48,727
One more time.

516
00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:49,768
So twice.

517
00:27:50,012 --> 00:27:51,730
Do the math.
Two times.

518
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:55,564
Then another time, but after
a big meal, so that don't count.

519
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:58,610
Being unable to perform
three or four times is not...

520
00:27:58,852 --> 00:27:59,967
Eight times.

521
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:02,124
Eight times is not catastrophic.

522
00:28:02,372 --> 00:28:03,964
Maybe not to you.
Look at you.

523
00:28:04,812 --> 00:28:07,724
But if I can't get it up,
that makes me less of a man.

524
00:28:07,972 --> 00:28:09,769
In my world,
I deal with animals.

525
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:12,651
They may seem dumb to
an educated guy like you...

526
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:15,804
...but animals are very cunning,
and they sense weakness.

527
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:17,760
I got less than two weeks...

528
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:20,446
...to get strong, or they'll kill me.

529
00:28:20,692 --> 00:28:21,647
What happens then?

530
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:23,769
I can't tell you.
You don't want to know.

531
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:27,004
You can't tell me and I don't
want to know. That's a big help.

532
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:29,083
You're supposed to tell me.
I want to know.

533
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,562
That's how this works.
This is impossible.

534
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:34,770
I can't do anything in two weeks,
and even if I could...

535
00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:38,129
...what is my goal? To make you
a happy, well-adjusted gangster?

536
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:41,007
The other day I was watching
a V commercial...

537
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:42,884
...some kid playing with puppies.

538
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:44,850
I cried for 45 minutes.

539
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:46,924
Slap a pair of tits on me, I'm a woman.

540
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:48,161
I can't help you.

541
00:28:48,412 --> 00:28:49,481
You're turning me down?

542
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:53,691
When I got into family therapy,
this wasn't the family I had in mind.

543
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:58,164
You with your schmucky little office
and house, you're turning me down?

544
00:28:58,412 --> 00:29:00,642
So you can listen to
housewives piss and moan...

545
00:29:00,892 --> 00:29:02,883
...about nobody fucks them
right anymore?

546
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,326
I'm leaving now.

547
00:29:04,572 --> 00:29:05,527
You see this?

548
00:29:05,772 --> 00:29:07,364
This is what I'm talking about.

549
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,091
I'm a dead man.

550
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:14,569
You call yourself a doctor.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

551
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:20,130
A real doctor could never turn his back
on a person who's suffering!

552
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:25,369
You couldn't treat a fucking
two-celled amoeba, you fucking phony.

553
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:31,889
Mother of God, give me
the strength to get through this.

554
00:29:32,612 --> 00:29:33,806
This fucking rat bastard...

555
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,371
...won't help me.

556
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:40,687
I cry all the time...
Don't know what it is.

557
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:42,481
All right, here.

558
00:29:44,972 --> 00:29:46,041
Sit down.

559
00:29:49,652 --> 00:29:50,767
Sit down.

560
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:57,082
What happened with
your wife last night?

561
00:29:57,332 --> 00:29:59,687
I wasn't with my wife.
I was with my girlfriend.

562
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:01,490
Are you having marriage problems?

563
00:30:02,172 --> 00:30:03,525
Why do you have a girlfriend?

564
00:30:03,772 --> 00:30:05,205
You're moralizing with me now?

565
00:30:05,452 --> 00:30:07,761
No, I'm curious.
Why do you have a girlfriend?

566
00:30:08,012 --> 00:30:10,128
I do things with her
I can't do with my wife.

567
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:11,646
Why can't you?

568
00:30:11,892 --> 00:30:15,089
That's the mouth she kisses
my kids with. Are you crazy?

569
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:19,044
Have you been under stress lately?

570
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:22,170
- Like seeing your best friend murdered?
- That would qualify.

571
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:24,130
I got a lot of stress.

572
00:30:28,252 --> 00:30:30,891
Based upon what you told me before
about the attacks...

573
00:30:31,132 --> 00:30:32,770
...I'd say that was probably it.

574
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:35,370
- Just stress?
- "Just stress"?

575
00:30:35,612 --> 00:30:37,284
Stress is a very powerful force.

576
00:30:37,532 --> 00:30:40,285
I doubt there's anything
physically wrong with you.

577
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:42,329
- That's it?
- That's it.

578
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:44,321
That's it?

579
00:30:44,572 --> 00:30:45,448
I think so.

580
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:49,326
You're very good, you.

581
00:30:49,572 --> 00:30:50,766
You are very good.

582
00:30:51,012 --> 00:30:53,003
- Here's more to it...
- You're very good.

583
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:55,129
- Here are underlying...
- Understand me?

584
00:30:55,372 --> 00:30:56,691
You're right on the money.

585
00:30:56,932 --> 00:30:59,366
I feel the juices rush back
to my balls as we speak.

586
00:30:59,612 --> 00:31:01,921
I never thought I'd hear
a man say that to me.

587
00:31:02,172 --> 00:31:04,242
That settles it.
You are my shrink.

588
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:05,845
No, I couldn't.

589
00:31:06,092 --> 00:31:07,491
You're not ready to open up.

590
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,404
You're not a good candidate...

591
00:31:09,652 --> 00:31:12,530
Listen to you.
The fucking honesty.

592
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:13,921
That's it.
You don't understand.

593
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,402
Nobody, nobody talks
to me like that.

594
00:31:16,652 --> 00:31:18,005
You understand?

595
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:19,605
- Yes, I do.
- That's it.

596
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:20,841
Let's do it.
I'm ready.

597
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:22,889
You don't hear the word "no"
very often.

598
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:26,249
I hear it all the time,
only it's more, "No, please, no, no. "

599
00:31:26,892 --> 00:31:28,405
I'm here for two more days.

600
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:31,724
When I get back to New York,
I'll treat you exclusively.

601
00:31:31,972 --> 00:31:33,166
For two weeks.

602
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:35,849
I just don't know what
to tell my patients.

603
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:37,650
You want me to clear
your schedule?

604
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:40,611
It would be my honor to do that.
My pleasure.

605
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:43,129
Not Jimmy.
I will do this myself.

606
00:31:43,372 --> 00:31:44,407
- You sure?
- Positive.

607
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,210
I will see you in New York.

608
00:31:46,452 --> 00:31:49,285
Okay.
Want one of them?

609
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,487
- No, thanks.
- Sure?

610
00:31:50,732 --> 00:31:52,609
That's very kind of you, but I...

611
00:31:52,852 --> 00:31:54,843
Want to give a little sandwich?

612
00:31:55,492 --> 00:31:56,686
You sure?

613
00:31:57,652 --> 00:31:58,880
The pause that refreshes.

614
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:00,690
I don't...
No, I really...

615
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:01,928
You're on vacation.

616
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,924
I'm also about to get married...

617
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,481
...so I'd like to go back
to my hotel and...

618
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:07,528
Good night.

619
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:08,921
I'll see you in New York.

620
00:32:09,252 --> 00:32:11,607
You.
Hey, Doc. You.

621
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:13,645
I'm gonna see a lot of you.

622
00:32:16,252 --> 00:32:17,446
Where were you?

623
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:19,523
My God, I woke up
and you were gone!

624
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:22,286
There was no note or anything!
I was out of my mind!

625
00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:24,648
I walked all over the hotel
looking for you.

626
00:32:24,892 --> 00:32:27,725
I even ate a Rice Krispy Treat.
I almost called the police.

627
00:32:27,972 --> 00:32:30,725
No, don't call the police.
I'll tell you the truth.

628
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:32,769
I had a patient emergency.

629
00:32:33,012 --> 00:32:34,923
You have patients in Florida?

630
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:38,721
One. He followed me from New York.
I had to go, trust me.

631
00:32:38,972 --> 00:32:40,803
My God.
Who is this patient?

632
00:32:42,852 --> 00:32:44,126
Paul Vitti.

633
00:32:48,252 --> 00:32:49,685
Mafia Paul Vitti?

634
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:53,803
Oh, my God.

635
00:32:56,492 --> 00:32:58,847
It's not like
he's a regular patient.

636
00:32:59,092 --> 00:33:00,320
He's got problems.

637
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:03,765
He thinks that I'm treating him.
It's crazy.

638
00:33:04,012 --> 00:33:05,365
So you're not treating him?

639
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:06,727
Tell me you're not.

640
00:33:06,972 --> 00:33:08,087
I'm not treating him.

641
00:33:08,332 --> 00:33:11,244
It's scary. You don't want
someone like that in your life.

642
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:14,165
I've covered the mob down here.
I've seen what they do.

643
00:33:14,412 --> 00:33:17,324
He and I spoke about it.
He understood. It's over.

644
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:19,642
- You're sure?
- Absolutely.

645
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:23,370
I was so worried.

646
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:25,523
I thought maybe you
got scared or...

647
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:27,649
...saw an ex-girlfriend
or something.

648
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,564
Well, I don't know.

649
00:33:30,492 --> 00:33:31,845
- I love you.
- I love you.

650
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:35,164
I'm sorry, but everything's
going to be okay.

651
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:40,243
Give her a big hand!
Let's hear it!

652
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:41,811
How about that?

653
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:48,846
That was great!
Come on, get into it.

654
00:33:49,492 --> 00:33:51,448
I don't understand.
They splash in the water.

655
00:33:51,692 --> 00:33:52,681
They eat fish.

656
00:33:52,932 --> 00:33:54,490
This is not a big stretch
for a whale.

657
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:55,642
Stop it.

658
00:33:55,892 --> 00:33:57,564
We're having fun, right?

659
00:33:58,052 --> 00:34:00,850
I'm not having as much fun
as it looks like I am.

660
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:03,731
I'm pretending, because we
have to bond and all.

661
00:34:08,332 --> 00:34:12,371
A little snack for her
might be 50 pounds of mackerel.

662
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,126
There she goes!

663
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:22,371
I'm going to get a hot dog.
Anybody want anything?

664
00:34:22,612 --> 00:34:24,011
- I'll go with you.
- It's fine.

665
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:26,925
You're pretending to have a good time.
I don't want to spoil that.

666
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:28,321
I'll be right back.

667
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:30,563
You think those whales
piss in that water?

668
00:34:30,812 --> 00:34:34,646
I think they use the men's room
next door to the Burger King.

669
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:35,682
Dummy.

670
00:34:35,932 --> 00:34:38,002
- What's going on?
- Mr. Vitti wants to see you.

671
00:34:38,252 --> 00:34:39,241
Is this a joke?

672
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:40,686
You're employed
by Mr Vitti...

673
00:34:40,932 --> 00:34:43,241
...which means you're on call
24 hours a day...

674
00:34:43,492 --> 00:34:44,845
...just like the rest of us.

675
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:46,366
I'm sorry.
He and I discussed...

676
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:49,604
We discussed this, and I agreed
to see him in New York.

677
00:34:49,852 --> 00:34:50,648
That's it.

678
00:34:50,892 --> 00:34:53,645
Doctor, listen to me.
It is what it is.

679
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:57,680
If he wants you sooner, you go sooner.
That's it.

680
00:34:57,932 --> 00:34:59,081
No.
I am not going.

681
00:34:59,332 --> 00:35:01,721
And if either one of you
bother me again...

682
00:35:01,972 --> 00:35:03,325
...I won't treat him at all.

683
00:35:03,572 --> 00:35:05,369
Do you understand that?
Capisci?

684
00:35:05,612 --> 00:35:07,842
It's over!
End of story.

685
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:11,288
Look at the size of this one.

686
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,603
Jesus Christ!

687
00:35:15,372 --> 00:35:16,691
It's feeding time.

688
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:20,888
They threw me in
the shark tank, Paul.

689
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:22,326
They wanted to make a point.

690
00:35:22,572 --> 00:35:24,563
That you're scary?
Believe me, I get it.

691
00:35:24,812 --> 00:35:25,608
You're in a mood.

692
00:35:25,852 --> 00:35:28,320
I get that way when
a shark tries to chew on my ass.

693
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:31,086
- We had an agreement.
- We did, but I had an episode.

694
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:34,165
I didn't have a panic attack,
but I started panicking...

695
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:36,323
...thinking I might get one.
Is that weird?

696
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:39,086
I am redefining "weird"
on an hourly basis.

697
00:35:39,332 --> 00:35:41,004
-What's he doing?
- I don't know.

698
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:43,561
- He's talking with some guy.
-Can you hit him?

699
00:35:43,812 --> 00:35:46,724
He's got fat Jelly and his
partner Jimmy Boots with him.

700
00:35:46,972 --> 00:35:49,805
I could do it with a rifle,
but I don't have that with me.

701
00:35:50,052 --> 00:35:51,041
Just get him.

702
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:53,248
You told me to take care of him,
I will.

703
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:55,448
What were you thinking
when you got anxious?

704
00:35:55,692 --> 00:35:57,887
Let's get out of here.
We're being watched.

705
00:35:58,132 --> 00:36:00,726
Don't look.
There's feds up there watching us.

706
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:02,564
How do you know that?

707
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:04,410
I'm a criminal.
It's my job.

708
00:36:05,572 --> 00:36:06,641
Who's the new face?

709
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,647
Maybe he's Vitti's new consigliore.

710
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:13,770
Whoever this guy is,
he must be important to the family.

711
00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:16,606
Put his picture on the wire.
See what you come up with.

712
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:24,771
Normally, a patient wouldn't have
a vat of scotch during a session.

713
00:36:26,692 --> 00:36:30,207
That's interesting. I'll have to
remember it if I'm ever on Jeopardy.

714
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:31,680
Tell me about your father.

715
00:36:31,932 --> 00:36:34,400
My father.
Well, my father...

716
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,051
Let's sit here.

717
00:36:36,852 --> 00:36:38,001
My father.

718
00:36:39,372 --> 00:36:41,602
A big man in the neighborhood.
Everybody loved him.

719
00:36:41,852 --> 00:36:43,683
Very well-respected,
God rest his soul.

720
00:36:43,932 --> 00:36:45,285
He passed away?

721
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:48,365
I just like saying "God rest his soul."
Of course he passed away!

722
00:36:48,612 --> 00:36:50,204
I was about 12 at the time.

723
00:36:50,452 --> 00:36:51,646
How did he die?

724
00:36:52,132 --> 00:36:54,202
It was a sudden thing.
A heart attack.

725
00:36:54,452 --> 00:36:56,682
How was the relationship?
Were you close?

726
00:36:56,932 --> 00:36:58,126
We were pretty close.

727
00:36:58,372 --> 00:37:00,442
We weren't getting along great
right then.

728
00:37:00,692 --> 00:37:01,807
Why is that?

729
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:04,811
I was hanging out in the neighborhood.
I had a borgata.

730
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:06,122
What is that?

731
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:08,727
A kid gang, nothing big.
But he didn't like that.

732
00:37:08,972 --> 00:37:09,927
He didn't approve.

733
00:37:10,172 --> 00:37:12,561
He slapped me around
a couple of times.

734
00:37:12,852 --> 00:37:13,921
And what?

735
00:37:14,172 --> 00:37:15,400
And then he died.

736
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:17,690
How'd that make you feel?

737
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:20,287
It felt great, wonderful.
How'd it make me feel?

738
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:21,487
Think about it.

739
00:37:21,732 --> 00:37:24,724
Were you angry?
Were you afraid? Sad?

740
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:26,803
Maybe all those things.

741
00:37:27,052 --> 00:37:28,246
Any feelings of guilt?

742
00:37:28,692 --> 00:37:30,091
About what?
I didn't kill him.

743
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,890
I know that.
I'm just speculating...

744
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,841
...that maybe in some way
you may have wanted him to die.

745
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:37,491
Why would I want him to die?

746
00:37:37,732 --> 00:37:40,485
You said you were fighting.
He slapped you around...

747
00:37:40,732 --> 00:37:42,802
...because you rebelled
against his authority.

748
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,724
Maybe some unresolved
Oedipal conflict.

749
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,564
English, English.

750
00:37:46,812 --> 00:37:50,407
Oedipus was a Greek king who killed
his father and married his mother.

751
00:37:50,652 --> 00:37:51,641
Fucking Greeks.

752
00:37:51,892 --> 00:37:54,087
It's an instinctual
developmental drive.

753
00:37:54,332 --> 00:37:56,243
The young boy wants to
replace his father...

754
00:37:56,492 --> 00:37:58,847
...so that he can
totally possess his mother.

755
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:01,162
Are you saying
I wanted to fuck my mother?

756
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,367
It's a primal fantasy.

757
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:04,364
Have you ever seen my mother?

758
00:38:04,612 --> 00:38:06,568
- Are you out of your mind?
- It's Freud!

759
00:38:06,812 --> 00:38:09,610
Freud's a sick fuck, and you are
too for bringing it up.

760
00:38:13,172 --> 00:38:16,369
Can I be honest?
I don’t think I can call you Dad.

761
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:19,126
So what do I call you?
Do I call you Scott?

762
00:38:19,372 --> 00:38:21,010
My friends call me Captain.

763
00:38:21,852 --> 00:38:23,080
Captain?

764
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:27,086
Want another drink?
I'm definitely having eight or nine.

765
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:28,560
I'd like a morphine and soda.

766
00:38:29,492 --> 00:38:30,925
I'm shaking.

767
00:38:31,452 --> 00:38:34,808
Shall we go to our table?
Come on, Michael.

768
00:38:36,572 --> 00:38:37,800
Señor Sobel.

769
00:38:41,092 --> 00:38:42,286
How you doing?

770
00:38:43,812 --> 00:38:44,767
It's the Vittis.

771
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:46,481
My God.

772
00:38:48,732 --> 00:38:51,565
Everybody's happy.
Everybody's smiling. His is nice.

773
00:38:51,972 --> 00:38:53,564
You're Paul Vitti,
the mobster.

774
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,725
Now, is that polite?

775
00:38:57,532 --> 00:38:59,682
Is that being nice?
I'm trying to be nice.

776
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:02,810
Do I walk up to you and say
you're so-and-so, the hard-on?

777
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:05,768
This is Laura's father,
the Captain.

778
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:07,684
I'm very, very sorry.

779
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:09,001
Excuse us.

780
00:39:11,412 --> 00:39:13,323
I heard about the wedding.
Here you go.

781
00:39:13,572 --> 00:39:16,689
A little something for the
bride and groom. God bless.

782
00:39:17,052 --> 00:39:18,087
We can't accept this.

783
00:39:18,332 --> 00:39:19,765
- Yes, you can.
- Hank you.

784
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:23,368
I'm just gonna borrow this guy.
I'll bring him right back.

785
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,204
And then you'll leave us alone.

786
00:39:25,452 --> 00:39:26,805
I'll leave you alone.

787
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:28,246
I got to talk to you.

788
00:39:29,972 --> 00:39:31,564
Two minutes.
Two minutes.

789
00:39:31,812 --> 00:39:34,280
Wait over there.
Don't listen to what we say.

790
00:39:34,532 --> 00:39:35,851
My ears are sealed.

791
00:39:36,092 --> 00:39:37,844
I had a weird dream
last night.

792
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:40,925
I feel like I'm having one now.
Why'd you interrupt my party?

793
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:43,561
You're really very rigid
about certain things.

794
00:39:43,812 --> 00:39:45,040
Did you know that?

795
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:47,487
All right,
tell me about your dream.

796
00:39:47,732 --> 00:39:49,245
I'm asleep.

797
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:51,926
I hear a baby crying.
I go to the refrigerator.

798
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:53,605
I get him a bottle of milk.

799
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,524
I bring the bottle of milk to him...

800
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:57,000
...I see the milk is black.

801
00:39:57,252 --> 00:39:58,731
That's fucking weird!

802
00:39:58,972 --> 00:39:59,768
Get out of here.

803
00:40:00,012 --> 00:40:01,650
- Get out of here.
- Sorry.

804
00:40:02,612 --> 00:40:05,524
What does that mean?
And no more filth about my mother.

805
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:07,603
I don't know.
What does it mean to you?

806
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:11,490
This is why I pay you? I say
something, you say it back to me?

807
00:40:11,732 --> 00:40:13,802
I could get Jelly to
do that for nothing.

808
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:16,520
Get Jelly.
I'm going back to my party.

809
00:40:18,412 --> 00:40:20,403
All right.
I'm letting it go this time.

810
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:23,610
Because you're getting married,
I'm gonna let it go.

811
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:31,040
Why don't you look over that way
before I bust your head open?

812
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:47,523
I'm gonna grab a bite to eat.
You want a sandwich?

813
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,048
What kind of sandwich
ain't too fattening?

814
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:51,771
A half a sandwich.

815
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:54,123
I'll be back in a few minutes.

816
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:26,292
Now, nod your head and smile.
Do it.

817
00:41:27,132 --> 00:41:28,724
Now, you listen to me, goombah.

818
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:31,725
I know what your game is,
and you'd better call it quits.

819
00:41:32,052 --> 00:41:35,522
If you and your paisans
do anything to hurt my little girl...

820
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:37,251
...I don't care who
you are...

821
00:41:37,492 --> 00:41:40,643
...I'll hunt you down like
the dog you are, and I'll kill you.

822
00:41:40,972 --> 00:41:42,166
Understand?

823
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:44,250
Now, nod and smile.

824
00:41:44,732 --> 00:41:45,926
Congratulations.

825
00:41:49,452 --> 00:41:50,521
What was that about?

826
00:41:50,772 --> 00:41:53,650
Just guy stuff between
me and the Captain.

827
00:42:56,732 --> 00:42:57,721
Shit!

828
00:43:00,852 --> 00:43:03,320
In sickness and in health,
from this day forth...

829
00:43:03,572 --> 00:43:05,608
...as long as you both shall live?

830
00:43:14,372 --> 00:43:16,806
Bring Marie and
the kids right to the airport.

831
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,647
Pull the car in the
back of the hotel and wait for us.

832
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:21,768
You got it, boss.

833
00:43:22,012 --> 00:43:24,526
That's it. That is it!
I've had it with you.

834
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:25,727
- What happened?
- What happened?

835
00:43:25,972 --> 00:43:29,647
I just saw a man fall seven stories
into a platter of poached salmon!

836
00:43:29,892 --> 00:43:31,610
- Did he break anything?
- Everything!

837
00:43:31,852 --> 00:43:33,444
They’re still pulling capers
out of him.

838
00:43:33,692 --> 00:43:37,321
People get depressed, they jump.
It's a tragedy, but it ain't my fault.

839
00:43:37,572 --> 00:43:39,085
You're telling me
it was a suicide?

840
00:43:39,332 --> 00:43:41,687
I think he left a note.
Jelly, did they find it?

841
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:43,763
No, but they will in a minute.

842
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:46,003
Let me guess what it says.
"Life is bullshit.

843
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,408
I can't take it no more.
Signed, The Dead Guy. "

844
00:43:48,652 --> 00:43:50,529
That's good, Doc.

845
00:43:50,772 --> 00:43:52,808
Enough talk.
We gotta get out of here.

846
00:43:53,052 --> 00:43:54,565
There's feds all over.

847
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:56,564
I'm going back to New York...

848
00:43:56,812 --> 00:43:59,485
...and I would suggest that
you do the same thing.

849
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:01,404
Because they're probably
onto you too.

850
00:44:01,652 --> 00:44:03,529
Onto me?
What are you talking about?

851
00:44:03,772 --> 00:44:07,048
Being an accessory to a murder
wasn't part of our understanding.

852
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:08,805
I didn't kill nobody.

853
00:44:09,052 --> 00:44:10,804
I can't speak for
other people here.

854
00:44:11,052 --> 00:44:12,007
He tried to kill me.

855
00:44:12,252 --> 00:44:14,812
God forbid he did that
to somebody in my family.

856
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:17,247
It would've been
a double or a triple tragedy.

857
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:19,687
Trust me, in this case,
we're the good guys.

858
00:44:19,932 --> 00:44:21,001
Where is he?

859
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,287
- Where are you going?
- Don't touch me.

860
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:26,725
How could you do that?

861
00:44:26,972 --> 00:44:28,690
Another country heard from.

862
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:30,207
Wait downstairs.

863
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:33,524
Why? Are they going to throw me
off the balcony too?

864
00:44:34,052 --> 00:44:36,441
You're upset, and
you're upsetting me.

865
00:44:36,692 --> 00:44:37,681
Of course I'm upset!

866
00:44:37,932 --> 00:44:41,083
My wedding is ruined
because you've got problems!

867
00:44:41,332 --> 00:44:42,321
I got problems?

868
00:44:43,052 --> 00:44:43,848
Honey, please.

869
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:47,531
I'm going to pack,
and then I'm going to New York.

870
00:44:47,772 --> 00:44:50,570
And I am getting married with you
or without you!

871
00:44:51,252 --> 00:44:53,208
With! With!
I'm sorry, honey.

872
00:44:53,452 --> 00:44:55,170
It'll all work out.
I promise.

873
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:56,686
Please?

874
00:44:57,532 --> 00:44:59,090
No, I hate you!

875
00:45:00,652 --> 00:45:02,563
Are you happy?
Are you happy?

876
00:45:02,812 --> 00:45:05,007
You know what you did?
You ruined my life!

877
00:45:05,252 --> 00:45:07,049
Happy?
What are you talking about?

878
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:09,408
You think I wanted this?
I'm a victim here.

879
00:45:09,652 --> 00:45:10,926
I can't believe this guy.

880
00:45:11,172 --> 00:45:13,322
He tries to kill me,
then whacks one of my guys.

881
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:16,882
On top of that, he fucks up your
wedding. You know how upset I am?

882
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,726
I'm so enraged, I don't know
what to do with myself!

883
00:45:19,972 --> 00:45:22,327
Plus, I'm trying to
get out of this hotel and...

884
00:45:22,572 --> 00:45:24,130
Are you listening to yourself?

885
00:45:24,372 --> 00:45:25,487
Listen to yourself!

886
00:45:25,732 --> 00:45:29,691
This has been a disaster from the
moment you stepped foot in my office.

887
00:45:29,932 --> 00:45:32,446
That is it. Over!
I'm no longer your doctor.

888
00:45:32,692 --> 00:45:33,807
Just because of this?

889
00:45:34,052 --> 00:45:37,203
Because of this little double homicide?
Yes, because of this!

890
00:45:37,452 --> 00:45:40,762
You don't have a shred
of human decency. Not a shred.

891
00:45:41,012 --> 00:45:42,843
I actually thought
I could help you.

892
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:45,447
There's no helping you.
You're a common thug!

893
00:45:45,692 --> 00:45:47,250
Nobody in the world
could help you!

894
00:45:47,492 --> 00:45:49,005
All right!
What do you want me to do?

895
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:55,411
Let me speak to Primo.

896
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:56,482
Hold on.

897
00:45:58,852 --> 00:46:00,444
Paul Vitti's on the phone.

898
00:46:10,492 --> 00:46:11,686
-Who is this?
- It's me.

899
00:46:11,932 --> 00:46:13,923
-Me who?
- Me who... Me, me.

900
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:16,766
-Me? Me who?
- Me, me. You know me. Me.

901
00:46:17,412 --> 00:46:18,606
Yeah, how's it going?

902
00:46:18,852 --> 00:46:19,921
Not good.
Not good.

903
00:46:20,172 --> 00:46:23,005
Whoever did that thing to
you-know-who, my good friend...

904
00:46:23,252 --> 00:46:24,571
...is trying to do that to me.

905
00:46:24,812 --> 00:46:27,121
And I'm having a lot
of feelings about that.

906
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:29,721
And I'm trying to get some...

907
00:46:29,972 --> 00:46:32,008
- Closure.
- Closure on that.

908
00:46:33,652 --> 00:46:35,449
What kind of feelings?

909
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:38,490
I'm very angry.
I'm feeling very angry about that.

910
00:46:40,052 --> 00:46:41,167
I'm enraged.

911
00:46:41,412 --> 00:46:43,528
I'm feeling very,
very mad about that.

912
00:46:43,772 --> 00:46:44,921
Why are you telling me?

913
00:46:45,172 --> 00:46:46,491
Why am I telling you?

914
00:46:46,732 --> 00:46:48,723
Like you don't know
nothing about it?

915
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,291
You don't know nothing?
What?

916
00:46:50,692 --> 00:46:52,444
I don't know what
you're talking about.

917
00:46:52,692 --> 00:46:54,205
- I'm trying to...
- Tell you how I feel.

918
00:46:54,452 --> 00:46:56,841
Tell you about my feelings
and that...

919
00:46:57,172 --> 00:46:58,491
- I'm angry.
- I'm angry.

920
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,006
And anger is a...

921
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:01,890
- A blocked wish.
- A blocked wish.

922
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:05,249
And I'm looking forward to seeing
you next week at that thing.

923
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:07,926
Then I can unblock
that angered wish...

924
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:09,048
...and then hopefully...

925
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:11,647
You make one more move on me,
you motherfucker...

926
00:47:11,892 --> 00:47:13,723
...I'll fucking cut
your fucking balls off!

927
00:47:13,972 --> 00:47:17,169
I'll shove them up your fucking ass!
I'll fucking bury you!

928
00:47:17,412 --> 00:47:20,290
I'll put ice picks in your eyes!
I'll chop your eyeballs!

929
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:23,126
I'll send them to your family
to eat for dessert!

930
00:47:23,372 --> 00:47:24,646
You understand me?

931
00:47:25,452 --> 00:47:26,680
- What?
-Fuck you.

932
00:47:26,932 --> 00:47:28,650
You motherfucker!

933
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:34,204
You get a dictionary and find out
what this "closure" is.

934
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:38,411
If that's what he's going to hit us
with, I want to know what it is.

935
00:47:38,652 --> 00:47:39,926
How was that?

936
00:47:40,572 --> 00:47:42,130
It was going great until...

937
00:47:42,372 --> 00:47:44,966
...the cutting off of the balls
and shoving it up...

938
00:47:45,212 --> 00:47:46,406
...his ass.

939
00:47:46,772 --> 00:47:49,684
You know what I do when I'm mad?
I hit a pillow.

940
00:47:49,932 --> 00:47:51,570
Just hit the pillow.
See how you feel.

941
00:47:56,412 --> 00:47:58,130
There's your fucking pillow.

942
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:00,367
Feel better?

943
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:03,241
Yeah, I do.

944
00:48:03,492 --> 00:48:04,686
Good.

945
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,485
Call the Vatican.
See if something is missing.

946
00:48:21,812 --> 00:48:23,086
So cool!

947
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:27,606
I need to talk to your dad
in private, okay?

948
00:48:27,852 --> 00:48:29,524
Would you unload the car, please?

949
00:48:29,772 --> 00:48:32,445
It's almost as tall as the house.

950
00:48:35,572 --> 00:48:37,130
What is going on?

951
00:48:37,572 --> 00:48:38,891
What is this?

952
00:48:39,732 --> 00:48:41,051
Why?

953
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:44,171
It's a wedding gift.
He felt bad for the...

954
00:48:44,412 --> 00:48:48,246
Well, we're not married,
so we can just send it back.

955
00:48:50,732 --> 00:48:52,723
It was not my fault.
Everybody was there.

956
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,566
You didn't want to
go ahead with the ceremony.

957
00:48:55,812 --> 00:48:59,600
What did you expect? That's not what
I want for an anniversary memory.

958
00:48:59,852 --> 00:49:03,049
Look at our wedding video.
There are your parents, and mine.

959
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:05,442
There's the guy that
plunged to his death.

960
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,728
I just want to marry you.

961
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,090
I'm thinking it'll never happen.

962
00:49:10,332 --> 00:49:13,005
It's happening next Saturday
at the Waldorf.

963
00:49:13,252 --> 00:49:14,401
And who'll be there?

964
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:15,846
We three, the clergyman...

965
00:49:16,092 --> 00:49:19,448
...and any of your family who
are done with their crisis counselling.

966
00:49:19,692 --> 00:49:22,081
No guests without necks.
Everybody has to have a neck.

967
00:49:22,332 --> 00:49:24,402
We will do a neck check
at the door.

968
00:49:26,892 --> 00:49:29,247
Any furniture you want
to change in the house...

969
00:49:30,452 --> 00:49:31,680
Dr. Sobel.

970
00:49:31,932 --> 00:49:32,728
Ma'am.

971
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:35,566
I'm Agent Steadman.
Agent Ricci, Agent Provano...

972
00:49:35,812 --> 00:49:37,609
...Federal Bureau
of Investigation, OCD.

973
00:49:37,852 --> 00:49:39,649
Obsessive-compulsive disorder?

974
00:49:40,012 --> 00:49:42,651
Organized Crime Division.
We need to talk.

975
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:45,087
FBI? His is cooler
than the fountain!

976
00:49:45,332 --> 00:49:46,367
Go to your room.

977
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:48,330
- But I just...
- Go to your room.

978
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,041
Fine. I can hear
better in there anyway.

979
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:53,326
Please.

980
00:49:57,332 --> 00:49:59,527
Can you explain these photographs?

981
00:50:06,532 --> 00:50:10,366
Yes. I'm a psychotherapist.
Paul Vitti is my patient.

982
00:50:10,612 --> 00:50:13,172
- Was your patient.
- Was my patient, yeah.

983
00:50:13,372 --> 00:50:15,488
- Not even like a patient.
- Right. Exactly.

984
00:50:15,692 --> 00:50:17,683
So why did he send you
that fountain?

985
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,365
The fountain?

986
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:23,081
That was a...

987
00:50:23,852 --> 00:50:27,083
That was a gift to
celebrate the completion...

988
00:50:27,332 --> 00:50:28,560
...of the therapy.

989
00:50:28,812 --> 00:50:30,882
I got a television
from a kleptomaniac...

990
00:50:31,132 --> 00:50:33,362
...so it's not really
that big of a deal.

991
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:35,762
Let me cut to the chase,
Dr. Sobel.

992
00:50:36,852 --> 00:50:40,401
Next week the heads of every major
crime family in the U.S.

993
00:50:40,652 --> 00:50:42,643
...will meet somewhere
in the New York area.

994
00:50:42,892 --> 00:50:45,565
We think the stage is set
for a major bloodbath.

995
00:50:45,812 --> 00:50:47,040
Has he mentioned it to you?

996
00:50:47,292 --> 00:50:48,566
A bloodbath?

997
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:52,603
He has not mentioned
anything like that.

998
00:50:52,852 --> 00:50:54,843
I would've remembered that.

999
00:50:55,092 --> 00:50:57,925
"Bloodbath" is something that
sticks out in a conversation.

1000
00:50:58,172 --> 00:51:01,960
You could really help us by supplying
information about that meeting.

1001
00:51:03,052 --> 00:51:04,724
If I don't?

1002
00:51:04,972 --> 00:51:05,927
If you don't...

1003
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,525
...I will personally make
your life a living hell.

1004
00:51:13,252 --> 00:51:16,289
Pauly, I don’t mean this
in a disrespectful way.

1005
00:51:17,052 --> 00:51:19,691
You know I was
a good friend to your father.

1006
00:51:19,932 --> 00:51:22,082
I'll always be
a good friend to you.

1007
00:51:23,052 --> 00:51:26,328
But the word is out that
you're talking to a shrink.

1008
00:51:26,572 --> 00:51:27,402
Is that right?

1009
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:28,607
What's the point here?

1010
00:51:28,892 --> 00:51:31,884
The point is this concerns
the whole family.

1011
00:51:32,612 --> 00:51:35,490
Right now, we're the only ones
that know about it.

1012
00:51:35,732 --> 00:51:38,451
If this ever gets out in the street,
we're dead.

1013
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:40,489
Who knows what
you're saying to him?

1014
00:51:40,732 --> 00:51:43,087
It ain't nobody's
fucking business.

1015
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:44,481
I beg to differ.

1016
00:51:44,732 --> 00:51:48,407
If you're looking to establish an
insanity plea for later on...

1017
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:49,880
...that's okay.

1018
00:51:50,292 --> 00:51:53,409
But everybody'll think you're
falling apart. It's not right.

1019
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,927
They'll think this is
a sign of weakness.

1020
00:51:56,172 --> 00:51:58,925
Sindone will take over everything.
Is that what you want?

1021
00:51:59,172 --> 00:52:00,730
What do you want me to do?

1022
00:52:01,372 --> 00:52:02,725
It's time to end it, Paul.

1023
00:52:02,972 --> 00:52:04,246
What do you mean, end it?

1024
00:52:04,492 --> 00:52:06,687
Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much.

1025
00:52:06,932 --> 00:52:09,127
You want me to whack my doctor?
Are you crazy?

1026
00:52:10,092 --> 00:52:13,004
Paul, if you don't do it,
somebody else will.

1027
00:52:13,252 --> 00:52:14,731
That's the way it is.

1028
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:16,691
Nobody touches this guy.

1029
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:20,129
Anybody lays a finger on him,
I'll kill him. Understood?

1030
00:52:24,332 --> 00:52:27,642
- I'm gonna get some fruit.
- I'll wait in the car.

1031
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:36,044
Can I get some of these?

1032
00:53:09,332 --> 00:53:10,401
Papa!

1033
00:53:13,772 --> 00:53:15,569
Papa! Papa!

1034
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:32,125
I'm sorry.

1035
00:53:32,492 --> 00:53:33,402
Sorry.

1036
00:53:42,372 --> 00:53:43,851
You look lousy.
You all right?

1037
00:53:44,092 --> 00:53:48,051
Yeah, I'm all right. Listen, Paul,
don't send me any more gifts.

1038
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:52,444
- You didn't like the fountain?
- It's a boundary issue.

1039
00:53:52,692 --> 00:53:55,411
If more people gave from the heart,
we'd all be better off.

1040
00:53:55,652 --> 00:53:58,849
Let me see your watch.
Piece of junk. You're getting a Rolex.

1041
00:53:59,092 --> 00:54:01,606
- Don't buy me one.
- Who said anything about buying?

1042
00:54:01,852 --> 00:54:04,047
Paul, listen.
I really have to talk to you.

1043
00:54:13,532 --> 00:54:14,487
Who is that?

1044
00:54:15,772 --> 00:54:19,731
Tommy Angels. We grew up together.
Worked for a crew out of Jersey City.

1045
00:54:20,332 --> 00:54:21,481
How did he die?

1046
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:26,685
He was on his way to talk
to a federal prosecutor.

1047
00:54:26,932 --> 00:54:28,684
Got hit by a truck.

1048
00:54:29,292 --> 00:54:30,520
Twice.

1049
00:54:31,252 --> 00:54:32,367
I don't need to know this.

1050
00:54:32,612 --> 00:54:33,761
I can't hear this.

1051
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:37,691
This is too much for me.
I'm having nightmares myself.

1052
00:54:37,932 --> 00:54:40,844
The other night, I dreamed we
were walking down the street...

1053
00:54:41,092 --> 00:54:42,491
...and I stopped to buy fruit.

1054
00:54:42,732 --> 00:54:45,166
Out of nowhere, two guys
come and they kill me...

1055
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:48,489
...like Marlon Brando
in The Godfather.

1056
00:54:49,492 --> 00:54:51,767
Good scene. What'd I do?

1057
00:54:52,012 --> 00:54:53,081
You drop your gun.

1058
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,688
You run up to me and you
yell, "Papa! Papa! "

1059
00:54:57,052 --> 00:54:58,371
I was Fredo?

1060
00:54:58,852 --> 00:55:00,365
I don't think so.

1061
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:04,610
You're starting to lose it.
You may need therapy yourself.

1062
00:55:04,812 --> 00:55:06,689
We really have to talk.

1063
00:55:09,292 --> 00:55:11,044
We're running out of time.

1064
00:55:28,852 --> 00:55:29,967
The widow.

1065
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:31,731
I'm very sorry.

1066
00:55:33,012 --> 00:55:34,047
The daughter.

1067
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:35,447
I'm sorry.

1068
00:55:38,332 --> 00:55:39,367
Brother.

1069
00:55:39,612 --> 00:55:41,170
My condolences.

1070
00:55:46,932 --> 00:55:48,331
I'm very sorry.

1071
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:06,931
Him, I don't know.

1072
00:56:12,132 --> 00:56:13,645
Can we talk now?

1073
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:21,523
Don't you see? You called me Papa.
This is all about your father.

1074
00:56:21,772 --> 00:56:23,251
You're nuts.
That's your dream.

1075
00:56:23,492 --> 00:56:25,767
But the black-milk dream
is also about your father.

1076
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:28,845
I don't buy that. In my dream,
I'm bringing the baby the black milk.

1077
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:31,401
Freud believed you're everyone
in your dreams.

1078
00:56:31,652 --> 00:56:33,449
Fuck Freud.
After what you told me...

1079
00:56:33,692 --> 00:56:36,047
...I'm afraid to call
my mother on the telephone.

1080
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,408
Listen, just try to
go with me here.

1081
00:56:38,652 --> 00:56:40,643
Let's just say that you are the baby.

1082
00:56:40,892 --> 00:56:42,644
What kind of milk did
your father bring?

1083
00:56:42,892 --> 00:56:44,689
Could we stop talking about
my father?

1084
00:56:45,332 --> 00:56:47,846
That's the point. We have to
talk about your father.

1085
00:56:48,092 --> 00:56:50,242
It is so hard to...
You know what you're like?

1086
00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:52,323
"Doc, you got to help me.

1087
00:56:52,572 --> 00:56:54,051
I'm in pain.
Please help me. "

1088
00:56:54,292 --> 00:56:56,886
"All right, Paul, I'll help. "
"Fuck you. Nobody helps me. "

1089
00:56:57,132 --> 00:56:59,088
All right, very good. His is you:

1090
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,482
"That's interesting.
What does that mean to you?

1091
00:57:02,092 --> 00:57:03,366
Anger is a blocked wish. "

1092
00:57:03,612 --> 00:57:05,489
Boo-fucking-hoo-hoo.

1093
00:57:05,732 --> 00:57:07,688
- Let's talk about your father.
- Let's not.

1094
00:57:07,932 --> 00:57:09,081
What does your father do?

1095
00:57:09,332 --> 00:57:10,321
It's not important.

1096
00:57:10,572 --> 00:57:12,528
- What? You paused.
- I did not.

1097
00:57:12,772 --> 00:57:15,605
You just paused. That means you
had a feeling. A thought.

1098
00:57:15,852 --> 00:57:17,729
What does your father do?
What's he do?

1099
00:57:18,092 --> 00:57:20,242
- He's a psychiatrist.
- A psychiatrist?

1100
00:57:22,252 --> 00:57:24,766
Now I know why you're fucked up.
Next patient, please.

1101
00:57:25,132 --> 00:57:26,360
We are running out of time.

1102
00:57:26,612 --> 00:57:29,172
- Let's not waste it on my problems.
- Your father's a problem?

1103
00:57:29,812 --> 00:57:30,847
- That's what you said.
- I did not!

1104
00:57:31,092 --> 00:57:32,047
Now you're upset.

1105
00:57:32,332 --> 00:57:33,128
I am not upset!

1106
00:57:33,372 --> 00:57:34,441
- Yes, you are.
- Stop it!

1107
00:57:34,692 --> 00:57:35,807
I'm getting good at this!

1108
00:57:36,852 --> 00:57:40,003
We only have a few days left.
This is very important stuff.

1109
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:42,083
That's why you're acting like this.

1110
00:57:42,332 --> 00:57:44,288
If you want to screw around,
I can't help you.

1111
00:57:44,612 --> 00:57:46,125
Call me when you get serious.

1112
00:57:46,692 --> 00:57:48,284
I am serious.

1113
00:57:49,412 --> 00:57:51,562
Don't you want to analyze me no more?

1114
00:57:53,132 --> 00:57:54,406
Say hello to your father.

1115
00:58:00,412 --> 00:58:01,970
It's time to end it, Paul.

1116
00:58:02,332 --> 00:58:03,208
What do you mean?

1117
00:58:03,452 --> 00:58:05,841
Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much already.

1118
00:58:06,092 --> 00:58:07,844
You want me to whack my doctor?

1119
00:58:08,092 --> 00:58:10,765
If you don’t do it, somebody else will.

1120
00:58:11,892 --> 00:58:13,120
Nobody touches this guy.

1121
00:58:13,372 --> 00:58:15,647
Anybody lays a finger on him,
I'm gonna kill him.

1122
00:58:16,012 --> 00:58:17,161
Understood?

1123
00:58:18,572 --> 00:58:20,051
Now let's hear the other one.

1124
00:58:21,092 --> 00:58:25,085
-You want me to whack my doctor?
-lf you don't, somebody else will.

1125
00:58:25,852 --> 00:58:27,331
I'm gonna kill him.

1126
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,290
- Good.
- That's very good.

1127
00:58:32,412 --> 00:58:34,004
We think it's time to end it.

1128
00:58:34,252 --> 00:58:35,207
What do you mean?

1129
00:58:35,452 --> 00:58:38,171
Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much already.

1130
00:58:38,412 --> 00:58:42,451
-You want me to whack my doctor?
-lf you don’t, somebody else will.

1131
00:58:43,412 --> 00:58:44,845
I'm gonna kill him.

1132
00:58:49,172 --> 00:58:50,685
What do you want me to do?

1133
00:58:53,732 --> 00:58:55,848
Paul, he's talking to the feds.

1134
00:58:56,092 --> 00:58:58,652
I know this guy. He wouldn't
talk to the feds. No way.

1135
00:58:58,892 --> 00:59:02,567
The FBI was over at his house today.
Jimmy Boots saw them.

1136
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,281
- You saw them there?
- It's the truth. I saw them.

1137
00:59:05,532 --> 00:59:06,931
Next, you'll get a call...

1138
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,810
...and he'll want a meeting.

1139
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:12,520
Dr. Sobel called.

1140
00:59:12,772 --> 00:59:15,127
He said he needs to see you
right away.

1141
00:59:24,692 --> 00:59:26,125
This is delicious.

1142
00:59:26,372 --> 00:59:27,771
This is so good.

1143
00:59:28,132 --> 00:59:29,611
I love Italian food.

1144
00:59:29,852 --> 00:59:31,729
I've never been to Italy. Is it great?

1145
00:59:32,252 --> 00:59:33,731
I was in France twice...

1146
00:59:33,972 --> 00:59:35,690
...and Jamaica, the island.

1147
00:59:35,932 --> 00:59:36,808
You ever been there?

1148
00:59:37,052 --> 00:59:38,804
It's great,
because I love to snorkel.

1149
00:59:39,052 --> 00:59:41,930
You guys ever snorkelled?
It's great to sleep with the fish.

1150
00:59:42,172 --> 00:59:44,163
Swim with the fish.
Ever done that?

1151
00:59:44,412 --> 00:59:46,289
It's good. So...

1152
00:59:46,532 --> 00:59:48,045
...what are you doing this summer?

1153
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:50,171
About what?

1154
00:59:52,412 --> 00:59:53,640
How are you?

1155
00:59:55,452 --> 00:59:57,249
- How you doing?
- Good.

1156
00:59:57,612 --> 00:59:59,921
This is Ben. Say hello to Carlo.

1157
01:00:00,772 --> 01:00:02,091
- How you doing?
- Carlo...?

1158
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,402
That's it. Grab a seat.

1159
01:00:07,492 --> 01:00:09,289
Carlo and I grew up together.

1160
01:00:09,532 --> 01:00:11,363
He's like, I would say, almost...

1161
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:13,364
...like a cousin to me.

1162
01:00:13,612 --> 01:00:15,842
- I am your cousin.
- That's what I'm saying.

1163
01:00:16,092 --> 01:00:18,048
It's a family thing.
It's the closeness.

1164
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:21,125
Anything I can do for him,
I'm here for him.

1165
01:00:21,372 --> 01:00:22,600
- You know that.
- I know.

1166
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:24,524
Did you take care of that thing?

1167
01:00:24,852 --> 01:00:28,162
- It's all right to talk business?
- It's okay.

1168
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:29,925
- I took care of it.
- And the other?

1169
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:33,164
I got to wait for the first
before I can move on the second.

1170
01:00:33,412 --> 01:00:34,891
The guy give you a problem?

1171
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,851
The guy in the first thing?
He's a lunatic.

1172
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,605
- What did he say?
- He usual.

1173
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:42,525
- You told him you weren't doing it?
-What am I going to do?

1174
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,524
Gotta nip that shit in the bud.

1175
01:00:44,772 --> 01:00:47,240
But if the first comes through,
that'll fix everything.

1176
01:00:47,492 --> 01:00:50,165
Including the second thing.
Exactly.

1177
01:00:51,292 --> 01:00:53,442
Don't repeat what you hear here.
You hear?

1178
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:55,690
The first thing
or the second thing?

1179
01:00:55,932 --> 01:00:56,887
Very funny.

1180
01:00:57,132 --> 01:00:58,929
Stevie Beef is over there.

1181
01:01:00,412 --> 01:01:02,403
- Fat piece of shit.
- Rat fucking, cocksucking...

1182
01:01:02,652 --> 01:01:05,007
- Scumbag.
- Garbage pail.

1183
01:01:05,252 --> 01:01:06,401
Let's go say hi.

1184
01:01:11,492 --> 01:01:15,485
This is a very unusual place.
Do you guys come here often?

1185
01:01:15,732 --> 01:01:19,327
Well, this place has
a very special meaning for Paul.

1186
01:01:19,572 --> 01:01:21,881
Yeah, it's where his
father got whacked.

1187
01:01:23,492 --> 01:01:24,527
What's the big secret?

1188
01:01:24,772 --> 01:01:25,761
Never mind.

1189
01:01:26,012 --> 01:01:27,491
Wait a second.

1190
01:01:29,412 --> 01:01:30,811
Paul's father was murdered?

1191
01:01:31,052 --> 01:01:33,361
Right at that table,
with his whole family there.

1192
01:01:33,612 --> 01:01:35,523
Shut your face.

1193
01:01:38,772 --> 01:01:40,524
Paul was there too.

1194
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:43,881
He doesn't like to talk about it.

1195
01:01:50,732 --> 01:01:51,847
Where you going?

1196
01:01:52,092 --> 01:01:53,161
To the bathroom.

1197
01:01:53,612 --> 01:01:54,806
Sit down.

1198
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:56,525
I'm going with you.

1199
01:02:03,492 --> 01:02:05,847
Jelly, I have to, you know...

1200
01:02:06,172 --> 01:02:07,287
Poop?

1201
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:10,287
Go ahead.

1202
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:32,964
Holy shit!

1203
01:02:36,732 --> 01:02:38,848
You got to get more roughage, Doc.

1204
01:02:40,412 --> 01:02:42,528
A bran muffin in the morning
would help that.

1205
01:02:45,172 --> 01:02:46,287
I don't believe this.

1206
01:02:46,532 --> 01:02:48,727
I'd like to see a movie.
Nothing's playing.

1207
01:02:48,972 --> 01:02:52,009
It's all this shoot 'em-up
action bullshit.

1208
01:02:52,252 --> 01:02:54,129
I get enough of that at work.

1209
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:57,686
Primo, that was our friend.

1210
01:02:57,972 --> 01:02:59,928
They spotted that guy
at Paretti's.

1211
01:03:00,172 --> 01:03:01,605
That’s good.

1212
01:03:01,852 --> 01:03:03,285
That’s very good.

1213
01:03:03,532 --> 01:03:05,045
Handsome Jack.

1214
01:03:05,892 --> 01:03:07,689
Let's make it his last supper.

1215
01:03:08,012 --> 01:03:10,128
- You got it, Primo.
- No problem.

1216
01:03:11,612 --> 01:03:13,045
Just for fun...

1217
01:03:13,532 --> 01:03:15,523
...tear out his heart
and bring it to me.

1218
01:03:15,772 --> 01:03:18,605
I'm gonna bring it back to you
on a fucking platter.

1219
01:03:18,852 --> 01:03:20,331
Where we going to get a platter?

1220
01:03:20,572 --> 01:03:21,971
Just bring it, all right?

1221
01:03:22,772 --> 01:03:24,842
Or Raisin Bran. That goes
right through me.

1222
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,844
- It's a pusher.
- Good tip.

1223
01:03:27,092 --> 01:03:29,845
I have to talk to you.
In private.

1224
01:03:34,932 --> 01:03:36,684
Why didn't you tell me
about your father?

1225
01:03:36,932 --> 01:03:39,765
- What about him?
- You said he died of a heart attack.

1226
01:03:40,012 --> 01:03:41,047
What's the problem?

1227
01:03:41,292 --> 01:03:43,044
Your father was murdered.

1228
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:45,728
What's the difference? He's dead.

1229
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:48,770
It's a big difference.
Why didn't you tell me?

1230
01:03:49,012 --> 01:03:51,480
It's private. I got to tell you
every little thing?

1231
01:03:51,732 --> 01:03:53,131
This is not a little thing.

1232
01:03:53,372 --> 01:03:55,442
What should I do?
Spend my life crying over the past?

1233
01:03:55,692 --> 01:03:56,886
It's over. Forget it.

1234
01:03:57,132 --> 01:03:59,043
I think you want to talk about it.

1235
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:01,044
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You do.

1236
01:04:01,292 --> 01:04:02,850
I don't want to talk about it.

1237
01:04:03,092 --> 01:04:05,322
- Why did you choose this restaurant?
- I like it.

1238
01:04:05,572 --> 01:04:07,483
Of all the places to go,
why here?

1239
01:04:07,732 --> 01:04:08,642
White clam sauce. The best.

1240
01:04:08,892 --> 01:04:12,282
That’s not the reason. You want me
to know about your father.

1241
01:04:12,532 --> 01:04:15,365
- You're reaching out to me.
- Yeah, I'm reaching out to you.

1242
01:04:15,972 --> 01:04:16,768
Where is it?

1243
01:04:26,412 --> 01:04:27,208
Get in the car.

1244
01:04:29,772 --> 01:04:32,889
It's late. I'll take a cab.
I can get to Grand Central and...

1245
01:04:33,132 --> 01:04:34,884
You know what?
I can make the 11:10.

1246
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:36,406
So thanks anyway.

1247
01:04:36,652 --> 01:04:38,768
I said get in the car, Doc.

1248
01:04:39,932 --> 01:04:41,411
Do what he says.

1249
01:04:42,572 --> 01:04:46,485
You know, this is called a "transference
neurosis, " where the patient...

1250
01:04:49,892 --> 01:04:51,291
Get in the car.

1251
01:05:15,452 --> 01:05:18,922
What is this guy doing? He's been
in the bathroom for half an hour.

1252
01:05:19,532 --> 01:05:20,487
Fuck!

1253
01:05:20,732 --> 01:05:21,687
Get over there!

1254
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,489
Son of a bitch!

1255
01:05:33,492 --> 01:05:34,607
We lost him.

1256
01:06:02,372 --> 01:06:03,691
Come on, get out.

1257
01:06:03,932 --> 01:06:05,445
Get out. Get over there.

1258
01:06:09,692 --> 01:06:11,171
All right, leave us alone.

1259
01:06:12,852 --> 01:06:14,080
Sorry, Doc.

1260
01:06:14,372 --> 01:06:15,441
It's not personal.

1261
01:06:15,692 --> 01:06:18,684
Don't kid yourself. It doesn't
get more personal than this.

1262
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,331
Walk over there.

1263
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:24,045
Walk over there.

1264
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,802
- You know why I gotta do this?
- Yes. Do you?

1265
01:06:32,052 --> 01:06:34,771
Don't bullshit me.
You ratted me out. You betrayed me.

1266
01:06:35,012 --> 01:06:37,765
I betrayed you? That’s interesting.
Who's got the gun?

1267
01:06:38,012 --> 01:06:40,480
Don't give me that.
Are you insulting my intelligence?

1268
01:06:40,732 --> 01:06:42,211
You cooperated with the feds.

1269
01:06:42,452 --> 01:06:45,489
They played me a tape. I heard you
say you were gonna kill me.

1270
01:06:45,732 --> 01:06:48,007
- I heard the tape.
- Never. On my mother's life.

1271
01:06:48,252 --> 01:06:49,241
- Never.
- I heard it.

1272
01:06:49,492 --> 01:06:51,801
It's not important now,
but I did not betray you.

1273
01:06:52,052 --> 01:06:54,612
I had a wire, but took it off
because I think I can help.

1274
01:06:54,852 --> 01:06:56,729
I don't want to know what you think.

1275
01:06:56,972 --> 01:06:57,768
Yes, you do.

1276
01:06:58,012 --> 01:06:59,365
Let me help you!

1277
01:06:59,612 --> 01:07:00,761
It's over!

1278
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,564
Can I ask you one last question?

1279
01:07:08,412 --> 01:07:09,242
What?

1280
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:10,720
- What did you order?
- What?

1281
01:07:10,972 --> 01:07:12,485
- What did you order?
- When?

1282
01:07:12,732 --> 01:07:15,405
The night your father was killed,
what were you eating?

1283
01:07:15,652 --> 01:07:17,449
How the fuck do I know?

1284
01:07:17,852 --> 01:07:18,841
You don't remember?

1285
01:07:19,092 --> 01:07:20,366
It was 35 years ago.

1286
01:07:20,612 --> 01:07:21,761
What was your father eating?

1287
01:07:22,012 --> 01:07:24,242
I don't remember.
What are you talking about?

1288
01:07:24,532 --> 01:07:25,442
Try.

1289
01:07:26,012 --> 01:07:29,527
It's a simple question.
What was your father eating?

1290
01:07:39,252 --> 01:07:40,082
Penne.

1291
01:07:41,652 --> 01:07:42,448
Good.

1292
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:44,011
What did you have?

1293
01:07:48,332 --> 01:07:49,526
Ravioli.

1294
01:07:50,892 --> 01:07:52,803
The food was already on the table?

1295
01:07:53,532 --> 01:07:55,124
No, they were serving it.

1296
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,124
And did you see the guys coming?

1297
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:01,441
One of them.

1298
01:08:03,092 --> 01:08:04,764
Dressed like a busboy.

1299
01:08:06,052 --> 01:08:07,724
Your father saw him too?

1300
01:08:09,892 --> 01:08:11,371
I knew the guy looked wrong.

1301
01:08:11,612 --> 01:08:12,647
Why, Paul?

1302
01:08:13,092 --> 01:08:16,084
The pants. Looked too good
for a busboy.

1303
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:19,123
So he walked to the table.

1304
01:08:19,372 --> 01:08:21,169
I watched him the whole way.

1305
01:08:21,452 --> 01:08:22,965
Did you say anything?

1306
01:08:28,132 --> 01:08:31,169
Dad was so mad at me,
I couldn't say anything.

1307
01:08:31,412 --> 01:08:32,845
And you were mad at him.

1308
01:08:34,852 --> 01:08:36,205
And then what happened?

1309
01:08:36,452 --> 01:08:39,569
I never saw the second guy.
My mother just started screaming.

1310
01:08:40,252 --> 01:08:42,004
And you blame yourself.

1311
01:08:42,332 --> 01:08:44,607
I could've saved him.

1312
01:08:44,852 --> 01:08:46,251
But you were mad at him.

1313
01:08:46,492 --> 01:08:48,164
I should've said something.

1314
01:08:48,412 --> 01:08:50,289
You couldn't have saved him, Paul.

1315
01:08:50,572 --> 01:08:52,085
I killed him.

1316
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:54,571
You didn't kill him.

1317
01:08:54,812 --> 01:08:57,531
You were mad, but you didn't
kill him. It's the life he chose.

1318
01:08:57,772 --> 01:08:59,967
I just let him die.

1319
01:09:01,252 --> 01:09:03,641
I let him die!

1320
01:09:06,372 --> 01:09:10,923
I let him die, and I couldn't
say goodbye to him.

1321
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:15,044
So why don't you say it now?

1322
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:17,328
If he was here,
what would you say?

1323
01:09:17,572 --> 01:09:18,766
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1324
01:09:19,012 --> 01:09:20,047
I can't.

1325
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:21,327
No, I can't.

1326
01:09:21,572 --> 01:09:22,482
Tell him, Paul.

1327
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,364
I want to say I'm...

1328
01:09:25,612 --> 01:09:27,125
Dad, I'm sorry.

1329
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:31,406
I'm sorry.

1330
01:09:32,812 --> 01:09:34,370
I'm sorry, Dad.

1331
01:09:35,812 --> 01:09:38,167
I'm sorry. I let him die.

1332
01:09:39,572 --> 01:09:41,881
I'm sorry, Dad.

1333
01:09:44,452 --> 01:09:45,487
Jesus.

1334
01:09:46,532 --> 01:09:48,443
Poor guy's falling apart.

1335
01:09:48,692 --> 01:09:50,091
Why don't he just pop him?

1336
01:09:50,332 --> 01:09:53,085
It's embarrassing,
standing here like this.

1337
01:09:53,692 --> 01:09:54,522
Shut up.

1338
01:10:02,492 --> 01:10:03,527
You couldn't save him.

1339
01:10:03,772 --> 01:10:05,251
I know I could've. I could've.

1340
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,403
No, he was trying to save you.

1341
01:10:07,652 --> 01:10:09,324
That’s what you fought about.

1342
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:13,008
He didn't want this for you.
And you don't want it for Anthony.

1343
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:14,162
No, I don't!

1344
01:10:14,412 --> 01:10:17,563
You don't want him to grow up
like you did, without a father.

1345
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,483
Your father's not dead, Paul.

1346
01:10:25,732 --> 01:10:29,122
He's alive in you.
And he's trying to tell you something.

1347
01:10:29,372 --> 01:10:30,566
He's trying to tell you...

1348
01:10:30,812 --> 01:10:32,245
Holy shit!

1349
01:10:34,052 --> 01:10:36,566
They’re shooting! They’re shooting!

1350
01:10:41,892 --> 01:10:44,360
- Pull yourself together!
- I feel so bad!

1351
01:10:44,652 --> 01:10:46,961
You're going to feel a lot worse.

1352
01:10:51,012 --> 01:10:53,446
Time to channel all this
nice grief...

1353
01:10:53,812 --> 01:10:55,086
...into a murderous rage.

1354
01:10:57,092 --> 01:10:58,571
Come on!
Time to shoot back!

1355
01:10:58,812 --> 01:11:00,928
Let's go! Here we go!
Bang, bang!

1356
01:11:02,332 --> 01:11:04,402
Bang, bang! Come on. Let's go.

1357
01:11:04,652 --> 01:11:06,768
Come on! Bang, bang!

1358
01:11:07,252 --> 01:11:08,651
Now come on. Paul, here.

1359
01:11:08,892 --> 01:11:11,247
Put the gun in your hand and shoot!

1360
01:11:11,492 --> 01:11:13,881
For God sakes, shoot somebody!

1361
01:11:16,092 --> 01:11:17,844
Give me the fucking gun!

1362
01:11:35,452 --> 01:11:36,771
Stay down.

1363
01:11:38,332 --> 01:11:39,685
Paul, you okay?

1364
01:11:39,932 --> 01:11:41,251
Yeah, I'm okay.

1365
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:43,931
Jelly, did I do that?

1366
01:11:44,492 --> 01:11:45,686
No, Doc.

1367
01:11:45,932 --> 01:11:46,921
That one's mine.

1368
01:11:47,172 --> 01:11:48,810
You get the '72 Chevy...

1369
01:11:49,052 --> 01:11:52,283
...and the Amana side-by-side
refrigerator-freezer.

1370
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,326
- You okay, Paul?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1371
01:11:55,572 --> 01:11:57,403
I'm gonna check on Jimmy.

1372
01:12:04,532 --> 01:12:06,568
Pretty fucking ironic, ain't it?

1373
01:12:07,772 --> 01:12:09,683
You can give me back the gun now.

1374
01:12:10,652 --> 01:12:13,325
It's okay. I wasn't really
gonna whack you.

1375
01:12:14,652 --> 01:12:16,722
All right, maybe I was
gonna whack you...

1376
01:12:16,972 --> 01:12:19,566
...but I was real conflicted about it.

1377
01:12:19,812 --> 01:12:21,131
Progress, right?

1378
01:12:26,852 --> 01:12:28,570
I can't see you anymore.

1379
01:12:29,572 --> 01:12:30,800
I know.

1380
01:12:33,172 --> 01:12:34,890
You hit some
very big stuff tonight.

1381
01:12:35,132 --> 01:12:37,441
So you'll probably
feel like this for a while.

1382
01:12:38,132 --> 01:12:39,884
But you're close to something.

1383
01:12:40,772 --> 01:12:42,091
The rest is up to you.

1384
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:44,247
Good luck.

1385
01:12:52,412 --> 01:12:54,721
I want to please him
when we're in bed...

1386
01:12:54,972 --> 01:12:58,328
...but whatever I do, it seems
like it's never enough.

1387
01:12:58,652 --> 01:13:01,769
Now he wants me to
say things when we're making love.

1388
01:13:05,572 --> 01:13:07,927
What kind of things does he
want you to say?

1389
01:13:08,292 --> 01:13:10,601
Well, he wants me to call him...

1390
01:13:10,852 --> 01:13:12,126
..."big boy"...

1391
01:13:13,812 --> 01:13:16,246
...and he's my "bucking bronco"...

1392
01:13:17,012 --> 01:13:19,048
...and I'm supposed
to "ride him hard"...

1393
01:13:19,292 --> 01:13:22,011
...and "put him back
in the barn wet. "

1394
01:13:32,612 --> 01:13:33,965
Are you okay, Dr. Sobel?

1395
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:36,731
Well, it's...

1396
01:13:39,412 --> 01:13:41,562
Here's what I think
you should do, Elaine.

1397
01:13:42,612 --> 01:13:44,921
I would do whatever he says.

1398
01:13:45,572 --> 01:13:47,688
If he wants you to talk, talk.

1399
01:13:47,932 --> 01:13:49,604
I'd get down
and bark like a dog.

1400
01:13:49,852 --> 01:13:51,080
I'd do whatever it takes.

1401
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:53,527
Smoke some joints,
drink wine, whatever it is...

1402
01:13:53,772 --> 01:13:55,763
...to get off on each other
and be happy.

1403
01:13:56,012 --> 01:13:57,161
Where are you running?

1404
01:13:57,412 --> 01:13:59,130
This is a time to be happy!

1405
01:13:59,372 --> 01:14:01,727
Because life is just too short.

1406
01:14:01,972 --> 01:14:05,169
It's just too fucking short.

1407
01:14:13,652 --> 01:14:15,131
I'll see you Thursday.

1408
01:14:20,092 --> 01:14:21,286
Everything okay?

1409
01:14:24,332 --> 01:14:25,651
Feeling all right?

1410
01:14:25,892 --> 01:14:27,245
You need anything?

1411
01:14:27,492 --> 01:14:28,368
No. Feel great.

1412
01:14:28,612 --> 01:14:30,330
Never felt better.

1413
01:14:30,852 --> 01:14:34,481
Wait till I go to that meeting.
I'm gonna knock them dead.

1414
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:37,685
All right. I'll be outside.

1415
01:14:43,892 --> 01:14:45,007
When I look at him...

1416
01:14:45,252 --> 01:14:47,482
... I think about how
different it was.

1417
01:14:47,892 --> 01:14:50,565
Was providing for a family
simpler back then...

1418
01:14:50,812 --> 01:14:53,167
... or did he just make it
look that way?

1419
01:14:56,532 --> 01:14:58,488
Decisions are tougher now.

1420
01:14:58,772 --> 01:15:00,125
There's so much information...

1421
01:15:00,372 --> 01:15:02,681
... so many ways to invest.

1422
01:15:09,332 --> 01:15:11,687
Strange. I spent the first half
of my life...

1423
01:15:11,932 --> 01:15:14,048
... not wanting to walk
in his footsteps.

1424
01:15:14,332 --> 01:15:16,368
Now I only wish I could.

1425
01:15:19,572 --> 01:15:21,403
Times are more complex.

1426
01:15:21,652 --> 01:15:24,485
A Merrill Lynch financial
consultant can help with a plan...

1427
01:15:24,732 --> 01:15:28,247
... and more ways to make
the plan work than anyone else.

1428
01:15:38,892 --> 01:15:40,564
You look beautiful, honey.

1429
01:15:51,652 --> 01:15:54,724
We are put on this earth
to find a love, a soul mate...

1430
01:15:54,972 --> 01:15:57,725
...someone with whom
we can create joy.

1431
01:15:57,972 --> 01:15:59,041
And how glad we are...

1432
01:15:59,292 --> 01:16:00,930
...that Ben and Laura
found each other.

1433
01:16:01,172 --> 01:16:02,890
And we anticipate and celebrate...

1434
01:16:03,132 --> 01:16:06,283
...the years of joy they will
share together from this day on.

1435
01:16:09,092 --> 01:16:11,242
Do you take Laura to be
your wedded wife...

1436
01:16:11,492 --> 01:16:13,369
...for richer or poorer,
in sickness or health...

1437
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:15,523
...till death do you part,
so help you God?

1438
01:16:16,732 --> 01:16:18,006
Excuse me?

1439
01:16:18,452 --> 01:16:20,522
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to him.

1440
01:16:20,772 --> 01:16:21,887
Who him?

1441
01:16:22,132 --> 01:16:23,326
It's not important. Yes.

1442
01:16:23,772 --> 01:16:24,727
Yes, what?

1443
01:16:24,972 --> 01:16:26,724
Yes to the first part. To her.

1444
01:16:26,972 --> 01:16:28,883
That's a yes. Pick it up from there.

1445
01:16:29,532 --> 01:16:31,363
Doc, this is an emergency.

1446
01:16:31,612 --> 01:16:33,489
- I don't believe this.
- This is my wedding!

1447
01:16:33,732 --> 01:16:36,371
- Want me to make a scene?
- Bigger than this?

1448
01:16:37,692 --> 01:16:39,091
Tick-tock. Let's go.

1449
01:16:39,332 --> 01:16:40,128
Hurry. Pronounce.

1450
01:16:40,412 --> 01:16:43,290
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1451
01:16:44,252 --> 01:16:45,526
Ring, ring. Kiss, kiss.

1452
01:16:47,172 --> 01:16:49,402
Here. Fine. Good.
Okay, just go.

1453
01:16:49,652 --> 01:16:51,768
Sorry, Mrs. Sobel. Duty calls.

1454
01:16:52,012 --> 01:16:54,480
You're the first person to
call me Mrs. Sobel.

1455
01:16:54,972 --> 01:16:55,768
Nice, huh?

1456
01:17:06,092 --> 01:17:08,128
I'm telling you, Doc,
this is serious.

1457
01:17:08,372 --> 01:17:10,442
If he don't make that meeting,
they'll kill him.

1458
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,648
Can't somebody else
in the family go for him?

1459
01:17:12,892 --> 01:17:15,850
What about Tommy the tongue
or Louie the Lip?

1460
01:17:16,092 --> 01:17:17,684
What about you? Why don't you go?

1461
01:17:17,972 --> 01:17:21,009
That would be a very good idea,
except for one little detail.

1462
01:17:21,252 --> 01:17:24,005
I'm a fucking moron.
I'm known for it.

1463
01:17:24,372 --> 01:17:26,328
- You gotta go.
- You must be a moron.

1464
01:17:26,572 --> 01:17:27,800
- Watch it!
- You just said it.

1465
01:17:28,052 --> 01:17:31,249
When I say it, it's different.
When you say it, it sounds negative.

1466
01:17:31,492 --> 01:17:33,448
Jelly, I am not going
to any meeting.

1467
01:17:33,692 --> 01:17:36,286
I am no longer on the payroll.
Do you understand that?

1468
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:38,966
Now, I am going back to my wife.

1469
01:17:43,052 --> 01:17:45,327
Now, Jelly, we've
been through this before.

1470
01:17:45,572 --> 01:17:46,766
You can't shoot me.

1471
01:17:47,012 --> 01:17:48,127
Correction:

1472
01:17:48,892 --> 01:17:51,326
It was Mr. Vitti who
couldn't shoot you.

1473
01:17:52,892 --> 01:17:54,962
You're going to that meeting.

1474
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:02,442
This is Surveillance 6. They've left
the building and are heading east.

1475
01:18:02,692 --> 01:18:03,886
Roger that.

1476
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:08,611
- Put this on.
- Is this chrome?

1477
01:18:08,852 --> 01:18:10,126
I can see my own reflection.

1478
01:18:10,372 --> 01:18:11,691
Let me tell you something.

1479
01:18:11,932 --> 01:18:13,604
That’s a $1,200 Valentino suit.

1480
01:18:13,852 --> 01:18:15,365
If you spill anything on it...

1481
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:17,330
...I'm gonna mess you up good.

1482
01:18:17,572 --> 01:18:19,688
Shut up! You're
making him nervous.

1483
01:18:19,932 --> 01:18:22,321
If he fucks up,
they'll kill him for sure.

1484
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:23,687
This is insane!

1485
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:27,686
It's all right. Let's go over it
again. Mr. Vitti's been detained.

1486
01:18:27,932 --> 01:18:29,888
Apologies all around.

1487
01:18:30,652 --> 01:18:33,212
And then you say
you're the new consigliore...

1488
01:18:33,452 --> 01:18:34,851
...speaking for Mr. Vitti.

1489
01:18:35,092 --> 01:18:36,002
Then what?

1490
01:18:36,252 --> 01:18:39,688
Then you keep your mouth shut
and hope nobody asks you nothing.

1491
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:41,604
That’s some plan you got there.

1492
01:18:41,852 --> 01:18:45,242
Shut up!
Doc, if you gotta talk...

1493
01:18:45,572 --> 01:18:47,528
...try to be vague.
Could you do that?

1494
01:18:47,772 --> 01:18:50,650
I'm a psychiatrist.
Believe me, I can be vague.

1495
01:18:53,492 --> 01:18:55,448
Looks like they're
headed for the tunnel.

1496
01:18:57,812 --> 01:19:00,087
We'll pick them up
on the other side.

1497
01:19:05,172 --> 01:19:06,651
Here they come.

1498
01:19:10,012 --> 01:19:10,842
Which one is it?

1499
01:19:11,092 --> 01:19:12,684
The black one.

1500
01:19:24,732 --> 01:19:26,927
Are you sure you don't want
something to eat?

1501
01:19:28,692 --> 01:19:30,489
You want some iced tea?

1502
01:19:31,932 --> 01:19:34,048
I think I'm gonna call
Dr. Erragrossa.

1503
01:19:34,292 --> 01:19:36,123
Is Daddy gonna be all right?

1504
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:39,324
I think so, honey.

1505
01:19:39,652 --> 01:19:41,483
Shouldn't you be outside playing?

1506
01:19:42,172 --> 01:19:43,730
No, it's all right.

1507
01:19:45,532 --> 01:19:47,090
How long you gonna sit there?

1508
01:19:47,612 --> 01:19:49,250
How long you gonna lay there?

1509
01:19:53,252 --> 01:19:54,367
I'm done.

1510
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:31,927
Let's go.

1511
01:20:34,092 --> 01:20:35,491
It'll be all right, Doc.

1512
01:20:50,492 --> 01:20:52,847
There's no way I can
get away with this.

1513
01:20:53,252 --> 01:20:54,651
Jelly, I can't do this!

1514
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:56,530
Don't fucking whine.

1515
01:20:56,772 --> 01:20:58,888
Whining's a dead giveaway.

1516
01:20:59,132 --> 01:21:00,167
Blend.

1517
01:21:00,652 --> 01:21:01,801
Blend in.

1518
01:21:08,732 --> 01:21:10,165
So where's Vitti?

1519
01:21:10,692 --> 01:21:11,841
He ain't here.

1520
01:21:12,092 --> 01:21:13,320
He ain't here.

1521
01:21:13,572 --> 01:21:14,448
How you doing?

1522
01:21:14,692 --> 01:21:17,047
How you doing?
How you been? All right?

1523
01:21:17,692 --> 01:21:18,727
All right.

1524
01:21:19,532 --> 01:21:21,409
Hey, when did you guys get out?

1525
01:21:21,652 --> 01:21:23,483
You need anything, you let me know.

1526
01:21:31,372 --> 01:21:32,771
Easter weekend.

1527
01:21:34,452 --> 01:21:35,771
You're a planet!

1528
01:21:39,492 --> 01:21:40,686
Blending, enough.

1529
01:21:43,852 --> 01:21:45,331
Who's the guy with Jelly?

1530
01:21:45,612 --> 01:21:47,170
I never seen him before.

1531
01:21:54,012 --> 01:21:55,809
What's going on? Where's Paul?

1532
01:21:56,292 --> 01:21:57,520
He'll be here. Don't worry.

1533
01:21:57,772 --> 01:21:59,490
And what's he doing here?

1534
01:22:00,452 --> 01:22:01,487
He's just...

1535
01:22:02,572 --> 01:22:03,925
Forget about it.

1536
01:22:04,332 --> 01:22:05,526
Forget about it?

1537
01:22:05,812 --> 01:22:07,882
What the hell is that?
"Forget about it."

1538
01:22:08,452 --> 01:22:11,524
I can't do this.
No, I can't do this.

1539
01:22:12,332 --> 01:22:14,323
I think we're going
to get started here.

1540
01:22:14,572 --> 01:22:16,802
We got a lot to talk about
here today, and...

1541
01:22:17,052 --> 01:22:19,930
...for now, we'll just stick
with the more important issues.

1542
01:22:20,172 --> 01:22:21,127
And one more thing...

1543
01:22:21,372 --> 01:22:23,203
...if you got anything to say...

1544
01:22:23,452 --> 01:22:26,364
...let us know who you are, because
a lot of us don't know each other.

1545
01:22:26,612 --> 01:22:30,924
I didn't think anybody here was
into wearing fucking nametags.

1546
01:22:39,372 --> 01:22:41,010
I'm Primo Sindone.

1547
01:22:41,252 --> 01:22:43,083
They call me Sonny Long.

1548
01:22:43,332 --> 01:22:45,607
Some of you know me
as Mikey Gaga.

1549
01:22:45,852 --> 01:22:47,649
Some of you know me
as Joey Boombots.

1550
01:22:47,892 --> 01:22:51,407
Be that as it may, it's good to see so
many of the old faces here...

1551
01:22:51,652 --> 01:22:54,405
...and to welcome some of the new ones
from all over the country.

1552
01:22:55,612 --> 01:22:58,172
I see Joe Baldassare,
Frankie Zello.

1553
01:22:59,652 --> 01:23:03,406
But I'm disappointed the head of our
other New York family isn't here.

1554
01:23:04,092 --> 01:23:07,562
All I see is his man Jelly and some
sawed-off prick nobody knows.

1555
01:23:15,412 --> 01:23:17,084
The thing is...

1556
01:23:17,332 --> 01:23:20,324
...Mr. Vitti's been detained.

1557
01:23:21,852 --> 01:23:24,605
Plus, he's sorry for his detainment.

1558
01:23:24,852 --> 01:23:25,887
Detained?

1559
01:23:26,332 --> 01:23:27,606
What kind of shit is that?

1560
01:23:28,132 --> 01:23:30,088
What's more important than this?

1561
01:23:30,332 --> 01:23:33,881
As the host, I take his not being
There as a sign of disrespect to me...

1562
01:23:34,132 --> 01:23:37,090
...and all these other men
who came a long way to be here.

1563
01:23:38,332 --> 01:23:40,050
I mean, no. I mean...

1564
01:23:40,292 --> 01:23:42,726
You see, the thing is that
he's not feeling well.

1565
01:23:42,972 --> 01:23:44,724
Plus, he don't feel good.

1566
01:23:47,132 --> 01:23:48,611
What's the matter with you?

1567
01:23:48,852 --> 01:23:51,002
Never discuss Mr. Vitti's
health outside the family.

1568
01:23:51,252 --> 01:23:52,924
You know better than that.

1569
01:23:53,372 --> 01:23:54,361
Sit down.

1570
01:23:55,292 --> 01:23:56,771
Sit down!

1571
01:23:57,252 --> 01:23:58,844
You want a fresh one?

1572
01:24:02,132 --> 01:24:02,928
Who is this guy?

1573
01:24:03,172 --> 01:24:04,764
What the fuck is he doing here?

1574
01:24:05,012 --> 01:24:05,922
Who I am?

1575
01:24:06,172 --> 01:24:07,924
Who I am? Who am I?

1576
01:24:08,172 --> 01:24:09,844
"Who am I?" is a question
for the ages.

1577
01:24:10,092 --> 01:24:12,731
That’s one we're all searching for,
to find out who I am.

1578
01:24:12,972 --> 01:24:15,008
Who's in there, who wants
to come out and go...

1579
01:24:15,252 --> 01:24:16,480
..."Hey, I'm hungry. "

1580
01:24:16,852 --> 01:24:18,331
Who I am...

1581
01:24:18,612 --> 01:24:20,648
...is too deep and...

1582
01:24:20,892 --> 01:24:22,769
You got to go in
and pull out the thing...

1583
01:24:23,012 --> 01:24:25,731
...like that movie where the thing
came out of the stomach...

1584
01:24:25,972 --> 01:24:28,088
...and ate the people on
the fucking spaceship.

1585
01:24:28,332 --> 01:24:29,765
May they rest in peace.

1586
01:24:30,012 --> 01:24:31,809
My name is Ben Sobel.

1587
01:24:33,172 --> 01:24:34,207
Leone.

1588
01:24:34,452 --> 01:24:35,726
Ben Sobeleone.

1589
01:24:36,052 --> 01:24:37,644
I'm also known...

1590
01:24:37,892 --> 01:24:41,487
...as Benny the Groin,
Sammy the Schnoz...

1591
01:24:41,732 --> 01:24:44,041
...Elmer the Fudd,
Tubby the Tuba...

1592
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:46,601
...and once as
Miss Phyllis Levine.

1593
01:24:46,852 --> 01:24:48,808
But that was at a party, years ago.

1594
01:24:49,052 --> 01:24:51,247
I smoked a titibet,
and I had a Quaalude...

1595
01:24:51,492 --> 01:24:54,086
...and suddenly I'm in fishnets
singing show tunes.

1596
01:24:54,332 --> 01:24:56,527
These things happen,
but it has nothing to do...

1597
01:24:56,772 --> 01:24:59,332
...with what I'm doing here
with you fine gentlemen today.

1598
01:24:59,572 --> 01:25:00,607
So I apologize.

1599
01:25:00,852 --> 01:25:04,606
That being said, I'm also known to
the people who know me the best...

1600
01:25:04,852 --> 01:25:06,763
...as the fucking "Doctor."

1601
01:25:07,332 --> 01:25:11,245
The second part of your question
that you "asked" me...

1602
01:25:11,492 --> 01:25:14,609
...is "Why am I here? "
I am here...

1603
01:25:15,172 --> 01:25:18,369
...representing Mr. Paul Vitti
as his Consigliore.

1604
01:25:20,092 --> 01:25:20,922
Consigliore.

1605
01:25:24,852 --> 01:25:27,286
Never correct me in public again.

1606
01:25:27,532 --> 01:25:29,284
Do you understand that?

1607
01:25:30,732 --> 01:25:32,450
You broke my heart, Jelly.

1608
01:25:32,692 --> 01:25:34,603
You broke my heart.

1609
01:25:37,172 --> 01:25:40,244
I apologize for
the second interruption.

1610
01:25:41,692 --> 01:25:43,569
As Mr. Vitti's...

1611
01:25:43,812 --> 01:25:45,404
...consigliore...

1612
01:25:47,052 --> 01:25:50,328
...I am involved in all aspects
of the Vitti family business...

1613
01:25:50,572 --> 01:25:52,961
...and am prepared to speak
for Mr. Vitti on all matters.

1614
01:25:53,252 --> 01:25:55,163
Badda-bing-badda-boom-Betty Boop.

1615
01:25:55,772 --> 01:25:57,364
Okay, Doctor.

1616
01:25:57,612 --> 01:25:59,409
Let's stop with the bullshit.

1617
01:26:02,132 --> 01:26:03,884
There's been this thing
between me...

1618
01:26:04,132 --> 01:26:05,690
...and Paul Vitti for a long time.

1619
01:26:07,092 --> 01:26:10,323
Are you talking about the first thing
or the second thing?

1620
01:26:10,652 --> 01:26:12,643
What second thing?
I only know one thing.

1621
01:26:13,572 --> 01:26:16,928
How can we bring up the first
if we don't talk about the second?

1622
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,491
Did you talk to the guy?

1623
01:26:18,732 --> 01:26:19,562
What guy?

1624
01:26:20,612 --> 01:26:22,250
The guy with the thing!

1625
01:26:22,492 --> 01:26:24,244
What thing?
What are you talking about?

1626
01:26:24,492 --> 01:26:26,369
How should I know?
You brought it up!

1627
01:26:26,612 --> 01:26:28,409
This is the problem.
Do you see this?

1628
01:26:28,652 --> 01:26:30,244
You see what's happening here?

1629
01:26:30,492 --> 01:26:33,962
You can't have an intelligent
conversation with this guy.

1630
01:26:36,052 --> 01:26:39,249
What if I put two bullets in your brain?
What do you think of that?

1631
01:26:39,492 --> 01:26:41,881
That’s a little dark.
What do you think?

1632
01:26:42,132 --> 01:26:45,761
It's a good idea. Why would I say
it if I didn't think it was good?

1633
01:26:46,012 --> 01:26:47,127
I don't know, why?

1634
01:26:47,652 --> 01:26:49,529
I wouldn't!
That’s what I'm saying!

1635
01:26:51,332 --> 01:26:54,449
Look at what's happening here.
Look at you.

1636
01:26:54,972 --> 01:26:58,408
Do you feel you have to get angry
so people will listen to you?

1637
01:26:58,652 --> 01:26:59,721
Is that your deal?

1638
01:26:59,972 --> 01:27:01,041
What is he saying?

1639
01:27:01,292 --> 01:27:03,681
You do have a tendency
to get angry a lot.

1640
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:05,365
I agree, Primo.

1641
01:27:05,612 --> 01:27:08,001
I'm talking about Vitti.
Why are we talking about me?

1642
01:27:08,852 --> 01:27:10,171
That’s interesting too.

1643
01:27:10,492 --> 01:27:14,804
Do you feel you're not important
enough for us to discuss you?

1644
01:27:15,052 --> 01:27:16,644
- What does that mean?
- What do you think?

1645
01:27:16,892 --> 01:27:18,120
Fuck you!

1646
01:27:18,652 --> 01:27:19,801
Calm down.

1647
01:27:20,052 --> 01:27:22,088
his prick won't stop
with the questions.

1648
01:27:22,332 --> 01:27:23,242
Pass the fruit.

1649
01:27:23,492 --> 01:27:24,447
You're a dead man!

1650
01:27:29,692 --> 01:27:30,727
Put it down.

1651
01:27:32,292 --> 01:27:33,247
Put it down.

1652
01:27:39,132 --> 01:27:41,930
- Wait in the car. Keep it running.
- How are you feeling?

1653
01:27:42,172 --> 01:27:44,003
Sit down.
I'll take it from here.

1654
01:27:44,252 --> 01:27:45,048
Sit down.

1655
01:27:48,292 --> 01:27:49,691
I'm Paul Vitti.

1656
01:27:50,172 --> 01:27:53,687
I'm sorry I was late. Those who know me
know I meant no disrespect.

1657
01:27:54,572 --> 01:27:56,290
If it's all right with you...

1658
01:27:56,572 --> 01:27:59,723
...I want to say something.
Then I'll leave you to your business.

1659
01:27:59,972 --> 01:28:03,647
About 21/2 weeks ago, somebody killed
my dear friend, Dominic Manetta.

1660
01:28:05,612 --> 01:28:07,011
Come on, this is bullshit.

1661
01:28:07,252 --> 01:28:10,164
Everybody knows he whacked Dominic
so he could take over.

1662
01:28:10,572 --> 01:28:11,561
Whatever.

1663
01:28:11,812 --> 01:28:16,488
What I came to say is I've come to
a very important decision in my life.

1664
01:28:16,732 --> 01:28:18,085
And that is...

1665
01:28:18,972 --> 01:28:20,291
...I want out.

1666
01:28:20,772 --> 01:28:22,524
I don't want to do this no more.

1667
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:25,843
I'm going to
go away for a while...

1668
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:29,050
...but I will respect the oath
I took the day I was made...

1669
01:28:29,292 --> 01:28:32,568
...and what I know about anybody's
business I take to the grave.

1670
01:28:32,812 --> 01:28:34,370
You have my word.

1671
01:28:35,452 --> 01:28:37,408
As for my own family...

1672
01:28:38,012 --> 01:28:40,845
...I know Carlo Mangano would
like to be the new boss.

1673
01:28:41,092 --> 01:28:42,207
Thank you, Paul.

1674
01:28:42,452 --> 01:28:44,568
That’s why he betrayed Dominic
and me...

1675
01:28:44,812 --> 01:28:47,121
...and sent his man
to Miami to try and kill me.

1676
01:28:47,372 --> 01:28:48,646
I swear you got this wrong...

1677
01:28:48,892 --> 01:28:50,007
Shut your mouth.

1678
01:28:51,012 --> 01:28:53,003
Although it's my right,
I won't take revenge.

1679
01:28:53,252 --> 01:28:55,720
You wanna know why?
Because you got a problem.

1680
01:28:55,972 --> 01:28:57,610
A problem with aggression.

1681
01:28:57,852 --> 01:28:59,524
Maybe you weren't hugged as a kid.

1682
01:28:59,772 --> 01:29:01,490
You ought to look inside yourself...

1683
01:29:01,732 --> 01:29:04,405
...Look inside and
find out who you are.

1684
01:29:05,332 --> 01:29:06,845
Because for me...

1685
01:29:07,132 --> 01:29:08,247
...I had a breakthrough.

1686
01:29:08,492 --> 01:29:12,451
I'm in a good place mentally,
and I'm feeling good about me.

1687
01:29:13,892 --> 01:29:15,120
I don't know, Paul.

1688
01:29:16,012 --> 01:29:19,766
I can see where some people
might have a problem with this.

1689
01:29:20,012 --> 01:29:20,842
I realize that.

1690
01:29:21,092 --> 01:29:22,730
So as a token of good faith...

1691
01:29:22,972 --> 01:29:25,167
...I've written down a few things...

1692
01:29:25,412 --> 01:29:27,801
...putting them in a safe-deposit
box in case...

1693
01:29:28,052 --> 01:29:30,805
...something should happen to me,
my friend or my family.

1694
01:29:38,372 --> 01:29:40,567
I don't know what
anybody else thinks...

1695
01:29:40,972 --> 01:29:43,281
...but I say good luck
and God bless, Paul.

1696
01:29:47,772 --> 01:29:49,808
Thank you. Come on, let's go.

1697
01:29:50,172 --> 01:29:51,890
I'm his friend.

1698
01:29:59,452 --> 01:30:01,522
That was remarkable.
Do you feel proud?

1699
01:30:01,772 --> 01:30:05,651
Some people in therapy never
have breakthroughs like you had.

1700
01:30:08,292 --> 01:30:09,566
I don't wanna do this.

1701
01:30:09,812 --> 01:30:13,566
Think this is a civil service job?
You can just quit and walk away?

1702
01:30:13,812 --> 01:30:15,370
What are you, fucking crazy?

1703
01:30:15,612 --> 01:30:17,045
Not anymore.

1704
01:30:17,372 --> 01:30:18,407
Tell me something.

1705
01:30:18,652 --> 01:30:21,689
You gonna stab me in the back like
I always knew you would?

1706
01:30:22,012 --> 01:30:23,764
No, I won't stab you in the back.

1707
01:30:24,292 --> 01:30:26,123
I want to see your face when I do it.

1708
01:30:27,372 --> 01:30:28,771
I don't think so.

1709
01:30:29,012 --> 01:30:29,808
Mo-Mo!

1710
01:30:31,172 --> 01:30:31,968
Bigs!

1711
01:30:32,652 --> 01:30:33,482
Eddie!

1712
01:30:37,092 --> 01:30:38,923
It's over, Primo.

1713
01:30:39,372 --> 01:30:41,283
Now get the fuck out of here.

1714
01:30:48,932 --> 01:30:51,162
Machine gun was a nice touch.
A little hostile.

1715
01:31:24,012 --> 01:31:25,331
Hands in the air!

1716
01:31:25,572 --> 01:31:27,085
Drop your weapons!

1717
01:31:27,332 --> 01:31:28,765
Do it now!

1718
01:31:40,092 --> 01:31:41,844
I got you! Get down!

1719
01:31:45,972 --> 01:31:48,167
Get out of the car!
Hands on top of the car!

1720
01:31:48,412 --> 01:31:51,370
One fucking move, I swear I'll
blow your fucking heart out!

1721
01:31:51,612 --> 01:31:54,126
Take a pill, RoboCop! Take a pill!

1722
01:31:55,932 --> 01:31:57,888
I can't believe this.
You took a bullet for me.

1723
01:31:58,132 --> 01:32:01,602
What doc would ever do that for his
patient? I'll never forget that.

1724
01:32:01,852 --> 01:32:03,080
You...!

1725
01:32:04,692 --> 01:32:05,761
I tripped.

1726
01:32:06,012 --> 01:32:08,765
You tripped! You tripped
over your unconscious.

1727
01:32:09,812 --> 01:32:13,248
Mr. Vitti, you have the right
to remain silent...

1728
01:32:16,772 --> 01:32:18,603
Today's my wedding day.

1729
01:32:29,412 --> 01:32:31,687
You got off easy.
Eighteen months is nothing.

1730
01:32:31,932 --> 01:32:34,605
They found Primo Sindone dead
in a field near La Guardia.

1731
01:32:34,852 --> 01:32:37,650
I heard. Don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with it.

1732
01:32:37,892 --> 01:32:41,726
A million guys from here to Canarsie
were looking to whack that bastard.

1733
01:32:41,972 --> 01:32:44,042
Good. I was just checking.

1734
01:32:44,572 --> 01:32:45,687
Don't worry.

1735
01:32:47,132 --> 01:32:50,249
You think we could keep going
with the private sessions up here?

1736
01:32:50,492 --> 01:32:51,925
You'd like to do that?

1737
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:56,002
I could arrange to come up on Saturdays.
Or we could do it by phone.

1738
01:32:56,252 --> 01:32:57,241
Phone appointments?

1739
01:32:57,492 --> 01:33:01,167
I do that when a patient's
out of town or in federal prison.

1740
01:33:07,452 --> 01:33:08,487
Thanks, Doc.

1741
01:33:16,572 --> 01:33:19,132
I never really got to
thank you properly...

1742
01:33:20,252 --> 01:33:21,241
...for curing me.

1743
01:33:22,652 --> 01:33:25,928
We don't say "cure." We say you had a
"corrective emotional experience."

1744
01:33:26,172 --> 01:33:27,366
Excuse me.

1745
01:33:28,732 --> 01:33:29,801
You're something, you.

1746
01:33:30,052 --> 01:33:32,486
Yes, you are. You are something.

1747
01:33:33,332 --> 01:33:34,651
No, you're something.

1748
01:33:35,812 --> 01:33:36,847
You!

1749
01:33:45,172 --> 01:33:46,241
Happy?

1750
01:33:46,772 --> 01:33:48,205
I just can't get used to it.

1751
01:33:48,452 --> 01:33:49,328
Used to what?

1752
01:33:49,572 --> 01:33:53,690
It's so long since you were last
kidnapped. I don't know if I can adjust.

1753
01:33:55,612 --> 01:33:56,408
Listen.

1754
01:33:57,452 --> 01:33:59,920
How about one more dance...

1755
01:34:00,492 --> 01:34:02,050
...and then we'll go upstairs?

1756
01:34:05,332 --> 01:34:07,641
Tony, can you do one more song?

1757
01:34:08,412 --> 01:34:09,561
Anything you want.

1758
01:34:10,292 --> 01:34:12,852
My friend told me to stay
as long as you needed me.

1759
01:34:13,092 --> 01:34:14,320
I don't want to let him down.

1760
01:34:14,572 --> 01:34:16,847
"World On A String,"
the Harold Arlen song.

1761
01:34:17,092 --> 01:34:18,525
This is so great.

1762
01:34:20,372 --> 01:34:21,964
This is a gift.

1763
01:34:22,972 --> 01:34:24,690
I've got the world on a string

1764
01:34:25,732 --> 01:34:27,768
I'm sitting on a rainbow

1765
01:34:28,932 --> 01:34:30,684
I've got the string

1766
01:34:30,932 --> 01:34:32,888
Around my finger

1767
01:34:35,132 --> 01:34:37,771
What a world
What a life

1768
01:34:39,372 --> 01:34:40,851
I'm in love

1769
01:35:58,412 --> 01:35:59,970
Good night, Sobels.
