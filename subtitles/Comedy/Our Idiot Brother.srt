00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:40,885
J' And yesterday's memories
still find me

156
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,527
- J' Scenes from the past
- I can't,..

157
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,757
J' Keep returning

158
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:56,871
J' I've got a wonderful future
behind me

159
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,135
[truck engine starts]

160
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,150
[dog whining]

161
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:19,127
J' You say them is happiness

162
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,495
J' Waiting for me

163
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,397
J' But I know... I

164
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:30,405
Hey, man, Janet's been trying
to rent out that old goat barn.

165
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,067
If you could get two months worth of
rent together, then maybe you could...

166
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,807
Seriously? Well,
what's she asking per month?

167
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,973
Well, she's been asking $400,

168
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,849
but for you, she'd probably
give it to you for $500.

169
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,252
You think she'd go for it?

170
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,450
You just worry about
getting that money together.

171
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,425
I'll take care of Janet.

172
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,856
Right on. Thanks, man.

173
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:00,696
[Ned] Hey, just remember,

174
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,670
Omega-3s for the blepharitis,
it helps with everything.

175
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,935
- [man] Thanks for the tip, Ned.
- [Ned] Thanks, Hauser.

176
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,546
You know what the worst part is? She's
insisting on keeping Willie Nelson.

177
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,010
- No!
- [all gasp] No, way!

178
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,117
I thought she was a Buddhist
or something,

179
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,446
I'm so sorry, I know
how much you love him.

180
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,315
- That sucks, Ned.
- Yeah, it's really tough,

181
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,616
but you know what I'm gonna do
is get some money together

182
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,522
and I'm gonna rent the goat barn
on the back 40, so...

183
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,459
The goat barn. Pff.
Better hurry up on that one.

184
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,395
- Yeah.
- How much you need for the goat barn?

185
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,560
I'm sure we could rustle up
some cash for you?

186
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:38,532
Um, I thought we agreed as a family
not to loan each other money.

187
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,904
Yeah, no, right, obviously.

188
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,637
Because then we would've blown through
Dylan's inheritance by now.

189
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:48,684
I just thought that it would be,
you know, better if Ned were to...

190
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,914
...earn it himself.

191
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,148
For Ned, yeah, for you.

192
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,157
Absolutely, no, for sure.
I'm not a charity case.

193
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,820
I wanna work, so if you hear of
anything, any odd jobs or anything,

194
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,330
please, let me know, because...

195
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,866
Maybe there's something
on your movie you could...

196
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,428
There wouldn't... No, no.

197
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,666
No. No, we're pretty well-staffed
at the moment.

198
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,332
Yeah, sorry, it's...

199
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,035
[Natalie] You know what you really need
is to get laid.

200
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,614
I have, like, live hot roommates,
a couple of them would totally fuck you.

201
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,512
- Definitely.
- Dude,

202
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,119
can we discuss living with
that many people at this age?

203
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,687
I mean, it's kind of gnarly.

204
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,688
Well, actually, we looked at
a two-bedroom in Brooklyn Heights.

205
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,690
- Right, Nat?
- For you two?

206
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,227
- That's awesome.
- Good! That's so exciting!

207
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,262
- Can I come check it out?
- Yeah, of course.

208
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,559
Contain your enthusiasm, Nat.

209
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,202
No, it's just...

210
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,305
I get worried, because...

211
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:45,068
...people who move in together
always end up either breaking up

212
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,801
or getting married.

213
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,376
- OK,
- No, no, no, no.

214
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,480
Why would you say that in front
of everybody? I don't understand.

215
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:55,813
[both whispering]

216
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,545
- Come here.
- OK.

217
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,788
[woman] Take a breath, Mom.

218
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,726
- Relax, take a breath.
- We have to go. Seth has a show.

219
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,662
- Yeah. Who's Seth?
- I have a deadline. I'm gonna go too.

220
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,496
What about cake? Aren't we
gonna play a game or something?

221
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,502
[Dylan] We should probably
get going as well.

222
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:18,074
Hey, sunshine, we gotta get home
and practice your shehnai,

223
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,565
You're right.

224
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,905
I'll cut you a slice, River,
you can take it with you.

225
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,571
Oh, no, he had a cupcake yesterday.

226
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,414
We're off sugar today.
Thanks, though, Ned,

227
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,986
[sister] Such a lucky kid,
gets a cupcake once a week.

228
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,623
So, I'll see you guys next week, OK?

229
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,850
- Bye, Mom!
- You guys really have to go so soon?

230
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,584
It's still light out.

231
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,922
I know, but I'm so psyched
to have you next week.

232
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,190
- Yeah, to next week! Bye, guys.
- [Natalie] Cindy!

233
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,096
- [Cindy] Coming, coming!
- [horn honks]

234
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,172
Our door is always open, Ned.

235
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,338
We'll see you next week, OK? Bye!

236
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,107
Bye!

237
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,975
You know, Nedly, I love you.

238
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,278
I love you too, Mom.

239
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:03,717
Even though you've never had a real job
and that problem with the jail business,

240
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,652
and you've never given me
any grandchildren.

241
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,715
Yeah, well...

242
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,292
Any plans for tomorrow?

243
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,855
I don't even know where to begin.

244
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,297
Then we'll drive over to Calico Corner,
I gotta get a new button.

245
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,631
- You need any?
- I'm OK.

246
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,138
Let's get an early start,
we'll beat the crowds.

247
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,004
OK.

248
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:31,310
[sighs] I'm glad you're staying here.

249
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,341
Nighty-night.

250
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,420
- Good night, Mom.
- Sleep tight.

251
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,853
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

252
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:49,930
[slowly] I'm... Officer...
Omar... Coleman.

253
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:56,264
I'm... your... parole." officer.

254
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,834
I'm Ned Rochlin.
Why are you talking so slow?

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,911
I just figured, looking at your sheet,

256
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,845
that since you sold grass
to a uniformed police officer

257
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,507
that you must be retarded.

258
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,553
- [laughs] Yeah, I get that a lot.
- Right.

259
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,782
You need a signed rental agreement
in your name

260
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,552
or written confirmation that
you're staying with a family member.

261
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:20,528
OK. Well, currently I'm staying with
my mom in Long Island. Although, I...

262
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,597
You're required to appear
before me every three weeks,

263
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,531
at which time you'll provide me
with a urine sample. You understand?

264
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,364
Oh, yes, sir, Your Honor.

265
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,734
State of New York requires you
to reflect upon the choices

266
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,432
that led to your incarceration.

267
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,034
- Cool.
- Cool.

268
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,773
Um, what steps are you taking to avoid
such choices in the future?

269
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,716
Uh... I'll tell you,
that's really tough...

270
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,411
,..tough for me, sir. I don't really...

271
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,153
Hmm. Hm.

272
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:54,260
Wow, that's a good question. I don't...
it's tough to answer right now.

273
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,229
I haven't thought about it
that much, but,

274
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,630
I don't know. I mean, I'm not
gonna be working at the farm anymore.

275
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,397
- OK.
- Although, you might not want to

276
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,905
write that one down, 'cause it's
not so much a step, per se.

277
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,304
Because it's not my choice.
I'd love to be working there,

278
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,675
but my girlfriend, Janet,
doesn't want it to happen really.

279
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,583
How about we put down you're staying
away from past criminal associates?

280
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,013
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Sure.

281
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,744
- If you think that's best.
- Yeah.

282
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,455
You know what? I'll think about it
and I'll try and come back next time

283
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:26,085
with some more steps and options, that
kind of thing, for our next meeting.

284
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,095
- You do that, buddy.
- This is cool, man.

285
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,995
- Yeah.
- This is like...

286
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,694
This is like free therapy.
New York State cares.

287
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,774
Is that it? That's it?

288
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,503
- That's it.
- My 50 minutes are up?

289
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,705
- Yeah.
- All right, man, OK.

290
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:45,872
- OK.
- Thanks a lot.

291
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,882
Hey, is it lame if I bail on Nat's show?

292
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,351
Yeah. Then no one will be there.

293
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,684
What the hell is that noise?

294
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:58,022
- Oh, that's River's shehnai.
- [croaking instrument sound]

295
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,790
You have no idea how competitive
admissions have gotten.

296
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,623
God, Ned just showed up.

297
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,136
- I'll call you back.
- All right, bye.

298
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,373
Hi.

299
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,309
- You said your door was always open.
- I did, yeah.

300
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,514
I hope this is OK, Ned.

301
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,584
Are you kidding? This is great.

302
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,725
My God, I get to rock
the full-on slumber party

303
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,917
with my man River every night.

304
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,358
I mean, Mom's great and all, but...

305
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,591
Oh. No, Ned, it's all right. I get it.

306
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,732
So, the deal is, if it's OK with you,

307
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:46,343
you'll get $250 a week,
you'll help us out with River,

308
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:50,606
and you get to work with Dylan
on the documentary.

309
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,011
Yeah, I hope you don't have to tire
anyone to make room for me, Dyl,

310
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,278
Oh, yeah, but it's family first, right?

311
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,418
You guys.

312
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,125

[both laughing]

318
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,895
So, you're telling me
you've never seen The Pink Panther?

319
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,826
Mom and Dad don't like violent movies.

320
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:43,092
Yeah, but it's not violent,
it's hilarious.

321
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,257
- Nobody's actually getting hurt.
- Mm-hmm,

322
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,160
Get on your feet. Come on, come here.

323
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,174
On your feet, River Rochlin Byng.

[karate greeting]

325
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,806
Welcome to my dojo.

326
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,602
Give me a chop.

327
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,149
- What was that?
- Karate chop.

328
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,255
That was a...'? That wasn't a chop.
You know what that was? That was this...

329
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,587
- Chop me. Do it.
- [laughs]

330
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,196
- How about this?
- Oh! Ah!

331
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,025
[laughing]

332
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,862
Christ! It's after 10:00, for Christ's
sakes, River has school in the morning.

333
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,768
Oh, God, sorry, yeah.
I must've lost track of time again.

334
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,670
Ned, what's the laptop
doing in his bedroom?

335
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,311
We were just watching Pink Panther.

336
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:33,048
We loaned you the computer for your
resume, not to look at pink panthers.

337
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,711
No, The Pink...
It's just Pink Panther

338
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:40,449
This country's obsessed with screens.

339
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,528
He's seven years-old,
for Christ's sakes.

- [crashing]
- Ahh.

341
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,323
Whoops.

342
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,704
- Good night, Riv.
- Good night.

343
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,502
[Natalie] I mean, he's not
like a criminal or anything,

344
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,168
he's just a fuck-up who needs help.

345
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,144
Well, if he's got any of your genes,
I'd be happy to throw him a few bucks

346
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,477
-to do a little modeling.
- That would be awesome.

347
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,052
Then he'd have cash
and somewhere to go.

348
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,589
Sure. Hey, have you heard
of Sustainable Upgrade?

349
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:19,393
Sustainable Upgrade,
it's a life-coaching program.

350
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,056
It saved me. I was like
your brother is now, floating.

[laughs]

352

Waiting for someone
to give me a sense of purpose.

353
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,765
Cool, I'll tell him.

354
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,275
Want to come to a meeting too?

355
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,172
- Mmm, I don't know.
- No.

356
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,837
You are capable
of extraordinary things, Natalie.

357
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,548
You just have to let yourself go there.

358
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,014
[laughs] it's not like a cult, is it?

359
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,850
Cult? [laughs] No.

360
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,017
No. I'll tell you what,
I'll take you both.

361
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,856
Just check it out, no pressure.

[classical piano music plays]

363
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,215
What we're doing is we're
filming this documentary movie

364
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,718
about Tatiana.

365
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:21,051
And all of the artistic repression
that she faced in Belorussia.

366
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:25,389
What I'd love to get from you guys would
be signatures on these releases.

367
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,156
Thank you.

- Jesus.

00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,571
Ah! [laughs]

00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:39,766
- Man...
- [woman] It hurts.

372
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,173
- [Ned] It does. It does, God!
- [woman] I know.

373
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,836
I think I need leg warmers.

- My Croc is stuck.
- Hey.

375
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,310
- Hey.
- Is this joker bothering you?

376
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,183
No, not at all, He's very cute.

377
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,914
He's pretty funny.

378
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,582
You wanna go grab the bags,
take them down to the car?

379
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,820
Sure, I told her
you're my brother-in-law.

380
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,622
She didn't know you were married.

- Oh.
- No.

382
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:06,459
You gotta look at this thing she can do
with her leg. This is amazing. Show him.

383
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,963
- Look at...!
- I've just been shooting this stuff.

384
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,370
But, hey, I never tire of it.

385
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,978
[laughs] Look at this. I can get it...
This is how high I can go.

[both laugh]

387
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,943
I know. You just did it
five seconds ago.

388
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,778
Oh, yeah. I didn't know if you saw it.

389

- Get your stinky feet off me.
- Stop tickling me!

[Ned] I'm not tickling you,
what are you talking about?

399
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:56,047
So has Nat always been a lesbian?

400
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,848
Oh, no, no, she's open
to pretty much anyone.

401

Boys, girls, old, young, thin, fat.

402
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,317
That's a beautiful thing, actually.

403
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,526
- That is beautiful.
- She even slept with our cousin once.

- [man] Dude! What the fuck!
- Sorry, sorry." to everybody.

00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,012
Man, can you hold this? Thanks.

406
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,465
Thanks, man. I feel like an idiot.
[laughs]

407
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,268
- You done yet?
- No, I still can't go.

408
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,375
[Omar] Gotta get that sample.

Hey, your two job's gonna look
good on my monthly stats.

410
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,538
I'm telling you, Omar,
good things happen.

411
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:01,150
- Good things happen.
- Yeah, I'll keep that in mind, Ned.

412
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,545
Oh, now if you're gonna move into that
barn residence you referred to,

413
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,419
you gotta register the address here
within three days of moving in.

414
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,991
Oh, yeah.

415
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,721
One more minute
or I'm getting the cranberry juice.

416
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,729
Nope, almost there.

417
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,967
There we go.

418
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,961
- Oh!
- [laughs]

419
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,901
Sorry, man, I shouldn't have gone
before I came here. I'm so stupid.

420
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,338
I don't know what I was thinking.

421
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,104
- That was funny, Ned.
- [laughs]

422
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,340
- Yeah.
- You,.. [laughs]

423
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,275
The car is now 35 minutes late.

424
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:40,754
If the driver knew there was traffic,
why didn't the driver call me then?

425
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:44,588
Yes, I know, but you see, I'm
interviewing a very important person,

426
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,094
in less than 20 minutes and I...

427
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,163
Don't...! [groans]

428
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,994
Jer, see if he's out there for me.

429
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,464
Yep.

430
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:56,771
This is a disaster, Jer.
I cannot be late for this.

431
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,970
- [sighs] Jesus Christ.
- No.

432
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:04,046
[groans] I can't believe
I'm calling this person.

433
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,705
Who is she exactly?

434
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,478
Lady Arabella Galloway,
heir presumptive to the House of Stuart,

435
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,643
one of the wealthiest women
in the world.

436
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,948
Jesus.

437
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:16,218
Yeah, her creepy ex-boyfriend stole
ten million dollars from the family,

438
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,521
and then sold their sex tape
to pay his legal bills,

439
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,392
He's a gem. OK, Ned,
you gotta do me a favor.

440
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,464
First of all, we need to step on it,
we're really late.

441
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,796
Next of all, maybe don't say
anything stupid.

442
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:30,202
Actually, don't say anything at all.
Just keep your mouth shut.

443
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,172
This is the first time I'm writing about
an actual person, not just moisturizer.

444
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,811
So I really can't fuck it up.

445
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,676
- Hi, Lady Arabella.
- Hi.

446
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,686
- Miranda Rochlin, Vanity Fair
- Nice to meet you.

447
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:50,486
So nice to meet you.
Here, just jump right in.

448
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,829
So sorry that we were late.
The town car was stuck in traffic,

449
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,159
-this is my sister's car, I had to...
- it's OK.

450
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,198
- OK. I feel horrible.
- No, it's lovely to meet you.

451
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:01,099
- Thank you, you too.
- Hi, I'm Arabella.

452
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,866
You can introduce yourself, Ned.

453
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,172
Oh, yes. I'm Ned.

454
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,677
- I'm her brother.
- Yeah, he's just my brother.

455
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,509
That's... that's all.

456
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,082
So, are you two a team?

457
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,345
Us? No. Hm-mm. No.

458
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,420
I'm just kind of doing this
as an odd job,

459
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,751
- Yeah.
- Been out of the workforce for a while.

460
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,895
- Really? Where were you?
- Oh, I was sort of in jail.

461
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,088
Oh. He's not a..,
He's not a criminal or anything,

462
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,257
he's just an organic farmer
that made a stupid mistake. So...

463
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,029
- Well, biodynamic, actually.
- OK, Ned.

464
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:37,197
What is biodynamic, exactly?
I've never understood the difference.

465
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,467
Planting kind of depends
on the lunar calendar.

466
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,702
- Species of lettuce, for example...
- Thank you, Ned.

467
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:44,108
Arabella?
I was thinking we should get started.

468
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:49,719
OK, my lawyer said you agreed not to ask
about him and the whole YouTube thing,

469
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,716
Absolutely, yeah.
Everybody's dated a jerk,

470
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:56,883
so at the end of the day,
that is just an old, boring story.

471
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,460
- OK. Good.
- Yeah.

472
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:05,296
No, what I'm truly fascinated by is the
work you are doing with Destiny's House.

473
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,995
[Arabella] it's the same story
for all of them.

474
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,903
Seduced at 13 or 14 by grown men
who make them feel loved

475
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:14,840
and then brainwash them
into prostitution.

476
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,512
- So sad.
- Yeah,

477
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,616
Well, I guess we're all capable
of trusting the wrong person.

478
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,580
Are you speaking
from personal experience?

479
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,586
Hey, Ebony, thank you for the playlist.

480
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,418
- Love Major Lazer.
- [girl] No problem.

481
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,083
[Arabella] And then there's
Shanequa, she got really into boxing.

482
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,753
Not just like boxing matches,
more like Tight training.

483
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,921
- Shanequa?
- [Ned] Yeah, you know my nephew River

484
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:40,093
wants to do something like that, but Liz
won't have anything to do with it.

485
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,671
- Is that the lesbian sister?
- [Ned] That's Nat,

486
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,866
She's really more of a bisexual.
Or at least formerly-bisexual.

487
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:50,104
I don't know how you describe it.
How would you describe Nat?

488
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,172
- Arabella, I was wondering...
- [Arabella] If you guys are interested,

489
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,215
you should come to the benefit
we're having on Sunday,

490
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,615
- Benefit? Oh, yeah!
- The girls will be there.

491
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,052
That could be great.

492
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:03,056
- I do have this deadline, though.
- [laughs] Man, I love it.

493
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:06,389
One minute I'm scrubbing toilets at
Marble Valley Regional with Dom,

494
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:08,793
cut to: I'm on the charity circuit.

495
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,362
- [Ned sipping] Mm.
- [Arabella] It's good, right?

496
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,561
- [woman] Are you convinced?
- Nice, nice.

497
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,036
Way to tell it true, yeah.

498
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,176
Anybody else? How about you? Beth?

499
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,208
Share your story.

500
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:22,834
Sure.

501
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:27,740
Hi, everyone, my name is Beth Phillips

502
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,216
and I'm from Paramus, New Jersey.

503
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,912
- Hey, Beth.
- [Beth laughs]

504
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:36,252
[Beth] Uh, I used to call myself
a romance addict.

505
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:39,021
And then, I went in the win room.

506
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:44,331
And came out knowing I just used sex
to make me feel like I was in control.

507
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:49,867
But now, I'm engaged to marry a man
who actually loves me.

508
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,738
He's so awesome.
He just knit me a scarf.

509
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,207
[applause]

510
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,938
[woman] Isn't that a beautiful
testimony?

511
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,679
Let's go to the win room.

512
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:05,087
[Natalie] So now, um,
I'm in my crib and...

513
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:10,556
...this time my sister's
not strangling me.

514
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,556
She's hugging me and...

515
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,295
l feel so positive
and, like, really, like, clear.

516
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:20,062
Like I can do anything.

517
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,195
- Yes, you can. You can do anything.
- [applause]

518
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:24,966
That's a great win, Natalie.

519
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,303
- Yeah.
- [man] It was beautiful.

520
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:28,968
Hydrate.

521
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:37,710
What about you, Ned?
What are you feeling?

522
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:39,918
Uhh.,.

523
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,383
I just... I feel really hot.

524
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,457
Right. Do you want to expand on that?

525
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,059
All I want is to take that pitcher
and just dump it

526
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,726
onto my penis and balls.

527
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:59,400
Move on through it. Come away from the
testicles and up to your higher self.

528
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,101
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Don't throw up in this tent.

529
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,974
Can I please have water without win?

530
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,015
Without a win? Can I please have water
without a win? Can you give me some?

531
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,812
Don't enable him. Don't...

532
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,346
Ned?

533
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:15,282
- I'm fine, really.
- You're gonna be fine, man.

534
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:18,917
- We just gotta take you in, all right?
- Are you sure I can't come? I want to.

535
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:22,361
No, no, really. I'm fine. I promise.
You kids enjoy yourseives.

536
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,933
And, seriously,
congratulations on your wins.

537
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,299
I love you, Ned, bye.

538
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,471
[sirens wails]

539
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:53,494
[moaning]

540
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,130
Cite Ohio v. McNally, Doug.

541
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,137
Oliver Wendell Holmes 101.

542
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,174
[laughs]

543
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,678
Yeah, I'll be in in about 40 minutes.
We can talk about it then. OK.

544
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:18,578
- You're so smart.
- Thanks, baby.

545
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,719
- You really have to go?
- Yeah. I do.

546
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,229
[car horns honking]

547
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,575
OK...

548
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,913
You know, Ned... Uh...

549
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,244
...maybe you should wait here. I've got
to do an interview with Tatiana,

550
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,217
- which could be a little sensitive.
- Really, how so?

551
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,350
Well, it's too sensitive, you know,
even to discuss.

552
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:57,460
- Wow.
- Why don't you chill out in the car,

553
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:02,031
- while I go and do it.
- Yeah.

554
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,861
- Do you need any help?
- No, just chill out in the car.

555
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,468
All right.

556
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,607
[siren wails]

557
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,251
Come on.

558
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,822
How we doing this evening?

559
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:30,391
Good. Good. Everything's great, officer.

560
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,994
I'm on parole.

561
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,596
- Any trouble here?
- No, no trouble at all.

562
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:39,225
My brother-in-law's doing a documentary
up in the building up there,

563
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,064
and I'm just...

564
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:44,002
This is my job, to watch this.

565
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,664
No trouble, we're not breaking the law.

566
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,833
You're in a 24-hour tow zone.

567
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:51,071
You gotta move this vehicle,
tow truck's behind me.

568
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:54,080
Well, all right.
Thank you for your service.

569
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,016
Ahh.

570
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,925
Just gotta get the keys!

571
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,031
Dylan! Dylan!

572
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,931
- Dylan!
- [gasping]

573
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,772
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

574
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,278
I'm sorry,
I just really need the car keys.

575
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:27,178
I told you never
to interrupt me when I'm working.

576
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,286
Yeah, sorry about that, man.
I need the keys, we're gonna get towed.

577
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:33,446
Wait, wait, wait. Why are they towing
the car? What the fuck did you do?!

578
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:37,287
-I didn't do anything.
- That was your one responsibility, Ned.

579
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,793
Your one responsibility!

580
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,736
Hey, Tatiana. Sorry!

581
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,710
[bicycle bell ringing]

582
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:08,389
- Ned, interviewing is an art form.
- [car starts]

583
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:13,018
When you ask someone to be vulnerable
or naked, you have to be naked too,

584
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,824
to make them feel comfortable.

585
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,024
- That make sense?
- Yeah, I guess.

586
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,668
Great.

587
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:25,000
- This piece is about Destiny's House.
- [sighs]

588
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,336
We need more details about her.

589
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,445
- This woman's been through a lot.
- I know.

590
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,775
Robbie, we agreed
with the publicist not to go there.

591
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:35,282
The publicist
is not writing this, Miranda.

592
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,851
You are.

593
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:40,512
Your job is to break through to her,
get her to show a little leg.

594
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,717
- Come on, you're so charming.
- I know.

595
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:46,885
You begged me
to get you this assignment.

596
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,693
You want to get your first story killed?

597
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:53,692
[sighs]

598
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,073
it's just getting to be too much.

599
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,437
River's interview is in three days time.
I want him to be...

600
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,207
...enigmatic, erudite,
wise, incandescent.

601
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:09,985
I can't just kick him out.
I'll talk to him.

602
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,953
What, you just decided unilaterally?

603
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,114
No, it's just he's family, Dylan.

604
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,228
I can't just turn my back
on him for no reason.

605
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:26,597
Well, can't one of you just take him,
please? He's driving Dylan crazy.

606
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:29,500
No, all we have is that storage room
and Dan's friends from the Ukraine

607
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,732
are staying there.
There's, like, six of them.

608
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:35,173
I can't do it. I've got a crazy
deadline, I really need to focus.

609
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,610
OK, well, thank you guys for your help.

610
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,011
I need to find you.

611
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:43,909
Cato!

612
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,577
[grunting]

613
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,752
What? Where did you go?

614
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:16,315
- Hiya!
- [River screaming]

615
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,351
[thumping]

616
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,883
So, River, I like your name.

617
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,890
It's better than Echo.

618
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:26,655
- Echo?
- That's my sister.

619
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:29,723
River was conceived in India,
near the Ganges.

620
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,394
So what kind of things
do you like to do, River?

621
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,975
- Fighting.
- Fighting?

622
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:44,511
- [laughs] What kind of fighting?
- Kun Gek Do.

623
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,916
River, why don't you tell Judith
about the shehnai?

624
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,748
He's very, very good, actually.

625
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,220
- When his hand has healed...
- Kun Gek Do.

626
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:58,054
I've never heard of that one before.
Tell me about that.

627
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,323
It's totally cool. Some of the moves
are just like Taekwondo.

628
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,228
You know, kicking... [shouts]

629
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,062
,Hand chopping. [shouting]

630
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:11,071
What's special about it is that the guys
can also throw and choke you..,

631
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,073
- [Dylan] Whoa!
- [Liz] That's enough! I'm so sorry.

632
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,441
Seriously, I have no idea
what he's talking about.

633
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,173
Oh, God! [laughs]

634
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,841
Riv, where'd you learn about this?

635
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,853
- Uncle Ned and I found it on YouTube.
- YouTube? What?

636
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:30,515
- Ned's so funny.
- Tell me about Uncle Ned.

637
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:32,525
He just got out of jail.

638
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:36,029
In Japan, for protesting about whales...

639
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,360
,..like the slaughter of whales.

640
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:41,026
I thought you said
he sold drugs to a policeman?

641
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,297
- Oh.
- [sighs]

642
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:48,305
None of this would be possible
if it wasn't for this amazing woman,

643
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:52,539
Rachel, who is a personal hero
to all of us girls.

644
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:55,207
[applause]

645
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,559
An right!

646
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,252
It's lovely to see you, Thank you.

647
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,660
- Arabella, hi! That was amazing.
- Thank you, Miranda.

648
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:12,062
And you look great.
Whose dress are you wearing?

649
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,500
- Mine.
- You're so clever.

650
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,504
- Thanks for coming.
- Seriously, though, I'd love to know...

651
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:21,576
[sighs]

652
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,236
I don't understand.
So this cop, he just came up

653
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,848
- and he had the hat, the badge...
- Yeah.

654
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,849
Well, no, he didn't have a hat.
I just thought he was, like, you know...

655
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,919
..."Brother, help a brother out,"
you know?

656
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,578
- I don't even...
- [laughing]

657
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,688
- You're laughing at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.

658
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:39,920
- You're totally laughing.
- I'm laughing at the story, not you.

659
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:43,190
[chuckles] Here's the thing, I...

660
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,265
I live my life a certain way.

661
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:49,462
And that is that I like to think that
if you put your trust out there,

662
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,766
I mean, if you really...

663
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,774
,..give people the benefit of the doubt,
see their best intentions,

664
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,776
they're gonna want to live up to it.

665
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,381
It doesn't always work out, clearly.

666
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,442
But, more often than not,
I think that if you do,

667
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:06,885
people will rise to the occasion.
I really believe that.

668
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,854
It's very sweet, Ned.

669
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,856
You think I'm an idiot
like everybody else.

670
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,323
No, I don't think you're an idiot.

671
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:16,226
I think that's a really good way
to live your life.

672
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,800
I mean, I'm the same.
At least, I was, yeah.

673
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,302
Until I met the fucking Chilean.

674
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,871
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

675
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:26,906
What happened?

676
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,407
[elevator dings]

677
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:34,810
So, I mean, I didn't stab him,
I just was trying to scare him.

678
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,850
You must think I'm a total psychopath.

679
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,988
I think you're fucking awesome.

680
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,681
I do. Hey, you wanna
go out with me sometime?

681
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:48,487
Oh. No, not really. But thanks for
asking. That's really sweet.

682
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,062
[Liz] You should have seen him, Ned.

683
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,329
He was flying around the room
like a maniac.

684
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,030
I mean, Kum Kak Do,
is that what it's called?

685
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,573
- Kun Gek Do.
- What?

686
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,901
- Kun Gek Do,
- What were you thinking?

687
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,776
Liz, every time he sees
those boys doing karate in class,

688
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,508
you should see the look on his face.

689
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,448
He so badly wants to be there.

690
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,280
Dylan and I aren't interested
in those values, Ned.

691
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:16,223
Sorry.

692
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,727
You know, he's just a little boy.

693
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,892
Little boys tight.

694
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:28,629
Doesn't mean he's going to grow up
to be a frat-boy rapist.

695
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:35,366
I'm sorry.

696
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,603
- Bye.
- Bye.

697
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:57,564
Here, Ned, It's just a little something.

698
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,595
Look, I know you tried.

699
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,762
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

700
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,307
No, no, no, I am.

701
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,443
Wait, what?

702
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,739
How much more do you need to move back
to that sheep farm, or whatever?

703
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,109
Three hundred.

704
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,849
- Oh, yeah, Ned.
- Oh, my God, are you...? Miranda.

705
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:25,591
- Here you go, there's $300. Go home.
- Wait, Miranda.

706
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,163
- Thank you so much.
- OK, I love that she paid you off,

707
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,596
but not, like, the full amount. [laughs]

708
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:35,203
Well, you know, she has her own way
of doing things.

709
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,532
They both do, I mean...

710
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,766
Hey, you wanna hear something weird?

711
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,775
Do you know that Dylan
shoots in the nude?

712
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,470
What? That's.,. disgusting.

713
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,616
Well, I mean, not all the time,
just certain situations.

714
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:50,616
Like, if Tatiana's nude,
then he has to be nude.

715
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:54,222
- It makes her feel more comfortable.
- Why is Tatiana naked?

716
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,949
Why is anybody naked?

717
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:59,459
It's to shoot her scars of oppression,
or something,

718
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,564
Oh, please. He's fucking her.

719
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,992
[sighs] Man, I had a feeling about that.

720
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,570
God, I just didn't want to believe it!

721
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,674
- [gasps]
- I mean, all those humanitarian awards.

722
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,300
I've got to call Nat. [gasps] Whoa!

723
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:20,146
Hey, Dune's on Showtime,
directors cut. You want...'?

724
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,147
- Hey.
- Hey, hi.

725
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,753
Sorry, didn't know you... had company.

726
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,083
- No, he's nobody.
- If you're busy...

727
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:29,884
That's my brother, Ned.

728
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,085
- Oh, this is Ned?
- Yeah.

729
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,730
- Ned! Hey!
- Jeremy, Ned. Ned, Jeremy.

730
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,492
- Hey, man, Jeremy. Nice to meet you.
- How's it going? Nice to meet you.

731
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,328
You, too, Jeremy.
I'll watch Dune with you.

732
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,094
- Yeah? Me too.
- I love that movie.

733
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:45,607
"Father, the sleeper has awakened!"

734
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,436
You don't have to throw yourself
at him, Ned.

735
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,838
"Father!"

736
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,503
Hey, by the way, thanks for going
with Miranda to that benefit.

737
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,343
- She always makes me do that shit.
- Oh, hey, man, it's all good.

738
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:58,180
Jeremy Ends it a burden to shave,
but he loves free food.

739
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,084
- That's true.
- [Ned] I had a great time, actually.

740
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,249
I tell you, that Arabella
she is one cool chick.

741
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,022
She's so pretty and so smart
and funny and strong.

742
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:11,963
My God, after everything she's been
through. All the humiliation with

743
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:15,627
-the South American guy, stabbing...
- Nat, oh, my God. Guess... Wait.

744
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,774
Hey, Miranda, do you have
any toothpaste 1 can borrow?

745
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,876
I'll call you back.
Ned, what did you just say?

746
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:23,034
I said, "Do you have
any toothpaste I can borrow?“

747
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:26,375
No, no, no. Arabella and a stabbing?

748
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,141
What did she tell you?

749
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:30,547
Oh, I don't know. It's kind of private.

750
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,314
- Ned, who just gave you $3007
- You.

751
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:36,049
Yeah. Plus, I feel like you
just wanted to tell us.

752
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:39,161
You were basically just practically
telling us the whole story.

753
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,263
Come on, Ned, spit it out.

754
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,996
Come on, Ned.

755
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:49,002
She was in South America, there was
a stabbing, just give us the rest of it.

756
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:03,243
[quacking]

757
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,750
[clucking]

758

- Yeah.

00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:15,591
Ned, why would I want a past lover
living in my backyard?

761
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,755
Billy said that you'd be cool with it.

762
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:21,096
Oh, fuck, man,
I totally forgot to ask her.

763
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:23,535
That's my bad, man, all the way.

764
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:27,633
I understand. Look, you won't
even notice that I'm here.

765
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,779
Ned, I'm so sorry,
it's not gonna happen.

- [barking]
- [Janet] Whoa.

768
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:37,617
- Put Willie Nelson back in the house!
- What?

769
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,684
[Billy] Janet said no.

770
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:43,891
Sorry, man.

771
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,692
- Come on, Willie Nelson.
- You're not gonna let me see him?

772
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,800
You know what, I was hoping
I wouldn't have to say this,

773
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:54,061
but I don't think you've
given me any other choice.

774
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:58,964
How many times did you make me throw
Willie Nelson outside in the cold

775
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,134
because you didn't want
mud tracked in the house, huh?

776
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,873
How many times did you insult him
by telling him he had had breath?

777
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,382
Whoa, man, do you understand
that you come here to this farm,

778
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,987
you put Willie Nelson
in the middle of all your bullshit,

779
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,090
and you traumatize him.
Is that what you want?

780
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:17,658
Why can't you just let him live
with someone who loves him?

781
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,692
Stop with the violence, man!

782
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,430
- You made me raise my voice.
- [softly] Sorry.

783
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:25,534
I'm feel really affronted right now,
man, on my own property.

784
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,431
Get your book bag, get out of here.

You know what, you know what? Wow.

there's some son of official action

that you can file? I mean...

792
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:04,297
I don't know. I don't want
to sound conceited or anything,

but I really am the better caregiver.

You can sue her, but I'm not gonna let
that hippie bitch put you through that.

You don't think we have a case?

796
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:15,146
I mean, she's splitting hairs
when she says

797
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:17,217
it was her friend Tim
that left him with us.

798

Look, you have a case,
but you don't need one.

That dog is yours and you're gonna go
back there and you're gonna get him.

I don't think I can ask her again, Cin.

No, no, no, Ned.

802

We're not gonna ask, we're gonna take.

Yes, say it. Who's the man?

- No, say it.. "I'm the man."

I can't do it.

- Ned.

doesn't mean you're homophobic.

- [Ned] Hm! She seems kind of fun.
- Yeah, sex would be awesome,

846
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,490
but then she'd make you
go to rock shows.

- Really?

they're gonna analyze every word

00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,113
[Ned] I like the name Lindsay.

856
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,809
[Jeremy] But they're both named Lindsay.

857
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:41,479
Look what she's reading, it's like
a novelization of Us Weekly.

[Ned] Ooh, look at that one.
Look at that girl.

860
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:46,785
[Jeremy] Oh, yeah, that would be great,
if you wanted, you know,

861
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,521
to date your sister!

862
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:51,462
- What's wrong with my sister?
- Nothing's wrong with your sister.

863
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:53,932
Why, you wanna date your sister?
You're a wild man.

00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:56,594
No, I don't wanna date my sister.
But what about you?

865
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,272
- Me? Date your sister?
- Yeah. Right.

866
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,876
Miranda? What are you talking about?

867
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,273
- Well, it's obvious.
- What's obvious?

868
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,472
That you guys totally love each other.

869
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:09,448
OK, I love Miranda, but...

870
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:11,450
- I know.
- ...she's bossy.

871
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,714
- [laughs] Yeah. She is.
- She's a bossy person.

872
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:17,792
She's like, "Jeremy, help me move
everything in my apartment around?

873
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,825
You know, it'll only take two minutes."
And then it's like...

874
00:50:19,984 --> 00:50:21,520
- [laughs]
- ...all day.

875
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,666
I mean, she's great, she's pretty,
she's very pretty,

876
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:28,395
that's undeniable,
but relationship-wise and...

877
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,906
...pardon me, but sexually,
I don't know if I could deal with it.

878
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:36,044
[sighs] Every man I meet
is either a dick or a loser.

879
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,875
What about Jeremy() He's not a dick.
And he's not a loser, either.

880
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,007
Well, that's debatable,
he doesn't even have health insurance.

881
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,551
Neither do I,
at least I don't think I do.

882
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,885
- [man] Here you go.
- I just want to meet a real man, Ned.

883
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,652
I asked for that side-by-side,
not swirled. Thanks.

884
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:52,816
- [man] Sure.
- Whatever.

885
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,691
I mean you two are obviously
not headed in that direction.

886
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:58,424
He thinks the idea
is as ludicrous as you do.

887
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:01,195
Hey, man, can I try some acai berry?

888
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,929
- [man] Yeah.
- Wait, wait. I'm sorry, what?

889
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,166
- Why is that?
-I don't know, I don't know.

890
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:09,607
What he said, it didn't make any sense.

891
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:12,338
Why are we even talking about this?
Tell me what he said, Ned.

892
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,013
He said you can be a tad bossy.

893
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,284
[laughs]

894
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:21,013
And you're not really his type,
physically. That was it, but...

895
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,749
- Wait, what?
- Hey, man, how's pomegranate?

896
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,360
- [man] it's terrific.
- Why, because I'm not 14?

897
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:28,121
- [man] How's that?
- [laughing]

898
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:30,060
Ned, tell me exactly what he said.

899
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,200
- God, do I have to?
- Yes.

- [Miranda] So, where's Dylan today?
- [Liz] He had to work.

904
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:11,764
He's been so edgy and... distant.

905
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,418
[sighs] Liz?

906
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,415
Yeah?

907
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:28,418
I think Dylan's having an affair.

908
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:31,348
[laughs] What?

909
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,760
- What are you talking about?
- Ned told me.

910
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,263
Oh, yeah, GK, Ned. [scoffs]

911
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:39,992
Let's face it, I mean...

912
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,036
OK, Ned told me the facts.
I had to put it together.

913
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:47,607
He said that Dylan
was spending a lot of private time...

914
00:52:48,432 --> 00:52:51,038
,..with the woman in his film, Tatiana.

915
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:55,709
- Tatiana, she's...
- Naked.

916
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,452
Maybe it was some, like,
dance experiment or...

917
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:03,216
[Miranda] Liz...

918
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:12,491
- Do popcorn, Uncle Ned.
- In a minute, buddy.

919
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,636
You sure she's gonna be at that concert?

920
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:17,966
Yeah, she hasn't missed
a Dixie Chicks show in... ten years.

921
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,699
And you're sure that she's
gonna leave Willie Nelson behind?

922
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,674
According to Billy, she hasn't
taken him on an outing in months.

923
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:26,041
- Poor guy.
- She's such a dick.

924
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,046
- [River] Come on, Uncle Ned.
- All right, Riv, let's go.

925
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,309
On your back.

926
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,884
- [River laughing]
- [Ned] Ah!

927
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,047
Yeah!

928
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:39,724
Yeah, baby!

929
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,888
[Miranda] His whole "I'm saving the
world" thing, it was bullshit, right?

930
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,591
- We always knew it. Fuck him.
- Yeah, fuck him.

931
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:48,828
And his tittle Russian
ballerina bitch.

932
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:52,371
This is the man I built my life with,
what do you expect?

933
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,510
That I just... throw it all away
or something?

934
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,907
- No. I don't know.
- Maybe.

935
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,547
Damn Ned!

936
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:02,948
- I never should have let him stay.
- This is not Ned's fault.

937
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:05,018
Everything was going fine
until he arrived.

938
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,918
- [Miranda] How is this Ned's fault?
- A family is a very precarious thing.

939
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,685
You guys will see
when you get it together.

940
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:13,590
[weeping]

941
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:17,028
OK, Liz, look.

942
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,689
Don't take this the wrong way,

943
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:22,531
because Dylan is totally
the asshole in this situation for sure.

944
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:25,299
- He's a douchebag.
- I hate his guts. But...

945
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,442
...is it possible that...

946
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:30,809
...you know, maybe he
thought you gave up?

947
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,380
Gave up on what?

948
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:36,249
You're, you know, this whole...

949
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:41,720
You used to be so hot, Liz. I remember
all my friends lusting after you.

950
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:44,052
- They thought you were awesome.
- Yes! You had the great boobs,

951
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,558
- and you were always tall and...
- You're still tall.

952
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:50,221
- Yeah.
- Well, what's wrong with me now?

953
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,234
[Miranda] Well, come on...

954
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:57,099
Liz, I mean, look. I don't know.
What's going on with your hair here?

955
00:54:57,261 --> 00:54:59,571
It's like a science experiment
back there.

956
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:03,601
And I know you own contacts.
You're wearing plastic shoes,

957
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,940
and what is this shirt even made of?

958
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:09,816
- It's flax.
- See? I mean, isn't that a food?

959
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,453
- You're wearing food.
- What are you saying?

960
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:15,488
- If only I looked more like you?
- What? No.

961
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:21,096
Got my hair styled every day and wore
absurd heels that no one can walk in,

962
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:24,095
that maybe my husband wouldn't
be screwing around on me-'?!

963
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,962
I'm just trying to help!
OK, Liz? That's all!

964
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:29,195
I hardly think you're in a position
to give man advice!

965
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,600
Jesus Christ, you guys,
all Miranda's saying is just,

966
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,003
like, maybe it would be cool
if you just, like,

967
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,768
looked semi-fuckable once in a while.

968
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:37,810
- Thank you!
- Oh, God!

969
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:40,107
I mean, how long has it been
since you've had sex?

970
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,547
I don't know! Echo's Eve months,
so, you know...

971
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,516
- Plus nine, it's like...
- What?!

972
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,451
- Plus nine?!
- Are you kidding me?

973
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:51,491
That's, like, over a year!
How can people live like that? That's...

974
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,286
I am different from you.

975
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,624
I have other things to do than
worry about getting my rocks off.

976
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,495
[scoffs] What is that supposed to mean?
You think I'm sleeping around?

977
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,795
- I'm not sleeping around!
- Nobody thinks that.

978
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:03,905
- I didn't say that.
- I love Cindy.

979
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:07,372
- This isn't about you, Nat!
- it's just seduction is your thing,

980
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,068
- your means to self-esteem.
- Ohh!

981
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:12,475
- I don't care!
- Screw you and screw you!

982
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:15,515
What did I do? Nat!
What is up your ass?!

983
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,220
Babe, you OK?

984
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:25,056
- You're all sweaty.
- Babe.

985
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:29,323
[Ned] They just dump everything on it,
sprinkles and like Oreos.

986
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:34,026
- What about sunflower seeds?
- They're actually good.

987
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:35,329
- They're good?
- Yeah.

988
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:36,493
- What about...
- [crying] River, come on.

989
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,832
Sweetie, come on.

990
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:40,407
Come on, it's time to go, come on.
[sniffles]

991
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:41,907
Come on.

992
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,204
- See ya, buddy.
- See ya.

993
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,877
Hey, Riv, check it out.

994
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:50,009
[laughing]

995
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:52,175
Grow the hell up, Ned.

996
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:00,591
[elevator dings]

997
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:07,059
Hey, read it last night.
Quite the story.

998
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:10,361
PR thinks it's gonna get you
on a bunch of talk shows.

999
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,539
[Miranda]
Oh, now you're Mn Moral High Ground?

1000
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:16,803
[Jeremy] No, I didn't say anything.

1001
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:21,109
I love my brother, but let's be honest,
he doesn't live in the adult world.

1002
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,083
Oh, but your story's adult
with all the gory details

1003
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:28,951
- and bitching aside?
- Sometimes in the adult world

1004
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,956
we have to do things that,
you know, we're not very pro...

1005
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,220
Let's just drop it,
because you wouldn't understand.

1006
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,887
I wouldn't understand?
Why wouldn't I understand?

1007
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:39,000
Why, because I'm an unpublished
sci-fi writer?

1008
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:42,467
- What? Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, no, that's not it. That's not it.

1009
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:46,005
It's because I don't have health
insurance. That's what it was.

1010
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:49,667
- Did Ned...? I'm gonna murder him.
- I don't know how I found that out.

1011
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,575
- He's...
- Are you helping at all?

1012
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:54,738
- I'm guiding it.
- You're guiding it?

1013
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:58,182
- Someone has to guide...
- Let go. You weren't doing anything.

1014
00:57:58,342 --> 00:58:01,186
- That's what he said?
- [Miranda] Hey, Ned!

1015
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:04,519
Really? You had to go and tell Jeremy
about that little stupid thing l said

1016
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:07,321
about the health insurance?
Why are you such a blabbermouth?

1017
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,431
Is that my brush? Ew!
What are you doing?

1018
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:11,793
I don't wanna know.

1019
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:13,093
Uh...

1020
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:16,965
I'm surprised that you even asked
my opinion on your work,

1021
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:20,597
since," Wait, I'm not even a grown-up?
Is that what it was?

1022
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:22,334
Ned! That...

1023
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,207
OK, what you don't understand
is that my brother is a retard.

1024
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:26,439
- [Jeremy] Oh, OK.
- That's true,

1025
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:27,707
[Miranda] See? Thank you.

1026
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:31,114
No, I mean, she didn't say that at all.

1027
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,276
What she was that
you're not like a real man.

1028
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,213
- Ned! Wait!
- That's much better.

1029
00:58:35,379 --> 00:58:37,620
- No...
- That's great. Thank you, Miranda.

1030
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:40,455
Oh, no, no, no, no! This is just...

1031
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:42,688
This is just a breakdown
of communication.

1032
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,527
- Obviously. Really nice, Miranda.
- Don't try to make me feel bad

1033
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:49,398
about any of this when, according
to you, I'm... What was it, Ned?

1034
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:52,130
- ...hideously ugly.
- What?

1035
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:53,740
- Yeah.
- I didn't say that.

1036
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,740
Miranda, I would never
say that about you.

1037
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:59,073
- He so didn't say that about you.
- Thank you, tell her I didn't say that.

1038
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:02,547
He said your personality gets in the way
of your looks, your very good looks.

1039
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,380
Dude... do you have Tourettes?

1040
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,647
- What the fuck?
- Wow.

1041
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:09,313
This is much worse
than I thought it was.

1042
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,982
- I didn't say that.
- I don't even know why I care.

1043
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:14,993
Because the idea of the two of you
sitting around, talking about girls,

1044
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:17,257
is so pathetic, it's almost funny.

1045
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:18,764
It's almost funny?

1046
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,367
I don't see you laughing right now.

1047
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:23,004
It doesn't seem like
you think it's funny at all.

1048
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:27,073
OK, um, he-re's your story.

1049
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,677
Thank you for letting me read
your wonderful article.

1050
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:33,509
Hope you sleep well. Ned, you might
wanna take a look at that.

1051
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,546
- See you later.
- Jer.

1052
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:39,882
- Give me that, Ned!
- [door slams]

1053
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:41,522
[sighs]

1054
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:45,850
Keep your mouth shut, Ned,
just keep it shut!

1055
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:47,689
- Sorry.
- He's like my best friend.

1056
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:49,956
- Thanks a lot!
- I'm sorry.

1057
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,727
This is like in prison
when I told Bob about Jose.

1058
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:56,795
I'm pretty sure it's nothing like that.

1059
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,534
I mean, is there anything
more bothersome than a mom cliche?

1060
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,700
Mom's heart is in the right place.

1061
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:05,039
- Mom means well.
- [chuckles]

1062
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:09,708
Or, the crowning glory
of terrible mom clichés...

1063
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,554
I mean...

1064
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:16,717
Um...

1065
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:20,128
I'm gonna be...

1066
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:24,156
,..right back.

1067
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,470
[Natalie] what?

1068
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,441
Nat, are you all right?

1069
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:42,974
Are you sick?

1070
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,916
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

1071
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:56,155
Oh, my God, that...!
Congratulations, man!

1072
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,458
That's so awesome for you guys.

1073
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:01,194
God, what do I fucking do?

1074
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,767
Well... this sounds weird,

1075
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:07,101
but do you think you're not as much
of a lesbian as you thought?

1076
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:12,009
No! No, it was just a thing.
God, I fucking love Cindy.

1077
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:15,147
You know." just tell her the truth.

1078
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,445
She loves you.
Maybe she'll be psyched to have a kid.

1079
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,315
What? Yeah,
she's gonna be really psyched.

1080
01:01:20,477 --> 01:01:24,050
She's gonna come with me to pick out
a fucking changing table. Come on!

1081
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:27,457
I cheated on her, I got pregnant,
she should be pissed.

1082
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,392
I don't wanna fuck it up with her, Ned.

1083
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:31,294
If she loves you, she'll forgive you.

1084
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:34,998
I can't have this child.

1085
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:37,332
[moans]

1086
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:40,703
- Holy shit, I've destroyed my life.
- [thunder rumbles]

1087
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,811
- You're having an affair, aren't you?
- [chuckles]

1088
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:50,975
- With Tatiana.
- With Tatiana, are you crazy?

1089
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,587
Who gave you that idea?

1090
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:57,523
- Your ludicrous brother?
- What does it matter?

1091
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,325
Apparently, you're shooting
the movie naked.

1092
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:04,158
- What?
- Even the way you say her name.

1093
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:06,733
- [scoffs]
- Tatiana.

1094
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,496
You know, you have
this amazing talent

1095
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,605
for making me feel
like a second-class citizen.

1096
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:17,244
- What do you mean?
- I mean, in your own meek, mousy way

1097
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,371
you have this brilliant knack
of getting your own way.

1098
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:24,915
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1099
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,091
[sobs] Wait, what does this
have to do with you and Tatiana?

1100
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,887
I never wanted him here,
but you insisted that he stay,

1101
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:36,792
even making me feel like a criminal for
suggesting that he stay somewhere else.

1102
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:41,129
This is bullshit, Dylan.
You're completely evading the issue!

1103
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,805
It's not a trick question.
Are you or aren't you sleeping with her?

1104
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:47,866
[sighs]

1105
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:59,379
What are you doing?

1106
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:02,887
I'm leaving this house
before you make me lose my temper

1107
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:04,787
in front of my children.

1108
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,619
[sighs]

1109
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,633
You couldn't wear pants, Ned?

1110
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,469
OK, I took the liberty
of writing up a checklist,

1111
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,838
if you could read it over carefully,
please,

1112
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,274
That's just the checklist, Ned.

1113
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:33,145
Wait, you put all
of this in your article?

1114
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,586
- That stuff was private.
- Well...

1115
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,622
Did she ever say it was off the record?

1116
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:40,694
Why would she say it was off the record,
we were just having a conversation.

1117
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:44,798
Ned, come on, she knew
you and I were a team.

1118
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,527
She called us a team
the first time that we met.

1119
01:03:47,691 --> 01:03:49,261
Yeah, and then you said
we weren't a team.

1120
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:51,099
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

1121
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:53,867
I remember precisely,
'cause I thought it was pretty mean.

1122
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,135
I dropped everything
to drive you around that day.

1123
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:58,279
All the documentary guys
were going for dim sum.

1124
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:01,473
You know what?
The important thing at this point

1125
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:04,949
is whether this information is true.

1126
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:06,985
It's all we need to know, Ned.

1127
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,781
Is this true?

1128
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:13,953
I'm gonna bring Darren in on this.

1129
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:21,063
Fuck. Fuckity-fuck, Ned,
she's getting a lawyer.

1130
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,727
How could you do this to a person?
That's so messed up.

1131
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:28,706
How can you do this to me?
Just say "Yes, this happened.“

1132
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:32,142
You're not even lying or anything.
It is true, so just...

1133
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:36,478
Fuck. Look, Ned, I am begging you.
Don't fucking do this to me, please?

1134
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,880
Come on, All right, here they come.

1135
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,419
Hi, Darren, how are you?

1136
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:45,549
Ah. I'm not happy at the way this
story's been put together, Miranda.

1137
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,921
[Robbie] I'm not either.

1138
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,586
You'll have to vouch for the veracity
of the story yourself, Ned.

1139
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:52,324
- Like right now?
- That's right. Right now.

1140
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:54,093
I need to hear it.

1141
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:58,269
[sighs]

1142
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,676
- Hey, Miranda.
- Hey, Ted.

1143
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:19,722
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Ahh!

1144
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,423
- You could n't just fucking say yes?
- Sorry.

1145
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,565
How could you do that to me, Ned?

1146
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:25,758
[elevator dings]

1147
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,960
[scoffs] Miranda's such a bitch
sometimes,

1148
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:32,129
I feel kind of bad,
it was a big opportunity for her.

1149
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,798
For what?
Selling her soul for a story?

1150
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:37,376
There was just
a breakdown of communication.

1151
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:38,945
Whatever.

1152
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:42,948
Looks like you found a use for
your mom's post 9/11 escape raft.

1153
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,710
It's cool. Sleep well, bud.

1154
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:50,213
- Tomorrow, Operation Free Willie.
- Right on.

1155
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,054
Have a good night.

1156
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:54,718
If you get cold,
there are coats up in the...

1157
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,830
- Oh, OK,
- Oh, and if you need to pee?

1158
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:59,626
- There's a kitty litter box right here.
- [laughs]

1159
01:06:00,657 --> 01:06:02,000
Nat.

1160
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:06,167
- [whispers] How's it going?
- Oh. Great.

1161
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:09,071
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Thanks so much for your advice.

1162
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:11,906
- Oh, my God. For sure. No.
- That was awesome.

1163
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:15,515
I mean, she's being exceptionally cool.

1164
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:19,577
She is exceptionally cool.

1165
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:22,848
- [Cindy] Nat, where are my ear plugs?
- Night, Ned.

1166
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,854

[J' Willie Nelson: "Ol' Blue"]

1168
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,629
J' I had a dog

1169
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:31,766
J' And his name was Blue

1170
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:34,424
J' I'll tell you what

1171
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:37,936
J' Ol' Blue would do

1172
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,165
J' Yeah, Blue

1173
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,004
J' Yeah, Blue
Yeah, Blue

1174
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:46,938
J' He'd go out

1175
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:50,107
J' Every night about dark

1176
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:52,947
J' And it wouldn't be long

1177
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,214
J' 'Til you'd hear him bark

1178
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,019
J' Yeah, Blue

J' Yeah, Blue
Yeah, Blue I

[engine shuts off]

1181
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,975
[Ned] No way, they're home!

1182
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,976
Jesus, what do we do?

1183
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:21,410
We go get Willie Nelson.

1184
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:26,147
[Billy] Are you mad about
the rooster thing?

1185
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:28,482
[Janet] Well, a little bit mad
about the fucking rooster.

1186
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:30,682
[Billy] Well, I'm telling you,
he's depressed.

1187
01:07:30,847 --> 01:07:34,488
And I'm telling you, there's no fucking
way a rooster is depressed, Billy,

1188
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:38,724
[Billy] When animals are depressed, man,
they, like, sleep more,

1189
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,390
[whispers] Sorry, didn't mean to touch
your boob.

1190
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:44,437
[Billy] Humans do it, roosters do it,
then they don't crow in the morning.

1191
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:46,232
- That's why I overslept.
- I'm so psyched

1192
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:50,572
- you and Nat weathered that storm.
- Yeah, we're good. We're good.

1193
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:54,010
And to power through infidelity,
man, you can do that,

1194
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,843
you can do anything.

1195
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:57,507
Oh, come on!

1196
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,857
Locked? She locked it?

1197
01:08:05,048 --> 01:08:06,618
Hold on. Right here.

Come in.

Hey, you know, that Christian, he's kind
of lame, but he's really handsome.

is going to be very striking.

Hey, Nat. Oh, no,
I'm just with your brother

1206
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:42,054
and he just told me some real
interesting news.

1207
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:43,219
- No!
- Nothing,

1208
01:08:43,386 --> 01:08:45,229
just that you're apparently pregnant

1209
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:49,427
with the spawn
of that fucking cult-y fuck fuck!

1210
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:53,239
- [barking]
- Yeah, sure. She wants to talk to you.

1211
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:55,069
- [barking]
- [Ned whispering] No, no.

1212
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:58,572
- Hello?
- Oh, shoot.

1213
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:02,308
- Hey, Nat. Now's not a great time.
- [Janet] Who's here?

1214
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:03,678
Janet, hey, what's up?

1215
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:07,247
- Can I call you back?
-Jesus Christ.

1216
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:10,016
- Yeah, it's me!
- What's going on, how's it going?

1217
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:13,592
- [Cindy] You don't sound very sorry!
- You thought you'd come and take him?

1218
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,196
- Who the fuck is this?
- [Cindy] You're gonna blame Ned?

1219
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:18,491
That's your tactic? [laughs]

1220
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:21,966
OK, I really didn't want to get
litigious, but I brought a lawyer.

1221
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:26,471
[Cindy] I am sorry I don't have a fat,
throbbing cock for you!

1222
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:28,540
That's some Ivy League
shit out there, man.

1223
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:30,371
- [Cindy] Really?
- Cindy!

1224
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:34,504
You wouldn't, would you, Nat? 'Cause
you're fucking selfish, that's why.

1225
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,117
No, no, no! I wanna
talk about this now, damn it!

1226
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:39,810
- I need your help, Cindy. Could you...?
- Really? An accident?!

1227
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:42,479
An accident is when you
fall off your fucking bike!

1228
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:45,125
- Not when you fuck somebody!
- Hey, Ned. What's up, man?

1229
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,791
- Hey, man.
- Caught the master criminal here

1230
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:51,124
trying to steal Willie Nelson.

1231
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:54,291
What happened
to the Dixie Chicks show?

1232
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:58,405
The Dixie Chicks? That's next Thursday.

1233
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:00,370
- Right, Janet?
- Yeah.

1234
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,874
- Next Thursday.
- When I talked to you last week,

1235
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:07,310
- you said it was next Thursday.
- Oh. It is. Next Thursday.

1236
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,916
Yeah, but when I talked to you a week
ago, you said "Next Thursday."

1237
01:10:10,073 --> 01:10:11,245
I'm thinking, today.

1238
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,819
So it's better for you
if I say "Next, next Thursday"?

1239
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:16,718
It's not better now, I thought you were
gonna be at the Dixie Chicks concert.

1240
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:21,328
Yeah, but just for future reference,
like for concerts in the future.

1241
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:23,327
- What, are you guys fucking?
- [car door slams]

1242
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:26,763
Oh, God! Cindy! Cindy!

1243
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:32,363
Oh! Dude! Man, there goes my ride.

1244
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:35,941
That's OK, I can give you a lift.
Or no, I can't.

1245
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,939
This can't be happening.

1246
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,349
I never should have let Ned stay here.

1247
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:47,078
What about what Ned did to me?

1248
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:51,191
I take him to work, he hangs me
out to dry in front of everyone.

1249
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:54,191
Hang on,
I'm getting call waiting. Hello?

1250
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,888
Our idiot brother
just ruined my fucking life.

1251
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:02,526
You know you'll always
have a place here with me.

1252
01:11:02,692 --> 01:11:04,569
Thanks, Mom.

1253
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:07,367
I thought the girls
wouldn't want you hanging around,

1254
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:11,307
they've got too much stuff going on
to bother with people like us,

1255
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:17,881
All right then, that's it.

1256
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,077
I will see you in three weeks.

1257
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,816
Hey, you know,
I've been meaning to tell you.

1258
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,290
You're doing
a really good thing here, Omar.

1259
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:30,556
- [laughs]
- Seriously. You talk to us screw-ups,

1260
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,326
you give us a reason
for getting out of bed in the morning.

1261
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,801
Thanks, man.

1262
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,962
So you get out of bed again
in another three weeks, OK?

1263
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,631
- [Chuckles] I'll do it.
- I appreciate the compliment.

1264
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,472
It's rare that we get love
from the clients.

1265
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,580
Well, you're a good dude.

1266
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:50,115
And I just needed this appointment
today, I'm having a tough go of it.

1267
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:55,484
I swear, I try and do good,
but I just screw it up.

1268
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:59,183
Man, I screwed it up with my sisters,
I'm back living with my mom.

1269
01:11:59,749 --> 01:12:02,753
On top of it all, I broke down
and smoked a joint

1270
01:12:02,919 --> 01:12:04,421
with the kid that lives
across the street.

1271
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:05,998
OK, I didn't just hear that.

1272
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,602
I said I broke down and smoked a joint
with the kid who lives across...

1273
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:12,205
What are you doing?
Hey! Ned, why are you telling me this?

1274
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:15,467
I just need to unload, man.
That's part of why I'm here, right?

1275
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:20,011
I'm not your therapist, Ned. You don't
tell your parole officer you got high.

1276
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,446
Now I have to report you
or else I could lose my job.

1277
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:29,789
Seriously? Can you forget I said that?

1278
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:34,460
- No, Ned, I can't.
- Oh, fuck.

1279
01:12:34,617 --> 01:12:35,891
[sighs]

1280
01:12:36,052 --> 01:12:37,554
[toilet flushing]

1281
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,557
You OK?

1282
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:43,969
[mother] it's an ulcer, I'm telling you.

1283
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,799
Too many late nights.

1284
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:48,033
Did you call Dr. Silverman?

1285
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,972
I will.

1286
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:54,478
Oh, yeah,
it's my fault you're throwing up.

1287
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:57,650
- [mother] Who's ready for charades?
- Me!

1288
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:00,651
Mom, nobody's in the mood.

1289
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:02,847
[mother] Great,
go and get the pens and paper.

1290
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:05,523
Television show.

1291
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:07,092
Three words.

1292
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,194
Gimme A Break.

1293
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,092
- That was quick.
- I put it in.

1294
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:16,762
All right, guys.

1295
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,040
River, this one-'s for you.

1296
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,669
All right, River, come on!
Here we go!

1297
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,845
Wizard of Oz.

1298
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:32,748
- Yeah,
- [Liz] Well done, sweetie.

1299
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:36,217
I guess it's me.

1300
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:41,694
OK, it's a movie.

1301
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:44,096
Space?

1302
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,960
Space, space, Star Wars!

1303
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:48,568
- Space." No.
- [River] Space Frogs!

1304
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,367
- Crazy Hands!
- Good, Crazy Hands?

1305
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:54,098
Crazy Heart.
"Crazy Little Thing Called Love.“

1306
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,039
- Uncle Ned!
- Me. Ned, Ned. Nedly, Nedrick.

1307
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,305
- Me, me, Ned!
- Why aren't you guys guessing?

1308
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,540
- The Jerk?
- Har har.

1309
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:04,548
- OK, guys, come on, guys.
- Jackass.

1310
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:06,709
[Natalie] You wanna get in on this
party, Liz?

1311
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:09,379
The Man Who Just Ruined My Marriage.

1312
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,154
Don't forget Lassie.
'Cause you miss your doggie.

1313
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:14,386
- Ha ha ha ha.
- [girls laughing]

1314
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:18,396
- Can you please just play the game?
- We are playing.

1315
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,124
No, you're not playing,
you're not at all.

1316
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,233
- We are.
- [Ned] No, you're not.

1317
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,267
- Yeah, we're kind of playing.
- [Ned] You're kind of not playing.

1318
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:26,737
- Those were great guesses, I thought.
- When you put your own clue in,

1319
01:14:26,896 --> 01:14:28,307
you're not allowed to guess.
You know that.

1320
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,910
- I bent the rules.
- You didn't bend the rules.

1321
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:35,345
You broke them and that just
ruins it for everyone, all right?

1322
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:36,949
I know you've got a really
important life, Miranda,

1323
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:41,418
but some of us like to sit around, enjoy
our family, and play a game of charades.

1324
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:42,988
[laughing]

1325
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,921
What's so funny, Nat?
By the way, when a kid goes,

1326
01:14:46,082 --> 01:14:48,824
you should at least give him
the opportunity to act out his hint.

1327
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,591
All right? Before you jump in
with the answer, even if you know it.

1328
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:55,099
It's the same stupid clue
Mom always puts in for River.

1329
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,932
So what? You're so cool,
you're just too bored, is that it?!

1330
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:01,769
For God's sake, Ned, we have
other things on our mind,

1331
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:03,274
So you make it miserable for everybody?

1332
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:06,436
- OK, Ned, we're gonna play.
- Let's get serious, girls.

1333
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:07,945
Just play the fucking game!

1334
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:09,378
[chatter silences]

1335
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:14,547
Goddamn it, I just want
to sit around with my family

1336
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,553
and play a fucking game of charades!

1337
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:29,565
I just wanna sit
and I just wanna play the game.

1338
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,466
I wanna play charades,
what's the big deal about that?

1339
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:33,664
Why can't you all just play?

1340
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,836
[doorbell rings]

1341
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:41,310
Sorry, Riv.

1342
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,981
- [Omar] Hello, Mrs. Rochlin?
- Yes.

1343
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:51,385
Officer Omar Coleman. Is your son home?

1344
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,494
He was just frustrated, officer.

1345
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,324
He gets very excited
playing parlor games.

1346
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,193
It's under control now.

1347
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:00,993
- Oh, my God.
- Omar.

1348
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:06,563
Mr. Rochlin, sir,
I suggest you step outside.

1349
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:09,367
[Miranda] What's going on?

1350
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,549
- [man] Nedrick Rochlin?
- Yeah.

1351
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:19,619
- You made bail.
- Really? Who?

1352
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:25,018
Miranda Rochlin. Just sign here,
we'll process you out.

1353
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,863
- No, I'm good.
- What?

1354
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:37,868
No, thanks. I'm gonna stay here, man.

1355
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:39,370
Thank you.

1356
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:46,741
Look, there's nothing I can do.
He refused to sign.

1357
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:49,542
- This is classic Ned.
- Officer, I'm his mother.

1358
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:52,879
Just bring him out here.
He probably doesn't understand the form.

1359
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:54,578
That's not how we do it, ma'am.

1360
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:58,425
- Can I speak to your supervisor?
- No.

1361
01:16:58,881 --> 01:17:01,885
Mom, if he doesn't want to be
released to us, we can't force him.

1362
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:05,999
Excuse me, sir, would it be possible
for my son to see him?

1363
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:10,893
I know you're really mad at my mom
and Aunt Natalie and Aunt Miranda.

1364
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:13,563
But they all feel really sorry, I swear.

1365
01:17:15,264 --> 01:17:18,734
River, I want you to go tell your mom
and your aunts something for me, OK?

1366
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:20,141
Sure, Uncle Ned.

1367
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:23,407
- Go fuck yourselves.
- River!

1368
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:25,745
That's what he said.

1369
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:38,087
Hey guys, I know how to get Uncle Ned
to leave prison.

1370
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,392
- Well, hello.
- [engine shuts off]

1371
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:11,454
- Hi.
- [Janet] The Rochlin girls.

1372
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:15,692
This is a pleasant
and unexpected surprise.

1373
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:19,305
- The farm looks beautiful, Janet.
- Oh, thanks, Liz.

1374
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:22,999
So, what brings you all up here?

1375
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:24,400
Um...

1376
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,641
We were practically family, Janet.

1377
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:32,718
And we thought... um...

1378
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,387
...it would be good
to get some closure, you know?

1379
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,320
Yeah, that and we came for Ned's dog.

1380
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,189
[laughs] So he roped
the whole family in, huh?

1381
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:46,162
Well, forget it.
Willie Nelson isn't leaving.

1382
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,167
It's what's best for him.

1383
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:52,033
Janet, Ned needs
Willie Nelson's company right now.

1384
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:55,338
- Emotionally...
- Look,

1385
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:58,501
I'm not giving that
irresponsible man-child my dog.

1386
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,442
Come on, Janet, it's just a dog.

1387
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:03,015
Uh... to you, maybe, Natalie.

1388
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:05,174
To me, Willie Nelson
is a dear, dear friend.

1389
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:07,844
- That is a load of crap, Janet.
- I love that dog!

1390
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:11,924
Nobody loves that dog
the way Ned loves that dog.

1391
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:16,791
Nobody loves anything
as unconditionally as Ned loves.

1392
01:19:20,022 --> 01:19:21,092
[93595]

1393
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,964
He's in jail, Janet.

1394
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,695
- [Janet] Oh, my God.
- He needs our help.

1395
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,305
That was fast.
What did he do this time?

1396
01:19:26,462 --> 01:19:30,433
He didn't do shit.
We put him there, all of us.

1397
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,044
Including you, Janet.

1398
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:35,045
I am not gonna stand here
and be insulted on my own porch.

1399
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:38,981
- I'll insult you right here.
- I'm a pacifist. I don't play that way.

1400
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:41,644
I'm gonna peace you in the side of
the head if you don't give us the dog.

1401
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:44,484
I'm not gonna receive that
with anything but love.

1402
01:19:45,047 --> 01:19:46,754
We are not leaving.

1403
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,130
OK, I love that tactic.

1404
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:57,161
Billy, get me the phone.

1405
01:19:59,495 --> 01:20:03,170
Janny, where's the dog bowl
that he loves so much?

1406
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:05,608
- Billy, what are you doing?
- Let's go. Come on.

1407
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:09,147
- What are you doing?
- Hey, it's his dog, man.

1408
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:13,185
Billy, put the dog in the house.
Put the dog in the house, Billy!

1409
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:15,982
Ilene, you can't take this dog!
This is his home!

1410
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:18,921
Go back to your fruits
and vegetables, honey.

1411
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:20,924
William! Billy!

1412
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:23,586
What the fuck are you doing?
Get the dog!

1413
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:27,461
- Hey, easy language, man.
- [dog barking]

1414
01:20:27,623 --> 01:20:30,297
- Tell Ned we said, "Hey."
- [Miranda] Thanks, Billy.

1415
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:36,936
[dog barking]

1416
01:20:40,102 --> 01:20:42,275
Willie! Willie!

1417
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:44,475
Oh, thank God, Willie Nelson!

1418
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,620
Yeah, buddy! Willie!

1419
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,618
- [barking]
- Yeah! Hey, buddy!

1420
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:51,690
J' When you're hot and you're
cold, not always easy to hold

1421
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,123
J' And you?e hard to impress

1422
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:56,524
J' Sounds funny
But you might be the best

1423
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,789
Want some?

1424
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:01,526
- I Thing that I have
- Not the whole thing! [laughs]

1425
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,796
J' 'Cause whenever you've gone
and Fm left ah' alone

1426
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,372
J' Well, the world
seems worse

1427
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,510
J' No, I didn't really
like you at first

1428
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:12,976
J' I was wrong about that

1429
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:17,143
J' So wherever I go

1430
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:19,684
J' I'm taking you with me

1431
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:23,555
J' Wherever I go

1432
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:27,250
J' You're coming along

1433
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,420
Hey, Jeremy. Uh, is it...

1434
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,231
,..crazy to think we...

1435
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:39,939
J' That's where you belong

1436
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:43,076
I know you're not
gonna call me back, but, um...

1437
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:46,242
One more thing...

1438
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:49,508
Remember the time
I missed your awards dinner?

1439
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:53,617
Well, I wasn't really working.

1440
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:57,189
I was at home watching
Kourtney and Kim Take New York.

1441
01:21:57,346 --> 01:21:59,417
I'm sorry. Um.,. what else?

1442
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:02,528
J' So wherever I go

1443
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:05,790
J' I'm taking you with me

1444
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:08,901
J' Wherever I go

1445
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:12,300
J' You're coming along

1446
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:15,305
J' You're in my heart I

1447
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:17,375
-Ah!
-Oh!

1448
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:20,872
Jeremy and I were talking,

1449
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:23,448
he has a friend who's also
going through a divorce.

1450
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,211
And he works in Poverty at the UN.

1451
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:28,379
He's really nice and really funny.

1452
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:31,217
He does pottery at the UN?

1453
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:35,954
I mean, if he's a friend of Jeremy's,
then I guess I could give it a go.

1454
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:37,597
- Right?
- What's his name?

1455
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:41,059
[Miranda] Roger... Maybe Roger.

1456
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:43,566
What?

1457
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:46,899
Um... That was Cindy.

1458
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:49,770
She wants to come with me tomorrow
to the OB/GYN.

1459
01:22:49,932 --> 01:22:51,809
[all] Oh!

1460
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,469
We're getting Cindy.

1461
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,410
- [laughter]
- That's great, Nat.

1462
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:57,847
Maybe going all "Honest Ned"
on her worked.

1463
01:22:58,507 --> 01:23:00,578
- You don't have to thank me, It's OK.
- Thank you, Ned.

1464
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:03,416
- [laughter]
- You're gonna be the best uncle.

1465
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:05,923
- That's sweet.
- Aw, he is the best uncle.

1466
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:09,528
I can't wait. You better come visit me.

1467
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:13,757
- Come visit where?
- What do you mean?

1468
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:20,105
I've been wanting to tell you guys.
I think it's time for me to move on.

1469
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:24,368
- No.
- Move on? Move on where?

1470
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:27,438
No. I mean...

1471
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:30,777
You know we just love having you
in our house. Don't you know that?

1472
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:32,680
Oh, I do know that, and I love you too.

1473
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:36,687
But the city's no place
for Willie Nelson or for me.

1474
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:39,121
I feel like I'm gonna cry.

1475
01:23:39,281 --> 01:23:42,125
You guys are gonna be great.
My work here is done.

1476
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:44,890
Who's gonna watch sci-11 with Jeremy?
I can't always do it.

1477
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:47,556
- Who's gonna babysit my kid for free?
- Yeah, who?

1478
01:23:47,723 --> 01:23:49,725
- [music plays]
- [laughter]

1479
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:59,208
[Ned] They're brand new,
I just made them yesterday.

1480
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,871
So you're getting some really
fresh candles. All right.

1481
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,643
Have a great Shabbos with those.
Thanks a lot.

1482
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:10,986
Anyway, what I was saying though,
is people recycle cans,

1483
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:14,491
they recycle papers, why not candles?

1484
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,994
I say we put a bin out and let people
bring back their old drippings

1485
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:20,031
- at their convenience.
- it's like those bags that say

1486
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:21,861
"l used to be a plastic bottle."

1487
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:24,904
We could have a bin that said:
"I used to be another candle."

1488
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,768
That's a great idea.
And when they bring in those candles,

1489
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:30,740
we'll put them in another bin that says:
"l used to be another another candle."

1490
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,879
Yeah, eventually we could
just have one that said:

1491
01:24:33,035 --> 01:24:34,776
"Trust me,
I used to be a lot of candles."

1492
01:24:34,937 --> 01:24:36,109
"I've been a lot of candles."

1493
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:38,251
"Trust me, man,
I've been other candles."

1494
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:39,579
[laughs]

1495
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,846
Hey, can I get your
honest opinion on something?

1496
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,182
- Sure.
- OK.

1497
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:45,190
- Be honest with me.
- Of course.

1498
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:48,188
Do you think this is an ugly candle?

1499
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:51,695
No way, man. There's no such thing
as an ugly homemade candle.

1500
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:53,196
- Really?
- Yeah,

1501

1502
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:58,399
We should send, like, just a bunch
of candles to Janet as a thank you.

1503
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,568
Totally. To thank her
for introducing us and everything?

1504
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:04,938
Isn't it funny how life works?

1505
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,912
I love it. Just a couple of guys
and a dog, making candles,

1506
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:11,083

01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:21,948
- Sorry about that?
- Why do you do that, guys?

1531
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:25,353
[laughs] I panicked, man. Oh, my God,
I was running all through town

Thank you.
