1
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:36,530
Susan?

2
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:39,397
Wake up, Susan.

3
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:43,137
Mike, what is it?

4
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,450
-It's 3:00 in the morning.
-I'm not getting married.

5
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,913
Remember what I said to you?

6
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:55,251
"If I ask you to marry me,
can I take it back?"

7
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:58,952
And you said I could, didn't you?
I'm taking it back, that's all.

8
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,942
Look, I don't think I could be faithful.

9
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,114
Whenever I walk down the street,
I want to grab every ass I see.

10
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,987
That's not normal.

11
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:54,472
India's overpopulated.
The suicide rate is up.

12
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,347
We'll all be sterilized. The air is polluted.

13
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:59,818
Is that the kind of world
you want to get married in?

14
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,753
Susan, someday maybe I'll get good
and stoned...

15
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,654
we'll go off and we'll do it.

16
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:42,094
That way I won't feel like I'm married.
What do you say?

17
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:50,765
Give me a break, take the pressure off me.

18
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,037
Call off the wedding.

19
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:58,904
All right, Susan.
I've got to lay my cards on the table.

20
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:02,915
I wasn't going to tell you
'cause I didn't want to hurt your feelings...

21
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:05,976
but there's something about you
that really bugs me.

22
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:07,988
You have very fat arms.

23
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,622
I tried. I really tried, Susan...

24
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:17,257
but it's getting close.

25
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:20,892
There's only three days left,
and I can't go any further.

26
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:31,308
You and Ritchie
going to pick up the tuxedos today?

27
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:39,050
You'll have to get the cufflinks
for the ushers, too.

28
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,682
Did I tell you I got a salad bowl
from Johnny and Wilma?

29
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,695
-It's from Tiffany's.
-No kidding.

30
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,062
Do you think he'll make the wedding?

31
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,699
-Who, Mike?
-No. Father Gregory.

32
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,543
-Mike's really uptight about the wedding.
-Not Johnny. Weddings make him sexy.

33
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,980
Wilma? Cool it with Dad.

34
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:46,682
What's the matter?
Don't you trust anyone over 30?

35
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:51,120
Mr. and Mrs. Henderson.

36
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:55,792
-Bernice.
-I always wanted to call you Bernice.

37
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,491
You should have been
at the Fitzpatrick wedding.

38
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,933
It was absolutely fabulous. It was incredible.

39
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,528
They had a Michelangelo statue.
It was a little slave with an urn.

40
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:09,440
The champagne just simply spilled over.
It was marvelous.

41
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,708
A wedding like that.... There you are.
Didn't I see you at Wilma's wedding?

42
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,306
-That's right.
-I never forget a face.

43
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:19,251
Busy, busy, busy.
I have to leave you. Help yourself.

44
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,811
-Everything's all right.
-Thank you.

45
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,790
-Look who's here.
-Here are my little girls.

46
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:28,226
-Dad.
-How are you, Susan, my sweetheart?

47
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:31,554
Hello, Wilma. How are you?

48
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:34,430
-Hi, Kathy.
-Sit down.

49
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:37,969
Wilma, a little champagne here.

50
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,169
I forgot. You don't drink too much, do you?

51
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:44,302
And a little for my baby. There you are.

52
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:48,144
Now, a toast to the bride.

53
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,674
-To the bride.
-To the bride.

54
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,845
Is everybody comfortable?

55
00:05:57,058 --> 00:05:59,754
Look at me. I was so beautiful then.

56
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,658
Did I see you at Wilma's wedding?

57
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:04,391
-I'm Wilma.
-That's why you were there.

58
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:08,093
Busy, busy, busy.
I won't be too much longer.

59
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,831
-ls Phyllis better?
-Who?

60
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:13,805
Your roommate. Will she be well enough
to come to the wedding?

61
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:17,072
-I hope so.
-Johnny looks the same as he does now.

62
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:18,611
Big Italian lug.

63
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,204
Don't complain, Wilma.
At least you're married.

64
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:24,149
If Mike makes half the husband
that Johnny is...

65
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,242
I'll be satisfied.

66
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,288
He's won't go into your business.
I can tell you that right now.

67
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:31,655
Don't you worry, Susan.
He has to do his thing. I understand.

68
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:33,489
There's no gap here.

69
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,695
-Look who's here.
-Mike.

70
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,430
What a pleasant surprise, son.
Susan didn't tell us you were coming.

71
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,025
-I didn't know.
-You all know my brother, Ritchie?

72
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:43,297
Hi, Ritchie.

73
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:46,431
Wilma, I hear we got a great salad bowl
from you and Johnny.

74
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:49,032
-It's from Tiffany's.
-No kidding?

75
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,172
Sit down, Ritchie.

76
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,272
I need the key to the apartment back.

77
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,908
Mike? As long as you're both here...

78
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,952
why don't you and Ritchie
have lunch with us?

79
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,046
I'm sorry, Mr. Henderson.
We really got to split. Right, Ritchie?

80
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:04,182
-We'll be seeing you at the barbecue.
-Right.

81
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,091
Ritchie, we're expecting you
and your lovely wife.

82
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:08,951
So long.

83
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,328
-Good-bye, boys.
-Bye-bye, son.

84
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,859
Is Joan coming to the barbecue?

85
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:17,769
Barbecue? I don't know
if she'll make the wedding.

86
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:21,099
I love weddings.
They're such a family thing.

87
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:24,634
And when it comes down
to the real nitty-gritty...

88
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:27,738
that's all a man has. His family.

89
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,616
-Mike, do you want some more soup?
-No, I'm full.

90
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:35,178
-How about you, Frank? More soup?
-I don't want no more soup.

91
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:40,091
-Go ahead, Frank. It's good soup.
-All right, let me have some more soup.

92
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:42,958
Ritchie?

93
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:44,763
-Mike?
-No.

94
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,199
You're sure?

95
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:54,664
It's been a long time
since we all had a meal together.

96
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,836
-How's Nick?
-Who?

97
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:02,873
-Your roommate.
-Nick. He's fine.

98
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,884
Will we finally meet him at the wedding?

99
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:08,012
I promise you,
you'll see my roommate at the wedding.

100
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,523
A wedding is such a joyous event.

101
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:14,522
It's the joining of two people
together through thick and thin...

102
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:18,793
in a union of spiritual goodness,
forever and ever...

103
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,864
that only God can put asunder.

104
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,207
-You want some more veal, Mike?
-No, Ma.

105
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:34,145
-You want some more veal?
-I don't want no more veal.

106
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:38,049
-The butcher gave you good veal, Frank.
-Yeah, he's a good butcher.

107
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,643
It's not veiny.

108
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,050
I hate veiny veal.

109
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,401
So what's the story, Ritchie?

110
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,742
Get off his back.
Let him work out his own problems.

111
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:10,181
-Quiet. We're not talking about marriage.
-We're talking about divorce.

112
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:13,584
-lf it was marriage, you could talk.
-But we're talking about divorce.

113
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:17,021
-So be quiet.
-Marriage is different from divorce.

114
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,423
So what's the story, Ritchie?

115
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:22,790
We're just not compatible.

116
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:26,060
-Hear that? They're not compatible.
-I heard, but I'm not listening.

117
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:29,227
Married for six years, all of a sudden
they want to be compatible.

118
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,828
-It's a phase.
-These stupid kids today.

119
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:35,273
Don't know what to do with themselves,
so they get a divorce for kicks.

120
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,434
That's what it is. Kicks.

121
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,276
It's 1970. It happens to a lot of couples.
There's nothing you can do about it.

122
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,372
-Never in our family.
-We don't believe in it.

123
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,315
Happens to people who don't give a damn.

124
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:46,751
Would the King and Queen of England
get a divorce?

125
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:49,255
-Don't believe in it.
-It's why they're together.

126
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,621
They know what'd happen to England
if they broke up.

127
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:54,593
-But our son believes in it.
-He wouldn't care what happened...

128
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:58,063
to England or anybody.
It's 1970, so he's getting a divorce.

129
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:02,398
He was such a beautiful groom.
Everybody said it was made in heaven.

130
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,031
His grandmother was so happy
she lived to see him marry.

131
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,576
Jackie next door has three kids,
and he's never even been to college.

132
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:14,506
-Mike's not getting a divorce.
-I'm not even married yet.

133
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,717
So what's the story, Ritchie?

134
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,917
I think they're hinting at something.
They want to know the story.

135
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:27,153
-Where are you going?
-Upstairs.

136
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:30,527
Sorry to split, but we're not going
to talk about marriage...

137
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:32,759
and that's the only thing I know about.

138
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,291
Right, we're going to talk about divorce,
about which I'm an expert.

139
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,703
You're the only one
who's ever come close, wise guy.

140
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:42,503
Your brother's getting married.
How can you get a divorce?

141
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:46,307
Shut up, Beatrice.
Where the hell do you think you're going?

142
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:51,542
Joan and I talked it out,
and believe me, it's better this way.

143
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:52,643
Better?

144
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,244
-For who? Your mother?
-Your father?

145
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,755
-I'll tell you who it's better for. You.
-Always you.

146
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,122
-Do you know what's better for you?
-You don't know.

147
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,525
-Only you know.
-Did you listen when I told you...

148
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:04,462
-not to marry her in the first place?
-Listen to your father.

149
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:07,433
Don't you understand?
Joan and I are just not happy together.

150
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,799
Hear that, Beatrice?
They're not happy together.

151
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,064
I heard, Frank.

152
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,901
Who's happy?

153
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,339
Do you see me running around
dancing in the streets?

154
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,242
Do you see your father running around
dancing in the streets?

155
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:21,770
What, are you better than me?
You think your mother and I are happy?

156
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:24,545
-You and Mom aren't happy?
-No.

157
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,950
Then why did you stay together?

158
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:30,186
-We're content.
-We're content.

159
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,454
These kids today,
all they're looking for is happiness.

160
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,554
Don't look for happiness, Ritchie.
It'll only make you miserable.

161
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:40,962
If I'm not going to be happy,
I don't want to be married.

162
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:43,765
Where the hell does he think he's going?

163
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,206
You think you're smart.

164
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:51,303
I'm telling you you're not smart.
I know you're not smart.

165
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,709
You're stupid.

166
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,112
You think only married people are unhappy?

167
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,480
-What about Eddie Shride?
-Or Tommy Pizzo?

168
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,179
-Or your Aunt Pauline?
-Or Father Burke?

169
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,724
-You want to end up like them?
-Unhappy?

170
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,385
Why do you think
we all keep our families together?

171
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:13,297
For happiness? No. For the family.

172
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:16,795
-For the kids.
-We don't have any kids.

173
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,930
I told you not to have any kids.
I told him not to have any kids.

174
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:23,909
What about your nephew, Mark?
You and Joan are his godparents.

175
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:25,602
You got a responsibility.

176
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,206
Who'll take care of him
if, God forbid, we all die in a fire?

177
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:31,911
We could all get killed
crossing the street by a truck.

178
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:35,888
-Or die of a heart attack in the living room.
-Or get electrocuted in the bathtub.

179
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,015
Believe me, dying is no picnic.

180
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:41,926
If you're not going to talk intelligently,
I'm not going to discuss it with you.

181
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:44,123
For God's sake, Frank, do something.

182
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:47,395
Don't tell me you won't discuss it.
I'll take off my strap...

183
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:49,868
and give you a beating.
I don't care how old you are.

184
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,405
Don't you touch him.
That's all you know, the strap.

185
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:55,567
Where were you when he was young
and really needed a good beating?

186
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:58,703
-It's all your fault.
-Don't give me it's my fault.

187
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,237
It's your fault. You spoiled him.
It's all your fault.

188
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:05,774
I don't blame Ritchie. I don't blame Joan.
I don't even blame you.

189
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:08,845
You know who I blame?
The Ecumenical council.

190
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:12,085
Once you start monkeying around
with who's a saint and who isn't...

191
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,524
it makes the young people crazy.

192
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:17,530
God, why did this have to happen?
Maybe I wasn't a good mother.

193
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:21,931
Is it my fault? It is my fault, isn't it, Ritchie?

194
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,731
Stop it. It's nobody's fault.

195
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,864
It's got to be somebody's fault.
I want to know whose fault.

196
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,967
We'll talk to him at the wedding, Frank.
Joan will be there, too.

197
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,410
Would you believe I lived with them
till I got married?

198
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,082
When they get started
they can really put you away.

199
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:47,423
You and Susan had the right idea.
You lived together.

200
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,758
You got to know each other.

201
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,856
I grew up with Joan,
too scared to do what you did.

202
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,231
It was a different world. So we got married...

203
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,668
and then we found out it was a mistake.

204
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:01,271
But it's not going to happen to you.
You got it made.

205
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,367
What makes me so special?

206
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:08,143
I'm walking down the same aisle you did.

207
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:14,118
I saw our wedding pictures
at Donaldson's today.

208
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,314
Yeah?

209
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:19,955
You look the same, Johnny...

210
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:25,458
-but I've gotten older.
-No, you haven't, honey.

211
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:30,633
But you have to keep in shape.

212
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:34,401
Remember, you haven't got four years
in the Marines behind you.

213
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,044
Do you think Susan will be happy
with Mike?

214
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,725
Why not? They've been making it for a year.

215
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,494
Could be just physical.

216
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,027
That's a good place to start.

217
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,298
I'll be right out, Johnny.

218
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:24,285
He and Dr. Edwardes were on a high,
sloping roof.

219
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:27,755
And when he saw Edwardes plunge
over the edge to his death...

220
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:31,730
he also saw the angry proprietor
hiding behind the chimney, laughing.

221
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,734
The symbolism
of the small wheel escapes me.

222
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,770
You are thinking that now, Dr. Murchison.

223
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:43,966
Honey, wait a minute.

224
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,535
Ingrid Bergman just found out
who the murderer is.

225
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:51,573
-You've seen Spellbound four times.
-Six times. It's one of my all-time favorites.

226
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:53,711
Convicted as a sane man...

227
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,649
and killed in the electric chair
for your crime.

228
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:01,492
-I'm going to telephone...
-Boy, lngrid Bergman.

229
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,388
What about Gregory Peck?

230
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:12,169
-He hasn't got your looks.
-That's true.

231
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,811
Wait a minute, honey.
You're going to make me miss the ending.

232
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:22,846
Okay, I'll wait.

233
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,147
Any husband of Constance
is a husband of mine.

234
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,984
-All right. Goodbye. Good luck.
-Goodbye.

235
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,966
Good night, honey.

236
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,250
Come on, Wilma. I'm tired.

237
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,298
Are you going to make love to me or not?

238
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,139
-I owe you one.
-You owe me two.

239
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,875
How do you figure I owe you two?

240
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:29,611
Last Friday and the Wednesday before,
when your mother stayed over...

241
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,810
and you didn't want to make noise.

242
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,752
Okay, now I owe you three. I'm good for it.

243
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:50,061
What?

244
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,430
Come on, Wilma.
I'm not in the mood right now.

245
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,168
All right, if you really don't want to.

246
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:01,646
I don't want you to do anything
you don't want to do.

247
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,521
Don't you ever touch me again.

248
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,661
Will you put the cigarette out
and go to sleep?

249
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:26,399
-I can't sleep when I'm like this.
-It's all in your mind.

250
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:30,239
-lt is not. I feel sexy.
-It's just nerves. Have a sandwich.

251
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,355
Come on, Wilma. In the morning.

252
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,694
I'm not interested in the morning.
It's not romantic in the morning.

253
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,530
-It's romantic now.
-To me it's work.

254
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:05,974
Look, it's Thursday already.
We haven't made love in 10 days.

255
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:09,038
We both work very hard
to make love at least twice a week...

256
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,107
so if we don't tonight...

257
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,778
there's going to be a lot of pressure on us
to catch up.

258
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:17,017
It wouldn't be that way
if you didn't nag me about it all the time.

259
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,218
Nag? I've tried
every subtle way of reaching you...

260
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,386
except showing stag films.

261
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:26,159
I get the feeling that you're trying
to make my virility look impotent.

262
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:29,168
-When did that feeling first hit you?
-The day I married you.

263
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:32,603
-I was dynamite with other women.
-They were lucky to be there...

264
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,971
with the record holder
in three-second intercourse.

265
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:36,566
Out of all the women in the world...

266
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:39,077
I had to go marry
an equal-time-orgasm fanatic.

267
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:43,082
Read a couple of Ladies' Home Journals
and all you can think is "Me, too."

268
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,175
And why not "me, too?"

269
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,083
You really want to take over, don't you?

270
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:49,418
Don't think I haven't
noticed the new wardrobe...

271
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:52,925
with the pants, the suits, the ties.
You really look butch.

272
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:55,928
Butch? I'm more feminine
than you'll ever be.

273
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,830
-All I want is a little tenderness.
-Look who wants tenderness.

274
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:06,134
I'll give you tenderness.
There's your tenderness.

275
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:09,004
You better decide
whether you want to be a man or a woman...

276
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:11,806
and then talk tenderness to me, Wilma.
Or is it Willy?

277
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,970
I tell you what.

278
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,812
You decide what you want to be first,
and then I'll be what's left.

279
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:20,914
You think you're so masculine
because whenever we have a problem...

280
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,980
you roll over, you go to sleep,
or get drunk, or try to act rough with me.

281
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,049
I got a hot flash for you.

282
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:31,393
Those tough Marine drill sergeants
are the biggest fags in the world!

283
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,331
What did you say?

284
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,766
Don't you talk about
the Marine Corps that way.

285
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:39,932
Okay. They're the biggest latent fags.
But they're not real men.

286
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,769
A real man is warm and understanding...

287
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:46,074
and tender, and gentle,
and loving, and sensitive, and--

288
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:47,477
And what's a woman?

289
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:52,109
A woman is strong,
and responsible, and brave, and--

290
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,011
And what? And what?

291
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:57,079
A woman is very....

292
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,790
I don't know what a woman is.

293
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:07,524
I don't see any difference
between us anymore.

294
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:28,048
At the wedding,
we'll rent an extra room for the kids.

295
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,521
By then I'll be a little rested.

296
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,491
We'll order some champagne.
It'll be like a second honeymoon.

297
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,221
How's that sound?

298
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:39,591
All right, honey.
Good night. Put the light out.

299
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:51,407
Remember, now you owe me three.

300
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:54,704
-Susan, you're....
-Rare.

301
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,373
-Wilma?
-Medium.

302
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,349
-Johnny?
-Same as mine.

303
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:02,350
Mother's is medium-rare,
and Kathy's is medium-rare.

304
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,014
Mike's I won't start till he comes.

305
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:12,630
Someday we're going to move to Florida
so I can barbecue all year round.

306
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:15,629
I don't understand...

307
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:18,034
why you can't put
the Trepannis with the Hendersons.

308
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:22,734
Because oil and water don't mix.
Bernice, the Trepannis are Italian, New York.

309
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,369
Hal's relatives are lrish, Bridgeport.

310
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:33,016
-Johnny, don't tire yourself. Take it easy.
-All right, guys. Come on. Let's go.

311
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:37,089
Boys, you're going to wear your father out.

312
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:44,958
-Son, how do you like yours?
-Charred.

313
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,625
Remember me?

314
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:56,070
-What's the matter?
-Ritchie's getting a divorce.

315
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:00,206
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

316
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:07,582
I said I was sorry.
What's that got to do with us?

317
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:10,418
If you don't get married,
you don't get a divorce.

318
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,788
Are you just going
to be uptight all the time now?

319
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,019
Maybe.

320
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:16,095
What do you want to do?
Call off the wedding?

321
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:18,392
-That's right.
-Go on just as we are?

322
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:21,332
Why not? It's been beautiful
for a year and a half.

323
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:25,333
-You mean it?
-Yeah, okay.

324
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,566
That's it. Let's go home.

325
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:31,439
Wait. There's just one thing.

326
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:36,176
-You see that man over there?
-You mean the Charcoal King?

327
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,649
That man is going
to get up tomorrow morning...

328
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:42,176
put on his striped trousers,
and wait for my mother...

329
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:46,221
who will be putting on her $900 dress
from Bergdorf Goodman.

330
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,490
And they will go together
to our family church...

331
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:53,020
to greet over 100 people who are
coming to see him give the bride away.

332
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,363
You're trying to make me look
like the bad one.

333
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,131
It won't work.
I owe you nothing, baby, you get it?

334
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:01,696
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about that man...

335
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:05,534
who has taken over
the Grand Ballroom of the Stoneridge lnn...

336
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:09,343
hired musicians, paid for 150 dinners,
50 cases of--

337
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:12,817
I'll pay back every penny.
I've got about $20. Take it as a deposit.

338
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:16,652
Don't give it to me. Give it to him.
That's all you have to do.

339
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,850
I will. You're damn right I will.

340
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,736
-This charred enough for you, son?
-Mr. Henderson, I'm Phyllis.

341
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,395
-Who?
-Susan's roommate...

342
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:36,442
the one she's been living with
for a year and a half.

343
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,440
Let's walk a little.

344
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:41,674
-lf you don't believe me, ask--
-I believe you. No gap.

345
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:45,012
When Susan walks down that aisle
in her white bridal gown...

346
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:48,418
Virgin Susan meets Father Gregory,
that's hypocrisy.

347
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:49,750
We're, like, married already.

348
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:52,656
I don't want to go through with this sham.
Do you understand?

349
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:55,058
I understand, Mike. Sit down.

350
00:24:56,296 --> 00:24:58,958
There's no gap here, Mike, believe me.

351
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:02,723
Maybe it was all right in your time,
but it's not right for Susan and me.

352
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:06,238
-We don't live lies anymore.
-We have two girls.

353
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:09,473
You're two brothers, aren't you?

354
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,504
Maybe if you had a sister...

355
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:14,775
you'd understand about mothers
and daughters and weddings.

356
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,282
Weddings aren't planned
a few months ahead.

357
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,945
Weddings are planned
from the time the girl is about six.

358
00:25:22,055 --> 00:25:26,219
Susan went to her first masquerade party
at eight...

359
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:30,992
dressed as a bride.

360
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:32,792
Please.

361
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:36,361
What would you rather do, Mike?
Run away to Canada?

362
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:37,903
I sure would.

363
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:40,399
It's up to you, Mike.

364
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:44,807
All you have to do is weigh your own hurt
against the hurt of all the others...

365
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,311
and then do what's best.

366
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:50,816
But whatever you decide, I'll understand.
No gap.

367
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,721
-Did you tell him?
-I told him.

368
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:04,457
Where do we stand?

369
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,460
In front of Father Gregory.

370
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,330
-Don't do it for me.
-I'm not doing it for you.

371
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,570
I'm doing it for a little eight-year-old girl...

372
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:19,976
who went to her first masquerade
dressed as a bride.

373
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:23,282
-He told you that?
-You never did.

374
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:29,081
Is there anything else I should know?

375
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:37,925
Just that I love you, you son of a bitch.

376
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:46,128
-Mother, the barbecue's going beautifully.
-Kathy, if we place--

377
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:49,266
I have nothing more to say
about the Trepannis and the Hendersons.

378
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:50,934
Don't ask my opinion, Bernice.

379
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,638
Don't ask my opinion
about the seating plan...

380
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:57,274
or anything else connected
with your daughter's wedding.

381
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:07,593
Do something. You're so good with her.

382
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,322
Don't worry, Mother. I'll handle it.

383
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:27,375
-Are you in there?
-No, go away.

384
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,972
Let me in. I want to talk to you.

385
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:33,280
There's nothing to say.
Nothing. It's all nothing.

386
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:45,627
-Goodbye, Hal.
-Goodbye, Kathy.

387
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:51,698
I love you so much. You're my whole life.
I can't live without you.

388
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:56,401
I couldn't live without you. I love you.
You didn't mean what you just said.

389
00:27:57,777 --> 00:28:00,302
There's nothing to say.
Nothing. It's all nothing.

390
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,213
10 years of nothing. I don't want it anymore.

391
00:28:03,283 --> 00:28:06,252
I promise you,
as soon as Susan gets married...

392
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,718
I'll ask Bernice for a divorce.

393
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:10,187
You promised that last year
and the year before.

394
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:13,748
-This time will be different.
-"As soon as Wilma has another baby."

395
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:16,386
-Please, Kathy.
-"As soon as Susan gets married."

396
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:21,092
She's getting married, Hal,
and where's mine?

397
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,658
This could be dangerous.
Bernice might hear us.

398
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:26,603
I don't care anymore.
I never want to see you again.

399
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:30,040
If you let 10 years of love end
in a bathroom...

400
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:32,543
I'll lose all respect for myself.

401
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:35,915
-Goodbye, Hal.
-Goodbye, Kathy.

402
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:40,644
I love you so much. You're my whole life.
I can't live without you.

403
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,119
These few precious moments
we have together are everything.

404
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:51,186
They are precious.

405
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:52,821
My knee.

406
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:56,232
Sorry, Kathy. Get up.
You're hurting my muscle.

407
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:01,967
Why must it be sordid like this?

408
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:04,970
Sordid?

409
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:08,444
How could you call this sordid?

410
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:14,446
You can't help who you love
and who you don't love.

411
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,114
I love you, and I want you to be happy.

412
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,523
And I don't love Bernice,
but I want her to be happy.

413
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:24,029
And I do love my children,
and I want them to be happy.

414
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,964
But I don't want my wanting Bernice
to be happy...

415
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,433
to take away from my love for you.

416
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:34,096
But my wanting my children to be happy,
while not taking away my love for you...

417
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:38,439
will make Bernice happy,
and therefore make the children happy.

418
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,339
I want everyone to be happy.

419
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,477
Everyone.

420
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:48,384
-That could be my biggest fault.
-I want everyone to be happy, too.

421
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:53,849
Bernice is really a wonderful girl.

422
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:58,530
That's why it's hell for me. She's so boring.

423
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:00,193
I know.

424
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:03,559
All she's interested in is making a home
for me and the kids...

425
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:07,834
the PTA and Bloomingdale's,
the A&P and the Girl Scouts.

426
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:11,638
-I want that, too.
-But you're such a vital person.

427
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:13,771
I am.

428
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:21,320
-Why don't you tell Bernice?
-Because I don't want to hurt her.

429
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:23,855
-Do you want to hurt me?
-Of course not.

430
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,823
Somebody has to get hurt.

431
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:29,191
In a situation like this,
somebody has to get hurt.

432
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:31,928
Do you want Bernice to get hurt?

433
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,492
No, I don't want to hurt Bernice.

434
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,505
-Do you want my children to get hurt?
-No.

435
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,006
-I don't want to....
-Then who should get hurt? Me?

436
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:55,281
-I feel nauseous.
-Don't get sick on me, please.

437
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:00,520
-I can't help it.
-Kathy, please.

438
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:06,729
I'll tell Bernice. I'll tell her Saturday night,
after the wedding.

439
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:17,569
Jerry, how would you like
to take Susan's cousin to the wedding?

440
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,507
-A cousin? Are you kidding?
-He'll do it. He doesn't have a date.

441
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:24,647
You're both single.
Who knows? You might hit it off.

442
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:29,211
Wait a minute. I know it's your wedding,
but Saturday night's a Saturday night.

443
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:32,587
Why shouldn't I score?
I don't want to waste a Saturday night.

444
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:35,183
Of course she's great-looking.
Just your type.

445
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:39,357
-I don't like to gamble.
-Why don't you take her for a drink tonight?

446
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:42,900
-Okay, if you think I can score.
-That's entirely up to you.

447
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:45,494
-What's up to him?
-Where they meet.

448
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,773
She can meet you tonight.

449
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:53,141
She better not be a dog.
There's 10,000 chicks waiting for my body.

450
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:54,372
Where?

451
00:31:55,615 --> 00:31:58,083
You tell her where. Here's Brenda.

452
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,923
Hello, Jerry. This is Brenda.

453
00:32:08,461 --> 00:32:12,261
-Hello, Brenda. This is Jerry.
-Where?

454
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:15,130
-The action place.
-Where?

455
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:20,603
Alan's on Greenwich Street. 9:00 sharp.

456
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,973
Fine. Bye, Jerry.

457
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:28,574
He has a strong voice.

458
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,039
Very masculine.

459
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,334
What'll it be?

460
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:31,935
A gin and coke.

461
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:34,639
-Together?
-Yeah.

462
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:36,942
Smooth.

463
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,767
-Jerry?
-Brenda?

464
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,668
Come on. Let's go over to the bar.

465
00:34:03,743 --> 00:34:06,007
-All right.
-All right, Brenda?

466
00:34:06,946 --> 00:34:10,609
It's very nice of you to ask me for a drink
when you don't know me.

467
00:34:10,683 --> 00:34:12,548
A man's got to gamble.

468
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,419
Excuse me.

469
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:27,764
-What are you going to have?
-Same as you.

470
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,260
Same.

471
00:34:31,304 --> 00:34:33,932
So you're Susan's cousin?

472
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:39,967
We're close. We went through
the Columbia riots together.

473
00:34:40,046 --> 00:34:43,072
-You went to Columbia?
-No, I was just an outside agitator.

474
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:44,616
That's heavy.

475
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:49,280
There's a table.
Come on, we'll be more comfortable.

476
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:51,118
I'll get the drinks.

477
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,490
Excuse me.

478
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,664
Excuse us.

479
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:06,070
Here we are.

480
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,737
This is much more intimate.

481
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,979
I love out-of-town weddings, don't you?

482
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:23,952
The ride over, the sleepover....

483
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:28,287
-Mike and Susan are really lucky.
-ln a way...

484
00:35:28,361 --> 00:35:32,229
but I'm not sure if I dig
the whole marriage scene.

485
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:36,661
It's all right for some people, I guess.
But I don't know if it's today.

486
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:38,897
You know what I mean, "today"? Today.

487
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:43,465
Today is, you live free. Man, woman, love....

488
00:35:45,011 --> 00:35:47,445
You don't need a diploma, do you?

489
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:52,150
In a way you might be right.

490
00:35:52,218 --> 00:35:54,778
This friend of mine was going
with this Cuban guy...

491
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:58,654
who knew this girl who had a friend
who used to date Che Guevara.

492
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,624
He was really down on marriage, too.

493
00:36:00,693 --> 00:36:02,217
-Did you see the movie?
-No.

494
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:04,194
-Me, neither.
-I think he made a mistake.

495
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:05,560
-Che?
-No, the bartender.

496
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:10,068
-He put in gin instead of rum.
-No, that's what I ordered. Gin and coke.

497
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:19,643
Have you always been single?

498
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:22,203
Name me one married couple
you know that's happy.

499
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:23,543
The Burtons.

500
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,641
-You know the Burtons?
-Not exactly...

501
00:36:25,718 --> 00:36:28,915
but one day
I was sitting in Ryker's Restaurant...

502
00:36:28,988 --> 00:36:31,957
and her chauffeur came in
to get her a container of coffee...

503
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:34,049
and I saw her sitting in the limousine.

504
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:37,584
Let me tell you something.
She looked very content.

505
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:47,137
I never take a blind date. Never.
But this time I'm glad I did.

506
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:51,905
You're even better than Mike said you were.
You know what you are?

507
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:55,936
-You're not disappointed?
-Not me. No, sir.

508
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,881
-My God.
-What's the matter?

509
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:09,587
I left the gas on in my apartment.
The whole apartment is liable to blow up.

510
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:13,096
Do you mind?
I don't know how I could have done that.

511
00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:20,004
-Did you read this month's Cosmopolitan?
-No.

512
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:23,701
Helen Gurley Brown
says that if you go to a man's apartment...

513
00:37:23,776 --> 00:37:27,268
after just beginning a relationship,
you're just asking for trouble.

514
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:29,075
-Really?
-But I don't agree.

515
00:37:29,148 --> 00:37:31,241
How can you generalize
about a thing like that?

516
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:32,409
Right.

517
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:36,182
Who you are, who the person is,
and what your particular needs are...

518
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:38,246
can't help but color your true feelings.

519
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:41,259
-That's why I'll wait for you out here.
-What?

520
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:43,420
-I'd rather wait for you out here.
-Why?

521
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:45,726
I don't feel like going
to a person's apartment...

522
00:37:45,798 --> 00:37:47,197
when I hardly know the person.

523
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:50,497
Not that anything's going to happen.
It's just the idea of the thing.

524
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:53,197
-You know what I mean.
-But I told you, it's just the gas.

525
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:56,639
Gas. Really, how corny can you get?

526
00:37:57,843 --> 00:38:01,711
Corny? You smoking? No smoking inside.
Move out of the way.

527
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:05,217
Cover yourself.
The whole building could blow up.

528
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,050
You ready?

529
00:38:10,923 --> 00:38:13,653
My God! It is gas.

530
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:24,970
It's lucky we came back.

531
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:35,639
-I'm sorry. I thought....
-No, I understand.

532
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:44,286
What a nice decor.

533
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,721
Sends off very good vibrations.
Very masculine. How much?

534
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:51,228
-$165.
-Gas and electric included?

535
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:52,355
Yes.

536
00:38:56,535 --> 00:39:00,995
As long as we're here,
why don't we sit down for a while and talk?

537
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:03,769
-About what?
-Life.

538
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:06,970
Life? Okay.

539
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:18,780
-Can I make you a martini?
-No, thanks. I had enough at the bar.

540
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:21,155
How about some pistachio nuts?

541
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,029
They're very good.

542
00:39:58,297 --> 00:40:00,697
-How do you feel about pot?
-Pot?

543
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:04,867
I definitely think it should be legalized.

544
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:07,230
The only reason I personally don't take it...

545
00:40:07,306 --> 00:40:10,469
is because I don't think
a person should use an outside stimulus...

546
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:13,409
when they could be turned on by the world.

547
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,449
Brenda, let me tell you something about pot.

548
00:40:18,017 --> 00:40:19,882
When you take it...

549
00:40:19,952 --> 00:40:25,322
your taste buds become so vividly sensitive
that a grapefruit tastes like caviar.

550
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:29,760
Your whole ability to touch, to love, to see,
to understand...

551
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:32,353
to feel, to know, is magnified...

552
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:35,059
till you could split the universe open
like a walnut...

553
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:36,328
and know its secrets.

554
00:40:36,402 --> 00:40:39,235
-Okay, let me have some.
-I don't have any.

555
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:46,939
I had some. I used it this morning
when I was cooking.

556
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,948
Because of the fuzz. Didn't want them
to catch it. I made an omelet.

557
00:40:56,221 --> 00:41:00,658
Do you believe the man is the love object
and the woman is the other?

558
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:01,784
What?

559
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,091
Did you read
The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir?

560
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:07,496
-No.
-That's what Simone says...

561
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:10,734
but I don't agree.
Why do I have to be the other?

562
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:14,466
I have as much right
to be the love object as the man does.

563
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,565
-What do you think?
-Okay.

564
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:22,441
-ls your building rent-controlled?
-No.

565
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:23,981
-How much do you pay?
-$150.

566
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:27,951
Could you please take your hand off?
I'd like to cross my legs.

567
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:35,693
Brenda, take off your clothes.
Take off all your clothes.

568
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:39,356
-What? You kidding?
-I'm kidding. Of course I'm kidding.

569
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:45,565
Can I speak frankly?

570
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:52,933
This friend of mine was going with this chap
she picked up in Central Park, at the zoo...

571
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:55,410
and she spent the whole weekend with him.

572
00:41:55,481 --> 00:41:59,383
It was a very full two and one-half days.
You know what I mean by full?

573
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:02,113
Full? Yeah. You mean full.

574
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,087
Right. The sexual thing was there...

575
00:42:04,156 --> 00:42:06,716
but don't get me wrong,
so was the spirituality.

576
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:09,784
-Did you read The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran?
-No.

577
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:12,956
"l am you, and you are me, and we are one."

578
00:42:13,332 --> 00:42:14,697
They were one.

579
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:18,225
At his house, her house,
all over town, they were one.

580
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:23,601
He was supposed to call her Monday.
A whole week goes by and he doesn't call.

581
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:28,679
So next Friday she bumps into him again,
same place, in front of the snake house.

582
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:31,614
So he says, "Let's go to my place."

583
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:35,052
Can you imagine?
When he hadn't even called?

584
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:39,183
-Terrible.
-lt was a very full two and one-half days.

585
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:42,520
But you want
to hear something really depressing?

586
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:47,190
Not only didn't this guy call her,
he never even bought her a coke.

587
00:42:49,468 --> 00:42:52,096
I could never respect a man like that.

588
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:56,298
-You know what I mean, Jerry?
-Yes.

589
00:42:57,209 --> 00:42:58,699
-Do you?
-Yes.

590
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:03,674
Brenda, where are you going?

591
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:07,875
What are you doing? What's the matter?

592
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:10,319
-Will you take me home, Jerry?
-But why?

593
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:13,688
I don't want to end up like my friend,
the one in the zoo.

594
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:16,057
But we were having such a nice time.

595
00:43:16,128 --> 00:43:17,254
Okay.

596
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:33,467
-You don't have to take me home, Jer.
-No, that's all right. That's okay.

597
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:37,106
I do like you, but this is our first date...

598
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:39,946
and I don't believe
in fooling around on the first date.

599
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:43,317
That may be old-fashioned,
but those are my values.

600
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:47,118
-You understand?
-Of course I understand. I respect them.

601
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:51,357
After all, there are more important things
in life than sex.

602
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:54,892
Thank you, Jerry.

603
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:09,142
I know we met just a couple of hours ago,
but just what do I mean to you?

604
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:12,411
Am I just a passing train
you want to board for the night...

605
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,679
or are you attracted to my inner being...

606
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:18,689
and this night could be the start
of a meaningful relationship?

607
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:21,316
The second one.

608
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:38,100
Thank you for taking me home, Jerry.

609
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:41,806
-But, Brenda--
-You'll see. You'll be glad we waited.

610
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:46,541
Listen, I'll....

611
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:56,359
-Hello, Father. It's Beatrice Vecchio.
-Hello, Beatrice.

612
00:44:56,562 --> 00:44:58,723
I hope the weather holds up
for Mike's wedding.

613
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:01,459
I hope so, too, Father.
Mike's such a good boy.

614
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,764
And now he has the perfect girl
from a nice Catholic family.

615
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:06,736
Never had a problem with Mike.

616
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:10,297
Now this thing with Ritchie.
Did he happen to mention to you...

617
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,935
anything about this business
with him and Joan?

618
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:16,708
You know I'm not allowed to divulge
what's said in the confessional.

619
00:45:16,782 --> 00:45:19,546
I'm sorry, Father.
Would you like to hear my confession now?

620
00:45:19,618 --> 00:45:22,280
-lf you wish.
-Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

621
00:45:22,354 --> 00:45:25,050
It's been three days since
my last confession.

622
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:29,787
I listened to gossip twice,
and I exaggerated four times...

623
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:34,624
and I lied to my husband when I told him
that I couldn't make homemade macaroni...

624
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,635
because I burned my hand
and couldn't roll the dough...

625
00:45:37,703 --> 00:45:40,695
but actually I could have.
It was a small burn...

626
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:43,764
and I could have rolled the dough,
but I wasn't in the mood.

627
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:47,141
I usually make the dough
the day before, anyway...

628
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:49,339
then leave it overnight in a cool room.

629
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:53,544
-I see. You say one "Our Father"--
-And I said "hell" twice...

630
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:57,255
and I yelled at the insurance man...

631
00:45:57,756 --> 00:46:02,557
and I didn't apologize to my sister Pauline
for not answering her phone call.

632
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:08,663
Should I confess that I asked you
to divulge Ritchie's confession?

633
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:12,096
I don't remember you asking.

634
00:46:13,405 --> 00:46:17,603
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

635
00:46:18,477 --> 00:46:22,470
It's been about five or six years
since my last confession.

636
00:46:23,382 --> 00:46:26,180
What made you come after all these years?

637
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:30,980
My son, Michael,
is getting married Saturday...

638
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,753
I figured it's a nice gesture for the parents...

639
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:36,987
to receive communion.

640
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,625
That's why l....

641
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:42,925
-You know.
-I see.

642
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:45,902
And what were your sins during that time?

643
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:48,830
I swore a lot at my wife...

644
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:53,503
and I didn't come to church on Sundays
because I got bursitis in my knee...

645
00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:56,678
and it hurts a lot when I kneel too long.

646
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:01,677
-Yes?
-What?

647
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:03,920
Six years is a long time.

648
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:06,753
Is there something else you'd like
to confess?

649
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:08,349
No, that's it.

650
00:47:30,716 --> 00:47:32,946
Have we tried enough for you?

651
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:37,948
-I'll miss you tonight.
-Come on. It's only for one night.

652
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:56,173
I'm going to miss you, too.

653
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:08,581
Let's have our honeymoon now.

654
00:48:09,388 --> 00:48:11,447
Name it. I'll go anywhere.

655
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:14,989
The bridal suite of the Stoneridge lnn.

656
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:19,394
-You wouldn't. You're too straight.
-Try me.

657
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,831
Beautiful.

658
00:48:25,771 --> 00:48:30,208
-You're still going to marry me?
-I'll let you know after the honeymoon.

659
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:57,866
We'd like the bridal suite.

660
00:48:57,936 --> 00:49:00,666
-The bridal suite?
-We're just married.

661
00:49:02,841 --> 00:49:05,674
-How long will you be staying?
-One night.

662
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:10,844
I can let you have it, then.
But you'll have to be out in the morning.

663
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:13,077
We have a wedding reception
in the afternoon.

664
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:14,743
The Henderson wedding.

665
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:16,820
We'll be out.

666
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:26,059
Would you like to sign "Mrs."?

667
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:33,794
It's the first time.

668
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:43,139
The bridal suite for Mr. and Mrs. Defalco.

669
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:31,524
Do you believe this?

670
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,415
This is our honeymoon night.
Let's go to bed.

671
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,989
I'm not coming out till I'm married.

672
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:07,203
-Hi, Phyllis.
-Hi, Nick.

673
00:56:10,602 --> 00:56:13,127
You're the most beautiful girl
at the wedding.

674
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,069
-Are you married?
-Yes.

675
00:56:17,408 --> 00:56:19,137
You looked so beautiful at the church.

676
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:22,577
Phil and I are having a terrific time
at the wedding.

677
00:56:24,168 --> 00:56:25,863
Hello, Kim. Hello, Carol.

678
00:56:25,936 --> 00:56:28,871
Carol's agreed
to sing anytime you want her to, Bernice.

679
00:56:28,939 --> 00:56:31,737
How nice. Hal, did you hear that?
Carol's agreed to sing.

680
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:33,799
Yes. Later, little girl.

681
00:56:44,121 --> 00:56:47,056
You look thin and worn-out, Johnny.

682
00:56:47,824 --> 00:56:51,624
-ls Wilma taking good care of you?
-Fine, mama.

683
00:56:51,962 --> 00:56:54,192
That old bitch never lets go.

684
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:04,068
In his Analysis of Compatible Marriages,
Wilhelm Reiker says...

685
00:57:04,141 --> 00:57:08,305
that the problem of the mother-in-law
is dependent on the maturity of the wife.

686
00:57:08,378 --> 00:57:12,474
Wilhelm Reiker's a fag.
I'll tell you what marriage is all about.

687
00:57:12,816 --> 00:57:16,513
-That's what it's all about.
-They're beautiful boys.

688
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:20,122
-Where did you go on your honeymoon?
-Aruba.

689
00:57:21,992 --> 00:57:23,152
Aruba.

690
00:57:34,738 --> 00:57:38,174
-Want some more soup, Frank?
-Yeah.

691
00:57:56,193 --> 00:57:59,287
I'm getting worried, Frank.
Joan isn't here yet.

692
00:57:59,363 --> 00:58:03,026
-Don't worry about it. She'll get here.
-I hope so, Frank.

693
00:58:09,973 --> 00:58:12,999
-You must be Mike's roommate.
-No, Mom.

694
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:36,829
-Jerry, how about another drink?
-No, I better get back to my girl.

695
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:41,769
-I'm going to score tonight.
-ls she worth 20 years?

696
00:58:42,172 --> 00:58:46,040
Not her. Brenda.
The one sitting next to Wilma.

697
00:58:57,421 --> 00:58:58,683
Hi, Joan.

698
00:59:00,724 --> 00:59:03,659
I'm sorry I missed the wedding.
You look beautiful.

699
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:06,126
So do you.

700
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:20,868
-How'd you come up?
-Train.

701
00:59:21,578 --> 00:59:23,705
-Nice ride?
-Very nice, yeah.

702
00:59:24,881 --> 00:59:29,443
What did I tell you, Frank?
Weddings bring out the best in everybody.

703
00:59:30,387 --> 00:59:34,221
-Why did you miss the wedding?
-I wasn't going to come at all.

704
00:59:34,524 --> 00:59:37,425
-Did you tell your parents?
-Sort of.

705
00:59:38,128 --> 00:59:40,688
It's not right to keep their hopes up.

706
00:59:40,764 --> 00:59:43,392
You laughed at me
when I prayed to St. Rocco.

707
00:59:43,467 --> 00:59:46,095
He's the saint of fixing things.

708
00:59:46,169 --> 00:59:48,694
And he knows
that no matter what Ritchie says...

709
00:59:48,772 --> 00:59:53,004
that deep down in his heart he loves Joan,
and he'll always love her.

710
00:59:57,147 --> 00:59:58,273
We'll see.

711
01:00:11,695 --> 01:00:15,688
Jerry, I don't know if it's the champagne,
the wedding ceremony...

712
01:00:15,766 --> 01:00:18,701
Susan and Michael,
but do you feel what I feel?

713
01:00:18,769 --> 01:00:20,134
I felt it in New York.

714
01:00:20,203 --> 01:00:22,831
Jerry, I hoped you would,
but I never dreamed--

715
01:00:22,906 --> 01:00:26,899
-I know. Yes.
-Do you come from a large family?

716
01:00:26,977 --> 01:00:28,842
No, I'm an only child.

717
01:00:29,413 --> 01:00:32,712
Coming up in the car,
do you remember the little red farmhouse...

718
01:00:32,783 --> 01:00:35,081
with the big sheepdog sitting on the lawn?

719
01:00:35,152 --> 01:00:37,780
There must have been four
or five kids running around.

720
01:00:37,854 --> 01:00:40,084
Yes, I remember.
That's where we stopped for gas.

721
01:00:40,157 --> 01:00:43,183
-Don't you think that's the way to live?
-That's nice.

722
01:00:52,169 --> 01:00:56,868
-So what's the story, Joan?
-Didn't Ritchie tell you?

723
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,266
Not the whole story.

724
01:00:58,341 --> 01:01:01,276
He said you two
were having some compatible difficulties.

725
01:01:01,344 --> 01:01:05,041
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Believe me, it happens to the best of people.

726
01:01:05,115 --> 01:01:06,776
Shut up, Beatrice.

727
01:01:08,218 --> 01:01:12,279
-So what's the story, Joan?
-lt just comes down to this:

728
01:01:12,355 --> 01:01:14,949
Our problems are so overwhelming...

729
01:01:15,025 --> 01:01:17,994
because of all the hurts
and disillusionments...

730
01:01:18,061 --> 01:01:20,529
that have built up over the years.

731
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:28,133
Everybody's got problems.
Take a look at this wedding, Joan.

732
01:01:28,472 --> 01:01:31,999
Everybody's carefree
and having the time of their lives.

733
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:36,308
Anthony and Anita, cheek to cheek.

734
01:01:36,379 --> 01:01:39,678
Anthony has not said one word to Anita
for two years.

735
01:01:39,749 --> 01:01:41,876
But they're still together.

736
01:01:42,686 --> 01:01:44,950
And David and Loretta kissing.

737
01:01:45,989 --> 01:01:48,685
You know what the people
in the family say about David.

738
01:01:48,758 --> 01:01:52,285
That he's a little funny.
You know what I mean? Peculiar?

739
01:01:52,362 --> 01:01:54,159
We don't really think he is.

740
01:01:54,931 --> 01:01:57,525
It's just his way...

741
01:01:57,601 --> 01:02:01,367
to lock himself up in his room
all day Sunday and play with his cats.

742
01:02:01,438 --> 01:02:04,100
-Who's to say the man's a degenerate?
-Or worse.

743
01:02:04,174 --> 01:02:08,440
-But they're still together.
-Carmel and Vinny hugging.

744
01:02:08,912 --> 01:02:11,574
When Vinny and Carmel first got married...

745
01:02:11,648 --> 01:02:14,913
they lived with Vinny's parents
because he was out of work a lot...

746
01:02:14,985 --> 01:02:19,183
and Carmel was always being picked on
by Vinny's mother.

747
01:02:19,389 --> 01:02:23,018
She used to blame Carmel
for Vinny's laziness.

748
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:26,454
One night, Carmel told Vinny...

749
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:29,897
that if his mother made one more remark,
she was going to smack her.

750
01:02:29,966 --> 01:02:32,901
And Vinny started yelling,
"Don't you dare lay a hand on her."

751
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:35,733
Carmel said, "Go to hell, both of you,"
and stomped out.

752
01:02:35,805 --> 01:02:38,831
Vinny chased her down the block
and grabbed her by the hair.

753
01:02:38,909 --> 01:02:40,968
And Carmel spit right in Vinny's face.

754
01:02:41,044 --> 01:02:44,070
Then he started choking her
by the throat over the open window.

755
01:02:44,147 --> 01:02:46,741
And the super had to come up
and pick Vinny off Carmel.

756
01:02:46,816 --> 01:02:48,909
And they're still together.

757
01:02:49,252 --> 01:02:52,813
I don't want somebody pointing
to Joan and me in a couple of years...

758
01:02:52,889 --> 01:02:56,188
telling some miserable story ending with
"But they're still together."

759
01:02:56,259 --> 01:02:57,556
You understand?

760
01:02:59,296 --> 01:03:02,231
-So what's the story, Joan?
-Won't you ever give up?

761
01:03:02,299 --> 01:03:06,292
-Not till I get the story.
-My birthday, for instance.

762
01:03:06,436 --> 01:03:09,462
-Do we have to go through that again?
-What about your birthday?

763
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:12,599
I asked Ritchie
to get me a book for my birthday.

764
01:03:12,676 --> 01:03:15,975
-What kind of book?
-lt was a book about Spain.

765
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:17,911
You know, with colored photographs.

766
01:03:17,981 --> 01:03:22,441
-I've always had this big thing about Spain.
-They don't get divorced in Spain.

767
01:03:24,054 --> 01:03:25,988
A book, to me, means love...

768
01:03:26,056 --> 01:03:29,355
because when you give a book
about a romantic place...

769
01:03:29,426 --> 01:03:33,920
it's like saying that all the days of your life
should be as romantic as Spain...

770
01:03:33,997 --> 01:03:36,932
and surrounded by a cover of happiness.

771
01:03:39,169 --> 01:03:41,603
So I mentioned to Ritchie that I wanted it.

772
01:03:41,671 --> 01:03:44,105
That's all she talked about day and night
for a month.

773
01:03:44,174 --> 01:03:47,405
You always forget my birthdays.
I reminded you, that's all.

774
01:03:47,477 --> 01:03:50,275
Maybe I felt like getting you
something better than a book.

775
01:03:50,347 --> 01:03:55,080
-Yes, but this time I wanted a book.
-So what did you get her for her birthday?

776
01:03:55,352 --> 01:03:58,082
-Nothing. I forgot what day it was.
-You always forget.

777
01:03:58,154 --> 01:03:59,587
Frank, you're the same way.

778
01:03:59,656 --> 01:04:02,682
Maybe you make such
a big thing out of it that I want to forget.

779
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:06,286
-I can't see the logic in that.
-I said, "Be sure to get me a can opener."

780
01:04:06,363 --> 01:04:10,424
I got you the book, anyway, didn't l?
I got her the book, anyway, didn't l?

781
01:04:11,501 --> 01:04:12,525
For Christ's sake!

782
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:15,628
What I'm trying to find out is,
what's the story?

783
01:04:27,884 --> 01:04:30,216
I see the party's petering out.

784
01:04:47,937 --> 01:04:49,996
-Jerry, do you know--
-Yes.

785
01:04:58,048 --> 01:05:01,449
Do you know where Mike and Susan
are going on their honeymoon?

786
01:05:02,118 --> 01:05:03,380
Isle of Aruba.

787
01:05:03,453 --> 01:05:07,116
Aruba's all right. I personally like Trinidad.

788
01:05:07,857 --> 01:05:09,222
Trinidad?

789
01:05:30,914 --> 01:05:32,472
What are you doing?

790
01:05:32,549 --> 01:05:36,508
It's these new locks. This is my room.

791
01:05:40,356 --> 01:05:41,846
This is my bed.

792
01:05:42,826 --> 01:05:44,953
That's my rug and my chair.

793
01:06:06,082 --> 01:06:09,210
-Are you close with your family?
-My family?

794
01:06:09,452 --> 01:06:12,114
I see my family on holidays, weekends.

795
01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:16,616
I love a man that loves his mother.

796
01:06:16,693 --> 01:06:19,161
Mother? I love my mother.

797
01:06:20,196 --> 01:06:21,686
Do I love my mother.

798
01:06:22,165 --> 01:06:24,793
I think we should go back to the wedding.

799
01:06:24,868 --> 01:06:27,803
Back to the wedding?
Why? They won't miss us.

800
01:06:29,205 --> 01:06:32,174
Did you read The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran?

801
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:35,336
Yes. I know.
"l am you, you are me, we are one."

802
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:41,139
I think it's too soon for us to be one, Jerry.

803
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:45,948
When two people feel about each other
the way we feel about each other...

804
01:06:46,022 --> 01:06:48,217
it's never too soon to be one.

805
01:06:52,228 --> 01:06:56,255
-You think I'm being too middle-class?
-You said it.

806
01:06:58,835 --> 01:07:00,826
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

807
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,634
-Let's go to my room!
-What?

808
01:07:09,212 --> 01:07:11,305
-Let's go to my room.
-What for?

809
01:07:11,381 --> 01:07:14,839
I just feel freer there.
Somebody might walk in on us.

810
01:07:14,918 --> 01:07:18,354
Nobody's going to walk in on us.
I have the door locked from the inside.

811
01:07:18,421 --> 01:07:22,050
I just don't feel I can let it go here
the way it wants to be let go.

812
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:24,559
All right. We'll go where you can let it go.

813
01:07:24,627 --> 01:07:26,060
Yes. Let's go.

814
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:28,427
-Okay. I'll go first.
-Okay. You go first.

815
01:07:28,498 --> 01:07:30,864
Wait five minutes and then come.

816
01:07:32,535 --> 01:07:34,264
Put your jacket on.

817
01:07:34,504 --> 01:07:37,769
And don't turn on the light
until I'm out the door.

818
01:07:40,276 --> 01:07:42,267
All right. Five minutes.

819
01:08:12,675 --> 01:08:14,267
Why do we fight?

820
01:08:17,747 --> 01:08:20,944
I don't know, honey. We must be crazy.

821
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:26,486
We've got so much going for us.
We really love each other.

822
01:08:26,556 --> 01:08:28,319
What makes us do it?

823
01:08:29,425 --> 01:08:33,521
-We should be like this all the time.
-Yeah, I guess you're right.

824
01:08:34,297 --> 01:08:38,996
I can't think of any married couple
that has as much going for them as we do.

825
01:08:39,502 --> 01:08:41,493
What makes us fight like that?

826
01:08:41,571 --> 01:08:44,563
We should try to remember
so it never happens again.

827
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:48,006
I think it all started
when you said I was faggy.

828
01:08:49,145 --> 01:08:50,737
Did I say that?

829
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:54,877
You know I think you're the most
masculine man I ever met.

830
01:08:59,355 --> 01:09:02,620
I guess I was just hurt
because you called me Willy.

831
01:09:02,992 --> 01:09:06,621
You must admit that it's really butch
to call somebody faggy.

832
01:09:06,696 --> 01:09:09,563
You shouldn't have told me
you were dynamite with other women.

833
01:09:09,632 --> 01:09:11,896
But you had just implied I was impotent.

834
01:09:11,968 --> 01:09:13,595
Yes, but you said all--

835
01:09:14,137 --> 01:09:16,765
All I'm interested in is getting mine.

836
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,705
Aren't you?

837
01:09:24,714 --> 01:09:26,113
Aren't you?

838
01:09:26,849 --> 01:09:29,716
You see, honey,
that's the kind of thing that starts it off.

839
01:09:29,786 --> 01:09:31,219
You going tit for tat.

840
01:09:31,287 --> 01:09:33,812
-I'm not going tit for tat.
-Yes, you are.

841
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:35,619
Stop it, John.

842
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:39,285
Want to know why you can't stand
for me to have the last word?

843
01:09:39,362 --> 01:09:40,989
Because you seem to have forgotten...

844
01:09:41,064 --> 01:09:44,158
that I am the man
and you are just the woman...

845
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:46,335
and the man is the boss.

846
01:09:54,844 --> 01:09:56,106
Says who?

847
01:09:56,846 --> 01:10:00,282
-Says you, the day we were married.
-I was just humoring you.

848
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:03,717
I said if it was so important to you,
I would let you be the boss.

849
01:10:03,786 --> 01:10:06,482
What do you mean,
you would let me be the boss?

850
01:10:06,689 --> 01:10:10,750
-I am the boss.
-Don't be juvenile. There is no boss.

851
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:15,864
-I'm the boss, and you know it.
-There is no boss, and that's final.

852
01:10:15,932 --> 01:10:18,366
And I don't want
to hear another word about it.

853
01:10:18,434 --> 01:10:19,901
We are equal.

854
01:10:21,204 --> 01:10:25,038
-You and I are equal?
-That's right.

855
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:29,410
-Come on, equal. Put them up.
-What?

856
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:31,947
Come on, I'll knock you right off.

857
01:10:37,453 --> 01:10:39,387
I'm sorry. I didn't....

858
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:43,290
-Come on, who's the boss?
-Will you stop it?

859
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:44,849
-Who's the boss?
-There's no boss.

860
01:10:44,927 --> 01:10:46,622
-Who's the boss?
-I am.

861
01:10:46,696 --> 01:10:48,664
-Who's the boss?
-You're hurting me.

862
01:10:48,731 --> 01:10:50,824
You're going to wake up the child.

863
01:10:51,367 --> 01:10:55,497
-Who's the boss?
-You can torture me, but I won't say it.

864
01:10:55,571 --> 01:10:57,596
-Who's the boss?
-You are.

865
01:10:57,807 --> 01:10:59,741
-Let go of me.
-And who won?

866
01:10:59,809 --> 01:11:01,470
You did.

867
01:11:03,713 --> 01:11:05,180
You shithead.

868
01:11:28,404 --> 01:11:29,598
Who is it?

869
01:11:29,672 --> 01:11:31,196
-It's me.
-Who?

870
01:11:31,307 --> 01:11:33,775
Brenda, will you let me in? It's Jerry.

871
01:11:40,383 --> 01:11:42,146
Brenda, I want you.

872
01:11:45,955 --> 01:11:47,946
Do you think we're doing the right thing?

873
01:11:48,024 --> 01:11:51,585
Yes, we're doing the right thing.

874
01:11:54,964 --> 01:11:57,364
-Will there be a victim?
-What?

875
01:11:57,433 --> 01:12:00,334
Did you read
Kurt Vonnegut's The Sirens of Titan?

876
01:12:00,403 --> 01:12:01,665
I didn't have a chance to.

877
01:12:01,737 --> 01:12:05,605
He says, "l was the victim
of a series of accidents, as are we all."

878
01:12:05,675 --> 01:12:09,111
-Will there be a victim with us?
-No, there'll be no victim.

879
01:12:09,178 --> 01:12:13,774
-Could you help out a little here?
-Jerry, this isn't right.

880
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:17,616
-The middle of a wedding.
-That's what makes it so exciting.

881
01:12:20,523 --> 01:12:23,720
-Then let's go back to your room.
-What?

882
01:12:24,293 --> 01:12:27,490
-Let's go back to your room.
-What for?

883
01:12:28,498 --> 01:12:31,934
I don't want anyone seeing you
come out of my room in the morning.

884
01:12:32,001 --> 01:12:34,196
They'll think we spent the night together.

885
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:37,467
What are they going to think
if they see you coming out of my room?

886
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:39,804
That's different.
I'm never sure what happened...

887
01:12:39,876 --> 01:12:42,970
when I see a girl come out of a man's room.

888
01:12:43,246 --> 01:12:47,478
Please, Jerry. For me. For Brenda.

889
01:12:47,917 --> 01:12:49,782
But we're here already.

890
01:12:55,191 --> 01:12:57,022
Brenda, take it easy.

891
01:14:16,505 --> 01:14:18,370
I'm not happy, Johnny.

892
01:14:18,441 --> 01:14:21,410
The only woman you ever loved
is your mother.

893
01:14:21,777 --> 01:14:23,108
Watch it, Wilma.

894
01:14:23,179 --> 01:14:26,239
It seems to me,
if you're so frightened of being castrated...

895
01:14:26,315 --> 01:14:29,716
you should go to the source of your fear
and then work it out with her.

896
01:14:29,785 --> 01:14:31,719
That's right. Then you and your father...

897
01:14:31,787 --> 01:14:34,881
should make a special call
on your grandmother.

898
01:14:40,196 --> 01:14:43,723
-Where do you think you're going?
-Away from your mouth.

899
01:14:46,969 --> 01:14:49,267
-No, you don't.
-Yeah? Try and stop me.

900
01:14:49,538 --> 01:14:51,369
-Get away from me.
-Johnny, please.

901
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,465
Will you get away from me?

902
01:15:10,126 --> 01:15:11,354
Get away from me.

903
01:15:11,427 --> 01:15:14,089
-Was it something I said?
-Come on. Will you knock it off?

904
01:15:14,163 --> 01:15:17,360
Please, let's work this out. Look, I'm upset.

905
01:15:17,433 --> 01:15:20,266
Are you kidding?
Will you quit acting helpless?

906
01:15:20,336 --> 01:15:23,305
-You're like a rock.
-Okay, then get out of my life.

907
01:15:23,372 --> 01:15:25,966
-Get out.
-Don't worry, I'm going.

908
01:15:26,142 --> 01:15:29,703
-Soon as I get the key in the door.
-All right. Go.

909
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:37,210
Where do you think you're going?
No, you're not going--

910
01:15:41,123 --> 01:15:43,683
Why did you make me hit you?
I didn't want to hit you.

911
01:15:43,759 --> 01:15:46,853
I never hit a woman in my life till I met you.

912
01:15:47,797 --> 01:15:50,960
Johnny, I'm sorry. I feel awful.

913
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,269
Just awful. I'm sorry. Do you forgive me?

914
01:15:54,337 --> 01:15:57,033
You started it. You called me a shithead.

915
01:15:57,106 --> 01:15:59,336
I didn't mean it. Please.

916
01:15:59,408 --> 01:16:02,741
Please forgive me.
I'll never be able to forgive myself.

917
01:16:02,812 --> 01:16:04,336
It's my sister's wedding.

918
01:16:04,413 --> 01:16:07,075
We were going to be so happy.
I ruined everything.

919
01:16:07,149 --> 01:16:08,844
Please forgive me.

920
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:13,479
-Who's the man?
-You are.

921
01:16:13,556 --> 01:16:15,547
-And who's the woman?
-Me.

922
01:16:16,292 --> 01:16:18,021
And who's the boss?

923
01:16:20,162 --> 01:16:23,620
I really think you should give that up.
It's a very baby thing.

924
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:27,066
If you want me to have a happy marriage
and you want to be my friend...

925
01:16:27,136 --> 01:16:30,765
then you've got to acknowledge
that the man is the stronger one.

926
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,365
You have to surrender to me.

927
01:16:33,743 --> 01:16:36,109
Then I'll be king of the jungle.

928
01:16:37,213 --> 01:16:39,681
But as king I will rule tenderly.

929
01:16:40,349 --> 01:16:44,012
But I can't rule tenderly
until you surrender to me first.

930
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,985
Okay, I surrender. Now make up with me.

931
01:16:50,693 --> 01:16:53,161
Isn't he adorable?

932
01:16:55,364 --> 01:16:59,027
You're my great, big, strong...

933
01:16:59,135 --> 01:17:01,467
teddy bear king...

934
01:17:01,704 --> 01:17:03,228
what I loves...

935
01:17:03,639 --> 01:17:07,405
and I'm the little surrendering baby bear...

936
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:09,239
what you loves.

937
01:17:12,281 --> 01:17:13,270
What?

938
01:17:13,783 --> 01:17:14,772
Okay.

939
01:17:18,087 --> 01:17:21,420
Give a woof. Come on.

940
01:17:29,532 --> 01:17:31,500
Does you woof me?

941
01:17:32,401 --> 01:17:35,393
Honey, I woof, woof you.

942
01:17:43,546 --> 01:17:47,505
"Sometimes I look at a man
and he's a chair, a rock, a tree."

943
01:17:48,784 --> 01:17:52,276
-What?
-It's what Monica Vitti said in L'Avventura.

944
01:18:33,195 --> 01:18:34,594
Let's rest.

945
01:18:34,864 --> 01:18:36,661
What for? We haven't done anything.

946
01:18:36,732 --> 01:18:40,395
Please. I'd like a moment
to reflect about things.

947
01:18:40,469 --> 01:18:41,868
What things?

948
01:18:45,474 --> 01:18:47,465
Would you stroke my hair?

949
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:49,134
Not like that.

950
01:18:49,378 --> 01:18:50,709
Like this.

951
01:18:55,317 --> 01:18:56,477
Feels nice.

952
01:18:56,619 --> 01:18:58,052
-Jerry?
-Yes?

953
01:18:58,254 --> 01:19:01,121
-Shall I tell you how I feel?
-Yes, Brenda.

954
01:19:01,524 --> 01:19:06,154
I feel that I'm queen of the universe.

955
01:19:07,129 --> 01:19:11,259
The waves part, and they engulf me...

956
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:14,100
and the seafoam is warm.

957
01:19:18,407 --> 01:19:19,999
Kiss me.

958
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:25,312
-How do you feel?
-Warm. Warm like the seafoam.

959
01:19:25,381 --> 01:19:27,508
-Then tell me.
-What?

960
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:30,177
-That I am yours.
-You are mine.

961
01:19:31,921 --> 01:19:35,186
Thank you. Say it again.

962
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:40,861
Look, can we stop all this talking?
What is all this talking? Let's just do it.

963
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:42,420
-Do it?
-Come on.

964
01:19:42,498 --> 01:19:45,365
-Do what? I don't follow.
-What do you mean, you don't follow?

965
01:19:45,434 --> 01:19:48,232
-You know what I mean.
-No, I don't. What?

966
01:19:48,904 --> 01:19:50,997
-Sex.
-Sex?

967
01:19:52,374 --> 01:19:54,604
That's all it is to you? Sex?

968
01:19:55,477 --> 01:19:58,412
I love you. I opened myself to you...

969
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:02,075
and you led me to believe
we had something good, something real.

970
01:20:02,151 --> 01:20:03,914
What do you mean, I led you to believe?

971
01:20:03,986 --> 01:20:06,819
I just thought
we were going to have a little fun.

972
01:20:07,756 --> 01:20:11,123
What about
the little red farmhouse and the sheepdog?

973
01:20:11,193 --> 01:20:15,095
-What about Trinidad?
-Look, let's forget the whole thing.

974
01:20:15,164 --> 01:20:17,689
Okay, let's forget the whole thing.

975
01:20:19,468 --> 01:20:20,696
Thank you.

976
01:20:20,769 --> 01:20:24,637
Thank you for the sobering
and degrading experience.

977
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:32,140
Why don't I ever have any luck?
Either I get a girl, she gives me the brush...

978
01:20:32,214 --> 01:20:35,411
or she gives me a tease,
or I wind up with some nut.

979
01:20:35,484 --> 01:20:37,509
What's the matter with me?

980
01:20:39,822 --> 01:20:42,916
-Can I speak frankly?
-Yes.

981
01:20:45,494 --> 01:20:50,090
It's obvious that you're just a slave
to your erections.

982
01:20:53,135 --> 01:20:56,468
And what about you?
You don't love me. You never loved me.

983
01:20:56,538 --> 01:20:59,769
What you're in love with is this wedding,
and any usher would do.

984
01:20:59,842 --> 01:21:03,869
I've been a bridesmaid many times.
I was once even the maid of honor.

985
01:21:03,946 --> 01:21:05,675
Let me tell you something.

986
01:21:05,748 --> 01:21:09,775
This is the closest I've ever gotten
to any usher.

987
01:21:11,053 --> 01:21:13,487
-You mean that?
-Sure I mean that.

988
01:21:14,723 --> 01:21:18,181
You're not just any usher.

989
01:21:19,928 --> 01:21:21,452
You're special.

990
01:21:22,665 --> 01:21:24,496
-I am?
-Sure.

991
01:21:27,636 --> 01:21:29,126
What about me?

992
01:21:30,105 --> 01:21:31,629
What about you?

993
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:35,503
-Aren't I special?
-Yes.

994
01:21:36,245 --> 01:21:40,011
Yes, you're special. You're very special.

995
01:22:05,307 --> 01:22:07,867
So what happened?
You got something on the side...

996
01:22:07,943 --> 01:22:10,571
-and she found out about it?
-No, Pop.

997
01:22:14,683 --> 01:22:16,378
Come on. You can tell me.

998
01:22:16,452 --> 01:22:20,889
I never told you this before,
but I strayed, too, when I was young.

999
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:23,781
Don't get me wrong, I never looked for it...

1000
01:22:23,859 --> 01:22:26,794
but sometimes you're walking along
and it falls in your lap.

1001
01:22:26,862 --> 01:22:30,628
-Look, Pop, that's not the reason.
-lt happens to everybody.

1002
01:22:31,233 --> 01:22:36,102
I love your mother,
but sometimes you need a little stimulation.

1003
01:22:37,973 --> 01:22:40,407
Thank God she never felt that way.

1004
01:22:42,478 --> 01:22:46,574
But there was this one time
that your mother found out about it.

1005
01:22:47,249 --> 01:22:51,151
Her stupid sister Pauline
opened up her big mouth and told her.

1006
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,513
She walked out on me for four days,
but she came back.

1007
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:57,152
Where was she going to go?

1008
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,252
So what happened, Joan?
Some girl vamped him?

1009
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:05,096
-No.
-Joan, you can tell me...

1010
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:08,398
because all men stray, even Frank.

1011
01:23:08,971 --> 01:23:11,735
It's a mortal sin, but it happens.

1012
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:15,810
I left him for a few days, but I came back.

1013
01:23:17,112 --> 01:23:21,572
-Where was I going to go?
-Mother, Ritchie would never cheat on me.

1014
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:24,551
So what, Joan? Tell me, please.

1015
01:23:25,354 --> 01:23:29,188
Ever since I was 15,
I loved Ritchie from afar.

1016
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:33,416
And the whole time we went together,
I was just floating on air...

1017
01:23:33,495 --> 01:23:35,224
and we had so much fun together...

1018
01:23:35,297 --> 01:23:37,788
because we both loved the beach
and things.

1019
01:23:38,467 --> 01:23:40,901
We were always kissing and hugging.

1020
01:23:40,969 --> 01:23:44,370
Everyone said how great we looked
on the dance floor.

1021
01:23:44,706 --> 01:23:48,836
So I really thought we'd get married
and live happily ever after...

1022
01:23:49,244 --> 01:23:51,804
but I guess we just weren't that lucky.

1023
01:23:52,014 --> 01:23:56,451
I knew it was the real thing,
because I loved everything about him.

1024
01:23:56,685 --> 01:23:58,710
I loved the way he moved.

1025
01:23:58,987 --> 01:24:03,390
Sometimes I'd just spend hours and hours
and watch him move around.

1026
01:24:04,459 --> 01:24:06,393
And his hair....

1027
01:24:06,461 --> 01:24:08,588
You're going to think I'm crazy...

1028
01:24:09,665 --> 01:24:13,431
but I loved the way
his hair smelled like raisins.

1029
01:24:13,936 --> 01:24:16,427
When he kissed me, I never told him this...

1030
01:24:16,505 --> 01:24:18,871
but the best part about being in his arms...

1031
01:24:18,941 --> 01:24:22,035
was that I could get a good whiff of his hair.

1032
01:24:25,547 --> 01:24:29,847
I don't know if it's me
or Ritchie that's changed...

1033
01:24:31,086 --> 01:24:33,577
but it's just no big deal anymore...

1034
01:24:33,655 --> 01:24:36,419
to feel him or smell him.

1035
01:24:37,559 --> 01:24:40,824
I don't know, Pop.
I was too young when I got married.

1036
01:24:40,896 --> 01:24:43,729
I didn't know who I was or what I wanted.

1037
01:24:43,966 --> 01:24:46,526
When we first got married, we cared.

1038
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:49,667
We're strangers.

1039
01:24:57,346 --> 01:24:59,211
We're all strangers...

1040
01:24:59,514 --> 01:25:03,245
but after a while you get used to it.

1041
01:25:05,254 --> 01:25:08,712
You become deeper strangers.

1042
01:25:10,392 --> 01:25:13,793
-That's a sort of love.
-No, that's habit. I want more than that.

1043
01:25:13,862 --> 01:25:17,127
-More, more, everybody wants more.
-Why don't they go out and get it?

1044
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,667
-Because there is no more.
-There's got to be more.

1045
01:25:19,735 --> 01:25:20,827
More.

1046
01:25:27,542 --> 01:25:31,603
You think I don't understand
what you're talking about, don't you?

1047
01:25:32,514 --> 01:25:33,981
I understand.

1048
01:25:35,651 --> 01:25:38,984
There were times with your mother
when I thought...

1049
01:25:39,087 --> 01:25:43,285
maybe I didn't do justice to myself.
You know what I mean, Ritchie?

1050
01:25:44,059 --> 01:25:48,291
I love your mother, but I never thought
she was as intelligent as I am.

1051
01:25:48,563 --> 01:25:50,588
That used to bother me a lot.

1052
01:25:51,533 --> 01:25:55,264
Everybody wants to be married
to somebody on his own level.

1053
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:01,868
A couple of years
before I married your mother...

1054
01:26:01,944 --> 01:26:03,935
I met this schoolteacher.

1055
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,514
Her name was Mary Rose.

1056
01:26:09,751 --> 01:26:11,514
A real society girl.

1057
01:26:12,888 --> 01:26:16,085
We had everything in common,
the same interests...

1058
01:26:16,391 --> 01:26:19,292
the same mentality.

1059
01:26:20,729 --> 01:26:24,392
And I used to think that
if I had married Mary Rose...

1060
01:26:24,599 --> 01:26:28,729
maybe I wouldn't have yelled
and screamed so much around the house.

1061
01:26:29,604 --> 01:26:31,231
I figured that...

1062
01:26:33,408 --> 01:26:37,071
I would have been a different person
if I had married her.

1063
01:26:41,516 --> 01:26:44,007
But she wouldn't go out with me...

1064
01:26:45,153 --> 01:26:46,643
so I married your mother.

1065
01:26:47,689 --> 01:26:50,556
When I married Frank,
he was very handsome.

1066
01:26:51,626 --> 01:26:53,719
And clean. He was so clean.

1067
01:26:54,896 --> 01:26:59,424
That's why it came as a big shock to me
on my wedding night to find out...

1068
01:27:00,535 --> 01:27:04,130
what a physical person he was.
You know what I'm talking about, Joan?

1069
01:27:04,206 --> 01:27:06,572
-Sex.
-You said it, not me.

1070
01:27:07,709 --> 01:27:10,769
It's very hard for me
to talk about these things.

1071
01:27:10,846 --> 01:27:15,749
I was so nauseous on my wedding night
with you-know-who...

1072
01:27:15,817 --> 01:27:17,444
but I didn't say a word.

1073
01:27:17,519 --> 01:27:19,919
I just ran into the bathroom
and locked the door...

1074
01:27:19,988 --> 01:27:21,922
because I don't like to make a scene.

1075
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:26,051
-You mean, you never enjoyed sex?
-What's to enjoy?

1076
01:27:26,995 --> 01:27:29,793
Love isn't physical. Love is spiritual.

1077
01:27:30,198 --> 01:27:33,429
Like the great love that lngrid Bergman had
for Bing Crosby...

1078
01:27:33,502 --> 01:27:36,733
in The Bells of St. Mary
when she was a nun, and he was a priest...

1079
01:27:36,805 --> 01:27:39,365
and they loved each other from afar.

1080
01:27:39,875 --> 01:27:42,070
But Frank didn't want to know.

1081
01:27:43,845 --> 01:27:48,282
It's very hard for a man
to understand how a woman feels inside...

1082
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:50,978
although I tried to understand Frank.

1083
01:27:51,386 --> 01:27:54,480
Not that there's that much there
to understand.

1084
01:27:55,157 --> 01:27:57,523
That's why I was so hurt when he strayed.

1085
01:27:57,592 --> 01:28:00,561
But you know me, Joan.
I always try to look on the bright side.

1086
01:28:00,629 --> 01:28:02,494
I just said to myself:

1087
01:28:02,564 --> 01:28:05,362
"At least she's the one
who'll be nauseous now."

1088
01:28:06,902 --> 01:28:09,735
Your mother and I had what you'd call...

1089
01:28:09,805 --> 01:28:12,706
different sexuality outlooks.

1090
01:28:14,943 --> 01:28:18,640
Don't get me wrong, nothing abnormal.
We had two sons, right?

1091
01:28:22,584 --> 01:28:26,042
But she used to lock herself
in the bathroom at night.

1092
01:28:29,424 --> 01:28:32,291
That's when I would think about Mary Rose.

1093
01:28:35,197 --> 01:28:40,100
You know, Ritchie,
the best thing about the past is...

1094
01:28:42,137 --> 01:28:45,595
you forget what it was
that could have made you happy.

1095
01:28:48,009 --> 01:28:50,842
And for the past 15, 20 years...

1096
01:28:51,113 --> 01:28:54,276
your mother and I have been
like I said: content.

1097
01:28:54,683 --> 01:28:57,982
-You got to find things in common.
-Like what, Pop?

1098
01:29:01,823 --> 01:29:03,381
Like food, for instance.

1099
01:29:03,458 --> 01:29:07,087
Your mother and I are interested
in various types of food.

1100
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:13,090
A roasted chicken,
a leg of lamb smothered with onions...

1101
01:29:13,602 --> 01:29:18,232
a Yankee pot roast with lots of brown gravy
and little baby baked potatoes.

1102
01:29:21,009 --> 01:29:24,103
-There's always something to talk about.
-What?

1103
01:29:27,883 --> 01:29:31,649
Like who just got married, who died...

1104
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:35,389
who just had a baby,
how much we should give.

1105
01:29:37,926 --> 01:29:40,121
Marriage is a wonderful thing...

1106
01:29:40,195 --> 01:29:43,562
if you can just learn
to enjoy your wife for whatever she is.

1107
01:29:44,032 --> 01:29:46,398
They're giving the busta, Frank.

1108
01:29:46,801 --> 01:29:49,099
Better get back, Pop. It's late.

1109
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:59,677
-We'll talk some more, huh?
-Yeah, we'll talk some more.

1110
01:30:25,207 --> 01:30:30,076
I've got something I've been saving up
for this moment. It's your wedding present.

1111
01:30:31,846 --> 01:30:35,577
It might interest you
to know that there's $1,850 in there.

1112
01:30:37,052 --> 01:30:39,577
You might recall
that when your brother got married...

1113
01:30:39,654 --> 01:30:43,681
I only give him $1,500, but that was in 1964.

1114
01:30:44,426 --> 01:30:47,884
Since then,
you got to figure that since 1964...

1115
01:30:47,963 --> 01:30:50,830
there's been what you'd call an inflation.

1116
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,264
So this way I'm giving you
the same thing as I gave Ritchie.

1117
01:30:55,337 --> 01:30:57,703
-You got it?
-Thanks, Pop.

1118
01:31:06,248 --> 01:31:08,648
-Let's split.
-Yeah.

1119
01:31:09,884 --> 01:31:11,351
Was it worth it?

1120
01:31:13,154 --> 01:31:15,122
I'll let you know later.

1121
01:31:15,924 --> 01:31:17,653
Mom, we're leaving.

1122
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:26,264
Be good to my little boy.

1123
01:31:37,479 --> 01:31:40,073
I dreamed, but I never realized.

1124
01:31:46,421 --> 01:31:48,753
I hope you're not disappointed.

1125
01:31:50,258 --> 01:31:52,488
Should I tell you how I feel?

1126
01:31:54,095 --> 01:31:57,895
The waves have subsided, but I am still full.

1127
01:31:59,768 --> 01:32:00,996
And you?

1128
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:06,539
Do you believe:

1129
01:32:06,608 --> 01:32:11,045
"l am what I do, not what I say."
Albert Camus.

1130
01:32:12,147 --> 01:32:15,708
Or "l love, therefore I do." Bishop Pike.

1131
01:32:17,085 --> 01:32:20,612
-I'm having trouble keeping my eyes open.
-Then shut them. Take a nap.

1132
01:32:20,689 --> 01:32:22,782
-No, it's all right.
-Go on.

1133
01:32:33,501 --> 01:32:36,664
It's very hard for me to sleep
when there's someone in my bed.

1134
01:32:36,738 --> 01:32:40,765
Sleep is evidently more important to you
than the act of oneness.

1135
01:32:43,978 --> 01:32:46,845
I sensed the futility and doom of it all
when we first met.

1136
01:32:46,915 --> 01:32:48,109
We both sensed it.

1137
01:32:48,183 --> 01:32:51,778
-I suppose that's what drew us together.
-I'm sure of it.

1138
01:32:52,787 --> 01:32:56,188
Maybe I gave too much too soon. Is that it?

1139
01:32:56,257 --> 01:32:59,988
I should have held back more.
You wouldn't have judged me so harshly.

1140
01:33:00,061 --> 01:33:02,120
Brenda, I don't judge you.

1141
01:33:04,966 --> 01:33:07,662
-You're going to give me a call?
-Sure.

1142
01:33:08,236 --> 01:33:10,534
-You still have my number?
-Yes.

1143
01:33:12,707 --> 01:33:14,106
What is it?

1144
01:33:20,482 --> 01:33:23,246
I wrote it down. I have it written here.

1145
01:33:23,351 --> 01:33:26,582
I think it began with a six
or with an area code.

1146
01:33:41,803 --> 01:33:43,168
What is it?

1147
01:33:43,471 --> 01:33:44,768
Seven...

1148
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:46,968
two...

1149
01:33:47,308 --> 01:33:48,605
eight....

1150
01:33:51,946 --> 01:33:56,383
-Phyllis, that wasn't so bad, was it?
-lt was a nice wedding. Thank you.

1151
01:33:57,786 --> 01:33:59,219
Take care of my little girl.

1152
01:33:59,287 --> 01:34:02,347
Now each of you
has a faithful companion for life.

1153
01:34:03,258 --> 01:34:04,691
Flowers.

1154
01:34:04,759 --> 01:34:06,989
-Susan, here I am.
-Over here. To me.

1155
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,843
Poor Kathy.

1156
01:34:25,914 --> 01:34:30,248
This is evidently a hard time for her.
Be an angel. See if you can't cheer her up.

1157
01:34:30,318 --> 01:34:32,309
-Why don't you do it?
-No, you go.

1158
01:34:32,387 --> 01:34:34,821
You have a way of comforting her.

1159
01:34:35,957 --> 01:34:38,016
-Now?
-Now.

1160
01:34:42,664 --> 01:34:46,896
I love you truly

1161
01:34:47,302 --> 01:34:50,237
Truly, dear

1162
01:35:04,819 --> 01:35:06,810
Kathy, are you in there?

1163
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:19,288
I can't bear to see you unhappy.
Will you let me in?

1164
01:35:21,002 --> 01:35:22,902
I want to talk to you.

1165
01:35:26,674 --> 01:35:28,437
Goodbye, Hal.

1166
01:35:33,481 --> 01:35:36,109
I can't go on like this anymore.

1167
01:35:36,184 --> 01:35:38,448
You've got to tell Bernice
about us right now...

1168
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,579
or I don't know what I'll do.

1169
01:35:46,861 --> 01:35:48,453
Sit down.

1170
01:35:49,464 --> 01:35:54,401
Kathy, you mean a lot to me,
but let me tell you something about myself.

1171
01:35:55,003 --> 01:35:57,403
I could go to Bernice and tell her about us...

1172
01:35:57,472 --> 01:35:59,463
and maybe she would forgive you...

1173
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:02,271
even though she'd certainly never speak
to me again.

1174
01:36:02,343 --> 01:36:05,312
But that's not important.
What is important....

1175
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:07,541
You have every right
to want something more...

1176
01:36:07,615 --> 01:36:11,608
than what I've been giving you,
just as Bernice has every right...

1177
01:36:13,354 --> 01:36:15,345
but here it is in a nutshell.

1178
01:36:15,423 --> 01:36:18,756
I'm the kind of man
who, when confronted with the fact...

1179
01:36:18,826 --> 01:36:21,454
that I've been married
to the same woman for 30 years...

1180
01:36:21,529 --> 01:36:23,520
who has given me two wonderful children...

1181
01:36:23,598 --> 01:36:27,466
it becomes progressively
more difficult for me to know that...

1182
01:36:27,835 --> 01:36:31,828
I've given her any more unhappiness
than I've already given her.

1183
01:36:32,206 --> 01:36:35,801
-What I'm trying to say is--
-That you'll never leave Bernice.

1184
01:36:35,877 --> 01:36:38,539
That we'll never see each other,
or have each other...

1185
01:36:38,613 --> 01:36:42,344
-or hold each other in our arms again.
-Not necessarily.

1186
01:36:42,884 --> 01:36:44,784
What are you trying to say?

1187
01:36:44,852 --> 01:36:47,184
Are you going to tell Bernice about us
or not?

1188
01:36:47,255 --> 01:36:50,315
Kathy, it's not that simple. You see...

1189
01:36:51,392 --> 01:36:55,351
You, Bernice, and I are three of us in a boat.

1190
01:36:56,264 --> 01:37:01,099
It's my boat and it's your lake,
but Bernice has the oars.

1191
01:37:04,005 --> 01:37:06,565
Phil has asked me to marry him, Hal.

1192
01:37:07,442 --> 01:37:09,808
Phil has asked you to marry him?

1193
01:37:12,914 --> 01:37:14,643
Have you been fooling around with Phil?

1194
01:37:14,716 --> 01:37:17,617
I could never, not when I'm in love with you.

1195
01:37:17,685 --> 01:37:21,052
You must have done something
for him to ask you to marry him.

1196
01:37:21,356 --> 01:37:22,948
Did he kiss you?

1197
01:37:23,891 --> 01:37:25,449
Yes. I kissed him.

1198
01:37:25,526 --> 01:37:27,255
Did he touch your breast?

1199
01:37:27,495 --> 01:37:31,989
-Did he touch your breast?
-Yes, Hal, but l....

1200
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,992
Why, Kathy? Why?

1201
01:37:34,235 --> 01:37:36,465
Didn't you tell me to go out with other men?

1202
01:37:36,537 --> 01:37:38,835
-Yes, but--
-He wouldn't go out with me anymore...

1203
01:37:38,906 --> 01:37:41,773
if I didn't at least let him do something.

1204
01:37:42,777 --> 01:37:44,369
Life stinks.

1205
01:37:48,383 --> 01:37:50,408
Nobody can ever be happy.

1206
01:37:50,618 --> 01:37:55,146
-You're not happy. Bernice is not happy.
-I think I can make Phil happy.

1207
01:37:55,223 --> 01:37:58,488
-Screw Phil.
-You don't mean that.

1208
01:37:58,559 --> 01:38:01,323
No, I don't mean that. It's just that...

1209
01:38:01,496 --> 01:38:05,626
every time I think everything's worked out,
something complicates things.

1210
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,969
Now there's Phil's happiness
to worry about.

1211
01:38:10,505 --> 01:38:14,669
-All right, what did you tell him?
-I told him that I have to think about it.

1212
01:38:14,742 --> 01:38:17,336
There's nothing to think about.
You can't marry Phil.

1213
01:38:17,412 --> 01:38:19,277
-Why not?
-Because I have too much pride...

1214
01:38:19,347 --> 01:38:21,611
to go sneaking around corners
with a married woman.

1215
01:38:21,683 --> 01:38:23,844
-What have I been doing?
-That's different.

1216
01:38:23,918 --> 01:38:27,285
-I was married before I met you.
-But I have nothing.

1217
01:38:27,355 --> 01:38:29,823
I can't go on like this. There's no end.

1218
01:38:29,891 --> 01:38:33,725
If you don't tell Bernice about us
right after the wedding....

1219
01:38:38,266 --> 01:38:40,200
I'm going to marry Phil.

1220
01:38:40,301 --> 01:38:43,828
I see. You're going
to force me to make the decision for you.

1221
01:38:43,905 --> 01:38:45,873
You have to make your own decision...

1222
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:48,135
just like Bernice has
to make her own decision...

1223
01:38:48,209 --> 01:38:50,404
and Phil has to make his own decision.

1224
01:38:50,478 --> 01:38:53,970
What about you, Hal?
Don't you have to make a decision?

1225
01:38:54,082 --> 01:38:57,279
-I have made my decision.
-What have you decided?

1226
01:39:03,257 --> 01:39:05,919
I've decided to try to find a new way...

1227
01:39:05,993 --> 01:39:08,393
to help Bernice
to find the strength to leave me...

1228
01:39:08,463 --> 01:39:12,058
yet giving you the option
to end it all by marrying Phil.

1229
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:15,533
If Bernice isn't aware enough
to make the move that's right for her...

1230
01:39:15,603 --> 01:39:19,095
and if you can't call on your resources
to resist me...

1231
01:39:19,307 --> 01:39:23,266
then responsibility rests not with me...

1232
01:39:23,478 --> 01:39:27,346
not with you, Kathy, not with Bernice,
but with Phil.

1233
01:39:55,076 --> 01:39:57,408
-Bye-bye, Joe.
-Arrivederci.

1234
01:39:57,478 --> 01:40:00,003
-Ciao, Frank.
-Ciao.

1235
01:40:03,417 --> 01:40:06,147
Good night, Mom and Dad. I'm leaving.

1236
01:40:06,254 --> 01:40:08,848
Joan, you let Ritchie drive you back
to New York.

1237
01:40:08,923 --> 01:40:10,254
Okay, Mother.

1238
01:40:16,097 --> 01:40:18,224
You can buy her a new book.

1239
01:40:31,012 --> 01:40:34,140
So what was Joan's story?

1240
01:40:34,715 --> 01:40:37,741
Ritchie's hair stopped smelling like raisins.

1241
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:40,346
That's it? That's her story?

1242
01:40:40,421 --> 01:40:44,255
-And she was shocked that you've strayed.
-For crying out loud.

1243
01:40:44,325 --> 01:40:47,351
-What did you have to tell her that for?
-lt came out in passing.

1244
01:40:47,428 --> 01:40:51,296
-Why does she have to know our business?
-I was trying to make a point.

1245
01:40:51,566 --> 01:40:55,400
To err is human, to forgive divine.

1246
01:40:55,503 --> 01:40:56,834
All right.

1247
01:40:58,973 --> 01:41:02,204
-Arrivederci, Bea.
-Arrivederci, Pauline.

1248
01:41:11,586 --> 01:41:14,851
-Stupid Pauline.
-What are we going to do?

1249
01:41:15,356 --> 01:41:16,983
What can you do?

1250
01:41:17,925 --> 01:41:19,688
You live and learn.

1251
01:41:20,461 --> 01:41:24,022
-You got to take the good with the bad.
-What can you do?

1252
01:41:26,033 --> 01:41:29,002
-You live and learn.
-You raise a boy.

1253
01:41:30,204 --> 01:41:34,504
-You teach him values.
-That stupid Pauline.

1254
01:41:34,809 --> 01:41:36,572
Teach him a family.

1255
01:41:37,578 --> 01:41:42,208
-You got to take the good with the bad.
-Life is for the living.

1256
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:44,646
I could have broken her head.

1257
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:50,723
-I can understand her wanting to leave.
-That's how life is.

1258
01:41:51,158 --> 01:41:53,683
But I can't understand her leaving.

1259
01:42:05,339 --> 01:42:08,001
I think I'll have my wedding cake now.

1260
01:42:20,621 --> 01:42:24,022
I don't understand how you spend
half your life in the bathroom.

1261
01:42:58,092 --> 01:43:00,253
You followed him there...

1262
01:43:00,828 --> 01:43:05,458
-and shot him from behind a tree.
-That's enough. That story is ridiculous.

1263
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,700
You'll make a fool of yourself.

1264
01:43:07,768 --> 01:43:10,737
A love-smitten analyst
playing a dream detective?

1265
01:43:10,805 --> 01:43:12,966
There've been no dreams for days.

1266
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,838
You going to watch television
on our honeymoon night?

1267
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:17,571
It's almost over.

1268
01:43:18,512 --> 01:43:21,481
You'll be identified by the man that arrived.

1269
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:25,746
There are people who saw you
on the train....

1270
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:27,788
I'm not getting married.

1271
01:43:27,855 --> 01:43:30,790
Remember when I said to you,
"Mike, if I ask you to marry me...

1272
01:43:30,858 --> 01:43:34,385
"can I take it back if I want to?"
You said I could, didn't you?

1273
01:43:34,695 --> 01:43:37,789
I'm taking it back. That's all. Taking it back.

1274
01:43:38,132 --> 01:43:40,862
Dr. Peterson was a rather stupid woman.
