2
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,882
<i>Ah, delicious.</i>

3
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,440
<i>If it sounds Spanish, man,
that's what it is.</i>

4
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,738
<i>It's a Spanish movie.</i>

5
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,817
<i>Now, okay. One, two, three, four.</i>

6
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:03,875
The <i>house of</i> my father.

7
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:18,682
<i>Love is not a game to play.</i>

8
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:25,067
<i>Dreams may come, then run away.</i>

9
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,364
<i>All is lost when we are one.</i>

10
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:40,620
<i>We are two or we are none.</i>

11
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,339
<i>A house is not of brick and sand.</i>

12
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,839
<i>It is built with blood and hand.</i>

13
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:54,676
<i>So the land is like our mother.</i>

14
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,813
<i>And on top.</i>

15
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:03,887
<i>The house of my father.</i>

16
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,629
<i>A house is not of brick and sand.</i>

17
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,012
<i>It is built with blood and hand.</i>

18
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:41,974
<i>So the land is like our mother.</i>

19
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,064
<i>And on top.</i>

20
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:52,367
<i>The house.</i>

21
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:56,662
<i>Of my father.</i>

22
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:02,835
<i>The house of my father.</i>

23
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,910
<i>The house of my father.</i>

24
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,812
Armando,

25
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:27,815
why do you care for the calf,
when all of our money is in the herd?

26
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:34,822
Esteban, one day my father's ranch
will be passed on to my brother and I.

27
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,747
We will want this calf
and many more like it.

28
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,960
I still say you care more
for the baby cow than for a woman.

29
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,248
Yes, it's true, Manuel,

30
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,881
but only because
I have not found the right woman.

31
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,003
I propose a contest.

32
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,926
Let's race back to the house!

33
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,475
I hope nothing bad happens
on the way home!

34
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,395
I'm riding a horse!

35
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,401
Get down.

36
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,450
This is not good.

37
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,296
He's a drug dealer!

38
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,007
We should ride down and help this man.

39
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,800
And get killed?

40
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,640
Maybe he just wants to talk to him.

41
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,636
Holy mother.

42
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,895
Praying will not help that man.

43
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:37,315
Perhaps praying is all we can do.

44
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,995
What are we doing here?

45
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,418
Your brother may already be home!

46
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,423
Fuck, yeah!

47
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,000
Quiet.

48
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,521
Come in.

49
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,520
Father, is this a good time?

50
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,108
What do you want?

51
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,111
Pardon, nothing, sir. I was just...

52
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,033
Where have you been?

53
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,196
We were taking the cattle
to a new pasture <i>as</i> you asked.

54
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,284
What took you so long? There is much work
to do around here, Armando!

55
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,960
Is there something wrong, Father?

56
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,502
Leave me alone.

57
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,542
Armando.

58
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,051
Yes, Father?

59
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,711
Come over here.

60
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,927
Armando, forgive me.

61
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,472
I have many worries.

62
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,059
Please let me help, Father.

63
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,738
You are so much like your mother.

64
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,483
She had such a good heart.

65
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,160
And I know your heart
is in the right place,

66
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,365
but like your mother, you are not smart.

67
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,825
You have never been smart.

68
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,000
But I am smart, Father.

69
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,670
Yes, of course, Armando.

70
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:20,342
For my trouble,
I need someone who is very smart.

71
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,886
If you were truly smart,

72
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,514
you would know that you are dumb.

73
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,674
Look at your fat head.

74
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,142
Raul!

75
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,307
Raul, your brother.

76
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,267
It's Raul.

77
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,854
You arrange everything with the Japanese
and then give them the merchandise.

78
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,693
- Raul!
- Brother!

79
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,903
We are close brothers.

80
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,990
We have shared so much, man.

81
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,116
Raul!

82
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,291
Papa!

83
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,799
Finally, the one with brains has returned!

84
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,512
You're the son I've always loved!

85
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,063
Fuck, I almost forgot.

86
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,607
Sweetheart.

87
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,397
May I introduce to you Miss Sonia Lopez?

88
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,083
Sonia Lopez.

89
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,589
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

90
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,669
It's nice to meet you.

91
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,097
Let me look at you.

92
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,174
You look amazing.

93
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,848
You must be Armando.

94
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,147
Armando Alvarez, Miss Lopez.

95
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,224
Welcome to our house.

96
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,901
Thank you, but please call me Sonia.

97
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,900
And I can call you Armando?

98
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,357
I would like that, Sonia.

99
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,202
Esteban de los Santos Escobar Chavez.

100
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,704
Sir.

101
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,791
Thank you, Esmeralda.

102
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,217
You're welcome.

103
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,544
Sir.

104
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,759
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

105
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,343
Thank you, sweetheart.

106
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:39,647
Raul, you have brought so much happiness
to our father.

107
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,224
I am an Alvarez, no?

108
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,897
If only we could keep the drug dealers
off the ranch.

109
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,450
Just this morning,
I was out with Manuel and Esteban,

110
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,653
and we came across a killing.

111
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,113
Why was I not told?

112
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,329
I saw that you had many worries.

113
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,457
They killed a man.

114
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,709
I believe it was by the Onza.

115
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,089
The Onza?

116
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,761
Miss Lopez. Sonia.

117
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,053
How nice to see you.

118
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,257
It's a pleasure that you're here,

119
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,966
because here...

120
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:20,021
Armando has never done anything
with a woman.

121
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,940
It seems like he's not interested in women.

122
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,604
Is this true, Armando?

123
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,686
Do you have no interest in women?

124
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,194
I would not say that, Miss Lopez.

125
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,618
I just have not found the woman for me.

126
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,445
What would this woman be like?

127
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,588
My woman, Miss Lopez,

128
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,335
must love the land as I do.

129
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,052
More than all the gold in the world,

130
00:11:55,131 --> 00:12:00,137
she must find pleasure
in the scent of the cactus flower.

131
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,940
She would sleep beneath the stars

132
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:10,731
and let the wild west wind caress her body

133
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,282
and blanket her soul.

134
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:18,239
<i>Her passions would be my passions,</i>

135
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,658
her dreams, my dreams.

136
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,875
And our love would be a great song,

137
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,794
and the song would be true.

138
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,474
Armando is
a ridiculously hopeless romantic!

139
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:46,608
What woman would sleep
in the dirt with him, please?

140
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,192
Sonia.

141
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,902
Come over here.

142
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,155
Sonia.

143
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,707
Father, I...

144
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:10,041
Excuse me. Miss Lopez, Sonia and I,

145
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:14,715
would like to ask your permission
to be married.

146
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,176
To get married?

147
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,680
You two? What a delight!

148
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:27,854
The Lord has blessed the Alvarez house.

149
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,059
Thank you!

150
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,030
For Raul and for Sonia.

151
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,527
Much happiness.

152
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,778
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

153
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,699
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

154
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,450
- For you, brother, cheers.
- Cheers.

155
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,848
So it's true?

156
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,682
It says here that Raul is getting married
to this woman.

157
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,058
It's true.

158
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:11,561
She is the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

159
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,940
She is very pretty.

160
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,942
You don't sound happy, Armando.

161
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,366
Are you jealous of your brother?

162
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,072
Jealous?

163
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:28,661
No, Manuel, I could never
be jealous of Raul.

164
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:35,379
Maybe I love him too much,
and I am concerned.

165
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,835
Concerned?

166
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,046
I don't know.

167
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,506
He has changed.

168
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,433
I think you are jealous.

169
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,352
I am jealous.

170
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,814
If I had a woman like this...

171
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,267
I would never get out of bed.

172
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,788
Can I not share in your joke?

173
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,127
I'm afraid not, Miss Lopez.

174
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,300
The joke was about you.

175
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,341
Do you ride?

176
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,472
I haven't in a long time,

177
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,889
but I would like to.

178
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,394
- Esteban, please check on the herd.
- Yes.

179
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,393
- I shall meet you there later.
- Of course.

180
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,349
You ride well, Miss Lopez.

181
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,939
Good control, nice poise.

182
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,143
That is a difficult horse.

183
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,773
You have ridden before.

184
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,399
From the time I could walk,
my father put me on the back of a horse.

185
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,234
I see.

186
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,409
When I was nine,
my father was murdered in his bed.

187
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,911
They took me to the city
to live with my uncle.

188
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,162
Interesting.

189
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,335
My uncle was very mean.

190
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,541
He drank rubbing alcohol, and he hit me
and burned me with his cigarettes.

191
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,841
Interesting.

192
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,467
I ran away from him when I was 12.

193
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,850
But he found me, and beat me, and said
he would marry me when I was grown up.

194
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,303
Interesting.

195
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,438
And your uncle?

196
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,439
I have not seen him in a long time.

197
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,567
I have to ask you something.

198
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,364
Do you love Raul?

199
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:10,163
Raul has been very good to me,
and I have been good to him.

200
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,408
Do you love him?

201
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,959
I must know.

202
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,088
A race. I will show you how well I ride!
Giddy up!

203
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,135
Not if I can help it!

204
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,533
This is beautiful.

205
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,165
What is this place?

206
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,751
It is called.

207
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,380
The Pond of the Seven Tears.

208
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,132
I swam here as a boy.

209
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:16,187
It is the most beautiful spot
I have seen in all my life.

210
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,724
How did you know to ride here?

211
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,940
The wind told me.

212
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,109
Sometimes the wind talks to me.

213
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,987
This is the place my mother was killed.

214
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,697
This was her favorite place.

215
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,415
I have much work to do.

216
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,841
Go then. I am only drying my hair.

217
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,634
Okay, but do not be long.

218
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,587
There are bandits in these hills.

219
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,014
Armando will protect me.

220
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,432
Ah. Yes.

221
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,308
My son,

222
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,560
this was my father's rifle.

223
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:04,148
He passed it on to me when I was a boy,

224
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,775
and today I am giving it to you.

225
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,326
Go. You must build our ranch.

226
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,250
Armando.

227
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,298
What do you want?

228
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,833
Armando, give me the gun.

229
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,136
- Boy, give me the gun!
- No.

230
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,681
No! Let me go! No!

231
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,390
Go! Don't touch me!

232
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,704
She loved coming here.

233
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,245
I am sorry.

234
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,292
It was a long time ago.

235
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,126
I could stay here forever.

236
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,838
I doubt that very much.

237
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,052
Why is that?

238
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,799
There is nothing to buy.

239
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,429
No shops,

240
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,386
no expensive clothes,

241
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,346
no fancy shoes.

242
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,400
This is not Dallas.

243
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,318
Is that what you think of me?

244
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,193
Someone who needs fancy shoes?

245
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:35,318
It does not matter what I think of you.

246
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:40,164
You think I'm some kind of cheap woman
who is only interested in Raul's money?

247
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,741
Are you?

248
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,296
You never answered my question.

249
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,259
What question?

250
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,883
Do you love my brother?

251
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,555
Take me back, now!

252
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,132
Answer the question!

253
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,888
B00905!

254
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,060
- Congas?
- Guns.

255
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,388
Where?

256
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,814
Over that hill.

257
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:05,890
Hunters?

258
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,725
Those are not hunters.

259
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,027
Perhaps someone is hurt.

260
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,979
It is not our concern.

261
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,695
You are a coward. A coward!

262
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,569
Sonia!

263
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,746
No!

264
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,213
Sir? Sir?

265
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,842
Please... God forgive me.

266
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,472
Easy. We'll take you to the hospital.

267
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,352
Let him die.

268
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,604
He is missing a hand.

269
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,602
Give me your water, Armando.

270
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,155
Waste water on that?

271
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,737
In the trunk. It's in the trunk.

272
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,035
Take it...

273
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,741
Here, take this.

274
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,006
I know you.

275
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,629
You are Sonia.

276
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,335
I found some drugs!

277
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,763
Armando, please help me put him
on the horse.

278
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,305
He is coming.

279
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,722
The Onza.

280
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:31,105
Maybe God will be merciful.

281
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,113
He is dead!

282
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,489
He was dead a long time ago.

283
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:45,206
It looks like these belong to you now.

284
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,500
You are a rich woman.

285
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,881
Don't you want them?

286
00:22:53,956 --> 00:23:00,384
Perhaps as a wedding present
from an old dying friend?

287
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,809
You have answered my question.

288
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,312
You do not love my brother.

289
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,986
Let me go. You're hurting me.

290
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,689
I don't think you hurt so easily.

291
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:22,618
I know the kind of woman you are.

292
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,196
You know nothing about me.

293
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,580
I know that you will not marry Raul
if I can help it.

294
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,914
Do you think Raul is so innocent?

295
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,007
You lie!

296
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,925
You stupid rancher.

297
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,008
Your brother is a drug dealer!

298
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,929
You have done this!

299
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,766
So help me God, if it is true,

300
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,442
and my brother is involved in drugs,

301
00:23:55,517 --> 00:24:00,614
you shall never have the name Alvarez!

302
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,326
I'll take care of my family.

303
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,951
Let the devil take care of you.

304
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:27,308
Are you so sure
that Raul is involved with drugs?

305
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,477
I don't know, Manuel.

306
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:33,681
I have sensed something since his return,

307
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,813
and this morning with Sonia...

308
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,442
Perhaps she is lying. Bitches are liars.

309
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:44,025
It is true. Bitches are liars.

310
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,736
But Miss Lopez is no bitch.

311
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,906
I like bitches.

312
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:15,056
You two wait here
while I go and talk to Raul.

313
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,908
It is true, Raul?

314
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,748
What are you speaking of, Armando?

315
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,793
You are in the drug business.

316
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,125
I am in business in Mexico, Armando.

317
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,960
What's the difference?

318
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:50,054
Raul, you have brought shame to our family.

319
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:54,137
No, Armando. I am here to save this family.

320
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,220
There's a difference.

321
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,148
You are taking this family to hell!

322
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,774
Armando, Little Armando, listen.

323
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,027
Yes.

324
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,745
So I move drugs over the border.

325
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,948
So why do you care?

326
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,125
I do not sell drugs to my people.

327
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,369
I sell it to the Americans.

328
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,750
I don't sell drugs to our people.
No, no, no.

329
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,003
I sell the Americans drugs, but I'd sell
them chocolates if they wanted them.

330
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,668
But they don't!

331
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:30,840
This is not the America
our father held in such high esteem.

332
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,013
This is a country of babies.

333
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,979
They buy houses with no money.

334
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,773
TVs and cars with no money.

335
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:45,021
They stuff their faces like monsters

336
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:50,026
with shit burgers and grease.

337
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:54,121
It's irresponsible to feed candy to babies.

338
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,790
No, they are not babies, Armando.

339
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,914
They are all adults, and they are crazy.

340
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,914
They only cry like babies.

341
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,168
The damn Mexicans are coming!

342
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,130
They are going to fuck us up
and kill us with their drugs!

343
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,634
Fuck them!

344
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,222
Fuck their drug-addicted children!

345
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,012
Fuck them all.

346
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:22,441
Fuck their heroin-addicted wives
who stuff themselves non-stop with pasta.

347
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,233
Fuck their pot smoking doctors
from California.

348
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,654
Fuck them!

349
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,491
If they can't stop themselves
from shoving bags of shit up their nose,

350
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,569
then let's make a buck while we can,
Little Armando.

351
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,280
Yes, yes. If it was so simple.

352
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:40,209
But instead we have been infected
with greed.

353
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,707
We will all kill each other

354
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:48,043
feeding the shit-eating
crazy monster babies.

355
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:53,552
Look, Armando, this country will be strong

356
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,429
from America's weakness.

357
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,053
Sons of bitches.

358
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,271
What's up?

359
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,316
You are Raul?

360
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,660
You know very well who I am.

361
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,620
And I know very well who you are.

362
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,287
Onza.

363
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,296
Onza.

364
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,878
The Onza.

365
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,424
So, Raul, what the hell are you doing here?

366
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,220
I am here visiting my family.

367
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,557
I am here because...

368
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,738
This is my land.

369
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:01,074
You motherfucker,
you think you're a big boy?

370
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,908
He's really funny. Isn't he, Armando?

371
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,993
Look, Raul.

372
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,788
I don't believe you.

373
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,553
You have already taken my woman,

374
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,381
and I think you are here
for something more.

375
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,092
The woman was never yours.

376
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,177
- Oh, no?
- No.

377
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,355
And I repeat.

378
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,060
I am here...

379
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,104
because...

380
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,356
this is my land.

381
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,453
Armando.

382
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,284
Yes?

383
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:48,211
Can I call you Little Armando?

384
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,334
I'd like that.

385
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,585
Do you know what your brother is doing?

386
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,055
Do you know what business he <i>is</i> in?

387
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,638
It's very dangerous for you

388
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,894
and very dangerous for him.

389
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,269
And it's very dangerous for your family.

390
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,199
<i>Easy, easy.</i>

391
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:22,575
Not all dirty, little ranchers
like Canadian Slims.

392
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,414
Yes, I like them.

393
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,793
All right then,

394
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,462
I only came to bring you this.

395
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,673
I think it belongs to you.

396
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,217
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

397
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,508
Raul.

398
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,262
This is going to get very ugly.

399
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,348
That's okay.

400
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,346
Goodbye.

401
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,930
See you around.

402
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,186
See you later.

403
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,192
Bye.

404
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,944
“BYE bye.
- Bye.

405
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,058
It does not seem
<i>as</i> if this Onza wants to follow your plan.

406
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,566
Armando, go home.

407
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:42,736
Mexico is no place for cowards.

408
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:53,295
<i>I live my life on earth.</i>

409
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:57,167
<i>The dirt is all I know.</i>

410
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:00,378
<i>I am a ranchero.</i>

411
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:04,757
<i>And I know nothing.</i>

412
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,767
<i>I know nothing.</i>

413
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,904
<i>Why does the moon shine at night?</i>

414
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,573
<i>I don't know.</i>

415
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,992
<i>Why does the bird take ﬂight?</i>

416
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,786
<i>I don't know.</i>

417
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,990
<i>Why does the turtle move so slow?</i>

418
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,200
<i>I don't know.</i>

419
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:35,996
Come on!

420
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,964
<i>Why do men hate each other?</i>

421
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,963
<i>I don't know.</i>

422
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,136
<i>Why does the brother fight the brother?</i>

423
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,930
<i>I don't know.</i>

424
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,384
<i>Why does the blue ﬂower grow?</i>

425
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,890
<i>I don't know.</i>

426
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:59,399
<i>How can I know anything?</i>

427
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,856
<i>What is there to know?</i>

428
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,487
<i>Long live Mexico!</i>

429
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:08,036
<i>I am a man of the land.</i>

430
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:12,241
<i>I am a ranchero.</i>

431
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,751
<i>And I don't know.</i>

432
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,295
<i>I live a simple life.</i>

433
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,506
<i>I'm friends with the cows.</i>

434
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:20,833
<i>I have no thoughts.</i>

435
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,795
<i>I am a ranchero.</i>

436
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,947
<i>I don't know.</i>

437
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,531
<i>And I don't know.</i>

438
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,500
<i>Why is a woman so warm?</i>

439
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,297
<i>Why is my bed so cold?</i>

440
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,626
<i>These are the questions.</i>

441
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,005
<i>I'll never know.</i>

442
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,383
<i>I'm a ranchero.</i>

443
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,968
<i>And I don't know.</i>

444
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,647
<i>The only thing I'll ever know for certain</i>

445
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,347
<i>ls love.</i>

446
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,184
Look at that.

447
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,857
Holy Mary, a white cat.

448
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,072
This is a rare thing.

449
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,116
Let me kill it.

450
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:14,867
No. You cannot kill this.

451
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,825
He is here for a reason.

452
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,537
Yes, so that I can shoot him.

453
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,169
I do not know the reason,

454
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,421
but I believe it has
something to do with me.

455
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,863
Look at this country.

456
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,366
Always such beauty.

457
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,197
Why is there so much pain?

458
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,371
Esteban slept on a rock last night.

459
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,747
I slept on a bottle of tequila.

460
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,966
What is this?

461
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,046
I do not know.

462
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,846
I don't like this.

463
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:21,930
FEDERAL POLICE

464
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,856
You two stay here.

465
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,439
Be careful.

466
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,323
Armando Alvarez?

467
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,208
Yes. That is my name.

468
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,332
I am Vincent Blancardo.

469
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,294
I was friend of your
father's in the old days.

470
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,043
You were the one who found my mother.

471
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,795
Yes, many years ago.

472
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,391
Armando,
these men are from America.

473
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,468
They are with the DEA.

474
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,142
Yes, how can I help you?

475
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,483
Cut the shit, Blancardo.

476
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,353
- You speak American?
- Huh?

477
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,899
Do you speak American?

478
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,317
No, sir.

479
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,403
I don't speak American.

480
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,487
Shit.

481
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:23,583
Armando, I need you to help me.

482
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,830
Of course.

483
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:29,832
We know that your brother is a drug dealer.

484
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:36,931
We also know that he is here
to take over the territory of the Onza.

485
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,178
I don't think I can help you, Mr...

486
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,683
Parker.

487
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,640
The name is Parker.

488
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,361
I think you can help me.

489
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,194
He's scared shitless.

490
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,368
He's gonna shit his pants.

491
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,790
Listen, you piece of shit.

492
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,789
I make one call,

493
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,996
and I can get 10 helicopters

494
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,831
to come up over that hill

495
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,043
and turn your ranch

496
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,877
into a lit fart.

497
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,051
So you think about that.

498
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,939
It is better this way, Armando.

499
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,319
Talk to Raul.

500
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,322
Find out for this man.

501
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,153
Now go find out.

502
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,844
He'll squeal.
He's a fucking coward.

503
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,526
Ladies and gentlemen,

504
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,705
I want to thank you all for coming today.

505
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,872
Tomorrow will be a great day
for the Alvarez family.

506
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:33,501
It's a pleasure to share
it with all of you.

507
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:38,047
My sister, Carmen,
has come from Guadalajara.

508
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,880
My other sister, Margarite,
has come from Puerto Vallarta.

509
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,057
My cousin, Hernan, and his wife, Doleta.

510
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,261
My friends for life.

511
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:52,187
Of course, Sheila from Atlanta!

512
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,857
Mexico is the bestico.

513
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,608
Tomorrow will be
a double celebration.

514
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:06,538
The return of my son, Raul, to his land.

515
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:10,083
Also, he brought home this precious woman

516
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,911
with whom he gets to have sex.

517
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,416
I propose a toast to Sonia.

518
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,168
For Sonia! Friends.

519
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,507
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

520
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,584
For Sonia.

521
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,919
Cheers!

522
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:24,848
I'd also like to propose a toast

523
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,927
and thank those who have come from so far.

524
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,772
But I would like to
specially thank someone,

525
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,272
someone who many of you have often
called stupid, imbecile, fat head,

526
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:40,106
but he's a guy with a big heart.

527
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,282
I propose a toast

528
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,325
for my brother.

529
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,368
For your happiness, Armando.

530
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,874
Well, Armando?

531
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,925
You aren't going to toast
to your brother's happiness?

532
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:04,970
Yes.

533
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,764
To Raul's happiness.

534
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,221
May you enjoy all of life's pleasure.

535
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,275
Even if it means the
destruction of this family!

536
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,685
Stop, Armando!

537
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,660
Please!

538
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,032
It hurts me to say it,

539
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:33,663
but tomorrow I do not wish
for you to be at your brother's wedding.

540
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,994
Do you understand me? Get out!

541
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,206
As you wish.

542
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,632
- Armando...
- Let him go!

543
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,801
Armando!

544
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,757
Let me talk to him.
You stay with your guests.

545
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,182
Armando.

546
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,188
Go back inside, Sonia.

547
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,689
Go back to your people.

548
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,362
Don't make trouble, Armando.

549
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,612
Do you think I like
that Raul is mixed up in this business?

550
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,069
It is your business too.

551
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,654
We can change him.

552
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,705
But I need your help.

553
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,327
Armando,

554
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,286
there's something you need to know.

555
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,960
What is it that I must know?

556
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,886
This drug dealer they call the Onza.

557
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,056
He is my uncle.

558
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,633
I understand.

559
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:36,604
He will never stop until
he has what he wants.

560
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,354
You come from trouble,
and you carry it with you.

561
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,937
Then save us.

562
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,021
Save your brother.

563
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,447
Save your family.

564
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:49,571
Save me.

565
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:54,994
Some things are beyond saving.

566
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,914
La.

567
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,586
<i>La La.</i>

568
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,710
<i>La La La La La.</i>

569
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,087
<i>La.</i>

570
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,763
<i>La La.</i>

571
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,933
<i>La La La La La.</i>

572
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,555
<i>La La.</i>

573
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,598
<i>La.</i>

574
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,182
<i>La La.</i>

575
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,229
<i>La La.</i>

576
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,354
<i>La.</i>

577
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:30,404
<i>La.</i>

578
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,617
Father.

579
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,873
Raul, who did this? Was it Armando?

580
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,045
Easy, Dad, don't talk.

581
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,166
Don't die on me.

582
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:58,010
Armando was right.

583
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,594
He was dead the day we came to his house.

584
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,931
Hold on, Papa...
Hold on, you're gonna be fine.

585
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,516
It has his
fingerprints all over it!

586
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,600
What?

587
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,436
It had to be Armando!

588
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,487
How the hell could it be Armando, Papa?

589
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,685
Hello, Blancardo...

590
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,562
The deed is done.

591
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,481
<i>Sonia?</i>

592
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:56,485
She is alive, just as you wanted.

593
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:57,907
Good.

594
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,199
Raul?

595
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:03,113
Raul still lives.

596
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,163
So let me get this right...

597
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:09,790
I'm paying the police to protect me.

598
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,998
Do the police not honor
their obligations any more?

599
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,457
<i>Don't worry.</i>

600
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,552
He will come to you now.

601
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:22,136
We must figure out how to bring him back.

602
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,643
The woman.

603
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,308
His woman.

604
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,310
Sonia.

605
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,104
Little Sonia.

606
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,190
My little niece.

607
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,612
Fine. Thank you.

608
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,832
Whoa, stop! Hey, Armando!

609
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,710
Esteban, my friend.
Why are you in such a hurry?

610
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,006
They shot your father!

611
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,049
What?

612
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,126
The wedding! Gunmen shooting!

613
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,211
Raul?

614
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,420
Raul and the woman are safe.

615
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:05,384
Your father, Armando.
Your father is dying.

616
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,592
Let's go!

617
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,098
Fast!

618
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:26,200
Armando, come.

619
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:27,906
Yes, Father?

620
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,706
It is me.

621
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,086
Do you remember your mother?

622
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,629
Yes.

623
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,502
I remember her a little.

624
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:41,090
She was a very beautiful woman.

625
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,763
She was a beautiful woman.

626
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:48,184
The most beautiful in all of Mexico.

627
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:51,763
You know, you have her eyes.

628
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:55,271
You have told me that many times.

629
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:59,820
The eyes of a small chicken.

630
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,863
Little chicken...

631
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,535
I have been very mean to you.

632
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:10,372
Calling you stupid all the time,

633
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:15,045
comparing you to donkeys and pigs,

634
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:19,003
laughing at the way you speak.

635
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:25,342
Giving you to the circus.

636
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:32,642
Perhaps I have never forgiven you

637
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:36,065
for the accident.

638
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:39,273
For this, I am very sorry.

639
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,442
I was hoping.

640
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:47,243
When I see your mother in heaven,

641
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,951
I could tell her that her home,

642
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:56,082
and her family are well.

643
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,915
What will I say now, Armando?

644
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:07,425
You must tell her a lie.

645
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:13,596
Tell her Raul has married
a beautiful woman,

646
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,648
and that she will have children

647
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:22,524
and the Alvarez family is known

648
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:27,951
throughout Mexico as an honorable family.

649
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:34,328
I will tell her a lie.

650
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:42,712
Because I am ashamed
of the truth, Armando.

651
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:51,474
I am ashamed.

652
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,309
Father...

653
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,859
Father...

654
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,665
I will kill the motherfucker
responsible for it.

655
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,914
He was not killed by any man.

656
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,121
He died of shame.

657
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,003
It's Sonia.

658
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:27,092
She has taken one of the horses.

659
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:33,099
Find Esteban and look for her, Armando.

660
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,174
Please.

661
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:38,513
I can help you look for your woman.

662
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:42,772
But after she has been found,
dead or alive,

663
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,194
that is the last you will see of me.

664
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:53,490
This is all playing out
just the way we wanted.

665
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,705
Raul knows who is responsible

666
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,999
and he will take his revenge.

667
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,036
You will have a war.

668
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,752
Innocent people will be killed.

669
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,675
You should stop him.

670
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,793
Why?

671
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,926
It's just Mexicans killing Mexicans.

672
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,390
Let them kill each other.

673
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:24,609
I do not think you're funny,
señor Kevin Parker.

674
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:30,273
I wasn't trying to be funny, Mr. Blancardo.

675
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,571
And the name is Greg.

676
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:16,569
Do you think the water will
wash off your shame'?

677
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:20,281
Leave me alone, Armando.

678
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:24,085
I forbid you to swim in this place.

679
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,413
It is sacred to me.

680
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,549
Swim?

681
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,796
No.

682
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:35,596
I cannot swim.

683
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,550
No one ever taught me how to swim.

684
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:50,770
Sonia...

685
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,417
Sonia!

686
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,830
Sonia!

687
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:22,176
Please, Armando, I don't want to live.

688
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,390
You would kill yourself?

689
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,436
You are a fool!

690
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,142
I cannot live.

691
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:33,525
Don't you know there is no escape for me?

692
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:40,488
You knew what you were getting into
when you came with Raul.

693
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:44,908
Yes. Yes, I knew.

694
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,209
He talked of living on this ranch,

695
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:52,461
and said everything would be different.

696
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,416
And you believed him?

697
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,793
Yes.

698
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:56,843
No.

699
00:54:56,919 --> 00:55:00,219
I don't know...

700
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,642
Please, Armando...

701
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:07,764
Leave me alone.
Raul does not need me.

702
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,059
I have not come for Raul.

703
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,570
I have come for you.

704
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,355
Armando...

705
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,908
I am no good!

706
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:23,658
I am no better!

707
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:17,818
Look at them.

708
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:21,523
So peaceful.

709
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:32,242
I thought you said this was Raul's woman?

710
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,289
She does not look like Raul's woman to me.

711
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,370
This is Raul's woman.

712
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,923
Sonia, why are you sleeping
with this dirty rancher'?

713
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,462
Please, Uncle...

714
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,919
Well, whatever makes you happy.

715
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,967
Maybe Raul has no dick.

716
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:52,057
Lately I've been enjoying
all these dick jokes.

717
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,597
What is it that you want?

718
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:58,855
This is the land of my father.

719
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,982
You are trespassing.

720
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,359
No, we aren't trespassing.

721
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:09,491
It is you who is trespassing
on your brother's woman.

722
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:11,910
That's a good one too!

723
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,993
Leave us alone.

724
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,416
No.

725
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,830
Take her.

726
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,087
We will see if Raul wants her back.

727
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:27,387
Stay away!

728
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,931
Or I'll beat you with these hands!

729
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:34,103
No, no, no. I didn't come to fight.

730
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,438
Kill him.

731
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:41,690
It is fitting that you should die
where your mother died.

732
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,191
If you had only let me rape her,

733
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,649
she would not have died that day.

734
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,202
You.

735
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:53,747
Kiss your mother for me, Armando.

736
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,871
You coward!

737
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,627
Hold on, the gun is still hot.

738
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,424
Shut Up!

739
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,592
No.

740
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,845
Let the coyotes take him.

741
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:17,851
We must save our bullets for the brother.

742
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,694
Let's go.

743
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:42,959
Do not underestimate Raul.

744
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:50,634
Raul was foolish to come into my territory.

745
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,766
He will lose everything,

746
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,469
including you.

747
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,887
I am Yik'in Chan Kwawiil.

748
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,306
The one that darkens the sky.

749
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,055
The Jaguar King of the mountain.

750
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,138
You know me as the Onza.

751
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:07,191
Your journey has only now just begun.

752
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,314
It is the time for your vision!

753
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:23,915
<i>Mexico is no place for cowards.</i>

754
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:25,583
<i>Save your brother.</i>

755
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:26,911
<i>Save your family.</i>

756
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,666
<i>Save me.</i>

757
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,681
<i>Kiss your mother for me.</i>

758
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,660
I have hidden inside the mountains,

759
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:09,245
and you have hidden inside yourself.

760
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,877
The hiding place is irrelevant

761
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:18,053
when the hidden hide for no reason.

762
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:42,653
I will not be struck!

763
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:47,287
By man or beast!

764
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,493
I am Armando Alvarez!

765
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:50,748
Again!

766
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,546
I am Armando Alvarez!

767
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:54,964
One more time.

768
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,169
I am Armando Alvarez!

769
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,504
Good.

770
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:03,256
I am

771
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,889
Armando Alvarez.

772
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:16,353
Armando.

773
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,647
He has Sonia.

774
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,325
Good. I knew you would go with me.

775
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,526
No, Raul.

776
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,112
I'll go alone for her.

777
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,118
Little Armando...

778
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,202
Don't be a fool.

779
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,215
I have been a fool for too long.

780
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,096
Hello, this is the Onza.
How can I help you?

781
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:52,977
He has assembled a small army.

782
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,058
Let him come.

783
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,018
I am ready for him.

784
01:04:57,102 --> 01:05:00,481
Just keep the Americans away.

785
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,191
They want nothing to do with this.

786
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,072
They want you to kill each other.

787
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,370
Good.

788
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,118
After I kill Raul,

789
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:12,167
I will kill those fucking Americans.

790
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,368
Okay?

791
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:14,418
All right.

792
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,246
Bye.

793
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,802
This Onza is such a fucking coward!

794
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:26,006
Does he think he can come
into my house uninvited?

795
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,467
Does he think he can take any woman?

796
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,177
No!

797
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:34,436
I'm not going to let him kill
any more of my own flesh and blood!

798
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:38,310
This is the end of that fucking Onza!

799
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,690
You know what?

800
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,568
We won't allow him to fuck it up again!

801
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,990
This fucking Onza is done!

802
01:05:56,870 --> 01:06:03,799
You will see that your uncle can provide
you with all that Raul promised,

803
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:08,007
and much more.

804
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,433
You're so beautiful.

805
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,727
Thank you.

806
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:16,686
Ah! Bitch!

807
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:21,812
No one is coming for you.

808
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:23,147
He will come.

809
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,697
And he will kill you.

810
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:27,742
Raul?

811
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:29,953
I do not speak of Raul.

812
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,375
Are you referring to that filthy rancher?

813
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:37,543
Yes.

814
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:41,130
Little niece, you are a fool.

815
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,174
I told you a million times, I killed him.

816
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,343
He is dead.

817
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:49,889
The wind tells me he is not.

818
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:23,896
All this, just so daddy's
little girl can score a dime bag.

819
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:48,257
I'm jumping!

820
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,555
The one they call the Onza.

821
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,978
My name is Armando Alvarez.

822
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,731
I am talking to you, Onza!

823
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,479
I'm surprised to see you alive.

824
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,981
I want the girl.

825
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,564
Let her go and the two of us will leave.

826
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,652
I can kill you now with one shot.

827
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:19,080
I am only giving you this one chance.

828
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:23,418
Release the woman and I will let you live.

829
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,224
Armando, stay there.

830
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:28,308
Do you have a cigarette?

831
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:31,315
Yes.

832
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:40,116
What the fuck, Armando?

833
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,572
You never learned how to roll a cigarette.

834
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,078
I am sorry.

835
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:58,510
Damn it. I'm dying
and you're giving me this piece of shit?

836
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:04,928
I'm sorry.

837
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:05,978
Brother.

838
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,852
Yes?

839
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:12,481
She loves you.

840
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,859
I just realized this.

841
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:19,738
Go and get her.

842
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:24,072
Damn, our father would have loved
to have seen that.

843
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:25,657
Go. Go get her.

844
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,045
It's over.

845
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,292
I'm going to meet father now.

846
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,338
Stay here.

847
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,415
No.

848
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:35,500
Please.

849
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:41,465
Mexico will be a better place without me.

850
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,891
It's time.

851
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:47,697
I am Armando Alvarez.

852
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,078
I have come for your life.

853
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,626
How dare you come in like that.

854
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:55,876
Just like that, without an invitation?

855
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:58,333
You invited me when you took my woman.

856
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,339
You want her?

857
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,635
Here you go!

858
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:37,084
And now,

859
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:38,881
you both shall die!

860
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:40,879
Armando!

861
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:27,218
Oh, damn it.

862
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:31,517
I always thought that

863
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:34,596
when this moment arrived

864
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:39,105
there would be a lot of people.

865
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:42,274
A lot of TV networks.

866
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,905
Police.

867
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:49,862
The army, the president, and everything...

868
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:56,706
I won't be there, I won't
be able to see it.

869
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:03,791
Oh, shit.

870
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,847
Armando Alvarez.

871
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:01,773
You are under arrest for murder

872
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,897
and the trafficking of illegal drugs.

873
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,071
You will be extradited
to the United States,

874
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,739
where you will stand trial.

875
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,987
No, Mr. Blancardo,

876
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,152
there will be no trial.

877
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:15,621
- For my mother.
- You son of a bitch!

878
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,494
Holy shit!

879
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,750
Did you see that?

880
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,173
The greasy wetback shot him.

881
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:29,719
Son of a bitch!

882
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:32,054
It's a goddamn Mexican standoff.

883
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,389
I think I'll kill the bastard.

884
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:40,096
I speak the English perfect, Mr. DEA.

885
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:45,526
You are out of luck, wetback.

886
01:16:54,735 --> 01:17:00,993
Not all Americans are bad, Armando.

887
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:11,003
Not all Mexicans are drug dealers.

888
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,797
Are you ready, Sonia?

889
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,132
Yes.

890
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:18,468
Let's go home.

891
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,808
Bye.

892
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,723
Bye.

893
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,324
Do you want to walk?

894
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:52,585
Bye bye. Take it easy.

895
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:11,751
<i>With every season comes a change.</i>

896
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:16,301
<i>A season ends and a new one comes.</i>

897
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:20,678
<i>But now a season has come to us.</i>

898
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:25,011
<i>It's a no good season.</i>

899
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:29,940
<i>A bird has wings so he can ﬂy.</i>

900
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:34,521
<i>His home is up in the sky.</i>

901
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:39,446
<i>His home is where his heart can sing.</i>

902
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:43,701
<i>Unless he has a broken wing.</i>

903
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:51,166
<i>My whole life has been a struggle.</i>

904
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:55,876
<i>I've chased a dream within a bubble.</i>

905
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:59,553
<i>And now that dream is fading slow.</i>

906
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:06,182
<i>I've made a world only I can know</i>

907
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:12,850
<i>ls this the end of what we are?</i>

908
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:17,572
<i>What we were is long ago.</i>

909
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:22,402
<i>I will not let this come to pass.</i>

910
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:27,081
<i>My name is Armando Alvarez</i>

911
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:31,285
<i>ls there a world where love is free?</i>

912
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:35,965
<i>A world where love was meant for me.</i>

913
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:42,423
<i>Must I always fight for love?</i>

914
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:23,262
<i>I will save my family.</i>

915
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:27,675
<i>From this greed and tyranny.</i>

916
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:32,346
<i>God will help me from above.</i>

917
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:36,058
<i>Must I always.</i>

918
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:40,275
<i>I Will definitely.</i>

919
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:48,322
<i>Fight for love!</i>

920
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,669
ARMANDO AND SONIA

921
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,921
visions of love.

922
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:42,234
Hi, I'm Dan Haggerty.

923
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:45,609
You know, if you ask me,
nature is pretty damn cool.

924
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:50,075
You got trees, you got water,
you got more trees.

925
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:53,533
But there is nothing better,
and I mean, nothing better,

926
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,455
than a cool Haggerty Smoke.

927
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:58,330
Haggerty Smokes give me
exactly what I'm looking for,

928
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,498
and that's a kickass buzz.

929
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:03,964
You can get Haggerty Smokes
in your grocer's freezer department.

930
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:07,293
So you pick up yourself a pack,
they're totally tobacco free,

931
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:09,169
I wouldn't worry about the legalities,

932
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:11,255
and the next time you're out in nature,

933
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:13,386
look me up and let's get buzzed together.

934
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:14,762
I'll be looking for you.

935
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:17,014
I'm Dan Haggerty, for Haggerty Smokes.

936
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,264
Rockin', baby!

937
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:25,648
Bring your old lady too.
