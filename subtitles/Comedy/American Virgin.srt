You have reached the years where ... where ... where 
boys will begin to notice. 

15 
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:10,385 
And will begin to want 
things from you. 

16 
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:13,603 
Horrible, sick, 
disgusting things. 

17 
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:15,177 
Things that we do not offer.

What he does not want to say that 
sex is an evil thing. 

19 
00:01:17,913 --> 00:01:20,683 
Sex is a great spiritual document.

00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:22,833 
But you would have to 
never do ...

AMERICAN VIRGIN 

22 
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:30,739 
The idea is that he must 
keep your ... 

23 
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,528 
Because someday you'll meet the man 
that you your marriage. 

24 
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:34,902 
And when that happens, 
he will have eyes only for you. 

25 
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:37,346 
And at least occasionally and that of the lemon 
marketing department. 

26 
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,791 
It was the Christmas party

So until you are happy 
and married. 

30 
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:52,885 
Not even you think ... 

31 
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:55,186 
Put chewing gum 
aside. 

32 
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:57,850 
Do not want to do sex but baby, 
no that's not gum ... 

33 
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,859 
... This is a condom. 

34 
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:05,651 
Be absolutely sure you have the will 
a condom. 

35 
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:08,292 
But make sure you do not 
never use.

51 
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:16,139

which brought me here today. 

63 
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:07,471 
The College Pendington promised to 
maintain standards decenþã 

64 
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:10,963 
and morality on which this 
organization represents. 

65 
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:16,766 
And as Mary Margaret said with 
passion: "Our body, our temple. 

66 
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:20,175 
<i> Priscilla White 100% pure. </ i> 

67 
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:28,098 
It seems that just as I returned from 
college and after a few weeks ... 

68 
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:31,536 
- I do not even mention. 
- Come on honey, do not be so bad. 

69 
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,000 
Pennington and Michigan is 
a few hours away. 

70 
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,240 
Five hours and forty minutes. 

71 
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:40,465 
That if you go the speed autobandã 
constant of 80km / h. 

72 
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:42,911 
But if you're caught in a 
melee of traffic ... 

73 
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:46,360 
Okay, okay, okay, so it will be 
easy to visit us each other. 

74 
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:50,131 
- Are you sure you want this for me? 
- I'm sure. 

75 
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:57,464 
My God! 

76 
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:01,486 
- This is simply disgusting. 
- Oh! 

77 
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:03,925 
Yes, right there! 

78 
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:07,722 
And not even realize how poor woman 
horrible is exploited? 

79 
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:12,628 
Yes, it is operated at 
most miserable way. 

80 
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:16,072 
I wish only to go up there and 
to say a few words. 

81 
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:17,364 
And I. 

82 
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:22,883 
Poor her.

Yes, yes sir, yes!

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,687

85 
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,326 
College Pennington

00:05:41,912 --> 00:05:45,281 
Mother, father, goodbye, we'll call

00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:09,088

00:06:16,732 --> 00:06:17,732

00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:22,209 
Nice, so we build tunnel up 
the walls tonight.

us because in. 

95 
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:27,353

00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,736 
You want all prospãturile or 
they want and Chuck? 

97 
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:32,615 
Police know and the doctor said Sheryn 
clearly, without poliþianisme. 

98 
00:06:32,616 --> 00:06:36,290

- Hi. 
- What are you doing? 

102 
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:47,806 
I align the books that you are 
seeing titles. 

103 
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,111 
It is hard to read titles of children 
if they are to and from the large set. 

104 
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,507 
Why not separate small 
of the children? 

105 
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:56,560 
And to them out of alphabetical order? 

106 
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:58,189 
So who is mate 
your room? 

107 
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:02,762 
- Natalie Reed. 
- Naz? 

108 
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:05,282 
- A knowledge are? 
- Everybody knows. 

109 
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:07,523 
It never graduate, that will be of 
and her seventh year. 

110 
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:09,061 
You and your roommate with Naz? 

111 
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,518 
What happened with the last fellow 
room, Judy or ... 

112 
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,634 
- Jaimmy, expelled! 
- Expelled, why? 

113 
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:17,108 
Not quite sure what 
was charged ... 

114 
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:19,528 
... stuff like that happens when 
Naz is around. 

115 
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,470 
Do not you worry, not even 
so bad. 

116 
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:25,592 
No, not so bad, is in 
order, is very good. 

117 
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:28,403 
I'm proud of the fact that I 
understand by everyone 

118 
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:30,467 
and I'm sure that it will not 
be an exception. 

119 
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:57,095 
Hey, you must be ... Priscilla. 

120 
00:07:57,794 --> 00:08:00,640 
I am Naz, and you guess whose 
Roommates. 

121 
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:02,492 
Do not be ridiculous. 

122 
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,084 
Nice to meet you 
finally. 

123 
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:14,714

Ready. 

126 
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:32,286 
That is a beautiful vase. 

127 
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:34,339 
You're funny, I like that. 

128 
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:38,270 
Lord, what will the bedrooms this, 
always smells of urine. 

129 
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,337 
I remember less of Junimea. 

130 
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,134 
God, on my life, I do not get 
remember what is this. 

131 
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:54,915 
Then ... 

132 
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:00,322 
Please tell me that is a device 
back massage. 

133 
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,735 
Oh, Vlad king,

As long as you clean the after using. 

135 
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:09,854 
But that and word of warning, 
If you've never used one of this 

136 
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:11,261

137 
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:14,038 
I swear to God that you will 
shot up in the deep. 

138 
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,582 
Smile and you. 

139 
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:25,022 
- I'd like to change my roommate. 
- Well honey, I'll put the name on the list. 

140 
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,737 
And if anything, Do you and give the tire. 

141 
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:32,404 
But until that happen you with

142 
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,485

143 
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:38,874

00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,356 
He also put things in a bag 
as rectum and degenerated. 

145 
00:09:42,524 --> 00:09:47,170 
You know you, the one with the umbrella, with children,

Brad, live in Festival in October? 

148 
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,510 
What is the sound of that? 

149 
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:55,383 
Only some children gãlãgio and here 
in ... library. 

150 
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:08,537 
- Brad, I'm so missing you.

151 
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:13,674

152 
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:16,817 
- Hello! 
- Oh, and my cãþelu. 

153 
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,986 
Puicuþele a crazy! 

154 
00:10:51,588 --> 00:10:54,359 
- Dudu dear, crazy lady. 
- Honey, finally I've found. 

155 
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:57,299 
You take checks? I thought that 
I could go on Mol. 

156 
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,436 
- Need to learn. 
- Kevin, baby. 

157 
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:02,592 
- Dear, and I do that. 
- Do you do that? 

158 
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:04,714 
Let me tell you that. He did not say 
Dr. Sherry we should 

159 
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:06,905 
to work in compliance with program 
to learn of Kevin? 

160 
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:08,704 
But you should spend 
time together. 

161 
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:11,372 
It is as if Ala is prologue 
important than me. 

162 
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:12,506 
The prologue shit is killing me. 

163 
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:16,747 
- Dude, go to deliberate, is easy. 
- You are not intentional. 

164 
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:19,210 
You say this just to impress girls. 

165 
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,039 
And speaking of ... 

166 
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,958 
I think I have a new patient, 
five minutes and eat my hands. 

167 
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,882 
Enter doctor. 

168 
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:33,711 
Hi Priscilla, is a show in 
campus tonight, I want you and accompanies you? 

169 
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:35,615 
We have to learn. 

170 
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:38,639 
But it will be a unique spectacle, 
candlelight, 

171 
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,381 
books with pictures, numbers illusions. 

172 
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,750 
No thanks, we'll go another time. 

173 
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:48,565 
Ah ... yes! 

174 
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:51,904 
Hey, what happened? 

175 
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:53,116 
Who is that? 

176 
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:56,082 
Priscilla, this is John, John, my colleague 
Priscilla room. 

177 
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,931 
My name is James, actually. 

178 
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:01,302 
- Hi. 
- She is Diana. 

179 
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,812 
Sandra. 

180 
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:06,802 
We continue once, 
I lose my mood. 

181 
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:13,528 
Hey, wait, come and join us. 

182 
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:21,590 
Hi Priscilla, 
running "Made in Manhattan" 

183 
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:23,701 
students at home tonight. 
Want to come? 

184 
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,830 
I love that movie ... 
but can not. 

185 
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:31,116 
But Wednesday, want to come to 
party players? 

186 
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,757 
I friend. 

187 
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:53,459 
- So, as long as you do? 
- 18 minutes and 37 seconds. 

188 
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:59,986 
Not ... as new freshman I have 
said two words. 

189 
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,354 
Can you please do not do that. 

190 
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,988 
- Just relax, are just pictures. 
- I meant to not smoke marijuana. 

191 
00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:18,173 
Who has done on this, 
are crap. 

192 
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:21,304 
Strange composition, exposure bad. 

193 
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,535 
This is your friend? 
I like guys who have 

194 
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:28,175 
bãþul baseball back, 
have a red status as u. 

195 
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:29,903 
Give me it back. Ending. 

196 
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:33,521 
Girls who are unable to abþine 
status of sex. 

197 
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,611 
Holy shit, are you. 
It is a picture of you. 

198 
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,975 
Jokes are like, damn, you're a 
sort by Virginia Professional? 

199 
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:44,329 
Not only believe in sex before 
marriage. 

200 
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,458 
- Not even with you însãþi? 
- What? 

201 
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,611 
Do not tell me that does not put his hand 
as of and ternuturi 

202 
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:51,047 
you are in bed and not start 
some digital actions. 

203 
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:58,591 
You know you, scuturând grain of beans, 
aþâþând button and your polished piece door. 

204 
00:13:58,592 --> 00:14:02,784 
If you mean masturbation, 
if not, I do not do that. 

205 
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:05,646 
As always said Mary Margaret 
"Our body is our temple" 

206 
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:07,067 
and must be treated as such. 

207 
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:09,735 
It appears that you treat it your 
as an amusement park. 

208 
00:14:09,736 --> 00:14:11,289 
- Which Mary? 
- It does not matter. 

209 
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:18,470 
I think sex is a sacred act between: 
a man, a woman and God. 

210 
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:20,734 
- What is the right thing by hand? 
- No! 

211 
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:24,234 
Manual stimulation of the phallus is 
sexual. 

212 
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:25,445 
Handling whom? 

213 
00:14:25,446 --> 00:14:28,368 
Biggus, genitals, 
male member. 

214 
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,455 
A You mean achievement 
"tool" type? 

215 
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:32,574 
- Ah! 
- What "tools"? 

216 
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:33,683 
Tools is an ugly word! 

217 
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:35,619 
Tools, tools, instruments, tools, tools ... 

218 
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,037 
It is a colloquial expression that never has and 
wants to use. 

219 
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:40,458 
Then as you say Gainii 
men? 

220 
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:43,764 
I do not mean no man's chickens, 
I grew up on farms. 

221 
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:47,765 
- My roommate is a frisky! 
- I am crazy? 

222 
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:50,762 
- How did you get into this school? 
- I slept with the registration agent. 

223 
00:14:50,763 --> 00:14:54,165 
- That is disgusting. 
- I know, I think he had irritation. 

224 
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:56,630 
- Where you going? 
- Out. 

225 
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:01,445 
Priscilly Hey, want to live a second? 

226 
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:05,452 
I made it off with one motion, 
Imagine what they can do with the whole hand. 

227 
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:09,447 
I got the f, on C and on k, all I 
must be u! 

228 
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:15,005 
I will be in port the ship, I will go before 
to Scotland crap out of me. 

229 
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:19,981 
I think I started it a 
bring to the floor. 

230 
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:26,770 
Ready for party players? 
Puicuþele crazy one will be there. 

231 
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,100 
I can not go, I have a test tomorrow. 

232 
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:30,855 
I will stay to learn. 

233 
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:38,015 
Just kidding. In fact the test does not, 
is a big one really. 

234 
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,139 
What ashtray trick. 

235 
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,330 
I found another, this is 
that and my cuþa. 

236 
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:46,897 
You just have to sit here and you 
you read? 

237 
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:51,809 
It will be a fun party, come on, 
something we drink, we dance. 

238 
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:55,380 
- Come play with us. 
- Play with some guys. 

239 
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:57,446 
Kiss someone's name that do not know are. 

240 
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,945 
We have to learn. 

241 
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:04,164 
Want to see picture of someone who 
he has social life? 

242 
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:09,204 
If I so see, I see a 
teenage priorities straight. 

243 
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:11,339 
Jesus, no wonder 
nobody likes you. 

244 
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,977 
That is not true, everyone 
I like it. 

245 
00:16:13,978 --> 00:16:17,123 
Sure, because everyone feels so 
comfortable around you. 

246 
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:21,070 
Shit, is as if you exit with a 
nun for less fun. 

247 
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,198 
To go less and lamalelor. 

248 
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:29,040 
Do you go Already longing. 

249 
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:32,201 
Think you! 

250 
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:41,895 
Hi Brad, My roommate 
left the city in a kind of festival. 

251 
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,522 
Why not answer the phone? 

252 
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:48,046 
However, now told me that no one 
I do not like. 

253 
00:16:48,523 --> 00:16:51,231 
How can anyone not me 
like, not so? 

254 
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,629 
Anyway, my stick, 
miss you. 

255 
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,089 
Call me when you receive the message. 

256 
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:20,187 
- What studiaþi you two? 
- I get my NBA. 

257 
00:17:20,188 --> 00:17:23,348 
Yes, you know the difference between 
regression and depression? 

258 
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:25,954 
To work is a depression, 
not you? So it is. 

259 
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:27,315 
But you, what study? 

260 
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:29,829 
I study the genetics, because I hope 
to save lives someday. 

261 
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,349 
You know, identifying genes and the origin 
Their important work, right? 

262 
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:35,386 
You two should already be very 
proud of you. 

263 
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:37,249 
Now take a look at the camera and say that 
you are some dirty whores. 

264 
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,120 
I'm a dirty slut. 

265 
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:40,647 
They all go crazy when you will see. 

266 
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,434 
Now you go arãtaþi butts,

270 
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:05,865

- Nothing, because it is illegal. 

279 
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:23,590

00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:24,604 
- Exactly, you understand? 
- Yes. 

281

00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:30,898 
- Where the hell is? 
- I left it at the hotel can. 

283 
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:32,257 
Why do not you bring your fucking 
the draft with þâþele? 

284 
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,967 
- I brought the box. 
- Okay, uses a mine. 

285 
00:18:34,968 --> 00:18:37,241 
Fuck the box, give me the plan anyway. 

286 
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,508 
- Okay, so I will. 
- Okay. 

287 
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:41,081 
Okay ladies, let's see 
þâþi and some really! 

288 
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:57,010 
Basic ã knew I know that the planet 
is only 5,000 years. 

289 
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,899 
What nonsense is this, so I 
Keep on tâmpiþii 

290 
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,728 
ã knew not tell you to your 
arãtaþi breasts. 

291 
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:04,112 
Because they are amazing, I can ... 

292 
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:10,044 
It's ok, thank newcomers. 

293 
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:15,081 
It is a good doctor. 

294 
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:24,942 
I can not believe you're here. 

295 
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:29,291 
How you can support this hideous music, 
I can not sleep, can not think. 

296 
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:33,246 
Calm down, give the body 
it a chance. 

297 
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,614 
- And Nattaly, my place is here.

00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:46,745 
Just kidding, just wait five minutes,

00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:47,836 
Absolutely not.

What are you talking? 

327 
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:27,805 
Is that your bra hanging in 
outside the house of culture? 

328 
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,810 
- What? 
- Jokes are even not you remember? 

329 
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:31,767 
What you remember, all I remember

330 
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:33,597 
Ouch!

333 
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:45,880

00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,758 
- No, no, no, no! 
- Priscilla, come on, you did something stupid. 

345 
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:37,276 
Welcome to the human race. 

346 
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:41,612 
If my parents see this box, 
I will kill you. 

347 
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:45,389 
If "Cann Hurry Love" find out about it 
I will withdraw membership. 

348 
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,156 
I'll be thrown out of college. 

349 
00:24:47,396 --> 00:24:48,724 
What will I do afterwards? 

350 
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:51,446 
Can one ever to do 
adult movie. 

351 
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:55,912 
I'm your pal only 5 weeks and 
I turned into a porn star. 

352 
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,935 
Slowly, yet are not porn star. 

353 
00:24:58,936 --> 00:25:01,447 
At least not prior to your 
do first demo. 

354 
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:05,466 
Get off me! 

355 
00:25:11,883 --> 00:25:13,794 
Damn, are more impaired 
than you look. 

356 
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:15,695 
It's your fault! 

357 
00:25:15,696 --> 00:25:16,906 
My fault, how? 

358 
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:21,867 
How? You are the one who insisted to remain 
the party, thou hast drunk. 

359 
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:25,066 
Yes, but I thought that you ... 
so this is not my fault! 

360 
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:30,933 
Great, finally I get to light and 
Now I am "persona ogratan. 

361 
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:33,157 
That means people with cheese. 

362 
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:36,541 
My life is ruined. 

363 
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:39,490 
I did some researches 
About Curtzman. 

364 
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:42,397 
It is the way to Detroit for 
October Fest as we speak. 

365 
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:43,892 
All you have to do is it 
find Curtzman 

366 
00:25:43,893 --> 00:25:45,418 
and to persuade him to give us 
shooting back. 

367 
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,809 
What would be Mary Margaret, what would 
is Mary Margaret. 

368 
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,284 
We can pay with credit card 
My father's journey 

369 
00:25:50,285 --> 00:25:51,493 
and we will be there before 
sunset. 

370 
00:25:51,525 --> 00:25:54,282 
You can not go, I meditation tomorrow. 

371 
00:25:54,283 --> 00:25:57,469 
So you will not have to be a porn star and me 
can save the membership. 

372 
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,027 
Certainly. 

373 
00:25:59,028 --> 00:26:02,173 
Where we go, I will find 
on cheliosul Ala 

374 
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:04,408 
and I will look in your eyes and I will say: 
Mr 

375 
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:08,992 
are a teenager who horribly wrong 
and ask that tape back now. 

376 
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:10,368 
It is a long and sharp. 

377 
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:13,287 
Not define me, we go to 
intimitãþii doors, 

378 
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:14,288 
will travel to the center of the abyss 

379 
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:18,852 
and we find that shooting or my name 
is Priscilla White. 

380 
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,476 
This is a virgin angry. 

381 
00:26:26,874 --> 00:26:29,579 
Dude, give up, I catch a reception 
the phone here, 

382 
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,422

00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:47,866 
Hi, I'm still me. 

386 
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:52,850 
They passed around ... 5 minutes. 

387 
00:26:55,889 --> 00:27:00,239 
I forgot to tell you I love the message 
So previously, I love you. 

388 
00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:07,760 
And I remembered, if you only look at other

Do you you laugh boa and hairy and they send them 
by mail mother know. 

390 
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,224 
I can not hear it. 

391 
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:19,985 
- Oh, let him on it. 
- You fuck with me, do you? 

392 
00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:45,773 
Falsaþi!

395 
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,212 
This is my song and the Brad. 

396 
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:06,067 
I shall miss him so. 

397 
00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:18,468 
October Fest, I realize that 
will happen here. 

398 
00:28:18,469 --> 00:28:20,320 
I know, not great? 

399 
00:28:21,244 --> 00:28:22,667 
You have room? 

400 
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,933 
- The 27 plus costs. 
- Eileen.
401 
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:30,774 
Great. 

402 
00:28:35,557 --> 00:28:36,604 
What is that? 

403 
00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:38,947 
Someone left cart 
room service out. 

404 
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:41,574 
- It is half empty. 
- The fact is half full. 

405 
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:43,105 
Beer? 

406 
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:45,859 
No, no, no, I have come here and find 
on Curtzman did not happen. 

407 
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,245 
We will sleep with everybody, we begin 
early morning. 

408 
00:28:48,246 --> 00:28:52,838 
7.45 breakfast meeting on 8.20

410 
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:15,540

00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:16,750 
in the same room, 
I ever hurt? 

412 
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:19,739 
No, but see how you forget about me when I 
prepare for bed at night. 

413 
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,321 
The way I look ... yes, part of you and

417 
00:29:32,215 --> 00:29:34,823 
Of course you have, you do not believe

418 
00:29:34,824 --> 00:29:36,578 
- Tell me one.

419 
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:39,937 
Come on, boys sleep

Promiþi you not laugh?

00:29:43,304 --> 00:29:44,873 
Honestly. 

422 
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:49,818 
Okay, so start at my wedding. 

423 
00:29:51,153 --> 00:29:53,708 
I come to church even for lunch. 

424 
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,421 
Bride and her family arrive at 12.30 
photo 

425 
00:29:56,422 --> 00:29:58,599 
because the bride has lost much 
while dressing himself. 

426 
00:29:58,686 --> 00:30:00,996 
Complete preparations to 2.45

may start at 3. 

428 
00:30:04,116 --> 00:30:07,443 
Ceremony extends up to 3.30

430 
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:15,052 
Dinner at 5.30, cutting the cake at 6.35. 

431 
00:30:15,803 --> 00:30:19,355 
We leave the reception exactly 8 and 
we take a limo to the hotel. 

432 
00:30:19,356 --> 00:30:24,615 
We arrive at around 8.25, 20 
minutes to get up and you unpack. 

433 
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:31,303 
And then at 8:45 ... do. 

434 
00:30:32,024 --> 00:30:34,532 
- A do? 
- You know you, make love. 

435 
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,898 
That is great your sexual fantasy? 

436 
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:39,916 
You lose your virginity to 8.45 
nunþii the night? 

437 
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:42,771 
Plus minus 10 minute 
depending on traffic. 

438 
00:30:42,895 --> 00:30:46,854 
This gives a new understand 
phrase "ano-sex". 

439 
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:48,990 
Okay, your turn. 

440 
00:30:48,991 --> 00:30:51,271 
First is a pony. 

441 
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:55,558 
Oh, kidding, Jesus Priscilla, 
not a total pervert. 

442 
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,550 
You do not ever take anything seriously? 

443 
00:30:57,551 --> 00:31:00,089 
Life is not so far from 
serious as you think it is. 

444 
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,913 
You are a player, I am libertine, 
a free spirit. 

445 
00:31:04,608 --> 00:31:08,205 
I do not want to end the ESC in substrates, 
married high school friend. 

446 
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:11,720 
Wondering how my life would be 
when lock-n traffic in my SUV, 

447 
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:13,316 
and I'm heading towards a dead 
more boring 

448 
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:14,317 
than has ever been my life. 

449 
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:18,340 
I never imagined that 
you'm so afraid. 

450 
00:31:18,732 --> 00:31:20,768 
I am, why I'm afraid the one thousand 
this earth? 

451 
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,689 
- Maturing. 
- Maturing is for fags. 

452 
00:31:24,553 --> 00:31:27,285 
We take in Taiwan, as always do. 
Wait a second, will you? 

453 
00:31:28,343 --> 00:31:30,731 
Dulceaþo Hi, you got the package?

00:31:31,572 --> 00:31:35,469 
Exactly, exactly, yes, the instructions for

455 
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,158 
Well, try not to lose

456 
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:38,889 
Daddy loves you, wait a second. 

457 
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,499 
Hey, hey, I own you 
elevator clovnule.

00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,572 
Yes, sorry. 

459 
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:44,924 
Daddy must close 
and loves you. 

460 
00:32:00,675 --> 00:32:02,435 
You late! 

461 
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:07,005 
Natalie I'll take the east side of 
street, you guys take on the Western one. 

462 
00:32:07,006 --> 00:32:09,557 
If someone sees Curtyman 
We will call on cell. 

463 
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:12,422 
If you do not meet up to the end 
Today we meet here tonight. 

464 
00:32:16,277 --> 00:32:18,861 
You somehow heard what I spoke 
me and Natalie last night? 

465 
00:32:18,862 --> 00:32:20,655 
I do not, I fell asleep when 
when I touched the pillow. 

466 
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:22,813 
And I immediately. 

467 
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:24,760 
Well. 

468 
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:27,017 
Well, if you do not see him until then, 
we meet here tonight. 

469 
00:32:27,018 --> 00:32:29,435 
- Yes! 
- At 8.45? 

470 
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:36,344 
- Not too exaggerated. 
- What do you mean. 

471 
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:40,451 
Two people link to each other in a 
person, you know what I mean? 

472 
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:42,923 
You know, everyone, everyone 
served. 

473 
00:32:42,924 --> 00:32:46,095 
- No one to find him and never a. 
- Calm down. 

474 
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:50,753 
Maybe you should ask ... hey do you 
Pipiþele saw a guy crazy? 

475 
00:32:50,754 --> 00:32:52,149 
- What? 
- Pipiþele a crazy. 

476 
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,252 
No, no, no. 

477 
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:57,899 
All right, you need less 
self-esteem. 

478 
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,549 
Look a free entry ticket 
wonderful organization "Can not Hurry in love". 

479 
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:06,668 
Dude, like something had to search for 
Curtzman not to buy cookies. 

480 
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:08,419 
But I was looking for Curtzman. 

481 
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,087 
I love you, love you. 

482 
00:33:12,088 --> 00:33:13,721 
- Hi, honey. 
- Hi. 

483 
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:18,659 
- How you do? 
- Literally 2 minutes ago I spoke. 

484 
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,547 
- Kevin! 
- Not that he and like to talk ... 

485 
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:22,489 
- This is aggressive behavior ... 
- No! 

486 
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,774 
If you think I will not say anything 
Dr. Sheryn, wrong are wrong sir. 

487 
00:33:27,336 --> 00:33:30,580 
Well, you must exchange a banknote, 
can call you afterwards? 

488 
00:33:30,581 --> 00:33:31,858 
But soon. 

489 
00:33:34,608 --> 00:33:37,484 
Bon appétit. 

490 
00:33:38,262 --> 00:33:42,429 
So I thought we should go 
to him and to say, one is amazing. 

491 
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,348 
We went to a hockey game, 
hockey you know are so incredible. 

492 
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:48,111 
There are men come to you 
very well. 

493 
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:51,185 
So let me deal with beliefs, 
can do whatever you want. 

494 
00:33:51,186 --> 00:33:54,823 
- Come to ask here. 
- I do not get here! 

495 
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,304 
That is exactly where it 
Curtzman could go. 

496 
00:33:58,048 --> 00:34:01,361 
- No! 
- Well, we go to church to ask. 

497 
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:10,601 
Oh Lord where I put. 

498 
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,646 
It's good, it is as if you 
be in a dressing room. 

499 
00:34:14,647 --> 00:34:16,695 
Yes, where prostitutes walk. 

500 
00:34:17,198 --> 00:34:18,952 
Sit down, you go to ask whether 
saw someone. 

501 
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:21,621 
Do not touch anything, 
is a factor of infections. 

502 
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:03,591 
Natally? 

503 
00:35:12,222 --> 00:35:13,923 
Priscilla come here. 

504 
00:35:20,906 --> 00:35:24,192 
You got wrong person, think that is 
a misunderstanding. 

505 
00:35:24,193 --> 00:35:26,577 
No person ... appropriate. 

506 
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:28,217 
Relax! 

507 
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:37,841 
Lick it, lick it, lick it, lick it. 

508 
00:36:21,778 --> 00:36:24,143 
Welcome to the objective. 

509 
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,018

Priscilla White 47% pure! 

511 
00:36:38,586 --> 00:36:41,962 
- Cceii well spent there. 
- They treated me like a piece of meat. 

512 
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:45,182 
- A sex object. 
- I can not blame that tastes good. 

513 
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:48,124 
Natalie, they do not complements, 
not realize 

514 
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,938 
that men do this to intimidate 
and to intimidate women? 

515 
00:36:50,939 --> 00:36:52,768 
Well, I never thought so, 

516 
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:55,780 
I feel oppressed but must 
are grateful he had a nice ass. 

517 
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:58,747 
Congratulations, you just turned women 
40 years ago. 

518 
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:01,005 
Lord, I spent all day 
trying to help. 

519 
00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:03,841 
Help me? Throughout my future 
is in danger 

520 
00:37:03,842 --> 00:37:05,503 
and all you do is to 
you pay a guy 

521 
00:37:05,504 --> 00:37:08,218 
clopoþelul put me in front and 
to laugh at me. 

522 
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:13,010 
Do not laugh at yourself, but if you want to 
stay and to feel offended, you have only. 

523 
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:15,000 
- I will have fun! 
- Okay. 

524 
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:16,316 
Very good. 

525 
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:27,064 
- Remember it is coming. 
- In Detroit at 6.30. 

526 
00:37:27,108 --> 00:37:30,540 
Domu Curtzman ... 
"Pipiþele a crazy"! 

527 
00:37:37,753 --> 00:37:38,956 
That was great, ladies. 

528 
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:41,106 
But 35 years ago. 

529 
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,726 
I'll watch some porn for me 
delete it from the brain, 

530 
00:37:44,727 --> 00:37:46,033

00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:51,774

I miss you, call me when

534 
00:38:08,776 --> 00:38:11,284

535 
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:14,072

536 
00:38:14,073 --> 00:38:15,889 
- What?

537 
00:38:16,622 --> 00:38:19,140 
Priscilla, sweetheart, what do 
my baby? 

538 
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:21,383 
They are great, really great. 

539 
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:23,929 
Listen, I have a weird question. 

540 
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,619 
Tell me that you had 
sexual tendencies. 

541 
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,076 
Of course that never had 
sexual tendencies. 

542 
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:30,602 
No, folks, I had 
sexual tendencies. 

543 
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:34,970 
I only have about a kind of ... 

544 
00:38:34,971 --> 00:38:39,679 
I do not know what would happen if it has and 
May have membership? 

545 
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,963 
Well, if you've never had membership of 
able to go home. 

546 
00:38:42,964 --> 00:38:46,285 
You get your old job back and you study 
here to Richd cultural College. 

547 
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:49,192 
We could restore the club 
Saturday night movies. 

548 
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:52,964 
- There was nothing bad happened, do you? 
- No, nothing bad happened. 

549 
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,050 
Nothing is bad but 
I gotta go. 

550 
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:58,704 
I went to a study group, 
love you. 

551 
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:01,587 
- And we love you. 
- We are pretty disappointed. 

552 
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,152 
Hi. 

553 
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:23,250 
You complained before? 

554 
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:25,398 
No, do not complain. 

555 
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:28,728 
You do not cry, which is kind of right? 

556 
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:31,057 
My parents will disown me. 

557 
00:39:31,843 --> 00:39:36,917 
And after years of abstinenþã will be 
categorized as a slut. 

558 
00:39:38,283 --> 00:39:41,931 
- Maybe this is a good thing. 
- To be considered slut is good? 

559 
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:45,818 
No, a new beginning, a fresh start, 
change. 

560 
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:51,969 
Take, chocolate treats everything. 

561 
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:55,580 
I got it from Chuck and Kevin. 

562 
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:05,825 
It is really good. 

563 
00:40:05,826 --> 00:40:09,039 
Do not you worry, we will find 
on Curtyman. 

564 
00:40:09,695 --> 00:40:14,500 
- And if we give the tape? 
- Then I would make life a hell! 

565 
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:17,136 
And I will destroy everything you love. 

566 
00:40:17,137 --> 00:40:19,772 
And I will torture you until I 
begging to kill him, 

567 
00:40:19,773 --> 00:40:21,295 
just to get him out of misery 
in which it is located. 

568 
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:24,869 
- While you do that for me? 
- Of course. 

569 
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:27,295 
- That some friends do for others. 
- Yes. 

570 
00:40:27,854 --> 00:40:31,036 
I think are really 
întortocheaþi friends. 

571 
00:40:35,668 --> 00:40:36,862 
Do not be ridiculous. 

572 
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:01,122 
Yes, dear, keep it down, 
keep it down honey. 

573 
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:29,969 
Excuse me, you know where 
Room 396? 

574 
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:32,066 
Room 396 ... 

575 
00:41:32,067 --> 00:41:34,858 
That should be near 394. 

576 
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:38,438 
And across from 395. 

577 
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,222 
Usually go in order. 

578 
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:45,524 
At least the experience of other 
hotels where we stayed. 

579 
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,808 
This could be different. 

580 
00:41:51,494 --> 00:41:53,013 
But why? 

581 
00:41:55,654 --> 00:41:57,349 
That is the question. 

582 
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,553 
I am here for you. 

583 
00:42:03,307 --> 00:42:05,505 
- Thank you. 
- Sure. 

584 
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,522 
Natalie! 

585 
00:42:59,523 --> 00:43:01,985 
I really need to get stuff 
that with you in bed. 

586 
00:43:05,777 --> 00:43:08,901 
Come on, do not hound me with it. 

587 
00:43:13,263 --> 00:43:17,107 
Natalie, if you do not throw stuff 
that out, I will. 

588 
00:44:04,377 --> 00:44:05,680 
I fell in love. 

589 
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:08,678 
Priscilla White 25% pure. 

590 
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,145 
- You go to hell. 
- Stop all say that. 

591 
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:17,888 
- So I did a kind of a manual. 
- I never did anyone needlework. 

592 
00:44:18,191 --> 00:44:19,990 
I have worked on the rope. 

593 
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:23,911 
- How do you call this, a bank robbery? 
- I do not even know how it happened. 

594 
00:44:25,187 --> 00:44:26,843 
I ate there anything? 

595 
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:28,923 
Yes, bruneþica. 

596 
00:44:28,924 --> 00:44:31,012 
Unfortunately Chuck and Kevin 
purchased a 

597 
00:44:31,013 --> 00:44:32,783 
the less ordinary 
That the baker. 

598 
00:44:32,784 --> 00:44:33,989 
Sorry. 

599 
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,654 
Eat something, you feel better. 

600 
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,010 
I feel better? I feel better. 

601 
00:44:39,485 --> 00:44:43,212 
I was in front with înþepatã duda, 
I was drugged with illegal substances, 

602 
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,924 
and now I did a type 
a manual. 

603 
00:44:45,925 --> 00:44:48,339 
One more reason my new 
life degraded 

604 
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,114 
which can have a festive time 
I will rot in hell 

605 
00:44:50,115 --> 00:44:53,655 
since I do not have membership, 
because I removed a porn tape. 

606 
00:44:54,388 --> 00:44:57,024 
- Mary Margaret, forgive me. 
- Shut up! 

607 
00:44:57,025 --> 00:44:58,420 
I keep quiet? You shut up! 

608 
00:44:58,421 --> 00:45:00,075 
No, because there he shut up there. 

609 
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:03,421 
God, that is, 
what you say. 

610 
00:45:03,422 --> 00:45:05,695 
You have not lost at all until now 
when you saw, do you? 

611 
00:45:05,935 --> 00:45:06,866 
No! 

612 
00:45:07,066 --> 00:45:09,262 
You know exactly what you need to tell. 

613 
00:45:09,745 --> 00:45:11,593 
- Yes, I know. 
- Yes, now go. 

614 
00:45:11,594 --> 00:45:13,351 
- We'll be right behind you. 
- All right. 

615 
00:45:15,689 --> 00:45:19,745 
Stereotype psychological, sexual, emotional 
of women who win win when ... 

616 
00:45:19,746 --> 00:45:22,652 
It is when the doctor says that 
is a girl. Not correct. 

617 
00:45:22,883 --> 00:45:25,871 
Men can download off their shirts, 
can go swimming. 

618 
00:45:25,872 --> 00:45:27,499 
Q and can wash car, 
can play volleyball, 

619 
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,607 
But see two women get to him and 
off bras 

620 
00:45:29,608 --> 00:45:31,339 
like to play volleyball, men download 
lose their minds. 

621 
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:35,341 
S not only breast and times. 

622 
00:45:37,684 --> 00:45:39,830 
Everyone has breasts, 
what's the big problem. 

623 
00:45:39,831 --> 00:45:42,551 
In Europe we just laugh, 
I say: I just breasts. 

624 
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:44,478 
Say: I'm just some didi, 
what's the problem. 

625 
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:47,296 
I just didi, that's the problem. 

626 
00:45:47,297 --> 00:45:49,820 
What happened with this 
culture is ridiculous. 

627 
00:45:49,821 --> 00:45:51,219 
You know, you two should be 
arãtaþi to them. 

628 
00:45:51,803 --> 00:45:54,614 
Want to see them showing them? 

629 
00:45:56,665 --> 00:46:00,190 
Curtzman excuse me sir, are a 
Teenagers who bitterly wrong. 

630 
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,205 
If you have a tape, I hold a 
for you, 

631 
00:46:02,206 --> 00:46:04,727 
send it to us at the office and if we 
uses will give you a shirt. 

632 
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:07,468 
I have your video now 
few nights at the College of Pennington. 

633 
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:10,986 
Open your coat, get your side 
top, maybe it is my memory. 

634 
00:46:10,987 --> 00:46:14,455 
No, please, please, I really need 
shots that you have done with me. 

635 
00:46:14,456 --> 00:46:16,763 
My whole future depends on it. 

636 
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:20,240 
Look, if I had one U.S. dollars from 
Every girl who said that I would rich. 

637 
00:46:20,241 --> 00:46:22,499 
But you already are rich, then 
I would think richer. 

638 
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,179 
Curtzman Mr., Mrs. White did the 
signed any act of distribution, 

639 
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,553 
So we have reason to release actions 
legal action against you. 

640 
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:28,437 
You're a lawyer? 

641 
00:46:28,438 --> 00:46:31,301 
I Prelog, but I thought you 
Instead history book. 

642 
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:33,724 
Have been the "Gallery Bouzard" 
in Paris? 

643 
00:46:33,725 --> 00:46:36,332 
It is wonderful, a semester overseas 
Think only you. 

644 
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:39,064 
- Oh, sounds wonderful. 
- Try to expose a point here, Kevin. 

645 
00:46:39,192 --> 00:46:41,888 
Your corporation

646 
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:44,120 
on Indian tribal land 
any chance? 

647 
00:46:44,121 --> 00:46:45,541 
No! 

648 
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:49,932 
What matters, of more videos

649 
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:52,735 
So it is, some people would 
says an empire. 

650 
00:46:53,015 --> 00:46:54,733 
Look, there is nothing to your

651 
00:46:54,734 --> 00:46:56,548 
Be proud of your body that

20 years from now you will be able to

I do not want to see it a couple

So let me understand, you not liked 
puicuþele any of those? 

698 
00:49:59,683 --> 00:50:01,380 
A girl said it was a little 
too open hair. 

699 
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:02,686 
I thought it was less nice. 

700 
00:50:02,971 --> 00:50:04,687 
Too open hair?

Maybe you would like it if I

00:51:51,632 --> 00:51:53,101 
Where did it go? 

729 
00:51:53,475 --> 00:51:54,767

Priscilla is not what it seems.

00:52:13,641 --> 00:52:14,840 
Can you explain your. 

734

You were my mentor, I have relied 
you all your life. 

735 
00:52:18,544 --> 00:52:22,082 
You truly believe that is a 
virgin innocent? 

736 
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:25,828 
God, what's going on? 

737 
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,906 
God you thought! 

738 
00:52:34,853 --> 00:52:39,984 
Well ... successful with all the work 
that of Virginia. 

739 
00:52:39,985 --> 00:52:41,074 
I can not believe. 

740 
00:52:42,418 --> 00:52:43,967 
Pris ... Priscilla wait! 

741 
00:52:44,147 --> 00:52:45,818 
You're still in me. 

742 
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:54,750

The alley, with Mary Margaret 
is my model. 

745 
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,068 
That is was my model. 

746 
00:53:10,637 --> 00:53:12,049 
You are going to pay for that? 

747 
00:53:17,723 --> 00:53:19,940 
Take that, we no longer need it. 

748 
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,928 
Priscilla, this is the fifth message. 

749 
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:27,398 
Listen, I lost Curtzman,

00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,186 
What to do, you start to call the hospital 
or the convention of chastity? 

752 
00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:38,144 
I must be on the road since 
right now, stay still. 

753 
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:07,068 
- What happened to you? 
- They lied. 

754 
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:09,268 
- Who? 
- Brad, Mary Margaret. 

755 
00:54:09,428 --> 00:54:12,390 
During this time everywhere 
behind me. 

756 
00:54:12,391 --> 00:54:16,382 
Sex alley, crazy, sweaty 
and full of desire. 

757 
00:54:16,383 --> 00:54:19,271 
All Support Mary Margaret 
is a lie. 

758 
00:54:19,272 --> 00:54:21,629 
Which means that "Can Hurry Love" 
is a lie, 

759 
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,611 
which means that I am a joke. 

760 
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:26,541 
I can not believe I 
hold for him. 

761 
00:54:32,086 --> 00:54:33,885 
Let's do it. 

762 
00:54:33,886 --> 00:54:37,146 
- Right now! 
- Priscilla, are you? 

763 
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:45,850 
- Priss, wait just a second. 
- What do you mean, wait a second. 

764 
00:54:45,851 --> 00:54:50,398 
I thought just wait to do it with me 
but you have to you, that is me. 

765 
00:54:52,673 --> 00:54:54,065 
I wish, I would like. 

766 
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:01,983 
Trust me, I would like. 

767 
00:55:02,923 --> 00:55:07,074 
But not so, you're drunk, mad, and i. .. 

768 
00:55:08,787 --> 00:55:11,258 
... and do not want to be part of something 
Why will not regret. 

769 
00:55:11,922 --> 00:55:13,561 
Refuse? 

770 
00:55:15,448 --> 00:55:18,946 
Sorry ... yes. 

771 
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:23,709 
Welcome ... there are millions of 
boys înfometaþi 

772 
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:28,206 
who would die to do it, and if you do not 
want, you find someone who does. 

773 
00:55:28,207 --> 00:55:31,860 
Just calm down a second, Made in 
Manhattan will begin in a few moments 

774 
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,753 
Give him hell for Made in Manhattan,

00:55:36,855 --> 00:55:39,453 
Priscilla White 10% pure.

00:55:41,685 --> 00:55:42,882 
Priscilla wait. 

778 
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,025 
You saw Priscilla, we searched for 
everywhere and never find one. 

779 
00:55:48,026 --> 00:55:50,817 
He said that even it will shoot first 
man that I see. 

780 
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,734 
What? 

781 
00:55:52,735 --> 00:55:54,965 
It is something her friend would do 
sex with Mary Margaret. 

782 
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,165 
Now we know what it is 
Mary Margaret, and made. 

783 
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:02,270 
- Come on, gotta find one. 
- Do not you stay here in case that is-returns. 

784 
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:04,887 
- But he needs me. 
- This is a job for girls. 

785 
00:56:04,888 --> 00:56:06,182 
And you do not want to be part and that. 

786 
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,611 
I'm going to stop someone 
not to have sex 

787 
00:56:10,612 --> 00:56:13,871 
but if you say that about someone 
I will kill you. 

788 
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,454 
I swear to God! 

789 
00:56:17,558 --> 00:56:18,941 
The cigarettes? 

790 
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:42,916 
Not my usual cargo. 

791 
00:56:47,454 --> 00:56:51,087 
I know exactly what you are thinking and 
answer is YES! 

792 
00:56:51,088 --> 00:56:53,877 
If it is indeed a shirt 
Kelvin Klein. 

793 
00:56:53,878 --> 00:56:56,047 
My friend thought 
Philip is a Lymm. 

794 
00:56:56,048 --> 00:56:58,289 
Girl, I know a Kelvin Klein

802 
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:44,639 
- You can not do that. 
- Why not? 

803 
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,792 
Because it is not good, you're mad,

804 
00:57:47,793 --> 00:57:50,607 
- You're so hypocritical one. 
- I am a hypocrite? 

805 
00:57:50,919 --> 00:57:55,482 
- And how about the sacred oath. 
- I would like to not have it never did. 

806 
00:57:55,483 --> 00:57:59,795 
- I take my own decisions. 
- No, you react, do the same thing. 

807 
00:57:59,796 --> 00:58:03,026 
Are mature now and are planned. 

808 
00:58:03,027 --> 00:58:05,133 
Unlike some in which the 
greatest treasure 

809 
00:58:05,134 --> 00:58:07,897 
are some condoms and înþepenite 
vibrating batteries. 

810 
00:58:09,257 --> 00:58:11,600 
- I have a plan. 
- Excuse me! 

811 
00:58:12,064 --> 00:58:15,265 
- I have a plan.

814 
00:58:32,324 --> 00:58:34,931 
- I'm sorry.

815 
00:58:40,326 --> 00:58:42,308 
I am not a and a.

00:58:44,957 --> 00:58:46,821 
All I mean is to 
take time are. 

817 
00:58:47,564 --> 00:58:49,436 
Think what you want 
really. 

818 
00:58:51,019 --> 00:58:54,570 
And if you want to fuck with each 
boy in the city ... 

819 
00:58:55,011 --> 00:58:56,740 
... I will sustain. 

820 
00:58:57,322 --> 00:58:58,717 
Hell, even I will join.

00:59:21,586 --> 00:59:23,067 
Well, come on.

01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:19,885 
Look, I know I gave a bar,

None of you wants to-and 
show breasts. 

939 
01:06:44,715 --> 01:06:46,328 
Then you will receive shirts. 

940 
01:06:46,329 --> 01:06:50,703 
Do not want to Be Famous? 
"Pipiþele a crazy".

Best wishes for good luck

1007 
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:14,187

1009 
01:11:29,498 --> 01:11:31,734

01:11:37,488 --> 01:11:39,121 
- Are you ready?

1011 
01:12:01,552 --> 01:12:04,478

1012 
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:06,845 
Oh, God!

01:12:11,134 --> 01:12:15,308 
I was me! During this time 
I was me. 

1014 
01:12:18,872 --> 01:12:19,872 
REVOKED 

1015 
01:12:20,856 --> 01:12:23,874 
I just want to remind you that sex 
is a wonderful thing. 

1016 
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:26,291 
It is something that frankly should be 
to make it all the time. 

1017 
01:12:26,292 --> 01:12:30,420 
Exactly, except persons who 
you just have separated, 

1018 
01:12:30,421 --> 01:12:32,739 
or those who have enjoyed 
too much lately,

01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:35,795 
so I appeal to traveling 
fields of their memories. 

1020 
01:12:35,796 --> 01:12:38,889 
What seemed to others will be 
a very bad idea. 

1021 
01:12:40,379 --> 01:12:43,251 
The idea is that prevention 
is a good thing. 

1022 
01:12:43,252 --> 01:12:44,477 
Now, this is a condom, 

1023

That is the taste of grapefruit and 
This is "dark".

01:12:47,519 --> 01:12:49,530 
In fact I'll keep that one for me. 

1025 
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,771

1026 
01:12:54,946 --> 01:12:57,498 
Okay, here we go. 

1027 
01:13:08,463 --> 01:13:10,733

This ridiculous clothes tomorrow?

You think you're ready? 

1039 
01:14:07,475 --> 01:14:08,979 
I was born ready. 

1040 
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:36,660 
And deserve even the "dark". 

1041 
01:14:36,661 --> 01:14:38,806
