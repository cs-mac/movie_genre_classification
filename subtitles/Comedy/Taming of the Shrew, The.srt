1
00:00:52,142 --> 00:00:54,053
Tranio!

2
00:00:56,982 --> 00:00:58,461
Tranio!

3
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,851
Master!

4
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:03,251
Master Lucentio.

5
00:01:03,342 --> 00:01:09,019
Now, in fulfilment of my great desire
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,

6
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:13,971
I am arriv'd in fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great Italy.

7
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:23,058
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
With his good will and thy good company.

8
00:01:29,062 --> 00:01:31,815
So shall I please my
father, Lord Vincentio,

9
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:36,771
Who sent me hither from our home in Pisa,
On this, the first day of the scholar's year,

10
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:42,334
To study at the university, And deck
his fortune with my virtuous deeds.

11
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:49,698
Here let us breathe and haply institute A
course of learning and ingenious studies.

12
00:01:49,782 --> 00:01:54,060
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I'll
study Virtue, and that part of philosophy

13
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:58,454
Will I apply which treats of happiness
By virtue specially to be achiev'd.

14
00:02:04,902 --> 00:02:07,336
Tell me, Tranio,

15
00:02:07,422 --> 00:02:12,496
Tell me thy mind, for I have
Pisa left And am to Padua come

16
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:15,699
As he that leaves A shallow
plash to plunge him in the deep,

17
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:18,421
And with satiety seeks
to quench his thirst.

18
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:24,179
Why then, Lucentio, gentle master
mine. I am in all affected as yourself,

19
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:30,853
Glad that you thus continue your resolve
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.

20
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:36,818
Tranio!

21
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:43,978
But... let us not be so confined by
learning That love becomes an outcast...

22
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:48,336
quite abjur'd.

23
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:02,212
No profit grows where is
no pleasure taken. Huh?

24
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:05,972
Master?

25
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,053
Master?

26
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:54,813
Lucentio!

27
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:28,251
Come scholar come scholar Tell me true

28
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:33,621
What can I teach you to do do do?

29
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:40,458
Teach me no scholarship nor no trade

30
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:47,018
Teach me to tumble thee
My little pretty maid

31
00:06:31,462 --> 00:06:34,181
Lucentio? Lucentio!

32
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:39,053
Lucentio!

33
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,173
Lucentio!

34
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:46,661
Lucentio.

35
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:49,620
Master.

36
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:27,053
Unveil! Unveil!

37
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:33,332
Away!

38
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:36,618
Unveil! Unveil!

39
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:38,932
Who would his love bestow

40
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:41,536
On looks he may never know?

41
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:46,138
Lady unveil unveil unveil
Beauty's a thing to show

42
00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:49,578
To show

43
00:07:54,022 --> 00:08:01,781
O let me tell gentle maiden Let me tell

44
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:08,415
If it be true That thy
beauty casts a spell

45
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:14,418
If true it be Take
pity and give me leave

46
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:20,134
To do for thee All that Adam did for Eve

47
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:26,695
I'll do it well gentle
maid I'll do it well

48
00:08:29,662 --> 00:08:31,653
Bianca!

49
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:55,860
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
If I achieve not that young modest girl.

50
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,933
Wha...

51
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:05,181
Is it possible That love should
of a sudden take such hold?

52
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:08,541
Bianca!

53
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:11,932
Haste to the house. Your sister is mad.

54
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:22,302
Out of my way, fool!

55
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:09,016
Bianca! Bianca!

56
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:22,733
- Bianca... Bianca! Bian...
- Signor Baptista...

57
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,576
Gentlemen, importune me no further,
For how I firmly am resolv'd you know,

58
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:31,690
Not to bestow my younger daughter Bianca
Before I have a husband for the elder.

59
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:32,771
What?

60
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:35,296
Before I have a husband for the elder!

61
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:39,696
If either of you two love Katharina,

62
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:42,171
Leave shall you have to
court her at your pleasure.

63
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:45,459
O, hideous pleasure.
She's too rough for me.

64
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:53,057
I pray you, Father, is it your will To
make a whore of me among these mates?

65
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:55,531
Mates, maid, how mean you that?

66
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:59,297
No mates for you Unless you
were of milder, gentler mould.

67
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:06,015
I' faith, sir, you shall have no need to
fear. Such mating is not half way to my heart.

68
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:12,371
But if it were, doubt not my care should be
To paint your face, and use you like a fool.

69
00:11:13,262 --> 00:11:16,254
And comb your noddle
with a three-legg'd stool.

70
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:22,494
That wench is stark mad...
or wonderful forward.

71
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:27,856
But in the other's silence I do see
Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.

72
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:34,734
Let it not displease thee, good Bianca, For
I will love thee none the less... my girl.

73
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:37,097
You are my most obedient
and loving daughter.

74
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:39,093
Pretty pet!

75
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:45,493
O, sister, content you in my discontent.

76
00:11:50,662 --> 00:11:54,337
Sir, to your pleasure
humbly I subscribe.

77
00:11:55,022 --> 00:11:57,695
My books and instruments
shall be my company,

78
00:11:57,782 --> 00:12:00,660
On them to look and practise by myself.

79
00:12:00,742 --> 00:12:05,532
O, Tranio, thou may'st
hear a goddess speak.

80
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:07,214
Go in, Bianca.

81
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:12,820
O, no! Why, will you lock her up,
Signor Baptista, for this fiend of hell,

82
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:15,097
And make her bear the
penance of her tongue?

83
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:17,855
- Gentlemen, content ye. I am resolv'd.
- But...

84
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:23,653
And for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments, and poetry,

85
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:27,257
Schoolmasters will I keep within
my house Fit to instruct her youth.

86
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:31,654
If you, Hortensio, or Signor Gremio,
you, Know any such, conduct them hither;

87
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:36,497
for to schoolmasters I will
be very kind. And so farewell.

88
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:41,213
- Fiend of hell!
- Schoolmasters...

89
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:48,618
If you love the maid, Bend
thoughts and wits to achieve her.

90
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:52,377
Thus it stands: Her elder
sister is so curst and shrewd

91
00:12:52,462 --> 00:12:56,819
That till the father rids his hands of her,
Master, your love must lie a maid at home.

92
00:12:56,902 --> 00:13:00,212
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!

93
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:06,452
But... art thou not
advis'd he took some care

94
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:09,340
To get her cunning
schoolmasters to instruct her?

95
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,413
I have it, Tranio.

96
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:14,699
By my hand, Master, Both our
inventions meet and jump in one.

97
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:16,454
Shh!

98
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:20,694
You will be the schoolmaster, And
undertake the teaching of the maid.

99
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:22,693
We have not yet been seen in any house,

100
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:27,219
Nor can we be distinguish'd
by our faces For man or master.

101
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:29,099
Then it follows thus:

102
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:34,575
Rhou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son.

103
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:38,701
I am content to be Lucentio,
Because so well I love Lucentio.

104
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:41,774
Keep house, and port,
and servants, as I should;

105
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:47,380
And introduce me as a schoolmaster, Fit
to instruct Baptista's youngest daughter.

106
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:50,657
'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so.

107
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,733
Shh.

108
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:59,653
You...!

109
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:06,013
Signor Gremio!

110
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:10,812
A truce to our enmity, For the time
it profits us better to be friends.

111
00:14:10,902 --> 00:14:12,893
This matter toucheth us both.

112
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:15,416
We may yet again have
access to our fair mistress

113
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:17,572
And be happy rivals for Bianca's love,

114
00:14:17,662 --> 00:14:20,176
If we labour to effect
one thing especially.

115
00:14:20,262 --> 00:14:23,732
- What's that, I pray?
- Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.

116
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,813
A husband? A devil.

117
00:14:25,902 --> 00:14:27,893
- I say a husband.
- I say a devil.

118
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:32,180
Now thinkest thou, Hortensio,
though her father be very rich,

119
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:35,857
any man is such a fool
as to be married to hell?

120
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,456
No!

121
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:43,741
Rush, Gremio. Though it pass your patience
and mine to endure her loud alarums,

122
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:49,215
why, man, there be good fellows in the
world, if one could but light on them,

123
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:53,136
would take her with all her faults,
for the sake of her father's fortune.

124
00:14:53,222 --> 00:14:55,338
I would not do it for a mine of gold.

125
00:14:56,622 --> 00:15:02,333
Help Katharina to a hus...band and
we help Bianca to become a wife.

126
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:03,775
Thine or mine?

127
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,695
He that runs fastest gets the
ring. How say you, Signor Gremio?

128
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:09,854
- I am agreed. There must be such a man.
- Yes.

129
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,292
I would give the best horse in Padua

130
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:17,421
to whoever would thoroughly woo her, wed
her, bed her, and rid the house of her.

131
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:20,096
There must be such a man.

132
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:23,136
There must be such a man.

133
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:31,212
- There must be such a man.
- Out of my path!

134
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:36,501
- O, Grumio!
- Huh?

135
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:39,016
Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.

136
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:41,935
Knock, sir? Whom should I knock?

137
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:43,091
Aha!

138
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:45,457
Is there any man has
rebused your worship?

139
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,976
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.

140
00:15:48,062 --> 00:15:50,018
Knock you where, sir?

141
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:56,135
Knock me at my friend Hortensio's gate, And
rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.

142
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,816
Ah! My master is grown quarrelsome.

143
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:02,577
I should knock you first, And then
I know after who comes by the worst.

144
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,381
Sirrah, will you not
knock? Or I'll ring it.

145
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:10,297
- Masters! Help, masters! My master is mad.
- Ring when I tell you.

146
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:12,373
Masters!

147
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:23,210
Hortensio. Ah! Well met, my
dearest friend, Hortensio.

148
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:25,293
Petruchio!

149
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:28,140
What's the matter?

150
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:30,531
Rise, Grumio, rise.

151
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:34,251
If this be not a lawful cause for me
to leave his service, look you, sir.

152
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:35,934
He bid me knock...

153
00:16:36,022 --> 00:16:41,096
Senseless villain. Signor Hortensio,
I bade this rascal knock upon my gate,

154
00:16:41,182 --> 00:16:44,458
- And could not for my heart get him to do it.
- Knock at the gate? O heavens!

155
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:47,693
Spake you not the words
plain, "Knock me here..."?

156
00:16:47,782 --> 00:16:50,854
Sirrah, be gone, or
talk not, I advise you.

157
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:55,220
Signor Petruchio, what happy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?

158
00:16:55,622 --> 00:16:58,694
You and your trusty,
pleasant servant Grumio.

159
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:01,899
Signor Hortensio,
thus it stands with me:

160
00:17:01,982 --> 00:17:05,213
Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,

161
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:10,176
And I have... thrust
myself into this maze,

162
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:14,335
Haply as best I may
to... thrive and wive.

163
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:17,451
To...?

164
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:19,737
Thrive and wive.

165
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:23,890
Wive... saidst thou?

166
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:46,419
Her father is Baptista Minola, An
affable and courteous gentleman.

167
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:49,335
Her name is... Katharina Minola.

168
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:52,897
There.

169
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:59,977
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee,
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?

170
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:06,495
Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel,
And yet I promise thee she shall be rich,

171
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:09,496
And very rich.

172
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:14,933
But then, th'art too much my friend,
And I'll not wish thee to her.

173
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:20,779
O' my word, and she knew him as well as I do,
she'd think scolding would do him little good.

174
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:27,218
Signor Hortensio, 'twixt such
friends as we Few words suffice;

175
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:31,500
And therefore, if you know One
rich enough to be Petruchio's wife -

176
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:35,177
Since wealth's the burden
of my wooing dance -

177
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:41,492
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,

178
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:46,781
As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,

179
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:50,457
She moves me not, or not removes
at least Affection's edge in me,

180
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:55,093
Were she as rough As are
the swelling Adriatic seas.

181
00:18:55,182 --> 00:19:02,293
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.

182
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:09,376
Nay, look you, sir, he tells
you flatly what his mind is.

183
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:12,454
Why, give him gold enough
and marry him to a puppet,

184
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,976
or an old trot with
ne'er a tooth in her head,

185
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:19,055
and though she have as many
diseases as two and fifty horses.

186
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:23,181
Why, nothing comes amiss,
so money comes withal.

187
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:31,341
Crowns have I in my
purse, and goods at home,

188
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:35,176
And so am come abroad to see the world.

189
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:39,341
To find a fortune and to woo...

190
00:19:42,662 --> 00:19:44,698
a wife.

191
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:48,138
And when I came at last to wife

192
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:50,417
With a heigh-ho

193
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:52,857
The wind and the rain

194
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:58,096
By swaggering could I never thrive

195
00:19:58,182 --> 00:20:06,260
For the rain it raineth every day

196
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:14,536
I will not sleep,
Hortensio, till I see her.

197
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:19,734
With a heigh-ho

198
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:23,415
The wind and the rain

199
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:30,337
For the rain it raineth every

200
00:20:33,822 --> 00:20:35,813
By swaggering

201
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:43,856
By swaggering could I never thrive

202
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:51,180
For the rain it raineth every day

203
00:21:54,142 --> 00:22:00,615
When that I was a tiny little boy

204
00:22:02,382 --> 00:22:04,657
With a heigh-ho

205
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:07,976
The wind and the rain

206
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:14,138
A foolish thing was but a toy

207
00:22:15,662 --> 00:22:17,812
The rain it raineth

208
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:48,453
Now, Petruchio.

209
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:53,293
If I do...

210
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:56,340
If I do plot thy match with Katharina,
There is a favour I would ask of thee:

211
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:58,856
To help me woo her
younger sister, Bianca.

212
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:02,093
Ask it, and so it be
not gold, 'tis grant'd.

213
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:04,332
Then shall my friend
Petruchio do me grace,

214
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:08,893
And offer me disguis'd in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster.

215
00:23:09,022 --> 00:23:11,217
As a schoolmaster.

216
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:16,741
Well versed in music, to instruct Bianca,
That so I may by this device at least

217
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:21,850
Have leave and leisure to make love to
her, And unsuspected woo her by myself.

218
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,615
Unrecognised by ancient Gremio!

219
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:43,895
'Tis Gremio, the rival of my love.

220
00:23:44,902 --> 00:23:47,132
God save you, Signor Gremio.

221
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:50,214
And you are well met, Signor Hortensio.

222
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:55,696
Know you where I am going? To Baptista.

223
00:23:55,782 --> 00:24:00,139
I promis'd to enquire most carefully
About a schoolmaster for fair Bianca,

224
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:02,577
And by good fortune...

225
00:24:03,302 --> 00:24:05,372
Cambio!

226
00:24:05,462 --> 00:24:09,137
.. I have lighted
well on this young man.

227
00:24:10,942 --> 00:24:12,898
Go on now.

228
00:24:12,982 --> 00:24:15,371
A proper stripling and an amorous.

229
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:19,694
'Tis well. And I have here another
gentleman, Signor Petruchio of Verona,

230
00:24:19,782 --> 00:24:25,061
Who will undertake to woo the curst Katharine,
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.

231
00:24:25,142 --> 00:24:30,933
O sir, such a life with
such a wife were strange.

232
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:37,780
But if you have a stomach to't, a God's
name, You shall have me assisting you in all.

233
00:24:37,862 --> 00:24:41,411
But will you woo this wildcat?

234
00:24:41,502 --> 00:24:44,414
And will I live?

235
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:58,413
Signor Petruchio.

236
00:25:13,702 --> 00:25:18,014
- I'll mar thee till no man dare look on thee.
- No... No. No!

237
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:21,617
- No!
- Take that! And that!

238
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:31,375
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?

239
00:25:31,462 --> 00:25:36,536
Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?

240
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:41,571
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?

241
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,413
Have not I in a pitched battle heard

242
00:25:49,502 --> 00:25:52,699
Loud 'larums, neighing
steeds, and trumpets' clang?

243
00:25:52,782 --> 00:25:55,455
Let me crack thee!

244
00:25:58,262 --> 00:26:00,332
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,

245
00:26:00,422 --> 00:26:05,621
That gives not half so great a blow to
hear As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?

246
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:10,219
Rush, tush, fear boys with bugs!

247
00:26:31,942 --> 00:26:34,820
Nay, I will swear so loud.

248
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:38,817
O, no! Sister, no!

249
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:55,422
O, good sister, wrong me
not, nor wrong yourself,

250
00:26:55,502 --> 00:26:57,970
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me.

251
00:26:58,622 --> 00:27:00,817
Minion!

252
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:06,295
Of all thy suitors here I charge
thee tell Whom dost thou lov'st best.

253
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:26,860
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive

254
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:32,938
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other.

255
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:36,091
Minion, thou liest.

256
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,456
Katharina! Katharina!
Bianca! Daughters! Daughters!

257
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,099
What, in my sight?

258
00:27:53,182 --> 00:27:56,299
Ah, Bianca, get thee in.

259
00:27:57,782 --> 00:28:00,057
Why dost thou wrong her
that did ne'er wrong thee?

260
00:28:00,142 --> 00:28:03,134
When did she cross
thee with a bitter word?

261
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:09,732
Nay, now I see She is your
treasure, she must have a husband,

262
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:13,576
I must dance barefoot
on her wedding-day.

263
00:28:25,822 --> 00:28:27,813
Daughter Katharina, I pray you!

264
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:33,818
Talk not to me, I will go sit and weep,
Till I can find occasion for revenge.

265
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:37,019
Katharina! Katharina!

266
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,412
Signor Baptista.

267
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:46,619
Good morrow, good my neighbour.

268
00:28:46,902 --> 00:28:52,454
Neighbour, I promis'd to enquire most
carefully about a schoolmaster for fair Bianca,

269
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:58,651
Well read in poetry and other books.
And by good fortune, I have lighted well.

270
00:28:58,742 --> 00:29:01,779
Neighbour, I freely give
unto you this young scholar,

271
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:04,501
that hath long been studying at Rheims

272
00:29:04,582 --> 00:29:08,257
and other universities where
he has acquir'd his learning;

273
00:29:08,342 --> 00:29:10,378
cunning in Latin...

274
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:23,132
And Greek... and other languages.

275
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:27,374
- His name is Cambio. Pray accept his service.
- Master!

276
00:29:27,462 --> 00:29:29,737
A thousand thanks, Signor.

277
00:29:29,822 --> 00:29:31,050
Welcome.

278
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:35,055
May I be so bold as to ask
the cause of your coming?

279
00:29:35,142 --> 00:29:41,297
Ya! Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine
own, That, being a stranger in this city here,

280
00:29:41,382 --> 00:29:46,820
Do make myself a suitor to your
daughter, Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.

281
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:50,451
- Signor...
- Lucentio is my name.

282
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,898
His name is Litio, born in Mantua.

283
00:29:54,982 --> 00:29:59,897
Lucentio is my name, And I, this
little packet of Greek and Latin...

284
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:09,218
- Enough!
- Lucentio!

285
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:20,414
Pray, have you not a daughter
Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?

286
00:30:22,102 --> 00:30:26,095
I have a daughter,
sir, call'd Katharine.

287
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:31,337
And I, sir, if I get your daughter's love,
What dowry shall I have with her as wife?

288
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:35,815
Nay, nay! You are too
blunt, go to it orderly.

289
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:39,102
But whence are you?

290
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:41,935
What may I call your name?

291
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:48,097
Signor Baptista, my business asketh
haste, And every day I cannot come to woo.

292
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:51,731
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, That
hearing of her beauty and her wit,

293
00:30:51,822 --> 00:30:56,816
Her affability and gentle modesty, Her
wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,

294
00:30:56,902 --> 00:31:00,053
Am bold to show myself a
forward guest Within your house,

295
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:04,738
To make mine eye the witness Of
that report I have so often heard.

296
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:10,613
Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,
A man well known throughout all Italy.

297
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:18,577
Now, sir... if I get your daughter's love,
What dowry shall I have with her as wife?

298
00:31:23,702 --> 00:31:26,136
After my death...

299
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:29,133
the one half of my lands,

300
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:34,261
And in possession...

301
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:38,775
twenty thousand crowns.

302
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:44,859
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray Let
us that are poor petitioners speak too.

303
00:31:44,942 --> 00:31:52,895
And... for that dowry I'll assure her of
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,

304
00:31:52,982 --> 00:31:56,418
With all my lands and leases whatsoever.

305
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:05,299
Signor Antonio's son!

306
00:32:06,302 --> 00:32:10,898
- Litio...
- Take you the lute, you the set of books.

307
00:32:10,982 --> 00:32:13,940
You shall go see your pupils.

308
00:32:14,942 --> 00:32:16,660
Within!

309
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:20,291
Sirrah, lead these
gentlemen to my daughters.

310
00:32:20,382 --> 00:32:24,091
Tell her they are her
tutors. Bid her use them well.

311
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:40,500
- With...
- All my lands and leases whatsoever.

312
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:45,454
Let specialties be therefore drawn between
us, That covenants may be kept on either hand.

313
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:49,296
Ay, when one special
thing is well obtain'd,

314
00:32:49,382 --> 00:32:51,612
I mean, her love;

315
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:53,897
for that is all in all.

316
00:32:59,502 --> 00:33:03,336
Why, that is nothing.
For I tell you, Father,

317
00:33:09,942 --> 00:33:12,820
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;

318
00:33:12,902 --> 00:33:15,177
And where two raging
fires meet together,

319
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:17,935
They do consume the thing
that feeds their fury.

320
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:24,860
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.

321
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:30,141
So I to her, and so she yields to me,
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.

322
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:35,056
Vile instrument!
Fat-fingered gut plucker!

323
00:33:35,142 --> 00:33:37,736
Twangling Jack!

324
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:43,454
But be thou arm'd for...

325
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:46,659
some unhappy words.

326
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:51,654
Signor Baptista! Master! Master!

327
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,540
How now, my friend, why
dost thou look so pale?

328
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,658
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.

329
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:03,210
And will my daughter
prove a good musician?

330
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:05,293
She'll sooner prove a soldier.

331
00:34:05,382 --> 00:34:08,499
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.

332
00:34:11,062 --> 00:34:16,455
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench.
O, how I long to have some chat with her.

333
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:24,134
Come with me, and be not so discomfited.

334
00:34:24,382 --> 00:34:28,170
Proceed in practice
with my younger daughter.

335
00:34:57,822 --> 00:35:02,179
Say that she rail, why
then I'll tell her plain

336
00:35:02,262 --> 00:35:05,413
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.

337
00:35:06,902 --> 00:35:09,177
Say that she frown,

338
00:35:09,262 --> 00:35:14,416
I'll say she looks as clear As
morning roses newly wash'd with dew.

339
00:35:16,222 --> 00:35:18,611
Say she be mute and
will not speak a word,

340
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:24,220
Then I'll commend her volubility, And
say she uttereth piercing eloquence.

341
00:35:25,342 --> 00:35:31,497
If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
As though she bid me stay by her a week.

342
00:35:33,662 --> 00:35:36,096
If she refuse to wed...

343
00:35:37,062 --> 00:35:39,656
refuse to wed,

344
00:35:39,742 --> 00:35:44,213
I'll crave the day When I
shall ask the banns, and...

345
00:35:44,302 --> 00:35:46,293
when be married.

346
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:10,817
Good morrow, Kate.

347
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,452
That's your name, I hear.

348
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:29,981
Well have you heard, but
something hard of hearing;

349
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,259
They call me Katharine
that do talk of me.

350
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:41,097
You lie, I' faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;

351
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:47,655
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,

352
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:52,862
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore,
Kate, Take this of me, Kate of my consolation,

353
00:36:52,942 --> 00:36:55,695
Hearing thy mildness
prais'd in every town,

354
00:36:58,142 --> 00:37:02,260
Yhy virtues spoken of,
and thy beauty sounded,

355
00:37:02,342 --> 00:37:05,812
Yet not so deeply as thou dost deserve,

356
00:37:05,902 --> 00:37:09,781
Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.

357
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,171
Mov'd?

358
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:16,139
In good time!

359
00:37:16,222 --> 00:37:19,692
Let him that mov'd you
hither Remove you hence.

360
00:37:19,782 --> 00:37:21,773
I knew you at the first
You were a movable.

361
00:37:21,862 --> 00:37:23,932
Why, what's a movable?

362
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:27,492
- A stool. Like this!
- Then, sit on me.

363
00:37:28,502 --> 00:37:31,414
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.

364
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:33,618
Women are made to bear, and so are you.

365
00:37:33,702 --> 00:37:36,614
Not such a load as
yours, if me you mean.

366
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:39,853
Nay, come, good Kate,
I will not burden thee!

367
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:42,297
For, knowing thee to
be but young and light -

368
00:37:42,382 --> 00:37:44,737
Too light for such a
swain as you to catch.

369
00:37:44,822 --> 00:37:47,416
Father! This man...

370
00:37:59,062 --> 00:38:02,850
Vincentio, my father, hath no
less than three great argosies,

371
00:38:02,942 --> 00:38:07,652
Besides two merchant ships
And twelve light galleys.

372
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:09,539
Twelve?

373
00:38:16,102 --> 00:38:21,051
- Hic ibat Simois hic est Sigeia tellus
- Nay, leave his lecture.

374
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:24,100
Fiddler, forbear. You
grow too forward, sir.

375
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:28,300
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katharine welcom'd you withal?

376
00:38:28,382 --> 00:38:31,977
Wrangling pedant! This is The
patroness of heavenly harmony.

377
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:36,135
Preposterous ass! You may go
walk, and give me leave awhile.

378
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:38,941
- Go tune your instrument.
- My instrument's in tune.

379
00:38:39,022 --> 00:38:41,536
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

380
00:38:41,622 --> 00:38:44,216
Think upon that, sir,
and keep your place.

381
00:38:44,302 --> 00:38:46,611
You'll leave his lecture
when I am in tune?

382
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:49,421
That will be never.

383
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:51,211
Hic ibat Simois

384
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:31,493
Good morrow, Kate. Good
Kate. I am a gentleman...

385
00:39:31,582 --> 00:39:33,857
That I'll try.

386
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:43,099
Come, come, you wasp; I'
faith, you are too angry.

387
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:46,419
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

388
00:39:46,502 --> 00:39:49,221
My remedy, then, is to pluck it out.

389
00:39:49,702 --> 00:39:52,262
Ay, if the fool could
find where it lies.

390
00:39:52,342 --> 00:39:55,334
Who knows not where a wasp doth
wear his sting? In his tail.

391
00:39:55,422 --> 00:39:57,572
- In his tongue.
- Whose tongue?

392
00:39:57,662 --> 00:40:01,655
Yours, if you talk of
tales, and so farewell.

393
00:40:14,782 --> 00:40:16,932
What, with my tongue in your tail?

394
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,931
Oh!

395
00:40:22,502 --> 00:40:29,772
- I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
- If... If you strike me, you are no gentleman.

396
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:10,970
Now, Kate, I am a
husband for your choice...

397
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:14,338
- You rogue!
- For by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,

398
00:41:14,422 --> 00:41:17,334
Thy beauty that doth
make me like thee well...

399
00:41:17,422 --> 00:41:23,418
- Monstrous villain, go!
- Rhou must be married to no man but me.

400
00:42:12,862 --> 00:42:15,820
Thou must be married to no man but me.

401
00:42:15,902 --> 00:42:18,291
For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,

402
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:23,854
To bring you from a wildcat to a Kate
Conformable as other household Kates.

403
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:33,420
Conformable as other household Kates.

404
00:42:41,782 --> 00:42:43,932
No!

405
00:42:56,662 --> 00:42:59,813
Thou canst not frown, thou
canst not look askance,

406
00:42:59,902 --> 00:43:02,621
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,

407
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:06,651
Nor hast thou pleasure
to be cross in talk.

408
00:43:06,742 --> 00:43:10,018
But thou with mildness
entertain'st thy wooers,

409
00:43:10,102 --> 00:43:13,538
With gentle conference,
soft and affable.

410
00:43:13,862 --> 00:43:19,858
And will you, nill you,
I... will... marry... you.

411
00:43:23,302 --> 00:43:25,941
I'd rather die!

412
00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:28,217
- Katharina!
- My twenty thousand crowns.

413
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:32,500
Katharina!

414
00:43:36,262 --> 00:43:39,777
Signor Baptista! Signor
Baptista! Katharina!

415
00:43:50,262 --> 00:43:52,696
Katharina! Daughter!

416
00:43:53,702 --> 00:43:56,170
Call you me daughter?

417
00:43:56,262 --> 00:44:00,255
Now I promise You have show'd
a tender fatherly regard

418
00:44:00,342 --> 00:44:05,814
To wish me wed to one half lunatic,
A madcap ruffian and a swearing Jack,

419
00:44:05,902 --> 00:44:09,178
Who thinks with oaths
to face the matter out.

420
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:16,612
Signor Petruchio,

421
00:44:16,702 --> 00:44:18,932
how speed you with your wooing?

422
00:44:19,022 --> 00:44:22,651
How but well, sir? How but well? It
were impossible I should speed amiss.

423
00:44:44,062 --> 00:44:46,815
In sooth, you scape not so.

424
00:44:46,902 --> 00:44:49,814
I chafe you, if I tarry. Let me go.

425
00:44:51,582 --> 00:44:54,460
'Twas told me you were
rough, and coy, and sullen,

426
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:57,102
And now I find report a very liar;

427
00:44:57,182 --> 00:45:01,221
For thou art pleasant,
gamesome, passing courteous,

428
00:45:01,302 --> 00:45:05,341
And slow in speech, but
sweet as spring-time flowers.

429
00:45:07,142 --> 00:45:09,576
Where did you study
all this goodly speech?

430
00:45:09,662 --> 00:45:13,052
It is extempore, from my mother-wit.

431
00:45:13,142 --> 00:45:15,861
A witty mother, with a witless son.

432
00:45:15,942 --> 00:45:18,092
Am I not wise?

433
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,332
Enough to keep you warm.

434
00:45:20,422 --> 00:45:23,698
Marry, so I mean to warm me in thy bed.

435
00:45:25,942 --> 00:45:29,821
And will you, nill
you, I will marry you.

436
00:45:40,182 --> 00:45:42,901
Why does the world report
that Kate doth limp?

437
00:45:42,982 --> 00:45:48,375
O slanderous world! Kate like the
hazel-tree is straight and slender,

438
00:45:48,462 --> 00:45:53,775
and brown in hue as hazel-nuts
and sweeter than the kernels.

439
00:46:53,222 --> 00:46:55,941
- Signor Baptista...
- Gentlemen, content you,

440
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,582
I will compound this strife.

441
00:46:58,662 --> 00:47:01,051
'Tis deeds must win the prize,

442
00:47:01,142 --> 00:47:04,339
And he among you Who can assure
my daughter greatest wealth

443
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:07,539
Shall have Bianca's love.

444
00:47:07,622 --> 00:47:09,294
Shh.

445
00:47:11,182 --> 00:47:16,210
Here comes your father. Never make denial;
I must and will have Katharine for my wife.

446
00:47:35,902 --> 00:47:40,100
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?

447
00:47:43,022 --> 00:47:46,139
But now, Baptista, to
your younger daughter.

448
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,851
I...

449
00:47:50,942 --> 00:47:54,139
I must confess your offer is the best.

450
00:47:54,982 --> 00:47:57,132
Albeit his father sign the covenant.

451
00:47:57,222 --> 00:47:59,258
Albeit he hath a father so to sign.

452
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:04,132
And if your father make her
the assurance, She is your own.

453
00:48:17,062 --> 00:48:19,212
Signor Petruchio.

454
00:48:19,502 --> 00:48:21,777
Father.

455
00:48:22,982 --> 00:48:27,931
'Tis thus: yourself and all the world That
talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her.

456
00:48:28,022 --> 00:48:30,616
She is not proud, but
modest as the dove.

457
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:33,660
She is not hot, but
temperate as the morn.

458
00:48:33,742 --> 00:48:36,814
And to conclude, we have
'greed so well together

459
00:48:36,902 --> 00:48:39,621
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

460
00:48:41,622 --> 00:48:44,853
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

461
00:48:57,622 --> 00:49:03,538
'Twas bargain'd 'twixt us, when we were alone,
That she shall still seem curst in company.

462
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,061
Of all things living, a man's the worst.

463
00:49:08,142 --> 00:49:11,339
I tell you 'tis incredible to
believe How much she loves me.

464
00:49:11,422 --> 00:49:15,210
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

465
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:19,932
O, my sweet Katharina.
O, the kindest Kate!

466
00:49:20,022 --> 00:49:25,301
She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,

467
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:28,260
That in a twink she won me to her love.

468
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:35,297
O, you are novices. 'Ris a world to
see, When she and I are both alone,

469
00:49:35,382 --> 00:49:40,456
How tame a milksop wretch
can make the cursest shrew.

470
00:49:54,262 --> 00:49:58,050
Of all things living, a man's the worst.

471
00:49:58,142 --> 00:50:00,292
Petruchio!

472
00:50:13,142 --> 00:50:16,976
Father and friends...
Father and friends, adieu.

473
00:50:17,062 --> 00:50:20,577
I will to Venice To buy
apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.

474
00:50:21,062 --> 00:50:25,021
We will have rings, and
things, and fine array,

475
00:50:26,502 --> 00:50:29,335
And... kiss me, Kate,

476
00:50:29,422 --> 00:50:32,175
we will be married o' Sunday.

477
00:51:24,222 --> 00:51:25,974
Ring-a-ding
ring-a-ding

478
00:51:26,062 --> 00:51:28,530
Hark to the steeple ringing

479
00:51:28,622 --> 00:51:31,216
Ring-a-ding
ring-a-ding

480
00:51:31,302 --> 00:51:33,941
Ding-dong bell

481
00:51:46,382 --> 00:51:49,260
Signor Baptista!

482
00:52:07,422 --> 00:52:10,380
Katharina?

483
00:52:14,182 --> 00:52:16,173
Daughter?

484
00:52:18,742 --> 00:52:21,336
Child!

485
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,094
Katharina!

486
00:52:49,902 --> 00:52:51,972
Katharina!

487
00:52:52,062 --> 00:52:53,700
Please!

488
00:52:56,062 --> 00:52:58,860
Child!

489
00:52:59,582 --> 00:53:01,618
Daughter!

490
00:56:10,502 --> 00:56:12,493
Petruchio is coming.

491
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:24,500
What will be said?

492
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:27,255
What mockery will it be
to lack the bridegroom

493
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:31,176
When the priest attends To speak
the ceremonial rites of marriage!

494
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:35,540
What says Lucentio
to this shame of ours?

495
00:56:35,622 --> 00:56:37,738
No shame but mine.

496
00:56:37,822 --> 00:56:40,461
Now must the world point at
poor Katharina, And say...

497
00:56:40,542 --> 00:56:45,332
Mad Petruchio's wife, If it would
please him come and marry her.

498
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:56,821
Petruchio is coming!
Petruchio is coming!

499
00:56:57,542 --> 00:57:01,535
Petruchio is coming!
Petruchio is coming!

500
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,936
In an old hat and an old jerkin;

501
00:57:08,022 --> 00:57:11,173
a pair of old breeches thrice turned;

502
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:14,937
with an old mothy saddle and
stirrups of different families.

503
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:30,897
How does my father?

504
00:58:30,982 --> 00:58:33,291
Good morrow, gentles.

505
00:58:33,382 --> 00:58:35,452
Gentles, methinks you frown.

506
00:58:36,302 --> 00:58:40,853
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
As if they saw some wondrous monument,

507
00:58:40,942 --> 00:58:43,581
Some comet, or unusual prodigy?

508
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:49,182
Fie, doff this habit, shame on your
estate, An eyesore to our solemn festival!

509
00:58:49,262 --> 00:58:51,776
What, will you be married
to my daughter thus?

510
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,171
Good sooth, even thus.
Therefore ha' done with words;

511
00:58:54,262 --> 00:58:57,254
To me she's married,
not unto my clothes.

512
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:01,502
But what a fool I am to chat with you,

513
00:59:01,582 --> 00:59:07,817
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
And seal the title with a lovely kiss.

514
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:55,540
Nay, by God's wounds.

515
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,253
Petruchio.

516
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:45,692
Petruchio!

517
01:01:49,582 --> 01:01:51,174
Petruchio,

518
01:01:51,262 --> 01:01:57,292
Wilt thou take Katharina To
be thy lawful wedded wife?

519
01:01:59,142 --> 01:02:01,133
I...

520
01:02:21,662 --> 01:02:23,334
Petruchio,

521
01:02:23,422 --> 01:02:29,452
Wilt thou take Katharina To
be thy lawful wedded wife?

522
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:36,376
The ring.

523
01:02:37,902 --> 01:02:39,938
The ring.

524
01:02:40,742 --> 01:02:42,972
The ring...

525
01:02:43,062 --> 01:02:45,053
The ring...

526
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:03,294
Petruchio, wilt thou take Katharina
To be thy lawful wedded wife?

527
01:03:03,382 --> 01:03:06,021
Marry I will!

528
01:03:14,662 --> 01:03:17,301
Katharina...

529
01:03:20,182 --> 01:03:21,740
Katharina,

530
01:03:21,822 --> 01:03:27,738
Wilt thou take Petruchio To
be thy lawful wedded husband?

531
01:03:49,062 --> 01:03:51,257
I will n...

532
01:04:10,102 --> 01:04:11,774
No!

533
01:04:11,862 --> 01:04:13,853
Father...

534
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:16,530
Fall to, good people.
Eat and drink your fill.

535
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:18,453
Please.

536
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:21,420
Gentlemen and friends, I
thank you for your pains.

537
01:05:21,862 --> 01:05:23,773
I know you think to dine with me today,

538
01:05:23,862 --> 01:05:26,251
And have prepar'd great
store of wedding cheer,

539
01:05:26,342 --> 01:05:31,700
But so it is, business doth call me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.

540
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:36,020
Is't possible you will away tonight?

541
01:05:36,102 --> 01:05:38,093
I must away today before night comes.

542
01:05:38,182 --> 01:05:42,380
Make it no wonder. If you knew my business,
You would entreat me rather go than stay.

543
01:05:42,462 --> 01:05:44,612
And honest company, I thank you all

544
01:05:44,702 --> 01:05:50,060
That have beheld me give myself away To
this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.

545
01:05:50,142 --> 01:05:55,216
Dine with my father, drink a health to me,
For I must hence, and farewell to you all.

546
01:05:55,302 --> 01:05:58,260
- Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
- It may not be.

547
01:05:58,342 --> 01:06:00,856
- Let me entreat you.
- It cannot be.

548
01:06:00,942 --> 01:06:03,820
Let me entreat you.

549
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:08,854
I am content.

550
01:06:08,942 --> 01:06:11,012
Are you content to stay?

551
01:06:11,102 --> 01:06:15,937
I am content you should entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.

552
01:06:16,022 --> 01:06:19,856
- Grumio, my horses.
- Ay, sir, they be ready.

553
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,657
Nay then, Do what thou
canst, I will not go today,

554
01:06:23,742 --> 01:06:26,131
No, nor tomorrow, till I please myself.

555
01:06:26,222 --> 01:06:31,296
The door is open, sir, there lies the way,
You may be jogging till your boots are green.

556
01:06:31,382 --> 01:06:34,340
For me, I'll not be gone
till I please myself.

557
01:06:34,422 --> 01:06:38,540
- Daughter, content ye, prithee be not angry.
- I will be angry; what hast thou to do?

558
01:06:38,622 --> 01:06:42,058
Father, be quiet; he
shall stay my leisure.

559
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:46,215
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.

560
01:06:47,222 --> 01:06:51,852
I see a woman may be made a fool
If she had not the spirit to resist.

561
01:06:54,622 --> 01:06:58,979
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend on her.

562
01:06:59,062 --> 01:07:03,453
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,

563
01:07:03,542 --> 01:07:06,693
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.

564
01:07:06,782 --> 01:07:10,058
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.

565
01:07:11,542 --> 01:07:17,731
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor
fret; I will be master of what is mine own.

566
01:07:18,022 --> 01:07:23,892
She is my goods, my chattels, she is my
house, My household stuff, my field, my barn,

567
01:07:23,982 --> 01:07:27,338
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,

568
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:29,936
And here she stands.
Touch her whoever dares!

569
01:07:30,022 --> 01:07:34,334
I'll bring mine action on the
proudest he That stops my way in Padua.

570
01:07:34,422 --> 01:07:38,495
Grumio, draw forth thy weapon,
we are beset with thieves,

571
01:07:38,582 --> 01:07:41,176
Rescue thy mistress
if thou be'est a man.

572
01:07:41,262 --> 01:07:43,776
Fear not, sweet wench, they
shall not touch thee, Kate.

573
01:07:43,862 --> 01:07:45,978
I'll buckler thee against a million.

574
01:07:48,342 --> 01:07:50,458
Father! Father!

575
01:07:50,542 --> 01:07:52,897
- Petruchio...
- Father!

576
01:07:52,982 --> 01:07:55,815
O, go hang yourselves!

577
01:07:55,902 --> 01:07:59,338
You foul, loathsome swine.

578
01:08:00,622 --> 01:08:02,852
A pox on thee.

579
01:08:05,662 --> 01:08:07,937
Come up. Hup! Hup! Hup!

580
01:08:09,222 --> 01:08:13,818
Had they not gone quickly, I
should have died with laughing.

581
01:08:13,902 --> 01:08:16,894
Of all mad matches never was the like.

582
01:08:18,142 --> 01:08:23,091
- Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
- That being mad herself, she's madly mated.

583
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:26,697
I warrant you, Petruchio is Kated.

584
01:08:30,702 --> 01:08:34,900
Come, Kate. Come, Kate.
Forward, Kate, forward.

585
01:08:37,582 --> 01:08:41,814
- You fool!
- Follow me, Kate, if thou be not too feeble.

586
01:08:52,742 --> 01:08:55,495
Come, Kate.

587
01:09:10,982 --> 01:09:15,658
.. wed to one half
lunatic, A madcap ruffian...

588
01:09:16,702 --> 01:09:18,693
Hey, master!

589
01:10:12,982 --> 01:10:16,213
- Hup, there.
- A pox on thee!

590
01:10:40,702 --> 01:10:42,055
Master!

591
01:10:42,142 --> 01:10:48,411
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse?

592
01:10:58,942 --> 01:11:01,695
Gregory? Philip?

593
01:11:01,782 --> 01:11:04,819
Nathaniel? Curtis?

594
01:11:06,622 --> 01:11:08,578
Gold.

595
01:11:14,302 --> 01:11:16,293
More. More.

596
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:39,852
Where is the life where is
the life That late I led?

597
01:12:03,222 --> 01:12:07,101
Where is the life that late
I led? It's gone it's gone

598
01:12:07,182 --> 01:12:09,218
It's gone it's gone it's gone

599
01:12:18,662 --> 01:12:20,653
It's gone

600
01:12:34,462 --> 01:12:36,896
Sit down, Kate, and welcome.

601
01:12:48,462 --> 01:12:50,692
You logger-headed
and unpolish'd grooms!

602
01:12:50,782 --> 01:12:53,615
What, no attendance? No regard? No duty?

603
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:57,456
You peasant swain! You
whoreson malt-horse drudge!

604
01:12:57,542 --> 01:12:59,612
Did not I bid thee ride ahead posthaste,

605
01:12:59,702 --> 01:13:02,296
And have all things made
proper for thy mistress?

606
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:05,294
Nathaniel's coat, sir,
was not ready made,

607
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:08,772
And Gregory's pumps were
all unpink'd I' th' heel;

608
01:13:08,862 --> 01:13:11,854
And Philip's dagger
was not fully sheath'd.

609
01:13:13,982 --> 01:13:18,260
Yet, as they are, here
are they come to serve you.

610
01:13:18,702 --> 01:13:22,217
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.

611
01:13:22,302 --> 01:13:25,100
Go, rascals, go.

612
01:13:25,182 --> 01:13:26,297
Go!

613
01:13:45,582 --> 01:13:48,301
Food!

614
01:13:49,302 --> 01:13:51,293
Food!

615
01:13:53,142 --> 01:13:54,780
Give me a chicken!

616
01:13:54,862 --> 01:13:56,853
Food!

617
01:13:59,462 --> 01:14:01,737
Food!

618
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:04,417
Food, food, food!

619
01:14:11,902 --> 01:14:14,621
Food!

620
01:14:23,342 --> 01:14:26,095
Where be these knaves?

621
01:14:28,742 --> 01:14:30,733
All things is ready.

622
01:15:09,182 --> 01:15:12,731
Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.

623
01:15:32,662 --> 01:15:35,813
Be merry, Kate.

624
01:15:37,902 --> 01:15:40,735
Some water here. What ho! Water.

625
01:15:41,342 --> 01:15:43,139
Water!

626
01:15:43,222 --> 01:15:45,736
Shall I have some water?

627
01:15:46,782 --> 01:15:49,342
- Water.
- Water.

628
01:15:54,062 --> 01:15:56,860
Patience, I pray you,
'twas a fault unwilling.

629
01:15:56,942 --> 01:16:00,617
A whoreson beetle-headed,
flap-ear'd knave!

630
01:16:09,382 --> 01:16:12,613
Come, Kate, sit down, I
know you have a stomach.

631
01:16:14,582 --> 01:16:17,938
Shall you give thanks,
good Kate, or else shall I?

632
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:35,299
- Amen.
- Amen.

633
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,656
Amen.

634
01:16:49,422 --> 01:16:51,413
Amen.

635
01:16:59,702 --> 01:17:02,739
- Amen.
- Amen!

636
01:17:06,102 --> 01:17:09,060
What's this? Chicken?

637
01:17:09,142 --> 01:17:10,257
Ay.

638
01:17:10,342 --> 01:17:14,221
- Who brought it?
- I.

639
01:17:15,822 --> 01:17:19,212
I? I?

640
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:22,214
'Tis burnt, and so is all the meat.

641
01:17:22,302 --> 01:17:24,657
What dogs are these!
Where is the rascal cook?

642
01:17:24,742 --> 01:17:27,336
How durst thou, villains,
bring it from the dresser

643
01:17:27,422 --> 01:17:29,413
And serve it thus to
me who loves it not?

644
01:17:29,502 --> 01:17:32,733
Here, take it to you,
trenchers, cups, and all.

645
01:17:35,342 --> 01:17:37,537
I pray you, husband,

646
01:17:37,622 --> 01:17:39,613
be not so disquiet.

647
01:17:40,182 --> 01:17:42,650
The meat was well,

648
01:17:43,222 --> 01:17:47,215
if you had... been so... contented.

649
01:17:48,422 --> 01:17:53,576
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried
away, And I expressly am forbid to touch it,

650
01:17:53,662 --> 01:17:56,574
For it engenders anger, planteth choler;

651
01:17:56,662 --> 01:18:03,295
And better 'twere that both of us did fast
Than feed it with such over-roasted... flesh.

652
01:18:03,382 --> 01:18:08,581
Be patient, tomorrow it shall be mended,
And for this night we'll fast for company.

653
01:18:08,662 --> 01:18:12,291
Come, I will bring thee
to thy bridal chamber.

654
01:18:13,142 --> 01:18:15,019
Grumio!

655
01:18:18,262 --> 01:18:21,652
Where is the life that late he led?

656
01:18:22,062 --> 01:18:24,337
It's gone it's gone

657
01:18:25,342 --> 01:18:27,219
It's gone it's gone it's gone away

658
01:20:26,982 --> 01:20:28,973
No!

659
01:21:06,142 --> 01:21:08,895
Fools! In what fashion
have you made her bed?

660
01:21:08,982 --> 01:21:15,455
With here a pillow flung and there a bolster,
This way the coverlet, and that the sheets.

661
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:21,219
How, in this hurly-burly, may a groom
Renderly woo and win his loving bride?

662
01:21:21,302 --> 01:21:25,693
Gregory! Curtis! Philip!
Nathaniel! Grumio!

663
01:21:27,342 --> 01:21:30,300
I spit on you, that you
should treat her thus.

664
01:21:38,302 --> 01:21:41,294
This is the way to kill
a wife with kindness.

665
01:23:04,302 --> 01:23:05,496
Lower.

666
01:23:06,062 --> 01:23:07,859
Lower.

667
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,733
Lower.

668
01:23:35,942 --> 01:23:38,376
Good morrow, Kate.

669
01:23:49,862 --> 01:23:52,695
What, sweeting, all forlorn?

670
01:23:56,302 --> 01:23:59,100
How fares my Kate?

671
01:24:01,062 --> 01:24:02,461
III.

672
01:24:18,822 --> 01:24:21,290
'Tis passing fair.

673
01:24:23,222 --> 01:24:24,974
Nay, nay.

674
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:36,855
Master. Master!

675
01:24:37,102 --> 01:24:39,821
Master, I have watch'd so
long That I am dog-weary,

676
01:24:39,902 --> 01:24:43,815
But at last I spied A man most
suitable to play your father.

677
01:24:43,902 --> 01:24:46,939
An ancient angel coming down the hill.

678
01:24:48,142 --> 01:24:50,372
Whom Tranio doth follow and approach.

679
01:24:54,782 --> 01:24:57,455
- God save you, sir.
- And you, sir. You are welcome.

680
01:24:57,542 --> 01:25:01,057
- What countryman, I pray?
- Of Mantua, sir.

681
01:25:01,142 --> 01:25:03,133
Mantua?

682
01:25:03,862 --> 01:25:08,777
From Mantua? Marry, God forbid! And
come to Padua, careless of your life?

683
01:25:08,862 --> 01:25:12,172
My life, sir? How, I
pray? For that goes hard.

684
01:25:12,262 --> 01:25:15,572
'Tis death for any one in
Mantua To come to Padua.

685
01:25:16,822 --> 01:25:20,212
Nay, know you not the cause?

686
01:25:20,302 --> 01:25:25,422
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the Duke,
For private quarrel 'twixt your Duke and him,

687
01:25:25,502 --> 01:25:27,970
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly.

688
01:25:28,062 --> 01:25:31,134
Alas, sir, what would you advise me do?

689
01:25:31,622 --> 01:25:34,614
This will I do, and this
I will advise you do:

690
01:25:34,702 --> 01:25:39,935
To save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for your sake,

691
01:25:40,022 --> 01:25:45,733
And think it not the worst of all your
fortunes That you are like to Lord Vincentio.

692
01:25:48,062 --> 01:25:50,530
Your plainness and your
shortness please me well.

693
01:25:50,622 --> 01:25:56,379
Right true it is your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him.

694
01:25:56,782 --> 01:25:59,774
Now therefore if you
give me this assurance

695
01:25:59,862 --> 01:26:05,300
That like a father you will deal with him,
And pass my daughter a sufficient dowry,

696
01:26:05,382 --> 01:26:07,976
And covenants be signed,

697
01:26:10,902 --> 01:26:17,137
At thy son's lodging - for walls
have ears and I have many servants -

698
01:26:17,222 --> 01:26:19,895
Why, then, he has consent to wed Bianca.

699
01:26:19,982 --> 01:26:21,540
Signor Baptista.

700
01:26:21,622 --> 01:26:26,776
The match is made, the ceremony appointed
For Sunday next; and I will give a feast

701
01:26:26,862 --> 01:26:31,890
Which, with the citizens of Padua here,
Petruchio and Katharine shall attend.

702
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:42,773
Mistress... what cheer?

703
01:27:42,862 --> 01:27:46,172
Faith, as cold as can be.

704
01:28:00,862 --> 01:28:03,979
Pluck up your spirits,
look cheerfully upon me.

705
01:28:04,062 --> 01:28:06,576
Your father bids us to Bianca's wedding,

706
01:28:07,062 --> 01:28:11,214
And thither must we
journey, bravely clad.

707
01:28:16,902 --> 01:28:22,852
Tailor and haberdasher wait thy leisure To
deck thy body with their ruffling treasure.

708
01:28:35,942 --> 01:28:38,536
Come, tailor, let us
see these ornaments.

709
01:28:40,742 --> 01:28:44,098
What's the news with you... sir?

710
01:28:44,182 --> 01:28:47,492
- Here is...
- Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.

711
01:28:47,582 --> 01:28:52,133
- Why, this was moulded on a porringer!
- O, I like the cap.

712
01:28:52,222 --> 01:28:54,452
A velvet dish! Fie, fie! 'Ris lewd.

713
01:28:55,022 --> 01:28:56,296
- Lewd?
- Lewd?

714
01:28:56,382 --> 01:28:58,373
And filthy.

715
01:28:58,462 --> 01:29:02,660
Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.

716
01:29:02,742 --> 01:29:05,256
Away with it! Come, let me see a bigger.

717
01:29:05,342 --> 01:29:11,815
I'll have no bigger. This doth fit the time,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.

718
01:29:16,622 --> 01:29:21,412
When you are gentler, you shall
have one too, And not before.

719
01:29:21,502 --> 01:29:23,538
Why, sir,

720
01:29:23,622 --> 01:29:27,820
I trust I may have leave
to speak, And speak I will.

721
01:29:27,902 --> 01:29:30,370
I am no child, no babe.

722
01:29:30,462 --> 01:29:33,932
Your betters have
endur'd me speak my mind,

723
01:29:34,022 --> 01:29:37,617
And if you cannot,
best you stop your ears.

724
01:29:37,702 --> 01:29:42,537
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my heart concealing it will break.

725
01:29:42,622 --> 01:29:44,692
I love thee well in
that thou lik'st it not.

726
01:29:44,942 --> 01:29:50,414
Love me or love me not, I like the cap,
And it I will have, or I will have none.

727
01:30:01,142 --> 01:30:04,737
The gown. Come, tailor, let us see't.

728
01:30:18,622 --> 01:30:21,420
O mercy, God! What
mummer's stuff is here?

729
01:30:21,502 --> 01:30:25,973
What's this? A sleeve? 'Ris like a demi-cannon.
What, up and down, carv'd like an apple tart?

730
01:30:26,062 --> 01:30:28,701
Why, what the devil's name,
tailor, call'st thou this?

731
01:30:28,782 --> 01:30:31,933
You bid me make it orderly and well,
According to the fashion and the time.

732
01:30:32,022 --> 01:30:36,459
O monstrous arrogance! Thou
liest, thou thread, thou thimble,

733
01:30:36,542 --> 01:30:39,181
Thou yard, three-quarters, thou liest.

734
01:30:39,262 --> 01:30:43,619
Thou half-yard, quarter, inch, Thou
flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!

735
01:30:43,702 --> 01:30:46,853
Away, thou rag, thou
quantity, thou remnant,

736
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:51,333
Or I shall so bemete thee with thy yard As
thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st.

737
01:31:11,582 --> 01:31:15,780
Well, come, my Kate, we
must unto your father's

738
01:31:15,862 --> 01:31:18,695
Even in these honest mean habiliments.

739
01:31:18,782 --> 01:31:24,573
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor,
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich,

740
01:31:24,662 --> 01:31:27,176
And as the sun breaks
through the darkest clouds,

741
01:31:27,262 --> 01:31:29,935
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.

742
01:31:30,022 --> 01:31:34,413
What, is the jay more precious than the
lark Because his feathers are more beautiful?

743
01:31:34,502 --> 01:31:39,735
Or is the adder better than the eel
Because his painted skin contents the eye?

744
01:31:39,822 --> 01:31:45,772
O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
For this poor furniture and mean array.

745
01:31:45,862 --> 01:31:48,854
If thou account'st it
shame, blame it on me.

746
01:31:50,622 --> 01:31:52,817
Grumio!

747
01:31:52,902 --> 01:31:54,938
Say thou wilt see the tailor paid.

748
01:32:06,942 --> 01:32:09,661
And therefore... frolic.

749
01:33:41,062 --> 01:33:43,292
And now, my honey love,

750
01:33:44,302 --> 01:33:49,217
We will return unto your father's house,
And revel it as bravely as the best,

751
01:33:50,222 --> 01:33:57,298
With silken coats and caps, and golden rings,
And ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things,

752
01:33:57,382 --> 01:34:01,500
With amber bracelets,
beads, and scarfs and fans.

753
01:34:01,582 --> 01:34:04,574
- When shall we leave?
- Why, now.

754
01:34:06,702 --> 01:34:09,580
- What is't o'clock?
- 'Tis day.

755
01:34:10,582 --> 01:34:12,937
- 'Tis night.
- 'Tis seven.

756
01:34:13,942 --> 01:34:15,773
'Tis two at most.

757
01:34:15,862 --> 01:34:18,854
It shall be seven or I will not ride.

758
01:34:19,982 --> 01:34:24,612
Look what I speak, or do, or think
to do, You are still crossing of it.

759
01:34:26,582 --> 01:34:27,810
Nay...

760
01:34:27,902 --> 01:34:33,135
Let it alone, I will not go today, or ere
I do, It shall be what o'clock I say it is.

761
01:34:33,902 --> 01:34:36,052
'Tis seven.

762
01:35:18,702 --> 01:35:22,934
Come on, a God's name, once
more unto your father's.

763
01:35:23,022 --> 01:35:25,934
Good Lord, how bright and
goodly shines the moon!

764
01:35:29,222 --> 01:35:31,497
I say it is the moon.

765
01:35:33,782 --> 01:35:36,501
I know it is the moon.

766
01:35:37,382 --> 01:35:40,579
Why, then you lie.
It is the blessed sun.

767
01:35:40,662 --> 01:35:43,335
Then, God be blest,
it is the blessed sun.

768
01:35:44,222 --> 01:35:49,296
But sun it is not, when you say it is not,
And the moon changes even as your mind.

769
01:35:49,742 --> 01:35:56,978
What you will have it nam'd, even that it
is, And so it shall be so for Katharine.

770
01:35:59,902 --> 01:36:01,893
Forward, forward.

771
01:36:06,862 --> 01:36:10,059
But soft, what company is coming here?

772
01:36:11,382 --> 01:36:14,499
Good morrow, gentle
mistress, where away?

773
01:36:17,742 --> 01:36:22,770
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly
too, Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?

774
01:36:22,862 --> 01:36:26,252
Such war of white and
red within her cheeks!

775
01:36:26,342 --> 01:36:29,061
What stars do spangle
heaven with such beauty

776
01:36:29,142 --> 01:36:32,691
As those two eyes become
that... heavenly face?

777
01:36:36,062 --> 01:36:38,622
Fair... lovely maid,

778
01:36:39,622 --> 01:36:42,375
once more good day to thee.

779
01:36:45,742 --> 01:36:49,496
Sweet Kate, embrace her
for her beauty's sake.

780
01:36:58,422 --> 01:37:00,617
Young budding virgin,

781
01:37:00,702 --> 01:37:03,341
fair, and fresh, and sweet,

782
01:37:03,422 --> 01:37:06,380
Whither away, or where is thy abode?

783
01:37:07,942 --> 01:37:10,934
Happy the parents of so fair a child,

784
01:37:11,022 --> 01:37:16,938
Happier the man whom favourable stars
Will allot for his lovely bedfellow.

785
01:37:20,142 --> 01:37:22,258
Why, how now, Kate, I
hope thou art not mad.

786
01:37:22,342 --> 01:37:26,813
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.

787
01:37:26,902 --> 01:37:30,656
O pardon, old father,
for my mistaking eyes,

788
01:37:30,742 --> 01:37:33,973
That have been so
bedazzled by the... sun

789
01:37:34,822 --> 01:37:38,098
That everything I see
is green and young.

790
01:37:38,182 --> 01:37:41,333
Now I perceive thou
art a reverend father.

791
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:44,653
Pardon, I pray thee,
for my mad mistaking.

792
01:37:46,222 --> 01:37:49,771
Pardon her, grandsire, and withal
make known Which way thou travellest:

793
01:37:49,862 --> 01:37:53,138
If along with us, We shall
be joyful of thy company.

794
01:37:53,222 --> 01:37:56,020
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,

795
01:37:56,102 --> 01:37:58,662
That with your strange
encounter much amaz'd me,

796
01:37:59,102 --> 01:38:01,297
My name is call'd Vincentio,

797
01:38:02,302 --> 01:38:04,816
my dwelling Pisa.

798
01:38:06,302 --> 01:38:09,021
Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,

799
01:38:09,102 --> 01:38:14,130
And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
A son of mine, who long I have not seen.

800
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:19,012
He studies at the university
- His name is called Lucentio!

801
01:38:20,462 --> 01:38:22,453
- Master.
- Biondello...

802
01:38:22,542 --> 01:38:24,134
Shh.

803
01:38:24,222 --> 01:38:26,213
Softly and swiftly, sir,

804
01:38:26,302 --> 01:38:30,056
For even now the priest is marrying
Hortensio To the lusty widow of his choice,

805
01:38:30,142 --> 01:38:35,978
And, once the church is emptied, hath agreed
To marry you in secret to your mistress.

806
01:38:45,782 --> 01:38:48,216
We fly, Biondello.

807
01:39:00,382 --> 01:39:03,852
Tell me, kind sir, is this
the house of one Lucentio?

808
01:39:03,942 --> 01:39:08,379
Ay, but they are busy
within arguing over dowries.

809
01:39:08,462 --> 01:39:11,056
You'd best knock louder.

810
01:39:15,662 --> 01:39:19,052
Who's he that knocks as he
would beat down the door?

811
01:39:21,782 --> 01:39:24,012
Is Signor Lucentio within, sir?

812
01:39:24,102 --> 01:39:28,015
He's within, sir, but not
to be spoken to withal.

813
01:39:28,102 --> 01:39:33,893
I pray you tell Signor Lucentio that his
father is here at the door to speak with him.

814
01:39:36,822 --> 01:39:39,097
Thou liest.

815
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:42,618
His father is here
looking out at the window.

816
01:39:43,622 --> 01:39:47,456
- Thou? His father?
- Ay, sir, so his mother says,

817
01:39:47,542 --> 01:39:49,578
if I may believe her.

818
01:39:50,342 --> 01:39:52,412
Why, how now, old gentleman!

819
01:39:52,502 --> 01:39:56,017
This is flat knavery, to take
upon yourself another man's name.

820
01:39:56,302 --> 01:39:57,974
Lay hands on the villain.

821
01:39:58,062 --> 01:40:02,658
I believe he means to cheat somebody
in this city under my countenance.

822
01:40:03,422 --> 01:40:05,617
Biondello. Biondello!

823
01:40:05,702 --> 01:40:07,454
Help!

824
01:40:09,062 --> 01:40:11,292
Come hither, crack-hemp.

825
01:40:11,382 --> 01:40:14,294
My master's father, Lord Vincentio.

826
01:40:14,382 --> 01:40:16,577
Come hither, you rogue.

827
01:40:16,662 --> 01:40:19,415
What, have you forgot me?

828
01:40:19,502 --> 01:40:21,697
Forgot you, sir? No, sir. No, sir.

829
01:40:21,782 --> 01:40:25,457
I could not forget you, sir, for...
I never saw you before in all my life.

830
01:40:25,542 --> 01:40:30,377
What, you notorious villain, didst
thou never see thy master's father?

831
01:40:30,622 --> 01:40:32,180
Help! Son!

832
01:40:32,582 --> 01:40:35,380
Sir, what are you that
offer to beat my servant?

833
01:40:35,462 --> 01:40:37,737
What am I, sir? Nay, what are you, sir?

834
01:40:40,622 --> 01:40:44,501
O immortal gods! O fine villain!

835
01:40:44,582 --> 01:40:50,452
What, a silken doublet, a velvet hose,
a scarlet cloak, and a sugar-loaf hat!

836
01:40:50,822 --> 01:40:53,859
O... O, I am undone. O...

837
01:40:54,302 --> 01:40:56,497
O, I am undone.

838
01:40:56,902 --> 01:41:01,612
I am undone! My son and my servant
spend all at the university.

839
01:41:02,022 --> 01:41:04,582
What, is the man lunatic?

840
01:41:04,782 --> 01:41:10,095
Why, sir, what concerns it you if
I wear pearl and... and... and gold?

841
01:41:10,182 --> 01:41:13,538
I thank my good father,
I am able to maintain it.

842
01:41:13,622 --> 01:41:15,613
Thy father?

843
01:41:15,702 --> 01:41:18,455
His father's a sail-maker in Bergamo.

844
01:41:19,462 --> 01:41:23,091
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir.
Pray, what do you think is his name?

845
01:41:23,182 --> 01:41:25,980
His name? As if I knew not his name!

846
01:41:26,062 --> 01:41:30,772
I've brought him up ever since he was
three years old, and his name is Tranio.

847
01:41:32,502 --> 01:41:34,493
Tranio?

848
01:41:38,542 --> 01:41:41,534
Away, away, mad ass!

849
01:41:41,622 --> 01:41:48,095
His name is Lucentio, and he is mine
only son, and heir to the lands of me.

850
01:41:49,622 --> 01:41:51,613
Lucent...

851
01:41:52,902 --> 01:41:56,212
Villain. O villain!

852
01:41:56,302 --> 01:41:58,293
Villain! Villain!

853
01:41:58,382 --> 01:42:00,452
My servant hath murdered my son!

854
01:42:00,542 --> 01:42:02,976
Lay hold on him, I charge
you, in the Duke's name.

855
01:42:03,062 --> 01:42:05,053
O, my son, my son!

856
01:42:05,142 --> 01:42:08,452
Tell me, thou villain,
where is my son Lucentio?

857
01:42:08,542 --> 01:42:10,897
Call forth an officer.

858
01:42:19,742 --> 01:42:23,735
Deny him, forswear him, sir,
or else we are all undone.

859
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:27,292
How dare you lay hands on me!

860
01:42:27,382 --> 01:42:32,536
You will see, I shall protest the Duke.
He will punish home this cave of cozenage.

861
01:42:34,782 --> 01:42:37,376
Pardon, sweet father.

862
01:42:39,742 --> 01:42:42,415
Lives my sweet son.

863
01:42:48,422 --> 01:42:50,936
Pardon, sweet father.

864
01:43:31,742 --> 01:43:34,495
Husband, let's into my father's house.

865
01:43:34,582 --> 01:43:37,813
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.

866
01:43:37,902 --> 01:43:40,462
What, in the midst of the street?

867
01:43:40,542 --> 01:43:42,737
What, art ashamed of me?

868
01:43:42,822 --> 01:43:44,938
No, sir, God forbid;

869
01:43:45,022 --> 01:43:48,219
but... ashamed to kiss.

870
01:43:49,142 --> 01:43:53,420
- Why, then, let's home again.
- Nay, I will give thee a kiss.

871
01:43:54,222 --> 01:43:57,180
Now pray thee, love, stay.

872
01:44:55,582 --> 01:44:58,335
Grumio, my wine.

873
01:46:52,142 --> 01:46:55,657
Nothing but sit and
sit, and eat and eat!

874
01:46:55,742 --> 01:46:59,291
Padua affords this
kindness, son Petruchio.

875
01:46:59,382 --> 01:47:02,055
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.

876
01:47:03,062 --> 01:47:05,530
For both our sakes I
would that word were true.

877
01:47:05,622 --> 01:47:08,659
I' faith, Hortensio feels
the fear of his widow.

878
01:47:09,222 --> 01:47:13,135
- I am not afeard.
- I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.

879
01:47:14,302 --> 01:47:20,218
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my husband's trouble by his own.

880
01:47:20,622 --> 01:47:23,375
And now you know my meaning.

881
01:47:24,422 --> 01:47:28,461
- A very mean meaning.
- Right, I mean you.

882
01:47:28,542 --> 01:47:31,261
- To her, Kate!
- To her, widow!

883
01:47:31,342 --> 01:47:34,778
- A hundred crowns, my Kate will lay her flat.
- That's my office.

884
01:47:45,582 --> 01:47:50,098
By your leave, my lords,
the ladies would withdraw.

885
01:47:51,142 --> 01:47:53,133
Bianca.

886
01:48:14,822 --> 01:48:19,213
Marry, Petruchio, I begin to wonder If
thou hast wed the veriest shrew of all.

887
01:48:20,262 --> 01:48:24,653
I say no. And therefore for assurance
Let's each one send unto his wife,

888
01:48:24,742 --> 01:48:29,293
And he whose wife is most obedient, To
come the moment he doth send for her,

889
01:48:29,382 --> 01:48:31,942
Shall win the wager
which we will propose.

890
01:48:32,262 --> 01:48:34,537
Content.

891
01:48:34,622 --> 01:48:36,897
- What was the wager?
- Two hundred crowns.

892
01:48:36,982 --> 01:48:38,495
Two hundred crowns?

893
01:48:38,582 --> 01:48:44,100
I'll venture so much on my hawk and hound,
But twenty times so much upon my wife.

894
01:48:45,342 --> 01:48:48,220
So be it, then. Four thousand crowns.

895
01:48:53,822 --> 01:48:55,699
Content?

896
01:48:58,022 --> 01:48:59,011
Content.

897
01:49:06,742 --> 01:49:10,052
- Who shall begin?
- That will I. Biondello?

898
01:49:11,622 --> 01:49:14,819
Go, Biondello, bid your
mistress come to me.

899
01:49:18,302 --> 01:49:21,612
I will share half your
stake Bianca comes.

900
01:49:21,702 --> 01:49:25,172
I'll have no halves.
I'll bear it all myself.

901
01:49:33,742 --> 01:49:35,858
How now, what news?

902
01:49:35,942 --> 01:49:40,493
Sir, my mistress sends you word
That she is busy and she cannot come.

903
01:49:46,822 --> 01:49:50,178
How? She is busy, and she
cannot come? Is that an answer?

904
01:49:50,262 --> 01:49:52,571
Ay, and a kind one too.

905
01:49:52,662 --> 01:49:58,020
- Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
- I hope for better.

906
01:50:00,542 --> 01:50:01,736
Sirrah.

907
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:03,980
Sirrah.

908
01:50:04,302 --> 01:50:10,298
Biondello, go and entreat my
wife To come to me... forthwith.

909
01:50:10,382 --> 01:50:13,260
O ho, entreat her! Nay,
then she needs must come.

910
01:50:13,342 --> 01:50:17,972
I am afraid, sir, Do what you
can, yours will not be entreated.

911
01:50:32,982 --> 01:50:36,292
- Where is my wife?
- She will not come.

912
01:50:36,382 --> 01:50:38,976
She bids you come to her.

913
01:50:44,462 --> 01:50:49,855
Worse and worse, she will not come! O
vile, Intolerable, not to be endur'd!

914
01:50:52,502 --> 01:50:57,496
Grumio, go to thy mistress,
Say I command her to come to me.

915
01:51:23,142 --> 01:51:25,133
- I know her answer.
- What?

916
01:51:25,222 --> 01:51:27,816
She will not come.

917
01:51:52,222 --> 01:51:54,213
See where she comes.

918
01:51:54,302 --> 01:51:58,215
- O, come, come, you're mocking.
- Nay, nay, I will not.

919
01:51:59,222 --> 01:52:00,701
Fie, fie!

920
01:52:00,782 --> 01:52:03,899
Unknit that threatening unkind brow,

921
01:52:03,982 --> 01:52:06,940
And dart not scornful
glances from those eyes,

922
01:52:07,022 --> 01:52:10,173
To wound thy lord,
thy king, thy governor.

923
01:52:10,262 --> 01:52:14,699
It blots thy beauty as
frosts do bite the meads.

924
01:52:15,662 --> 01:52:21,020
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life,
thy keeper, Thy head, thy sovereign;

925
01:52:21,102 --> 01:52:23,297
one that cares for thee,

926
01:52:23,382 --> 01:52:28,820
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land,

927
01:52:29,262 --> 01:52:32,857
To watch the night in
storms, the day in cold,

928
01:52:32,942 --> 01:52:37,458
While thou liest warm
at home, secure and safe;

929
01:52:37,902 --> 01:52:44,660
He craves no other tribute at
thy hands But love, fair looks,

930
01:52:45,942 --> 01:52:47,978
and true obedience;

931
01:52:50,022 --> 01:52:54,095
Too little payment...
for so great a debt.

932
01:52:57,382 --> 01:53:00,613
Such duty the subject owes the prince

933
01:53:02,662 --> 01:53:05,859
Even such a woman oweth to her husband.

934
01:53:14,862 --> 01:53:20,414
And when she is froward,
peevish, sullen, sour,

935
01:53:20,502 --> 01:53:23,221
And not obedient to his honest will,

936
01:53:23,302 --> 01:53:26,738
What is she but a foul contending rebel,

937
01:53:26,822 --> 01:53:30,258
And graceless traitor
to her loving lord?

938
01:53:30,342 --> 01:53:37,259
I am asham'd that women are so simple To
offer war when they should kneel for peace,

939
01:53:37,342 --> 01:53:40,618
Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,

940
01:53:40,702 --> 01:53:44,980
When they are bound to
serve, love, and obey.

941
01:53:46,662 --> 01:53:48,141
Why...

942
01:53:48,222 --> 01:53:53,296
are our bodies soft,
and weak, and smooth,

943
01:53:53,382 --> 01:53:55,976
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,

944
01:53:56,062 --> 01:54:01,932
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts?

945
01:54:04,102 --> 01:54:07,014
Come, you froward and unable worms.

946
01:54:08,022 --> 01:54:09,375
Come.

947
01:54:09,462 --> 01:54:11,817
My mind hath been as
big as one of yours,

948
01:54:11,902 --> 01:54:17,420
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown.

949
01:54:17,502 --> 01:54:20,494
But now I see our lances are but straws.

950
01:54:21,302 --> 01:54:25,056
Come, place your hands
below your husband's foot.

951
01:54:25,142 --> 01:54:28,054
In token of which duty, if he please,

952
01:54:31,302 --> 01:54:33,862
My hand is ready,

953
01:54:35,542 --> 01:54:37,214
may it do him ease.

954
01:54:44,062 --> 01:54:46,530
Why, there's a wench!

955
01:54:51,942 --> 01:54:54,581
Come on, and kiss me, Kate.

956
01:55:11,742 --> 01:55:18,978
I won the battle, you have yet to fight, And
being a winner, God give you... goodnight!
