1
00:00:01,886 --> 00:00:03,253
<i>Tonight on the Marriage Ref...</i>

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:05,054
Martin short.

3
00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:06,456
Hey!

4
00:00:06,523 --> 00:00:08,424
You've got to be sensitive
to your wife's needs.

5
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:09,625
And in my case,

6
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:11,327
Make sure your personal
assistant fulfills them,

7
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:12,395
But that's me.

8
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:13,896
Sarah Silverman.

9
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:15,498
When you're in love,

10
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:18,067
You have to support
each other's passions,

11
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:21,971
<i>And she should support
his love of lord of the rings.</i>

12
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,607
He should support
her love of diet pills

13
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:26,748
Or whatever her hobby is.

14
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:28,704
And Matthew Broderick.

15
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:31,365
Something about this whole thing
is wrong.

16
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:34,628
One's fizzy, one's dizzy, one's busy,

17
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:37,781
And they all get mixed together tonight.

18
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:38,849
You bastard.

19
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,951
It's not a competition.

20
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:42,252
You're a sex maniac.

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,187
This has gotta stop.

22
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:45,489
He's not a boyfriend!

23
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:47,524
He's a friend that's a boy.

24
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:49,326
You look incredibly sexy
right now.

25
00:00:49,393 --> 00:00:50,527
Thank you.

26
00:00:50,595 --> 00:00:52,128
Plus a surprise,
one of the stars

27
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:53,230
Of late night
comedy controversy.

28
00:00:58,035 --> 00:01:01,404
Now here's the marriage ref,
Tom Papa.

29
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,226
Welcome to The Marriage Ref,
I'm Tom Papa.

30
00:01:10,346 --> 00:01:12,172
Tonight we're gonna watch real couples

31
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:14,045
with real-life arguments,

32
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:15,680
And we're gonna give them
the one thing

33
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:16,948
They've always wanted--

34
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:18,182
A winner.

35
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,151
So the way we do this
is we watch each couple,

36
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:21,986
I discuss the issue
with the panel,

37
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:23,287
They try and sway me

38
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:24,856
In favor of the husband
or the wife,

39
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:26,090
And then I make the call.

40
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:27,792
All right, first up,

41
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,827
Let's traverse
the thrilling nautical skyway

42
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:31,829
Of the Chesapeake Bay
bridge-tunnel

43
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:34,499
On our way
to Colonial Abingdon, Maryland,

44
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,000
Where we meet the Arringtons,

45
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:37,902
Who are trying to sort out a...

46
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,637
Scheduling conflict.

47
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:42,006
When I first met my wife, tee,

48
00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:43,908
I was just really kind of
captivated by her eyes,

49
00:01:43,976 --> 00:01:46,644
And then I wound up
asking her for a phone number.

50
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:47,879
It's like, I just knew,

51
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:50,148
I was like,
"that's gonna be my man."

52
00:01:57,322 --> 00:01:58,389
It's like you got energy

53
00:01:58,457 --> 00:02:00,825
For everything else
that's going on,

54
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:02,527
But you don't have
any energy for me.

55
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:04,128
You a sex maniac.

56
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:07,265
I could be dead asleep.

57
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:09,600
"wake up. Mmm!

58
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:11,869
Got something for you."

59
00:02:11,937 --> 00:02:15,073
I'm trying to get ready
to get out of the house,

60
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,407
And you talkin' about
you got something for me.

61
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:18,776
Babe, if I don't
take those opportunities,

62
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:19,944
It's not happening.

63
00:02:20,012 --> 00:02:22,346
I could be sick...

64
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:24,415
I mean, sick.
No.

65
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:25,616
What is it like?

66
00:02:25,684 --> 00:02:26,884
Like you're retired
to, like, the barn,

67
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:29,787
You don't come out
running with us anymore?

68
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:31,823
What is it?

69
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,558
It's like, why even try?

70
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,626
So I go down there
and play video games

71
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:36,894
<i>And play call of duty,</i>

72
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:39,630
<i>Because I'm not playing
call of Booty.</i>

73
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:41,933
All I'm looking for
is some consistency.

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,501
But it seems
like consistency--

75
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,536
- I was consistent
with once a week.

76
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:47,138
That's four time a month!

77
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:49,040
Come on!

78
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:51,476
The bible, it says that,

79
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:54,245
<i>"woman love your husband."
love.</i>

80
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:55,746
It didn't say "have sex
with your husband

81
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:58,749
All the time, three, four,
five times a week."

82
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:00,384
When was the last time

83
00:03:00,452 --> 00:03:02,053
You bought me
a purse or something?

84
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:03,654
That was when
we were in Atlantic city.

85
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:05,556
But you got sex [indistinct].

86
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:06,858
- Yeah!
- Okay.

87
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:08,759
So in other words,
we have to equate

88
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:10,328
Me buying you stuff with sex?

89
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:13,297
- Shopping--if you're bringing
me gifts or something I enjoy,

90
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:14,565
Sex is what you enjoy.

91
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,200
Step up to the plate
a couple of more times,

92
00:03:16,268 --> 00:03:17,668
And, you know...

93
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:19,303
I think I step up to the plate.

94
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:21,706
Babe, if you was in baseball,

95
00:03:21,773 --> 00:03:23,975
They would have you
in the minors.

96
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:29,680
Wow!

97
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:31,682
Okay, the Arringtons.

98
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,117
The issue here is...

99
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:35,419
Well, I think we all know
what the issue is.

100
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:37,622
Some people want things,

101
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,323
Some people have things,

102
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:41,259
Some people want things
that other people have,

103
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:44,295
And some people
just want you to get that thing

104
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:46,230
Away from them.

105
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:49,000
I think it's very dangerous,

106
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:51,102
Because you've got to make sure

107
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,704
That the bedroom
activities, um,

108
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:55,339
Are an important part
of the marriage,

109
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:57,441
And they've gotta get
that equation going.

110
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,044
I don't know
why I did that, but...

111
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:01,379
- It's the testicles.
- Yeah.

112
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:03,447
'cause that's what it is.

113
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:05,016
But they gotta figure that out.

114
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,718
One time a week
does not seem enough.

115
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:09,020
And, um...

116
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:11,622
I don't think it's enough.
Right.

117
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,524
Thoughts, Sarah?
I don't know, Tom.

118
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:14,859
It's a real quandary.

119
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:16,327
Yeah.

120
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:20,565
That hooked on phonics really
worked for you, didn't it?

121
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,433
I think that sex is important.

122
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:25,870
If she's not feeling sexual...

123
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:28,105
Right.

124
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:39,350
There are other ways...

125
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:46,824
There are other ways...

126
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:50,228
She can help him in other ways,

127
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:51,696
Even if she isn't--

128
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:54,031
- You're losin' me.
What do you mean?

129
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:58,402
Like, okay, give me an example.

130
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:02,607
She could give him a hand.

131
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:07,144
Wow!

132
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:10,481
Very elegant.

133
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:13,251
She mentions
the bible at one point.

134
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:16,554
Uh, Natalie, what does
the bible say

135
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:17,755
About marital relations?

136
00:05:17,823 --> 00:05:19,657
Oh, lord.

137
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:22,593
The bible says...

138
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:25,296
"this at last
is bone of my bone

139
00:05:25,364 --> 00:05:27,098
"and flesh of my flesh.

140
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:29,133
"she shall be called 'woman, '

141
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:31,502
"and the man and his wife
were both naked

142
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,204
And were not ashamed."

143
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:35,239
No wonder they keep one
in every hotel room.

144
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:41,579
Okay.

145
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:43,814
There are some tools here
that Therman has,

146
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:45,149
Which I don't think he's using.

147
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:47,718
I mean, there is
a romance element to this.

148
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:50,888
You can't just sit there
and ask for it.

149
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:52,657
I mean, look right here.

150
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:00,197
Halfway through that mini-bar,

151
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:03,100
He could start giving her
handbags she already has.

152
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:04,635
Yeah.

153
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:06,837
"Uhh! Got
somethin' for you."

154
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:09,140
What about the romance?

155
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:11,242
Don't you think a guy
should be a little, well...

156
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,743
Little touches,
a little something,

157
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:14,211
Rather than just,
"hey, hey, hey."

158
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,047
It's nice to give, um,

159
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:18,149
You know, someone a gift
like a purse,

160
00:06:18,216 --> 00:06:19,784
But it shouldn't be
like a payment.

161
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:21,085
Right.

162
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:22,153
That makes me crazy.

163
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,521
I don't like that with women.

164
00:06:23,588 --> 00:06:24,855
This has gotta stop.
Yeah.

165
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:27,825
- This, "buy me--
buy me something."

166
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,994
It's embarrassing.

167
00:06:30,062 --> 00:06:31,862
Yeah.

168
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,297
Buy me something.

169
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:35,566
Buy me something.
You're right.

170
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:38,502
It was like some sort of
sex-for-handbag hostage swap.

171
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,738
Is that asking
too much, Matthew?

172
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:43,708
Well, she might mean
be more generous in some way.

173
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:44,842
True.

174
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,210
You know, it was not exactly,

175
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:48,346
"if you buy a handbag
of this value,

176
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:51,716
I will perform the following
one of two options."

177
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:53,084
right.

178
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:55,353
- It--I think it's more,
you know,

179
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,821
"be romantic with me."

180
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:58,856
That would be
the nice way to look at it,

181
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:00,958
And it's possible
that's what she means.

182
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:03,427
She might--although,
she might just mean,

183
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:04,829
"pay this amount
and I'll give in."

184
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:06,297
- But I must admit--

185
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:08,532
But it did sound a little
like bartering, you know?

186
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,334
- It did.
- "I got the purse,

187
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:12,303
You got some love-makin'."

188
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:14,205
You look incredibly sexy
right now.

189
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:16,507
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

190
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:17,875
But in her defense,

191
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:19,276
If his idea
of romantic seduction

192
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:21,679
Is, "uhh! Got somethin'
for you."

193
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,114
Right.

194
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:25,850
- That's what my fed-ex guy
says to me.

195
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,123
And he comes
more than once a week.

196
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:45,836
Line of the week!
That's in the promo.

197
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:47,271
So what do you think,
panelists?

198
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,572
Who do you think I call it for?

199
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,940
Marty?

200
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:52,710
Oh, I'd say you
call it for the, um, husband,

201
00:07:52,778 --> 00:07:55,880
Because I think that
the attitude's wrong,

202
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:57,882
The amount is wrong...
- Uh-huh.

203
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,950
For the husband. Sarah?

204
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:02,486
If I may, I'd like
to call it a draw, Tom,

205
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:05,189
Because I feel that--

206
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:10,995
You know, sex is an important
part of a relationship.

207
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:12,163
That should be respected.

208
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,197
But at the same time,

209
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:15,566
He need to learn what gets her,

210
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:16,834
You know, in the mood for sex,

211
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:19,770
Or at least in the mood
to want to satisfy him

212
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:21,705
If she isn't going to be.

213
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:23,607
Right. That's a good point.
I like that point.

214
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,843
Very clever.

215
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:29,046
Matthew?

216
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:31,182
I think Sarah put it
much better than Martin,

217
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:32,283
First of all.

218
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,386
And...And, um...

219
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:37,822
You bastard.

220
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,123
It's not a competition.

221
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:46,278
Yeah, I feel it would be
awkward to say he's right.

222
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:47,865
I'm not comfortable with that.

223
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:50,734
Tom? Tom? Tom?

224
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,604
Yes, Marty?

225
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:55,940
- I'd like to change my vote.
- No. Okay.

226
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:56,974
- I think it's very hard--

227
00:08:57,042 --> 00:08:59,009
I don't envy you, dude.

228
00:08:59,077 --> 00:09:01,345
I don't think
that it's an easy one.

229
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:05,583
Well, thank you
for all of that, panel.

230
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,118
But I think I am ready
to make the call.

231
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:10,488
Let's go to Abingdon, Maryland,

232
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:11,856
And say hello
to the actual Arringtons

233
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:13,691
In their actual home.

234
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:15,559
Arringtons!

235
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,296
Hey!

236
00:09:19,364 --> 00:09:20,664
Hello.

237
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:21,665
You guys look great.

238
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,400
Thanks for being on our show.

239
00:09:23,468 --> 00:09:24,735
You havin' a good time so far?

240
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:25,870
Yes, yes, yes.

241
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:27,505
Yes, a wonderful time,
thank you.

242
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:28,973
Guys, my call is this.

243
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,176
Therman, you got
a great personality.

244
00:09:32,244 --> 00:09:34,011
You got a beautiful wife.

245
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:35,279
I'm on your side,

246
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:38,682
But what I need you to do
is stop by a florist

247
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,684
And just stand on the street,

248
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:41,886
Stare in the window,

249
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:43,854
Watch the people come and go.

250
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:47,091
You and I both know no one
needs flowers to live,

251
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:48,826
So the question is,

252
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:51,362
Why is this a business?

253
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:56,467
Why is the candy store so busy?

254
00:09:56,535 --> 00:10:00,337
Why do romantic restaurants
take dinner reservations?

255
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:02,640
Tee, you win.

256
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:04,408
Wow!

257
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:12,283
You understand
what I'm saying, therman?

258
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,084
Tom, I was
trying to say something.

259
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:17,354
Tom, I was doing this
for every guy out there.

260
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,523
You know, it starts off
at three and two and one.

261
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,258
I'm just trying
to keep it consistent

262
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:23,260
Before it goes to none
and I fade away to dust.

263
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:26,030
Okay, how about
you be consistent, too?

264
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,933
See, that's an example.

265
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,402
"consistency,"
not a romantic word.

266
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:33,971
That's something you want
from your appliances.

267
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,840
Exactly, consistency, yeah.

268
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:38,609
I don't mean
you should go crazy.

269
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:40,607
How about a t-shirt
with a tuxedo on it?

270
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:46,116
I do all those things, Tom.

271
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:48,452
Oh, not consistently.

272
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:54,224
- Bye-bye.

273
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:58,395
Coming up, another man.

274
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:00,497
Is he a friend?
Is he a boy?

275
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:02,166
He's not a boyfriend!

276
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:04,301
He's a friend that's a boy!

277
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:07,538
Something about
this whole thing is wrong.

278
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:22,208
- Next, we choo-choo
into Chesterland, Ohio,

279
00:11:22,776 --> 00:11:24,911
Near the sparkling shores
of Lake Erie,

280
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:28,114
To meet the Arkenbergs,
Amber and Guy...

281
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:31,017
And some other guy.

282
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:37,423
My girlfriend and I
went to this pub,

283
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:38,658
And he was there.

284
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:40,693
And we saw each other,

285
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:42,161
And it was love at first sight.

286
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:44,330
- My first--
I was in love with--

287
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:45,364
It was love at first sight.

288
00:11:45,432 --> 00:11:47,800
I knew I was gonna marry him.

289
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:50,002
It's been blissful ever since.

290
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:52,839
Blissful?

291
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:04,450
Matt is
like a girlfriend, okay?

292
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:05,651
He's like having a girlfriend.

293
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,353
- But Matt's a guy.
- So what?

294
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:09,455
- Do you realize
you having a boyfriend--

295
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:10,756
- It's not a boyfriend!

296
00:12:10,824 --> 00:12:12,925
He's a friend that's a boy!

297
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:14,794
But it is a boy.

298
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:16,662
He's a--
all right, your man friend.

299
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,264
How's that?
Your man friend.

300
00:12:18,332 --> 00:12:20,533
There are different kinds
of guys, okay?

301
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:22,568
There's guy's guy.
Guys like you.

302
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:23,970
Matt is not like that.

303
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:26,239
I've always been
better friends with women,

304
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:28,708
And I've always
been a good listener.

305
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,810
I can understand
their problems,

306
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:34,046
And I love women,
so I like to talk to 'em.

307
00:12:34,114 --> 00:12:35,514
He has more shoes in his closet

308
00:12:35,582 --> 00:12:37,450
Than I could ever, ever afford.

309
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:38,584
But that's beside the point.

310
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:40,519
He wears pink,
he loves clothes.

311
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:42,455
- But you're not underst--
- We relate.

312
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:45,625
Look, when I met him,
he told me what a stud he was.

313
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:47,126
He showed me pictures
on his phone

314
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:50,563
Of all these women
that he's either dating

315
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:52,765
Or playing
around with right now,

316
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,101
And so I can't understand
how he could be such a stud

317
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:58,237
And not have any intentions
toward my gorgeous wife.

318
00:12:58,305 --> 00:12:59,505
I can be friends with a woman,

319
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:02,675
And it's not my objective
to sleep with her.

320
00:13:02,743 --> 00:13:05,011
2012, when
all the planets align,

321
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:07,246
You know,
something could happen.

322
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:09,115
If you go to the barbershop
enough times,

323
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:10,917
You're gonna get your hair cut.

324
00:13:19,826 --> 00:13:21,394
Wow.

325
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:22,862
The first thing I want to say

326
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,397
To Mr. And Mrs. Arkenberg,

327
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:26,265
Put the knives down!

328
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,634
So the issue here,

329
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:30,369
Is it okay for Amber
to have this guy

330
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:32,104
For a man friend?

331
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:33,139
What do you think?

332
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:35,241
I think that jealous people

333
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:39,612
Are people who can see it
in their own lives to cheat.

334
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,913
- Oh.
- Yeah.

335
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:42,348
Very interesting.

336
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,483
I don't think people
who would never think to cheat

337
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:46,419
Are jealous people.

338
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:47,520
But I see what he's up to.

339
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:49,088
He's like, "oh, I like clothes.

340
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:50,656
I like pink shoes."

341
00:13:50,724 --> 00:13:52,258
He's a double Agent.

342
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:04,103
Sarah, do you feel like
you control those relationships

343
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:05,738
When you're
just friends with a guy?

344
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:07,640
Do you feel like it's up to you

345
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,209
If this is gonna turn
sexual or not?

346
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:12,078
No, I've never considered

347
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:15,648
Any of my guy friends to be...

348
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:16,749
Lovers.

349
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:19,185
But I--when
I'm dating somebody,

350
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:22,755
I don't see anybody else
in a sexual way.

351
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,156
- Right, but...
- And if--

352
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:25,257
You know, if you have
a roving eye,

353
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:27,526
You might be more prone
to be jealous.

354
00:14:27,594 --> 00:14:28,594
Right.

355
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:30,029
- But, you know,
don't you think--

356
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:31,831
And then I want to hear
from matth--

357
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:33,566
But don't you think that...

358
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:38,422
Don't you think that

359
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,554
Even if it's not about sex,

360
00:14:40,674 --> 00:14:44,043
If it upsets him...
Right.

361
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:46,479
Then she should be
responsive to that?

362
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:49,982
I mean, how fascinating
is this, um, guy?

363
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,251
<i>So he toured in Annie once.
Big deal.</i>

364
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:55,955
Let me point out a couple
of interesting items here

365
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:57,256
That I didn't like.

366
00:14:57,324 --> 00:15:00,259
Drinking in the afternoon,

367
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:03,829
Maxed-out porn phone,

368
00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:06,799
And an unaffiliated sideburn.

369
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:19,045
A sideburn with no head of hair

370
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:20,746
To explain where it comes from.

371
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:22,648
Is it part of the beard?

372
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:25,151
Is it part of the scalp?

373
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:28,521
Who do you belong to?

374
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:30,890
So if your boyfriend
had a best friend

375
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:32,391
Who was a woman,

376
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:33,926
And they spent
a lot of time with each other,

377
00:15:33,994 --> 00:15:37,363
And let's just say
she was bald with one sideburn,

378
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:40,399
Would that be a problem
for you?

379
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:42,635
No. I mean, no.

380
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:44,503
I mean, Natalie, how many times

381
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:47,840
Does an average male
have a sexual thought?

382
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:50,209
- Well, the Kinsey institute
says 52--

383
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:52,311
Every 52 seconds.

384
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:53,913
- 52 seconds?
- Yes.

385
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,980
All right, and how long

386
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:56,682
Is your average happy hour
at a bar?

387
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,317
Two hours.

388
00:15:58,385 --> 00:15:59,652
- Two hours?
- Yeah.

389
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:03,089
So that's a minimum
of 120 times

390
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:05,925
That this guy's thinking
about leaping out of his chair

391
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:07,493
On top of this woman.

392
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:10,629
And now--and now,
soak his brain

393
00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:15,801
In what looks like 52 ounces
of afternoon alcohol.

394
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,770
You can see why this husband's
a little concerned.

395
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:18,938
Yeah.

396
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:20,873
How long has she known
the new gentleman?

397
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:22,174
They're
old High School friends,

398
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,509
To answer your question,

399
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:26,312
But they re-connected
on Facebook just two years ago.

400
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:28,581
Oh.

401
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:29,648
Oh!

402
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:31,016
Everybody goes
back on Facebook,

403
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:32,885
And they're like, "oh, remember,
I had a crush on you

404
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:36,188
In third grade."

405
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,090
Do they ever do things
all three of them,

406
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:40,292
Or she only sees him
separately?

407
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,027
Like are there--
are they, uh...

408
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:44,163
You know, they ever go
to those things

409
00:16:44,231 --> 00:16:45,831
That three people go to?

410
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:46,932
What is that?

411
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,467
Don't know what that would be.

412
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:49,502
What is that thing?

413
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:51,170
Like sack races, or...?

414
00:16:51,238 --> 00:16:52,972
Yeah.

415
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,173
You know, at a carnival.

416
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:56,342
- Three-legged race
with each leg tied up.

417
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:57,977
So anyway...

418
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:01,213
But you know what I mean?

419
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,282
Do they cross-friend?

420
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,284
Are they friends?
Is he friends with him, too?

421
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:07,386
Um, it's more Amber and mat

422
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:08,988
They like to shop together,

423
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:10,589
Take pictures together.

424
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:12,525
They like to take
pictures together.

425
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:13,893
- Not together.
- What does that mean?

426
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,227
<i>- What does that mean?
- She's a photographer.</i>

427
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,562
- She's a photographer.
- Yes.

428
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,197
And he's like,
"take a look at this."

429
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:20,499
All right, let's take a break.

430
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:21,600
Stay with us.

431
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:27,373
Coming up, this TV series

432
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,874
Gets even weirder.

433
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:31,076
I'm very puzzled
about these people.

434
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:33,512
I know. If I could
just call on some guy

435
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,914
To help me out right now.

436
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:46,209
All right, we're back
with the Arkenbergs,

437
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:48,244
Amber and Guy.

438
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:49,212
Then answer me this then.

439
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,381
Then if I can
go on the computer

440
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:54,851
And I'll try to reconnect with
some of my old girls that--

441
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:56,253
- Just to prove a point,

442
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,021
You're gonna go
and try to find girlfriends?

443
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:00,624
No, I'll go try to reconnect
with some of the girls

444
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:02,392
I was friends with
in High School,

445
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,894
And you would be okay
with me--

446
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:05,729
- And they'll be going,
"I remember Guy.

447
00:18:05,797 --> 00:18:08,565
"he was student council
president.

448
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:10,434
"he was the hottest guy
in the school.

449
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:11,902
Hell yeah,
I'll hook up with you."

450
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:13,203
That was in junior high

451
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:14,538
When I was
student council president.

452
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,311
All right, Matthew,

453
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:23,380
I'm gonna put you
on the spot first.

454
00:18:23,448 --> 00:18:25,482
I'm very puzzled
about these people.

455
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,950
I know.

456
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,386
Something about this
whole thing is wrong.

457
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:33,156
It feels wrong, that's what
the husband's feeling.

458
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:34,825
The husband thinks it's wrong.

459
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:37,260
You're getting
heavily into this.

460
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:39,496
Yeah, the husband is right
to be concerned.

461
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:41,431
Okay, husband.
Sarah?

462
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:42,666
- She should support--

463
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,801
If he likes something,
she should support it.

464
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:47,637
Well, she likes this guy,
she likes hanging out with him.

465
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:49,873
She wouldn't be hanging out
with him out in the open

466
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:51,775
If there was something
Shady going on.

467
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:54,411
It would be, like,
secret text messages and stuff.

468
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:57,581
But she's open book,
and it's her friend.

469
00:18:57,648 --> 00:18:59,182
Good point.
I like that, Sarah.

470
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,484
- And I want to change.
- You want to change?

471
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:02,452
- Yeah.
- I'll let you change.

472
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,920
- You want to change?
- You can change.

473
00:19:03,988 --> 00:19:05,589
- That sounded good to me.
- That sounded good to you?

474
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:07,424
Okay, let's see what
he sounds like to you.

475
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:08,925
I might change again.
Let me see.

476
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:10,427
Martin?

477
00:19:10,495 --> 00:19:11,928
- I would say 100%--

478
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:14,030
There's no real question
to this--

479
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:16,867
100% on the husband's side.

480
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:20,070
Because "a,"
it's inappropriate.

481
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:23,340
And it doesn't even matter
if there's hanky-panky,

482
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:25,008
And there could be.

483
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:28,712
But if it doesn't
make him comfortable,

484
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:31,448
Then she should respect that
more than anything and say,

485
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:33,183
"honey, you know,
I don't agree with you,

486
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:35,852
"but there's two men here
and I love you,

487
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,854
"and I want to keep you happy.

488
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:39,923
And I hope you'll return
the favor to me someday."

489
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:41,825
So of course
I'm on the husband's side.

490
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:43,960
All right.

491
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:45,695
So--

492
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:47,364
All right.

493
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:50,600
I don't think it's healthy
to tell your spouse

494
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:52,836
Who they can
and can't hang out with.

495
00:19:52,904 --> 00:19:55,672
Okay, all right.
All right, all right.

496
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,741
I have to say, I mean,
we have a husband,

497
00:19:57,808 --> 00:19:59,910
We have a wife,
we have a husband/wife.

498
00:19:59,977 --> 00:20:03,213
I really wish there was
one more opinion.

499
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:05,315
Someone who's been
through the fires,

500
00:20:05,383 --> 00:20:08,451
Been through the wars,
and still standing tall.

501
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,254
If I could just call
on some guy like that

502
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:12,756
To help me out right now.

503
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,793
Whoa.

504
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:17,861
How are you?

505
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:19,996
Jay.
How are you, buddy?

506
00:20:23,568 --> 00:20:24,501
How are you?

507
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:28,872
Thank you, thank you.

508
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,275
I was passing by,
and I heard the argument.

509
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:34,344
Wow.
What are you doing here?

510
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:36,112
You know, I'm watching this.

511
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,548
And I think back
to when I was single

512
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:40,584
And I was working comedy clubs.

513
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:41,718
Right.

514
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:42,886
And I had a friend
who was a stripper

515
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:44,988
Named silver moon.

516
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,191
Now silver moon was my friend.

517
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:49,359
We never had a relationship,

518
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:51,695
And I would go to her
for guidance

519
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:53,897
And ask her questions.
Right.

520
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:56,833
My wife tended to frown
on silver moon.

521
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:01,204
So we are no longer friends.
Right.

522
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:03,473
- And so I gotta go--
see, watching this,

523
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,409
Here's a guy, he says,
"my beautiful wife."

524
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:07,410
He's jealous.

525
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:08,845
How many guys married 18 years

526
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:10,380
Hope their wife
get hit by a bus?

527
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:11,581
Here's a guy--

528
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,850
You know, here's a guy,
he's jealous.

529
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:16,119
He's still in love,
and he gets jealous.

530
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:17,754
So I say, "okay."

531
00:21:17,822 --> 00:21:19,155
And I'm not saying
you have to tell them

532
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:20,457
Who they can and can't be with,

533
00:21:20,524 --> 00:21:22,359
But if I was the wife
I would respect the wishes

534
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:24,394
And go, "you know, if it makes
you that uncomfortable..."

535
00:21:24,462 --> 00:21:26,429
- Right.
- Side with the guy.

536
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:28,531
All right, side with the guy.

537
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:36,506
Let me know how this
10:00 spot works out for you.

538
00:21:36,574 --> 00:21:38,742
I'd be curious.
Yeah.

539
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:40,410
It feels kinda comfortable.

540
00:21:40,478 --> 00:21:41,611
- Yeah, yeah.
- I like it.

541
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,846
I think I'm ready
to make the call

542
00:21:42,913 --> 00:21:44,514
With the help
of my friends here.

543
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,184
Let's go to Chesterland, Ohio,
and bring up

544
00:21:48,252 --> 00:21:51,821
The real Arkenbergs
in their real-life living abode.

545
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,665
How you guys doing?
Good. How are you?

546
00:22:01,732 --> 00:22:03,400
Good.
Are you alone?

547
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:04,634
May I speak freely?

548
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,039
Yeah, we shipped the kids out
till later on this evening.

549
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:11,708
Okay, wasn't talking
about the kids.

550
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:13,510
- No boyfriend here.
- Yeah.

551
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:15,578
I was talking about
your own silver moon.

552
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:18,515
No silver moons here.

553
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:20,817
I gotta say when I look at you,

554
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:23,053
I see a woman that loves
her husband obviously.

555
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,221
I see a woman
that can be trusted.

556
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:29,059
I see a happy family,
a blissful, fulfilling homelife.

557
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:31,227
When I see your man friend,

558
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:34,698
I see a bald, rogue-sideburned
homewrecker.

559
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,304
The dude's gotta go.

560
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:42,539
You win.

561
00:22:42,606 --> 00:22:45,008
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

562
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:46,576
Thank you very much.
We'll see you guys around.

563
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:50,280
Thank you to Jay Leno,
everybody.

564
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:56,252
Thank you.

565
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,488
Coming up, manscaping--

566
00:22:58,556 --> 00:23:00,790
Where do you shave the line?

567
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:03,293
- I don't shave my chest.
- Yes, you do.

568
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,861
I trim, I buzz.

569
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:07,864
He straightens each strand.

570
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:10,600
I think he should let
his freak flag fly.

571
00:23:18,154 --> 00:23:19,888
Okay, let's let our sails out

572
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:22,257
And catamaran
into the shimmering shores

573
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:24,159
Of Lake Ronkonkoma, New York,

574
00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:28,163
To see what's percolating
with the d'amores.

575
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:30,465
Debbie and I
met in High School.

576
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:32,134
37 years we've been together.

577
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,236
You still look 17.

578
00:23:34,303 --> 00:23:35,904
Oh, stop.

579
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:37,272
- Do I look nice today?
- You look gorgeous.

580
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,440
Why do I have to ask you?

581
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:39,808
I thought we were
talking about me.

582
00:23:46,115 --> 00:23:48,850
- I'll have a cup of decaf.
- Decaf. Okay, would you--

583
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:50,585
- But I only want it
if it's freshly brewed

584
00:23:50,653 --> 00:23:51,987
In the last 20 minutes.

585
00:23:52,054 --> 00:23:54,222
In the last 20 minutes.
I got a new one just for you.

586
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,824
- You do? I'll know.
- All right.

587
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,859
What time
did you brew that pot?

588
00:23:57,927 --> 00:24:00,362
I usually brew a fresh one
at 3:00 when I come in.

589
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:02,197
Now you want me to drink
from that 3:00 pot?

590
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:03,498
It's 4:30.

591
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:05,567
When you pour the milk in,
it's supposed to turn--

592
00:24:05,635 --> 00:24:06,902
Like, it's supposed--

593
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:08,737
You don't even have to take
a spoon to it.

594
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:09,971
It's like a good haircut.

595
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,107
I apologize.

596
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:14,176
Because you didn't
have to hear all that.

597
00:24:14,243 --> 00:24:16,578
All she coulda said to you was,

598
00:24:16,646 --> 00:24:21,349
"can I have a cup of freshly
brewed decaf coffee, please?"

599
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:23,351
- Listen, you know--
did I bother you?

600
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:25,620
What's ever good for you.
I'm here to accommodate you.

601
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:27,822
- Okay, then just bring me
a fresh pot of--

602
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,159
- You know what,
I want a fresh cup of decaf.

603
00:24:31,227 --> 00:24:32,227
Okay, sir.

604
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:33,395
Do you know
how much it costs them

605
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:35,797
To brew a pot of decaf?

606
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:37,832
Three cents.

607
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,901
Three cents.
I'm not worth three cents?

608
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:41,870
Oh, my God.

609
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:45,907
See? You see it?

610
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:47,375
Look.
Mario, look.

611
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,878
It doesn't, like--
it doesn't swirl.

612
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:53,014
It just sits.
Very, very sad to me.

613
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:00,889
I need a good two hours, Debbie.
You know that.

614
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,390
Why does it take you two hours?

615
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,925
What is going on
in that bathroom?

616
00:25:03,993 --> 00:25:05,961
- You know, it's the hair.
- I want to come in and watch.

617
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:07,128
No.

618
00:25:07,196 --> 00:25:09,631
I don't shave my chest.
Yes, you do.

619
00:25:09,699 --> 00:25:11,967
I trim, I buzz.
I buzz.

620
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:13,101
It looks horrible.

621
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:15,136
- No, it--no, it doesn't.
To whom?

622
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:17,372
To who's looking at it, me.

623
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,074
Mario, what are you doing?

624
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:21,443
I have to blow out my hair.
I have to finish shaving.

625
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,212
I have no cologne on.
I didn't exfoliate.

626
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,082
I have to shave, I shave,
then I take a shower.

627
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:29,484
Then I come out
and I shave again.

628
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:31,686
You look good, you feel good.

629
00:25:31,754 --> 00:25:33,488
I feel like [bleep].

630
00:25:38,194 --> 00:25:40,795
- Whoo-hoo!

631
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,568
Well, I think
we're clear on that.

632
00:25:46,636 --> 00:25:49,170
These are two classic
problem areas for couples--

633
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:50,805
Restaurants and bathrooms.

634
00:25:50,873 --> 00:25:52,774
What do you think?

635
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,376
Coffee, you know,
that's been heating

636
00:25:54,443 --> 00:25:56,945
For more than 20 minutes
doesn't--I agree with her.

637
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,179
Oh, really?

638
00:25:58,247 --> 00:25:59,214
Yeah, and I'm not afraid

639
00:25:59,282 --> 00:26:00,949
To go into a lengthy discussion

640
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,717
About it at a restaurant.
He's going like this.

641
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:05,086
And, you know, there's
a whole world out there.

642
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:08,523
So I think that he should--
he should relax.

643
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:11,059
Natalie,
does Debbie have a point?

644
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:13,428
How long does coffee
stay fresh in a pot?

645
00:26:13,496 --> 00:26:15,530
Debbie and Matthew
have a good point.

646
00:26:15,598 --> 00:26:18,199
Decaf coffee sitting in a pot
actually goes bad

647
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:19,734
After about 30 minutes.

648
00:26:19,802 --> 00:26:22,771
Or as she would say,
"30 minutes."

649
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,775
"30 minutes."

650
00:26:29,712 --> 00:26:32,080
I had an Uncle that used
to gesture like this.

651
00:26:32,148 --> 00:26:34,149
I'll tell you,
I got three reasons

652
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:37,218
Why that's a bad idea.

653
00:26:37,286 --> 00:26:40,555
Well, I have a feeling that
he has very Curly body hair.

654
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:41,656
Right.

655
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:44,259
That he straightens
each strand.

656
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:48,530
I'm Italian.
I'm hairy.

657
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:52,801
Underneath this, there's a lot
of nastiness going on.

658
00:26:52,868 --> 00:26:54,836
But two hours?

659
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,237
I mean, in your own home too.

660
00:26:56,305 --> 00:26:58,573
When I have to trim up,
I do it in a hotel.

661
00:26:58,641 --> 00:27:02,644
I'm not gonna make a mess
in my own home.

662
00:27:02,712 --> 00:27:04,212
We have two issues.
Yeah.

663
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,281
We have the coffee.
We have the bathroom.

664
00:27:06,349 --> 00:27:07,482
Which way do you wanna go?

665
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,783
You can split your vote
if you want.

666
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:10,885
Well, I would say the coffee,

667
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:14,189
Absolutely, she has a right
to have fresh coffee.

668
00:27:14,256 --> 00:27:17,192
And when it comes
to the bathroom,

669
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:19,561
He's spending
too much time in there.

670
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:21,529
What do you got, Sarah?

671
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:22,931
I agree that the coffee,

672
00:27:22,998 --> 00:27:25,500
You should be able to order
the coffee the way you want,

673
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,870
And--but she could maybe
be nicer about it.

674
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,005
Not that she was rude,
but you know how you do

675
00:27:31,073 --> 00:27:33,108
That, like, apology thing like,

676
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:37,078
"I'm so sorry, but I just really
like my decaf really fresh.

677
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:40,515
And I know I'm being awful,
but would you mind--"

678
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,150
You know what I mean, like--
and then--

679
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:43,752
oh, thank you.

680
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:46,187
Very good.

681
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:48,957
And the bathroom, um,

682
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:51,426
I feel that bathroom time
is private time,

683
00:27:51,494 --> 00:27:52,794
And he can have that
if he wants it.

684
00:27:52,862 --> 00:27:54,095
Okay.

685
00:27:54,163 --> 00:27:55,730
Matthew?

686
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:57,766
- I think the coffee--

687
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:00,635
I see she could probably
be a little, you know--

688
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:02,237
She could be quicker
in saying what she--

689
00:28:02,304 --> 00:28:03,438
She probably didn't
have to explain

690
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:05,373
The whole reason
to the waiter, maybe.

691
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:07,108
But I think she should order
however she wants

692
00:28:07,176 --> 00:28:08,376
And whatever she wants.

693
00:28:08,444 --> 00:28:09,544
I side with her.

694
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:11,045
- Uh-huh.

695
00:28:11,113 --> 00:28:12,447
Bathroom, he should take
as long as he wants.

696
00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:14,682
She should be happy he's gone
for a few hours, right?

697
00:28:17,353 --> 00:28:19,220
All right, I'm ready
to make the call.

698
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:21,356
Let's meet the actual d'amores

699
00:28:21,424 --> 00:28:24,125
<i>In their bellissima
Lake Ronkonkoma villa.</i>

700
00:28:25,928 --> 00:28:28,396
D'amores, how are you?

701
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:30,398
We're great.
Thank you.

702
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:32,500
- Can I please speak?
- Go ahead.

703
00:28:32,568 --> 00:28:34,302
Do you like it better if I say,

704
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,405
"can I please have
a cup of decaf,

705
00:28:37,473 --> 00:28:38,907
But I want it freshly brewed."

706
00:28:38,974 --> 00:28:41,443
Then she brings it, I know
it's more than 20 minutes old,

707
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,977
And I say,
"bring it back."

708
00:28:43,045 --> 00:28:44,512
Is that better?

709
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,648
That's not better.
It's a little better.

710
00:28:46,715 --> 00:28:48,550
Why does Debbie go into
this long speech

711
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:50,318
About ordering coffee?

712
00:28:50,386 --> 00:28:52,287
Just say, "I'd like a cup
of freshly brewed decaf."

713
00:28:52,354 --> 00:28:54,456
- That's what I said.
- Why put time on it?

714
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:55,957
If it's not fresh...

715
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,559
I'll know if it's 21 minutes.

716
00:28:57,626 --> 00:28:59,227
When you put the milk in...

717
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:00,762
Yeah?

718
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,097
It turns by itself.
I don't care what you say.

719
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:06,100
It's almost poetry,
okay, the way it turns.

720
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:08,870
Just keep it short.

721
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:11,239
Decaf, fresh, the end.

722
00:29:11,307 --> 00:29:13,274
Okay, all right,
you're kinda piling on Debbie

723
00:29:13,342 --> 00:29:14,909
A little bit there, but, Mario,

724
00:29:14,977 --> 00:29:17,579
How many times
did you shave today?

725
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:21,416
Oh.

726
00:29:21,484 --> 00:29:23,952
Mario was up at--wide-eyed--
5:30 A.M.,

727
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:25,887
I kid you not.

728
00:29:25,955 --> 00:29:28,189
You know what, I think
I'm ready to make the call.

729
00:29:28,257 --> 00:29:31,693
Debbie, in a restaurant,
you're entitled--

730
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,695
You're entitled to get
your coffee the way you want.

731
00:29:33,762 --> 00:29:35,864
But you know what,
I can't take the suspicions,

732
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:38,533
The accusations,
the "I'll knows."

733
00:29:38,601 --> 00:29:40,735
"I'll know."

734
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:42,637
I was a waiter.

735
00:29:42,705 --> 00:29:45,039
Just order the coffee
and drink it.

736
00:29:45,107 --> 00:29:46,407
Mario, you win that one.

737
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:49,210
Wow.

738
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,447
- Mario, two hours in--

739
00:29:52,515 --> 00:29:54,916
Two hours in the bathroom.

740
00:29:54,984 --> 00:30:00,221
<i>The entire cast of avatar
got ready in an hour.</i>

741
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:03,525
If you're not coming out of
there blue and 15 feet tall,

742
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:06,895
You're taking too much time.

743
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:08,229
You're a man.

744
00:30:08,297 --> 00:30:11,165
45 minutes--that's it,
or we're coming in.

745
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:12,834
Debbie, you win that one.

746
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:15,203
Whoo!

747
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,705
No.

748
00:30:17,773 --> 00:30:19,741
So...

749
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:25,050
So what we have here is a tie.

750
00:30:25,418 --> 00:30:30,053
The good news is I have
a way to break that tie.

751
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:31,554
With this.

752
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:44,359
Coming up, male exotic dancing.

753
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:45,961
Well, what he did on the screen

754
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:48,430
Is outlawed
in about seven States.

755
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:03,058
All right, Mario's won one.

756
00:31:03,526 --> 00:31:04,793
Debbie's won one.

757
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:07,562
And here is the tie-breaker.

758
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,930
I believe wholeheartedly

759
00:31:08,998 --> 00:31:10,665
In being an individual.

760
00:31:15,238 --> 00:31:17,172
He's an individual.
He wants to country line dance.

761
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,740
I don't understand
why he doesn't want

762
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:20,442
To country line dance with me.

763
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,245
If I'm gonna
country line dance,

764
00:31:23,312 --> 00:31:25,280
I will.

765
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:28,049

- Nothing.

00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:40,695

772

Absolutely.

774
00:31:46,836 --> 00:31:49,337
Debbie and I
have hobbies together

775
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:50,605
And separately.

776
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:52,474
And it's those separate things

777
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:54,809

00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:27,742
So should he be allowed
to do this on his own or not?

786
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,277
Well, what he did on the screen

787
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:32,213
Is outlawed
in about seven States.

788
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:36,217
That is line dancing
as done by miss Liza Minnelli.

789
00:32:36,285 --> 00:32:38,086
So I--

790
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:40,288
Country line dancing.

791
00:32:40,356 --> 00:32:41,489
"country Liza" it's called.

792
00:32:41,557 --> 00:32:42,724
What country?

793
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:44,292
What country?

794
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,561
What country is that?

795
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:50,966
Brazil during carnivale, 1968?

796
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:53,902
Well, Sarah,
what'd you think, baby?

797
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,304
Is she dying so much
to line dance?

798
00:32:56,372 --> 00:32:57,639
Yeah, that's a good point.

799
00:32:57,707 --> 00:33:00,141
She didn't even say
she liked it.

800
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:02,277
She doesn't look like she's
really itching to get out there.

801
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:06,147
She's itching a lot,
but not itching to get out.

802
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:07,849
- I like how she does this.
- She's itching a little.

803
00:33:11,153 --> 00:33:12,520
Do you dance, Matthew?

804
00:33:12,588 --> 00:33:14,689
Yeah, once in a while.

805
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:15,857
Oh, you're a good dancer.
Don't be modest.

806
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:17,258
Every once in a while
on Broadway.

807
00:33:17,326 --> 00:33:18,393
Yeah.
Bravo!

808
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:21,896
Bravo!

809
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:26,067
Thank you for that.

810
00:33:26,135 --> 00:33:28,169
He, uh, danced in two musicals,

811
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:30,138
And he won two Tonys for them.

812
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:32,507
Bravo!

813
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:35,176
Thank you again.

814
00:33:35,244 --> 00:33:38,113
Yeah, he should be allowed
to line dance all he wants.

815
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,148
- He should be allowed to dance?
- Yeah.

816
00:33:40,216 --> 00:33:42,250
Natalie, do we have
any facts on this guy?

817
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:45,854
Um, you know, they used
to tap dance together

818
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,922
Back in the day,
so this is just--

819
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,591
He's evolved.

820
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:51,259
All right, I think I know
which way you're leaning,

821
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:52,494
But, Matthew, you say?

822
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:54,562
I say dance away.

823
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,830
Dance away.
Sarah?

824
00:33:55,898 --> 00:33:59,467
I think he should let
his freak flag fly.

825
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:04,172
I say let him dance.

826
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,174
- Let him dance.
- Yeah.

827
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:07,742
All right,
let's bring them back up.

828
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:10,912
Whoo!

829
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,981
Debbie, you say you want
to go with him

830
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:15,316
And meet his friends and stuff,

831
00:34:15,384 --> 00:34:17,519
But the look on your face
tells me you'd rather

832
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:21,289
Stay at home with a nice,
hot, fresh cup of decaf

833
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:24,793
Just swirling away.

834
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,062
So I have to give this one
to Mario,

835
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:29,164
Because when I see him
dancing in the kitchen,

836
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:32,867
I see the happiest man
I've ever seen in my life.

837
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:40,475
Mario...

838
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:43,244
Two out of three.
You win.

839
00:34:43,312 --> 00:34:46,281
Yay!
Whoo!

840
00:34:46,348 --> 00:34:48,016
I think you guys are great.

841
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:50,185
Debbie, we love you.

842
00:34:50,252 --> 00:34:51,653
- No, you don't.
- I do.

843
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:55,223
Debbie, I see you,
I see every aunt

844
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:57,358
That has ever given me
a big hug at Christmas.

845
00:34:57,426 --> 00:34:59,728
This isn't one of those shows
where we make people

846
00:34:59,795 --> 00:35:01,996
Feel better
and try and fix things.

847
00:35:02,064 --> 00:35:03,665
Two out of three.
He wins.

848
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,200
And you know what,
if you really want to get

849
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:06,835
That coffee swirling,
start the music,

850
00:35:06,902 --> 00:35:08,269
Let Mario hold the pot,

851
00:35:08,337 --> 00:35:11,473
Watch that cream go 'round
like a Kansas twister.

852
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:14,209
You guys are awesome.

853
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:15,577
Awesome!

854
00:35:15,644 --> 00:35:18,680
Next, we're going to go
deep into middle earth

855
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:20,482
And see what's down there.

856
00:35:24,053 --> 00:35:26,654
Coming up, the panel fights

857
00:35:26,722 --> 00:35:29,557
To keep from becoming
completely incoherent.

858
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:30,759
Diet pills.

859
00:35:30,826 --> 00:35:32,460
She's got a kinda
Celine Dion thing going.

860
00:35:32,528 --> 00:35:33,962
He seemed to have such
a sweet feeling

861
00:35:34,029 --> 00:35:35,263
About those toys.

862
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:37,499
I think they should
get divorced.

863
00:35:38,934 --> 00:35:40,835
And this month's selection

864
00:35:40,903 --> 00:35:43,104
<i>From the marriage ref
book club--</i>

865
00:35:43,172 --> 00:35:45,573
<i>The bedwetter
by Sarah Silverman,</i>

866
00:35:45,641 --> 00:35:47,976
A poignant, embarrassing memoir

867
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:50,879
Of a young girl's life.

868
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:53,648
And there's no real book club.

869
00:35:58,983 --> 00:36:02,085
All right,
next we're gonna amble

870
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:04,488
Into the heart
of hometown Americana--

871
00:36:04,555 --> 00:36:06,523
Washington township,
new Jersey,

872
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:08,191
And meet the Hamiltons

873
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:13,763
Where husband Ash is lost
in a world of his own.

874
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:16,566
Interestingly enough,
we met on the Internet.

875
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:18,368
I was in a movie chat room.

876
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:19,736
Can I press
one of your buttons?

877
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,805
So my nickname was something
that she recognized.

878
00:36:21,873 --> 00:36:23,673
Which was really
kind of bizarre.

879
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:26,109
It wasn't just a fluke,
and I knew that.

880
00:36:26,177 --> 00:36:28,945
And I knew that that was it
from there on.

881
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,720
I don't have
an unhealthy obsession

882
00:36:36,787 --> 00:36:41,458
<i>About lord of the rings.</i>

883
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,450
Lord of the Rings is overwhelming
our home.

884
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,844
What say you?

885
00:36:45,964 --> 00:36:47,907
And in the long run,
the memorabilia was

886
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:50,295
To send our son to college.

887
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:52,246
But I think that was just
a ploy to get all the goodies

888
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:53,715
In the house, and now the value

889
00:36:53,782 --> 00:36:55,583
Is dropping rapidly.

890
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:57,518
I am Anduril,
flame of the West.

891
00:36:57,586 --> 00:37:00,421
Let the thralls of Mordor
flee before me.

892
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:04,025
<i>Lord of the rings
presents a world untainted.</i>

893
00:37:04,093 --> 00:37:05,593
Okay?

894
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:07,629
It represents
the kind of platonic love

895
00:37:07,696 --> 00:37:09,397
That we don't see often.

896
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:11,599
I don't even get what
happened in those movies.

897
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:14,102
The ring was the embodiment
of evil.

898
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:15,870
Excuse me, when they look
into each other's eyes

899
00:37:15,938 --> 00:37:18,306
And he gets all jealous
of the Gollum.

900
00:37:18,374 --> 00:37:20,608
What, like a son can't look
into his father's eyes

901
00:37:20,676 --> 00:37:21,843
And be like,
"thank you for rescuing me."

902
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,611
He's jealous of the Gollum.

903
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,046
It is the same kind.

904
00:37:25,114 --> 00:37:26,714
He's jealous of the Gollum
that he's spending

905
00:37:26,782 --> 00:37:28,049
Too much time with the Gollum.

906
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:29,817
He actually looks
kinda mopey at times.

907
00:37:29,885 --> 00:37:31,786
There are times that his eyes
fill up with tears and--

908
00:37:31,854 --> 00:37:34,756
- It is a supernatural burden
that they are carrying.

909
00:37:34,823 --> 00:37:36,257
They're saving the world.

910
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:38,192
Okay.

911
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,861
Look at all those tubs.

912
00:37:39,928 --> 00:37:41,362
Most of the people
that have this

913
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,297
Are, like, living in their
mother's basement right now.

914
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:45,166
Ash, if you look on eBay
right now,

915
00:37:45,234 --> 00:37:46,601
They're going
for, like, 89 cents.

916
00:37:46,669 --> 00:37:48,670
- So then we need to keep them.
If they're going for--

917
00:37:48,737 --> 00:37:49,971
- Look, okay, so they're--

918
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,773
- Actually, this is bilingual.

919
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,441
How many Gollums do we have?

920
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:55,176
But if you look,
they go through

921
00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:58,046
A foreign subsidiary
to release the figures.

922
00:37:58,113 --> 00:38:01,149
What does that matter?
It is the same figure.

923
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,184
It's just something cool.

924
00:38:03,252 --> 00:38:05,520
<i>I got all the bilingual cards
in the star wars stuff too.</i>

925
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:06,621
It's just cool.

926
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,322
I think you should pick one

927
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,490
And that's it.

928
00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:10,792
I would like to have both sets.

929
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:13,494
I don't see any harm
in having both sets.

930
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:16,197
Do you know what a geek
you sound like right now?

931
00:38:16,265 --> 00:38:18,513
Yeah, but it also has sounds.

932
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:21,615
What say you? What say you?

933
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:28,943
Should Ash have to get rid

934
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:30,812
<i>Of his beloved
lord of the rings collection?</i>

935
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:33,181
She's got a kinda
Celine Dion thing going,

936
00:38:33,248 --> 00:38:35,616
And maybe he doesn't like that.

937
00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:37,885
I think that
when you're in love,

938
00:38:37,953 --> 00:38:40,254
You have to support
each other's passions.

939
00:38:40,322 --> 00:38:44,358
<i>And she should support
his love of lord of the rings.</i>

940
00:38:44,426 --> 00:38:46,928
He should support her love
of diet pills

941
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:48,529
Or whatever her hobby is.

942
00:38:50,165 --> 00:38:52,100
What do you think, Matthew?

943
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,401
Wow.

944
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:57,939
My feelings are basically
15 fold.

945
00:38:58,006 --> 00:38:59,440
Wow.

946
00:38:59,508 --> 00:39:02,110
I don't know.
You know, I know typically

947
00:39:02,177 --> 00:39:04,912
When one gets married,
you give up everything you like

948
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,882
And that--the things--

949
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,650
You know, you're not allowed
to take things

950
00:39:09,718 --> 00:39:11,519
From childhood into adulthood.

951
00:39:11,587 --> 00:39:13,354
Right.

952
00:39:13,422 --> 00:39:15,890
This has come to us down
from the Mayan times.

953
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,495
But he seemed to have
such a sweet feeling

954
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:23,397
About those toys
that I sympathized

955
00:39:23,465 --> 00:39:25,032
And want him to have them.

956
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,169
Look, I have been married
for a long time.

957
00:39:28,237 --> 00:39:29,837
- Uh-huh.

958
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:31,539
And I think the secret
is you've gotta be sensitive

959
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:33,908
To your wife's needs,
and in my case

960
00:39:33,976 --> 00:39:35,810
Make sure your personal
assistant fulfills them.

961
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:37,011
But that's me.

962
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:40,548
That's Hollywood,
ladies and gentlemen.

963
00:39:40,616 --> 00:39:42,283
What do you think, Sarah?

964
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:43,718
I think that you have
to support each other

965
00:39:43,786 --> 00:39:46,020
And love each other
and--you know?

966
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:48,623
And support
each other's habits,

967
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,627
<i>Whether it be lord of the rings
or crack cocaine.</i>

968
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:55,730
Or something in between.

969
00:39:55,798 --> 00:39:57,431
All right, panelists, who
do you think I should go for,

970
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:58,432
Husband or the wife?

971
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,901
Matthew, bottom line?

972
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:01,102
The husband.

973
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:04,839
The husband.
All right, Sarah?

974
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:06,407
I'm gonna go husband,

975
00:40:06,475 --> 00:40:09,210
But I think
they should get divorced.

976
00:40:10,779 --> 00:40:11,979
Marty?

977
00:40:12,047 --> 00:40:14,515
I think that it's his right
to do that,

978
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:18,085
And she should be patient.

979
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,286
All right, all for the husband.

980
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:25,455
Let's go to actual Washington
and bring out the actual Hamiltons

981
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:26,989
in their actual township.

982
00:40:31,194 --> 00:40:32,861
Hello.

983
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,863
Hi.

984
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:36,231
All right, Betty,

985
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:38,600
A man's mind needs to be

986
00:40:38,668 --> 00:40:41,537
Partially occupied at all times

987
00:40:41,604 --> 00:40:44,273
By something stupid.

988
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,842
Because it keeps a guy's brain
from doing something else.

989
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,510
And whatever
that something else is,

990
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:50,245
You don't want him doing it.

991
00:40:50,313 --> 00:40:52,347
Exactly.

992
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:53,415
Ash, you win.

993
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:56,251
Oh, that is so not right.

994
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,754
That is so not right.

995
00:40:58,821 --> 00:41:02,057
Anything you would like
to ask the couple?

996
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:04,593
I had something.

997
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:06,295
Is it that it takes up
too much room?

998
00:41:06,362 --> 00:41:08,230
Or is it that he still seems
sorta childlike?

999
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:10,198
Or--what bothers you
about it?

1000
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:11,800
Childlike.

1001
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:13,035
I'm sorry.

1002
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:14,536
Why would I think
that was childlike?

1003
00:41:14,604 --> 00:41:16,138
Forgive me, forgive me.

1004
00:41:16,205 --> 00:41:18,106
Does he seem
too grown up to you?

1005
00:41:20,276 --> 00:41:22,010
No encouragement, please.

1006
00:41:22,078 --> 00:41:23,378
You know, Ash,
the more you speak,

1007
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:25,080
The more you lose
everyone's vote.

1008
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:26,848
So I would...Shh.

1009
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,317
Thank you, Hamiltons.
Good bye.

1010
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:33,422
And for being
such great sports tonight,

1011
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:36,425
All our couples will receive
a romantic second honeymoon

1012
00:41:36,492 --> 00:41:39,328
Furnished by royal Caribbean
international.

1013
00:41:39,395 --> 00:41:40,662
So that's our show.

1014
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,397
We'd like to thank
our panel of experts--

1015
00:41:42,465 --> 00:41:43,398
Martin short,

1016
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:45,300
Sarah Silverman,

1017
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:47,302
Matthew Broderick.
Thank you!

1018
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,904
And especially to all
our couples tonight,

1019
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:50,872
Thank you for letting us
into your marriage.

1020
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,507
It's worth fighting for.

1021
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:54,476
Now kiss and make up.

1022
00:41:54,544 --> 00:41:56,378
Good night, everybody.
