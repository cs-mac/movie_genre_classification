1
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,460
They actually pay you for this,

2
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,460
to tag beaver?

3
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,460
Imagine.

4
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,460
Was that, like, sarcastic?

5
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,470
'Cause I know what you
Fish and Game guys think

6
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,470
of county sheriffs.

7
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,470
We know you like to
give these one-word,

8
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,480
sarcastic answers.

9
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,480
Gee.

10
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
You ask me,

11
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
what an animal does in the wild

12
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,490
is his own business.

13
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,490
So long as he
doesn't do it to man.

14
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,490
I think Mark Twain said that.

15
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,500
Yeah, I think he didn't.

16
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,500
But since you said it,
I guess we're covered.

17
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,530
Everyone's a comedian, sarcastic.

18
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,630
I'm sleepin'.

19
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,630
And right in the middle
of a good dream.

20
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,640
And all at once I wake up.

21
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,640
From something that keeps
knocking at my brain.

22
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Before I go in sane.

23
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,650
I hold my pillow to my head...

24
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,690
Aah! Aah!

25
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,700
So what am I so afraid of.

26
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of...

27
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,700
Help!

28
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,710
I think I love you.

29
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,710
Isn't that what life is made of.

30
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,720
Though it worries...

31
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Aah ha!

32
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Ohh! Ohh!

33
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
No! Aah!

34
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,750
Aah!

35
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Ohh! Don't let go!

36
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,770
Oh ho ho!

37
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,770
Aah!

38
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,790
Aw, Jesus Christ.

39
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,810
Kelly?

40
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,810
Hey, Kevin.

41
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,820
Hi.

42
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Listen, uh, could I
Steal you for a minute?

43
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,830
What are you doing?

44
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,840
Heavy breathing, meditating.

45
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Meditating?

46
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Yes. To relieve stress.

47
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Remember, Myra, you're the one

48
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
who taught me all about breathing.

49
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,850
Yes, but you're doing Lamaze.
Are you giving birth?

50
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,850
If you're upset,
long, deep breaths.

51
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,860
Kevin dumped me.

52
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,860
I know.

53
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,860
He told you?

54
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,870
Well, I sort of had, uh,
inside information.

55
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
You?

56
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,880
It started before you, Kelly.

57
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
I never would have--

58
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
You?

59
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,880
It was just a quick thing
That we thought was over,

60
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,890
and...it's not over.

61
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,890
You and Kevin.

62
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,890
I--I wish I could
say something to...

63
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,900
the heart wants
what the heart wants.

64
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,920
Sheriff Keough?

65
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
Yeah.

66
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Fish and Game.
Jack Wells.

67
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Any recent bear attacks?

68
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
This was no bear.

69
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,930
Bears don't attack
people underwater.

70
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,930
Probably a beaver, then.

71
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,930
Ah, a whole sentence sarcastic.

72
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,950
That the way
he came out of the water?

73
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,960
Yeah.

74
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,970
Hey.

75
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,970
Hey, Kevin, what's going on?
What's happening?

76
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,980
How's it goin'?
How's your family? Good?

77
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,980
It's great.
So nice to see you.

78
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,980
Fuck off.

79
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,980
This is business.

80
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,980
There was an accident in Maine.

81
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,990
Some guy got killed
by something in a lake.

82
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,990
Probably a bear,
But they found a tooth.

83
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,990
A tooth?

84
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,990
A fragment of a tooth,

85
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,000
one they say couldn't
have come from any bear.

86
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Evidently it looks prehistoric,
like maybe a dinosaur.

87
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,010
Oh, well, then I'm sure
that that's what it was.

88
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,010
He was killed by a dinosaur.

89
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,010
Is there anything else?

90
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,010
I, uh, want you to go there.

91
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,020
What?

92
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,020
It's probably nothing,
But you're a paleontologist.

93
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,020
This is what we do.

94
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,020
What do you mean,
this is what we do?

95
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,030
I'd like you to
check out this tooth.

96
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,030
I'm not a field person.

97
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,030
Well, on this one,
I would like you to be.

98
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,040
You want me to go to Maine
to look at a tooth?

99
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Oh, this was Myra's
idea, wasn't it?

100
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,040
- Uh--
-Oh, of course.

101
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,050
Get me out of the office
for a few days,

102
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,050
wait till I cool off...

103
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,050
It has nothing to do with that.

104
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,050
I don't do field work,
and even if I did, Maine?

105
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,050
I'm allergic to timber.

106
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,060
- Kelly.
- I am not going to Maine.

107
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,060
I'm not going to Maine.

108
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,060
It's ridiculous.

109
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,070
It's gonna be rough

110
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,070
as we go over these mountains.

111
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,080
Yeah, that's fine.
Thank you.

112
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,080
We're doing the best we can.

113
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,090
Could you not talk to me?

114
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:10,090
Thank you.

115
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Just came up screaming.

116
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
What did he say?

117
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,110
Just kind of gurgled.
He was pretty much dead.

118
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,110
You didn't see anything?

119
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,110
The lake was calm
until up he came.

120
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,110
The tooth is in here.

121
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,120
Oh, that's--
that's the morgue.

122
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
Yes.

123
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Well, is the dead guy in there?

124
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,130
That's where they keep them.

125
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,130
Look...

126
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,130
you want me to bring
the tooth out here?

127
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,130
No.

128
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,130
No. Let's...

129
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,130
After you.

130
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,140
This is reptilian.
And this is not a fossil.

131
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,140
You really pulled this
out of this guy?

132
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,150
Yes, I did.

133
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,150
I'll need to get
a microscopic look at it.

134
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,150
There you go.

135
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,160
Great.

136
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Maybe I should see--

137
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,160
I wouldn't.

138
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,170
I can deal with
dead men--bodies.

139
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,170
Ohh.

140
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,180
Uhh. Ohh, jeez.

141
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,190
How long did this attack
go on for?

142
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,190
Seconds.
8 maybe 10.

143
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,190
Oh, and, uh, this is how
he came up to the boat?

144
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,200
Yes.

145
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Uh-huh.

146
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,200
I'd like to see this lake.

147
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,210
Nobody lives
with in 25 miles of it,

148
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,210
except some old couple
who live right on the lake.

149
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,210
Teenagers trek in
every once in a while

150
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,220
to skinny-dip.

151
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,220
None have disappeared.

152
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,220
None have spotted
anything unusual.

153
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,220
Did you talk to the old couple?

154
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,230
Not yet.

155
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,230
What kind of backup do we have?

156
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,230
We?

157
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,230
What?

158
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,240
I'm a little unclear
as to why the museum

159
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
would send somebody here.

160
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
You got a thing against museums?

161
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
No, I got nothing against museums.

162
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,250
Ever been in one?

163
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,250
What is that?

164
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,260
Lightweight forward-area
air-device unit.

165
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,260
Whatever's out there,

166
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,260
one shot with this, it's dead.

167
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,260
Why exactly would you have that?

168
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,270
God.

169
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,280
Mosquitoes. I got a thing
about mosquitoes.

170
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
If you're all set, let's go.

171
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
We're saved.

172
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
A museum in New York

173
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,280
just sent us some
additional backup.

174
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,290
Kelly Scott.

175
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,290
Jack Wells.

176
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,290
Hi.

177
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,290
Uh, some museum sent you, huh?

178
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,300
What, are we all
museum bigots in Maine?

179
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
She's rude sarcastic.

180
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
You two should get along.

181
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
I'm afraid I can't let you
go with us, ma'am.

182
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,310
Sheriff Keough said I could.

183
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,310
Unfortunately, Fish and Game
supersedes the sheriff.

184
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,310
Why do you have to supersede?
Maybe I might be of--

185
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,310
Ma'am, look,

186
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,310
this isn't some kind of
fact-finding expedition.

187
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,320
Yes, I know that.

188
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
It's not a science trip.

189
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Could you be
a little more condescending?

190
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,320
'Cause I'm not real great
with subtlety.

191
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,330
Something in that lake
killed somebody, right?

192
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,330
I appreciate
you're trying to help.

193
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,330
I'm really glad that you
brought the raid.

194
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,330
Now, that's better.

195
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,340
Ma'am,
it's not gonna work--

196
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,340
If you call me "ma'am"
one more time, I'll sue you,

197
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,340
and with today's laws,
it's possible.

198
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,340
She's good.

199
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,350
Look, I won't interfere.

200
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,350
And if I do, you've got
a sheriff handy to arrest me,

201
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,350
but I understand if I threaten
your Fish and Game authority--

202
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,350
Excuse me.

203
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,360
Is it true you're going to look

204
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
for some kind of monster
in Black Lake?

205
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,360
Well, we're just gonna
investigate an accident.

206
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
There's no monster.

207
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,370
We heard a man was bit in half.

208
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,370
Well, there was an accident.

209
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:53,370
That's all. It's
nothing to worry about.

210
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,380
Oh, please.

211
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,390
All right. Let's go.

212
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,410
Well, my husband passed away.

213
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,420
It's been almost 2 years now.

214
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,420
My department doesn't
have any record of that,

215
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,420
Mrs. Bickerman.

216
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Well, I'm sorry.

217
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,430
Incomplete records haunt me so.

218
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,430
What was the cause
of your husband's death,

219
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,430
ma'am, do you know?

220
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,440
We don't mean
to invade your privacy,

221
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
but was he ill?
Was he sick?

222
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
Was he swallowed?

223
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Sheriff.

224
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Uh, Mrs. Bickerman,
the reason we're here.

225
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,450
A man was fatally
attacked yesterday

226
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,450
by some animal in this lake.

227
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,450
Do you know how your husband died?

228
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,450
Oh, yes.

229
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,460
I killed him.

230
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,460
You killed him?

231
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,460
Oh, yes.

232
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,460
Uh...

233
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,470
and how would you have
accomplished this, ma'am?

234
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,470
Well...

235
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,470
He was very sick,

236
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,480
and--and he refused
to go to a doctor.

237
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,480
He'd be coherent one day
and incoherent the next.

238
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,480
And, well, one coherent day

239
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
he asked me to end his suffering.

240
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,490
And, um...

241
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,490
he kept insisting and insisting

242
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,500
and then, well,
finally I just gave in,

243
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
and I hit him on the head
with a skillet,

244
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,500
then buried him
out at the bulkhead.

245
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,510
Well, dig him up
if you don't believe me,

246
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,510
Sherlock.

247
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Half mile up
there's a clearing.

248
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
What's with the water?
It's so black.

249
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,530
There's no waves or anything.

250
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,530
Well, they wanted to
call it "Lake Placid, "

251
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,530
but somebody said
that name was taken.

252
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,540
It's too bad.

253
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
Tents were sent ahead.

254
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,540
They should already be set up

255
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,540
by the time we get there.

256
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,550
Tents?

257
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,550
We're staying in tents?

258
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,550
I told you, 2 days
we'd have to camp.

259
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,550
Yes, camp,

260
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,550
but I thought that meant
"Ramada Inn."

261
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,560
I never heard tents.
Will there be toilets?

262
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Maybe we should
just take you back.

263
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,560
Why, because I prefer a toilet?

264
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
Oh, God.

265
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,570
We forgot to pack
feminine napkins.

266
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,570
Oh, so you're with him now?

267
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,570
Taking his side.

268
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,570
I didn't say a word.

269
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,570
Oh, no, maybe I should
just wipe myself

270
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,580
with some leafy little piece
of poison oak.

271
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,580
And then I could
spend the whole day

272
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,580
scratching my ass,
blending in with the natives.

273
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,580
Then you'd be back on my side.

274
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,590
You know, you really
don't have to bother

275
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,590
telling people
you're from New York.

276
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,590
What the hell is that?

277
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,590
What?

278
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,600
There. I thought
I saw something.

279
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Kelly:
Looks like a branch.

280
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Oh, my God.

281
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,610
Aah!

282
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,610
Hey.

283
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,610
You threw it at me!

284
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,610
I just let go of it.

285
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,620
You threw it at me!

286
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,620
Did you see that?
Oh!

287
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,620
Ma'am!

288
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,620
Stop hitting me.

289
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,620
Don't throw heads at me!

290
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,620
Stop calling me
"ma'am!"

291
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,630
Aw, Jesus.

292
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,630
Oh, God.

293
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,630
So, sheriff...

294
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,640
how many deputies you got?

295
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,650
What?

296
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,650
Could it be a bear?

297
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,650
I mean, the bears
get big here, right?

298
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,660
Hmm. I don't think a bear
could bite off a moose's head.

299
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,660
Everything you need
should be in there.

300
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
Ok. Good. Good.

301
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,670
So will we be
tent-mates then?

302
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,670
Nope.
This is all yours.

303
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,670
Ohh. Great.

304
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,670
Excellent.

305
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,670
If there's anything else
you need...

306
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,680
Uh, one thing
I wanted to ask you.

307
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Uh, what's it like to be a woman

308
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,680
in the woods of Maine?

309
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
I mean, the guys don't turn
all horny or anything

310
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,690
like they did in
deliverance, right?

311
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,690
Oh.

312
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,700
I knew you were there.

313
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,700
Hmm.

314
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Never been to Maine before, huh?

315
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,710
I have good hygiene.
I'm not welcome.

316
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,710
Why are you here, really?

317
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,710
I told you.

318
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,710
A museum doesn't send an
investigator into the woods--

319
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,710
How would you know

320
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,720
what a museum would
or would not do exactly?

321
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Well, even if they did,

322
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,720
I doubt whether he or she
would have problems with tents.

323
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
So I don't like tents.
Why--

324
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,730
Oh, you don't like tents,
and you don't like mosquitoes.

325
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,730
Well, nobody likes
mosquit--

326
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,730
Look at your fingernails.

327
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,730
What's wrong with my fingernails?

328
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,730
You have as much business
being in the woods

329
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,730
as Emily Post.

330
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,740
No, it doesn't make sense.

331
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,740
They sent you out here
to examine a tooth.

332
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,740
And what are you doing
out here on the lake?

333
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,750
Oh, no.

334
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,750
What?

335
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,760
If this is who I think it is...

336
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
It is.

337
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Who?

338
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Hector Cyr.

339
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,770
He's this rich, kook
mythology professor.

340
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,770
You know him?

341
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,780
He's done some work
with our museum.

342
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,780
He also treks the world to s...

343
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,780
What?

344
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,790
To swim with crocodiles.

345
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,790
Crocodiles?

346
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,790
If he's here,

347
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,800
he must think you've got one.

348
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Oh, look...

349
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
I admit I'm no brain scientist,

350
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,800
but I do know there's
no way a crocodile

351
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,810
can be in Maine, right?

352
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,810
You beat me!

353
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,820
Balls!

354
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
Splendid lake, eh?

355
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,820
Became a man on a lake like this.

356
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,820
Rubber raft.

357
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
Sylvia Blake.

358
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,830
She gave a like a cow.

359
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,830
Who do we have
from Fish and Game?

360
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,830
Me.

361
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,830
Who is this man?

362
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,830
I can see the algae blooms
Just coming in.

363
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,840
Look almost stagnant.

364
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Hector Cyr.

365
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Oh, the earth is round
and so should you be.

366
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Who is he?

367
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
I need topographic studies.
You got any?

368
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,850
You don't just fly in here
and start barking orders.

369
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,850
I apologize. I just don't
want to lose the light

370
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,850
when we got time
for a quick scout.

371
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,850
Have you had a little work done?

372
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,850
I have not.

373
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,850
Who are you?

374
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,860
Hector Cyr.
I said it once.

375
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,860
Let me know when it sinks in, ok?

376
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,860
Have you seen it?

377
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,860
No.

378
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,860
Excuse me.
You came here to...

379
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,870
help you find it.

380
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,870
A crocodile?

381
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,870
Yeah.

382
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,870
They've been migrating north,
you know?

383
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,870
This lake does connect
to the ocean.

384
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,880
It's not as farfetched
as it may sound.

385
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
Crocodiles can't swim
in saltwater.

386
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Yeah, well, that'll be
your little secret.

387
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,890
Come on.
We're losing time.

388
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,890
Why did the big one heckle me?

389
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,890
Hey, pal...

390
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,930
If he's close, we'll find him.

391
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,930
Their signatures
are unmistakable.

392
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,940
She tell you
that we had sex together?

393
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,940
So vigorous!

394
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,940
I never had sex with you.

395
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,950
Whew. I'm horrible in bed.
They never remember.

396
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,950
God.

397
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,950
Wait.

398
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,950
Stop!

399
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Thought I heard something.

400
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,960
I don't mean to be discourteous,

401
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
but, uh, how is it

402
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,970
a person could come to believe

403
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,970
a crocodile is in New England?

404
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,970
How could it survive winter?

405
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,970
Long as their nostrils
don't freeze,

406
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,980
they survive.

407
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,980
Am I foolish to explain things?

408
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,980
He had such trouble with my name.

409
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,980
- Hector.
- Hey.

410
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,980
Is this where it happened?

411
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,990
Around here.
Yeah.

412
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,990
We're a mile from the ocean.
Could've easily made it here.

413
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,990
Assuming he got
this far up the seaboard.

414
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,990
The big ones
have been on the move.

415
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,000
What have I been telling you?
You call me crazy.

416
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Kelly:
Hector, just paddle.

417
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You know, Sheriff,

418
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
when friends or family say things,

419
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
they tend not to register,

420
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,010
so sometimes it helps to hear it

421
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,010
from a total stranger.

422
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,010
You're fat.

423
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,010
Jesus. Hector!

424
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,020
Oh, yeah.

425
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,020
Kelly: What's that?

426
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,020
What is it?

427
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,020
White perch.

428
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,030
Are they feeding?

429
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,030
They aren't feeding.

430
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,030
They're scared.

431
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,030
-Aah!
-Aah!

432
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,030
Jesus!

433
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:41,040
Oh!

434
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,050
Get your legs out of the water.

435
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,050
Don't move your legs.

436
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,050
Are you kidding me?

437
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,060
Keep your legs still.

438
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,060
Get off.

439
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,060
Hector, to the left.

440
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,060
Move it left!

441
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,060
Paddle, paddle!

442
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,070
No one actually saw anything.

443
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,070
Yes, I realize that, sir,

444
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,070
but something flipped us over,

445
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,080
and I doubt very much
if it was a mink.

446
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,080
I am a paleontologist.

447
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
I work for
a natural history museum.

448
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
I am not some--

449
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,080
They don't believe her.

450
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Thank you.

451
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,090
It's so rewarding to
imagine my tax dollar

452
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,090
finding its way to you,
you fuck-shit!

453
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,090
You're a saucy flirt.

454
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,090
You were right.

455
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,100
U.S.Wildlife
won't send anybody

456
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
without a confirmation.

457
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,100
We don't need 'em.

458
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
Sheriff.

459
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Yeah?

460
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,110
Might wanna come
take a look at this.

461
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,110
Oh, my God.

462
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,110
Worms.

463
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,110
Oh, I got a thing about worms.

464
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,120
It's a human toe.

465
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Some decomposition,
a little acidic--

466
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,130
definitely been swallowed.

467
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,140
Is this the man who was killed?

468
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,140
He seemed taller.

469
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,140
Phew.

470
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,140
You got a croc, all right.

471
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,140
They're a keystone species.

472
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,150
Did he just explain something?

473
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,150
Keystone species effects
the whole ecosystem.

474
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,150
That would explain these worms

475
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,160
and those perch.

476
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,160
We got a crocodile.

477
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,170
Here's your friend.

478
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,190
Tom Jones:
It's not unusual.

479
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,190
To be loved by anyone

480
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,200
It's not unusual.

481
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,200
To have fun with anyone.

482
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
But when I see you hangin' around

483
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,210
With anyone.

484
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,210
It's not unusual...

485
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,210
He paid us.

486
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,210
500.

487
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,210
It's a trap.

488
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:59,220
You accepted money from him?

489
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,220
We took a check.

490
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,230
When I see you out and about.

491
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,230
Law enforcement
is very dangerous work,

492
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,230
isn't it?

493
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,230
And you have such
big, wonderful boobs.

494
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,240
Ha ha. Thank you.

495
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,240
It's not unusual.

496
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
It happens every day.

497
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,240
Hey!

498
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,250
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey!

499
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,250
You're on official business.

500
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,250
This is not a party.

501
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,250
Yeah, but now that you're here...

502
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,250
Whoo!

503
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,250
Yeah!

504
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,260
Quiet!

505
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,260
What's with digging the holes?

506
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,260
Well, crocodiles are--

507
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,270
are very brazen.

508
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,270
They like to come on land,

509
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,270
and of course
they're attracted to noise.

510
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,270
Everybody out!
Back to your tents!

511
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,280
Now!

512
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
Oh, could she stay?

513
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
We were...

514
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
we were hoping to mate.

515
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,280
No.

516
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,290
Out.

517
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,290
Now, you listen...

518
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,290
If it were up to me,
you'd be on your way home.

519
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,300
But I'm not in charge.

520
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,300
That's a shocker there.

521
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
I'm going to say this

522
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,300
because I believe in being
straight with people.

523
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,310
I think you are a mental.

524
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:13,310
Sheriff...

525
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,310
I appreciate your candor.
Really, I do.

526
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,320
I think it's always good to know

527
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,320
where somebody's coming from,

528
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
and, frankly,

529
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,320
your origins have been
a bit of a mystery to me.

530
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,350
Look how flat that water is.

531
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,360
You could get 10 skips
on a good one, easy.

532
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
Sorry?

533
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Skipping stones.

534
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Growing up,

535
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,370
I used to summer
At my grandparents' place

536
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,370
on a lake like this.

537
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,370
I'd skip stones all day.

538
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,370
Beat playing with the other kids.

539
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:07,380
I'm sure it did.

540
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,380
Look, I think it's best

541
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,390
if you stayed onshore a while.

542
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,390
I beg your pardon?

543
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,390
I'm not trying to pick a fight,

544
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,390
but whatever's out there
did flip a canoe.

545
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,400
I am not staying onshore.

546
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
It's dangerous.

547
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
No, I didn't fly up here
Just to roast marshmallows.

548
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Why did you fly up here?

549
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Look...

550
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,410
palaeontologists are not
sent to Maine

551
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,410
to hunt for crocodiles.

552
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,410
I was sent up here
to look at the tooth.

553
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,410
You looked at the tooth.

554
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:37,420
What are you doing out here?

555
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,420
I was dating my boss...

556
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,430
and he turned out to be
involved with a co worker

557
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,430
who was also my friend.

558
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,430
And for the sake
of comfort--theirs--

559
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,440
I was shipped off to Maine.

560
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,440
And I don't feel
like going back yet.

561
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,450
I'm not making it up.

562
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,450
Still, you don't
have to stay out here.

563
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,450
I mean, you can stay in town.

564
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,450
I've come. I'm here.
I'm staying...

565
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,460
unless there are ticks.

566
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,460
I know crocodiles.

567
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,460
And I won't get in your way.

568
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,470
I just really do want
to be a part of this.

569
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,470
7:00 A.M.?

570
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,480
Thank you.

571
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,490
Good night.

572
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,490
Thank you.

573
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,620
Jesus fucking Christ!

574
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,620
Ohh. What the hell
are you doing?

575
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,620
What the hell are you doing?!

576
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,620
Oh, Jesus.
You clowning around?

577
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,630
I'm laying a spring trap!

578
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,630
A spring trap?

579
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,630
I keep telling you
they can come on land.

580
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,630
I could've shot you.

581
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,630
This could end up
saving your life,

582
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,640
which is meaningful for you,

583
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,640
because the more you live,

584
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,640
the more sex you get to
have with your sister!

585
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,640
What's going on?

586
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,650
He's crawling around
like a cockroach here.

587
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,650
I don't care
how much money--

588
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,650
He's waving
his little wang around!

589
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,650
He's scaring the shit out of me!

590
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,650
How big is this?

591
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,650
All right, all right!

592
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,650
I'll say this once.

593
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,660
Your fancy equipment aside,

594
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,660
which we appreciate--

595
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,660
if you interfere, you're gone.

596
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,670
Simple as that.

597
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,680
How much of a wacko is this guy?

598
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Well...

599
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
the thing about Hector

600
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
is he takes this
crocodile business very...

601
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,690
Oh, man.

602
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,690
He thinks they're godly.

603
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,690
What was that?

604
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,690
In his defense,

605
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,690
every primitive culture
known to man deified them.

606
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,700
Ancient China, Egypt,
Australia, Asia.

607
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,700
Going back in history,

608
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,700
crocodiles have been
more worshiped than Jesus.

609
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,710
Is this supposed to make us

610
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,710
take him more seriously?

611
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,710
No, it's supposed to make you
understand him.

612
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,710
He's a mythology professor.

613
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,710
He believes
that they're divine conduits.

614
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,720
And he can find them,

615
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
so we should try
to put up with him.

616
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,720
He's a fruitcake.

617
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,730
We should get some sleep.

618
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,730
Yeah.

619
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,730
Aah!

620
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,730
Damn it!

621
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,730
And he's a good trapper.

622
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
We can expect a quick response

623
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
if he hears that.

624
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,770
Adult crocs will move
on distressed hatchlings.

625
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,770
Again, I don't mean to be annoying

626
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,770
with my questions

627
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,770
but if it is a crocodile,

628
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,780
which I don't think it is,

629
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,780
and they do charge these
baby hatchling sounds,

630
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,790
why would you want to be
underwater at the time?

631
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,790
With you, it makes sense.

632
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,790
You see, Sheriff, the thing is,

633
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,790
they don't really
attack underwater.

634
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,790
That Walt guy got hit underwater.

635
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,790
True. They don't see
that well underwater.

636
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,800
They have nictitating
lenses on their eyes...

637
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Burke, stop here.

638
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
- Now?
-Yeah.

639
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
...You dive underwater

640
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
and they probably won't
be able to see you.

641
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,810
I hate to interrupt
but we got work to do.

642
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,810
Hey, we can talk if we want.

643
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,810
Yeah, we can talk if we want.

644
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,820
Would you mind putting down
the anchor?

645
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,820
Wait till we're down there

646
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,820
before you turn that thing on.

647
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,830
Got it.

648
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,830
Let's go, Hector.

649
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,840
Good luck.

650
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,850
I brought a pork chop for luck.

651
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,850
Maybe you can hang it
around you neck.

652
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,850
That's sweet.

653
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,860
Maybe later you can chew the bark

654
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,860
off my big, fat log.

655
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,870
Was that, like,
a homosexual remark?

656
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,880
Don't ask me.

657
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,940
Could be a mental.

658
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,940
I heard if a mental person
is rich enough,

659
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
they just call him eccentric.

660
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,950
He's not mental.

661
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,950
He's seen every crocodile
in the world.

662
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,950
He even swam in the Grametti
with killer Niles.

663
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,950
He never got nipped.

664
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,960
And that's why he thinks
they're godly--

665
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
'Cause they don't bite him?

666
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
I don't know.

667
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
He said he knew it when
he looked in their eyes.

668
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,970
"Eyes of a Dragon."

669
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:59,050
So much for crocodiles.

670
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
It's probably on land.

671
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,070
Yeah, right.

672
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,070
What was that?

673
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:14,070
I don't know.

674
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,080
Aah!

675
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
Shit.

676
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Hey! Something's got
the anchor line!

677
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,080
Untie it!
Untie the line!

678
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
I'm trying!

679
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
Hurry!

680
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,090
Cut the line!

681
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,090
Right!

682
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,090
Shit!

683
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,100
Come on.

684
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
What happened?

685
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
I don't know.

686
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,100
Hurry. Hurry up.

687
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:44,110
Must've just let go.

688
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,120
Come on.

689
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
Shit! Hurry!

690
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,120
Hank!

691
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,130
Ok!

692
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,140
Oh!

693
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:15,150
Hurry!

694
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,150
Hurry.

695
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,160
My God, it's right under you!

696
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,170
Aah! Oh, Christ.

697
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,170
Come on, get in the boat.

698
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,170
You all right?

699
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,170
Yeah.

700
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,170
Where's Hector?

701
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,170
I lost track.

702
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:39,180
We went different directions.

703
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,190
There's some bubbles over there.

704
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
Pull it up.

705
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,210
All right. Come on.
Bring him aboard.

706
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,210
What's happened?

707
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,210
Come on.

708
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,210
You see it?
How big is it?

709
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,220
Shut up and get on board.

710
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,220
We lost track of it.
Burke, pull up the speaker!

711
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,220
Are you all right?

712
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
-Grab him!
-Aah!

713
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,240
Pull him in!

714
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,250
Aah! Aah!

715
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,250
That it?

716
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,250
Yeah.

717
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,260
Nobody actually saw it.
It happened suddenly.

718
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,260
Didn't get caught in the outboard?

719
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,270
It wasn't the outboard.

720
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:56,280
Tell them to get here fast, huh?

721
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,280
You ok?

722
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,290
Kelly?

723
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,290
Yeah.

724
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,290
Nobody saw anything.

725
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:12,300
No.

726
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
U.S.Wildlife's
on their way.

727
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,300
The police want to keep
everything quiet

728
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,310
so the press doesn't
get wind of anything.

729
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,310
Everybody just wants us to...

730
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:26,320
"Sit tight"

731
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,330
Are you...ok?

732
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,330
Well...

733
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:39,330
you know...

734
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:43,340
Yeah.

735
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,350
Well, Sheriff, I'm, uh...

736
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:52,350
Very sorry about your deputy.

737
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,350
He was a good man?

738
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:59,360
Yep.

739
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,360
Whenever somebody dies, I...

740
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,360
I always think
that it's such a waste

741
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,370
that I didn't know them
any better.

742
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:10,370
Sorry for your loss, Hector.

743
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:14,380
Not really what I meant.

744
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,380
Head was just...

745
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,390
bitten off.

746
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,390
You know, I used to have
a recurring nightmare

747
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,390
that I was headless.

748
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,390
I'd be down on the ground

749
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,400
looking up at my body, no head,

750
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,400
just walking around
bumping into everything.

751
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
And my parents...

752
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,410
wouldn't let me in the house.

753
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,410
Because they just bought
all these antique lamps,

754
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,410
and they didn't want me
to knock them over,

755
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,410
the fuckers.

756
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,410
Then the neighborhood bullies,

757
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,420
they'd see my round
head on the ground

758
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,420
looking like a ball,

759
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,420
and they'd come over,

760
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,420
and they'd start a soccer game.

761
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
And as I was being kicked around,

762
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,430
I'd actually just feel grateful

763
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:56,430
for being allowed in the game.

764
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,440
What are--
What are your thoughts?

765
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,440
You know, Hector...

766
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,440
I'm sure you're a fine person

767
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,450
in your own mental way,

768
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,450
but I think it would be best

769
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:12,450
if you and I didn't speak.

770
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,460
Yaaah!

771
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,460
When is U.S.Wildlife
getting here?

772
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,460
I'm still waiting
to confirm if they...

773
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,470
Oh, Jesus.

774
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,470
I--I could probably
cut him down,

775
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,480
but there's this
odd look of mayhem

776
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,480
on his
upside-down face.

777
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
Hank.

778
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,480
Yes?

779
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,490
Are you all right?

780
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,490
Could you cut me down?

781
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,490
Do you promise

782
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,490
that you won't attempt
to injure me?

783
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,500
I have no interest in ever
looking at you, Hector.

784
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Ok.

785
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
Just, uh, pull him down.

786
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,510
It's a counterweight.

787
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,510
Here. I'll get the knife.

788
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,510
If I'd remembered it was there,

789
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,510
I never would've let
you walk that way.

790
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,520
All right. It's over.

791
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,520
It's over. Remember?

792
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,520
You promised
not to hurt him, so...

793
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
I lied.

794
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,520
Wait. Hey! Hey!

795
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,530
Come on! Hold up!

796
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,530
Nowhere to go, my friend.

797
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,530
Now, just--come on!
Knock it off.

798
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,530
Knock it off.
Put that down.

799
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,530
Just settle...

800
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,540
Jesus! Look out!

801
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,550
Whoa!

802
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,560
Aw, shit!

803
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,590
Ok.

804
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,590
I admit it.

805
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,590
It's a crocodile.

806
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,590
Kelly: He's an Indo-Pacific.

807
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,600
Scales were oval.
He's an Asian crocodile.

808
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,600
Why would he come here?
It's impossible.

809
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
Asia.
How would he get here?

810
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,610
Obviously some
asshole in Hong Kong

811
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,610
flushed him down the toilet.

812
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:17,610
He was 30 feet, right?
Had to be.

813
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:20,610
Well, now maybe somebody's
happy I brought my big gun.

814
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,620
Oh you're gonna
blow him away now?

815
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,620
I should think so.

816
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,620
With your cannon?

817
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,620
Right.
What, I shouldn't?

818
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,620
Well, he's a miracle of nature,

819
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,620
but I know he's very scary.

820
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,630
You're the miracle of nature.

821
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,630
Guys, guys, easy.

822
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,630
We're not gonna do
anything tonight.

823
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,640
I never heard of a crocodile
crossing an ocean.

824
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,640
Well, they conceal information

825
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,640
like that in books.

826
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,640
All right, pal!

827
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,640
Hey, hey, hey.

828
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,650
No, no.
Let him go.

829
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,650
I'm sick of him, too.

830
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,650
I do need to warn you, Sheriff.

831
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,650
The thing about being rich,

832
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,650
my parents did have
the added luxury

833
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:51,650
of ditching me off
at karate school

834
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,660
on a regular basis,
so I am a brown belt.

835
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,660
Go ahead.
Take your best shot.

836
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,660
Ohh!

837
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,660
Hank!

838
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,660
He said he knew karate.

839
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,670
You hit him.

840
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,670
I did, yeah.

841
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,670
Here.

842
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,670
Did he say "go"?

843
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,680
Aren't you supposed
to say "go" in karate?

844
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,680
You're supposed
to say "go."

845
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,680
Hank, just keep your
distance from him.

846
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,690
Go to your tent.
Cool down.

847
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,690
He doesn't answer my questions?

848
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,690
Why don't you answer my questions?

849
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:21,690
I fall into a hole.

850
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,690
I go up in a tree.

851
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:24,700
I swear to God,
I'll say "go."

852
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,700
You bow,
and then you say "go."

853
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,700
As in
"go fuck yourself."

854
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,700
Jesus. They're just
like children.

855
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,700
Yeah.

856
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,700
Oh, my God.

857
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,710
Are you all right?

858
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,710
Yeah, I'm all right.

859
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:37,710
I've got something for that.

860
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,710
I can fix that.

861
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,710
Yeah?

862
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:40,720
Yeah.

863
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,720
Ohh!

864
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,720
I just gotta pull it
a little tighter.

865
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,720
There we go.

866
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,730
Who taught you to be a nurse?

867
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:49,730
Father's a surgeon.

868
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,730
I can even stitch in a pinch,

869
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:53,730
which probably wouldn't
be such a bad idea.

870
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,730
Uh, no, thanks.

871
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:57,740
Ok.

872
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:00,740
You should have seen
the look on your face

873
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,740
when that croc jumped out.

874
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,750
Uh-huh.

875
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,750
You see the look on the bear?

876
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:10,750
That was the look.

877
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,760
I don't know.

878
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,760
The laws of nature
could be changing, Jack.

879
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,760
That thing out there,
that's--

880
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,760
You're having the best time
of your life, aren't you?

881
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,770
What?

882
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:22,770
What? People
have been killed.

883
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,770
I hardly think I'm
having a good time.

884
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:29,780
Why would you--

885
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:33,780
Does it show?

886
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:39,790
This is the first time
I've ever actually...

887
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,790
you know, been in
the middle of anything.

888
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:43,790
Is that why you're here,

889
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:47,800
to get in the middle
of something?

890
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,810
Maybe.

891
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,810
I've always read
about what's happened.

892
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:58,810
I've never...

893
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,820
We should go to bed.

894
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,830
I mean we should go to, uh...

895
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:08,830
rest.

896
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,830
We should go to our
separate tents,

897
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:14,830
and--here--
get some--go.

898
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:18,840
I got it.

899
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,850
Thanks for the bandage.

900
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,850
Night.

901
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:31,860
Yeah.

902
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:44,870
It doesn't even see him.

903
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:49,880
There, he got it.

904
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,880
He has one natural enemy.

905
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,890
Only one.

906
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:55,890
Man?

907
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:58,890
Man.

908
00:47:58,890 --> 00:47:59,890
So you're the big expert.

909
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,900
You think ours is some
kind of mutant or---

910
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,900
Not necessarily.
There's a 30-footer in India.

911
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,900
Biggest one ever killed
on record was 27 feet.

912
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,910
So why is he here?

913
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:15,910
Honestly...

914
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:21,920
I don't know.

915
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,950
Keep your eyes peeled.

916
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,950
You know how fast
these things can be.

917
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,950
I've got ticks, I know it.

918
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:49,960
They're just so drawn to me.

919
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,960
I got a thing about ticks.

920
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,960
Crawling up your pant leg.

921
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,960
Putt heir heads under your skin.

922
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,970
Look.

923
00:48:58,970 --> 00:48:59,970
What?

924
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,970
Jack.

925
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,980
That's a pretty big print.

926
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:20,990
Seems like
we're getting lower.

927
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:23,000
That's what happens when I land.

928
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Why are we landing?

929
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Because this is the cove
that he obviously lives in.

930
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,010
So why are we landing?

931
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:36,010
Hector!

932
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,020
We can lift it?

933
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,030
Maybe.

934
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,030
Don't want to mush it there.

935
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,030
I'm not mushing it.

936
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,030
You might mush it.
It's a little soft.

937
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:55,040
For Christ's sake,
I'm not mushing it!

938
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:01,040
Aah!

939
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,050
Oh, God.

940
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:05,050
Ok.

941
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,050
That is it!
That is it!

942
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:10,060
No, no, I keep
getting hit with heads!

943
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,060
Try to calm down.

944
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,060
You calm down!

945
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,060
Calm down, ok?
Just keep breathing.

946
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,070
I'm being very calm!
I am composed!

947
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,070
This is the second time.

948
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:20,070
I've been hit
with a severed head,

949
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,070
and it upsets me!

950
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:27,080
What the hell?

951
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,080
Aah!

952
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,090
I...

953
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:36,090
I just want to go back
to my tent now.

954
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:39,090
Can we please go back?

955
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:41,100
You gotta be kidding.

956
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,100
I'm not kidding!

957
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,100
Look.

958
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,100
The itsy-bitsy spider.

959
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,100
Crawled up the water spout.

960
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,110
Down comes the rain.

961
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:54,110
To wash the spider out.

962
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,120
Kelly: What is she doing?

963
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,120
Dum de dum de dum.

964
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,120
Kelly: Oh.

965
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,130
What?

966
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,130
Look 10 feet into the water.

967
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,140
Come and get it!

968
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,160
Wow.

969
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,160
Disgusting.

970
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,170
I haven't broken any laws.

971
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,170
Oh, but you have, ma'am.

972
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,170
You lied to us.

973
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,170
That can be
obstruction of justice.

974
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,170
A man has been killed,

975
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:42,170
in part because of your silence.

976
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,170
I could make out a charge

977
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,180
of reckless endangerment.

978
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,180
And I'm sure PETA
would be annoyed

979
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,180
at how you treat your cows.

980
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,180
The reason I lied,
if I told you the truth,

981
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,180
you'd hunt it down and kill it,

982
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,190
which seems to be exactly
what you're trying to do.

983
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,190
How long have you
been feeding this thing?

984
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,190
6 years.

985
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,190
6 years?

986
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:02,200
Well, Bernie was out fishing,

987
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,200
and it followed him home.

988
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,200
So we threw it some scraps,

989
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,210
and, well, he didn't
seem to bother anybody.

990
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:11,210
He became kind of like a pet
who lives in the wild.

991
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:12,210
He just appeared?

992
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,210
You have no idea
how he arrived here?

993
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,220
No. Do you?

994
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,220
Your husband Bernie,

995
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,220
you didn't, by any chance,

996
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,220
lead him to the lake blindfolded?

997
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,220
If I had a dick,

998
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,230
this is where I'd
tell you to suck it.

999
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,230
Did the crocodile
kill your husband?

1000
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:30,230
Yes, but it was all...

1001
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,240
it was a mistake.

1002
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,240
A mistake?

1003
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,240
One of our horses
got loose 2 years ago.

1004
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,240
Went to the lake to drink,

1005
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,250
and the crocodile
started coming in,

1006
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,250
and Bernie went
to intercede, and--

1007
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,250
if I'd reported it,

1008
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:47,260
they'd have sent people
to kill it.

1009
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,260
Ma'am, how could you
not report this?

1010
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,260
It puts human life at risk.

1011
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,260
Nobody lives on this lake.

1012
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:56,270
It's really his lake now.

1013
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,270
Come on, Hector.
I know you're crazy,

1014
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,270
but you can't do this.

1015
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,270
I need to see his habitat
up close, Deputy Gare.

1016
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:04,280
Then watch Nova, ok?

1017
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,280
But don't go in the water.

1018
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,280
Please.

1019
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,280
I'll have sex with you.

1020
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,290
Let's just get out of here.

1021
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,290
Darling,

1022
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:16,290
he's not gonna hurt me.

1023
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:20,300
Don't.

1024
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:30,310
Hector!

1025
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,310
Murders and rapes in the cities.

1026
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,320
People bomb planes.

1027
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,320
Can the police stop them?
No.

1028
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,320
But feed one little cow
to a crocodile--

1029
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,320
You stay right here
until the police show.

1030
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,330
You're under full house arrest.

1031
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,330
Thank you...

1032
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,330
Officer Fuckmeat.

1033
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:48,330
Sheriff,
we got a problem with Hector.

1034
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,340
What problem?

1035
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:54,340
He went swimming.

1036
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:58,350
Check.

1037
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,430
Oh, my.

1038
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,450
Suddenly I feel
a bit foolish here.

1039
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:21,450
You're different from the others.

1040
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:26,460
Holy Spirit of Sobek.

1041
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,460
Holy Ghost.

1042
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:30,460
Holy shit.

1043
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,460
Hector!

1044
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,470
Just turn the ignition.

1045
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:39,470
It's fuel injected.

1046
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,480
Come on!

1047
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,480
I know that under
the circumstances,

1048
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,490
biting my head off

1049
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:50,490
might seem viable.

1050
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:54,490
It would cheapen you.

1051
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,500
I may get a shot!

1052
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,500
No!

1053
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Bullets might not
penetrate its hide.

1054
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,500
Oh, Jesus. All right,
just a little further.

1055
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,510
Just like that.

1056
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:24,530
Move over!

1057
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:29,540
Go!

1058
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:33,540
-Go!
- I'm trying!

1059
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,550
Ahh! Jesus!

1060
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:03,580
That's your last little
stunt, Mr. Crocodile.

1061
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,580
You're grounded.

1062
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,590
This is some very
delicate equipment

1063
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:07,590
that you're throwing around.

1064
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,590
I don't care.
You trying to kill your self.

1065
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,590
You want to meet
Your maker, is that it?

1066
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:12,590
You might think they're godly,

1067
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,600
you might get some spiritual lift

1068
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,600
out of backstroking with dragons,

1069
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,600
but you just put a deputy
at risk out there, sir.

1070
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,600
Let's not overlook the fact
that he didn't eat me.

1071
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,610
'Cause he just ate a cow, stupid.

1072
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,610
I'm a civilian.
I'm not a trout.

1073
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,610
You have no authority
over me whatsoever.

1074
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,610
You have no authority
over me whatsoever.

1075
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:29,610
Hey, hey, I can arrest you.

1076
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,620
Well, then do it.

1077
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,620
You hurt his feelings.

1078
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,620
I don't care.
Do you care?

1079
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,630
No. He's an asshole.

1080
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,650
Did you want to be killed by it?

1081
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,650
You think I'm that nuts?

1082
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,650
Hector.

1083
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,650
What you just did,

1084
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:03,660
there had to be at least some
sort of a death wish going on.

1085
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,660
In ancient Melanesia,

1086
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,660
people suspected of crimes

1087
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:10,670
would be thrown
to the crocodiles.

1088
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:11,670
Crocodiles would decide.

1089
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:13,670
They would be the judge.

1090
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:17,680
Oh, and so that was you
wanting to be judged out there?

1091
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,680
Maybe I was, and so what?

1092
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,680
Is that too arbitrary?

1093
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,680
Better to be measured by my wealth?

1094
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,690
Better for me
to get my self-esteem

1095
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,690
looking in the eyes
of cheap sycophants

1096
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:29,690
craving a meal ticket?

1097
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:31,690
There was more honesty
in those dragon's eyes.

1098
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:33,700
There was more dignity
in those dragon's eyes.

1099
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,700
Jesus, Hector, cut the shit.

1100
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,700
Aw, fuck it.

1101
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:40,700
So, can I tell them you won't
go back in the water?

1102
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,710
Oh, yeah, sure.

1103
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:42,710
I'm not going back in the water.

1104
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,710
No way I'm going
back in the water.

1105
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:46,710
Ok.

1106
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:50,720
Kelly.

1107
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,720
We can't let 'em kill it.

1108
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,740
Yeah,
pull all the trucks in

1109
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,740
and start packing.

1110
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:08,740
Everything?

1111
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,740
Yeah.

1112
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,740
All right.

1113
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,750
Just heard from Wildlife
and Florida Fish and Game.

1114
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,750
They're gonna be here in 3 hours.

1115
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,750
Ok.

1116
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,750
So we might as well pack up.

1117
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:20,760
Good idea.

1118
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,760
Will they try to trap him?

1119
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,760
Sorry?

1120
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,760
Florida Fish and Game.

1121
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,770
What'll they do
when they get here?

1122
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:32,770
Tell her, Jack.

1123
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,770
Won't be able to snag him
in pitments, right?

1124
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,780
And you tranq him in the water,

1125
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:38,780
and he drowns.

1126
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,780
They could try
to tranq him on land.

1127
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,780
Oh, sure, they could,
but they won't.

1128
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,780
He's taken human life.

1129
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,790
The mission will be
to put him down.

1130
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,790
Is that true?

1131
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:50,790
They've never been able
to trap anything 30 feet.

1132
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:52,800
But they have to try, right?

1133
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,800
Where are they gonna
take him, Florida?

1134
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,800
Back to Asia?

1135
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,800
I got enough flaxidyl
with me to put him out--

1136
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,800
Forget it.

1137
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,810
Jack, hear me out.

1138
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:02,810
I know I'm a fat,
rich, nut fuck, wacko

1139
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,810
who's about as grounded
as a street pigeon,

1140
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,810
Keep going.

1141
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,820
But this thing...

1142
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,820
Here?

1143
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,820
Maine?

1144
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,820
30 feet?

1145
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,830
Don't you think we're dealing

1146
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:18,830
with a bit of a miracle?

1147
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:20,830
Yeah. The miracle would be
to take him alive.

1148
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,830
Yeah, but if we could
neutralize him--

1149
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:23,840
How are we gonna neutralize him?

1150
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,840
Lure him on land
and pump him full of drugs.

1151
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,840
Oh, right.

1152
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,840
I know of an empty
oil tank in Portland.

1153
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,840
If we drugged him, we
could contain him there.

1154
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,850
He's 150 years old.

1155
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:36,850
He probably swam here
from another continent.

1156
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:38,850
He's migrated to Maine.

1157
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:41,860
How the hell do we say
we just kill it?

1158
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,860
Jack, this thing being here

1159
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:45,860
does have some
ecological significance.

1160
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,870
And you are in the business

1161
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:49,870
of protecting things
against extinction.

1162
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:51,870
Including deputies.

1163
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:52,870
I understand that,

1164
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:54,870
but if it's possible
to take him alive--

1165
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:55,880
No, it's not possible.

1166
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,880
Look, he follows anything
that moves, right?

1167
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,880
We set a trap on the beach.
I got enough net--

1168
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,880
No. There's no net
that's gonna hold him.

1169
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,890
It'll keep him
tangled long enough

1170
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,890
for the drugs to kick in.

1171
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:06,890
For God's sake, Jack,

1172
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:08,890
they've trapped crocs
bigger than 20 feet.

1173
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:11,900
This is not completely
out of the question.

1174
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,900
It's possible, and you know that.

1175
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,900
And those fucks from
Florida won't even try,

1176
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,900
and you know that, too.

1177
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,910
I got the drugs.
He's got a big cannon

1178
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,910
if anything goes wrong.

1179
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:24,910
How do you get him to the net?

1180
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,910
Ask Mrs. Bickerman
to call him?

1181
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:27,920
You guys can be in the trucks

1182
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,920
with the tranq guns.

1183
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,920
If he charges, you take off.

1184
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,920
He's not that fast.

1185
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,930
We just have to try.

1186
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:39,930
One try.
Just one try.

1187
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:41,930
Like Hank says,

1188
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:44,940
how would we lure him in?

1189
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,940
I'll sue you!

1190
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:47,940
Go ahead.

1191
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,950
You can't take a cow
by eminent domain!

1192
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:52,950
We just did!

1193
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,950
We won't let her get hurt, ma'am.

1194
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:57,950
You're all cock suckers!

1195
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,960
I knew at first.
I just didn't want to say it.

1196
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,960
We know what we're doing.

1197
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,970
We got a cow hanging
from a helicopter.

1198
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:09,970
Not much drag.

1199
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:13,980
As long as I can keep her
from swinging, we're ok.

1200
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,990
We're doing the right thing.

1201
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,990
You might feel different
if you get eaten.

1202
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,990
Yeah, thanks.

1203
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:42,010
Tranq gun with every rifle.

1204
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:46,020
That's as far back
as it goes, right?

1205
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:56,030
Hector, keep enough
tension to hold her up.

1206
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:58,030
We don't know
how well she can swim.

1207
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:02,040
Right.

1208
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,040
I hate to say it.

1209
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,050
The more she thrashes,
the better.

1210
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:14,050
You ready
on shore?

1211
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:16,050
Yeah,
we're all right. We're ready.

1212
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:20,060
Ok.

1213
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:24,060
If she gets tired, pull her out.

1214
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:27,070
Jack:
What's she doing now?

1215
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:31,070
She's trying to fly.

1216
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:35,080
This is not a happy cow.

1217
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,080
I'm rooting for the crocodile.

1218
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,080
I hope he swallows
Your friends whole.

1219
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,090
You might want to arrest
me for that, too.

1220
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:44,090
Is that a crime--

1221
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:47,090
To wish the chewing
of law enforcement?

1222
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:50,100
I'm not sure, ma'am.

1223
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,100
You got 'em?

1224
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,100
Yeah, over here.

1225
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,100
Little battery!

1226
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,110
What's the deal?

1227
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:00,110
Well, we tried.

1228
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:03,110
Just a little longer, please.

1229
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:05,120
She doesn't seem to be swimming.

1230
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,120
No, she's floating.

1231
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,120
She looks like a giant tea bag.

1232
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,120
Ok, Hector.

1233
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,130
Good plan, bad bait.
Game's up.

1234
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:17,130
The cow disappoints me.

1235
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:21,140
Hold on.

1236
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,140
I got something on the screen.

1237
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,140
What do you got?

1238
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,140
He's coming.

1239
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,140
Where?

1240
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,140
How far out?

1241
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,150
30 meters or so.

1242
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:32,150
He's moving slow,
but he's definitely coming.

1243
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:35,150
Can you confirm visually
or just radar?

1244
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:36,150
Radar.

1245
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,160
He's underwater,

1246
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,160
but he is coming!

1247
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,160
All right, everybody
back in the trucks!

1248
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,160
Move, move, move!

1249
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,160
Let's go, let's go!

1250
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,170
Let's go!

1251
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:46,170
Lead him in.

1252
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:50,170
On our way.

1253
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,180
Remember to aim
for the stomach and the sides!

1254
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:01,190
These darts
won't pierce his back!

1255
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:04,190
He's surfacing.
There's his snout.

1256
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:06,190
There he is!

1257
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:08,190
We've spotted him, Hector.

1258
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:11,200
You little snacker.

1259
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,200
If he gets near her, pull up.

1260
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,200
She's worried about the cow now.

1261
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:19,210
Nice and slow, Hector.

1262
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,210
This net thing better work.

1263
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:24,220
He got you with it.

1264
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:29,220
We're in about 4 feet
of water now.

1265
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,230
She's mooing.

1266
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:34,230
You wouldn't?

1267
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,230
She's also kicking.

1268
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,230
A little closer, Hector.

1269
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:53,250
Oh, shit.

1270
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,260
Watch out!

1271
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:09,270
Motherfucker!

1272
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:12,280
Shit!

1273
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,280
Where is he?

1274
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,280
We gotta get to him.

1275
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,290
Back us up.

1276
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:22,290
Lose the tranq guns.
Go to the rifles.

1277
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:24,290
Get the rifles!

1278
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,320
Where'd he go?

1279
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,320
Hold up.

1280
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,320
Don't go back into the water.

1281
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,320
If you get a safe shot, take it.

1282
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:53,330
Do not move, Hector!

1283
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:58,330
Can you see anything
from out there?

1284
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:00,340
Nothing!

1285
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:04,340
Maybe he swam back out!

1286
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:07,350
Jesus!

1287
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:09,350
Hector!

1288
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:10,350
Hey!

1289
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:11,350
Get back in the truck!

1290
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:15,360
I got him covered.

1291
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,360
Where is he?

1292
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,370
I don't know.

1293
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:26,370
He's gone under.

1294
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:37,380
I just have this feeling
everything's totally safe.

1295
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:43,390
There!

1296
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:44,390
He's swimming out!

1297
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:45,390
I think I see him!

1298
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:49,400
I think I see his tail!

1299
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,420
Shit! Kelly!

1300
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,420
Aah!

1301
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,450
Kelly!

1302
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,460
Kelly, swim, swim to me!

1303
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:40,460
Swim to me, Kelly!

1304
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:43,470
Shoot the fucking thing!

1305
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:47,470
I don't have a clean shot.

1306
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:49,480
Dive under!

1307
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:53,480
Go under!

1308
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:58,490
Fuck.

1309
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:18,510
"Let's save him."

1310
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:22,520
What a fucking great idea.

1311
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:50,550
Come on.

1312
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:51,560
Here.

1313
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,560
Here we go.

1314
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,560
Where is he?

1315
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,560
I don't know.

1316
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,560
We can't see him.

1317
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,570
What-What?

1318
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:11,580
Hector!

1319
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,600
All right.

1320
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,600
Game over.

1321
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,600
Look.

1322
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,610
He's suffering.

1323
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,610
I get to be humane.

1324
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,610
No, no!

1325
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:38,610
No, no, no, look, he's trapped!

1326
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:41,620
We've done it!

1327
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:43,620
So what? It's not a net,
but he's trapped.

1328
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,620
Mission accomplished.

1329
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:46,620
Shoot him.

1330
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:47,630
I got more drugs.
He's half dead.

1331
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:51,630
He's half alive.
Shoot him!

1332
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:07,650
The drugs are kicking in.

1333
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,680
Look at him.

1334
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,680
He's done.

1335
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,690
Hank.

1336
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,690
All right, stand back.

1337
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,690
No, no, no, Sheriff.

1338
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:40,690
Look.

1339
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:42,700
Look, look.

1340
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:43,700
He's got nothing left.

1341
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:47,700
Go ahead.
Shoot him.

1342
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:55,710
Really?

1343
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:56,710
-Jack, we don't--
- Kelly.

1344
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:58,710
We don't have to destroy him!

1345
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:02,720
God damn it, look at him!

1346
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,730
Let me have that.

1347
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:07,730
Kelly:
He's been neutralized.

1348
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:09,730
Come on, Jack,
he's trapped!

1349
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:10,730
Look at him!
He can't move!

1350
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:11,730
What's the point?

1351
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:12,730
We don't have to do this.

1352
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:16,740
Jack, you don't have to.
Please!

1353
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,760
Oh, God!

1354
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,760
He's got me!

1355
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,760
Jesus!

1356
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,760
Jesus Christ!

1357
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,770
Are there 2?
I think there's 2.

1358
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:41,770
I can see that.

1359
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:42,770
He bit me!

1360
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:44,770
He bit me!
There's 2,there's 2!

1361
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:48,780
I can count.

1362
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:52,780
No!

1363
01:12:56,790 --> 01:13:00,790
Back to one.

1364
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,800
Go ahead.

1365
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,800
Flax him.

1366
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:16,810
Oh, here they are.

1367
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:20,820
Just in time.
Nice to see you.

1368
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:29,830
We're gonna need
to get this reptile

1369
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:31,830
some medical attention.

1370
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:33,840
We, uh...

1371
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,840
trapped him with our chopper.

1372
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:53,860
Portland?

1373
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:54,860
Yes, Portland.

1374
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,870
They'll tank him there
until we figure out

1375
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:58,870
something better to do.

1376
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:00,870
So, Sheriff, Sheriff,

1377
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,870
you got to fire
your big gun finally.

1378
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:03,880
Was it fun?

1379
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,880
Overrated.

1380
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,880
What'd Bickerman say?

1381
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,880
Well, she didn't want to tell us

1382
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,890
about the second croc,

1383
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:13,890
'cause she was afraid
we'd blow its head off.

1384
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:17,890
Women's intuition.

1385
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:18,890
We got room for one more.

1386
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:20,900
Someone should
probably go with him.

1387
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:21,900
Uh...

1388
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,900
I'm still packing up some stuff,

1389
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:27,910
but, uh...

1390
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:29,910
I'll go.

1391
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:31,910
So, I imagine you're gonna have

1392
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:34,910
a few reports to do.

1393
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:36,920
If you need anything, let me know.

1394
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:40,920
Yeah. It was nice meeting you.

1395
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:44,930
Gee, Hank,
don't get all choked up.

1396
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:46,930
With you, I'm still mixed.

1397
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:50,930
Oh, well, then, just to
offend you on principle, then.

1398
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:56,940
See you.

1399
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:04,950
Well...

1400
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,950
You want a ride in my truck?

1401
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:07,960
Oh, we just finished

1402
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,960
loading up the front oft he truck.

1403
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,960
Do you want us to
take some stuff out?

1404
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,960
No, no, that's all right.

1405
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,960
I'm gonna be
a little while anyway.

1406
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,970
I want to go say
good-bye to the lake.

1407
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,970
You sure, because
I don't mind--

1408
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:21,970
No. I actually want
to stay a little longer.

1409
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:26,980
All right.

1410
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,980
If I'm ever in New York, I'll...

1411
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:33,990
Yeah.

1412
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:40,000
Yeah.

1413
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:59,020
So, does nobody ever
make a move in Maine?

1414
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,030
That's it?
You slide your duffel bag?

1415
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:06,030
Just...

1416
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:07,030
get in the truck.

1417
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:09,030
Go for a beer.

1418
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,040
There's a good bar in town.

1419
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,040
Bet that's charming.

1420
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,040
Are the glasses clean?

1421
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,040
Mostly.

1422
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,050
You gonna complain
the whole time?

1423
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:20,050
Jack.

1424
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:24,050
Start the truck.

1425
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:32,060
I already miss the crocodile.

1426
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,120
Cute little buttons.
Oh, ho ho.

1427
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,130
Oh, mama loves you.

1428
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:23,130
Come on.

1429
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:25,130
Eat your supper.

1430
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:27,130
Nibble mommy's toes.

1431
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:28,130
Yes.
