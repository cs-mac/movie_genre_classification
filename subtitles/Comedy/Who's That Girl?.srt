Allow us to help you miss.

8
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:27,819
Okay, remember, it's fragile so be careful with it.

00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,149
Where will l bring this?

10
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:30,249
At my unit.

11
00:01:30,482 --> 00:01:31,015

15
00:01:40,082 --> 00:01:40,082
That's right! My muscles can handle it.

16
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:45,819

17
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:47,149
Wait.

18
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:49,083

00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:21,783
l can stay on any floor in this building.

25
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:23,916
We could even be neighbors if you like.

26
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:30,420
lf it's okay with you l could ask my uncle to buy
this condo for you.

27
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:30,649
Uncle? l thought it's your grandfather?

28
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:37,554
Right! Elders doesn't want to be called
grandfather.

29
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:37,816
Who's living with you in your condo?

30
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:40,850
The whole family is with me.

31
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:41,115
Hey what are you doing there?

32
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:44,883
Your nanny?

33
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:46,082
What nanny?

34
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:46,382
l just want to invite you for snacks.

35
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:48,649
That's a rotten excuse! If l know, you really
wanted to come up here and court us!

36
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:52,182
That's not true...

37
00:02:53,783 --> 00:02:53,783
Wow plenty of boys!

38
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:57,284
Not you, her only. Come on let's go.

39
00:02:58,549 --> 00:02:58,549
lf you need assistance it's Johnny B.

40
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:02,050
Okay, Thank you.

41
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:02,215
- Let's go.
- What are you doing there?

42
00:03:05,582 --> 00:03:05,582
You're overacting, l only asked you to cary one.

43
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:09,516
We did the rest back and fourth.

44
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:11,616
Only one?

45
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:16,153
Yes, It's only one! But It's refrigerator!

46
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:16,582
The elevator got stucked on the 27th floor,

47
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:20,482
so l just carried it off all by myself until 38th floor.

48
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:22,649
- Now tell me, l'm just acting?
- You complain a lot.

49
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:25,649
l complain a lot?

50
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:26,382
- Where did my family go?
- Try carying that refrigerator!

51
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:28,249
Have l known you have friends who could have
helped me,

52
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:30,482
l wouldn't have carried it all by myself.

53
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:32,315
Where did my family go?

54
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:33,549
- Why aren't they helping me?
- l'm always having a hard time.

55
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:35,082
lt's a Iways me! Me! Me! Next time...

56
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:36,849
After this l won't cary anything, not even a
single cube of ice!

57
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:41,716
Mark my words!

58
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:43,583
Remember that!

59
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,484
Mom! Dad!

60
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:55,285

61
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:56,315

62
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:01,549

63
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:02,483

65
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:08,620
You're all supposed to be helping me move here!

66
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:09,049
You already passed through my things,

67
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:13,218
yet came straight up here without even bringing
them in.

68
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:15,317
Don't be a killjoy!

69
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:15,516
We don't have plans to go swimming but the pool
invited us to take a dip,

70
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:29,852
so we gave it a try.

71
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:30,049
That's right sister. Look at us!

72
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:32,282
- We're not even prepared!
- Correct!

73
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:38,686
ln that condition, it's a scay thought being all
prepared.

74
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:42,118
Come on daughter, join us! Come on!

75
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:44,583
Macmac, that's enough.

76
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:52,283
Sorry, l'm late.

77
00:05:52,683 --> 00:05:53,417

81

00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:16,549
l have something for you which l'm sure you'll
treat me for lunch.

85
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:20,249
Treat again? Just a cup of rice and you're ready
to explode.

86
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:23,549
You're so mean!

87
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:25,115

Yes, 7 years in college, that's right! Something
wrong with that?

95

00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:49,152
Oh my! Hey, hey, hey... Elizabeth!

168
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:51,484
Did you get the ball, Elizabeth?

169
00:09:56,082 --> 00:09:56,082
Excuse me waiter!

170
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:59,383
One more glass please!

171
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:02,050
Yes sir.

172
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:09,150
What are you going to do with that?

173
00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:12,017
Hey! Hey!

174
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:13,483
What's that?

175
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:15,484
This feels like we're kissing!

176
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:16,215
Your lump hasn't gone yet, next, you'll injure
your tongue.

177
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:19,917
Don't! Don't! Stop that!

178
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:21,015
With their domain centered on Paris, has only
recently established a precarious mis...

179
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:29,749
Miss Conse...

180
00:10:30,382 --> 00:10:30,382
- Yes, ma'am?
- can l have your glasses please?

181
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:32,583
Ma'am?

182
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:33,015
Ma'am, l look better when l'm wearing glasses.

183
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:35,149
That's ok with me if you're ugly.

184
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:38,483
Can l have your glasses? Please.

185
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:38,783
5 or glasses?

186
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:40,149
Here Ma'am, It's all yours! There!

187
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:43,749
Okay, you may continue.

188
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:45,849
Was to take the... take centu..

189
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:49,049
- See? See?
- See! See.

190
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:51,983
You're reading!

191
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:53,082
No, ma'am.

192
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:53,849
- If you will behave that way in my class..
- Yes.

193
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:57,249
What?

194
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:57,949
You will never be an architect.

195
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:00,450
Are you sure ma'am?

196
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:04,653
Lucky for you to even land as an usherette. Sit
down!

197
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:06,549
Ms. Pedrosa, since you conspire with her, you
may report the Gothic.

198
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:12,750
l'm ready!

199
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:14,950
Go on.

200
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:20,053
Gothic took many forms, and no single
definition...

201
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,183
Ms. Dora.

202
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:26,884
- l have a note foryou.
- Mr. John Eduque!

203
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:29,150
- Thank you.
- Bye, ma'am.

204
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:29,749
Okay, continue...

205
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,217
You may go on with your report!

206
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:44,584
Why?

207
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,650
Why?

208
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:53,753
Lord, Why did l not answer the teacher's
question?

209
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:56,650
Lord, what do you want me to be?

210
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:59,984
You want me to be just an actress?

211
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:07,322
What Lord? Will l just join the beauty pageants?

212
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:15,985
Ah, penny for your thoughts?

213
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:22,951
Hey! Hey! Miss! Miss!

214
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:24,616
John Eduque?

215
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:28,284
At your service.

216
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:33,420
Problem? Maybe there will be no more bigger
problem than this.

217
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:38,286
lt's just that l wasn't able to answer the teacher's
question.

218
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:38,616
lt's not that l don't know the answer, but...

219
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:43,919
You know, it's just that l was mental blocked.

220
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:44,182
See, l'm your perfect heaven sent to talk to you.

221
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:49,883
This was what happened to you, maybe you lost
your focus and then you panicked,

222
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,584
that's why you forgot eveything.

223
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:57,916
lt happens to everyone, to all. Even to me, it
happens, okay?

224
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:03,049
This is what you should do, take a deep breath
and think of the questions before hand.

225
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:09,182
Okay, even those questions before yours.

226
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:18,422
Presto! There you will remember the answers to
those questions.

227
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:21,017
Yes, you're right.

228
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:21,649
You're so kind, thank you.

229
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:27,584
lt's because l care.

230
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:35,250
- Thank you.
- Okay.

231
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:56,552
l wonder where he is now?

232
00:13:58,716 --> 00:13:58,716
Good morning!

233
00:13:59,449 --> 00:13:59,715
Good morning!

234
00:13:59,849 --> 00:13:59,849
Elizabeth!

235
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:00,816
How's the newly transferred?

236
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:02,616
l'm happy but l'm scared.

237
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:05,916
lmagine, l was dependent to my parents for 25
years.

238
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:17,222
l was used to seeing my siblings when l arrive
home.

239
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:23,384
lt's like seeing my brother right now.

240
00:14:23,683 --> 00:14:25,217
What? Your brother?

241
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:29,484
Hey Adrian! What are you doing here?

242
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:30,015
l'm missing you so much that's why l'm here to
visit you.

243
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:35,117
Are you really visiting me or Maxine?

244
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:35,649
He's not courting me, big sister.

245
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:39,249
Big sister?

246
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:40,816
You're my secretay, not my sister!

247
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:49,154
And you Adrian, how would you succeed if
you're busy womanizing!

248
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:49,949
Okay, l have to go.

249
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:51,182
- See you later, Maxine.
- How's the powerpoint presentation?

250
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:53,516
lt's almost 3pm.

251
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:54,549
- l told you, Betchay, to finish it last night.
- Yes! Yes!

252
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:57,149
- Here we go again!
- Maxine, hot coffee!

253
00:14:59,149 --> 00:14:59,149
You're not asking boss, you talk much!

254
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:02,249
And you called me boss!

255
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,618
lt's on my table!

256
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:18,482
Ma'am, here's your coffee.

257
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:21,749
Thank you.

258
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:33,853
ls the coffee hot, ma'am?

259
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:34,916
Ma'am!

260
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:36,149
Ma'am?

261
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:39,417
Ma'am, What happened?

262
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:50,757
Me and John, we are really meant and perfect for
each other...

263
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:57,088
and l can't accept that this will just end like this.

264
00:15:57,883 --> 00:16:00,719
Our love was so sweet.

265
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:03,584
We were so happy together.

266
00:16:04,616 --> 00:16:04,616
lt's a bit censored but MTRCB will surely approve
it

267
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:08,516
because we were married notjust once...

268
00:16:12,115 --> 00:16:12,115
but 12 times in different countries and
continents.

269
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,683
That's why...

270
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:27,183
l can't take this anymore.

271
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:34,389
Noy, please continue our great love story.

272
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:40,385
[Singing]

273
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:16,521
Stop! l can't take this anymore! Enough with
goodbyes!

274
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:17,382
And we agreed that you will only sing one stanza,
right?

275
00:17:19,482 --> 00:17:19,482
- You sung two.
- Yeah, right. Yeah.

276
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:23,484
- Yeah, right.
- Goodbye.

277
00:17:23,716 --> 00:17:24,817
Thank you.

278
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:33,890
We all know that all relationships have
misunderstandings...

279
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:39,186
and l can't tell you the rest of the stoy.

280
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:41,250
Marco, please...

281
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:44,450
[Singing]

282
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:20,215
Thank you.

283
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:21,582
Thank you, Marco.

284
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:25,085
Thank you for following instructions.

285
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:27,650
You see. Noy? That's how you're supposed to
sing it.

286
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:31,119
Just one stanza. You talk to each other.

287
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:35,985
We are Adam and Eve.

288
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,117
Anthony & Cleopatra.

289
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:40,684
Evita and Juan Peron.

290
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:41,015
Guy and Pip.

291
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:42,249
Gabby and Sharon.

292
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:44,482
Piolo and Juday.

293
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:49,619
Kim Chiu and Gerald.

294
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:03,451
Why did this happen?

295
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:10,687
l haven't even told you how much l love you.

296
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:11,616
You gave me strength!

297
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:15,750
Oh my!

298
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:17,216
Who's that girl?

299
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:23,219
You were my inspiration!

300
00:19:37,249 --> 00:19:39,417
Boss, your father had mistress!

301
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:40,783

302
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:55,183
Madam!

303
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:56,283
Madam!

304
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:56,849
Madam!

305
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,416
Madam!

You liar!!!!

307
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:25,718
Stop her!

308

309
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:29,651

God, The Creator, will help you...

316
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:10,926
All your sufferings and pain, offer it to the Lord...

317
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:22,493
And He will take eveything away...

318
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:37,217
Madam!

319
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:37,649
What's that? l'm thirsty, l'll get water first.

What?

325
00:21:51,182 --> 00:21:56,921
You're scaring us, why are you wearing that
outfit?

326
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,317
What are doing here?

327
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:03,186
l'm scared to stay in the condominium, they
might kill me.

328
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:04,082
What?

329
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,149
Who?

330
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:06,016
Why?

331
00:22:06,816 --> 00:22:10,252
l made a scene in the funeral,

332
00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:10,315
l thought it was John Eduque who's dead, it
wasn't him.

333
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:13,649
lt was John Eduque Sr., his father.

334
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:24,323
Before l saw the body lying there, l made the
trouble already. It was embarrassing.

335
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:30,420
Why would they kill you? Didn't you explain that
you just made mistake?

336
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:37,121
l was so embarrassed and scared then, John
even followed me.

337
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:40,618
l'm sure, they are looking for me now.

338
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:42,950
Oh my!

339
00:22:43,716 --> 00:22:45,384
You know...

340
00:22:46,482 --> 00:22:49,718
They won't recognize you. You're wearing that
veil.

341
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:51,383
Really?

342
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:52,850
Are you sure?

343
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:58,821
C'mon Elizabeth, you go home now. Make way
for us to be alone together.

344
00:22:58,883 --> 00:22:58,883
l love you...

345
00:23:00,115 --> 00:23:01,950
- Ok.
- Take care.

346
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,383
Bye. l love you both.

347
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,983
- Bye mommy.
- Bye, my daughter.

348
00:23:06,382 --> 00:23:07,082
Bye dad.

349
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:09,183
- Take care.
- Ok.

350
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:11,349
- Hmm...
- Let's go.

351
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,750
- What did you say?
- What?

352
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:12,816
- Run after me!
- Slow down!

353
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:17,184
- Or else, no more!
- Wait!

354
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:26,149
Mother!

355
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:27,916
Mother!

356
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:31,618
Mom, We've waited so long, why didn't you push
through with dad's burial?

357
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:35,685
He doesn't deserve a decent burial!

358
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,017
- Boss, your dad was cremated.
- Cremate?

359
00:23:40,082 --> 00:23:46,288
l don't understand? Dad was roasted here?

360
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:51,119
Because your father is just a pig!

361
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:55,118
He's a pig! He messed up and wasted my love for
him!

362
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:55,315
But we're not of the same level.

363
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:59,885
There's a cheap crematorium at the back of this
roasting station!

364
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:01,917
l just asked to add sauce on him.

365
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:02,883
Sauce?

366
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:03,416
- Madam.
- Yes?

367
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:04,082
Your husband is cooked already. l mean, he's
already cremated!

368
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:07,182
ln an ice cream container?

369
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:10,984
That's what he deserves!

370
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:14,917
Here's your free roasted pig!

371
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:15,717
What?

372
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:20,653
We are giving away one roasted pig for evey
cremation in Hot Hot Funeral.

373
00:24:20,716 --> 00:24:23,118
Whatever! Bona petit!

374
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:24,316
Let's go!

375
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:28,015
Party!

376
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:30,885
- Come on! Cheers! It's a party!
- Party! Party!

377
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:34,818
lsn't it a wonderful party? Belinda is so fabulous!

378
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:34,883
- Whatever she does, her husband still had a
mistress.
- Party!

379
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:41,249
What?

380
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,917
Didn't you know what happened in the church?

381
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:43,983
- Her husband's mistress came!
- Really?

382
00:24:46,516 --> 00:24:49,852
- Yes!
- l didn't know that!

383
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:53,052
What the...

384
00:24:53,716 --> 00:24:54,817
Party!

385
00:24:55,382 --> 00:24:56,750
Yeah!

386
00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:57,882
- Party!
- Yes!

387
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:01,084
Mrs. Eduque is here.

388
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:05,785
- Does she look messed up?
- Messed up?

389
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:09,685
The mistress appeared in the funeral!

390
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:14,152
Sir was there when the scandal happened.

391
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:15,082
Being rich is not a guarantee to being happy,
isn't it?

392
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:24,755
And it's also not a guarantee that if you have
work today, after this minute you still have a job!

393
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,350
- Sorry, madam!
- Madam, sory!

394
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:26,416
Manager!

395
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:28,349
Yes, madam?

396
00:25:28,883 --> 00:25:34,021
l think l am withdrawing all my money now!

397
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:34,382
Now!

398
00:25:35,582 --> 00:25:38,551
Because of these gossip girls!

399
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:40,384
But wait!

400
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:40,449
Yes, madam?

401
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:46,920
l think l'll leave 20 pesos for each of you for
banana fritters while you're gossiping.

402
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:48,683
Okay?

403
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:55,250
What's happening here?

404
00:25:57,215 --> 00:25:57,215
Can we still come inside?

405
00:25:58,949 --> 00:25:58,949
Madam! Madam!

406
00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:04,687
The manager was proposing to lock the two
tellers in the vault

407
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:06,050
for two days if you will reconsider...

408
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:09,083
- No! Let's go!
- Yes, ma'am.

409
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:11,749
Oh my god! If that embarrassment happened to
Me.. .

410
00:26:14,315 --> 00:26:18,385
l would have probably took the first flight out of
this country.

411
00:26:18,816 --> 00:26:23,253
Not out of this county! Out of this planet!

412
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:31,690
Her eulogy of their lovelife surpassed Atang Dela
Rama, too bad the mistress ruined the scene.

413
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:32,349
Oh my!

414
00:26:32,516 --> 00:26:32,516
She even hired the hitmakers and outshined
them by being the main attraction!

415
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:48,224
- Belinda is truly one of a kind!
- Nurse Jil, driver Frosty, you know what to do!

416
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:06,949
Boss, what's happening?

417
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:08,649
Hold it! Hold it!

418
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:11,417
The maids are taking the furnitures out!

419
00:27:12,115 --> 00:27:12,115
Wait! What's that?

420
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:15,850
Where are you taking that?

421
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:18,417
- Where are you taking that?
- What's this tent for?

422
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:18,849
- Give it to me! Give it to me!
-Wait!

423
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:23,051
- Give it to me!
- Try to relax, madam!

424
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:26,184
Mother, why did you had this tent set here?

425
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:28,117
Are you tired of the house?

426
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:30,849
No!

427
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,384
The house is beautiful, isn't it?

428
00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:36,452
lt's expensive! It's world class!

429
00:27:36,783 --> 00:27:36,783
But figuratively speaking, that house is already
rotting, lurked with roaches and rats.

430
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:45,984
And it's all because of your father!

431
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,651
So why set up a tent outside the mansion?

432
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:59,723
You know Bert, that house was built with love,
with passion...

433
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:05,787
and evey corner of that house is a reminder of
happy memories.

434
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:11,420
ln the garage, bathroom, swimming pool...

435
00:28:11,783 --> 00:28:18,256
Even in the guardhouse, when it's the guard's
day off, we made love there.

436
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,317
Now tell me?

437
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:22,451
How can l live in that house?

438
00:28:22,516 --> 00:28:25,819
lf all those memories were all lies...

439
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:26,416
Because all the love we made were all lies!

440
00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:33,283
Because your father...

441
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:35,784
ls a liar!

442
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:47,627
Mama... Ma, don't wory, l will look for that girl
and she will pay for destroying this home!

443
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,584
Why are you crying?

444
00:28:50,249 --> 00:28:53,752
l pity madam. That girl is really bad!

445
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:09,755
What if l change career? l'll work here so l could
hide in the dark.

446
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:11,117
Don't be like that!

447
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:20,054
l'm not saying that this is a terrible job but you
will soon learn to feel envy in this movie house.

448
00:29:20,382 --> 00:29:23,485
A lot of couples here are making out

449
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:26,718
Even guys have partners and you have no one!

450
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:28,182
Well... at least l can see in the dark...

451
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:34,417
l'll be sharper

452
00:29:34,783 --> 00:29:37,619
Why? You want to be a thief?

453
00:29:40,015 --> 00:29:45,687
You even said that no one recognized you
because you were in your veil.

454
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:52,355
We can never be sure. Just look at the group
over there, they seem to be staring at us

455
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:57,387
C'mon, hury up! Johnny Eduque might be
sending people to spy on me already

456
00:29:57,449 --> 00:29:57,449
Did you take drugs and you're freaking out
there?

457
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:02,417
They are really staring at me!

458
00:30:06,516 --> 00:30:08,284
Wait, just wait!

459
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:10,849
Excuse me?

460
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:14,316
Do you know that girl over there?

461
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:15,549
The who?

462
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,417
That one in green.

463
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:17,582
No.

464
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:18,482
Then why keep on looking at there?

465
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:24,086
Oh, we are looking at John Lloyd, not at the two
of you.

466
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:25,683
He's our celebrity idol.

467
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:31,253
John Lloyd is so cute, isn't it? Yes, he is.

468
00:30:36,282 --> 00:30:36,282
Do you know the feeling of being embarrassed
because of wrong assumption?

469
00:30:39,749 --> 00:30:41,550
lt looks like you really mastered the act of doing
it.

470
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:41,616
Who knows, they're cross-eyed.

471
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:43,249
So something is wrong with them? l think you
should have an eye check-up, instead.

472
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:46,683
So it's me who has a problem?

473
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:47,949
Exactly!

474
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:49,950
ln that case, pay for this!

475
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:55,186
No, they have the problem. They are cross-eyed!
If they're not, it's John Lloyd. And you're perfect!

476
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:56,550
You pay for these.

477
00:30:57,249 --> 00:30:57,249
Good morning!

478
00:30:57,449 --> 00:30:58,783
Good morning!

479
00:30:59,182 --> 00:31:01,150
- Good morning!
- Good morning, boss!

480
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:01,416
Hey, how about taking another seat?

481
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:04,984
When l woke up, l know l'm still the owner ofthis
house.

482
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:05,049
C'mon boss, l'm sitting here already, you sit
there!

483
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:09,583
Allow your señorito to sit!

484
00:31:13,382 --> 00:31:14,249
Hello?

485
00:31:14,315 --> 00:31:14,315
- Hello, John Jr.?
- Yes, ma'am!

486
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:18,083
- Your mama!
- John Jr.!

487
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:19,182
Hello?

488
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:20,283
Hello, Ma?

489
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:21,083
My son?

490
00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:22,049
Did you eat already?

491
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:25,485
How can l eat here alone in this tent?

492
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:30,686
And besides, l'm not hungry, l'm angy!

493
00:31:31,883 --> 00:31:35,219
Ma, you're torturing yourself.

494
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:40,420
Come over here and eat. What food do you like?
l'll even feed you.

495
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:44,652
Oh John Jr., please. Come over here.

496
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:47,785
Please come, eat here with your mama.

497
00:31:48,015 --> 00:31:52,185
And what will l eat here? All the food are there.

498
00:31:52,249 --> 00:31:54,818
l can't eat there, l feel like throwing up!

499
00:31:55,516 --> 00:32:01,321
Come here, eat with me or else l will starve
myself to death!

500
00:32:02,015 --> 00:32:07,420
Oh, what is that? Rat poison? l'll taste it!

501
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:09,249
Bring all these to the tent. l'll eat there.

502
00:32:12,082 --> 00:32:12,082
Yes, sir.

503
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:15,784
Boss, you mother is getting worse, she's going
crazy!

504
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:21,254
That's why l have to find that dad's mistress
before my mom gets totally crazy.

505
00:32:24,282 --> 00:32:25,383
Give me that!

506
00:32:25,449 --> 00:32:27,517
Wait! l'm not yet done!

507
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:31,984
No more?

508
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:34,918
Please just take care of the record.

509
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:35,883
Yes, sir.

510
00:32:37,816 --> 00:32:40,818
Ok, wait, l'll call you back. Bye.

511
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:43,516
- Mr. Eduque.
- Yes?

512
00:32:43,582 --> 00:32:43,582
Here's the ORCR copy of Elizabeth Pedrosa's
car, its owner.

513
00:32:47,983 --> 00:32:51,686
Thanks a lot for this Uncle. This is a big help.

514
00:32:51,883 --> 00:32:55,286
You should've called instead of coming here.

515
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,051
Ok, next time we will just text it.

516
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:02,685
So boss, what's your next move?

517
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:02,816
Me? Here's your next move!

518
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:09,052
That's what l meant! What will l do next?

519
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:10,449
Yes?

520
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:11,549
Good morning, miss!

521
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:17,086
l'm from the Census, l'm just doing a survey.

522
00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:20,452
Are you Ms. Elizabeth Pedrosa?

523
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:27,489
l'm Jill Pedrosa, her mother. Do l look like the
young miss?

524
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:27,549
Exactly! You look like one!

525
00:33:32,683 --> 00:33:37,354
This is just a survey from Census, can we have
an interview?

526
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,951
- Sure, come in.
- Thank you.

527
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:45,550
What's your name?

528
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:52,022
l'm Bert Simpson. How long have you been
staying here? How many children do you have?

529
00:33:52,082 --> 00:33:52,082
l have four children, two girls and two boys.

530
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:57,317
This is the youngest.

531
00:33:57,683 --> 00:34:01,953
- Macmac, please eat now!
- Wow! That's so cute!

532
00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:02,015
What about Elizabeth Pedrosa, your eldest, is
she around?

533
00:34:07,082 --> 00:34:07,082
She's at work.

534
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:12,386
Besides, she's no longer staying here. She owns
a condominium unit.

535
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:12,449
Condominium! Where is that?

536
00:34:16,115 --> 00:34:16,115
Oh, maybe that condominium unit is their love
nest.

537
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:22,983
What?

538
00:34:24,015 --> 00:34:29,987
Nothing! l said your houseboy is done cleaning...

539
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:30,315
That's not our houseboy. He's Jack, my husband.

540
00:34:33,182 --> 00:34:33,182
ls this your husband?

541
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:35,416
You bastard!

542
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:42,152
l said boyfriend! You're easily pissed!

543
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:42,549
The two of you look so young just like
sweethearts! That's why!

544
00:34:48,115 --> 00:34:48,115
Oh, you're tying to get off the hook!

545
00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:49,816
No sir, l'm just doing my job, Census!

546
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:52,382
Darling, l'll go ahead. l'll drive now.

547
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:55,817
Ok, take care.

548
00:34:55,883 --> 00:34:55,883
- You're a driver?
- Bye.

549
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:57,783
Yes!

550
00:34:57,949 --> 00:34:57,949
FX, a taxi cab, We own one!

551
00:35:00,616 --> 00:35:00,616
So that's why she did it!

552
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:04,716
- What?
- What did you say?

553
00:35:05,883 --> 00:35:05,883
l mean, that's the reason why your eldest,
Elizabeth, worked early.

554
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:11,049
Because you're helping each other.

555
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:18,315
ls Elizabeth pretty?

556
00:35:20,749 --> 00:35:23,118
Oh, she's really beautiful!

557
00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:26,151
l'm sure she got her looks from you!

558
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:28,883
What time will you leave?

559
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:32,252
Right now? l'll go with you in your taxi!

560
00:35:32,315 --> 00:35:34,850
You like to go with me to the cemetery?

561
00:35:39,315 --> 00:35:42,551
Boss, l'm already here. Confirmed, ok!

562
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:44,117
Because it's me!

563
00:35:47,616 --> 00:35:47,616
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?

564
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:49,082
- Is Elizabeth Pedrosa already in?
- Is she expecting you?

565
00:35:52,115 --> 00:35:56,219
l'm a friend. l'm surprising her. It's her birthday
today!

566
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:56,282
Where's the cake?

567
00:35:57,482 --> 00:35:57,482
Cake?

568
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:01,318
There must be a cake. It's a birthday surprise,
right?

569
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:05,218
Elizabeth doesn't like cakes.

570
00:36:05,282 --> 00:36:07,450
She's allergic to sweets.

571
00:36:07,516 --> 00:36:10,785
Just wait for her. l can't allow you to go up.

572
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:14,285
You're talking a lot! Be ready for me tomorrow!

573
00:36:30,182 --> 00:36:37,722
Have you ever had five thousand pesos?

574
00:36:37,883 --> 00:36:39,284
Not yet.

575
00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:39,816
You like?

576
00:36:40,082 --> 00:36:41,116
Yes.

577
00:36:41,516 --> 00:36:41,516
l'm still depressed. Is it ok if l'll go out?

578
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:48,585
Will you stop it, Elizabeth Pedrosa!

579
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:51,985
Food is the only solution to your depression!

580
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:52,916
Ok! l feel like eating fishballs!

581
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:59,686
Fishballs? l don't like it. Never mind, that's ok,
there's also kikiam. Let's go!

582
00:36:59,883 --> 00:36:59,883
- Here!
- Hey miss, l make deliveries too.

583
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:03,483
What's your unit?

584
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:03,549
l don't like fishballs anymore. l think l like soya
milk.

585
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:07,883
- Sory!
- Soya milk?

586
00:37:08,482 --> 00:37:10,150
- You changed your mind again!
- Soya milk!

587
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:10,282
Soya milk!!!

588
00:37:11,382 --> 00:37:11,949
Soya milk!!!

589
00:37:12,015 --> 00:37:12,882
Yours too?

590
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:15,049
l'm a multinational businessman.

591
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:19,016
We have free delivery.

592
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:22,552
Woud you like me to bring this to your unit so
you will not wait anymore?

593
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:23,717
What's your unit?

594
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:24,115
- l don't like soya milk anymore.
- Oh!

595
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:26,349
The caramel in it is fattening, isnt't it?

596
00:37:28,983 --> 00:37:28,983
You're right! l love eating all the caramel, it made
me fat.

597
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:31,649
- Ok, We won't buy anymore.
- So what are we going to eat now?

598
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:35,118
lce cream! l think l like to eat ice cream!

599
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:37,617
- Ice cream? Wait up!

601
00:37:40,816 --> 00:37:40,816
l think ice cream is more fattening.

602
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:44,649
Never mind, thank you.

603
00:37:45,716 --> 00:37:45,716
- That's right, it's fattening.
- My ice cream is not fattening!

604
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:47,783
Buy my ice cream now! l'm so tired of you!

605
00:37:50,649 --> 00:37:50,649
l don't know what you want to eat anymore!

606
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:55,385
A while ago, it was fishballs, then soya milk, now,
it's ice cream!

607
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:58,952

Cheese flavor?

611
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:05,015
Okay!

612
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,283
For me, cheese please!

613
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:08,183
Go!

614
00:38:08,616 --> 00:38:08,616
Here's the payment.

00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:10,650
Thanks.

616
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:11,982
Thank you!

617
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:18,350
Confirmed!

618
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:19,549
Sir, she's not around yet

619
00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:21,149
ls that so?

620
00:38:22,482 --> 00:38:22,482
- Sir, if you like, just wait at the lobby.
- Ah, ok.

621
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:25,182
What time will she come?

622
00:38:26,115 --> 00:38:27,916
- Hi!
-Around three.

623
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,283
Excuse me, miss.

624
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,983
- Yes, sir?
- l'm looking for...

625
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:31,949
Boss!

626
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:36,450
Ok, sir! Copy, sir!

627
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:41,787
Boss, it's confirmed! The girl's name you gave
me really lives here.

628
00:38:42,149 --> 00:38:42,149
Really pretty?

629
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:42,916
That's true, sir! She's really pretty, sexy and
flawless!

630
00:38:47,149 --> 00:38:47,149
But she's not the type of girl that your father
would ever want.

631
00:38:51,382 --> 00:38:54,952
That's why it seems impossible for her to be your
father's mistress.

632
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:59,319
lsn't it that the kind of girl your father wanted
was your mother's type?

633
00:38:59,482 --> 00:39:02,718
So you're telling me that my mommy is ugly?

634
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:14,758
l'm not saying that. Let's just say that your
mom's beauty is not yet the trend.

635
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:22,990
Your mom's kind is for the neutralization to
produce good looking children like you.

636
00:39:26,182 --> 00:39:27,583
Mr. Eduque!

637
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:28,549
Hello! Hello!

638
00:39:29,783 --> 00:39:29,783
Good morning. l'm the son of Itto Durias.

639
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:31,949
lt's an honor for you to visit our condominium.

640
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:36,283
And what can l do for you, sir?

641
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,684
l'd like to check your condominium units.

642
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:43,015
This is the recreational area. The facilities are
complete and we also have swimming pool here.

643
00:39:48,482 --> 00:39:48,482
We can see.

644
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:49,649
l want to see the units.

645
00:39:51,482 --> 00:39:51,482
Oh, that's perfect! There's vacant at the
penthouse.

646
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:54,149
- What a beautiful view!
- What floor?

647
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:55,249
38th floor.

648
00:39:55,716 --> 00:39:58,518
- You can see the whole...
- l'd like to see the units on the 38th floor.

649
00:39:58,582 --> 00:40:00,283

650
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:00,516
Johhny, Johnny!

00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:02,482
Yes sir?

652
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:05,284
Do you have the keys for the model units?

653
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:05,349
What? Yes Sir!

654
00:40:06,649 --> 00:40:06,649
By the way sir, this is Johnny, the caretaker of
our model units here.

655
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:15,186
- Sir, if you need anything, just look for me.
- Ok, thank you.

656
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:16,082
This way, sir.

657
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:18,783
Come!

658
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:18,849
Just perfect, there's a lot of vacant units on this
floor.

659
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,551
Just perfect, there's a lot of vacant units on this
floor.

660
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:21,616
What an awesome view here in 3$th floor.

661
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:23,849
You can see the whole Metro Manila, even the
Manila Bay.

662
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:28,215
- Sir! Come follow me, the model units are there.
- Boss, this is it!

663
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:30,616
Excuse me!

664
00:40:31,582 --> 00:40:31,582
Sir?

665
00:40:32,649 --> 00:40:34,017
l want to see this unit.

666
00:40:35,382 --> 00:40:35,382
lt's already occupied sir, there, we still have a lot
of vacant units.

667
00:40:40,149 --> 00:40:40,149
Yes, there!

668
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:40,783
l want to see this unit, please!

669
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:48,187
We have the same size at the other side, and it's
vacant.

670
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:52,152
- Quick! Open it! The view from there is better.
- Here, l'll open it.

671
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:52,215
This is good!

672
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:53,449
- Sir! Take a peak!
- Beautiful!

673
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:55,849
- Sir, get inside so you will see the view.
- No. This is exactly what l want to see.

674
00:40:59,215 --> 00:40:59,215
l want to see a fully furnished unit.

675
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:01,049
Well. Fine sir, our model units there are
fabulously furnished.

676
00:41:05,783 --> 00:41:12,156
My feet are aching already! It's up to you, l'm just
about to buy three floors.

677
00:41:12,215 --> 00:41:13,416
Wow!

678
00:41:13,683 --> 00:41:13,683
Who owns this?

679
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:18,552
Elizabeth Pedrosa sir, but she left.

680
00:41:19,149 --> 00:41:19,149
She left. Would you like to wait for a little while?

681
00:41:22,582 --> 00:41:22,582
Ok, l'll just leave. You don't seem to be
interested.

682
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:24,182
Sir sir sir!

683
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:28,818
- We can open it, l have the key.
- We can't.

684
00:41:28,883 --> 00:41:28,883
lt's really against the condominium's policy.

685
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:30,916
Sir, we better wait up. A case might be filed
against us. We will lose ourjob.

686
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:34,382
Please understand, sir.

687
00:41:36,149 --> 00:41:36,149
Please, don't leave yet. This wouldn't take long,
sir.

688
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:39,883
You want body spa sir?

689
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:40,082

691
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:45,649

692
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:47,250
- Ma'am! Ma'am!

693
00:41:47,315 --> 00:41:49,717
Somebody wants to see your unit. Is it ok?

694
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:50,816

700
00:42:07,683 --> 00:42:07,683
Ma'am, can we call them out now?

701
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:11,250
Wait, ma'am.

702
00:42:11,582 --> 00:42:12,582
Sir?

703
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:14,284
- Sir?
- Where are they?

704
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:15,349
Just follow that boss, l'm sure it's the girl's car.

705
00:42:19,382 --> 00:42:19,382
Bert, you're vey noisy!

706
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:22,850
Just keep close, boss.

707
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:24,850
- Slow down boss!
- Okay, you drive!

708
00:42:25,015 --> 00:42:26,950
- Hold the steering wheel.
- It's just a suggestion!

709
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:30,252
l'm sure boss, she's going to her office.

710
00:42:30,616 --> 00:42:32,117
Elizabeth. This is so heavy.

711
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:35,218
Oh, don't complain. You like it, right?

712
00:42:35,549 --> 00:42:38,685
You did not tell me that you're bringing all the
stuff in your house.

713
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:38,949
Try complaining a lot.

714
00:42:41,282 --> 00:42:41,282
There's a lot of baggage boys in the
condominium.

715
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:42,949
- He's here!!!

716
00:42:44,816 --> 00:42:47,285

717
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:49,216
Elizabeth!

718
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:49,749
What?

719
00:42:50,683 --> 00:42:50,683
ls there a celebrity?

720
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:54,084
Not a celebrity! John Eduque is here!

721
00:42:55,549 --> 00:42:57,751
l'm more handsome than him!

722
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:01,350
He's my type!

723
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:03,216
There he is!

724
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:05,382

00:43:09,215 --> 00:43:11,183
Sorry! Sorry! Excuse me, excuse me! We have to

We're leaving? We just arrived!

729
00:43:14,115 --> 00:43:16,083
Are you sure you're working here?

730
00:43:16,149 --> 00:43:17,149
Hury!

731
00:43:17,215 --> 00:43:17,215
- Ms. Pedrosa!

732
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:18,749

736
00:43:25,582 --> 00:43:27,283

737
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:28,950
Sir, why are you ignoring me?

738
00:43:29,716 --> 00:43:30,650
Miss Pedrosa!

739
00:43:31,149 --> 00:43:32,250
Hey, Elizabeth!

741
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:35,616
- Give me a lift!
- What? Why ma'am?

742
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:38,550
Hury!

743
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:38,716
- What will you do, ma'am?
- Come on, ride with me!

744
00:43:40,315 --> 00:43:40,315

748
00:43:51,983 --> 00:43:54,051

00:43:54,449 --> 00:43:56,617
- How about you, sir? Need a ride too?

- Ouch, boss!

751
00:44:02,482 --> 00:44:03,583
Ok, right?

752
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:04,750
Ouch!

753
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:13,251
Get down!

754
00:44:33,182 --> 00:44:34,716
Miss!

755
00:44:37,282 --> 00:44:38,816
Hey!

756
00:44:41,182 --> 00:44:42,316
Miss!

757
00:44:42,616 --> 00:44:44,417
Falling down! Falling down!

759

00:44:49,282 --> 00:44:51,183

00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:53,783
lt's ok now!

762
00:44:56,382 --> 00:44:57,349
Are you okay?

763
00:44:57,482 --> 00:44:59,517
Why do you have to run?

764
00:44:59,716 --> 00:45:01,751
l just want to get to know you.

765
00:45:02,683 --> 00:45:05,552
Hi! l'm Elizabeth Pedrosa.

766
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:08,317
l'm John Eduque.

767
00:45:09,482 --> 00:45:12,551
You're not touching your food?

768
00:45:13,115 --> 00:45:18,487
l haven't recovered yet from that chasing
incident.

769
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:19,482
Why do you look so scared a while ago?

770
00:45:22,182 --> 00:45:22,182
lt's like you've seen a ghost from the past.

771
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:31,421
lt's nothing! What ghost from the past?

772
00:45:31,482 --> 00:45:34,484
l have nothing to be afraid of, right?

773
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,486
Why, do you remember anything?

774
00:45:40,082 --> 00:45:44,219
Don't you have anything to share about your
past?

775
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:48,219
Past? l have no past, remember?

776
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:48,449
l told you, the credit card collector looks like you.

777
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:55,952
l haven't paid my due that's why l tried to evade.

778
00:45:56,783 --> 00:46:00,887
Do l look like someone who's family you ruined?

779
00:46:03,816 --> 00:46:03,816
That's quite an absurd interpretation for my
minor reaction.

780
00:46:10,315 --> 00:46:10,315
Minor? You call it minor?

781
00:46:12,749 --> 00:46:15,852
You almost risked your life in that chase up
there, that's minor?

782
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:21,320
Let's ty to forget that cheap scene l did back
there.

783
00:46:21,616 --> 00:46:23,818
Why are you looking for me, anyway?

784
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:27,986
l have a business proposal for you.

785
00:46:29,182 --> 00:46:32,184
That's it? l thought it's a marriage proposal.

786
00:46:37,382 --> 00:46:38,349
Madam?

787
00:46:39,149 --> 00:46:40,416
Madam?

788
00:46:41,282 --> 00:46:41,282
Madam!

789
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:42,549
What?

790
00:46:43,482 --> 00:46:45,650
The P.l. you've asked for is here!

791
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:50,452
What P.l? My husband's mistress?

792
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:51,817
Where's that P.l.?

793
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:51,949
- Ma'am!
- P.l.

794
00:46:53,015 --> 00:46:57,419
- That P.l. stands for Private Investigator!
- Ma'am, just relax. 200 over 1$O.

795
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:01,584
l know! What do you take me for? Let him in!

796
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:06,652
You called for me, madam?

797
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:10,116
What is your name?

798
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:13,018
Bond... just call me Bond...

799
00:47:13,516 --> 00:47:14,650
James Bond?

800
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:20,019
Just Bond... short for Bonifacio D. Madugo, at
your service ma'am!

801
00:47:20,582 --> 00:47:21,983
Bonifacio...

802
00:47:22,282 --> 00:47:25,151
220 over 200.

803
00:47:30,516 --> 00:47:30,516
Here are the revisions you requested, Mr.Eduque.

804
00:47:33,649 --> 00:47:37,386
By tomorrow, they would be finalizing the ceiling
at the lobby.

805
00:47:37,683 --> 00:47:42,821
The materials are expensive because it's from
Italy.

806
00:47:44,582 --> 00:47:50,788
- The walls will be made of granite...
- Wait, wait! Sorry, sorry! l was lost already.

807
00:47:51,015 --> 00:47:54,952
lf you want, why don't we talk about it over
dinner?

808
00:47:56,949 --> 00:47:56,949
Are you asking me for a date?

809
00:47:59,082 --> 00:48:06,022
You can assume that this dinner is strictly
business.

810
00:48:09,816 --> 00:48:09,816
Why are you staring at me like that?

811
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:18,521
Wait! Other than in the office, have we met
before?

812
00:48:18,582 --> 00:48:19,716
What?

813
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:35,620
So, Mr. Eduque, what business would you like to
invest in?

814
00:48:35,683 --> 00:48:37,017
Building construction.

815
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:37,349
Oh!

816
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:46,356
For my father who just passed away, maybe
you've heard of him, John Eduque Sr.

817
00:48:56,249 --> 00:48:58,150
Stuttering in fright...

818
00:48:59,649 --> 00:49:02,518
Obviously, she and daddy really had relationship.

819
00:49:03,249 --> 00:49:05,684
l'm so sorry. My apologies.

820
00:49:06,249 --> 00:49:07,216
Tensed?

821
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:09,517
Tensed? No it's...

822
00:49:09,582 --> 00:49:12,751
Well, l can't blame you...

823
00:49:14,182 --> 00:49:15,049
What?

824
00:49:15,115 --> 00:49:18,184
Memories of the past...

825
00:49:20,983 --> 00:49:27,055
Mr. Eduque, can we just talk about business
here. Let's not talk about your dead father.

826
00:49:27,649 --> 00:49:28,783
Ok.

827
00:49:33,482 --> 00:49:34,216
Oh!

828
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:35,917
Miss, let me get it!

829
00:49:36,149 --> 00:49:38,117
Elizabeth Pedrosa.

830
00:49:38,549 --> 00:49:39,416
Yes, thank you.

831
00:49:39,482 --> 00:49:41,951
Hey Miss, can l get a picture of you that you used
your card?

832
00:49:42,015 --> 00:49:42,882
Picture! Picture! Picture!

833
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:42,949
No! Nonononono! l'm in hurry! Thank you, ok!

834
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:46,149
How about me? Can you take a picture of me?
Game!

835
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:50,518
Oh no! l ran out of film!

836
00:49:50,983 --> 00:49:52,784
Film? Isn't it digital?

837
00:49:54,249 --> 00:49:57,752
lf you don't like to take pictures, just don't make
me look like stupid.

838
00:49:58,315 --> 00:50:03,553
Madam, be ready with your payment. l'm now
face to face with your rival.

839
00:50:04,616 --> 00:50:04,616
Why don't you just tell him the truth so you won't
have a problem anymore.

840
00:50:10,182 --> 00:50:10,182
Then what? He will know that it was me who
made the scene at his father's funeral.

841
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:14,416
That's really a turn off. My love life is ruined!

842
00:50:16,649 --> 00:50:18,617
So don't tell him!

843
00:50:19,582 --> 00:50:19,582
Can l do that?

844
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:24,118
lt's as if l'm betraying him.

845
00:50:25,215 --> 00:50:25,215
Then, what do you really want?

846
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:26,416
We better eat. l'm hungry already. We need to eat
so l can give you good advice.

847
00:50:33,549 --> 00:50:33,549
Ok, just don't eat too much because when you
get full, you become sleepy.

848
00:50:38,449 --> 00:50:39,416
What am l? A pig?

849
00:50:39,482 --> 00:50:40,716
Almost there!

850
00:50:40,949 --> 00:50:41,683
Let's go.

851
00:50:58,115 --> 00:51:00,450
She's so ugly!

852
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:01,250
Very dark!

853
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:02,550
So fat!

854
00:51:04,683 --> 00:51:04,683
How horrible!

855
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:08,885
My husband replaced me for this girl?

856
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:09,382
Unbelievable!

857
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:10,949
Madam! Madam! Not that one!

858
00:51:13,149 --> 00:51:13,149
That girl on her back!

859
00:51:14,482 --> 00:51:15,983
That's her best friend!

860
00:51:16,382 --> 00:51:18,450
- This?
- Yes! That's the one!

861
00:51:18,649 --> 00:51:22,052
Don't you have any other pictures? Not the one
on her back?

862
00:51:22,115 --> 00:51:22,115
Ma'am, she's always eluding.

863
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:28,587
As matter of fact, l need 40 thousand pesos right
now so l can follow her to Cebu!

864
00:51:28,816 --> 00:51:28,816
40 thousand pesos! Are you going to reside
there?

865
00:51:31,616 --> 00:51:36,854
Ma'am, she's in a first class hotel. That's up to
you, you might not meet this girl.

866
00:51:38,115 --> 00:51:38,115
- Chabelita!
- Madam?

867
00:51:39,783 --> 00:51:40,483
Get the check!

868
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:42,717
- Your check or my check?
- When did you have one?

869
00:51:42,783 --> 00:51:43,950
Just kidding!

870
00:51:47,649 --> 00:51:49,450
Give me the pictures!

871
00:51:53,115 --> 00:51:54,216
Who's there?

872
00:51:54,649 --> 00:51:58,986
l was just getting food because l'm hungy.

873
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:00,416
What are doing here, Monique?

874
00:52:02,816 --> 00:52:05,251
The food smells delicious! l just tasted it.

875
00:52:05,883 --> 00:52:08,619
- Where's Elizabeth?
- There, she's sad again.

876
00:52:09,883 --> 00:52:10,850
My god!

877
00:52:11,716 --> 00:52:17,688
Elizabeth, my daughter, what happened again?

878
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:26,257
Mama, Elizabeth is in big trouble. She's so in
Iove now with John Eduque.

879
00:52:27,249 --> 00:52:32,487
What's new with that? That issue is even older
than the Intramuros Wall!

880
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:32,549
Move on!

881
00:52:33,716 --> 00:52:38,153
- That's right, move on!
- Ma, this is serious.

882
00:52:38,482 --> 00:52:43,486
l feel like any moment from now, John Eduque
will ask me to marry him.

883
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:45,917
Why? Are you two together now?

884
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:46,249
Not yet.

885
00:52:47,482 --> 00:52:54,989
That's how dillusional your daughter is. She
wants marriage at once.

886
00:52:55,149 --> 00:52:57,317
l'm really confused now.

887
00:52:59,082 --> 00:53:04,754
l love him very much but l don't know how to tell
him the truth.

888
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:08,284
Then, why don't you just tell him the truth?

889
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:13,451
My child, we didn't raise you that way.

890
00:53:13,683 --> 00:53:19,722
You should always be true to yourself... so you
will always be happy.

891
00:53:20,149 --> 00:53:22,084
Ok, my baby?

892
00:53:22,482 --> 00:53:24,917
What are you waiting for?

893
00:53:26,015 --> 00:53:26,015
Go girl!

894
00:53:26,949 --> 00:53:34,356
lf you were to ask me, l'll tell that secret.

895
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,084
Thank you.

896
00:53:41,282 --> 00:53:46,420
l'm so happy John Jr. It's been a long time since
you last had dinner with me.

897
00:53:47,649 --> 00:53:47,649
Sorry Ma. l was so busy with my work. How are
you?

898
00:53:51,115 --> 00:53:52,216
l'm okay...

899
00:53:53,182 --> 00:53:54,316
l'm okay...

900
00:53:54,883 --> 00:53:55,717
Not really...

901
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:57,316
Not like that...

902
00:53:57,783 --> 00:53:58,884
But l will be ok.

903
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:00,683
Good.

904
00:54:00,983 --> 00:54:03,719
Especially when that girl is found already.

905
00:54:07,816 --> 00:54:07,816
Are you ok?

906
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:10,784
Yeah. l'm okay, Ma.

907
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,384
Don't you think it's time for us to move on?

908
00:54:14,649 --> 00:54:16,717
Ma, please forgive daddy now.

909
00:54:18,149 --> 00:54:19,250
No!

910
00:54:19,716 --> 00:54:24,020
Well, you like daddy to come to you instead to
ask for forgiveness?

911
00:54:24,616 --> 00:54:26,117
You think l'm scared?

912
00:54:26,182 --> 00:54:28,884
He's the one who will be scared if he shows up.

913
00:54:29,449 --> 00:54:33,619
ln fairness to him being handsome, he won't be a
scary ghost.

914
00:54:34,082 --> 00:54:34,082
Remember, you had him cremated. He will visit
you in that burned condition.

915
00:54:38,582 --> 00:54:38,582
l don't regret that decision

916
00:54:40,716 --> 00:54:43,952
Would you like me to bang his and her mistress'
heads?

917
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:49,219
l'm having her tracked and when l see her...

918
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:49,849
There will be no forgiveness for her and her
grandchildren!

919
00:54:54,616 --> 00:55:00,254
And that girl will regret the day that she was born

920
00:55:21,549 --> 00:55:27,087
You awakened my feelings...

921
00:55:27,983 --> 00:55:27,983
When we our paths crossed...

922
00:55:33,683 --> 00:55:38,721
We haven't seen each other for so long...

923
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:44,987
How are you, beautiful girl...

924
00:55:45,816 --> 00:55:51,188
You haven't changed a thing...

925
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:51,582
My heart leaps whenever you stare...

926
00:55:57,749 --> 00:55:57,749
- Your moves send shivers in my spine...
- The food's good here!

927
00:56:05,416 --> 00:56:05,416
- Here?
- Yes!

928
00:56:06,482 --> 00:56:06,482
- Yes!
- Are you sure?

929
00:56:07,516 --> 00:56:09,584
Yes! Have a seat, let me handle it.

930
00:56:10,115 --> 00:56:10,115
You're sure?

931
00:56:11,015 --> 00:56:15,085
Why can't l propose...

932
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:15,849
Even so l'm ready to do what's right...

933
00:56:21,482 --> 00:56:21,482
l cannot let this chance pass by...

934
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:27,349
l won't avoid you like l used to...

935
00:56:33,482 --> 00:56:40,922
l cannot let this chance to tell you...

936
00:56:40,983 --> 00:56:42,818
Come on let's ride there!

937
00:56:44,249 --> 00:56:44,249
This is fun!

938
00:56:45,549 --> 00:56:46,283
Where are we going?

939
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:48,083
We're almost there.

940
00:56:48,282 --> 00:56:49,249
This is hold-up!

941
00:56:49,582 --> 00:56:50,582
Give me your money!

942
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:51,884
Wait!

943
00:56:52,115 --> 00:56:53,082
l said give it to me!

944
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:04,520
lf there are other robbers left, get off!

945
00:57:16,082 --> 00:57:17,483
Yes!

946
00:57:20,849 --> 00:57:20,849
John Jr.

947
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:22,383
Ma?

948
00:57:22,849 --> 00:57:23,683
Yeah!

949
00:57:24,082 --> 00:57:24,949
Yeah!

950
00:57:25,683 --> 00:57:26,550
Yeah...

951
00:57:27,082 --> 00:57:32,754
You seemed so happy, you didn't even thought of
checking your sad mother.

952
00:57:34,149 --> 00:57:39,020
There you go again. l thought you're already
asleep. That's it, ok?

953
00:57:40,683 --> 00:57:42,451
Are you in love?

954
00:57:44,449 --> 00:57:47,852
Well, you're a grown up man now...

955
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:51,051
l hope that girl is not playing games with you.

956
00:57:51,249 --> 00:57:55,019
lt's hard to have a rival and it hurts...

957
00:57:56,449 --> 00:58:06,125
Good night, my son. l better go inside before the
sleeping pills l drank take effect...

958
00:58:40,382 --> 00:58:45,520
Dad, why do we have to love the same girl?

959
00:58:49,382 --> 00:58:49,382
Where?

960
00:58:50,582 --> 00:58:51,449
John!

961
00:58:51,516 --> 00:58:52,183
Hi!

962
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:53,416
Ma! Pa! This is John Eduque...

963
00:58:56,582 --> 00:58:58,483
- John, this is the whole Pedrosa clan.
- Hello!

964
00:58:58,549 --> 00:58:58,549
- Hello.
- Wow! Finally, you're no longer just a stoy.

965
00:59:02,716 --> 00:59:03,216
What?

966
00:59:03,783 --> 00:59:09,155
She means, she only saw you at the billboards,
_.V...

967
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:09,516
- Yes!
- Come swim with us!

968
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:11,416
No! l think l'm not prepared for swimming.

969
00:59:14,616 --> 00:59:14,616
Really? Come on!

970
00:59:16,983 --> 00:59:16,983
Or you must be ashamed of your body?

971
00:59:18,783 --> 00:59:22,920
Yes, l mean, l'm really embarrassed of my body.

972
00:59:23,115 --> 00:59:23,115
lt's really not a joke, truly embarrassing.

973
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:27,482
Gosh! Is that abs?

974
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:30,149
Can l touch it?

975
00:59:31,582 --> 00:59:33,183
What if l make you drown?

976
00:59:33,249 --> 00:59:33,249
l'd rather drown you fast than allowing you to
touch his abs!

977
00:59:36,049 --> 00:59:36,049
You're still too young to flaunt!

978
00:59:38,249 --> 00:59:41,385
Monique, don't talk to my daughter like that...

979
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:41,782
l mean...

980
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:45,586
My children just know how to appreciate beauty,
right?

981
00:59:47,582 --> 00:59:47,582
When you appreciate the food l cooked, do you
see me complain?

982
00:59:51,349 --> 00:59:51,349
No!

983
00:59:52,015 --> 00:59:52,015
Never!

984
00:59:52,949 --> 00:59:57,053
- This family is really appreaciative!
- Is it cold?

985
00:59:57,582 --> 00:59:58,849
- Let me sit in.
- Go ahead!

986
00:59:58,916 --> 00:59:58,916
- Stop staring! That's embarrassing!
- John, do you want some chips?

987
01:00:01,215 --> 01:00:01,215
- Don't you get tired doing that?
- Thank you.

988
01:00:02,449 --> 01:00:02,449
He's yummy can't get tired of that! That's
yummy-ness!

989
01:00:05,382 --> 01:00:09,219
- Quit staring! He might melt!
- Yummy?

990
01:00:10,282 --> 01:00:11,950
What about this?

991
01:00:12,315 --> 01:00:13,783
Yummy-ness!

992
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:17,418
ls he courting you?

993
01:00:18,015 --> 01:00:23,153
Just a reminder, he is only 3 pesos ahead of me.

994
01:00:23,315 --> 01:00:24,015
3 pesos?

995
01:00:24,182 --> 01:00:24,182
3 pesos!

996
01:00:24,983 --> 01:00:30,588
Ok, save that 3 pesos and get yourself decent,
non-glaring trunks.

997
01:00:31,816 --> 01:00:33,083
Glaring?

998
01:00:33,683 --> 01:00:33,683
ls this glaring?

999
01:00:35,249 --> 01:00:36,316
This is pure abs!

1000
01:00:37,849 --> 01:00:39,116
l need results!

1001
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:41,751
- Yes ma'am, first thing tomorrow!
- When?

1002
01:00:41,816 --> 01:00:42,683
Tomorrow!

1003
01:00:42,749 --> 01:00:43,683
- Hi, Ma!
- Tomorrow?

1004
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:45,183
- You promise?
- Yes, ma'am!

1005
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:46,650
Hello!

1006
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:51,017
- Who are you?
- What?

1007
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:54,051
- Oh, John Jr.!
- Yes mommy!

1008
01:00:54,449 --> 01:00:56,617
My son!

1009
01:00:57,849 --> 01:00:59,884
- Why do you look different?
- Me?

1010
01:01:00,683 --> 01:01:00,683
You look happy?

1011
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:06,253
- He hit the jackpot, that's why!
- Why are you happy?

1012
01:01:07,182 --> 01:01:08,216
Excuse me?

1013
01:01:08,516 --> 01:01:14,355
Oh, my manners! Bond, this is John Jr., my son.

1014
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:14,416
John Jr., this is Bond. This is not my son, this is
our private detective.

1015
01:01:18,349 --> 01:01:18,349
What?

1016
01:01:19,082 --> 01:01:19,082
l thought, we've talked about this, mom?

1017
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:23,684
We agreed to move on, right?

1018
01:01:23,949 --> 01:01:23,949
Move on - move on!

1019
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:25,582
l will move on when l want to!

1020
01:01:28,249 --> 01:01:31,018
Right now, l'm moving in to my tent!

1021
01:01:31,082 --> 01:01:32,983
Excuse me!

1022
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:37,215
Why, John Jr.? You don't want her to know?

1023
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:45,822
You can't let your mother know who's your
daddy's mistress?

1024
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:46,349
Why? Do you know something?

1025
01:01:48,516 --> 01:01:48,516
Let me surprise you, John Jr.!

1026
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:52,417
You might even be more surprised than your
mother!

1027
01:01:52,616 --> 01:01:57,454
Just make sure you're good at yourjob and my
mother is not wasting her money on you!

1028
01:01:57,749 --> 01:01:58,716
Are you sure?

1029
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:03,386
Would you like me to tell your mother eveything
about your daddy's misress?

1030
01:02:08,749 --> 01:02:11,418
''Come to the roof top it's a matter of life and
death,'' by Johnny.

1031
01:02:18,649 --> 01:02:21,685
Johnny, what are you doing here?

1032
01:02:22,516 --> 01:02:22,516
lt's not your concern!

1033
01:02:23,716 --> 01:02:24,650
What else but jump!

1034
01:02:24,716 --> 01:02:25,817
l want to kill myself!

1035
01:02:26,015 --> 01:02:27,149
Take me, Lord!

1036
01:02:27,983 --> 01:02:32,220
What am l living for if you won't love me back?

1037
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:40,788
lf you can't love me, l'd rather kill myself and end
my misery!

1038
01:02:41,983 --> 01:02:45,753
Than see you in that man's arms!

1039
01:02:47,816 --> 01:02:47,816
ln this jump point, even your knees won't get
bruised!

1040
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:53,416
This is where you should jump! It's more
effective here!

1041
01:02:58,582 --> 01:02:59,349
Climb there!

1042
01:02:59,416 --> 01:03:00,283
Why do you care?

1043
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:00,349
l'm the one to commit suicide!

1044
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:05,819
l know you won't really kill yourself otherwise
you would have done it already.

1045
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:08,652
Why wait for me? So Jump!

1046
01:03:14,015 --> 01:03:14,015
ls this yours?

1047
01:03:14,949 --> 01:03:15,883
Yes!

1048
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:18,349
Don't you pity me?

1049
01:03:20,249 --> 01:03:20,249
Aren't you stopping me?

1050
01:03:22,082 --> 01:03:24,884
You should stop this madness!

1051
01:03:25,215 --> 01:03:25,215
l know this would hurt your feelings, but you're
not my type.

1052
01:03:28,716 --> 01:03:29,817
But why?

1053
01:03:30,582 --> 01:03:30,582
My handsome features bother you?

1054
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:35,017
That's right!

1055
01:03:35,516 --> 01:03:35,516
You're too much for me!

1056
01:03:37,649 --> 01:03:38,416
Really?

1057
01:03:38,616 --> 01:03:38,616
And l'm not worthy of you, that's why l think we
better be friends instead.

1058
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:48,583
That's a good idea.

1059
01:03:50,816 --> 01:03:52,450
Have a drink!

1060
01:03:55,616 --> 01:04:00,487
The funny thing is you've been trying to catch
Elizabeth...

1061
01:04:00,749 --> 01:04:04,819
and you end up the one being smitten, l mean
caught!

1062
01:04:05,149 --> 01:04:05,149
What barbeque?

1063
01:04:06,049 --> 01:04:09,085
You and your dad were caught in one hook!

1064
01:04:10,449 --> 01:04:10,449
You know this could be your last day in your job?

1065
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:13,382
You can't do that. l will tell your mother
eveything!

1066
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:20,785
You know this could be the last day of your life?

1067
01:04:22,349 --> 01:04:24,150
You know my problem?

1068
01:04:25,182 --> 01:04:31,388
What should l do? l know this looks bad but l'm
in love with my daddy's mistress.

1069
01:04:31,449 --> 01:04:32,983
That's not the issue you should wory about,
Boss.

1070
01:04:33,449 --> 01:04:41,690
Think of how will your mother react when she
finds out about you and her.

1071
01:04:41,749 --> 01:04:44,184
And she should know the truth.

1072
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:49,252
Who? Your mother or Elizabeth?

1073
01:04:53,315 --> 01:04:53,315
Sorry!

1074
01:04:54,115 --> 01:05:03,257
l can just imagine how your mother's face will get
uglier when she finds out about Elizabeth.

1075
01:05:07,816 --> 01:05:07,816
Water, boss!

1076
01:05:08,883 --> 01:05:11,318
- Water, boss. Give me water!
- Water?

1077
01:05:12,049 --> 01:05:15,719
Water, boss! Water, boss! l can't breathe!

1078
01:05:18,549 --> 01:05:22,719
Wait, l'm not yet through! l'm just getting an extra
rice.

1079
01:05:22,983 --> 01:05:22,983
You'll get fat!

1080
01:05:24,182 --> 01:05:29,186
Do you think he won't be mad on what l did at his
dad's funeral?

1081
01:05:30,215 --> 01:05:33,585
You only did that because you love him so much.

1082
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:33,916
Why will he get mad?

1083
01:05:35,582 --> 01:05:35,582
Besides, l'm also a man, l can tell he loves you
too. It's a matter oftiming.

1084
01:05:40,883 --> 01:05:46,054
You said you can feel his affection for you. Why
not do the first move?

1085
01:05:46,115 --> 01:05:49,017
We're with you all the way!

1086
01:05:49,482 --> 01:05:50,282
Go!

1087
01:05:50,482 --> 01:05:50,482
Right! Why don't you show him your door of
madness?

1088
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:55,784
End of conversation!

1089
01:05:59,716 --> 01:06:03,653
Run, Mac, run!

1090
01:06:03,716 --> 01:06:06,452
Catch me if you can!

1091
01:06:07,249 --> 01:06:09,851
''Hi.. Come to my place, l have something to
reveal.''

1092
01:06:13,883 --> 01:06:15,784
Good afternoon, sir!

1093
01:06:23,482 --> 01:06:29,921
What's this thing about, so important you can't
postpone for the next day?

1094
01:06:31,182 --> 01:06:33,050
l don't know where to start.

1095
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:42,724
Elizabeth, we're matured and experienced, you
can tell me eveything.

1096
01:06:43,649 --> 01:06:43,649
ls this about...

1097
01:06:45,249 --> 01:06:48,151
About us.

1098
01:06:48,215 --> 01:06:50,650
ls the feeling mutual?

1099
01:06:51,482 --> 01:06:51,482
l think so!

1100
01:06:53,082 --> 01:06:55,551
l love you, Elizabeth.

1101
01:06:56,549 --> 01:06:58,751
l love you too, John.

1102
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,450
l know!

1103
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:14,989
l know even if this won't look good, even if my
mommy opposes, l will fight for our love.

1104
01:07:16,883 --> 01:07:19,185
l don't understand.

1105
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:27,957
This is what we will do. Follow me in my room
and l will give you eveything there.

1106
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:30,350
Everything?

1107
01:07:31,149 --> 01:07:32,683
No more lies.

1108
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:35,050
No more hiding.

1109
01:07:35,549 --> 01:07:37,884
l will show you eveything inside.

1110
01:08:00,315 --> 01:08:02,784
This is it! l finally hit the jackpot!

1111
01:08:03,282 --> 01:08:04,416
Here we go!

1112
01:08:07,015 --> 01:08:08,383
There!

1113
01:08:12,816 --> 01:08:16,052
Are you ready, Elizabeth?

1114
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:52,916
John!

1115
01:09:02,182 --> 01:09:03,983
This is your revelation?

1116
01:09:04,482 --> 01:09:06,417
You're my stalker?

1117
01:09:07,649 --> 01:09:07,649
lt's embarrassing to admit that our daughter is so
mad about you but that's the truth.

1118
01:09:14,849 --> 01:09:14,849
Mother, that's love.

1119
01:09:20,349 --> 01:09:20,349
Love?

1120
01:09:21,482 --> 01:09:21,482
That's right! And you're even twice that obsessed
with me back then.

1121
01:09:25,282 --> 01:09:27,350
- That's not true!
- Right!

1122
01:09:29,282 --> 01:09:32,685
Now l know where l got it from.

1123
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:36,953
l'm so happy you're so obsessed with me.

1124
01:09:38,683 --> 01:09:40,618
ls that the reason you had an affair with my
daddy?

1125
01:09:40,683 --> 01:09:40,683
- Huh?
- What?

1126
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:41,816
What?

1127
01:09:42,649 --> 01:09:44,017
What are you talking about?

1128
01:09:44,282 --> 01:09:45,916
An affair? Her?

1129
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:46,783
Hey, when did this happen?

1130
01:09:49,816 --> 01:09:49,816
Why wasn't l informed about this? So that's why
your career is doing so well!

1131
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:55,217
You're a mistress!

1132
01:09:55,783 --> 01:09:57,951
Where did we go wrong?

1133
01:09:58,382 --> 01:10:00,117
We raised you well.

1134
01:10:01,482 --> 01:10:01,482
Why did you do this?

1135
01:10:03,082 --> 01:10:03,082
l worked day and night just to be able to earn
right and this is what you will repay us?

1136
01:10:08,716 --> 01:10:08,716
Wait!

1137
01:10:09,683 --> 01:10:09,683
- No! You're a liar!
- Hold it!

1138
01:10:11,516 --> 01:10:11,516
Be silent!!

1139
01:10:12,182 --> 01:10:14,384
Why are you judging me?

1140
01:10:14,883 --> 01:10:20,788
l didn't meet your father when he was alive! l only
met him at his funeral!

1141
01:10:21,115 --> 01:10:23,450
Why did you breakdown when he died?

1142
01:10:23,783 --> 01:10:25,317
No!

1143
01:10:25,482 --> 01:10:27,817
l thought it was you!

1144
01:10:28,282 --> 01:10:28,282
l went there because l saw the obituary.

1145
01:10:31,683 --> 01:10:31,683
But l didn't see the ''Senior''.

1146
01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:33,816
Yes, yes!

1147
01:10:35,349 --> 01:10:35,349
l'm so embarrassed. l can't do anything anymore
so l ran off.

1148
01:10:40,516 --> 01:10:40,516
Yes!

1149
01:10:41,049 --> 01:10:43,251
This is all a big misunderstanding!

1150
01:10:43,482 --> 01:10:44,616
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

1151
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:50,019
Now were screwed.

1152
01:10:51,249 --> 01:10:55,953
We thought you had an affair that's why we
followed you around.

1153
01:10:57,949 --> 01:11:00,918
lt seems all of you had a wrong assumption.

1154
01:11:01,749 --> 01:11:01,749
You know big sister, if stupidity can kill, big
brother would have been the eldest.

1155
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:10,916
That's right!

1156
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:10,983
Right!

1157
01:11:11,683 --> 01:11:11,683
You're right!

1158
01:11:12,716 --> 01:11:14,384
l think we need to talk.

1159
01:11:14,749 --> 01:11:14,749
Ok.

1160
01:11:15,949 --> 01:11:17,383
But get dressed first.

1161
01:11:19,182 --> 01:11:19,182
Lebron is no match with me. l'm an MVP that
time.

1162
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:19,449
Lebron is no match with me. l'm an MVP that
time.

1163
01:11:21,816 --> 01:11:23,350
Half court shot is a breeze!

1164
01:11:23,516 --> 01:11:23,516
- You're an MVP before?
- Excuse me.

1165
01:11:25,249 --> 01:11:25,249
- l'm the MVP!
- Excuse me.

1166
01:11:26,516 --> 01:11:28,150
- Cool!
- Excuse me!

1167
01:11:28,215 --> 01:11:28,215
You're so great, dude!

1168
01:11:29,516 --> 01:11:29,516
All you do here is talk and brag!

1169
01:11:31,749 --> 01:11:31,749
Madam, have a seat!

1170
01:11:33,649 --> 01:11:33,649
No need. l just came here to tell you, you're fired!

1171
01:11:37,716 --> 01:11:37,716
Because you're useless!

1172
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:40,050
You're good for nothing!

1173
01:11:40,115 --> 01:11:40,982
You're nothing!

1174
01:11:41,582 --> 01:11:42,549
Nothing!

1175
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:42,883
Goodbye.

1176
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:48,420
Elizabeth Pedrosa is your husband's mistress!

1177
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:48,916
l didn't want to tell you this because it might hurt
your feelings.

1178
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:51,849
But then, here are the pictures!

1179
01:11:54,382 --> 01:11:55,883
Can you handle this?

1180
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:56,149
Your husband's mistress is now your son's
girlfriend!

1181
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:00,015
Your son has been fooling you for the longest
time!

1182
01:12:02,883 --> 01:12:04,451
He's there in the pictures.

1183
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:10,922
For a million pesos, bring me to this girl!

1184
01:12:11,382 --> 01:12:14,651
- l can do it!
- Let me do it!

1185
01:12:14,983 --> 01:12:15,950
Good night.

1186
01:12:16,182 --> 01:12:17,082
Good night!

1187
01:12:17,315 --> 01:12:18,449
- Good night!
- l have to go.

1188
01:12:18,516 --> 01:12:18,516
- You're so sweet!
- Bye-bye!

1189
01:12:20,049 --> 01:12:20,883
- Take care!
- Good night!

1190
01:12:22,816 --> 01:12:22,816
- How sweet!
- Bye-bye!

1191
01:12:26,516 --> 01:12:27,917
Of course!

1192
01:12:30,382 --> 01:12:30,382
Call your men, Frosty!

1193
01:12:32,783 --> 01:12:33,383
Yes, madam!

1194
01:12:35,582 --> 01:12:37,517
Hey, why is this open?

1195
01:12:37,582 --> 01:12:37,582
- Lock it!
- l already locked it a while ago.

1196
01:12:39,115 --> 01:12:39,115
Let it be. Your father likes it that way.

1197
01:12:42,482 --> 01:12:42,482
Yes?

1198
01:12:43,349 --> 01:12:43,349
What's this? What's this?

1199
01:12:44,449 --> 01:12:44,449
- Hey! Hey!
- No!

1200
01:12:45,616 --> 01:12:45,616
Who are you?

1201
01:12:46,749 --> 01:12:47,950
- Hey! Hey! Wait!
- Get in!

1202
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,149
- l don't want to go with you!
- Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

1203
01:12:49,482 --> 01:12:50,616
Hey! Elizabeth!

1204
01:12:51,149 --> 01:12:52,283
Jack!

1205
01:12:52,716 --> 01:12:52,716
Hury up, hury up!

1206
01:12:54,049 --> 01:12:54,049
What happened?

1207
01:12:55,315 --> 01:12:57,684
Those men took Elizabeth!

1208
01:12:58,582 --> 01:12:58,582
Four men took Elizabeth just now! She's been
kidnapped!

1209
01:13:01,382 --> 01:13:01,382
Kidnapped?

1210
01:13:01,816 --> 01:13:01,816
- Yes, she's been kidnapped!
- Why was she kidnapped?

1211
01:13:02,816 --> 01:13:02,816
Who took her?

1212
01:13:03,349 --> 01:13:04,349
- Who...
- Wait!

1213
01:13:04,983 --> 01:13:04,983
What's wrong with you?

1214
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:06,549
What are you waiting for?

1215
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:07,549
Call the police!

1216
01:13:08,749 --> 01:13:10,050
They might kill my daughter!

1217
01:13:10,482 --> 01:13:12,417
Hey! Don't you dare!

1218
01:13:13,549 --> 01:13:13,549
Call the police!

1219
01:13:14,482 --> 01:13:14,482
Come on!

1220
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:16,717
- What are you three still doing there?
- Let's go!

1221
01:13:17,182 --> 01:13:18,049
Where am l?

1222
01:13:18,549 --> 01:13:19,850
Why did you kidnap me?

1223
01:13:20,382 --> 01:13:23,618
l'm not rich. My family can't pay the ransom.

1224
01:13:23,849 --> 01:13:24,616
Shut up!

1225
01:13:25,215 --> 01:13:27,050
l know that you're poor!

1226
01:13:27,482 --> 01:13:27,482
You're poorer than the beggar itself!

1227
01:13:29,683 --> 01:13:32,318
That's why you hooked with my filthy rich
husband!

1228
01:13:32,549 --> 01:13:32,549
l don't know what you're talking about!

1229
01:13:34,683 --> 01:13:34,683
Can you take off this blindfold so we can talk
better?

1230
01:13:37,849 --> 01:13:37,849
Shut up!

1231
01:13:39,182 --> 01:13:41,350
Why? Does your eyes do the talking?

1232
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:41,416
Can't you talk with your eyes blindfolded?

1233
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:43,916
l never got involved with a married man!

1234
01:13:46,049 --> 01:13:48,484
- You might have mistaken me for someone else!
- Shut up!

1235
01:13:48,949 --> 01:13:48,949
Goons, what are you waiting for?

1236
01:13:50,382 --> 01:13:55,520
Fondle her until she can't take it anymore!

1237
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:56,182
l don't want to, Ma'am.

1238
01:13:57,949 --> 01:13:57,949
We might end up in jail!

1239
01:13:58,816 --> 01:14:00,184
- What's with you, people?
- He's right.

1240
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:02,551
- Frosty you've been staring at her!
- Yes, madam?

1241
01:14:02,616 --> 01:14:02,616
l know you want her!

1242
01:14:03,949 --> 01:14:04,916
Here's your chance, go!

1243
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:04,983
Go!

1244
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:05,983
Madam, eww! She's not my type!

1245
01:14:09,783 --> 01:14:11,851
- You're all useless!
- Madam!

1246
01:14:12,182 --> 01:14:12,649
Madam!

1247
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:17,385
Yuck! To think l dress up in front of you!

1248
01:14:18,382 --> 01:14:19,783
Step aside!

1249
01:14:19,983 --> 01:14:21,084
What's happening to you?

1250
01:14:21,549 --> 01:14:21,549
Where's the acid?

1251
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:23,915
Hury!

1252
01:14:24,315 --> 01:14:24,882
Hury up!

1253
01:14:25,282 --> 01:14:26,783
Here you go, madam!

1254
01:14:27,416 --> 01:14:28,784
Oh!

1255
01:14:35,883 --> 01:14:35,883
What's happening?

1256
01:14:36,949 --> 01:14:38,483
Why isn't she burning?

1257
01:14:38,783 --> 01:14:41,652
She should be burning by now! Even me!

1258
01:14:42,282 --> 01:14:42,782
What's happening?

1259
01:14:42,849 --> 01:14:42,849
Madam, she should be possessed by the devil
first for her to burn.

1260
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:46,649
That's holy water, not acid!

1261
01:14:49,382 --> 01:14:50,983
Oh my god!

1262
01:14:51,649 --> 01:14:55,719
Feed her until she bursts!

1263
01:14:56,449 --> 01:14:58,450
- Oh, sir!
- Thank you.

1264
01:15:00,983 --> 01:15:03,719
Nanny, please prepare coffee for me!

1265
01:15:04,115 --> 01:15:05,249
Thank you!

1266
01:15:06,582 --> 01:15:07,316
Yes, sir!

1267
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:08,683
What's this?

1268
01:15:20,416 --> 01:15:21,550
Nanny!

1269
01:15:21,949 --> 01:15:21,949
Sir, we're watching ''Petra, the Horse''.

1270
01:15:24,349 --> 01:15:24,349
Where did these pictures come from?

1271
01:15:25,416 --> 01:15:29,887
lt was scattered in your mom's tent. l gathered
and brought them here.

1272
01:15:30,082 --> 01:15:31,450
Got to go, sir.

1273
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,449
lt's John Eduque!

1274
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:37,916
Hello!

1275
01:15:38,649 --> 01:15:38,649
Hello, Elizabeth!

1276
01:15:40,282 --> 01:15:40,282
No, this is Elizabeth's mom! She's been
kidnapped just now!

1277
01:15:45,516 --> 01:15:48,485
Four men took her!

1278
01:15:48,716 --> 01:15:48,716
Help us, please!

1279
01:15:51,249 --> 01:15:52,917
The cops are already here!

1280
01:15:55,382 --> 01:15:57,050
What's funny?

1281
01:15:58,449 --> 01:15:58,449
This wrong doing is caused by a wrong
assumption.

1282
01:16:02,749 --> 01:16:02,749
You know, l thought the one who died was your
son John...

1283
01:16:07,716 --> 01:16:15,356
who's my long time crush since college but when
l got there, l learned it was his dad!

1284
01:16:22,649 --> 01:16:22,649
- l don't know how it happened.
- John is here!

1285
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,215
What happened?

1286
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:26,783
Elizabeth was kidnapped by four men in blue
barongs!

1287
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:30,149
How do they look like?

1288
01:16:31,215 --> 01:16:33,517
They're all wearing black masks!

1289
01:16:35,015 --> 01:16:36,015
Black masks?

1290
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:39,983
Shut up!

1291
01:16:40,315 --> 01:16:40,315
Liar!

1292
01:16:41,382 --> 01:16:44,017
You ruined my family!

1293
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:46,984
You had an affair with my husband!

1294
01:16:47,049 --> 01:16:47,049
Now that he's dead and can't get anything from
him anymore...

1295
01:16:50,549 --> 01:16:52,984
you turned to my son for convenience!

1296
01:16:53,816 --> 01:16:55,717
User!

1297
01:16:58,282 --> 01:16:58,282
l admire your will imagination, madam!

1298
01:17:01,749 --> 01:17:14,828
l can't blame you for my exaggeration but believe
it or not, l haven't met your husband yet!

1299
01:17:16,315 --> 01:17:16,315
Great!

1300
01:17:17,649 --> 01:17:19,150
You're good!

1301
01:17:21,149 --> 01:17:22,550
Shut up!

1302
01:17:22,783 --> 01:17:25,519
Liar!

1303
01:17:27,983 --> 01:17:29,017
Great acting, ma'am!

1304
01:17:29,382 --> 01:17:29,382
- But wait...
- My phone is ringing!

1305
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:33,282
Hold it!

1306
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:36,117
Hold emotion!

1307
01:17:41,049 --> 01:17:41,049
Hello, John Jr., my son, how are you?

1308
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:46,050
hello, mom?

1309
01:17:46,115 --> 01:17:47,950
Did you have Elizabeth kidnapped?

1310
01:17:48,983 --> 01:17:48,983
Who's that girl?

1311
01:17:50,983 --> 01:17:50,983
Stop lying mom! You're the only one who has a
clear motive to do this!

1312
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:54,249
Don't do anything that you might regret!
Elizabeth has done nothing wrong!

1313
01:17:58,482 --> 01:17:58,482
lf l were you, l'd let her go!

1314
01:18:00,115 --> 01:18:00,115
John Jr., you don't know what you're saying!

1315
01:18:02,516 --> 01:18:06,586
That girl brainwashed you to think that way!

1316
01:18:08,549 --> 01:18:11,251
- It was my mom who had her kidnapped...
-What?

1317
01:18:11,516 --> 01:18:11,516
But l know where she is! She's in our backyard!

1318
01:18:14,049 --> 01:18:15,583
My mom's phone tracker is on!

1319
01:18:16,549 --> 01:18:17,783
Let's resume!

1320
01:18:18,282 --> 01:18:18,282
But this is the truth!

1321
01:18:20,683 --> 01:18:25,120
l'm not your husband's mistress!

1322
01:18:25,883 --> 01:18:27,818
Wow!

1323
01:18:33,783 --> 01:18:35,684
Ok, you're the best!

1324
01:18:36,015 --> 01:18:36,015
- Great!
- She's great, ma'am!

1325
01:18:37,349 --> 01:18:38,283
Grand slam!

1326
01:18:38,582 --> 01:18:39,683
You're good!

1327
01:18:44,749 --> 01:18:46,817
This way! This way!

1328
01:18:47,449 --> 01:18:48,716
There!

1329
01:18:50,015 --> 01:18:52,584
- Faster!
- This way!

1330
01:18:55,683 --> 01:18:56,650
Oh my god!

1331
01:18:56,883 --> 01:18:57,717
Sister!

1332
01:18:57,949 --> 01:18:57,949
- It's her!
- Sister!

1333
01:18:59,115 --> 01:18:59,115
- It's her! That's her!
- Sister!

1334
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:00,616
ls she the one?

1335
01:19:01,215 --> 01:19:02,316
- That's her!
- l'll take care of this!

1336
01:19:02,382 --> 01:19:02,382
l'll take care of this!

1337
01:19:03,482 --> 01:19:05,183
- Let me handle it!
- You can handle that!

1338
01:19:05,916 --> 01:19:06,650
Let's go!

1339
01:19:08,182 --> 01:19:09,850
- Let's go! Let's go!
- What?

1340
01:19:11,149 --> 01:19:13,451
John Jr., help me!

1341
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:15,850
Mom wait...

1342
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:17,817
What's this all about?

1343
01:19:20,015 --> 01:19:21,783
l can't believe you!

1344
01:19:22,349 --> 01:19:24,818
That girl totally twisted your brain!

1345
01:19:25,649 --> 01:19:28,518
You're such a disappointment!

1346
01:19:28,983 --> 01:19:33,587
But if you think this is over, you're mistaken!

1347
01:19:34,082 --> 01:19:39,053
l am your mother! You should know me better!

1348
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:44,351
There's madam!

1349
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:48,784
Where is she going? Is that it?

1350
01:19:49,049 --> 01:19:50,717
She won't get arrested?

1351
01:19:55,015 --> 01:19:59,319
l really want to apologize for what my mom did to
you.

1352
01:19:59,849 --> 01:20:05,354
l'm personally apologizing. As you can see, my
mother's state of mind is unstable.

1353
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:06,950
lsn't it obvious?

1354
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:08,549
She looks like a Shitsu!

1355
01:20:08,616 --> 01:20:08,616
Have her checked!

1356
01:20:10,349 --> 01:20:10,349
- By the vet!
- By the veterinarian!

1357
01:20:11,549 --> 01:20:11,549
That's right!

1358
01:20:12,783 --> 01:20:12,783
lt's alright. l'm sorry again for the inconvenience.

1359
01:20:17,582 --> 01:20:19,116
You can go now.

1360
01:20:19,182 --> 01:20:19,182
Alright.

1361
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:20,182
What?

1362
01:20:21,015 --> 01:20:21,015
- What?
- Wait!

1363
01:20:22,249 --> 01:20:22,249
ls that it?

1364
01:20:23,749 --> 01:20:27,686
- What if she does it again?
- No! It won't happen again.

1365
01:20:28,015 --> 01:20:31,151
l will be responsible. That's a promise! Promise!

1366
01:20:32,115 --> 01:20:33,516
Ok.

1367
01:20:34,282 --> 01:20:34,282
Alright. Thank you.

1368
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:37,816
Ok, ma'am.

1369
01:20:42,816 --> 01:20:43,783
Take care.

1370
01:20:46,683 --> 01:20:49,018
Maxine, hot coffee please!

1371
01:20:49,182 --> 01:20:49,182
Ma'am Elizabeth, as much as l want to follow
your requests, l'm afraid, l can't.

1372
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,483
What are you talking about?

1373
01:20:57,816 --> 01:20:59,584
Why is my office locked?

1374
01:20:59,783 --> 01:20:59,783
l've been trying to call you but your cellphone
cannot be reached.

1375
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:02,983
l'm sory Elizabeth but Mrs. Eduque talked to the
owner of the company...

1376
01:21:06,983 --> 01:21:06,983
Here's the memo.

1377
01:21:08,082 --> 01:21:09,716
She wants you fired.

1378
01:21:09,783 --> 01:21:10,884
What?

1379
01:21:14,015 --> 01:21:17,551
That witch is way overboard!

1380
01:21:18,449 --> 01:21:20,117
This is not acceptable!

1381
01:21:25,849 --> 01:21:25,849
Mrs. Melvie?

1382
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:29,485
Hi, Elizabeth! Hello!

1383
01:21:30,249 --> 01:21:30,249
Mrs. Melvie, do we have problems with the
checks?

1384
01:21:33,182 --> 01:21:37,886
Nothing. l just want to talk to you personally.

1385
01:21:38,282 --> 01:21:40,984
Sure, l'm here at the condominium right now.

1386
01:21:41,616 --> 01:21:41,616
Me too, l'm here at the condominium.

1387
01:21:44,282 --> 01:21:45,883
Mrs. Melvie!

1388
01:21:46,049 --> 01:21:48,918
There you are! My child...

1389
01:21:48,983 --> 01:21:51,852
- Would you like to come in?
- No need!

1390
01:21:52,349 --> 01:21:52,349
l would like to apologize to you because l'm
giving you back the checks you gave me.

1391
01:21:59,683 --> 01:21:59,683
Why?

1392
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:02,150
Somebody already bought the unit.

1393
01:22:02,215 --> 01:22:02,215
- What?
- Yes.

1394
01:22:03,649 --> 01:22:03,649
Why did you sell it? We still have a contract.

1395
01:22:06,416 --> 01:22:06,416
l'm really ashamed about this, my child.

1396
01:22:09,115 --> 01:22:09,115
Forgive me but l can't refuse the offer which is
ten times more than the actual price.

1397
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:16,849
And this offer doesn't come eveyday especially
during this hard times.

1398
01:22:21,683 --> 01:22:21,683
ls that so?

1399
01:22:23,082 --> 01:22:24,049
Yes.

1400
01:22:24,849 --> 01:22:27,051
When do you want me to move out?

1401
01:22:27,115 --> 01:22:27,115
Would it be possible by tomorrow?

1402
01:22:28,883 --> 01:22:28,883
Tomorrow?

1403
01:22:30,249 --> 01:22:33,585
Mrs. Eduque is already excited!

1404
01:22:33,883 --> 01:22:34,984
Mrs. Eduque?

1405
01:22:35,182 --> 01:22:36,049
Yes!

1406
01:22:36,115 --> 01:22:36,115
The owner of the airlines?

1407
01:22:37,516 --> 01:22:37,516
Why, would you like to meet her?

1408
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:39,416
l'd rather not! l might punch her!

1409
01:22:41,883 --> 01:22:41,883
Tell her l will have her fixed by tomorrow!

1410
01:22:45,616 --> 01:22:46,683
Fix her?

1411
01:22:47,716 --> 01:22:50,285
l mean, l'll have my things fixed!

1412
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:51,049
Are you aware that under article 457, what you're
doing is wrong and against the law?

1413
01:22:51,449 --> 01:22:58,556
Are you aware that under article 457, what you're
doing is wrong and against the law?

1414
01:22:58,983 --> 01:22:58,983
Betty what's going on here?

1415
01:23:00,983 --> 01:23:00,983
Sister, this vendor doesn't want to sell us his
fishball!

1416
01:23:05,616 --> 01:23:05,616
Why? You still have plenty of stocks to sell?

1417
01:23:08,849 --> 01:23:10,850
Are they spoiled already?

1418
01:23:11,049 --> 01:23:12,583
Spoiled?

1419
01:23:12,949 --> 01:23:13,983
Spoiled already?

1420
01:23:14,349 --> 01:23:14,349
You're forbidden to buy!

1421
01:23:16,215 --> 01:23:16,215
From your parents to your grandchildren up to
the third generation, you're all forbidden to buy!

1422
01:23:19,916 --> 01:23:21,050
But why?

1423
01:23:21,115 --> 01:23:24,284
That's Doña Belinda's orders!

1424
01:23:24,549 --> 01:23:25,149
What?

1425
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:25,416
- She owns even this?
- Yes! All of it! All vendors belong to her!

1426
01:23:31,015 --> 01:23:32,449
What's the commotion all about?

1427
01:23:32,516 --> 01:23:32,516
Father, let's just go inside. My mother-in-law is
behind it again!

1428
01:23:38,249 --> 01:23:42,252
lt's ok Betty. l'll be the one to cook fishball for
you.

1429
01:23:42,816 --> 01:23:42,816
We will sue you!

1430
01:23:44,282 --> 01:23:46,851
- Me too!
- ''Me too!'' Would you like me to fry you?

1431
01:23:48,916 --> 01:23:48,916
l'm really sory Elizabeth. l'm sure you could find
another job.

1432
01:23:53,416 --> 01:23:55,050
- Ok. Thank you.
- Ok.

1433
01:23:55,416 --> 01:23:57,885
- Ok, just put it there.
- Ok.

1434
01:23:57,949 --> 01:23:57,949
Hello!

1435
01:23:58,816 --> 01:23:58,816
- Bye now.
- Elizabeth we don't have food anymore.

1436
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:00,749
What?

1437
01:24:01,616 --> 01:24:01,616
l don't understand.

1438
01:24:03,015 --> 01:24:05,183
We don't have anything to eat!

1439
01:24:05,683 --> 01:24:05,683
l've been to three markets and five grocey
stores. Nobody wants to sell me anything.

1440
01:24:12,382 --> 01:24:16,185
And that's because Doña Eduque owns it all!

1441
01:24:16,783 --> 01:24:19,752
What's happening, my child?

1442
01:24:19,949 --> 01:24:25,487
l'm sory, mom. l didn't know that she's the
devil's cousin.

1443
01:24:25,649 --> 01:24:25,649
John already told her everything but still, she
doesn't want to believe.

1444
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:30,983
Don't worry, mom. l'll fix this. Promise.

1445
01:24:34,082 --> 01:24:35,216
Alright.

1446
01:24:35,549 --> 01:24:37,384
- Bye, Ma.
- Bye, Elizabeth.

1447
01:24:41,616 --> 01:24:42,283
Mom!

1448
01:24:43,082 --> 01:24:44,016
Mom!

1449
01:24:45,015 --> 01:24:45,682
Mom!

1450
01:24:46,249 --> 01:24:47,350
Where's mommy?

1451
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:50,151
l saw her came in a while ago.

1452
01:24:50,616 --> 01:24:51,616
So where is she?

1453
01:24:51,816 --> 01:24:53,050
Maybe she went out!

1454
01:24:53,616 --> 01:24:54,483
Wow!

1455
01:25:00,683 --> 01:25:01,550
Mom?

1456
01:25:02,849 --> 01:25:05,051
Mom, what are you doing there?

1457
01:25:09,215 --> 01:25:12,217
lsn't it obvious? l'm hiding from you.

1458
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:12,482
Because you know what you did!

1459
01:25:14,616 --> 01:25:14,616
l did nothing wrong! l'm just asking forjustice!

1460
01:25:17,749 --> 01:25:17,749
Ask for justice if she has done you wrong!

1461
01:25:20,516 --> 01:25:20,516
But we are the ones who did wrong... Wrong
accusations!

1462
01:25:24,082 --> 01:25:24,082
Mom, this all happened because of a wrong
assumption.

1463
01:25:26,582 --> 01:25:26,582
She thought l was the one who died! We thought
she was daddy's mistress!

1464
01:25:30,749 --> 01:25:34,252
Now that everything is clear, can we put all of
this behind us and be happy?

1465
01:25:35,582 --> 01:25:40,053
You're the only one who's happy and that's
because that golddigger lured you!

1466
01:25:40,382 --> 01:25:40,382
You're just like your father! Easy to fool!

1467
01:25:43,149 --> 01:25:43,983
Mom, wait!

1468
01:25:44,749 --> 01:25:45,483
Please!

1469
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:50,053
What must l do to stop you from being
Elizabeth's antagonist?

1470
01:25:50,616 --> 01:25:52,684
She's miserable!

1471
01:25:53,883 --> 01:25:55,384
Break up with her!

1472
01:25:56,015 --> 01:25:57,883
Get rid of her!

1473
01:25:58,749 --> 01:25:58,749
And l will be okay.

1474
01:26:00,482 --> 01:26:04,552
ln the meantime John Jr., you know where to find
me!

1475
01:26:11,149 --> 01:26:15,386
The food is good! And this restaurant is first
class!

1476
01:26:16,449 --> 01:26:16,449
l'm glad you agreed to go out on a date with me!

1477
01:26:19,382 --> 01:26:23,786
This is not a date. It just so happened that l ran
into you and l'm about to grab a bite.

1478
01:26:23,849 --> 01:26:25,884
l know for a fact that l'll be paying for this!

1479
01:26:26,049 --> 01:26:27,183
lf you insist!

1480
01:26:28,582 --> 01:26:31,518
You look sad again.

1481
01:26:32,015 --> 01:26:35,451
There is a solution to all your problems.

1482
01:26:35,516 --> 01:26:36,083
What?

1483
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:36,416
Marry me, so you can go back to the
condominium...

1484
01:26:41,949 --> 01:26:41,949
All you have to wory is to find a job.

1485
01:26:44,149 --> 01:26:44,149
Come on Johnny, stop bragging around.

1486
01:26:46,482 --> 01:26:46,482
l know for a fact that you're just a caretaker
there.

1487
01:26:49,082 --> 01:26:49,082
And another thing...

1488
01:26:50,282 --> 01:26:50,282
- l know how much you're earning.
- Be quiet!

1489
01:26:52,783 --> 01:26:52,783
Do you want me to shout it out?

1490
01:26:55,416 --> 01:26:55,416
Be quiet!

1491
01:26:56,516 --> 01:26:56,516
l've been riding along with your charade for the
Iongest time so spare me!

1492
01:26:59,783 --> 01:26:59,783
And if you don't want me to get pissed, just listen
to my problems!

1493
01:27:03,382 --> 01:27:05,951
Okay, fine, happy trip!

1494
01:27:06,282 --> 01:27:06,282
On the other hand, you're right. l should've
stayed away.

1495
01:27:11,215 --> 01:27:16,887
Because for as long as his mother is still alive,
we will have no peace.

1496
01:27:19,315 --> 01:27:23,719
Madam, your favorite soap opera is playing.

1497
01:27:24,849 --> 01:27:28,752
My son betrayed me because of that girl!

1498
01:27:29,082 --> 01:27:32,051
l have to get rid of her!

1499
01:27:32,382 --> 01:27:32,382
Madam, are you referring to your favorite soap
opera or is that for real?

1500
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:38,183
Watch out!

1501
01:27:38,716 --> 01:27:40,084
Elizabeth!

1502
01:27:42,315 --> 01:27:46,886
Elizabeth, l hope you're not serious when you
texted me that you're leaving me.

1503
01:27:52,049 --> 01:28:01,191
l don't want to do this. l've loved you eversince
we were young...

1504
01:28:03,716 --> 01:28:06,785
And that won't ever change.

1505
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:16,590
But your mother is persistent in punishing me...
in destroying me.

1506
01:28:18,649 --> 01:28:26,156
lf it's just me, l can take it but what if she turns
on my family?

1507
01:28:26,649 --> 01:28:29,251
l told you, l'll take care of this.

1508
01:28:29,916 --> 01:28:29,916
Please, just give me time.

1509
01:28:31,382 --> 01:28:35,219
You, yourself, told me that your mother never
listens.

1510
01:28:35,983 --> 01:28:39,519
That she won't listen to any explanation...

1511
01:28:39,949 --> 01:28:42,251
She won't give in!

1512
01:28:42,883 --> 01:28:45,051
ls that why you'll let go?

1513
01:28:51,683 --> 01:28:54,152
For eveyone's sake...

1514
01:28:56,082 --> 01:28:58,417
Somebody has to give in.

1515
01:29:01,215 --> 01:29:04,184
And at times when no one wants to give in...

1516
01:29:06,783 --> 01:29:08,951
Let me be the one to do it.

1517
01:29:12,749 --> 01:29:20,156
l love you so much, John. That will never change.

1518
01:29:30,449 --> 01:29:32,884
You're so talkative!

1519
01:29:32,949 --> 01:29:35,284
Why not on your sharp chin?

1520
01:29:50,015 --> 01:29:51,516
Where are my cars?

1521
01:29:51,983 --> 01:29:51,983
Where are my other cars?

1522
01:29:53,983 --> 01:29:53,983
Madam, the $ cars are outside the other two are
at the casa.

1523
01:29:56,883 --> 01:29:58,517
Where is my son?

1524
01:30:00,983 --> 01:30:04,519
John Jr., l've been looking for you!

1525
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:04,983
Are you hungry?

1526
01:30:06,716 --> 01:30:06,716
Let's eat dinner!

1527
01:30:08,015 --> 01:30:08,915
Where do you wanna go?

1528
01:30:08,983 --> 01:30:10,651
You wanna go to Hongkong?

1529
01:30:10,949 --> 01:30:10,949
l'll stay here.

1530
01:30:12,049 --> 01:30:12,049
What will you do here?

1531
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:13,649
Waste your time?

1532
01:30:14,749 --> 01:30:14,749
You're going to rot in here?

1533
01:30:16,616 --> 01:30:16,616
Are you going after that girl?

1534
01:30:18,616 --> 01:30:22,953
That girl who's a mistress and a golddigger!

1535
01:30:23,783 --> 01:30:26,652
But l understand you. You're a man!

1536
01:30:26,716 --> 01:30:31,687
Enjoy her! And leave her afterwards.

1537
01:30:33,683 --> 01:30:37,086
You still don't get it, Ma.

1538
01:30:39,916 --> 01:30:44,787
Why can't you just accept the fact that we were
wrong about Elizabeth?

1539
01:30:47,749 --> 01:30:49,650
Don't you believe her?

1540
01:30:51,849 --> 01:30:57,888
Or is it right to say that you can't accept the fact
that you're the one who's at fault?

1541
01:30:58,516 --> 01:31:02,720
Maybe you're just too embarrassed because
you're wrong?

1542
01:31:05,449 --> 01:31:13,757
This is embarrassing but we have to live with it
even though it's your fault.

1543
01:31:15,883 --> 01:31:18,218
Even at the expense of ruining other people's
lives.

1544
01:31:21,149 --> 01:31:27,488
Well, congratulations. Elizabeth and l broke up.

1545
01:31:30,416 --> 01:31:32,317
l hope you're happy now.

1546
01:31:35,315 --> 01:31:37,350
First, it's daddy...

1547
01:31:38,482 --> 01:31:42,018
Elizabeth? She's out of my life.

1548
01:31:44,315 --> 01:31:50,387
Just don't wait for the time that l will be out of
your life too.

1549
01:31:51,916 --> 01:31:53,817
Please...

1550
01:32:19,616 --> 01:32:19,616
Chichay!

1551
01:32:20,683 --> 01:32:23,552
Menggay! Pochay! Aruray! Frosty!

1552
01:32:23,949 --> 01:32:25,216
Where is it?

1553
01:32:25,649 --> 01:32:26,916
Where is it?

1554
01:32:27,382 --> 01:32:28,483
Where is it?

1555
01:32:28,783 --> 01:32:30,050
- Where is it?
- Madam!

1556
01:32:30,115 --> 01:32:30,115
Did you find it? Where is it?

1557
01:32:32,449 --> 01:32:32,449
Did you find it? Where is it? Did you see it?

1558
01:32:35,582 --> 01:32:35,582
Madam, we searched all over...

1559
01:32:37,916 --> 01:32:37,916
lf you didn't call us, we'd still be looking...

1560
01:32:41,182 --> 01:32:41,182
But there's nothing!

1561
01:32:42,149 --> 01:32:42,149
Look for it!

1562
01:32:44,582 --> 01:32:44,582
lt's hard to look for something...

1563
01:32:45,716 --> 01:32:45,716
- when you don't know what you're looking for.
- Stop answering back! Look for it!

1564
01:32:48,783 --> 01:32:48,783
Madam, maybe you're the one who's lost...

1565
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:53,617
That's right.

1566
01:32:55,349 --> 01:32:56,750
Yourself?

1567
01:33:02,115 --> 01:33:06,552
Me? l'm losing my mind?

1568
01:33:06,983 --> 01:33:06,983
You think so?

1569
01:33:08,582 --> 01:33:12,218
You've been like that eversince your husband
died.

1570
01:33:12,582 --> 01:33:13,382
Yes, madam.

1571
01:33:14,015 --> 01:33:14,015
l've wanted to call the Mental Hospital and have
you confined.

1572
01:33:16,816 --> 01:33:16,816
- Really?
- That's true!

1573
01:33:18,416 --> 01:33:18,416
Sometimes, you're like a mad dog drooling all
over, ma'am.

1574
01:33:22,349 --> 01:33:23,583
Really?

1575
01:33:26,616 --> 01:33:26,616
Yes, madam...

1576
01:33:28,749 --> 01:33:28,749
We're worried about you, madam...

1577
01:33:30,449 --> 01:33:32,050
Well, l'm sorry.

1578
01:33:32,449 --> 01:33:37,020
l'm sory. From now on, l won't go mad.

1579
01:33:37,382 --> 01:33:37,382
- That's a relief, madam.
- You don't have to take me to the Rehab...

1580
01:33:40,649 --> 01:33:43,952
- and l won't drool anymore...
- Thank you, madam!

1581
01:33:44,015 --> 01:33:44,015
But you're all going to lose yourjob for being
nosy bastards!

1582
01:33:49,883 --> 01:33:53,353
You're all so fired! Out of my way!

1583
01:34:09,249 --> 01:34:09,249
No John! No! No, John, no please...

1584
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:17,151
- Madam?
- No! No, John, no...

1585
01:34:18,015 --> 01:34:18,015
What are you doing there?

1586
01:34:19,149 --> 01:34:19,149
l'm going to take this away because you said you
don't want to see his face.

1587
01:34:22,816 --> 01:34:24,450
l don't want to see your face either!

1588
01:34:24,516 --> 01:34:24,516
Put it at the attic now!

1589
01:34:26,449 --> 01:34:27,516
Yes, madam!

1590
01:34:34,716 --> 01:34:36,084
What are you doing here?

1591
01:34:36,482 --> 01:34:38,584

Oh brother, it's in our blood to be like that. That's
why l don't want to grow old like them.

How can you say that here is where it all began,
you don't even know me then.

You don't even notice me, so what sweet
memories are we going to remember here?

1694
01:42:48,949 --> 01:42:51,351
You'll just make me suffer!

01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:53,317
Wait, l'm just kidding!

1696
01:42:53,549 --> 01:42:53,549
So you're just kidding?

1697
01:42:54,983 --> 01:42:57,218
No! It was just a joke.

1698
01:42:57,582 --> 01:42:59,550
So you're not serious with me?

The sun is scorching hot, you want it to rain?

That's what l want!

1710
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:47,854

and we're dripping wet.
