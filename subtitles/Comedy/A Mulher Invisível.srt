1
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:54,127
"118:8"

2
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:09,103
Perhaps this might be too absurd for you,
but I love my wife.

3
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,869
I'm faithful to her.
I want to have kids with her.

4
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:17,344
I want to grow old by her side.

5
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:21,276
Got it?

6
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:31,287
THE INVISIBLE WOMAN

7
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:42,263
Honey?
Hi, honey!

8
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,614
Love of my life!
I'm home!

9
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:06,055
Honey?

10
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:09,018
Where are you?

11
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:12,659
Hey, gorgeous!

12
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,633
I cleared 3 streets to get here early.

13
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:30,005
Pedro, I want a divorce.

14
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:38,119
You want to divorce me? Why?

15
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:41,324
- You're the greatest guy in the world.
- And?

16
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:49,162
Our life is tranquil,
harmonious, calm...

17
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:52,363
- And?
- It's smothering me.

18
00:04:58,378 --> 00:04:59,037
Marina!

19
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:02,513
Marina!

20
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,841
It can't be! Why?

21
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:08,183
Because I wanted more excitement.

22
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:09,279
But why?

23
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,756
Because women become unhappy
when their leading happy lives.

24
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:15,953
I can make you unhappy,
if that makes you happy!

25
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,197
I'll do anything for you!

26
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:24,198
I'm pregnant.

27
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:29,608
But that's wonderful.

28
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:34,441
- No, it's not.
- But why not, honey?

29
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:36,379
Because you're not the father.

30
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:40,285
What do you mean,
"you're not the father?"

31
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:46,253
Pedro...

32
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:53,699
This is Johann.

33
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:58,396
Listen up, pal. We need to have
a talk, man to man.

34
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:00,998
He's German and doesn't speak
a word in Portuguese.

35
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:02,905
- Hallo.
- "Hallo", my ass!

36
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:04,432
- Ja.
- "Ja", my ass!

37
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:08,013
- How can you be sure the kid isn't mine?
- I got tested.

38
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:13,481
We're going to Germany tonight.
He'll send for my things, next week.

39
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,011
- How long has this been going on?
- Six months.

40
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:19,319
-God, the conference in Fortaleza!
- The conference in Fortaleza!

41
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:21,926
He came to Brazil
to carry out a merger.

42
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,895
And he did:
Carrying you away from my life!

43
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:25,396
Marina, ist das alles klar hier?

44
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:28,865
I'll take her bag. I'll take her bag.
I'll take her bag.

45
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:32,235
Can I at least have the pleasure
of carrying your suitcase?

46
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:33,536
Listen!

47
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:35,934
How could you do this to me?

48
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:38,535
How could you not see
that I was doing this to you?

49
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:42,478
- I don't know who you are, Marina.
- You looked at me

50
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:44,506
and only saw what you wanted to.

51
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:46,881
I've been dedicating my life for you
for six years.

52
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:50,389
You live inside your own dream
of a perfect life.

53
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,750
There isn't room for anything
that doesn't fit in it.

54
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,856
I felt lonely. It was as if everything I did,
didn't matter at all.

55
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:03,661
As if I was invisible.

56
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:40,537
Come on you zombie. Wake up!

57
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:44,008
- Wake up.
- Oh, Marina, Marina...

58
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,203
Marina? What Marina?

59
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:48,771
Marina, the most wonderful woman
in the world.

60
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:54,047
No! No! Sit up. Sit up.
Sit up. Sit up.

61
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:57,948
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm with you. Look at me.

62
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:00,551
Look at me.
Marina is a slut.

63
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:02,618
Say it. Say it. Let it out.

64
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:05,960
Let it out: Marina is a slut.

65
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,327
- Marina is a slut.
- Exactly!

66
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:11,403
And dumped you 3 weeks ago.
Look at me.

67
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:13,129
She's moved on

68
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:16,801
and it's time for you to do the same.
Get up.

69
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:17,873
Get up!

70
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:31,785
This is crazy!

71
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,490
It's absurd!

72
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,188
It's 8:15 AM!

73
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:41,029
Pedro, the time is now!
Right now, Pedro!

74
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:47,868
Welcome to the wonderful world
of bachelordom, Pedro.

75
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:53,240
Stalk, sniff, attack
and go for the kill, Pedro!

76
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,478
Go!

77
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:56,277
Go!

78
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:09,793
Pedro!

79
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:12,296
Pedro!

80
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:16,368
Sorry, I don't remember you.

81
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:19,266
Carla. From the 8th grade.

82
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:21,464
Skinny Carla?

83
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:25,374
You're looking awesome
with these lights all over your body.

84
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:28,976
Kiss me on the lips!

85
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:30,476
Kiss me!

86
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:45,797
Do you know you're the second man
I've had sex with in my life?

87
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,695
But why me?

88
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:53,137
I've always thought
you were a sensitive guy.

89
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:58,106
I've got something to tell you.

90
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:04,374
You know, I've had it
with datingjiu-jitsu wrestlers.

91
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:11,347
I see dead people all the time.

92
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,357
Right here, right now.
Right next to you.

93
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,635
I'm going to be your child's mother.

94
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:32,041
And I'm going to be
your son's mother's wife.

95
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:35,069
Unfortunately,
I'm not my own son's father.

96
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:37,878
- Let's go!
- Idiot! Party pooper!

97
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:51,995
Cops have no life,
cops are always on the job.

98
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:54,827
Cops do not have kids!

99
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,170
Barata Ribeiro blocked.
TKS.

100
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,906
- Hello!
- I give up!

101
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:12,382
-Give up what?
- Everything. Tell Nogueira...

102
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,850
that Rio can drown
in its own trafficjams.

103
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:15,649
Wait a second...

104
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:17,517
And I don't want to screw
anyone anymore!

105
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:20,125
Are you... Dude!
Dude, wait!

106
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:28,092
I don't ever want to see
a woman in my life again.

107
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:38,535
3 MONTHS LATER

108
00:11:58,097 --> 00:12:00,930
Lonely in time...

109
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:05,170
Loneliness...

110
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:27,949
Marina, I never noticed you

111
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:35,298
because you never existed.

112
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:39,161
Goodbye.

113
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:42,864
I'm sorry.

114
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,371
No problem. It's just that no one
has knocked here in a while.

115
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:52,676
It's all right.
Sometimes I also disappear.

116
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:57,812
- And you are?
- Amanda. Your neighbor.

117
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:01,412
I've never seen you before.

118
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:06,787
I moved in just a month ago,
and you don't get out much, right?

119
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:10,125
Me? Yeah.
I'm taking a break from the world.

120
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:11,925
Working some things out.

121
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:15,929
- I could come later.
- No.

122
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:18,126
How can I help you?

123
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,106
A cup of sugar.

124
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:25,709
I couldn't sleep

125
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:29,542
and when that happens,
I need to have some cake.

126
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:33,245
Then I realized I was out of sugar
and I was afraid of not sleeping.

127
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:34,183
Then I thought,

128
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,418
"I'm not going out to buy sugar at this
hour in such a violent city as this. "

129
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:43,292
I thought I could ask a neighbor.
But I don't know anyone here.

130
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:49,530
But then I heard some strange noises
coming from your apartment.

131
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,794
- From in here?
- Yeah.

132
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:57,739
- Oh, it's just that I was... singing.
- That's right!

133
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,938
Then I thought,
"that's what neighbors are for. "

134
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:03,311
So I decided to give it a shot.

135
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:10,017
- Do you have any?
- Do I have any what?

136
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:18,330
- Sugar.
- Yes, come on inside.

137
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:33,807
Candlelight is beautiful, isn't it?

138
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:37,942
Yeah. They cut off my electricity
not so long ago.

139
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:43,010
They also cut my phone, but that's OK.
I never used it.

140
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:47,083
It's going to be really tough
when they take away the candles.

141
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:51,563
Sugar...

142
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:58,128
The food is starting to go bad in the fridge,
but I still have some sugar.

143
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:04,335
You're funny.

144
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:07,869
- You think so?
- I do.

145
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:21,249
My goodness! You're beautiful!

146
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,988
And so are you.

147
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:44,416
Die, monster, die!

148
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,720
And now...

149
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,191
it's time.

150
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:07,204
I have killed my sole companion
in this cave!

151
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,865
I killed the wolf,
but I'm going to die alone!

152
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:13,711
Alone!

153
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:15,606
Out!

154
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:19,678
It was astonishing, sis.
Astonishing.

155
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,286
It was a disaster, Lúcia.

156
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:26,053
No, they're kids. They will have
forgotten it all by tomorrow.

157
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,457
That was a bad idea
to write a play for kids!

158
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:32,721
What's wrong?

159
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:39,360
- Márcio got laid off from the bank.
- Oh!

160
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:43,306
There was a merger, and because
he was over 40, they fired him.

161
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:47,440
- What are you going to do now?
- He's working for me now.

162
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,774
These kiddie parties are what
are paying our bills, you know.

163
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:56,043
My God,
that guy is still checking you out.

164
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:58,554
That's horrible, Lúcia.
It's been only 3 months since...

165
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:01,650
Since what?
Since the pig died?

166
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:03,286
I practically killed him.

167
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:06,662
Because you didn't heed your master's call
when he wanted you to do it?

168
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:09,166
No, because I was...

169
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:13,469
eavesdropping on my neighbors
as my husband lay dying.

170
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:16,871
Didn't the doctor tell you
a million times that it was sudden?

171
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:20,275
That there was nothing you could do?
It was a massive heart attack.

172
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:23,907
God, you should go partying,
should be celebrating now,

173
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:28,043
looking for a new job,
going back to school,

174
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,484
fooling around with...

175
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:33,353
that incredible man
who can't take his eyes off you.

176
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:36,156
But if you don't want him,
go screw your neighbor.

177
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:38,456
He wants to be left alone.

178
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:41,762
He withdrew from the world
because of love.

179
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:43,996
This is the perfect moment
to make a move...

180
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:47,537
because when men don't get any
for a long time,

181
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,403
they go crazy.
The time is now.

182
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:52,636
I can't simply go and knock on his door
just like that.

183
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:57,538
Use the old "I need sugar" line.
It works great.

184
00:18:57,683 --> 00:18:59,480
That's ridiculous.

185
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:03,249
You better do it now
before another woman beats you to it.

186
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:32,875
Good morning.

187
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:35,342
Good morning.

188
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,551
Here.
This is going to be good for you.

189
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:43,357
- Am I supposed to eat that?
- Yes.

190
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:45,953
- What is it?
- Soup. Chicken soup.

191
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:50,365
- What?
- Chicken soup. Have some.

192
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:55,630
- What is this place?
- Your apartment.

193
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:58,766
- It looks so different.
- I tidied it up a bit.

194
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:00,705
And you are?

195
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:05,773
Your neighbor.
Remember the cup of sugar?

196
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:13,581
What happened?

197
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:16,752
I'm not sure whether you fell asleep
or just passed out.

198
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:20,162
I was going to call for a doctor,
but you seemed fine.

199
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:22,223
You had a smile on your face
the whole time.

200
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:25,759
- For how long did I sleep?
- A couple of days.

201
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:29,671
- A couple of days? What about you?
- I left and then came back.

202
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,073
I thought I could take care of you.

203
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:42,544
I dreamt about you.

204
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,923
I've also been dreaming about you, too.

205
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:50,753
I mean...

206
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:55,294
I couldn't help it.
The way we met.

207
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:57,958
I had this weird feeling...

208
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,504
as if I was part of you.

209
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:02,973
I'm feeling the same thing.

210
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:06,305
Then you passed out and I put in bed.

211
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:09,414
I looked around your apartment
and I decided to help out.

212
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:13,007
I threw away the pizza boxes,
the empty bottles,

213
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:14,849
and cleaned up the kitchen.

214
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:19,290
Then I saw your papers lying around
and I felt like tidying it up.

215
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:27,059
That's when I saw the photos,
the poems, the letters...

216
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,357
so many letters...

217
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:32,300
you must have loved her very much.

218
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:35,339
I envied her.

219
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:38,133
Please don't talk like that. I can't take it.

220
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:41,678
- I know. I'll be going now.
- No, wait. Go on. I cut you off.

221
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:43,073
It's just that...

222
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:46,448
- I'm embarrassed by what happened.
- Please, go on.

223
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:48,346
What happened?

224
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,085
I read your letters to Marina.

225
00:21:56,695 --> 00:22:01,462
- You read my letters?
- Yes.

226
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:06,429
I think you're the most amazing
man in the world.

227
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,373
I think you wrote like a god.

228
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,008
And any woman who reads what
you've written

229
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:16,308
would certainly
fall in love with you.

230
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,012
I feel great.

231
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,916
I feel great.

232
00:22:30,295 --> 00:22:32,024
I feel great.

233
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,791
I feel great.
I feel great!

234
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:41,101
Who are you? Who are you?

235
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:44,905
I am the same as you.

236
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,716
I am loneliness in search of companionship...

237
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:54,148
I am tenderness
in search of affection...

238
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:59,351
I'm a woman in search of a husband,
a father for my children...

239
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,961
Someone who wants to love, to build,
to work and to live in peace.

240
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:09,090
Away from
all the madness in this world.

241
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:13,169
I want someone to share
the adventure that is life.

242
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:39,389
And most of all...

243
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:03,845
I want to make love to you.

244
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:10,562
I'm sure it will have been the best thing
I will have done in my life.

245
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:25,809
Praise the Lord!

246
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:45,295
Amanda, Amanda, my love!
Amanda, my love, Amanda!

247
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,558
Come with me, come with me now...
Amanda!

248
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,658
Amanda?

249
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:06,412
The traffic
is the blood of this city,

250
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:08,247
and we are
the circulatory system's defense.

251
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:14,385
Traffic operators are the white blood cells
that defend the human body.

252
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:20,831
So you want your job back?
Do you regret your behavior?

253
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:24,063
You went nuts because
your wife left you,

254
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:25,694
but now you're saying
that you're fine.

255
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:29,639
You want to have the privilege to
work at this sacred profession again.

256
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:32,005
- Exactly, Nogueira.
- I'm sorry!

257
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,637
I can't have a cancerous
cell working for me.

258
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:41,316
Nogueira, I've worked in this loony bin
for over 8 years.

259
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:43,980
I'm the best traffic controller
you've ever had.

260
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:47,219
I came up with 10 out 10 bright ideas
that you've had,

261
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:48,851
including
the human blood metaphor,

262
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:50,087
which you've been using for the last 6 years.

263
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:53,859
So, you must be desperate to have me
because there is no one in this city

264
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:55,764
who would agree to do that
for this amount of money.

265
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:58,336
I can't have a nutjob
working for me!

266
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:02,140
Mr. Nogueira,
accident on Brasil Ave.

267
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:04,937
Involving a cargo truck,
a beverage truck

268
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,274
five dead
and a school bus.

269
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:10,643
The truck has tumbled, people
threat to steal the goods.

270
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:12,980
All right.
You can take over desk number 6.

271
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:14,645
But I'm warning you.

272
00:26:14,753 --> 00:26:17,688
Any abnormal behavior
and you're fired.

273
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:19,518
Gentlemen, I'm back!

274
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:26,689
- So, he's alive!
- Son of a bitch!

275
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:29,096
Pedro Albuquerque de Morais!

276
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:31,193
You're looking good.
Have you been getting some action?

277
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:32,931
That's none of your business,
but I'm not.

278
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:36,065
From that smile and these sharp clothes
I'd say you've got to be getting some!

279
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:39,201
If you really want to know:
Perhaps I am.

280
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:40,609
- Ah...
- No way!

281
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:42,303
- Oops!
- What's up?

282
00:26:43,882 --> 00:26:45,713
Welcome to the land of the living.

283
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:49,120
- Sorry. I should have called, right?
- No, no need to do that.

284
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:51,985
I gave up on you the day
I busted down your door

285
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:54,150
and found out that instead of dead,
you were drunk

286
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:57,059
- sleeping on the couch in your undies.
- Well, I'm fine now.

287
00:26:57,362 --> 00:26:58,522
And I've got a job!

288
00:26:59,231 --> 00:27:03,565
Look at you...
looking all self-confident.

289
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:06,896
You must be screwing someone.

290
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,302
Huh? Huh?

291
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:11,465
Come on, dude.

292
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,616
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

293
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:23,018
Who is it? Who is it?

294
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:25,314
My neighbor.

295
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:32,095
She knocked on my door asking
for a cup of sugar.

296
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:37,302
We like the same things,
we read the same books

297
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,304
and listen to the same type of music.
Shit, man!

298
00:27:40,872 --> 00:27:44,831
She makes love like a goddess.

299
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:51,304
It's like she feels,
she knows exactly what I need.

300
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,614
- I don't believe it.
- Maybe...

301
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:56,720
just maybe,
it might be too soon to tell,

302
00:27:56,822 --> 00:28:00,485
but I think she might be
the love of my life.

303
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:05,729
Pedro, you fell for the first slut
you screwed in over 3 months?

304
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:07,731
We must get to a whorehouse
right now!

305
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,694
Rosalvo,
what's your cousin's number again?

306
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:13,296
After we finish making love,
we just lie there...

307
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:16,533
You would have fallen in love
with a 90-year-old lady.

308
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:19,840
I'm sure you know
nothing about her life.

309
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:22,939
- What?
- What's her story?

310
00:28:24,216 --> 00:28:25,513
Where did she come from?

311
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:28,211
Who has she fucked already?
Do you know?

312
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:29,679
You don't, man.

313
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:33,721
So, before you say that she is the love
of your life, find out who she is.

314
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:49,500
- So, what's up?
- So what?

315
00:28:49,574 --> 00:28:51,735
What do you mean what?
Your neighbor.

316
00:28:51,777 --> 00:28:55,178
- What about him?
- What have you been hearing lately?

317
00:28:55,247 --> 00:28:57,681
I haven't been hearing
anything at all.

318
00:28:58,016 --> 00:28:59,108
It's over, sis.

319
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:03,613
- It's over, before it even started.
- Whatever!

320
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:07,853
- This man never noticed me.
- Honey, it's impossible not to notice you.

321
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:35,015
Goodness, he didn't even notice you.

322
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:36,745
- Let's go.
- Where to?

323
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:38,415
Where else? To the wall.

324
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:59,438
I took off my dress.
I was afraid of getting it dirty.

325
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:02,746
I got carried away
with the cleaning.

326
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:05,545
It was sorely needed, right?

327
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:13,481
- So, did you like it?
- Yes.

328
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:22,529
Stop crying!
I can't hear a word they're saying.

329
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:26,101
- I bought it so we could celebrate.
- Celebrate what?

330
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:28,695
Your return to your job.
You got it back, didn't you?

331
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,473
Yes, I did. I told Nogueira that thing
you told me to tell him and he loved it.

332
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:34,772
I knew it!

333
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:39,347
We need to talk, Amanda.

334
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:42,776
Look, a Bloody Mary.

335
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:44,687
Just the way you like it.

336
00:30:45,757 --> 00:30:49,215
- What's that smell?
- It's the bath I prepared for you.

337
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:51,785
- You prepared a bath for me?
- I did.

338
00:30:52,164 --> 00:30:54,325
Amanda, we need to talk.

339
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:58,359
Stop crying. I think he's dumping
the bitch. Come here.

340
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:06,540
I just realized that
I've told you all about me,

341
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:10,844
- and that I know nothing about you.
- Pedro, I don't like talking about my past.

342
00:31:11,016 --> 00:31:15,248
I've told you that.
I didn't exist before I met you.

343
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:16,515
Here.

344
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:19,483
You told me you weren't
eavesdropping anymore.

345
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:21,421
It's not for me,
it's for you.

346
00:31:26,097 --> 00:31:28,622
Put this on, please.

347
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:35,464
I've been spilling my guts to you
after a hard blow.

348
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,838
Pedro, certain things
should be left in the past.

349
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:40,504
- Not for two people who love each other.
- You're not going to like it.

350
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:42,570
I can't take it!
Tell me!

351
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:45,208
What's going on?
What are they talking about?

352
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:48,313
I can't hear a word she's saying.

353
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:53,157
My father died when I was 7.

354
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:59,156
And my mother married an oyster farmer
in Florianópolis.

355
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:01,597
What is it?

356
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:05,467
I think she's got a mouthful.

357
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:13,172
We lived on a deserted beach.
I rarely saw other people.

358
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,507
I think I survived because of the sea.

359
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:18,706
How so?

360
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:31,426
I enjoyed swimming in the nude.

361
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:33,588
It's refreshing, isn't it?

362
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:40,066
When I turned 13,
my body changed,

363
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:43,336
and my stepfather started
to take notice.

364
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:49,275
He abused me
on top of a fishing net.

365
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:51,305
- How awful!
- I loved it.

366
00:32:53,685 --> 00:33:00,056
Then my mother found out and sent me
to a Catholic boarding school.

367
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:01,850
That was great, right?

368
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:07,561
The nuns were no angels.
I ran away to Porto Alegre.

369
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,133
Great. A very nice city.

370
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:11,293
Not the brothel
I ended up working at.

371
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:13,964
Oh, my God... do you...

372
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,200
is that what you do for a living?

373
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:19,699
I stayed long enough
to save some money to come to Rio.

374
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:21,507
And how do you...

375
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:25,607
- make a living nowadays?
- I make a living...

376
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:30,050
as a phone sex operator.

377
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,722
I listen to all the perverts
over the phone.

378
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:42,792
So?

379
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:48,198
Do you trust me a bit more now?

380
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:08,451
Where's your princess?

381
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:11,656
I already said she'll be here,
and she will. Just relax!

382
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:14,096
Pedro, a night like this, Pedro!

383
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:19,199
You've been suffering for that woman
for the last 2 hours.

384
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:21,568
She said she'd be here.

385
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:25,631
Well then...
call her up on her cell phone.

386
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:26,866
She doesn't have one!

387
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:29,209
Don't pay any attention
to what I say to say to you?

388
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:32,646
You said you weren't nervous.
Just look at you.

389
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:36,812
Yes, I'm nervous, so what?
I get nervous every time she disappears.

390
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:39,824
- Isn't it right?
- She's not supposed to vanish, isn't it?

391
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:41,721
But she always comes back!

392
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,420
How can this be possible?

393
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:46,453
She didn't show up
and she won't show up.

394
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:47,522
She won't.

395
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:50,193
Oh, my...

396
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,373
Barbara!

397
00:34:58,643 --> 00:35:03,205
Pedro, this is Barbara. Barbara, Pedro!

398
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:05,746
Who's this guy?

399
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:08,511
This is Pedro. Crazy Pedro.

400
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,783
It's just Pedro.
There's nothing crazy about me.

401
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,323
Don't worry.
Everyone's a little bit crazy.

402
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:18,726
Take me for example,
I'm completely stoned.

403
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,428
And my friends just loved you.

404
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:36,443
Amanda, it's none of your business
where I've been.

405
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:40,382
I had a very important meeting
with the Norwegians...

406
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:43,814
Amanda,
it's none of your business.

407
00:35:43,922 --> 00:35:46,322
I had a very important
meeting with...

408
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:47,516
the Japanese...

409
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:49,621
Amanda!

410
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:52,828
Amanda!

411
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:55,488
It's none of your business!

412
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:57,535
You're so beautiful!

413
00:35:57,569 --> 00:35:58,729
You...

414
00:36:04,976 --> 00:36:08,571
Honey, you're here...

415
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,618
I'm way too stoned.
Way too stoned.

416
00:36:15,353 --> 00:36:16,684
That's all right.

417
00:36:17,555 --> 00:36:22,049
I made out with two women.
Twins. Both of them.

418
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:23,990
That's all right.

419
00:36:25,497 --> 00:36:28,159
Doesn't it bother you at all?

420
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,099
I'm very jealous.

421
00:36:31,669 --> 00:36:33,432
I feel like going away.

422
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:36,303
Don't say that. I can't take it.

423
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:39,333
I need to in order to exist.

424
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:42,037
Come here...

425
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:44,875
I'm naked.

426
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:50,042
Hey, man!

427
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:53,013
What's up, stud?

428
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:56,549
Way to go, man!

429
00:36:56,661 --> 00:37:00,654
Two girls at the same time.
You look rested.

430
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:03,226
Amanda took care of me.

431
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:10,606
She was jealous,
wasn't she?

432
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:12,801
Because of the meeting
with the Japanese.

433
00:37:12,844 --> 00:37:14,869
- I told her everything.
- About the meeting?

434
00:37:14,946 --> 00:37:16,777
No, that I fucked the twins.

435
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:23,854
For the love of God!
Why did you do that?

436
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:27,823
Carlos, I made up my mind.
I'm going to marry her.

437
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:30,719
- Marry her?
- Marry her.

438
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:34,162
Why are you going to marry her?
What for?

439
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:37,201
You're going to marry a woman that
I haven't even met?

440
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:40,068
Everything is cool. I know her and
I'm the one who's going to marry her.

441
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:44,598
Pedro, she skipped step 1,
where she pretends to like your friends.

442
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:48,237
She jumped straight to step 3, where
she doesn't even want to see them.

443
00:37:48,313 --> 00:37:50,543
If this is happening now,
when you're just neighbors,

444
00:37:50,582 --> 00:37:53,881
imagine what it will be like
when you get married!

445
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:56,119
You'll never see your friends again.

446
00:37:56,154 --> 00:37:58,145
Wait until you give her the keys
to your apartment.

447
00:37:58,189 --> 00:37:58,985
I've already done that.

448
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,557
- The keys to my apartment!
- What?

449
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:02,651
- What?
- I've already gave her the keys!

450
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:03,388
You see?

451
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:05,223
Do you know what she'll do next?

452
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:07,231
She's going to convince you
to work from home

453
00:38:07,265 --> 00:38:09,733
and that's just slavery.

454
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:13,237
Until the day she dumps you
for a German millionaire.

455
00:38:13,271 --> 00:38:14,499
- Enough!
- You didn't like that?

456
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:16,938
- You're insulting me!
- Am I?

457
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:18,999
- You're crazy!
- You're the one who's crazy.

458
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:21,876
Mistaking being horny with marriage.
You're sick!

459
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:23,073
- Enough!
- You're sick!

460
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:24,445
- Enough!
- Move it!

461
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:27,883
Don't honk the horn!
It's my car, I'll honk!

462
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:30,251
- It's my car!
- You're yelling at me!

463
00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:11,718
What's up, dude?
What's going on tonight?

464
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:18,662
The Catacomb?
No, I'm going alone.

465
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:20,269
I mean...

466
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,938
The hunter has just seen his prey.

467
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:30,442
Ooops!

468
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:35,352
My God! Are you hurt?

469
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,013
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

470
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:43,955
I'm sorry that I'm laughing.
But it was too funny.

471
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:48,632
Laugh all you want.
Be my guest.

472
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:53,133
But in return, you'll have to go with me
to a party tonight.

473
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:57,501
I can't believe this.

474
00:39:57,642 --> 00:40:01,078
It's just a party tonight...
at the Catacomb.

475
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:04,845
I can't believe I fell for that.

476
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:10,016
Wait...
can I get your number? No?

477
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:13,350
- What a moron!
- What's wrong?

478
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:15,187
This Varley is a moron!

479
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,389
The team is losing
and he subs a forward like Herivelto

480
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:21,989
for Timbinha, a center-half.

481
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:24,433
He filled the team with defenders.

482
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:25,901
I think he enjoys losing.

483
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:27,962
- Who's playing?
- Luisiana vs. Sobradinho.

484
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:28,630
What?

485
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:31,970
Luisiana vs. Sobradinho.
A minor league classic.

486
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:36,209
Now they are tied.
They'll have to decide on the free kicks.

487
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:40,308
How about some strip-betting?

488
00:40:42,553 --> 00:40:45,989
I'll give you a headstart.
I'm not wearing panties...

489
00:41:05,076 --> 00:41:06,134
Are you sure?

490
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:15,880
We barely know each other.
It's crazy.

491
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,323
Do you want to go out?
Have a few drinks,

492
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:27,897
celebrate, party?

493
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:09,766
You're all I need to exist.

494
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:11,502
You too!

495
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:22,177
Carlos... Carlos, look at that.

496
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,188
Isn't that your friend Pedro?

497
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:26,589
Look, he's totally high!

498
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:41,266
Some people
don't need any company.

499
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:45,000
As for me... I need you.

500
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:51,810
- I saw you yesterday.
- Yesterday?

501
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:53,441
3:30am, at the Catacomb.

502
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:56,578
Catacomb?
So you saw me with my sweetie pie?

503
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:59,817
- My sweet honey!
- What?

504
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:03,486
- You saw my Amanda? Did you?
- No.

505
00:43:03,928 --> 00:43:05,327
- I didn't.
- You did.

506
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:09,527
Next Tuesday the governor
will honor us with his visit.

507
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:12,296
You were all by yourself
on the dance floor,

508
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,304
completely out of it.

509
00:43:14,405 --> 00:43:16,669
Really out of it.

510
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:21,668
The governor can't get stuck in traffic
on his way here.

511
00:43:21,812 --> 00:43:23,279
- We're engaged.
- Excuse me?

512
00:43:23,314 --> 00:43:26,078
Engaged. Wedding.
Wedding. Engaged.

513
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,515
Pedro... Pedro...

514
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:34,215
Let's go get some fresh air.

515
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:40,188
Sometimes, when we don't have sex
for a very long time,

516
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:43,223
we tend to lie.
That's normal.

517
00:43:43,434 --> 00:43:49,703
But, lying to your brother about
getting engaged is just ridiculous!

518
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:51,035
I don't understand.

519
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:54,511
You were high and by yourself
at the club last night.

520
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:56,740
I saw you.
There's no denying it.

521
00:43:56,814 --> 00:43:58,805
You... You're out of your mind!

522
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:01,249
- You are completely out of your mind!
- Me?

523
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:03,651
I'm getting married
at the end of the year

524
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:06,689
- and you're telling me it's all a lie?
- I'm saying that you can trust me!

525
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:08,123
You're jealous.

526
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:12,162
Jealous?

527
00:44:12,496 --> 00:44:14,726
Why do you think I'm jealous?
Of you?

528
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:17,928
Because I am able to love and you're not!

529
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:22,167
You'll end up alone.
No kids, no grandchildren.

530
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:24,902
Alone! All by yourself.

531
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:26,270
Alone!

532
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:27,538
Solo!

533
00:44:27,578 --> 00:44:28,875
Alone!

534
00:45:07,885 --> 00:45:08,977
I'll be right back!

535
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:17,951
Not you again.

536
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:20,827
No, it wasn't on purpose.
I ran here and I tripped.

537
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:25,228
I wanted to give you this.
I made this for you.

538
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:30,841
Please. Don't leave me hanging here.

539
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:41,918
Please, accept it.
Please?

540
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:49,118
Open the origami.

541
00:45:53,197 --> 00:45:56,064
YOU'R E THE DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
MY FATHER WAS LOOKING FOR. CALL ME.

542
00:45:57,968 --> 00:45:58,696
Ok?

543
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:03,964
I think your friend Carlos
is jealous of me.

544
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:30,190
You know what he said?
That I need professional help.

545
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:33,230
- And you really do need it!
- Show me some respect.

546
00:46:33,304 --> 00:46:35,272
Look at the line. Shame on you.

547
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:45,072
What?
You've never seen a beautiful woman?

548
00:46:47,051 --> 00:46:48,484
Good evening
and enjoy the movie, sir.

549
00:46:51,422 --> 00:46:52,787
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

550
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:54,723
- Enjoy the movie, sir.
- Shall we?

551
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:58,658
Sir, I'm not unauthorized to hold on
to someone else's ticket.

552
00:46:58,696 --> 00:47:02,427
- What do you mean "someone else's"?
- You gave me two tickets.

553
00:47:04,401 --> 00:47:08,064
Yes, my ticket and the lady's ticket.

554
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:10,197
And what lady would that be?

555
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:15,545
Lady... the lady.

556
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:17,546
Are you calling me a lady, sir?

557
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:20,007
I'm calling her a lady.
I'm not going to argue with you.

558
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:22,382
Your name? Jefferson.
Get me your boss, please.

559
00:47:32,229 --> 00:47:34,720
- Good Evening.
- Perhaps for you.

560
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:35,854
- Your name is?
- Geraldo.

561
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:39,060
Your employee, Jefferson,
doesn't want to accept my tickets.

562
00:47:39,537 --> 00:47:41,027
There's nothing wrong with the tickets.

563
00:47:41,071 --> 00:47:44,040
I was only telling him
that he didn't need 2 tickets.

564
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:45,905
- And why not?
- He's alone.

565
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:47,366
Oh, yes.

566
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:53,611
Sir, our policy is that
we can't hold on to anyone's tickets.

567
00:47:53,884 --> 00:47:57,513
- Are you alone, sir?
- No, I'm here with my... honey?

568
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:01,984
Honey? Amanda!
Has anyone seen my wife?

569
00:48:02,993 --> 00:48:04,756
- Have you seen my wife?
- No, I haven't, sir.

570
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:06,056
Have you seen my wife?

571
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:10,293
This is the kind of thing that,
if people in Brazil had any scruples...

572
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:13,792
- Honey? Amanda?
- Oh, my!

573
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:19,370
- Where were you?
- The movie has already started!

574
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:21,070
How why did you leave downstairs?

575
00:48:31,055 --> 00:48:34,786
They were giving me a hard time
because of the tickets.

576
00:48:34,892 --> 00:48:35,824
The movie!

577
00:49:11,528 --> 00:49:13,689
What's this? You pervert!

578
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:17,801
- This is love, lady.
- Asshole!

579
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:20,768
You're the asshole, man.
Respect other people's feelings.

580
00:49:22,006 --> 00:49:24,873
You're supposed to do that
in the bathroom!

581
00:50:01,745 --> 00:50:04,145
What are you doing? This is outrageous.

582
00:50:05,883 --> 00:50:07,180
Are you waiting for someone?

583
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:09,515
No, it's just the two of us.

584
00:50:10,821 --> 00:50:14,587
As you wish. Here's the menu.

585
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:20,363
I'll go get another one.

586
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:23,998
That guy is not well.

587
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:25,898
Look, wine...

588
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,034
Honey. Order me some water.

589
00:50:32,142 --> 00:50:33,609
I need to go to the bathroom.

590
00:50:33,677 --> 00:50:35,907
Right now? Please, come back soon.

591
00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:54,989
Pedro...

592
00:50:57,201 --> 00:50:59,567
We need to talk.

593
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,967
Amanda is sitting there.
It's her chair.

594
00:51:02,072 --> 00:51:07,100
Amanda is here, she'll be right back,
then you'll understand everything.

595
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:09,443
Amanda!

596
00:51:10,514 --> 00:51:11,708
Are you all right?

597
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:15,347
There's no Amanda here.
I'm Paula, ok?

598
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,479
She must have gone back home.
That's it. That must be it.

599
00:51:21,191 --> 00:51:26,788
Pedro... you're dating
a woman who is unreal.

600
00:51:27,398 --> 00:51:29,298
I think she's amazing too.

601
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,733
No, she's not amazing.
She's invisible.

602
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,965
Invisible. She doesn't exist.

603
00:51:35,038 --> 00:51:38,303
She's a figment of your imagination.

604
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:41,371
- I'm calling the police.
- No, no, no!

605
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:43,913
Don't do that.
You're going to end up in jail.

606
00:51:43,981 --> 00:51:45,243
Pedro, listen to me.

607
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:48,375
I was at the movie theater.
I was there when you arrived.

608
00:51:48,452 --> 00:51:50,943
I saw the whole incident
with the tickets.

609
00:51:50,988 --> 00:51:54,583
Believe me my friend,
you were by yourself!

610
00:51:54,658 --> 00:51:58,492
Are you crazy?
You're out of your mind!

611
00:51:58,529 --> 00:51:59,553
Look...

612
00:52:01,198 --> 00:52:03,758
I'm engaged to her.

613
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:05,892
For the past 2 months!

614
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:09,797
All right.
Then show me a picture of her.

615
00:52:10,274 --> 00:52:14,335
Marina took my camera. And Amanda
doesn't like having her picture taken.

616
00:52:15,412 --> 00:52:16,674
Pedro...

617
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:20,510
here's what you're going to do:

618
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:24,487
You're going to take a picture of
both of you together.

619
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:26,887
You just have to press here.
All right?

620
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:33,923
- Only to prove that you're an asshole.
- Okay.

621
00:52:34,865 --> 00:52:36,992
I'm out of here.
I'll be home if you need me.

622
00:52:52,716 --> 00:52:54,980
What happened? You vanished!

623
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:58,112
- I don't like that friend of yours.
- What friend?

624
00:52:58,155 --> 00:53:01,352
The one who interrupted our dinner
and who just left your apartment.

625
00:53:01,391 --> 00:53:03,256
Amanda, Carlos is my best friend.

626
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:04,817
He wants to split us up.

627
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:08,195
- It's no that. He's just concerned.
- About what?

628
00:53:08,232 --> 00:53:11,292
He thinks that I'm going crazy.

629
00:53:11,335 --> 00:53:14,361
- Are you?
- Crazy about you.

630
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:16,898
He thinks...

631
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:21,204
that you don't exist.

632
00:53:23,947 --> 00:53:29,408
Oh, really? What does he want?
That I disappear?

633
00:53:30,387 --> 00:53:32,617
Don't say that, I couldn't take it.

634
00:53:32,823 --> 00:53:35,155
He just asked...

635
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:40,559
if I could take a picture of you.

636
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:45,364
- Of us.
- I don't like photos.

637
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:48,096
I know, butjust one photo...

638
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:49,628
What for?

639
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,231
To...

640
00:53:55,646 --> 00:53:57,671
To prove that we exist.

641
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:11,890
I'm not some trophy for you
to parade around

642
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:14,830
for your sexist friends.

643
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:11,780
So, did you take a look?

644
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:14,150
I couldn't open the damned file!

645
00:55:14,992 --> 00:55:17,222
Or were afraid of opening by yourself?

646
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:22,763
Hey, "Batman". Tell the "Boy Wonder"
that I'm watching him.

647
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,270
Did it open?

648
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:37,143
- Do you get it now?
- Got it.

649
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,772
Do you understand why
I'm so crazy about her?

650
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:42,376
I understand that you're
completely out of your mind.

651
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:21,880
Amanda! Amanda!

652
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:26,820
- I'm right here.
- Are you?

653
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:29,661
Oh, yeah? But you're not here.

654
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:32,695
I can explain.

655
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,270
Explain what? That you don't exist?

656
00:56:36,339 --> 00:56:38,364
I was waiting for the right moment
to tell you.

657
00:56:38,408 --> 00:56:41,343
Oh, really? And when was going to be?
At our wedding?

658
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:44,403
Better, when our first son was born?

659
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:47,243
I was just trying to help you
help yourself.

660
00:56:47,284 --> 00:56:49,912
- You fooled me!
- No, you fooled yourself!

661
00:56:49,986 --> 00:56:52,284
You made me look like an idiot!

662
00:56:53,023 --> 00:56:55,355
Didn't want the ideal woman?

663
00:56:55,425 --> 00:56:57,893
I might not me real, but I am ideal.

664
00:56:57,928 --> 00:57:00,863
I was so naive.
Of course! There are no ideal women.

665
00:57:00,897 --> 00:57:04,628
The word is self-explanatory:
Ideal belongs to the world of ideas.

666
00:57:04,668 --> 00:57:08,297
So, I do exist, in your imagination.
Your love is proof of that.

667
00:57:08,338 --> 00:57:11,637
I'm talking to myself in my living room,
as if it were a normal thing to do.

668
00:57:11,775 --> 00:57:13,333
You're not talking to yourself.

669
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:16,044
You're not talking to yourself.

670
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,639
What? I can hear you.

671
00:57:19,216 --> 00:57:24,347
I don't want you listening to me!

672
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:27,754
Pedro, I'll die without you.

673
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:30,987
- Goodbye, Amanda!
- Goodbye, Amanda?

674
00:57:31,061 --> 00:57:32,892
Goodbye, Amanda.

675
00:57:32,963 --> 00:57:35,796
What do you mean?
Goodbye, Amanda?

676
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:39,666
I did everything for you!
I lived my whole life for you!

677
00:57:39,703 --> 00:57:41,432
And you think you can end it like this?

678
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:44,304
You use me and then just throw me away?
"Goodbye, Amanda"?

679
00:57:44,341 --> 00:57:47,333
Is that what you're saying?
Is that what I'm thinking?

680
00:57:47,444 --> 00:57:50,140
- What about our past?
- What about our future?

681
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:53,240
What about my future?
Is that what I'm thinking?

682
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:56,741
I may be a figment of your imagination,
but I also have rights!

683
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,051
Is that so? Then call your lawyer!

684
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:01,682
I love you, Pedro.

685
00:58:01,758 --> 00:58:05,854
- Isn't that what you always wanted?
- Precisely, Amanda.

686
00:58:05,896 --> 00:58:08,626
All I ever wanted was to be loved
by someone,

687
00:58:08,732 --> 00:58:11,166
and not by nobody.

688
00:58:11,535 --> 00:58:12,399
Goodbye, Amanda!

689
00:58:15,939 --> 00:58:17,236
Pedro... no...

690
00:58:17,674 --> 00:58:18,800
Pedro!

691
00:58:19,075 --> 00:58:20,042
Pedro!

692
00:58:20,343 --> 00:58:22,777
Pedro, let me in!

693
00:58:22,813 --> 00:58:25,475
Open the door, Pedro!

694
00:58:25,515 --> 00:58:29,542
Pedro, Let me in!
Pedro!

695
00:59:23,573 --> 00:59:26,440
So, how are you?
Everything okay?

696
00:59:26,543 --> 00:59:29,410
Everything is under control.

697
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:31,743
- And that little problem of ours?
- Its buried away.

698
00:59:31,781 --> 00:59:35,478
Now you've just got to promise me,
swear that this will stay between us.

699
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:37,179
- Ok, on one condition...
- Between us.

700
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,053
On the condition that you tell me
if you start dating again. Deal?

701
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,955
- Deal.
- Deal.

702
00:59:46,796 --> 00:59:49,890
Pedro, we need to talk.

703
00:59:52,602 --> 00:59:55,070
What's that look?
Seems like you've never seen me.

704
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:58,503
Are you going to pretend
that I don't exist?

705
00:59:58,608 --> 00:59:59,302
Pedrão, Pedro...

706
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:01,401
- Are you sure you're all right?
- What? I'm fine.

707
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:03,672
So, you're doing fine?

708
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:07,146
You used me and you're going to pretend
that our love is over?

709
01:00:07,217 --> 01:00:08,206
Pedro!

710
01:00:10,186 --> 01:00:11,847
Pedro! Talk to me!

711
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:13,654
Please, listen to me.

712
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:17,121
Pedro, stop, talk to me.

713
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,960
Look at me.
Pedro!

714
01:00:26,236 --> 01:00:28,170
Pedro, I'm talking to you!

715
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:39,275
Governor, it gives me great pride...

716
01:00:39,316 --> 01:00:42,717
I'll start screaming in here!

717
01:00:42,786 --> 01:00:45,186
I'm honored to introduce you

718
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:50,249
to the finest traffic controllers.

719
01:00:51,127 --> 01:00:55,257
These men and women who work...

720
01:00:55,398 --> 01:00:59,266
under any kind of pressure.

721
01:00:59,336 --> 01:01:02,794
Shut the hell up! This is insane!

722
01:01:03,006 --> 01:01:05,440
Shut up! Show me some respect!

723
01:01:05,475 --> 01:01:07,875
I'm at work!
My colleagues...

724
01:01:07,944 --> 01:01:10,435
This is unacceptable...

725
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,677
Shut up! Shut the hell up!

726
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:15,981
You're fired!

727
01:01:18,588 --> 01:01:21,421
You're fired! You're fired!

728
01:01:49,586 --> 01:01:53,579
KNOWING HOW TO LOVE
LOVE YOURSELF AND CURE YOUR LIFE

729
01:01:54,858 --> 01:01:57,258
GIVE A CHANCE TO DESTINY

730
01:02:14,177 --> 01:02:17,943
Pedro, you're not going
to get rid of me so easily.

731
01:02:33,663 --> 01:02:35,062
Pedro, open the door!

732
01:02:35,098 --> 01:02:37,191
I'll keep on knocking!

733
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,437
Pedro, open the door!

734
01:02:47,043 --> 01:02:49,307
A last chance to destiny.

735
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:52,309
Open it!

736
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:54,543
Get out of here!

737
01:02:54,617 --> 01:02:57,381
Get out of my life!
You're sick!

738
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:03,982
I'll keep on knocking!
You have to open it!

739
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,652
Pedro, open the door!

740
01:03:05,728 --> 01:03:08,663
Pedro, open the door!
You've got to listen to me!

741
01:03:08,731 --> 01:03:11,325
Pedro, open it!

742
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:16,637
Was there ever any other woman for you?
I'm going to make your life miserable!

743
01:03:16,973 --> 01:03:19,237
No, no, Pedro!

744
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,036
Pedro! Open the door!
Pedro!

745
01:03:21,077 --> 01:03:22,567
Open it, let me in!

746
01:03:22,645 --> 01:03:24,442
Open the door!

747
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:26,412
Pedro, open the door!

748
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:27,746
Pedro, please!

749
01:03:29,085 --> 01:03:35,949
Pedro! Open the door!

750
01:03:35,992 --> 01:03:38,324
Pedro! Let's talk?

751
01:03:38,428 --> 01:03:41,693
Pedro!
No, Pedro!

752
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:44,994
- This...
- Pedro!

753
01:03:45,068 --> 01:03:51,906
Is the story of a man

754
01:03:52,542 --> 01:04:02,178
who fell in love with a woman
who did not exist.

755
01:04:19,202 --> 01:04:25,869
This is the story of a man
who fell in love...

756
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:29,476
with a woman...

757
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:33,915
who did not exist.

758
01:04:41,057 --> 01:04:44,993
A CHANCE TO DESTINY
"TRAVELLING CHANGES YOUR LIFE"

759
01:04:45,028 --> 01:04:45,858
No, I don't believe it!

760
01:04:45,995 --> 01:04:51,058
Burying yourself up in Minas Gerais
is simply unbelievable.

761
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:52,498
That's where we were born.

762
01:04:52,535 --> 01:04:55,698
That's nothing more than
an abandoned farm, Vitória.

763
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:58,298
I'm going to study, write.

764
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:01,839
Our parents would be happy.

765
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:05,274
Is this because of the neighbor?

766
01:05:05,848 --> 01:05:09,045
I don't believe it!
Janete, it's because of the neighbor.

767
01:05:09,085 --> 01:05:11,246
I still don't understand
what you saw in that guy.

768
01:05:11,321 --> 01:05:15,815
- Or heard, for that matter.
- Vitória, what did you see in that guy?

769
01:05:18,628 --> 01:05:19,652
I don't know.

770
01:05:19,696 --> 01:05:22,859
And you're going to run away
without finding out?

771
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:26,124
It's too late.

772
01:05:26,402 --> 01:05:28,836
The movers are coming in on Wednesday.

773
01:05:32,275 --> 01:05:33,970
So it's got to be today.

774
01:06:19,322 --> 01:06:22,155
He was just himself.

775
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:25,256
The End.

776
01:06:26,796 --> 01:06:30,129
"THE INVISIBLE WOMAN"
BY PEDRO ALBUQUERQUE

777
01:06:38,675 --> 01:06:39,972
It's only the doorman.

778
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:43,377
It's only the doorman.

779
01:06:52,388 --> 01:06:53,286
Hi.

780
01:06:56,793 --> 01:07:00,627
I don't think you know me.
I'm your neighbor.

781
01:07:02,198 --> 01:07:04,223
- Neighbor?
- Yes.

782
01:07:05,868 --> 01:07:08,735
I don't have sugar and...

783
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:14,476
Again!

784
01:07:28,991 --> 01:07:29,923
Good morning.

785
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:38,191
What's this place? Where am I?

786
01:07:38,401 --> 01:07:40,596
- It's the hospital.
- Why? What happened?

787
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:44,799
You had food poisoning.

788
01:07:46,642 --> 01:07:49,907
- You're a big fan of canned tuna, right?
- Who brought me here?

789
01:07:49,979 --> 01:07:53,005
Your chart says...

790
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:57,314
that you came alone.
Strange.

791
01:07:57,387 --> 01:08:02,086
That can't be right.
Calm down and relax.

792
01:08:02,258 --> 01:08:03,748
Are you feeling okay?

793
01:08:07,563 --> 01:08:10,657
- Do you need a sleeping pill?
- Three.

794
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:23,069
Stay calm, okay?

795
01:09:05,888 --> 01:09:07,014
- What?
- Aw!

796
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:10,086
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to startle you!

797
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:12,320
- Who are you?
- I'm your neighbor.

798
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:14,056
The cup of sugar, remember?

799
01:09:14,096 --> 01:09:17,327
- I've never seen you before.
- Right. And that's the problem.

800
01:09:18,568 --> 01:09:22,868
- Are you real?
- What a beautiful question.

801
01:09:23,806 --> 01:09:26,366
Of course I am.

802
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:29,204
- Did you bring me here?
- Yes.

803
01:09:30,947 --> 01:09:33,848
- What time it it?
- 3 am.

804
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:36,441
3 am?
What are you doing in my room at 3 am?

805
01:09:36,486 --> 01:09:38,283
I didn't want anyone to see me.

806
01:09:38,354 --> 01:09:41,187
- Do you have a problem with that?
- No.

807
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:44,754
Listen. I did something terrible.

808
01:09:44,827 --> 01:09:46,988
Let me guess: You used to swim
naked with horny nuns.

809
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:48,291
No.

810
01:09:50,032 --> 01:09:51,727
I read your story.

811
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,302
- You read this?
- I did.

812
01:10:01,444 --> 01:10:04,311
- I can explain.
- There's nothing to explain.

813
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,747
I know it's poetry...
I mean, pain.

814
01:10:07,783 --> 01:10:11,378
I mean, you turne
your pain into poetry.

815
01:10:11,554 --> 01:10:15,149
That's amazing literature.
The idea of an invisible woman.

816
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:16,781
You should get it published.

817
01:10:19,795 --> 01:10:21,319
I came here to return it.
I'll leave now.

818
01:10:21,397 --> 01:10:23,729
No, wait!
Wait!

819
01:10:23,766 --> 01:10:25,734
Why did you knock
on my door last night?

820
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:31,766
Courage finally came to me,
but at the wrong time.

821
01:10:31,874 --> 01:10:34,365
Why didn't you leave your name
here at the hospital?

822
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:38,141
I didn't want to mess up your life.
Your wife might not have liked it.

823
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:42,014
- No, Marina left a long time ago.
- I'm talking about Amanda.

824
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:49,917
- Did you ever meet Amanda?
- No.

825
01:10:51,127 --> 01:10:56,429
But after reading your book,
I feel as if she's a part of me.

826
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:00,729
I know you've broken up.

827
01:11:02,972 --> 01:11:06,601
How come you know
so much about my life?

828
01:11:06,742 --> 01:11:09,836
How come you know
so much about my life?

829
01:11:09,912 --> 01:11:14,008
How come I know
so much about your life?

830
01:11:15,117 --> 01:11:18,018
Do you mind if I don't answer that question?

831
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,851
- Is it all right if I call the nurse?
- Are you not feeling well?

832
01:11:21,891 --> 01:11:25,452
No. I'm well. I'm feeling fine.

833
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:28,689
I just want to call the nurse
so that he can see you.

834
01:11:28,731 --> 01:11:31,131
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here.

835
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:32,896
Hold on!
Nurse!

836
01:11:33,903 --> 01:11:35,461
Nur... Buddy!
Hey!

837
01:11:36,606 --> 01:11:39,006
Nurse? Hey, pal!

838
01:11:39,609 --> 01:11:43,045
Could you please
get the girl who just left this room?

839
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:46,480
- Calm down. What girl?
- A very fair girl... She just left!

840
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:51,349
There's no girl here.
I'm going to give you a sedative.

841
01:12:14,443 --> 01:12:17,105
I thought you were on vacation.
You said you were going away.

842
01:12:17,213 --> 01:12:18,874
Oh, she's back.

843
01:12:18,948 --> 01:12:20,916
No, I haven't seen Amanda
for over a month.

844
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:22,747
What was it then?
Where you committed?

845
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:25,480
- Are you still nuts?
- No. I'm fine.

846
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:26,816
I was even writing.

847
01:12:26,856 --> 01:12:28,255
Writing? What do you mean writing?

848
01:12:28,424 --> 01:12:32,019
As I was writing about my life,
she started to fade away.

849
01:12:32,061 --> 01:12:33,255
I began focusing...

850
01:12:33,396 --> 01:12:35,421
- A moment, please.
- Alright.

851
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:41,836
I was writing and the more focused,
the more she faded away.

852
01:12:42,004 --> 01:12:44,165
The noise faded away.
I think it's a book.

853
01:12:44,206 --> 01:12:46,731
- People who read it liked it.
- Pedro, listen.

854
01:12:46,809 --> 01:12:50,142
You're a traffic controller that went nuts.
You can't write books.

855
01:12:50,212 --> 01:12:53,238
Carlos, I met a woman...

856
01:12:53,282 --> 01:12:56,274
- A nurse?
- No, you idiot...

857
01:12:57,253 --> 01:12:59,050
- a neighbor.
- Ok.

858
01:12:59,689 --> 01:13:01,919
She's the one who saved me.

859
01:13:02,024 --> 01:13:06,654
She knocked on my door
asking for a cup of sugar.

860
01:13:06,696 --> 01:13:07,958
- What?
- A cup of sugar.

861
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:09,156
Sugar? Sugar?

862
01:13:10,132 --> 01:13:13,829
Pedro, do you have idea
of what you're saying?

863
01:13:13,869 --> 01:13:18,704
I know. I know. It's starting
all over again. The same story.

864
01:13:18,841 --> 01:13:21,867
But I feel that it's different now.
I just need to make sure.

865
01:13:22,645 --> 01:13:24,306
OK, what do you want me to do?

866
01:13:24,346 --> 01:13:25,938
I want you to go over my place.

867
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:30,543
Go to my building,
knock on her door and...

868
01:13:31,087 --> 01:13:32,281
And?

869
01:13:34,223 --> 01:13:36,248
And make sure she is for real.

870
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:39,317
She's on the left,
once you get off the elevator...

871
01:13:39,428 --> 01:13:41,828
Now you have to go there
and finish the job.

872
01:13:41,964 --> 01:13:44,296
He's in the hospital
and I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

873
01:13:44,366 --> 01:13:46,391
That's why. See?

874
01:13:46,936 --> 01:13:49,336
- You finally managed to talk to him!
- All right!

875
01:13:49,405 --> 01:13:53,364
But I found out he loves that other woman
enough to write her a book.

876
01:13:53,576 --> 01:13:54,804
I don't know.

877
01:13:54,844 --> 01:13:56,573
Sometimes I think
you're imagining this woman.

878
01:13:56,612 --> 01:13:59,775
I wouldn't be nuts to suffer
for an imaginary woman.

879
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:05,114
- Have you ever seen her?
- No.

880
01:14:05,855 --> 01:14:09,018
Did you ever hear her?
I haven't, have you?

881
01:14:09,959 --> 01:14:11,893
He wrote her a book.

882
01:14:12,328 --> 01:14:16,230
Yet another reason why you should go
there and have sex with him.

883
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:21,826
Before she reads what he has written.

884
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:28,802
Here, drink up. For courage.

885
01:14:28,944 --> 01:14:31,412
Tonight you'll go to the hospital,

886
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:35,780
bribe the nurse,
go to his room and fuck him.

887
01:14:35,885 --> 01:14:38,012
At least if he's a bad lay you'll know

888
01:14:38,087 --> 01:14:41,955
and you can take the bus
and bury yourself in Minas Gerais.

889
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:09,050
You?

890
01:15:10,386 --> 01:15:12,251
Why did you leave like that?

891
01:15:14,723 --> 01:15:15,883
Common sense.

892
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,789
But I'm over that.

893
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,531
Still wondering how I know so much
about your life?

894
01:15:32,575 --> 01:15:34,873
The wall from your apartment

895
01:15:36,011 --> 01:15:39,777
leaks every sound coming
from your living room into my kitchen.

896
01:15:40,616 --> 01:15:45,519
I've been listening in on your life
for the last 6 years.

897
01:15:47,556 --> 01:15:51,492
- And what did hear?
- Everything.

898
01:15:52,695 --> 01:15:58,395
Could you hear Amanda speaking?

899
01:15:58,601 --> 01:16:01,399
Show her what you've written.

900
01:16:02,571 --> 01:16:07,235
It's the most beautiful love story
I've ever read.

901
01:16:08,143 --> 01:16:10,976
I must tell this...

902
01:16:12,414 --> 01:16:16,111
I never want to see Amanda
again in my life.

903
01:16:16,485 --> 01:16:21,787
I just need to be sure that
this is really happening.

904
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:23,855
Me too.

905
01:16:36,772 --> 01:16:39,570
- Are you sure now?
- Yeah...

906
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:44,572
- What's your name?
- Vitória.

907
01:16:45,047 --> 01:16:48,141
You're so beautiful.

908
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:21,345
When I touched the door
to leave the note... it opened.

909
01:17:22,618 --> 01:17:24,483
She's sensational, isn't she?

910
01:17:26,155 --> 01:17:28,487
You saw her, didn't you?

911
01:17:29,591 --> 01:17:31,218
There was no one there.

912
01:17:31,293 --> 01:17:35,957
That's because she was here
when you went over.

913
01:17:37,766 --> 01:17:40,462
There was nothing in the apartment.

914
01:17:41,837 --> 01:17:44,362
It was completely empty.

915
01:17:47,876 --> 01:17:50,436
- What do mean by empty?
- Empty. Nothing.

916
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:55,483
No one. Not a speck of dust.

917
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:58,342
You did go to the apartment on the left
when you exit the elevator...

918
01:17:58,487 --> 01:18:00,421
Just like you said.

919
01:18:02,257 --> 01:18:05,818
I had the most amazing night of my life
and the bitch wasn't even real!

920
01:18:05,928 --> 01:18:08,089
You fucked another invisible woman.

921
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:11,429
Show some respect for a friend
who is going through...

922
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:13,332
I need to be alone.

923
01:18:57,513 --> 01:18:59,174
You showed up!

924
01:19:03,252 --> 01:19:06,585
- I want you to go away!
- Pedro.

925
01:19:07,389 --> 01:19:08,481
Alakazam!

926
01:19:11,593 --> 01:19:13,652
Alakazam! Alakazam!

927
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:18,231
Why are you doing that, Pedro?
You don't need to offend me.

928
01:19:18,267 --> 01:19:20,895
This is all a lie!

929
01:19:22,504 --> 01:19:23,835
What about yesterday?

930
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:27,875
I'll tell you all about yesterday: Nothing!

931
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:32,341
Yesterday did not happen!

932
01:19:33,682 --> 01:19:36,446
Get away from me! Alakazam!

933
01:20:23,999 --> 01:20:28,095
Excuse me, please.
I'm late for a date.

934
01:20:31,173 --> 01:20:36,133
What date?
You can't be late for a date...

935
01:20:38,013 --> 01:20:41,676
because the only person
you could meet with is me.

936
01:20:41,817 --> 01:20:45,446
And I don't want to meet with you.
Get it?

937
01:20:45,521 --> 01:20:50,083
I don't want to see you anymore.
Get out of my way! Be gone!

938
01:20:53,462 --> 01:20:57,558
For someone who's not real,
you hit pretty hard.

939
01:21:04,006 --> 01:21:06,133
Carlos, this is not a good time.

940
01:21:15,017 --> 01:21:18,316
- Please get me out of here.
- Of course...

941
01:21:45,147 --> 01:21:49,584
I should have told you.
I should have told you that she existed.

942
01:21:49,651 --> 01:21:53,348
- You two were kissing.
- That's the catch.

943
01:21:54,756 --> 01:21:58,123
Does she know that
I think that she isn't real?

944
01:21:58,193 --> 01:22:01,424
No. Not yet. But I'll tell her.

945
01:22:01,597 --> 01:22:04,566
I'll tell her today.
I keep putting it off,

946
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:07,157
but man, I really screwed up.

947
01:22:09,605 --> 01:22:12,870
- I fell for her.
- You piece of shit!

948
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:15,569
You know everything
that I've told her.

949
01:22:15,711 --> 01:22:18,043
- I'm going to tell her.
- No, you can't do that to me!

950
01:22:18,146 --> 01:22:20,273
Please, don't do that. Please!

951
01:22:20,482 --> 01:22:23,474
I swear I'll tell her!
Let me be the one to tell her.

952
01:22:23,619 --> 01:22:29,216
Man, I like this woman.
That's why I haven't told her yet.

953
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:34,784
You were right.
I have never loved anyone in my life.

954
01:22:35,197 --> 01:22:37,461
Man, if I lose her...

955
01:22:38,433 --> 01:22:41,800
I'll end up alone like
you said I would.

956
01:22:43,305 --> 01:22:45,569
Come on, man. I'm your pal.

957
01:22:45,607 --> 01:22:49,407
Have you ever seen me like this before?
Have you?

958
01:22:51,446 --> 01:22:56,884
Come on then. Give me a break.
Let her decide.

959
01:23:02,124 --> 01:23:06,527
A lot has happened in these last 2 weeks
that you stayed in the hospital.

960
01:23:06,828 --> 01:23:07,817
She...

961
01:23:08,664 --> 01:23:13,101
wants me to meet her sister
later tonight.

962
01:23:15,103 --> 01:23:17,333
She also likes me.

963
01:23:43,865 --> 01:23:45,423
It's all right.

964
01:23:45,934 --> 01:23:48,630
Go talk to her,

965
01:23:49,137 --> 01:23:52,937
and tell her
that I want everyone to be happy.

966
01:23:55,377 --> 01:23:58,369
- Are you all right?
- I feel good.

967
01:23:59,948 --> 01:24:04,442
I've decided to go on a trip.

968
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:08,386
- Can I keep her?
- Yes, you can.

969
01:24:12,561 --> 01:24:15,928
I've got to go. She's waiting.

970
01:25:55,063 --> 01:25:57,497
- Will you marry me?
- Pedro...

971
01:25:57,766 --> 01:26:00,030
Marry me, for real. Forever.

972
01:26:00,101 --> 01:26:05,095
- But Pedro, darling, I don't exist.
- That's just a small detail.

973
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,935
But I am you.

974
01:26:07,108 --> 01:26:11,772
I know, but no one
ever cared for me so much before.

975
01:26:11,913 --> 01:26:15,110
That only means
that you took care of yourself.

976
01:26:15,183 --> 01:26:17,743
I've never felt so happy
before in my life.

977
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:19,448
I love you, Pedro.

978
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:28,593
That means that deep down
you love yourself.

979
01:26:28,663 --> 01:26:31,894
- But you're so hot.
- Then so are you.

980
01:26:31,967 --> 01:26:33,935
Go fight for the woman you love.

981
01:26:34,035 --> 01:26:36,765
No. She went out with Carlos.
He is going to talk to her.

982
01:26:36,805 --> 01:26:38,397
Maybe I'll call her tomorrow.

983
01:26:38,473 --> 01:26:40,373
Let's get out of the tub,
let's go to the bedroom.

984
01:26:40,408 --> 01:26:42,069
She's with him because
you were rude to her

985
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:45,671
and told her to get lost.
You don't say that to a woman.

986
01:26:46,381 --> 01:26:48,008
And, besides, you only said that

987
01:26:48,049 --> 01:26:51,382
because that scoundrel
didn't tell you she was real.

988
01:26:52,153 --> 01:26:55,350
Tonight is a glorious night
for your bastard friend.

989
01:26:56,191 --> 01:26:59,592
Where does he go
to celebrate his glory nights?

990
01:27:01,062 --> 01:27:02,757
Dry Martini at Pietro's.

991
01:27:04,566 --> 01:27:07,057
I feel like going out for a drink.

992
01:27:19,414 --> 01:27:21,006
You look beautiful tonight.

993
01:27:22,117 --> 01:27:25,484
- Carlos, we need to talk about Pedro.
- We have to, don't we?

994
01:27:26,087 --> 01:27:27,281
I saw the way he looked at you.

995
01:27:27,355 --> 01:27:29,915
I think you two are closer than
you are letting on.

996
01:27:30,058 --> 01:27:32,959
- The lovebirds...
- Lúcia, please.

997
01:27:33,061 --> 01:27:33,891
Carlos.

998
01:27:33,929 --> 01:27:36,227
- Carlos, Lúcia.
- My pleasure!

999
01:27:36,298 --> 01:27:38,823
- What a surprise! You didn't tell.

1000
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:41,767
We a nephew on the way.
Or a niece.

1001
01:27:41,803 --> 01:27:44,601
- A nephew. A nephew.
- Wonderful.

1002
01:27:49,144 --> 01:27:52,011
- Carlos, Carlos.
- I wanted to say that...

1003
01:27:52,714 --> 01:27:56,514
The last couple of weeks have been
very special for me.

1004
01:27:56,551 --> 01:27:58,849
- For us.
- Carlos, I think you lied to me.

1005
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,115
You said Pedro
was merely a co-worker.

1006
01:28:01,189 --> 01:28:02,986
Carlos, look at me!

1007
01:28:03,024 --> 01:28:04,924
Right. I mean...

1008
01:28:07,529 --> 01:28:10,054
We are more than just co-workers.

1009
01:28:10,365 --> 01:28:13,300
Pedro is gay. I knew it!
I told you he was strange.

1010
01:28:16,204 --> 01:28:18,331
I'm trying to tell you something
very difficult and complicated.

1011
01:28:18,406 --> 01:28:19,304
Just say it.

1012
01:28:20,809 --> 01:28:24,267
The truth is... Pedro!

1013
01:28:26,481 --> 01:28:27,641
Pedro, I'm not real.

1014
01:28:27,782 --> 01:28:30,342
- Did you invite the nutcase?
- Of course not.

1015
01:28:30,585 --> 01:28:31,415
Sit.

1016
01:28:33,421 --> 01:28:35,480
Why is he doing that?

1017
01:28:36,858 --> 01:28:37,984
Good evening.

1018
01:28:39,628 --> 01:28:42,495
Did he tell you? He didn't?
He didn't? Did he?

1019
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:44,555
- Tell me what?
- Vitória, calm down.

1020
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:48,328
- I was about to tell her.
- Tell me what?

1021
01:28:49,604 --> 01:28:51,697
Something about Pedro's illness.

1022
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:54,174
Illness? What illness?

1023
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:57,109
Were you aware he had an illness?
Did you use protection?

1024
01:28:57,145 --> 01:28:59,978
- Punch him in the face.
- I can't do that. He's my friend.

1025
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:01,777
He's making you look like a nutcase.

1026
01:29:01,816 --> 01:29:05,809
- What's going on?
- What's this, Pedro? What?

1027
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:07,785
- Aw!
- My God!

1028
01:29:08,423 --> 01:29:09,947
What's that?

1029
01:29:10,992 --> 01:29:14,257
- I'm leaving.
- Leave now? No way!

1030
01:29:20,001 --> 01:29:23,027
- It's time she knew the truth.
- Now?

1031
01:29:23,104 --> 01:29:24,901
He's talking to the air. Did you see?

1032
01:29:24,973 --> 01:29:27,999
Pedro, Pedro, look at me.
Who are talking to?

1033
01:29:31,913 --> 01:29:36,077
- I'm talking to Amanda.
- Amanda...

1034
01:29:37,619 --> 01:29:39,644
My God,
so that means that the book...

1035
01:29:39,788 --> 01:29:41,779
was a biography.

1036
01:29:41,923 --> 01:29:45,324
Not only is he gay,
but he's a spiritist too. Let it go, sis.

1037
01:29:45,393 --> 01:29:47,190
You punched your co-worker.

1038
01:29:47,228 --> 01:29:50,197
He's notjust my co-worker.
Excuse me, Amanda.

1039
01:29:50,331 --> 01:29:53,562
He's much more than that.
He's my brother.

1040
01:29:54,069 --> 01:29:58,096
And he made me believe that
you were a figment of my imagination.

1041
01:29:58,173 --> 01:30:02,166
I've been sitting quietly all this time,
but now I'm going to speak.

1042
01:30:06,581 --> 01:30:11,348
He asked me to go to her apartment
to find out if she was real or not.

1043
01:30:11,419 --> 01:30:14,320
I went, but no one was there.

1044
01:30:14,355 --> 01:30:16,550
I was in bad shape the day
I left the hospital,

1045
01:30:16,624 --> 01:30:18,649
My best friend was nuts.

1046
01:30:18,727 --> 01:30:20,388
Then my phone rang,
and I answered it.

1047
01:30:20,462 --> 01:30:23,192
Of course
I can come by your apartment.

1048
01:30:23,398 --> 01:30:26,424
It was the girl I had bumped into
a couple of times in the street.

1049
01:30:26,534 --> 01:30:29,560
Apartament number 807...

1050
01:30:29,671 --> 01:30:32,834
It was your street, your building,
your neighbor!

1051
01:30:36,244 --> 01:30:37,233
Alakazam!

1052
01:30:37,378 --> 01:30:39,005
Enough, sis!

1053
01:30:39,047 --> 01:30:41,242
From now on the world
will meet a new Vitória.

1054
01:30:41,549 --> 01:30:44,950
- He doesn't deserve you.
- I'm not moving away anymore.

1055
01:30:45,053 --> 01:30:48,113
- You're not?
- I called the origami guy.

1056
01:30:48,223 --> 01:30:51,090
What do you mean
you called the origami guy?

1057
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:53,286
I asked him to come over.

1058
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:55,294
And I'm going to fuck him.

1059
01:30:55,363 --> 01:30:57,490
Vitória, for God's sake,
he could be an asshole.

1060
01:30:57,532 --> 01:31:01,195
Then he'll be
the third asshole in my life.

1061
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:07,174
Are you by any chance Vitória?

1062
01:31:10,545 --> 01:31:13,070
And then this goddess opened the door.

1063
01:31:13,148 --> 01:31:16,606
Do you know what she did?
Do you? Huh?

1064
01:31:18,086 --> 01:31:19,815
She kissed me.

1065
01:31:21,589 --> 01:31:24,353
She said she wanted
to make love to me.

1066
01:31:26,294 --> 01:31:31,561
I started sweating, my chest was tight
and I felt like I was drunk.

1067
01:31:32,133 --> 01:31:37,901
I realized that I was in love
for the first time in my life.

1068
01:31:39,007 --> 01:31:41,498
He's being sincere, Vitória.

1069
01:31:42,610 --> 01:31:46,046
That's why I couldn't tell you.

1070
01:31:46,147 --> 01:31:47,876
I was afraid you'd leave.

1071
01:31:54,189 --> 01:31:56,054
Marry me, Vitória.

1072
01:31:57,992 --> 01:32:01,086
Hey wacko,
aren't you going to say anything?

1073
01:32:03,665 --> 01:32:08,329
- Come on, Pedro.
- Dear God, what's this?

1074
01:32:09,304 --> 01:32:12,933
Go there and declare your love for her.

1075
01:32:13,408 --> 01:32:15,239
Fight for what you want.

1076
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:20,948
And I'll go away forever.

1077
01:32:22,817 --> 01:32:29,188
- Are you sure?
- You're the one who's sure.

1078
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:38,331
Oh, my God.

1079
01:32:45,039 --> 01:32:47,269
I am what you are.

1080
01:32:51,579 --> 01:32:53,547
I am what you are.

1081
01:32:54,382 --> 01:32:57,146
I'm loneliness longing for companionship.

1082
01:32:57,285 --> 01:33:00,482
I'm a man searching for a woman,

1083
01:33:00,588 --> 01:33:02,818
the mother of my children.

1084
01:33:02,957 --> 01:33:09,055
I want someone to share
the mystery of this life.

1085
01:33:09,297 --> 01:33:13,563
And more than anything,
I want to marry you, Vitória.

1086
01:33:14,836 --> 01:33:18,772
Because I'm sure you're the best thing
I've ever done.

1087
01:33:59,047 --> 01:34:02,107
- Wow, Vitória.
- You're both completely insane.

1088
01:34:04,052 --> 01:34:05,019
Vitória!

1089
01:34:06,654 --> 01:34:09,179
Give me a break.
Vitória!

1090
01:34:27,308 --> 01:34:29,640
2 YEARS LATER

1091
01:34:42,056 --> 01:34:44,149
- You?
- Sueli.

1092
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:50,793
- Thank you very much.
- Good reading!

1093
01:34:57,238 --> 01:34:58,728
To my best friend.

1094
01:35:11,919 --> 01:35:13,648
I don't believe it.

1095
01:35:14,455 --> 01:35:15,615
Triplets.

1096
01:35:18,026 --> 01:35:19,459
- No, no, no...
- Here.

1097
01:35:20,028 --> 01:35:22,019
They're gorgeous, aren't they?

1098
01:35:22,063 --> 01:35:24,623
- What's the mother like?
- This is a question...

1099
01:35:24,766 --> 01:35:29,726
I married Bárbara.

1100
01:35:30,605 --> 01:35:33,369
- Big Barbara?
- Yes, Big Barbara, Pedro!

1101
01:35:33,408 --> 01:35:34,500
Big Barbara!

1102
01:35:35,376 --> 01:35:38,539
- I've hooked, man. Hooked.
- Shameless!

1103
01:35:38,946 --> 01:35:42,211
I think we deserve each other.

1104
01:35:44,152 --> 01:35:45,346
What about you?

1105
01:35:47,255 --> 01:35:49,155
Did you get married?

1106
01:35:51,926 --> 01:35:54,258
I hope one day you can forgive me.

1107
01:35:56,264 --> 01:35:59,700
That's water under the bridge, buddy.

1108
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:05,730
Have you been seeing anyone?

1109
01:36:06,874 --> 01:36:09,672
No, I haven't seen anyone.

1110
01:36:17,285 --> 01:36:18,946
I have a gift for you.

1111
01:36:20,555 --> 01:36:22,045
A great one.

1112
01:36:28,596 --> 01:36:30,359
Traffic tickets!

1113
01:36:30,465 --> 01:36:33,491
They're notjust
any traffic tickets.

1114
01:36:33,601 --> 01:36:38,334
They're traffic tickets
from Minas Gerais.

1115
01:36:40,308 --> 01:36:43,175
Under the name...

1116
01:36:45,179 --> 01:36:47,374
Vitória...

1117
01:36:48,716 --> 01:36:50,206
Monteiro.

1118
01:38:27,515 --> 01:38:29,278
It's got your name on it.

1119
01:38:36,524 --> 01:38:37,513
I saw it.

1120
01:38:37,892 --> 01:38:41,055
- So, you read it?
- Yes.

1121
01:38:44,198 --> 01:38:48,259
- What did you think?
- You didn't have the right to do this to me.

1122
01:38:51,239 --> 01:38:52,536
You hated it?

1123
01:38:56,477 --> 01:38:58,502
I loved it.

1124
01:39:27,508 --> 01:39:30,204
Didn't I tell you
she was going to love it?
