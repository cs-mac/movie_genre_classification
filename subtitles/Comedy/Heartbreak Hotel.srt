1
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,397
Hello! Listen...

2
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,759
Please, l've been looking for a
parking space for 20 minutes now.

3
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,196
l'm going to wedding.

4
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,751
Are you listening to me?
l know l'm in the wrong.

5
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,914
But my son is getting married. lsn't
there a speck of kindness in you?

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,118
Yes, but you can't park there.

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,751
– l'm only doing my job.
– What a bloody awful job.

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:22,030
– Should l put it on the car...
– You can stuff it up your ass!

9
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,873
Fucking cow.

10
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,228
Excuse me... What did you say?

11
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,918
– Nothing.
– You said ''fucking cow''.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,393
When l said ''up your ass'',
you said ''fucking cow''.

13
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,793
Those are your words. l've never
said ''fucking cow'' in all my...

14
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,759
''Fucking cow'' is the worst thing
a person can say!

15
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,355
lf it wasn't that, what did you say?

16
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,513
l said:
''l'll put it there for now''.

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,718
l can report you for this.

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:09,796
And l can report you for harassing
a public official. Assaulting.

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,396
– Did l hit you?
– You hit my cap.

20
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,192
You harassed a private citizen. You
don't call someone a ''fucking cow''.

21
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,398
Stuff it up yourself,
you fucking cow!

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,915
Hello! You haven't started yet,
that's great. Good luck!

23
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,075
Jesus Christ!

24
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,236
Sorry l'm late, Mattias. l love you.

25
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:05,156
– Nice of you to show up.
– l was called a ''fucking cow''.

26
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:11,793
– What are you talking about?
– A traffic warden... Stand up.

27
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,156
Sit down.

28
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,279
She looks like she's 1 4.

29
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,397
This is insane,
they're still children.

30
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,231
– She looks insane?
– She's pretty, but they're so young.

31
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,272
Now make your vows in the presence
of this congregation.

32
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,990
l, August Mattias Ek...

33
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,757
l, August Mattias Ek...

34
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,550
Take thee, Anna Cecilia Österlund...

35
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,952
He's only doing this
as a demonstration against us.

36
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,397
...as my lawful wedded wife.

37
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,271
– For better or for worse.
– And remain faithful unto you...

38
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,478
And remain faithful unto you...

39
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,678
...until death us do part.

40
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,949
Ring–a–ding–ding.

41
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,352
Steady as she goes...

42
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,069
What can l say? l'm happy.

43
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,550
l'm looking at you two.
This is serious.

44
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,320
Hi.

45
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,315
– Are you sure you don't want some?
– Yes.

46
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,748
– Why don't you go ahead?
– No, l'll take it easy tonight.

47
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,756
– And watch some TV?
– l'm going to defrost the freezer...

48
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,551
You can't spend a Friday
night defrosting the freezer, Mum!

49
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,192
– Of course you can.
– Sure, but is it any fun?

50
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:02,159
You never have fun. All you ever do
is the laundry or the cleaning.

51
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,509
You do crossword puzzles or watch TV.
That's not much of a life, is it?

52
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,433
ls it?

53
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,990
This could be nice:
''Wenche Myhre, 50 years on stage''...

54
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,677
– Do you enjoy defrosting the freezer?
– No, but l like that performer.

55
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,912
Some aren't any good, you know.

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,278
– Like Jill Johnson.
– ls she in something?

57
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,989
Yes. l don't think she's any good.

58
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,074
She's on ''Crossword'' tonight,
so l won't watch that.

59
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,789
She's too much.

60
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,238
Too glamorous...
lt's all an act.

61
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,270
– But Wenche Myhre actually sweats.
– ls that how you spend your time?

62
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,674
Being annoyed
with the guests on ''Crossword''?

63
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,470
– No.
– But you're saying Jill's a joke?

64
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,999
Well then... lt was fantastic
to see you in church today.

65
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,390
Very moving.

66
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,951
We were just talking about
how good you look together.

67
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,558
And no you're man and wife.
You've always been something of...

68
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,394
You've been philosophical
all your life.

69
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,472
l'm very moved.

70
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,270
l thought of something the philosopher
Martin Buber once said,

71
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,434
that the basic unit of a living
society consists of two people.

72
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,675
That means that our encounter with
this other person creates us.

73
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,311
We are created through
our encounters with others.

74
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,475
That's an inspiring thought
when it comes to marriage.

75
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,398
That's just the way things are.
Go on, Lotta.

76
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,749
Don't waste your time here with me.
''Green Rooms'' is on first.

77
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,029
Why don't you come along and
have a drink? A glass of wine.

78
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,870
''A fighter'', four letters.
''Stubborn''... That's too long.

79
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,988
They're tricky. ''April man''...
That could be...

80
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,913
lf it had been three letters,
l could have put in ''Åke''.

81
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,199
– Your dad's birthday was in April.
– Dad's not here anymore.

82
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,431
Why don't you do things on your own?

83
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:58,153
When Dad was here, you went out
all the time. Didn't you enjoy that?

84
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,995
– Didn't you have fun?
– Yes, l did.

85
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,598
– Don't you want to have fun again?
– Liselotte, you don't understand.

86
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,708
What? How hard is it to go out
dancing or have a drink?

87
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,839
Go out and have a drink on your own.

88
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,109
l could never go to a bar.
Those days are over.

89
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,398
– Can you picture your mum at a bar?
– Yes.

90
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,234
My life is here.

91
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,440
This is the way things are,
this is my life right now.

92
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,830
Well, Mattias, you know...

93
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,755
...how things are. Your mother and l
are getting a divorce.

94
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,073
This situation
is something of a paradox.

95
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,349
So when you walk this winding road,
and there will be twists and turns...

96
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,389
But don't worry,
remember Fellini's words.

97
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,836
He said something like:

98
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,074
''l problemi dell'amanti sono
renovazione dell'amore.''

99
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,633
''Marital quarrels and problems
bring the renewal of love.''

100
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,909
By this l mean that l believe
in the institution of marriage.

101
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,518
Marriage is a worthy pursuit.
You are an inspiration to us today.

102
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:40,437
As Brel put it:
''La tendre guerre'' – the tender war.

103
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,229
– Don't you want to meet people?
– No.

104
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,675
You'd rather watch TV all alone?

105
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,274
– What's wrong?
– Nothing's wrong.

106
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,194
By the way,
l made an appointment for you.

107
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,514
– What are you talking about?
– That...

108
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,630
l asked my gynaecologist
if she could give you a check–up.

109
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,716
l don't understand. Why would l
need to go to a gynaecologist?

110
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,510
– l have stomach pains.
– Everything's connected.

111
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,390
So she can probably see what's wrong.

112
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,036
Why would you do
something like this?

113
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,112
Why do you attack my life?

114
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,274
My stomach is my business.
l won't go to that kind of a doctor.

115
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,830
lf you like that sort of thing,
do it yourself.

116
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,514
Mothers don't traditionally make
wedding speeches, l know.

117
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,674
And the fathers have done a good job
already, my ex–husband in particular.

118
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,996
As usual, he has quoted everyone
from great men to crabs.

119
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,313
That is why l would like to talk about
my beloved son Mattias,

120
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,394
and about Anna,
who l don't know that well yet.

121
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,314
You haven't known each other
for very long. A year?

122
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,396
And l'd like
to talk about marriage, too.

123
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:57,068
Since my ex–husband
has made our divorce so public.

124
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,029
The paperwork has been completed,
and everything is finalised.

125
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,274
And l'd like to tell you, Henrik,
that something happens...

126
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,469
...when you spend 20 years together.

127
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,350
There are lots of wonderful moments,
but you become invisible.

128
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,719
Henrik can dazzle people with quotes.

129
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:30,592
And what about me?
l've tried to study, to be someone.

130
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,592
But it's hard with Henrik around.

131
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,911
And when l finally say something...

132
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,269
...he turns into
this lovable, crazy ltalian.

133
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,038
You're crazy! Talking about
our divorce at this wedding.

134
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,158
So l won't do that.
l just want to wish you...

135
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,870
...the very best of luck.

136
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,439
Okay. l just want to say thank you.

137
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,037
Thank you.

138
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,554
Hello...

139
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,552
...again.

140
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,393
l'm Elisabeth Staf.

141
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,833
You're welcome.

142
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,631
You can put your clothes back on,
because we'll start by talking.

143
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,797
When you're ready,
come and sit.

144
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,758
God...

145
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,834
Sorry. There was
such a traffic jam out front...

146
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,310
Your bag is under your top.

147
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,870
Yes, she went in. All by herself.

148
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,396
l think she felt strong today.

149
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,669
l saw her go into the doctor's office,
but l don't know when she'll be done.

150
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,957
l'm not sure she knows
about getting undressed

151
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,830
and putting your legs up
in those stirrups. lt's tough on her.

152
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,277
Because she never shows herself...

153
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,353
Of course
she doesn't want to show her...

154
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,271
Could you inch down a bit closer?
And l'll just lift your skirt...

155
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,194
God, l feel so naked.

156
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,957
lt's been ten years since your
last examination. You can handle it.

157
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,838
Let's give it another go.

158
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,118
One leg... And the other.

159
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,591
Now come closer.
Rest on your behind.

160
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,071
Now l'll lift your skirt...
just a little. That's it.

161
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,833
ls that okay?

162
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,789
l'll start a standard examination.
The procedure is painless.

163
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,591
l'll be using a spatula
that looks like this.

164
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,751
Here. And some lubricant.

165
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,751
– How do you feel?
– Just fine.

166
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,552
My, that's bright...

167
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,074
Blue light is good.

168
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,950
Blue light has... extra strength.

169
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,396
– Unlike...
– Gudrun.

170
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,316
– So far, so good.
– Good.

171
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,312
Okay? Everything looks normal.

172
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:40,511
The next step is to check
your ovaries and your womb.

173
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,116
– More lubricant.
– Are you going to put your hand in?

174
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,877
– Please...
– You can do it, l know you can.

175
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,069
– lnch down a bit closer.
– lt feels better now...

176
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,793
Nice curtains... Those red tulips...

177
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,838
lt's nice to have something pretty...
That hurts!

178
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,799
That's because
l'm feeling your ovary.

179
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,312
You should have a picture
on the ceiling...

180
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,278
– That hurts too.
– Your other ovary.

181
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,592
Right... perfectly normal.

182
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:30,438
Look, l won't be sending
in that parking ticket.

183
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,672
And l won't report you.

184
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,550
l'll just give you an ultrasound scan,
and we're done.

185
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,588
l will be inserting this,
so l'll put a condom on it.

186
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,549
– God, oh my God...
– Exactly, my job...

187
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,633
What a bloody awful job you have!

188
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,919
– Sorry...
– l help people.

189
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,393
– More lubricant.
– More lubricant.

190
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,552
Would you like to have a look?

191
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,351
Look at the screen.
Let's see...

192
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,958
Everything looks perfectly normal.
l took a Pap smear.

193
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,751
lf you don't hear from us in the next
two weeks, everything's fine. But...

194
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,834
...as far as l can tell...
everything looks good.

195
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,238
Thank you.

196
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,278
Hi. Were you thinking of parking here?

197
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,434
That's a ''no waiting'' sign. Move on.

198
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,117
– 41 0 here, over.
– Can you deal wlth a complalnt?

199
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,832
– What address?
– Kungsgatan 5. A loadlng zone.

200
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,356
Kungsgatan 5, a loading zone.

201
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,833
Kungsgatan 5, a loading zone. Roger.
– Gudrun Nyman speaking.

202
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,399
What's this? Hi, Tias.

203
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,918
– What's this?
– A dog.

204
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,790
– Who's dog?
– Anna's and mine.

205
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,599
Darling... What do they say?

206
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,515
''A pipe, a dog, a pair
of slippers, and you're done for.''

207
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,309
You get so tied down.

208
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:50,715
A dog will tie you down.
All you need now are children.

209
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,078
– Has Dad been here?
– No, absolutely not.

210
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,678
He came over to our place yesterday.
We talked about you.

211
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,073
– You have to talk to him.
– lt's impossible to talk to your dad.

212
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,838
– He's trying to reach out.
– Only because of the divorce.

213
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,356
He hasn't made an effort before.

214
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,398
He's devastated.

215
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:26,318
There he is in town and
here you are in the bloody country.

216
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,873
– What do you do in the evening?
– Have fun. l go out dancing.

217
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,432
Who do you dance with?
Do you dance with different guys?

218
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,356
l'm 41 . Aren't l allowed
to go out dancing?

219
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,798
– You go out alone.
– What's wrong with that?

220
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,159
lt's cheap. You're my mother,
you can't go out like some...

221
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,993
ls it only for people in their 20s?

222
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,029
You don't go out, you stay home!

223
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,956
What if you meet one of your patients?
Do you go out with your patients?

224
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:15,388
Can't doctors go out?
l happen to love to dance.

225
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,675
Okay.

226
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,469
Then go ahead, go out dancing.

227
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,759
With those... bloody guys
you dance with.

228
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,190
Hi!

229
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,115
Hello again.

230
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,036
l'll come over after this dance.
Order a ''today's special'' for me.

231
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,671
– lt's a bit late for lunch...
– Funny!

232
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,310
Hi, Liselotte. lt's Mum.
l took your advice,

233
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,110
and l'm out trying
to have a good time.

234
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,079
And here... You can hear for yourself.

235
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,519
lt's no fun at all here.

236
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,833
l'm on my way home
and we can talk about it later.

237
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,708
Gertrud...

238
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,636
You say you're a lesbian,
and l'm telling you you're pregnant.

239
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,872
You'll have to tell your partner
you're a bisexual.

240
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,157
That won't be easy.

241
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,912
l have other issues,
but this is my job.

242
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,790
l find my job interesting.

243
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,079
– Maybe you should find anotherjob.
– What?

244
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,314
– Find something else to do.
– Do you speak Swedish?

245
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,430
Yes. What of it? ls it so strange
that people speak two languages?

246
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,072
ls this the first time you ever met
a bilingual person?

247
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:36,555
l'm not going to pay 700 crowns just
because l had to buy cigarettes.

248
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,758
You made me feel embarrassed...

249
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,673
Why are you speaking English?

250
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,031
ls that Gudrun Nyman? This is
Elisabeth Staf, your gynaecologist.

251
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,510
We met...

252
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,512
Hello?

253
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,990
– Gudrun Nyman.
– Hi, l think we were cut off.

254
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:33,118
The test results. You said
you'd get back to me, and...

255
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,275
When you called, l thought...
You can give it to me straight.

256
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,114
The results were negative.
l mean, positive.

257
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,318
– Are you sure?
– Yes, you're in perfect health.

258
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,838
l'm calling for personal reasons.

259
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,517
lt's interesting how we've run into
each other three times recently.

260
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,958
And the circumstances
have been rather unusual too.

261
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:09,114
So l figured l would call you up
and ask you

262
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,115
if you'd like to join me next weekend
and go to Heartbreak Hotel together.

263
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,115
l believe in fate.

264
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,638
The first time we met, you called me
l won't mention what...

265
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,477
The second time, you came to me.

266
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,556
And l looked at your...
l won't mention that either.

267
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,315
The third time was here at Heartbreak.

268
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,474
Three times in two weeks,
it has to mean something.

269
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,553
Well, l guess
you could see it that way.

270
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,189
When l saw you
with that flower in your hair,

271
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,910
it struck me that you need to dance.

272
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,518
lt's pure joy. Besides,
you never know who you'll meet.

273
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,958
Look, this is terrible. l have these
huge bags under my eyes.

274
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,114
And when l do this, the bags go...

275
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,671
lt's depressing.
But still...

276
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:25,749
– What about a guy like that?
– He could be dating my daughter.

277
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,709
Sure, but he could just as well
be dating you.

278
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,429
l don't think he'd agree.

279
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,753
Why aren't you more confident?

280
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,879
You're attractive, tall
and you have presence...

281
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,636
You're only annoying
when you're in uniform.

282
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,748
– Apart from that, you're very nice.
– Thank you.

283
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,630
lf you find a man attractive,
say yes if he asks you to dance.

284
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,235
lf you don't, say no.

285
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,350
And if no one asks you to dance,
you can go up and dance anyway.

286
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,194
You don't have to wait around.
Look, there he is again.

287
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,909
You're starting to open up.
lt's true!

288
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,599
l don't get it, say a person's been
dancing with somebody all night...

289
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,390
– Or if you...
– Let's keep it general.

290
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,790
lf you dance all night
with the same man,

291
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,793
and would like to go home with him,
is that what you mean?

292
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,668
Then that's what a person does.
Go home with him.

293
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,196
But you don't know him.

294
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,636
That can be nice.

295
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,395
To not get in too deep.

296
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,316
– And if a person, like us...
– What do you mean, ''deep''?

297
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,269
Not being tied down.
You can be free.

298
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,477
– Free from what?
– Him.

299
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,394
Who do you mean?

300
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,112
– Don't you have a husband either?
– l've just divorced.

301
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,475
Are you sad?

302
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,838
No, l'm happy...

303
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,391
...to be able to be myself.

304
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,677
Couldn't you be yourself
with your husband?

305
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,876
Here he comes...

306
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,396
– Excuse me, what's your name?
– Oskar.

307
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,029
– This is Gudrun.
– Oh, no...

308
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,078
See? ''Oskar''.

309
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,597
lt's no big deal
to ask a guy his name.

310
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,629
Then you can go over to him and say:
''Like to go to my place, Oskar?''

311
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,395
Do you actually do that?

312
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,268
lt's no bigger deal than that.

313
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,875
Come on, Gudrun.

314
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,952
You're a widow and l'm divorced.

315
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,270
Let's go, have some fun.

316
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,320
We've been standing here for five
minutes, let's go downstairs...

317
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,076
– She looks 1 4.
– People here are 23 and up.

318
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,073
– Like some chewing–gum?
– Chew and dance at the same time?

319
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,311
Tuck it under your tongue,
it freshens...

320
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,712
You don't have to wait to be asked.

321
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,033
– Want to dance?
– Yes... No, she doesn't.

322
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,113
– There was your chance.
– Lisa, please. l can't...

323
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,668
Don't you understand?

324
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,355
He was... much too short.

325
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,958
He looked short, because he was
standing a few steps further down.

326
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:00,149
– Do you really want to dance?
– That's why we're here.

327
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,789
All right, let's dance.

328
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,991
Anders, two Baileys.
Put lots of ice in one of them.

329
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,995
– Now that was a good–looking guy.
– l missed him.

330
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,117
l feel so out of place.

331
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,398
What's under that top?

332
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,109
That's a lovely camisole!

333
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,637
– Take it off.
– No, l feel so naked.

334
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,033
That's the point. Look around,
that's how people here dress.

335
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,759
Do you have pierced ears?

336
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,630
l thought you were
going to ask me if l had shaved.

337
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,076
Thank you. – Cheers!

338
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,069
Oh, my poor feet!

339
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:30,439
Lisa, l just have to... Thank you.

340
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,832
– Don't cry...
– Thank you for bringing me along.

341
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,358
l had a wonderful time. lt's great
to dance away your cares.

342
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,514
lt's a lot of fun.
lt releases so much.

343
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,070
Good night.

344
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,119
My God, he was all over me.

345
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,476
– Go after him.
– No, it's fine.

346
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,680
– Like to do this again?
– Only if l'm not in the way.

347
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,639
You're not, l'm on my own too.

348
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,197
Well then, Moa...

349
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,072
This is week seven of your pregnancy
and everything looks fine.

350
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,955
So far, so good.

351
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,669
How do you feel about having a baby?

352
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,116
Well...

353
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:56,993
l don't think l'm quite
used to it yet... The thought of it.

354
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:03,558
– What about your partner?
– God...

355
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,509
– You do know who the father is?
– Yes.

356
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:16,995
Tell him you're pregnant as soon as
possible, for everyone's sake.

357
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,755
And if you are... close enough,

358
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,311
he ought to come along
the next time you have a check–up.

359
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:31,316
l don't know how you feel about that.

360
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,551
Well, you see...

361
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,352
Actually, l don't think...

362
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,592
l don't want him
to help me with the baby.

363
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,629
– You can fix it on your own.
– Yes.

364
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,871
– Have you been up the Eiffel Tower?
– No.

365
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,080
– You wouldn't believe how high it is!
– That's what it's famous for.

366
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,951
Maybe we could go there.
You and me. What do you say?

367
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:15,149
– ls that where you tried this?
– Put some salt in the hollow.

368
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,028
That's right. That's enough.

369
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,078
Then you snort it up your nose.

370
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,271
– Oh, no...
– l was only joking.

371
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,638
You're supposed to lick it up.

372
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,192
Then you swirl your glass and slam it
on the counter. One, two, three...

373
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,156
Three glasses of white wine, please.

374
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,516
Oh, this is so good.

375
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,991
– What's this?
– lt's not yours.

376
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:39,997
Could we have two todays,
or was that yesterdays? Never mind...

377
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,278
That's our drink...

378
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:50,151
That's disgusting.
Let's take this instead.

379
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,270
ls that Lotta over there?

380
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,672
Liselotte! l'm out with your mum.

381
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,910
Do you think it's fun to see your mum
out dancing, dead drunk?!

382
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,589
– You just don't get it, Liselotte.
– What do you mean? Stop it!

383
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,753
Mum! You're too bloody old.

384
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,752
The ''little old lady''
is a thing of the past!

385
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,470
– l'm looking at two old ladies!
– Shut your mouth!

386
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,757
You shut your mouth!

387
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,877
Both of you are shouting too much.

388
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,953
– Why did you have to start a fight?
– She said... – Hi.

389
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,077
Go on, shout. Tell her she's a slut.

390
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,269
– Let's clear this up. She says...
– Pay no attention to her.

391
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,069
She doesn't understand what we have.

392
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:07,157
– You don't understand what we have!
– Then tell me!

393
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,152
Would you like
to see your mum at a club?

394
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,119
– Unfortunately, my mother's dead...
– Of course she's dead!

395
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,478
But my mum isn't dead, she goes
to the same bloody club as me!

396
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,994
Having fun!

397
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,632
– We dance and do as we please.
– Exactly, we do as we please!

398
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,996
– Do you have a problem with that?
– You're disgusting.

399
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,438
– 45–year–olds shouldn't go out...
– l'm 41 .

400
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,310
She's 42.
And even if l was 55 and she was 52,

401
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,111
or if she was 65 and l was 75, we'd
still have the right to go dancing!

402
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,638
We don't have to wear stupid hats,
or have permanented hair,

403
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,553
just because we're over 40!

404
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,276
She deserved it.

405
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,596
Let's drop the subject.

406
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,798
What's this?

407
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,637
You obviously expect something,
if you bought condoms.

408
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,556
You need to be prepared.
My mum used to say that.

409
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,997
One is missing.
Have you been up to something?

410
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,038
You have to practice at home.

411
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,557
– On who?
– On my finger.

412
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,995
We have to meet guys
if you want to use them.

413
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,551
Someone to use them on. Right?

414
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,438
Which one?

415
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,035
The tall guy.

416
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,317
One, two, three...

417
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,478
– We don't know your names.
– Then we realised...

418
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,475
– Take it easy.
– lt's more exciting to not know.

419
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,314
– So, what's your name?
– Don't tell him.

420
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,791
– Marilyn.
– Marilyn Monroe.

421
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,839
– We have a plan.
– So tell me your plan.

422
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,357
We were thinking
about leaving this place... with you.

423
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,639
– What?
– That we'll leave with them.

424
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,111
– One question: How old are you?
– How old...?

425
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,035
– l can usually do this. Look.
– He asked how old we are.

426
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:36,035
– How much have you been drinking?
– 41 ... 32.

427
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,635
– What's going on?
– l'm 25.

428
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,756
No more drinking, girls.

429
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,709
– How old are you?
– l'm 25.

430
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,078
– My son is 21 .
– Let's go, Jimmy.

431
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,913
Knock it off.

432
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,996
– l suddenly felt...
– You've had too much to drink.

433
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,915
– Don't feel bad.
– l don't, but l mentioned my son...

434
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,788
– And l felt...
– Cool it.

435
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,839
– No more drinking, girls.
– Did you start fighting?

436
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,913
Christ, he was aggressive.
l don't know why.

437
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,629
That was no good.

438
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,989
When he said: ''l'm 25'',
and l told him my son was 21 ,

439
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,674
it was like crossing a line.

440
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,871
Why wouldn't they go home with us?
Because we're old!

441
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,636
They thought we were too damn old.

442
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,670
My son said l was a ''teenile'',
a senile teenager.

443
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,752
– Tina?
– Teenile!

444
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,876
What?

445
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,714
ls that really...? Ow, my feet hurt!

446
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,432
– Haven't you ever had an orgasm?
– Did l say that?

447
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,435
You just did. You said:
''l've never had an orgasm''.

448
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,149
No, l never said that.

449
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:20,070
You should have used
those condoms of yours!

450
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,948
What's the use of all those condoms?

451
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,635
l thought we'd be using them up
right and left.

452
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,793
But here we are
with an untouched packet.

453
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:37,000
Look, Jill Johnson. She knows.
– Jill! How do you do it?!

454
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,356
She makes me sick.

455
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:47,073
– She is so oily, so unreal!
– She's so pretty! And clever.

456
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,358
Teach us! Because l don't know
how it's done, either!

457
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:58,437
– All she's got are tits.
– l'm not ''Crazy in Love''!

458
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,796
They're huge!

459
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:09,150
Would you ever consider implants?
l would never...

460
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,951
– What did you say?
– She's fixed everything.

461
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,952
Her teeth are so white.

462
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,794
Here are my cigarettes.
Want to smoke?

463
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:30,196
Jesus Christ! lt's the police.
l nearly wet myself!

464
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,319
Finally. Now's our chance. Come on.

465
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,428
ls it two men? Yes.
Now we're on...

466
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,878
Hi. – lt's our last chance.

467
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,159
– Good morning, good morning.
– Hello...

468
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,948
She's taking me from behind...

469
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,353
But it's all right
to do it from the front, too.

470
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:09,352
– Have you been out having fun?
– Yes, a pity you weren't there.

471
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,069
Look at what she has in her bag.

472
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,958
– Are you all right?
– Of course.

473
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,192
Do you have handcuffs?
Put them on.

474
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,149
– Why don't you go on home?
– Wouldn't you like to come along?

475
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:29,028
No, they don't want to. – Bye.

476
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:33,398
lf we fall down,
l bet they'll go with us.

477
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,428
Take us from behind!

478
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,429
He can lift me.

479
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,515
Keep this up, and you'll be taking
the underground instead!

480
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,434
Or we'll move your car...

481
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,797
Old fart... – Move it!

482
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,510
At this stage, an ultrasound scan
may show the baby's sex.

483
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,673
When Anders asked if that was
the baby's penis, l said yes.

484
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,072
l assumed you wanted to know
the baby's gender.

485
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:34,154
And of course you're right,
girls do not have willies.

486
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:43,913
You're expecting a boy.
Only don't blame me, blame Anders.

487
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,117
l don't know
how to talk to her about it.

488
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,557
Look what's in her mouth.

489
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:58,077
– Do you have a dog?
– lt's my son's.

490
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,676
They needed someone to look after it,
so mum came to the rescue.

491
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,912
– Nice dog.
– Yes...

492
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:14,680
l have to get back to work,
l just had to...

493
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:21,438
We shouldn't feel bad,
we didn't do anything wrong.

494
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:27,436
We had fun. And next time
we'll skip the tequila.

495
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,876
Listen,
let's not talk about it anymore.

496
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,238
And those two guys... You know...

497
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:39,108
– No...
– Let's drop it.

498
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,749
Would you like to come over
to my place tonight?

499
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:47,277
Yes, l'll come over.
No tequila.

500
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,114
Cheers!

501
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,432
They drove all the way
up to the doorway.

502
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:01,392
''You're crazy,'' l told them.
lt was like a fun fair.

503
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,076
''You can't pull in on the courtyard,
you'll wake the neighbours.''

504
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,472
– And you...
– My mind is a blank.

505
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,680
But l think l said something like:
''Show me your baton''.

506
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,389
Christ! But l...

507
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,395
Apart from the hang–over, something
else was ringing in my ears.

508
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:31,191
We can't drink like that.
We can go out dancing, but...

509
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,751
l won't say
that Liselotte was right...

510
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:41,949
– But we can't drink like that.
– No, it's too much.

511
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:47,239
But we can still have fun, right?

512
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:52,952
– What was ringing in your ears?
– A kind of headache...

513
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,476
...and the words:
''l've never had an orgasm''.

514
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:04,028
– l never said that.
– You did, didn't you?

515
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:09,638
So l'm asking you now:
Have you ever had an orgasm?

516
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,349
This cheese is good... Like some?

517
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,558
You must be out of your mind!

518
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:31,158
You don't have to make it breakfast.
lt won't fall asleep.

519
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,712
lt won't hurt your feelings.
And it can do something...

520
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:44,517
...very few men can do.
lt has a rotating tip.

521
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,355
And it has a little helper too.

522
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,069
Here you are.

523
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,199
Pick it up! Don't worry.

524
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,879
lt's not a substitute.
lt doesn't replace a man.

525
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,478
But it's...
lt can help you right now.

526
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:14,839
l mean, since we can't manage to pick
any men up because we're so drunk.

527
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:23,110
When you meet a new man, you can say:
''l've got a friend of yours here''.

528
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,948
Take it. Have a good time.
lt's not a man.

529
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,433
lt's an aid. That's what it is,
a bloody good little helper.

530
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,799
Don't show it to Liselotte,
she'll think you've lost your mind.

531
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:47,716
– Hide it. Let's change the subject.
– Could l just ask you one thing?

532
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,236
Let's say l have... an orgasm...

533
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,994
How will l know?
