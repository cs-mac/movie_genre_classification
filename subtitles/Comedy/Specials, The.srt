1
00:00:01,999 --> 00:00:08,999
At 2:50 a.m.

2
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:12,999
on November 11, 1918,
the Associated Press flashed the

3
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:16,999
announcement that an armistice
to end World War I had been

4
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:21,999
signed at 5:00 a.m. Paris time.
Overlooked in the excitement

5
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:24,999
was that hostilities
were not to cease

6
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:29,959
until 11:00 a.m. Paris time.
Factory whistles hooted.

7
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:34,959
People began pouring into the
streets, banging pots and pans.

8
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:41,999
The celebration was premature.
War still had six hours to run.

9
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:46,999
Even though it was certain that
it would end at 11:00, men were

10
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:52,999
being sent to fight and to die
in those final hours.

11
00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:01,834
Why, when it was known
to the last minute

12
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:04,999
that the war would end
and end with Allied victory,

13
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:15,999
- were men still sent into battle?
- Edwin James,

14
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:18,959
correspondent
of the<i> New York Times</i> covering

15
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,709
the 26th Yankee Division,
was stunned by the scene.

16
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,999
He wrote, "Reaching the front
this morning, expecting

17
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:28,999
to find quiet reigning in view
of the imminence of the

18
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:32,959
cessation of hostilities,
I found the attack

19
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:41,125
in full swing."
Why did French

20
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,999
field marshal Ferdinand Foch
and American AEF commander

21
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:47,999
John Pershing order
their armies to fight

22
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:52,125
to the last minute,
the 11th hour of the 11th day

23
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:56,999
of the 11th month?
Why didn't they stop fighting

24
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:59,999
when the Germans signed
the ceasefire rather than

25
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:07,999
six death-filled hours later?
>> On that last day

26
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:10,709
of World War I,
the American forces alone

27
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,959
suffered casualties
of over 3,200 men.

28
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,999
The fact that more men
were casualties

29
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:26,999
on November 11, 1918,
than on D-Day, June 6, 1944,

30
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:29,999
is more than just a historical
curiosity.

31
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:36,999
That senseless sacrifice of men
in the last 24 hours is,

32
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:43,999
in microcosm, World War I.
So what happened on the last day

33
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:47,709
is emblematic of what happened
in the four years

34
00:02:47,709 --> 00:03:16,999
- that preceded it.
- It was a war

35
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:20,999
with a senseless beginning.
In 1914,

36
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:24,999
Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
heir to the Austrian throne,

37
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:27,834
visited Sarajevo.
Young Bosnian Serb

38
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,417
nationalists,
including a 19-year-old

39
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:35,999
named Gavrilo Princip,
plotted his assassination.

40
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:43,999
The capture of the assassins
revealed no deep

41
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:47,999
international plotting.
But the murder set off a tumble

42
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,999
of diplomatic blunders that
plunged 20 countries into

43
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:54,999
a disaster that would slaughter
a whole generation of youth,

44
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:58,709
over 8 million soldiers,
and a great European

45
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:04,999
civilization.
The Great War began

46
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:12,999
on August 4, 1914.
Germany launched

47
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,999
the opening attack.
With its crack army and

48
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:18,999
superior war plans, it planned
to finish the war early with

49
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:22,999
a crushing flank attack on Paris
through neutral Belgium.

50
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:24,999
But a brave French
counterattack

51
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:27,999
on the River Marne
caused their plan to founder.

52
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:31,999
Soon both sides were locked
along trenches that stretched

53
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:42,125
some 600 miles.
The soldiers of previous

54
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,999
European wars had mostly fought
in short, vicious battles of

55
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:50,999
maneuver where mobility and
strategy were quickly decisive.

56
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,542
In 1914, the strategy
would shrivel to a matter

57
00:04:54,542 --> 00:05:03,834
of who could kill fastest
and in the most massive numbers.

58
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,999
>> One of the aspects
of World War I

59
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:10,292
was in terms not of technology
but of demographics.

60
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:14,999
The last time that the major
European powers had fought was

61
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:18,959
actually 100 years before
in the Napoleonic war,

62
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,999
when the population of Europe
was 180 million.

63
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:29,999
By 1914, it was 390 million,
and it became quite possible

64
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:34,999
to run lines
from the Swiss Alps all the way

65
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:37,999
to the English Channel.
Two opposing lines.

66
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:41,999
No flanks to turn.
Stalemate was almost

67
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:46,999
a guarantee, and stalemate
meant attrition.

68
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:51,999
The aging military
leadership, all through

69
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,999
the war, failed to develop
new tactics and retained

70
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:58,999
the verities of bygone wars.
Typical was the man who would

71
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:01,999
be the British supreme
commander at the war's end,

72
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:08,417
Sir Douglas Haig.
>> Sir Douglas Haig was a man

73
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:12,999
who was still caught up in the
19th-century form of warfare.

74
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,999
In much ways, he was like
American officers

75
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:19,999
who had been trained
to fight the Native Americans

76
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:23,125
on the Western frontier--
quick sort of open warfare,

77
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,999
quick charges,
that sort of thing.

78
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:29,292
Neither Haig or some of
the American officers early on

79
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,999
recognized the fact
that the First World War

80
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:40,999
was a war of technology.
>> World War I was

81
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:44,999
a particular horror.
The use of gas, the use

82
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:48,999
of airplanes bombing cities,
the use of tanks, and most of

83
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:54,999
all the use of machine guns
mowing down people in rows

84
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:59,292
was particularly terrible,
particularly horrific.

85
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:02,999
Even deadlier was
the introduction of light,

86
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:06,999
accurate, fast-firing artillery.
A recoiling barrel meant that

87
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:10,999
the gun carriage stayed
in position after each shot and

88
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:14,999
the crew could remain in place.
Rates of fire and casualties

89
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:17,999
soared.
Repeatedly, artillery

90
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:21,999
was lined up, a gun
every 6 yards for 15 miles,

91
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:27,999
and the objective pounded
with perhaps 4 million shells.

92
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,999
Then infantrymen would advance
over open, featureless terrain,

93
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:38,999
perhaps 120,000 of them,
walking into a steel shredder.

94
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:47,709
French casualties in the first
two months of the war--

95
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:53,834
dead, wounded, prisoners,
and missing--came to 360,000.

96
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:57,709
Germany had suffered
241,000 casualties.

97
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:02,999
The British had lost 30,000 men
in the first month.

98
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:06,999
Every man who had survived to
these last few days of the war

99
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:10,999
was, for the moment, a victor
over stupendous odds and

100
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,999
misguided leadership.
No amount of futile deaths

101
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:17,292
in huge offensives that went
nowhere had ever dented the

102
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:19,999
assumption of the opposing
general staffs that only

103
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,999
a few hundred thousand more guns
and men would produce

104
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:27,999
a breakthrough and victory.
A junior officer wrote

105
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:31,999
nervously, "They decided that
all they needed was another and

106
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,292
more copious supply of men
and a larger quantity

107
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:38,959
of ammunition."
And he feared that the generals

108
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,999
would want just one more try
at, literally, the 11th hour

109
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:46,999
of the last day.
>> Since the war on the Western

110
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:50,999
Front was a war of attrition,
the generals had to harden

111
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:53,999
themselves to the losses of
these troops.

112
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:57,999
And apparently they did so
rather well, because they kept

113
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:07,000
pouring these young men
into untenuous situations.

114
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,999
>> So you had these generals
which seemed, to the average

115
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:13,999
solider in line, who were
coming up with just ideas of

116
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:17,999
offensives, of throwing them out
into no-man's-land

117
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:23,417
- with little territory gained.
- The generals began

118
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:27,999
using the word "attrition" more
and more openly in describing

119
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:31,999
their strategy--in short,
to see which side could bleed

120
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:39,834
the other to death first.
As the last day of the war

121
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:43,542
approached, it was as though
the months and years before

122
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:47,125
had never happened at the
slaughterhouses of the Somme,

123
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:53,999
at Verdun, at Ypres, at Arras,
and Passchendaele;

124
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:58,125
as if futile headlong charges,
fast-firing long-range

125
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,999
artillery, and the machine gun
had never been invented;

126
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:07,959
and as if troops had never
piled up on the wire.

127
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,999
The last day of the war was
about to be fought,

128
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:15,999
and it would look very much
like the first day.

129
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:53,999
By 1918, Britain,
France, and Germany were all

130
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:59,999
bled white by four years of
stupefying battles of attrition.

131
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:03,292
Russia had quit the war,
freeing German armies for the

132
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:08,834
Western Front.
But America was about to enter

133
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,999
the fight on the Allied side.
The German General Erich

134
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:16,999
Ludendorff launched an all-out
last-ditch offensive to end

135
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,999
the war before the fresh,
aggressive American troops

136
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:22,999
could arrive
in overwhelming force.

137
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:26,999
>> One of the reasons that
Germany sought an armistice was

138
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:30,999
the failure of the Ludendorff
offensive that began

139
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:36,999
in March of 1918.
Ludendorff and the German

140
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,999
general staff had put
a tremendous amount of changes

141
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,999
in effect in the German army--
using small 10- to 11-man

142
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:48,999
organizations with portable
weapons like flamethrowers

143
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,999
and light machine guns,
using infiltration tactics

144
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:56,999
to break into the rear
of the Allied forces

145
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:00,959
- and continue an offensive.
- Ludendorff's

146
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,999
tactics were initially
a stunning success, pushing the

147
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:08,125
Allies steadily backwards for
many miles with heavy losses.

148
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,999
But the Allies soon developed
a counterstrategy--to give

149
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:15,542
ground, to bend backwards
until the German offensive had

150
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:18,999
overstretched and outrun
its supply lines.

151
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,999
Only when the exhausted
attackers slowed and halted

152
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:24,999
did the Allies re-engage them
frontally and drive their

153
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:27,999
thrust back with uncountable
casualties.

154
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:30,834
And quickly the Germans saw
that they had used

155
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:35,125
their last strength to repeat
the last four futile years.

156
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,999
With this final draining
exercise, Germany came to the

157
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:45,999
decision to seek an armistice.
Germany was collapsing beyond

158
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,999
its battlefields.
At home, the starving people

159
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:52,999
were rioting in the streets.
The German navy

160
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:55,999
was in rebellion.
With the realization

161
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:59,125
that imperial Germany was
disappearing, the military

162
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,999
leadership had to stop fighting
as soon as possible in order to

163
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:06,292
get reliable troops back home
to restore order.

164
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:08,999
Their motivation for
an armistice was nothing less

165
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:12,999
than the salvation of Germany
as a nation.

166
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,999
>> The armistice--
November 11, 1918--

167
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:19,999
actually stemmed from an event
that happened in January

168
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,999
of 1918.
And that's when President

169
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:26,999
Woodrow Wilson offered
his Fourteen Points to conclude

170
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:29,999
the war.
Among those were that Germany

171
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:33,999
had to give back all the ground
that she had gained during

172
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:39,000
World War I, as well as
Alsace-Lorraine, a piece of

173
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,999
French territory that had been
taken by the Germans in the

174
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:50,292
Franco-Prussian war of 1870.
When Germany was running out

175
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:55,999
of steam in the fall of 1918,
they quickly grasped for

176
00:13:55,999 --> 00:14:00,999
Wilson's Fourteen Points.
And it was on that document

177
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:04,999
that they made their appeal
for peace, because it was

178
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:13,999
- the best deal they could get.
- On November 8,

179
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:17,999
1918, German and French
negotiators met in a rail car

180
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:21,999
in Compiegne, France,
to begin armistice talks.

181
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:24,999
The Allies were fully aware
of the terms the Germans were

182
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:28,999
willing to accept, which took
away any need to fight

183
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:34,999
one additional day for territory
already conceded.

184
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:43,999
But, immediately, negotiations
took a grim turn.

185
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:48,999
>> Ferdinand Foch, who was the
Allied commander in chief,

186
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:52,999
led the delegation at Compiegne
in the railroad car

187
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:55,999
to discuss negotiations
for the armistice.

188
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,834
And by this time,
Foch was an angry man.

189
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:03,999
I think that best describes him.
He was willing to take little

190
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:08,999
concessions from the Germans.
And so, therefore,

191
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,999
to be able to sit down with
the German army that had caused

192
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:16,999
such devastation, caused such
financial loss, and to have

193
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,999
a peaceful negotiation with them
was something beyond him.

194
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,999
"Ask these
gentlemen what they want" was

195
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:27,999
his shockingly dismissive
opening statement.

196
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,999
When the Germans stammered
that they expected to discuss

197
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:34,542
armistice terms, Foch
stonewalled them again with,

198
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:41,999
"Tell these gentlemen I have
no proposals to make."

199
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:45,999
What Foch wanted was Germany's
admission that she alone had

200
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:49,999
sought armistice.
Obtaining that, he then

201
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,999
hammered her delegates with
a humiliating and merciless list

202
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:58,999
of 34 demands for territory
and reparations.

203
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,999
Unable to forge a cease-fire
on the spot, the Germans had

204
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:06,999
to make time-consuming
communications with Berlin

205
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:11,999
to present the harsh terms to
their homeland leadership.

206
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:15,999
>> Foch gave the Germans
72 hours in which to agree

207
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:20,999
to the armistice.
And during this time,

208
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:24,999
brave men were dying
when it was quite obvious

209
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:29,292
that the Germans were going
to sign up for an armistice

210
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:35,999
and there was no need
for any more dying.

211
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:41,709
So here's a 72-hour period of
time when people on both sides

212
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:48,999
were sacrificing their life
for no good reason.

213
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:52,999
>> The German chief Erzberger
pleaded, "For God's sake,

214
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:57,417
Marshal, let us stop the
fighting during those 72 hours.

215
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,999
Let's not have senseless
killing while we talk."

216
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:04,999
But Foch was adamant.
He'd lost his son in this war.

217
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:07,000
He'd lost his son-in-law
on the same day.

218
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,417
He had seen his country
devastated.

219
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:12,999
And, as he put it to his staff,
"We're going to hold the swords

220
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:19,834
to the back of the Hun
to the very last minute."

221
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,999
The Allies were
certain to demand that

222
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:27,999
Germany's despised leader,
Kaiser Wilhelm, step down

223
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:31,999
as part of negotiations,
and his staff asked him do so.

224
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:34,999
Wilhelm, ever raging to
continue the war

225
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:38,999
to the last soldier, refused.
>> Some of their leaders had

226
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:42,709
talked to him on November 8th,
brought up the fact that he was

227
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:44,999
going to have to abdicate
the throne.

228
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:47,999
He didn't accept it.
Finally, on the 9th,

229
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:50,999
he does accept it.
Then you have to move him out

230
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:53,999
of Germany.
So all during this time,

231
00:17:53,999 --> 00:18:00,125
battle is still going on
in the Western Front.

232
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:04,999
An average of
2,250 troops on all sides were

233
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:07,999
dying on the Western Front
every day that the fighting

234
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,999
went on.
The Germans finally realized

235
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:15,999
that more time would buy them
nothing but more death

236
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:21,999
and returned
to the negotiating table.

237
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:24,999
>> The German and Allied
representatives who met to

238
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:28,999
arrange an armistice on the
morning of November 11th signed

239
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:32,999
at 5:00 that morning.
However, the ceasefire was not

240
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:38,999
to take effect until 11:00.
So we have six hours of

241
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:44,999
a decisional no-man's-land.
What's to happen between then?

242
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:49,999
The only order that was given
was to stop fighting at 11:00.

243
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:53,999
And so we had a situation where
commanders had to determine,

244
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,999
what were they going to do with
their divisions in the interim?

245
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,999
Essentially,
there were two groups.

246
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:02,999
There were the professional
career officers who saw

247
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:07,999
a fast-fading opportunity
for glory, for victory,

248
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:10,999
and perhaps promotion.
And you had a more sensible,

249
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:15,417
humane factor who reasoned,
"This war is going to be over.

250
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:19,999
Why should I send my men to
die today for territory that

251
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:27,999
they can walk into peacefully
tomorrow?"

252
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:31,999
At 5:00 a.m.
Paris time on November 11th,

253
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:35,999
on paper, the war was over.
It was a moment that should

254
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:39,999
have unleashed joy and
salvation for the soldiers.

255
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:43,999
But on the last day
of World War I, many officers

256
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:50,417
would decide to keep fighting
to the last awful second.

257
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:18,999
The armistice
ending the Great War

258
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:24,999
on November 11, 1918,
had been signed at 5:00 a.m.

259
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:28,125
But the fighting on the last
day of World War I was to

260
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:40,999
rage on until 11:00 a.m.
On the German side, a young

261
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:44,000
veteran, Herbert Sulzbach,
had been pondering

262
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
his personal good fortune
in these closing minutes.

263
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,709
"I do not believe," he confided
to his diary, "that there are

264
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,999
many soldiers who were
stationed at the front for

265
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:59,709
50 months and are coming home
as I am now, unwounded."

266
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:02,709
But suddenly he was looking
at a menacing advance

267
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:06,417
of enemy troops.
A brown mass was emerging

268
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:10,999
from the American line as if
the ground itself were moving.

269
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:16,999
What lunacy was this?
The war was over and lost.

270
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:19,292
The German officers had read
them the cease-fire order

271
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:23,834
earlier that morning.
They had no desire to kill more.

272
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:29,999
Yet they still had a mission.
>> Here was an army that had

273
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:33,292
a very definite mission, and
that is to cover the withdrawal

274
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:38,542
of their forces so that
organized units could go back

275
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:43,999
into Germany and create
stability and to eliminate

276
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:48,999
rioting in the streets and to
save the German government.

277
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:52,999
And these soldiers were
completely baffled by American

278
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:57,999
organizations that were
attacking at the last minute.

279
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:00,999
The advancing
Americans were soldiers

280
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:04,417
of the 26th Infantry Division.
They were one of the divisions

281
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:07,999
delivering an attack planned
before the armistice, then

282
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:11,999
cancelled, then reinstated
when there were no

283
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:17,834
confirming orders to stand down
from the assault.

284
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:19,999
A look at the mindset
that kept the fighting going

285
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:22,999
to the 11th hour
could be found in a letter sent

286
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:24,999
by a tough American
artillery captain

287
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:28,999
busy raining fire on his enemy
to the last second.

288
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:32,959
To his fiancée, he wrote,
"It is a shame we can't go in

289
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:35,709
and devastate Germany
and cut off a few of

290
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:38,125
the German kids' hands and feet
and scalp a few

291
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:41,999
of their old men."
The man

292
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:45,417
behind the shocking sentiment,
Captain Harry Truman,

293
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:48,999
would one day manifest
that hardness as president

294
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:54,709
of the United States
during World War II.

295
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:57,999
Elsewhere on the last day,
American lieutenant Harry

296
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:00,999
Rennagel had rushed back to his
unit from the hospital when he

297
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:04,999
heard the armistice rumors.
He found his comrades jubilant,

298
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:08,959
then suddenly plunged
into stunned silence when

299
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:14,999
the attack order was renewed.
At 10:35 a.m., bayonets fixed,

300
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:20,999
they went over the top.
At 10:55 a.m., a shell exploded

301
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:29,709
a dozen yards from Rennagel.
"I hurried over, and there lay

302
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:32,999
five of my best men,
one fatally injured

303
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:37,999
with a hole near his heart.
He said, 'You know, we all

304
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,999
expected things to cease today,
so I wrote my girl we were to

305
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:48,999
be married when I returned.'"
There would be no wedding.

306
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:06,417
Near the center of the American
front, Marine Elton Mackin had

307
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:11,999
survived 156 days at the front.
Whether he would survive the

308
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:15,999
last day depended heavily on
the actions of his commander,

309
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:20,999
General Charles P. Summerall.
>> Summerall was

310
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:23,999
a tough officer.
On the eve of the armistice,

311
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:27,999
he calls his subordinate
commanders together and says,

312
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:32,999
"I want you to cross the Meuse
River during the night."

313
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:36,999
And then he added rather
cryptically, "I don't expect

314
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:41,542
to see any of you again."
The orders passed

315
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:44,999
down from Summerall announced
the astonishing goal of their

316
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:48,999
final attack of the war.
It was to provide support

317
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:53,125
for an operation planned for
November 14th, three days

318
00:24:53,125 --> 00:25:05,999
after the armistice.
Elton Mackin, tagged three

319
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:09,000
times for medical evacuation,
had torn up his ticket to

320
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,999
remain with his fellow Marines
as they went forward.

321
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:15,999
Enemy Maxims embedded
in the hills knocked down men

322
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,999
like target soldiers
in a shooting gallery.

323
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:21,999
Still, they kept coming.
By early morning,

324
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:24,999
the marines and the infantrymen
of the 89th Division

325
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:29,999
had crossed the Meuse River
and taken the town of Pouilly.

326
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:34,999
>> Elton Mackin survives,
gets across the Meuse River.

327
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:38,999
However, that crossing has
cost the American army

328
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:43,000
1,100 casualties
in the very last hours

329
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,999
of the war.
The very next morning,

330
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:51,999
when the fighting stops,
General Summerall goes down

331
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:54,999
to the riverbank
and takes a few steps out

332
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:57,999
onto one of these bridges,
turns around, and goes back

333
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:02,125
- to his chateau headquarters.
- General

334
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,999
Summerall's personal risk
in the operation had involved

335
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:08,999
nothing more than the danger of
getting his feet wet

336
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:14,999
in a photo opportunity.
Summerall, like all the

337
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:17,999
American officers, could claim
that on this last day of the

338
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:20,999
war, he was just interpreting
the orders of his American

339
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:24,999
commander, John Pershing.
>> John Pershing knew

340
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:28,417
that President Wilson wanted
to get this war over

341
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:32,959
as soon as possible.
But no one from Washington was

342
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,542
telling him precisely
what to do.

343
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:39,999
He took a very ambivalent
attitude towards whether or not

344
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:42,999
units should continue fighting
or not.

345
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,999
Pershing was of the opinion
that an armistice, simply

346
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:52,999
a ceasefire, would not be
sufficient to deter Germany

347
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:57,999
from again attacking in Europe
and being an aggressive nation.

348
00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:03,417
So he was not enthusiastic
at all about the armistice.

349
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:05,999
Pershing was
content to issue no commands

350
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,999
that would prevent his
ambitious officers from going

351
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:12,999
on fighting and punishing
the hated enemy until the last

352
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:16,999
possible second of the war.
>> Among the divisions engaged

353
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:19,999
on that last day was
the 81st Infantry Division.

354
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:25,999
The 81st, in those final hours,
lost 365 men.

355
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:30,834
Why?
The men had been hoping that

356
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:33,999
their war was over, that within
hours they would go on

357
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,999
to lead full lives, go home,
marry, have children,

358
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:40,999
pamper grandchildren.
So why are they sent forward?

359
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:44,999
The general who commanded the
division had information that

360
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:48,999
there were bathing facilities
in the town of Stenay,

361
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:55,999
and so the town is taken.
It's the last city that the

362
00:27:55,999 --> 00:28:00,999
Americans take in World War I.
And for this indefensible

363
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:06,999
reason, men have given
their lives.

364
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:37,999
By November 11,
1918, the war on the Western

365
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:42,999
Front had dragged on
over four horrible years.

366
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:44,999
But even as word finally
reached the front that

367
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:47,999
an armistice was coming
in a few hours,

368
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:52,999
soldiers continued to die.
The New Englanders of the 26th

369
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:56,125
Yankee Division were taking
casualties from German Maxim

370
00:28:56,125 --> 00:29:00,999
machine guns at the very moment
their neighbors back in Boston,

371
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:04,999
Providence, and New Haven began
spilling into the streets to

372
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:10,999
celebrate the end of fighting.
A tragic 192 of these men whose

373
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,999
return was already being
cheered were doomed to fall

374
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:23,417
in these last senseless hours.
>> The amazing thing about

375
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:28,125
the motivation of soldiers
on November 11th, some who

376
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:32,999
even knew that in a few hours
the armistice would go into

377
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:37,999
effect, was they would attack
simply because their comrades

378
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:42,999
were attacking.
And so they went with them.

379
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:46,999
Why the doomed
soldiers went forward with

380
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:49,999
their units could only be
explained by the superhuman

381
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:52,999
bond they had formed
with one another.

382
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:57,959
A soldier wrote in his war log,
"We give away anything we have

383
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:00,999
if we think the other fellow
needs it more than we do.

384
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:05,125
I like the unselfish attitude
up here so much that, in many

385
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:10,542
ways, I wish I could live
on the front forever."

386
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:17,999
On the last day, this human
caring was the only visible

387
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,999
good to have come out
of all the killing.

388
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:24,999
As the clock ticked down,
there was an unspoken question

389
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:27,999
in the casual spending
of American life

390
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:31,999
with nothing left to gain.
Why were African-American

391
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:35,999
soldiers, almost unused
by Pershing through so much of

392
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:40,999
the war, committed to a frontal
assault in the last hours?

393
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:44,999
Were some lives worth less
than others?

394
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:48,417
>> At the front on the last day
of the war is the 92nd Division.

395
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:52,999
This is an all-black division
run by white officers.

396
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:57,125
They rallied around the flag in
the hope that what they could

397
00:30:57,125 --> 00:31:01,709
not earn in the cotton patch or
in the cornfield, they could

398
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:03,999
earn on the battlefield--
that is, full American

399
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:05,999
citizenship.
Still, in this war,

400
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:07,999
they received
second-class treatment,

401
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:11,292
second-class training,
second-class equipment,

402
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:16,000
- and second-class duties.
- These troops had

403
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,999
excelled in battle when
assigned to French units.

404
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:21,999
But under poor American
leadership, a few had faltered

405
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:27,999
in battle and were stigmatized.
Lieutenant General Robert Lee

406
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:30,999
Bullard wrote of them,
"Our government seemed

407
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:33,999
to expect the same of them
as of white men.

408
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:40,999
Poor Negroes.
They are hopelessly inferior."

409
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:46,999
>> The 92nd assumes on the eve
of the armistice that their war

410
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,999
is over.
They're going to survive.

411
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:52,999
They're going to go back home.
However, the next morning,

412
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:57,709
there remains in force
an operational plan involving

413
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:03,834
the blacks in the 92nd.
John Sherburne, a general,

414
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,999
questions the corps commander,
the army commander.

415
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:10,999
"Are we really sending the men
into battle at this late hour?"

416
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:14,709
He's informed, "Yes."
And he describes his reaction

417
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:22,417
- as one of absolute horror.
- On that last

418
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:25,999
morning of the war, the men of
the 92nd came out of their

419
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:29,999
position in a wooded area
to a hail of German machine gun

420
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:33,999
and artillery fire.
Some 190 of these

421
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:38,999
African-American soldiers died
within hours of the end

422
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,999
of the war.
Major Warren Ross was

423
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:44,999
an officer with the 92nd.
When the war ended,

424
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:47,959
a heartbroken Major Ross
wrote sadly

425
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:52,834
of their brave performance.
"My heroic battalion.

426
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:55,709
The battalion has earned
undying fame for itself,

427
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:58,999
its regiment, its brigade,
its division, and for

428
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:05,999
the American colored race."
Hundreds of miles up the front,

429
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:08,999
the town of Mons, where the
British Expedition Force had

430
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:11,999
suffered their first major
defeat in the first days of

431
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:15,999
the war, had powerful symbolic
significance.

432
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:18,999
The battle's survivors had been
given a treasured special

433
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:25,999
decoration, the Mons Star.
Now, four years later, when

434
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,999
the British could have marched
unopposed into Mons

435
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:30,999
on November 12th,
they chose to attack

436
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:34,999
and retake it on the 11th.
Sergeant Will Bird was one

437
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:39,542
of the first men
into the outskirts.

438
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:42,959
>> They find
three dead soldiers.

439
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:47,999
Bird notices that they are
wearing the Mons Star.

440
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:51,999
That means that these are men
who were engaged the very

441
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:54,999
first day of the war.
They have survived to the very

442
00:33:54,999 --> 00:34:01,999
last day only to die
in the last hours.

443
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:06,999
And so the British high command
has achieved its symbolic wish;

444
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:11,999
the first defeat of the British
has been vindicated by their

445
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:15,125
recapture of the city of Mons.
They are back

446
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:23,999
where they started the war
700,000 British lives later.

447
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:27,999
On November 11th,
the cannoneers that had created

448
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,709
the artillery hell that had
characterized the war were not

449
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:34,999
only unwilling to end their
barrages; they eagerly

450
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:39,709
redoubled their fire.
>> In the very last hours of

451
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:43,999
the war, there was a terrific
bombardment.

452
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,999
Every side is firing off
every round of ammunition

453
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:49,999
they have left.
It's as though at a country

454
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:52,125
fair, they want to shoot off
all the fireworks

455
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:57,000
before the festivities end.
This ammunition is being

456
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,999
fired off randomly to get rid
of it and in expectation of

457
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,999
the arrival of peace.
But these rounds don't make

458
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:08,999
that distinction,
and in the very last moments,

459
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:17,125
men are dying from this random
artillery fire.

460
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:20,999
Death stayed to
the very last moment of the war

461
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:23,999
and was about to provide
Private Henry Gunther of the

462
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:32,709
American 313th a tragic place
in American history.

463
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:36,999
>> On this last morning of
the war, Henry is positioned

464
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:42,999
along a hillside in a place
called Ville-devant-Chaumont.

465
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:45,999
Just hours left in the war,
but the 313th doesn't know it.

466
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:47,999
No word has yet reached
this regiment.

467
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:51,999
With 16 minutes left
in the war, a runner catches up

468
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:56,999
to the 313th and says,
"Ceasefire at 11:00."

469
00:35:56,999 --> 00:35:59,417
Nothing is said about what is
to happen in these last

470
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:04,999
16 minutes.
Up ahead are German machine gun

471
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:07,999
emplacements.
Henry Gunther

472
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,999
starts approaching
these machine guns.

473
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:15,999
His men alongside and his
comrades urge him to stay back.

474
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:18,999
The Germans are appalled
by this.

475
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:21,999
They're waving him back.
He moves on.

476
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:26,999
He's shot through the head.
Henry Gunther dies at 10:59

477
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:30,417
that morning with a minute left
in the war and becomes

478
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:36,999
officially the last American
casualty of World War I.

479
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:43,999
According to the
most conservative estimates,

480
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:47,999
during the last day of the war,
principally in the six hours

481
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:51,999
after the armistice was signed,
all sides on the Western Front

482
00:36:51,999 --> 00:37:00,999
suffered 10,944 casualties,
with 2,738 deaths.

483
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:07,125
Eventually, people were going
to ask why.

484
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:23,417
Taking the daily
rate of death and wounding in

485
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:26,999
the Great War as a standard,
had Marshal Foch accepted

486
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:29,999
Mattias Erzberger's plea
to stop the fighting

487
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:33,999
on November 8th while
negotiations were underway,

488
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:38,999
it is likely that 6,624 lives
would have been spared

489
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:45,999
and 14,895 maimed, burned,
gassed, and blinded men would

490
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:52,999
instead have gone home whole.
A parent supplied

491
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:56,999
a heartbreaking epitaph:
"To all the world,

492
00:37:56,999 --> 00:38:03,542
he was a soldier.
To me, he was all the world."

493
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:07,999
>> Soon after the war ended in
1918, members of Congress began

494
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:11,125
receiving rather poignant
letters.

495
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:17,999
People wanted to know why did
a son, a husband, a brother die

496
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:22,999
in the last hours of a war
when it was clearly known that

497
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:30,542
the war was about to end.
On that last day

498
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,000
of World War I,
the American forces alone

499
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,999
suffered casualties
of over 3,200 men.

500
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:43,000
Subsequently, when these
letters became numerous enough,

501
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,999
Congress created
a subcommittee to investigate

502
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:51,999
- this matter.
- On November 5,

503
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:55,999
1919, almost a year after
Armistice Day, General Pershing

504
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:58,999
was called to testify before
the House of Representatives'

505
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:03,999
Committee On Military Affairs.
He was questioned by

506
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:07,999
congressman Alvan Fuller.
Fuller probed directly at why

507
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:11,417
American troops were ordered
over the top on the morning

508
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,999
of the last day.
Under the terms of the

509
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:16,999
armistice, these same troops
could have marched peacefully

510
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:23,999
into Germany at 11:00.
Pershing cited that the leader

511
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:27,125
of the Allied armies, Ferdinand
Foch, had not commanded

512
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:31,834
a cessation of hostilities
and that he, Pershing,

513
00:39:31,834 --> 00:39:34,542
as the American commander,
had properly informed

514
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:38,999
his subordinate officers
of the fact of the armistice.

515
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:41,999
But he had said nothing about
what they should do

516
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:45,999
until 11:00 a.m.
His order thus created a limbo

517
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:47,999
in which these commanders were
free to decide whether

518
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:50,999
to keep sending men
into the meat grinder

519
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:55,999
or to cease fighting at once.
Different decisions ended lives

520
00:39:55,999 --> 00:40:03,999
or preserved them.
Subcommittee member Oscar Bland

521
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:06,999
stepped in and knifed to the
heart of the matter as he

522
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:09,999
questioned the reluctant key
witness, General Fox Conner,

523
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:17,999
Pershing's chief of operations.
Bland demanded, "Would it have

524
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,999
been best under the
circumstances to have included

525
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:24,999
in that order that hostilities
should cease as soon as

526
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:29,999
practicable before 11:00?"
Conner stonewalled.

527
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:33,417
"No, sir, I do not."
Bland pursued

528
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:36,999
with icy determination.
"How many generals did you lose

529
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:41,999
that day?"
"None," said Conner.

530
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:45,834
"How many colonels did you lose
that day?"

531
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:49,999
"I do not know how many were
lost," replied Connor.

532
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,999
Bland said coldly,
"I am convinced

533
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:56,999
that on November 11th,
there was not any officer

534
00:40:56,999 --> 00:41:03,999
of very high rank taking any
chance of losing his own life."

535
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:08,999
He then spoke for all the
unnecessarily bereaved families.

536
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,999
"I resent that these lives were
lost, and the American people

537
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:19,292
resent the fact that these
lives were lost."

538
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:22,999
General John Sherburne,
a decorated officer, pulled no

539
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:27,292
punches in his denunciation of
the events of November 11th.

540
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:30,999
He testified, "They did not
look upon human life

541
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:33,999
as the important thing.
They had set up what, in my

542
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:37,999
opinion, was a false standard
of excellence of divisions

543
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:41,999
according the amount of ground
gained by each division.

544
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,999
It was much like a child who
had been given a toy that he is

545
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:48,999
very much interested in and
that he knows within a day

546
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:52,999
or two it is going to be taken
away from him, and he wants to

547
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:59,542
use that toy up to the handle
while he has it."

548
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:04,999
By the end of January,
the hearing concluded.

549
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:07,999
The committee arrived
at the verdict that needless

550
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,959
slaughter had occurred on the
last day of World War I.

551
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:15,834
The full Select Committee on
expenditures in the war adopted

552
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:18,999
the report.
Justice and the placement of

553
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:22,999
responsibility were primed
for arrival.

554
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:27,000
But then the politicians
stepped in, wrapping themselves

555
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,999
alternately in the flag
and raw partisan maneuvering.

556
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:36,542
The report was preparing to
defame America's victorious

557
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:38,999
leadership in a war that had
brought the nation

558
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:41,999
onto the world stage.
The names of the generals

559
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:47,999
Liggett, Pershing, and Bullard
were going on monuments.

560
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:51,292
Some in Congress saw
a Republican plot to criticize

561
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:55,999
the army and the conduct of the
war by a Democrat president.

562
00:42:55,999 --> 00:43:01,999
The report was recalled.
The recall set off three hours

563
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:05,999
of acrimonious debate
that changed nothing.

564
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:09,417
On March 3rd, any imputation
that American lives had been

565
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:12,999
needlessly sacrificed on the
last day of World War I had

566
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:16,959
been struck away.
Nothing remained of the tragedy

567
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:26,999
except thousands
of broken hearts.

568
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:30,999
>> But on all sides,
there were men who would not be

569
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:36,999
returning home to wives, to
careers, to becoming parents,

570
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:42,709
to becoming pampering
grandparents.

571
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:45,999
They would not be returning home
because of the decisions made

572
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:51,999
out of vainglory and pride
by other men whose lives were

573
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:56,999
- not risked that last morning.
- The madness of

574
00:43:56,999 --> 00:44:01,000
fighting to the last moment
of the 11th month, 11th day,

575
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,999
11th hour soon would be
forgotten in the long euphoria

576
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:09,709
of armistice celebrations
and victory parades.

577
00:44:09,709 --> 00:44:13,999
Nobody yet realized that
victory would have its costs.

578
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:16,999
The vengeful armistice
had paved the way

579
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:21,999
for an even bloodier conflict.
The war to end all wars

580
00:44:21,999 --> 00:44:24,000
would be refought
by the same enemies

581
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,999
barely 20 years later.
It turned out that the dying

582
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,999
from the first day onward
had been as senseless

583
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:43,417
as it had been on the last.
