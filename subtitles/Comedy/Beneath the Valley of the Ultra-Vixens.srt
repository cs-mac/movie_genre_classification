- How's it going, man?
- How you doing, baby?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,278
- What's up?!
- I really appreciate you doing this for me.

4
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:15,333
This is some serious proposal-ing wedding-type shit you're doing.

5
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,300
Oh, man, Phoebe is gonna love this.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,400
- You're a sensitive nigger, bitch.
- Well, I love her.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,000
- You gotta give it all when you love like that, you know what I mean?
- Want to drop some acid, go inside a titty bar?

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,576
No. It's 8:15 in the morning.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,868
Cherry progressive, listen.

10
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:33,068
Man of red set is in motion.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,710
Echo choir has been breached.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,411
- Was that a lyric from something?
- Fuck.

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,240
Hey stop! Stop doing shit to my car!

14
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:02,726
I just killed two people!

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,683
- That's awesome!
- They had guns and knives and they were being like total dicks.

16
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:07,670
- You called the cops?!
- No, I didn't call the police

17
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:10,031
because I've got a lot of weed and, like, mushrooms in my car.

18
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:11,340
How the fuck did this happened?!

19
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,912
I don't know, but I'm like freaking out all over the place.
Babe, I have a lot of anxiety about this.

20
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:17,477
Oh, fuck!

21
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:20,722
- I'm sorry.
- Drop it!

22
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:26,022
Agent Hal has been activated. He killed two operatives with a spoon, sir.

23
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,500
A fucking spoon?!

24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,169
- We're terminating asset Hal!
- Are you fucking insane?

25
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:32,369
Oh, language...

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,855
Something very weird is happening to me. I keep killing people.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,840
- And there's a chance I may be a robot.
- You are not a robot.

28
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:41,699
You trying to get into our lives? Huh, huh, Mike, nuh-huh.

29
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:44,735
This guy is a trained killer!

30
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:47,384
We made him, he's a security risk.

31
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,012
So you're gonna blow up the town.

32
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:51,212
Catch!

33
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,279
No!
Help me!

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,800
I'm going to save my girlfriend.

35
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:04,786
Go! Go!

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,600
Well, the old frying pan bullet trick.

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,543
- We'll take my car and we'll get stoned.
- You want to get high right now?!

38
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,820
Okay.
No, no. I recognize that now is like a faux pas.
